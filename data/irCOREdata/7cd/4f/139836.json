The laser\ndiode emission is scanned across a single absorption line of the target gas, and \/ or modulated in\nwavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS)[1]. Many practical implementations of these techniques have\nshown that the detection sensitivity is limited by interference fringes and not by the theoretical limit given\nby detector noise [2,3]. The interference fringes stem from Fabry-P\u00e9rot etalons between reflecting or\nscattering surfaces such as mirrors, lenses, optical fibre end faces, detector and laser head windows,\nsemiconductor surfaces, and components of multipass cells[1], and also from low levels of optical feedback\nto the laser diode[4].\nThe etalons often exhibit a free spectral range similar to the linewidth of the absorbing species and appear\nas periodic spectral features with sufficient amplitude to obscure weak absorption signals[5]. Bomse et al.[6]\nsuggested that gas cell windows are often the worst culprits. Narrow laser linewidths (tens of megahertz)\nused to resolve individual gas lines have correspondingly long coherence lengths (tens of metres). An\netalon formed between the windows of a gas cell with a typical length of 10cm will give rise to fringes\nwith a spacing of approximately 1GHz (0.033cm-1), which is comparable to gas absorption linewidths at\natmospheric pressure.\nA number of techniques have been used to reduce interference fringes in TDLS, which in general fall into\nthree broad categories. In the first, a frequency jitter is applied to the laser diode and the signal is\nintegrated, averaging out the fringes[7]. The second category involves post detection filtering using high\npass filters[1], low pass filters[8] or Fourier domain analysis[9]. However, neither category can deliver an\nimprovement in signal to noise ratios for fringes whose FSR is comparable to the gas absorption\nlinewidth[1]. In the final category, the fringe spacing is mechanically modulated and the resultant signal is\nintegrated to average zero, or to minimise the contribution of the fringes to the absorption signal. This has\nbeen implemented using longitudinal dithering of optical elements[6], an oscillating mirror [2,10] and an\noscillating Brewster-plate spoiler[11]. While effective, this approach limits the available detection\nbandwidth and adds to system complexity.\nAll the above approaches benefit if etalon formation is minimised, by reducing and misaligning Fresnel\nreflections. Standard designs for TDLS gas cells therefore include wedging and angling of all windows,\n3antireflection coating of windows and lens surfaces, and angle polishing optical fibre ends. This results in\ntight alignment tolerances that are difficult to fabricate and to maintain in the field[12]. We present the\nresults of a new approach using optical diffusers in reflection or transmission. These components offer\nsimple alignment and can disrupt the formation of optical etalons within the gas cell. However, their use\nintroduces new issues to be considered that can also limit performance, namely laser speckle and the\neffects of optical feedback. In Part 1 of this paper we show how an understanding of these issues, and how\nthey relate to TDLS, can be used to optimise the design of simple, single or dual pass cells. Both objective\nspeckle (without a lens) and subjective speckle (in which a lens is used to collect light onto the\nphotodetector) are considered. We report the results of a comparison of different cell geometries at the\ndesign stage, and experiments with a simple transmissive geometry. In Part 2 of this paper we also report a\nstudy of the same performance-limiting effects in integrating spheres \u2013 the optical diffuser analogue of\nmultipass cells.\nInterest in this approach is growing. Chen et al. have used a diffuse reflector manufactured from anodised\naluminium in an industrial oxygen sensor[13]. A group at Lund University have used TDLS to explore\nporous and scattering media including pharmaceutical samples[14] and biological tissue[15]. Finally, the\nreflective cells that we consider here have much in common with the standard configuration for laser\npointer style gas detectors, in which light from the laser is backscattered from an uncontrolled and\ntypically diffusely reflecting background target [16,17,18].\n2 Theory\n2.1 Gas detection\nMethane has a well-known 2\uf06e3 absorption band in the near infrared region of the spectrum, centred around\n1.66\u03bcm, shown in Figure 1. We have used the R4 quadruplet line at 1.651 nm, however our results are\ngenerally applicable to TDLS based detection of other gases using different wavelengths of operation.\n4Figure 1. Absorption spectrum for 100% methane in the near infra-red, calculated using data from the\nHITRAN database[19].\nFor monochromatic radiation, the level of light transmitted through a gas cell is given by the Beer-\nLambert law;\n0\nI exp( z )\nI\n\uf061\uf03d \uf02d (1)\nwhere I0 is the light power transmitted in the absence of light absorption, \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of\nthe measurand in cm-1 (equal to the specific absorptivity of the gas \u03b5 multiplied by the gas concentration)\nand z is the pathlength (here in cm). The gas absorptivity is often expressed in units of cm-1 per unit partial\npressure of gas; at 1651 nm and at atmospheric pressure, methane has a value of \u03b5 at the line centre of\n0.38 cm-1atm-1 [19]. At low values of \u03b1z, equation (1) approximates to the following linear relationship, for\nwhich the proportional change in detected signal is given by.\n0\n\uf061\n\uf044\n\uf0bb\nI z\nI\n(2)\nWe can therefore describe the uncertainty in the gas detection measurement as \u0394I\/I0, and translate this\ndirectly to a limit of detection for a given absorption coefficient. For wavelength modulation spectroscopy\n(WMS) using 2nd harmonic demodulation, a scale factor applies based on the modulation index used (the\nratio of wavelength modulation amplitude to linewidth at half width half maximum). For an absorption\nline with a Lorentzian profile (typical for measurements at atmospheric pressure), the 2nd harmonic\ncomponent I2 is given by [20]\n2\n0\n2I K z\nI\n\uf061\uf03d \uf02d (3)\nwhere the constant K can be optimised to a value of 0.343 by setting the modulation index to a value of\n2.2[21]. For methane at 1651 nm at atmospheric pressure, this corresponds to a dither of \u0394\uf06e = \u00b12.8 GHz or\n\u0394\u03bb = \u00b10.025 nm.\nwavelength \/ \u03bcm\n1.62 1.64 1.66 1.68 1.70 1.72\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nab\nso\nrp\ntio\nn\n\/c\nm\n-1\n1.650 1.65 1.651\n1.74\n52.2 Random laser speckle\nLaser speckle patterns are formed when coherent light is backscattered from a randomly scattering surface\nwhose surface roughness is comparable with the wavelength of illumination. The speckle is a\nsuperposition of random interferences and can be treated by assuming that the bright speckles are\nindependent and obey Poisson statistics[22] such that the standard deviation of a single speckle is equal to\nthe mean intensity. A detector placed within the speckle field integrates over a finite number of speckles;\nif N speckles are integrated, the uncertainty in the measured intensity is therefore 1\/\u221aN. Random speckle\nnoise therefore depends on the speckle size \u03b5. We can identify two distinct forms of speckle as shown in\nFigure 2, namely objective and subjective speckle.\nFigure 2. Creation of objective and subjective speckle by laser illumination of a diffusely reflective\nsurface.\nFor objective speckle, the speckle diameter \u03b50 is given by[23]\n0 1 2\n\uf06c\n\uf065 \uf03d\nz.\nd\n(4)\nwhere z is the distance from the optical diffuser to the detector and d is the illuminated extent of the\ndiffuser. Note that this equation assumes that d<<z. For subjective speckle, we have[23]\n1 2s\nL.\na\n\uf06c\n\uf065 \uf03d (5)\nwhere L is the distance from lens to detector, and a is the diameter of the lens aperture. If there are N\nindependent speckles, the RMS deviation from a zero baseline for either form of speckle is given by\nobjective\nspeckle\npattern\n(d = 4 mm)\nsubjective\nspeckle\npattern\n(a = 3 mm)\naperture a\ndiameter a\nd\nz\nL\n60\n1 \uf065\uf044\n\uf03d \uf03d\nI\nI DN\n(6)\nwhere D is diameter of the detector. In the worst case, if the deviations cannot be removed (eg by baseline\nsubtraction), they translate to uncertainty in the measurement. We have evaluated the resulting uncertainty\nas \u0394I\/I0 for both types of speckle, making some assumptions about the cell geometry. The results are\nshown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

For the small wavelength scans\ntypical of TDLS, the speckles remain essentially in place, however each speckle moves in and out of\nphase. Fujii and Lit have calculated the mean deviation in the measured intensity at a single on-axis point\nfor a change in wavelength \u0394\u03bb\n[24], as follows.\n\uf028 \uf029\n1\npoint 2 2 2\n0\n1 exp\n\uf044\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d \uf044\n\uf0eb \uf0fb\nI\nh k\nI\n(7)\nWhere \u0394k is the change in wavenumber, k=2\u03c0\/\u03bb. This equation can be applied equally to direct\nspectroscopy, in which case \u0394\u03bb denotes the width of the wavelength scan or of the region used to perform\na baseline analysis or fit, or to WMS, in which case \u0394\u03bb denotes the wavelength modulation. For small \u0394\u03bb,\nthis approximates to the following, which is linear with \u0394\u03bb:\npoint\n2\n0\n2 \uf06c\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf044 \uf044\n\uf0bb\nI\nh\nI\n(8)\n7where h is a characteristic of the diffuse object and represents the RMS path difference in reflected or\ntransmitted light paths from the diffuser. For a simple, single scattering reflector, this would be equivalent\nto twice the mean surface height deviation. If we assume that h ~ 6 \u03bcm, as for the experimental example\ngiven later in this paper, equation (7)\u2019s deviation from linearity is less than 1% as long as \u0394\u03bb < 14 nm,\ntherefore equation (8) can be used with confidence. Equations (7) and (8) can be considered improvement\nfactors for the resulting speckle noise; integrating over N independent speckles then yields the total RMS\nuncertainty in measured signal for small wavelength changes:\n2\n0\n2\uf070 \uf06c\n\uf06c\n\uf044 \uf044\n\uf03d\nI h\nI N\n. (9)\nHere, \u0394I represents the uncertainty in DC intensity in a direct spectroscopy experiment; the corresponding\nuncertainty in the 2nd harmonic component in a WMS experiment can be found by reference to equation\n(3). The resulting measured uncertainty is given in Table 1. The measured change in the speckle field\ntherefore depends on the values of \u0394\u03bb and h. For h~\u03bb and \u0394\u03bb ~ 0.025 nm, the level of uncertainty would be\nreduced by a factor of around 104. Thus, there is a significant benefit to operating over a narrow spectral\nrange \u2013 the narrower, the better. If one were to work with low pressure gases, with narrower linewidths,\nthe uncertainty \u0394I\/I0 would reduce, as indeed it does in conventional cells. For large values of h, equation\n(7) tends to unity and there is no difference in the measured uncertainty between a speckle field under a\nlarge phase change and the uncertainty associated with independent static speckle fields.\nFor a well-developed (high contrast) speckle field, the ideal value of h is considered to be of the order of\nthe wavelength of light. As h decreases from this value, the surface becomes more similar to a smooth\noptical surface with no benefit offered by scattering. At much higher values of h, a single scattering\nsurface will behave like a connected series of smooth surfaces, exhibiting interference with a higher\nuncertainty in the integrated intensity. We have also used multiply scattering materials such as\nSpectralonTM, for which in reflective mode the light is believe to penetrate some distance (up to 10 mm)\nbefore re-emerging as backscattered light. These materials produce well-developed, high contrast speckle\nfields, but the effective value of h for such materials is unknown.\nThere is a final factor to consider, which is whether the speckle field moves during or between\nmeasurement integration periods (which in our experiments was defined by the time constant of our lock-\nin amplifier). In the case of stable speckle, creating spectral features that do not change from one\nmeasurement to the next, subtraction of the zero baseline would reduce the speckle uncertainty to nil,\nthough subsequent long-term drift of the speckle would re-establish the speckle related uncertainty. In the\n8case of rapidly changing speckle, averaging several speckle fields during a measurement integration\nperiod reduces the statistical error. Goodman has shown that the addition of M independent (uncorrelated)\nspeckle fields reduces the speckle contrast by a factor of \u221aM [22], and we have confirmed this\nexperimentally in a gas cell configuration, by statistical analysis of a single static speckle field[25].\n2.3 Interferometric speckle\nIn speckle interferometry, a speckle field is deliberately mixed with a reference beam[26]. In a gas cell, a\nreference beam might be formed by the Fresnel reflection from a smooth cell window, as shown in Figure\n3.\nFigure 3. Observation of interferometric speckle in an in-line configuration.\nAs the wavelength is scanned, or alternatively as the value of z changes (for example because of thermal\nexpansion), the resulting speckle patterns are correlated. By subtracting subsequent speckle images from\none another (or by performing a baseline subtraction on a detected signal), interference features are\nrevealed. In speckle interferometry these are termed correlation fringes and represent an intensity\nmodulation of the randomised speckle field. We have previously demonstrated such an intensity\nmodulation arising from a gas cell that uses a diffusely reflective surface[25]. Sirohi has shown that the\nintensity modulation at the detector takes the form[26];\n\uf028 \uf029\u03b4AII cos10 \uf02b\uf03d (10)\nwhere \u03b4 is the optical phase change induced by a change of wavelength or distance z. The constant A is\nproportional to 21II , where I1 and I2 are the intensities of the reference beam and speckle field\nrespectively. Thus these interference fringes are the direct analogy of etalon \u2013 induced fringes for\nconventional gas cells.\nlaser\ndiode\nz\nphoto-\ndetector\noptically rough\nsurface\n92.4 Self-mixing interference\nAs an ideal diffuse surface scatters light in all directions, it can be hard to avoid a small proportion of this\nfalling onto the laser diode. Figure 4 shows a simplified geometry.\nFigure 4. Formation of self-mixing interference.\nSelf-mixing or feedback interference results[27], and the laser output intensity takes the form;\n\uf028 \uf0290 1I I m cos\uf064\uf03d \uf02b (11)\nwhere m is described as a modulation index (not to be confused with the modulation index used in TDLS\ndescribed previously) and again \u03b4 is the optical phase change of the cavity. m is a function of the so-called\nfeedback parameter C (dependent on the characteristics of the laser) and, for very weak feedback,\nproportional to r where r is the proportion of light reflected back into the laser diode. We have found\nthat if steps are not taken to reduce feedback, the resulting interference fringes tend to dominate\nperformance at low levels of r [4]. However, as the interference is a modulation of the total laser emission,\nthe effect is reduced to first order by the use of balanced detection schemes[4,28].\nIt is worth noting that at higher levels of optical feedback, other laser instabilities can also result including\nthe appearance of additional modes or, in extreme cases, coherence collapse. However, we have not\nexperienced these problems in our work with optical diffusers.\n2.5 Summary\nTable 2 summarises the particular issues to be considered when using optical diffusers in TDLS. It is\nworth noting that the theory relating to laser speckle has, in general, been developed for use in the field of\nspeckle interferometry and not rigorously tested in its application to TDLS. We assume here that random\nlaser speckle may not be removed by baseline subtraction, therefore it is considered to define the\nfundamental performance-limiting uncertainty of the systems we have studied. The other problems\nlaser\ndiode\nd\ndiffuse surface\n10\nhighlighted may be reduced by good design, at least in principle. Speckle uncertainty may be reduced by\nthe use of a high NA lens and \/ or a large detector. The use of diffuse optics generally results in a loss of\noptical throughput because light is scattered in all directions and not collected by the detector. Fortunately,\nuse of a high NA lens is also the logical response to such conditions. In a collimated system, use of an\nadditional transmissive lens might introduce interference fringes, however in this case the light is\nuncollimated. We have not studied whether this contributes to a lower level of interference for reflections\nwithin the lens or between the lens and the detector. If such interference were troublesome, an off-axis\nreflective lens might be used instead.\nTable 2.

For our experimental purposes,\ncompared to direct spectroscopy, this gave us the advantages of a zero baseline, a rapid response using our\nequipment and no dependence on spectral fitting algorithms. However, as the purpose of this paper is to\ninvestigate laser speckle in cells using optical diffusers, the principles should be capable of being\ntranslated to other spectroscopic techniques.\n3 Gas cell design\nWe consider first a simple reflective gas cell and calculate the expected uncertainty in the measurement\nusing the above theory. Figure 5 shows a schematic of the proposed cell geometry. Light from a laser\n11\ndiode passes through a beamsplitter, enters the cell via a wedged and AR coated window and strikes a\ndiffuse reflector after making a pass though the cell. A small proportion of the light is backscattered along\nthe incident axis and makes a second pass through the cell before being deflected by the beamsplitter\ntowards a photodiode.\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of a gas cell using a diffuse optical reflector.\nWe estimate that the minimum practical value of z for this arrangement would be 150mm, which for our\nother constraints (d = 25 mm, D = 1 mm, \u03bb = 1651nm) yields a proportional uncertainty of \u0394I\/I0 = 10-2.\nThis could be improved under wavelength modulation by up to \u0394I\/I0 = 10-6 for an optimum value of h and\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.025 nm. The cell has the advantage of using a double pass to improve detection limits. However, a\nnumber of potential disadvantages are also present. Firstly, there is a possibility of generating\ninterferometric speckle with this arrangement. Although this would be avoided by misaligning a single\nwindow, the window is relatively close to the detector and the degree of misalignment required would be\nconsequently greater. Secondly, the configuration has a relatively poor throughput as there is no lens to\nimprove the collection efficiency at the detector, and the use of a beamsplitter exacerbates the problem.\nFinally, stray reflections associated with plate or cube beamsplitters may cause additional interference\neffects. Although pellicle beamsplitters avoid these problems, they are fragile and relatively expensive.\nThe same principles were applied to a range of different gas cell design and the results are compared in\nTable 3. We have also compared the typical performance of a cell with a conventional configuration. In all\ncases we have used the same constraints, however depending on the geometry this might result in slightly\ndifferent values of z, as in the case above. It was decided to implement the final transmissive design in our\nexperiments for a number of reasons. The design is simple, and offers more convenient reduction of both\ninterferometric speckle and self-mixing interference, the latter because the majority of the light is scattered\nin the forward direction, away from the laser diode.\nlaser diode optically\nrough\nsurface\n100 mm\nphoto\ndetector\n12\nTable 3: Summary of gas cell designs.\nCell geometry Advantages Disadvantages Uncertainty \u0394I\/I0 a\n1\n\uf0b7 etalon effects reduced\nby AR coated and\nwedged windows\n\uf0b7 high sensitivity can be\nachieved\n\uf0b7 coatings can be\nexpensive at non\nstandard wavelengths\n\uf0b7 critical alignment\n10-5 \u2013 10-6 [1]\n2\n\uf0b7 double pass cell\n\uf0b7 simple geometry\n\uf0b7 possibility of\ninterferometric\nspeckle.\n\uf0b7 light inefficiency\n\uf0b7 requires 60dB isolator\nto reduce self-mixing\ninterference\n10-2 \u2013 10-6\n3\n\uf0b7 double pass cell\n\uf0b7 simple and robust\ngeometry\n\uf0b7 parabolic reflector\nimproves light\nefficiency\n\uf0b7 possible\ninterferometric speckle\n\uf0b7 requires 60dB isolator\nto reduce self-mixing\ninterference\n2\uf0b410-3 - 2\uf0b410-7\n4\n\uf0b7 double pass cell\n\uf0b7 simple and robust\ngeometry\n\uf0b7 optical fibre delivery\nenables remote\nlocation\n\uf0b7 interference effects\nassociated with fibre\ncoupling\n2\uf0b410-3 - 2\uf0b410-7\n5\n\uf0b7 simple and robust\ngeometry\n\uf0b7 interferometric speckle\nand self-mixing\ninterference reduced\n\uf0b7 single pass cell\n\uf0b7 reflected specular\ncomponent from 1st\nsurface (can be\nreduced by AR\ncoating\/wedging)\n10-2 \u2013 10-6\na 100mm cell length, max 25mm diameter optics, \u03bb = 1651nm, D = 1mm, \u0394\u03bb = 0.025nm, h \u2522 \u03bb\nIn all the gas cell designs considered here, the estimated speckle related intensity uncertainty for a single\nstatic speckle pattern remained in the range 10-2 to 2\u00d710-3. This may be improved by increasing the\ndetector size; a 5mm diameter detector would give a 5-fold improvement in the signal : noise ratio.\nHowever, these levels are not sufficient to enable ppm level gas detection. Making the measurement over\n13\na narrow spectral range (\u0394\u03bb = \u00b10.025 nm for WMS with methane at 1651 nm) would improve the signal :\nnoise ratio by up to a factor of 104, depending on the surface properties.\nTo achieve this potential, it is therefore important that the diffuse surface is chosen carefully, and that the\nspeckle field does not move substantially between, for example, intensity measurements taken at each side\nof the absorption line. The same issue exists for measurements in conventional cells; where vibrations are\npresent, modulation frequencies should ideally be greater than the frequency of mechanical vibration so\nthat the baseline remains stable during a single scan or wavelength modulation cycle.\nObjective speckle uncertainty can be reduced by the use of a large detector and large illuminated area.\nWhen a lens is used to collect light (subjective speckle), the level of associated speckle uncertainty can be\nreduced using a high NA lens, which also improves the light collection efficiency. The speckle size is then\nindependent of illumination geometry, which has advantages for measurements made in locations where\nthe backscattering surface is difficult to control (for example, using backscatter laser pointers).\n4 Experimental details\nWe employed WMS at f = 6 kHz with second harmonic (2f) detection at 12 kHz. Figure 6 shows a\nschematic diagram of our laser diode modulation and detection apparatus, in this case configured for use\nwith our transmissive gas cell design. A sinusoidal signal at 6 kHz from a signal generator (Hewlett\nPackard HP33120A) was applied to the laser controller (ILX Lightwave, ILX LDC-3722B) to give an\namplitude at the laser diode of 24mA (peak to peak). Our DFB laser diode package (Semelab Ltd)\nincorporated a 1651 nm laser (NEL NLK1U5C1CA-TS) collimated with an aspheric lens (Lightpath\n350230D). Gross wavelength tuning was achieved by controlling the diode temperature using a Peltier\nelement within the package.\n14\nFigure 6. Schematic experimental configuration for 2f wavelength modulation spectroscopy, using a 3f\nline lock.\nA proportion of the laser beam (~8%) was sampled by a pellicle beamsplitter (Thorlabs BP208) to a gas\nreference cell (PD3 in Figure 6) consisting of a Ge detector at the bottom of a TO18 can containing 100%\nmethane, giving an effective pathlength of 5.3mm. We would wish to avoid the use of such beamsplitters\nin field applications, for example by using a partial reflection from a window or from the diffuser, or by\nusing a proportion of the transmitted beam. However, for these experiments the use of beamsplitters\npermitted simpler comparison of different cell geometries. The signal from the photodiode was\ndemodulated at 3f using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford SR850) to provide an error signal which was fed,\nvia a PID (proportional, integrative, derivative) controller to the laser controller, controlling the dc current\nof the laser diode so as to lock the emission wavelength to the gas absorption line centre. In our standard\nWMS experiments, the laser emission was thus actively locked and we did not perform a simultaneous\nwavelength scan. However, in some experiments the lock was not used and a simultaneous slow\nwavelength scan through the gas absorption line was performed in order to observe the 2f-demodulated\nspectrum.\nThe laser beam striking the optical diffuser had a diameter of approximately 8mm. A proportion of the\nforward scattered light fell onto the detector \/ amplifier (PD1: Thorlabs, PDA50EC, 1mm diameter) after\nmaking a single pass across the cell. A lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR850, time\nconstant \u03c4 = 1s) was used for 2f demodulation, its output voltage (X, in X,Y mode) sampled using a data\nDFB laser\nlaser\ncontroller\nsine\ngenerator\n3f lock-in\namp amp\nPD2\nPID\ncircuit\n\u03a3\ngas cell\namp\nPD1\n2f lock-in amp\nDMM\namp\n2f lock-in amp\nDMM\nPD3\n15\nacquisition card and transferred to a computer running LabviewTM software, through a data acquisition\ncard (National Instruments PCI 6259). The DC signal from PD1 was sampled using a digital multimeter\n(DMM, Keithley 195A) before also being passed to the PC for data processing. Monitoring the DC level\nallowed us to normalise the 2f-demodulated signals to compare results between different optical diffusers,\neach of which could project a different level of light onto PD1. A second detector amplifier (PD2 in\nFigure 6) was used to measure a proportion (approximately 45%) of the incident beam intensity via a\nbeamsplitter (Thorlabs BP245B3). This reference detector channel employed the same model of detector \/\namplifier, lock-in amplifier and DMM, with the same set-ups, as the main signal channel from PD1. Both\nthe sample cell and the reference detector PD2 were angled slightly (around 10\u00b0) with respect to the\noptical path.\nTest gases were fed to the gas cell from certified cylinders (Scott Specialty Gases), one containing\nhydrocarbon (HC) free air and the other containing either 1010 ppm or 50.1 ppm methane in HC free air.\nA bank of mass flow controllers (Teledyne Hastings HFC-302 with THPS-400 controller) was used to\ncontrol flow rates from the two cylinders, with downstream mixing generating different concentrations in\nthe range 0-1010 ppm.\n5 Results\nWe tested the chosen geometry of section 3, namely cell 5: a simple transmission cell design in which\nlight from the laser diode passed through an optical diffusive element, which scattered the light mainly in\nthe forward direction. A proportion of the light fell onto a 1mm diameter photodiode after making a single\npass across a 100mm gas cell. For the purpose of comparison, we also tested a conventional transmission\ncell of the same length, employing two wedged and anti-reflection coated windows.\n5.1 Choice of materials\nDifferent types of diffusely transmitting materials were investigated. Their relative levels of transmission\nwere compared for a 1mm detector placed at a distance of 100mm, and we observed the form of the\nscattered light pattern that they produced. The results are shown in Table 4.\n16\nTable 4.

The mean surface height deviation is uncertain but\nexpected to be at or below 12.6 \u03bcm, as the ISO specification for 1500 grit refers to abrasion by particles\nwith a mean diameter of 12.6 \u03bcm. For a material of refractive index 1.5, this gives a mean optical\npathlength difference h < 6m for a transmitter, and we would expect the improvement in noise level\ncalculated using equation (8) to be less than or equal to a factor of 2.8\uf0b4104.\n5.2 Gas absorption measurements with a diffuse cell\nThe transmission cell was built using a 1500 grit ground glass window (Thorlabs DG10-1500) and 100mm\nlength, with a detector \/ amplifier (Thorlabs, PDA50EC) integrated into the end so as to avoid the use of\nadditional windows. The only factor to be considered during alignment was to misalign the Fresnel\nreflection from the front (smooth) surface of the diffuser plate, therefore the process was very quick\n(<1min). A separation of over 1 metre between the laser diode and the cell ensured that self-mixing\ninterference effects were minimised. The output was recorded for 2nd harmonic WMS with a 3f line lock\nwhile a series of gas mixtures of different concentrations was passed through the cell. For each\nconcentration point, zero data were recorded before and after (over a total time period of approximately 6\nminutes) in order to remove any effects of drift. Figure 7 shows the results; a short-term noise equivalent\nabsorbance (NEA) of 2\u00d710-5 is estimated, corresponding to around 5ppm methane (1\u03c3).\n17\nFigure 7. 2f \u2013 demodulated signals versus gas concentration for cell using a transmissive optical diffuser.\n2f signals have been normalised by dividing by the measured DC signal, and the dashed line shows a\nlinear response.\n5.3 Assessment of drift\nThe level of system drift was assessed by continuously recording data (with no gas in the cell) over a 22\nhour period, for both the signal channel PD1 and the reference channel PD2. Allan variance plots (\u03c32 as\ndefined by Werle et al.[29]) were calculated for the recorded 2f measurements for each channel, using data\nnormalised by division by the DC signals. These plots are shown in Figure 8 and describe a system\ndominated by drift. Despite the use of normalised data for both channels, the Allan variance seems to be a\nfactor of 3-10 times more pronounced on the reference channel than the signal channel. The drift on the\nsignal seems to be bounded at a mean value (\u0148(\u03c32)) of an NEA of 3\u00d710-4, and at a value of 7 \u00d7 10-4 on the\nreference channel. Because of the high level of drift on the reference channel, we cannot associate the drift\non the signal channel with the use of the diffuse optical cell alone, rather this data puts an upper limit on\nwhat the effect of the cell might be. The worst measured value of \u0148(\u03c32) corresponds to a concentration of\naround 70 ppm, using Figure 7.\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n1 10 100 1000\nconcentration \/ ppm\nno\nrm\nal\nis\ned\n2f\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/V\n.V\n-1\n18\nFigure 8. Allan variance plot for normalised 2f time series data taken over a 22 hour period with an empty\ncell.\nThe data is consistent with an interference effect; interference fringes have finite extent and would limit\ndrift to a maximum value. We are aware of interference fringes in our laser diode output with a wide FSR,\nwhich cause instabilities similar to those seen on the reference channel. It is curious however that the\nAllan variance for the signal channel PD1 was consistently lower than that for the reference channel PD2,\ndespite both these measurements being normalised (2f measurement \/ DC measurement) and using\nidentical apparatus. We were hoping to use the reference channel to correct for instabilities in the laser\ndiode output, but this was not possible as the outputs from PD1 and PD2 were uncorrelated. Further work\nis needed to investigate the source of the drift in our system. Two additional effects may be present; (i) our\npellicle beamsplitter may suffer from low frequency movement, which would affect the reflected\nreference beam more than the transmitted signal beam, and (ii) the signal channel may be measuring over\na wider and more representative sample of the emitted laser beam than our reference channel.\n5.4 Summary of results with transmissive cell\nWe consider speckle uncertainty on the detector to determine the fundamental limit of detection of this\ncell design. It would be improved however by the use of a more divergent illumination of the ground glass\nplate and \/ or the use of a high NA lens to collect light onto the photodiode. In our experiments, we have\nestablished a short-term (6 minute) limit of detection of around 5 ppm, in a system dominated by drift.\n1 10 100 103 104 105\n10-13\n10-12\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\naveraging period \/ sec\nA\nlla\nn\nva\nria\nnc\ne\n\u03c3\n2\n\/(\nV\n.V\n-1\n)2\nsignal channel (PD1)\nreference channel\n(PD2)\n19\nFor a spectral scan of \u0394\u03bb = 0.025 nm, beam diameter d = 8 mm, distance to detector z = 100 mm, detector\ndiameter D = 1 mm and surface roughness deviation h \u2521 6\u03bcm, we would expect the level of speckle\nuncertainty to be \u0394I\/I0 ~ 10-5, corresponding to an NEA for WMS of around 1.5 \u00d7 10-5. Using equation (3),\nfor a 100mm pathlength cell and absorptivity of 0.38 cm-1 at the methane line centre, this translates to a\ndetection limit of 4 ppm or below. Although this is consistent with our short-term results for gas\nconcentration measurement (an NEA of 2\u00d710-5), it is not known to what extent the spectral effect of\nspeckle was stable during these experiments.\nThe drift experiment puts an upper limit on the degree of instability of the speckle, and thereby the speckle\nuncertainty at an NEA of 3\u00d710-4. Unfortunately, our experimental platform was not itself stable and its\nperformance may have dominated these results. Work is in progress to identify and remove the remaining\ncauses of instability, which could be associated with feedback effects within the laser diode package[4], or\nby movement of our pellicle beamsplitter. The level of speckle uncertainty calculated in the absence of\nwavelength modulation (equation (6), Table 1 column 2) does not apply.\n5.5 Speckle noise reduction\nTwo methods have been tested to suppress speckle noise by rotating or vibrating the diffuser. In these\nexperiments, the speckle related intensity uncertainty was deliberately exaggerated, by using a small\ndetection aperture, so that the effectiveness of the suppression could be quantified unambiguously. For\nsimplicity the moving diffuser was placed outside a conventional gas cell, as shown in Figure 9. In both\ncases, a 1 mm thick sample of ZenithTM (proprietary PTFE, Sphere Optics) was used as a reflective\ndiffuser. We minimised the level of backscattered light returned to the laser diode by using a large angle\nof incidence and by placing the laser diode at a distance of over 1 m from the diffuser.\n20\nFigure 9. Experimental configuration for speckle noise suppression using moving diffuse reflectors, by (a)\nrotation of a motor, and (b) vibration of a loudspeaker.\nThe speckle size was exaggerated by increasing the distance z between the diffuser and the detector to\naround 600mm. The laser drive current was ramped over the range 35-70mA in steps of 0.2mA, while 2f-\ndemodulated detector output was recorded. In the first experiment we compared a stationary and rotating\ndiffuser, the latter consisting of a 36mm diameter, 1 mm thick disc of SpectralonTM rotated at a frequency\nof 1kHz using the motor from an optical chopper. A lock-in time constant of \u03c4 = 100ms was used to allow\nscans to be completed within a reasonable time period. Scans were taken with the cell evacuated and also\nwith the cell filled with 1.25% methane at atmospheric pressure. The resulting 2f-demodulated gas signals\nare illustrated in Figure 10 and show a large reduction in the received noise level when the diffuser was\nrotating.\nmounted\ndiffuser\nmotor\ncontrol\nz\namp\nPD1\nincident\nbeamsignalgenerator\n(a)\n(b)\n21\nFigure 10. Speckle noise reduction achieved by rotating a diffuser. 2f-demodulated WMS scans of (a) HC\nfree air, and (b) methane at a concentration of 1.25% vol. An exaggerated level of speckle noise was used\nto demonstrate the effect.\nWithin one measurement integration period of 1s, we expect to have averaged over the entire rotation of\nthe diffuser, which for an 8 mm diameter beam striking the diffuser approximately 10 mm from the centre\nof rotation gives an equivalent of 8 independent speckle fields, which we would expect to yield an\nimprovement in the noise level of \u221a8 = 2.8. A quantitative analysis of the results in Figure 10 yields an\nimprovement factor of 13, which is much greater. It is possible that additional speckle averaging was\nprovided by imperfect alignment and diffuser wobble, giving a larger number of independent speckle\npatterns and a greater degree of suppression.\nIn a second experiment, we glued the diffuser (36mm diameter) to a loudspeaker diaphragm (Goldstar\n541-861B, 3.2\u03a9, 0.4W). The loudspeaker was driven using an audio amplifier (Sanyo audio amp LA4597)\nwith a 200 Hz sine wave, the amplitude adjusted manually using the amplifier\u2019s volume control (gain) to\nminimise ripple on the detector output. Vibrating the diffuser resulted in an observable reduction in\nspeckle contrast, however the resulting amplitude of vibration is unknown.

An exaggerated level of speckle noise was used\nto demonstrate the effect.\n6 Discussion and conclusions\nWe have analysed a number of factors affecting cell performance when optical diffusers are used instead\nof conventional, smooth windows or mirrors. Self-mixing or feedback interference can be performance\nlimiting for both conventional and diffuse cells, but can be difficult to avoid in the latter, especially when\ndiffuse reflectors are used. Our laser diode, which employed a relatively large (5 mm diameter)\ncollimating lens for the purpose of our experiments, was particularly susceptible to this interference effect.\nTo ensure that it did not affect our measurements, we used a large separation between the laser diode and\nthe cell, but a more practical solution would be needed for field instruments. This could include a smaller\nlaser diode aperture, better optimised cell design and the use of an isolator.\nInterferometric speckle in diffuse gas cells is the direct analogue of etalon-induced interference fringes in\nconventional cells and therefore needs to be removed. We have found in practice that it has not presented\na problem and that its removal is simpler than for conventional cells, since the number of specular\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\nvibrating\ndiffuser\nstationary\ndiffuser\n2f\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/m\nV\n35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70\nCurrent \/ mA\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\nvibrating diffuser\nstationary diffuser2\nfs\nig\nna\nl\/\nm\nV\n23\nreflections from optical surfaces is reduced. Our chosen diffuse cell, with a transmission design, also\nminimises the possibility of generating a specular reference beam that can interfere with the speckle field.\nRandom laser speckle is believed to be a fundamental, performance-limiting effect for the diffuse optics\nthat we have used. To gain the benefits of optical diffusers requires surface roughness that is comparable\nwith the illumination wavelength, therefore speckle fields will be well-developed with high contrast. We\nhave calculated the resulting speckle uncertainty for absolute measurements of light transmission, and for\nself-referenced measurements taken over spectral scans with a small \u0394\u03bb, by baseline subtraction or using\nWMS. According to established speckle theory, the latter should offer levels of uncertainty compatible\nwith ppm level gas detection, with \u0394I\/I0 in the range 10-2 \u2013 10-6 for our chosen 100 mm cell. The precise\ndegree of uncertainty is dependent on the equivalent surface roughness of the optical diffuser. While this\nmay be determined for simple, singly scattering materials such as the ground glass used in our chosen\ndesign, its value is unknown for multiply scattering bulk reflectors such as SpectralonTM and ZenithTM\nPTFE. It is also possible that multiple scattering in such materials will reduce uncertainty further through\ndepolarisation[25].\nCells employing optical diffusers are simpler to align than standard cells. With careful design, the level of\nuncertainty determined by speckle on the detector was estimated for our system to give an NEA for WMS\nof around 1.5 \u00d7 10-5. Our short-term experimental results are consistent with this, showing a short-term\nNEA (1\u03c3) of 2\u00d710-5, but longer term drift of up to 3\u00d710-4 over several hours. There may be additional\nsources of drift in our system that require further attention. We have also demonstrated two methods to\nreduce speckle uncertainty by a factor of 10 or more, based on vibration or rotation of the diffuser. These\nare analogous to the use of dithered optical window or spoiler plates in conventional cells, to reduce the\nvisibility of interference fringes.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out under an EPSRC research grant (GR\/T04601\/01).
