The predicted masses for our black\nhole seeds enable the comfortable assembly of 109-M\u0003 black holes powering the luminous\nquasars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z = 6 for a concordance cosmology.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 black hole physics \u2013 hydrodynamics \u2013 instabilities \u2013\ngalaxies: formation \u2013 cosmology: theory.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe local demography of black holes at the centres of galaxies sug-\ngests that black hole formation is a generic feature of galaxy forma-\ntion (Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Tremaine\net al. 2002). Mergers and accretion processes, in fact, merger-\ninduced accretion are implicated in the assembly of black holes\n(Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Volonteri, Haardt & Madau 2003;\nDi Matteo, Springel & Hernquist 2005). However, all models require\nthe formation of seed black holes at high redshift. The inferred large\nmasses (MBH \u223c 109 M\u0003) of the black holes powering luminous\nquasars at z \u223c 6 detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\noffer a challenge to mechanisms for the production of seed black\nholes at higher redshifts (Fan et al. 2004). In a \u0003 cold dark mat-\nter (\u0003CDM) cosmology, these black holes have to assemble such\n\u0002E-mail: giuseppe@ast.cam.ac.uk\nlarge masses within a Gyr. The popular picture is that the remnants\nof the first generation of metal-free stars that form with an initial\nmass function that is biased towards higher masses (Abel, Bryan &\nNorman 2000; Bromm, Coppi & Larson 2002) provide the initial\nseed black holes with masses of the order of 10\u2013100 M\u0003 (Madau &\nRees 2001; Volonteri et al. 2003; Ricotti & Ostriker 2004; Mapelli,\nFerrara & Rea 2006). Growing these seeds to the requisite masses by\nz = 6 to match the abundance of observed SDSS quasars requires\nvarious kinds of fine-tuning including phases of maximal growth\npowered by super-Eddington accretion. Volonteri & Rees (2005)\nconsidered the growth of black holes in metal-free haloes with T >\n104 K that cool via atomic hydrogen lines, leading to the formation\nof a fat, gas disc. They argued that an episode of super-Eddington\naccretion assembles black holes with masses of 106 M\u0003 at z \u223c\n15\u201320.\nThere are alternative models that predict the direct formation of\nmore-massive seeds with masses of about 105 M\u0003.

The key limiting\nfactor for these models is the disposal of the angular momentum.\nOne approach taken by Eisenstein & Loeb (1995) and Koushiap-\npas et al. (2004) is to argue that it is preferentially either low-spin\nhaloes with consequently low angular momentum gas, or the low-\nspin tail of the gas distribution in haloes that can cool efficiently,\nthat form these seeds. Significant transfer of angular momentum\nis still required to go from the central massive object to the final\ncollapsed hole that is expected to occur via the post-Newtonian in-\nstability. Non-axisymmetric structures like bars have been proposed\n(Shlosman, Begelman & Frank 1990) to efficiently transfer angu-\nlar momentum at these late stages. In a recent paper, Begelman\net al. (2006) have pursued this picture and argued that a low specific\nentropy \u2018quasi-star\u2019 is produced as a result of the cascade of the\nbars-within-bars instability leading to the formation of a black hole\nof a few solar masses.\nIn this paper, we argue for the formation of more massive black\nhole seeds (\u223c105 M\u0003) from gas cooling in primordial haloes via\nthe growth of gravitational instabilities. We offer a picture wherein\naccretion processes and fragmentation criteria are addressed in a\ncoupled fashion. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec-\ntion 2, we outline the scenario for pre-galactic disc formation in\ndark matter haloes and discuss their accretion properties; the frag-\nmentation criteria which determine the fate of the gas are discussed\nin Section 3 and the implied mass distribution of central concen-\ntrations is derived in Section 4. Detailed time-dependent models\nthat confirm the analytic calculations in the previous sections are\npresented in Section 5; the resultant luminosity and potential ob-\nservability of these sources are discussed in Section 6 followed by\na discussion and implications of our work.\n2 P R E - G A L AC T I C D I S C F O R M AT I O N\nIn the context of the hierarchical, cold dark matter dominated struc-\nture formation paradigm, the baryonic components of galaxies as-\nsemble upon dissipation within dark matter haloes. Generic to these\nmodels is the assembly of discs in these haloes as a consequence of\ndissipational collapse of the baryons (White & Rees 1978; Fall &\nEfstathiou 1980; Dalcanton, Spergel & Summers 1997; Mo, Mao\n& White 1998). Here, we revisit some of the standard arguments\nput forward to describe the formation of protogalactic discs inside\na spherical dark matter halo of mass M. In particular, we adopt the\nformalism developed by Mo et al. (1998), and extend it to include\nthe effect of angular momentum redistribution and mass accretion\ndue to gravitational instabilities in the gas disc.\nThe arguments that form the basis of the standard disc formation\npicture are simple and elegant. It is assumed that a fraction md of the\ntotal mass of the halo, containing a fraction jd of the angular momen-\ntum of the halo (usually assumed to be equal to md), collapses and\nforms a disc. Note that the baryonic mass in the halo is assumed to\nbe a fixed fraction of the halo mass, and the proportionality factor is\ntaken to be the universal baryon fraction fb. Assuming a radial profile\nfor the resultant gas density distribution in the disc (e.g. exponen-\ntial) enables the calculation of its key physical properties: the disc\nscalelength, central surface mass density, and crucially its stability\nunder self-gravity. Star formation is then assumed to occur for those\ndiscs that are gravitationally unstable. The results of earlier work\nbased on this paradigm depend on the detailed assumptions made.\nFor example, while Mo et al. (1998) considered both an isothermal\nsphere and an NFW (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997) profile for the\ndark matter halo and a global criterion for gravitational instability,\nOh & Haiman (2002) considered an NFW (Navarro et al. 1997) halo\nand a local instability criterion, based on the Toomre Q parameter.\nThese treatments present \u2018static\u2019 models for disc assembly. In this\nwork, we examine the fate of these pre-galactic discs, taking their\ntime-dependent evolution into account.\nThe limitation of previous analyses is that they considered the\nproperties of the discs a posteriori, after all of their mass has been\nassembled, and did not consider the evolution of the discs during\ntheir formation process. They have argued that for some values of\nthe relevant halo parameters, in particular, for low values of the spin\nparameter of the halo\u03bb,1 the disc can be self-gravitating. In principle,\nthese analyses also allow the disc to have very low values of Q, or\nequivalently, to be strongly unstable in terms of a stability criterion.\nHowever, it is important to note here that as soon as the disc becomes\nmassive enough to be marginally stable, it will develop structures\nthat will redistribute angular momentum and mass through the disc,\npreventing the surface density from becoming too large and the disc\nfrom becoming too unstable. A suggestion that this kind of matter\nredistribution in primordial discs can lead to the formation of seed\nblack holes was made recently by Begelman et al. (2006) and also,\npreviously, by Koushiappas et al. (2004) but using substantially\ndifferent arguments compared to our work here. In practice, the\naccretion of matter to the centre will stop as soon as the surface\ndensity becomes low enough to make the disc stable, so that in the\nfinal state the disc will be exactly marginally stable. We explore this\nscenario and the consequences of angular momentum redistribution\nin detail here. In this section, we propose some simple arguments\nthat allow us to estimate the final disc mass and the mass that will\nflow into the central region, leading to the formation and growth of\na seed black hole. In Section 5, we support these simple arguments\nwith full time-dependent calculations. We are therefore able to keep\na detailed, self-consistent inventory of the fate of the gas.\nWe assume that in the final configuration, once the pre-galactic\ndisc has assembled in the dark matter halo, only a fraction mf of the\ntotal halo mass is retained in the disc (note that we track the baryons\nthat remain in the disc and those that are accreted towards the centre\nseparately), while the remainder ma = md \u2212 mf is accreted towards\nthe centre of the galaxy, providing fuel for a growing black hole. The\nfinal angular momentum of the disc, however, remains equal to the\ninitial value jd, since, in any accretion process, angular momentum\nis transported outwards, and the only loss of angular momentum due\nto accretion is related to the advection of it out of the inner radius of\nthe disc. For an isothermal dark matter halo, \u03c1(r) \u221d 1\/r2 with a flat\nrotation curve; the angular momentum advected inwards due to the\naccretion of a mass ma is ja \u223c jd Rin\/Rd \u0007 jd (here Rin and Rd are the\ninner and outer radius of the disc, respectively). It is assumed here\nthat the disc is embedded in a spherical, isothermal, dark matter halo,\nwith virial temperature, Tvir, and a constant rotational velocity, Vh.\nTo evaluate the stability of the disc, we use the Toomre parameter\nQ which is defined as\nQ = cs\u03ba\n\u03c0G\u0007\n=\n\u221a\n2\ncsVh\n\u03c0G\u0007R\n, (1)\nwhere cs is the sound speed, \u03ba =\n\u221a\n2Vh\/R is the epicyclic frequency,\nR is the cylindrical radial coordinate, and \u0007 is the surface mass\n1 The spin parameter \u03bb of a dark matter halo is defined as \u03bb =\nJ |E|1\/2\/G M5\/2, where J is the angular momentum of the halo, E its to-\ntal energy and M the halo mass.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

We consider here the earliest generations of\ndiscs, which have not been metal-enriched and therefore are able to\ncool only through hydrogen. We present in Appendix A the detailed\nstructure of these discs. Here we note that, in thermal equilibrium, if\nmolecular hydrogen formation is inhibited, these discs are expected\nto be nearly isothermal at a temperature of a few thousand K. If\nmolecular hydrogen is present, however, the disc can become much\ncolder, with a temperature of a few hundred K. A marginally stable,\nisothermal disc has the same surface density profile as a Mestel disc\n(Mestel 1963). We therefore assume that\n\u0007(R) = \u00070\n(\nR\nRd\n)\u22121\n. (2)\nDark matter haloes are characterized by their mass M and their\nangular momentum J, or equivalently by their spin parameter \u03bb.\nThe distribution of spin parameters for cold dark matter haloes as\ndetermined from cosmological N-body simulations is given by\np(\u03bb) d\u03bb = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03bb\nexp\n[\n\u2212 ln\n2(\u03bb\/ \u00af\u03bb)\n2\u03c3\u03bb\n]\nd\u03bb\n\u03bb\n, (3)\nwhere the mean spin \u00af\u03bb = 0.05 and the dispersion is \u03c3\u03bb = 0.5\n(Warren et al. 1992). Requiring that the mass of the gas disc is a\nfraction (md \u2212 ma) of the halo mass and that its angular momentum\nis a fraction jd of the halo, following Mo et al. (1998) we easily get\nRd = 2\n\u221a\n2\u03bb\n( jd\nmd\n)\n1\n1 \u2212 ma\/md r200, (4)\n\u00070 = 1016\u03c0\nmd\n\u03bb2\n(\nmd\njd\n)2\n(\n1 \u2212 ma\nmd\n)3 H (z)Vh\nG\n, (5)\nwhere r200 = Vh\/10 H(z) is the halo virial radius (the radius within\nwhich the density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe)\nand H(z) is the Hubble constant as a function of redshift z. We can\nnow evaluate Q, given the disc temperature Tgas:\nQ = 8\nmd\n\u03bb\n( jd\nmd\n)(\nTgas\nTvir\n)1\/2 ( 1\n1 \u2212 ma\/md\n)2\n. (6)\nWe use the fact that the final disc configuration is exactly marginally\nstable, and thus obtain ma by requiring that Q = Qc, a critical value\nabove which the disc is gravitationally stable and no accretion can\ntake place, due to the lack of an angular momentum transport mech-\nanism. This gives\nma\nmd\n= 1 \u2212\n\u221a\n8\u03bb\nmd Qc\n( jd\nmd\n)(\nTgas\nTvir\n)1\/2\n. (7)\nNote that, although the result summarized in equation (7) is based\non the assumption that angular momentum is redistributed within\nthe disc, it does not depend on the specific viscosity mechanism, and\nis therefore very robust. The only assumption made is that whatever\nthis mechanism is, it is only active when the disc is gravitationally\nunstable (a very reasonable assumption for such primordial discs,\nfor which the main source of viscosity comes from gravitational in-\nstabilities). As shown, the amount of mass that will be concentrated\nin the central regions of these pre-galactic discs depends only on\nhalo properties (such as the spin parameter \u03bb and the fraction of\nbaryonic mass that collapses to the disc md), the ratio between gas\ntemperature and halo virial temperature, and on the threshold value\nof Q, which has a very small range of variation around Qc \u2248 1.\nEquation (7) then provides a powerful link between the properties\nof dark matter haloes and the mass of massive, seed black holes that\ncan grow within them. This implies a larger mass concentration in\nthe centre for haloes with low spin parameter \u03bb or with high virial\ntemperature Tvir (corresponding to higher halo mass M). The fact that\nseed black holes are likely to form preferentially in low-spin haloes\nwas also demonstrated by Eisenstein & Loeb (1995) and by Koushi-\nappas et al. (2004), using a different set of arguments. However, for\nhigh-mass haloes, there is the added possibility that the disc under-\ngoes fragmentation. We discuss the issue of fragmentation in Sec-\ntion 3 and we postpone to Section 4 the discussion of the mass dis-\ntribution of central concentrations, given the distribution of the spin\nparameter \u03bb.\n3 F R AG M E N TAT I O N C R I T E R I A\nThe arguments outlined in the previous section implicitly assume\nthat, when the disc is gravitationally unstable, it is able to redistribute\nmass and angular momentum so as to accommodate the incoming\nmass inflow from the halo, maintaining a marginally stable state.\nActually, in some cases, this is not going to be the case and the disc\nmight undergo fragmentation. The criterion for the fragmentation\nof a gravitationally unstable disc has been studied extensively in the\npast few years (especially in relation to models of planet formation).\nGammie (2001) has shown that being unstable (i.e. having Q \u0002 1) is\na necessary but not sufficient requirement for disc fragmentation. He\nhas shown that fragmentation occurs only when the cooling time is\nfaster than the disc dynamical time-scale. An equivalent fragmen-\ntation criterion, that directly relates accretion and fragmentation\nproperties, has been discussed by Rice, Lodato & Armitage (2005).\nIndeed, they have shown that the gravitationally induced stress in a\nslowly evolving thin disc cannot exceed a critical value, which mea-\nsured in terms of the standard \u03b1 description of transport properties\nof accretion disc, corresponds to \u03b1c \u2248 0.06. If the disc is required to\nprovide a larger stress, either by strong cooling or by a large mass\ninflow, it will undergo fragmentation within a dynamical time-scale.\nIn the context of pre-galactic discs that we are considering here, this\nwill then lead to efficient star formation in the disc.\nIn the case considered here, the constraints imposed by cooling\nare not important, since, due to the steepness of the cooling function\nwhen the gas is predominantly hydrogen (in either the molecular or\natomic form), slight changes in the temperature can easily bring the\ndisc into thermal equilibrium. The constraint coming from the inflow\nof mass from the halo is much more important. The mass-accretion\nrate \u02d9Mh from the halo can be simply estimated by requiring that a\nmass md M (where M = V2hr200\/G is the total halo mass) collapses\nin a free-fall time-scale tff = r200\/Vh. We therefore get\n\u02d9Mh = md V\n3\nh\nG\n.

Lodato and P. Natarajan\nWhat would happen to the transport properties in the disc once the\nfragmentation threshold is overcome is still not clear. A plausible\nassumption is that the accretion rate would be capped at its threshold\nvalue, with extra heating needed to reach thermal balance. This heat\ncould be provided by the star formation process. The disc would\nthen not be able to transfer down to its inner parts an \u02d9M larger than\n\u02d9Mmax = 2\u03b1c c\n3\ns\nG\n, (11)\nwhere \u03b1c \u2248 0.06.\nIf we consider the case of cooling via atomic hydrogen and assume\nthat Tgas \u2248 4000 K, we find that \u02d9Mmax \u2248 10\u22122 M\u0003 yr\u22121. In contrast,\nfor the cold discs arising when molecular cooling is efficient, the\nmaximum accretion rate is significantly lowered down to \u02d9Mmax \u2248\n3 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u0003 yr\u22121.\nIf the disc evolves to a steady state, one should expect that the\nmass flow in the disc would equal the inflow rate \u02d9Mh. Actually,\nas the disc builds up, only a fraction of the matter flows into the\ninner disc, since the remaining has to be transported outwards to\ntake up the angular momentum lost by inflowing material. Since the\nviscous time-scale in the outer disc is very long, even if the inner\ndisc is almost in a steady state, the inner flux \u02d9M in will still be a\nfraction of \u02d9Mh, that we will calculate explicitly in Section 5. We\nanticipate here the result that the mass flux in the inner disc is at\nmost a fraction f = (1\/2)[1 + (ma\/md)] of the total inflow of matter.\nNote that 1\/2 < f < 1, so even in the extreme case where no mass\nis accreted (i.e. ma = 0), the mass flow is only reduced by a factor\nof a half. We expect fragmentation if\n\u02d9M in = md V\n3\nh\nG\n1\n2\n(\n1 + ma\nmd\n)\n> 2\u03b1c\nc3s\nG\n. (12)\nWe can rearrange equation (12) in terms of the ratio of the virial\ntemperature to the gas temperature:\nTvir\nTgas\n>\n[\n4\u03b1c\nmd\n1\n1 + (ma\/md)\n]2\/3\n. (13)\nAssuming \u03b1c = 0.06 and md = 0.05, we can therefore identify the\nfollowing three possible behaviours.\n(i) Tvir\/Tgas \u0003 2.9: these haloes will form discs that will frag-\nment and form stars.\n(ii) 1.8 \u0002 Tvir\/Tgas \u0002 2.9: these haloes will form fragment-\ning discs only if the spin parameter is significantly low, so that\nma\/md \u223c O(1).\n(iii) Tvir\/Tgas \u0002 1.8: these haloes will not produce fragmenting\ndiscs, but since the halo mass is relatively low, the amount of mass\nthat can be concentrated in the centre will also be correspondingly\nlow (cf. equation 7).\nIn practice, whenever it happens, fragmentation will act to sup-\npress the concentration of the largest amount of mass in the centre,\nwhereas haloes with relatively smaller central concentrations are by\nand large unaffected by the fragmentation.\nThe criterion for the fragmentation described above, and the crit-\nical value of \u03b1, have been obtained in the context of thin and Ke-\nplerian discs. The haloes that give rise to large concentration of\nmass in the centre have Tvir \u0003 Tgas and therefore the discs that form\nwithin them are relatively thick. In this case, the Jeans mass in a\nfragmenting disc is only slightly smaller than the total disc mass,\nso that fragmentation might be less likely in this case than for thin\ndiscs, effectively leading to an increase of the critical value of \u03b1.\n4 M A S S D I S T R I BU T I O N O F C E N T R A L\nC O N C E N T R AT I O N S\nWe now discuss the distribution of central mass concentrations,\ngiven a distribution of halo spin parameters. We determine the dis-\ntribution of the mass available to feed a growing black hole in the\ncentre of the pre-galactic disc, MBH = ma M, based on equation (7),\nwhile the distribution of \u03bb is given by equation (3). We also need\nto specify the values of md and Qc. We assume md = 0.05, but we\nalso consider the case were md = 0.1. As customary, we take jd =\nmd (Mo et al. 1998). The critical value for the Q-parameter, Qc, is\nmore uncertain. A self-gravitating disc is marginally stable to local,\naxisymmetric instabilities at Q = 1. However, non-axisymmetric\nand global instabilities cause the disc to become unstable at larger\nvalues of Q. The prescription described above implies that at Q =\nQc the disc provides no stress, while on the other hand, Lodato &\nRice (2004, 2005) have shown that a Q = 1 disc is able to deliver\na sizeable stress. We expect Qc to be of the order of, but relatively\nlarger than, unity and therefore consider two cases: (i) Qc = 2 and\n(ii) Qc = 3.\n4.1 The case of atomic hydrogen cooling\nFirst, we consider the case when molecular hydrogen formation is\ninhibited and the gas can consequently cool down to Tgas \u2248 4000 K\nthrough atomic hydrogen cooling only (see Appendix A for details).\nAs discussed above, for a given Tgas, haloes with larger Tvir produce\nlarger central mass concentrations. However, we also have to require\nthat the disc does not fragment, which then limits the analysis to\nTvir \u0002 3Tgas \u2248 104 K. The typical redshift of collapse of haloes with\nthis virial temperature is around z \u2248 10.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the results for the two cases: Qc = 2 and 3,\nrespectively. For both cases, the haloes are assumed to be at a redshift\nz = 10 with mass in the range of 107 M\u0003. The lines refer to three\nvalues of the halo mass, M = 3 \u00d7 107 M\u0003 (solid line), M = 2 \u00d7\n107 M\u0003 (dotted line) and M = 107 M\u0003 (dashed line). While for the\ntwo lower-mass cases Tvir \u0002 1.8Tgas and according to the results of\nthe previous section, fragmentation is not expected to take place, for\nthe highest-mass case, the disc might fragment for the lowest values\nof \u03bb. The dot\u2013dashed line refers to the case where the possibility of\nfragmentation is included and in this instance, we assume that these\ndiscs simply do not produce any central mass concentration.\nIt can be seen that, especially for the Qc = 3 case a significant\nfraction of discs host central mass concentrations. For dark matter\nhaloes of mass M = 3 \u00d7 107 M\u0003, approximately 12 per cent of discs\nhave a central concentration of mass larger than 105 M\u0003, while\nthe same mass concentration can be achieved by only 6 per cent\nof discs hosted in haloes with M = 2 \u00d7 107 M\u0003. The results ob-\ntained assuming md = 0.1 for M = 107 M\u0003 (solid line) and M =\n0.7 \u00d7 107 M\u0003 (dotted line) are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases, the\npossibility of fragmentation is included, but it only affects the low-\nest spin parameter haloes, for which the probability is small to start\nwith. The two panels refer again to two different choices of Qc.\nAs expected, in this case, where a larger fraction of the halo mass\ncollapses to the disc, the fraction of gravitationally unstable discs\nis larger, resulting in a larger probability of hosting a large mass\nconcentration at the centre.\n4.2 The case of molecular hydrogen cooling\nWe now consider the case where molecular hydrogen can form and\nthe disc therefore cools down to Tgas \u2248 500 K.

Therefore, the very same central mass accumulation ma that\ncan be obtained for a 4000-K disc can be obtained for a disc with a\ntemperature ten times lower, provided that the halo virial tempera-\nture is reduced by the same amount (i.e. from Tvir \u2248 104 to \u2248103).\nThe typical redshift for the collapse of such haloes is z \u223c 20, higher\nthan the z \u223c 10 assumed above. Since the halo mass scales as M\n\u221d T3\/2vir (1 + z)\u22123\/2, the same results shown in Figs 1 and 2 would\nstill hold for a Tgas \u2248 500 K disc, provided that the mass scale (of\nboth the halo and the central mass) is reduced by a factor of \u223c100.\nThe typical mass of a central concentration in this case is of the\norder of 103 M\u0003. Our proposed mechanism might therefore also\nbe relevant to the conditions just prior to the formation of the first\nstars.\n5 T I M E - D E P E N D E N T M O D E L S\nIn this section, we develop some time-dependent models to confirm\nthe results obtained with the simple estimates in previous sections.\nThe evolution of the surface density \u0007 in a viscous disc with a flat\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

It is then convenient to adopt the simple prescription\nfor viscosity induced by gravitational instability described by Lin\n& Pringle (1990):\n\u03bd = \u03b1gcs H = \u03b1g c\n3\ns\n\u03c0G\u0007\n, (15)\nwhere \u03b1g, the stress provided by gravitational instabilities, is mod-\nelled as\n\u03b1g = \u03b7\n( Q2c\nQ2 \u2212 1\n)\n(16)\nwhen Q < Qc, and vanishes otherwise. In the previous equation,\nQc is a critical value of Q, below which gravitational instabilities\nare able to provide a stress in the disc, and \u03b7 is a parameter that\nessentially determines how far from the critical value of Q the disc\nhas to be in order to deliver a given stress. In practice, the general\nbehaviour of such discs is that they attain a given value of Q, such\nthat the stress provided through \u03b1g is the value required to pass on\nthe incoming flux \u02d9\u0007in. Modifying the value of \u03b7 merely changes the\nequilibrium value of Q at which this stress is provided. Effectively,\napart from small changes to the normalization of \u0007, the specific\nvalue of \u03b7 does not affect our results, therefore confirming that the\nfinal state of the disc and the central accumulation of matter does\nnot depend on the specific viscosity mechanism. We have generally\nchosen \u03b7 = 0.1, but have also explored other values and do not note\nany appreciable difference.\nThe mass input is modelled in such a way that the accretion\nrate from the baryons contained in the halo on to the disc \u02d9Mh =\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u02d9\u0007in R dR is given by equation (8) for t < tff = r200\/Vh and\nvanishes for t > tff. In this way, the total mass accreted on to the\ndisc is a fraction md of the halo mass.

The right-hand panels show the time-evolution of the disc mass\n(solid line) and of the total mass accreted from the halo (dot\u2013dashed\nline). The fraction of halo mass accreted in the centre at the end of\nthe simulation was ma \u2248 0.006 88 for the \u03b4-function case and ma \u2248\n0.0073 for the exponential case, in very good agreement with the\nsimple estimates obtained from equation (7).\nA comparison of the evolution of disc mass for two cases with\ndifferent values of \u03bb = 0.02 (black line) and \u03bb = 0.01 (dashed line)\nis shown in Fig. 5. The other parameters were set as before and the\nmass input function was a \u03b4-function. The accreted mass at the end\nof the simulation with \u03bb = 0.01 is ma = 0.019, once again in very\ngood agreement with equation (7).\nAn interesting feature that appears from these time-dependent\nmodels is the value of the viscosity parameter \u03b1g during the simula-\ntion. If the disc were to deliver a steady mass-accretion rate of \u02d9Mh, as\ngiven by equation (8), it would require an \u03b1g = md\/2(Vh\/cs)3 \u2248 0.07\nfor the chosen parameters (comparing equation 8 with equation 10).\nHowever, since the system is not in a steady state, the actual value\nof \u03b1g needed to provide the required mass flux is actually lower,\npeaking at roughly \u03b1g \u2248 0.04. This is quite important to determine\nwhether we expect the disc to fragment and form stars or not. As de-\nscribed earlier, we expect fragmentation whenever the stress needed\nto transport the mass flux through the disc is larger than a threshold\nvalue \u03b1c \u2248 0.06. With the parameters chosen above, that requires\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.07, we would then expect fragmentation, whereas, in fact, an\nevolving disc will always have a lower effective value of \u03b1 and is\ntherefore not expected to fragment.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

Of course, this will leave an unbalanced\nmass flux in the outer disc that will lead to an increase of Rd. This,\nhowever, happens on a very long time-scale, especially since the\nviscosity in the outer disc becomes very small. Using equation (4)\nto obtain the outer disc radius and assuming R0 =\n\u221a\n2\u03bbr200, we\nobtain\nf =\n(\n1 \u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03bbr200\nRd\n)\n= 1\n2\n(\n1 + ma\nmd\n)\n, (17)\nwhere we have also assumed jd = md.

Our model will\nnot be valid in the innermost parts of the disc, where the influence\nof a growing black hole will become important.

Lodato and P. Natarajan\nNote that, while, in principle, equation (21) would tell us that\nlarger values of Vh would provide a much larger luminosity, this\nis actually unlikely, since for larger Vh the disc would efficiently\nfragment into stars rather than accrete at a higher rate, as discussed\nabove. We therefore argue that the accretion luminosity in these discs\nis unlikely to exceed the estimate above. Since the gas cools mainly\nthrough atomic hydrogen line emission, most of this luminosity\nwill be emitted in the Lyman series and, in particular, in Lyman\n\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1).\nIn fact, most of the luminosity of the system will be released\nin the inner disc, as the matter falls to the bottom of the potential\nwell to ultimately form and feed the growing black hole. A detailed\ndescription of this process is beyond the scope of this paper and\nhas been discussed elsewhere (Volonteri & Rees 2005; Begelman\net al. 2006). Indeed, the accretion rate on to the black hole or on\nto the \u2018quasi-star\u2019 described in such models is one of their input\nparameters. This parameter can be computed self-consistently in a\ntime-dependent way based on our calculation presented in Section 5.\nThe results are shown in Figs 3 and 6. The upper panels of Figs 3 and\n6 show the time-evolution of the mass of the growing central object,\nMBH. The middle panels show the evolution of the mass-accretion\nrate on to it (solid line) and the corresponding Eddington rate for\na black hole of mass MBH with an efficiency of matter\u2013luminosity\nconversion set equal to 0.1. As can be seen the initial phases are\ncharacterized by a strongly super-Eddington accretion phase (as\nexpected, and as predicted by Volonteri & Rees 2005; Begelman\net al. 2006). At later times, however, as the mass of the central\nobject grows to reach roughly its asymptotic value, the accretion\nrate decreases, becoming sub-Eddington when the black hole has\na mass of roughly 8 \u00d7 104 M\u0003 in this case. The bottom plot in\neach figure shows the luminosity expected to be radiated from such\na system, assuming that during the early super-Eddington phase\nthe output luminosity is still limited by the Eddington value, while\n0.5 1 1.5 2\n0\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.5 1 1.5 2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0.5 1 1.5 2\n0\n2\n4\nFigure 6.

The\nbest strategy for detecting these objects is to exploit their lensing\nby foreground clusters. Using massive, foreground cluster-lenses as\ngravitational telescopes, we can expect to detect highly magnified\npre-galactic discs. Therefore, a survey through cluster lenses by the\nJWST is likely to be the most viable detection strategy.\n7 D I S C U S S I O N A N D C O N C L U S I O N S\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that massive central concentrations can\nform naturally from pre-galactic discs that assemble in dark matter\nhaloes at high redshift. The masses of these concentrations depend\non key properties of the host halo: mass, spin and gas cooling in\nthe halo. In particular, low-spin haloes and massive haloes are most\nefficient in concentrating gas in their centres. However, not all haloes\nwill be able to accrete gas into their centres. Taking into account\nthe possibility of fragmentation further restricts the formation of\neventual seed black holes. Using simple stability criteria, we predict\nthat fragmentation and subsequent star formation are the fate for gas\nin some fraction of haloes. We derive three interesting regimes that\nare determined by the ratio of Tvir\/Tgas: (i) if this ratio is greater\nthan 2.9, haloes will form discs that will fragment and form stars\nand not directly form black holes; (ii) if this ratio lies between 1.8 and\n2.9, haloes with low spin will lead to central mass concentrations;\nhowever, the lowest-spin cases might be affected by fragmentation;\nand (iii) if this ratio is lower than 1.8, the haloes will not produce\nfragmenting discs but will successfully accrete gas in their centres.\nCalculating the accretion rates for the fate of the accumulated gas,\nwe find super-Eddington rates leading to eventual black holes of\nmasses up to 105 M\u0003.\nThe model proposed here has two important predecessors in the\nwork of Eisenstein & Loeb (1995) and in that of Koushiappas et al.\n(2004), but also presents significant differences with respect to both\nof them. Primordial gas acquires angular momentum through tidal\ninteraction with the surrounding (Peebles 1969). This is generally\nmeasured through the parameter \u03bb, the distribution of which can be\ndetermined from numerical simulations (Warren et al. 1992). Thus,\nthe centrifugal barrier is the main obstacle to the formation of any\ncompact object in the centre of primordial galaxies. It is therefore\nnot surprising that all models (including our own) predict that the\nmost favourable sites for black hole formation are haloes with low\nspin. It is also not surprising that any black hole formation model\nhas to deal with the problem of angular momentum removal. This\nissue was tackled in the work of Eisenstein & Loeb (1995), who\ncalculated the viscous time-scale for primordial thin discs and as-\nsumed that black hole formation would only occur when the discs\nare so compact that their viscous time-scale is less than the typi-\ncal time-scale for star formation. They found that only very rare\nhaloes, with \u03bb smaller by at least a factor of 30 with respect to the\naverage spin, would be able to produce black holes. This is substan-\ntially different from what we find here. Indeed, we find that even\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

There are two main aspects with respect to which\nour model differs substantially from Eisenstein & Loeb (1995). The\nfirst one is the nature of the viscosity mechanism. Eisenstein &\nLoeb (1995) explicitly neglected the contribution of gravitational\ninstabilities and assumed that viscosity is driven by \u2018turbulence\u2019. In\nstandard accretion discs, turbulence is thought to arise from mag-\nnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instabilities (Balbus & Hawley 1998).\nHowever, for such primordial discs, where the primordial magnetic\nfield is very weak and the gas is predominantly atomic or molec-\nular, it is unlikely that MHD instabilities would be dynamically\nimportant. The second and most important difference is that Eisen-\nstein & Loeb (1995) considered relatively thin discs, with aspect\nratio H\/R \u2248 0.03, whereas our discs are substantially thicker. Since\nthe viscous time-scale is proportional to (H\/R)\u22122, this means that\nthe viscous time-scale as estimated by Eisenstein & Loeb (1995)\nis much larger than that in our case. This, in turn, is what leads to\ntheir more pessimistic estimate of the rarity of black hole forming\nhaloes. Finally, a significant difference between our model and that\nof Eisenstein & Loeb (1995) is that our model naturally leads to a\nrobust determination of the seed black hole mass function.\nKoushiappas et al. (2004) proposed that black hole seeds with\nmasses of the order of 105 M\u0003 (i.e. very similar to those obtained\nhere) can form out of low angular momentum material in massive\nhaloes. They assumed that the lowest angular momentum mate-\nrial within the halo forms a compact disc which is gravitationally\nunstable and accretes on to the centre due to the effect of an ef-\nfective viscosity driven by the instability, in a way similar to what\nwe propose here. However, they do not consider self-consistently\nthe evolution of the surface density profile induced by the assumed\nviscosity mechanism. In their picture, the disc surface density sim-\nply grows linearly with time (at the same rate, independent of the\nradius), and at any given time it reflects the original angular momen-\ntum distribution of the gaseous component of the halo. In contrast,\nwhat determines the surface density profile is actually the viscos-\nity mechanism (which, being related to gravitational instabilities, in\nturn, only depends on Q). As we have shown in Section 5 (Figs 3\nand 4), where we numerically follow the evolution of such discs,\nthe final \u0007 profile (and the total accreted mass ma) is the same\nwhether we add mass to the disc with an exponential profile or with\na \u03b4-function, representing two extreme cases in the original angular\nmomentum distribution within the halo. As a consequence of this,\nthe estimates of black hole masses and their distribution given by\nKoushiappas et al. (2004) artificially depend on the initial angular\nmomentum distribution and also on the assumed viscosity law. On\nthe other hand, we have also clearly shown that, as long as vis-\ncosity is driven by gravitational instabilities, the black hole mass\ndistribution is independent of viscosity.\nIn this paper, for illustrative purposes, we have taken the sim-\nplifying assumption that these primordial discs live in the potential\nwell of a simple isothermal sphere, with a given circular velocity\nVh. For a more realistic density profile, the NFW profile (Navarro\net al. 1997), in its innermost parts, the disc mass might dominate the\npotential well and become radially unstable, giving rise to bar-like\ninstabilities. This, however, will leave our results and conclusions\nunaffected. First, the instability criterion for such global instabili-\nties (Christodoulou, Shlosman & Tohline 1995) is rather similar to\nour adopted criterion based on Q, and marginal stability is found to\noccur for equivalent values of Qc \u2248 2\u20133, as adopted here. Secondly,\nsince the disc mass is only a small fraction of the halo mass, only the\ninnermost parts of the disc will be subject to bar-like instabilities, at\nradii much smaller than the typical disc radius Rd. The development\nof such instabilities might, in fact, enhance the accretion rate in the\ninner disc, but will not change the estimates of the total accreted\nmass obtained here. The important and interesting consequence of\nour model is that black hole masses of 109 M\u0003 powering the lu-\nminous SDSS quasars at z = 6 can form comfortably within the\navailable time of 1 Gyr in the concordance cosmology from our\nseed masses of 105 M\u0003 at z \u223c 10.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThe authors acknowledge useful conversations and comments from\nPhilip Armitage, Mitch Begelman, Cathie Clarke, Michael Mayer,\nJim Pringle and Marta Volonteri.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nAbel T., Bryan G.

It is\nwell known (Gammie 2001; Lodato & Rice 2004, 2005) that once\ngravitational instabilities set in, the disc will rapidly evolve into a\nquasi-steady state of marginal gravitational instability, characterized\nby a constant profile of the Toomre parameter Q.\nWe start by noting that the requirement that Q be constant, for\nour flat rotation curve disc, implies that if the disc is isothermal\n(as it is expected to be, see Oh & Haiman 2002 and arguments\nbelow) then the surface density \u0007 \u221d R\u22121, that is, the disc has the\nsame density profile as a simple Mestel disc. This, in principle,\nmakes it very easy to include the contribution of the disc itself to\nthe radial gravitational field, since it also leads self-consistently to a\nflat rotation curve. However, we will not consider this contribution\nat present. The steady-state structure of such Mestel radially self-\ngravitating accretion discs has been explored extensively by Bertin\n& Lodato (1999), who also included the modifications to the disc\nstructure expected to take place very close to the black hole, where\nits gravitational field starts to become important.\nActually, it is possible to solve for the detailed disc structure\nby relaxing the assumption of isothermality of the disc, and by\ncomputing the temperature by requiring that radiative cooling (here\nassumed to be optically thin) is balanced by the heating provided\nby the accretion mechanism. This energy balance equation gives us\na relationship between \u03b1 and the cooling time tcool (Pringle 1981):\n\u03b1 = 1\n\u03b3 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\ntdyn\ntcool\n, (A1)\nwhere \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats, tdyn = R\/Vh is the dynamical\ntime-scale, and tcool = nkTgas\/n2\u0003(Tgas), where n is the number\ndensity, Tgas is the gas temperature and \u0003 is the relevant cooling\nfunction.\nOnce the cooling function is provided, it is then possible to solve\nthe basic disc equations describing self-regulation (equation 1), an-\ngular momentum conservation (equation 10) and thermal equilib-\nrium (equation A1) for the three unknowns \u0007(R), Tgas(R) and \u03b1(R),\nwith the input parameters Q, \u02d9M and Vh.\nWe consider here the case where the disc is made of primordial\ngas, with no metal-enrichment. The cooling process is then going to\nbe provided by hydrogen. We consider two cases: (i) when molecular\nhydrogen formation is suppressed, so that cooling is dominated by\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

The results of the calculations are shown in Fig. A1 where\nwe plot the resulting profiles of \u0007, Tgas and \u03b1, for different values of\nthe input parameters. Here, we have assumed Q = 1 and varied \u02d9M\nand Vh. As can be seen, due to the steepness of the cooling function,\nthe disc turns out to be almost isothermal, with the equilibrium tem-\nperature only very weakly dependent both on radius and especially\non input parameters, with Tgas \u2248 4000 K (note that changing the\nmass-accretion rate by two orders of magnitude, only modifies Tgas\nby roughly 14 per cent). In Fig. A1, we also plot the optical depth of\nthe disc \u03c4 = \u0007\u03baR, where the Rosseland mean opacities \u03baR for a pri-\nmordial composition have been taken from Mayer & Duschl (2005).\nWe see that the assumption of optically thin cooling is indeed valid\nover the whole disc.\nA2 Cooling processes: molecular hydrogen cooling\nWe consider next the situation wherein molecular hydrogen for-\nmation is not suppressed and we assume that it can form up to a\nmolecular fraction xH2 = 10\u22123 (Oh & Haiman 2002). The cooling\nfunction for molecular hydrogen is taken from Galli & Palla (1998).\nFig. A2 shows \u0007, Tgas and \u03b1 for this case. We do not plot the optical\ndepth for molecular hydrogen cooling, since the available opacity\ntables for primordial composition do not cover the very low tem-\nperature range predicted. At any rate, the opacity is expected to be\nextremely low. We can see that the equilibrium temperature is going\nto be much lower than that in the case of atomic hydrogen cooling,\nas expected.\nSince the cooling function is less strongly dependent on temper-\nature for molecular hydrogen cooling, the \u2018thermostat\u2019 that keeps\nthe temperature of the disc constant in the case of atomic cooling is\nless efficient, and the equilibrium temperature in this case depends\nmore strongly on the input parameters. The equilibrium tempera-\ntures range from 200 to 700 K. The disc is still close to isothermal,\nwith the temperature rising in the inner disc.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX\/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.
