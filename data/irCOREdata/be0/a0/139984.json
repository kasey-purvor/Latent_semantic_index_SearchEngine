Introduction\nFabrication of continuous fibre reinforced thermosetting matrix composites involves processes\nof different physical nature, including forming, consolidation or impregnation, and curing. Each\nof the processes influences subsequent manufacturing stages, and feeds through to the design of\nthe composite component, creating complex interdependencies between manufacturing\nparameters, design constraints and properties of the final part. Process models simulating the\ndifferent stages of manufacturing have been developed during the last decades and applied to\nthe majority of processing techniques [1-6]. These models, which assume that properties and\ngeometrical features are deterministic, have played an important role in understanding process\noutcome sensitivity and in developing process design and optimisation schemes. A gap exists\nbetween deterministic process simulation and industrial practice, as practical fabrication of\ncomposite components is performed in an environment of significant uncertainty both in\nmaterial properties and in process parameters. The main sources of uncertainty in composite\nprocessing are (i) variations in fibre architecture which can be introduced during manufacturing,\nstorage and handling of dry fabrics and pre-impregnated textiles; (ii) variations in the matrix\nmaterial which can be caused by batch to batch variations in resin formulation and composition,\nor by variability in storage conditions; and (iii) variations in process conditions related to\nenvironmental parameters and control tolerances.\nVariations in fibre architecture of textiles may affect the outcome of the draping\/forming stage\nand introduce uncertainty in permeability and in thermal properties that play a significant role in\nsubsequent processes such as filling\/consolidation and cure. Furthermore, variability in the\ntextile material causes local disturbances in the fibre architecture which in turn affect the local\nelastic properties and strength. The extent and spatial distribution of these variations determines\ntheir significance with respect to the expected properties used in component design. For\nexample, in the case of unidirectional composites it has been demonstrated that the spatial\ncharacter of fibre misalignment has a significant effect on compressive strength [7]. Variations\nin the matrix material affect the curing stage with potential consequences in the final material\nstate. Uncertainty in process parameters includes variations in thermal and pressure boundary\nconditions as well as in tooling properties, and can potentially affect all stages of manufacturing\nand the quality of produced components. These effects should be taken into account in process\ndesign with the incorporation of variability in appropriate stochastic process simulations to\nenable evaluation of potential process designs in terms of process robustness to be made.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nThe issue of variability and its influence on composites manufacturing has received relatively\nlittle attention. The combination of draping simulations with fibre misalignment information for\nnon-crimp fabrics within a simplified Monte Carlo scheme has demonstrated the significance of\nvariability in forming [8]. This used a simplified model of fibre misalignment which did not\nconsider spatial correlations. It is expected that variations in fibre architecture of textiles are not\ndistributed uniformly over a region of material, as fibre continuity and friction at tow crossovers\n(in the case of woven textiles) force disturbances to spread to neighbouring locations.\nConsequently, a realistic model for variability in forming with these materials requires\ninformation on the spatial structure of material variables, in addition to their global variance.\nThe effect of process and material uncertainty on the variability of fill time in liquid composite\nmoulding has been shown to be significant [9]. Fabric permeability variations can be attributed\nto both fibre angle and fibre spacing variability [10- 14]. Stochastic simulation of the filling\nstage in liquid moulding has been performed using both normally distributed spatially\nuncorrelated geometrical variability [10] and a random field in which spatial structure is taken\ninto account [11, 14]. It was concluded that quantitative prediction of variability requires\nconsideration of the spatial structure. Computational and experimental efforts have also\ndemonstrated that dry spot formation in liquid moulding is controlled by stochastic effects\ncaused by fabric heterogeneity due to variable nesting of adjacent layers [15, 16]. Padmanabhan\nand Pitchumani [17] examined the influence of variability on curing of composites. Parameters\nof cure kinetics models and cure temperature were assumed to be random with coefficient of\nvariation in the range of 1.5%-5%, and it was found that uncertainty induces significant\nvariations in cure completion times. Furthermore, incorporation of uncertainty affects the results\nof cure optimisation [18, 19]. The effect of the variability of relevant material properties on the\ndimensions of produced components has also been found to be significant [20]. The results\nreported in these studies indicate the general importance of variability in fabrication of\ncomposites and highlight the need for development of appropriate stochastic modelling\nmethodologies and tools for composite manufacturing processes. The focus is on the adaptation\nof stochastic simulation techniques which have found wide application in other branches of\napplied science and engineering such as geophysics, spatial economics, image and signal\nanalysis, as well as on the development of variability characterisation techniques for the\ngeneration of the necessary experimental information.\nThis study aims at the investigation of the influence of fibre architecture parameters on the\nforming of woven composites. An image analysis methodology is developed to measure local\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nfibre architecture parameters, such as fibre tow directions and the dimensions of the woven\ntextile unit cell. This is used to derive the distribution in these properties for a pre-impregnated\ncarbon epoxy woven textile. A stochastic model describing the autocorrelation structure based\non the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet is used and maximum likelihood estimation yields the model\nparameters in the example of the carbon epoxy pre-impregnated textile. This statistical\ndescription of the textile is used to generate numerical realisations of the woven material for use\nin a forming analysis. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation for uniform and variable blank\nholder force distributions are compared to evaluate the influence of taking into account material\nvariability in process design.\n2. Analysis of geometric variability of woven materials\nInvestigation of variability in the geometrical parameters of woven materials requires\ndevelopment and application of an image analysis procedure which operated at a local level.\nHere, the focus is to estimate tow directions and unit cell lengths in the tow directions by\nassuming approximate a priori knowledge of the size of the unit cell of the textile.\n2.1. Image analysis methodology\nA grey-scale image of the woven textile can be represented by a function f(x,y) expressing the\ndistribution of brightness with F(u,v) its Fourier spectrum. The structure of woven textiles is\nperiodic and can be described as a convolution of an elementary unit u(x,y) by a pattern of\nrepetition h(x, y) [21]\nf(x,y)= u(x,y) ~ h(x,y) (1)\nwith the pattern of repetition expressed as\n= ----\nh x , y \u03b4 x n a x mbx , y n a y mby\n( ) \u00a6 ( )\n(2)\nn , m Z\nwhere \u03b4 (x,y) is the Dirac delta function and { a = (ax ,ay ) , b = (bx ,by )} is the vector basis that\ngenerates h(x,y). It should be noted that the decomposition implied by Eq. (1) is not unique\nand several elementary unit-vector basis combinations can generate the same periodic structure.\nThe image analysis technique estimates the local basis vector {a,b} that corresponds\nto a conventional rectangular unit cell.\nFourier transform of a linear periodic image yields a two dimensional spectrum with directional\nstructure with maxima in the direction normal to the orientation of the image. This fact has been\nused in image analysis of woven textiles to estimate the direction of tows by\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nintegrating F ( u , v ) along radial directions and identifying the warp and weft direction as the\ndirections of maximum accumulated radial energies [22]. Furthermore, the number of tows per\nunit length is related to the distance between the dc term, i.e. the point of zero frequency, and\nthe first peak of F ( u , v ) in the corresponding tow direction [21]. Based on these principles\nand the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), computationally efficient methodologies for\nanalysing woven textile images have been developed and applied to automated defect detection\nand weave pattern identification in textiles [23, 24]. The applicability of these techniques in the\ncontext of the present study is limited as they are based on the analysis of images comprising a\nlarge number of unit cells of the periodic structure. Here, estimation of local geometric\nvariables at a unit cell level is required and Fourier transform is only useful for a pre-estimation\nof tow directions. This information is combined with the nominal unit cell size to obtain a prior\nestimate of unit cell positions adjacent to the centre of the image of the woven material.\nCorrelation analysis is then employed for an accurate estimation of the position of adjacent cells.\nThe correlation of a reference region r ( x , y ) with the image f ( x , y ) at\nlocation ( \u03c4 x , \u03c4 y ) is\nC(\u03c4 ,\u03c4 )r(x,y)f(x\u03c4 x y ,y\u03c4 )dxdy\nx y =\u00b3\u00b3 + + (3)\n~\nwith the reference region ~ selected to coincide with the central part of the image. Correlation\nreaches a maximum value at the centre of the image and, due to periodicity, high peak values at\npoints of repetition adjacent to the centre. Thus, it is possible to identify the local basis vector of\nthe pattern of repetition in terms of tow directions and unit cell size in the tow directions.\nThe image analysis procedure is performed in seven steps as follows:\n( i ) Image acquisition and digitisation into a K \u00d7 K discrete pixel array ( ) y , x f .\n( i i ) Applicati\non of fast Fourier transform to calculate F ( u , v ) and the modulus ( ) v , u F .\n(iii) Calculation of radial energy E ( \u03b8) after expressing F in polar coordinates as\n+f\nE ( \u03b8) = \u00b3 ) (dr\u03b8, rF.\n0\n(iv)Estimation of approximate directions \u03b8\u02c61 and \u03b8\u02c62 that maximise ()\u03b8E.\n(v)Estimation of an initial solution for the basis vector {a \u02c6 ,b} \u02c6 using the approximate tow\ndirections and the nominal unit cell size.

This calculation is\ncomputationally intensive and therefore it is performed over a region with a size approximately\nequal to 20 % of the nominal unit cell size, centred at each prior estimate of the unit cell\npositions.\n(vii)Estimation of the positions that maximise \u03c1 (\u03c4 x , \u03c4 y ) and calculation of the basis vector\nand\nthe tow directions and unit cell size.\nThe image analysis methodology was applied to images of a five harness satin weave 6k\ncarbon\/epoxy pre-preg (Hexcel) with a resin weight fraction of 0.42. The fibre areal weight of\nthis pre-preg is 370 g\/m2, its linear tow density is 4.5 tows\/cm and the width of tows 2.2 mm.\nDigital images were acquired using an Olympus camera. The woven material was set on the\ntable of an Omicron coordinate measurement system, while the camera was mounted on its\nmeasuring head in order to record the exact position of each image. Four hundred and sixty\nimages were acquired on a 23 \u00d7 20 grid with 15 mm spacing. Fig. 1 shows an image of the\ntextile, with the corresponding FFT spectra and correlation distributions. The results of image\nanalysis, illustrated as four lines starting from the centre of each image and ending at the\nestimated location of the adjacent unit cells, are superimposed on the woven material image.\nThe nominal unit cell is 10 mm, the size of the image array is 480 \u00d7 480 and the size of the\nreference region is 70 \u00d7 70. It should be noted that the FFT spectra in Fig. 1(b) are rotated by\n90o to illustrate the coincidence of maximum radial energy directions with the direction of tows.\nThe spectra obtained by the Fourier transform are sharp and correlation estimates exhibit very\nsharp peaks. This allows accurate estimation of unit cell positions.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nFigure 1. Image analysis of carbon\/epoxy pre-preg: (a) Image and identified unit cell\npositions; (b) FFT spectrum rotated by \u03c0\/2; (c) Correlation distribution and identified unit\ncell positions.\n2.2. Statistical properties and spatial autocorrelation\nThe basic statistical properties of the unit cell parameters of the carbon\/epoxy textile are\nsummarised in Table 1, and the correlation matrix is given in Table 2. The corresponding\ndistributions are illustrated in Fig. 2. Here, \u03b8w a r p , \u03b8w e f t denote the warp and weft directions\nrespectively. Angles are measured in a clockwise direction relative to the nominal warp\ndirection of the material. The unit cell lengths in the two tow directions are lwarp and w e f t l ,\nwhile lo is the nominal unit cell length. Unit cell lengths are expressed as percentage ratios with\nrespect to nominal lengths. The statistical properties reported include the average \u00b5 and the\nstandard deviation \u03c3 of the sample. Also, the single measurement standard deviation, r \u03c3 ,\ncalculated from the analysis of 20 images taken at the same location of the woven sheet, and the\nstandard deviation due to uncertainty, \u03c3u , calculated as the error due to the finite\nresolution of the images are reported. It can be observed that there exists significant variability\nin both tow directions. Variability in warp tow orientations appears significantly lower than that\nfor the weft direction. Variability in unit cell lengths is negligible, since the sample standard\ndeviation is of similar magnitude to repeatability for this material.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\n( c ) ( d )\nFigure 2.

Also, the two unit cell\nlengths are uncorrelated and tow directions are uncorrelated to lengths. Examination of the\ndistribution of tow directions and cell lengths shown in Fig. 3 suggests that all variables are\nnormally distributed. The value of warp direction ranges from -1o to 1o and of weft\n8 7 8 9 9 1 9 3\nW e f t d i re c t i o n ( o )\n( b )\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\ndirection from 87o to 92o. The range of values for the normalised cell length is about 5% in the\nwarp and weft directions with these deviations being of similar magnitude to the repeatability of\nthe image acquisition and analysis procedure.\nTable 2\nCorrelation matrix of unit cell parameters of 6k carbon\/1947 epoxy 5 harness satin\nweave\nThe autocorrelation structure of the variables of interest is examined in order to quantify the\nspatial dependence of variability. Spatial autocorrelation is estimated as a function of distance\nand orientation using the method of moments. The correlation between two samples of all pairs\nof points in the original sample that are located at a specific distance and orientation, and within\na discretisation range, is calculated. The directional spatial autocorrelation of the stochastic\nvariables for the carbon\/epoxy satin weave pre-preg is illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be observed that\nstrong autocorrelation exists in the orientation of weft tows, whereas the autocorrelation in warp\ntow orientations is negligible. The autocorrelation of weft orientation is persistently high in the\n0o direction, which coincides with the direction of warp tows. Autocorrelation in this direction\npersists within the range of measurements indicating the existence of variability trends with\nrange that exceeds that of the measurements. These differences between warp and weft tows\nreflect the differences in tow tensions during the weaving process. Autocorrelation in directions\nclose to the weft direction (\u00b175o) crosses the zero level at about 60 mm, a distance that\ncorresponds to 6 unit cells. Autocorrelation drops off within 10 to 20 unit cells (100-200 mm) at\norientations between the warp and the weft direction. Negative weft orientation autocorrelation\nis observed at high distance for directions of fast decaying autocorrelation as a result of longer\nrange trends in the stochastic variable. Curves corresponding to opposite directions in Fig. 3(b)\nare very similar (compare the dashed and solid lines in Fig. 3).

Spatial cross correlation between the warp and weft direction and\nbetween lengths and tow orientations is also found to be negligible.\n( a ) ( b )\nFigure 3.

Modelling of the random field\nThe results of spatial analysis showed that misalignment in weft tows of the woven material has\nan anisotropic spatial autocorrelation structure. The random field, Z(x, y), generated by\nthis structure and expressing the distribution of the stochastic variable is modelled using a two-\nparameter stochastic process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet, which is defined as a stationary\nGaussian process on the plane with covariance function [25, 26]:\n\u03b3 x x \u03b3 y yE Z x , y E Z Z x , y EZ\u03c3 e- - - -[ ( ( )[] ) ( () [] ) ] 2 1 1 2 2 1 2- - = (5)\n1 1 2 2\n\u03b3Here E[~] denotes expectation, \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the stationary field, and 1\n\u03b3 , 2\nare positive coefficients that control the range and degree of anisotropy of the autocorrelation\nstructure. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet expressed by Eq. (5) is the two-dimensional extension\nof the mean reverting stochastic process and the continuous equivalent of autoregressive\nprocesses [27].\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n-0.25\n-0.50\n-0.75\n100 200 300\nDistance (mm)\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nEstimation of the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet is based on the maximisation of\nthe likelihood function. The vector of values of the random variable over the plane Z follows a\nmultidimensional normal distribution with probability density function\nwhere N the size of the vector, \u03a3 the covariance matrix calculated using Eq. (5) and \u00b5 the vector\nof expected values. Given the vector Zexp of measured values of the random variable on a regular\ngrid of size m\u00d7 n the loglikelihood function is\nlm , n (\u03c3,\u03b3 1 ,\u03b3 2)= log(p(Z exp)) (7)\nLoglikelihood is used instead of likelihood to avoid numerical problems, as for long vectors Z\nthe value of the probability density functions involves very high negative powers. The\nmaximum likelihood estimator of the three parameters of the covariance function based on a\nrealisation over a regular grid of sufficiently large size is strongly consistent, i.e. it converges\nalmost surely to the true parameter values. For limited size sampling grids, maximum\nlikelihood yields a consistent estimator of the product 2\n\u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \u03c3 [28]. Moreover, with x fixed, Z(xo\n,y) is a one-dimensional process having (21 2)\n\u03c3 2 exp- \u03b3 y - y as the covariance function while,\nwith y fixed, Z(x, yo ) is an one-dimensional process having (1 1 2 )\n\u03c3 2 exp- \u03b3 x - xas the\ncovariance function. Ying [29] shows that the maximum likelihood estimators of 2\n\u03b32\u03c3and\n2\n\u03b31\u03c3 using Z(xo ,y) and Z(x, yo ) are consistent. Combining these three consistent estimators,\nparameters \u03b31, \u03b32 and \u03c3 can be estimated.\nEvaluation of the likelihood functions expressed by Eqs. (6) and (7) can be computationally\nexpensive within a maximisation routine when the size of vector Z is relatively high. Here,\nmaximisation of likelihood is based on the expressions developed by Ying [28, 29] for efficient\nevaluation of the loglikelihood functions for both the stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nand sheet on regular grids.

Theestimationprocedure\nused here extrapolates the results of image analysis over a large size textile sheet. The\ncoefficient values imply that autocorrelation of weft tows orientation extends to about 500 mm\nin the warp direction (direction parallel to coordinate x) and to about 100 mm in the weft\ndirection (direction parallel to coordinate y ) . These values correspond to three times the\ncorrelation length which amounts to a decay of exponential autocorrelation at about 5%.\n3.2. Stochastic simulation\nThe geometry of a sheet of woven textile can be characterised by the distribution of warp and\nweft direction and of the unit cell size in the two directions over the plane. In a discretised\nformulation, the woven sheet is characterised by a vector V of size 4N . Vector V comprises the\nwarp and weft direction and the size of the unit cell at N different locations and it is assumed\nto follow a multidimensional normal distribution expressed by the following probability density\n2\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nfunction\n1 1 -\n( ) ( V\u00b5 ) \u03a3V ( V\u00b5 )1 T- - -\npV2 = ________ e4 4N N\n2\u03c0 \u03a3V\nThe covariance matrix \u03a3V and the vector of expected values \u00b5V encompass all the\ninformation about the statistics of the four variables, and their spatial autocorrelation and cross-\ncorrelation. The multidimensional stochastic process is homogeneous (second order\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nstationary) and expected values and variances for the four variables are constant over the plane.\nGeneration of realisations of a woven sheet following the statistical properties implied by Eq.\n(10) is performed using Cholesky factorisation. The covariance matrix \u03a3V is symmetric and\npositive definite and it has a Cholesky root L such that:\nT\n\u03a3V =LL(11)\nwhere L is a triangular matrix. The product of a vector W of normally distributed independent\nrandom variables with the Cholesky root is a vector that follows the statistics required by Eq.\n(10) so that vector V can be simulated as follows:\nV= LW (12)\nThe procedure expressed by Eqs. (11) and (12) is implemented in two steps. The first step, in\nwhich the Cholesky root is computed, is computationally intensive but only needs to be\nexecuted once. This is followed by a generation step in which realisations of random vector W\nare generated and transformed to realisations of vector V via Eq. (12). The second step has low\ncomputational cost and is executed a number of times equal to the number of required textile\nrealisations.\nRealisations of V are translated into realisations of a stochastic textile using the procedure\ndepicted in Fig. 4. Two types of nodes are used to define the grid: (i) regular nodes, shown as\nclosed circles in Fig. 4; and (ii) auxiliary nodes, which are placed at intermediate positions of\nthe grid, shown as open circles in Fig. 4. Auxiliary nodes are located at four positions around a\nregular node so that the linear segment connecting two auxiliary nodes has the slope and length\ncorresponding to the tow direction and unit cell size of the respective regular node in the\nappropriate direction. The procedure is executed in three steps, with the first two used for the\ngeneration of boundary nodes as illustrated in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), and the third for generation of\ninternal nodes as shown in Fig. 4(c). The generation of nodes of the vertical boundary requires\nuse of the weft direction and unit cell size in the weft direction. Knowledge of the position of\nnode (1, j-1) in Fig. 4(a) allows calculation of the position of node (1, j), as the midpoint of the\nlinear segment that starts at the higher auxiliary node corresponding to (1, j-1), with slope and\nlength corresponding to the direction and unit cell size of weft tows at position (1, j).\nSubsequently, the positions of the rest of the auxiliary nodes of node (1, j) are computed using\nthe orientation and unit cell size values in both tow directions. Generation of the horizontal\nboundary (Fig. 4(b)) follows a similar procedure. The position of node (i-1, 1) is used to\ncompute the coordinates of node (i, 1) and of the corresponding auxiliary nodes.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nThe generation of internal nodes starts from the corner of known boundaries and progresses first\nhorizontally and then vertically so that the positions of nodes (i-1, j) and (i, j-1) are known when\nthe position of node (i, j) is computed. The coordinates of the auxiliary node located between\nnodes (i-1, j) and (i, j) are calculated using the warp direction data for node (i-1, j). Similarly the\ncalculation of coordinates of the auxiliary node located between nodes (i, j-1) and (i, j) is based\non the weft direction data for node (i, j-1). These two auxiliary nodes are the starting points of\ntwo linear segments with slope corresponding to the orientation of warp and weft tows at\nposition (i, j) and length corresponding to the size of the unit cell in the warp and weft direction.\nThe intersection between these two linear segments coincides with the position of node (i, j)\nwhereas their ends define the positions of the rest of the auxiliary nodes corresponding to node\n(i, j). This procedure is repeated to generate a sheet of material with the required size.\nW a r p (a ) (b ) (c )\nFigure 4. Woven textile generation algorithm.

(c) Generation of internal node.\nIn the case of the five harness satin weave carbon\/epoxy pre-preg used in this study, the warp\nand weft orientations are considered to be variable, with the spatial autocorrelation given by Eq.\n(5); while the unit cell size in both directions does not vary. Fig. 5 illustrates two realisations of\nthe carbon\/epoxy pre-preg generated on a 20 \u00d7 20 grid with 10 mm spacing and the\nautocorrelation of simulated weft orientation in the warp direction calculated using the method\nof moments. It can be observed that the autocorrelation of simulated data is very similar to that\nmeasured experimentally. In general, the simulation produces quadrant symmetric\nautocorrelation structures that reproduce the experimental results illustrated in Fig. 3.\nAutocorrelation is persistently high in the warp direction, and negative values occur at other\ndirections due to the long range trends induced by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet with long\ncorrelation lengths. As a result the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet can reproduce the existence of\ntrends over a limited area of the textile which cause negative autocorrelations.\n( i -1 , 1 ) (i , 1 )\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nFigure 5.

Forming model\nForming is modelled using a simplified finite element model based on a truss representation of\nthe woven material. A brief description of the forming model is given here; a full description of\nits operation, material submodels, convergence and validation can be found in [31]. The\nsimplified forming model simulates the woven fabric as an assembly of bars, as shown in Fig. 6.\nAll bars are connected at the corners of the unit cell via pin joints. The sides of the unit cell\nrepresent the tows of the textile and the diagonal bars govern the non-linear shear behaviour of\nthe assembly. This arrangement allows the trellising action observed in practice to be\nreproduced when the effective stiffness of the tow bars is significantly higher than the shear\nresistance of diagonal bars. Under shear, one of the diagonal elements is in tension and the other\nin compression. The incorporation of wrinkling due to tow buckling is based on an\nactivation\/deactivation strategy applied to tow elements. Deactivation is triggered by the\nexistence of compressive strain in the element and reactivation by the existence of tensile strain.\nThe action of the blank holder on the woven material is incorporated in a\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00 -\n0.25 -\n0.50\n-0.75\n00\n(a )\n100 200 300\nDistance (mm)\n(c )\n0\u00b0 - Experiment\n0\u00b0 - Realisation 1\n0\u00b0 - Realisation 2\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nsimplified way in the model by the inclusion of a group of bar elements connected to nodes in\ncontact with the blank holder. These elements, which are fixed with respect to all degrees of\nfreedom on their free ends, simulate friction via their perfectly plastic behaviour. Their yield\nstress is selected to match the total clamping force and the tool-woven sheet friction coefficient.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 6. Truss representation of a woven textile (a) Model assembly. (b) Unit cell.\nThe material behaviour of tow and diagonal shear elements follows directly from\nexperimental observations and the operational requirements of the simplified model. Tow\nelements govern the tensile behaviour of the material in the tow direction, which typically\nfollows a bilinear stress-strain curve, with the initial part corresponding to changes in\nundulation and tow compression and the second part following the elastic behaviour of the tow\n[32]. A non-linear elastic constitutive relationship is used to express this behaviour,\nE E\n- _____________________ ~ 1\u00a7 \u00b7 E E\n- 1\u00a7 \u00b7o ___~ ________________________o ___________________ln -\u03c3 E\u03b5 t 1\n= + __________________________________ \u03b1\u03b5\u00a8 ( _ ) \u00b8\u00b8 ______ln\u00a8 ______\n~ - -\nt e t \u03b1 \u03b5 \u03b5\n\u03b1 1+e \u03b1\n\u00a9 \u00b9 \u00a9 + \u00b9\nHere \u03c3t and \u03b5t denote the tow element stress and Green-Lagrange strain respectively, Eo is\nthe effective tow modulus at very low strains, E~ the effective modulus at high strains.

This simplified non-linear elastic model adopted here,\nneglects the coupling between warp and weft tow tensile strains seen in textiles modelling,\nthough in principle this could be incorporated.

Typically, woven materials show high shear compliance at low strains when\nbearing-type contact effects dominate deformation, while their shear resistance increases rapidly\nat higher strains due to lateral compression and intra-tow friction which eventually cause lock\nup of the textile [33].

Material properties\nThe results of tensile and bias extension test were used to estimate material parameters involved\nin the material submodels described by Eqs. (1 3)-( 15). Tests were performed on the 5 harness\n6k carbon\/1947 epoxy satin weave. Tensile experiments were carried out on an Instron test\nmachine at a deformation rate of 2 mm\/min. A gauge length of 10 cm was used and the\ndeformation was measured using a laser extensometer. The load was applied using clamps of\n2.5 cm width which was equal to the width of the samples. Bias extension tests were carried out\nusing the equipment described in [35]. A rectangular piece of woven material, 210 mm \u00d7 70\nmm in dimensions, was loaded with the warp and weft directions orientated initially at \u00b1 45o to\nthe loading. Three test speeds were used, 10, 40 and 160 mm\/min corresponding strain rates of\n0.0013, 0.0055 and 0.022 s-1 respectively. The applied force and the deformation of the diagonal\nof a square gauge region with an initial diagonal size of 40 mm in the full shear part of the\nspecimen were recorded.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nFig. 7. Comparison between experimental and model results in (a) tension and (b) bias\nextension of 5 harness satin weave carbon\/epoxy pre-preg.\nFig. 7 illustrates the results of tensile and bias extension characterisation experiments. The\ntypical bilinear behaviour caused by decrimping effects is observed in tension. Bias extension\nresults show an initial force increase at low strains, followed by a low stiffness region and a\nlarge increase in stiffness at high strains. Strong strain rate dependence of the response in bias\nextension is observed. Apparent shear compliance decreases with increasing rate, whereas the\nstrain at which a transition from low to high shear stiffness behaviour occurs increases.\nMeasured force is normalised by the number of tows of the corresponding specimen (11 tows\nin the tensile test and 22 in the bias extension test) to calculate tow stress used in material\nsubmodels. Inversion of Eqs. (13) - (18) is performed to estimate material parameters that\nminimise the discrepancy between model and experimental response. Details of the\nintegration scheme used for Eqs. (1 3)-(1 8), of the inversion technique and of the selection of\ninitial values are given in [31]. The results of model fitting are summarised in Table 3.

Deterministic forming simulation\nThe forming model accompanied by the material submodels is implemented in MSC.Marc to\nmodel the forming of a hemisphere. The radius of the hemisphere considered is 60 mm. A fillet\nwith a radius of 20 mm connects the hemisphere with a tool base. Appropriate user defined\nsubroutines are used to incorporate the viscoplastic stress-strain response of shear elements,\nwrinkling and the non-linear elastic behaviour of tow elements and the perfectly plastic\nbehaviour of friction elements. Material properties produced by experimental analysis and\nparameter identification are normalised with respect to the number of tows, and properties of the\nelements of the unit cell are scaled accordingly. Tooling is modelled as a group of rigid surfaces\nand contact between the tow elements of the woven sheet and tooling is considered. In the\ndeterministic case, the woven material has an ideal geometry and quadratic symmetry can be\nused. In stochastic simulation, however, geometry deviates from the ideal case and\nconsideration of the full geometry of the model is necessary.\nInvestigation of mesh convergence has indicated that a unit cell size of 15 mm is adequate for\nsimulation of draping over a hemisphere with the geometry used here [31]. Optimisation studies\nhave indicated that use of variable peripheral force involving higher clamping pressures at\npositions aligned to the bias direction of woven textiles minimises wrinkling due to tow\nbuckling in the produced component [36]. Hemisphere forming using the five harness satin\nweave carbon\/epoxy pre-preg was investigated using the deterministic forming simulation. Two\ncases are considered: (i) forming with constant peripheral force profile; and (ii) forming with\nvariable force profile. The total clamping force applied to the sheet of woven\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nmaterial is 400 N in both cases. In the variable peripheral pressure case force in the bias\ndirection, i.e. along the diagonal of the woven sheet, is increased by 75%.\nTable 4\nAverage and minimum engineering wrinkling strain and maximum shear angle\npredicted by the simulation of hemisphere forming of the five harness satin weave\ncarbon epoxy pre-preg\nAverage wrinkling Minimum wrinkling Maximum shear (o)\nConstant force\nVariable force\n-0.244\n-0.142\n10-2\n10-2\n-0.107\n-0.078\n53.88\n54.46\nTable 4 summarises the results of deterministic forming simulation and Fig. 8 illustrates a\ncomparison of formed patterns, textile shear distribution and wrinkling strain distribution under\nuniformly distributed and under variable clamping pressure. High shear occurs at four locations\naligned to the bias direction near the base of the hemisphere. Shear on the apex and at normal\npositions near the base is negligible. Maximum shear is slightly higher in the case of the\noptimised force profile as a consequence of increased force in the direction of high shear. The\nmodel identifies regions of concentrated wrinkling due to tow buckling at four normal positions\naligned to the tow directions along the base of the hemisphere. The direction of compression\ndue to wrinkling is parallel to the corresponding side of the base at each of the four locations. The\nmaximum absolute value of wrinkling strain decreases from 10 % to 8 % when the variable\nperipheral force is used, while average absolute wrinkling strain over the hemisphere decreases\nfrom 0.24 % to 0.14 %. This follows from the fact that the mechanisms of wrinkling due to tow\nbuckling and shear are competitive modes of deformation as the woven textile conforms on the\ndoubly curved tool. Conditions that promote higher shear, such as increased force in diagonal\ndirections, result in less wrinkling.\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nFig. 8.

Stochastic forming simulation\nThe stochastic textile generation procedure described previously is coupled with the forming\nmodel to carry out stochastic process simulation. The interaction between textile generation and\nthe process model is performed by altering nodal coordinates in the MSC.Marc finite element\ninput file. The forming model is executed for 400 realisations of the stochastic representation of\nthe five harness carbon\/epoxy satin weave pre-preg using the constant and variable force\nprofiles described in the previous section. For this material, the unit cell size is considered to be\ndeterministic according to the results of image analysis. The direction of warp tows is stochastic\nwith standard deviation of 0.3 6o. Weft tow direction is stochastic and spatially autocorrelated\nwith a structure that follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet described by Eq. (5). Cross-\ncorrelations between the various variables are negligible.\nFig. 9 illustrates the distributions of average and minimum wrinkling strain for the two\nperipheral force profiles produced from these runs, alongside the corresponding values for the\ncase of a textile with ideal geometry. The results indicate that average and minimum wrinkling\nstrain follow a normal distribution. As reported in the previous section, both the average and\nminimum wrinkling strain for uniform material geometry decrease significantly\nW rink l ing strain(c ) (d )\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nwhen the variable peripheral force profile is used. Similarly in the stochastic case with variable\ntextile geometry the distributions are shifted to higher strains with the variable peripheral force\nprofile. Average wrinkling with a uniform force is approximately equal to the result of the ideal\ntextile forming simulation. In contrast, average wrinkling with the optimised force profile is\nlower than that of the deterministic case, indicating an adverse effect of the use of the optimised\nprofile on the robustness of the process. Minimum wrinkling is significantly lower than\nminimum wrinkling in the ideal material case. Consequently, the ideal material result\ncorresponds to approximately 90% of the stochastic simulation result, i.e. about 90% of the\nstochastic simulation realisations show more absolute wrinkling than the ideal geometry\nsimulation. These results indicate that the variability of woven textiles induces significant\nvariability in the outcome of the forming process. For the carbon\/epoxy pre-preg investigated in\nthis study variability corresponds to a coefficient of variation in the range of 10-20 % for\naverage and minimum wrinkling strain.\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0.0\n-\n0.30% -0.25% -0.20% -0.15%\nAverage wrinkling strain\n(a )\n0.0\n-0.25 -0.20 -0.15 -0.10 -0.05\nMinimum wrinkling strain\n(b)\nFig. 9.

The total\nblank holder force is 400 N in both cases and the number of realisations is 400.\nTable 5 provides a comparison between the statistics of wrinkling in the two tow directions. It\ncan be observed that the mean and variance of both the average and minimum wrinkling are\nthe same for the warp and weft directions, so that wrinkling results for two directions can be\naggregated. The nonlinearity in the calculation of minimum wrinkling results in higher\naverage and similar standard deviation for the aggregate. The correlation between average\nwrinkling in the warp and weft direction is negative with a value of approximately -0.4 for\nboth the uniform and variable force profile. As a result, the standard deviation of average\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nwrinkling strain over both warp and weft tows is significantly lower than the standard deviation\nin any of the two directions.\nTable 5\nStatistical properties of average and minimum engineering wrinkling strain predicted\nby stochastic forming simulation\nAverage wrinkling (%) Minimum wrinkling\n\u00b5 \u03c3 \u00b5 \u03c3\nWarp tows -0.244 0.03 1 -0.131 0.015\nConstant force Weft tows -0.245 0.032 -0.134 0.019\nTotal -0.245 0.017 -0.142 0.017\nWarp tows -0.159 0.024 -0.105 0.016\nVariable force Weft tows -0.160 0.023 -0.110 0.020\nTotal -0.159 0.013 -0.118 0.017\nFig. 10 illustrates the wrinkling strain distribution for the uniform and variable force profile for\none realisation of the stochastic forming simulation. It can be observed that the distribution is\nasymmetric and for this realisation wrinkling strain in the warp direction is higher than in the\nweft direction. Wrinkling due to tow buckling occurs at similar positions as those predicted in\ndeterministic forming simulation. However, in the stochastic case, the exact location can be\nslightly different, e.g. for buckling of warp tows in the case of uniform force profile in the\nrealisation shown in Fig. 10.\nW a r p W a r p W a r p\n( a ) ( b ) ( c )\nFig. 10.

Conclusion\nIn this study, a methodology is presented for analysing and simulating random geometrical\nparameters of woven materials, which are expected to influence forming and final properties of\nwoven composite structures. Image analysis provides quantitative information on misalignment\nof tows and local unit cell size. The methodology proposed in this study is based on a\ncombination of Fourier transform, which provides an approximate estimate of warp and weft\ntow directions, and a local correlation search which yields accurate estimates of the position of\nunit cells adjacent to the centre of an image of the woven material. The analysis is applied to\nimages of a five harness carbon\/epoxy satin weave pre-preg. It is observed that variability of\ntow orientations is significant and tends to be higher in the weft direction than in the warp\ndirection. In contrast, unit cell lengths do not show significant variations. Cross-correlations\nbetween all variables are found to be negligible. The orientation of weft tows in the\ncarbon\/epoxy pre-preg has a strong and highly anisotropic spatial autocorrelation. Persistent\ncorrelation of weft orientation occurs at its corresponding normal direction. Autocorrelation\ndrops off within 6 to 20 unit cell lengths at directions other than the normal.\nThe random field resulting from spatially autocorrelated stochastic variables is simulated using\nthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheet. Cholesky decomposition is employed to simulate the stochastic\nvariables of the woven textile over the plane. Stochastic simulation generates the values of the\nwarp and weft orientation, and unit cell size in the warp and weft direction on a grid. This\ninformation is translated into a realisation of the stochastic woven textile by computing the\ncoordinates of the nodes of the grid.\nStochastic simulation is coupled with a simplified finite element model of forming to quantify\nthe effect of woven material variability on the formed component. The model is based on a truss\napproximation of the textile and it incorporates non-linear rate dependent shear of the woven\nmaterial and wrinkling due to tow buckling. Results show that variability of the woven material\ngeometry induces significant variations in the formed component. Coefficient of variations of\naverage and minimum wrinkling strain in the formed component are in the range 10-20 %. In\naddition, forming conditions which were found to be optimal in a deterministic optimisation\nframework are still preferable but introduce higher variability in the final geometry when the\nstochastic nature of the textile is considered.\nThe stochastic formulation presented here can be expanded to incorporate variability\ninformation arising from sources of uncertainty other than fibre architecture, such as process\nparameters and resin matrix properties. Future work will use this simulation scheme in\nComposites Science and Technology Available online 16 February 2007\nconjunction with optimisation tools in order to incorporate information on process sensitivities\nand performance-variability trade offs in process design.\nAcknowledgements\nContributions from the EPSRC, MSC.Software Ltd, University of Nottingham, DSTL, UK\nMinistry of Defence, Hexcel Composites, Granta Design Ltd., Ford Motor Company Ltd.,\nPolynorm Plastics (UK) Ltd., Virtual Prototyping Solutions Ltd., Saint-Gobain Vetrotex\nInternational SA and ESI Software SA are gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n1.
