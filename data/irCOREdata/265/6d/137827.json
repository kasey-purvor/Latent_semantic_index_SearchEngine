Introduction \nThe aim of precision farming is to target specific amounts of agronomic inputs to optimise \nthe productivity of fields exhibiting within-field spatial variation in both yield potential and \nquality.  In order to understand the causes and the extent of this variability, such that effective \nmanagement decisions can be made, there is a requirement for an effective method of \naccurately mapping soil and crop parameters.  Proposed methods of precision farming that \nmanage the rate of crop growth to optimise canopy size, yield potential and quality (Wood et \nal., 2002) require accurate, near real-time maps of shoot population and green area index \n(GAI).  Whilst techniques such as electromagnetic induction offer an effective approach for \nmapping soil parameters (Godwin & Miller, 2002; Earl, et al., 2002), this paper outlines the \ndevelopment of a technique for accurately measuring crop parameters using remote sensing \ntechniques that can be made available to the grower cost-effectively. \n \nShoot population is an important variable in cereal management because it directly \ngoverns canopy size and grain yield (HGCA, 1998).  Shoot population is dependent on an \ninteraction of the rate of tillering and initial plant population (Whaley et al., 2000) which, in \nturn, is dependent upon soil physical properties, soil nutrient-water status and temperature \n(Perry, 1993).  These factors vary spatially within single agricultural fields, for example,  soil \nnutrients have been shown to vary over distances down to c. 24 m (Taylor et al., 2002).  \nWood et al.  (2002) have shown that within-field variation in shoot density can have a \nsignificant impact upon field management decisions.  If accurate methods of measuring \nwithin-field variation in canopy-size parameters were possible, it would provide an \ninvaluable diagnostic to guide the use of agronomic inputs such as fertiliser nitrogen \n  3\n(Sylvester-Bradley et al., 1997), plant growth regulators (Berry, et al., 1998), and fungicides \n(Miller, 1998; Bjerre & Secher, 1998).  Hitherto, accurate mapping techniques for \nquantifying within-field variation in canopy-size parameters for crop management have been \nunavailable. \n \nAt the outset of the project it was decided that a system for delivering maps of crop \ncanopy parameters could be offered using optical remote sensing techniques.  Previous work \n(NAS, 1970; Wiegand et al., 1991; Chapman & Barreto, 1997) pointed to the use of \ntechniques that utilise empirical relations between ground measurement and spectral \nreflectance.  Typically, measures of red (R) and near infrared (NIR) spectral wavelengths are \ncombined in the form of simple vegetation indices, such as the normalised difference \nvegetation index (NDVI) as given in Eqn (1) after Goward, et al., (1991). \n \nINDV = (\u03bbNIR \u2013 \u03bbR) \/ (\u03bbNIR + \u03bbR)       (1) \n \nwhere: INDV is the normalised difference vegetation index; and \u03bbR and \u03bbNIR are the red and \nnear infrared spectral wavebands \nThe concept of using combinations of red and near infrared measurements to estimate \nbiophysical parameters of vegetation was first introduced by Jordan (1969) who used a \nsimple ratio of canopy transmittance to derive leaf area index.  Much research has \ninvestigated the spectral properties of vegetation canopies (NAS, 1970; Jacquemoud & Baret, \n1990; Buschmann & Nagel, 1993).  In particular, the use of red and near-infrared \nwavelengths has provided a basis for extensive vegetation assessments (Wiegand, et al., \n1991; Chapman & Barreto, 1997).  Numerous spectral vegetation indices have since been \ndefined and empirically related, by ground measurements, to vegetation properties such as \n  4\npercent ground cover, green area index (GAI) and above-ground biomass (Kauth & Thomas, \n1976; Richardson & Wiegand, 1977; Miller 1990; Price, 1992; Steven, 1998; Jago et al., \n1999). \n \nOther approaches are based on radiative transfer models which are used to derive canopy \nbiophysical parameters from a limited set of reflectance measures (Baret, 2001a).  This \napproach offers a very attractive solution to estimating canopy parameters since its aim is to \nprovide estimates without the need for ground calibration.  This area of research has \ncontributed much to the understanding of canopy reflectance (Jacquemoud & Baret, 1990; \nAndrieu et al., 1997).  However, it is not yet a practical solution since it first has to overcome \nthe implications of differences in genotype and phenological stage on canopy architecture \n(Baret, 2001b) leaf nutrient and water status, and atmospheric interaction (Baret, 2001a) on \nmodel behaviour.  For this approach to work, a vast database of respective model parameters \nmust be collected and continuously updated.  The interactions of crop management effects \nthrough the use of agrochemical inputs that modify the structure and reflectance properties of \na canopy, for example, the effect of using nitrogen, plant growth regulators, or fungicides, \nmust also be built into the canopy model processes and characterised in the database of model \nparameters. This was beyond the scope of this work where immediate integration into the \nfield management processes was important. \n \nThis study aims to develop a practical method of producing accurate maps of shoot \npopulation and GAI for integration into a larger five-year precision farming project funded by \nthe Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA).  The initial part of this paper reviews a field \nstudy to establish the fundamental relationship between normalised difference vegetation \nindex (NDVI) and shoot population in order to develop a calibration technique to produce \n  5\nmaps of canopy variables from NDVI images with minimal ground calibration.  From this, a \nrapid calibration protocol is proposed, evaluated and adopted for use over a four-year period.  \nExamples of the results of its application are presented. \n \n2. Technical approach \n2.1. Equipment \nRemotely sensed image data were collected using the aerial digital photographic (ADP) \nsystem, as shown in Fig. 1, comprising two Kodak DCS420 digital cameras (Graham, 1994) \nmounted in the base of a light aircraft\u2019s fuselage to provide vertical photography.  Optical \nband-pass filters were selected to correspond to the red and near-infrared bands and fitted in \nfront of each camera\u2019s 18 mm, optics respectively.  The red waveband was centred at 640 nm \nwith a band width at half the maximum transmission of 10.4 nm, and the near-infrared \nwaveband at 840 nm with a band width at half the maximum transmission of 11.7 nm.  Each \ncamera had a 13.8 mm by 9.2 mm charged-coupled device array exposed for 1\/125 second at \nan f-stop of 3.5.  Flown at 1000 m above ground level, the system produced a field-of-view of \nc. 500 m by 750 m, with a ground-pixel dimension of 0.5 m by 0.5 m.  Using a remote shutter \ntriggering mechanism, image pairs were acquired simultaneously and stored on two separate \nhard disks. \n \n2.2. Image processing \nThe R-NIR image pairs were geometrically co-registered to remove inherent mis-\nalignments caused by the cameras\u2019 slightly different view-points.  Typically, offsets were \nequivalent to between 5 m and 10 m on the ground.  The images were then geo-referenced to \nthe UK Ordnance Survey of Great Britain (OSGB) map coordinate system to within an \naccuracy of 1 m. \n  6\nThe NDVI is often calculated from derived reflectance values (Wiegand, et al., 1991; \nPrice, 1992), alternatively, it can be derived from radiance values or from raw digital number \n(DN) values (Goward et al., 1991) recorded by a sensor.  Although each method of \ncalculation leads to different NDVI values, they are linearly inter-correlated.  Full radiometric \ncalibration is only required if inter-comparisons of NDVI are to be made between different \ndates, between different sensors or between different solar zenith angles.  This work required \nonly the relative differences of the NDVI across localised areas \u2013 individual or adjacent \ngroups of agricultural fields.  The NDVI would be used for location-specific and date-specific \ncalibration by empirical relation with ground observations using a regression-based statistical \ncalibration procedure.  As such, the use of raw DNs for determining NDVI was appropriate \nand Eqn (2) was applied to each image to provide the basis for selecting appropriate \ncalibration sites to measure shoot density or GAI. \n \n    INDV = (\u03bbDN840 \u2013 \u03bbDN640) \/ (\u03bbDN840 + \u03bbDN640)       (2) \nwhere: INDV is the normalised difference vegetation index; and \u03bbDN640 and \u03bbNDN840 denote the \nuse of digital numbers measured at the red and near infrared spectral wavebands \n \n2.3. Statistical regression technique \nThe number of shoots in wheat and barley can be directly related to the number of \ndeveloped leaves (Kirkby, 1994) and, hence, to biomass and GAI.  Tucker (1979) has shown \nthat during the early phases of crop development the relationship between NDVI and \nbiophysical parameters such as GAI and biomass is linear.  According to Asrar et al., (1984) \nwhen the GAI reaches 4-5 the NDVI saturates, and the relationship becomes asymptotic. \n  7\nLinear regression was used to determine the relationship between airborne image NDVI \nimage values and ground-based measures of shoot density.  The parameters of the regression \nequation were used to provide the calibration coefficients used in Eqn (3): \n \nSxy = \u03b2\u0399NDVxy + \u03b1               (3) \n \nwhere Sxy is the estimate of shoot population in units of shoots m-2; and INDVxy is the \nequivalent image NDVI value at pixel co-ordinate (x,y); and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are regression \nparameters. The calibration equation can be applied to the NDVI image data to make \nestimates of shoot density at every pixel location in the field.  The associated standard error \n(SE) of the mean is used to produce the appropriate confidence intervals for the estimate. \n \nIt is important to note that genotype, phenological stage, tissue nutrient status, \natmospheric interactions, irradiance levels and the sun-sensor-target geometry could affect \nthe regression parameters. Thus, the regression parameters are expected to differ between \nimage acquisition dates, requiring each image-set to be calibrated individually. \n \n2.4. Shoot population \nShoot population is defined as a count of both the main stem and tillers (Tottman, 1987).  \nPopulations were counted in 0.5 m by 0.5 m quadrats.  The row spacing of cereal crops could \nvary between fields from 120 mm to 160 mm depending on the dimensions and settings of \nthe specific seed drill.  Hence, a field could have either four or five rows included in each \nquadrat measurement.  In this work, a standard number of rows were selected within each \nindividual field. \n \n  8\n3. Initial calibration procedure \nThe first ADP image (Fig. 2) was acquired on 5th May 1996 of a field of winter barley cv.  \nIntro (Hordeum vulgare L.).  Visual interpretation identified three levels of variation:  \n(1) a dominating striping effect between tramlines, attributed to an uneven application of \nnitrogen fertilizer from a spinning-disc spreader;  \n(2) a low-frequency, field-scale variation from east to west \u2013 somewhat masked by the \nstriping; and \n(3) localised crop damage attributed to grazing rabbits, glyphosate drift and possible slug \ndamage, all characterised by moderate to severe patches of bare soil. \n \nSample analyses were conducted at four sites, A, B, C and D, shown in Fig. 2, to quantify \nthe across field variation.  At each of these four sites a grid of 25 quadrats comprising a \nmatrix five positions each with five replications which were aligned as shown in Fig. 2.  \nThese were used to assess the localised variation and the between-tramline striping effect.  \nThe shoot population was measured in each of hundred 0.25 m2 quadrats.  The locations of \nthe sample sites were fixed by ground measurement relative to the tramline system, which \nwas clearly visible in the ADP images.  Equivalent NDVI values were extracted from the \nimages. \n \n3.1. Results of the initial calibration. \nThe relationship between the NDVI values derived by ADPand ground measurements of \nshoot population for the individual quadrat positions (four sites, each with 25 quadrats) in \nFig. 4 shows a significant linear trend (probability <0.001) with a standard error (SE) of 121 \nshoots m-2.  The coefficient of determination of 0.37 indicates a high degree of scatter about \n  9\nthe regression line, which is especially present at the low NDVI-shoot values taken from site \nD. \n \nThe cause of the scatter in site D (Fig. 2) arises due to a high degree of localised \nvariability in crop cover, coupled with a certain degree of error in locating quadrats positions \nin the field, estimated to be c. 1 m. \n \nThe effect of the scatter can be reduced significantly by spatially averaging measurements \nover a larger area.  This process also provides a better estimate of the local mean shoot \npopulation, reducing the errors introduced by edge-effects (Bloom et al., 1985) and counting \nerrors.  Averaging the \u2018replicates\u2019 at each site (Fig. 3) improved the regression to an \ncoefficient of determination of 0.74, whilst not affecting the overall relationship as shown in \nFig. 5.  Using parallel lines analysis (McConway et al., 1999) to test the statistical difference \nbetween the regression parameters of two or more lines, the effect of spatial averaging was \nshown to produce no significant difference (probability of 0.69).  By averaging all 25 \nquadrats at each site, the regression line was not significantly different to the position-level \nresults (probability of 0.61) and the coefficient of determination was improved to 0.99. \n \nThe above results show that a high proportion of the scatter in the relationship between \nNDVI and shoot population is attributable to highly localised variations in the crop canopy at \na scale where co-location of the NDVI observations with individual quadrat measurements is \nnot sufficiently accurate.  Also, the high number of samples renders the approach \nuneconomic for operational use presenting a need to investigate the potential for reducing the \nnumber of observations.  For practical precision farming purposes, highly localised crop \nvariation measured by individual quadrats is not feasible to manage and underlying larger \n  10\nscale trends are more important.  Thus localised averaging is justified to mask the small-scale \nvariation and the co-location errors. \n \nAt the replicate level five possible quadrats are available for averaging.  Figure 6 \npresents five regression lines based on the arithmetic means derived from including five, \nfour, three and two adjacent quadrats per replicate, it also includes the regression line based \non using only one quadrat per replicate.  Each regression is calculated with 18 degrees of \nfreedom.  The results indicate two distinct groupings: \u20181\u2019 and \u20182\u2019 fall into one group, and \u20183\u2019, \n\u20184\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 fall into another.  Compared to using five replicates, \u20184\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 are not \nsignificantly different (probabilities of 0.54 and 0.70, respectively); they also have a similar \nSE of c. 60 shoots m-2.  When using only two or one of the replicates, there is a much higher \nvariance and regression lines are significantly different (probability <0.05) with higher \nassociated SEs of 86 and 142 shoots m-2, respectively.  From this it was concluded that three \nreplicates (quadrats) can be used to estimate the local mean.  The sub-sample of three will be \nreferred to, hence, as a \u2018triplicate\u2019. \n \n4. Rapid calibration methodology \nThe previous section identified the appropriate use of local triplicates of quadrat \nobservations to assess crop parameters for correlation with ADP.  This section seeks the \nminimum number of observation sites.  Eqn (4) (Burt & Barber, 1996) shows that the \nstandard error (SE) of the regression estimate is a function of the degrees-of-freedom, and \nthat the number of samples required to achieve a certain SE can be determined theoretically, \nit was on this basis that the \u2018optimum\u2019 sample number was derived. \nFrom Eqn (4) it can be shown that eight calibration points provides an optimum number \nfor linear regression.  Assuming a constant variance, the effect of changing the number of \n  11\ncalibration points can be expressed as a factor of 1\/\u221an, where n is the sample number.  \nIncreasing the number above eight causes a marginal reduction in the SE (<1.0%); whereas, \nreducing the number below eight causes the SE to increase significantly.  The effect of \nreducing the sample size from 20 down to eight (triplicates) is now evaluated. \n2\n1\n2\u02c6\n\u2212\n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\nn\nn\ni\n)iYi(Y\nE       (4) \nwhere, E is the standard error;  Yi  represents each observed value of the dependent variable; \n\u0176i represents its estimate from the regression;  n is the sample number. \n \n4.1. Sample selection. \nGiven that five replicates are available for each \u2018position\u2019 (Fig. 3), three combinations of \ntriplicates are possible: \u20181-2-3\u2019, \u20182-3-4\u2019 and \u20183-4-5\u2019.  With five positions in each of four sites, \n60 possible calibration \u2018triplicates\u2019 are available for selection.  For this analysis, eight \ntriplicates were selected on the basis of their NDVI value if they satisfied the following \ncriteria. \n(1) Samples must not be spatially auto-correlated (Burt & Barber, 1996) and adjacent \npositions are avoided. \n(2) Samples must represent the complete range in NDVI values, and be equally spread over \nthat range. \n(3) Shoot averages derived from replicates \u20181-2-3\u2019, \u20182-3-4\u2019, or \u20183-4-5\u2019 are auto-correlated; \nif one of out the three is selected, the other two combinations are immediately removed \nfrom subsequent selections. \n(4) Similarly, each set of eight must be completely independent; once selected for one set \nof eight, a sample cannot be selected for a subsequent set. \n \n  12\nOn this basis, using the original data presented in Fig. 4, only two independent sets of eight \npoints are possible; these are referred to as \u2018set 1\u2019 and \u2018set 2\u2019. \n \n4.2. Rapid calibration results \nAs shown in Fig. 7, reducing the sample size from 20 to eight led to no significant \ndifference between regression lines (set 1, probability of 0.52; set 2, probability of 0.54).  \nBased on this result, the rapid field calibration protocol, given in Table 1, was proposed and \nused over the remaining four years of the project.  A total of 32 individual ADP calibration \nsurveys were completed at key growth stages in December (early tillering), February (late \ntillering), March-April (stem extension), and in May (anthesis). \n \nA summary of the ADP linear regression results are presented in Table 2 for both GAI \n(Fig. 9) and shoot population (Fig. 10).  As expected, the regression line parameters for each \ndate were different, but each had high values for the coefficients of determination (44% with \na coefficient of determination over 0.9; 72% over 0.8; and 85% over 0.7) and most had \nrelative standard errors between 10% and 15%. \n \nFields would ultimately be zoned into broad category ranges, e.g.  200-300 shoots m-2.  \nWith standard errors typically in the range of 50-150 shoots m-2, the regression results were \nconsidered satisfactory for image calibration in the context of practical precision farming \nmanagement.  Fig. 10, is an example, which shows the effects of deliberate changes in shoot \npopulation by varying seed rate.  The field is zoned in increments of 250 m-2 indicating shoot \npopulations less from than 250 shoots m-2 to in excess of 1300 shoots m-2. \n \n  13\n5. Extension to the farm-scale \nIn the initial calibration procedure, and for the duration of the project, the \u2018survey region\u2019 \nwas limited to the individual field.  If varieties are similar and grown under the same \nmanagement practices, then the same regression relationship could apply to extended blocks \nof adjacent or nearby fields.  This section investigates the use of a single regression line\u2019 for \nrelating NDVI with shoot population with the purpose of calibrating large blocks of fields. \n \n5.1. Methodology \nFollowing the procedure of the rapid calibration methodology, 11 fields of winter wheat, \ncv.  Consort and Rialto (Triticum aestivum) were surveyed.  On 19th April, 2000 an ADP \nsurvey was undertaken to capture a series of R-NIR images at c. 1 m pixel resolution.  The \naerial survey was flown in transects designed to provide overlapping imagery: 30% side-lap \nand 60% end-lap.  The survey was flown twice within minutes of each other to ensure a high \nprobability that individual fields were captured in a single frame with similar illumination \nconditions. \n \nImages were geo-referenced using digitised 1:25,000 map sheets, and Eqn (4) applied to \nindividual frames to calculate the NDVI for all fields.  Only one field required two images to \nbe mosaiced to produce a complete NDVI image of that field.  The remainder were contained \nwithin individual frames.  Radiometric balancing between frames was not performed since \nthe time interval between all image frames was minimal and extraneous factors could be \nassumed to be constant \u2013 the normalising effect of the NDVI would reduce errors introduced \nby extraneous factors (Baret & Guyot, 1991).  Field boundaries were digitised from the \nimages and used to extract NDVI images of all eleven fields as shown in Fig. 11. \n  14\n \nIn accordance with Table 1, after image acquisition and prior to ground surveying the \nfarm, eight calibration points were selected based on sample regions at two geographic \nscales: \n(1) field scale \u2013 eight points per field were selected in each of the 11 study fields; and \n(2) farm scale \u2013 eight points were selected to represent the whole farm, such that all 11 \nfields were treated as one single management block. \n \nIndividual regression lines were compared for statistical similarity both between fields and \nagainst the farm-scale regression using the technique of parallel lines analysis used earlier \n(McConway et al.  1999). \n \n5.2. Results of the farm-scale test \nThe individual regression lines for each field and at the farm-scale are plotted in Fig. 12.  \nThe results indicate a range in regression lines, which show that ten fields were not \nsignificantly different from the combined regression line, but one was, which is centred at \nOSGB 532750, 231000 shown in Fig. 11.  This field was characterised by a high level of \nmedium-scale crop variation attributed to the underlying field drainage system which, when \ncombined with a potential quadrat location error of c. 1 m, achieved when using differential \nglobal positioning systems, produced a high degree of scatter, resulting in a significantly \ndifferent regression (probability of 0.045).  As a result of the uncertainty associated with the \nestimation of the regression parameters within this one field, and that all other regression \nrelationships were not significantly different, there was evidence to propose a single, \nuniversal farm-scale regression independent of the two varieties \n \n  15\n To quantify the effect of varietal differences, all shoot population measurements were \nsplit into their respective varieties and regressed with NDVI as shown in Fig. 11.  This shows \nthat, despite Rialto having a higher value for the coefficient of determination and a lower SE \ncompared to Consort, the two regression lines were not significantly different (probability of \n0.51).  Pooling both varieties which did not significantly degrade the model fit, demonstrated \ncommonality between Consort and Rialto, in this case. \n \nIn comparing the \u2018full\u2019 farm-scale regression, using all points, with the farm-scale set of \neight in Fig. 14, the regression results were shown not to be significantly different \n(probability of 0.87). \nThe results above indicate a single farm-scale regression relationship with the possibility \nthat it can be estimated from only eight appropriately selected calibration points.  However, \nto fully evaluate whether the relationship between the farm-scale set of eight and the full farm \nscale regression is real, and not due to random chance, a statistical simulation study was \nconducted. \n \n5.3. Farm-scale simulation study. \nThe simulation study was conducted on 60 alternative sets of eight calibration points, \nextracted from the original 88 field measurements (eleven fields with eight points in each).  \nAll 88 data points were ranked by their NDVI value and grouped into eight equal-interval \nclasses and provided the basis for stratified, random sampling.  From each class in turn, \nsingle points were randomly selected to derive a new set of eight, and repeated 60 times to \nprovide the alternative sets of eight \u2013 out of a possible 118 combinations. \n \n  16\nThe individual regressions were then compared to the full farm-scale regression and \nassessed for statistical similarity.  Furthermore, to determine whether there were any practical \ndifferences between results, calibrated shoot maps were generated from each set of regression \nresults and zoned to produce a \u2018typical\u2019 nitrogen application map (Wood et al., 2002).  A \n\u2018definitive\u2019 map was derived using the full farm scale regression.  Each alternative map was \ncompared to determine the level of correspondence between zones using a measure of \n\u2018agreement\u2019 (Rosenfield & Fitzpatrick-Lins, 1986). \n \nIn addition, the \u2018full\u2019 regression was used to produce a definitive application map against \nwhich each \u2018new\u2019 application map would be assessed in terms of its level of agreement.  On \nthis basis, an assessment of the 60 combinations would provide a probability distribution \nindicating the likelihood of successful calibration when using only eight points. \n \n5.4. Results of the simulation \nBy stratifying the data points and constraining the selection to be representative of the \nfull range of NDVI, a high probability of statistical similarity could be expected along with a \ncorresponding high level of agreement between application maps.  The results indicated an \n83% probability of statistical similarity and a 73% probability that calibration would produce \na coefficient of agreement greater than 80%.  In reviewing the remaining 20-25%, it was \nshown that these data sets comprised points with a poor geographical spread.  In order to \navoid this, a further constraint would be to limit one calibration point per field. \n \nOut of the 60 sets of eight, only 3 satisfied these criteria: the original set of eight selected \nprior to the farm visit, and two others, referred to as set 1 and set 2 as given in Fig. 15.  When \ncalibrated, the respective treatment maps had coefficients of agreement of 99%, 76% and \n  17\n96%.  Since this data set is limited, only tentative conclusions can be drawn.  However, these \nresults indicate that there is an opportunity to move to a rapid farm-scale calibration \nprocedure with a 75-99% accuracy. \n \n6. Applications \nThe results presented here demonstrate a practicable means of providing accurate and cost \neffective shoot population and GAI maps, where the cost is estimated by Godwin et al.  \n(2002) to be \u00a37 ha-1 for acquiring the ADP images and for undertaking the necessary ground \ncalibration.  As such, the approach is suitable for adoption within the agricultural \nmanagement sector and more specifically for precision farming management. \n \nThe benefits of using calibrated images for wheat management has been shown by Wood \net al.  (2002) to reach \u00a360 ha-1.  This was achieved by using calibrated ADP images at early \ngrowth stages (shoot density in early March, and GAI in late March and April) to monitor the \nprogress of wheat canopy growth and comparing the status at each date to pre-defined \nbenchmark targets for management published by the HGCA (1998).  Areas over, under or on-\ntarget had fertilizer nitrogen levels adjusted accordingly.  Using a more simplistic \nmanagement approach of adjusting fertilizer nitrogen according to relative differences, \nindicated in the calibrated images, was shown by Welsh et al. (2002a) to improve gross \nmargin benefits by up to \u00a323 ha-1 in barley, and up to \u00a330 ha-1 in wheat (Welsh et al.,  \n2002b). These figures are net margin benefits with the cost of calibrated imagery taken into \naccount. \n \nIn a report published by Berry et al.  (1998), 91% of 340 surveyed fields exhibited some \ndegree of lodging, resulting in 16% of the total area lodged costing the UK wheat industry \n  18\n\u00a360 million through lost yield, and a further \u00a360 million through lost bread making premium, \ngrain drying costs and delayed harvest.  The report adds that, although a variety of weather, \ncrop and soil factors can influence lodging, variation in the structure of wheat crops \u2013 \nincluding shoots density and GAI \u2013 influenced the risk of lodging.  Calibrated ADP images \ncould, therefore, serve as a predictive tool for lodging risk and used in conjunction with \nvariable-rate plant growth regulators and variable nitrogen to control lodging. \n \nImages can also be used as a diagnostic.  Referring back to Figure 8 shows a GAI map \nwith a distinct low GAI area dominating the field with contrasting linear features of higher \nGAI corresponding to the tile drain system.  A failure in the mole drain system led to severe \nwaterlogging with only those areas directly overlying the tile drains benefiting from free \ndrainage.  The northern corner of the field, which occupies a marginally higher elevation, had \na GAI > 2.0, which represents the condition that the whole field should have been in to \nrealise its full yield potential.  In conjuction with combine yield data, the image was used to \nidentify the worst affected areas which suffered yield penalties of up to 3 t ha-1, which could \nhave been rectified for a one off cost of \u00a350 ha-1 (Nix, 2000) for re-moling the site and \nclearing blocked drain outlets which could have an economic life in excess of 5 years. \n \nWeeds present a problem to the calibration process because they contribute an added \nreflectance signal that cannot be de-coupled from the crop reflection resulting in over-\nestimation of shoot density or GAI.  The affect on calibration accuracy resulting from \ndifferent degrees of weed presence was not investigated, although it should be normal \nmanagement practice to maintain a clean crop and avoid weed problems.  However, weeds \nare persistant and remote sensing can offer a means of assisting in mapping them for the \npurposes of patch spraying (Godwin & Miller, 2002).  The development of patch spraying \n  19\nsystems such as that described by Miller et al. (1998) provide systems that could deliver a \nvariable rate volume application with a 5:1 range but with no change in spray quality.  Based \non a time sequence of ADP images within a growing season, a patch of weeds will manifest \nitself as an anomolous area of high NDVI values, increasing over time at a rate greater than \nexpected for normal crop growth.  Equally, a late senescence image will reveal patches of \nsummer weeds, which, although may not affect yields as greatly as winter or spring weeds, \nmay interfer with the harvesting of the crop.  Over a number of years a series of images will \nalso reveal patches of weeds that have been shown to be stable for some grass weeds as \nreported in Godwin and Miller (2002). \n \nMaps of canopy density provide an additional opportunity for targeting more efficient \nuse of foliar fungicides.  Bjerre and Secher (1998) state that although the appropriate dosage \nto control diseases can vary according to a combination of the disease incidence and \nphysiological response of the plant to light conditions and nutritional status, the efficacy of \nthe treatment is related to the concentration of the active ingredient on the leaf surface and, \ntherefore, related to the leaf area index at the time of application.  In their experiments Bjerre \nand Secher adjusted the dose of fungicide in proportion to the canopy density using previous \nyears\u2019 yield maps as a surrogate estimate of the current year\u2019s canopy density since they had \nno means of measuring this for the current crop.  Their work showed positive results although \nthey acknowledged that historic yield data is a poor surrogate for estimating shoot density \nand spectral reflectance from vehicle mounted sensors (and potentially ADP could be used in \nthe same way) could privide a basis for varying fungicide doses within a field. \n  20\n7. Conclusions \nThe relationship between the normalised difference vegetation index and ground \nmeasurements of shoot population or green area index, in wheat and barley, shows a linear \ntrend at crop growth stages up to the end of stem extension (GS39).  Modelling the trend by \nlinear regression is greatly improved by spatially averaging measurements over localised \ngeographic areas rather than at single-point locations. \n \nThree 0.25 m2 quadrat replicates are needed for localised averaging.  Increasing the \nnumber of quadrats to four or five shows no significant improvement in the subsequent \nregression, whereas reducing this number to two or one produces erroneous results due to a \ngreater chance of including anomolies such as localised crop damage. \n \nTo derive the regression parameters for calibration, eight points were shown to provide \nan optimum standard error of the estimate whilst retaining the robustness of the regression \nrelationship.  The eight points were chosen to represent the range in the NDVI present in a \nfield and had a good geographic distribution, with local sub-samples of three quadrats.  This \nformed the basis of the rapid calibration approach methodology. \n \nOver the duration of four years\u2019 repeated application, the rapid calibration methodology \nprovided satisfactory results for the requirements of practical crop management, with over \n85% having a value of the coefficient of determination greater than 0.7 and relative standard \nerrors of 10-15%. \n \n  21\nFor groups of adjacent or nearby fields grown in single management units \u2013 similar \nvarieties, sowing date and cultural practice \u2013 it may be possible to use a single regression line \nto calibrate all fields.  In this study, winter wheat was tested and only two varieties were \navailable, Consort and Rialto, which exhibited the same regression relationship.  Other, \nsmaller shoot-sized varieties could exhibit different a relationship and should be considered \nseperately before pooling measurements over blocks of mixed varieties. \n \nProviding the selection of calibration sites is constrained to represent the range in NDVI \nwith sites having a good geographic distribution and seperation, there is an 80-95% \nprobability that random selection of sites should produce both stable regression lines and \nstable management maps (75-99% accuracy). \n \nWhether the field or the \u2018management block\u2019 is the sample region, the sampling protocol \nis otherwise the same. \n(1) Zone the field into eight equal ranges of NDVI. \n(2) Within each zone, randomly select one calibration site, to provide eight sites in total. \n(3) On choosing sites, ensure that each one is geographically distinct and, together, \nrepresent the whole sample region (i.e. field or block). \n(4) At each calibration site, ground sample shoot density or GAI using three 0.25 m2 \nquadrats arranged in a triangle with sides of 2 m; the three will provide a single site \naverage. \n \nSince individually fields will be visited periodically for crop scouting or management \npurposes, the requirement to make measurements at one site per field, for eight fields, \nprovides a manageable and quick exercise for the farmer, agronomist or technician.  \n  22\nespecially considering the enormous value that such management information will provide to \nthe grower.  At a cost of \u00a37 ha-1 and potential benefits of up to \u00a360 ha-1, the use of calibrated \nremotely sensed data for precision farming management offers a very attractive approach to \ncereal production. \n \n  23\nReferences \nAndrieu B; Baret F; Jacquemoud S; Malthus T; Steven M (1997).
