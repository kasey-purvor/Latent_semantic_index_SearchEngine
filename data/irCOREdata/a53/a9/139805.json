References \nAbstract \nBiomass is a renewable class of materials of growing interest amongst researchers aiming to \nachieve global sustainability. This review focuses on the homogeneous catalysis of the \noxidation of biomass, in particular starch, cellulose and lignin. Often such catalytic reactions \nlead to depolymerisation of the material as happens in Nature with for example brown rot \nfungi. This depolymerisation can be desirable or not, and control in industrial applications is \nthus important to obtain the desired outcome. The two main oxidants in use are O2 and H2O2 \nand their use is described as appropriate. Industrial oxidation catalysis is highly significant in \nthe bleaching of cellulose-containing materials due to its high volume application in the paper, \npulp and laundry industries. Here, the presence of a ligand on the oxidising metal ion has a \nsignificant effect on the catalyst selectivity and stability. In addition to the bleaching of \ncellulose-containing materials, the oxidation of cellulose, starch, lignin and lignin model \ncompounds are discussed with a focus on generating even more hydrophilic materials which \nhave important applications or materials which may be further modified. Finally developing \napplications of biomass are described such as new support materials for catalysts, as supports \nfor sensors and nanomaterials for microbial culture. \nKeywords  \nBiomass; starch; cellulose; lignin; catalysis; oxidation  \n1.1. Introduction  \nRenewable biomass presents tremendous opportunities to produce chemicals as fossil fuels \nbecome more expensive due to dwindling reserves and political conflict. As a consequence, \nnew methods and materials based on biomass refining are emerging for the chemical industry \nto use as feedstock [1]. In recent years the concept of developing a biorefinery to produce \nfeedstock for the modern chemical industry has been growing in popularity [2].  \nThe largest material by volume produced in the world every year is ligno-cellulose (typically \ncontaining 40\u221250 wt % cellulose, 10-25 wt % hemi-cellulose, and 25-40 wt % lignin), which \nprovides strength to trees and plants. The important challenge remains of how to convert \nPage 3 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n3 \n \nligno-cellulose into a form that can be exploited as a fundamental building block in a wide \nrange of chemical transformations [3].  \nStarch and cellulose can be used as feedstock for oxygenated materials or could even be \nreduced to give petroleum-like starting materials. Lignin could be used as a source for \naromatic compounds if it can be depolymerised in a controlled fashion. Similarly, in modern \nmaterials research natural fibres are studied extensively to form composites as are renewable \nmonomers [4,5]. Polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose, are a potential renewable \nsource of materials particularly for biodegradable polymers [6], wastewater treatment [7] and \nfunctional nanomaterials [8]. Lignin has to date found only limited uses but its potential as \nthe only renewable aromatic compound source available in large volumes continues to attract \na vast amount of work to make this possible [5].  \nIn addition to their applicability as feedstock for monomers and polymers, and as fibres, \nmany polysaccharides can also be used as a source for renewable nanoparticles. These \npolysaccharides are naturally found in a semicrystalline state, and aqueous acids can be \nemployed to hydrolyze the amorphous sections of the polymer. Consequentially, the \ncrystalline sections, having dimensions in the nanometre range, are released, resulting in \nindividual monocrystalline nanoparticles [9]. The obtained particles display different shapes \ndepending on the polysaccharide source: platelets for starch and rigid rod-like particles for \ncellulose and chitin. These nanoparticles are receiving increasing attention because of the \nabundant availability of the starting material, low cost, renewability, biodegradability, \nbiocompatibility, and nontoxicity [10]. While the use of these nanoparticles has largely \nfocussed on the fabrication of nanocomposites where their function is largely as \nreinforcement, other uses as functional nanomaterials after surface modification, templating \nmaterial, and structural material are also emerging [8,9,11].  \nIn recent years, the importance of environmentally benign synthesis has been increasingly \nrecognized and parameters, such as the E-factor [12], atom efficiency[13] and the \u201c12 \nPrinciples of Green Chemistry\u201d [14] are often considered as an essential driving force in the \nquest for sustainable chemical processes. Renewable biomass and solvents are key \ncomponents in making a process greener as is improved catalytic activity. In addition, if a \nsolvent has to be used, water would represent a best choice. It is cheap, readily available, \nnon-toxic, non-flammable and safe for the environment. Of additional importance to catalysis \nis that water allows for facile catalyst separation and recycling through a biphasic catalysis \nPage 4 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n4 \n \nprocess due to its low miscibility with most organic compounds [15]. Additionally, oxidised \nbiomass is frequently isolated via a simple filtration process. \nThe oxidation of biomass is often performed in water as a medium which is perhaps a less \ncommon solvent for chemists [16] and represents a number of challenges when employing \ncoordination compounds as catalysts. In particular, the water will compete as a ligand and \nfunctional catalysts based on manganese and iron complexes of common ligands such as \npolyamines and polyethers often have limited utility because of the thermodynamic sink \nrepresented by the mineral forms of these elements [17]. Fortunately, transition metal \ncomplexes can be effectively used in water when careful ligand design is employed to \nimprove the stability, particularly under oxidising conditions [18].  \nIn this special issue celebrating the career of Daryle H. Busch, it is appropriate here to \nhighlight the successful work of Busch and co-workers in showing the power of careful \nligand design in the realisation of a series of robust transition metal complexes with ultra \nrigid ethylene cross-bridged tetradentate macrocyclic ligands[19] and cross-bridged \npentadentate amine macrocyclic ligands (Figure 1) [20]. Also the cross-bridged tetradentate \nmacrocyclic complexes have the rare abilities to host stable Mn\n4+\n=O and Mn\n4+\n-OH functional \ngroups [21]. Compared with other ligands, these cross-bridged macrocycles produce Mn\n2+\n \ncomplexes having extreme kinetic stability in both acidic and basic media, despite the well-\nknown lability of the high-spin d\n5\n Mn\n2+\n ion [22]. The complexes have rich redox chemistries \nand an industrial partner has demonstrated their excellent catalytic oxidation activity in \ndemanding applications, for example in home-care products [23]. These complexes also \ncatalyse organic oxidations in mixed organic-aqueous media, [19c,21a,21b] such as hydrogen \nabstraction by the mononuclear manganese(IV) complex [Mn(Me2EBC)2(OH)2]\n2+\n (EBC = \nEthylene Bridged Cyclam = 4,11-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane).  \n \nFigure 1 Cross-bridged (a) tetradentate and (b) pentadentate amine macrocyclic complexes of enhanced \nsolution stability used by Busch and coworkers in bleaching experiments [19,20]. \n \n1.2. The structures of cellulose, starch and lignin \nCellulose forms the primary component of green plants and of wood. It is the most \nabundantly available natural material and Nature produces between 10\n10\n and 10\n11\n tons of \nPage 5 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n5 \n \ncellulose annually. Cellulose is a linear homopolysaccharide of D-glucopyranose units linked \nthrough \u03b2-(1,4) linkages [Figure 2(A)]. The degree of polymerisation of cellulose depends \nstrongly on the plant species but is around 10,000 for wood and 15,000 for cotton. Natural \ncellulose is a semicrystalline polymer with crystalline sections formed by polymer alignment \nand held together by strong hydrogen bonding (in-plane) and Van der Waals interactions \n(between planes). There are 4 different allomorphs for cellulose: cellulose I (I\u03b1 and I\u03b2), \ncellulose II, cellulose III (IIII and IIIII) and cellulose IV (IVI and IVII), and they can easily be \ntransformed from one form to another by chemical treatment [24]. While cellulose III is \nthermodynamically the most stable form, it is cellulose I which is most commonly found in \nNature. The I\uf061 allomorph is predominant in primitive organisms, while I\uf062 is the predominant \nallomorph in higher plants. I\uf062 can also be obtained from I\uf061 by water treatment at 260-280\no\nC \nfor 15-30 min [25]. Often found in cell-walls accompanying cellulose is hemicellulose, which \nis a term first used by Schulze [26]. This group of polysaccharides is obtained by extracting \nmaterials containing cell-walls with alkali. Hemicelluloses have a random amorphous \nstructure and are comprised of several polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans; (1\u21923) and \n(1\u21924)-\u03b2-glucans, xyloglucans, pectins, and gluco- and galacto-mannans [27].  \nStarch is a naturally occurring blend of two polymers: Amylose and Amylopectin. Both are \n\uf061-D-glucopyranose polymers. For standard starches, the amylose to amylopectin ratio varies \nfrom 1:4 to 1:2 [28]. \u201cAmylose-rich\u201d and \u201cwaxy\u201d starch varieties are enriched in amylose and \namylopectin respectively. Amylose is a linear homopolysaccharide formed with D-\nglucopyranose units linked together with \u03b1-(1,4) linkages [See Figure 2(B-i)]. The average \ndegree of polymerisation (DP) of amylose is between 300 and 25,000 and the exact DP \ndepends on the botanical origin of the starch. Amylopectin is a branched homopolysaccharide \nformed with D-glucopyranose units. The rate of branching is about 4\u20135 % (every 20 units). In \neach chain, units are linked by \u03b1-(1,4) linkages; the side-chains are linked to the main chain \nthanks to \u03b1-(1,6) linkages [See Figure 2(B-ii)]. The number of glucosyl units is between 105 \nand 10\n9\n, but, again, depends on the botanical origin of starch. Starch a is a semicrystalline \npolymer found in three different allomorphs: the A allomorph is found in cereals, the B \nallomorph is found in tubers, while the C allomorph is found in legumes, roots, fruits and is \nactually a combination of both A and B allomorphs [29]. The crystalline sections are formed \nby alignment of the side-chains of amylopectin alongside the backbone. The crystallinity is \nthus affected by the amylopectin content and both the extent and length of branching. \nPage 6 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n6 \n \n \nFigure 2 The Structures of (A) cellulose, (B) starch consisting of (i) amylose and (ii) amylopectin as \nproposed by Nimtz [35]. \n \nLignin is the second most abundant, naturally occurring macromolecule following cellulose. \nIt is found as cell-wall component in all vascular plants and in the woody stems of \narborescent angiosperms (hardwoods) and gymnosperms (softwoods) and thus coexists with \ncellulose [30]. As lignin is largely hydrophobic and cellulose is hydrophilic, compatibility is \nobtained through hemicelluloses, which contains both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections. \nThe lignin content in woody stems varies between 15 and 40% where it acts as water sealant \nin the stems and plays an important part in controlling water transport through the cell-wall. It \nalso protects plants against biological attack by hampering enzyme penetration. Finally, \nlignin also acts as permanent glue, binding cells together in the woody stems, and thus giving \nthe stems their well-known rigidity and impact resistance. \n \nFigure 3 Primary precursors of lignin: (a) trans-p-coumaryl alcohol, (b) trans-coniferyl alcohol, and (c) \ntrans-sinapyl alcohol \n \nAnselme Payen discovered lignin in 1838 during the treatment of wood with nitric acid and \nalkaline solutions [31]. These treatments yielded an insoluble fraction designated cellulose, \nand a soluble fraction which he called incrustant. This soluble material was later named \n\u201clignin\u201d by Schulze [32]. Lignin is generally defined as polymeric natural products arising \nfrom an enzyme-initiated dehydrogenative polymerisation of three primary precursors: trans-\nconiferyl, trans-sinapyl and trans-p-coumaryl alcohol [30]. Structures are shown in Figure 3. \nLignin is normally used to address the lignin extracted from wood, while proto-lignin is used \nfor lignin still associated with cells. The enzyme-initiated polymerisation results in bonds of \nexceptional stability: biphenyl carbon-carbon linkages between aromatic carbons, alkyl-aryl \ncarbon-carbon linkages between an aliphatic and aromatic carbon, and hydrolysis-resistant \nether linkages. The only linkage which is relatively weak and hydrolysable is the \uf061-aryl ether \nbond (identified in Figure 4). The stable linkages make lignin very resistant against \ndegradation and harsh pulping conditions are therefore needed if one wants to hydrolyse the \nother, more stable, ether bonds. The plant type determines the relative amounts of the \nPage 7 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n7 \n \nrespective precursors and thus the final structure of lignin. However, due to the similar base \nstructure of the lignin precursors, every lignin molecule consists of sequence of phenyl-\npropane units. Lignins are divided into two major classes: guaiacyl and guaiacyl-syringyl \nlignins [33]. The guaiacyl lignins include the majority of gymnosperm lignins, while all \nangiosperm and herbaceous lignins belong to the guaiacyl-syringyl lignin class [34]. This \ndivision is not absolute as different lignins can coexist, even within the same plant. As can be \ndeduced from the class names, guaiacyl lignins only contain p-hydroxyphenyl propane (no \u2013\nOCH3 on the aromatic ring, from trans-p-coumaryl inclusion) and guaiacyl propane units \n(one \u2013OCH3 group on the aromatic ring from trans-coniferyl), while the guaiacyl-syringyl \nlignins also contain syringyl propane units (two -OCH3 on the aromatic ring from trans-\nsinapyl). Figure 4 represents the structure of beech lignin as proposed by Nimtz [35].\uf020\n \nFigure 4 The Structure of lignin from Beech as proposed by Nimtz [35]. Examples of the least stable \uf061-\naryl ether bonds are identified by the dotted circles. \n \n1.3. The natural oxidation of biomass \nNatural enzymes demonstrate excellent efficiency and exquisite selectivity through the use of \nseveral metal ions as at the active sites of cellulose [36] and amylase [37]. Focussing on \nbiomass, Nature degrades wood via an oxidative cleavage with white rot fungi (i.e. through \nthe use of the multinuclear copper laccases) and brown rot fungi (e.g. via the use of iron \noxalate complexes). Although the exact mechanisms are still contentious and most likely \ninvolve contributions from several species [38]. For instance, the recent genome, \ntranscriptome, and secretome analysis of the wood decay fungus Postia placenta supports a \nunique mechanisms of lignocellulose conversion [39], involving the upregulation during \ngrowth on cellulose medium of putative iron reductases, quinone reductase, and structurally \ndivergent oxidases probably leading to the extracellular generation of Fe\n2+\n and H2O2. \nFurthermore it is intriguing that in brown rot fungi metal-chelating compounds (e.g. oxalate, \ncatecholate and hydroxamate) are observed which have been suggested to complex in \nparticular iron in preference to any potential ligands within the wood itself. The formation of \niron chelates further alters the redox chemistry of the iron so that in the presence of H2O2 the \niron chelate complex catalyses Fenton oxidation chemistry involving the production of \nPage 8 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n8 \n \nhydroxyl radicals as the oxidising species and the rapid depolymerisation of cellulose which \nis a distinguishing feature of brown-rot [40].  \nLignin is the largest renewable source of aromatic polymer in Nature but is chemically \nrecalcitrant to breakdown by most organisms because of its complicated heterogeneous \nstructure. White-rot fungi produce a series of extracellular oxidative enzymes that in \ncombination efficiently degrade lignin [41]. The major groups of lignolytic enzymes include \nlignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, and laccases. The peroxidases are heme-\ncontaining enzymes with catalytic cycles that involve the activation by H2O2 and substrate \nreduction of the enzyme intermediates known as compound I and compound II. The \nformation of compound I is the initial step of the reaction mechanism of plant heme \nperoxidises [42]. This intermediate stores two oxidizing equivalents from H2O2 as an \noxyferryl iron center and a radical, either on the porphyrin ring or on a tryptophan residue \n[43]. An acid\u2013base mechanism operates in heme peroxidase during the formation of \ncompound I. Furthermore it is now commonly viewed that the conserved distal histidine in \nthe active site of heme peroxidases is the acid\u2013base catalyst that promotes the heterolytic \ncleavage of H2O2.  \nLignin peroxidases have the unique ability to catalyze oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds and \nether (C-O-C) bonds in non-phenolic aromatic substrates of high redox potential. Manganese \nperoxidises [44] oxidize Mn\n2+\n to Mn\n3+\n, which enables the degradation of phenolic \ncompounds or, in turn, oxidizes a second redox mediator e.g. veratryl alcohol (3,4-\ndimethoxybenzyl alcohol) or 2-chloro-1,4-dimethoxybenzene, for the breakdown of non-\nphenolic compounds. Laccases are multi-copper-containing proteins [45] that catalyze the \noxidation of phenolic substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. A \nphysiological role has been suggested for the laccase-catalysed Mn\n2+\n oxidation in providing \nH2O2 for extracellular oxidation reactions thereby demonstrating a novel type of laccase-MnP \ncooperation relevant to the biodegradation of lignin [46].  \n1.4. Applications of oxidised cellulose \nOxidised cellulose in various forms has been investigated for use in numerous applications. \nSince oxidised cellulose is completely bioresorbable and readily degrades under \nphysiological conditions, it is widely used in medical applications such as absorbable \nhemostatic scaffolding materials [47,48] and as a postsurgical adhesion prevention layer [49], \nPage 9 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n9 \n \nbut also as carrier material for agricultural, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications [50,51]. \nA blend of oxidised cellulose with vitamin E has been patented for topical hemostatic \napplications in which it was claimed that oxidised cellulose shows bactericidal effects against \na wide range of pathogenic microorganisms [52]. Other bioactive materials such as pain \nrelievers and growth promoters could be included in the wound dressing for additional \nbenefit. Oxidised cellulose fibres have been claimed to be better blood clotting agents than is \noxidised regenerated cellulose [53]. Oxidised cellulose is also a safe and effective treatment \nfor moderate tubal hemorrhage during laparoscopic sterilisation of women and for small \nuterine perforations [54,55]. Osseous regeneration is at least as fast using oxidised cellulose \nas with collagen, the most widely used material at current, making oxidised cellulose an \ninteresting scaffolding material [47]. While most of these uses are promising, there have also \nbeen reports where the use of oxidised cellulose during operation appears to have induced \ninflammation at the surgical site and even beyond [56]. \nThe use of oxidised cellulose in the form of filter sheets and as an ion-exchange column filler \nresulted in an effective method to remove metal ions from water and aqueous environments \n[57]. The affinity of oxidised cellulose for metal ions followed the following order: \nCd\n2+\n,Zn\n2+\n>Ni\n2+\n>>Ca\n2+\n>Mg\n2+\n>>Na\n+\n. The potential of oxidised cellulose to act as an ion \nexchange material has been recognized early on with over 500 papers published on this \nsubject in 1971 [58]. The oxidised cellulose materials have been used to purify and \nfractionate proteins, including enzymes, hemoglobins, hormones serum protein viruses and \nseed proteins. Oxidised cellulose has also been used in the chromatography of peptides, \nnucleic acids, nucleotides, amino acids, alkaloids and metallic ions [58].  \n1.5. Applications of oxidised starch \nMany chemical oxidations of starch are known, e.g. wet-, semi-dry and dry-oxidation with all \nof these having been well documented [59]. Recently, the enzyme laccase in combination \nwith TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidinyl-1-oxyl radical) as a mediator has been used to \noxidise starch selectively at the primary hydroxyl groups [60]. Oxidised starch (European \nfood additive number E1404) has found significant applications in the food, paper and textile \nsector. In the food sector, oxidised starch, with or without pregelatinization, is used as a \ntexturiser in dairy products, batter and coating, as a binder in snacks, batter and confectionary \nand as a film-former in confectionary [61]. It is especially useful in the production of dry \npowder for instant preparation powders for puddings, fruit dessert and jelly. The wide appeal \nPage 10 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n10 \n \nof starch in food products is due to its ability to change texture, body, appearance and flavour \nat the same time [62]. Starch can vary texture from grainy to smooth and from cohesive \n(gummy or slimy) to gelled. Oxidised starch is a potential replacement for gum Arabic (also \nknown as acacia gum and European food additive number E414) in film forming applications \nfor food applications. An example of this was seen when corn and amaranth starch were \noxidised using sodium hypochlorite as oxidant and MgCl2 as catalyst [63]. Oxidised starch \n(using sodium hypochlorite) is also used in large quantities in the paper and textile industries \ndue to its bright white colour, easy gelatinisation and high solubility. Its use as a coating \nagent in the paper industry dates from the early part of the 1900s [64]. It is currently used \ntogether with other coating agents such as titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, casein, \npolyvinyl alcohol, etc [65].  \nNearly every kind of starch has been used in textile finishing, but due to the increased cost of \noxidising starch, oxidised starch is only used when this cost increase is compensated for by \nimproved performance [64]. For example, high fluidity and stable flow properties allow high \nsolution loading and thus, higher add-on during processing. Its adsorption to the fibre surface \nresults in an elastic film providing protection against the mechanical action of high speed \nlooms. Oxidised starch can also be used as a laundry finish as a liquid or a dry powder [64]. \n1.6. Applications of oxidised lignin \nOxidising lignin to render it more useful is an interesting approach given the well established \nanti-oxidant properties of lignin [66]. There exist however specific lignin-oxidising enzymes \nthat could be used as an alternative to bleach or chemocatalytic oxidation [67]. Oxidised \nlignin, just like oxidised cellulose and starch, shows a high chelating capability that can be \nused for heavy metal removal from polluted effluent streams [68]. Enzymatically oxidised \nlignin [from acetosolv (i.e. from continuous extraction with acetic acid) and ethanol-water \nextraction processes]  exhibits better sequestration of Cu\n2+\n than non-oxidised lignin while \noxidised ethanol\/water extracted lignin was better than oxidised acetosolv lignin [69]. \nOxidation of lignin may also render it more dispersible in water, opening up uses as a \nflocculant, dispersants or binders; currently this is reserved for water-soluble high-sulphur \ncontaining lignosuphonates [70]. Selective and controlled oxidation of lignin however would \nbe extremely valuable as it is believed to be the only economically viable stream of \nrenewable aromatic compounds for large scale production. \n2. Cellulose oxidation \nPage 11 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n11 \n \nThe oxidation of cellulose is extremely important [47-58]. The bleaching of cellulose-\ncontaining materials is widely used in industry to remove coloured substances and commonly \nuses hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorites as oxidising media [71]. The use of hypochlorites \nproduces stoichiometric amounts of chlorides, such that greener, more atom efficient methods \nare desirable. Various other methods have been investigated. Some of these are hardly \ngreener (e.g. the use of dichromate or hypobromite). In this section, we will describe various \nstudies that have been carried out which use more benign catalysts and reagents to oxidise \ncellulose.  \n2.1. Bleaching of cellulose-containing materials \nBefore the use of starch- and cellulose-containing materials in products e.g. textiles, paper or \npulp, the materials are generally bleached and the efficiency of this process is strongly \naffected by any transition metal ions present [72]. This catalytic oxidation will further yield \nan increased number of functional groups in addition to the, mainly, hydroxyl groups on the \nsurface of cellulose, i.e. aldehydes and carboxylic acids, which creates opportunities for \nfurther functionalisation of the oxidised materials. Consequently the hydrophilic or \nhydrophobic properties of the material may be significantly altered. There is also the potential \nfor depolymerisation to occur during such bleaching processes leading to weaker fibres. Mg\n2+\n \nions are believed to protect carbohydrate groups during the bleaching of pulp, and thus it is \ndesirable to retain a proportion of the Mg\n2+\n ions that are naturally present [73]. \nTransition metal catalysts have been extensively studied in the activation of oxidants for the \ncleaning of laundry and in dishwashers [74]. This bleaching action is mainly directed to \ndestroy unwanted stains on the fabric (i.e. cotton fibres with cellulose as the main component) \nin order to achieve the intended cleaning effect without oxidative damage of the cellulose. In \na second application, the bleaching may be applied to destroy dyes released from a fabric into \nsolution, so as to prevent unwanted dye transfer between fabrics. The bleaching of stains can \nbe considered as a heterogeneous process while the bleaching of migrating dyes is basically a \nhomogeneous oxidation reaction.  \nIron and manganese catalysts tend to be the most frequently studied metals in laundry \napplications due to their acceptable environmental and toxicological properties. It is perhaps \nunsurprising that Nature too makes widespread use of these metals for its oxidation catalysts.  \nHowever in Nature these active sites are present within the protective coating of the rest of \nthe enzyme, while in simple coordination catalysts they are more exposed to the reaction \nPage 12 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n12 \n \nmedia. Consequently, a frequent failure of catalysts under laundry conditions is due to the \npoor thermodynamic complex stability resulting in fast decomposition to form iron \nhydroxides or manganese dioxide under the alkaline conditions. Moreover the oxidative \nrobustness of the ligand under the oxidising conditions is often low. The selectivity of the \ncatalysis is also a key aspect as it is highly desirable to avoid catalysis of Fenton type \nchemistry that would yield the non-selective but highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Similarly \nit is important to limit the catalase activity of any added catalysts with H2O2 as this is \nwasteful of the oxidant [75].  \n \nFigure 5 Chelating ligands used in studies on the generation of hydroxyl radicals and the bleaching of \ncellulose by metal ions and H2O2. \n \nRecently, under alkaline conditions hydroxyl radical generation from H2O2 was determined \nby a spin-trapping EPR technique with DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) for the \nseries of transition metals Cr\n3+\n, Mn\n2+\n, Fe\n2+\n, Co\n2+\n, Ni\n2+\n and Cu\n2+\n[76]. At pH 10, Cu\n2+\n was the \nonly metal ion to generate a considerable amount of hydroxyl radicals. It is generally \nobserved that by forming a chelate complex the redox chemistry of a metal ion can be \ndramatically altered. Consequently, Fe\n2+\n and Cu\n2+\n in the presence of Na4EDTA \n(ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, tetrasodium salt), Na4IDS (sodium iminodisuccinate), \nNa3DTPMP (diethylenetriamine pentamethylphosphonic acid, trisodium salt) and Na3EDDS \n(S,S-ethylenediamine disuccinnic acid, trisodium salt) (Figure 5) were similarly studied. Cu\n2+ \ncomplexes with\n \nNa4EDTA and Na4IDS yielded hydroxyl radicals whilst the other two \nchelates inhibited its generation. Fe\n2+ \ncomplexes with\n \nNa4EDTA, Na3DTPMP and Na4IDS \nenhance hydroxyl radical generation whilst complexes with Na3EDDS do not. Furthermore in \nmodel cellulose fabric damage experiments (i.e. using mixed polyester-cotton swatches with \nH2O2 at 90\u00b0C) similar results were reported for Cu\n2+\n when compared to the generation of \nhydroxyl radicals. However, experiments with Fe\n2+ \ngave a similar % weight loss in the \nabsence or presence of a chelating ligand. This latter observation was explained by a \ndifference in the time-scales of the experimental procedure between the homogeneous EPR \nand the heterogeneous cellulose damage experiments. It is noteworthy in this context that \nFe\n2+\n is more likely to hydrolyse, oxidise and displays lower stability constants for its \ncomplexes compared to Cu\n2+\n.  \nPage 13 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n13 \n \n \nFigure 6 The manganese Me3-TACN complex originally used in laundry formulations and one example \nshowing it catalysing an epoxidation. \n \nThe most famous member of this class of bleach catalysts is the dinuclear manganese(IV) \ncomplex of 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane [77] (i.e. [Mn2(\uf06d-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 \nin Figure 6) which is an excellent low temperature catalyst for bleaching and was \nincorporated into a consumer product. Unfortunately the detergent product containing this \ncatalyst was withdrawn from the market [78] after it was alleged that the product yields \nincreased fabric- and dye-damage after repeated washing cycles. The fabric damage occurs \ndue to changes in the cotton fibre structure most likely due to the removal of non-cellulosic \nmaterials as well as a decrease in the degree of polymerisation of the cellulose. The catalyst is \nstill applied in various machine-dishwashing products and is responsible for superior removal \nof tea residues [79]. Research has been reported to limit adverse oxidative degradations but \nthis is difficult to achieve with this type of catalyst (Figure 7). For example the addition of \nchelating phosphonic acid pendant groups to improve stability was also accompanied by the \ndye damage observed for the parent complex [Mn2(\uf06d-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 [80]. Similarly, \nmanganese complexes of a TACN bearing 1-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl) pendant groups have \nbeen synthesised [81]. These show improved solution stability compared to the parent TACN \ncomplex but also mimic the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, in the latter case \nthereby increasing the decomposition of H2O2 in alkaline solution. \n \nFigure 7 Derivatives of the macrocyclic ligand triazacyclononane. \n \nIn the oxidation by H2O2 of phenols, chosen as models for the natural phenolic stains in \nlaundry, the precatalyst [Mn2(\uf06d-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 is first reduced to an EPR-active \nMn\nIII\nMn\nIV\n species. Also produced are phenoxy radicals which couple to give bi- and poly-\nphenols and by further oxidation diphenoquinones. The reduced manganese species is \nsusceptible to the formation of a monomer which is itself oxidised to form a \nPage 14 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n14 \n \n[Mn\nV\n(O)(Me3TACN)(biphenol)]\n+\n complex which has been proposed as the active oxidant \n[82].  \nThe precatalyst [Mn2(\uf06d-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 is also active in the oxidation of small \nmolecules such as alkenes (Figure 6) [83]. In these experiments, the dismutation of H2O2 can \nbe controlled by using an appropriate solvent (e.g. acetone) or by applying an additive (e.g. \noxalate or ascorbic acid). Addition of trichloroacetic acid or 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid to \n[Mn2(\uf06d-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 and H2O2 yields a selective cis-dihydroxylation versus \nepoxidation, namely in a 7:1 ratio [84].  \nRecently, voltammetric measurements at the surface of cotton have been performed after first \nimpregnating the cotton with graphite flakes [85]. Here the complex [Mn2(\uf06d-\nO)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 was absorbed by the cotton and in the presence of H2O2 this catalyst \nstill acts as a catalase model system.  \n \nFigure 8 Macrocyclic bleach catalysts. \n \nA large selection of complexes has been studied as oxidation catalysts during laundry \nwashing. These comprise macrocycles, salen-, saltren- and terpyridine-type ligands combined \nwith manganese in different oxidation states as the active pre-catalyst (Figures 1, 8 and 9) \n[74]. The essentials of the corresponding screening procedures have also been reviewed [86]. \nSeveral of the iron complexes of pentadentate amine ligands in Figure 9 (e.g. N,N,N',N'-\ntetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, N-benzyl-N,N',N'-tris(2-\npyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine and N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-bis(2-pyridyl)methylamine) \nform low spin Fe\n3+\n-hydroperoxide species analogous to the active form of the anticancer drug \nbleomycin [87], which functions by oxidatively cleaving the sugar residues of DNA [88]. \nRecently such complexes have also shown the ability to form an isolable oxoiron(IV) \ncomplex with such species also having often been implicated in the catalytic cycles of \noxygen-activating non-heme iron enzymes [89]. Several of the iron complexes of \npentadentate amine complexes have been patented as catalysts for stain bleaching in the \npresence of either H2O2 [90] or atmospheric O2 only [91].  \nPage 15 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n15 \n \nRecent studies involved Mn\n2+\n bleaching catalysts of meso-5,5,7,12,12,14-hexamethyl-\n1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane and racemic-5,5,7,12,12,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-\ntetraazacyclotetradecane ligands (Figure 8a), in bleaching cotton fabrics stained with tea, \ncoffee, curry, and sugar beet [92]. The catalysts were more active in comparison to the \ncurrent activator in laundry, i.e. tetraacetyl ethylenediamine (TAED). Also the dye and fabric \ndamage over repeated wash cycles induced by the catalyst was significantly less than with \nTAED with several different dyes.  \nDye-transfer inhibition (DTI) during laundering can be achieved by catalytic bleaching of the \nmigrating dyes in the wash-solution. It is critical here that the rate of the bleaching reaction \nshould be much higher than the rate of dye adsorption onto the acceptor fabric. Furthermore, \nthe stability of the catalyst needs to be high enough to bleach the dyes which are slowly \nreleased from coloured fabrics over the whole wash-cycle. For example, iron macrocyclic \ncomplexes of the TAML family (Figure 8b) of oxidatively rob st ligands developed by \nCollins and co-workers,  bleach dyes released from fabrics during laundry washing in \nsurfactant-containing media [74b,93]. Similarly the performance of three manganese-salen \n(Figure 9) complexes as DTI catalysts have been studied [74e,94]. This showed that a high \nactivity is compatible with a high stability, leading to good DTI properties. Interestingly, with \nthe less stable catalysts, the performance markedly improves by optimizing the catalyst and \nH2O2 concentrations or by formulation within a polymer matrix.  \n \nFigure 9 Acyclic ligands for complexes targeting laundry applications. \n \n2.2. Modification of cellulose \nIn the preparation of cellulose derivatives, a high solution viscosity is often the decisive \nquality criterion. Therefore it is important to control the final viscosity of the cellulose \nderivatives [95]. For example, in the production of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), \ncontrolling the reduction in molecular weight of the cellulose chains is essential. Such a \nreduction can be achieved by the addition of Co\n2+\n ions during the process, which act as a \ncatalyst for an oxidative cleavage reaction. It was shown that it is important for cobalt to be \npresent during the mercerisation stage in order to achieve the desired viscosity [96].  \n \nPage 16 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n16 \n \nFigure 10 The structure of deferoxamine \n \nTo help understand the fungal biodegradation of wood, the oxidative degradation with H2O2 \nof both hemicellulosic and cellulosic materials has been investigated with Fe\n3+\n and the Fe\n3+\n-\ncomplexes with both the catechol ligand 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and the \nhydroxamate ligand deferoxamine (DFO, Figure 10) [97]. With hemicelluloses, the Fe\n3+\n-\ncatechol complex mediated a Fenton reaction that clearly accelerated and increased the \ndegradation of the hemicellulosic materials. While, with the Fe\n3+\n-hydroxamate an inhibitory \neffect was seen. The reactivity was related to the reduction of the Fe\n3+\n to Fe\n2+\n as this species \nthen undergoes a Fenton reaction with the H2O2 to generate the hydroxyl radicals that are \nresponsible for the degradation observed. That an effect is seen with DFO is interesting, as \nthe X-ray structure of DFO- Fe\n3+\n shows that the metal ion is coordinatively saturated within a \ndistorted octahedron and so lacks a free site for reactivity [97b]. With the catechol ligand this \nreduction was much more efficient. Conversely, in similar experiments with cellulose \nmaterials no overall difference in degradation was seen between the Fe\n3+\n, Fe\n3+\n-catechol and \nFe\n3+\n-hydroxamate reactions, where the reduction possibly arises due to the release of \nreducing sugars. However, the catechol-mediated reaction did still accelerate the initial \ndegradation of cellulosic substrates.  \nRecently, a water-soluble iron phthalocyanine catalyst (M = Fe in Figure 11) with H2O2 was \nshown to oxidise hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC), \nguar gum (GG), and inulin to the extent of 19, 30, 53, 23 carbonyl functions per 100 AGU \nrespectively [98]. The relatively modest conversion reported and was ascribed to a competing \nover-oxidation resulting in a depolymerisation of the material.  \n \nFigure 11 A water-soluble iron phthalocyanine catalyst for the oxidation of hydroxyethylcellulose and \nstarch. \n \n3. Starch oxidation \nThe paper industry uses oxidised starch widely as a surface sizing agent. Generally the \noxidation process uses transition metal catalysts and perchlorates or iodates, which yields \nlarge amounts of inorganic waste. Oxidised starch can be formed industrially by TEMPO \nPage 17 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n17 \n \nmediated oxidation with sodium hypochlorite which generates stoichiometric amounts of \nwaste sodium chloride [99]. Alternatively, sodium iodate has been used to form dialdehyde \nstarch but here the high cost of periodate requires its recovery [100]. It would therefore be \nmost beneficial to develop a greener process.  \n3.1. Metal salts \nCuSO4  catalyses the air oxidation of potato starch in alkaline solution [101], with carbonyl \nderivatives being produced in preference to the further oxidation to carboxylates. The \ncatalysing Cu\n2+ \nions were not removed from the product by washing with water due to the \nformation of Cu\n2+\n carboxylate complexes. The copper derivatives displayed lower thermal \nstability than the original starch. Electron micrographs demonstrated that the oxidation \nprocess occurred on the surface and not in the granular interior. Similar, surface oxidation of \nthe starch granules was noted in the air oxidation of potato starch in the presence of an \nNH4VO3 catalyst [102].  \nPotato starch has been catalytically oxidised by H2O2 with Fe\n2+\n, Cu\n2+\nand WO4\n2-\n salts [103]. \nCu\n2+\n was the most active metal ion, although a combination of Fe\n2+\n and Cu\n2+\n salts gave the \nhighest carbonyl content of 6.6\/100 AGU (anhydroglucose units), whilst in general the \ncarboxyl content remained low similar to the air oxidation above. The pH influenced the \nreaction with the highest carbonyl content seen from acid solution and the yields were 90% in \nalkaline and 99% in acidic solution for the combination of Fe\n2+\n and Cu\n2+\n salts. It was shown \nthat depolymerisation increased markedly with the degree of oxidation, and the choice of \ncatalyst used, i.e. Fe\n2+\n and Cu\n2+\n led to the largest decrease. In support of this, rheological \nmeasurements showed that with a moderately oxidised starch the storage modulus G' was \nhigh. However, when the degree of oxidation increased and the molecular weight fell, the \nstorage modulus G' decreased. Additionally, the more the oxidised the starch was, the higher \nthe gelatinization temperature became.  \nMaize starch has been oxidised by H2O2 in either alkaline or acidic solution with an Fe\n2+\n \ncatalyst, prior to cationization with 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl(ammonium) chloride \n[104]. At pH 4 the catalyst formed hydroxyl radicals, while at pH 11 the catalyst formed the \nperoxy anion as the oxidant. At both pH values the catalyst enhanced the number of carboxyl \nand carbonyl residues in comparison to the uncatalysed reaction. Additionally the samples \nprepared at pH 11 were more amenable to the subsequent cationization step. Study of the \nPage 18 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n18 \n \nchemical and rheological properties of the oxidised starch and oxidised-cationized starch \nmaterials found properties which make them excellent agents for textile sizing and printing.  \nAs starch is processed, thermal treatments can lead to the formation of radicals that react to \nalter the material\u2019s structure. This is especially true in the presence of metal ions arising from \nthe soil during growth or from catalysts during processing of the starch. Therefore by using \nEPR spectroscopy this radical generation was studied and this was facilitated by the addition \nof Cu\n2+\n ions as a probe [105]. Clearly the Cu\n2+\n ions have several potential binding modes in \nthe starch. The thermal generation of radicals was proposed to arise by cleavage of the \ncarbonyl RCO-Cu\n2+\n or carboxylate RCOO-Cu\n2+\n bonds in the starch, followed by the \nreduction of Cu\n2+\n to Cu\n+\n ions and formation of transient RCO\u2022 or RCOO\u2022 species. The \nradical species then abstract a hydrogen atom from the neighbouring carbon atom within the \nglucose ring where the radical subsequently becomes localised.  \n3.2. Metal complexes \nA mixture of MTO\/H2O2\/LiBr (MTO = methyltrioxorhenium) has recently been shown to \nyield biodegradable oxidised starch super absorbers. This process avoids the highly acidic \nmedia previously reported by this same group and so limits depolymerisation of the starch \nwhile catalyzing the selective oxidation of the C6 hydroxymethyl group to form a carboxylic \nacid [106]. Under oxidative conditions using H2O2, the catalyst mainly exists in three \nstoichiometric forms: the parent MTO molecule and the 1:1 and 2:1 H2O2:MTO adducts, \nknown as intermediates A and B in the related literature [107]. Additionally, recent \nmechanistic studies by Lin and Busch using oxygen-18 labelled probes reported that the \ndeactivation of the catalyst MTO in oxidation reactions using H2O2 arises by the nucleophilic \nattack of HOO\n-\n on the parent catalyst rather than by HO\n-\n attack on intermediate A, opening \npossible strategies to enhanced catalyst stability [108].  \nRecently, a practical, single step oxidation of starch by H2O2 was published using water-\nsoluble phthalocyanine complexes [109] (i.e. tetrasulfonatophthalocyanine PcSM, M = VO, \nMn, Co and Fe in Figure 11), to synthesise a series of oxidised starches without producing \nany inorganic waste [110]. The oxidation was most efficient with the Fe\n3+\n catalyst and was \nbest operated in a semi-batch manner with continuous addition of the H2O2. It was again \nfound to be key that the pH was kept alkaline to avoid any acidic conditions which would \nlead to depolymerisation of the starch [7]. The catalyst is most active at pH 10, where the \nPage 19 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n19 \n \nH2O2 was rapidly consumed resulting in a COOH value of 1.6\/100 AGU and CO value of \n3.0\/100 AGU. However there was an accompanying loss of the solid starch (i.e. yield= \n67wt.%) due to both depolymerisation and decomposition. At pH 8.4, more starch was \nrecovered and the formation of carbonyl groups was higher which was ascribed to greater \nradical formation at this lower pH. The key step in the mechanism was suggested to be \nrelated to the mechanism seen previously in the oxidation of chlorinated phenols, namely the \nnucleophilic peroxo complex PcSFe\n3+\n-OO\n-\n cleaves the C-C bond bearing hydroxyl groups to \nform acids via a Grob type fragmentation (Figure 12) [111]. The oxidation process begins on \nthe surface of the starch particle before this oxidative degradation improves the access of the \ncatalyst to enable oxidation to occur inside the particle.  \n \nFigure 12 Mechanism of the oxidation of sugars by water-soluble metal phthalocyanines [110a,111].\n \n \n4. Lignin and its model compounds oxidation \nAs mentioned earlier, lignin offers an enormous potential as a feedstock for renewable \naromatic compounds [5,69-71]. In addition, the removal of lignin from ligno-cellulosic fibres \n(e.g. wood, straw, sisal) is important for textile and paper applications since it discolours the \nfibres even if present in low quantities. Since lignin is a three-dimensional cross-linked \nmaterial, lignin removal required breakage of chemical linkages, commonly through \noxidation.  \n4.1. Metal salts \nMnO2 is found in decayed wood and has been shown in combination with oxalic acid to \noxidise the aromatic components in wheat straw [112]. The active catalysts were soluble \nmanganese species that were not identified. The hemicellulose and cellulose components of \nthe straw remained unchanged, while the lignin components were clearly modified. \nFurthermore, only the phenolic units of lignin were directly oxidised as no structural \nalteration was seen with extensively permethylated lignin. This MnO2 and oxalate mixture \nclearly represents a possible route for fungi to begin the natural degradation of wood. \nPage 20 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n20 \n \nA mixture of Co(CH3CO2)2\/Mn(CH3CO2)2\/HBr in acetic acid can oxidise the lignin model \ncompound 3,4-dimethoxytoluene to its corresponding benzaldehyde [113]. This process is \nunusual for several reasons, namely the rate of O2 reacting with the substrate is bi-phasic, i.e. \ntwo maxima in the rate of reaction are seen. In the first phase, all of the 3,4-dimethoxytoluene \nis converted to intermediates, but very little to the carboxylic acid. During the second \nmaximum of activity, virtually all the intermediates are converted to the carboxylic acid. In \naddition, the rate of CO and CO2 formation is considerably higher during the second phase \nand as a byproduct methyl 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate is also formed.  \nA closely related process with five different lignin samples, from wood and bagasse, involved \ntheir oxidation in air with a Co(CH3CO2)2\/Mn(CH3CO2)2\/Zr(CH3CO2)4\/HBr mixture in acetic \nacid [114]. The aim was to harvest valuable aromatic compounds from the lignin as could be \nseen in a future biorefinery and eighteen products were identified via gas chromatography-\nmass spectrometry with an overall conversion of 10.9 wt% of the lignin. The most valuable \ncompounds were 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-\nmethoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid (vanillic acid), 4-\nhydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde) and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic \nacid (syringic acid). Studies with model substrates (i.e. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3-methoxy- \n4-acetoxybenzaldehyde, 4-methoxytoluene, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxytoluene and 3-methoxy-4-\nacetoxytoluene) showed firstly that the presence of the phenolic functionality on an aromatic \nring does inhibit the rate of reaction but that the alkyl group on the ring still oxidises to the \ncarboxylic acid. Secondly, that the acetylation of the phenols occurs at a reasonable rate in \nacetic acid and that the alkyl group of these acetylated phenols readily oxidise. Therefore a \ntwo-step acetylation\/oxidation to the carboxylic acid is a feasible route to recovering valuable \naromatic compounds. \n4.2. Metal complexes \nMethyltrioxorhenium   catalyses the oxidation by H2O2 of both phenolic and non-phenolic \nlignin model compounds (e.g. vanillyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, 1-(4-hydroxy-3-\nmethoxyphenyl)-2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy)propane-1,3-diol) [115]. Furthermore three \nlignins, hydrolytic sugar cane lignin (SCL), red spruce kraft lignin (RSL) and a hardwood \norganosolvent lignin (OSL) were extensively degraded under similar conditions. Related \ncatalytic activity was retained when the catalyst was supported on a polymeric support, e.g. \nPage 21 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n21 \n \npoly(4-vinyl pyridine), poly(4-vinyl pyridine-N-oxide) or within polystyrene, to allow ease of \nrecovery of the expensive catalyst [116].  \nA large series of ligands (Figure 13 shows typical examples) have been screened to prepare \nCu\n2+\n catalysts in situ for the oxidation of lignin model compounds, in particular veratryl \nalcohol to its corresponding aldehyde [117]. The oxidations proceed under alkaline \nconditions with O2 as the oxidant, with the authors aiming to develop a process for the O2 \nbleaching of pulp. It was found that the most active catalysts were formed from diimine type \nligands, i.e. dimethylglyoxime, 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2\u2019-bipyridine. In later studies using \n1,10-phenanthroline, the catalysis was proposed to be initiated by the reduction of \n[Cu(phen)(OH)2] by the veratryl alcohol with subsequent reoxidation of the catalyst by O2, as \nverified by UV\/Vis and EPR studies. Unfortunately this catalyst also depolymerises the \nmodel carbohydrate dextran showing inadequate selectivity for application in pulp bleaching \n[118]. If a solution of the catalyst was left to stand then crystals of [Cu(phen)2CO3].7H2O \nwere isolated supporting the view that several species will be present in the solution.  \n \nFigure 13 Ligands used in situ to generate catalysts for the oxidation of model substrates for lignin. \n \n2,2'-Bipyridine and modified 2,2'-bipyridines were similarly further studied with the \nsubstituents on the bipyridine rings having a large effect on the catalytic oxidation. Namely \nthe Cu-complexes of the 4,4'- and 5,5'- substituted bipyridine ligands were highly active in \nthe oxidation of veratryl alcohol. The 4,4'-disubstituted bipyridines showed that electron \ndonating methyl and methoxy substituents enhance the oxidation activity of Cu-bipyridine. \nThe most effective Cu-complexes also catalysed the oxidation of 2,2'-biphenol and again the \noxidative depolymerisation of the carbohydrate dextran. The performance of Cu-2,2'-\nbipyridines in O2 delignification of softwood pulp was in accordance with the model \ncompound studies; the catalysts lowered the lignin content of the pulp, but they also tended to \nattack the cellulose fibres. According to the oxidation experiments, the complex distribution \ncalculations and the UV-vis studies, the structure of the most active species was proposed to \nbe [Cu(2,2'-bipyridine)2OH]\n+\n [119].  \nIn the presence of TEMPO the Cu-complexes of either 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2\u2019-bipyridine \nform even more efficient catalysts for the oxidation of veratryl alcohol by O2 [120]. For \nPage 22 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n22 \n \nexample under the same conditions, adding TEMPO to the phenanthroline catalyst increases \nthe conversion from 44% to 90%.  \nThe Cu\n2+catalysts formed with either N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), rac-\n1,2- diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 9,10-diaminophenanthrene (DAPHEN) similarly \noxidise veratryl alcohol as above [121]. Low conversions are noted with Cu\n2+\n-(TMEDA) and \nCu\n2+\n-(DACH) catalysed reactions, with the most active catalyst being the poorly soluble \nCu(DAPHEN). The catalytic precursor in Cu\n2+\n-(TMEDA) catalysed reactions is proposed to \nbe the binuclear hydroxyl bridged complex [(TMEDA)Cu-\u03bc-(OH)2-Cu(TMEDA)]\n2+\n. The \nmain reason for the deactivation of these catalysts was the reactivity of the ligands under the \nreaction conditions. With TMEDA and DACH it was shown that this occurred by an imine \ncondensation with the veratryl aldehyde as the oxidation reaction progressed. However the \nDAPHEN ligand was observed to mainly decompose by a dimerisation process.  \nThe in situ generated [Cu\nII\n(pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde oxime)2] complex also catalyses \nselective oxidation of veratryl alcohol but with a reduced activity compared to the bipyridine \nor phenanthroline complexes [122]. Under alkaline conditions, the catalyst is suggested to \nhave both oxime groups deprotonated. However, the complex that crystallises from the \ncatalytic solution reveals a square pyramidal geometry established by two protonated \npyridine-2-carboxaldehyde oxime ligands and sulfate as a counter anion. This again shows \nthat these solutions of Cu\n2+\n with simple chelate ligands contain a mixture of Cu\n2+\n complexes.  \nOxygen-prebleached kraft pulp (OKP) was bleached with H2O2 under alkaline conditions \nusing a Cu\n2+\n complex formed with either 2,2\u2032-dipyridylamine (dpa) or 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) \n[123]. The selectivity for delignification, expressed by kappa number\/viscosity was increased \n12-fold and 2.6-fold by the coordination with dpa and 4-ap, respectively. ESR showed that \nthe coordination suppressed the production of hydroxyl radicals by 57% for dpa and 47% for \n4-ap. This finding suggests the involvement of a more selective hydroperoxo complex of \nCu\n2+\n in this oxidation process.  \n \nFigure 14 Cobalt catalysts studied in the oxidation of model substrates for lignin. \n \nPage 23 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n23 \n \nSeveral cobalt catalysts (Figure 14) namely Co(salen), Co(\u03b1-CH3salen) [\u03b1-CH3salen = N,N\u2032-\nbis(\u03b1-methylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine], Co(4-OHsalen) [4-OHsalen = N,N\u2032-bis(4-\nhydroxosalicylidene)ethylenediamine], Co(sulfosalen), Co(acacen) [acacen = N,N\u2032-\nbis(acetylacetone)ethylenediamine)] and Co(N-Me-salpr) [N-Me-salpr = \nbis(salicylideniminato-3-propyl)methylamine] were compared in the O2-oxidation of veratryl \nalcohol in alkaline solution [124]. The oxidation is selective for the benzylic position as \nveratryl aldehyde was the sole product. The unsubstituted Co(salen) was the most active and \nso was studied in most detail. Both the pH and temperature were found to be key with the \nreaction continuing for up to 72 h if the pH is kept at 12.5 and the optimum temperature is \nbetween 80-90\u00b0C. Decomposition of the catalyst is seen at higher pH or higher temperatures. \nReactivity increases linearly with increased O2 pressure and the catalytic activity is further \nimproved by increasing the catalyst:substrate ratio e.g. the highest turnover number of 330 \nwas seen with a ratio of 1:5950 (where the turn over number = moles of veratryl aldehyde \nproduced per mole of complex). During the oxidation an insoluble red precipitate was noted \nwhich was ascribed to a bimetallic Co(salen) species.  \nIn a separate study [125], the decomposition of the Co(sulfosalen) catalyst   occurs via \nhydrolysis of the imine bond and was independent of the formation of the veratryl aldehyde \nunlike the Cu amine systems discussed earlier [121]. The decomposition of Co(sulfosalen) \nincreased with increasing pH and was higher in the absence of oxygen. Additionally with the \nCo(sulfosalen) catalyst the generation of H2O2 strongly effects the oxidation of the lignin \ncompounds and especially the depolymerisation of dextran [126]. However, adding \nphenylglyoxylic acid eliminated the effect of the generated H2O2 to enhance the selectivity \nfor the delignification reactions.  \n \nFigure 15 Bulky water-soluble salen catalysts. \n \nThe complexes of MnCl(salen) and Co(salen) were compared with related bulky water-\nsoluble salen-type complexes (Figure 15) in the oxidation of phenolic lignin model \ncompounds in aqueous water-dioxane solutions (pH 3-10) [127]. Oxygen was used with the \nCo\n2+\n catalysts while H2O2 was employed with all the Mn\n3+\n catalysts.  Here the simple salen \ncomplexes reacted much slower than the bulky complexes. The bulky Mn\n3+\n catalysts    \nPage 24 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n24 \n \noligomerise coniferyl alcohol i.e. 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-ol in a similar \nreaction time as the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The Mn\n3+\n and Co\n2+\n catalysts \nyielded different one-electron products i.e. oligomers versus dimers, suggesting a different \nsubstrate to catalyst interaction in the oxidative coupling. As seen earlier with Co(salen) \n[124], the oxidation of veratryl alcohol yielded veratryl aldehyde showing again that the \ncomplexes can catalyze two-electron oxidations depending on the bulk of the substrate.  \nThe oxidation by H2O2 of the lignin model compounds, 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol, 1-\n(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-propene and E-1,2-diphenylethene has been compared for the \ncatalysts [Mn2(\u03bc-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 (Figure 6) and an analogue where the macrocyclic \nligands are joined [(Me4DTNE)Mn2(\u03bc-O)3](ClO4)2 (Me4DTNE = 1,2-bis(4,7-dimethyl-1,4,7-\ntriazacyclonon-1-yl)ethane, Figure 7) [128]. With [Mn2(\u03bc-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 the \noxidation decreases above 60\no\nC, where the cause for this is again most likely to be due to \ndecomposition of the catalyst as was seen earlier in its use with laundry. For example this \ncatalyst forms various species in solution, namely below pH 9.5 mononuclear manganese(IV) \nspecies seem to dominate the catalytic activity whilst at higher pH dinuclear species seem to \ndominate [74c,129]. Furthermore, when the two catalysts are compared, [Mn2(\u03bc-\nO)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 is   more effective in the oxidation of 1-(3,4-\ndimethoxyphenyl)ethanol and 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-propene but not E-1,2-\ndiphenylethene.  \nThe two Mn\n4+\n catalysts above were further studied in the bleaching of Pine Kraft-\nanthraquinone pulp with H2O2 under alkaline conditions at 80\u00b0C for 2 h [130]. Afterwards the \nbleached pulp was hydrolyzed with cellulase to allow analysis of the insoluble and soluble \nresidual lignins. For both catalysts, the degradation of the residual lignin increased upon \nincreasing the temperature from 60 to 80\u00b0C. Thus, the findings of the catalysed \ndelignification seem to differ from those observed in the oxidation of the model compounds \ncatalysed by [Mn2(\u03bc-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 when the reaction temperature was increased \nabove 60\u00b0C. In addition, the resulting residual lignins in the [(Me4DTNE)Mn2(\u03bc-O)3](ClO4)2 \ncatalysed bleaching at 80\u00b0C are less degraded than the corresponding lignins from the \n[Mn2(\u03bc-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 catalysed bleaching. A possible explanation is that above \n60\u00b0C decomposition of the [Mn2(\u03bc-O)3(Me3TACN)2](PF6)2 leads to some MnO2 forming in \nsolution and that this actually degrades the lignin as was discussed earlier [112].  \n \nPage 25 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n25 \n \nFigure 16 Water-soluble catalysts of meso-tetra(N-methylpyridino) porphyrin and meso-tetra(2,6-\ndichloro-3-sulphonatophenyl) porphyrin. \n \nThe iron-TAML catalysts (Figure 8b) of Collins and coworkers   activate H2O2 in the \nbleaching of wood pulp [74b]. These iron-TAML catalysts give 60-75% delignification and \nat 50\u00b0C the selectivity is competitive with the chlorine dioxide bleaching process.  \nThe oxidation by H2O2 of lignin model compounds and lignin with several water-soluble \nanionic and cationic iron and manganese porphyrins (Figure 16) has been explored [131]. The \nmanganese porphyrins were found more effective in degrading lignin and its model \ncompounds than were the related iron porphyrin. The most active catalyst was the cationic \nmeso-tetra(N-methylpyridino)porphyrin-Mn(III) pentaacetate [TPyMePMn](CH3CO2)5. \nDifferent reactivity was apparent with the manganese porphyrins, i.e. no significant \ncondensation reactions occurred, compared with the iron porphyrin where a substantial \nincrease of condensed structures was detected. This finding points to the formation of \nhydroxy radicals only with the iron porphyrin. The most active catalyst \n[TPyMePMn](CH3CO2)5 was further studied in lignin oxidation when supported on the clay \nmontmorillonite [132]. As now both the lignin substrate and the catalyst are insoluble in \naqueous solution it was necessary for a redox mediator, e.g. veratryl alcohol or 1-\nhydroxybenzotriazole, to be employed to avoid any kinetic problems. The clay supported \ncatalyst is a stable, recyclable, and efficient catalyst for the oxidation of lignin.  \n5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-sulfonato-phenyl)porphyrin-Mn(III) when supported on an imidazole-\nbearing silica showed a good ability to catalyse veratryl alcohol oxidation with H2O2 [133]. \nOn a related theme, tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin-iron(III) chloride when supported \non pyridyl-functionalized cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) was studied for catalytic \noxidations by H2O2 [134]. Interestingly a dramatic enhancement was seen with the addition \nof Mn\n2+\n at neutral pH. Similarly, as was described in the example above, the Mn\n2+\n\/Mn\n3+\n acts \nas a redox mediator shuttling between the insoluble catalyst and the insoluble lignin.  \nWood fibres can be modified for packaging applications by grafting synthetic polymers onto \nthe cellulose backbone via a radical process. Therefore recently the radicalisation of several \nunbleached lignocellulosic fibres was studied using a Co(salen) catalyst with O2 and \ndiscussed relative to similar studies with the enzyme laccase [135]. EPR spectroscopy \nPage 26 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n26 \n \nidentified that the amount of phenoxy cobalt radicals within the fibres was determined by the \ndegree of swelling caused by the solvent, i.e. methanol causes more swelling than chloroform. \nThe concentration of phenoxy radicals was 10 times higher than that seen from similar \noxidative processes catalysed by laccase. The fibres were also analyzed before and after the \nradicalization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that under oxidative \ntreatment chemothermomechanical (CTMP) pulps do not undergo morphology changes at the \nsurface, while thermomechanical (TMP) pulps suffer heavy surface damage. Subsequently, a \nsimilar oxidation of TMP fibres was compared for either [Co(salen)] in methanol or \n[Co(sulphosalen)] in water [136]. Here the fibre integrity was highest after the process in \nwater.  \n5. Developing areas - routes to new materials and applications  \nAs cellulose is a hydrophilic bio-polymer, it was used to support the water-soluble catalyst \nPd(OAc)2\/5TPPTS [TPPTS = P(m-C6H4SO3Na)3] [137]. This formed a new heterogeneous \ncatalyst for the Trost Tsuji allylic alkylation reaction of (E)-cinnamyl ethyl carbonate and \nmorpholine in benzonitrile. Interestingly the activity of this catalyst   depends upon its water \ncontent and the presence of this water in the reaction mixture failed to cause any unwanted \nleaching of the palladium catalyst. It was thought however that the catalytic reaction was \nhindered by the uncontrolled agglomeration of the particles under some reaction conditions. \nThis aggregation was reduced by the addition of the surfactant cetyltrimethyl(ammonium) \nbromide but unfortunately this led to an increased leaching of the Pd\n2+\n. In the context of this \nreview, it would be informative to see in the future whether using oxidised cellulose would \nreduce this leaching by providing more sites for coordination of the Pd\n2+\n.  \nWaste newsprint paper has recently been functionalised with p-aminobenzoic acid to yield a \nsorption active gel [138]. Waste paper was chosen over cellulose as the former is more \namorphous and accessible to such functionalisation. This gel selectively and efficiently \nrecovers Au\n3+\n, Pd\n2+\n and Pt\n2+\n over other coexisting metal ions such as Cu\n2+\n, Ni\n2+\n, Zn\n2+\n and \nFe\n3+\n from hydrochloric acid solution. With Au\n3+\n a reduction occurred to elemental gold \nwhich then aggregated. The gel was regenerated by using a mixture of thiourea and HCl. \nNaturally, in the context of this review it would be interesting here to further study whether \nbleaching the waste paper rather than washing with NaOH would improve the metal uptake \nby providing additional sites for the complexation of metal ions as is discussed later with \nstarch materials.  \nPage 27 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n27 \n \nOptical sensors for Hg\n2+\n have been developed on a cellulose support by incorporating a probe \nmolecule, 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol or cis-dithiocyanatobis-(2,2\u2019-bipyridine-4,4\u2019-\ndicarboxylic acid)-4,4\u2019-tridecyl-2,2\u2019-bipyridineruthenium(II) [139]. The sensors were \nproduced by the codissolution of cellulose and the probe in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-\nmethylimidazolium chloride (BMImCl) prior to casting into a thin film. The ionic liquid is \nthen simply removed by washing with water to form strips. These strips exhibit a \nproportionate (1 : 1) response to Hg\n2+ \nin water and may be easily regenerated by further \nwashing with water.  \nSimilarly, calix[4]arenes were immobilized in a cellulose-based film for either the removal or \ndetection of NOx gases [140]. Again the ionic liquid BMImCl was used to co-dissolve \ncellulose and the calix[4]arenes before casting into a film. If these films are exposed directly \nto NOx gas then a rapid calixarene-NO\n+\n complexation occurs with an accompanying colour \nchange. Depending on the desired application (i.e. sensing or storage), the NOx complexation \ncan be quickly or slowly reversed with humidity.  \nPorous plates made of nanofibrous crystalline cellulose have been synthesised as a support \nfor microbial cultures [141]. For example the growth of the microorganisms Escherichia coli, \nBacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was similar on the cellulose plate or a \ntraditional agar plate. The cellulose plates were shown by microscopy to be stable under \nharsh conditions and so were used to culture the thermophile Thermus thermophilus at 80\u00b0C. \nThis demonstrates that these cellulose plates have some advantages over agar- and gellan \ngum-derived media, including both versatility and stability.  \nStarch was firstly modified by a telomerisation reaction with butadiene prior to it being \nsuccessfully used as a solid support for a chiral pyridine-bis(oxazoline) (Pybox) ligand. \nSubsequent reaction with [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 under an ethylene atmosphere yielded a \nruthenium Pybox catalyst for the cyclopropanation reaction of styrene with ethyl diazoacetate. \nThe supported catalyst exhibited lower activity and selectivity than the unsupported complex \nbut higher than silica immobilised catalysts. It was demonstrated that the yield, \ndiastereoisomeric excess and enantiomeric excess remained constant over three runs [142]. \nThis report firstly suggests the use of biomass as solid supports in organometallic catalysis \nreactions and secondly in the context of this review it could be envisaged that by using \noxidised biomass additional substrate directing groups could be included to further improve \nthe selectivity.  \nPage 28 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n28 \n \nDialdehyde starch (DAS) (Figure 17) with various degrees of oxidation has been used to \nsynthesis a number of complexes of its dioxime (DASOX) [143], starch dialdehyde \ndithiosemicarbazone (DASTSC) [144] and starch dialdehyde aminothiazole (DASAT) [145]. \nIn complexation between DASTSC and the metal ions Ca\n2+\n, Cd\n2+\n, Co\n2+\n, Cu\n2+\n, Fe\n2+\n, Mg\n2+\n, \nMn\n2+\n, Ni\n2+\n, Pb\n2+\n, and Zn\n2+\n, the imino nitrogens and the sulphur atoms are proposed as the \nchelating sites for the metal ions. Similarly with DASOX the dioxime was again coordinated \nto the same series of metal ions [146]; e.g. Cu\n2+\n and Fe\n2+\n were the most strongly bound to \nDASOX whilst Mn\n2+\n and Zn\n2+\n were the most weakly bound ions. The authors proposed these \nfindings suggest applications for either the DASTSC or the DASOX materials in the \ntemporary immobilisation of heavy metal ions in the remediation of contaminated soil.  \nStarch dialdehyde aminothiazole (DASAT) was synthesised with different degrees of \nsubstitution (DS= 0.29, 0.46 and 0.78) to assess the adsorption of Cu\n2+ \nions from water [145]. \nThe adsorption capacity was optimum between pH 6-7 and increases with the increasing \ndegree of substitution of the DASAT. The optimum adsorption time is 120 minutes and the \nadsorption is greatest at the highest temperature studied of 60\u00b0C. In light of the earlier \ndiscussion in this review of the metal catalysed oxidation of starch, functionalisation of starch \nwith imino ligands needs to be undertaken cautiously to avoid forming complexes that will \nactivate oxygen and catalyse the oxidative depolymerisation of the starch.  \n \nFigure 17 Modified dialdehyde starch for studies on the adsorption of metal ions (only the oxidised unit of \nthe starch polymer is shown) \n \nAfter first cross-linking cornstarch with epichlorohydrin, it was oxidised with H2O2 and a \nCuSO4 catalyst [147]. Subsequent studies with this material for the removal of Ca\n2+\n ions from \nwater showed the adsorption efficiency increased proportionally with both the carboxyl \ncontent and the concentration of starch material in the water. Ionization of the carboxyl \ngroups in starch was necessary for the effective removal of the Ca\n2+\n ions. When the pH was \nbelow 4, the starch was no longer an effective sequestering agent and so by lowering the pH \nto 2 the material was easily regenerated.  \nPage 29 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n29 \n \nWith use of the biodegradable compounds oxidised starch, hydroxyapatite and deacetylated \nchitosan a new biodegradable bone wax substitute was developed with the potential to also \nact as a bone filling material [148]. The hydroxyapatite particles were adapted in a layer-to-\nlayer process involving the oxidised starch and deacetylated chitosan. In water, the different \nparticles are linked by Schiff base reactions between the aldehyde groups of the oxidised \nstarch and the amino groups of the deacetylated chitosan. The lack of cytotoxicity of this new \ncomposite was assessed in vitro by seeding the surface with MC3T3 mouse fibroblasts. It was \nthen seen by fluorescence spectroscopy that the cells proliferated well on the surface showing \ngood biocompatibility.  \nDialdehyde starch (DAS) when dispersed in aqueous solution shows activity in antiviral tests \nagainst three non-envelop viruses, namely two bacterial viruses MS2 and PRD1, and one \nhuman virus Poliovirus [149]. The antiviral activity was appreciably enhanced with a longer \nexposure time, reaching a maximum of seven orders of magnitude reductions against MS2 \nand PRD1, and four-order reduction against Poliovirus. The antiviral activity of DAS was \npH-dependent, showing higher activity in acidic or alkaline media compared to neutral pH. \nThe ability of DAS to be dispersed in water is  critical, as simple granular suspensions by \ncomparison demonstrated a reduced activity. Similarly this dispersion allows the easy casting \nof films onto surfaces, which the authors suggested advocates applications in the formation of \nantimicrobial surfaces. \nThe drug deferoxamine (DFO, Figure 10) as its mesylate derivative is effective in iron \nchelation therapy but it often needs prolonged daily infusions, which in turn can result in poor \ncompliance by patients [150]. Therefore DFO was conjugated to starch to form a high-\nmolecular-weight iron chelator, which shows a prolonged vascular retention and is \nbiocompatible. In trials drug-related adverse events were limited to four urticarial reactions \n(i.e. skin rashes), none necessitating termination of the trial. The starch-DFO conjugate safely \nproduced clinically significant urinary iron excretion over 1week. Consequently, treatment \nwith starch-DFO by a weekly dose could help treat iron balance in poorly compliant patients.  \nLignin materials have been reviewed as sorbents for a range of pollutants including metals, \nsurfactants, dyes, pesticides and phenols [151]. In particular, the surface charge \ncharacteristics and functional group present in lignins, especially kraft lignin, are suitable for \nmetal sorption. Sorption of Cu\n2+\n and Cd\n2+\n improved with increasing pH and decreasing ionic \nPage 30 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n30 \n \nstrength. It was suggested that additional pretreatment and surface modifications (e.g. \nincreased oxidation to provide more carboxylic acids on the surface) of these biosorbents \nmight further improve metal sorption ability and develop their application to the treatment of \nmetal-containing water or wastewater [152]. Similarly, lignocellulosic biosorbents have been \nmodified with iron species from acid mine drainage and studied in the subsequent removal of \nphosphorus from water [153].  \nRecently, the higher absorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) (e.g. pyrene, \nphenanthrene and naphthalene) by lignins in comparison to chitins and celluloses has been \ndiscussed [154]. Therefore the presence of lignins will reduce both the mobility and \nbioavailability of HOCs in soil, sediment organic matter or waste material. Interestingly, once \nthe alkyl and aromatic domains of lignin are concealed by nearby polar groups formed via \noxidation with NaIO4, the absorption of HOCs is lowered. Furthermore, coating both chitins \nand celluloses with lignin improves their absorption of HOCs. These studies point to \nchemical properties, such as functionality, polarity and structure, jointly controlling the \nabsorption of HOCs in biopolymers.  \n6. Conclusions \nThis review has discussed examples of catalytic oxidations which have been applied to \ndifferent types of biomass often to achieve quite different goals. For instance, the oxidation of \nthe surface of biomass compared to the oxidation of stains on the surface of the biomass. \nOften researchers have studied firstly the catalysts with model small molecules under \nhomogeneous conditions, before using the catalysts with actual biomass where the substrate \nis naturally more variable and often less soluble. Common challenges have been identified \nwith respect to using catalysts in water, catalyst decomposition, selectivity, competing \ndepolymerisation of the biomass, etc. Clear progress has been made but if materials based on \nbiomass are to replace the current petrochemical derived materials then there is still much \nmore work to be done. One obvious aspect is that the cost of the catalysts needs to be lower \nor recycling strategies need to be introduced. Additionally the highly efficient oxygenase \ncatalysts employed by Nature often contain more than one metal ion, while the bulk of the \nresearch reviewed herein has involved monomeric metallic complexes. Similarly, Nature \noften uses several catalysts (i.e. enzymes) together to transform biomass while chemists \ncurrently tend to only use one catalyst at a time. The potential applications of biomaterials are \nvaried and at an early stage of replacing more traditional polymers. Although compared to \nPage 31 of 56\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nLever edited April 10 \n31 \n \ntraditional polymers, biomaterials do generally display the added advantages of \nbiocompatibility and biodegradability.  However further tuning of catalytic oxidation \nprocesses will greatly advance this whilst also enabling the realisation of many new materials \nand applications.   \n7. References \n[1]   (a) J.W.A.
