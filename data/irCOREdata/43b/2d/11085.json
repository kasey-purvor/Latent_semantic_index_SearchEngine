Liu \nMoor Instruments Ltd, Axminster, UK \n \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nMicrofluidic systems are an emerging technology that has \nthe potential to realise the required fluidic transport, bio \nchemical detection and control functions capable of \nimproved detection resolution and accuracy, mixing \nefficiency and reaction speed within a single miniturised \nportable instrument for bio-diagnostic and bio-synthesis \napplications. The market sectors of specific interest \ninclude medical diagnostics, industrial control, \nenvironmental monitoring and pharmacology. Examples \nare DNA extraction from blood, detection of pathogens, \ne.g. genetically modified organisms (GMO\u2019s) or allergens \nand the replacement of animal testing.  In most cases, the \nvalue of this work is derived from the ability to generate \nenhanced measurements from extremely small samples \n(few ml) at low cost. \nThe use of microfluidics in molecular biology has already \nbeen shown to offer benefits such as improved sensitivity \nand speed of analysis. An example here is a charge based \ncapacitive biosensor for bacteria growth monitoring \n(BGM) presented in [1]. The sensor chip is implemented in \na CMOS process in order to show the applicability of the \nproposed on-chip capacitive technique for BGM purposes. \nAnother example is an integrated microfluidic-fibre optic \ndevice for the detection of agglutination for blood type \ncross-matching proposed and described by [2]. The device \nconsists of a straight microfluidic channel through which a \nreacted red blood cell suspension flows through a syringe \npump based actuation system. \nElectrodes are core components in both continuous and \ndroplet fluidic flow microsystems. The use of electrodes as \nsensors has already shown in [3] where microelectrodes \narrays (MEA) have been used as a cell-biosensor with \nseparated neuronal cell cultures to study the signal \nprocessing of neural networks and to detect neurotoxins. \nThere are also other applications for MEA in the fields of \nneurobiology and cardiac electrophysiology [4-6]. Typical \nneurobiology applications are ion channel screening, drug \ntesting, developmental biology, micro-encephalograms \n(EEG), microelectroretinograms (ERG) and safety \npharmacology studies. In the cardiac field, the typical \napplications are activation and excitation mapping, long-\nterm characterization of cell types (stem cells), \nmeasurement of conduction velocity and disease. \nThe use of the electrodes as an actuation technique in \nmicrofluidics has also been demonstrated to implement \nhighly definition fluidic transport with selective \nmanipulating of suspended cells. The integration of \nmicroelectrodes with the right dimensions to generate the \nrequired electric field in microfluidic systems offers the \npotential of utilizing electrophoresis to handle, isolate or \nposition individual cells with the goal of producing low \ncost instruments. Electrophoresis also proved to be a \nhighly adaptable technique involving relatively simple \nhardware design and compatible with a wide range of \nanalytic devices [7]. \n2 \n \nConductivity detection has also shown considerable \ninterest in capillary electrophoresis where microelectrodes \nhave been used to detect electro-inactive species. Organic \nacid, acetate, amino acid, explosives and peptides were \ndetected by monitoring changes in the conductivity of the \nrunning buffer. In the case of direct contact conductivity \ndetection, electrodes are in direct contact with the fluid, \nwhich offers an excellent contact with the sample but at \nthe cost of the reduction of detector stability due to an \nincreased possibility of fouling or degradation of the \nelectrodes [8]. \nThe increasing use of electrodes as actuators or as sensors \nhas led to interest around the failure mechanisms and \nreliability of their physical structure. Consequently, the \nneed for health monitoring in the electrode-based \nmicrofluidics is therefore essential to enhance the \nmeasurements, reduce false positives and false negatives \nand ensure the integrity of the recorded signal. \nAccelerating the uptake of these technologies is hence a \ncore mission of numerous private and public funding \nbodies. Solutions for defining efficient non-destructive \nproduction test strategies, fault tolerant design features and \nintegrated health monitoring are expected to be important \ncontributions towards this goal [9,10]. \nThe idea of Oscillation-Based-Test (OBT) for analogue \nintegrated circuits was initially presented in [11] where the \ncircuit under test is converted to a circuit that oscillates at a \nfrequency that is a function of the material properties and \nstructural integrity of the system. Faults in the circuit \nunder test can be detected which normally cause a \ndeviation of the oscillation frequency from its nominal \nvalue. The validity of this technique was verified through \nexamples such as operational amplifiers and analogue-to-\ndigital converters. OBT has also been evaluated within \nMEMS-based systems through work on a monolithic \nmagnetometer [12]. The natural frequency of the cantilever \nhas been chosen to be the main input parameter to the test \nstrategy. The tolerance band and detection range in the \ncase of small deviations applied to technological process \nparameters have been assessed. The potential for using \nOBT in a DNA sensor array has been discussed in [13] and \n[14] as well where the modes of sensing and test can both \nbe realised in an oscillator-based structure.  \nThe design, simulation and validation of an embedded \nhealth monitoring system for an electrode array sensor \nused in cell based bio assays have been proposed by [15]. \nThe principle idea of this technique is to measure and \ncompare the impedance of each sensing electrode. The \nimpedance is measured using half-bridge circuit with the \npass\/fail metric based on the impedance ratio between each \nelectrode against a reference under the assumption that the \nmajority of the electrodes are fault-free. \nA study of the effect of geometry and surface termination \non the morphological and chemical evaluation of \npolycrystalline silicon electrodes at applied bias and high \nrelative humidity has been presented in [16]. Two poly-\nsilicon electrodes isolated from the substrate by a silicon \nnitride layer were considered for the corrosion test. During \nthe experiment, anodic oxidation is observed on electrodes \nwith native oxide layer. Damage to the cathode is also \nobserved within 20 h under relative humidity value \u226589% \nwhen the anode to cathode area ration is greater than unity. \nFrom this work, understanding the corrosion mechanisms \nhas led to enable the selection of surface passivation pre-\ntreatments to reduce the observed phenomenon. \nFor digital droplet-based microfluidic systems, techniques \nfor defect classification, test planning, and test resource \noptimization have been presented in [17], whilst in [18] \nboth catastrophic and parametric faults have been detected \nby electro-statically controlling and tracking the motion of \ntest droplets. The detection of these test droplets is through \na simple RC oscillator formed by a pair of driving \nelectrodes with the fluid between them acting as the \ndielectric. Furthermore, based on the test results, the 2-D \nEWOD (Electro-Wetting On Dielectric) arrays with open \nstructures can be reconfigured in order to reallocate \nresources and avoid using the sites marked faulty.  \nAnother method based on Euler paths is proposed in [19], \nwhich maps a digital microfluidic biochip to an undirected \ngraph where a test droplet is routed along the Euler path \nderived from the graph to pass through all the cells in the \narray. The dependability has also improved by using \ndigital microfluidic logic gates. In [20, 21] fault diagnosis \nmethods to locate a single defective cell and multiple \nrows\/columns with defective cells in a digital microfluidic \narray have been presented. These methods utilize digital \nmicrofluidic (exclusive-OR\/AND) gates to implement an \noutput comparator. An efficient testing and diagnosis \nmethodology for digital microfluidic biochips has also \nbeen proposed in [22]. This method is based on a \npartitioning technique that increases parallelism in testing \nand diagnosis by exploiting the available sources and sinks \nwhich supports the ability to detect and locate single as \nwell as multiple faults in a microfluidic array. An excellent \nsurvey of research on design automation and test \ntechniques for digital microfluidic biochips can be found \nin [23].  \nThe work carried out here is motivated by characterisation \nstudies which have revealed that electrode degradation \ntends to be a key reliability issue in cell-based biosensors, \nconductivity sensors, and when used as actuators, where  \ncorrection is not possible through manual cleaning [9,10]. \nDegraded electrodes tend to exhibit much lower signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) or higher interface impedance that in \nboth cases degrades the ability of the system to monitor \ncellular signals and bio-chemical processes, measure the \naccurate conductivity or moving the fluid to the right \nposition. Monitoring key parameters or reliability \nindicators for these component parts in addition to the \ntransportation and processing functions is hence an \nessential feature of future systems. This work \ncomplements the international effort to advance the field \nof embedded test for microfluidic systems and builds on \n3 \n \ninitial work on both an MEA (Micro-Electrode Array) \nstructure and full bio-diagnostic system presented in \n[15,24,25]. This work will firstly focus on comparing the \napplication of OBT on two demonstrators, MEA and \nelectrode-based microfluidic mixing chip. The aim of these \ninvestigations is to consider the effect of the electrode\u2019s \nsize and structure, fluid permittivity and velocity on the \nmeasurements. Application the OBT at the system level is \nthe second objective of this work where a microcontroller, \nanalogue multiplexer, a test circuit and an LCD have been \nused to achieve fully controllable condition monitoring \nsystem for the MEA. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 \nbriefly presents an electrical model at the circuit-level for \nthe electrolyte-electrode interface. Section 3 describes the \napplication of the OBT on the MEA and experimental \nresults documented. The application of OBT on the second \ndemonstrator, the electrode-based microfluidic mixing \nchip is presented in section 4 while OBT implementation \nat the system level is detailed in section 5 where a fully \ncontrollable condition monitoring technique is described. \nFinally, conclusions are drawn in section 6. \n2. Self Test Solution and Fault Modeling \n \nIn using electrodes to sense either spontaneously generated \nextracellular potentials or to measure the impedance of \ntarget cells, the reliability indicator will be related to the \nfundamental signal coupling between the ion flow in the \nelectrolyte and the electrode interface. Therefore, the \nelectrical properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface \nare crucial parameters within fault-free and faulty systems. \nAnalysis has however indicated that degradation of the \nsensing interface and the health status of bio-chemical \nspecies are not trivial parameters to monitor. \n \nTo help understand the dependence of system performance \non such physical defects, an electrical equivalent model \nmay be used. An electrical model at the circuit-level for \nthe interface has been developed and characterised in \n[15,24] which is based on the theoretical analysis of micro-\nelectrodes in [26]. This model is shown in Figure 1, where \nCEDL is the capacitance of the Electrical Double Layer, RCT \nthe charge transfer resistance, ZW the Warburg impedance \ndue to ion diffusion, ZP the impedance of the porous \nsurface, RS the electrolyte spreading resistance and CX is \nthe parasitic capacitance. \n \nFig. 1 Circuit model for the electrode-electrolyte interface. \n3. Application of OBT on the MEA \n \nThe model that has been developed for the electrode-\nelectrolyte interface has been characterised on an MEA \nplatform as illustrated in Figure 2 [27]. This is a well-\naccepted interface for recording the extracellular potentials \nfrom neuron networks or cardiac tissues [28]. The MEA \nhas 60 sensing electrodes distributed on a square area of \n0.6 x 0.6 mm2 with the distance between neighbouring \nelectrodes being 200 \u03bcm. Each sensing electrode has a \ndiameter of 30 \u03bcm and is fabricated using high surface \nporosity material (TiN). The electrolyte used has a molar \nconcentration of 120 mM. \n \n \n \nFig. 2 Sensing electrodes site of the MEA (Reproduced \nfrom [27]). \n \nThere are three potential mechanisms that can result in \nquality degradation of micro-electrodes according to the \nend-users. They are: \n\u2022 electrode degradation due to damage during the \ncleaning and preparation of the MEAs, \n\u2022 fouling of the electrodes by biological material that is \nnot removed completely during cleaning, and \n\u2022 material loss of the electrode surface through ion loss \ninto the surrounding liquid medium. \nAll of these affect the electrode-electrolyte interface in the \nform of either physical damage, fouling from biological \nmaterial deposits, or loss of solid material from the \nelectrode surface. As the porous layer is located on top of \nthe micro-electrodes and interfaced with the operational \nenvironment, it is logical to assume that the fault \nmechanism active will degrade the performance of the \nsystem through damage to the porous layer to some \ndegree. \nWhen a solid (metal, semiconductor, insulator) is placed \ninto an electrolyte (ionic solution), an electrified interface \nis formed due to chemical reactions where electrons are \ntransferred between the solid and the electrolyte. The result \nis the formation of an electric field between the electrode \nand the electrolyte which stimulates further chemical \nreactions to take place. These reactions reach an \nequilibrium condition when the currents due to electron \ntransfer to and from the solid are equal. The result of this \nprocess is the Electrical Double Layer (EDL). \nC\nEDL\nR\nCT\nZ\nW\nR\nS\nZ\nP\nC\nX\n4 \n \nThe model presented in Figure 1 has been shown to be \nuseful for exploring the effect of surface degradation of the \nbio-electrodes under study. In many implementations of \nelectrodes and electrode arrays, the value of EDL \ncapacitance (CEDL) is a function of both expected \nbiological processes (e.g. hybridisation) and degradation \nmechanisms such as fouling, contamination or electrolysis \ndue to voltage bias. The electrode surface was made from \nhigh porosity material to increase the effect of the EDL. It \nis hence logical to expect that all relevant types of \ndegradation that will affect the electrode structure will \ndirectly impact this layer. \nLooking in more detail at the capacitive component of the \nEDL, it can be shown that CEDL can be modelled by an \nequivalent network consisting of CH, the compact layer \ncapacitance, CD, the diffusion capacitance, RD, the \ndiffusion layer resistance and RB, the bulk resistance, as \nshown in Figure 3. Table 1 shows the calculated values for \nthe EDL components. \n \n \nFig. 3 Extension of the electrode model to include \ncomponents of CEDL which can be replaced by CH, CD, RD \nand RB. \nTable 1 Calculated values of EDL components. \nComponent Value \nCH 125 pF \nCD \u2265758 pF \nRD 3 M\u2126 \nRB 1 K\u2126 \n \nThe interface dominant capacitance of the EDL is CH and \ncan be approximately expressed as \n1XAC roH \u03b5\u03b5=     (1) \nwhere \u03b5o is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5r is the relative \npermittivity of the electrolyte and X1 is the length of the \ncompact capacitor (dominant capacitor), while A is the \nsurface area of the electrode. As discussed above, damage \nto the porous layer on the surface of the sensing electrodes \nis an important physical defect which results from a range \nof electrochemical, bio-chemical and electromagnetic \neffects. It is also noted that the surface area of the \nelectrode can be used to assess degradation because all key \nmechanisms will affect the active area and consequently \nchange the dominant capacitance, CH. Based on the model \nabove which describes the EDL at the electrode\/electrolyte \ninterface, the health status of the porous layer can be \nmonitored as a function of frequency. \nTo study the impact of the effective surface area of the \nelectrode on the oscillation frequency of a test circuit \ntheoretically, CEDL was inserted into the feedback of a \nstandard oscillator structure as shown in Figure 4. \n \nFig. 4 CEDL Integrated into the oscillation structure. \nThe oscillator circuit used for characterisation of the \neffectiveness of OBT has used values for R1, R2, and R3 of \n1 M, 1 K and 100 K\u2126 respectively. With this set of values, \nthe feedback voltage on the electrode is around \u00b1 100 mV, \nand will be the same amplitude and the same duration but \nopposite polarity. Therefore, the accumulated charge will \nflow back to the op-amp circuit and not held at the \nelectrode. The nominal value of CH is assumed to be 125 \npF, while CD, RD and RB are assumed to be constant \nbecause the change in electrode surface area has no effect. \nThis oscillator outputs a square wave at a frequency of \naround 110 KHz in the fault-free case, and between 110 \nKHz and 250 KHz dependant on the change in active area. \nTo verify the oscillation-based self-test solution, an \nexperiment on an MEA demonstrator has been carried out. \nIn this experiment, the EDL capacitance is measured \ndirectly using a Wayne Kerr Precision Impedance \nAnalyzer 6500. Measurements are conducted by \nconnecting the impedance analyser to the target electrode \nand the ground electrode. In the set-up, the ground \nelectrode serving as an internal reference is shorted with \nthe electrolyte bath ground, and connected to the \nelectronics ground in order to provide a common ground \nbetween the electronics and the bath. The capacitance is \nmeasured for the condition where the system is stimulated \nwith a 50 mV input at 10 KHz. To demonstrate the effect \nof the electrode surface degradation on the EDL \ncapacitance and to extract CEDL measurements at different \nlevels of degradation, the electrode surface has been \nartificially damaged by repeatedly stimulating the \nelectrodes with voltage pulses (1 Volt). Figures 5 and 6 \n5 \n \nshow three-dimensional images for fault-free and \nartificially damaged electrodes respectively. These images \nhave been captured using a Veeco Wyko NT100 White \nLight Interferometer. As can be seen from these figures, \nthe effect of the stress pulses on the electrode surface area \nis the loss of large areas of the porous layer due to \nelectrolysis. \n \nFig. 5 3-D interactive image for fault-free electrode. \n \nFig. 6 3-D interactive images for faulty electrode after \napplication of stress pulses. \nThis damage impacts the functionality of the surface \nporous layer and is the most widely reported degradation \nmechanism in typical applications. The EDL capacitance \nhas been measured after specific time points within the \nstress program to extract the CEDL signature as a function of \npulse time. The period of the stress pulse is 5 seconds with \na stress program duration of 150 seconds. By stimulating \nthe electrode with these pulses CEDL has decreased from \naround 180 pF to 55 pF, as a consequence, the oscillation \nfrequency has increased to around 1.9 times  its fault-free \nvalue, fosc. Table 2 shows the change in the stress pulse \ntime, CEDL and the oscillation frequency over the duration \nof the stress program. \nTable 2 The change in CEDL and the oscillation frequency \nwith the stress pulse time. \nStress pulse time \n(s) \nCEDL (pF) Oscillation \nfrequency (KHz) \n0 180.6 fosc \n5 143.7 1.15 fosc \n10 136.1 1.18 fosc \n15 121.5 1.27 fosc \n20 101.3 1.40 fosc \n25 97.8 1.44 fosc \n30 95.2 1.46 fosc \n35 91.7 1.48 fosc \n40 88.4 1.51 fosc \n45 87.6 1.52 fosc \n50 81.9 1.56 fosc \n60 76.2 1.63 fosc \n70 72.4 1.68 fosc \n80 68.7 1.72 fosc \n90 63.6 1.78 fosc \n100 59.3 1.84 fosc \n120 57.2 1.86 fosc \n150 55.1 1.90 fosc \n \n4. Application of OBT on Electrode-based \nMicrofluidic Mixing chip \n4.1 Experiment Setup \nTo verify the effectiveness of the oscillation based \ntechnique on another demonstrator and characterize the \neffect of the electrode size, structure, material, and the \nmoving fluid on the oscillation frequency, this technique \nhas been applied on electrode-based microfluidic mixing \nchips. These chips are used to measure conductivity across \npair of overlapped electrodes whilst running the solutions \n(0.1 molar HCl with 0.1 molar NaOH). A microfluidic \nplatform capable to demonstrate different micro-scale \nfluidic processes such as mixing, separation or droplet \ngeneration has been used in this experiment. A schematic \nfor experiment setup is shown in Figure 7. \n \nFig. 7 Schematic of experiment setup. \n6 \n \nThe setup includes a common casing and base board, \nfluidic connectors, functional chip, pumps, the control \nsoftware and an impedance analyzer. The casing is a \nstandard 120\u00d7120\u00d730mm cast-iron box (RS components) \nand prepared appropriately to accommodate the base board \nand the fluidic connectors. The base board includes the \nmechanism to establish fluidic seal between the channels \nin the base board and the functional chip. PMMA and SU-\n8 have been used to fabricate the base board and the chips \nusing standard lithographic and machining processes. \nWPI-Aladdin pumps have been used as external actuators \nthat can provide precise and countable flow rate. \nLABVIEW software has been used to control the fluid \nwhile Coda-pins have been utilized to achieve electrical \nconnection between the external electrical connector and \nthe electrodes in the functional chip. \nThe design of the mixing chip is shown in Figure 8 which \nillustrates the structure of the delay channel and the \nsensing chamber where two overlapped electrodes were \nfabricated and can be used to measure the fluid \nconductivity in the sensing chamber. \n \nFig. 8 Design of the mixing chip. \nThis chip was made from SU-8 and has two inlets A and \nB, and one outlet C. The inlets and outlet are connected to \nthe base board using special connecters to achieve a fluidic \nseal between the channels on the base board and the chip. \nThis mechanism allows the user to feed the chip with the \nrequired fluids at a certain flow rate using external pipes \nand pumps. The delay channel is used to deliver the delay \nrequired for the chemical reactions to take place. The \ndimensions of the delay channel are 150 \u001fm for the width, \n75 \u001fm for the depth, and around 9 cm for the length. The \nlast part of the mixing chip is the sensing chamber, this \nchamber has a width of 2.35 mm and a length of 5 mm. In \nthis chamber, two overlapped aluminium electrodes were \nfabricated using standard lithographic and machining \nprocesses. Each electrode has two parts, the dimensions of \neach part are 2.15 mm for the length and 0.25 mm for the \nwidth. \nIn order to accomplish a bio-assay in the microfluidic \nplatform, a control system to manage the operations on the \nbulk fluid is essential. The protocol involves HCl running \nat a flow rate 1 \u03bcL\/min and NaOH at a flow rate 10 \n\u03bcL\/min, and then slowly step by step increasing HCl flow \nrate to match the NaOH. WPI-Aladdin pumps are \nconnected to PC via RS232 and each of the pumps can be \nindividually addressed. At the software level, the objective \nis to program the pumps to operate at a changeable \nvelocity to monitor the fluid conductivity at different flow \nrates and complete the experiment. The codes are written \nin LABVIEW. As illustrated in Figure 9, fluid actuation \nfunctions consist of stacked commands that include setting \nthe flow rate, selecting the pump, setting the diameter of \nthe syringe and the direction of the pumping. \n \n Fig. 9 Fluid control block diagram. \nA Wayne Kerr Precision Impedance Analyzer 6500 has \nbeen used to measure the conductance of the fluid in the \nsensing chamber between the overlapped electrodes. \n7 \n \nFigure 10 shows measurements of the conductance \nspectrum whilst HCl is running at a flow rate 1 \u03bcL\/min \nand NaOH is running at a flow rate 10 \u03bcL\/min for the first \ncase, and the conductance spectrum when the flow rate for \nboth HCl and NaOH is 10 \u03bcL\/min, the second case. From \nmeasurements, the highest conductance for the first case is \naround 25 mS at a frequency range around 365 KHz while \nthe conductance has decreased to around 10 mS at the \nsame frequency in the second case. \n \nFig. 10 Conductance spectrums whilst HCl is running at a \nflow rate 1 \u03bcL\/min and NaOH is running at a flow rate 10 \n\u03bcL\/min in the first case and when the flow rate for both \nHCl and NaOH is 10 \u03bcL\/min in the second case. \n \n4.2 Effect of Electrode Degradation on the \nOscillation Frequency \nTo demonstrate the OBT on the microfluidic mixing chips \nand explore the degradation effect on Electrical Double \nLayer capacitance, experiment has been carried out. The \nelectrode has been artificially damaged by repeatedly \nstimulating the electrode with voltage pulses (5 volt). \nUnder these conditions the stimulating electrode behaves \nas a plate capacitor with accumulated charge maintained \non the surface and hence time dependant degradation due \nto electrolysis. In these experiments, the EDL capacitance \nis measured directly using a Wayne Kerr Precision \nImpedance Analyzer 6500. \nMeasurements are conducted by connecting the impedance \nanalyzer to both electrodes. The EDL capacitance has been \nmeasured after definite time periods within the stress \nprogram to extract the CEDL signature as a function of \npulse time. The period of the stress pulse is 20 seconds \nwith stress program duration of 140 seconds. By \nstimulating the electrode with these pulses CEDL has \ndecreased from around 70 nF to around 25 nF when HCl is \nrunning at flow rate of 1 \u03bcL\/min and NaOH is running at \nflow rate of 10 \u03bcL\/min while CEDL has decreased from \naround 45 nF to around 18 nF when the flow rate of both \nHCl and NaOH is 10 \u03bcL\/min. The capacitance is measured \nfor the condition where the chip is stimulated with a 50 \nmV input at 10 KHz. Figure 11 depicts CEDL \nmeasurements at both cases. \n \nFig. 11 Changing CEDL with the stress pulse time while \nHCl is running at a flow rate 1 \u03bcL\/min and NaOH is \nrunning at a flow rate 10 \u03bcL\/min in the first case and when \nthe flow rate for both HCl and NaOH is 10 \u03bcL\/min in the \nsecond case. \nFrom the results, although the effect of changing the \npermittivity and increasing flow rate of the fluid on the \nEDL capacitance measurement is clear, the range of \nchanging EDL capacitance from fault-free case to the \nfaulty one is still valid to convert the capacitance to \nfrequency and monitor the status of the electrodes. Figures \n12 and 13 show the electrodes at fault-free case and faulty \none respectively. \n \nFig. 12 Fault-free electrode. \n \nFig. 13 Faulty electrode. \n8 \n \nThe oscillation circuit in figure 4 has been used to \ncharacterize the effectiveness of the OBT and study the \neffect of the fluid flow rate and permittivity on the output \nfrequency in the fault-free and faulty cases. The oscillation \nfrequency has been measured after specific time periods \nwithin the stress program and with two different flow rates \nfor the HCl (1 \u03bcL\/min and 10 \u03bcL\/min). Table 3 describes \nthe oscillation frequency measurements for both cases. \nTable 3 Mixing chip oscillation frequency measurements. \nStress \npulse \ntime \n(s) \nOscillation frequency \nwhilst HCl is running \nat 1 \u03bcL\/min flow rate \nand NaOH is running \nat 10 \u03bcL\/min flow \nrate \nOscillation \nfrequency whilst \nboth HCl and \nNaOH are running \nat 10 \u03bcL\/min flow \nrate \n0 f osc 1.12fosc=fosc*\n20 1.17 f osc 1.13 fosc* \n40 1.27 f osc 1.26 fosc* \n60 1.39 f osc 1.38 fosc* \n80 1.60 f osc 1.56 fosc* \n100 1.88 f osc 1.81 fosc* \n120 2.36 f osc 2.23 fosc* \n140 2.47 f osc 2.32 fosc* \n \nFrom Table 3 and for the first case, HCl is running at 1 \n\u03bcL\/min and NaOH is running at 10 \u03bcL\/min, the oscillation \nfrequency has increased from the nominal value (fosc) at \nthe fault-free case to around 2.47fosc at the faulty one. In \nthe second case, when HCl is running at 10 \u03bcL\/min and \nNaOH is running at 10 \u03bcL\/min, the oscillation frequency \nhas increased from the nominal value (fosc*) to around 2.32 \nfosc*. The effect of increasing HCl flow rate and then \nchanging the fluid permittivity on the oscillation frequency \nat the fault-free case is clear where the frequency has \nincrease to around 1.12 of its value when the HCl flow rate \nhas increased to 10 \u03bcL\/min. The frequency range between \nthe fault-free and the faulty case has also decreased due to \nthe change in the permittivity and the drift velocity in the \nsecond case. \nIn comparison between the Electrical Double Layer \ncapacitance measurements at the fault-free and the faulty \ncases for the microfluidic mixing chips and the Micro \nElectrode Array, the following can be concluded: 1) The \nElectrical Double Layer capacitance has increased from \nthe range of pF to the range of nF due to the significant \nincrease in the electrode size hence surface area. 2) Both \ntypes of electrodes have demonstrated the same \ndegradation mechanisms (Electrolysis due to stimulus \npulses), and then the same behaviour and effect on the \nElectrical Double Layer capacitance. 3) The change in the \nCEDL from the fault-free case to the faulty one in the MEA \nelectrodes is greater than the change in the mixing chips \nelectrodes because of the high porosity and the micro-\nfolded structure of the MEA electrodes which physically \nincreases the effective surface area. \n5. OBT Implementation at the System Level \nTo achieve a fully controllable condition monitoring \ntechnique and verify the effectiveness of OBT in the \nsystem-level design, this approach has been applied to a \ndevice with 32 microelectrodes. The system consists of a \nmicrocontroller, an analogue multiplexer, a test circuit and \nan LCD. The whole system architecture is shown in figure \n14. The test circuit in figure 4 is used to convert the \nElectrical Double Layer capacitance to frequency.  An \nADG732 analogue multiplexer (monolithic CMOS 32-\nchannel) has been used to connect the micro electrode \narray (32 electrodes from the MEA) to the oscillator test \ncircuit. An Atmel megaAVR microcontroller serves as the \ncontrol unit which monitors and synchronizes the system. \nThe ATmega8A is a low-power CMOS 8-bit \nmicrocontroller based on the AVR RISC architecture \nwhich is programmed in \u201cC\u201d to control the operation of \nthe test system. \nThe ATmega8A is clocked by an external oscillator at 4 \nMHz and has built-in timers and counters. Two general \npurposes Timer\/Counters have been used to read pulses \nfrom the test circuit and to control the addressing of the \nanalogue multiplexer. The first timer, TCNT0 \n(Timer\/Counter0) is a single channel 8-bit Timer\/Counter \nmodule that can be used as a counter, frequency generator \nor external event counter. TCNT0 is used as an external \nevent counter to read the external pulses form the test \ncircuit on PORTD, pin 4 where these pulses increment the \ncounter synchronously at each rising edge. \n \nFig. 14 The system architecture. \nThe second timer, TCNT1 (Timer\/Counter1)  is a 16-bit \nTimer\/Counter unit which allows accurate program \nexecution  and signal timing measurement and can be used \n9 \n \nas two independent output compare units, double buffered \noutput compare register or clear timer on compare match. \nIn this work, TCNT1 is used as an interrupt timer to time \nthe collection of pulses and clear Counter0 before it \noverflows. This accurate timer is used to calculate the \nfrequency of the pulses and hence the state of the electrode \ndegradation. The following formula is used to calculate the \nbinary reload value for the required time for TCNT1: \n\u0734\u0748\u074b\u073d\u0740\u0bcf\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0be8\u0bd8 \u0d4c \u123a2\u0be1 \u0d46 1\u123b \u0d46\u00a0\u1246\n\u0bd9\u0cc0\u0cc4\u0cb4\n\u0bc9\u0cc3\u0cb6\u0cc4\u0cb4\n\u0d57\n\u0bcd\u0bdc\u0be0\u0bd8\u0be5\u0bd9\u0be5\u0bd8\u0be4_\u0bc1\u0bed\n\u1247                     (2) \nwhere n is the counter bit numbers, fOSC is the clock speed \nof the microcontroller (4MHz), PRESC is the pre-scalar for \nTimer1 (64) and Timerfreq_Hz is the sampling frequency \nwhich is 50 Hz. \n \nFig. 15 The code-flow for the test algorithm. \nThe overflow of TCNT1 is also responsible for \nincrementing the analogue multiplexer address after each \ncycle through PORTB. To monitor the measured \nfrequency in real-time, an LCD in 4-bit mode is connected \nto PORTD, pins0-3, and an active-low input buttons are \nconnected to PORTC, pins 0-3 for user selection. The \nmicrocontroller has been programmed to monitor the \noscillation frequency, the analogue multiplexer address, \nhealth indication from the electrode and the reference \nfrequency which is the frequency that all other frequencies \nfrom the test circuit are compared with and can be selected \nby the user, or based off of real-time test frequencies. \nAdditionally, the microcontroller has been programmed to \ndetect a \u201cBad Electrode\u201d if the frequency of the target \nelectrode is 1.4 times the reference frequency. The code \nflow for the microcontroller is described in Figure 15. \nTo consider the stability of the reference frequency \nmeasurements, signature analysis for the fault-free \nelectrode has been carried out where the effect of the noise \nand the feedback voltage from the test circuit on the \noscillation frequency for a 90 min period. has been \nrecorded (Figure 16). The data showed that the maximum \ndeviation in the frequency is around \u00b11 %. \n \nFig. 16 signature analysis for the fault-free electrode. \nTo validate the test technique and illustrate the effect of \nthe system parameters, an experiment on the MEA has \nbeen carried out. Thirty-two electrodes from the MEA \nwere connected through the multiplexer to the test circuit. \nDifferent levels of degradation have been emulated by \nartificially damaging the surface area of ten electrodes \nwith voltage stress pulses of 1 V amplitude and differing \nperiods. The microcontroller has been programmed to \nincrement output port B and a delay time of two seconds \nhas been used to connect each electrode to the oscillator. \nFigure 17 shows the frequency measurements where the \ntest technique has accurately distinguished the degraded \nelectrodes and the level of the degradation. The fault-free \nfrequency is denoted by fosc. \n10 \n \n \nFig. 17 Oscillation frequency measurements for 32 \nelectrodes. \nTo demonstrate the effect of the analogue multiplexer \ninput capacitance and resistance on the measurements, the \noscillation frequency of ten electrodes (the same \nelectrodes degraded by varying stress inputs) have been \nmeasured with and without the multiplexer. Single wires \nhave been used in this experiment to avoid the coupling \ncapacitance of the ribbon cable (Table 4). The effect of the \nself resistance, self capacitance and the coupling \ncapacitance on the frequency measurements has also been \ndemonstrated in a second experiment where the single \nwires have been replaced with ribbon cable. The \nequivalent circuit per unit length for the interface between \nthe electrodes and the analogue multiplexer can be seen in \nFigure 18, where RS, CS, CC, and N are the self resistance, \nthe self capacitance, the coupling capacitance, and the line \nnumbers of the ribbon cable. \n \nFig. 18 The per unit length electrical equivalent circuit for \nthe ribbon cable. \nTable 4 shows the oscillation frequency measurements \nwhen single wires without the AMUX were used, and then \nwhen AMUX was inserted. The last column shows the \nmeasurements when the single wires have been replaced \nby ribbon cable. \nTable 4 Oscillation frequency measurements using single \nwires and ribbon cable with and without AMUX. \nElectrode \nNo \nStress \npulse \ntime \n(s) \nOscillation \nfrequency \nwithout \nAMUX \nusing \nsingle \nwires \nOscillation \nfrequency \nwith AMUX \nusing single \nwires \nOscillation \nfrequency with \nAMUX using \nribbon cable \n21 0 f osc 0.93fosc=fosc* 0.88fosc=fosc**\n22 5 1.15 f osc 1.12 fosc* 1.12 fosc** \n32 10 1.20 f osc 1.18 fosc* 1.17 fosc** \n42 15 1.27 f osc 1.25 fosc* 1.22 fosc** \n52 20 1.41 f osc 1.40 fosc* 1.36 fosc** \n47 30 1.47 f osc 1.45 fosc* 1.44 fosc** \n57 50 1.56 f osc 1.53 fosc* 1.50 fosc** \n67 70 1.68 f osc 1.65 fosc* 1.59 fosc** \n77 100 1.85 f osc 1.76 fosc* 1.68 fosc** \n87 150 1.93 f osc 1.82 fosc* 1.75 fosc** \nThe effect of the multiplexer input parameters (on-state \ncapacitance and resistance) can be observed from the table \nwhere the normal oscillation frequency and modified \nfrequencies due to different degradation levels have been \nshifted from their nominal values. The fault-free frequency \nhas decreased by 7% while the full-range of the output \nfrequency between the fault-free and the faulty cases has \nalso decreased from 1.93% without AMUX to around \n1.82% with the AMUX.  \nThe ribbon cable parameters have also affected the \nmeasurements, where the fault-free oscillation frequency \nhas decreased by 12%. The full-range measurements have \nalso been limited by the self and coupling capacitances \nfrom 1.82% with single wires to around 1.75% with ribbon \ncable.  \n \nFig. 19 Temperature impact on the oscillation frequency \nmeasurements for fault-free and faulty electrodes. \nThe impact of the temperature on the measurements and \nthe test circuit has been considered in another experiment. \nThe frequency readings for the fault-free electrode and \nthree other electrodes that where degraded at different \nlevels by applying voltage stress pulses of 1V amplitude \n11 \n \nfor different periods have been recorded for a temperature \nrange from 10 oC to 55 oC (Figure 19). The measurements \nshowed that the oscillation frequency decreased by around \n-3% of its nominal value for the fault-free and faulty \nelectrodes when the temperature increased from 10 oC to \n55 oC. We can conclude that the difference in the \nmeasurements at each  temperature is constant and the \nfinal condition monitoring output will not be affected by \nthe temperature because of the relative measurements. \nTo check and validate the test technique for other types of \ndefects, three electrodes were chosen to verify the \neffectiveness for short and open circuits. Electrodes 57 and \n58 have been shorted at the contact pins while an open \ncircuit has been made by splitting the contact pin from the \ncontact pad for electrode number 63. In the first case, the \noscillation frequency has decreased to around 30% of its \nnormal value because the effective surface area has \nphysically doubled due to the short between the electrodes. \nIn the second case, and due to the open circuit between the \ncontact pin and the contact pad, the output frequency has \nincreased to around 230% of its normal value. This \nsuggests that this test technique can easily detect the faulty \nelectrodes at different levels of degradation, and \ndistinguish them from other different types of faults due to \nthe frequency measurements and their deviation from the \nnormal value. \n \n6. Conclusions \nIn this paper, an oscillation based monitoring strategy \npresented in [24,25] has been applied to a fluidic chip with \nembedded electrodes for conductivity measurements and a \nsystem level implementation of an on-line condition \nmonitoring structure defined. This technique is based on \nthe sensitivity of the bio-fluidic interface capacitance to \ndegradation, contamination and fouling. The design of the \nmonitoring structure has been evaluated through physical \ncharacterisation involving data extracted for both the \nelectrode-based microfluidic mixing chip and a multi \nelectrode array used in [24,25] where a real time health \nmonitoring technique has been presented. The technique \nprovides an analogue value directly related to the \ndegradation of the electrode, so has the ability to provide \non-line degradation detection for a range of conditions on \nthe electrode surface. \nThe possibility of using this technique to detect other types \nof degradation needs to be considered and the validation of \nthe on-line application of this solution to a normal \noperating MEA requires further study. \nFuture work will involve further investigation into \ndegradation mechanisms across range of applications. In \naddition, the further development of architectures where \nthe integration of this technique into a higher level control \nsystem will support adaptability to ensure defective \nelectrodes can be switched out of the system and the array \nreconfigured to maintain functionality. Of further \nimportance is how electrode monitoring strategies can be \nintegrated with other sensors and test solutions within a \nportable instrument. \n \n7.
