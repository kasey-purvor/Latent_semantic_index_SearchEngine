The word \u2018society\u2019 is derived from the La-\ntin societas, and was used to refer to a fellowship or group\nof individuals with a common interest. In this sense it\nmight be reasonably argued that working and pet dogs\nare an integral part of a society shared with us.\nClearly dogs and humans have had a particularly close\nrelationship for many thousands of years and indeed it\nhas been suggested that the partnership is derived from\nco-evolution between the two species (Schleidt and Shalter,\n2003). Dogs certainly show a remarkable ability to read a\nrange of human communicative gestures such as gaze ori-\nentation (Ga\u00b4csi et al., 2004) and pointing (Soproni et al.,\n2002) and it is increasingly argued that such abilities were\ninstrumental to the evolution of the dog (Hare et al.,\n2002; Miklo\u00b4si, 2007). Humans also appear intuitively to\nunderstand some aspects of dog behaviour, such as certain\nforms of vocalisation (Molna\u00b4r et al., 2006). But communi-\ncation between the two species is not without difficulty at\ntimes, as the data on dog bite injuries, as is presented by\nBelen Rosado and colleagues in this issue of The Veterinary\nJournal (Rosado et al., 2008).\nDogs are not however malicious, and aggression is gen-\nerally not a response without good cause, thus each bite\nrepresents a failure in communication and a failing of\nour society. It is worth noting that in the study reported\nhere, only 3% of bites were from supposedly \u2018dangerous\nbreeds\u2019 and different groups of people appear to be at dif-\nferent levels of risk, so this is clearly not simply a dog prob-\nlem that needs to be addressed but rather one relating to\nhuman\u2013dog interaction.\nAccordingly, preventive strategies need to be aimed at\nboth human and dog behaviour and education. In order\nto develop effective preventive programmes it is essential\nto recognise the importance of data relating to the circum-\nstances leading to a dog bite injury. Unfortunately this ap-\npears to be particularly difficult to obtain; in the current\nstudy (Rosado et al., 2008), the circumstances were only re-\ncorded in 169\/4186 bite incidents, which equates to a 4%\nlevel of reporting. While this may seem to be a relatively\nstraightforward exercise, future research will need to iden-1090-0233\/$ - see front matter \u0002 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.tvjl.2008.07.014E\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\ntify why this information is difficult to obtain; even mea-\nsures aimed at increasing staff motivation to record such\ndata have generally failed to improve success (Bernardo\net al., 2002).\nIn the interim we should aim to increase education\nabout dog behaviour, since the average school child\nseems to know more about dinosaurs and fictitious crea-\ntures than those with which it may interact on a daily ba-\nsis. Understanding dog behaviour can also help us\nunderstand our own behaviour better and so may benefit\nsociety in other ways. With this in mind, an educational\nprogramme is currently being developed in the UK (K.\nShepherd, personal communication), using aggression in\ndogs as a model to explain to school children why people\nmight become aggressive and the importance of good\ncommunication in its prevention. There is also growing\ninterest in pet dog keeping in China, (a country where\nuntil recently advertising pet food was illegal), since the\ngovernment there too appear to have identified the value\nof dogs in developing human social and communicative\nskills \u2013 an obvious priority for a country with a one child\nfamily policy.\nAnother feature of society is the implied social contract,\nin which individuals surrender certain freedoms in order to\nmaintain a relationship. In this respect, dogs appear to be\ngood members of our society. They are renowned for their\nfaithfulness and even selectively respond to human direc-\ntion when it contradicts their own sense of smell (Szetei\net al., 2003); there is also a growing list of recognised phys-\nical and psychological benefits that come from dog owner-\nship and interaction. By contrast, humans as a species\nappear more willing to surrender their responsibility to\nsociety as statistics relating to the turnover in pet dog own-\nership show (Patronek and Rowan, 1995).\nPerhaps when we appreciate how much dogs are genu-\ninely an integral part of our society we will be more pre-\npared and willing to seek out solutions of mutual benefit\nto both species rather than simplify the problem to the level\nof self-interest. Confucius said: \u2018Consideration for others is\nthe basic of a good life, a good society\u2019, and current evi-\ndence suggests that we should include dogs in this\nconsideration.\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120Q1\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n2 Guest Editorial \/ The Veterinary Journal xxx (2008) xxx\u2013xxx\nYTVJL 2110 No. of Pages 2, Model 5+\n8 August 2008; Disk Used\nARTICLE IN PRESSDaniel S.
