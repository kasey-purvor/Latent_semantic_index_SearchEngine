If agricultural producers receive su\u00a2 cient weight in the government\u0092s\nsocial welfare function then a policy of price supports combined with government purchases of the resulting\nsurplus may be optimal.\nKeywords: Price supports; Excess supply; Stockpiles; Optimal taxation\nJEL classi\u0085cation: H21; H23; Q18\n2\n1 Introduction\nIn its heyday, Europe\u0092s common agricultural policy (CAP) led to huge stockpiles of agricultural products.\nColorful terms like \u0093butter mountains\u0094 and \u0093wine lakes\u0094 were common. This policy appears wasteful.\nHowever, it may actually be optimal, given the policymakers\u0092preferences and the constraints that they face.\nThe idea is quite simple. Suppose agricultural producers receive much weight in the government\u0092s social\nwelfare function. This could be due to political reasons or any other social objectives. In this setting, the\ngovernment has an incentive to use its policy instruments to redistribute income in favor of this group. But\nthere may be obstacles that deter direct redistribution. For instance, it is generally accepted that lump sum\nredistribution is not feasible. Also, the income tax is not suited for sector speci\u0085c redistribution. So other\npolicy tools must be used, and price supports are a candidate. The government can use taxes and subsidies\nto raise the relative price of agricultural products at the producer level. Presumably the government could\nalso use its policy instruments to manipulate consumer prices in such a way that these markets just clear.\nBut in a general equilibrium setting, any price distortion in one market can have feedback e\u00a4ects in other\nmarkets. Hence, there is no a priori reason to believe that the optimal policy is one in which all markets just\nclear. It may be optimal to allow the private sector to produce more than it consumes, with the government\nstepping in to purchase the surplus and simply store it in stockpiles. Ideally, one would like to see these\nstockpiles put to good use. However, it may be impossible to achieve this through the price system because\nof adverse general equilibrium e\u00a4ects. Of course, there may be other policies that can e\u00a4ectively put the\nstockpiles to use (e.g., price discrimination through food vouchers for the poor, or dumping the surplus on\ninternational markets), but that is beyond the focus of this paper. Here, the goal is simply to demonstrate\na set of circumstances under which stockpiles could be optimal.\nSection 2 presents a simple general equilibrium example that illustrates the possibility described above.\nThe key feature is the following. The good in excess supply (agricultural output) is a consumption com-\nplement, at the aggregate level, of other goods for which the market just clears. Under this assumption,\nconsider what happens if the consumer price of the agricultural product is lowered in an e\u00a4ort to stimulate\ndemand, thus reducing the size of the stockpile: The demand for the complements also increases. This causes\ndemand to exceed supply for the complements, which cannot be an equilibrium. It may be possible to restore\nequilibrium by adjusting other prices. But if the interactions between markets are su\u00a2 ciently complex, then\nall of these new equilibria may have lower social welfare than the original equilibrium. Under this scenario,\nthe stockpile is optimal.\n3\n2 Example\nThere are four commodities: two types of specialized labor\/leisure and two \u0085nal goods. Type ` labor is\nused to produce good x. This is the agricultural sector. Type n labor is used to produce good y. This is\nthe manufacturing sector. Intermediate goods are not included in order to keep the analysis simple. Thus\ngoods x and y are consumed directly by households.\nProduction is organized as follows. Agricultural production is carried out by a single self-employed farmer.\nManufacturing, on the other hand, is carried out by one private sector \u0085rm that has constant returns to its\nonly input, factory labor. Thus there are no pro\u0085ts to be distributed to households. Labor is completely\nspecialized. That is, the farmer cannot provide labor for manufacturing, and factory workers cannot work\nthe land. This could be justi\u0085ed through a comparative advantage argument. The assumption that all\nagricultural output is generated by household production is clearly unrealistic. However, a model with both\ncorporate farms and household farms would add little to the story.\nThere are only two consumers. One is the farmer. The other is a factory worker.\nConsumer 1 (self-employed farmer) has the following utility function:\nU1(`1; x1; y1) = \u00121 log `1 + log(minfx1; y1g)\nwhich is written here as a function of consumption levels (not net demands). The assumption that x and y are\nperfect complements is analytically convenient. The endowment is \u0016L1 units of labor\/leisure. The technology\nfor producing agricultural output is as follows. One unit of labor yields one unit of good x. Let qx and\nqy denote consumer prices, and let px be the producer price for food. (Then qx \u0000 px = tax, or subsidy if\nnegative.) The budget constraint is\nqxx1 + qyy1 \u0014 px(\u0016L1 \u0000 `1):\nThis forces the farmer to sell all output through the market. This turns out to be an innocuous restriction\nsince production of x will be subsidized (px > qx). Thus, the farmer would rather sell all output then buy\nx1 of it back, rather than bypass the market and eat x1 directly. The utility maximizing consumption levels\nare\n`1 =\n\u00121\n1 + \u00121\n\u0016L1; x1 = y1 =\n1\n1 + \u00121\npx\nqx + qy\n\u0016L1\nand the aggregate supply of food is X = \u0016L1 \u0000 `1 = \u0016L1=(1 + \u00121). Indirect utility is V1 = log[px=(qx + qy)] +\nconstant.\nConsumer 2 (factory worker) has the following utility function:\nU2(n2; x2; y2) = \u00122 log(minfn2; x2g) + log y2:\nThe endowment is \u0016N2 units of labor\/leisure. The budget constraint is\nqxx2 + qyy2 \u0014 qn( \u0016N2 \u0000 n2):\n4\nThe utility maximizing consumption levels are\nn2 = x2 =\n\u00122\n1 + \u00122\nqn\nqn + qx\n\u0016N2; y2 =\n1\n1 + \u00122\nqn\nqy\n\u0016N2\nand the aggregate supply of factory labor is \u0016N2\u0000n2. Indirect utility is V2 = \u00122 log[qn=(qn+qx)]+log(qn=qy)+\nconstant.\nThe manufacturing \u0085rm can transform factory labor one-for-one into good y. Thus the production\nconstraint is Y \u0014 \u0016N2 \u0000 n2. The direct social welfare function is W = \u000bU1 + U2.\nThe government solves an optimal taxation problem (e.g., Auerbach, 1985; Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971;\nand Mirrlees, 1986). Indirect social welfare is maximized subject to the weak inequalities for market clearing.\nBy Walras\u0092Law, the government\u0092s budget constraint is satis\u0085ed with equality. That is, the cost of buying\nthe surplus equals the net revenue from taxation:\npx(X \u0000 x1 \u0000 x2) = (pn \u0000 qn)( \u0016N2 \u0000 n2) + (qx \u0000 px)(x1 + x2) + (qy \u0000 py)(y1 + y2):\nThis holds because both consumers satisfy their budget constraints with equality, the market for good y just\nclears, and the manufacturing \u0085rm earns zero pro\u0085ts.\nIf the level of agricultural production leads to excess supply, the market clearing condition for good x\nwill not bind. Then the government\u0092s problem is to choose px, qx, qy, and qn to maximize \u000bV1 + V2 subject\nto y1 + y2 \u0014 Y \u0014 \u0016N2 \u0000 n2 where the consumption quantities are given by the solutions to the consumers\u0092\nproblems. Given the structure of the example \u0097 in particular, the perfect complements and the constant\nsolution for `1 \u0097 the government\u0092s problem can be written\nmaximize \u000bU1 + U2 = \u000b log y1 + \u00122 log n2 + log y2 + constant\nsubject to y1 + y2 + n2 \u0014 \u0016N2\nwhere the choice variables are now the quantities y1, y2, and n2. The prices that support the optimal\nallocation can then be inferred by inverting the consumers\u0092demand functions.1 The solution is\ny1 = x1 =\n\u000b\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0016N2; n2 = x2 =\n\u00122\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0016N2; y2 =\n1\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0016N2:\n(Recall that the perfect complements satisfy y1 = x1 and n2 = x2.) And from the farmer\u0092s problem,\n`1 = \u00121 \u0016L1=(1 + \u00121). With the normalization qx = 1, the optimal prices are\npx = (1 + \u00121)\n\u0012\n1 +\n\u000b\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0013 \u0016N2\n\u0016L1\n; qn =\n1 + \u00122\n\u000b\n; qy =\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u000b\n:\nFinally, we must con\u0085rm that this optimum indeed has excess supply in the market for good x, i.e.,\nx1+x2 < X = \u0016L1\u0000 `1. Also, agricultural production must be subsidized: px > qx. After substitution, these\n1This is just a change of variables. Rather than optimizing over the four nominal variables px, qx, qy , and qn, one can optimize\nover the three real variables y1 = (1 + \u00121)\u00001 \u0016L1px=(qx + qy), y2 = (1 + \u00122)\u00001 \u0016N2qn=qy , and n2 = \u00122(1 + \u00122)\u00001 \u0016N2qn=(qn + qx).\n5\ninequalities lead to the following parameter restrictions:\n(1 + \u00121)\n\u0012\n1\u0000 1\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0013\n<\n\u0016L1\n\u0016N2\n< (1 + \u00121)\n\u0012\n1 +\n\u000b\n1 + \u000b+ \u00122\n\u0013\n:\nIt follows that there is an open set of parameter values for which agricultural stockpiles are optimal. In\nparticular, if the consumers\u0092parameters satisfy\n1 + \u00121 <\n\u0016L1\n\u0016N2\n< 2(1 + \u00121);\nthen stockpiles are optimal for all su\u00a2 ciently large values of \u000b, i.e., for all su\u00a2 ciently large welfare weights\non the farmer.\n3 Discussion\nThe example is designed to be simple, but there is nothing pathological about it. For instance, it does not\nviolate the Diamond\u0096Mirrlees (1971) production e\u00a2 ciency theorem. Production here is e\u00a2 cient; distribution\nis not so e\u00a2 cient. As a general matter, the optimal tax problem will select the most desirable allocation\nfrom among those that are both productively feasible and market feasible (i.e., attainable through the price\nsystem). The Diamond\u0096Mirrlees theorem tells us that the optimum must lie on the frontier of the production\npossibilities set. There are no further restrictions that tell us where on the frontier we will end up. Nor is\nthere any requirement that the production point must coincide with the consumption point. In the example,\nthe gap between the production and consumption of good x allows us to achieve a higher level of social\nwelfare. If we were to require this market to just clear, welfare would necessarily be lower (for the range of\nparameter values indicated above).\nOne might object that the example\u0092s optimal tax problem has a producer price, px, among the choice\nvariables. Perhaps this drives the result? Standard optimal tax problems contain only consumer prices.\nHowever, such an objection is not warranted. We can easily convert the example into the standard form and\nget exactly the same result, optimal excess supply. The interpretation would be di\u00a4erent but the analysis\nwould remain as above. Suppose the self-employed farmer is split into two separate economic entities: a farm\nworker (consumer) and a farm (\u0085rm). The farm worker now earns labor income at the wage rate q`, while\nthe farm uses the one-for-one technology to transform farm labor into agricultural output. So q` replaces px\nin consumer 1\u0092s problem, but all else remains the same. The drawback is that the example no longer tells a\nstory about agricultural price supports.\nConsider the general form of an optimal tax problem. This may help shed some light on the example.\nThe government\u0092s choice variable is a vector of prices q, and perhaps also a head tax\/subsidy T . The\nobjective is to maximize an indirect social welfare function W (q; T ) subject to a number of market clearing\nconditions. If those conditions can be written as F1(q; T ) \u0014 0, . . . , Fn(q; T ) \u0014 0 with n > 1, then the\n6\nDiamond\u0096Mirrlees theorem tells us that at least one of these inequalities must bind; it does not tell us that\nall of them must bind. And indeed, this is what happens in the example. More generally, whenever there\nare specialized factors of production, it may be possible to express the market clearing conditions in this\nway with n > 1. This opens up the possibility for optimal excess supply. Whether the possibility becomes\na reality depends on both private preferences (demand functions) and social preferences. The example\u0092s\ndemand complementarities and social welfare weights provide a combination that yields optimal stockpiles.\nOther combinations are surely possible.2 A general set of conditions awaits future research.\n2Guesnerie (1995, section 5.2.2) demonstrates that as the social welfare weights vary over all possible values, the set of\nall optimal tax equilibria becomes large. If there are su\u00a2 ciently many heterogeneous households, this set will generically be\na manifold with the same dimension as the frontier of the aggregate production possibilities set. If we also allow private\npreferences to vary, this set will become an even larger part of the production frontier \u0097 larger than the set where all n of the\nconstraints Fi(q; T ) \u0014 0 bind.\n7\nReferences\n[1] Auerbach, Alan J., 1985, The theory of excess burden and optimal taxation, in: Alan J.
