In the present work we explore the\ndeposition of highly diluted solutions of pure and Ca-modified lead titanates to prepare\nultrathin ferroelectric films, the thickness of which is controlled by the concentration\nof the precursor solution. The results show that we are able to obtain single crystalline\nphase continuous films down to 18 nm thickness, one of the lowest reported using\nthese methods. Below that thickness, the films start to be discontinuous, which is\nattributed to a microstructural instability that can be controlled by an adequate tailoring\nof the processing conditions. The effect of the reduction of thickness on the\npiezoelectric behavior is studied by piezoresponse force microscopy. The results\nindicate that films retain a significant piezoelectric activity regardless of their low\nthickness, which is promising for their eventual integration in nanodevices, for\nexample, as transducer elements in nanoelectromechanical systems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFerroelectric lead titanate based thin films have\nextensively been studied for their applications as active\nelements in nonvolatile ferroelectric memories (NV-\nFeRAM)1,2 and microelectromechanical systems\n(MEMS).3 However, the modern electronics industry de-\nmands an ever-larger degree of integration, shrinking the\ndevice dimensions down to the nanoscale. The reduction\nof the lateral memory cell size in FeRAMs means higher\nstorage densities, which has recently reached 10 Tbit\/\nin.2.4 Regarding the nanoelectromechanical systems\n(NEMS), one of the major challenges they face now is\nrelated to the search of alternative transduction ele-\nments,5 as most of the techniques used in MEMS reach\ntheir limits in the nanoscale. Several attempts have been\ncarried out, such as the use of piezoresistors for sensing6\nor piezoelectric actuation of semiconductor GaAs,7 but\nthe use of piezoelectric transduction with ferroelectric\nfilms has not been explored yet. Further development in\nthe fabrication methods of ferroelectric oxide nanostruc-\ntures to be integrated in the new nanodevices is therefore\na key issue, not only because of their technological po-\ntential, but also because of the unique properties of fer-\nroelectrics with reduced dimensions.8\u201311\nAmong the strategies used to prepare high-quality\nferroelectric films for their integration in devices, chemi-\ncal solution deposition (CSD) methods present clear ad-\nvantages with respect to other deposition techniques,\nsuch as the high degree of compositional control, large\na)Address all correspondence to this author.\ne-mail: jricote@icmm.csic.es\nDOI: 10.1557\/JMR.2008.0345\nJ.

These characteristics\nhave made them the preferred choice to prepare a wide\nrange of electronic oxide films.12 However, CSD has\ntraditionally been regarded as an unsuitable method for\nthe deposition of ultrathin films (below 100 nm). This is\nbecause of the incomplete coating of the substrates ob-\nserved for very thin films prepared by CSD. This lack of\ncontinuity is responsible for shorts in the capacitor struc-\nture and renders the ultrathin CSD films useless for ap-\nplications. Several studies have reported that the films\nbreak up into discrete islands for thickness below a criti-\ncal value and after high-temperature annealing.13,14 The\nresulting structures with nanometric lateral sizes have\nbeen used to develop a method of self-patterning of nano-\nstructures for high-density memories,15,16 although they\nstill present several practical problems. One of them is\ntheir distribution in regular patterns, which can be solved\nby depositing the films onto patterned structures17,18\nor by microemulsion-aided preparation methods, which\nhave shown the first evidences of periodic order of\nthe ferroelectric nanostructures when deposited on\nsingle-crystal substrates.19 Although this may be a good\nbottom-up approach for the fabrication of regular arrays\nof capacitors for memory cells, the more complex\nstructures used in NEMS may require most probably a\nlithography-based, top\u2013down approach. For this, it is es-\nsential to prepare high-quality, continuous ultrathin fer-\nroelectric films, preferably on Si-based substrates, so\nthey can eventually be integrated as transducer elements\nin NEMS.\nAlthough there are not many reports on the subject, the\nstrategies used to prepare ultrathin ferroelectric films by\nCSD are varied. The use of solid solutions of Bi2SiO5\nand ferroelectric compositions20 allows the preparation\nof ultrathin films (13\u201325 nm) at lower crystallization\ntemperatures than those of the original ferroelectrics. An-\nother approach to obtain the thinnest continuous film\npossible is based on the control of grain growth by the\nuse of rapid thermal processing (RTP) and the deposition\nof the Pt top electrode on the amorphous film before\nannealing.21 The authors claim that an excessive grain\ngrowth may lead to highly irregular layers, with shorts in\nthe capacitor structure, and they achieve strontium\nbismuth tantalate films down to 25 nm thickness, al-\nthough the paper gives no indication about the strategy\nfollowed to achieve the different thickness. By multiple\ndepositions of very diluted solutions, ferroelectric films\ndown to approximately 20\u201350 nm thickness with macro-\nscopically addressable properties have recently been\nachieved,22 showing once again an apparent lowest\nthickness limit for CSD films. This limit seems to be\nbroken only when no high-temperature annealing proce-\ndures are required for the preparation of the film, mostly\nin nonferroelectric compositions,23,24 although a success-\nful result on ferroelectric lanthanum modified lead zir-\nconate titanate with thickness as small as 9 nm just pub-\nlished25 confirms the viability of CSD to produce ultra-\nthin ferroelectrics. In the present work, we explore the\nchallenges of CSD preparation of ferroelectric ultrathin\nfilms by the deposition of highly diluted solutions, which\nalso allows crystallization at relatively low tempera-\ntures.26\u201328 We present the preparation of pure and Ca-\nmodified lead titanate ferroelectric films from several\nhighly diluted solutions reducing the film thickness down\nto \u223c18 nm. From the analysis of the results we discuss the\nfactors that control the growth of ultrathin films with a\ngood coverage of the substrate by CSD. The piezoelectric\nbehavior of the films is studied by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nAir-stable precursor solutions of PbTiO3 (PT) and\n(Pb0.76Ca0.24)TiO3 (PCT) nominal compositions with a\n10 mol% PbO excess were synthesized by a sol-gel route\nthat uses a diol (1,3 propanediol) as solvent in the case of\nthe PT composition,29 and a mixture of diol and water for\nthe PCT.30 The stock solutions were diluted with 1,3\npropanediol to obtain concentrations between 0.3 and\n0.025 M. This type of solution has proved to be an ap-\npropriate precursor for the preparation of ultrathin\nfilms.28 The diluted solutions were then deposited by\nspin coating at 2000 rpm for 45 s onto Pt\/TiO2\/SiO2\/\n(100)Si substrates. A single layer was deposited. After\ndrying at 350 \u00b0C for 60 s on a hot plate, crystallization\nwas carried out in air by rapid thermal processing (RTP)\nat 650 \u00b0C for 50 s, with a heating rate of \u223c30 \u00b0C\/s.\nGrazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a\nSiemens D500 diffractometer (Berlin-Munich, Germany)\nat an incidence angle of 1\u00b0 was used to confirm that the\nfilms are single perovskite phase. Film thicknesses were\ndetermined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Measure-\nments were carried out in a phase-modulated ellipsom-\neter Jobin Yvon UVISEL (Longjumeau, France) operat-\ning between 1.5 and 4.5 eV. The sample structure was\nsimulated as two layers (film and substrate) and voids\nusing the Bruggerman effective medium approximation.\nA dense PCT ceramic and a naked substrate were used as\nreferences for the film and substrate, respectively. We\nobserve that an increase of the void content is related to\nan increase of roughness or the result of the loss of con-\ntinuity in the film. A fairly good agreement between\nmeasured and calculated complex dielectric coefficients\nis obtained.\nTo study the films by transmission electron micros-\ncopy (TEM), cross sections were prepared using a fo-\ncused ion beam workstation (FEI FIB2000, Hillsboro,\nOR) following the so-called lift-out method.31 A protec-\ntive layer was deposited onto the surface to protect the\nfilm during the cutting of the thin lamella. Due to the ion\nJ. Ricote et al.: Fabrication of continuous ultrathin ferroelectric films by chemical solution deposition methods\nJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 23, No. 10, Oct 20082788\nbeam exposure this layer becomes gradually amorphous\nin its outer part, although it is crystalline close to the\nultrathin films under study. This can be observed in the\nTEM images. The cut and freed lamellas were transferred\nto Cu grids with a Narishige micromanipulator (Tokyo,\nJapan). The samples were studied with a Tecnai-20 FEG\nTEM (FEI) working at 200 kV.\nA commercial scanning force microscope (SFM)\n(Nanotec Electr\u00f3nica with WSxM software) was used to\nstudy the surface topography and local piezoelectric ac-\ntivity of the films by piezoresponse force microscopy\n(PFM).32 In this work, we have used conductive com-\nmercial Pt\/Ir coated tips (Nanosensors) on cantilevers\nwith a force constant of 42 N\/m and resonance frequency\nof 320 kHz to apply an ac voltage of 1 V at 50 kHz.\nRemanent local piezoelectric hysteresis loops have been\nobtained at different locations for the films studied.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe ultrathin films prepared by CSD of diluted solu-\ntions are perovskite single phase according to the grazing\nincidence x-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 1. Apart\nfrom some reflections coming from layers of the sub-\nstrate, such as Pt or TiO2, the rest can be identified as\nbelonging to the perovskite phase. Reflections 001 and\n002 are not observed, most probably because of a strong\npreferential orientation of the films, although no system-\natic texture analysis has been carried out, and GIXRD\ndata can be misleading. The variation of the film thick-\nness with the dilution of the precursor solutions is shown\nin Fig. 2 for the single perovskite phase PT and PCT\nfilms. In both PT and PCT films, as the concentration of\nthe precursor solution (c) decreases, the film thickness (t)\ndecreases. This is the expected tendency according to\ntheoretical models developed for films deposited by spin-\nning of solutions.33 Simple correlations such as t\u0001 A cn\nhave been proposed for spin-coated polymer films34\n(where A and n are parameters that depend on the chemi-\ncal system and the spinning speed). The effect of the\ncrystallization on the final thickness is not considered in\nthese models, and in principle it cannot be applied to our\nproblem, although a good fit of our data can be obtained\nwith second-order polynomial functions (lines in Fig. 2),\nwhich are not far from the predictions of the simplified\nmodels mentioned. However, it can be seen that this\ncorrelation is lost for the thinnest films, obtained from\nsolutions with concentrations below 0.1 M. This can be\nexplained by a study of cross sections of these films with\nTEM (Fig. 3). The films obtained from solutions with\nconcentrations of 0.1 M or above [Fig. 3(a)] are continu-\nous, i.e., with a full coverage of the substrate. The thick-\nnesses measured in the micrographs corroborate the val-\nues obtained by ellipsometry. Direct measurements on\nthe micrograph of Fig. 3(a) give film thickness values\nbetween 15 and 19 nm, which reflects the small height\nvariations of the grains. Values from the fitting of the\nellipsometry curves on the same film (agreement factor\nof the simulation: R2\u0001 0.91) produce a similar value: 18\nnm. This is the thinnest continuous film we have pre-\npared. Films prepared with more diluted solutions result\nin discrete islands randomly distributed on the surface, as\ncan be seen in Fig. 3(b). The height of these structures is\nbetween 17 and 21 nm, larger than the thickness value (9\nnm) obtained by ellipsometry, which is in fact an average\nof the heights over areas with and without islands of\nmaterial.\nThe analysis of the surface topography of the PT films\nwas carried out by SFM (Fig. 4). A decrease of the grain\nsize as the concentration of the precursor solution and the\nfilm thickness decrease is observed: from 100\u2013200 nm of\nthe film prepared from a 0.3 M solution [Fig. 4(a)] to\n60\u2013120 nm of the one from 0.1 M [Fig. 4(d)]. The grain\nsize is rather large compared with the measured film\nFIG. 1.

Res., Vol. 23, No. 10, Oct 2008 2789\nthickness (below 60 nm), which indicates a large lateral,\nin-plane growth of the crystals. This corroborates the\nidea that the grains grow 3D until grain size is larger than\nthickness. A further decrease of the thickness by reduc-\ning the concentration of the precursor solution results in\nthe formation of isolated structures instead of a thinner\ncontinuous film. This is in agreement with the model that\npredicts that above a critical grain size to thickness ratio,\nthe grain growth is no longer the dominant energy re-\nduction mechanism, and spheroidization and the forma-\ntion of isolated structures occurs.13 These results suggest\nthat the key to producing thinner continuous films is the\ncontrol of this ratio, i.e., the reduction of the grain size by\nthe adequate choice of the processing parameters of the\nfilms. This can be achieved by a reduction of the prepa-\nration temperature, but this must be above the one of\nphase formation. This is an important limitation in fer-\nroelectrics, which usually requires high crystallization\ntemperatures, and may explain why thinner CSD films\nare only available when lower processing temperatures\nare required.23,24 Although it has been reported that the\ncrystallization temperatures can be reduced by a ultra-\nviolet (UV)-assisted method,27 other parameters can lead\nto thickness reduction, such as modifications of the sol-\nvent chemistry. Further work in this direction is in\nprogress and will be reported separately.\nHowever, variants of the same mechanism that should\nbe taken into account can be observed in other systems,\nas shown by the study of the films of Ca-modified lead\ntitanate films (Fig. 5). The main difference is that in this\ncase the initial grain size is smaller, which seems to\ncorrelate with the introduction of Ca2+. Ca-modified lead\ntitanate films are derived from solutions with higher het-\nerogeneity than those of pure lead titanate. In fact, the\nformer is a solution resulting from the mixture of a Pb\u2013\nTi\u2013sol and an aqueous Ca\u2013acetate solution, and the latter\nis a real Pb\u2013Ti\u2013sol.35 Although this difference may be an\nimportant factor, it should also be considered that the\nthermal decomposition of Ca2+ and Pb2+ reagents (in\nboth cases acetates) are not the same either. While Ca\nacetate decomposes through the formation of an interme-\ndiate carbonate stable at high temperatures,36 Pb acetate\ntransforms directly in CO2, H2O, and PbO at relatively\nlow temperatures. Therefore, the nucleation and crystal-\nlization process cannot be the same, leading to different\nmicrostructures, as observed when Figs. 4 and 5 are com-\npared. This effect has been reported for other films con-\ntaining alkaline-earth cations, such as BaTiO3 and Sr-\nTiO3,37 and discussed for Ca-modified PbTiO3 in a pre-\nvious paper.38 It seems that grain growth is somehow\nFIG. 2.

Res., Vol. 23, No. 10, Oct 20082790\ninhibited in this system, which results instead in the for-\nmation of clusters of grains, visible in the films with\nlarger thickness [Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)], but not clearly in\nthe films obtained from more diluted solutions [Figs. 5(c)\nand 5(d)], which can be attributed to a decrease of the\ncluster size due to the thickness reduction. Moreover,\nwhen the concentration of the dilution is below 0.1 M the\nfilms break into separated clusters of grains [Figs. 5(e)\nand 5(f)], which may be explained if we consider that in\nthis case the cluster size, instead of the grain size, is the\nfactor that controls the formation of continuous films.\nThe mechanisms seem to be similar, but the factor whose\ncontrol will allow us to prepare continuous film below a\ncertain thickness by this method is now the cluster size.\nTo assess the piezoelectric activity, we have measured\nlocal piezoelectric hysteresis loops (Figs. 6 and 7) on\nthose grains showing the highest out-of-plane piezore-\nsponse values. Our results show that the reduction of the\nfilm thickness from \u223c50 to \u223c20 nm in both pure and\nCa-modified is accompanied by a decrease of the d33eff\nvalues, which is in agreement with the tendency already\nobserved in similar thicker polycrystalline ferroelectric\nfilms, with values in the range of 0.5 to 8 \u0001m.39,40 One\nof the possible factors causing this reduction of the pi-\nezoelectric activity may be the increase of the residual\nstress with the decrease of the film thickness. This will\nreduce the mobility of the non-180\u00b0 ferroelectric domain\nwalls, which is responsible for one of the most important\nFIG. 4.

Ricote et al.: Fabrication of continuous ultrathin ferroelectric films by chemical solution deposition methods\nJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 23, No. 10, Oct 2008 2791\ncontributions to the piezoelectric coefficient. However,\nin our case PFM images confirm that grains are monodo-\nmain, and therefore this argument is not applicable.\nOther factors such as crystallographic orientation or\ngrain size effects must be considered. As the nucleation\nsites of the oriented grains are at the interface between\nsubstrate and film, a decrease of the thickness when a\nsingle layer is deposited usually results in stronger pref-\nerential orientations in the films,41 which is accompanied\nby a change of their piezoelectric behavior. It is difficult\nto assess the texture evolution in such thin films, where\nthe small amount of material deposited makes it hard to\nobtain strong diffraction peaks to undertake a reliable\ntexture characterization. However, we can argue that we\nwill obtain similar preferential orientation to the one ob-\ntained in thicker films prepared by the same processing\napproach used in this paper.42 On platinized Si-based\nsubstrates, preferential orientation was observed along\nthe nonpolar axis \u2329100\u232a. Therefore, even in the case that\nthis orientation is stronger for the ultrathin films, it will\nnot lead to strong variations of the piezoelectric behavior.\nBy this argument texture variation may be discarded as a\nrelevant factor for our CSD polycrystalline ultrathin\nfilms. It is well known that the effect of grain size, which\ndecreases when the thickness is reduced (Figs. 4 and 5),\nis correlated with a decrease of the domain width. In our\ncase, as the grains are monodomain as confirmed by\nPFM images, size reduction induces a decrease in the\nFIG. 5.

The diffi-\nculties in assessing with precision the contribution of all\nthese interrelated factors in films with such a low thick-\nness complicate the task of establishing correlations be-\ntween piezoelectric response and thickness, as it has been\nextensively studied in epitaxial ultrathin ferroelectric\nfilms.43 However, we can conclude that in our case the\ngrain size plays an important role that should be studied\nin more detail by the evaluation of films of similar nano-\nmetric thickness and different grain size.\nAlthough the quantitative interpretation of the results\nobtained by PFM should be carried out with care because\nFIG. 6.

Res., Vol. 23, No. 10, Oct 2008 2793\nof several factors intrinsic to the measurement method,44\nsuch as, among others, the non-negligible electrostatic\ninteractions between the tip and the surface or the inho-\nmogeneous character of the electric field applied, we\nobserve a significant piezoelectric activity even in the\nthinnest films. This does not disappear even when the\nfilms break up into isolated structures, as can be seen in\nFig. 6(c). If we compare the values with the piezoelectric\ncoefficients obtained for GaAs integrated recently as pi-\nezoelectric actuator in a NEMS,7 they are still one order\nof magnitude higher. This makes the PbTiO3 ultrathin\nfilms studied here promising materials for use as trans-\nducer elements in devices with reduced dimensions.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe preparation of continuous ultrathin ferroelectric\nfilms by chemical solution deposition methods down to\n18 nm thickness has been achieved by the deposition of\nhighly diluted solutions. The variation of the concentra-\ntion of the precursor solution allows the control of the\nfilm thickness until a critical grain size to thickness ratio\nis reached, when the films break into isolated structures.\nThe results obtained suggest that the control of the grain\nsize, or cluster size, through the choice of the optimum\nprocessing parameters can lead to the production of thin-\nner films with a full coverage of the substrate. Thickness\nreduction, although producing a decrease of the local\npiezoelectric coefficients of the films, does not mean a\ncomplete loss of the piezoelectric response, which is still\ncompetitive for applications in nanodevices. The poly-\ncrystalline nature of these films deposited on platinized\nSi-based substrates makes grain size an important param-\neter to consider for tailoring their physical properties.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is part of the activities of the EC network of\nexcellence Multifunctional and Integrated Piezoelectric\nDevices MIND (NoE 515757), and it has been partially\nfunded by the Spanish project MAT2007-61409.\nJ.
