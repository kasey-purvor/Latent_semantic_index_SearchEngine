New York: Routledge. CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Because of its interdisciplinary nature and the logistics of fieldwork, this project has required intellectual and financial support from many sources. Maurice Bloch, anthropologist at the London School of Economics, was instrumental in initiating his and Astuti\u2019s collaboration with Susan Carey and Gregg Solomon. He piloted the adoption study with Zafimaniry children and adults in Madagascar, paving the way for our study among the Vezo. He has continued to contribute to our research in all of its stages, with moral support (especially when Astuti was in the field), insight, comments and humor. Larry Hirschfeld\u2019s work on race has inspired much of our work. At the outset, we discussed our project with him and we thank him for his intellectual input and for his patience in awaiting its outcome. Sean Epstein, Astuti\u2019s son, was in Madagascar during the period of data collection and he proved an excellent research assistant. He not only took a keen interest in the topic of biological inheritance, but also greatly facilitated Astuti\u2019s work with Vezo children. Our warmest thanks go to all the Vezo children, adolescents and adults who agreed to take part in our studies. As ever, Astuti greatly appreciated Gion Cabalzar\u2019s hospitality in Morondava. During the extended period of data analysis, the CNRS and the Institute Jean Nicod sponsored a series of interdisciplinary workshops in Paris in which all three authors participated. Thanks are due to the organizer, Dan Sperber, for these interesting meetings and for providing a venue for face-to-face work. Finally, we wish to thank the anonymous reviewers and the SRCD Monographs\u2019 editor for their careful reading of the manuscript, for their criticisms and suggestions. Astuti wishes to thank the Anthropology Department at the London School of Economics, in particular its then convener Johnny Parry, for allowing her to take time off from her teaching and administrative duties. This project could not have been completed without the extended period of research leave that Astuti has been allowed to enjoy. She would also like to thank her colleague and friend Charles Stafford for carrying a heavy load, without resenting her freedom. The monograph CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR was written at the Laboratory of Developmental Studies at Harvard, where Astuti spent a sabbatical year. She is grateful for the assistance she received from Andrew Baron and from all the other members of the Carey, Spelke and Snedeker Labs, who made her stay an outstanding and fully enjoyable experience. Many thanks also to Paul Harris, Melissa Koenig, Fabrice Clement and Laurence Kaufmann for lively and stimulating discussions. Finally, Astuti wishes to thank Lorenzo Epstein who, as always, has shared the frustrations, the excitement, and the joys of her work.","cites":null},{"id":17256288,"title":"Understanding constraints on inheritance: evidence for biological thinking in early childhood.","authors":[],"date":"2002","doi":"10.1348\/026151002320620262","raw":"Gimenez, M. and Harris, P.

Vezo therefore provide a challenging test for the innate conceptual constraints hypothesis. Four studies probed aspects of biological and sociological reasoning of Vezo children, adolescents and adults through a number of adoption scenarios. Despite ethnographic reports to the contrary, we found cross-cultural convergence in adult concepts of biological inheritance, but the pattern of development of this concept differed greatly from that seen in North America. Moreover, in agreement with the ethnographic literature, we found that Vezo adults have constructed a distinctive theory of social group identity.

By probing \nMalagasy children\u2019s and adults\u2019 conceptual representations of human and animal kind, biological \ninheritance, innate potential and family relations, the studies presented in this Monograph address \ncurrent debates about the acquisition and the nature of concepts in the domains of folkbiology and \nfolksociology. Cross-cultural and developmental studies of this kind bear on the hypothesis that \nconceptual development in these domains is supported and constrained by innate conceptual \ncontent. If so, one would expect cross-cultural universality in the relevant adult concepts and their \nearly emergence in childhood regardless of widely different input conditions. We chose to conduct \nthese studies among the Vezo of Madagascar because the ethnographic literature has attributed to \nthem folkbiological and folksociological theories that are radically different, even \nincommensurable, with those of North American adults. Vezo therefore provide a challenging test \nfor the innate conceptual constraints hypothesis. \nFour studies probed aspects of biological and sociological reasoning of Vezo children, \nadolescents and adults through a number of adoption scenarios. Despite ethnographic reports to the \ncontrary, we found cross-cultural convergence in adult concepts of biological inheritance, but the \npattern of development of this concept differed greatly from that seen in North America. Moreover, \nin agreement with the ethnographic literature, we found that Vezo adults have constructed a \ndistinctive theory of social group identity. However, we found that children\u2019s reasoning in this \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n3\n  \ndomain is under the influence of endogenous constraints that are overturned in the course of \ndevelopment. Finally, we found cross-cultural convergence in adults\u2019 concept of species kind, as \nwell as evidence for the early emergence of this concept. \nIn light of these findings, we discuss the nature of the constraints on children\u2019s conceptual \nrepresentations, the developmental process through which the adults\u2019 concepts are constructed, and \nrelations between Vezo theories of folkbiology and folksociology.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n4\n  \nChapter I. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis monograph reports the results of a collaboration between an anthropologist, who has \nconducted ethnographic research in a fishing village in Madagascar (R.A.), and two cognitive \npsychologists, who have studied conceptual development of urban North American children (G.S. \nand S.C.) Bringing together our unique expertise and distinctive methodologies, we have taken on \nthe task of analysing and comparing Malagasy adults\u2019 and Malagasy children\u2019s conceptual \nrepresentations in the domains of folkbiology and folksociology. This monograph, therefore, is a \nstudy of how conceptual development unfolds in a cultural, social and educational environment \nradically different from the one that nurtures the North American and Western European children \nwho are usually studied by developmental psychologists. \n The value of studies of this kind has been underscored by developmental psychologists of \ndifferent theoretical inclinations. For example, Diesendruck (2001) has recently advocated cross-\ncultural research, arguing that if psychologists wish to claim that a certain way of knowing the \nworld (e.g. the essentialist construal of natural kinds) is a universal \u201chabit of the mind\u201d, they must \nbe able to show that the emergence of this habit does not depend on the specific cultural input \nreceived by middle class North American children (see also Coley, 2000, and Walker, 1999, for a \nsimilar point). Conversely, the fact that biological knowledge emerges late in urban middle-class \nchildren in the US (as argued by Carey, 1985) should not be taken as evidence of a universal pattern \nof cognitive development, since the delay may be caused by the peculiarly deprived exposure to the \nnatural world experienced by this population (Medin & Atran, in press). \n From the perspective of Vygotsky-inspired cultural psychology, every study of development \nmust be culturally situated. This is because human development is a cultural process that can only \nbe understood in light of the different cultural practices and circumstances of specific communities \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n5\n  \n(Rogoff, 2003, pp. 3-4). Given the culturally specific goals of development and the varied ways in \nwhich children\u2019s apprenticeship (Rogoff, 1990) is scaffolded by institutional contexts, technologies, \nand artifacts, different paths of development are to be expected. From this standpoint, documenting \nsuch diversity through cross-cultural research is the necessary first step, prior to theoretical \ninterpretation of both variations and regularities in patterns of human development (Rogoff, 2003, \np. 7). \nThe need for cross-cultural research is of course no news to anthropologists. However, they \nrarely pay close attention to the process of conceptual development. As often noted, mainstream \nanthropologists have tended to ignore children (e.g. Hirschfeld, 2002; La Fontaine; 1986; Toren, \n1999; Montgomery, 2001). Arguably, this general lack of interest in children is rooted in what \nBoyer (1994, p. 22) calls the anthropological theory of \u201cexhaustive cultural transmission\u201d, which \nassumes that the conceptual understanding of competent adults is entirely determined by the cultural \nrepresentations on offer in the particular environment in which they grow up. On this view, children \nare passive, and thus insignificant, receptors of ready-made culture, which they imbibe like sponges \n(see Strauss & Quinn\u2019s critique of the \u201cfax model of internalization\u201d, 1997, p.23).  \nOn their part, those psychologists who have turned away from the Piagetian assumption that \ninfants are endowed only with sensori-motor representations and who, instead, attribute to them rich \ninnate conceptual representations (e.g., of number, Dehaene, 1997; Feigenson, Carey & Hauser, \n2002; Wynn, 1992; Xu & Spelke, 2000; intentional agent, Csibra, Gergely, Biro, Koos, & \nBrookbank, 1999; Gergely, Nadasady, Gergely, & Biro, 1995; Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Johnson, \nSlaughter, & Carey, 1998; Johnson, 2000; Woodward, 1998; of object, Carey & Xu, 1999; Leslie, \n1994; Spelke, Phillips, & Woodward, 1995; Spelke, Breilinger, Macomber & Jacobson, 1992) \ncredit children with the creative capacity of producing \u2013 rather than just re-producing \u2013 adult \nculture. Because children bring their own knowledge and intuitions to the task of making sense of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n6\n  \nthe world, they are capable of producing understandings that are independent, even at odds, with \nthose of their parents, elders and teachers. For example, Vosniadou (1994) has demonstrated how \nchildren\u2019s na\u00efve theory of physics mediates their interpretation of the adult testimony regarding the \nshape of the earth. What children have known since they were at least 9 months old (Baillargeon, \nKotovsky, & Needham, 1995; Spelke, 1995) about gravity (i.e., that unsupported objects fall \ndownward) and about the properties of supporting surfaces (i.e., that the ground is flat) makes it \nhard for them to conceive of the earth as a spherical astronomical object. The mental models of the \nearth that they construct along the way \u2013 a flat disc, a dual earth, a hollow sphere \u2013 are far more \nthan incorrect reproductions of adult culture. Rather, they are children\u2019s own culture (for another \nexample, see the discussion of North American children\u2019s \u201ccootie culture\u201d in Hirschfeld, 2002). \nOf course, whether rich innate knowledge potentiates and constrains children\u2019s conceptual \nrepresentations in different domains of knowledge is a question that needs to be asked on a case-by-\ncase basis. We are aware that the proposition that human infants come into their culturally and \nsocially constituted world endowed with innately specified systems of knowledge and\/or with \nhighly constrained learning mechanisms is considered by most anthropologists as an obvious non-\nstarter. The very concept of innate (pre-social) knowledge is deemed to be flawed because \u201c[human] \ncapacities are neither innately prespecified nor externally imposed, but arise within processes of \ndevelopment, as properties of dynamic self-organization of the total field of relationships in which a \nperson\u2019s life unfolds\u201d (Ingold, 2001, p.131; see also Toren, 2001; for earlier formulations see \nGeertz, 1973). Cultural psychologists, on their part, while not denying the existence of innate \nknowledge (see Shweder et al., 1998, pp. 919-922), submit that it is rarely a strong constraint. Their \nwager is that \u201crelatively few components of the human mental equipment are so inherent, so hard \nwired, or fundamental that their developmental pathway is fixed in advance and cannot be \ntransformed or altered through cultural participation\u201d (Shweder et al., 1998, p. 867; see Cole, 1996, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n7\n  \non how to relate phylogenetic and cultural constraints). Of course, this is recognized to be an \nempirical question, with profound theoretical implications.   \nWe do not believe there are a priori considerations against the hypothesis that innate \nconstraints guide conceptual development. But granted this, the question still arises as to which \ndomains of knowledge are so constrained. In this monograph, we shall address this question through \na cross-cultural examination of conceptual development in two related domains of knowledge, \nfolkbiology and folksociology. Specifically, we will engage with Medin and Atran\u2019s (in press) \nproposal regarding the existence of a folkbiological module dedicated to acquiring and organizing \nknowledge of the organic world, and with a number of converging hypotheses regarding innate \nconstraints on the representation of human kinds (Gil-White, 2001; Hirschfeld, 1996). Central to all \nthese proposals is the same nexus of putative innate concepts, which include biological inheritance, \nbirth parentage, innate potential, animal species, human kind. As we shall see, from its earliest days \nanthropologists interested in the study of kinship have been concerned with this nexus of concepts. \nFor this reason, the studies presented in this monograph meet one desideratum for successful inter-\ndisciplinary collaboration: to seek data that have theoretical import for all disciplines involved.  \nInnate constraints in folkbiology and folksociology \nIn a series of influential papers, Atran, Medin and their colleagues  (Atran, 1998; Atran, Estin, \nColey, & Medin, 1997; Lopez, Atran, Coley, Medin, & Smith, 1997; Medin & Atran, in press) have \nsuggested that innate conceptual representations guide the construction of intuitive biological \nconcepts. They have proposed the existence of a folkbiological module of the human mind, which \n\u201cdiscriminates and categorizes parts of the flux of human experience as \u2018biological\u2019, and develops \ncomplex abilities to infer and interpret this highly structured domain\u201d (Medin & Atran, in press). \nWhile they themselves document the existence of significant cultural variations between different \nfolkbiologies (e.g., Itza\u2019 Maya, Native American Menominee, urban Chicago, rural Michigan) \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n8\n  \ncaused by different histories and sets of available stimuli, they also contend that \u201cthese contingent \nfactors of time and place interact with panhuman folkbiology module in every generation\u201d. This \ninteraction between local peculiarities and universal mental endowment produces relative cultural \nstability and slow historical changes of folkbiologies, as well as constraining their cross-cultural \nvariability (Medin & Atran, in press). \nThe two hypothesised structural principles of folkbiology are ranked taxonomy and \nteleological essentialism. First, people in all cultures appear to organize living things into \nnonoverlapping taxonomic structures, which vary little across cultures and which support \nsystematic and graded inferences about the distribution of properties among species. Second, people \nacross many different cultural contexts have been found to subscribe to the commonsense \nassumption that each species has an underlying internal essence, which is inherited from biological \nprogenitors and which determines an individual\u2019s innate potential. In Medin and Atran\u2019s proposal, \ntherefore, the folkbiology module has rich biological content, since the naturalization of species \nkind is said to implicate concepts of birth parentage, biological inheritance, and innate potential \n(Atran, 1998; Medin & Atran, in press).  \nTwo types of data are offered to support the claim that this way of construing animals and \nplants is acquired under innate constraints. In addition to evidence of cross-cultural universality in \nadult conceptual representations (reviewed in Atran 1990; see also Atran, 1998; Atran et al., 1997; \nLopez et al., 1997), Medin and Atran (in press) review evidence that an essentialized and \nnaturalized construal of species emerges early in development, under widely different conditions of \ncultural input. Developmental evidence shows that at least by age 4 or 5, most North American \nmiddle class children (Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Horobin, 1997; Johnson & Solomon, 1997), \nMenominee Indian (Medin & Atran, in press), Yukatek Maya (Atran et al., 2001), and Brazilian \nchildren (Sousa, Atran & Medin 2002) understand that species kind is fixed at birth, even if an \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n9\n  \nanimal grows up with, is cared for, fed by, and is otherwise part of a \u201cfamily\u201d of animals of a \ndifferent species (see also Gelman & Wellman, 1991, for a parallel finding regarding seeds). In \nthese animal \u201cadoption\u201d studies, children predict that the adopted animal will have the same \nfamiliar kind typical properties (e.g., will oink or will moo; will have a curly tail or a straight tail) as \nwell as unfamiliar somatic properties (e.g., has a pink heart or a red heart) of its birth parents. \nThese developmental findings, together with those that suggest cross-cultural universality in \nthe adult taxonomic system, have been taken to support the hypothesis that there are strong \nconstraints \u2013 indeed, Medin and Atran argue for innate conceptual content in this domain \u2013 on how \npeople organize their knowledge of biological kinds. Because these constraints are determined by \npan-human mental capacities, it is predicted that they will produce convergent conceptual content \neven in the face of widely different inputs.  \n A similar hypothesis has been advanced by Hirschfeld regarding a different, but conceptually \nrelated, domain of knowledge. Hirschfeld argues for the existence of what he dubs the Human Kind \nCompetence (Hirschfeld, 1996): a universal predisposition to reason about the social world in terms \nof distinct types or kinds of people. That is, Hirschfeld hypothesizes a universal ontological \ncommitment to the existence of different kinds of people that is part of human nature. Further, he \nclaims that humans are predisposed to reason about social kind identity with the implicit assumption \nthat category members, despite superficial differences, share a fundamental and enduring essence, \nwhich causes them to develop and to retain the features that are characteristic of their kind. \nConsequently, despite accidental changes due to the process of maturation, ageing, or death, the \nessential kind identity remains constant throughout one\u2019s life-span and beyond. \n Hirschfeld (e.g., 1996, 1997, 1998) has been keen to emphasize that, although the Human Kind \nCompetence (HKC) is a property of the mind that guides and constrains one\u2019s interpretation of the \nworld, the specific ways in which the HKC gets deployed in different historical and cultural contexts is \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n10\n  \ndetermined by the structure of that world (i.e., its socio-political organization and  its system of \ninequalities and discriminations). Thus, \u201cchildren spontaneously explore the social world around them \nin search of intrinsic human kinds or groups of individuals that are thought to bear some deep and \nenduring commonality. Different cultures inscribe the social environment with different human kinds\u201d \n(Hirschfeld, 1997, p. 86). In one context, children will find racial kinds (human kinds predicated on \ncommon somatic features), in another they will find castes (human kinds predicated on common \noccupational destinies), in yet another they will find genders (human kinds predicated on sexual \ndifferences). Critically, in all cases the HKC will ensure that somatic, occupational, sexual features, or \nwhatever, are deployed so as to carve the social world into kinds that are intrinsic (such that what \nmakes people of a kind is lodged deep inside them), essentialized (such that such kinds have rich \ninductive potential) and naturalized (such that kind membership is biologically determined by \ninheritance from birth parents). \n Gil-White (2001) has advanced a different, but related proposal. He argues that, because of the \ncosts involved in interacting and marrying with people whose norms and behaviors were different from \ntheir own (see Rothbart & Taylor, 2001 for a criticism of this crucial assumption), our ancestors would \nhave developed and enforced a system of normative endogamy (i.e., parents would have prevented \ntheir children from marrying outside their norm group). Endogamy is the key to Gil-White\u2019s argument: \nthe fact that people married within the group meant that the properties acquired as a result of being \nreared in the midst of that group could be construed as if they were the result of having been born to \nparents of that group. When these groups, in addition, began \u201clabelling and conspicuously marking \nthemselves with cultural \u2018phenotypes\u2019 to improve the accuracy of the interactional discriminations\u201d \n(Gil-White, 2001, p. 532), the illusion that the difference between them was rooted in their different \nbirth origins was complete. Thus, endogamous groups of people came to have all the diagnostic \nfeatures of biological species and therefore came to prime the same module used to organize \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n11\n  \nknowledge and make inferences about all other living kinds. As a result of this evolutionary history, \nethnic groups are still represented by the human mind as animal species: as natural groups, whose \nmembers are what they are because of their innate potential. \n This evolutionary story on how ethnic groups came to look like species motivates Gil-White\u2019s \nprediction: that the human brain will treat endogamous human groups (and those alone) in the same \nway in which it treats animal species. In this, Gil-White\u2019s proposal differs from the suggestion made by \nAtran (1990, 2001) that human kinds are naturalized by analogy to animal species. On Atran\u2019s view, \nhuman groups come to be apprehended like animal species because of stable somatic differences \nassociated with them, not because of stable clusters of norms. \n Gil-White\u2019s proposal is far more specific than Hirschfeld\u2019s. Whereas Hirschfeld\u2019s HKC \nhypothesis does not specify which human kinds the human mind will apprehend in any one historical \ncontext, Gil-White\u2019s claim is that the human mind will naturalize and essentialize only those human \ngroups that exhibit the strongly diagnostic features of biological species (i.e., endogamy and descent-\nbased membership). There is another significant difference between these two positions: Gil-White \nargues that ethnic groups are naturalized and essentialized because the mind mistakes them for \nbiological species, whereas Hirschfeld argues for the domain-specificity of the HKC and for the \nautonomy of folksociology from folkbiology (Hirschfeld, 1996; see also Gelman, 2003; Gelman & \nHirschfeld, 1999).  \n  Gil-White and Hirschfeld converge in claiming that the human mind is so designed as to \nexhibit a universal tendency to naturalize and essentialize some human kinds: to assume that \n\u201cpeople-like-us\u201d and \u201cpeople-like-them\u201d are different because each group shares a distinctive \nessence, which was inherited at birth, remains impervious to environmental influences, guides the \nunfolding of kind-typical properties, and realizes the innate potential of each group. Thus, the same \nnexus of concepts \u2013 biological inheritance, innate potential, birth parentage \u2013 that are claimed to be \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n12\n  \npart of the folkbiology module is also crucially implicated in this other system of knowledge. This \nconvergence is best demonstrated by the fact that Hirschfeld and Gil-White, just like Medin, Atran \nand colleagues, have used the same adoption paradigm to test their hypotheses: all of them have \nasked participants to judge the properties and kind identity of people or animals born to one kind of \nparents and raised by another. It is because the very same concepts are at the core of each of these \nhypothesized systems of innately constrained knowledge that we address them together in a single \nmonograph. \n The claims for innately constrained knowledge in the domains of folkbiology and \nfolksociology have not gone unchallenged. In their own distinctive ways, both psychologists and \nanthropologists have raised (or could raise) objections to the proposals we have just reviewed. \nPsychologists\u2019 objections have focused on the critical issue of whether the concepts that are claimed \nto have innate content emerge early in development \u2013 evidence that they are indeed \nunderdetermined by experience \u2013 or whether they are a later acquisition, the result of a protracted \nconstructive process \u2013 evidence that they go beyond innately specified content. The objections that \ncould be raised by anthropologists are instead grounded in their ethnographic experience, which \ndirectly challenges the claim that people universally construe certain phenomena as \u2018biological\u2019, or \nthat they universally construe human kinds as natural kinds. In the two sections that follow, we \nreport these dissenting voices. \nThe challenge from psychology\n In a series of writings going back to the 1980\u2019s, Carey has argued that there is no evidence for \ninnate representations with biological content (Carey, 1985, 1995, 1999), for although infants \nclearly have a concept animal (Mandler, 2000; Waxman, 1999), they conceptualise animals as kinds \nof intentional agents rather than as kinds of living beings. Carey has thus proposed that North \nAmerican children construct the biological concept living thing only at the end of the preschool \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n13\n  \nyears, and that this construction requires conceptual change (see also Inagaki & Hatano, 2002, for \nevidence that a vitalist biology is constructed only at the end of the preschool years). Data in \nsupport of this position derive from Piagetian clinical interviews concerning children\u2019s \nunderstanding of death, life, human bodily function, reproduction, and illness (Bernstein & Cowan, \n1975; Bibace & Walsh, 1980; Crider, 1981; Koocher, 1973; Laurendeau & Pinard, 1962; Nagy, \n1953; Perrin, Sayer, & Willett, 1991; Safier, 1964; Speece & Brent, 1985), from more focused and \nchild-friendly studies designed to tap concepts in these domains (e.g., Au & Romo, 1996; \nHergenrather & Rabinowitz, 1991; Inagaki & Hatano, 1993; Keil, 1989, 1992; Solomon & \nCassimitis, 1999; Springer, 1996; Springer & Ruckel, 1992), from patterns of within-child \nconsistency across different measures of relevant conceptual content (e.g., Jaakkola, 1997; Johnson \n& Carey, 1998; Slaughter, Jaakkola, & Carey, 1999; Solomon & Johnson, 2000) and from teaching \nstudies (Au, Romo, & DeWitt, 1999; Slaughter and Lyons, 2003; Solomon & Johnson, 2000). \nMost pertinent to the discussion at hand are a series of studies that suggest that the case that \nvery young North American and European children have a biological understanding of family \nresemblance, and that they represent concepts such as biological inheritance, innate potential, or \nbirth parentage, has been greatly overstated. Piagetian clinical interviews have shown that North \nAmerican children do not come to understand human reproduction until late in the elementary \nschool years (e.g., Bernstein & Cowan, 1975). Although it has been argued that these interviews \nunderestimate preschool children\u2019s understanding (Atran, 1998; Hirschfeld, 1996; Solomon, \nJohnson, Zaitchik, & Carey, 1996; Springer & Keil, 1989; Wellman & Gelman, 1998), it is not clear \nthat young children perform any better in switched-at-birth and adoption studies, which ask children \nto reason about the resemblance between offspring and their birth or adoptive parents and which do \nnot require them to explicitly articulate their understanding of innate potential and of the role of \nbirth parentage in the inheritance of properties (e.g., Arterberry, Barrett, & Hudspeth, 1999; Carey, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n14\n  \n1995; Gimenez & Harris, 2002; Solomon, 2002; Solomon et al., 1996; Weissman & Kalish, 1999; \nWilliams & Affleck, 1999). Indeed, the interpretation of these studies is under active debate. \nOn the one hand, as reviewed above, species adoption studies, in which a baby is born to \none animal and raised by another of a different kind, reveal that in a wide variety of cultural \ncontexts even preschool children expect that the baby will grow up to be the same species as its \nbirth parent (Atran et al., 2001; Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Horobin, 1997; Johnson & Solomon, \n1997; Sousa et al., 2002). This expectation appears to be universal and provides evidence for \nconstrained conceptual development. On the other hand, there is evidence that young children do \nnot yet construe the cause of the family resemblance in terms of biological inheritance. For \nexample, Keil\u2019s (1989) transformation and discovery studies found that, even in the case of species \nfixation, middle-class North American children did not possess a robust understanding of the causal \nrole of birth parentage until age 7 to 9: Told that a raccoon gave birth to a certain animal and that \nthis animal subsequently gave birth to more raccoons did not lead children to judge that the animal \nwas a raccoon if it looked and acted like a skunk. This finding was replicated among rural and urban \nYoruba children by Jeyifous (1992). \nThe possibility that children who know that like begets like may not understand why this \nmust be so, raises the crucial issue of what kind of evidence can justify attributing to them an \nunderstanding of biological inheritance, a concept of innate potential and of birth parentage (see \nSousa, et al., 2002, for a detailed discussion of this point). We submit that it is possible for a child to \nreliably predict that babies are of the same species as their birth parents and that they have the \nproperties characteristic of their species, without having an understanding of biological inheritance \nand innate potential. If a child essentializes species kind, s\/he will assume that a tiger is a tiger \nduring its whole existence, irrespective of outward transformations (e.g. shedding all its fur) or \nchanged circumstances (e.g., growing up on a space station). It follows that all is needed to judge \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n15\n  \nthat a baby born of a mother tiger is a tiger, even if it is raised by lions, is to realize that the baby \nalready existed \u2013 and that therefore was already a tiger \u2013 before emerging from inside its first \nmother. Having established its kind, the child can derive all of the baby-tiger\u2019s properties: that it \nwill have stripes and that it will be fierce because it is a tiger. By contrast, an understanding of \nbiological inheritance requires an appreciation of the much deeper relation that exists between birth \nparents and their offspring \u2013 that birth parents pass on to their offspring a sort of \u201cblueprint\u201d which \ndetermines in the offspring the emergence of the same properties that are evident in the parents, \ncausing them to be of the same species. From this vantage point, the reason a baby tiger has stripes \nand will be fierce is that its mother has stripes and is fierce. In other words, the baby inherits from \nits mother the potential of becoming a tiger.  \nWhich measure could establish whether children have this deeper understanding of \nbiological inheritance? Consider that not all the properties of an individual are readily construed as \nkind-dependent: for example, the five fingers of the human hand are, but blond or dark hair is not. \nMoreover, many kinds of properties that are shared between parents and their offspring are not \ninherited: shared likes and dislikes for items of food, poetry and leisure activities are not the result \nof an inherited blueprint, but are the result of eating, reading and living together. Therefore, an \nadopted child will have blond hair like her birth parents, but she will resemble her adoptive parents \nin their likes and dislikes. Being able to differentiate between these two outcomes does seem to \nrequire a firm understanding of biological inheritance. \nMany studies have demonstrated that this differentiation is not robust until age 6 or 7 in \nNorth American and European children. For example, in Solomon et al.\u2019s (1996) adoption study, \nchildren were told about a child born to one parent and raised by another, and were then asked \nwhich of the two parents the grown-up child would resemble on traits such as having curly hair or \nbelieving that skunks can see in the dark. It was only at age 7 that children reliably predicted \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n16\n  \nsimilarity of bodily traits on the basis of biological inheritance, and similarity of beliefs on the basis \nof the child\u2019s learning environment (see Springer, 1996; Weissman & Kalish, 1999 for replications). \nUsing a slightly different procedure, Springer and Keil (1989) also provided evidence that preschool \nchildren do not understand the role of biological inheritance in trait acquisition. They told children \nabout a baby whose parents had an unusual trait (e.g., a pink rather than a red heart), and they asked \nwhether the baby would also have this unusual trait. In one of the test items, the parents were said to \nhave been born with the unusual trait, whereas in another they were said to have acquired the trait \nby accident. It was not until age 7 that children were swayed by whether the parents were born with \nthe trait or not. Furthermore, Solomon and Johnson (2000) found within-child consistency in a \nsample of 6- and 7-year-olds on Springer and Keil\u2019s measure and on Solomon et al.\u2019s (1996) \nmeasure of the understanding biological inheritance, providing evidence that both tapped the same \nunderstanding. It is very likely that this is also what supports 7-year-olds\u2019 first success on Keil\u2019s \ndiscovery and transformation studies mentioned above. \nThese developmental findings indicate that, at least in North America and Europe, the nexus \nof biological concepts biological inheritance, birth parentage, innate potential, emerges relatively \nlate in the course of childhood. This suggests that rather than the output of a module of the human \nmind, these concepts are the result of a protracted process of cultural construction. Notwithstanding \nthe significance of the developmental evidence reviewed so far, the claim that the acquisition of \nthese concepts is innately constrained is undercut even more forcefully by developmental data from \ntwo cross-cultural studies. Using a version of Solomon et al.\u2019s (1996) adoption task in a village in \nthe interior of Madagascar, Bloch, Solomon, and Carey (2001) found that it was not until adulthood \nthat a sample of Zafimaniry participants differentiated biological inheritance from learning \nmechanisms. And Mahalingham (1998), studying middle class Tamil children in India, found that it \nwas not until age 12 that they had made this differentiation. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n17\n  \nIn sum, the current state of the evidence for a cross-culturally universal early emergence of \nan understanding of biological inheritance is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, there is evidence \nthat in a variety of cultural contexts very young children understand that babies are of the same \nspecies as their birth mother, and this leaves open the possibility that they also assume that human \nbabies are of the same human kind as their birth parents. On the other hand, very young children\u2019s \nunderstanding of the fixation of species kind may not depend on biological concepts of inheritance \nand innate potential as claimed.  When such concepts have been probed more stringently, as in \nSolomon et al.\u2019s (1996) adoption study, North American and European children have failed to \ndemonstrate a biological understanding of family resemblance until the age of 6 or 7, with the age \nincreasing well into adulthood in a small sample of Zafimaniry participants. \n The studies presented in this monograph will add to these debates, by probing the \nunderstanding of the mechanisms through which an individual\u2019s properties are acquired (biological \ninheritance vs. learning\/nurture) and the relations between this understanding and the participants\u2019 \nconstrual of human and animal kinds. The participants in question are children who live in a coastal \nvillage of Madagascar, who are virtually unschooled (see below), and who grow up in the kind of \ncultural environment that has led anthropologists to argue that many, if not all, non-western peoples \ndo not \u201cdiscriminate and categorize parts of the flux of human experience as \u2018biological\u2019\u201d, as \nstipulated by Medin and Atran (in press), and that there are people who do not naturalize human \nkinds, as stipulated by Hirschfeld and Gil-White. It is to these arguments that we now turn. \nThe challenge from anthropology \nMost anthropologists are likely to dismiss as nonsensical the claim that the acquisition and \nconstruction of concepts such as biological inheritance, innate potential, and birth parentage are \ninnately constrained. This is because the theoretical advances made in the field of kinship studies in \nthe past 30 years \u2013 most notably the realization that the representations of phenomena such as birth, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n18\n  \nfiliation, and descent vary cross-culturally  \u2013 appear to wholly contradict the claim that the \nconstruction of such representations is subject to any constraint. To appreciate the force of this \nargument, we need to briefly sketch the radical theoretical shifts that have characterized the \nanthropological study of kinship (see Bloch & Sperber, 2002; Sousa, 2003 for reviews). \nThe study of kinship organization has been central to anthropology from its earliest days. \nStarting with L. H. Morgan, who is credited with the discovery that human kinship is not natural but \nis pre-eminently cultural (Good, 1994; Trautmann, 1987), anthropologists realized that kinship \nrelations were of crucial importance in organizing so-called primitive societies. This is what made \nthe comparative study of kinship systems a worthwhile enterprise. \nBut comparison requires commensurability. The common denominator, which guaranteed \nthe comparison across different kinship systems, was provided by what came to be known as \u201cThe \nDoctrine of the Genealogical Unity of Mankind\u201d: the confident assumption \u201cthat genealogical \nrelations are the same in every culture\u201d (Schneider, 1984, p.174). Armed with the most powerful \nmethodological tool devised for the study of kinship \u2013 W. H. R. Rivers\u2019s \u201cgenealogical method of \nanthropological enquiry\u201d (Rivers, 1968) \u2013 anthropologists went around the world collecting their \ninformants\u2019 pedigrees. This was followed by the comparative study of how natural pedigrees were \nculturally interpreted and manipulated to produce different terminological systems, different \nmarriage patterns, different inheritance systems, and so on. Crucially, this method, and the \n\u201cdoctrine\u201d built upon it, were predicated on the assumption that it was possible to identify the same \nbasic genealogical units of father, mother, husband, wife, son and daughter in every culture. \nIt was this assumption that was questioned in the 50s and 60s. Leach (1961) and Needham \n(1971b) echoed each other in arguing that anthropologists should abandon the futile attempt to find \nuniversal definitions for social phenomena such as marriage, filiation, incest and, more generally, \nkinship itself. Thus, while Leach (1961, p. 27) proposed that if one approaches the ethnographic \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n19\n  \nrecord without \u201cprior assumptions\u201d, one is forced to realize that \u201cEnglish language patterns of \nthought [e.g. the categorical distinction between consanguinity and affinity] are not a necessary \nmodel for the whole of human society\u201d, Needham (1971b, p. 5) concluded that \u201cthere is no such \nthing as kinship, and [therefore] there can be no such thing as kinship theory\u201d. This debate was \nconsciously framed in philosophical terms \u2013 kinship has no external reality; \u201ckinship\u201d is no more \nthan a useful \u201codd-job word\u201d \u2013 and anthropologists were asked to \u201cschool [themselves], by \nreflection and introspection, to a stance of systematic self-doubt\u201d, such that it could sustain \u201cthe \nquiet and patient undermining of categories over the whole field of anthropological thought\u201d \n(Needham, 1971a, p. xviii). \nBut those who battled over the future of kinship theory also questioned the more specific \nand central claim made by its practitioners. Most notably, the critique of the study of kinship \nadvanced by Schneider (1984) challenged the assumption that the reported diversity in kinship \nsystems was due to cultural variations in the interpretation of the same natural facts \u2013 or, to use a \nmetaphor which Schneider extensively criticized, the assumption that the anthropological study of \nkinship consisted in recording and comparing \u201cthe different ways of cutting the pie of experience\u201d \n(Schneider 1965, p. 93). Noting that reality (the pie) cannot exist except by being invested with \nmeaning, Schneider concluded that \u201cthe notion of a pure, pristine state of biological relationships \n\u2018out there in reality\u2019 which is the same for all mankind is sheer nonsense\u201d (1965, p. 97). He \nillustrated this point ethnographically, by arguing that for the Yap people of Micronesia, the relation \nbetween fathers and sons is not a biological relation invested with social meaning. Rather, the \nreferent for this relation, as construed by the Yapese, is a link of dependence established through \none\u2019s association with the land and through work, irrespective of filiation. The same applies to the \nrelation between mothers and offspring, as demonstrated by the fact that this relation is not deemed \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n20\n  \npermanent, as it would be if its referent were the relationship engendered by biological reproduction \n(i.e., if the mother divorces her husband, she ceases to be mother to her children).  \nMany details of Schneider\u2019s Yapese ethnographic material and interpretation have been \nquestioned and severely criticized (e.g., Lingenfelter, 1985; Kuper, 1999; Scheffler, 1991). \nSchneider\u2019s theoretical influence on the anthropological study of kinship, however, has been \nenormous. Following in Schneider\u2019s footsteps, many anthropologists have argued that the people \nthey study do not define human relatedness by reference to birth and filiation (e.g., Nuttall, 2000; \nMarshall, 1977; Witherspoon, 1975) and that, crucially, they do not recognize the ontological \ndistinction between relationships engendered by biological reproduction and relationships \nengendered by social interactions such as sharing food and locality (e.g., Carsten, 2000, pp. 25-27; \nIngold, 1991, p. 362 for a particularly clear formulation of this point). For example, Carsten (1995, \n1997) has argued that the distinction between \u201cfacts of biology\u201d and \u201cfacts of sociality\u201d is \nmeaningless for the Malay people she studied on the island of Langkawi. In her detailed \nethnographic analysis she argues that Malay people attribute greater significance to post-natal \ninfluences than to procreative ones. While they recognize the role of semen and blood in the making \nof children, they emphasize that food also makes a person\u2019s blood. This means that sharing food is, \njust like sharing blood, a vehicle for the creation of relatedness \u2013 to the extent that fostered children \nwho eat the food cooked on their adoptive parents\u2019 hearth are said to take on character traits and \nphysical attributes of those who raise them (Carsten, 1991, p. 431; 1995, p. 229). Carsten thus \nconcludes: \nIdeas about relatedness in Langkawi show how culturally specific is the separation of \nthe \u201csocial\u201d from the \u201cbiological\u201d and the reduction of the latter to sexual reproduction. \nIn Langkawi relatedness is derived both from acts of procreation and from living and \neating together. It makes little sense in indigenous terms to label some of these activities \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n21\n  \nas social and others as biological. I certainly never heard Langkawi people do so. It is \nclear that the important relationships of kinship involve what we would regard as both. \nIf blood, which is the stuff of kinship and to some extent of personhood, is acquired \nduring gestation in the uterus and, after birth, in the house through feeding with others as \npeople in Langkawi assert, is it, then, biological or social? The impossibility of \nanswering this question merely underlines the unsatisfactory nature of this distinction \n(1995, pp. 236-37; 1997, pp. 291). \n Carsten\u2019s conclusion is a particularly fine example of a well-established constructivist \nposition in anthropology, which cuts across the studies of kinship, gender (e.g., Yanagisako & \nCollier, 1987), personhood (e.g., Marriot, 1976; Strathern, 1988), emotion (e.g., Lutz, 1988), \nself (e.g., Scheper-Hughes & Lock, 1987), and much more (but see e.g., Astuti, 1998; Bloch, \n1977; Bloch & Sperber, 2002; Lambek, 1998; Middleton, 2000; Ortner, 1996; Spiro, 1993, for \ndissenting positions). Its implications for the proposal that the representation of biological \nprocesses is innately constrained are clear: if populations outside the western world do not \ndistinguish between biological and social processes, the claim that the human mind is designed \nto discriminate and categorize parts of the flux of human experience as \u201cbiological\u201d (Medin & \nAtran, in press) becomes untenable. It follows that concepts such as biological inheritance, birth \nparentage, innate potential are not innately constrained. Rather, conceptual content is culturally \nconstructed, and is thus likely to exhibit cross-cultural variability and incommensurability as \namply demonstrated by ethnographic reports. \nThe anthropological challenge extends to the hypothesized universal propensity to naturalize \nhuman kinds. In the same way in which human relatedness need not be rooted in the biological \nrelations engendered by sexual reproduction, human group identities need not be ascribed and fixed \nat birth. Rather, group identities can be molded and gradually acquired by inhabiting a particular \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n22\n  \nenvironment, by practicing certain activities, or by adopting distinctive ways of doing and being \n(e.g., Linnekin & Poyer, 1990 for a review of this performative view of social identities). As we \nshall see, this is precisely how Astuti (1995a, 1995b) has described the way in which the people \nstudied in this monograph define and experience their group identity.  \nCompeting hypotheses and their predictions  \nOur study of conceptual development in Madagascar will engage with the diverging and \napparently irreconcilable positions we have just reviewed. For the sake of clarity, we shall now \nname the different hypotheses we will be testing.  \nWe shall use the label \u201cUnconstrained Learning\u201d hypothesis to refer to the position adhered to \nby most mainstream anthropologists that concepts can vary widely across different cultural \nenvironments, because their construction and acquisition are in no way constrained by the \nphylogenetic properties of the human mind (see Sperber & Hirschfeld, 1999 for a review). On this \nview, the outcome of conceptual development is open-ended. Because language, artifacts and \nsociocultural practices are the input into the process of knowledge acquisition in childhood, \ndifferent courses of conceptual development are predicted, leading to radical incommensurability in \nthe adult end-states across cultures. \nWe will contrast this position with the \u201cInnate Conceptual Content\u201d hypothesis which posits \ninstead that rich conceptual knowledge potentiates and constrains conceptual development. On this \nview, innate constraints on conceptual development are expected to lead to cross-cultural \nuniversality in adult conceptual representations. \nThe case study we present in this monograph will give support to the Innate Conceptual \nContent hypothesis if, as posited by Medin and Atran, Hirschfeld and Gil-White, we find that \nconcepts of biological inheritance, innate potential, birth parentage, natural human kinds are in \nevidence among rural Malagasy adults as they are among their urban North American counterparts. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n23\n  \nThe Unconstrained Learning hypothesis will instead receive support if we find that Malagasy adults \nhave constructed radically different concepts, as suggested by the ethnographic reports reviewed \nbelow. Note, however, that neither outcome by itself is enough to validate one or the other \nhypothesis. In the case of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis, cross-cultural universality in \nthe adult end-state could also result from unconstrained learning, if the outside world provides \nmassive data in favor of certain conceptual representations. What is needed therefore, in addition to \ncross-cultural convergence in the adult conceptual repertoire, is evidence that the relevant concepts \nemerge early in development irrespective of widely different input conditions. In the case of the \nUnconstrained Learning hypothesis, cross-cultural divergence in the adult end-state could result \nfrom the culturally orchestrated overturn of innately supported conceptual representations that \nemerged spontaneously early in development despite contradictory input from the adult world. \nWhat is needed therefore, in addition to cross-cultural divergence in the adult conceptual repertoire, \nis evidence that the relevant concepts have been constructed steadily and incrementally as the \nunmediated result of the input that children derive from adult culture. In short, both hypotheses need \nthe validation of supporting developmental evidence. \n Finally, we shall consider a third hypothesis, which we label the \u201cConstrained Conceptual \nConstruction\u201d hypothesis. This is a weaker version of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis in \nthat it proposes that each child must construct anew the concepts in question (hence \n\u201cconstructivist\u201d). Nonetheless, this construction is not open-ended as claimed by the Unconstrained \nLearning hypothesis, but is enabled and constrained by powerful innate domain-general learning \nmechanisms, such as causal analysis (Gopnik et al., in press) or teleological (Keleman, 1999) and \nessentialist modes of construal (Gelman, 2003). The Constrained Conceptual Construction \nhypothesis does not make strong predictions regarding cross-cultural universality, since the \noutcome of development depends on the interaction between the input the child receives from the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n24\n  \ncultural environment and the hypothesized learning mechanisms that the child brings to the task of \ninterpreting that input. Whenever cross-cultural universality is observed, however, the Constrained \nConceptual Construction hypothesis makes different predictions from the Innate Conceptual \nContent hypothesis. Whereas the latter predicts the spontaneous emergence of innately supported \nconcepts, the former expects to find traces of the constructive process, for example some evidence \nof within child consistency in the understanding of theoretically related concepts. \nConcept diagnosis: the fundamental problem  \nThe empirical questions we shall be pursuing in this monograph \u2013 do Malagasy adults have \nconcepts that are commensurable with those of North Americans, and do Malagasy children have \nthe same concepts as their parents \u2013 raise a serious analytical challenge: How do we know whether \ntwo individuals have the same concepts of x or y?   This challenge faces all scholars \u2013 \nanthropologists, developmental psychologists, and historians of science alike \u2013 engaged in \ntheoretical debates about incommensurable conceptual systems, for they cannot begin to address the \nquestion of whether Malagasy adults have a concept of biological inheritance that is the same as \nthat of American college students, whether the child\u2019s concept of living thing is the same as the \nadult\u2019s, or whether Priestley\u2019s concept of element is the same as Lavoisier\u2019s without specifying \nwhat these questions mean and what is to count as evidence that bears on answering them (see \nCarey, 1988; Kitcher, 1988; Kuhn, 1983; Nersessian, 1992; Thagard, 1992 for extended discussions \nof this issue.) \n We take concepts to be structured mental representations. The content of a concept is \ndetermined by its extension (the entities, properties, processes it refers to) and by its inferential role. \nTo ask, then, whether a concept is shared across social groups, or across historical or developmental \ntime, is to ask whether there is sufficient overlap of content determining inferential role and \nreference fixation. To address this question in the present context, we need to probe Malagasy \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n25\n  \nconcepts of biological inheritance, of learning and practice, of birth and reproduction, of adoptive \nand biological parentage, of bodily and mental traits, of species, and of human kinds. To do so, we \nasked our informants to reason about an adoption scenario similar to that used by Solomon et al. \n(1996) in North America, by Bloch et al. (2001) in Madagascar, by Mahalingham (1998) in Tamil \nNadu. Participants were told about a baby born to one set of parents, who subsequently died. The \nbaby was safely discovered and raised by another set of parents. Birth and adoptive parents were \nthen attributed contrastive individual properties, and participants were asked to predict which parent \nthe child would resemble with respect to these. Crucially, the properties were of different kinds: \nbodily traits, such as shape of the nose or ears; beliefs about the world, such as how many teeth a \nchameleon has; and skills such as carpentry or making ropes. The adoption task was designed to \nprobe whether participants hold conceptual representations of two different mechanisms for the \ntransmission of properties: One mediated by biological inheritance from birth parents and one \nmediated by socially-mediated learning. That a given participant represented these two different \nmechanisms could be revealed both in the pattern of judgments and in the explicit justifications \ngiven for these judgments. These data \u2013 judgment patterns and justifications \u2013 provide evidence of \nthe underlying representations and their conceptual role. \n It is important to correctly interpret these data and avoid the trap of over-interpreting them. \nIf a Malagasy and a North American participants systematically judge that the adopted child will \nhave the bodily properties of the birth parent, but the beliefs and skills of the adoptive parent, then \nsurely both of these participants have differentiated between two causal mechanisms (one having to \ndo with generating children, the other one having to do with nurturing them) for the transmission of \ntwo distinct kinds of properties (bodily and mental\/experiential traits). One can thus infer that both \nMalagasy and North American participants make the same ontological cut. However, one must then \nask whether the concepts of biological inheritance and socially-mediated learning of a Malagasy \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n26\n  \nadult are identical to those of a North American adult, in the same way in which one must ask \nwhether the concept of biological inheritance of an embryologist or geneticist is identical to that of \nan North American undergraduate or of a Tamil adolescent. Most likely, the answer to these \nquestions will be negative. Nonetheless, the content of the concepts that underlie the ontological \ndistinctions made by our Malagasy and North American participants is the same in that it picks out \nthe same processes and kinds in the world and shares a relevant content determining inferential role. \nAs we shall see, the comments provided by participants to justify their resemblance judgments in \nthe adoption task can throw some light on both differences and overlap in content (see Study 1).  \nBut the anthropological literature reviewed above claims that in at least some cultural \ncontexts there will be no cut at all: that people will draw no principled distinction between \nbiological and adoptive family, between biological inheritance and socially-mediated learning. As \nwe shall see shortly, the group of Malagasy people we are investigating in this monograph \u2013 the \nVezo of western Madagascar \u2013 could be construed as one such case. However, if we were to show \nthat Vezo participants predict that adopted children resemble birth parents in their bodily properties \nand adoptive parents in their beliefs and skills, we will be able to claim that their conceptual \nrepresentations, like those of North American undergraduates, of embryologists, of geneticists, of \nTamil adolescents, play the same inferential role of distinguishing between a biological and a social \nmechanism for the transmission and acquisition of an individual\u2019s properties. And this would be a \nsignificant finding. \n It could of course be argued that the adoption task imposes on the participants the \nontological categories of the researcher \u2013 the dualism of sociality and biology, of organism and \nperson, of mental and bodily properties of the person. But although the task is undoubtedly \nconstructed around these distinctions, it does not force them on the participants. The task is a \ndiagnostic task: If participants do not distinguish between social and biological parenthood, between \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n27\n  \nbirth and nurture, between bodily and mental traits, they will sail through the task blissfully \nunaware of the distinctions being probed. \nThe case study: the Vezo of Madagascar \nThe studies presented in this monograph have been conducted in a fishing village on the \nwestern coast of Madagascar, where Astuti has conducted extensive periods of anthropological \nfieldwork (1987-89, 1994, 1998). The village of Betania has a population of about 800 adults. It lies \na few miles south of Morondava, the main town in the area, which hosts governmental offices, a \nmarket, a hospital, a post office and an airport. The livelihood of the village depends on a variety of \nfishing activities, and on the trading of fish at the Morondava market. Typically, men go out fishing \ndaily with their dugout outrigger canoes and, daily, women sell the catch. With what they earn, \nwomen buy rice, the staple food, and other essential foodstuff (as well as luxury items such as foam \nmattresses and shiny synthetic dresses). The development of tourism in recent years has made \nMorondava a much busier place than it was in the 80s. This has created a new outlet for the fish \ncaught by Betania fishermen, as well as generating employment opportunities for some of the \nvillagers. Nonetheless, most villagers still regard fishing as their most profitable, if erratic, source of \nlivelihood (see Astuti, 1995a, for further detail). From an early age, children contribute to fishing, \ntrading, child rearing, and to a variety of domestic chores (e.g. fetching water, collecting firewood), \nalthough the extent of the contribution they are asked to make varies greatly depending on the \nstructure of their domestic unit. To an outsider, the most remarkable aspect of Vezo children\u2019s lives \nis the virtual absence of schooling. The village has a school building and two designated teachers. \nHowever, due to the deterioration of public administration in Madagascar, the building and the \nteachers are hardly ever occupied. Whenever children are in the building, and if the teacher has not \nrun out of chalk, the teaching largely consists in copying letters, numbers and short sentences from \nthe blackboard onto the child\u2019s own A5 size blackboard. Understandably, the many children who do \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n28\n  \nnot own a blackboard are allowed to play in the burning heat outside (see Bloch, 1998, and \nFreeman, 2001, for more detailed analyses of similar pedagogical practices in other areas of \nMadagascar). \nLike other people who live on the coast and who \u201cstruggle with the sea\u201d, the inhabitants of \nBetania call themselves Vezo. We have chosen them as the focus of our enquiry because they \nprovide an ideal context for testing the proposals (and counter-proposals) we have reviewed so far. \nThis is so for two reasons. First, ethnographic descriptions of how Vezo adults describe the process \nthrough which an individual\u2019s traits are acquired appear to flatly contradict the claim that the \nunderstanding of biological inheritance is innately constrained. Second, Vezo adults hold an \nelaborate and explicit theory about group identity which is at odds with the claim that the human \nmind is predisposed to naturalize human kinds. We shall briefly review the ethnographic data on \nVezo adults\u2019 conceptualisation of trait and group identity acquisition, thereby introducing the reader \nto the ethnographic backdrop of our studies. \nBabies\u2019 looks and biological inheritance \nMadagascar has been recognized by anthropologists as one of those places where traditional \nprocreational models of kinship do not work because people emphasize the importance of post-natal \nprocesses in determining kinship and personhood over the facts of procreation. Southall (1986, p. \n417) identifies the root of the problem in the fact that \u201cwhat seems to be distinctive about all \nMalagasy kinship systems is [\u2026] their emphasis on kinship and descent status as something \nachieved gradually and progressively throughout life, and even after death, rather than ascribed and \nfixed definitely at birth\u201d. Bloch (1993) has similarly contrasted birth-based kinship systems such as \nthose typically found on the African continent, to those found in Madagascar, in which birth is not \nthe mechanism that determines who people are and the extent of their kinship relations. Vezo views \nof relatedness fit nicely in this pan-Malagasy pattern (but see Middleton, 1999, for qualifications), \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n29\n  \nin so far as affiliation to the sort of unilineal descent groups described for sub-Saharan Africa is not \nfixed at birth but is realized only at the moment of burial (Astuti, 1995a, 2000a). \nConsistent with the cultural emphasis on the processes through which human relatedness \nevolves during a person\u2019s lifetime rather than on its instantaneous fixation at birth, we find across \nMadagascar a series of beliefs about the transmission of properties from parents to children, which \nsystematically downplay the role of birth and procreation. In the case of the Vezo, when adults \nexplain how babies turn out to look the way they do (e.g., big eyes, light skin color, bent nose, etc.), \nthey invoke mechanisms other than procreation, and the contribution of people other than the baby\u2019s \nbirth parents.  \nFor example, Vezo assert that if a pregnant woman takes a strong dislike to someone, \nwhether related to her or not, the baby will come to resemble the disliked person. By contrast, \nspending a lot of time with, or even just thinking a lot about someone during pregnancy, will cause \nthe child to look like the frequented person. More seriously: why was that baby born with a club-\nfoot? Because when his mother was a child she used to tease one of her friends who had a club-foot, \nthe result of a badly administered quinine injection. When she gave birth, she was shocked to see \nthat her baby had an identical defect to the one she used to make fun of. While still in uterus, if not \nbefore, the baby\u2019s appearances are thus shaped by the social relations in which it is already fully - if \nonly vicariously - immersed. Such immersion will intensify after birth, resulting in the further \nmolding of the baby\u2019s physiognomy. During the first few weeks after birth, mother and baby are \nliterally fused into one another as they lie together wrapped up in layers and layers of blankets; at \nthis time, it is the mother\u2019s responsibility to protect and guard the baby from the many wandering \nspirits which, if they find the baby alone, will take hold of it and change its physiognomy \u2013 erasing, \nin so doing, the traces left by previous human relationships. Such spirits have an easy job because of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n30\n  \nbabies\u2019 purported phenomenal plasticity, well captured by the pan-Malagasy term used to describe \nthem: they are \u201cwater babies\u201d - wobbly, bendable, boneless.  \nTaken together, this evidence suggests that the Vezo, just like the Malays studied by \nCarsten, blur a number of distinctions, including that between the baby as a biological organism and \nthe baby as a social person. It is indeed difficult to see where one begins and the other one ends, \ngiven that social causes \u2013 such as teasing or spending time together \u2013 are said to shape its organic \nmake up. By implication, the distinction between birth (as a biological process) and nurture (as a \nsocial process) is also blurred, in so far as biological parenthood is socialized (as evidenced by the \nmany people the baby will resemble) and nurturing relations are somatized (because of the effect \nthat nurture has on the baby\u2019s bodily make-up). \nThis ethnographic context provides us with an ideal setting for pitting the Innate Conceptual \nContent hypothesis and its claim that the conceptual representations of biological inheritance, birth \nparentage, innate potential are innately constrained against the Unconstrained Learning hypothesis \nand its claim that the Malays, the Yap, the Vezo and, some anthropologists would argue, most non-\nwestern peoples hold radically different representations of these phenomena, elaborated over an \nincommensurable, non-dualistic ontology. It is likely that most anthropologists will not see the \npoint for this empirical exercise, for they know that the people they study do not share the \nconceptual representations that are allegedly innately constrained. We do not doubt the accuracy of \nthe ethnographic descriptions produced by anthropologists (one of whom is an author of this \nmonograph). That is, we believe that informants do state that food makes blood or that babies do not \nresemble their birth parents. However, our investigation will explore whether the kind of evidence \ntraditionally used by anthropologists \u2013 reflective statements, codified beliefs, narratives that \nexpound conventional wisdom, etc. \u2013 is adequate for revealing the conceptual knowledge and the \nontological commitments of the people they study. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n31\n  \nThe investigation conducted by Bloch in a Zafimaniry village in Madagascar suggests that it \nis not. Zafimaniry adults, like their Vezo counterparts, routinely explain the bodily properties of \ntheir children by reference to social processes of companionship, friendship, spiritual intervention, \nand so on. Yet, as reported in Bloch et al. (2001) half of the seven adults who participated in a \nversion of Solomon et al.\u2019s (1996) adoption task provided patterns of judgments and justifications \nindistinguishable from those given by North American adults on the same task. That is, they judged \nthat the child would resemble the adoptive parents in their beliefs, preferences and skills, and the \nbirth parents on bodily traits. Although these are preliminary results, given the small size of the \nsample and the fact that almost half of the participants did not provide a differentiated pattern of \nresponses, they point to a striking discrepancy between the biological knowledge people use in their \ninferential reasoning and the culturally endorsed statements they produce about their babies\u2019 \nphysiognomy. \nIf we were to discover that, despite what they say, Vezo adults have embedded their \nunderstanding of the acquisition of an individual\u2019s properties within a biological framework, which \nspecifies the causal role of procreation, differentiated from the causal role of other mechanisms of \nsocial transmission such as learning and imitation, this discovery would give support to the \ncontention that such an understanding is cross-culturally universal. Would this outcome decide in \nfavor of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis? As mentioned above, cross-cultural universality \nper se is not sufficient evidence that a conceptual representation is innately constrained. For the \nInnate Conceptual Content hypothesis to be validated, evidence of the early emergence of the \nunderstanding of the mechanism of biological inheritance is also needed. And this is why, apart \nfrom delineating Vezo adults folkbiological knowledge, we also seek developmental evidence from \nVezo children and adolescents.  \nGroup identity: a state of being or a way of doing? \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n32\n  \n Astuti (1995a, 1995b) reports that her Vezo informants claim that \u201cthe Vezo are not a kind of \npeople\u201d. The term translated as kind can be applied to any entity: for example, sandals are a kind of \nshoes, mackerel are a kind of fish, rice is a kind of food, and so on. When used to refer to kinds of \npeople, the term becomes indistinguishable from the term that refers to the ancestors, the dead \npeople one was generated from. Therefore, the statement that the Vezo are not a kind of people \nmeans that, unlike mackerels, Vezo are not what they are because of their birth and ancestral \norigins. But if it is not ancestry, what is it? The answer which Vezo adults give to this question is \nthat what makes people Vezo is living on the coast and \u201cstruggling with the sea\u201d (i.e., fishing, \nsailing, paddling, swimming, etc.). This captures how Vezo adults classify themselves and other \npeople into different groups: by where they live and what they do. \nThis way of categorizing the social world, which we will refer to as the Vezo performative \ntheory of group identity, is typically articulated by Vezo adults in a variety of informal contexts that \nportray the contrast between themselves and their immediate neighbors, the Masikoro. Adults \nconstantly and consistently invoke the principle that being Vezo is to live on the coast and do Vezo \nthings such as fishing, sailing and eating fish, whereas being Masikoro is to live inland, and do \nMasikoro things, such as cultivating, raising cattle and \u2013 so Vezo say \u2013 eating grass. Of course, this \ndefinition of what it means to be Vezo or Masikoro not only implies that one does not need to be \nborn Vezo or Masikoro to be one, but also that people who are Vezo can become Masikoro, and \nvice versa (which they do) by way of learning and adopting Vezo or Masikoro ways of doing. \nImportantly, Vezo adults also say that being born of Vezo parents does not, by itself, make a person \nVezo. Consequently, children are said not to be Vezo, as they are not yet competent at \u201cstruggling \nwith the sea\u201d (see Astuti, 1995a, p. 16).  \nVezo and Masikoro group identities, then, do not appear to be construed around the \nessentialist presumption that to be of a kind is to share an essence, which ensures the maintenance \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n33\n  \nof one\u2019s identity through time and space, and which engenders innate predispositions. In other \nwords, Vezo and Masikoro are not kinds of people, at least not in the sense implied by Hirschfeld\u2019s \nHuman Kind Competence (HKC). It is important to point out, however, that Vezo and Masikoro are \nnonetheless extremely rich inferential categories. To know that someone is Vezo or Masikoro is to \nknow an almost infinite number of his or her properties, ranging from the most obvious ones (e.g., \noccupation, preferred foodstuff) to others such as the way people wear their sarong, the way they \nspeak (fast and loud or slow and softly), the way they scold their children, the way their children \nrespond to the scolding, they way they walk, the way they save or squander money, the way they \norganize funerals and marriages, the way women braid their hair, etc. The fact that Vezo and \nMasikoro are such inferentially rich categories means that they pick out the sort of human groupings \nthat could be targeted by the HKC, and it is therefore of some consequence that they do not seem to \nbe. \nNonetheless, we accept that the discontinuity between Vezo and Masikoro may be a poor \ncandidate for testing the alleged universality of the HKC. One might argue that the reason the \ndifference between Vezo and Masikoro is construed performatively, in terms of their different ways \nof doing, is simply that both groups of people are assumed to be part of the same, essentialized, and \nancestrally defined super-ordinate group (this was the prevalent interpretation in the ethnographic \nliterature reviewed in Astuti, 1995a). Moreover, we recognize that the finding that Vezo and \nMasikoro group identities are not naturalized is tangential to Gil-White\u2019s claim that endogamous \ngroups trigger the construal of ethnic groups as animal species, since Vezo and Masikoro \nintermarry.  \nWhat we need, then, is a stronger test for the ethnographically based claim that Vezo have a \nperformative theory of group identity. Crucially, we need to establish whether Vezo informants \nwould extend their way of reasoning about the Masikoro to a group of people of unquestionably \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n34\n  \nseparate ancestral origins, and with whom they do not intermarry. The group of people we have \nchosen to explore this question are the Karany. The Karany are the descendants of Indo-Pakistani \nimmigrants. They are town-dwellers; they are wealthy and well educated; they are shopkeepers and \nmoneylenders. They are predominantly Muslim and, although fluent in Malagasy, they speak their \nown language among themselves. Unlike the Masikoro who, at birth, are indistinguishable from the \nVezo, the Karany are somatically different in that their skin is light and their hair straight. Vezo \nvillagers have regular interactions with the Karany: they buy goods from their shops (e.g., fishing \ntools, clothes, soap), they sell fish to them, and occasionally the entertain large Karany families who \ntake Sunday walks and have picnics on the village beach, by offering them fresh coconuts. \nHowever, Vezo and Karany do not intermarry.  \nOn the face of it, the Karany appear to be a perfect candidate for the deployment of the \nHKC, and for triggering the analogy to animal species. Thus, if Vezo informants were to extend to \nthe Karany their way of reasoning about the Masikoro \u2013 in other words, if they were shown to \nconstrue the Karany in terms of what they do rather than in terms of what they essentially are \u2013 this \nwould pose a significant challenge to both Hirschfeld\u2019s and Gil-White\u2019s claims and would thus \nquestion the validity of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis in this domain. If not, Astuti\u2019s \nclaim about the Vezo performative theory of group identity would have to be modified. \nWhatever the outcome of our investigation with Vezo adults, once again we shall also seek \ndevelopmental data. Even if Vezo adults were to reason in a manner that confirms Astuti\u2019s \nethnographic analysis and disproves Hirschfeld\u2019s and Gil-White\u2019s predictions, it is possible that \nchildren have different intuitions. If children were to naturalize and essentialize group differences \nthat adults construe in performative terms, thereby trumping the cultural input they receive, they \nwould provide evidence that the conceptual development in this domain is under some kind of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n35\n  \nendogenous constraint \u2013 either of the kind posited by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis or \nby the Constrained Conceptual Constructivist hypothesis. \nPlan of the monograph \n We shall start our investigation (Chapter 2) by exploring Vezo adults\u2019 understanding of the \nprocess of biological inheritance and their theory of group of identity, using the adoption scenario \nadapted from Solomon et al., 1996. Given that adult conceptual systems are the output of \ndevelopmental processes, whether the adult end-state is cross-culturally universal or not directly \nbears on the question of how constrained the developmental process is. Our data on adult \nrepresentations are thus essential to the task of evaluating competing developmental hypotheses. \n We then turn to studies of children (ages 6 to 13; Chapter 3), and adolescents (ages 14 to 20; \nChapter 4). At issue is whether the findings of Mahalingham (1998) and Bloch et al. (2001) \nconcerning the late emergence of the understanding of biological inheritance are replicated in this \ncontext. Also, these studies explore the development of children\u2019s reasoning about group identity, \nand their grasp of the adult\u2019s performative theory of group identity. Finally, in Chapter 5 we probe \nchildren\u2019s and adult\u2019s understanding of the determination of animal kind. In order to engage with \nthe hypothesis that human kinds are naturalized and essentialized by analogy to animal species, we \nneed to establish what Vezo know about the process by which ducks have baby ducks and chickens \nhave baby chickens. \nThe pattern of cross-cultural variation and similarity between North American and Vezo \nadults on these tasks, as well as the patterns of later and earlier emergence of the target concepts \nacross the two cultures, will set the stage for a discussion of the existence and of the nature of \nconstraints on knowledge acquisition in the domains of folkbiology and folksociology. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n36\n  \nChapter II \n \nSTUDY 1. ADULTS: FAMILY RESEMBLANCE AND GROUP IDENTITY \n \nStudy 1 tests the competing predictions of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis and of \nthe Unconstrained Learning hypothesis regarding the cross-cultural universality of adult \nrepresentations in the domain of folkbiology and folksociology. At issue is whether Vezo and North \nAmerican adults share commensurable concepts of biological inheritance and of human kinds, or \nwhether, as suggested by ethnographic reports, Vezo adults have created culturally specific \nrepresentations of the mechanisms that endow people with their properties, including their group \nidentity.  \nTo address these competing claims we explore whether Vezo adults differentiate between \nthe biological and social processes implicated in the transmission of an individual\u2019s properties by \nusing three different adoption scenarios. The preliminary data from a similar study by Bloch et al. \n(2001) among the Zafimaniry, suggest that, in spite of ethnographic reports to the contrary, Vezo \nadults\u2019 understanding of biological inheritance might be convergent, rather than incommensurable, \nwith that found among North American adults. Such a result would be consistent with the Innate \nConceptual Content hypothesis. \nIf Vezo adults were to differentiate biological inheritance from learning, practice and \nhabituation, they could recruit their differentiated understanding to reason about the transmission of \ngroup identity in two contrasting ways. As predicted by Hirschfeld\u2019s and Gil-White\u2019s proposals, \nVezo adults might naturalize group identity, construing it as a property of the person that is passed \non through descent, and is thereby impervious to one\u2019s upbringing. By contrast, as predicted by \nAstuti\u2019s (1995a, 1995b) ethnographic analysis, Vezo adults might reason that ancestry is irrelevant \nto the determination of a person\u2019s identity, as this is acquired by way of learning and performing the \npractices typical of the group. Two of our adoption scenarios are designed to address these different \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n37\n  \npredictions, and to explore the relation between participants\u2019 understanding of the transmission of \nan individual\u2019s properties and their construal of group identity. \nMethod \nOverall design \n Each participant heard two adoption scenarios. In one, both sets of parents were Vezo (the \nVezo-Vezo scenario) and in the other, one set was Vezo and the other Masikoro or Karany (the \nacross-group scenario). For roughly half of the participants the contrast in the latter scenario was \nVezo-Masikoro and for the other half it was Vezo-Karany. The order of presentation of the Vezo-\nVezo scenario and the across-group scenario was counterbalanced across participants. Adult \nparticipants took part in both versions of the task during the same session, and for this reason only a \nsummary of the second story was presented, with the salient new features highlighted (e.g., the fact \nthat the group identity of the birth and adoptive parents was different). \nParticipants \nParticipants were 31 adults (mean age = 42 years, range 22- to 90-years). Of these \nparticipants, 8 men and 7 women took part in the Vezo-Masikoro version of the task and 9 men and \n7 women took part in the Vezo-Karany version. Preliminary analyses showed no significant effect \nof sex in this or any of the other studies, therefore we have collapsed across sex in all analyses \nreported in this manuscript.  \n All participants in this and subsequent studies were from the Vezo village of Betania on the \nwestern coast of Madagascar. The interviews were all conducted in Malagasy by one of the \nresearchers (R.A.) who has been working in this village over the past 10 years and is well known to \nthe villagers.  In return for their work, participants were offered a small sum of money.  \nVezo \u2013 Vezo procedure \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n38\n  \nIn the Vezo-Vezo variation on the Solomon et al. (1996) adoption task, participants were \ntold a story of a baby who is born to one set of parents, but is raised by another (see Appendix A, \nVezo-Vezo Adoption Scenario; all of the adoption scenarios, in English and in Malagasy, are \navailable on-line, Astuti, Solomon & Carey, 2003). One set was said to be from a village to the \nnorth and the other from a village to the south (no cultural significance is attached by Vezo to the \nnorth\/south contrast). The birth parents (described in Malagasy as \u201cthe parents who generated the \nchild\u201d) were said to have died at the hands of a group of bandits roaming in the forest, and the \npeople who subsequently found the baby and adopted it (described as \u201cthe parents who raised the \nchild\u201d) had no knowledge of what had happened to the birth parents. In view of the fact that Vezo \nadoption normally occurs among closely related people, so that the adopted child maintains close \ncontacts with his\/her birth parents if they are still alive, our stories introduced the death of the birth \nparents as a way of preventing the conflation of the birth\/nurture contrast targeted by the task \nThe death of the birth parent was also introduced to distinguish the story presented in the \ntask from other culturally salient stories about babies abandoned in dangerous locations in the forest \nbecause they were born on inauspicious days (according to local divination systems). If such \nabandoned children are found alive, their inauspiciousness is thought to have no effect on their \nadoptive parents. When Vezo informants report such instances, they point out that once the child is \ngrown-up and ready to be of help, the birth parents will claim the child back (and the child typically \nrefuses to follow them). The story used in the task was devised to reduce the likelihood that \nparticipants would consider the birth parent as having any lingering claim over the child. \nAfter hearing the story, participants were asked a series of 12 resemblance questions in a \ntwo-alternative forced-choice paradigm. The birth parent was described as having one of a pair of \nfeatures, the adoptive parent as having the other, and the participants were asked what they thought \nthe little boy would be like when he grew up. For example, \u201cThe father who generated the boy, the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n39\n  \none from the northern village who died, he had shortish and wide feet; the father who raised the \nboy, the one from the southern village, he had longish and narrow feet. In your opinion, when the \nchild is all grown up, will he have shortish and wide feet like the father who generated him, or \nlongish and narrow feet like the father who raised him?\u201d Participants were not specifically asked for \nexplanations of their judgments, although they often spontaneously offered them. Justifications \nwere recorded by hand, in Malagasy, and later translated into English for coding. \nThe 12 feature pairs comprised 3 types of traits (see Appendix B, Table B1):  4 Bodily traits \n(e.g., longish, narrow nose \/ broad, flat nose); 4 Beliefs (e.g., believes that cows have stronger teeth \nthan horses \/ believes that horses have stronger teeth than cows); and 4 Skills (e.g., knows how to be \na mechanic but not a carpenter \/ knows how to be a carpenter but not a mechanic).  The feature pairs \nof each trait type were presented in blocks to make the task easier.  In each scenario, half of the \nparticipants heard the physical properties first, followed by the beliefs and then the skills, whereas \nthe other half heard the beliefs first, followed by the bodily traits and then the skills. \nVezo - Masikoro procedure \n  The Vezo-Masikoro version of the adoption task was identical to the Vezo-Vezo version in \nall but a few important ways. As in the Vezo-Vezo version, participants were told a story of a baby \nwho is born to one set of parents who die in the forest, and is found and raised by another. The \ncritical feature of this version is that one set of parents is Vezo and the other Masikoro, making the \nadoption occur across different groups. Crucially, after completing the property resemblance \nquestions, participants were asked whether the child would be Vezo or Masikoro (e.g., \u201cFinally, in \nyour opinion when the child is all grown up, is he going to be Masikoro like the father who \ngenerated him or Vezo like the father who raised him?\u201d), and in this case they were asked to justify \ntheir answer. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n40\n  \n  The across-group adoption scenarios probed two types of traits: Group Neutral Traits and \nGroup Typical Traits. The 8 Group Neutral feature pairs comprised 3 types of traits (see Appendix \nB, Table B2): 4 pairs of Group Neutral Bodily traits (e.g., pointed ears \/ roundish ears); 2 Group \nNeutral Beliefs (e.g., believes that chameleons have 20 teeth \/ believes that chameleons have 30 \nteeth); and 2 Group Neutral Skills (e.g., knows how to roll cigarettes but doesn\u2019t know how to make \nropes \/ knows how to make ropes but doesn\u2019t know how to roll cigarettes). These traits allow for an \ninternal replication of the patterns of judgments and justifications on the individual properties \nprobed in the Vezo-Vezo scenario.  \nParticipants were also tested for their judgments on Group Typical features, features that are \nnot neutral in regard to group identity. One value of each of the 6 group typical feature pairs was \ntypical of the Vezo and the other was typical of the Masikoro. They comprised 2 Group Typical \nBodily traits (e.g., has scarred fingers from the fishing line (typical of the Vezo) \/ has hard calluses \non his palms from hoeing (typical of the Masikoro), 2 Group Typical Beliefs (e.g., believes that an \noffering of rum is enough to complete the marriage ritual (Vezo) \/ believes that the marriage ritual \ncannot be completed unless one head of cattle is sacrificed (Masikoro)), and 2 Group Typical Skills \n(e.g., knows how to fish (Vezo) \/ knows how to cultivate rice (Masikoro)). The Group Typical traits \nfollowed the Group Neutral Traits of the same type, such that traits of each type (bodily traits, \nbeliefs, skills) remained blocked. \nIf Astuti\u2019s ethnographic description of how Vezo construe the difference between \nthemselves and the Masikoro is accurate, adults should reason that all of these group typical traits \nare acquired by learning and doing, and therefore that the child will resemble the adoptive parent \nboth in the group typical traits and in the group identity that is conferred upon him by those traits. \nConsistency in these judgments will become an issue when we turn to the children\u2019s data in Study \n2. If, by contrast, Vezo were to judge that group identity is fixed at birth, they could derive their \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n41\n  \npredictions about group typical properties from essentialized kind. This possibility is particularly \nimportant in the Vezo-Karany adoption scenario, to which we now turn. \nVezo - Karany procedure \nThe Vezo-Karany scenario was identical to the Vezo-Masikoro scenario in all ways except \nthat the contrast of note was between the Vezo and the Karany rather than the Vezo and the \nMasikoro. The details of the story were changed slightly in order to make it plausible that a Vezo or \na Karany baby might end up with adults of the other group. As in the Vezo-Masikoro scenario, \nparticipants were asked to make judgments about Group Neutral Bodily traits, Beliefs, and Skills, as \nwell as Group Typical Bodily traits, Beliefs, and Skills (see Appendix B, Table B3). All group \ntypical feature pairs were changed such that one was typical of the Karany (e.g., \"believes that one \nshould fast each year\" or \"knows how to drive\") rather than of the Masikoro. We also included one \nadditional trait type, Group Typical Inborn Bodily features (i.e., black vs. light skin, curly vs. \nstraight hair). Given that we expect the patterns of judgements on group neutral traits to reflect a \ndifferentiated understanding of the mechanisms of birth and social learning, we expect adults to \njudge that the child will resemble his birth father on these traits. We included them for two reasons: \nFirst, we did not want to restrict our probing to learned group typical traits, for we did not want to \nbias participants to judge the child\u2019s group identity in accordance with the performative theory of \ngroup identity. Second, these somatic differences, often commented upon by Vezo informants, \nmight drive group identity judgments in the opposite direction (e.g., participants might reason that if \nthe boy has light skin and straight hair, he is Karany; if he has black skin and curly hair, he is \nVezo). \nThe Vezo-Vezo, Vezo-Masikoro, and Vezo-Karany scenarios were each balanced across \nparticipants according to a Latin-Square design in order to control for the following potential \nconfounding factors: whether the bodily traits were presented before or after the beliefs (skills were \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n42\n  \nalways introduced last); which value of a pair of features was attributed to the birth parent; whether \nthe Vezo-Vezo task was administered first or second, and, in the cases of the Vezo-Masikoro and \nVezo-Karany versions, whether the birth parent was Vezo. Preliminary analyses conducted on these \nfactors revealed no significant effects of these variables.  Preliminary analyses testing for order \neffects were carried out for Studies 2 through 3 as well; there were never any main effects or \ninteractions involving order, and so all subsequent analyses collapse over these variables. Moreover, \nanalysis revealed there to be no difference in the Vezo-Vezo judgments between those participants \nwho had also taken part in the Vezo-Masikoro task and those who had also taken part in the Vezo-\nKarany task. Thus, in this and in Studies 2 and 3, the data from all participants will be pooled when \ndiscussing the Vezo-Vezo results. \nResults \nThe results will be presented in three sections. We first provide a qualitative sense of the \nadults\u2019 reactions to this task, followed by analyses of their patterns of judgments and justifications \nconcerning the resemblance of the child to his parents on group neutral traits. Finally we turn to the \njudgments about the child\u2019s social group identity and about his group typical traits in the across-\ngroup adoption scenarios. \nAdults\u2019 reactions to the task \nWe give a brief sense of Vezo adults\u2019 overall response to our protocol as a way of \naddressing the issue of its cross-cultural feasibility. As previously mentioned, the researcher who \nadministered the task was known to all adult participants as a result of her previous extended \nperiods of anthropological fieldwork in the village. Villagers were used to the fact that she asked a \nlot of questions, and were generally very cooperative in providing the necessary answers. However, \nthe adoption task was markedly different from the informal questioning the researcher had used \npreviously, and adult participants were initially rather doubtful about the seriousness of the exercise \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n43\n  \n(during the piloting stage, the researcher became aware that the rumor that she was wasting people\u2019s \ntime by asking silly questions was going around the village). We suspect that most of the frustration \nwas generated by the fact that people assumed that the researcher actually knew the \u201cright\u201d answer \nto the questions she was posing, thereby making their own contribution redundant and pointless. \nAware of this problem, the researcher introduced the task by explaining that some of the questions \nshe was about to ask could be answered in more than one way and that she was interested in the \ndifferent opinions that people might have about them. Also, she pointed out that she had been sent \nto do this job by her elders and teachers, and she asked her interlocutors to be supportive of her \nefforts to advance her studies, as they had so generously done in the past. This appeal almost always \nmanaged to well-dispose adult participants. Nonetheless, at the outset participants were visibly \npuzzled by the procedure, and it was only when they were well into the task \u2013 when they had \nrealized that some of the questions were about the adopted boy\u2019s physical appearance while others \nwere about his mind or character \u2013 that they became more engaged. Although not quantifiable, there \nwere at this point clear signs of recognition (e.g., \u201cNow I can see what this is all about!\u201d) as \nparticipants saw the point of what had seemed until then a pointless conversation. \nAnticipating the results analyzed below, in Table 1 we present one full protocol, which gives \na feel for the kind of response we elicited with the adoption task. Despite the unusual format of the \nquestions, Vezo adults were clearly able and willing to engage our task, as revealed by the \nthoughtful justifications provided by this participant (other protocols are available on-line, Astuti et \nal., 2003). This is further revealed by the analysis of their patterns of judgments, to which we now \nturn. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nFolkbiology: Resemblance Judgments for Group-Neutral Traits \nVezo-Vezo scenario\n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n44\n  \nIn order to capture how Vezo adults reasoned about the inheritance of properties, and \nwhether they drew the distinction between two chains of causal mechanisms (one associated with \nprocreation and the other with learning), participants were first characterized according to their \nindividual judgment patterns, as in Solomon et al. (1996). Each individual could, in principle, adopt \nthree different, equally coherent reasoning strategies: the first one, most consistent with the \nethnographic data discussed in the Introduction, would be an adoptive bias, according to which the \nchild is judged to resemble his adoptive parents on all traits. The second one, least consistent with \nthe ethnographic data, would be a birth bias, according to which the child is judged to resemble his \nbirth parents on all traits. The third one, which we take as evidence that the participant has a \nconcept of biological inheritance, would be a differentiated pattern in which the child is judged to \nresemble his birth parents on bodily traits and his adoptive parents on beliefs. \nIn the Vezo-Vezo task, participants were said to have shown a Differentiated Pattern if they \njudged the boy to resemble the birth father on at least three of the four Bodily traits and on none of \nthe four Beliefs, or on all four Bodily traits and on not more than one of the four Beliefs. This \ncriterion was chosen in order to allow for some reasonable deviation from a perfect categorical \npattern. The probability that such a pattern would emerge as a result of chance responding is .04, as \ndetermined by the binomial theorem; thus, we can be confident that participants who show a \nDifferentiated pattern of judgments distinguish between bodily traits and beliefs with respect to the \ncausal processes through which they are transmitted from parents to offspring. Note that judgments \non skills were not considered in determining the Differentiated pattern, since there is no reason that \nskills as a broad category should be considered a priori to be biologically inherited or not (consider, \nfor example, the case of musical talent). \n The other two systematic patterns of judgments were defined as follows. Participants were \nconsidered to have shown a Birth Parent Bias if they judged the boy to resemble the birth father on \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n45\n  \nat least 10 of the 12 features, and to have shown an Adoptive Parent Bias if they judged the boy to \nresemble the adoptive father on at least 10 of the 12 features. Each of these patterns has a .02 \nprobability of arising from a given participant\u2019s chance responding.   Finally, those participants who \ndid not show any of the above patterns were considered to have shown a Mixed Pattern. \n We will also report parametric analyses of participants\u2019 judgments. However, on their own \nsuch group analyses can obscure the performance of individuals. For example, if a minority of \nparticipants were more likely to judge the adopted boy to resemble his birth father on bodily traits \nthan on beliefs, while the rest of the participants judged at chance, an overall t-test would still be \nsignificant. Hence, we give priority to our pattern analysis. \n The data from the pattern analysis are consistent with the hypothesis that the understanding \nof biological inheritance develops under innate constraints. In spite of the vastly different cultural \ncontext of development, most Vezo adults, like their North American counterparts, understand that \nbodily features are determined by a chain of causal mechanisms associated with birth, whereas \nbeliefs are determined by upbringing. As can be seen in Table 2, 77% of adults showed a \nDifferentiated pattern of judgment. The remaining adults showed a variety of non-differentiated \npatterns: 6% showed a Birth Parent Bias, 3% showed an Adoptive Parent Bias, and 13% showed a \nMixed pattern. A second-order application of the binomial theorem, based on a probability of .04 \nthat a participant would show a Differentiated pattern by chance, indicates that the 24 adults who \nshowed this pattern is vastly more prevalent than would be expected by chance (p < .001).   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAnother indication that Vezo adults understand the mechanism of biological inheritance is \nthat they were virtually categorical in judging that the boy would resemble his birth father on bodily \ncharacteristics. Adults, including those who showed non-differentiated patterns, did so in spite of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n46\n  \nthe statements reported in the ethnographic literature about the unformed, water-like state of \nnewborns, and the influence of experiential factors on all traits of an individual. As can be seen in \nTable 3, adults overall distinguished between bodily traits and beliefs in their resemblance \njudgments (95% of bodily traits and 19% of beliefs were judged to be like those of the birth father). \nVezo adults, like Zafimaniry (Bloch et al., 2001) and North American adults (Solomon et al., 1996), \nalso tended to make resemblance judgments about skills much as they did about beliefs (24% \nfavored the birth father).  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n  As reported in the Introduction, Astuti\u2019s ethnographic observations provided many examples \nin which children\u2019s bodily traits (e.g., a club foot, a large nose) were attributed to the actions, likes \nand dislikes of the parents or of other socially significant people, rather than biological factors. Such \nreports suggest that Vezo adults might have reasoned that the protracted nurturing relations with his \nadoptive parents would shape the adopted boy\u2019s physical characteristics. Instead, only one out of \nthe 31 adult participants showed an Adoptive Parent bias pattern (see Astuti, et al. 2003 for this \nparticipant\u2019s full protocol).  \nVezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios \nBefore turning to an analysis of participants\u2019 justifications, we present the data for the group \nneutral traits from the two across-group adoption scenarios. This analysis provides a strong test of \nthe conclusion that Vezo adults have differentiated social and biological mechanisms of \ntransmission, for these scenarios introduce the complication of adoption across different social \ngroups.  \nIn the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios, as in the Vezo-Vezo scenario, \nparticipants\u2019 responses were characterized according to their individual judgment patterns on the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n47\n  \ngroup neutral traits: Differentiated Pattern, Birth Parent Bias, Adoptive Parent Bias and Mixed \nPattern. Because there were fewer group-neutral beliefs included in the across-group adoption \nscenarios, slightly different criteria were adopted. Participants were said to have shown a \nDifferentiated Pattern if they gave birth father judgments on at least three of the four Group Neutral \nBodily traits and on neither of the Group Neutral Beliefs (p < .08, binomial theorem); they were \nsaid to have shown a Birth Parent Bias if they gave birth father judgments on at least 7 of the 8 \nGroup Neutral features (p < .04); and they were said to have shown an Adoptive Parent Bias if they \ngave adoptive father judgments on at least 7 of the 8 features (p< .04).  \nOverall, the adults made inheritance judgments on the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany \ntasks much as they did on the Vezo-Vezo task: The majority showed a Differentiated pattern (see \nTable 2). As in the Vezo-Vezo scenario, they were also categorically more likely to judge that the \nchild would resemble his birth father in bodily traits and his adoptive father in beliefs, and, again, \njudgments on the group-neutral skills patterned with beliefs (Table 3).  \nA 2x2x3 repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) examined the effects of across-\ngroup scenario (Vezo-Masikoro vs. Vezo-Karany), adoption type (across-groups vs. within-group) \nand trait type (bodily traits vs. beliefs vs. skills) on the percentage of birth parent resemblance \njudgments.  There was a significant main effect for trait type, F(2,58) = 98.38, p < .001. Averaged \nacross all scenarios, adults judged that the child would resemble his birth father on physical traits \n95% of the time, on beliefs 20% of the time and on skills 25% of the time (see Figure 1).  Post hoc \nanalyses indicate that, as was expected, adults were significantly more likely to judge the bodily \ntraits to be inherited than they were the beliefs or the skills, which did not differ significantly from \none another. There were no other significant effects or interactions, indicating that Vezo adults did \nnot alter their judgments according to whether the adoption contrasted Vezo with Vezo, Vezo with \nMasikoro, or Vezo with Karany.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n48\n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 1 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nJustifications: all scenarios \nAdult participants were not asked to justify their resemblance judgments, but in several \ncases they spontaneously did so. Since the task was very repetitive, quite reasonably the participants \ngave justifications only for a selection of their judgments (17%), which they considered worthy of \ncomment (see protocol in Table 1, and those in Astuti et al., 2003). Justifications were coded \naccording to the criteria shown in Table 4.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 4 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nOrigins justifications were those that mentioned a mechanism that invoked the boy\u2019s birth \norigins in some manner, such as an explicit reference to reproduction, or the boy\u2019s ancestral origins. \nNurture justifications were those responses that mentioned a mechanism such as teaching, seeing, \nbecoming used to, growing up with, hearing the words of, following, and so on. Both of these types \nof justifications give evidence of causal reasoning. By contrast, Generated and Raised justifications \nwere simple restatements of the Malagasy term for the birth or the adoptive father used by the \nexperimenter, and Like Birth Father and Like Adoptive Father were simple restatements of the \nparticipant\u2019s own judgment.  These latter types of justifications were not considered references to a \ncausal mechanism, and for this reason they were conservatively coded as distinct from Origins or \nNurture justifications. Group justifications were those that referred to the boy\u2019s group identity. \nThese explanations suggested that group identity itself sufficed as an explanation, or at least was \ncentral to any explanation and was a basis for understanding the transmission of traits. Justifications \nwere coded as Individual Intrinsic if they denied that the property under consideration is acquired \nthrough either inheritance or learning, but is the result of random individual variations. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n49\n  \nJustifications were coded as Spiritual Connection if they invoked the dead parent\u2019s spiritual \ninfluence over the child or the intervention of metaphysical entities such as spirits or God. Finally, \nTruth\/Desirability justifications were those which invoked the truth or desirability of a property. All \nother justifications were coded as Other. Two experimenters coded the English translation of the \njustifications with 92% reliability; the first author resolved disagreements by consulting the original \nMalagasy version. \nVezo adults gave a total of 108 justifications, with 29 of the 31 (94%) adults producing at \nleast one. Thus, the mean number of justifications per participant was 3.5. Nurture justifications \nwere the most common, accounting for 43% of all justifications, followed by Origins justifications, \naccounting for 15% of the total. Adults also gave Spiritual Connection justifications 8% of the time \nand Individual Intrinsic justifications 9% of the time.  The less informative Generated and Like \nBirth Parent justifications accounted for 13% of the total, Raised and Like Adoptive Parent \naccounted for 4%, Truth\/Desirability and Group for 2% each, and the remaining 3% were coded as \nOther. This means that 76% of adults\u2019 justifications spelt out a clear causal mechanism for the \ntransmission of an individual\u2019s properties (i.e., Nurture, Origins, Spiritual Connection, or Individual \nIntrinsic). Ninety percent of adults who ever gave a justification produced at least one that spelt out \na causal mechanism. \nAcross the three scenarios, adults always gave justifications that were consistent with the \nreasoning implicit in their judgment (i.e., they only gave Origins justifications for birth judgments \nand Nurture justifications for adoptive judgments). Adults were also vastly more likely to offer a \njustification whenever their judgment deviated from the canonical Differentiated pattern than when \nit conformed to it. Of the 236 times participants judged a bodily trait to be like that of the birth \nfather, justifications were offered only 7% of the time. By contrast, of the 12 times participants \njudged bodily traits to be like those of the adoptive father, justifications were offered 67% of the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n50\n  \ntime. The difference is significant (\u03a72(1) = 46.85, p < .001). Similarly, of the 150 times participants \njudged beliefs to be like those of the adoptive father, they offered justifications only 15% of the \ntime, whereas of the 36 times they judged beliefs to be like those of the birth father, they offered \njustifications 42% of the time. This difference is also significant (\u03a72(1) = 12.38, p < .001). This \ndistribution indicates that participants\u2019 decisions as to whether a particular judgment was worthy of \nexplanation is significantly associated to whether the judgment departed from the understanding \nthat birth parentage determines bodily traits and that nurture shapes beliefs. This suggests that \nwhenever participants gave judgments that departed from the Differentiated pattern, they were \naware of the violation implied by their judgments and therefore made the effort of commenting on \nit. \n  A detailed reading of the justifications reveals the coherence of the theories held by adults, \nas well as their ability to articulate the theoretical and ontological presuppositions underlying their \njudgments. As we shall see, Vezo adults drew a number of distinctions: between the body, and the \nmind, character or spirit of the person; between skills that are passed on through one\u2019s line of \nancestry and skills that are acquired by listening and looking; between believing that one\u2019s adoptive \nfather is one\u2019s birth father and finding out that he is not. \n  Let us start with the distinction that motivated the performance of the overwhelming \nmajority of adults: As exemplified by the full protocol presented above (see also the protocols \navailable on-line in Astuti et al., 2003), adult reasoning was guided by the distinction between \n\u201cbody\u201d on the one hand, and \u201ccharacter\u201d, \u201c mind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d on the other, and between the causal \nmechanisms that affect each of these. Overall, adults who judged that the adopted boy would \nresemble his birth father in bodily traits and his adoptive father in beliefs and skills, were more \narticulate in describing the causal mechanism involved in the transmission of beliefs and skills than \nin describing the causal mechanism involved in the transmission of bodily traits. For the former, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n51\n  \nthey invoked learning, teaching, looking, hearing the words of the father who raised him, following \nhim, living with him, being used to him, working with him, as ways by which the adopted boy will \ncome to acquire the beliefs and skills of his adoptive father; in negative terms, they talked about the \nfact that the child was not around to catch the words of his birth father, that the father is not around \nto teach the boy what to believe or what to do, or that there is no way for the father who generated \nhim to be close to him.  \nBy contrast, informants rarely expanded on the causal mechanism by which the boy would \ncome to have the same bodily properties as his birth father. Two older women jokingly referred to \nsex, reminding the researcher that the man she had described as \u201cthe father who generated the boy\u201d \nwas the husband of the boy\u2019s mother, and that supposedly he was the one who had made the child \u2013 \nor wasn\u2019t he? (see Protocols 5 and 6 in Astuti, et al, 2003). One other informant referred to the \nmediation of blood, and yet another explained that the child resembles his birth father because he \ngot his \u201ctemplate\u201d from him (see Protocols 2 and 3 in Astuti, et al., 2003). Otherwise, despite the \noverwhelming percentage of birth judgments on bodily traits (95% in the Vezo-Vezo task; 98% in \nthe Vezo-Masikoro task; 92% in the Vezo-Karany task), adults\u2019 explanations of the specific \nmechanism that causes the resemblance were hard to come by. \nThe fact that Vezo adults were more prone to discuss the mechanism of nurture than the \nmechanism of birth is perhaps not surprising, given that the former is arguably more transparent \nthan the latter, especially for people who do not have access to scientific descriptions of the process \nof human reproduction (notably, none of the participants resorted to \u201cwestern\u201d accounts of \nbiological inheritance). Nonetheless, since Vezo adults\u2019 folk theories about procreation include the \nview that men contribute semen to the making of the child (see Astuti, 1993), one could have \nexpected adults to be more fluent in their explanations of the transmission of bodily traits from birth \nparents to offspring. That adults did not articulate these processes is consistent with the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n52\n  \nethnographic observation that nurture (learning, becoming, being used to), is a much more \nprominent feature of Vezo adults\u2019 discourse than birth (see Introduction). However, it is important \nto emphasize that the lack of verbal fluency is not a good predictor of participants\u2019 inferential \nreasoning \u2013 in other words, even if it is the case that their cultural preferences make Vezo adults \nless likely to produce explanations for their birth judgments on bodily traits, this did not make them \nany less likely to judge that birth parentage is part of the causal process that determines such traits. \nNot all Vezo adults showed the canonical Differentiated pattern. However, it is our \ncontention that most of the adults who showed a Non-Differentiated pattern did so as a result of a \nconscious and motivated violation of what they consider the usual processes that determine mental \nand bodily properties, that is, in the light of this distinction rather than as a consequence of an \nontological monism that collapses it. Several details of participants\u2019 justifications substantiate this \nclaim (see samples of non-differentiated protocols in Astuti et al., 2003). \nFirst, like the rest of our sample, adults who did not show a Differentiated pattern were \nnonetheless more likely to offer a justification for judgments that deviated from the canonical \npattern than for judgments that conformed with it (\u03a72(1) = 8.02, p < .005). That is, they gave \njustifications 43% of the time they made adoptive judgments on bodily traits or birth judgments on \nbeliefs, as compared to only 17% of the time they made birth judgments on bodily traits or adoptive \njudgments on beliefs. We have suggested earlier that this distribution indicates that these adults \nchose to comment on those judgments that violated the understanding that birth parentage \ndetermines bodily traits and that nurture shapes beliefs. Of course, for this to be the case, they \nwould have to have held a representation of the distinctions that underlie the violation.  \n  Second, the justifications given by adults for non-canonical judgments about bodily traits \n(i.e., that the child would resemble the adoptive father) were entirely consistent with their having a \ndifferentiated understanding. For example, the adults who did not show a Differentiated pattern and \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n53\n  \nmade such non-canonical judgments explained that the shape of the kidneys or the shape of the \nappendix is determined by what one eats, or that the shape of one\u2019s hands is determined by one\u2019s \noccupation. In all of these cases, the justifications were clearly intended to rectify what the \nparticipant regarded as our incorrect choice of trait (i.e., in their view, we had chosen an acquired \nrather than an inborn trait), and they thus reveal that the participants who made these non-canonical \njudgments were reasoning within a coherent theory of biological inheritance. \nSimilarly, justifications given by adults for non-canonical judgments regarding beliefs (i.e., \nthat they will resemble those of the birth father) reveal a differentiated understanding. These \njustifications are particularly interesting for they point to a type of mechanism not found in studies \nof North American adults.  Most of these justifications (9 out of 15) were of the Spiritual \nConnection type (see Protocols 4, 5 and 6 in Astuti et al., 2003). They invoked a variety of \nsupernatural or psychological interventions through which the adopted child would come to share \nthe beliefs of his birth father who, crucially, died when the child was just a baby. Some participants \ninvoked God as either the messenger between the father and the child or as the originator of the \nchild\u2019s thoughts, who forges the child\u2019s mind to be like that of the birth father. Other participants \nconcentrated instead on the state of mind of the child, and suggested that the child will intuitively \ndoubt what his adoptive father says to him. This intuition is believed to occur especially when\/if the \ntrue identity of the boy\u2019s adoptive parents is disclosed to the child (i.e. when he discovers that those \nhe thought were his parents had not, in fact, generated him); at this point, the character and \ndispositions of the parents who generated him would inevitably begin to \u201cwork\u201d on him.  \nThese comments suggest that most Vezo adults probably construe procreation as \nengendering a strong emotional and mental bond between birth parents and their children (certainly \nfar stronger than is captured in Astuti\u2019s, 1995a, ethnographic description). Notably, the \noverwhelming majority of Vezo adults who participated in our task did not recruit this idea to argue \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n54\n  \nthat this bond would continue to influence children once they were separated from their parents, and \njudged instead that the parental influence over children would die out if it were not nourished \nthrough everyday interactions. Nonetheless, those few adults who gave birth judgments on beliefs \nand produced Spiritual Connection justifications reasoned that parental influence is never \nextinguished, even in the face of death. Spiritual Connection justifications give us a sense of the \nextraordinary ways (by comparison with listening, hearing, looking, being raised, etc.) in which \nparticipants stipulated that a dead birth father continues to inform his child\u2019s beliefs. \nWhile we do not wish to deny that these Spiritual Connection justifications genuinely depart \nfrom reasoning likely to be found among North American adults, we also wish to point out that \nthese participants were probably aware that by invoking God, spirits, and the child\u2019s own \npsychological intuitions, they were violating their own understanding of the mundane ways in \nwhich beliefs are transmitted from parents to children. We suggest that their \u201cspiritual\u201d \njustifications served them to bridge the knowledge of how beliefs are normally transmitted, with the \nknowledge that children are (ought to be) powerfully connected to their birth parents. \nIn sum, we suggest that even the very few adults who did not show a Differentiated Pattern \nof judgments were sensitive to the distinction between birth and nurture as two separate causal \nmechanisms for the transmission of different kinds of properties. Of theoretical significance is the \nfact that these non-canonical judgments were given by participants who differentiated between the \nbiological mechanism responsible for the transmission of bodily properties, and a variety of non-\nbiological interventions (a message from God, a psychological intuition, etc.) responsible for the \ntransmission of beliefs (but see Protocol 4 in Astuti et al., 2003, for an exception). \nTo conclude the present analysis, we must briefly turn to the justifications provided for the \njudgments about the transmission of skills. When reasoning about skills, adults made some fine \ndiscriminations. Although informants disagreed on points of detail, there was convergence on the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n55\n  \nfollowing distinctions: there are skills that are easily learnt just by looking, and by participating in \nthe relevant activities (e.g. rolling cigarettes, making ropes); there are skills that are acquired as a \nresult of living in a certain environment where one has to provide for one\u2019s livelihood (e.g. fishing \nwith nets, fishing with the line); there are skills which are passed on from generation to generation, \nand are acquired by each new generation without effort \u2013 almost by instinct (e.g., carpentry); \nfinally, there are talents which are individual gifts from God, intrinsic to the person (e.g., singing \nand dancing). \nThe motivation for exploring how Vezo participants reason about the transmission of a \nvariety of different skills was the ethnographic observation that skills play a central role in defining \nwhat it means and what it takes to be Vezo. As we shall see in the section on resemblance \njudgments for group typical properties, Vezo participants are categorical in judging that the adopted \nboy will acquire the group-typical skills of his adoptive father. However, their responses about \ngroup-neutral skills reveal that the apparently simple notion that people are Vezo because they \nknow how to fish, and that they know how to fish because of the environment in which they live, \nemerges against a far more complex theoretical background in which some skills are learnt (just like \nfishing), while others are inherited from one\u2019s line of ancestors, and others still are given as gifts by \nGod or by one\u2019s personal destiny. \nA final point to be derived from the overall analysis of the justifications offered by our Vezo \ninformants is that the theoretically motivated differentiation between biological inheritance and \nlearning allows adults to elaborate nuanced and idiosyncratic theories about the transmission and \nacquisition of different types of skills, as well as to entertain the existence of extraordinary \nmechanisms that ensure that birth parents never cease to work on their children\u2019s minds. Despite the \nvastly different social, cultural, and educational contexts in which Vezo adults come to elaborate \nthese views, the fundamental questions they grapple with are arguably no different from those that \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n56\n  \nengage North American adults as they debate about the origin of such properties as intelligence or \nartistic genius (see Gelman, 2003, pp. 287-288 for a North American example). \nConclusions \n  In striking contrast to what Vezo informants state when they comment on the physiognomy \nof their babies \u2013 statements which anthropologists may be tempted to use as evidence of \nincommensurable ontological commitments \u2013 the present results show that Vezo adults clearly \ndifferentiate between the effects of the biological process of procreation (resemblance in bodily \ntraits) and the effects of social processes of nurturing, teaching, and learning (resemblance in beliefs \nand skills). Even those Vezo adults whose individual pattern of judgments deviated from the \ncanonical Differentiated Pattern, nonetheless gave justifications that revealed ideas formulated in \nterms of this principled differentiation. Some adults evinced beliefs in supernatural causal factors, \nbut these beliefs did not vitiate their differentiation of biological inheritance from socially mediated \nlearning mechanisms revealed by their overall performance in this task.  \nThese results extend in a more rigorously controlled manner those of Bloch et al. (2001) \nregarding the Zafimaniry and, taken together with converging results from Tamil and North \nAmerican adults, they bolster the claim made by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis that the \nunderstanding of biological inheritance may be an adult universal. \nFolksociology: Group Identity Judgments and Resemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits \nWe are now in a position to ask how Vezo adults reason about the acquisition of group \nidentity. Participants were asked, at the end of the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany adoption tasks, \nto judge what the adopted boy\u2019s group identity would be. On the basis of ethnographic data, Astuti \n(1995a, 1995b) argued that Vezo informants classify social groups on the basis of activity criteria, \nrather than in terms of common origins and shared descent. Given the reiteration in everyday \ndiscourse of the point that being Vezo or Masikoro depends on what people do, we predicted the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n57\n  \nfollowing outcome: that Vezo participants would judge that a boy raised by Vezo parents, in a \ncoastal village, would acquire the properties typical of Vezo people and would become Vezo as a \nresult, no matter who his father was. Similarly, we predicted that they would judge that a boy raised \nby Masikoro parents, in a village in the interior, would acquire the properties typical of Masikoro \npeople and would consequently become Masikoro. \nOf greater theoretical significance is the outcome of the Vezo-Karany task. In contrast to the \nVezo-Masikoro scenario, in this case the adoption takes place between people of clearly separate \nancestral origins, who are somatically different, do not intermarry, are of diverging economic status, \nand practice a different religion. The question whether a boy born of Vezo parents and adopted by \nKarany parents is Vezo or Karany (or vice versa), is the real test case for the ethnographic claim \nthat Vezo classify social groups in terms of their activities. If Astuti\u2019s analysis is an accurate \ndescription of Vezo reasoning about group identity, then birth origins should not be a determining \nfactor in participants\u2019 reasoning even in the case of the Vezo-Karany adoption. Alternatively, on \nGil-White\u2019s analysis, the nature of the contrast between Vezo and Karany should trigger the \nhypothesized naturalization of ethnic kind, and it might also trigger Hirschfeld\u2019s universal Human \nKind Competence. If so, the adopted boy\u2019s group identity will be naturalized, in the sense of being \njudged to be inherited from his birth parents, and essentialized, in the sense of driving the \nattribution of group typical traits. \nGroup Identity Judgments \nAs predicted, the overwhelming majority of adults (87%) who participated in the Vezo-\nMasikoro scenario gave judgments that were consistent with Astuti\u2019s ethnographic description: they \njudged that a boy born to one set of parents but raised by another would grow up to be of the same \ngroup as his adoptive parents. More importantly, the majority of adults (78%) in the Vezo-Karany \nversion of the task also judged that the boy would be of the same group as his adoptive parents. He \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n58\n  \nwould be Vezo if born to Karany and raised by Vezo parents, or Karany if born to Vezo and raised \nby Karany parents. Of the remaining 22% of adult participants, three gave straightforward birth \njudgments, and the remaining adult judged the boy to be \u201cmetisse,\u201d a term normally used to refer to \npeople whose birth parents belong to different \u201cracial\u201d groups, most commonly to children of \nMalagasy and European parents. Participants were not significantly more likely to make adoptive \ngroup judgments in the Vezo-Masikoro task than they were in the Vezo-Karany task. \nDespite the striking similarity between judgments in the two scenarios, participants\u2019 reaction \nto the question about the adopted boy\u2019s group identity was markedly different in the two cases. In \nthe Vezo-Masikoro task, adults took no time to come up with the answer \u2013 the response was \nautomatic, given without much reflection. This is consistent with the observation that the labeling of \npeople as \u201cVezo\u201d or \u201cMasikoro\u201d on the basis of their abilities to perform Vezo or Masikoro \nactivities (e.g., fishing as opposed to planting) permeates every day conversations, and that the \ntransition between being Vezo and becoming Masikoro (or vice versa) is not an unknown \noccurrence. By contrast, participants in the Vezo-Karany task often hesitated before answering the \nquestion about the boy\u2019s group identity. They sometimes stated that they were unsure, that they \nneeded a bit more time to think about the issue; they often commented that this was a difficult \nquestion. For sure, the Vezo-Karany scenario presented them with a novel situation they had never \ncontemplated in their conversation nor had they ever encountered in real life, since no Vezo has \never become Karany, nor a Karany has ever become Vezo. Yet, having thought long and hard about \nit, the overwhelming majority of participants recruited the way of reasoning they normally apply to \nthe familiar Vezo-Masikoro scenario (that group identity is determined by what people do), and \nthey productively extended it to this novel social context. \nResemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n59\n  \n  In both Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany versions of the adoption tasks, participants were \nasked to judge whether the adoptive boy would resemble the birth or the adoptive father on a \nnumber of properties that Vezo informants regard as typical of Vezo, Masikoro and Karany people. \nIn both Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios we tested three types of properties: bodily traits \nthat result from one\u2019s occupation; occupational skills; customary practices and religious beliefs. \nSince there are no inborn somatic differences between Vezo and Masikoro, we were able to test \nthese traits (skin color and hair type) only in the Vezo-Karany scenario.  \n  In the case of the Vezo-Masikoro version of the task, adults gave adoptive parent judgments \nfor 100% of the group typical traits. For example, they judged that a child raised by Masikoro \nparents will grow up to believe that the marriage ritual cannot be completed unless the family of the \ngroom offers one head of cattle to the family of the bride (Masikoro-typical custom), and that he \nwill know how to ride an oxen-driven cart (Masikoro-typical activity). Note that in the same \nscenarios, the very same participants gave birth parent judgments 20% of the time on group-neutral \nbeliefs and 20% of the time on skills. However, when they considered group-typical properties, they \nbecame categorical in judging that nurture, learning and habituation are the only causal mechanisms \nresponsible for the transmission of such properties. In the case of the Vezo-Karany scenario, \nparticipants\u2019 judgments were similarly categorical. Only 6% of the time participants gave birth \nparent judgments on group-typical beliefs and acquired bodily properties, and only 2% of the time \non skills (in the Vezo-Karany scenario, these very participants gave 22% birth judgments on group-\nneutral beliefs and 34% on group-neutral skills). \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 2 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nWhen, in the Vezo-Karany task, participants were asked about the skin color and hair type \nof the adopted boy, they overwhelmingly responded that the boy would resemble his birth father on \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n60\n  \nthese traits (88% of birth judgments for skin color, and 94% for hair type). These results confirm \nthat Vezo adults understand that qualitatively different causal mechanisms lead to the transmission \nof inherited and non-inherited traits, and show that these mechanisms are held to operate whether or \nnot the traits could potentially be construed as markers of group identity. \nAlthough these results are not surprising in the light of the data presented above on \nresemblance judgments concerning group-neutral traits, it is nonetheless worth pointing out that \nparticipants could have construed the group-typical properties differently from the way they did. \nFor example, they could have reasoned, as some adults did in the case of neutral beliefs, that one\u2019s \nreligious beliefs are implanted in one\u2019s mind or spirit through one\u2019s spiritual connection with one\u2019s \nbirth parents; or they could have reasoned, as some adults did in the case of neutral skills, that one\u2019s \noccupational dispositions are transmitted through one\u2019s line of descent (this is precisely the view \nthat informs the Indian caste system). Instead, the small but consistent margin of deviation from the \ncanonical Differentiated Pattern that we observed when participants answered questions about \nneutral properties entirely disappears when they were asked to reason about group-typical properties \n(compare Figures 1 and 2; adult participants).   \nJustifications \nWe present participants\u2019 justifications for group identity judgments together with their \njustifications for resemblance judgments on group-typical properties. The reason for this is that \nthese judgments are closely linked in people\u2019s reasoning about group identity. There are two ways \nin which participants could have established this link: (a) by essentializing group identity, and \nderiving a person\u2019s group-typical properties from it (e.g., the person is Vezo and therefore she has \nVezo group-typical properties); or (b) by appealing to the acquisition of group-typical traits to \nderive the person\u2019s group identity (e.g., the person has acquired Vezo-typical properties and \ntherefore she is Vezo). Consistently, our adult participants adopted the second strategy. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n61\n  \nIn both the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios, participants offered justifications \nfor their judgments on the resemblance on non-inherited group-typical properties roughly 1\/5 of the \ntime (18% in the Vezo-Masikoro task, 22% in the Vezo-Karany task). Twenty-three of the 31 adults \nprovided a total of 37 justifications, an average of 1.6 per participant offering any justification at all. \nThe same coding criteria used for the justifications given for group neutral properties were used for \nthe justifications given for group typical properties. \nIn both tasks, the overwhelming majority of justifications given in support of adoptive \njudgments were coded as Nurture justifications (75% in the Vezo-Masikoro scenario, 90% in the \nVezo-Karany scenario). This means that participants made explicit reference to mechanisms of \ntransmission such as learning, teaching, seeing and being used to the adoptive father\u2019s ways. By \ncontrast, only 19% of the justifications for adoptive judgments in the Vezo-Masikoro scenario, and \nnone in the Vezo-Karany scenario, were Group justifications, which invoked the boy\u2019s group \nidentity (i.e., he has property x because he is Vezo or Masikoro or Karany) as a sufficient \nexplanation for why the boy has a certain group-typical property.  \nJustifications given for resemblance judgments on inborn group-typical bodily traits (skin \ncolor and hair type) similarly reflected direct reasoning about the transmission of the trait, not \ninference from group categorization, regardless of whether they were given to explain the boy\u2019s \nresemblance to his birth parent or adoptive parent (e.g. the boy\u2019s skin will be black like his birth \nfather\u2019s because skin color cannot change, or it will be black like that of his adoptive father because \nit will get exposed to sea water and to the sun). Two of the three justifications given for birth parent \njudgments were coded as Origins and one was coded as Generate, and two of the three justifications \ngiven for adoptive parent judgments were coded as Nurture and one as Other. \nParticipants were explicitly asked to provide a justification for their judgment on group \nidentity. Justifications were given 73% of the time in the Vezo-Masikoro task, and 94% of the time \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n62\n  \nin the Vezo-Karany task (recall that each participant only made one such identity judgment). In \norder to capture more precisely the nature of participants\u2019 reasoning about group identity, we have \nbroken the broader Nurture justification type into four subtypes (see Table 5): Upbringing \njustifications are those that refer to the fact that the boy was brought up by Vezo, Masikoro or \nKarany people; Environment justifications are those that specifically mention the place where the \nboy grew up; Customs justifications are those that specifically mention the customs that the boy will \nacquire (or fail to acquire) as a result of his upbringing, and Occupation justifications are those that \nspecifically mention the boy\u2019s occupation.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 5 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe results reveal an interesting qualitative difference between the justifications offered by \nadults on the two tasks. The majority of the justifications given by participants in the Vezo-Karany \ntask made explicit reference to the fact that the child would follow the customs of the adoptive \nfamily (54% of all the justifications given for adoptive judgments were coded as Customs, 15% as \nEnvironment, 15% as Upbringing, and 15% as Other). By contrast, participants in the Vezo-\nMasikoro task were usually content to mention that the child was being brought up by Vezo or \nMasikoro parents, or that he was being raised in a Vezo or Masikoro village (56% of the \njustifications for adoptive judgments were coded as Upbringing, 33% as Environment and only 11% \nas Customs). \nThus, the adults who participated in the Vezo-Karany task were more likely than were those \nin the Vezo-Masikoro task to invoke customs than environment or upbringing in their justifications \n(\u03a72(1)= 5.69, p < .02). This result suggests that, having never thought about a Vezo-Karany \nadoption scenario before, participants had to reconstruct in their minds the entire causal sequence \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n63\n  \nstep by step: Which \u201cways of doing\u201d is the child going to acquire? What kind of person will he be, \ngiven that he has got used to follow these \u201cways of doing\u201d? Note that participants could have \npursued the reverse strategy; they could have assigned the adopted boy to a group (e.g., he is \nKarany), and they could have stipulated that because he is Karany, he will grow up to believe \nKarany beliefs and follow Karany customs. Instead, the direction of participants\u2019 causal reasoning \nwas reversed: it is because the boy has a certain group-typical property, that he has a certain group \nidentity. \nArguably, determining that a Vezo baby adopted by Karany parents is going to be Karany \nrequires significantly more novel reasoning than does determining that a Karany baby adopted by \nVezo parents is going to be Vezo. The latter scenario can be easily accommodated by the explicitly \nheld theory that Vezo identity is a matter of performing Vezo activities. On this view, anybody can \nbecome Vezo, so long as one learns to act in Vezo fashion (and indeed this judgment was extended \nto the foreign anthropologist, once she familiarized herself with Vezo life style). However, the \nscenario where a Vezo baby is adopted by Karany people requires a much more radical extension of \nVezo identity theory, since it requires attributing to the Karany the notion that being Karany is a \nmatter of performing Karany activities. Given that there is very little evidence in the social world to \nsupport this view, Vezo participants might well have thought that the Karany would not accept a \nVezo child into their ranks. But the results show that adults were not, in fact, more likely to judge \nthe boy to have the group identity of his birth father when the adoptive parent was Karany (25%) \nthan when the adoptive parent was Vezo (19%).  \nIn both tasks, about a quarter of the participants reasoned that the adopted boy would grow \nup to be Vezo, Masikoro or Karany like his birth father, and offered justifications that referred to \nthe boy\u2019s birth origins and ancestry. There are two important points that should be stressed here: \nFirst, despite their birth judgments on group identity, participants reasoned that the adopted boy \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n64\n  \nwould have the group typical properties of the social group that raised him, as is consistent with a \ndifferentiated understanding of biological inheritance and social learning. Second, by mobilizing \nsuch differentiated understanding, these adults were able to redefine Vezo, Masikoro and Karany \ngroup identities as a feature of the person that is fixed at birth and cannot change as a result of \nupbringing. Although this view goes against the cultural consensus, it does so by resorting to the \nsame theoretically motivated ontological distinctions. \nDiscussion \nWe have begun this SRCD monograph on conceptual development with a study of adults for \ntwo reasons. Obviously, adult knowledge is a major source of input into the developmental process, \nand we cannot take adult conceptualization of any given domain of knowledge for granted. This is \nespecially true in a cross-cultural study such as this one. But equally significantly, we must \ninterrogate the adult end-state to establish whether the developmental process yields representations \nthat are cross-culturally universal (as predicted by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis) or \ncross-culturally variable (as predicted by the Unconstrained Learning hypothesis), as a way of \ndeciding between competing views of the nature of conceptual development. \nStudy 1 failed to support the widespread anthropological claim about cross-cultural \nvariability in the ontological commitments that underpin the conceptual representations of processes \nof biological and social transmission of a person\u2019s individual properties. Ethnographic descriptions \nof Vezo cultural statements and beliefs about babies\u2019 physiognomy motivated the hypothesis that \nVezo adults might not differentiate bodily from mental properties of the person, biological from \nsocial family, nor the mechanisms of transmission that depend on biological inheritance from those \nthat depend upon learning. Patterns of family resemblance judgments as well as the justifications for \nthose judgments showed this hypothesis to be false. Every single Vezo adult we interviewed judged \nthat a child born to one set of parents and raised by another would resemble his birth father on \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n65\n  \nbodily traits, and differentiated these resemblance judgments from those on beliefs and skills. Most \nVezo adults did so categorically, just as North American adults do.  \nThe extent to which these results contrast with much of current anthropological literature \nmay be difficult for psychologists to fully appreciate. To illustrate, consider the comment made by \nan anthropologist discussant on a panel at the American Anthropological Association conference in \nwhich Astuti presented some of these data: \u201cI\u2019m suspicious of the discovery of our own cultural \ncategories in the non-verbal subterranean recesses of other people\u2019s minds\u201d (McKinnon, 2002). It is \ncertainly right to be deeply suspicious, but in the end, it is an empirical question whether and when \nnon-western peoples have different cultural categories from our own. As we have already noted, our \nadoption scenarios may have elicited a differentiated understanding that is not normally evident in \nVezo discourse, but such an understanding had to be available to Vezo participants in order to be \nelicited. Furthermore, the explicit justifications our informants produced showed these categories \nnot to be in the subterranean recesses of their minds. \nOne might reply that we are over-interpreting our data. Perhaps participants judged that the \nchild would resemble his birth parent on bodily traits not because of their understanding of \nbiological inheritance as distinct from social learning mechanisms as we claim, but because they \nreasoned that prenatal social influences determine these traits. Several considerations militate \nagainst this possibility. First, not a single participant ever made this argument in a justification for \nthe judgment that the child would resemble his birth father. Second, Astuti, Solomon and Carey (in \npreparation) carried out an additional study designed to elicit precisely such reasoning, if available. \nIn this study, the adoption scenario involved two classificatory sisters, and the child was a girl \ninstead of a boy. The fact that the targeted parents were closely related women meant that the new \nscenario drew particular attention to the prenatal period, when the fetus is said to be particularly \nsusceptible to the molding influence of its mother\u2019s actions and social interactions (e.g., whether she \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n66\n  \nkeeps to her taboos, whether she has lovers, the people she befriends, the people she accepts food \nfrom), as well as to the nurturing contribution of the adoptive mother, who was described as having \nbreast-fed the baby-girl. This adoption scenario could thus have encouraged participants to give \nmore adoptive resemblance judgments on bodily traits and qualitatively different justifications. \nInstead, both the patterns of resemblance judgments and the justifications were identical to those of \nthe present study in every respect. \nIn sum, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that conceptual representations of \nbiological inheritance develop under innate constraints, leading to cross-cultural convergence of, \nrather than to incommensurability between, adult representations in this aspect of the domain of \nfolkbiology. But although cross-cultural universality in the adult end-state is a prediction of the \nInnate Conceptual Content hypothesis, it does not provide knockdown evidence for it. After all, \neven the Unconstrained Learning hypothesis can accommodate the fact that, if the world provides \nmassive data in favor of some conceptual representations, those could emerge cross-culturally in the \nabsence of innate constraints on learning. Thus, as noted in the Introduction, the Innate Conceptual \nContent hypothesis needs validation through developmental data. Study 2 will therefore turn to \nVezo children to test the specific prediction made by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis: that \nirrespective of significant cross-cultural variations in input conditions, the conceptual \nrepresentations in question emerge early in development in all cultural contexts. \nTurning now to the domain of folksociology and to the naturalization of human kinds, adult \njudgments and justifications confirmed that Vezo consider group identity to be determined by what \npeople do, by the customs they follow, and by the beliefs they hold. Most importantly, Vezo adults \nextended this theory of group identity from the contrast between Vezo and Masikoro, a contrast that \nis the object of much cultural elaboration and is the subject of everyday conversations, to a novel \ncontrast, that between Vezo and Karany. This finding not only demonstrates that Vezo theory is \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n67\n  \nproductive, allowing for generalization to novel instances, but also that it applies to distinctions that \nin western folksociology would be construed in racial terms. Despite the fact that Karany people are \nexplicitly represented by Vezo informants as somatically, linguistically, religiously and \neconomically different from themselves, and despite the fact that Vezo and Karany do not \nintermarry, the majority of adult participants extended to them a system of social classification that \nis activity based, that does not essentialize their identity and does not naturalize their difference \n(i.e., Vezo adults do not appeal to birth origins and biological inheritance to explain it). This finding \nchallenges both Hirschfeld\u2019s claim about the universal deployment of the Human Kind Competence \nand Gil-White\u2019s claim about the universal construal of ethnic kinds as animal species. Our data on \nfolksociology, therefore, provide supportive evidence for the claim that adult representations in this \ndomain of knowledge are not cross-culturally universal. In Study 2, we shall turn to developmental \ndata to explore two contrasting predictions arising from this finding: the first one, motivated by the \nUnconstrained Learning hypothesis, is that the construction of the adult theory is a steady and \nincremental process of internalization, the unmediated result of the input children derive from the \nadult culture; the second one, motivated by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis, is that the \nconstruction of the adult theory requires children to overturn their initial intuitions, which run \ncounter the adult culture and which are not generated from it.  \nFinally, the results of Study 1 allow us to explore the relations between a differentiated \nunderstanding of the transmission of individual traits and the Vezo performative theory of group \nidentity. Resemblance judgments on group-typical traits were categorically differentiated. All adults \nin the Vezo-Karany task judged that the child would have the somatic traits (skin color and hair \ntype) of his birth father, but judged that the child would have the group-typical skills, customs, and \nbeliefs of the adoptive father. In accord with the claim that group identity is not essentialized, \nparticipants\u2019 judgments about group-typical properties were not derived from their judgments about \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n68\n  \ngroup identity. On the one hand, the former were not justified by invoking the latter; rather, \nparticipants\u2019 group identity judgments were justified in terms of the occupation, beliefs and customs \nacquired by the adopted boy as a result of his upbringing and place of residence. On the other hand, \nthe substantial minority of participants (about 20%) who judged that the adopted child\u2019s group \nidentity would be that of his birth father, did not reason any differently from the rest about the \nadopted boy\u2019s group-typical properties (i.e., the boy was judged to resemble the adoptive father on \nall of these).  \nThese data suggest that the Vezo performative theory of group identity depends upon the \ndifferentiation of biological inheritance from social learning. In the face of such a differentiated \nunderstanding, some Vezo adults naturalized group identity, taking it to be fixed by a person\u2019s \nancestral origins. Nonetheless, in this study there was no evidence that group identity was also \nessentialized, for these participants\u2019 reasoning about group-typical properties was not driven by \ntheir group identity judgments.  Study 2 will enable us to further explore the relation between a \ndifferentiated understanding of the mechanisms of trait transmission and the performative theory of \ngroup identity, by asking whether young children have such a differentiated understanding and, if \nnot, whether in its absence they understand their parents\u2019 theory. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n69\n  \nChapter III \nSTUDY 2. CHILDREN: FAMILY RESEMBLANCE AND GROUP IDENTITY \nThe finding that Vezo adults have an understanding of biological inheritance that is \ncommensurable with that of their North American counterparts gives support to the hypothesis that \nfolkbiological concepts develop under some form of innate constraints. In this chapter, we shall test \nthe prediction of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis, that concepts with innately specified \nbiological content ought to be in evidence in early childhood. Specifically, the data presented in this \nchapter address the claim that, irrespective of input conditions, very young children \u2013 perhaps as \nyoung as 3 or 4 years of age \u2013 have a biological understanding of family resemblance (Atran et al., \n2001; Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Hirschfeld, 1996; Springer & Keil, 1989, 1991). A number of \nstudies have already reported data that challenge this claim. For example, Solomon et al. (1996) \nfound that it is not until 6 or 7 years of age that the majority of North American children can be \ncredited with this understanding (see also Gimenez & Harris, 2002; Springer, 1996; Weissman & \nKalish, 1999; Williams & Affleck, 1999 for converging results). Mahalingham (1998) found that \nthe majority of urban Tamil children in India did not show this understanding before the age of 12 \nyears. Finally, Bloch et al.\u2019s (2001) preliminary data suggest that among rural Zafimaniry in \nMadagascar an understanding of biological inheritance is only attained in adulthood. Studies 2 and \n3 seek to verify Bloch et al.\u2019s findings with a larger sample of Malagasy children (Study 2) and \nadolescents (Study 3) in a more systematic fashion, using better controlled and counterbalanced \nmaterials. \nWith respect to folksociological concepts of human groups, the adult data presented in Study \n1 failed to confirm the hypothesis that all humans, irrespective of the socio-political environment in \nwhich they live, will conceptualize human groups as if they were natural kinds, that is by \nnaturalizing and essentializing them (i.e., believing that membership in them is inherited from birth \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n70\n  \nparents, and that a person's properties can be predicted from membership). Nonetheless, the \nperformative theory of group identity we have documented among Vezo adults could be the result \nof two very different developmental processes: it could result from a gradual and incremental \nprocess of internalization entirely shaped by culturally specific input, as posited by the \nUnconstrained Learning hypothesis; or it could be the result of a historically contingent process of \ncultural construction, which overturns the earlier predisposition to both naturalize and essentialize \nhuman kinds that is hypothesized by Hirschfeld (1996) (Gil-White\u2019s, 2001 proposal has unclear \ndevelopmental implications, since it is unlikely that young children are aware of the social rule of \nendogamy, which is said to trigger the naturalization of ethnic groups). The developmental data \npresented in this chapter bear on this critical issue. \nFinally, Study 2 explores the relationship between understanding biological inheritance and \nreasoning about group identity. If the reasoning about group identity shown by Vezo adults in Study \n1 depends upon the differentiation of biological and social mechanisms for the transmission of \nbodily and mental\/experiential properties of the person, then the question of whether children show \na similar differentiated understanding is of added theoretical importance. It is to be empirically \ndemonstrated whether Vezo children have mastered this differentiation, and, furthermore, whether \nthey must have such conceptual resources in order to understand their parents\u2019 performative theory \nof identity. Study 2 allows us to explore these possibilities. \nMethod \nParticipants \nParticipants were 40 children (mean age = 9 years, range 6- to 13-years) from the same \nVezo village of Betania as the adults. Twenty children, 12 girls and 8 boys, took part in the Vezo-\nMasikoro version of the task (mean age = 9 years, range = 6- to 13-years) and 20 children, 10 girls \nand 10 boys, took part in the Vezo-Karany version (mean age = 10 years, range = 7- to 13-years). \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n71\n  \nThe age of 13 years was defined, a priori, as separating childhood proper (Study 2) from \nadolescence (Study 3). The distinction between children and adolescents roughly corresponds to the \nlocal distinction between sexually inactive children and sexually active but still unmarried boys and \ngirls, a transition marked by the fact that at around the age of 13 boys and girls are no longer \nallowed to sleep in their parents\u2019 house. Adolescents may have children of their own, but they are \nnot normally responsible for them if they are not formally married. The age at which the adolescent \nand adult groups are divided roughly corresponds to the age at which boys and girls begin to have \nfamilies of their own, which involves having a stable partner, children, a separate house, and an \nindependent source of livelihood.  \nThe age ranges in these groups are large.  For every analysis we present in these chapters, \npreliminary analyses were first conducted that compared the performance of the younger half of the \nsample to the older half.  That is, we compared the 6- to-9-year-olds to the 10- to-13-year olds, and \nwe compared the 14- to 16-year-olds to the 17- to 19-year-olds. In no case was the result significant.  \nNo doubt, with larger samples, differences within these age ranges would emerge, but for a first \npass these age ranges allow us to sketch the broad strokes of the course of conceptual development \nin these related domains of folkbiology and folksociology. \nWith few exceptions, children came to the researcher\u2019s house as, according to local customs, \nthey are expected to do when a grown-up needs them. In return for their participation, they were \noffered a small sum of money. Although permission to work with the children was formally granted \nat the village assembly, Vezo parents expressed the view that their consent was both superfluous \nand ineffective since their \u201chard-headed\u201d children would be free to decide whether they wanted to \nwork with the researcher or not. They warned the researcher that their children did not know \nanything and that she would be wasting her time trying to get any sense out of them.  \nProcedure \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n72\n  \n The procedures for this study were like those of Study 1 with a few minor changes.  As the \nstory was recited, children were shown pictures of Vezo or Masikoro villages or of a Karany \ncompound (not recognizable as any actual village or compound) in order to make the story and the \nquestions easier to follow. None of the traits probed in the task was represented in the pictures. \nBefore proceeding with the testing, the experimenter questioned the participants to make sure that \nthey understood the story. Participants were asked: \u201cWho was the father who generated the boy? \nWas he the man from this village [pointing to one picture] or the man from this village [pointing to \nthe other picture]?\u201d and \u201cWho was the father who raised the boy? The man from this village or the \nman from this village? [pointing to the pictures] Where was the child raised? Here or there? \n[pointing to the pictures]\u201d. Participants who failed the comprehension probes were told the story a \nsecond time. One child did not pass the probes after two tellings of the story and was dropped from \nthe study. Children participated in the two tasks (within-group and across-groups tasks) on different \ndays, and the second story was narrated to them in full. Unlike Study 1, at the end of the across-\ngroups task, children were also asked to rate whether each of the group-typical beliefs attributed to \nthe birth parent were in fact typical of the parent\u2019s group (e.g., \u201cDo you remember, I told you that \nthe Vezo father from this village on the coast [pointing to the picture] believed that an offering of \nrum is enough to complete the marriage ritual? In your opinion, is it just him who believes this, or is \nit the majority of Vezo people who believe that way?\u201d). The final difference is that children were \nexplicitly asked to justify their resemblance judgments for individual properties as well as for their \ngroup identity judgments (adults were only asked to justify the latter). Children were asked to \njustify at least one judgment for each of the sets of bodily traits, beliefs, and skills. If no justification \nwas forthcoming, the experimenter asked them to justify the following judgment of the same type. \nCounterbalancing was conducted as in Study 1.  \nResults \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n73\n  \nChildren\u2019s reactions to the task \nAs mentioned earlier, Vezo parents regarded their children as free agents who could decide \nwhether they wanted to participate in the task or not. As it turned out, children were eager to do so, \nprobably because they enjoyed being at the center of attention, and because they knew they would \nget a small gift at the end. The children referred to the adoption task as a tapasiry, the local term for \nfictional tales (as opposed to ancestral narratives) that are traditionally recounted as an evening \npastime. Numerous children gathered each day around the researcher\u2019s house. Korsia, the \nresearcher\u2019s Vezo \u201csister\u201d, helped each day to recruit the children of the right age and sex, and \nchased the rest away. \nChildren came into the researcher\u2019s house for the administration of the task; most of the \nchildren had been there before to play with the researcher\u2019s son, and having him around made her \nhouse a far less intimidating place than it would have been otherwise. In most cases, children took \ntime to observe their surroundings (e.g., the researcher\u2019s belongings), and when their curiosity was \nsatisfied they were introduced to the task. Children were then told that they were going to hear a \nstory and be asked some questions about it. The researcher stressed that she wanted to know what \nthey thought about it, and that it wasn\u2019t a case of giving right or wrong answers since different \npeople, even grown-ups, have different opinions on these things. They were asked to listen carefully \nand to think hard about the questions. They all nodded contentedly and set out to listen.  \nDuring the piloting stage, it became obvious that children younger than 6 or 7 would not be \nable to participate in the task. Vezo adults were adamant that all children lack wisdom and so are \nunable to answer questions sensibly. In fact, it is likely that these younger children were simply too \nshy and too intimidated by the testing situation. Vezo children are not used to have genuine \nquestions put to them (that is, questions to which they are expected to have independently formed \nanswers), and the youngest children responded with total passivity. It should be added that the main \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n74\n  \nproblem did not seem to be the researcher\u2019s foreignness, since the children seemed far less \nintimidated by her than by her Vezo \u201csister\u201d, who would quickly lose her temper and, in typical \nadult fashion, would tell them to stop wasting our time by sitting with their mouths shut! Even the \n6- to 13-year-old children who were able to cope with the formal structure of the procedure were \ngenerally shy. Many chose to answer the questions by pointing to the picture associated with the \ntrait or parent of their choice. As reported below, most children gave at least one justification for \ntheir judgments, but this often required repeated probing.  \nFolkbiology:  Resemblance Judgments for Group-Neutral Traits \n Vezo-Vezo scenario \nAs in Study 1, participants\u2019 responses were characterized according to their individual \npattern of judgment for group neutral traits.  The same criteria as in Study 1 were used to classify \nchildren\u2019s judgment patterns as Differentiated (i.e., judged the boy to resemble his birth father on \nbodily traits and his adoptive father on beliefs), Birth Parent Bias (i.e., tended to judge the boy to \nresemble his birth father on most all traits), Adoptive Parent Bias (i.e., tended to judge the boy to \nresemble his adoptive father on most traits), and Mixed. Table 6 shows the distribution of patterns. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 6 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nUnlike the majority of adults in Study 1, only 13% of children showed a Differentiated \nunderstanding of the inter-generational transmission of properties. As a group, children did not \ndifferentiate between bodily traits and beliefs or skills in their resemblance judgments. On average, \nthey judged the adopted boy to resemble his birth parent 58% of the time on bodily traits, 49% of \nthe time on beliefs, and 50% of the time on skills (see Table 7). Moreover, regardless of whether \nthey were able to differentiate their judgments by property types, children showed no evidence of \nunderstanding that an individual\u2019s bodily traits are inherited from the birth parents: Even those \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n75\n  \nchildren who were first asked to make resemblance judgments on bodily traits, and therefore could \nnot have been confused or influenced by the other questions about beliefs, judged that the boy \nwould resemble his birth father on bodily traits only 53% of the time. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 7 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe lack of differentiation shown by children as a group does not indicate that children \nindividually were necessarily responding randomly in their resemblance judgments. Although the \n40% of children who showed a Mixed pattern may have been doing so, the 13% who showed a \nDifferentiated pattern should be credited with a biological understanding of family resemblance. A \nsecond-order application of the binomial theorem, based on a probability of .04 that a participant \nwould show a Differentiated pattern by chance, indicates that the 5 children who showed this \npattern is significantly more than would be expected by chance (p < .05). Furthermore, it is clear \nthat the 30% of children who showed a Birth Parent Bias, and the 18% who showed an Adoptive \nParent Bias were not responding randomly. What is less clear is just why the children with biased \npatterns responded as they did. It might be that they were reasoning causally about birth (in the case \nof those showing a Birth Parent Bias) or nurture (in the case of those showing an Adoptive Parent \nBias) as the mediating mechanism for the transmission of all properties, bodily as well as behavioral \nand mental. However, as noted by Solomon et al. (1996), it is also possible that the children who \nshowed Birth or Adoptive Parent Bias patterns were drawing instead on the simple noncausal \nknowledge that offspring tend to resemble parents, as well as on an idiosyncratic sense that one of \nthe two parents in the story (whether birth or adoptive) was the boy\u2019s \u201creal\u201d father. We will return \nto this possibility in the discussion of the children\u2019s justifications.  \nVezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n76\n  \nParticipants\u2019 responses on the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany tasks were characterized \naccording to the same criteria for Differentiated pattern, Birth Parent Bias, Adoptive Parent Bias, \nand Mixed pattern that had been used in Study 1. As on the Vezo-Vezo task, few children showed \nan adult-like Differentiated pattern, none of those in the Vezo-Masikoro task and only 15% of those \nin the Vezo-Karany task. A glance at the overall distribution of children across the various \njudgment patterns (see Table 6) and at the mean percentages of birth parent resemblance judgments \n(see Table 7) indicates that the children performed on the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany tasks \nroughly as they had on the Vezo-Vezo task. The Birth Parent Bias pattern was shown by 40% of the \nchildren in the Vezo-Masikoro task and by 20% in the Vezo-Karany task; the Adoptive Parent Bias \npattern was shown by 10% of the children in the Vezo-Masikoro task and by 25% of those in the \nVezo-Karany task; and the Mixed pattern was shown by 50% of the children in the Vezo-Masikoro \ntask and by 40% of those in the Vezo-Karany task.  \nThe similarity of children\u2019s performance across the three scenarios (Vezo-Vezo, Vezo-\nMasikoro, and Vezo-Karany) is also borne out by a 2x2x3 repeated-measures ANOVA examining \nthe effects of adoption type (within-group vs. across-groups), across-group scenario (Vezo-\nMasikoro vs. Vezo-Karany), and trait type (bodily traits vs. beliefs vs. skills) on the percentage of \nbirth parent resemblance judgments. As with the adults, there were no main effects or interactions \ninvolving scenario, indicating that Vezo children did not alter their judgments according to whether \nthe adoption contrasted Vezo with Vezo, Vezo with Masikoro, or Vezo with Karany. This is \nreflected in the similarity of the mean percentage of birth parent judgments made by children \noverall across the tasks, as shown in Table 7. Moreover, unlike the adults, there was no significant \nmain effect for trait, F(2, 76) = 2.96, p < .10, eta = .26. That the effect size is small (Hair, Anderson, \nTatham, & Black, 1998) is consistent with there being a minority of the children differentiating \namong traits. Over all children, the proportion of judgments that the boy would resemble his birth \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n77\n  \nfather on any given trait-type (bodily traits, beliefs, skills) did not differ significantly from the \nchance level of 50%. \nJustifications \nDespite the fact that children were explicitly asked to justify their resemblance judgments, \nthey gave fewer justifications than did the adult participants. Whereas the pool of 31 adults \nproduced a total of 108 justifications of judgments on group-neutral properties, the 40 children only \nproduced 58, for an average of a little over 1 justification per child. Moreover, only 60% of children \ngave any justifications at all, whereas 94% of adults spontaneously offered at least one justification. \nThe justifications were coded according to the same criteria used in Study 1 (see Table 4). \nTwo experimenters coded the English translation of the justifications with 89% reliability; as in \nStudy 1, the first author resolved disagreements by consulting the Malagasy original. Nurture \njustifications accounted for 27% of all justifications, Origins accounted for 2%, and Spiritual \nConnection accounted for 3%. The Generated, Like Birth Parent, Raised, and Like Adoptive Parent \njustifications, arguably no more than restatements of the resemblance judgment, accounted for fully \n49% of the total, appeals to Truth\/Desirability accounted for 16%, and the uninterpretable Other \naccounted for the remaining 3% of justifications. This means that only 32% of children\u2019s \njustifications spelt out a clear causal mechanism for the transmission of an individual\u2019s properties \n(i.e., Nurture, Origins, Spiritual Connection, or Individual Intrinsic). Only 29% of children who \never gave a justification produced at least one that spelt out a causal mechanism, as compared to \n90% of adults. This result suggests that the majority of Vezo children may not have reasoned \ncausally about the resemblance between the child and his parent. \nNonetheless, children did give justifications in a manner that is consistent with the reasoning \nimplicit in their resemblance judgment. That is, all of the Origins, Generated, and Like Birth Father \njustifications were offered only to explain judgments that the boy would resemble his birth father on \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n78\n  \nthe property under consideration. Similarly, 97% of the Nurture, Raised, and Like Adoptive Father \njustifications were offered to explain judgments that the boy would resemble his adoptive father on \nthat property. This basic finding suggests that children had engaged the task and were not simply \noverwhelmed by the procedure. Their undifferentiated answers cannot be passed off as the result of \nthe demand characteristics of the task. Rather, children's answers are diagnostic of their lack of \nunderstanding of the difference between the biological process of inheritance and social processes \nof transmission such as learning and imitation.   \nChildren\u2019s Nurture justifications are of particular theoretical interest because they invoke at \nleast one of the causal mechanisms targeted by the adoption task (there were virtually no Origins \njustifications). Though children produced Nurture justifications almost categorically to explain \nresemblance to the adoptive father, it is notable that only the children who had shown a \nDifferentiated pattern restricted their use of Nurture justifications to support a judgment about \nbeliefs or skills. Other children, by contrast, extended Nurture justifications to explain their \njudgments about bodily traits. For example, one 10 year old girl explained that the boy would have \nlongish and narrow feet like his adoptive father \u201cbecause the boy lives with him, with the one who \nraises him\u201d, and a 12-year-old boy argued that the boy would have pointed ears like the adoptive \nfather \u201cbecause he will follow his father\u2019s way of thinking\u201d. It would appear that these children \nhave yet to distinguish properties of the person that are affected by living, eating, and thinking \ntogether from those that are not. \nWe suggest that those children who lack a causal understanding of the mechanisms of \nnurture and biological inheritance are likely to be swayed by the implicit emotional dimension of \nseemingly simple questions about the resemblance of children to parents. Just how it is that they are \nswayed and how it is that they interpret the story is likely to depend more on their personal \ncircumstances than on causal reasoning about either the mechanism of birth or nurture. For \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n79\n  \nexample, one girl, aged 13, showed a Birth Parent Bias in both the Vezo-Vezo and Vezo-Masikoro \nscenarios. She gave birth judgments on every property of the adopted child, and she asserted that \neven if the birth father had died when the baby was very small, the boy would nonetheless be like \nhim in all ways. A few weeks later, the researcher discovered an explanation for this girl\u2019s staunch \nBirth Parent Bias when, during the funeral of one of the girl\u2019s paternal uncles, it became apparent \nthat the girl\u2019s own father had died the previous year and that she had been adopted by her father\u2019s \nyoungest brother. As the girl approached the cemetery for the first time after she had gone to bury \nher father, she burst out crying. As the researcher witnessed her intense pain and tried to console \nher, she realized that perhaps the reason the girl had refused to give in to the idea that nurture is \nmore powerful than procreation in shaping people\u2019s beliefs, skills and livelihood had a lot to do \nwith her own predicament and loss, and her intense desire to be like the father she had lost. \nConclusions\nThe present finding that most 6- to 13-year-old Vezo children do not yet understand that the \nbiological process of reproduction is implicated in the transmission of bodily properties from \nparents to their offspring runs counter to the prediction of the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis \nthat an understanding of biological inheritance ought to be in evidence in early childhood, \nirrespective of widely different input conditions.  \nOur results confirm those of Bloch et al. (2001) with the Zafiminary. Nonetheless, our \nfindings on Vezo children diverge from those on Zafimaniry children in one notable regard. The \nAdoptive Parent Bias pattern was the modal judgment pattern among Zafimaniry children (shown \nby 57% of 6- to 10-year-olds and by 45% of 11- to 15-year-olds), whereas only between 10% and \n25% of Vezo children across the three scenarios (Vezo-Vezo, Vezo-Masikoro, Vezo-Karany) \nproduced Adoptive Parent Bias patterns. Indeed, Birth Parent Bias patterns were more frequent \n(between 20% and 40% across the three scenarios). It is conceivable that subtle differences in the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n80\n  \ncultural milieu in which Zafimaniry and Vezo children grow up make the adoptive family more \nsalient among the Zafimaniry. However, due to the small sample size in the Zafimaniry study, and \nthe fact that the materials in that study were not counterbalanced, this aspect of the Zafimaniry \nresults may not be robust. \n Despite the overall convergence of our data with those from studies with  \nZafimaniry children (Bloch et al., 2001), Tamil children (Mahalingham, 1998) and European and \nNorth American children (e.g., Gimenez & Harris, 2002; Solomon et al., 1996; Springer, 1996; \nSpringer & Keil, 1989; Williams & Affleck, 1999) in showing that an understanding of biological \ninheritance takes time to develop, there is considerable divergence in the age at which Vezo, \nZafimaniry, Tamil, European and North American children succeed in exhibiting a differentiated \npattern of reasoning. Most strikingly, whereas European and North American children succeed by \nthe age of 6 or 7, it takes Vezo children another 6 or 7 years to do so (see Study 3). We explore \nbelow some reasons as to why this might be the case, but first we turn to the children\u2019s group \nidentity judgments on the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany adoption scenarios and to their \nreasoning about group-typical properties. \nFolksociology:  Group Identity Judgments and Resemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits \nGroup Identity Judgments \nMost of the children in the Vezo-Masikoro task judged that the adopted boy would have the \nsame group identity as his adoptive parent, and the proportion of children who did so (65%) was not \nsignificantly less than that of the adults (87%). Most Vezo children, therefore, made judgments \nabout the acquisition of group identity that are in accord with the explicit statements that they hear \nabout how Vezo and Masikoro identities are acquired. A boy born to Masikoro parents, but raised \nby Vezo parents, will grow up to be Vezo, and vice versa. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n81\n  \nIn a striking result, children performed very differently when they were asked to reason \nabout the adoption between Vezo and Karany, a scenario they are unlikely to have ever heard \ndiscussed explicitly. A majority (73%) judged that the boy would have the group identity of his \nbirth parents. The children who took part in the Vezo-Karany task were significantly more likely to \nmake such a birth parent judgment about group identity than were those who took part in the Vezo-\nMasikoro task, X2(1) = 5.66, p < .02. Furthermore, the number of children in the Vezo-Karany task \nwho made birth parent group identity judgments is significantly more than that of adults, X2(1) = \n9.11, p < .005, who did not differ significantly in their judgments on group identity in the two tasks \n(see Figure 3). When presented with an adoption scenario for which they had no ready-made \nanswers, children, unlike adults, would appear to have been unable to extend the causal reasoning \nthat is implicit in what they know about Vezo and Masikoro group identities to their reasoning \nabout Vezo and Karany identities. This finding calls into question just how deeply children in the \nVezo-Masikoro task had understood the causal principles underlying their adult-like judgments. It \nwould appear that instead of deploying the notion that people\u2019s group identity is determined by and \nis contingent on what they do, children reverted to an alternative mode of reasoning, judging that \nVezo and Karany people are born what they are, and that their identity is impervious to change. \nThis finding undermines the Unconstrained Learning hypothesis, while it is compatible with the \nsuggestion that the later construction of the adult performative theory of identity requires the \noverturning of children\u2019s early predisposition to naturalize human kinds. \nAn analysis of the relation between group identity judgments on the one hand, and patterns \nof resemblance judgments on group neutral traits on the other, confirms that children in the Vezo-\nKarany task reasoned about group identity quite differently from the children in the Vezo-Masikoro \ntask. Interestingly, this difference was not dependent on how children reasoned about the \ntransmission of other properties of the person, as shown by the fact that children in the Vezo-\n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n82\n  \nKarany task were not more likely to show Birth Parent Biases and children in the Vezo-Masikoro \ntask were not more likely to show Adoptive Parent Biases (see Table 6). One might have expected \nthe group identity judgments of those children who showed either bias to be driven by their overall \npreference for either adoptive or birth parent. This, however, is true only for the minority of \nchildren who, in the Vezo-Karany task, judged that the adoptive boy would have the same group \nidentity as his adoptive father (80% of these children showed a congruent Adoptive Parent bias), \nand for the minority of children who, in the Vezo-Masikoro task, judged that the adoptive boy \nwould have the same group identity as his birth father (71% of these children showed a congruent \nBirth Parent Bias). By contrast, as many as 71% of the children who gave a birth judgment on group \nidentity in the Vezo-Karany task had not shown a congruent Birth Parent Bias, and as many as 85% \nof the children who gave an adoptive judgment on group identity in the Vezo-Masikoro task had not \nshown a congruent Adoptive Parent Bias. This finding suggests that the reasoning of these children \nwas guided by specific knowledge and intuitions about the nature of group identity, rather than \nreflecting a generic Birth or Adoptive Parent Bias. Thus, as a group, children took Vezo identity \n(relative to Masikoro) to be determined by where one grows up, but Vezo identity (relative to \nKarany) to be determined by one\u2019s birth origins. An examination of children\u2019s justifications as well \nas their judgments concerning group-typical traits will provide evidence concerning how deeply the \nchildren understand these two alternative ways of acquiring group identity. \nResemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits \nAs in Study 1, participants were asked to judge whether the adoptive boy would resemble \nthe birth or the adoptive father on a number of properties that Vezo adults regard as typical of Vezo, \nMasikoro or Karany people. Of course, whether Vezo children regard such properties as typical of a \ncertain group is an open question. Astuti\u2019s ethnographic experience indicated that children knew \nthat certain skills (and the traces that such skills leave on the body, such as scars from the fishing \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n83\n  \nline) are typical of Vezo, Masikoro and Karany people. Furthermore, in explicit testing, we found \nthat most children did know that certain practices, customs and beliefs were typical of each targeted \ngroup (78% of the children correctly judged the typicality of the Vezo, Karany, or Masikoro \nfunerary practices, 65% recognized the typicality of the Vezo or Masikoro marriage practices, and \n75% recognized the typicality of the Vezo or Karany beliefs about fasting).  \nUnlike adults, who were categorical in judging that, except for the inborn group-typical \ntraits (skin color and hair type), the adopted boy would resemble his adoptive father on all group-\ntypical properties, children\u2019s judgments on all of these properties were not different from chance \n(see Figure 2). Collapsing across the two across-group tasks, children on average judged that the \nboy would resemble his birth father 60% of the time on group-typical acquired bodily traits, 60% of \nthe time on group-typical beliefs, and 51% of the time on group-typical skills. In the Vezo-Karany \ntask, children gave birth parent judgments on inborn group-typical traits 68% of the time. The fact \nthat the mean percentage for inborn group-typical traits is also not different from chance is \nparticularly important, in view of Hirschfeld\u2019s specific claim that children, even 3- and 4-year-olds, \nunderstand that racial traits are fixed at birth (Hirschfeld, 1996; but see Solomon, 2002), which he \ninterprets as lending support to the \u201ccontention that the understanding of the role of birth in \ninheritance is part of young children\u2019s na\u00efve biology\u201d (Hirschfeld, 1996, p.109). Our data do not \nsupport that claim.  \nNonetheless, the children (14 out of 20) in the Vezo-Karany task who judged the adopted \nboy to have the group identity of his birth father also judged 86% of the time that he would have the \nsame inborn group-typical traits (i.e., skin color and hair type) as his birth father, significantly more \noften than one would expect by chance, t(13)=3.68, p <.002. This suggests that those children who \nreasoned that Vezo and Karany identities are \u201cnatural\u201d \u2013 that is, that they are acquired as a \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n84\n  \nconsequence of one\u2019s birth origins were also inclined to naturalize the somatic markers that \ndistinguish Vezo from Karany people. \nAcross all the children, there was no significant difference between those who participated \nin the Vezo-Masikoro task and those who participated in the Vezo-Karany task in their judgments \nof acquired group-typical properties. A 2x3 repeated-measures ANOVA, with the between-subjects \nfactor of task (Vezo-Masikoro vs. Vezo-Karany) and the within-subjects factor of group-typical trait \ntype (acquired bodily traits, beliefs, and skills) showed no significant main effects or interactions. \nMoreover, all etas were less than.20, indicating that the effect sizes, in and of themselves, were too \nsmall to warrant further testing with a larger sample (Hair et al., 1998). Recall that the majority of \nchildren in the Vezo-Masikoro task, when asked about the adopted boy\u2019s group identity, gave \nadoptive parent judgments, whereas the majority of children in the Vezo-Karany task gave birth \nparent judgments. It is surprising that the two groups of children did not differ in their attributions \nof group-typical properties to the adopted child.  \nThe above result raises the question of how much Vezo children, even those who gave \ncorrect adult-like answers to the question about group identity, understand of the adult testimony \nabout the performative nature of group identity. According to the adult theory, it is because one has \nacquired properties that are typical of a group that one can be said to be of that group; none of the \nadults in Study 1 who judged that the adopted boy would belong to the group of his adoptive father \never judged that he would resemble his birth father in any of the group-typical properties. By \ncontrast, only 2 (15%) of the 13 children who gave adoptive judgments on the boy\u2019s group identity \ngave adoptive judgments on all group-typical properties (and of these, 1 showed an overall \nAdoptive Parent Bias pattern). Strikingly, the other 11 children who gave adoptive parent judgments \non group identity gave birth parent resemblance judgments for group-typical traits 61% of the time.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n85\n  \nThis lack of fit between children\u2019s adoptive judgments on group identity and their judgments \non group-typical properties should not be taken as an indication that they do not know which traits \nare typical of Vezo and Masikoro people. Apart from the typicality ratings mentioned above, we can \nreport one anecdotal piece of evidence. During Astuti\u2019s fieldwork, a group of children gathered \naround her son\u2019s colored felt pens and started to draw pictures. As is often the case when children \nhave a chance to draw (e.g., by tracing pictures in the sand), they drew outrigger canoes, fish, palm \ntrees, and sea turtles. When Astuti asked them why they were drawing these things, they replied: \n\u201cbecause we are Vezo\u201d; and when she asked what they thought Masikoro children would draw, they \nanswered: \u201ccattle, spades and corn fields\u201d. This much they clearly know. They also can recite that \npeople are Vezo because they have (and draw) outrigger canoes, eat fish and hunt sea turtles, while \npeople are Masikoro because they have (and draw) cattle, they carry spades and grow corn. This \nway of reasoning is made available to \u2013 one could perhaps even say that it is inculcated in \u2013 Vezo \nchildren in a number of ways. For example, children often hear adult conversations about some \npeople whose customs really prove that they are Vezo or Masikoro (for example, during funerals), \nor whose exceptional skills at sea have shown them to be \u201cvery Vezo\u201d. They also hear discussions \nabout the transformation of specific individuals into Vezo or Masikoro. But above all, there are \nnumerous occasions when children are directly told that they are Vezo or Masikoro because of what \nthey do or fail to do. Thus, if children are taken out on a canoe journey and they are sick, they are \nteased and humiliated by being told that they are Masikoro; if instead they successfully catch fish or \nmanage to sell their catch at the market, they are praised that they are becoming Vezo or, even, that \nthey are \u201cvery Vezo\u201d (see Astuti, 1995a, for more details). \nIt seems likely that the reason children performed inconsistently in our Vezo-Masikoro task \nis not that they do not know how to use group membership to predict group-relevant properties (X is \nVezo and therefore X knows how to sail), but that they failed to reason causally about the specific \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n86\n  \nmechanism (nurture) that transmits such group-typical properties. Note that participants were asked \nto stipulate whether the adopted child would be Vezo or Masikoro only at the end of the task. As a \nresult, for each resemblance question on group-typical traits, they had to identify the causal \nmechanism responsible for the transmission of such traits, rather than automatically relying on \ngroup membership to guide their judgments. And children failed to reason that group-typical \nproperties are transmitted through learning, practice and habituation, unlike adults, who did so \ncategorically. \nJustifications \nVezo-Masikoro task.  Ninety percent of the children in the Vezo-Masikoro task justified \ntheir group-identity judgments. Of the 13 children who judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo \nor Masikoro like his adoptive father, 12 gave justifications that were consistent with their adoptive \njudgment (one child remained silent): 42% were coded as Environment justifications; 42% were \ncoded as Raised or Like Adoptive Father justifications, 8% as Occupation justifications, and the \nremaining 8% were coded as Other (see Table 5 for coding criteria).  \nAt first glance, the finding that 92% of these children\u2019s justifications for group identity \njudgments invoke processes that are at least consistent with the Vezo adult performative theory (i.e., \nEnvironment, Raised, Like Adoptive Father, and Occupation) might be taken as evidence that a \nmajority of the children in our sample have in fact mastered that adult theory. However, the striking \ndiscrepancy between children\u2019s adult-like justifications for their group identity judgments and their \njudgments about group-typical properties weighs against our drawing such a conclusion. By way of \nillustration, consider the case of a child who judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo like his \nadoptive father because the boy grew up in a Vezo village on the coast, but who at the same time \njudged that the boy would know how to cultivate rice and ride ox-driven carts like his Masikoro \nbirth father.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n87\n  \nDespite such incoherent answers, there is no doubt that the children who gave adoptive \ngroup identity judgments have learnt something specific about the nature of Vezo and Masikoro \nidentities. Most likely, what children learn first is the simple association between living on the coast \nand being Vezo, and between living in the interior and being Masikoro. Thus, when answering our \ngroup-identity questions, children were able to use the boy\u2019s place of residence as a clue to his \ngroup identity, and to produce adult-like Environment justifications. Nonetheless, their inconsistent \njudgments on group-typical properties reveal that they were still far from understanding the chain of \ncausal mechanisms that underlies the adult theory: that the place where one lives determines the \nactivities that one performs, the beliefs and customs that one adopts, the skills that one masters, and \nthat these activities, beliefs, customs and skills determine the kind of person that one is; or, in \nreverse order, that one is the kind of person that one is because of one\u2019s activities, beliefs, customs \nand skills, which are determined by the place where one lives. In the absence of such causal \nunderstanding, the children who participated in our task were clearly untroubled by, or unaware of, \nthe inconsistencies in their answers. \nWe now turn to the 35% of children who judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo or \nMasikoro like his birth father.  Of these 7 children, 6 (86%) offered a justification for their group \nidentity judgments: 2 (33%) gave Like Birth Father or Origins justifications and the other 4 (67%) \ngave Occupation justifications (e.g., the boy is Vezo like his birth father because he knows how to \nsail). Although small in number, these latter justifications are still quite telling because of their \ninconsistency: They invoke a property that is acquired through learning and practice to justify a \ngroup identity that is attributed to birth origins. We speculate that the reason for such unusual \nperformance is that these children first judged that the boy would be Vezo or Masikoro like his birth \nfather and that, when asked to justify their judgment, they automatically fell back on the standard \nstock explanation, which they have heard so many times, that people are Vezo or Masikoro because \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n88\n  \nof what they do and where they live  \u2013 the sort of explanation that is \u2018in the air\u2019. In other words, \nthey were repeating what they hear, without fully understanding what they say.  \nThe important conclusion to be drawn from our reading of the justifications is that the \nchildren who participated in the Vezo-Masikoro task had learned to mimic key aspects of the adult \nperformative theory of identity. On the one hand, most of the children were able to answer correctly \nthe question about the group identity of someone who is raised on the coast or in the interior, and \nthey could produce appropriate justifications. A minority of children, on the other hand, had yet to \nlearn to produce the correct answers, but had begun to assimilate the way in which adults justify \ntheir way of classifying people into groups. The result is a curious mismatch between (birth) \njudgments and (nurture) justifications. Thus, although in the Vezo-Masikoro task the percentage of \nchildren\u2019s adoptive judgments about the adopted boy\u2019s group identity was not significantly different \nfrom that of adults, children\u2019s grasp of the adult theory about people\u2019s group identity would appear \nto be very shallow indeed. \nVezo-Karany task. In our analysis so far, we have suggested that the adoptive judgments on \ngroup identity given by the majority of participants in the Vezo-Masikoro task resulted from the \ntestimony children receive from their parents and elders, and that the inconsistency characteristic of \nchildren\u2019s performance is due to their limited understanding of that testimony. The prediction that \nfollows from this suggestion is that Vezo children might reason differently, and perhaps more \ncoherently, in the absence of any direct adult guidance. The prediction is borne out by the results of \nthe Vezo-Karany task in which a majority of children judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo or \nKarany like his birth father. As mentioned in the Introduction, Vezo villagers are familiar with the \nKarany as they buy goods from the Karany shops, sell them fish at the market, and occasionally see \nwhole Karany families taking leisurely walks on the village beach in their best clothes and \nexpensive jewelry. Children have plenty of occasions to observe all of these interactions. However, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n89\n  \nthe possibility that a Karany might become Vezo or that a Vezo might become Karany is never \ndiscussed. This means that children in the Vezo-Karany task had to figure out the answer to our \ngroup identity question on their own accord. \nOf the 14 children in the Vezo-Karany task who judged that the boy would have the group \nidentity of this birth father, 12 gave justifications: Origins justifications accounted for 42% of these, \nLike Birth Father accounted for 25%, and Occupation accounted for the remaining 33%. Most \nremarkable was that the children who offered Origins justifications were unusually explicit and \nresourceful in their attempts to describe the mechanism they considered responsible for the fixation \nof the boy\u2019s group identity. For example, a ten-year-old girl explained that the boy was going to be \nKarany \u201cbecause he is Karany on his father\u2019s side, he came from the tummy of his [father\u2019s] wife, \nhe is white, and he is Karany\u201d, while a thirteen-year-old boy asserted that the boy would be Vezo \n\u201cbecause he carries the line of descent of the father who generated him\u201d. Two girls (nine- and \nthirteen years old) found an alternative way to express the nature of the connection between the \nadopted boy and his birth father by stating that the boy will be Karany like his birth father because \nhis mother is Karany. These children seem to be guided by the strong intuition that if a child is born \nto Karany or Vezo parents he will be Karany or Vezo no matter where he is raised, and they were \nable to link their intuition to the mechanics of birth and procreation.  \nAs in the Vezo-Masikoro task, some of the children who judged the adopted boy to have the \ngroup identity of his birth father gave justifications that implied that the adopted boy would learn \nthe occupational skills of his dead birth father. The inconsistency of such justifications suggests that \nin searching for an explanation for their birth judgments on group identity these children, like the \nones in the Vezo-Masikoro task, fell back on the standard explanatory mode they hear applied to \nVezo and Masikoro people. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n90\n  \nOnly 5 children in the Vezo-Karany task reasoned that the adopted boy would have the same \ngroup identity as his adoptive father (one child judged that the boy would be both Vezo and Karany) \nand only 3 of them justified their judgments: One was coded as Upbringing and two were coded as \nLike Adoptive Father. As noted earlier, all but one of the children who made an adoptive parent \ngroup identity judgment also showed an Adoptive Parent Bias on group neutral traits. There is thus \nno evidence that their judgments on the child\u2019s group identity were the result of a dedicated theory \nabout social categorization, since they judged the boy to resemble his adoptive father on all \nproperties, including somatic traits such as skin color and nose shape. \nDiscussion \n Study 2 had three goals. First we sought evidence concerning Vezo children\u2019s understanding \nof biological inheritance, as this bears on the prediction made by the Innate Conceptual Constraints \nhypothesis that such an understanding emerges early in development, irrespective of input \nconditions. Second, we sought evidence that bears on Hirschfeld\u2019s hypothesized Human Kind \nCompetence. We asked: How do Vezo children approach the task of learning and reproducing the \nadult performative theory of identity? Might they not, as suggested by Hirschfeld, naturalize human \ngroup identity, believing it to be inherited from birth parents? And might they not essentialize it, \nderiving from it predictions about a person\u2019s properties? Third, we explored the relation between \nchildren\u2019s understanding of the mechanisms for the transmission of an individual\u2019s traits (both \nbiological inheritance and learning\/socialization) and their construal of group identity.  \nThe first finding of Study 2 is that Vezo children between the age of 6 and 13 years do not \nunderstand the biological mechanism through which an individual\u2019s bodily traits (as opposed to \nother traits, such as beliefs) are transmitted from parents to offspring. Our results replicate the \nfindings of Bloch et al. (2001) and of Mahalingham (1998) regarding Zafimaniry and Tamil \nchildren respectively. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that in a variety of different cultural \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n91\n  \ncontexts children have yet to construct a concept of biological inheritance even by age 13 years. \nThis finding undermines the claim that universally children as young as 4 or 5 years of age have a \nbiological understanding of family resemblance, and is a challenge to the hypothesis that innate \nconceptual representations guide the constructions of intuitive concepts of birth parentage and \nbiological inheritance.  \nAn obvious question raised by these cross-cultural data is why, by comparison with children \nin urban India and in rural Madagascar, children in North America and Europe come to an \nunderstanding of biological inheritance many years earlier (by age 6 or 7 years, see Gimenez & \nHarris, 2002; Solomon & Johnson, 2000; Solomon et al., 1996; Springer, 1996; Springer & Keil, \n1989; Williams & Affleck, 1999).  Here we can only address the differences between North \nAmerican and Vezo children. \nThere are a number of possible reasons why it takes Vezo children longer than it takes urban \nmiddle-class North American children to develop the concept of biological inheritance. One is that \nthe testimony they receive from their parents and elders explicitly conflates the distinction between \nthe biological mechanism of reproduction and the social mechanism of nurture, as when Vezo \nadults assert that a baby\u2019s physical features depend on what kind of people (e.g., light skinned, \nshort, plump) her mother befriended or disliked when she was pregnant (see Introduction). Contrast \nthis with the testimony received by North American children, whose parents routinely comment on \nthe fact that such and such a baby got her big eyes from her father and her blond hair from her \nmother. True, this testimony alone does not provide North American children with the \nunderstanding of biological inheritance, but it is at least consistent with it, contrary to the testimony \nreceived by Vezo children. Another likely reason is that Vezo children are virtually unschooled and \nthat, unlike North American (middle-class) children, they are not encouraged by either teachers or \nparents to engage in the kind of explicit, analytic reasoning that is needed to engage in theory \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n92\n  \nbuilding (see Cole & Scribner, 1974, for a classic illustration of the effects of schooling on \nconceptual development). As reported earlier (see also Astuti, 2000b), Vezo adults are adamant that \ntheir children \u201cdon\u2019t know anything at all\u201d, that they \u201cunderstand nothing\u201d, and that they \u201clack \nwisdom\u201d. For this reason, adults nurture and love their children, but they do not engage them in \nreasoning, while actively discouraging them from asking inquisitive questions (since adults consider \nchildren\u2019s question as pointless for their opinions, as we did with our tasks). This way of \napprehending children\u2019s cognitive capacities came to the fore as a result of Astuti\u2019s son\u2019s presence \nin the village. Confronted with a radically new way of life, Sean, aged 4 and a half years, was \n\u201cnaturally\u201d inclined to ask his mother a million questions a day about why women carried buckets \nof water on their head and men did not, why small children were allowed to use dangerous \nimplements such a machetes and knives and he was not, why people allowed pigs to soil the village \nsand instead of keeping them inside their pens, and so on and so forth. On hearing him ask \u201cwhy?\u201d \nso many times a day, people were quick to nickname him \u201cPerch\u00e8?\u201d (Italian for \u201cwhy?\u201d). When \nAstuti explained what her son\u2019s new name meant, adults marvelled at the fact that such a small \nchild could ask so many questions, and they concluded that the reason he was so clever was that he \nwas so inquisitive. Astuti pointed out that the reason \u201cPerch\u00e8?\u201d asked \u201cperch\u00e8?\u201d so often was that \nhe got an answer from his mother every time he did so. But none of her interlocutors seemed willing \nto pick up on her hint (see Levine et al., 1994, for similar findings among the Gusii of Kenya). \nIf these considerations go some way towards explaining the difference in the age at which \nNorth American and Vezo children succeed at our task, one might use such considerations to argue \nthat our task simply defeated Vezo children because they are unschooled and because they are not \nused to being engaged in analytic reasoning. After all, one might argue, their responses to our \nresemblance questions were mostly random. We disagree. We do not believe that it was the form of \nthe task itself that defeated the children, but the content of the questions. Despite the unusual \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n93\n  \nsetting, the children were engaged in the task, passed memory probes for the story, and justified \ntheir judgments relatively consistently (although usually quite emptily). Moreover, although the \ngroup means for each trait did not differ from chance, individual children\u2019s judgment patterns were \ndecidedly non-random. The Differentiated pattern, Adoptive Parent and Birth Parent Bias patterns \nall occurred more than would be expected by chance. Most importantly, children\u2019s judgments on \nVezo, Masikoro, and Karany group identity were systematically non-random, despite the fact that \nthese questions came at the end of the task \u2013 in other words, the children were still with us. Finally, \nwe report below children\u2019s success on a species version of the same adoption task in which they \nface the same task demands (Study 4).  \nWe conclude that children\u2019s incoherent responses in Study 2 reflect the lack of an integrated \nunderstanding of the mechanisms through which an individual\u2019s traits are transmitted, an \nunderstanding which, against cultural odds, gets constructed by adulthood (see Study 1). Given that \nchildren have not constructed this understanding, and adults have, adolescence must be the \ntransitional age. Study 3 provides a detailed analysis of the intermediate steps that children take to \nconstruct a fully differentiated understanding of biological inheritance and socially-mediated \nlearning. \nStudy 2 also addressed the question of how Vezo children come to understand and \nreproduce their parents\u2019 performative theory of group identity. The study yielded two important \nresults, which directly bear on Hirschfeld\u2019s Human Kind Competence hypothesis. First, Vezo \nchildren did not naturalize all human kind distinctions \u2013 they did not judge that Vezo and Masikoro \ngroup identities are fixed at birth. This is not entirely surprising, given that Vezo adults do not \nnaturalize Vezo and Masikoro group identities either, and that they provide children with a vast \namount of very explicit testimony to this effect. Indeed, in view of how much input children get, \nwhat is surprising is that their responses in the Vezo-Masikoro task were not more robust and \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n94\n  \ncoherent. This  is consistent with Hirschfeld\u2019s hypothesis that the human mind is predisposed to \nnaturalize human kinds, for this would make the Vezo performative theory of identity somewhat \n\u201cunnatural\u201d and hard to grasp. At any rate, another striking finding emerged from the Vezo-\nMasikoro task: Despite their adult-like answers about group identity, children did not understand \nwhy living on the coast makes one Vezo, or why living inland makes one Masikoro, as shown by \nthe incoherence of their judgments on group typical traits and by some of their justifications. This is \nan indication that the constructive process children go through in mastering the adult performative \ntheory of identity is not remotely complete by age 13. \nThe second and most important result concerning the development of intuitive concepts of \nhuman kinds emerged from the Vezo-Karany task. Unlike the majority of adults, who extended the \nperformative theory of group identity to their reasoning about the Karany, the majority of children \nreasoned that people are Vezo or Karany because of their birth origins. These data are important for \ntwo reasons. First, they confirm that children have an immature and superficial understanding of the \nadult theory; what they do know \u2013 that Vezo people live on the coast; that Masikoro people live in \nthe interior; that Karany people live in towns \u2013 is not enough to grasp the general principle that \npeople\u2019s identity is determined by what they do, by the beliefs they hold, by the customs they \npractice, and to extend it to the novel case of the Karany. Second, they show that children have \naccess to an alternative, coherent theory: that people are born the kind of people that they are. These \ndata are exactly what one would expect on Hirschfeld\u2019s Human Kind Competence hypothesis, and \nthey suggest that some understanding of innate potential \u2013 with respect to human kinds as opposed \nto individual traits \u2013 develops early, even when it is not scaffolded by adult cultural beliefs and \npractices. \nOur data are also interpretable in terms of Atran\u2019s hypothesis that human kinds get \nconstrued by analogy to species kinds. As Atran (1990) suggests, the analogy to species kind might \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n95\n  \nbe triggered by the kind of striking somatic differences that exist between Vezo and Karany people.  \nConsistent with this is the finding that those children who judged that the adopted child would have \nthe group identity of his birth father also judged that the child would have the same skin color and \nhair type as the birth father \u2013 the only children other than the few who showed a Differentiated \npattern on group neutral traits not to be at chance on these judgments. We will return to these \ncompeting hypotheses in Study 4, which explores Vezo children\u2019s reasoning about species kind, and \nin the General Discussion. What seems clear at this stage is that the Unconstrained Learning \nhypothesis, which predicts that children acquire adult knowledge through a steady and incremental \nprocess of internalization, cannot account for how Vezo children come to understand who they are.  \n Finally, our results indicate that a differentiated understanding of the mechanisms of \nbiological inheritance and cultural transmission is not necessary for naturalizing group identity. \nHowever, this lack of differentiation may be implicated in children\u2019s failure to understand the adult \nperformative theory of group identity. We explore this possibility in Study 3 by examining the \ntransitional age between childhood and adulthood: adolescence. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n96\n  \nChapter IV \nSTUDY 3. ADOLESCENTS: FAMILY RESEMBLANCE AND GROUP IDENTITY \n \nStudy 1 showed that Vezo adults differentiate between two distinct causal processes of trait \nacquisition: a process of biological inheritance from birth parents, and a process of socially \nmediated learning. Study 2 showed that up until the age of 13, the majority of Vezo children have \nnot yet constructed this differentiated understanding. Study 3 examines Vezo adolescents. \nLogically, the target concepts that support the adult understanding must emerge during the years \nbetween 13 (when they are largely absent) and 21 (when they are universally present). Study 3 will \nallow us to explore some of the details of the constructive process \u2013 which aspects of the adult \nconceptual system emerge first, and how the various components are interrelated in development. \nStudies 1 and 2 further showed that the Vezo performative theory of group identity is also \nthe result of a constructive process, and that by age 13 most children have not remotely mastered it. \nAgain, the relevant concepts must emerge during adolescence. Study 3 will allow us to establish \nwhether the intuitions that led Vezo children to naturalize group identity in the context of the Vezo-\nKarany adoption task still hold sway in adolescence. It also allows us to test the hypothesis that the \nconstruction of the adult performative theory of group identity depends on the conceptual \ndifferentiation of the mechanism of biological inheritance from that of social learning, and on the \ndifferentiation of the different kinds of properties that are acquired through those mechanisms.  \nFinally, with this study we will have completed the presentation of our data regarding the \ndomain of folkbiology (the biological inheritance of individual properties) and folksociology (the \ndetermination of group identity) from three different age groups: children, adolescents, and adults. \nImplicit in our discussion have been claims of massive developmental differences between children \nand adults. In this chapter we present the statistical analyses across all three age groups that \nestablish these claims. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n97\n  \nMethod \nParticipants \n Participants were 38 adolescents (mean age = 17 years, range = 14- to 20-years), from the \nsame Vezo village of Betania as the adults and the children. Of these adolescents, 9 young men and \n9 young women took part in the Vezo-Masikoro version (mean age = 17 years, range = 14- to 20-\nyears), and 9 young men and 11 young women took part in the Vezo-Karany version (mean age = \n17 years, range = 14- to 20-years). Adolescents, like the adults, were approached in their houses, \nand in return for their participation they were offered a small sum of money. \nProcedure \nThe procedure in Study 3 was the same as that of Study 2, except that adolescents, like \nadults, participated in both tasks on the same day. \nResults  \nAdolescents\u2019 reactions to the task \nAs a group, the adolescents who participated in the task were generally less cooperative than \nthe adults, but less shy than the children. Most of them were less familiar with the researcher (R.A.) \nthan were the adults, since they were still children at the time of her longest period of fieldwork in \nthe village ten years earlier. They were motivated to participate in the study by curiosity, the \nmonetary reward, and their parents\u2019 pressure to be helpful towards their \u201csister\u201d (i.e., the \nresearcher). Unlike children, who are not expected to understand the obligations inherent in kinship \nor quasi-kinship relations, adolescents are considered to be fully responsible social actors whose \ncooperation with the researcher was expected from their parents (who would have felt ashamed had \nthey failed to comply). Even if at times visibly bored, the young men and women who took part in \nthe study were nonetheless more forthcoming than the children, expressing their judgments more \nreadily and needing less probing in order to provide justifications.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n98\n  \nFolkbiology:  Resemblance Judgments for Group-Neutral Traits \n Vezo-Vezo scenario\nThe judgments of Vezo adolescents suggest that it is at this age that most have begun to \nresemble adults in their reasoning about biological inheritance. The majority of adolescents, 58%, \nshowed the Differentiated pattern typical of adults (see Table 8). A second-order application of the \nbinomial theorem, based on a probability of .04 that a participant would show a Differentiated \npattern by chance, indicates that the 22 out of 38 participants who showed this pattern is \nsignificantly more than would be expected by chance (p < .00l). Another 8% of the adolescents \nshowed a Birth Parent Bias pattern and 34% showed a Mixed pattern. Unlike children, no \nadolescent showed an Adoptive Parent Bias pattern. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 8 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAs can be seen in Table 9, adolescents on average differentiated between trait types in their \nresemblance judgments in a manner much like that shown by adults, if less sharply. Adolescents \noverall judged the adopted boy to resemble his birth parent on 88% of bodily traits, 30% of beliefs, \nand 25% of skills.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 9 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nVezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany scenarios \nAs with children and adults, adolescents overall made judgments about the group-neutral \ntraits on the Vezo-Masikoro and the Vezo-Karany tasks much as they had on the Vezo-Vezo task. \nThe distribution of patterns was very similar across the three scenarios (see Table 8). In each, a \nmajority of adolescents showed a Differentiated pattern (58% in the Vezo-Vezo scenario, 61% in \nthe Vezo-Masikoro scenario, and 65% in the Vezo-Karany scenario), and most of the rest showed \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n99\n  \nMixed patterns, with a few others showing Birth Parent Bias patterns. No adolescent showed an \nAdoptive Parent bias pattern on either task.  \nTable 9 further shows that the distributions of birth judgments made by adolescents in the \nthree scenarios were very similar. Overall, adolescents judged that the boy would have the bodily \nproperties of his birth father (ranging from 84 to 89 percent across the scenarios) and the beliefs and \nskills of his adoptive father (ranging from 19 to 30 percent on beliefs and from 25 to 45 percent on \nskills). As in Studies 1 and 2, a 2x2x3 repeated-measures ANOVA examined the effects of adoption \ntype (within-group vs. across-groups), across-group scenario (Vezo-Masikoro vs. Vezo-Karany), \nand trait type (bodily traits vs. beliefs vs. skills) on the percentage of birth parent resemblance \njudgments. The results show that Vezo adolescents, like Vezo adults and children, did not alter their \njudgments according to whether the adoption contrasted Vezo with Vezo, Vezo with Masikoro, or \nVezo with Karany, as was indicated by the lack of significant main effects or interactions involving \nscenario. As can be seen in Figure 1, adolescents overall differentiated among trait types, showing a \nsignificant main effect for trait across the three scenarios, F(2,72) = 75.25, p < .001.   \n Adults, adolescents and children compared \nWe are now in a position to compare the children, adolescents, and adults directly on their \nresemblance judgments for group-neutral traits in the three scenarios. In a 3x2x2x3 repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA, the 3 levels of the between-subjects factor of age was crossed with the 2 levels \nof the within-subjects factor of whether the adoption was Vezo-Vezo or across-groups (Vezo-Vezo \nscenario vs. Vezo-Masikoro or Vezo-Karany scenario), the 2 levels of the between-subjects factor \nof across-groups scenario (Vezo-Masikoro vs. Vezo-Karany), and the 3 levels of the within-subjects \nfactor of trait type (bodily traits, beliefs, and skills). The dependent measure was the percentage of \nbirth parent resemblance judgments.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n100\n  \nNot surprisingly, given the distributions of judgments across traits types shown in Figure 1, \nadolescents overall are not significantly different from adults, and both adults and adolescents are \nsignificantly different from children. There was a main effect of trait type (F(2, 206) = 142.30, p < \n.001) and an interaction of age by trait type (F(4, 206) = 22.78, p < .001). Post hoc analyses reveal \nthat this interaction derives from the greater tendency of adults and adolescents, relative to children, \nto differentiate between bodily traits, on the one hand, and beliefs and skills, on the other. No other \nmain effects or interactions were significant. At no age was there a significant effect of scenario. \nThat is, adolescents' judgments of resemblance on group-neutral traits was unaffected by whether \nthe birth and adoptive father were Vezo-Vezo, Vezo-Masikoro, or Vezo-Karany (see Tables 3, 7, \nand 9). \nIntermediate developmental steps \nOne can describe adolescents, in broad strokes, as having reasoned about family \nresemblance in much the same way as had adults. But this is not to say that there were no \ndifferences between adolescents and adults, and it is certainly not to say that there were no \nindividual adolescents who reasoned more like the group of children than like the group of adults. \nThis, of course, is only to be expected if adolescence is the period during which Vezo construct an \nunderstanding of the difference between birth and adoptive parentage, and of the distinct \nmechanisms mediating family resemblance. One might expect some adolescents to show a pattern \nof reasoning somewhat intermediate between that of children and that of adults, with some concepts \nless deeply understood, less interrelated than others. As can be seen from Tables 2 and 8, across all \nscenarios there were more adolescents than adults who gave Mixed patterns, X2(1) = 5.46, p < .02. \nThese Mixed patterns are particularly interesting, for they promise to reveal the intermediate steps \nby which children come to construct the adult understanding of the biological inheritance of \nindividual properties. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n101\n  \nWe compared the judgments of those adolescents who showed a Mixed pattern with the \njudgments of those who showed other patterns. Table 10 shows the percentage of adolescents\u2019 birth \nparent resemblance judgments on each type of trait as a function of their overall patterns of \njudgments in the Vezo-Vezo scenario (the results would be the same were we to consider the other \nscenarios as well). When we compare the adolescents who showed a Mixed pattern with those who \nshowed a Differentiated pattern, we find, first, that Mixed pattern adolescents were significantly \nless likely to make birth parent judgments on bodily traits than were Differentiated pattern \nadolescents, t(33) = 3.76, p < .001. Nonetheless, Mixed adolescents did make birth judgments on \nbodily traits more often than would be expected by chance, t(12) = 2.13, p < .03. Second, Mixed \npattern adolescents were significantly less likely to make canonical adoptive parent judgments on \nbeliefs than were Differentiated pattern adolescents, t(33) = 7.80, p < .001. Like children, Mixed \npattern adolescents were not significantly different from chance in making resemblance judgments \nabout beliefs. Third, the Mixed pattern adolescents were significantly more likely than chance to \njudge that the adopted boy would have the same skills as his adoptive father, t(13) = 5.10, p < .001. \nIndeed, adolescents who showed a Mixed pattern and those who showed a Differentiated pattern did \nnot differ significantly in their judgments on skills, as both groups made predominantly adoptive \nparent resemblance judgments. This suggests that even the Mixed adolescents have begun to \ndifferentiate two classes of mechanisms that underlie family resemblance. To be sure, the Mixed \npattern adolescents did not (by definition) categorically differentiate between bodily traits and \nbeliefs in their resemblance judgments as the Differentiated adolescents did, and, as indicated \nabove, they were significantly less likely than were the Differentiated adolescents to judge the \nbodily traits to resemble those of the birth parent. Nonetheless, it would appear that the Mixed \npattern adolescents have differentiated bodily traits from skills, t(12) = 4.68, p < .001. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n102\n  \nIt is perhaps not surprising that even those adolescents who have yet to fully differentiate the \nmechanisms that determine a person\u2019s individual properties have made significant headway in their \nunderstanding of how skills are acquired and transmitted. Adolescents are in the midst of learning \nskills and customs that are necessary to their livelihood and that mark them as competent members \nof their communities (e.g., how to sail, how to trade fish, how to behave at funerals). We suggest \nthat Vezo adolescents are likely to pay particular attention to the ways in which these properties are \ntransmitted and acquired because of the heavily weighted testimony they hear about how one \nbecomes Vezo. If true, this would imply that the differentiation between biological inheritance and \nsocial learning is partly driven by the adolescents\u2019 growing understanding of the Vezo performative \ntheory of group identity. This hypothesis leads us to the prediction that adolescents\u2019 reasoning about \ngroup-typical properties in the Vezo-Masikoro and Vezo-Karany tasks should be even more like \nthat of adults than their reasoning about group neutral properties. We examine this possibility \nbelow, when we turn to the adolescents\u2019 judgments about group identity. \nJustifications: all scenarios\nAdolescents fall somewhere in between children and adults in terms of their ability or \nwillingness to articulate the reasoning behind their resemblance judgments (see Table 4 for coding \ncriteria). A total of 71 justifications were given by adolescents, with 27 of the 38 (71%) participants \nproducing at least one, for an average of about two justifications per participant. This compares with \n108 justifications given by adults (94% of them offering at least one), and with 58 justifications \ngiven by children (60% of them offering at least one). \nAdolescents always gave justifications that were consistent with the reasoning implicit in \ntheir judgments. However, only 26 of the adolescents\u2019 71 justifications (37%) spelled out a causal \nmechanism to explain the resemblance between the adopted boy and his birth or adoptive father (as \ncompared to 76% of adults\u2019 and 32% of children\u2019s justifications). Most of these causally \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n103\n  \ninformative justifications invoked Nurture mechanisms (16 of the 26), along with a handful of \nOrigins (4), Spiritual Connection (5) and one Individual Intrinsic justifications. The remaining \njustifications did not spell out the causal mechanism underlying trait acquisition; they included \nsimple restatements of the question or of the participant\u2019s own judgment (i.e., Like Birth Father, \nGenerated, Like Adoptive Father, Raised), simple assertions about the truth of the belief or the \ndesirability of the trait (i.e., Truth\/Desirability justifications), or were uncodable (i.e., Other). Two \nexperimenters coded the English translation of the justifications with 91% reliability; the first author \nresolved disagreements by consulting the original Malagasy version. \nLike adults, adolescents were more likely to comment on the mechanism of nurture than on \nthe mechanism of birth. Indeed, none of the adolescents ever offered an Origins justification for the \njudgment that the boy would resemble the birth father on bodily traits (their Origins justifications \nwere given only for birth judgments on beliefs and skills). Some of the adolescents were able to \ninvoke nurture as the mediating causal mechanism for the transmission of beliefs and skills. \nNonetheless, we should also note that adolescents used Truth\/Desirability justifications (e.g., \n\u201cbecause \u201cx\u201d is true\u201d) to explain why the adopted boy would have the same beliefs as his adoptive \nfather (29% of the justifications ever given for this type of judgment). This is a kind of explanation \nthat was never given by adults. Although Truth\/Desirability justifications could entail a causal \nmechanism (i.e., since \u201cx\u201d is true, the adopted boy will discover that \u201cx\u201d is true, and will therefore \nbelieve in \u201cx\u201d), there is little evidence that adolescents who offered this type of justifications used \nthis reasoning strategy. Rather, the researcher who interviewed them had the impression that they \nmade their resemblance judgments (i.e., that the adopted boy will believe \u201cx\u201d) simply on the basis \nof their subjective decision that the belief under consideration was true. \nOverall, we found that adolescents, like adults in Study 1, were significantly more likely to \noffer justifications when they made judgments that deviated from the canonical Differentiated \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n104\n  \npattern than they did when their judgments were consistent with it, \u03a72(1) = 60.28, p < .001. That is, \nthey gave justifications 33% of the time they gave adoptive judgments on bodily traits or birth \njudgments on beliefs, as compared to only 6% of the time they gave the more canonical birth \njudgments on bodily traits or adoptive judgments on beliefs. Moreover, adolescents who showed a \nDifferentiated pattern on both tasks were not significantly more likely to show this tendency than \nwere those adolescents who showed a Mixed pattern in one or both tasks. This finding supports the \nsuggestion that even the adolescents who did not meet our criteria for the Differentiated pattern \nwere nonetheless somewhat sensitive to the distinctions probed by our task, insofar as they \nsystematically chose to comment on those judgments that violated the distinction between \nbiological and social family resemblance. \nFolksociology: Group Identity Judgments and Resemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits \n Group Identity Judgments \nThe majority of adolescents (94%) who participated in the Vezo-Masikoro task judged that \nthe adopted boy would be Vezo or Masikoro like his adoptive parents. This result is not surprising, \nas the majority of adults (87%) and children (65%) had made similar judgments about the \nacquisition of these two group identities. The majority of adolescents also judged that the boy \nwould have the group identity of his adoptive parents in the Vezo-Karany task. The 65% of \nadolescents making such a judgment is not significantly less than the 78% of adults who did so, but \nit is significantly more than the 28% of children, \u03a72(1) = 5.66, p< .02. \nThough the majority of adolescents have successfully extended the causal reasoning that is \nimplicit in what they know about Vezo and Masikoro group identities to their reasoning about Vezo \nand Karany identities, not all have done so. Adolescents in the Vezo-Karany task were significantly \nmore likely to make birth parent judgments about group identity than were those who took part in \nthe Vezo-Masikoro task, \u03a72(1) = 4.94, p < .03. This suggests that some adolescents were still in the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n105\n  \nprocess of working out the implications of the adult performative theory of identity. While this \nprocess unfolds the traces of children\u2019s intuition that Vezo and Karany group identities are \ndetermined by birth origins are still in evidence. \nResemblance Judgments for Group-Typical Traits  \nIn preliminary testing, we found that adolescents overwhelming did know which particular \nfunerary practices, marriage practices, and customs were typical of the Vezo, Masikoro, or Karany \n(100% correctly judged which funerary practices we probed were typical of either Vezo or \nMasikoro people, 83% correctly judged beliefs about Vezo or Masikoro marriage practices, and \n98% recognized which beliefs about funerary practices were typical of the Vezo or Karany people). \nAs can be seen in Figure 2, adolescents, like adults and unlike children, tended to judge that the \nadopted boy would resemble his adoptive parent in having the acquired bodily traits, beliefs and \nskills typical of the adopted parent's group (whether Vezo, Masikoro, or Karany). On average, they \njudged that he would resemble his adopted parent 80% of the time on acquired bodily traits, 77% of \nthe time on beliefs, and 86% of the time on skills. By contrast, adolescents on average judged that \nthe boy would resemble his birth father 90% of the time on group-typical inborn bodily traits (i.e., \nskin color and hair type).  \nAdults, adolescents and children compared\nA 3x3x2 repeated-measures ANOVA examined the influences of Age, Trait, and Scenario \non the percentage of birth parent resemblance judgments given for the acquired group-typical traits. \nThere was a significant main effects of Age (F(2, 103) = 40.35, p < .001). There were no other \nsignificant main effects or interactions. Post hoc analyses indicate that the main effect of Age \nderives from the greater tendency of children to make birth parent judgments across traits. \nAdolescents\u2019 judgments were not significantly different from those of adults. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n106\n  \nThe coherence of their judgments that an adopted boy would acquire group-typical \nproperties like those of his adoptive parents \u2013 save for inborn somatic ones \u2013 and that he would also \nhave the group identity of his adoptive parents, confirms that the majority of the adolescents \nreasoned in a manner consistent with the adult performative theory of identity. They understand that \nan individual\u2019s group identity is mediated by the acquisition of salient group-typical properties such \nas occupational skills, religious practices, and beliefs. \nIntermediate developmental steps \nIn Study 1, we argued that the adult performative theory of group identity depends upon the \ndifferentiation of biologically mediated and culturally mediated processes of individual trait \ntransmission. In Study 2, we found that Vezo children did not draw on this differentiation in their \nreasoning about family resemblance, and that they had a very shallow understanding of how adults \nclassify people into groups. In the present study, we have found that adolescents\u2019 reasoning about \nthe transmission of individual properties and about group identity is similar to that of the adults. \nNonetheless, as noted earlier, there is a considerable group of adolescents who have yet to show the \ncategorical differentiation between biological inheritance and social learning that was characteristic \nof the adult participants. As before, we can turn to these Mixed pattern adolescents to reveal some \nof the intermediate steps through which the adult performative theory of identity is constructed.  \nIt would seem that, at a minimum, the adult theory requires a firm understanding of the role \nof learning and practice in acquiring the skills and the cultural norms and beliefs that determine \nwhether a person is Vezo, Masikoro or Karany. We showed in Study 2 that this understanding is \nbeyond most children\u2019s conceptual resources. In order to discover whether Mixed pattern \nadolescents have the necessary concepts out of which to construct the adult understanding of group \nidentity, we analyzed the percentages of birth parent resemblance judgments for Group-Typical \nproperties in either Vezo-Masikoro or Vezo-Karany task, as a function of adolescents\u2019 overall \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n107\n  \npatterns of judgments for Group-Neutral properties in that same task (see Table 11). Not \nsurprisingly, the adolescents who showed a Differentiated pattern were almost categorical in \njudging that the adopted boy would resemble his birth parent on inborn group-typical bodily traits \n(e.g., skin color in the Vezo-Karany scenario), and his adoptive parent on group-typical acquired \ntraits (including bodily properties such as having scarred hands as the result of fishing). More \nimportantly, adolescents who showed a Mixed pattern were almost as categorical. They judged the \nadopted child to resemble his birth parent on features such as skin color and hair type 80% of the \ntime, significantly more often than would be expected by chance, t(4) = 2.45, p < .04). They also \njudged that the adopted boy would resemble his birth parent on group-typical beliefs only 27% of \nthe time, significantly less often than would be expected by chance, t(10) = 2.19, p < .03. This \nfinding is in contrast to the relative lack of differentiation in their judgments for group neutral \nbodily traits (67% of which were judged to be like those of the birth parent) and beliefs (a striking \n55% of which were judged to be like those of the birth parent).  \nThe above result shows that even Mixed pattern adolescents have a firm differentiated \nunderstanding of how group-typical properties are acquired. Though they do not yet fully \nunderstand why an adopted child will have pointed ears like his birth father, they seem to know why \nthat same child will be black like him; though they would appear not to know whether an adopted \nchild will believe what his birth or adoptive father believed about the number of teeth chameleons \nhave, they are confident that the child will believe that funerals should be kept short, just as his \nadoptive father believes. This finding supports our hypothesis that adolescents begin to comprehend \nthe difference between biological and social mechanisms of trait transmission by first making sense \nof the adult performative theory of group identity. That is, they first learn that, irrespective of their \nbirth origins and skin color, people acquire their group identity by acquiring the properties that are \ntypical of the social environment in which they grow up.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n108\n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 11 about here \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nJustifications\nVirtually all of the adolescents justified their group identity judgments and did so in a \nmanner consistent with the judgments for which they were given. In the Vezo-Masikoro task, 14 \njustifications were given for adoptive parent group identity judgments: 6 were coded as Upbringing, \n4 as Environment, 2 as Raised, and 2 as Like Adoptive Father. In the Vezo-Karany task, 13 \njustifications were given for adoptive parent group identity judgments: 9 were coded as Upbringing, \n1 as Environment, 2 as Occupation, and 1 as Other. The majority of these justifications reveal a \ncausal understanding of how people become what they are: it is because of where they grow up, of \nthe work they do, of the parents who nurture them that people turn out to be Vezo, Masikoro or \nKarany. \nOnly one participant in the Vezo-Masikoro task gave a birth parent group identity judgment, \nand the justification provided was coded as Generated. In the Vezo-Karany task, 7 justifications \ngiven for the judgment that the adopted boy would have the group identity of his birth father: 3 \nwere coded as Origins, 1 as Spiritual Connection, 1 as Generated, 1 as Like Birth Father, and 1 as \nOccupation. Thus, out of the 8 adolescents across both tasks who judged the boy to have the group \nidentity of his birth father, only one gave the kind of inconsistent Occupation justification that we \nfound among children (i.e., she judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo like his birth father \n\u201cbecause he knows how to sail\u201d). Instead, most of the adolescents who made a birth parent \njudgment for group identity were able to articulate the view that group identity is a property of the \nperson that is inherited at birth, through one\u2019s ancestry, and that it is impervious to change (a view \nshared by one-fifth of the adults in the Vezo-Karany task). \nConclusions\n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n109\n  \nThree important results emerge from these analyses. First, the majority of Vezo adolescents, \nlike adults and unlike children, were able to reproduce the adult performative theory of what it \nmeans to be Vezo. They understood that to be Vezo is to have Vezo skills, to follow Vezo ways and \ncustoms, and that these ways and customs are learned by living in a certain environment and by \nparticipating in the social life of other Vezo people. Adolescents neither essentialized Vezo identity \nnor naturalized it, even when they were asked to contrast it with Karany identity. Second, a minority \nof adolescents showed a remnant of the children\u2019s tendency to naturalize the group identity of Vezo \nand Karany people.  As a group, adolescents, unlike adults, were significantly more likely to make \nbirth judgments on group identity in the Vezo-Karany scenario than in the Vezo-Masikoro scenario. \nThird, there is evidence that adolescents work out the difference between the causal mechanism of \nbiological inheritance and of social learning in the case of group-typical traits before they do in the \ncase of group neutral traits.   \nIn view of these findings, we offer a final analysis to further explore the interrelation \nbetween the emergence of the adolescents\u2019 differentiated understanding of the biological and social \nmechanisms responsible for family resemblance, and their mastery of the adult performative theory \nof identity. We submit that to demonstrate a fully mature grasp of what it means to be Vezo, \nMasikoro or Karany, a participant should have made the following interrelated and coherent set of \nresponses: an adoptive judgment on group identity; an explicit causal justification for such \njudgment; at least 5 adoptive judgments on group-typical acquired properties (out of a possible total \nof 6); and, in the case of the Vezo-Karany task, 2 birth judgments on group-typical inborn bodily \nproperties. A total of eleven adolescents met these very strict criteria, strikingly all adolescents who \nhad shown a Differentiated pattern of judgments on group-neutral properties in at least one of the \nscenarios (within-group or across-group). This finding suggests that full mastery of the adult \nperformative theory of group identity requires a firm and explicit differentiation between biological \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n110\n  \nand social mechanisms of trait transmission. Of course, this does not mean that such a differentiated \nunderstanding guarantees the immediate and automatic construction of a fully coherent theory of \nidentity. Nonetheless, the more consolidated the differentiated understanding becomes, the more \nlikely it is that adolescents will meet our stringent criteria. Thus, whereas these criteria were met by \n38% of the adolescents who showed a Differentiated pattern in at least one of the scenarios, they \nwere met by 53% of the adolescents who showed a Differentiated pattern on both of the scenarios \nand, as mentioned earlier, by none of the adolescents who failed to show the Differentiated pattern \non either. This result supports the hypothesis put forward in Study 1 that the differentiated \nunderstanding of the mechanisms of biological inheritance and cultural transmission is necessary, \nthough decidedly not sufficient, for the construction of the Vezo performative theory of group \nidentity. \nDiscussion \nBoth the differentiated understanding of the biological and social transmission of individual \nproperties and the Vezo performative construal of group identity are cultural constructions that take \nconsiderable time to develop. Although in the present Study, we found that adolescents as a group \ndid not differ from adults \u2013 most adolescents showed a Differentiated pattern of judgments for \nindividual group-neutral properties, they understood that group identity is determined by what \npeople do rather than by their birth origins, even when reasoning about the unfamiliar Vezo-Karany \ncontrast, and they gave adoptive judgments on all acquired group-typical properties \u2013 the \nadolescents who showed a Mixed pattern in their resemblance judgments allowed to shed light on \nthe constructive process that drives the transition from children\u2019s to adults\u2019 understandings. \nAmong these Mixed pattern adolescents, we found evidence that the crucial distinction \nbetween biological and social processes of trait transmission is won, at least in part, as a result of \nmaking sense of the adult performative theory of group identity. Adolescents who showed a Mixed \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n111\n  \npattern of judgments on group-neutral properties successfully differentiated between inborn and \nacquired group-typical properties. In other words, they understood that people\u2019s skin color and hair \ntype is determined by their innate potential; babies born of Vezo parents may be as light skinned as \nthose born of Karany parents (and they are), but Vezo babies cannot help but develop into dark \nskinned adults, irrespective of where and with whom they live. And they also understood that, by \ncontrast, people\u2019s customs, religious beliefs and occupational skills are acquired through practice, \nlearning and habituation: babies born of Vezo, Masikoro and Karany parents are equally unable to \nbehave according to custom, are equally agnostic as to whether dead people become ancestors or \nwhether Allah is the only God, and are equally unable to fish, cultivate or trade, but by the time they \nare grown up they will have learnt specific ways of behaving, believing and providing for their \nlivelihood that are entirely dependent on where and with whom they live.  \nThis principled differentiation between properties that develop according to one\u2019s innate \npotential and properties that are acquired through learning and practice is likely to be initially made \nfor group-typical properties because it is directly and very explicitly supported by the adult \ntestimony children are bombarded with: They are told that they are Vezo if they know how to fish; \nthat other people are Masikoro if they know how to cultivate; that Masikoro and Vezo have \ndifferent customs; that Vezo become Masikoro if they change their ways of doing things; that \nchildren themselves can be very Vezo at times \u2013 when they paddle skillfully \u2013 but Masikoro at other \ntimes \u2013 when they are sea-sick. We suggest that in the process of making sense of all of this, \nchildren\u2019s attention is drawn to the fact that those properties that are said to make people Vezo are \nproperties that the children themselves do not yet have, but which must be learned. We suggest that \nVezo children, in learning the ways of doing that make them Vezo, also learn the critical distinction \nbetween those properties that are inherited \u2013 like the color of their skin or the texture of their hair \u2013 \nand properties that must and can be acquired. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n112\n  \nThe realization that a person\u2019s customs, religious beliefs and skills do not develop naturally, \nbut are the result of a process of socially-mediated learning, appears to emerge in the face of \nchildren\u2019s tendency to naturalize human group identity. Remarkably, however, we found a vestige \nof this tendency in the present Study, as shown by the fact that the adolescents who participated in \nthe Vezo-Karany task were more likely to naturalize group identity than were those who \nparticipated in the Vezo-Masikoro task. Consistent with the Innate Conceptual Constraints \nhypothesis, children and adolescents showed this tendency despite the fact that the adult testimony \nabout what it means to be Vezo \u2013 and, by implication, about what it means to be Karany \u2013 does not \nsupport  this understanding of what makes people who they are. This confirms the suggestion \nadvanced in Chapter 3 that reasoning in this domain is subject to some sort of internal constraint. \nAlthough the present data do not allow us to decide between competing hypotheses concerning the \nnature of the constraint (see General Discussion), one possibility is that human kinds are analogized \nto animal species (as suggested by Atran, 1990). A first step towards evaluating this proposal is to \nascertain whether Vezo children understand that birth origins are responsible for the fixation of \nanimal kind identities. This is the aim of Study 4. \nIn spite of the fact that children\u2019s tendency to naturalize group identity is still in evidence \namong adolescents (remember, it was still in evidence among some of the adults as well), most \nadolescents were well along in understanding and adopting the adult performative theory of group \nidentity. Our analysis revealed that those adolescents who had a firmer understanding of the \ndifferent causal mechanisms that are implicated in the transmission of an individual\u2019s properties, \nalso had the most mature grasp of the adult performative theory. This confirms that development in \nthese two conceptual domains is closely intertwined. \nWe have first argued that adolescents begin to build a differentiated understanding of the \nprocess of biological inheritance and of socially mediated learning by drawing the distinction \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n113\n  \nbetween inherited and acquired properties a result of being exposed to the adult theory of group \nidentity. We have then argued that in order to understand this theory, adolescents require the \nconceptual differentiation between birth and social parentage, between bodily and \nmental\/experiential traits. This argument may appear circular, but it is precisely because the relevant \nconcepts are interdefined such that their conceptual roles are mutually self-constituting, that they \nare acquired in such a coherent manner. This type of apparent circularity is typical of conceptual \nchange, in childhood as well as in the history of science (see Smith, Solomon, & Carey, 2004 for a \nworked example).   \nMany questions of detail remain open, requiring further data to address them. These include \nquestions such as how we should think about the constraints that lead children to naturalize group \nidentities in the face of adult testimony to the contrary, and what leads Vezo adults to construct a \nperformative theory that overturns these initial constraints. Indeed, we have yet to account fully for \nthe important discrepancy between our claim that Vezo children must come to understand the \nconceptual differentiation between biological and social processes of individual trait transmission in \norder to understand a crucial aspect of their culture (no less than who they are), and the \nanthropological claim that this very differentiation of biological and social processes is disallowed \nby the ontology of people like the Vezo. We return to these questions in Chapter VI, after \npresenting data on children\u2019s and adult\u2019s reasoning about animal species. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n114\n  \nChapter V \nSTUDY 4. REASONING ABOUT ANIMALS AND SPECIES KIND \n \nThe data in Chapter III indicated that Vezo children, unlike Vezo adolescents and adults, do \nnot understand the biological inheritance of bodily traits, even those like skin color and hair texture \nthat are somatic markers of what in the West are construed as racial distinctions. Children did not \ndistinguish between birth and adoptive parents in deciding which of these bodily traits a child would \ngrow up to have, nor did they differentiate bodily traits from beliefs or skills in their resemblance \njudgments. However, the relevance of the distinction between birth and adoptive families was not \nentirely absent from their reasoning. When reasoning about group identity, the majority of children \njudged that a child born to Vezo parents but raised by Karany would grow up to be Vezo (birth \nparent judgment) and that a child born to Vezo parents but raised by Masikoro would grow up to be \nMasikoro (adoptive parent judgment). \nOne possible source of children\u2019s judgments about Vezo and Karany group identities is the \nanalogy to species kinds, an analogy which could have been triggered by the stable morphological \ndifferences between Vezo and Karany people (see Atran, 1990). Several studies have established \nthat in many different cultural contexts children as young as 4 years of age naturalize and \nessentialize animal species, that is, they understand that baby ducks hatch from the eggs laid by \nducks, that they will always be ducks and that they will grow up to have the properties of ducks (see \nAtran et al., 2001; Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Horobin, 1997; Johnson & Solomon, 1997; Medin & \nAtran, in press, Sousa et al., 2002). The hypothesis that those children who judged that a baby born \nof Vezo parents would be Vezo even if raised by Karany parents were recruiting their understanding \nof animal species logically requires that Vezo children resemble their counterparts around the world \nin their knowledge of what determines species kind. Study 4 tests this hypothesis, using a duck-\nchicken \u201cadoption\u201d scenario adapted from Johnson and Solomon (1997). This Study also seeks to \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n115\n  \nadd to the already existing evidence that a naturalized understanding of species fixation emerges \nearly in development under conditions of widely varying cultural input. \nAs noted in the Introduction, there are two ways of predicting the properties of an \nindividual, human or animal. The first one is to derive them from kind membership. The inductive \npotential of species kind membership allows one to predict that an animal of a certain kind will have \nthe properties that are kind dependent:  properties such as the five fingers of a human hand, the soft \ncurly fur and the \u201cbaaa\u201d of a sheep, the stripes and the roar of a tiger. Therefore, success in \npredicting that an individual\u2019s kind identity and its kind-dependent properties are determined by \nbirth parentage, while important, does not require an understanding of the mechanism of biological \ninheritance. All it requires is an essentialist construal of species kind and an understanding that \nbabies resemble their parents (i.e., offspring resemble their birth parents simply because these are \nthe first parents, and once kind is fixed, it remains constant throughout an individual\u2019s existence).  \nObviously, not all of an individual\u2019s properties can be predicted from kind membership, as \nfor example Jerry\u2019s brown hair or Alex\u2019s blond hair, and Mary\u2019s ignorance of poetry or Joyce\u2019s \nencyclopaedic knowledge of it. Success in predicting which of these properties an individual will \nhave does require an understanding of the mechanism of biological inheritance. And this is why, if \nwe wish to establish whether children have an understanding of biological inheritance, we must ask, \nas we have done in Study 2, whether they understand that Jerry\u2019s brown hair or Alex\u2019s blond hair \nare causally related to their birth parentage, whereas Mary\u2019s ignorance or Joyce\u2019s knowledge of \npoetry are not. And, in the case of animals, whether children differentiate between the biological \ninheritance of kind-neutral bodily properties (e.g., having one foot more yellow than the other) and \nthe acquisition of knowledge-based properties through practice and habituation (e.g., knowing the \nplace where the rice is kept in the owner\u2019s house).  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n116\n  \nAtran et al. (2001) have criticized this diagnostic measure, pointing out that in some cultural \ncontexts people may deny that animals are capable of learning. We agree that this is a distinct \npossibility among Vezo adults (see Astuti, 2000b, for ethnographic data concerning the sharp \ndistinction Vezo draw between humans and other animals), and for this reason we have included an \nadult sample in Study 4 as well. If Vezo adults reject the notion that individual ducks and chickens \nare capable of knowing or remembering previously unknown facts, they might either assume that all \nthe probed knowledge-based properties are kind-dependent, in which case we would expect a Birth \nParent Bias pattern (i.e., if mother duck knows X, it must mean that all ducks know X, and therefore \nthe baby duck will also grow up to know X), or they might decide idiosyncratically whether a \ncertain knowledge-based property is kind-dependent or not, in which case we would expect a Mixed \npattern (e.g., the baby duck will not know how to do Y because doing Y is not something that ducks \ndo, but it will know X because it is in ducks\u2019 nature to know X). By contrast, if Vezo adults accept \nthe possibility that ducks and chickens learn from experience, they should differentiate between \nbodily and knowledge-based properties as they did in Study 1, in which case we would expect a \nDifferentiated pattern. \nIn the case of Vezo children, we expect that, like the children who have been tested in other \ncultural contexts, they will succeed in identifying the species identity of a bird whose egg was laid \nby a duck but was sat upon and raised by a chicken (and vice versa). However, we do not expect \nthem to differentiate their resemblance judgments on individual properties. In their animal adoption \nstudy, Johnson and Solomon (1997) found that North American children do not show evidence of a \ndifferentiated understanding of trait transmission in the animal context any earlier than they do in \nthe human context. We expect to replicate this finding. That is, we predict that 6- to 13-year-olds \nwill not differentiate bodily from knowledge-based properties in their resemblance judgments in the \nanimal adoption scenario, just as they failed to do in the human adoption scenarios in Study 2. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n117\n  \nThe present Study has some important methodological implications. The procedure mirrors \nexactly that of Study 2. The scenarios are equally complex, and participants were asked several \nresemblance questions concerning individual properties before they were asked about species \nidentity. Thus, if the younger participants succeed in Study 4, we can be sure that task-demands and \nthe unfamiliar testing procedure alone did not defeat our unschooled Vezo children.  \nMethod \nParticipants \n Nineteen Vezo children, 8 girls and 11 boys (mean age = 10 years, range = 6 to 13 years), \nand 15 adults, 9 women and 6 men (mean age = 35 years, range 22 to 60 years), took part in Study \n4. Some of the children were interviewed in Lovobe, the Vezo village immediately south of \nBetania. None of the children had taken part in a previous study. Eight of the adults who had \npreviously taken part in Study 1 were chosen randomly to participate in the present study. \nPreliminary analyses revealed no differences between adults who had and those who had not taken \npart in previous studies, so their data were collapsed. Participants were interviewed individually and \nin return received a small sum of money. \nProcedure \n The design of the animal adoption task used in Study 4 was almost identical to that of the \nhuman adoption tasks. Participants were told a cross-species adoption story, almost a direct \ntranslation of that used in Johnson and Solomon (1997), in which an egg laid by one animal (e.g., a \nduck) is placed into the nest of another animal (e.g., a hen), where it hatches and is raised by the \nsecond animal. The birth parent was said to have been sold off at the market in order to reduce the \npossibility that participants would assume that the offspring would have any further interaction with \nit (see Appendix A, Animal Adoption Scenario). Children were asked comprehension questions \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n118\n  \nafter the telling of the story. One child was unable to answer these questions correctly and was \ndropped from study. \nParticipants were asked to judge resemblance on 8 feature pairs (see Appendix B, Table B \n6): 4 pairs of Bodily traits (e.g., red tongue \/ yellow tongue) and 4 pairs of Knowledge-based traits \n(e.g., knows where there is a hole in the fence from which to get out and look for food \/ does not \nknow where there is a hole in the fence from which to get out and look for food). As the story was \nrecited, children were shown photographs of a duck and a hen in which none of the properties \nprobed by the task were visible. After completing the resemblance questions, participants were \nasked whether the little bird would be a duck or a chicken. Children were asked to justify their \nanswers. Adults were not asked to provide such justifications as pilot testing had indicated that the \nanswer was so obvious as to make the question tedious.  \nThe study was balanced across participants for whether the bodily traits were presented \nbefore or after the knowledge-based traits, and for whether the duck or the hen was described as \nbeing the birth parent. Preliminary analysis indicated there to be no significant effects of these \nmanipulations and so subsequent analyses collapsed across these factors. \nResults \nAdults\u2019 Results \nSpecies Identity Judgments \nAs expected, all 15 adults judged that the offspring would have the kind identity of its birth \nparent (see Figure 3). This is significantly different from the judgments made by adults in Study 1, \nin which 13% of the participants made a birth parent judgment on group identity in the Vezo-\nMasikoro scenario, (\u03a72(1)= 22.94, p < .001), and 25% did so in the Vezo-Karany scenario (\u03a72(1)= \n18.36, p < .001). Vezo adults, in other words, did not extend their performative theory about the \ndetermination of human group identity to their reasoning about animal species identity. This is \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n119\n  \nhardly surprising, given their differentiated understanding of biological inheritance revealed in \nStudy 1. \nResemblance Judgments for Individual Properties \nParticipants\u2019 judgments were characterized according to the same pattern categories as had \nbeen used in the human adoption studies, with Knowledge-based traits used in place of Beliefs. \nThus, participants were said to have shown a Differentiated Pattern if they judged the bird to \nresemble its birth mother on at least three of the four Bodily traits and on none of the four \nKnowledge-based traits, or on all four Bodily traits and on not more than one of the four \nKnowledge-based traits (p < .04); they were said to have shown a Birth Parent Bias if they judged \nthe bird to resemble its birth mother on at least 7 of the 8 features (p < .04), and to have shown an \nAdoptive Parent Bias if they judged the bird to resemble its adoptive mother on at least 7 of the 8 \nfeatures (p< .04). As can be seen in Table 12, a majority of adults (53%) showed a Differentiated \npattern, significantly more than would be expected by chance (p < .001).  Thirteen percent of adults \nprovided Birth Parent Bias patterns, as would be expected if they interpreted the knowledge-based \nproperties to be species-dependent. The rest (34%) provided Mixed patterns in which bodily traits \nwere predicted on the basis of birth parentage, whereas judgements on knowledge-based properties \nwere made idiosyncratically. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 12 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe differentiation of the two types of traits was seen not only in the high proportion of \ndifferentiated patterns, but also in the group means for the trait types (see Table 13).  All adult \nparticipants judged that the bird would resemble its birth mother on all bodily traits. In contrast, for \nonly 32% of the knowledge-based traits did adults judge that the baby would end up resembling the \nbirth mother. Overall, adults reasoned about the inter-generational transmission of properties in the \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n120\n  \ncase of animals as they had for humans, contrary to the hypothesis that they might consider animals \nincapable of learning. Nonetheless, details of our results give partial support to that hypothesis: first, \ndeviations from the canonical differentiated pattern always involved judgments that the bird would \nresemble its birth mother in the knowledge-based properties; and second, as we shall see below, the \nview that ducks and chickens are incapable of learning was sometimes explicitly articulated in the \njustifications for these birth mother resemblance judgments. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 13 about here. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nJustifications \nWhen asked whether a bird hatched from the egg of a duck would be a duck or a chicken, \nVezo adults were bemused. Only one adult offered a justification for this obvious judgment (\"It was \na chicken because it came out of a chicken's egg\").  Similarly, as we saw above, adults judged that \nthe baby bird would have the bodily properties of its birth mother 100% of the time, but they never \noffered a justification for these judgments. The answers must have seemed too obvious to warrant \nelaboration.  \nBy contrast, adults offered a total of 19 justifications for their resemblance judgments on \nknowledge-based properties, with 73% of the adults producing at least one justification (a mean of \n1.3 justifications per participant). All of the six justifications given in support of an adoptive \njudgment were coded as Nurture, accounting for 32% of all justifications given  (e.g., \"It will learn \nfrom the duck where the food is kept and will steal it\"). By contrast, the 13 justifications given by \nparticipants who judged that the little bird would resemble its birth mother were coded either as \nKind (47% of all justifications), Origins (16% of all justifications), or Like Birth Parent (5% of all \njustifications). As in the human scenarios, adults were significantly more likely to comment \nspontaneously on their judgments when they deviated from the canonical pattern than when they \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n121\n  \nwere consistent with it. That is, they offered justifications 15% of the time they judged that the bird \nwould resemble its adoptive mother on knowledge-based properties, as opposed to 68% of the time \nthey judged that the bird would resemble its birth mother, \u03a72(1) = 17.36, p < .001. \nThe Kind justifications are of particular interest here. They invoked the intrinsic nature of \nthe chicken or the duck as explanation for the baby bird\u2019s development of a certain property, \nirrespective of the bird\u2019s nurturing environment (e.g., \u201cThe bird will be like its birth mother because \nit is the way of being of ducks that they don\u2019t find holes in fences, that they don\u2019t look for a way \nout.\u201d). They thus express the view that different animal species have different innate potentials, or \ndifferent instincts that guide their species-specific behaviors. Note that we intentionally chose \nknowledge-based properties which, in the piloting of the study, had not been judged to be species \ntypical, and most informants were happy to treat them as such. However, a third of the time, adult \nparticipants interpreted these properties to be more typical of either ducks or chickens. The fact that \nthere was no consensus as to which trait was typical of either bird species makes it even more \nremarkable that such traits nonetheless triggered essentialist reasoning in some of the participants. \nIn most cases, this reasoning strategy was accompanied by the denial that animals are \ncapable of learning. In the debriefing of the task, participants who had made at least one birth \njudgment for knowledge-based properties were asked whether they thought that a chicken or a duck \ncould ever learn a certain behavior (e.g., how to steal rice or find a hole in the fence). Of the 5 \nadults who offered Kind justifications, 4 asserted that the bird would not be able to learn anything. \nSome of these participants acknowledged that the bird can know things, but that \u201cit will not have \nlearnt them\u201d while others asserted that \u201cchickens have no thoughts\u201d and that \u201cbirds can\u2019t learn \nanything, they don\u2019t know anything\u201d. We can therefore conclude that about a third of the adult \nparticipants have integrated the view that an animal\u2019s innate potential determines its species-\n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n122\n  \nspecific behavior with the view that ducks and chickens \u2013 unlike people \u2013 are incapable of learning \nthrough imitation, practice and habituation. \nIn sum, as expected, adults reasoned in an explicitly essentialist manner about animals\u2019 \nspecies identity and about some animal properties. Adults overall also extended to animals their \ndifferentiated understanding of how individual human traits are aacquired, though a minority of \nparticipants did consider some of the knowledge-based properties probed by our task to be part of \nthe animals\u2019 innate potential rather than something that is learned. Both of these findings are \nsignificant, as they show that Vezo adults do have access to an essentialist mode of reasoning about \nidentity and about properties. The fact that they did not deploy such essentialist reasoning when \nconsidering contrasting human groups is therefore all the more striking. \nChildren\u2019s Results \nSpecies Identity Judgments \nVezo children were also overwhelmingly more likely to judge that the offspring would have \nthe same kind identity of its birth mother than of its adoptive mother (see Figure 3). The proportion \nof children (84%) who did so is not significantly different from that of adults. Again like adults, \nchildren in the animal task were significantly more likely to make birth parent identity judgments \nthan were those children who participated in the Vezo-Masikoro task, in which only 35% judged \nthat the adopted boy would be the kind of his birth parents, \u03a72(1) = 9.75, p < .005. Critically, the \nproportion of birth kind identity judgments made by the children in the animal task was not \nsignificantly different from that of children in the Vezo-Karany task, in which 73% judged that the \nadopted boy would have the group identity of his birth parents. In other words, children would \nappear to have reasoned about the contrast between ducks and chickens just as they reasoned about \nthe contrast between Vezo and Karany. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that children \nnaturalize human group identities by analogy to species kind in animals.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n123\n  \nResemblance Judgments for Individual Properties \nMost children failed to differentiate the two classes of mechanisms for trait transmission on \nthe animal adoption task (see Table 12), just as a comparable proportion had failed to show a \nDifferentiated pattern on the human adoption tasks in Study 2 (see Table 6). The children in this \nstudy were also not significantly more likely to show a Birth Parent Bias pattern than were the \nchildren in Study 2.  \nNotably, children's resemblance judgments on bodily traits and beliefs for humans in Study \n2 were not significantly different from children's judgments on bodily traits and knowledge-based \ntraits for animals in Study 4. Moreover, children's judgments on knowledge-based traits did not \ndiffer significantly from chance. Given that children showed no understanding of the role of \nlearning, practice and habituation in humans, it should not be surprising that they failed to do so in \nanimals. \nAs can be seen in Table 13, children reasoned about the transmission of an animal\u2019s \nindividual traits differently than the adults. A 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA, crossing the 2 levels \nof the between-subjects factor of Age (children vs. adults) with the 2 levels of the within-subjects \nfactor of Trait (bodily vs. knowledge-based traits) indicated that there was a main effect of trait, \nF(1, 32) = 41.09, p < .001, and a significant interaction of age by trait, F(1,32) = 13.60, p < .001, on \nthe number of birth parent resemblance judgments. Post hoc analyses show that this interaction is \ndue to the fact that children were significantly less likely than the adults to give birth judgments for \nbodily traits (t(32) = 2.38, p < .03) and significantly more likely than the adults to give birth \njudgments for knowledge-based traits (t(32) = 1.83, p < .04).  \nThere was one respect in which children as a group performed better on individual kind-\nneutral animal traits than they did on individual group-neutral human traits in Study 2. As can be \nseen in Table 13, children in the present study judged that the baby bird would have the bodily \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n124\n  \nfeatures of the birth mother 72% of the time, significantly more than chance, t(18) = 2.18, p < .03. \nThis finding is consistent with two possible interpretations: first, children understand that animal \nkind is fixed at birth, and reason about the bird\u2019s bodily properties as if they were kind-typical and \ntherefore fixed by kind (e.g., the color of a bird\u2019s tongue could be a kind-dependent morphological \nfeature rather than an idiosyncratic property of the individual); or, second, children are beginning to \nunderstand the biological inheritance of bodily features.  \nJustifications \nChildren\u2019s overall performance in the animal adoption task should allay methodological \nconcerns about the viability of our protocol. While it is certainly true that our tasks required Vezo \nchildren to interact with the researcher in a manner to which they were not accustomed, the \njustifications they provided in the course of the animal task indicate that they were not defeated by \nthe procedure. Seventy-four percent of Vezo children justified their species identity judgments. \nAlthough none of the children who made an adoptive judgment produced a justification, 88% of the \nchildren who made a birth judgment did so. Of these justifications, 50% were coded as Origins, \n28% were coded as Generated or Like Birth parent, 7% as Kind, and the remaining 14% were as \nOther. All of the Origins justifications explicitly mentioned the egg which had been laid by either \nduck or hen as the reason why the bird was of the same species as its birth mother (e.g., \u201cit will be a \nchicken because the hen laid the egg and the duck only sat on it\u201d or \u201cthe bird will be a chicken \nbecause the hen brought it out, it came from the hen\u2019s egg\u201d). These children, half of those providing \njustifications, successfully recruited their knowledge of a causal mechanism that goes beyond mere \nresemblance to parents in explaining why offspring are of the same species kind as their birth \nparent. \nRecall that in the human adoption scenarios presented in Study 2, the only children who had \noffered Origins justifications as explicit as those offered in the present study were those who were \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n125\n  \nexplaining their judgment that the boy would be Vezo or Karany like his birth father (e.g., \u201cbecause \nhe is Karany on his father\u2019s side, he came from the tummy of his [father\u2019s] wife, he is white, and he \nis Karany\u201d). Moreover, 42% of children giving birth judgments in the human task gave Origins \njustifications, just as 50% did so in the animal task, not significantly different. This is consistent \nwith the claim that children\u2019s birth kind judgments in the animal task and their birth group identity \njudgments in the Vezo-Karany task were motivated by a similar appreciation of the role of origins \nand procreation in determining kind in both animals and people. \n Children in Study 4 demonstrated a greater causal understanding of the mechanisms \ninvolved in the transmission of an individual\u2019s properties than did children in Study 2, as revealed \nby the fact that, as already noted, their judgements on bodily properties differed from chance, and \nby their justifications. A total of 30 justifications of property judgments were produced by 84% of \nthe children in this study, for an average of 1.6 per participant. Of all the justifications produced, \n37% were coded as Origins, 23% as Nurture, 3% as Kind, 10% as Like Birth parent or Generated, \n10% as Like Adoptive Parent or Raised, and 17% as Other. \nChildren in the animal task provided a higher proportion of causally informative \njustifications for their judgments on individual properties than did those in the human task (60% as \ncompared to 32%), with 67% of children ever giving such a causal justification in Study 4 as \nopposed to 18% of the children in Study 2, significantly more than would be expected by chance. \nMoreover, children in the animal task gave Origins justifications for 12% of their birth judgments \non individual properties, significantly more than the 0.2% of such justifications given for birth \njudgments in the human task, \u03a72(1) = 45.28, p < .001. Unlike the Origins justifications offered in \nthe human task, more than half of those produced on the animal task contained a reference to either \nthe offspring\u2019s \u201cline of descent\u201d, to the egg, or to the fact that the birth mother is the one \u201cwho \nbrought the bird out into the world\u201d. We saw earlier that adults gave explicit Kind justifications for \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n126\n  \ntheir birth judgments on individual properties 69% of the time, indicating that they inferred the \nproperties from species kind. Unlike adults, children gave Kind justifications only 5% of the time. \nOf course, children\u2019s Origins justifications may have been providing one important link in the same \nchain of reasoning, but we have no direct evidence that this is so. \nOne might argue that the reason children performed better in the animal task is not that they \nknow more about animals than about humans, but that they know more about mothers than about \nfathers. Indeed, Springer (1995, 1999) proposed that North American children\u2019s realization that \nbabies grow inside their mothers is a crucial step towards the elaboration of a biological (as opposed \nto social) conception of how offspring come to resemble their parents. One could argue that the \nreason Vezo children were so less likely to explicitly invoke birth as the mechanism responsible for \nthe transmission of bodily trait in our human task than in our animal task is that they are not yet \naware of the role that fathers play in reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we ran a version of the \nVezo-Vezo adoption task in which the adopted child was a girl, and the birth and adoptive parents \nwere mothers. Nineteen children, 10 boys and 9 girls aged 6 to 13, participated in this study. In \naccordance with the findings of a similar study with North American children (Solomon et al., \n1996), we found that Vezo children\u2019s responses (overall patterns of judgments and overall percent \nof birth judgments) were not significantly different from those of the children who participated in \nStudy 2. \nIn sum, when children were asked to justify their birth judgments on animal species identity, \nthey were able to invoke the bird\u2019s birth origins and to refer explicitly to relevant aspects of the \nreproductive process. The only other instance when children were so confident in their judgments \nand so articulate in their justifications was when they answered the group identity question in the \nVezo-Karany task. In the animal task, children were also more likely than in Study 2 to invoke the \nanimal\u2019s origins to explain why it comes to have the same individual properties as its birth mother. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n127\n  \nDiscussion \n As expected, adults demonstrated a naturalized and essentialized understanding of species \nkind, both in their judgments and justifications. In addition, they recruited their differentiated \nunderstanding of birth-mediated and nurture-based processes of trait determination to reason about \nthe transmission of kind-neutral properties from parents to offspring. Nonetheless, it is evident that \nsome of the adults occasionally deployed a different reasoning strategy: Not only they construed \nsome of the properties probed by our task as kind-dependent and therefore intrinsic to the baby bird, \nbut they also argued that animals such as chickens and ducks are unable to acquire any knowledge \nor skill that is not intrinsic to their species. In such cases, the mechanisms that mediate the \nacquisition of beliefs and skills in humans \u2013 teaching, practice, imitation \u2013 were not thought to \napply to animals. \n The findings about children are of particular importance. Methodologically, the results \nindicate that Vezo children are up to this task, in spite of being unschooled and not used to being \nquestioned systematically by adults. Theoretically, these data establish that an understanding of the \nrole of birth parentage in determining animal kind is available as an analogical base for extension to \nhuman group identity. Also, these data extend those of Atran et al. (2001), Gelman and Wellman \n(1991), Johnson & Solomon (1997), Medin & Atran (in press), Sousa et al. (2002) to yet another \ncultural context. In all cultural contexts studied so far, young children have been shown to \nunderstand the role of birth parentage in fixing species kind. In this case, therefore, we find \nsupporting evidence for the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis: cross-cultural universality in the \nadult state plus early acquisition in the face of culturally variable input. In Chapter VI, where we \nwill consider side by side the three patterns of development we have explored in this monograph \u2013 \nthe understanding of the determination of species kind, of human group identity, and of \nspecies\/group-neutral properties \u2013 we will discuss the merits and limitations of the Innate \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n128\n  \nConceptual Content hypothesis. We will then contrast it with an alternative account of the nature of \nthe innate constraints on learning in this domain (the Constrained Conceptual Construction \nhypothesis).  \nHere we limit ourselves to highlight three important aspects of the children\u2019s data. First, \nthese data overall confirm those of Johnson and Solomon (1997) concerning the much earlier \nemergence of the understanding of the role of birth parentage in the fixation of species kind than of \nthe role of birth parentage in the transmission of within-species individual traits. Vezo children were \nalmost as undifferentiated in their projection of family resemblance of bodily vs. knowledge-based \ntraits in this animal adoption scenario as they were in the human case, and in this they differed from \nthe adults with respect to both their birth parent resemblance judgments on bodily traits and their \nadoptive parent judgments on knowledge-based traits. This finding is consistent with the suggestion \nthat the birth parent resemblance judgments on kind were driven by children\u2019s essentialist construal \nof animal species, which posits that kind identity must remain constant throughout an individual\u2019s \nexistence. Thus, the reason children predicted that the baby bird was a duck like its birth mother \nmay not have been that they have a concept of innate potential; rather, the baby is a duck because it \nmust have already been a duck when it was born. \nSecond, children\u2019s justifications show that their understanding of the role of birth parentage \nin determining species kind goes beyond a mere understanding of family resemblance; half of the \nchildren explicitly mentioned the role of the mother in generating the egg. Still, this understanding \nfalls short of a full understanding of biological inheritance: the child could be reasoning, as Springer \n(1995) suggested, that the birth mother is the only animal who could have any causal effect on the \nbaby. We shall return to this proposal in the General Discussion.  \nThird, the species adoption study showed the first nascent understanding of biological \ninheritance in a stronger sense, one in which offspring are understood to get a template from their \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n129\n  \nbirth parents, which determines innate potential with respect to individual bodily traits.  This \nunderstanding has not reached the adult consolidated state even by age 13, but both in the non-\nrandom resemblance judgements for individual bodily traits and in the justifications for these \njudgments, we see some evidence that children are beginning to work out why being born of a duck \nmakes a baby a duck. \nIn Chapter IV we argued that it is in the process of understanding the adult performative \ntheory of Vezo identity that Vezo adolescents come to differentiate biological inheritance from \nsocial mechanisms of trait transmission. Chapter V underscores that, as they enter adolescence, \nVezo children already have access to one important piece of the differentiation \u2013 an understanding \nthat birth parentage fixes species kind, even if they have not yet fully worked out why this is so. \n \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n130\n  \nChapter VI \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \nIn the two domains that have been the subject of our studies, folkbiology and folksociology, we have \nfound evidence both for highly constrained development and for extended processes of conceptual \nconstruction. Many questions remain concerning the nature of the constraints and the details of the \nconstructive processes. We conclude our monograph with a discussion of these issues, beginning with \nthe domain of folkbiology. We believe our findings and the discussion that follows to be of equal \nsignificance to both psychologists and anthropologists. However, we especially address the last \nsection of this chapter to anthropologists. \nFolkbiology: on understanding why ducks have baby ducks \n In the introduction to this monograph we laid out two predictions of the Innate Conceptual \nContent hypothesis: cross-cultural universality in adult representations and early emergence in \ndevelopment. Our data on the representations of species as naturalized (i.e., as inherited from birth \nparents) and essentialized (i.e., as having rich inductive potential) would seem to confirm both of \nthese two predictions. \nEven the youngest Vezo children we were able to test (age 6) succeeded in the animal \nadoption task: They predicted that a bird that emerges from an egg laid by a duck will be a duck, even \nif hatched and raised by a chicken. In this regard, Vezo children resemble those (even younger \nchildren) who have been tested on this task in a number of other cultural contexts (unschooled \nYukatek Maya children in Mexico, Atran, et al., 2001; middle-class children in Brazil, Sousa et al., \n2002; urban and rural, native-American and majority lower- and middle-class children in the United \nStates, Johnson & Solomon, 1997, Medin & Atran, in press). Moreover, in all of these cultural venues \nadults also shared the same intuitions. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n131\n  \n The evidence therefore indicates that the knowledge that species kind is fixed at birth arises \nrelatively early in development, continues to articulate adult representations, and appears to be \ncross-culturally universal. Crucially, this knowledge emerges under widely divergent conditions of \ninput (e.g., Vezo children have direct experience with animal reproduction whereas North American \nchildren have limited exposure to it), as would be expected if its acquisition were constrained by \ncognitive capacities that the child brings to the task of conceptual development. We accept this \nconclusion. The nature of those constraints, however, remains very much an open question.  \nTwo quite different possibilities are consistent with the available data. The first (the Innate \nConceptual Content hypothesis) is that the child is endowed with innate knowledge of species kinds, \nin which kind membership is both naturalized and essentialized. That is, the child assumes animal \nspecies to have rich inductive potential and expects species kind to be fixed by biologically relevant \nmechanisms. In other words, the child is equipped with a folkbiological module, as Medin and Atran \n(Atran, 1998; Medin & Atran, in press) suggest. \nThe second possibility (the Constrained Conceptual Construction hypothesis) is that the \nchild is endowed with powerful but domain-general theory building mechanisms that underlie the \ncapacity to recognize and essentialize natural kinds and to analyze and construct causal explanatory \ntheories of the essential features of such kinds. However, each child must discover anew which \nkinds in the world are natural kinds, including biological kinds, and must construct theory-specific \ncausal mechanisms for the domain of biology (see Carey, 1985, 1999, and Gelman, 2003, for a \ndefense of this view). One such biological mechanism is the inheritance of species kind. \nFollowing this second line of reasoning, Springer (1995, 1999) has sketched the process \nthrough which children might construct a biological understanding of inheritance, which we \nelaborate here, drawing also from Gelman\u2019s analysis (2003). The rich inductive potential of animal \nkinds is amply available to young children, who learn many properties that can be reliably predicted \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n132\n  \nfrom kind membership. In addition, parents often use generics in talking about animal kinds. North-\nAmerican parents make such statements as \u201cdogs can be vicious; lions hunt and eat antelopes; \nsalmon are delicious to eat\u201d, and Vezo parents say such things as \u201cmackerel are very smart and are \nnot fooled by poorly prepared bait; chameleons have ugly faces; geckoes are useful because they eat \nmosquitoes\u201d). These cues enable the child to identify species kinds as natural kinds, that is, as \nfalling within the scope of psychological essentialist reasoning (Medin & Ortony, 1989).  \nSignificantly, the identification of species kinds as natural kinds entails analyzing them as \n\u201csubstance sortals\u201d (Carey & Xu, 1999): kinds that trace identity throughout the existence of an \nindividual and for which there are hidden, unknown causal processes that explain their existence and \nsurface properties. In turn, identification of species kinds as substance sortals leads children to focus \non origins \u2013 on the onset of that identity which will persist through time. As Springer pointed out, \nonce children have represented \u201cduck\u201d as a substance sortal, they know that any individual duck is a \nduck throughout its whole existence. Moreover, as soon as children learn about the facts of birth, they \nwill also know that the duck\u2019s existence begins before birth (i.e., the animal existed inside the egg \nthat grew in the mother\u2019s tummy). At this point, domain-general assumptions about causal processes \n(e.g., that causes act locally and by proximity) may lead children to realize that the kind of the mother \ndetermines the kind of the baby growing inside her. Springer (1995) provided evidence for this \nanalysis, showing that only children who knew that babies grow inside their mothers solved certain \nswitched at birth tasks, and that teaching uninformed children the facts of birth led them to succeed \nwhere they had previously failed (but see Solomon & Johnson, 2000, and Williams & Affleck, 1999 \nfor qualifications of this finding). On this account, it is entirely possible that the understanding of the \nfixation of animal kind observed universally by ages 4 to 6 years does not reflect innate knowledge \nwith specifically biological content, but rather is the result of a process of learning and discovery \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n133\n  \nwhich is constrained by powerful domain-general theory building capacities and is supported by the \ntestimony which children receive and use to make sense of the world. \nThe two possibilities outlined above are importantly different: one posits innate conceptual \nconstraints with biological content (i.e., the concepts animal, species, and biological inheritance), \nwhereas the other posits powerful domain general constraints on theory building (the capacity for \ncausal analysis, a commitment to psychological essentialism, the capacity to recognize natural kinds). \nHowever, they are also importantly similar \u2013 by comparison with the Unconstrained Learning \nhypothesis \u2013 in so far as the output of the developmental process is, by ages 4 to 6, a biological theory \nof animal species that further constrains conceptual development. \nWe consider the exact nature of the constraints that support the early naturalization and \nessentialization of species kind in all cultural contexts studied to date to be an open question. Data in \nsupport of the Constrained Conceptual Construction hypothesis would include within child \nconsistency in understanding animals as living things, death as the breakdown of the bodily machine, \nand birth parentage as determining species kind (see Slaughter & Lyons, 2003; Solomon & Johnson, \n2000). Insofar as 3-year-olds truly lack these concepts, and insofar as these concepts are mutually \nconstructed in the course of development, the Constrained Conceptual Construction hypothesis would \nbe favored. Insofar as young preschool children are shown to possess these concepts in a variety of \ndifferent cultural contexts, and to acquire them independently from other aspects of folkbiological \nknowledge, the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis would be favored instead. \nAlthough we believe both possibilities to be open, we favor the Constrained Conceptual \nConstruction hypothesis for several reasons. First, as mentioned in the Introduction, there is evidence \nthat North American 4- to 6-year-old do not possess a robust understanding of biological inheritance \neven in the case of species kind fixation (see Keil\u2019s 1989 transformation and discovery studies). \nSecond, North American children do not construct other biological concepts (e.g., living thing, death) \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n134\n  \nuntil around age 5 or 6 (Slaughter et al., 1999), while they cannot represent animal species as living \nthings until they have created a vitalist biology at the end of the preschool years (Inagaki & Hatano, \n2002). Third, several studies (reviewed in the Introduction) have shown that young children do not \ndifferentiate biological inheritance from social learning mechanisms of inter-generational trait \ntransmission until around age 6 or 7 (in the North American samples) or until adolescence or even \nlater (in the Tamil, Zafimaniry and Vezo samples). This is exactly what we would expect if children \nhad an initial understanding that ducks can only ever be ducks and have baby ducks, while not yet \nfully understanding the deeper biological reason for why this is so. As Johnson and Solomon (1997) \nput it, children can understand that dogs have baby dogs before they grasp that the baby is a dog \nbecause its birth parent were dogs. Only when children understand that birth parents pass on to their \noffspring the potential to become a dog, and the potential to develop certain dog-like properties, have \nthey fully fleshed out their understanding of this biological process. \nThe Constrained Conceptual Construction hypothesis makes sense of both aspects of the \nresults from these cross-cultural studies: the early emergence of a naturalized and essentialized \nconstrual of species kind and the protracted process by which children come to understand that some \nof an individual\u2019s traits are determined by biological inheritance and some by learning, teaching and \nhabituation. On this story, preschool children identify animal species as natural kinds, attend to their \norigins before birth, and thus realize that birth parentage determines species kind. Then, over the next \nseveral years, they construct an understanding of how people and animals come to have their \nindividual properties. This will require them to differente biological inheritance from socially-\nmediated learning. \nFolkbiology: on understanding a crucial difference \n \nThe results of our within-species adoption tasks paint a very different picture concerning \ninnate constraints on the developmental process. We found cross-cultural convergence in the adults\u2019 \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n135\n  \nunderstanding of biological inheritance \u2013 contrary to the prediction of the Unconstrained Learning \nhypothesis \u2013 but we did not observe the early emergence and universal developmental trajectory \npredicted by the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis. \nIn our adoption tasks, Vezo adults systematically differentiated between two causal \nmechanisms for the inter-generational transmission of different kinds of properties. Like North \nAmerican adults, they held the view that bodily properties are inherited through links of filiation \n(hence the child\u2019s resemblance to the birth parent), and that beliefs and skills are transmitted through \nlearning and teaching (hence the child\u2019s resemblance to the adoptive parent). Vezo adults showed a \nremarkable consistency in their reasoning irrespective of whether the adoption was said to have taken \nplace among Vezo people or between Vezo and Masikoro or Karany families, whether it was said to \nhave taken place among unrelated people or among close relatives, or whether our questions targeted \nthe transmission of properties from father to son or from mother to daughter (as in Astuti et al., in \npreparation). We shall have more to say about the significance of this finding in the final section. \nVezo children aged 6 to 13, however, did not differentiate between birth or adoptive parentage \nor between family resemblance on bodily traits and family resemblance on beliefs and skills. This \nfailure was repeatedly observed in separate scenarios in Study 2, irrespective of whether the traits \nwere group neutral (e.g., the shape of the ears, the ability to make ropes, or beliefs such as how many \nteeth chameleons have) or group typical (e.g., skin color, occupational skills and customary beliefs). \nThe same failure was also observed in the animal adoption scenario of Study 4. This robust finding is \nnot simply the result of unrealistic task demands. Consider that both in the species adoption task and \nin the Vezo-Karany task children were able to coordinate consistently and systematically their \nspecies- and group-identity judgments and justifications. This shows that, after a long series of \nquestions, the children were still with us. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n136\n  \nOur results replicate the findings of Bloch et al. (2001) among the Zafimaniry and those of \nMahalingham (1998) in India, both of which showed that it was not until adolescence or later that the \nmajority of participants succeeded on this task. They are also consistent with the finding that the great \nmajority of North American and European children do not differentiate biological inheritance from \nsocial learning before the age of 6 to 7 (Gimenez & Harris, 2002; Solomon, 2002; Solomon et al., \n1996; Springer, 1996; Springer & Keil, 1989; Weissman & Kalish, 1999; Williams & Affleck, 1999). \nWe take these data as evidence against the claim that preschool children have a biological \nunderstanding of family resemblance (e.g., Atran et al., 2001; Hirschfeld, 1996). And this, in turn, we \ntake as a challenge to the hypothesis that concepts such as biological inheritance, birth parentage, \ninnate potential are part of children\u2019s innate conceptual repertoire. \nConsistent with this conclusion is the finding that differences in input conditions have a \ndramatic influence on the emergence of these concepts, as shown by the fact that Vezo children take \nso much longer than their North American counterparts to construct a differentiated understanding of \nfamily resemblance. As we discussed in Chapter 4, there are a number of possible reasons for this \ndevelopmental difference, among them the fact that Vezo children are virtually unschooled, and that \nthey are actively discouraged from asking questions and from engaging in analytical reasoning. \nMoreover, as reported in the Introduction, Vezo children receive testimony that systematically \nconfounds the distinction between the effects of birth and nurture (e.g., babies resemble people \nbefriended or disliked by their mothers) so that their parents, in effect, train them not to see that \npeople who are biologically related resemble one another. Indeed, in the face of such systematic \ninput, it is a remarkable testimony to Vezo children\u2019s theory-building capacities that by adolescence \nthey construct the same differentiated understanding of inter-generational trait transmission that has \nbeen documented in India, Europe and the US. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n137\n  \nApart from indicating that this constructive process takes considerably longer to unfold in \nMadagascar than it does in North America, our data also suggest that the cultural environment that \nscaffolds the conceptual development of Vezo children may exert some influence on the specific \nsteps that they take towards constructing and consolidating a differentiated understanding of family \nresemblance. \nThere are likely to be several inputs into children\u2019s constructive process, some of which we \ndo not expect to vary across cultural contexts. For example, representations of intentional agents \nought to be part of the relevant input, as these are implicated in the understanding of teaching and \nlearning. The cross-cultural universality of theory of mind, which would support such \nrepresentations, has not been the focus of this monograph (see Avis & Harris, 1991), but given the \nevidence for conceptual representations of intentional agents in preverbal infants (Csibra et al., \n1999; Gergely et al. 1995; Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Johnson, Slaughter, & Carey, 1998; Johnson, \n2000; Woodward, 1998), conceptual content in this domain is likely to be innately specified. \nAnother source of input is the understanding of the biological determination of animal kinds. As \nshown in Study 4, Vezo children are in the midst of deepening their understanding that birth \nparentage determines species kind, as they begin to recognize that something inherited from birth \nparents also determines species-specific somatic traits and some somatic traits that vary within \nspecies. As discussed above, whether this understanding is in turn the result of innate conceptual \ncontent constraints or of a constrained process of construction is still open to debate. What the \nexisting cross-cultural evidence reveals, however, is the remarkable uniformity in the emergence of \nthis understanding. \nGranted these similarities, we were able to identify one source of the constructive process \nthat appears to be specific to the cultural environment in which Vezo children grow up. By looking \nat those adolescents who were still in the throes of working out a fully differentiated understanding \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n138\n  \nof the causal role of birth parentage and social learning in the transmission of an individual\u2019s \nproperties, we found that they first gained their conceptual purchase on this differentiation through \nan understanding of the acquisition of skills. Notwithstanding that children, in fact, tend to share the \nskills of their birth parents who commonly raise them, even those adolescents who showed an \noverall Mixed pattern of judgments (and so did not have a fully differentiated understanding of the \ntransmission of an individual\u2019s properties) had come to realize that skills are learned, not inherited. \nSimilarly, they knew that customs, religious beliefs, and occupational specializations are acquired \nthrough practice and habituation, rather than by descent. It should not be surprising that Vezo \nadolescents begin by reflecting on, and understanding the transmission of skills and customary \n\u201cways of doing things\u201d, since these are the properties that are said to determine a person\u2019s group \nidentity. If there is one thing that is afforded by the Vezo cultural environment, by Vezo adults\u2019 \ntestimony, it is the notion that people learn, get used to, and take on the livelihood, skills, and \ncustoms of the place where they live. It is likely that Vezo adolescents find it particularly easy to \nrecruit this notion in theory building. \nWe do not know whether this is a universal pattern of development, but we suggest that \nprobably it is not. It is likely that in other cultural contexts children\u2019s attention is drawn to the \ntransmission of other properties. For example, in societies where the inheritance of a certain kind of \nblood or of a certain kind of bones is taken to mediate people\u2019s affiliation to specific descent or \nethnic groups, children may come to realize the significance of birth origins in the transmission of \nbodily traits before they understand the role of learning and habituation in the acquisition of skills. \nThis, of course, is an empirical question, that could be answered with more comparative work. \nFolksociology: on understanding what kind of people they are \n \n Our data on how Vezo children learn the adult performative theory of group identity presents \nus with yet another developmental trajectory. In this case, we have found evidence of early emerging \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n139\n  \nconstraints on conceptual development, which are transcended as a result of a protracted process of \ncultural construction. \nAs before, we shall start with the adult end-state: Vezo adults\u2019 performance in our across-\ngroup adoption scenarios confirmed Astuti\u2019s (1995a, 1995b) ethnographically-based claim that \nVezo define group identity in terms of the occupational activities that people perform, the \ncustomary practices they follow, and the religious beliefs they hold, rather than in terms of their \nbirth origins and ancestral roots. Vezo adults explicitly and often apply this way of reasoning to \nVezo children (and how it is that they become Vezo) or to the neighboring Masikoro (and how it is \nthat they could become Vezo). Crucially, our adult informants also extended their performative way \nof categorizing people to the Karany: they reasoned that a child born of Vezo parents and adopted \nby Karany parents would become Karany (or vice versa). In keeping with their differentiated \nunderstanding of family resemblance, adults judged that the adopted child would have the same skin \ncolor and hair type as his birth parents, but that he would learn how to behave, what to believe, and \nhow to earn a living from his adoptive parents. Because of these acquired properties, they judged \nthat he would have the same group identity as his adoptive parents, be they Vezo or Karany.  \nIt is of consequence that Vezo adults did not extend their performative theory of identity to \nanimal species. This finding underscores the fact that Vezo adults categorically differentiate between \nhuman groups and animal species, and that they do not treat the former as if they were natural \nbiological kinds. Although we did not test them on a task involving an adoption across human and \nnon-human animal species, Vezo adults\u2019 performance in the species adoption task (plus their \nunderstanding of biological inheritance) makes it almost certain that they would construe humans qua \nhumans as a natural kind. Like chickens and ducks, humans are what they were born to be (although, \nunlike chickens and ducks, they may need other humans to realize their potential humanity; see \nLambek, 1981, p.150). However, the group identity of humans, as opposed to the species identity of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n140\n  \nhumans, turns out to be determined by the culturally constituted environment in which people grow \nup, rather than by their innate potential for developing into certain kinds of people. \nThis finding challenges the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis, which claims that, as a \nresult of their evolutionary history, humans are bound to apprehend the social world as made up of \ndistinct natural kinds. Like the ethnographic data (Astuti, 1995a, 1995b), our experimental data do \nnot support either Hirschfeld\u2019s or Gil-White\u2019s hypotheses. Given the social, economic and cultural \ncontext of Madagascar, we chose the Karany \u2013 people of Indo-Pakistani descent, who are \nsomatically, economically, and religiously distinct from the Vezo and do not inter-marry with them \u2013 \nas the most likely group to trigger Hirschfeld\u2019s Human Kind Competences or to prime Gil-White\u2019s \nhypothesized tendency to treat endogamous groups as if they were animal species. Our results \nstrongly suggest that not all adult human minds are bound to partition the social world into \nnaturalized human kinds. However, our data also suggest that, despite the cultural input they receive, \nthe minds of Vezo children are inclined to do so.  \nVezo children overwhelmingly judged that a child born to parents belonging to one group \n(the Vezo) and raised by parents belonging to another (the Karany) would be Vezo (or vice versa); \nin other words, they reasoned that people are born to be what they are. The relatively early \nemergence of this way of reasoning and, crucially, the fact that it is unsupported by \u2013 in fact, it flies \nin the face of \u2013 the cultural input that children receive about how one becomes Vezo, suggest that it \nis constrained by cognitive capacities that the child brings to the task of making sense of the social \nworld. To be sure, the group of people who are explicitly targeted by adult testimony are the \nMasikoro, not the Karany, but if learning to sail, to fish, and to participate in Vezo cultural practices \nis what makes one Vezo, then this should apply to all people. Indeed, this was the view expressed \nby our adult participants. The child\u2019s understanding, it would seem, derives from a source other \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n141\n  \nthan adult testimony, and the constraints under which it emerges are powerful enough to withstand \nthat testimony, at least until adolescence. \nThis leads us to ask what these constraints might be. As before, there are two quite different \nanswers to this question. On the one hand, children\u2019s reasoning about the Karany could reflect an \ninnate system of knowledge that places content rich constraints on the representations of human \nkinds (the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis); on the other hand, this same reasoning could be \nthe output of domain-general theory building capacities (the Constrained Conceptual Construction \nhypothesis). \nThe first possibility, then, is that either Hirschfeld (1996) or Gil-White (2001) is right in \nclaiming that reasoning about human kinds is constrained by an evolved mental disposition that \ndelivers the concept natural human kind. On Hirschfeld\u2019s proposal, the Human Kind Competence \nwould account for the fact that Vezo children naturalize some human kinds, while the political \neconomy of the region would explain why the Karany (rather than the Masikoro) is the group that is \nin fact naturalized in this context (e.g., children may be sensitive to the fact that the interaction \nbetween Vezo and Karany is markedly hierarchical, as when Vezo approach Karany shops or offer \ntheir fish to Karany buyers). Gil-White\u2019s proposal is more problematic. He argues that endogamy is \nthe crucial trigger that leads people to \u201cmistake\u201d ethnic groups for animal species, but it is not clear \nwhat sort of developmental account is implied by his claim. We know that Vezo adults do not make \nthis \u201cmistake\u201d, and it is unlikely that children as young as 6 would realize, and find salient, the fact \nthat Vezo and Karany people do not intermarry (see Gelman, 2003, p. 304 for a similar point). \nThe second possibility is that children\u2019s reasoning reflects domain-general theory building \ncapacities. As described by students of the history of science (Gentner et al., 1997; Nersessian, 1992), \nthe bootstrapping processes that lead to theory construction often involve analogical thinking. \nChildren, as suggested by Atran (1990), may analogize human kinds to species kinds not because of \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n142\n  \nsome evolved tendency to do so (as Gil-White would have it), but because of the productive use of \nanalogy in building explanatory understanding in general. \nWe consider both the Innate Conceptual Content hypothesis and the Constrained Conceptual \nConstruction hypothesis still open, although, as before, we favor the latter one for some of the same \nreasons. First, our data did not support Hirschfeld\u2019s claim (1995, 1996) that even preschool children \nunderstand that skin color and other racial somatic markers are determined by birth parentage and \nthat, therefore, kind identity is also so determined; it was not until adolescence that Vezo \nparticipants had worked out the biological inheritance of skin color and hair type (see also Solomon, \n2002). Given the pivotal role played by the early emergence of this understanding in Hirschfeld\u2019s \noverall argument, the fact that it takes Vezo children a laborious and drawn-out process to construct \nsuch an understanding militates against his proposal. By contrast, the finding that Vezo children \nunderstand that species kind is determined by birth parentage is certainly consistent with the \nConstrained Conceptual Construction hypothesis, since it indicates that children command the base \ndomain for analogizing the difference between Vezo and Karany to a species difference. Similarly, \nthe fact that children\u2019s justifications of their birth judgments in the Vezo-Karany and in the animal \ntasks were strikingly similar (they explicitly invoked the process of reproduction, e.g., the mother\u2019s \ntummy or the egg) is also consistent with the hypothesis that children were recruiting their \nunderstanding of the role of birth parentage in fixing animal kind when reasoning about the contrast \nbetween Vezo and Karany.  \nThe proposal that children analogize human to species kinds needs an account of what \ntriggers this analogy for some human groups and not others. Recall that Vezo children naturalized \nthe difference between Vezo and Karany but not the difference between Vezo and Masikoro. A \npossible explanation for this finding is that, as suggested by Atran (1990, p.78), \u201capparent \nmorphological distinctions between human groups are easily (but not necessarily) conceived as \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n143\n  \napparent morphological distinctions between animal species\u201d. Quite simply, whereas marked and \nstable morphological differences exist between Vezo and Karany (e.g., skin color), none exist \nbetween Vezo and Masikoro. If morphological differences motivate the analogy between animal \nspecies and human groups, children should have no reasons to construe the Masikoro as a different \nspecies \u2013 and indeed they did not. \nOther factors, however, may trigger the naturalization of a human kind. Rothbart and Taylor \n(1992) suggested that social categories are often perceived more like natural kinds, despite the fact \nthat they are more like human artifacts, because of their rich inductive potential. In the same way in \nwhich people expect the category \u201ctiger\u201d to be predictive of an almost infinite number of tiger \nproperties, people assume that if a social category has an almost infinite number of properties, then it \nmust be of the tiger sort, that is, it must be a natural kind. Vezo, Masikoro and Karany are inductively \nrich categories, so to label individuals as Vezo, Masikoro, or Karany is predictive of an almost \ninfinite number of properties: where they live, their occupations, whether they are rich or poor, \nwhether they are literate, what rituals they perform, their hairstyle, their demeanor, their clothes, their \nspeech, their cuisine, and so on and so forth. True, it is likely that children are not aware of all the \nproperties that are typical of Vezo, Masikoro, and Karany people, but they are certainly aware of the \nfact that these labels are predictive of many properties, and this may be enough for them to construe \nthe groups as natural kinds. On this story, children would be expected to naturalize the Masikoro as \nwell as the Karany, since both are equally inductively rich categories. The reason our children did not \nin fact naturalize the Masikoro could be that they have learned \u2013 rather, that they were learning \u2013 not \nto do so. In other words, were it not for the massive cultural input they receive, which specifically \ntargets their immediate neighbors, children would have naturalized both Masikoro and Karany group \nidentities. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n144\n  \nThere are thus two hypotheses concerning what may trigger the analogy between animal \nspecies and human kinds: first, the stable somatic differences between Vezo and Karany (which \nwould explain why the Vezo-Masikoro was not naturalized) and second, the inductive richness of the \ncategories (in which case direct adult testimony regarding the Masikoro would explain why the Vezo-\nMasikoro contrast was not naturalized). Further studies could decide between these two hypotheses. \nChildren could be introduced to a novel and unfamiliar group of people, whose morphological \nfeatures are identical to those of the Vezo, but whose place of residence, livelihood, skills, religious \nbeliefs, and customs are markedly different. At issue is whether, in the absence of adult testimony \nand in the absence of morphological differences, but in the presence of a rich cluster of typical \nproperties, children would naturalize this novel group as they did the Karany. If they did, the \ninductive richness hypothesis would be supported. \nOne aspect of our existing data seems to offer some support to the hypothesis that, \nirrespective of morphological similarity, children might construe the Masikoro just as they construe \nthe Karany (i.e., as a natural kind) were it not for the cultural induction they receive. In Chapter 3, \nwe described the pervasiveness of the testimony that Vezo children receive from adults regarding \nhow people \u2013 the children themselves \u2013 become Vezo or Masikoro. Children are told that they are \nbecoming Vezo when they learn how to swim, or when they successfully catch and sell fish, and \nwhenever they fail to act in Vezo fashion they are taunted that they are Masikoro. In light of this, it \nis certainly not surprising that by age 6 most children have learned something important about the \nnature of their group identity, as was demonstrated by their adult-like answers to our group identity \nquestion in the Vezo-Masikoro scenario. They knew that a Vezo boy raised by Masikoro would \nbecome Masikoro and that a Masikoro child raised by Vezo would become Vezo. More surprising, \nhowever, is that, despite this massive cultural input, a third of the children flatly contradicted that \ninput and judged that the adopted boy would be Vezo or Masikoro like his birth father. Moreover, \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n145\n  \nthe rest of the children failed to show evidence of the coherent causal reasoning that is implicit in \nthe adult testimony (i.e., they failed to attribute to the adopted boy the properties that make him a \nmember of his adoptive group). We speculate that one of the reasons for this shaky performance is \nthat the children who participated in the Vezo-Masikoro task were still influenced by the same \nstrong intuition that guided children who participated in the Vezo-Karany task: that human kinds \nare natural kinds. \nThis finding forcefully illustrates the point that children are not passive recipients of ready-\nmade cultural beliefs, but are actively engaged in the process of making culture. In this process, they \nmay create representations that conflict with the adult cultural consensus. As suggested by our \nstudies, these representations are likely to influence the way children construe (and distort) the \ntestimony they receive from their cultural environment, and that they significantly constrain and \nenable the process of cultural transmission. This should make children\u2019s representations, and the \nchildren who produce them, far more central to anthropological research than they have been (as \nnoted by, for example, Boyer, 1994; Hirschfeld, 2002; Schwartz, 1981; Toren, 1999). \nWe know, for example, that in many parts of the world adults continue to subscribe to the idea \nthat human kinds are natural kinds, which are inherently different from each other because of their \ndifferent underlying essences (e.g., Abu-Lughod, 1986; Empson, 2002; Errington, 1989; Fortes, \n1945; Gil-White, 2001). Granted that there are bound to be a variety of historical, political, and \neconomic factors \u2013 \u201cmind-external factors\u201d, as Sperber (2001) would call them \u2013 that explain why \nsome populations construe human groups as natural kinds, while others construe them \nperformatively, as the Vezo do. However, it follows from our findings that a comparative analysis of \nthese different outcomes must take into account the knowledge that children bring to the task of \nlearning about the social world. The aim of the analysis would be to explain how, in different \nhistorical and cultural contexts, children\u2019s understanding is transformed, reinforced, or overturned. \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n146\n  \nIt is somewhat ironic, in view of the anthropological claim that many non-western peoples are \nontological monists (i.e., that they do not distinguish biological from social processes), that \nunderstanding the difference between biological inheritance and socially-mediated learning plays a \ncrucial role in the developmental process which leads Vezo children to overturn the intuition that \nhuman groups are natural kinds and to embrace the adult performative theory of group identity. Our \ndata show that only those adolescents whose resemblance judgments on individual properties fully \ndifferentiated between the causal roles of birth parentage and learning, were like Vezo adults in all \naspects of their reasoning about group identity and group typical properties. This suggests that \nunderstanding the difference between birth and nurture is necessary for understanding what it means \nto be Vezo. Conversely, making sense of what it means to be Vezo may motivate children to \ndifferentiate between birth and nurture. The fact that Vezo children initially subscribe to the view that \nbirth parentage fixes human group identity may explain why the discovery that birth origins are \nirrelevant to the determination of this property of the person would lead them to reflect on, and to \ndiscover, which other properties (the shape of the ears, the color of the skin) are instead so \ndetermined. And so, as Vezo children learn how and why they are Vezo, they also learn how and why \nbabies resemble their birth parents in their physiognomy. What they will have to understand next is \nwhy their parents and elders find it so important to deny that resemblance. It is to this last issue that \nwe now turn. \nOn anthropological interpretation \nVezo adults who participated in our studies systematically took the view that the bodily \nproperties of adopted children resemble those of their birth parents because, for example, that is \nwhere they got their \u201ctemplate\u201d from, and that adopted children share the beliefs and skills of their \nadoptive parents because, for example, these parents are their \u201cschool\u201d. In other words, Vezo adults \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n147\n  \nclearly and explicitly differentiated between different mechanisms for the inter-generational \ntransmission of properties. \nWe have taken the understanding of the distinct causal roles of birth parentage and socially-\nmediated learning as evidence that participants have a theory of biological inheritance, and that this \ntheory is predicated on the ontological distinction between \u201cfacts of biology\u201d and \u201cfacts of sociality\u201d. \nAs discussed in the Introduction, it is common for anthropologists to claim that this distinction is a \npeculiar feature of the western intellectual tradition and that it is foreign to most non-western peoples. \nOur data do not support that claim.  \nIt is important to stress that by concluding that Vezo make the same ontological cut as do \nNorth Americans, we do not wish to imply that their concepts of biological inheritance and socially-\nmediated learning map exactly onto the equivalent concepts held by North American adults. Given \nthe different intellectual traditions and socio-economic contexts in which these concepts get \nconstructed, this claim would be daft. Indeed, the analysis of our participants\u2019 justifications has \nrevealed some significant differences. Recall, for example, that those informants who judged that the \nadopted boy would share the same beliefs as his birth father invoked a variety of supernatural and \npsychological interventions, such as spirits or God acting as messengers for the dead father, or the \nchild\u2019s intuitive resistance towards the beliefs of his adoptive parents. We surmise that North \nAmerican adults would not share these views. On their part, few Vezo adults elaborated on the causal \nmechanism by which children come to resemble their birth parents in their bodily properties; \nwhenever they did, they gave no indication of being familiar with western accounts of biological \ninheritance in terms of genetic coding. Notwithstanding these differences, we stand by the claim that \nVezo and North American concepts of biological inheritance and socially-mediated learning are \ncommensurable to one another, in so far as they play the same inferential role in adult reasoning \nabout family resemblance.  \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n148\n  \nIn the Introduction we reported a number of striking statements articulated by Vezo adults \nregarding the physiognomy of their \u201cwater-babies\u201d (e.g., that babies come to resemble people who \nare not biologically related to them). It is important to appreciate that these (or similar) statements \ncould be interpreted as evidence that Vezo (or other non-western peoples) are ontological monists: \nThat they do not draw the distinction between \u201cfacts of biology\u201d and \u201cfacts of sociality\u201d. The \nsignificance of our data lies in the challenge they pose to this way of interpreting the ethnographic \nevidence, which has arguably become the dominant one in contemporary anthropology. Against this \nbackground, our conclusion that, despite what they say, Vezo adults are not ontological monists has \nat least two important theoretical implications for anthropologists (see also Astuti, 2001). \nFirst, recall that much of the critique of the study of kinship was predicated on the claim that \nkinship theorists had based their comparative work on the ethnocentric distinction between the \nbiological ties engendered by human reproduction (e.g., the biological tie between birth parents and \ntheir offspring) and the social and cultural meanings attributed to them (e.g., the extension of the \nterms father and mother to people other than the birth parents): A distinction between \u201cbiology\u201d and \n\u201csociality\u201d which the people whose kinship was the object of study allegedly did not make. By \nshowing that Vezo adults in fact discriminate between \u201cfacts of biology\u201d and \u201cfacts of sociality\u201d, \nour results suggest that the claim of ontological incommensurability has been greatly exaggerated, \nand that therefore cross-cultural comparison is not impossible. \nSecond, our discovery that Vezo adults know why offspring resemble their birth parents \n(statements about \u201cwater-babies\u201d notwithstanding) should compel anthropologists to recognize that \ninformants\u2019 explicit discourse may not be a reliable indication of their conceptual knowledge and \nontological commitments. This point has been made before, in different forms and contexts (e.g., \nBloch, 1977, 1998; Bourdieu, 1985; Boyer, 2001; Firth, 1985; Leach, 1966; Sperber, 1985, 1996; \nSpiro, 1993). Nonetheless, it is still common for anthropologists to rely on the common sense \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n149\n  \nassumption that people\u2019s concepts can be inferred from everyday discourse, and to miss the point that \nmuch cultural practice and discourse is a reflection and commentary on people\u2019s knowledge, not its \narticulation (see Bloch, 1998; in preparation). This point, we believe, applies to our case study, as we \nhope to demonstrate herewith.  \nClearly, as far as the interpretative aim of anthropology is concerned, the conclusion that \nVezo adults have constructed an understanding of biological inheritance should be taken as no more \nthan a starting point, for we are left to explain why, if adults know that human physiognomy is \ndetermined by the \u201ctemplate\u201d that babies inherit from the parents who generated them, they insist that \ntheir children resemble people other than their birth parents. One possibility is that our adoption task \ntaps a systematically different type of mental representation than does everyday discourse, perhaps \nmore implicit and less accessible to conscious reflection. We accept that intrinsic differences between \ntypes of mental representations exist. For example, the representations that articulate early emerging \nknowledge in the domains of intuitive physics, intuitive psychology, and number, are the output of \ndedicated perceptual input analyzers (Carey & Spelke, 1994), and it is most unlikely that they can \nfind expression in a linguistic format. However, we doubt that the mismatch between Vezo adults\u2019 \nperformance in our adoption paradigm and their explicit cultural discourse is due to the different \nnature of the mental representations involved, as is suggested by the fact that, in their justifications, \nVezo adults were fully capable of explicitly articulating the knowledge tapped by our task. \nRather, we speculate that the apparent conflict in conceptual representations is caused by \npeople\u2019s deliberate contradiction of their understanding of biological inheritance. In other words, \nwhen Vezo adults say that a baby looks like the person his mother befriended when she was pregnant, \nor that a wandering spirit has changed the baby\u2019s features, they elect to ignore their knowledge that \nthe baby looks like the birth parents. If so, the interpretative aim becomes to explain why Vezo adults \ncontradict, ignore, or do not attend to what we know they know.   \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n150\n  \nWe suggest that Vezo statements about babies\u2019 physiognomy should be interpreted as one \ninstance of a much wider strategy by which Vezo avoid drawing attention to the exclusivity of the \nbiological relations between birth parents and their children. As argued elsewhere (Astuti, 2000a), the \nnotion that children \u201cbelong\u201d to more people than their birth parents (and that grandchildren and great \ngrandchildren \u201cbelong\u201d to more people than their grandparents and great grandparents) is central to \nVezo kinship and to the realization of people\u2019s most valued aim in life: to reach old age surrounded \nby a vast number of descendants. While this objective is inherent to the Vezo undifferentiated system \nof kinship reckoning, which is inclusive rather than exclusive, people also actively pursue this end in \ntheir everyday practices. For example, although children tend to be raised by their birth parents, it is \nconsidered highly immoral and unforgivingly rude for such parents to assert their unique rights or \nduties over their children. By contrast, every effort is made to break down the biological boundaries \nthat demarcate individual family units \u2013 for example, by encouraging children to eat from any of the \nkitchens of their numerous \u201cparents\u201d (e.g., mother\u2019s sisters, mother\u2019s brothers, father\u2019s sisters, \nfather\u2019s brothers, and so on). Although there is a well-understood practical advantage in sharing \nchildren in this way, an important effect of this practice is that it minimizes the significance of the \ndistinctions created by biological kinship (e.g., between one\u2019s birth parents and other classificatory \nparents, between one\u2019s full and one\u2019s classificatory siblings). Exactly the same effect is achieved \nwhen people do not attend to the resemblance between babies and their birth parents, but choose to \nsee it elsewhere. \nThis point was brought into focus by a 43-year-old man who was interviewed during the \npiloting stage. He strongly dissented with the majority of Vezo adults who choose not \u201cto see\u201d the \nresemblance between babies and their birth parents and stated instead that the adopted boy would \nresemble the birth father in the shape of his ears \u201cbecause in the case of human beings there must be a \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n151\n  \nsign, a proof, that your child is yours\u201d. Granted that such signs exist, most Vezo adults strive to erase \nthem as best as they can. \nFrom this interpretative perspective, Vezo adults\u2019 statements about their babies\u2019 looks take on \nan important moral connotation, for they are part of people\u2019s efforts to create a community in which \nchildren are generated, nurtured and molded by a much larger network of relations than the ones \ndemarcated by their birth parents. But such efforts, we propose, can be fully appreciated only if we \nrecognize the background against which they are made: Vezo do differentiate between relations \nengendered by birth and relations created through nurture, but they are committed to speaking and \nacting as if they do not. The claim that Vezo ontology is monistic is not only factually wrong, \nparadoxically, in making such a claim, anthropologists risk blinding themselves to the meaning, \nmoral valence, and psychological force of what Vezo adults want to say about their babies. \n \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n152\n  \nAPPENDIX A. SAMPLES OF ADOPTION SCENARIOS \n \nVezo-Vezo adoption scenario \nThere was a man and a woman, they were Vezo people from a village in the North. They \ngave birth to a baby-boy, and when the child was still very small, when he was still a tiny baby, they \nwent to the interior to consult a diviner. And they took the baby with them. \nWhen they got well inside the forest, something very bad happened to them: some bandits \ncrossed their way. When the woman, the baby\u2019s mother, saw the bandits approaching, she was \nscared as she understood what was going to happen to them\u2026 and so very quickly she took the \nbaby off her back and hid him in the grass. When the bandits got hold of them, they took them far \naway into the forest, and killed them \u2013 both the woman and the man, the mother and father who \ngenerated the baby, were thus dead. But the baby was left hidden in the grass, still alive. \nAfter a little while, the baby started to cry, and he cried and cried. When a man from a Vezo \nvillage in the South went by, he heard the baby cry. He looked and looked and finally he saw the \nbaby hidden in the grass, and he picked him up, he held him in his arms. He was very surprised to \nsee the baby, and he waited there in the forest for he thought that someone would come to fetch the \nbaby. But when it got dark and nobody had come, he had no choice but to return home, taking the \nchild with him to his own village in the South. \nHis wife was very surprised when she saw that her husband was carrying the baby, and she \nasked: \u201cWhere is this baby from?\u201d And her husband explained the whole story. Both of them were \nconvinced that some one would come to fetch the baby, and so they waited and waited, but after \nmany days had gone by and nobody had come to get him, finally they knew that the baby was going \nto be their child. And they were very happy, because they didn\u2019t have children of their own, and so \nthey were happy to have got a child - a male child. After some time, they called on the ancestors \u2013 \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n153\n  \nthe dead people \u2013 and informed them that they had got a son, and they received the ancestors\u2019 \nblessing. \nAnd so the child grew up in the village in the South, he grew up strong and healthy, he was \nhappy, he liked his father and mother, and the father and mother who raised him, who brought him \nup and looked after him, were really parents to him. \nNow my questions are going to be like this: the child is no longer a child but is a grown up \nperson. And the questions about him are going to be like this: \nThe father who generated the boy, the one from the northern village who died, he had longish \nand narrow feet. The father who raised the boy, the one from the southern village, he had \nshortish and wide feet. In your opinion, when the child is fully grown up: will he have longish \nand narrow feet like the father who generated him, or will have shortish and wide feet like the \nfather who raised him? \n \nAnimal Adoption Scenario \nThere was a woman who raised ducks and chickens. When winter came, she was very \ncold, as she didn\u2019t have a blanket. She wanted to buy one, but didn\u2019t have any money. She was \nso cold that finally one day she decided she had to do something: \u201cI\u2019ll take this duck [hen] to \nthe market and I\u2019ll sell it, and with the money I\u2019ll buy myself a blanket\u201d. This is a picture of the \nduck [hen] the woman decided to sell. And so she left and went to the market, and when she got \nthere, she sold the duck, got the money, and off she went to the Karany shops to buy herself a \nblanket. On her way back to the village she was happy, because of her new blanket. When she \ngot to the village, she was very surprised to find that, hidden in the grass in her court-yard, was \nan egg that had been laid by the duck [hen] she had just sold at the market. She hadn\u2019t known \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n154\n  \nthe duck [hen] was about to lay eggs! Now that the duck [hen] was no longer there, she was left \nwith her egg. \nHowever, the woman also had a hen [a duck] that had laid her eggs and was actually \nalready sitting on them. This is a picture of the hen [duck]. So the woman took the duck\u2019s egg \nand put it under the hen and the hen sat on it [pointing to the picture]. The hen sat and sat on it, \nuntil the egg finally hatched. The bird that was inside the duck\u2019s egg spent all its time with the \nhen, and it was the hen who led the little bird around, who raised it together with her other \noffspring: They ate together, slept together, and played together the whole time until the bird \nwas all grown up. \nNow my questions are going to be like this. Let\u2019s say that the little bird is no longer \nlittle, but is all grown up. My questions are about this bird: \nThe duck that generated the bird had a red tongue. The hen that sat on the egg and \nthen raised the little bird had a yellow tongue. In your opinion, when the bird is \nfully grown up: will it have a red tongue like the duck that generated it, or will it \nhave a yellow tongue like the hen that raised it? \nFinally, in your opinion, what is this bird going to be when it\u2019s all grown up: a duck or a chicken? \n  \nCONSTRAINTS ON CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n155\n  \nAPPENDIX B.

New York: Routledge. \n \n  \nCONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR \n \n177\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nBecause of its interdisciplinary nature and the logistics of fieldwork, this project has \nrequired intellectual and financial support from many sources. Maurice Bloch, anthropologist at the \nLondon School of Economics, was instrumental in initiating his and Astuti\u2019s collaboration with \nSusan Carey and Gregg Solomon. He piloted the adoption study with Zafimaniry children and \nadults in Madagascar, paving the way for our study among the Vezo. He has continued to contribute \nto our research in all of its stages, with moral support (especially when Astuti was in the field), \ninsight, comments and humor. Larry Hirschfeld\u2019s work on race has inspired much of our work. At \nthe outset, we discussed our project with him and we thank him for his intellectual input and for his \npatience in awaiting its outcome. Sean Epstein, Astuti\u2019s son, was in Madagascar during the period \nof data collection and he proved an excellent research assistant. He not only took a keen interest in \nthe topic of biological inheritance, but also greatly facilitated Astuti\u2019s work with Vezo children. Our \nwarmest thanks go to all the Vezo children, adolescents and adults who agreed to take part in our \nstudies. As ever, Astuti greatly appreciated Gion Cabalzar\u2019s hospitality in Morondava. During the \nextended period of data analysis, the CNRS and the Institute Jean Nicod sponsored a series of \ninterdisciplinary workshops in Paris in which all three authors participated. Thanks are due to the \norganizer, Dan Sperber, for these interesting meetings and for providing a venue for face-to-face \nwork. Finally, we wish to thank the anonymous reviewers and the SRCD Monographs\u2019 editor for \ntheir careful reading of the manuscript, for their criticisms and suggestions. \nAstuti wishes to thank the Anthropology Department at the London School of Economics, in \nparticular its then convener Johnny Parry, for allowing her to take time off from her teaching and \nadministrative duties. This project could not have been completed without the extended period of \nresearch leave that Astuti has been allowed to enjoy. She would also like to thank her colleague and \nfriend Charles Stafford for carrying a heavy load, without resenting her freedom. The monograph \n  \nCONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR \n \n178\nwas written at the Laboratory of Developmental Studies at Harvard, where Astuti spent a sabbatical \nyear. She is grateful for the assistance she received from Andrew Baron and from all the other \nmembers of the Carey, Spelke and Snedeker Labs, who made her stay an outstanding and fully \nenjoyable experience. Many thanks also to Paul Harris, Melissa Koenig, Fabrice Clement and \nLaurence Kaufmann for lively and stimulating discussions. Finally, Astuti wishes to thank Lorenzo \nEpstein who, as always, has shared the frustrations, the excitement, and the joys of her work. \nAstuti was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council, UK (Research Grant \nR000237191, 1997-98, and Research Fellowship R000271254, 2002-2005), the Nuffield Foundation \n(Social Science Research Foundation Fellowship, 1997-98), the Leverhulme Foundation (Study \nAbroad Fellowship, 2002-03). She thanks all of these institutions for their generous support. \n Solomon wishes to thank the National Science Foundation and the Fondation Fyssen for \ntheir support. Thanks also to Bill Gerin, Ted Gibson, Fati Khosroshahi, and Jean-Michel Roy.  \n  \nCONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR \n \n179\nCONTRIBUTORS \nRita Astuti (Ph.D., LSE, 1991) is Reader in Anthropology at the London School of Economics and \nPolitical Science. She has conducted extensive fieldwork among the Vezo of Madagascar, and her \nwritings have focused on issues of gender, ethnic identity, and kinship. In her more recent work, she \nhas combined anthropological and psychological methods to explore how Vezo children construct \nthe adult understanding of the social world. Her next project will focus on Vezo children\u2019s \nacquisition of supernatural concepts. \n \nGregg E. A. Solomon (Ph.D., Harvard University, 1988) is Program Director for Research on \nLearning and Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources at the National \nScience Foundation. His research with children explores other aspects of their understandings of \nfolkbiology and their understandings of rational numbers. His research with adults investigates the \nnature and acquisition of wine expertise, and the training of diagnostic expertise in medical \nstudents. He is also active in developing ties between the cognitive science and educational research \ncommunities.  \n  \nSusan Carey (Ph.D., Harvard University, 1972) is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University.  \nHer research concerns conceptual development across three different time scales:  evolutionary, \nhistorical, and individual ontogenesis.  She has carried out case studies of the acquisition of \nrepresentations of natural number, of folkbiological concepts, and of representations of the physical \nand social worlds.  She also works on language acquisition, especially on the relations between \nlexical and conceptual development. \n  \nCONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR \n \n180\nTable 1.  \nA typical Study 1 adult protocol of the Vezo-Vezo scenario and Vezo-Masikoro scenario. \nParticipant was a 49-year-old female. \n \nVEZO-VEZO SCENARIO \n \nTRAITS                                 RESPONSES \n[Birth father vs Adoptive father]   \n    \nShortish\/wide feet vs longish\/narrow feet Like the father who generated him \nbraod\/flat nose vs longish\/narrow nose Like the father who generated him \nLongish kidneys vs roundish kidneys Like the father who generated him \nStraight eyes vs cross-eyed Like the father who generated him \nbelieved that horses have stronger teeth than cows \nvs believed that cows have stronger teeth than \nhorses \nLike the father who raised him \nbelieved that pineapple is healthier than papaya \nvs believed that papaya is healthier than \npineapple \nLike the father who raised him \nbelieved that there are kinds of lemurs that do not \nsee at night vs believed that there are kinds of \ndogs that do not see at night \nLike the father who raised him \nbelieved that frogs have green hearts vs believed \nthat frogs have black hearts \nLike the father who raised him \n  \nCONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT IN MADAGASCAR \n \n181\nknew how to be a carpenter but not a mechanic vs \nknew how to be a mechanic but not a carpenter \nLike the father who raised him \ndidn't know how to whistle vs knew how to \nwhistle \nKnowing how to whistle is not like work, \nbut is a talent.
