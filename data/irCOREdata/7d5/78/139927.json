Introduction\nOver the past two decades, the growth in executive pay levels and the perceived lack of its\nlink to firm performance has received significant attention. It is the board of directors\u2019\nresponsibility for setting executive pay, and their perceived inability to do so effectively has\nbeen one of the drivers for corporate governance reforms around the world, along with other\nperceived failures resulting in corporate scandals and failures. Such reforms have included\ndemands for smaller boards with a higher proportion of independent directors, the belief\nbeing that such boards will be more effective at monitoring tasks which include limiting\nexcessive pay awards and providing a stronger pay-performance link.\nDespite the importance of this issue, there is only limited empirical evidence relating\nexecutive pay to board structure. The small number of previous studies nearly all use US data,\nemploy relatively small selective samples and use a cross-sectional econometric approach.\nThis paper contributes to the literature by examining the impact of board structure on\nexecutive cash compensation in the UK. In contrast to previous studies, we employ a very\nlarge comprehensive panel dataset of some 1,880 firms over a long time period, 1983-2002.\nOur results should therefore be more robust to sample selection and time period bias.\nProviding evidence from outside the US is of interest to see whether and how the relation\nbetween board structure and pay differs in a different setting, with a different legal and\ninstitutional environment. Although the UK corporate governance system has many\nsimilarities to that of the US, there are notable differences (discussed in Section 3 below)\nwhich may undermine the monitoring role of non-executive directors.\nWe find evidence that non-executive directors play an important monitoring role in\nshaping both the rate of increase in executive pay levels and the relation between the rate of\nincrease in executive pay levels and changes in performance. Firstly, the proportion of non-\nexecutives tends to decrease the rate of increase in executive pay levels whilst board size\ntends to increase it. Secondly, the proportion of non-executives strengthens the relation\n3between the rate of increase in executive pay levels and changes in performance. We find\nevidence of an asymmetric pay-performance sensitivity for all firms, whereby when\nperformance is poor, the pay-performance link is much weaker than when performance is\nstrong. However, a higher proportion of non-executives strengthens the link between pay and\nperformance when performance is poor. In contrast, board size has little impact on the pay-\nperformance link.\nAnalysis of the UK over the sample time period allows us to address the impact of the\nCadbury Report (1992) on executive pay. This corporate governance reform (described in\nSection 3 below), motivated by perceived corporate governance failures including excessive\npay levels, recommended that all listed firms should (among other things) have at least three\nnon-executive directors. Adoption of the recommendations was on a \u2018comply or explain\u2019\nbasis. Previous studies have found that adoption of Cadbury leads to a stronger link between\nfirm underperformance and CEO dismissal (Dahya et al., 2002), a greater likelihood of\nappointing an outside CEO (Dahya et al., 2005), and better overall performance (Dahya and\nMcConnell, 2007). Our results add to this literature by showing that adopting firms also\nexperience a lower rate of increase in executive pay levels and an increase in pay-\nperformance sensitivity.\nOur long sample period allows us to address problems of endogeneity. Firstly, we employ\npanel data fixed effects methods that control for the possibility that both board structure and\nexecutive pay are determined by some unobservable firm specific variable. Secondly, our\nanalysis of the Cadbury Reforms can to some extent address the concern that board structure\nand executive pay are jointly determined by one another. 1 To the extent that board structure\nchanges following Cadbury can be attributed to Cadbury then they are exogenous (Dahya et\nal., 2002; and Chhaochharia and Grinstein, 2009). However, it is important to note that since\nthe Cadbury recommendations were not compulsory, Cadbury is not a strictly exogenous\nevent, unlike Sarbanes-Oxley which was compulsory by US law.\n4The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the literature on board\nstructure and executive pay. Section 3 describes aspects of board structure and executive pay\nin the specific UK context. Section 4 describes the methodology and data. Section 5 presents\nthe empirical results. Section 6 concludes.\n2. Board Structure and Executive Pay: Literature Review\nOne of the primary functions of boards of directors is to monitor managers, which includes\nsetting executive pay. As Jensen and Murphy (2004, p. 50) note; \u201cA primary role of boards of\ndirectors is to hire, fire, and set the remuneration of the CEO and other top executives\u201d.\nPrincipal-agent theory shows how pay should be determined by performance in a way that\nensures managers pursue the interests of shareholders (Murphy, 1999). However, there is a\ngeneral perception that executive pay is often too high, whilst the large empirical literature\nshows that the pay-performance relationship is small and weak (Murphy, 1999). It has\ntherefore been argued that executive pay is possibly a symptom of the principal agent\nproblem rather than being an answer to it, and is manipulated by CEOs who are monitored\nineffectively by their boards (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). Two characteristics of boards that\nare argued to be of crucial importance in providing the monitoring function and in setting\neffective executive pay, are the proportion of non-executive directors and board size.\nThe proportion of non-executive directors on the board is argued to have a restraining\nimpact on pay levels and a positive impact on the pay-performance link. Fama and Jensen\n(1983) argue that compensation decisions should be carried out by non-executive directors,\nwho are more likely to be independent of the CEO and objective when it comes to evaluating\nthe CEOs performance. Also, non-executive directors often already have experience in\nmonitoring top management and may wish to signal their ability to other firms that may\nsubsequently employ them as non-executives. In contrast, \u201cinsider-dominated boards imply\nproblematic self monitoring, and particularly weak monitoring of the CEO, since the CEO is\nlikely to be in a position to influence the insider directors career advancement within the\n5firm\u201d (Zajac and Westphal, 1994, p. 125). Recent regulation is in line with these arguments.\nStock exchange regulation changes made following the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 requires US\nlisted firms to have a majority of independent directors on the board, one aim of which is to\nreduce the manager\u2019s influence over executive pay.\nThe impartiality and objectiveness of non-executive directors described above is not\nuniversally accepted. Non-executive directors are frequently not independent of the CEO,\nwho may have been responsible for their selection. Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) find that\nboard composition is determined by the CEO. The CEO could be friends with non-executive\ndirectors, and may also provide consulting work to them (Singh and Harianto, 1989).\nFurthermore, if non-executive directors are also executive directors at other companies,\nawarding high pay as non-executives can potentially result in them receiving higher pay as\nexecutives because of the tendency to base pay levels on levels in comparable firms. Hence\nthere is a potential conflict of interests here (Main and Crystal, 1988; Ezzamel and Watson,\n2002).\nThe main findings from previous empirical studies on board structure and executive\ncompensation are displayed in Table 1 below. Overall, the proportion of non-executives\nappears to be positively correlated with higher executive pay. All ten previous studies find a\npositive correlation, six of which are statistically significant (Main, 1991; Main and Johnston,\n1993; Cosh and Hughes, 1997; Cyert et al., 2002; Fernandes, 2008; and Ozkan, 2007), and\nfour of which are insignificantly positive (Mangel and Singh, 1993; Angbazo and Narayanan,\n1997; Kren and Kerr, 1997; and Evans and Evans, 2002). Only two studies have examined\nthe impact on pay-performance sensitivity. Kren and Kerr (1997) find a negative impact\nwhere performance is measured using share returns. However, this result is not robust, being\nof marginal statistical significance and not holding when performance is measured using\nprofitability. In contrast, Conyon and Peck (1998) employ a fixed effects methodology and\nfind a positive relation (using share returns). Therefore, previous findings on non-executive\nproportion and pay-performance sensitivity are mixed.\n6TABLE 1 HERE\nSmaller board size is argued to have a restraining impact on pay levels or changes and a\npositive impact on the pay-performance link. Smaller boards are expected to be more\neffective at setting executive pay than larger boards because the latter suffer from\ncoordination costs and free rider problems (Yermack, 1996). For example, with larger boards\nit is more difficult to arrange meetings, reach agreement, which leads to slower and less-\nefficient decision-making (Jensen 1993). Free-riding increases because the cost to an\nindividual director of not carrying out his monitoring role properly decreases as board size\nincreases (Lipton and Lorsch, 1992). Jensen (1993) and Lipton and Lorsch (1992) suggest\nthat as board size increases beyond a certain point, these problems outweigh the initial\nadvantages from having more directors to draw on, which leads to less effective boards. 2\nThe main findings from previous studies on board size and executive compensation are\nalso displayed in Table 1. Overall, board size appears to have a positive impact on pay levels.\nFive of the six studies find a positive impact (Main, 1991; Angbazo and Narayanan, 1997;\nHallock, 1997; Core et al., 1999; and Ozkan, 2007), and of these, only Angbazo and\nNarayanan (1997) do not find a significant impact. Only the study by Cyert et al. (2002) does\nnot find a positive impact, although it is worth noting that this study does find a positive\nimpact on the bonus element of compensation, if not the base salary. In terms of the impact of\nboard size on pay-performance sensitivity, only Yermack (2006) examines this and finds that\nthe sensitivity of CEO cash compensation (salary and annual bonus) to share returns is\nweaker for firms with larger boards.\nOne criticism of the above studies is that board size and structure are endogenous\nvariables, jointly determined by one another or by some unobservable firm characteristic\nwhich, in turn determine CEO compensation (Hermalin and Weisbach, 2003). In order to\naddress this problem, Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2009) argue that examination of a\nregulatory change helps mitigate the endogeneity problem, since changes to board structure\ncan be attributed to the exogenous change (see also Dahya et al., 2002). Chhaochharia and\n7Grinstein (2009) consequently use the changes made by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\nassociated changes to stock exchange regulations 3 to study the effect of board structure on\nCEO compensation. They find that for those firms impacted by the changes, executive pay\ndecreases by 10-25%, and that the one provision of the rules that has a significant impact is\nthe requirement for a majority of independent directors on the board.\n3. Board Structure and Executive Pay: The UK Context\nThe UK provides an interesting environment in which to study the effect of board structure\non executive pay. The UK corporate governance system has many similarities to that of the\nUS including a common law system and unitary board structures. However, there are notable\ndifferences in terms of the role of non-executive directors and executive pay.\nThe prescribed advisory and monitoring functions of UK non-executive directors are very\nsimilar to those in the US (Cadbury, 1992). However, there are several reasons why the\nmonitoring function may possibly be carried out less effectively in the UK. Firstly, UK non-\nexecutive directors are rarely held legally accountable for failing to fulfill their legal duty of\ncare and loyalty, in contrast to the US where it is much easier to sue a director through a civil\naction than it is in the UK. The lower threat of legal action in the UK could result in less\nincentive to monitor (Franks et al., 2001). Secondly, UK boards have historically consisted of\na lower proportion of non-executive directors who are less independent from management\n(e.g., Cosh and Hughes, 1987). 4 Thirdly, the financial incentives (shareholding and\nremuneration) for non-executive directors in the UK to fulfill their functions are lower (Cosh\nand Hughes, 1987; and Higgs, 2003). The relative strength of other substitute governance\nmechanisms is also stronger in the UK and this further weakens the monitoring role played by\nnon-executive directors (Agrawal and Knoeber, 1996). For example, UK companies have less\navailable takeover defences and consequently the market for corporate control should perform\na stronger function (Short and Keasey, 1999). Additionally, British institutional investors are\nmore active monitors, able to act collectively (Crespi-Cladera and Renneboog, 2003), and\n8expected to perform a stronger role because ownership concentration is higher (Short and\nKeasey, 1999).\nConsistent with this argument, UK evidence suggests that non-executives do not play a\nstrong monitoring role in terms of CEO turnover (Cosh and Hughes, 1997; and Franks et al.,\n2001) or in terms of improving firm performance more generally (see e.g., Vafeas and\nTheodorou, 1998). 5 In contrast, although the US empirical evidence, reviewed by Hermalin\nand Weisbach (2003), shows no association between the proportion of non-executive\ndirectors and general firm performance, it does show a positive relation with regard to\nspecific firm actions such as acquisitions and CEO turnover decisions. Finally, in contrast to\nUS findings, UK board structure is not determined by factors associated with monitoring\ncosts and benefits (Guest, 2008).\nIn terms of executive pay, there are several notable differences. Firstly, Conyon and\nMurphy (2000) show that US pay levels, in terms of base salary, bonus, and long term\nincentives are much higher than in the UK. Secondly, US companies have a much higher\nproportion of bonus to total compensation, and of long term incentives to total compensation.\nShare option grants account for only 10% of pay in the UK compared to 50% in the US.\nShare option grants declined in the UK over the 1990s and, for most of the period under\nconsideration were linked to base salary and so were not an independent element of salary.\nThirdly, the level of reporting of executive pay in the UK has until recently been lower than\nin the US. Until 1997, the principal disclosure requirement demanded that firms disclose only\nthe cash compensation (pay plus bonus plus benefits) of the Chairman, the highest paid\ndirector, and the entire board whilst information on share options or long-term incentive plans\nwas not available.\nStarting in the 1990s, a series of corporate governance reforms were introduced in the UK\nthat had a significant impact on board structure. The Cadbury Report in 1992 made several\nrecommendations to enhance the effectiveness of non-executive directors as monitors. The\nReport was motivated by perceived corporate governance failures resulting in corporate\n9scandals, failures, and excessive pay levels which appeared unrelated to performance. 6 One\nkey recommendation was that all listed firms should have at least three non-executive\ndirectors.7 The number of non-executive directors increased significantly following Cadbury.\nDahya et al. (2002) report that in 1998, 62.3% of all London Stock Exchange listed\ncompanies had at least three non-executive directors, in contrast to only 26.7% in 1988.\nSubsequently, the Hampel Report (1998) required that at least one third of the board be non-\nexecutives and the Higgs Report (2003) required that at least 50% be non-executives.\nWith specific regard to executive pay, Cadbury did not recommend lowering pay levels or\npay growth. The report did however recommend that directors\u2019 pay should be determined by\na remuneration committee, wholly or mainly comprised of non-executive directors and\nchaired by a non-executive. The Greenbury Report (1995) subsequently recommended that\nthe remuneration committee should consist entirely of non-executives. The anticipation was\nthat shareholder and manager interests would be aligned more closely and so link pay more\ndirectly to performance. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this. Conyon\n(1997) and Benito and Conyon (1999) find that the presence of a remuneration Committee\ndoes not have a significant effect on either pay levels or the pay-performance link. The\nGreenbury Report (1995), which focused solely on executive pay, recommended that firms\ndisclose details for all elements of pay for all executive directors and hence greatly increased\ndisclosure from 1997 onwards.\nIt is important to note that adoption of these recommendations (Cadbury, Greenbury,\nHampel, and Higgs), which now form part of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance\n(2006), has not been mandatory. They were, and are, a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 recommendation.8\n4. Methodology and Data\nTo test for the existence of a relationship between executive pay and board size and\nstructure we build on a basic relationship between executive pay and the various determinants\n10\nwhich have been identified as important in the literature on executive pay (see e.g., Girma et\nal., 2006). This basic relationship may be written as follows:\nPay it = \u03b2 0 + \u03b21 Pay it-1 + \u03b22 Size it + \u03b23 Return it + \u03b24 Standard deviation it\n(1) + \u03b25 % Non-executives it-1 + \u03b26 Board size it-1 + h t + f i + e it\nwhere Pay it is defined as the logarithm of total cash compensation (salary plus bonus plus the\ncash equivalents of any perquisites but excluding pension contributions) of the highest paid\ndirector in company i at time t. In using this measure of executive pay, we follow other UK\nexecutive pay work (see e.g., Conyon, 1997; Conyon and Peck, 1998; Girma et al., 2006, and\nGirma et al., 2007). Until 1997, this was the only widely available measure of CEO pay in the\nUK. Although it has been possible since 1997 to identify the specific components of\ncompensation (such as share options) received by each board member, our econometric\nmodel requires two years of lagged compensation and hence any analysis involving this more\nrecent data would be restricted to years 1999-2002 only. Hence for almost all our sample\nperiod, our pay measure is the only one available and subsequently the only measure\nemployed. We expect at most a minimal bias by not examining long term incentives since\nover the sample period such incentives were not an independent element of salary and formed\nonly a small part of executive compensation.\nPay it-1 is the lagged value of variable Pay it. The impact coefficient \u03b21 gives an estimate of\nthe degree of top pay persistence. Previous studies have shown that there is significant\npersistence in top pay (Conyon, 1997; and Girma et al., 2006) and therefore prior pay needs\nto be controlled for. Size it represents the logarithm of firm sales and is our measure of\ncompany size. Return is the logarithm of the buy and hold share return over the 12 months\npreceding the financial year end. Standard deviation it is the standard deviation of monthly\nshare returns over the 12 months preceding the financial year end. %Non-executives is the\nnumber of non-executive directors divided by the total number of (executive and non-\nexecutive) directors on the board. Non-executive directors are part-time directors, whilst\nexecutive directors are employed full time and are involved in the day to day running of the\n11\ncompany in addition to their director's duties. Board size is the logarithm of the total number\nof (executive and non-executive) directors on the board. 9 We employ the lags of board\nstructure since the components of cash compensation (base salary level and bonus policy),\ntend to be determined at the start of the financial year (see e.g., Benito and Conyon, 1999). h\nt are year dummies employed to account for economy-wide impacts, and e it is an error term.\nf i are firm specific dummy variables. Both executive pay and board structure could be\njointly determined by an unobservable time invariant firm specific variable, which could bias\nthe relation between the two. One way to address this problem is with a fixed effects model,\nwhere firm specific dummy variables are included to remove all firm specific unobservable\neffects. However, the presence of the lagged dependent variable Pay it-1 in a fixed effect\nmodel means that the conventional fixed effects estimator is biased (Nickell, 1981). To\novercome this problem, we instead take first differences of equation (1) to eliminate the\ncompany specific fixed effects (following Anderson and Hsaio (1982)) as follows:\n\u2206 Pay it = \u03b2 0 + \u03b21 \u2206 Pay it-1 + \u03b22 \u2206 Size it + \u03b23 \u2206 Return it + \u03b24 \u2206 Standard deviation it\n(2) + \u03b25 \u2206 %Non-executives it-1 + \u03b26 \u2206 Board size it-1 + h t + e it\nwhere the operator \u2206 on any variable X is simply current value X minus last period value (\u2206 \nX = X t \u2013 X t-1). By taking first differences of the natural logarithm of pay we therefore\nexamine the rate of increase in pay (see e.g., Girma et al., 2006).\nTaking first differences as in equation (2) introduces an MA(1) error term, and therefore\nestimation by ordinary least squares results in biased estimates on the lagged dependent\nvariable, \u03b21 (Nickell, 1981). To avoid this problem, we use instrumental variable techniques\nto estimate \u2206 Pay it-1. We estimate the model using the Arrellano and Bond (1991) generalised\nmethod of moments procedure, which uses lagged levels of all variables from period (t-2)\ndata and earlier as valid instruments in the first differences model. This yields valid\ninstrumental variable estimates in the absence of second-order serial correlation, and has been\nused by previous empirical pay studies (see e.g., Main et al., 1996; Conyon, 1997; and Girma\net al., 2006). The validity of the instruments used is examined using the Sargan test of\n12\ninstrument validity, and the model\u2019s success in removing the second order serial correlation is\nexamined using a test for second order serial correlation.\nThe source of data for our sample of UK publicly quoted firms is Datastream, from which\nall company board and performance variables are collected. We restrict our sample to those\nDatastream firm years in which data is available on all the above variables. Three successive\nyears of data are required because the regression model described in equation (2) requires two\nyears of lagged data. It was therefore necessary to exclude from the Datastream population of\nUK public firms those firms lacking three continuous years of data over the period 1981-\n2002. Our pay model is estimated from 1983 to 2002, but for 1983 observations we require\ndata going back to 1981. We exclude financial and property companies (Datastream Level 4\nIndustries 80\u201389), due to the specific characteristics of financial ratios in these industries. Our\nfinal sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 1,880 companies between 1983 and 2002 for\nwhich we have 13,492 firm year observations. The balance of the panel is shown in Table 2\nbelow.\nTABLE 2 HERE\nTable 3 below presents the summary statistics for the variables used in the regression\nanalysis. All the absolute variables are converted to 2002 sterling values using the UK Retail\nPrice Index, and all variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to remove\ninfluential outliers. The average (median) proportion of non-executive directors for our\nsample is 0.43 (0.43), which is similar to previous UK studies (e.g., Cosh and Hughes, 1987)\nbut much smaller than that reported for US studies. For example Linck et al. (2007) report an\naverage proportion of non-executive directors of 0.66. The average (median) board size is 7\n(7), which is identical to the average board size of 7 reported by Linck et al. (2007) for a\ncomprehensive US study.\nTABLE 3 HERE\n13\n5. Empirical Results\n5.1 Impact of board structure on changes in pay\nColumn (1) of Table 4 below reports the results of estimating equation (2). The coefficient\nfor the lagged rate of increase in pay is significantly positive, indicating that the rate of\nincrease in pay is positively related to its lagged value. The coefficient for firm size is\nsignificantly positive, confirming that executive pay is positively impacted by firm size. The\ncoefficient for change in share return is significantly positive, indicating that there is a\nsignificant link between pay and performance in the UK. The sign and magnitude of these\nestimated coefficients are in line with the previous evidence of Girma et al. (2006) for the\nUK. The coefficient for lagged pay (0.30) is larger, than that for size (0.14), which is in turn\ngreater than that for performance (0.05). The latter difference indicates that, although\nperformance has a positive impact on pay, firm size has a relatively larger impact. The\ncoefficient for the standard deviation of share returns is significantly negative. The\ndiagnostics for the instrument set are adequate since both the Sargan p-value and the 2nd order\nserial correlation p-value are insignificant (p-values of 0.46 and 0.16 respectively)\nTABLE 4 HERE\nThe regression estimates show a significantly inverse association between the rate of\nincrease in pay and the change in the proportion of non-executives. The coefficient is -0.12\nwhich is statistically significant at the one percent level. It is also economically important,\nimplying that an increase in the proportion of non-executives from 0.5 to 0.75 will reduce the\nrate of increase in pay by roughly three percent. This finding stands in contrast to the previous\nstudies described above, all of which find a positive relation, and it is important to understand\nwhy our results differ so significantly. In additional tests we find that the results clearly differ\nbecause of the econometric methodology employed. Previous studies do not employ a fixed\neffect model nor control for prior pay levels. When we employ an ordinary least squares\nmodel in levels and do not control for prior pay levels, the coefficient for the proportion of\n14\nnon-executives is significantly positive, consistent with previous studies. When we add\nlagged pay to this regression, the coefficient is statistically insignificant. When we\nadditionally include firm fixed effects, the coefficient is significantly negative. Indeed, the\ncoefficient is significantly negative in the fixed effect model, even when lagged pay is\nexcluded. Clearly, the methodology employed has a critical impact on the conclusion drawn.\nWe believe that it is critical to control for both fixed effects and for lagged pay. The fact that\nprevious board structure-pay studies do not do so means that the conclusion one draws from\nthese previous studies could be a spurious one. Instead, our findings suggest that the change\nin the proportion of non-executives exerts a negative influence on the rate of increase in pay\nwhich is consistent with the idea that non-executives play an important monitoring role in\nrestraining excessive pay growth.\nThe regression estimates show a positive and significant association between the rate of\nincrease in pay and the change in board size. This is consistent with the argument that\ncoordination, communication, and free riding problems restrict the board\u2019s ability to restrain\nexcessive pay awards when board size increases. This is consistent with all previous studies\nand is robust to the different regression methods described above.\n5.2 Impact of board structure on the pay-performance relation\nIn order to examine the impact of board structure on the pay-performance link, we include\ninteractive variables that are equal to the proportion of non-executives multiplied by the share\nreturn (%Non-executives it-1 * Return it), and board size multiplied by share return (Board size\nit-1 * Return it). The results are reported in Column (2) of Table 4 above. The coefficient for\nthe proportion of non-executives multiplied by the share return variable is significantly\npositive at the one percent level. This indicates that an increase in the proportion of non-\nexecutives leads to a stronger pay-performance link, and is consistent with the one previous\nUK study in this area (Conyon and Peck, 1998). The coefficient for the board size multiplied\nby share return variable is positive and marginally statistically significant at the ten percent\n15\nlevel. This latter finding runs contrary to our expectations, since it suggests that larger boards\nare associated with a stronger pay-performance link.\nWe test the robustness of these results by employing additional interactive variables.\nPrevious studies have shown that when estimating pay-performance sensitivities, it is\nimportant to control for the variance of firm share returns and firm size. Aggarwal and\nSamwick (1999) show that pay\u2013performance sensitivity is higher for firms with high share\nreturn variance, whilst Schaefer (1998) shows that it is weaker for large firms. It is important\nto control for such factors because board size and the proportion of non-executives are\nnegatively impacted by share return variance and positively impacted by firm size,\nrespectively (see e.g., Linck et al., 2007). In Column (3) we report results including two\nadditional interactive variables; standard deviation of share returns multiplied by share return\n(Standard deviation it * Return it), and firm size multiplied by share return (Size it * Return it).\nThe coefficient for the former variable is significantly negative, consistent with Aggarwal and\nSamwick (1999). The coefficient for the latter variable is significantly positive, suggesting\nthat larger UK firms have a stronger pay-performance link, contrary to Schaefer\u2019s (1998)\nfindings for the US. In this regression, the coefficient for the proportion of non-executives\nmultiplied by the share return variable is still significantly positive. However, the coefficient\nfor the board size multiplied by the share return variable is now statistically insignificant. It\nappears that once we control for size and variance impacts on the pay-performance link,\nboard size has no additional impact. Our results do not therefore support the argument that\nboard size has a negative impact on the pay-performance relation, as found by Yermack\n(1996).\nWe examine whether our results differ over different ranges of board size and proportion\nof non-executives. The results, not tabulated, show that the positive effect of changes in board\nsize on the rate of increase in pay appears to hold at even very small levels of board size.\nUnlike Yermack (1996), a sizeable minority (22 percent) of our sample observations have\nboard size below six (the minimum board size is three directors). The coefficient for board\n16\nsize for this subsample is 0.072 (p-value of 0.038), which is in fact greater than the coefficient\nfor the sample of firms with board size greater than or equal to six (coefficient of 0.041, p-\nvalue of 0.026). This is consistent with Eisenberg et al. (1998) who find that a negative\nassociation between board size and firm performance exists even over the lowest range of\nboard sizes. Similarly, the impact of board size on the pay-performance link is very similar\nfor firms with board sizes less than six and those with board sizes greater than or equal to six.\nWith regard to the proportion of non-executives, when this is less than the median of 0.43, the\ncoefficient for change in proportion of non-executives is -0.018 and statistically insignificant.\nIn contrast, when the proportion of non-executives is greater than 0.43, the coefficient is\nequal to -0.178 and significant at the one percent level. Therefore, increases in the proportion\nof non-executives are associated with greater impacts when the proportion is greater. This is\nconsistent with the argument that a minority of non-executives does not have significant\nmonitoring strength, regardless of whether it is a small or large minority. In terms of the pay-\nperformance link we find similar evidence. When the proportion of non-executives is greater\nthan the median of 0.43, the coefficient for the proportion of non-executives multiplied by the\nshare return variable is 0.304. In contrast, when less than 0.43, the coefficient is half the size\n(0.169). However, both coefficients are statistically significant and the difference is not as\npronounced as it is for the rate of increase in pay.\n5.3 Impact of board structure on the asymmetric pay-performance relation\nGarvey and Milbourn (2006) show that executive pay does not adjust symmetrically to\ngood and bad performance. In particular, there is an asymmetric pay-performance sensitivity,\nwhereby when performance is poor, the pay-performance link is weaker than when\nperformance is strong. We examine whether this is the case for our sample firms, and if so,\nwhether this asymmetric sensitivity is impacted by board size and structure. In order to\nexamine this we employ two new variables instead of the continuous share return as\npreviously. Return negative it is equal to the logarithm of the buy and hold share return over\nthe 12 months preceding the financial year end if the raw return is negative, otherwise it is set\n17\nequal to zero. Alternatively, Return positive it is equal to the logarithm of the return if the raw\nreturn is positive, otherwise it is zero. If there is asymmetric pay-performance sensitivity,\nthen the coefficient for the negative return should be lower than that for the positive return\nvariable.\nThe results are shown in Column (1) of Table 5 below. The coefficients for both variables\nare positive and statistically significant. However, the coefficient for the negative return\nvariable (0.03) is significantly lower than the coefficient for the positive return variable\n(0.07). The difference between the two coefficients is statistically significant at the one\npercent level, showing that pay is more responsive to performance when performance is high\nthan when it is low, consistent with the US evidence of Garvey and Milbourn (2006).\nTABLE 5 HERE\nIn order to examine whether the asymmetric pay-performance relation differs according to\nthe proportion of non-executives and board size, we include interactive variables as in Table\n4, whereby the interaction is with the negative and positive share return variables, rather than\nthe continuous share return. %Non-executives it-1 * Return negative it, is equal to the\nproportion of non-executives multiplied by the negative share return variable, whilst %Non-\nexecutives it-1 * Return positive it, is equal to the proportion of non-executives multiplied by\nthe positive share return variable. If a higher proportion of non-executives causes a stronger\nlink between pay and performance when performance is poor, then the coefficient for %Non-\nexecutives it-1 * Return negative it will be significantly positive. Analogous arguments apply to\nthe interaction of board size and the negative and positive share return variables.\nThe results are reported in Column (2) of Table 5. The coefficient for the proportion of\nnon-executives multiplied by the negative return variable is significantly positive, thus a\nhigher proportion of non-executives greatly strengthens the link between pay and\nperformance when performance is poor. In contrast, the proportion of non-executives\nmultiplied by the positive return variable is statistically insignificant. Therefore, the positive\nrelation between pay and performance that occurs when performance is good is not impacted\n18\nby the proportion of non-executives. The coefficient for board size multiplied by the negative\nreturn variable is insignificant. However, the coefficient for board size multiplied by the\npositive return variable is significantly positive, suggesting that larger board size leads to a\nstronger pay performance link when performance is good.\nIn order to check the robustness of these findings we again allow, as in Table 4, for the\nimpact of the variance of share returns and firm size on the asymmetric pay-performance\nrelation. In particular, in Column (3) of Table 5 we include four additional interactive\nvariables, Standard deviation it * Return negative it, Standard deviation it * Return positive it,\nSize it * Return negative it, and Size it * Return positive it. Standard deviation it * Return\nnegative it is equal to the standard deviation of share returns multiplied by the negative share\nreturn variable, and so on. The results show that the standard deviation of share returns\nsignificantly reduces the pay-performance relation for both negative and positive share\nreturns. However, the firm size multiplied by negative return variable is significantly positive.\nHence larger firms have a stronger relation between pay and performance when the latter is\npoor, compared to small firms. More importantly, once these additional influences are\nincluded, the proportion of non-executives still has a significantly positive effect on the pay-\nperformance link when performance is poor. However, board size no longer has a positive\nimpact on the pay-performance link when performance is high. 10\n5.4 Impact of board structure reforms on executive pay\nIn this section we examine the impact on the rate of increase in pay and pay-performance\nsensitivity of those firms that adopt the Cadbury recommendation to employ at least three\nnon-executive directors. Of our sample of 1,880 firms, 1,046 have data observations both\nbefore and after the introduction of the Code (30\/06\/1993). Table 6 below provides a\nbreakdown of these 1,046 firms according to whether, for the pre- and post-Cadbury period,\nthey are either always in compliance (\u2018Always\u2019), never in compliance (\u2018Never\u2019), or in and out\nof compliance (\u2018Some\u2019). The \u2018Some\u2019 category is further broken down (for the post-Cadbury\nperiod) according to whether, if there is compliance, it is followed by continual compliance\n19\n(\u2018Once comply - always comply\u2019), or by non-compliance (\u2018Comply - then no comply\u2019). We\nfocus on those firms that change their board structure to adopt the Cadbury recommendation.\nThe final row of Table 6 classifies 402 such firms as \u2018Adopters\u2019, since pre-Cadbury they are\neither never in compliance or not always in compliance, and post-Cadbury they move to\ncontinual compliance. The other 644 firms are referred to as \u2018Non-adopters\u2019, since they are\neither always in compliance, never in compliance, or they comply irregularly.\nTABLE 6 HERE\nWe employ a dummy variable, Adopters post-Cadbury it, which is set equal to one for all\nyears after which adopting firms adopt Cadbury, zero for all years prior to this. This variable\nmeasures the impact of Cadbury adoption on the rate of increase in pay. Secondly, we interact\nthis dummy variable with the firm share return, Adopters post-Cadbury it * \u2206 Return it, to\nexamine whether the pay-performance relation is strengthened following adoption. If so, then\nthe coefficient for this variable should be positive. Firstly, we examine the 402 adopters in\nisolation. The results are reported in Column (1) of Table 7 below. The coefficient for the\npost-Cadbury variable is negative but statistically insignificant. The coefficient for the post-\nCadbury variable multiplied by share return is positive and marginally significant at the ten\npercent level, providing some evidence that adopting firms increase their pay-performance\nsensitivity following Cadbury.\nTABLE 7 HERE\nThe specification in Column (1) of Table 7 does not control for general changes in either\nthe rate of increase in pay or the pay-performance relation following Cadbury that may affect\nall firms. To address this, we include all 1,046 firms in the regression and we include four\nadditional variables. Post-Cadbury it is a dummy variable set equal to one for all financial\nyears ending after Cadbury (31\/06\/1993), zero for all financial years prior. Post-Cadbury it *\n\u2206 Return it is an interactive variable set equal to the change in firm share return if the post-\nCadbury variable is equal to one, zero otherwise. The former variable will measure the\noverall impact of Cadbury on the rate of increase in pay whilst the latter will measure the\n20\nimpact on pay-performance sensitivity, in both cases for all 1,046 firms. In order to control\nfor the fact that adopters may have either abnormal rates of increase in pay or pay-\nperformance regardless of Cadbury, relative to other firms, we employ two further variables.\nAdopters i is a dummy variable set equal to one for adopters, zero otherwise. Adopters i * \u2206 \nReturn it, is an interactive variable equal to whether the firm is an adopter multiplied by the\nchange in firm share return. The results are reported in Column (2) of Table 7.\nThe dummy variable for adopters post-Cadbury is negative and marginally significant at\nthe ten percent level, providing evidence that the rate of increase in pay of adopting firms is\nlower following Cadbury that it is beforehand. The interactive variable set equal to the change\nin share return for adopting firms in post-Cadbury years is again significantly positive,\nindicating that the pay-performance of adopting firms is higher following Cadbury than\nbefore Cadbury. There is no evidence that adopting firms as a whole differ from other firms\nin terms of either rates of increase in pay or pay-performance sensitivity, since the\ncoefficients for both the dummy variable set equal to one for adopters and the interactive\nvariable set equal to the change in share return for adopters are both statistically insignificant.\nThe dummy variable set equal to one for all firms for post-Cadbury years is insignificantly\npositive. The interactive variable set equal to the change in the share return for all firms for\npost-Cadbury years is significantly negative, suggesting that Cadbury actually reduces the\npay-performance relation. In order to examine this finding further, in Column (3) of Table 7\nwe consider the impact of Cadbury on all firms without distinguishing between adopters and\nnon-adopters. In this case the coefficient for post-Cadbury years is again insignificantly\npositive, whilst the coefficient for the interactive share return variable is still significantly\nnegative, albeit at the ten percent level.\nIn summary, the results in this section show that firms which adopt the Cadbury\nrecommendation to employ at least three non-executives experience a subsequent decrease in\nthe rate of increase in pay and an increase in pay-performance sensitivity. This suggests that\nour earlier findings on the impact of non-executive proportion on the rate of increase in pay\n21\nand the pay-performance relation are less likely to be driven by endogeneity since the\nchanges following Cadbury can be assumed to be exogenous to some extent. The finding is\nalso consistent with Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2009) who show that US firms which\ncomplied with the stock exchange requirement (introduced following the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct) for a majority of independent directors on boards subsequently reduced executive pay\nlevels. However, it is important to note that (unlike Sarbanes-Oxley in the US which was\ncompulsory by law) since the Cadbury recommendations were not compulsory, Cadbury is\nnot exogenous to the same extent. 11 Despite the positive change for the minority of firms that\nadopt Cadbury, our results for the overall sample show that Cadbury is associated with a\nsmall insignificant increase in the rate of increase in pay and a decrease in pay-performance\nsensitivity. These findings are broadly consistent with those of Girma et al. (2007), who find\nno evidence of a general stronger pay-performance link following Cadbury for all firms.\n6. Conclusions\nWe examine the impact of board structure on executive cash compensation for 1,880 UK\nfirms over 1983-2002. In contrast to previous studies, our comprehensive panel dataset\nshould be more robust to sample selection and time period biases, and allows us to employ\npanel data methods that control for unobservable firm fixed effects and persistence in\nexecutive pay. We find that board size has a positive impact on the rate of increase in pay, but\nno evidence that it has a negative impact on the pay-performance link. We find that that the\nproportion of non-executives has a negative impact on the rate of increase in pay and a\npositive impact on the pay-performance link. There is evidence of an asymmetric pay-\nperformance sensitivity, whereby when performance is poor, the pay-performance relation is\nmuch smaller than when performance is strong. However, a higher proportion of non-\nexecutives strengthens the link between pay and performance when performance is poor.\nOur results on board size provide some support for the argument that problems of poor\ncommunication and decision-making undermine the effectiveness of large boards, at least\n22\nwith respect to the rate of increase in pay, if not the relation of pay to performance. Our\nevidence on the proportion of non-executives suggests that non-executive directors in the UK\nplay an important monitoring role in shaping changes in executive pay. This lies in contrast to\nthe argument that non-executive directors will not play an important monitoring role in the\nUK because of specific legal and institutional factors (Franks et al., 2001), and to previous\nUK studies which find that non-executives do not play an important monitoring role in terms\nof CEO dismissals. One possibility is that non-executive directors in the UK are more\neffective at certain monitoring tasks than others, and more effective for example, at setting\nexecutive pay than at dismissing poorly performing CEOs.\nWe find that firms that adopt the Cadbury Code\u2019s recommendation of having at least three\nnon-executive directors subsequently experience a lower rate of increase in pay and stronger\npay-performance sensitivity. This suggests that our results are less likely to be driven by\nendogeneity problems and that corporate governance reforms can possibly improve the\neffectiveness of executive pay, a conclusion similar to that reached by recent US evidence\n(Chhaochharia and Grinstein, 2009). However, it is noteworthy that this positive effect only\napplies to those firms that actually adopt the recommendation. For all firms as a whole\nfollowing Cadbury, there is if anything a higher rate of increase in pay and a decrease in the\nrelation between pay and performance.\nThe corporate governance reforms of recent years, both in the UK and elsewhere in the\nworld, have argued that a higher proportion of non-executives will improve corporate\ngovernance in a number of areas, one of which is executive pay. It is argued that a higher\nproportion of non-executives will lead to both less excessive pay growth and a stronger link\nbetween pay and performance. Our evidence shows that this argument has well founded\nempirical support. Given the increased importance attached to non-executive directors in the\nsetting of executive pay around the world, and the adoption of reforms similar to those seen in\nthe UK, our findings are of widespread relevance.\n23\nBibliography\nAggarwal, R., and Samwick, A. 1999.

Pay is the logarithm of the cash compensation (salary plus\nbonus plus the cash equivalents of any perquisites but excluding pension contributions) of the highest paid\ndirector. Size is the logarithm of company sales adjusted for inflation. Return is the logarithm of the buy and\nhold share return over the 12 months preceding the financial year end. Standard deviation is the standard\ndeviation of monthly share returns over the 12 months preceding the financial year end. %Non-executives is the\nnumber of non-executive directors divided by the total number of directors. Board size is the logarithm of the\ntotal number of directors on the board.\n31\nTable 4.

It firstly splits this\nsubsample according to whether, before Cadbury (30\/06\/1993), the firm always has, never has, or sometimes has three non-executive directors. It secondly splits these\nsub samples according to whether after Cadbury the firm always has, never has, or sometimes has three non-executive directors. If the latter, a further classification is\nmade according to whether, once the firm has three non-executive directors, it always maintains at least three non-executive directors or whether it then reverts to less\nthan three. The sample of 1,046 firms can be split into 12 separate groups on these criteria. In the final row of the table, we classify the firms into two groups according\nto whether they are adopters (402 firms), or not (644 firms).\nTable 7.

The model is estimated using the Arrellano and Bond (1991)\ngeneralised method of moments procedure. This procedure uses first differences of the dependent and\nindependent variables, and instruments the first difference of prior pay using levels of all variables dated it-2 and\nearlier. Post-Cadbury is a dummy variable set equal to one for all financial years after Cadbury (30\/06\/1993),\nzero for all years prior. Adopters is a dummy variable set equal to one for those firms classified as adopters in\nTable 6, zero otherwise. Adopters post-Cadbury is a dummy variable set equal to one for all years after which\nAdopters have adopted Cadbury, zero for all years prior to this. Other variables are as defined in Table 3 above.\nThe sample employed in Column (1) is the 402 sample firms which have firm year observations both before and\nafter the Cadbury Code (30\/06\/1993), and are identified as adopters in Table 6. The samples employed in\nColumns (2) and (3) are all the 1,046 sample firms for which we have firm year observations both before and\nafter the Cadbury Code (30\/06\/1993). The Sargan statistic tests for over-identifying restrictions, and is\nasymptotically distributed as \u03c72 under the null hypothesis of valid instruments. The serial correlation statistic\ntests the absence of second-order correlation in the residuals, and is asymptotically distributed as N (0,1) under\nthe null hypothesis of no serial correlation. P-values are provided in parentheses. a, b and c denote significance at\nthe 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively.\n35\nNotes\n1 Previous studies have attempted to overcome simultaneous endogeneity by employing\ninstrumental variable techniques. However, such regressions require the identification of\nstrictly exogenous instrumental variables which Wintoki (2007) argues is almost impossible\nin a corporate governance setting.\n2 The majority of empirical studies, reviewed by Hermalin and Weisbach (2003), document a\nnegative association between board size and firm performance.\n3 These include the requirements that all firms must have a majority of independent directors\nand that all board committees consist of independent directors only.\n4 Although the proportion of non-executives increased following Cadbury (Dahya et al.,\n2002; and Guest, 2008), it is still relatively low and non-executive director independence is\nstill weak due to an appointment process which is too informal (Higgs, 2003).\n5 However, there is evidence that firms which increase the number of non-executive directors\nfollowing the Cadbury recommendations experience better monitoring in terms of CEO\nturnover (Dahya et al., 2002) and better overall performance (Dahya and McConnell, 2007).\n6 For more details on the establishment of the Cadbury Committee, see Dahya et al. (2002).\n7 Another key recommendation of Cadbury was that the CEO and Chairman should be\nseparate directors. Conyon and Leech (1994), Conyon (1997), and Benito and Conyon (1999)\nfind no evidence that the CEO-Chairman separation has a significant effect on executive pay.\n8 Although compliance with the Greenbury (1995) disclosure recommendation was initially\non a comply or explain basis, in 2002 it was made a statutory requirement.\n9 Due to data availability on Datastream, we are only able to classify directors as executive or\nnon-executive, and not in terms of finer classifications of independence. This approach is\nsimilar to most previous large sample studies for both the US and UK.\n10 Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) show that pay is linked not just to firm but also to\nindustry performance, which they refer to as \u2018lucky\u2019 pay, and that strong corporate\n36\ngovernance reduces this link. We examine this by including the average industry share return\nas well as the firm return. The results, not tabulated, show that the coefficient for the industry\nreturn is positive but statistically insignificant, whilst the firm return coefficient is still\nsignificantly positive. Therefore we find no evidence that UK executive pay is impacted by\n\u2018luck\u2019. We further find no evidence that the link between pay and industry return is impacted\nby the proportion of non-executives or board size.\n11 For example, Guest (2008) shows that although Cadbury has a significant positive impact\non the proportion of non-executives, adoption of the Cadbury recommendation to employ at\nleast three non-executives is associated with many of the usual determinants of non-executive\nrepresentation.\n"}
