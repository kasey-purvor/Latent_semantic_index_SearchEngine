Interaction was dependent on Tie2 autophosphorylation but\nABIN-2 was not tyrosine phosphorylated by Tie2. Furthermore, in endothelial cells the interaction was stimulated by\nthe Tie2 ligand angiopoietin-1. Expression of ABIN-2 deletion mutants in endothelial cells suppressed the ability of\nangiopoietin-1 to inhibit phorbol ester\u2013stimulated NF-\u0001B\u2013dependent reporter gene activity. These findings provide the\nfirst direct link between Tie2 and a key regulator of inflammatory responses in endothelial cells. Interaction between\nTie2 and ABIN-2 may be important in the vascular protective antiinflammatory actions of Tie2.

These receptors are expressed\npredominantly in endothelial cells and are essential for vessel\nformation where they are required for the later stages of\nangiogenesis and vessel maintenance.1 Tie2 has roles in\ncontrol of microvessel sprouting, integrity, and maturation.\nMice deficient in this receptor exhibit decreased microvascu-\nlar integrity, reduced vessel sprouting, and endothelial cell\nloss.2,3 A number of ligands, designated the angiopoietins,\nhave been identified for Tie2.4\u20136 Unusually, this family of\nligands includes both activators and antagonists;\nangiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and angiopoietin-4 (Ang4) are able to\nstimulate Tie2 autophosphorylation and this can be inhibited\nby angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) and angiopoietin-3 (Ang3). In\naccord with the sprouting defects seen in Tie2-deficient mice,\nactivation of Tie2, by Ang1 or a derivative form of the\nagonist called Ang1*, has been shown to stimulate endothe-\nlial migration and sprouting of endothelial cords in collagen\ngels.7\u201311 Ang1 inhibits apoptosis of endothelial cells after\nserum deprivation,10,12\u201314 irradiation, and mannitol treat-\nment.15 Significant advances have been made in delineating\nthe signaling pathways by which Tie2 regulates endothelial\nmigration and survival. The p85 subunit of phosphatidylino-\nsitol 3-kinase (PI-3K) interacts with Tie2 and mediates the\neffects of the receptor on Akt activation and cell survival as\nwell as being partly involved in Tie2-regulated migra-\ntion.10,13,16 Tie2 has also been shown to bind to a docking\nprotein, Dok-R, that itself recruits downstream signaling\nproteins including Nck and rasGAP.17 Tie2 binding with\nDok-R mediates the effects of the receptor on endothelial\nmigration.18 The adapter proteins Grb2, 7, 14, and tyrosine\nphosphatase Shp2 have also been found to interact with\nTie2.10,19\nAng1 is a powerful inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF)\u2013 or inflammation-induced vascular leakage in\nvivo,20,21 and decreases permeability of endothelial monolay-\ners.22 Tie2 activation also exerts potent antiinflammatory\neffects on endothelial cells, decreasing VEGF- and tumor\nnecrosis factor (TNF)-\u0002\u2013induced leukocyte:endothelial adhe-\nsion and suppressing TNF-\u0002\u2013stimulated leukocyte transmi-\ngration across endothelial monolayers.22 Furthermore, stimu-\nlation of Tie2 inhibits expression of the NF-\u0001B\u2013responsive\ngenes intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular\ncell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin induced\nby VEGF,23 as well as tissue factor induced by TNF-\u0002 and\nVEGF.24 Tie2 suppression of endothelial activation and\nOriginal received August 28, 2002; revision received January 27, 2003; accepted February 12, 2003.\nFrom the Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department Surgery, University of Leicester, UK.\nCorrespondence to Nicholas P.J.

We find Tie2 directly\ninteracts with a potent regulator of inflammatory gene ex-\npression, A20 binding inhibitor of NF-\u0001B activation-2\n(ABIN-2). This interaction may be important in mediating the\ninhibitory effects of Tie2 on NF-\u0001B\u2013responsive genes and\nthereby have a key role in promoting neovessel quiescence\nand maturation.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe antibodies recognizing Tie1 and Tie2 were obtained from R&D\nSystems and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, and the monoclonal\nantibody against phosphotyrosine was from BD Transduction Lab-\noratories. cDNAs encoding human Ang1 and Tie2 were obtained\nfrom the American Tissue Culture Collection and the latter sub-\ncloned into the expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen Life Technolo-\ngies). Tie1 cDNA has previously been described.25 Endothelial cells\nwere obtained and cultured as previously described.25 Chinese\nhamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from the European\nCollection of Cell Cultures and maintained in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 \u0003g\/mL streptomycin, and 100\nU\/mL penicillin under 5% CO2\/95% air in a humidified incubator at\n37\u00b0C. Ang1* is a recombinant form of Ang1, with improved\nsolubility and stability, in which amino acid residues 1 to 77 of Ang1\nare replaced with residues 1 to 73 of Ang2 and Cys265 of Ang1\nsubstituted with Ser.5,26 cDNA encoding Ang1*, incorporating the\ncarboxy-terminal human IgG1 Fc extension (obtained from human\nplacental cDNA), was generated by site directed mutagenesis and\nPCR from human Ang1 cDNA, sequenced and cloned into\npcDNA3.1. The plasmid was transfected into CHO cells and stable\nAng1* expressing clones selected using G418 (0.5 mg\/mL). Recom-\nbinant Ang1* was isolated by affinity chromatography on protein G\nor protein A sepharose from medium conditioned by CHO cells. The\nyield of functionally active product was measured by BIAcore, using\nimmobilized human Tie2\/Fc chimera and a standard of Ang2 (both\nfrom R&D Systems). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich\nCompany or sources described previously.25\nYeast Two-Hybrid Analysis\nThe yeast strains PJ69-4A and PJ69-4\u0002 were generously supplied by\nDr Philip James (University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis).27 Yeast\ntwo-hybrid screening was performed using a library, kindly provided\nby Drs Emma Knight and Sally Prigent (University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK), in which the pVP16 activation domain (AD) was\nligated to 350 to 700 bp fragments of human dermal microvascular\nendothelial cDNA.28 The library was transformed into the PJ69-4A\nyeast strain expressing the cytoplasmic domain of Tie2 (nt 2525-\n3540) or Tie1 (nt 2509-3452) in pBD-GAL4 vector (Stratagene)\nusing the lithium acetate-base method of transformation. Proteins\ninteracting with Tie2 were detected by their ability to reconstitute the\nGal4 transcriptional regulator leading to induction of HIS3, LacZ,\nand Ade2 reporter genes. Transformants were plated on synthetic\nmedium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, supplemented\nwith 5 mmol\/L 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Growing colonies\nwere replated onto synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, and\ntryptophan and supplemented with 10 mmol\/L 3-AT.\n\u0004-Galactosidase activity of growing colonies was tested using colony\nnitrocellulose filter lift assays. His\u0001 and \u0004-galactosidase positive\ntransformants were further screened for Ade2 reporter gene activity\nby replating onto synthetic medium lacking adenine, leucine, and\ntryptophan supplemented with histidine. Library plasmids whose\ninteractions with bait resulted in transcriptional activation of all three\nreporter genes were recovered into Escherichia coli HB 101 cells\nplated onto medium lacking leucine and analyzed further by DNA\nsequencing and additional interaction analysis. Interactions were\nfurther tested by mating yeast PJ69-4A and PJ694-\u0002 strains contain-\ning either an AD or BD-plasmid, as indicated in Results, and\nanalyzing for histidine, adenine, and \u0004-galactosidase reporter activity\nas before.\nCloning of Full-Length Human 9.1\nThe sequence of full-length 9.1 was determined using RACE cDNA\namplification (Clontech). 5\u0002- and 3\u0002-RACE reactions were performed\nusing cDNA templates synthesized from human placental RNA and the\nforward priming gene specific primer 3GSP9.1 (5\u0002-TGGCCAAGTGT-\nCTGGATGAACGACAGC-3\u0002) and the reverse primer 5GSP9.1 (5\u0002-\nCGCTGCCACTTGGCATTGAGGTCTTC-3\u0002). To facilitate insertion\nof full-length 9.1 into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector the coding sequence\nwas amplified. DNA sequencing was performed on both strands by\nCytomyx. (Cambridge).\nExpression in Mammalian Cells\nFor expression of full-length and deleted versions of 9.1, the relevant\ncDNA sequences were subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 expression\nvectors (Sigma) in-frame with the amino-terminal FLAG-epitope\ntag. Deletion mutants were constructed using existing restriction\nsites within the full-length sequence. Site directed mutagenesis of\nTie2 was performed using QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis\nKit (Stratagene) and the specific mutation confirmed by DNA\nsequencing. Expression vectors were transfected into CHO and\nendothelial cells using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) or\nTargefect F-2 (Targeting Systems).\nRT-PCR\nIsolation of total RNA from human umbilical vein endothelial cells\n(HUVECs), HeLa, Jurkat, and 293 cells was performed using the\nRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA synthesis was performed using\nOmniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). cDNA templates were\nscreened for the presence of 9.1 by PCR using 5GSP9.1 and\n3GSP9.1 primers and human glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase primers (Stratagene). Reaction products were visualized by\nethidium bromide staining after\nImmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting\nCells were washed in PBS and lysed at 4\u00b0C in ice-cold lysis buffer\n(50 mmol\/L Tris, pH 7.4, containing 50 mmol\/L NaCl, 1% Triton\nX-100, 1 mmol\/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol\/L EGTA, 1 mmol\/L\naminoethylbenzenesulfonic acid, 1 \u0003g\/mL leupeptin, 1 \u0003g\/mL apro-\ntinin, 1 \u0003g\/mL pepstatin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at\n12 000g for 10 minutes and then incubated for 2 hours or overnight\nat 4\u00b0C with 4 \u0003g\/mL of the appropriate antibody and protein\nG-agarose beads. Immune complexes were washed extensively with\nlysis buffer and proteins eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer\nin the presence of 100 mmol\/L DTT. Proteins were separated by SDS\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose\nmembranes, and probed with appropriate antibodies. Immunoreac-\ntive proteins were visualized with a peroxidase conjugated secondary\nantibody and a chemiluminescent detection system.29\nNF-\u0001B Reporter Assays\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown to\n80% confluence in 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1 \u0003g\/dish of\nDNA, comprising 500 ng of the NF-\u0001B\u2013responsive luciferase\nreporter pNF-\u0001B-Luc (Stratagene), 100 ng of the pRL-TK reporter\n(Promega), in which Renilla luciferase activity is constitutively\nexpressed under the control of the moderate herpes simplex virus\nthymidine kinase promoter, and 400 ng of control or test plasmid.\nAfter 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and medium replaced\nwith serum-free medium. Cells were activated by phorbol 12-myris-\nHughes et al Interaction Between Tie2 and NF-\u0001B Inhibitor 631\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on August 19, 2013http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/Downloaded from \ntate 13-actetate (PMA) at a final concentration of 5 ng\/mL for 4\nhours. Where Ang1* was present, it was added to a final concentra-\ntion of 400 ng\/mL 15 minutes before PMA. Luciferase reporter gene\nactivities were measured in cell lysates using the Dual Luciferase\nReporter Assay (Promega) and NF-\u0001B\u2013activated reporter activity\nwas normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to correct for any\ndifferences in transfection efficiency.\nResults\nYeast Two-Hybrid Screen\nIn order to gain insight into the signaling pathways utilized by\nTie2, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify\nproteins that interact with the intracellular domain of this\nreceptor. A cDNA library derived from human dermal mi-\ncrovascular endothelial cells was interrogated with a fusion\nprotein comprising the cytoplasmic domain of Tie2 fused\nin-frame with a Gal4 DNA binding domain. This Tie2 fusion\nprotein was found to exhibit constitutive tyrosine phosphor-\nylation when expressed in yeast (Figure 1A). A number of\nclones were identified during the screen as encoding proteins\nthat interact with Tie2 and these included a novel partial\ncDNA sequence designated clone 9.1. This clone consistently\nand strongly activated histidine, adenine, and \u0004-galactosidase\nreporters in the yeast two-hybrid system (Figure 1B). Neither\nclone 9.1 nor the Tie2-binding domain activated reporters\nwhen expressed alone. The interaction with Tie2 was specific\nin that the Tie1 cytoplasmic domain failed to interact with\nclone 9.1 (Figure 1B). One reason for screening a microvas-\ncular endothelial cell library was the possibility that such a\nlibrary may contain cell-specific interacting proteins for this\nendothelial receptor tyrosine kinase. To examine whether\nclone 9.1 was expressed specifically in endothelial cells\nmRNA from several cell lines, namely the cervical adenocar-\ncinoma line HeLa, lymphocytic Jurkat line, and kidney\nepithelial 293 cells, as well as HUVECs, were probed by\nRT-PCR. This demonstrated expression was not specific for\nendothelial cells (Figure 1C).\nInteraction in Mammalian Cells\nTo confirm the protein encoded by clone 9.1 interacts with\nTie2 in mammalian cells, the open reading frame of 9.1 was\ncloned downstream of a FLAG-epitope tag and coexpressed\nin CHO cells with full-length Tie2. After expression cells\nwere lysed and FLAG-9.1 immunoprecipitated via the\nepitope tag. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by\nSDS-PAGE and probed for the presence of Tie2 (Figure 2).\nTie2 was coimmunoprecipitated with 9.1 confirming the\ninteraction can occur in mammalian cells. Tie2 was not\ndetected in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with\nTie2 and FLAG vector. The specificity of interaction of 9.1\nwith members of the Tie family was tested in mammalian\ncells by cotransfection of FLAG-9.1 with full-length Tie1 in\nCHO cells and immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged 9.1.\nConsistent with the findings in the yeast two-hybrid system,\nonly background levels of Tie1 coimmunoprecipitated with\nFLAG-9.1, indicating a lack of interaction between these two\nmolecules in mammalian cells (Figure 2).\nRapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to\ndetermine the 5\u0002 and 3\u0002 ends of clone 9.1. This resulted in an\napproximately 2-kb sequence containing a putative initiation\nmethionine and an open reading frame of 1287 bp, stop\ncodon, and 3\u0002-untranslated region (Figure 3A). Full-length\n9.1 encodes a predicted protein of 429 amino acids and\ncalculated relative molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa.\nThe protein contains two regions, between residues 84 to 114\nand 255 to 305, with a high predicted probability of forming\ncoiled-coil domains,30 suggesting the possibility that it may\nform oligomers. In the course of the present investigation, a\nmouse sequence designated A20-binding inhibitor of nuclear\nfactor-\u0001B activation-2 (ABIN-2) was reported.31 Full-length\nFigure 1.

In addition, deletion mutants were constructed in an\nattempt to define the region within 9.1 responsible for\ninteraction with Tie2. Epitope-tagged human ABIN-2 and\ndeletion mutants or empty FLAG-vector were cotransfected\ninto CHO cells with Tie2. Twenty-four hours after transfec-\ntion full-length and deleted proteins were recovered by\nimmunoprecipitation from lysates with an antibody against\nthe FLAG-epitope. Tie2 coimmunoprecipitated with human\nABIN-2, indicating the interaction domain originally identi-\nfied in the 9.1 fragment (amino acids 171 to 272) was\navailable to interact with the receptor tyrosine kinase. Dele-\ntions of residues 229 to 272 of the 171 to 272 fragment\nresulted in loss of interaction with Tie2. Thus, the C-terminal\n44 amino acid residues of 171 to 272 are required for\ninteraction with Tie2 (Figure 3C).\nPhosphotyrosine Dependence of Interaction\nTo determine whether 9.1 interaction with Tie2 was\nphosphotyrosine-dependent a mutant form of Tie2 was con-\nstructed in which the invariant lysine in the ATP binding site\nof the kinase was replaced with arginine. As shown in Figure\n4A, when expressed in CHO cells, wild-type Tie2 was\nconstitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. The kinase-negative\nTie2K855R, however, was not tyrosine phosphorylated. Wild-\ntype Tie2 or Tie2K855R were coexpressed with 9.1 in CHO\ncells and interaction determined by coimmunoprecipitation\nanalysis. Wild-type Tie2 but not the unphosphorylated\nTie2K855R was coimmunoprecipitated with 9.1, indicating the\ninteraction is phosphotyrosine-dependent. The effect of Tie2\non tyrosine phosphorylation status of human ABIN-2 was\nanalyzed by coexpressing the protein with Tie2 in CHO cells\nand antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Figure 4C). Hu-\nman ABIN-2 showed no evidence of tyrosine phosphoryla-\ntion when coexpressed with kinase active Tie2.\nRegulation by Angiopoietin-1\nData from the two-hybrid screen, together with the coimmu-\nnoprecipitation analyses, suggest ABIN-2 could interact with\nTie2 in endothelial cells after activation of receptor phosphor-\nylation. Endogenous ABIN-2 is highly sensitive to proteoly-\nsis and cannot be immunoprecipitated under conditions that\nwould preserve interactions with other proteins.31 Therefore,\nto determine whether ligand-regulated interaction could occur\nin endothelial cells expressing physiological levels of Tie2,\nHUVECs were transfected with epitope-tagged 9.1. Twenty-\nfours hours after transfection HUVECs were stimulated with\nAng1* for 10 minutes, lysed, and subjected to immunopre-\ncipitation with an antibody recognizing the FLAG-epitope.\nAng1* is a modified version of Ang1 that is more stable and\nmore readily purified.5 Ang1* stimulated the interaction\nFigure 3.

Twenty-\nfour hours later, lysates were prepared\nand expressed full-length (human\nABIN-2) and deleted 9.1 recovered by\nimmunoprecipitation with an antibody\nrecognizing the epitope tag. Proteins in\nimmunoprecipitates (Ip) and whole-cell\nlysates (Wcl) were resolved by SDS-\nPAGE and ABIN-2, 9.1, \u0004C, and Tie2\ndetected by immunoblotting.\nHughes et al Interaction Between Tie2 and NF-\u0001B Inhibitor 633\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on August 19, 2013http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/Downloaded from \nbetween 9.1 and endogenous Tie2 in endothelial cells, as\njudged by the increased levels of Tie2 coimmunoprecipitated\nfrom the stimulated cells (Figure 5). As expected, this\ncoimmunoprecipitated Tie2 was tyrosine phosphorylated.\nUnder the conditions of this study, unactivated HUVECs\nexhibited a low level of tyrosine phosphorylated Tie2 that\ncoimmunoprecipitated with 9.1.\nEffects of ABIN-2 Deletion Mutants on NF-\u0001B\nActivity in Endothelial Cells\nThe potent NF-\u0001B inhibitory activity of ABIN-231 suggest\nthis molecule may be a candidate for mediating Tie2 inhibi-\ntion of NF-\u0001B\u2013dependent gene expression. Recruitment of\nABIN-2 to stimulated Tie2 could, directly or indirectly,\nactivate the NF-\u0001B inhibitory activity of ABIN-2 leading to\nsuppression of inflammatory gene expression. If interaction\nbetween ABIN-2 and Tie2 has a role in Tie2 inhibition of\nNF-\u0001B, then expression of deleted forms of ABIN-2, con-\ntaining the Tie2 interaction site but lacking NF-\u0001B inhibitory\nactivity, would be expected to suppress Tie2 inhibition of\nNF-\u0001B. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal 90 amino acid\nresidues of ABIN-2 removes its ability to inhibit NF-\u0001B.31\nThe possibility that deletion-mutants of human ABIN-2 could\nact in such a dominant-negative manner was examined in\nHUVECs. Endothelial cells were transfected with a control\nplasmid (GFP) or the ABIN-2 fragment designated 9.1\n(encompassing amino acid residues 171 to 272), together with\nan NF-\u0001B\u2013dependent reporter gene. Twenty-four hours later,\ncells were washed and pretreated with control vehicle or\nAng1* for 15 minutes, then activated with phorbol ester for\nan additional 4 hours before measurement of reporter gene\nactivity. PMA stimulated the activity of NF-\u0001B in control\ntransfected cells and this was prevented by Ang1* (Figure 6).\nFigure 4. Interaction between Tie2 and\n9.1 is phosphotyrosine-dependent.

This may reflect 9.1 inhibiting a\nlimitation on activated NF-\u0001B exerted by the low level of\nTie2:ABIN-2 interaction seen in the absence of Ang1* under\nour experimental conditions (Figure 5), or it may be due to\nsome unknown direct effect of 9.1 on the NF-\u0001B system.\nTherefore, we also examined a deletion mutant corresponding\nto amino acids 1 to 340 of human ABIN-2. This mutant,\ndesignated ABIN-2 (1-340), lacks only the C-terminal 90\namino acid residues and has been shown to have no direct\neffects on NF-\u0001B or A20-mediated NF-\u0001B inhibition.31\nABIN-2 (1-340) was more effective than 9.1, completely\nreversing the inhibitory effect of Ang1* on PMA-stimulated\nNF-\u0001B activity in endothelial cells (Figure 6) and signifi-\ncantly suppressing Ang1* inhibition by 111.7\u00067.4%\n(P\u00050.01, paired t test, n\u00073). These data suggest ABIN-2 has\na functional role in regulation of activated NF-\u0001B by Tie2.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates that the endothelial receptor tyrosine\nkinase Tie2 interacts with the NF-\u0001B regulatory protein\nABIN-2. This novel interaction provides a direct link between\nthe receptor tyrosine kinase and a key regulator of NF-\u0001B\nactivity, providing a potential route for the potent vascular\nprotective antiinflammatory effects of Tie2.\nABIN-2 is a recently discovered binding partner for the\nzinc finger protein A20.31 NF-\u0001B activation in response to a\nwide range of stimuli, including TNF-\u0002, interleukin-1, and\nphorbol esters, is inhibited in endothelial and other cells by\nA20.32,33 The A20 gene was originally identified as an early\nresponse gene in endothelial cells, induced by TNF-\u0002,\ninterleukin-1, and lipopolysacharide.34 A20 functions as a\nfeedback inhibitor of the NF-\u0001B pathway, the zinc finger\nprotein being both induced by, and itself inhibiting, NF-\u0001B.35\nIndeed, TNF-\u0002\u2013induced NF-\u0001B activity fails to terminate in\ncells lacking A20.35 Furthermore, transgenic mice deficient in\nA20 are highly responsive to TNF-\u0002 and LPS and develop\nsevere inflammation.36 The precise mechanism whereby A20\ninhibits NF-\u0001B activity is not yet clear. The protein is known\nto bind to IKK\u0005\/NEMO, a key regulatory component of the\nIKK complex that controls activation of NF-\u0001B via phosphor-\nylation of the I\u0001B inhibitory protein.37 Interestingly, binding\nof A20 alone to IKK\u0005\/NEMO is not sufficient to inhibit\nNF-\u0001B, suggesting possible involvement of additional mole-\ncules.38 ABIN-2 inhibits NF-\u0001B when expressed in mamma-\nlian cells31 and, along with the related but structurally distinct\nprotein ABIN-1, has been suggested as a possible effector of\nA20 inhibition of NF-\u0001B.31,38,39 It is not yet known whether\nthe NF-\u0001B inhibitory activity of ABIN-2 requires the mole-\ncule to interact with A20. The finding that a mutant form of\nABIN-2 that binds A20 but lacks the NF-\u0001B inhibitory motif\nis unable to act as a dominant-negative for ABIN-2 or A20\nindicates the complexity of the mechanism by which ABIN-2,\nA20, and other regulators of NF-\u0001B interact to control this\ntranscription factor.31\nThere is increasing evidence that Tie2 activation is asso-\nciated with antiinflammatory effects in endothelial cells.\nActivation of Tie2 suppresses TNF-\u0002\u2013induced leukocyte\ntransmigration through endothelial monolayers.22 Further-\nmore, the Tie2 agonist Ang1 inhibits VEGF-induced leuko-\ncyte adhesion to endothelial cells and VEGF-stimulated\nendothelial ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression as\nwell as VEGF- and TNF-stimulated tissue factor expres-\nsion.23,24 These molecules are all known to be regulated by\nthe NF-\u0001B system. Interestingly, inhibition of Akt\/PI-3K\nenhances the stimulatory effects of VEGF and TNF on\nexpression of tissue factor, and VEGF on ICAM-1, VCAM-1,\nand E-selectin, indicating an important role for these ki-\nnases.23,24 The inhibitory effects of ABIN-2 on NF-\u0001B\nactivity,31 and the present finding that activated Tie2 can\ninteract with ABIN-2, suggest the Tie2:ABIN-2 interaction\nmay have a functional role in mediating Tie2 inhibition of\nNF-\u0001B. Ang1 activation of Tie2 leading to receptor phos-\nphorylation would allow recruitment of ABIN-2 to the\nreceptor permitting activation of its NF\u0001B inhibitory activity.\nInhibition of NF-\u0001B could then occur by a direct action of\nactivated ABIN-2 or via further interaction of activated\nABIN-2 with A20. The mechanisms regulating ABIN-2\nactivity have yet to be defined but could include conforma-\ntional changes resulting from protein:protein interaction or\nchanges in serine\/threonine phosphorylation. If Tie2 inhibi-\ntion of NF-\u0001B involves ABIN-2, it would be expected that\nthis could be suppressed by expression of deleted forms of\nABIN-2 containing the Tie2 binding sequence but lacking\nNF-\u0001B inhibitory activity. In the present study, two such\ndeleted forms of ABIN-2, the 9.1 fragment and ABIN-2\n(1-340), were found to suppress the effects of Ang1* on\nPMA-activated NF-\u0001B activity. The 9.1 fragment only par-\ntially suppressed Ang1* inhibition of NF-\u0001B. This may\nreflect a lower affinity or limited ability of this short fragment\nto compete with endogenous ABIN-2 for binding. ABIN-2(1\nto 340) however had more potent dominant-negative activity\nand completely suppressed the effects of Ang1* on stimu-\nlated NF-\u0001B activity. These data suggest that ABIN-2 has a\nfunctional role in mediating Tie2 inhibition of activated\nNF-\u0001B. Very little is known about ABIN-2 and further work\nwill be required to determine the mechanisms by which the\nmolecule is regulated and precisely how it controls NF-\u0001B\nactivity.\nIn summary, our data demonstrate Tie2 interacts with the\nnovel regulator of NF-\u0001B activity ABIN-2. This interaction\nprovides a direct molecular link between the tyrosine kinase\nand the NF-\u0001B system that may be important in the antiin-\nflammatory and prostabilizing actions of Tie2 in endothelial\ncells and microvessels.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Project Grant\n062645).
