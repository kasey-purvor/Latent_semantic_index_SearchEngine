This \nobservation may illuminate the evolution of contrasting coping styles and behavioural \nsyndromes, as occurrence of phenotypes in different environments and their response to \nselective pressures can be precisely and easily recorded. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nWithin the last decade, several influential publications have promoted the recognition of \nindividual differences within a population as biologically meaningful adaptive traits \n(Koolhaas et al. 1999; Wilson 1998), and the emerging conceptual framework for \nindividuality has had important consequences to both evolutionary ecology, animal \nhusbandry, and biomedicine (Sih et al. 2004; Cavigelli 2005; Huntingford and Adams 2005; \nKorte et al., 2005; Reale et al. 2007). Individuals differ in the way they react towards stressful \nsituations and novelties, and selection studies in several species show that physiological and \nbehavioural responses to stress are often correlated in a coherent and heritable pattern (\u00d8verli \net al. 2005; van Oers et al. 2005). Stress-related physiological-behavioural trait associations \nare commonly referred to as stress coping styles (Koolhaas et al. 1999), while consistent \nindividual variation in behaviour across other situations have been denoted behavioural \nsyndromes, profiles, axes, temperament, or a shyness-boldness continuum  (Gosling 2001; Sih \net al. 2004; Wilson et al. 1994; R\u00e9ale et al. 2007). Notwithstanding a certain lack of consensus \nin terminology, the evolution of these analogues of human personality has evoked \nconsiderable scientific interest. Among the questions raised are by which mechanisms \nbehavioural syndromes are inherited, how the variation is maintained, which circumstances \nbenefit different complex phenotypes, and what are the costs and benefits of limited plasticity \nimposed by more or less fixed trait associations (DeWitt et al. 1998; Koolhaas et al. 1999; Sih \net al. 2004; Dingemanse and R\u00e9ale 2005; McElreath et al. 2007; R\u00e9ale et al. 2007; Wolf et al. \n2007).  \nSalmonid fish of the genera Oncorhynchus and Salmo attract the attention of both \nresearchers and the general public, on account of their biological characteristics and wide use \nin sport and recreational fishing, aquaculture, and research (see examples in Thorgaard et al. \n2002).  Salmonids are particularly known for their extensive genetic and life-history variation, \n4 \n \nresulting in part from their homing ability during spawning, with localized sub-populations \nbeing adapted to different sites and environments within a river system (Dittman and Quinn \n1996; Garcia de Leaniz et al. 2007). Previously, we have used strains of rainbow trout \n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for divergent (high-responsive, HR, and low-responsive, LR) \npost-stress cortisol levels to study heritable variation in neuroendocrine and behavioural stress \nresponses (\u00d8verli et al. 2005; Schjolden and Winberg 2007). Low post-stress cortisol levels \nare typically associated with proactive behavioural traits such as social dominance and \nboldness in new environments (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001; \u00d8verli et al. 2007). In contrast, \nhigh cortisol levels are associated with social subordinance and shyness (Pottinger and \nCarrick, 2001; \u00d8verli et al. 2007).  Furthermore, high cortisol levels may confer increased \nsusceptibility to some infectious diseases (Fevolden et al. 1992).  \nAnybody who has studied, fished for, handled, or consumed salmon or rainbow trout \nmay have noticed the black spots dappling the skin of these fishes. The spots are formed by \nspecialised chromatophores \u2013 melanophores (or melanocytes) - which produce the dark \npigment eumelanin (Bagnara 1998). During work with the fourth generation of HR-LR \nrainbow trout, it became evident that the two strains differed in pigment patterns. Specifically, \nLR fish exhibited far more eumelanin spots than HR fish. Melanin-based coloration in \nvertebrates and its association with behavioural syndromes was recently reviewed by Ducrest \net al. (2008). This literature review showed that darker wild vertebrates are generally more \naggressive, sexually active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals (Ducrest et al. 2008). \nFurthermore, in the barn owl (Tyto Alba) melanin-based colouration is associated with several \nbehavioural, morphological and physiological characteristics that have been linked to stress \ncoping ability (Almasi et al. 2008). \nBased on observations that HR and LR trout differed in melanin pigmentation our \nhypothesis was that spotted fish, in the closely related specie Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar), \n5 \n \nwould show a lower cortisol reponse to stress when compared to a non-spotted group of \nindividuals. Furthermore, several documented changes in the behaviour of the two trout lines \nmade us predict that also behaviour would differ between groups of spotted and non-spotted \nfish. The main focus of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis that there exist an \nassociation between melanin-based pigmentation and hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI-\naxis) reactivity in salmonid fish.  Furthermore, we tested the prediction that behavioural \ndifferences are present in two groups of fish chosen divergently on melanin pigmentation.  \n \nMaterials and methods \nQuantification of melanin-based coloration \nIn the studies described below, photographs of experimental fish were captured with a Canon \nEOS 450D digital camera and transferred to a computer for further analyses of melanin-based \ncoloration. Prior to photography, each fish were sedated in 200 mg\/l MS-222 and placed \nadjacent to a measuring tape with millimetre resolution, allowing for an accurate estimation of \nthe area where spots were counted. The degree of melanin-based coloration is presented as \nnumber of spots per cm2 of body surface in a defined area above the sideline, reaching from \nthe gill cover to the base of the dorsal fin. These data are intended only to document that \nmelanin- based coloration patterns differed between the HR-LR lines and between \nexperimental groups of Atlantic salmon, and more accurate calculations of pigmented areas of \ncurved skin surfaces were omitted at present.  \n \nHR and LR rainbow trout  \nThe HR and LR rainbow trout lines were initiated in 1996 by repeated stress testing (3 h \nconfinement in 50 l water once monthly) of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged 2-\nyear-old rainbow trout (for details see Pottinger and Carrick 1999). The mean post-stress \nplasma cortisol content across five episodes of confinement was used as a basis to create an \n6 \n \nF1 generation consisting of 15 HR and 14 LR families, each resulting from a unique male\u2013\nfemale crossing. Stress testing of the F1 generation was carried out on five different occasions \nbetween September 1997 and September 1998, and on five occasions in 1999. A highly \nsignificant parent-progeny regression in confinement-induced cortisol response was seen, and \nthe six LR families with the lowest mean cortisol response and the six HR families with the \nhighest mean cortisol response were identified and used in further breeding (Pottinger and \nCarrick 1999).  \n A series of behavioural studies, starting with adult F1 fish, have revealed that selection \nfor divergent cortisol responses is associated with multiple behavioural alterations in the HR-\nLR trout model. In summary, LR fish are characterized by a low locomotor response to acute \nstress, social dominance, and proactive behaviour in novel environments. HR individuals \nmost often become socially subordinate, they exhibit more shy behaviour in novel \nenvironments and are characterised by a high locomotor response to stress. These differences \nin behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to stress are well documented and reviewed \nelsewhere (\u00d8verli et al. 2002a; 2005, 2007; Schjolden and Winberg 2007). Therefore, no \nfurther behavioural studies using the HR-LR trout lines were included in this report. Melanin-\nbased colouration, i.e. spot density, was quantified in juvenile (age 6 months, weight 25.2 \u00b1 \n1.4 g, mean \u00b1 SEM, n=16) and adult (age 18 months, weight 434.3 \u00b1 18.3 g, mean \u00b1 SEM, \nn=20) fish from the F4 generation. Photographs of one adult HR and one LR fish are shown in \nFig. 1A. \n \nBehaviour and physiology during stress in Atlantic salmon   \nA group of 60 juvenile salmon from a commercial breeding programme (Aquagen AS, \nTrondheim, Norway) was raised from a size of approximately 20 g in freshwater in a 250-litre \nglass aquarium. When the fish had reached a size suitable for behavioural studies and blood \n7 \n \nsampling (population mean weight 74.7 g), we visually identified individuals that appeared as \n\"spotted\" or \"non-spotted\" (see example in Fig.1A), confirmed the difference by counting \neumelanin spots as described above, and subjected 8 individuals from each group to \nbehavioural tests previously used to describe alternative coping styles in rainbow trout (\u00d8verli \net al. 2006a; 2007).  \n Behavioural and physiological responses to acute stress were investigated by a \nconfinement test. Each individual was subjected to 30 minutes of confinement in a transparent \nplastic chamber with 1 l aerated water. During acute challenges, high cortisol production is \ntypically associated with high locomotor activity, while low-responsive individuals settle \ndown quickly (\u00d8verli et al. 2002a; 2006a). The difference between alternative stress-coping \nstyles is typically not apparent until 10-15 min after the initiation of stress. Therefore, 10 \nminutes after initiation of acute stress, behaviour was videotaped for a duration of 15 minutes \n(Canon Digital Videocamera MD101) for analysis of locomotor activity (% of observation \ntime spent moving). At 30 min following the onset of stress, the fish were anaesthetized by a \nhigh dose of MS-222 (500 mg\/l). Within two minutes after capture blood samples were drawn \nfrom the caudal vein using heparinized 1 ml syringes. The blood samples were kept on ice \nuntil centrifuged for 7 minutes at 10 000 rpm. Plasma were decanted off and frozen at -80 \u00baC \nuntil analyses of plasma cortisol content. Plasma cortisol concentrations were quantified using \na radioimmuno assay (RIA) after the protocol of Pickering et al. (1987). All samples were \nanalysed in a single assay, and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.1% (n=8). The \nantibody used was Abcam@1:1500 and the lower detection limit for the assay was 0.3 ng\/ml. \nCross-reactivity of the antibody with cortisone, the most abundant potential competitor in \nrainbow trout and salmon plasma, was 2.6%.  \n One week prior to the confinement test experimental fish were weighed and isolated in \n250-litre aquaria divided into four compartments by removable, opaque PVC walls. There \n8 \n \nwas no significant difference in weight between spotted and non-spotted fish prior to the \nbehavioural tests (mean \u00b1 SEM: 76.9\u00b14.5 g and 65.9\u00b15.3 g, respectively, t[14]=1.60, p=0.33). \nTest aquaria were supplied with a continuous flow of aerated tap water (1.0 l\/min) at 8 \u00b0C. \nLight was provided by fluorescent tubes (30 W, natural light) 25 cm above the aquaria, and \nthe diurnal cycle was 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. The fish were fed once a day \nfor 8 days beginning at the day of transfer from group rearing. During feeding trials fish were \nhandfed with commercial pelleted fish feed, until the fish had rejected to eat three consecutive \npellets. The total amount of food consumed daily during the test period was registered and \nexpressed relative to the body mass for each individual. Behavioural observations, blood \nsampling and feeding took place between 12.00 and 14.00. All animal procedures were \napproved by the local Laboratory animal\u2019s sciences committee. In general, unnecessary \ndistress was as far as possible avoided.  \n. \n \nStatistical analysis \nAll data were checked for homogeneity of variance (Levene\u2019s test) and normality \n(Kolmogorov-Smirnov method). Time spent moving was analysed by non-parametric median \ntest. All other data are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M., and group differences were analysed \nusing parametric t-tests (Statistica for Windows software package and JMP version 7.0). The \namount of food ingested (a continuous, normally distributed variable) was expressed as group \nmean \u00b1 S.E.M. on each day, and analysed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed \nby the Tukey post-hoc test.  \n \nResults \nMelanin-based colouration in trout and salmon \nMelanin-based colouration differed significantly in both juvenile (t[14 ]=3.3, p=0.005)  \n9 \n \nand adult (t[18] = 5.4, p<0.001) HR and LR trout, with individuals from the LR selection line \nconsistently exhibiting more melanin spots per cm2 than HR individuals (Fig.2A-B). Juvenile \nsalmon were on average less spotted than juvenile rainbow trout, while variation between \ngroups based on visual identification was highly significant (t[14]=9.7, p<0.001, Fig. 2C).  \n \nBehaviour and physiology of spotted and non-spotted Atlantic salmon \n Post-stress cortisol response \nAnalysis of cortisol levels after a 30 minute confinement challenge revealed differences \nbetween the spotted and non-spotted group. The spotted group showed significantly lower \npost-stress plasma cortisol levels than their non-spotted conspecifics (t[14]=4.1, p=0.001) \n(Fig.3A).  \n \nLocomcotor behaviour under acute stress \nLocomotor activity during the acute confinement challenge was characterized by active \nswimming attempts against the walls or other locomotor escape behaviour. The amount of \nlocomotor behaviour differed significantly between the two groups. Spotted fish spent less \ntime moving when compared to non-spotted individuals (\u03c72= 4.0, p=0.046) (Fig 3B).  \n \nFeed intake \nNeither spotted nor non-spotted fish showed any feed intake on the day after transfer to \nisolation. On the second day, one individual in each group took a few pellets falling directly \nin front of its mouth, while all other fish still showed complete anorexia. Thereafter, feed \nintake increased gradually in both groups, but with a generally quicker resumption of normal \nfeeding behaviour in the spotted group.  Feed intake throughout the experiment expressed as \nconsumed food relative to body weight is shown in Fig. 4. For this variable, repeated \n10 \n \nmeasures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of time (F[7,98]=17.3, p<0.001) and a \nsignificant interaction between time and group (F[7,98]=3.8, p=0.001), with post-hoc tests \nindicating significant group differences on single days only on day 7, at which spotted fish \nconsumed more food than non-spotted conspecifics. \n \nIn addition to group means, we investigated whether there were significant correlations \nbetween different parameters within each group. There were no significant correlations \nbetween behaviours, cortisol response and spots within each group. This result does not imply \nthat behavioural syndromes, behavioural-physiological or behavioural-morphological \ncorrelations were not present in the population as such, since 1) The number of individuals \nanalysed here was tailored to reveal differences in group means, and 2) There was restricted \nvariation within in each group, as groups were selected to represent the opposite ends of a \ncontinuum within a larger population.  \n \nDiscussion \nAquatic animals are known for physiological and environmentally induced colour \nchanges which involve melanophore dispersal and contraction (Baker 1993; Nery and de \nLauro Castrucci 1997; H\u00f6glund et al. 2000). However, there is little evidence that persistent \nmelanin-based pigment patterns arising from melanophore aggregations in fishes are subject \nto environmental influence. In teleosts, pigment patterns have been addressed mainly in the \nDanio fish model to study genes underlying evolutionary change in cell development, and \ntheir effects on adult form (see e.g. Kelsh et al. 2000; Mills et al. 2007). One of the few \nstudies dealing with this topic in salmonid fish reports strong heritability in the number of \nblack skin spots, with weak genotype-by-environment interactions across environments \n(Kause et al. 2004). The current study demonstrates that eumelanin pigmentation patterns are \n11 \n \nassociated with, and can be co-selected with, responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary-\ninterrenal axis (HPI-axis, the teleost equivalent of the mammalian HPA-axis). Furthermore, \nbehavioural components of genetically determined stress coping styles also differ between \nmore or less pigmented individuals.  \n  Spotted salmon had significantly lower post-stress cortisol levels than those of their \nnon-spotted conspecifics, furthermore spotted fish spent less time moving during acute stress \nwhen compared to non-spotted individuals. These aspects of the behaviour and physiology of \nspotted and non-spotted Atlantic salmon are entirely consistent with the behavioural patterns \npreviously reported in LR and HR trout, respectively (\u00d8verli et al. 2002a; 2005; 2007; \nSchjolden and Winberg 2007). In ethological studies, care must be taken to interpret the \nfunctional significance of behaviour shown by animals in a laboratory setting. The \ninterpretation of time spent moving during confinement may have alternative explanations. It \nis possible that the fish that moved less were indeed stressed, but displayed fear-related \nfreezing behaviour. Nevertheless, taken together with the data on plasma cortisol we argue \nthat time spent moving is more likely related to stress response, in that individuals who move \nmore show an elevated or prolonged physiological stress response compared to individuals \nthat move less. This interpretation is in accordance with reported short-term stimulatory \neffects of cortisol and corticotrophin-releasing factor on locomotion (\u00d8verli et al. 2002b; \nLowry and Moore 2006; Carpenter et al. 2007).  Almasi et al. (2008) found that the amount of \neumelanin predicted parental provisioning in the barn owl and that individuals with large \nspots had a less pronounced behavioural change when exposed to exogenous corticosterone (a \nsimulated stressful situation). Also in the present study individuals with higher amount of \neumelanin (spotted group) showed a reduced behavioural response to a stressful situation \ncompared to the non-spotted group. \n12 \n \n Speed of release from stress-induced anorexia has previously been found to correlate \npositively with social dominance, and negatively with locomotor behaviour during acute \nstress (\u00d8verli et al. 2004; 2006a). It could be argued that feeding in isolation reflects \nmotivation to feed and differences in hunger at the time of testing, rather than stress \nresponsiveness. A recent study has provided evidence that melanocortins play an important \nrole in the regulation of energy homeostasis in salmonid fish (Schjolden et al. 2009). \nFurthermore, Ducrest et al. (2008) report associations between eumelanin pigmentation and \nregulation of feed intake in vertebrates in general. It appears that darker eumelanic individuals \nhave higher resting metabolic rate, yielding increased feed intake to maintain energy \nhomeostasis. At the same time stress has an appetite inhibiting effect (Bernier and Peter \n2001), and when feeding behaviour is resumed after a stressful experience (such as \nintroduction to a novel environment), this might reflect a downregulation of the physiological \nstress response, including the melanocortins. A high feed intake in a novel environment may \ntherefore to some extent indicate quick acclimatization to the new environment, however it \nshould be noted that this test is easily influenced by individual differences in previous growth \nrate (Ruiz-Gomez et al. 2008). Taken together these two aspects probably explain the higher \nfeed intake in the spotted group. In the current experiment, the difference in feeding \nbehaviour between spotted and non-spotted salmon was most evident after approximately one \nweek of rearing in isolation but not immediately after transfer. As seen in Fig 4, it would \nappear that spotted and non-spotted fish showed a rather similar initial response to isolation, \nbut after a few days spotted fish had a higher feed intake.  \nFrom these data it is not possible to conclude whether feed intake had reached a \nplateau in the non-spotted group, or would have continued to increase to eventually equal that \nof spotted fish. Further tests are therefore required to determine whether different feeding \nbehaviour reflects a permanent difference in the behavioural strategy and possibly also resting \n13 \n \nmetabolism of spotted vs. non-spotted Atlantic salmon. There was no initial size difference in \nfish sampled from group rearing. The most likely explanation for the difference in feed intake \nis that spotted and non-spotted fish reacted differently to novelty and social isolation, and that \ndifferent feed intake in this case reflects a behavioural and\/or metabolic component of \ncontrasting stress coping styles akin to those seen in mammals (Koolhaas et al. 1999).  \nIn summary, our results indicate that the association between melanin-based colouration and \nstress coping style is generally present in salmonid fish, and is not merely an artefact of the \nHR-LR selection regime. This observation is consistent with findings reviewed by Ducrest et \nal. (2008). These authors report co-variation between melanin-based colouration and other \nphenotypic traits. For example in white-throated sparrow, males of two different colour \nmorphs (white and tan) showed different stress responses. White-morph males had a longer \nand more pronounced secretion of corticosterone in response to handling than tan-morph \nmales (Schwabl 1995).  \nEumelanin pigmentation may be linked to social status, for example in passerine birds \n(J\u00e4rvi and Bakken 1984), thus it is important to control for immediate effects of social \ninteractions on glucocorticoid production. We attempted to exclude the social factor by \nstudying isolated fish.  Our results support the idea that differing dynamics of the stress \nresponse may be a consistent and partly inherited trait. Other studies have indicated that this \ntrait may be a cause, as much as a consequence, of social status (Pottinger and Pickering, \n2001; \u00d8verli et al. 2004; Summers et al. 2005).  Salmonid fish can exhibit physiological \ncolour change during stress; subordinate individuals e.g. often become darker. This is \nhowever not due to increased number of spots but rather a darkening of the entire dorsal body \nsurface (see for example H\u00f6glund et al. 2000). Whether stress, e.g. caused by social \nsubordination, in other cases also can alter eumelanic spots are a topic for future experiments. \n14 \n \nA possibly important aspect which remains unresolved is whether melanin-based skin-\nspots in teleost fish serve a signalling function targeted by sexual selection. Colour pigments \nare used in the animal kingdom to advertise quality and attract mates. A recent study shows \nthat embryo viability in the brown trout was revealed by the sires\u2019 dark pigmentation with \ndarker males siring more viable offspring (Wedekind et al. 2008). In the barn owl males are \non average 1.9 times less spotted and female spottiness is considered to be a criterion in mate \nchoice (Roulin 1999). For example; the extent to which female barn owls display black \neumelanin spots signal offspring parasite resistance and developmental homoeostasis (Roulin \net al. 2003). Furthermore, the degree of eumelanism in the barn owl has been linked to the \nability to cope with different environments and thus stressful factors (Roulin et al. 2008; \nAlmasi et al. 2008). Determination of gender was not done in the present study.  Possible \ngender differences and a signalling function of melanin-based skin-spots in salmonid fish \nshould be investigated. \n Melanin-based colouration is also involved in ornamentation, camouflage and \nprotection against physical damage, infectious agents, UV-light, and toxicants (Cesarini 1996; \nMajerus 1998; Mackintosh 2001; Roulin 2004a; Hoekstra 2006). The proximate and ultimate \ncauses for the association between eumelanin-based ornamentation and other fitness-related \ntraits such as immunocompetence remains debated (see e.g. Roulin 2004b; Griffith et al. \n2006). The fact that glucocorticoid suppression of immune function has been observed \nthroughout various vertebrate taxa (McEwen et al. 1997; Weyts et al. 1999) provide a likely \nproximate link between eumelanin colouration and disease resistance which so far has \nreceived little attention. On an applied level, there are some potentially important implications \nof this trait correlation in fishes. For instance, concerns are frequently raised about the impact \nof salmon rearing on wild fish populations and the surrounding ecosystems. The ectoparasitic \ncopepods commonly referred to as salmon lice (or sea lice) have been identified as an \n15 \n \nimmediate aquaculture-related threat to wild stocks (Krko\u0161ek et al. 2007). It is therefore of \ninterest to investigate whether increased melanism in salmon is associated with reduced \nectoparasite prevalence and fecundity, as has already been reported in birds (Roulin et al. \n2003, 2001). Identification and concomitant selection for more stress-resistant individuals in \naquaculture could also potentially alleviate other critical industry issues related to disease, \nwelfare and sustainability of feed resources (Fevolden, 1992; Huntingford et al., 2006; Small \net al., 2008). For instance, one study reported reduced feed waste from LR as compared to HR \nrainbow trout rearing units, along with improved feed conversion ratios in LR fish (\u00d8verli et \nal. 2006b). There is however some concern that selection for fast growth and low stress-\nresponsiveness may result in bolder individuals with more aggressive behavioural traits \n(Huntingford and Adams, 2005). Ducrest et al. 2008 reports that in 18 out of 20 species darker \neumelanic individuals are more aggressive. Agonistic interactions between farmed fish are \nundesirable. In addition these individuals are prone to display more risk-taking behaviour \nmaking them more susceptible to predators (Huntingford and Adams 2005). \n A more fundamental aspect of our results is that dermal eumelanin pigment patterns \nprovide a novel and convenient way to identify stress-sensitive and stress-resistant \nindividuals. Correlated behavioural and physiological traits are thought to reflect adaptation to \ndifferent population densities, the relative frequency of occurrence of similarly or differently \nbehaving individuals, and\/or other fluctuating aspects of the environment, including stability \nand predictability of environmental change (Koolhaas et al. 1999; Dingemanse et al. 2004; \nH\u00f6jesj\u00f6 et al. 2004; Wolf et al. 2008). One important consequence of eumelanin pigment as a \nvisual marker of stress coping style is that it may ease the work of understanding the \nevolution of correlated traits by providing a convenient and reliable identification of the \noccurrence of different phenotypes in different environments. \n16 \n \nThe suggested proximate explanations for covariance between melanin-based \ncolouration and other phenotypic traits such as behaviour and HPA\/HPI reactivity are \npleiotropic effects of melanocortins and their receptors (MCRs) (Ducrest et al. 2008).  In \nparticular the MC1R (regulating synthesis of the dark pigment eumelanin) and MC2R \n(controlling corticosteroid production) might play important roles. These receptors share a \nsubstantial amount of homology, but have no physical linkage in the genome of any vertebrate \nspecies examined so far (Logan et al. 2003; Schi\u00f6th et al. 2003). Thus, the causal mechanisms \nfor correlated activity between the MCR receptors remain unknown. It appears that melanin-\nbased pigment patterns and stress-coping style are linked by largely unmapped, evolutionary \nprocesses. Hopefully, a combination of molecular genetics studies and experiments \naddressing the specific gene-environment interactions which maintain, or disrupt, the \ncorrelation between pigment patterns, stress-coping style, and other phenotypic traits will \nprovide more knowledge in this area. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Guro Sandvik for practical assistance during the salmon experiment. \nProfessors Dag Inge V\u00e5ge and Stig William Omholt are thanked for valuable comments and \ndiscussions during the preparation of this manuscript.
