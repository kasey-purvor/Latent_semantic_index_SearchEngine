A new approach to the problem of direction\nand distance finding of magnetospheric ULF oscilla-\ntions is described. It is based on additional information\nabout the structure of geoelectromagnetic field at the\nEarth\u2019s surface which is contained in the known\nrelations of the theory of magnetovariation and\nmagnetotelluric sounding. This allows us to widen the\nrange of diagnostic tools by using observations of\nAlfve\u00b4n oscillations in the Pc 3\u20135 frequency band and the\nion-cyclotron waves in the Pc 1 frequency band.\nPreliminary results of the remote sensing of the\nmagnetosphere at low-latitudes using the MHD ranger\ntechnique are presented. The prospects for remote\nsensing of the plasmapause position are discussed.\n1 Introduction\nThe study is devoted to the problem of direction and\nrange finding of the ULF geoelectromagnetic oscilla-\ntions. Our approach to this problem is influenced by the\npaper of Hayakawa (1991) dedicated to the direction\nfinding of VLF\/ELF emissions (see also Hayakawa et al.,\n1991). We describe the operation of the ULF finder as a\ndevice which makes it possible to complete the range\nfinding of Pc 3\u20135 oscillations (2\u2013100 mHz) and the\ndirection finding of Pc 1 waves (0.2\u20135 Hz). The range\nfinder consists of a magnetometer and the recording\nsystem for measuring the Earth\u2019s currents, i.e. the\nnormal set of standard observatory equipment. More-\nover, we consider a large volume of the Earth\u2019s crust in\nthe vicinity of the observation point as an essential\nelement of the device. The dimensions of the volume are\nassumed to be of the order of the skin depth. The\nelectrodynamic characteristics of the new element are\ntaken into account when measurements and calculations\nare being carried out.\nFigure 1 depicts a small part of the Earth\u2019s surface in\nthe neighborhood of the observatory. Here the x axis is\ndirected northward, the y axis points eastward and the\nhorizontal line stands for the projection of a magnetic\nshell on the Earth\u2019s surface. We consider that this shell\nundergoes resonant Alfve\u00b4n oscillations and our purpose\nis to locate this shell. We present our method which\nallows us to solve this problem by observations at one\nsingle point. In other words, we suggest an algorithm for\nmeasurements and calculations to determine the dis-\ntance xR up to the projection of the oscillating magnetic\nshell on the ground.\nThe ULF finder is also available for the Pc 1 wave\npropagation, i.e., for the measurement of the angle u\n(see Fig. 1). We start with this problem as it is easier in\nsome respects than the range finding of Pc 3\u20135\noscillations. Although we cannot show any relevant Pc\n1 data to verify the method at the moment, we introduce\nthe basic elements of the direction finding method for\nthe sake of completeness.\n2 Direction finding of Pc 1 pulsations\nIt is customary to assume that Pc 1 are generated in the\nmagnetosphere as ion-cyclotron waves, which propagate\nto the ionosphere in a longitudinal wave guide. Here a\nportion of wave energy is incident in the ionospheric\nwave guide and propagates horizontally along the\nEarth\u2019s surface at large distances from the end of the\nlongitudinal wave guide (Manchester, 1966, 1968;\nTepley and Landsho\u0080, 1966; Greifinger and Greifinger,\n1968, 1973). Measurement at one observation point thus\ntells us nothing about the location of this end. The\nproblem has been solved by several methods such as\ntriangulation direction of arrival (Frazer and Wawrzy-\nniak, 1978), directional analysis (Chetaev, 1978),\ndispersion and group delay (see Feygin et al. 1979 and\nreferences therein) and by using the measurements fromCorrespondence to: J. Kangas\nAnn. Geophysicae 15, 424\u2013429 (1997) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 1997\na dense network of magnetometers (Hayashi et al., 1982,\n1988). In addition to these methods we present here an\nindependent technique for the measurement of azimuth\nu of the Pc 1 propagation (see Fig. 1). The position of\nthe Pc 1 source region may be established by the\ndirection finding of Pc 1 at two or more points.\nLet us locate the observation point in the center of a\nregion with a relatively homogeneous distribution of\nconductivity of the rocks in horizontal directions. We\nshall register three components of the magnetic field b\u0085t\u0086\nin the Pc 1 frequency band. The data analysis is based\non the following graphic construction.\nWe can determine the plane perpendicular to b\u0085t\u0086.\nThis plane intersects the horizontal plane (or Earth) in a\nstraight line. The line rotates because the Pc 1 exhibits\nelliptic or, more precisely, quasi-elliptic polarization.\nThe rotating line is coincident with the direction of Pc 1\npropagation twice over the period of oscillations, much\nas a stopped clock shows the right time twice a day. This\nleads to the question: when does this coincidence take\nplace? The answer runs as follows: the rotating line\ncoincides with the propagation direction when bz\u0085t\u0086 \u0088 0.\nLet us put this in another way. Figure 2 shows the\nhodograph of the vector-function bs\u0085t\u0086, where index s\nindicates that we are dealing with the horizontal vector\nprojection. The moments at which bz\u0085t\u0086 \u0088 0 are indi-\ncated by the bold dots on the hodograph. Let us draw a\nline which connects these two points. Then the\nperpendicular to this line defines the direction of Pc 1\npropagation.\nIn order to prove this conclusion we make use of the\nrelation\nbz \u0088 ik1rs \u0001 bs ; \u00851\u0086\nwhere 1 stands for the surface impedance of the Earth,\nk \u0088 c=x; c is the velocity of light, x is the frequency of\noscillations and bs \u0088 \u0085bx; by\u0086. This relation is widely used\nin the study of the Earth\u2019s crust and upper mantle by\nmeans of magnetovariation sounding (Berdichevsky\net al., 1969; Schmueker, 1970; Lilley and Sloane, 1976;\nJones, 1980; Pajunpa\u00a8a\u00a8, 1988).\nSetting bz \u0088 0, we obtain rs \u0001 bs \u0088 0. The operator\nrs may be replaced with iks, where ks \u0088 \u0085kx; ky\u0086 is the\nlocal wave vector of horizontal propagation. Hence\nbs \u0001 ks \u0088 0, i.e., vector bs is parallel with respect to the\nwave front, and it is perpendicular to the direction of\npropagation when bz \u0088 0.\nThe information on the surface impedance is not\nnecessary when the assumption of horizontal homo-\ngeneity and isotropy of the Earth\u2019s crust in the vicinity\nof observation point is fulfilled. If it is necessary, we can\ntake into account a weak dependence of 1 on x; y. All\none has to do is to replace bz by bz \u00ff ikbs \u0001 r1. This\nreplacement follows from the evident generalization of\nEq. (1) to the case of slightly inhomogeneous media:\nbz \u0088 ikrs\u00851bs\u0086. The realization of this version requires\npreliminary investigation of the geoelectric structure of\nthe region in the vicinity of the observation point to\ncalculate rf. In this case the information on geoelectric\nproperties of the rocks is used here in the explicit\nform.\nAssuming the medium to be horizontally homoge-\nneous, but anisotropic we can use the procedure\ndescribed, replacing bs by the auxiliary vector\nbi \u0088 bj1kk1\u00ff1ji ;\nwhere 1ij stands for the surface impedance tensor and\nthe indices i; j; k take the values x; y. Here we consider\nthat 1ij \u0088 1ji.\nFig. 1. The location of the ULF finder (point at the origin of the\ncoordinates) relative to the projection of the oscillating magnetic shell\nonto the ground (horizontal line). The inclined line indicates the\ndirection of wave propagation in the ionospheric wave guide\nFig. 2.

Guglielmi et al.: Range finding of Alfve\u00b4n oscillations and direction finding of ion-cyclotron waves 425\n3 MHD ranger\nWe measure the east-west component of the electric field\nEy and the vertical component of the magnetic field bz in\nthe Pc 3\u20135 frequency range. Let us make use of spectral\nanalysis and designate E \u0088j Ey\u0085x\u0086 j; Z \u0088j bz\u0085x\u0086 j. We\nmay find the distance from the observation point to the\nmagnetic shell, resonating at the frequency x, from the\nexpression\nxR\u0085x\u0086 \u0088 k\u0085E=Z\u0086 sin h ; \u00852\u0086\nif the electroconductivity of rocks has horizontal\nhomogeneous distribution (Guglielmi, 1989). Here\nh\u0085x\u0086 is the phase di\u0080erence between the spectral\ncomponents Ey\u0085x\u0086 and bz\u0085x\u0086. In the case of inhomoge-\nneous distribution it is necessary to replace bz by\nbz \u00ff ikbs \u0001 r1 as before.\nEquation (2) was derived with the help of Eq. (1) and\nthe impedance boundary condition\nEs \u0088 1bs \u0002 n ; \u00853\u0086\nwhere n denotes the unit vector normal to the Earth\u2019s\nsurface directed earthwards (e.g., Wait, 1982), with\nregard to the approximate expression\nbx\u0085x\u0086 \u0088 bx\u0085xR\u0086\u00891\u00ff i\u0085x\u00ff xR\u0086D\u00ff1\u008a\u00ff1 \u00854\u0086\nfor the known spatial structure of the field-line\nresonance (e.g., Hasegawa and Chen, 1974; Southwood,\n1974; Orr and Hanson, 1981; Gough and Orr, 1984).\nHere D is the width of a resonance.\nLet us draw an analogy between the range finding of\nfield-line resonances based on Eq. (3) and magnetotel-\nluric sounding (MTS). It is well known that the essence\nof MTS lies in the estimation of the vertical distribution\nof the crustal conductivity by the frequency dependence\nof the modulus of surface impedance (e.g., Rokityansky,\n1982; Wait, 1982). The modulus of the surface im-\npedance can be calculated from the Cagniard relation:\nj 1 j\u0088 E=H : \u00855\u0086\nHere H \u0088 j bx j, see Eq. (3). Clearly MTS is based on the\nidea of compensation: since Ey and bx are proportional\nto the intensity of external sources, their ratio \u0085Ey=bx\u0086\ndoes not depend on this intensity and moreover it is\nproportional to f. (We recall that Ey is proportional to f,\nand bx mostly does not depend on f.) In other words,\nMTS is related to the compensation of the indefinite\nconditions in the upper half-space. Similar to MTS,\nrange finding in the form of Eq. (2) is achieved owing to\na specific compensation: as both components Ey and bz\nare proportional to f, their ratio \u0085Ey=bz\u0086 does not\ndepend on f. In other words, our method is directed to\nthe compensation of indefinite conditions in the lower\nhalf-space.\n4 Verification\nAs a test of the techniques described the data generously\nsupplied by Prof. D. Chetaev has been analyzed in order\nto calculate xR. Pc 3 pulsations have been observed in\nUkraine not far from the village of Rakhny Sobovy,\n\/0 \u0088 43:9\u000e. Altogether 21 events suitable for analysis\nwere registered on August 30, 1974 between 09.30\u201312.30\nLT. Each event represents a wave packet with a carrier\nfrequency f \u0088 x=2p and a smoothly varying amplitude\nenvelope. In addition to the distance xR also the\nimpedance j f j has been calculated for selected events.\nThe dependence of xR on f is shown in Fig. 3. We can\nsee that the connection between xR and f is obvious. The\ncorrelation coe\u0081cient r \u0088 \u00ff0:89 has the expected sign\n(the period T \u0088 1=f increases with increasing latitude).\nThe regression equation is\nxR \u0088 3:76\u0002 103 \u00ff 82:7f ; \u00856\u0086\nwhere xR is measured in km and f in mHz, respectively.\nAt the same time the connection between j f j and f\nturned out to be rather weak (see Fig. 4). The\ncorrelation coe\u0081cient r \u0088 0:24. This indicates that, at\nleast in the case under study, the method of the\nmagnetospheric MHD-range finding is more informa-\ntive than that of magnetotelluric sounding.\nThe result obtained may be verified, for instance, by\nan observation in two points displaced in latitude. As\nsuch data is not available, we carried out indirect\nverification by means of analysis of pulsation polariza-\ntion in the horizontal plane. Figure 5 displays the\nrelative distributions of number of cases versus xR for L\nand R polarizations separately. One can see that L\npolarization is preferable if xR > 0 and vice versa as\nwould be expected, in the framework of the theory of\nfield-line resonances (e.g., Lanzerotti, 1976).\nWith a knowledge of xR and the position of the\ndevice, it is possible to determine the magnetic shell L\nvalue. Also, knowing L and the frequency of resonant\noscillations, we can use the familiar method of hydro-\nmagnetic diagnostics (HMD) for the estimation of\nplasma density q in the equatorial plane of the\nFig. 3. Range finding at the latitude 43:9\u000e on August 30, 1974\n426 A. Guglielmi et al.: Range finding of Alfve\u00b4n oscillations and direction finding of ion-cyclotron waves\nmagnetosphere (e.g., Aubry, 1970; Jacobs, 1970; Orr,\n1973; Orr and Matthew, 1971; Nishida, 1978). Accord-\ning to Eq. (6) d lg q=dL \u2019 \u00ff0:9 at L \u2019 2, which is not in\ncontradiction with direct and indirect measurements\n(e.g., Carpenter and Anderson, 1992).\n5 Discussion\nWe now discuss mainly two questions, one related to\nMTS and the other concerns HMD, and in one way or\nanother both of these questions are related to the\nproblem of ULF finding. We point out also some\nlimitations in using the direction finding method.\nIn order to understand the reason why the impedance\n1 is almost independent of the frequency f (Fig. 4), let us\nconsider the relation\nEy \u0088 \u00ff1 bx \u0087 id\n2\n4\n@2bx\n@x2\n\u0012 \u0013\n; \u00857\u0086\nwhich is more general than the Cagniard relation Eq. (5).\nHere d \u0088 \u0081\u0081\u00812p j 1 j k is the e\u0080ective skin depth (e.g. Wait,\n1982).\nThe strong inequality\nd2\n4\n@2bx\n@x2\n\f\f\f\f \f\f\f\f\u001cj bx j \u00858\u0086\nis usually valid, and that is why the second term on the\nright hand side of Eq. (7) may be omitted. Such a\nrejection leads to the violation of the correlation\nbetween 1 and f . Let us consider the question in a\ngreater detail.\nAs we may write\n@2bx\n@x2\n\u0088 2bx\u0085D\u0087 ixR\u00862\n;\nit follows from Eqs. (1) and (4) that \u0085D\u0087 ixR\u0086 \u0088\n\u00ffk1bx=bz at x \u0088 0. Based on these relations we conclude\nthat the rejection of the second term in the right hand\nside of Eq. (7) leads to an error of the order of\n\u0018 \u0085Z=H\u00862. The analysis of data indicates that the\nrandom variation of value \u0085Z=H\u00862. The analysis of data\nindicates that the random variation of value \u0085Z=H\u00862 is of\nthe order of 5\u201310%.\nOn the other hand, the relative variation of frequency\nis of the order of 10% (see Fig. 3). It is known that 1\ndepends on frequency such as\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\nf\np\nin the high frequency\nlimit, and 1 is almost independent on f in the low\nfrequency limit. Hence, the regular variation of j 1 j in\nour case is not greater than 5%, i.e., it is less than a\nrandom variation. Therefore, the poor correlation\nbetween j 1 j and f is the result of neglecting the second\nterm on the right hand side of Eq. (7).\nA more detailed analysis of the data available for the\npresent study reinforces our conclusion. It has been\nfound that the correlation coe\u0081cient r tends to increase\nwith the increase of distance j xR j. For example,\nr \u0088 0:41 if j xR j > 100 km (14 events), and r \u0088 0:07 if\nj xR j< 200 km (14 events). The reason is that the greater\nj xR j, the smaller the second term in the right hand side\nof Eq. (7).\nWe now turn our attention to the discussion of the\napplication of ULF range finding to HMD. We see great\npossibilities for the development of hydromagnetic\ndiagnostics with the help of the MHD-ranger. The idea\nis as follows. If the range-finder is placed in the band of\nlatitude 50\u00ff 60\u000e it may be possible to detect the plas-\nmapause position L by recording Pc 3, 4 pulsations. It is\nanticipated that a display of xR against f will reveal the\nlocation of the plasmapause by a distinct discontinuity.\nThere are two weak points which have to be\nrecognized when applying the direction finding method\nFig. 4. Magnetotelluric sounding at the same latitude on the same\ndate\nFig. 5. Distribution of the polarization of pulsations with latitude\nA. Guglielmi et al.: Range finding of Alfve\u00b4n oscillations and direction finding of ion-cyclotron waves 427\ndeveloped in Sect. 2. Although Hayashi et al. (1982)\nfound that the radius of the ionospheric secondary\nsource of Pc 1 pulsations does not exceed 300 km it is\nobvious that the Pc 1 source region is often more\nextended in the E-W direction. On the other hand,\naccording to the theoretical calculations (Greifinger and\nGreifinger, 1973; Fujita, 1987) the propagation of Pc 1\nwaves is limited mostly along the magnetic meridian\nplane i.e., at small values of u. Although this may not be\nthe general case according to our experience (see also\ne.g., Fraser, 1975) it is probable that the method to\nlocate the Pc 1 source by the direction finding method\ndoes not work in all cases. However, it is expected that\nthe method always produces useful information about\nthe fluctuations of the local direction of the Pc 1\npropagation.\nConclusion\nThe basic idea of the present study is that the impedance\nrelationships between the components of electromag-\nnetic field on the Earth\u2019s surface can be used in\nhydromagnetic diagnostics. Two simple methods based\non the impedance relation (1) have been introduced.\nThis is not, however, an exact formula. We have avoided\ndiscussion of the applicability conditions but even so it is\nclear that the depth of field penetration into the crust\nmust be small as compared with the vacuum wavelength,\nthe radius of curvature of the surface and the\ncharacteristic scales of the changes in the field and\nmedium properties along the surface of the Earth. Any\ncomplete answer to the question of applicability\ncondition is di\u0081cult to present. The relationship (1)\ndepends strongly on the geoelectric conditions in the\nvicinity of the point of observation. There is always the\nrisk that one or another applicability condition will be\nviolated or, alternatively, that some condition will turn\nout to be too rigid.\nIs it possible to suggest an alternative approach\nwhich would retain the idea in general terms but which\nwould not be based directly on Eq. (1)? We believe that\nthe answer is positive. For this purpose we need to study\nthe conductivity distribution in the lower half-space near\nthe observation point by MTS methods and then jointly\nsolve the internal problem (for the Earth\u2019s crust) and the\nexternal problem (for the magnetosphere). The solutions\nare to meet at the interface. Then, it becomes possible to\nuse additional relationships between the field compo-\nnents in order to improve the accuracy of magneto-\nspheric diagnostics.\nAcknowledgments.
