Here examples include work with lone mothers, hospice settings and work\nwith the homeless. Issues include the relations between the setting, the wider agency and the\ndegree to which biographical work hinders or supports a marginal grouping and assessment\nof need. Finally, \u2018Biographical resources in education and training\u2019 \u2013 \u2018explores biography as a\nquality resource in the education and professional practice of teachers, social researchers and\ndoctors\u2019. Included here is work from France, which examines the interrelation between private\nlife and the professional practice of teaching and research on the \u2018emotional life\u2019 of doctors in\ntheir stressful daily work London\u2019s East End.\nThe editors have performed a major task drawing together such a rich range of\nbiographically informed research on a variety of professional contexts across differing national\ncontexts. The comparative analysis could have been developed somewhat in relating the main\nthemes and the individual contributions, perhaps in the Introduction where in fact the UK\nand Germany are contrasted or as short additional introductions to sections. In turn this\ncould have strengthened the conception of professional practice being offered and how a\nbiographical approach can contribute to professional practice and social policy. However, the\nvolume succeeds well in establishing the relevance of biographical research for social policy\nin relation to professional practice and its a broad comparative intent should be commended.\nIt is also very useful companion to P.

These two quite different, but\nequally important, books are a direct product of that process. One is a research report. The\nother is an edited collection.\nTinker and Coomber\u2019s report relates to a questionnaire and telephone interview study\nfunded by the Nuffield Foundation into the functioning of University Research Ethics\nCommittees in the UK. The findings would indicate that four in five of the universities\nresponding had established a Research Ethics Committee, though nearly half had done so\nonly since 2000. Practice varied considerably between institutions. It appeared that scrutiny\ndid not extend to all the research being conducted within or by the universities. Two thirds of\nthe institutions made no special arrangements for the social sciences. The authors select ten\nreviews 495\ncriteria by which to assess the level of scrutiny of research, including:\n\u0001 Whether scrutiny is centralised or devolved.\n\u0001 Whether scrutiny extends both to staff and to student research.\n\u0001 The inclusiveness of the membership of the committees (and, in particular, whether they\nhave lay members).\n\u0001 Whether the committee has a dedicated administrator, and the standard and extent of the\ndocumentation, codes of practice, etc. published by the committee.\nWhile they refrain from presenting a league table that names and shames under-performing\ninstitutions, the authors explain how they scored the universities for which sufficient data were\navailable against these ten criteria. One in ten scored 10 out of 10, and six in ten scored 8 or\nbetter. However, one in ten scored 4 or less and two institutions scored 0 out of 10. As the report\nacknowledges, this is not a wholly satisfactory way to assess the effectiveness of ethical scrutiny,\nbut the results are none the less telling and should rightly attract a great deal of attention from\nacross the academic research and university administration communities.\nThe critical question that is raised in a foreword to Tinker and Coomber\u2019s report by\nSharon Witherspoon, Deputy Director of The Nuffield Foundation, is whether the increased\nattention that is now being given to research ethics scrutiny is \u2018simply moral panic or a\nbureaucratic imperative?\u2019 (p. 6). Does the research ethics debate reflect a set of concerns about\nthe dangers posed in particular by social scientific research, or a commitment to better regulation\nand procedural safeguards? The contributors to Smyth and Williamson\u2019s edited collection on\nresearch ethics touch upon this same question in a variety of different ways, though not always\nexplicitly.\nSmyth and Williamson\u2019s collection contains 11 substantive chapters contributed by a total\nof no fewer that 26 different authors (including the editors). The book was inspired by the\nseminar on \u2018Ethics and Research Guidelines\u2019, organised in February 2002 by the Academy of\nLearned Societies for the Social Sciences. The collection is arranged in three parts. The first is\nconcerned with \u2018Participation and inclusion\u2019, and includes accounts of research conducted on\nresearch participants as well as examples of participatory research initiatives. The second part\nof the book is concerned directly with \u2018The review and governance process\u2019 and demonstrates,\ninter alia, how the established research ethics scrutiny process that applies within the UK\u2019s\nNational Health Service (namely, its own Local Research Ethics Committees) can fulfil a gate-\nkeeping function that does not protect the interests of service users so much as prevent critical\nscrutiny by social researchers of the practices of service professionals. The third part of the book\nis concerned with \u2018Researchers\u2019 relationships with participants\u2019 and contains several powerful\naccounts of the ways in which social researchers and even journalists can \u2013 on a principled\nbasis \u2013 give voice to vulnerable service users and marginalised or oppressed social groups. The\neditors provide an introduction and conclusion in which they attempt valiantly to establish\nthe themes that bind this extremely diverse collection together. Several of the more stimulating\nindividual contributions, however, stand on their own and clearly deserve to be included as\nsuch on the reading lists for research methods courses, particularly at postgraduate level.\nReading these two books has encouraged me once again to reflect upon the ethics of\nSocial Policy research in particular. I am reminded of two kinds of danger. First, in Social\nPolicy we should understand better than most that the proliferation of protocols relating to\nsuch matters as informed consent and confidentiality can drive researchers \u2013 just as much\nas service providers \u2013 into defensive modes of practice and a culture of risk management or\ncounterproductive blame avoidance (e.g. Hood et al., 2000). The underlying principle that\nhas informed medical and social research ethics is the Kantian imperative that human beings\nare to be treated as ends in themselves and never as means to an end. Research that involves\n496 reviews\nhuman \u2018subjects\u2019 or participants should do them no harm. There is a danger, however, that\nthe procedural injunction that a researcher must do no harm might become so restrictively\ninterpreted and applied as to inhibit researchers from exploring ways of achieving substantive\nbenefits for people.\nSecond, there is conversely a danger that Social Policy research can become a business for\n\u2018voyeurs, narks and do-gooders\u2019 (see Mann, 1996). This is why it is so important that research\nthat relates to the users of human services and to the needs of vulnerable or disadvantaged\npeople should seek to engage its human \u2018subjects\u2019 as participants in the research process. It\nshould aim not merely to spare them from harm, but to empower them as the creators of\nknowledge. However, giving them a say, for example, in how research is to be conducted is not\neasy. There is a fine line to be drawn between, on the one hand, an inclusive approach that\nensures that the people involved in research are regarded not as means but as ends and, on the\nother, a process that shifts responsibility from the researcher to the researched. The danger at\none extreme is that participants are subject to a benign form of manipulative co-option; at the\nother that extraneous demands may be allowed to displace or undermine the integrity of the\nresearcher\u2019s scholarly judgement.\nIn all the discussion of research ethics there really is very little attention given to what\nwe understand by ethics \u2013 as opposed, for example, to morality. A customary code or moral\nconsensus, whether it is promoted by a professional or academic body or espoused by a service\nusers\u2019 or community group, is not the same as an ethical paradigm. Perceptions of what is or\nwhat ought to be good for (other) people do not necessarily coincide with what is right . Ethics\nafter all relate primarily to purposes, not processes, and the purpose of research is to contribute\nto knowledge. Social Policy research, I would contend, requires an ethical commitment to\nknowledge that promotes human well-being. Research processes and protocols must serve and\nshould be commensurate with that ethic: but they cannot of themselves define it. We may\npossibly infer the ethic that informs research from the processes and protocols with which it\ncomplies, but such compliance does not necessarily make research ethical. This may be stating\nthe obvious, but amidst the administrative turmoil that attends the rolling out of University\nResearch Ethics Committees, and in the light of the increasingly challenging and intellectually\nabsorbing debates about the propriety of different research methods, I thought it worth re-\niterating.\nReferences\nHood, C., Rothstein, H. and Baldwin, R.
