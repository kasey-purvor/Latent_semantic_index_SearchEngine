Res., 115, A03304, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014832.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The determination of ionospheric plasma convection\nmaps is a key target for ionosphere\u2010magnetosphere physics,\nsince the convection and the electric field associated with\nit are crucial parameters for the determination of, e.g., iono-\nspheric currents, field\u2010aligned currents, and the energy\ndeposition in the ionosphere. Presently, coherent scatter ra-\ndars such as STARE [Greenwald et al., 1978] or the Super-\nDARN radar network [Greenwald et al., 1995; Chisham et\nal., 2007] are the only instruments able to determine such\nmaps over a mesoscale region (of a few hundreds to\nthousands of kilometers) with a time resolution suitable to\nstudy single events (20 s for STARE, 1 min routinely with\nSuperDARN). In the future, with the advantages of modern\nelectronic beam steering, SuperDARN can achieve higher\ntime resolution. With the same technique, also the up-\ncoming AMISR [e.g., Heinselman and Nicolls, 2008] and\nthe EISCAT 3\u2010D [Wannberg, 2008] incoherent scatter\nradars may be used for similar purposes. However, due to\nthe much larger energy per volume required by incoherent\nscatter techniques, the results will be restricted to smaller\nareas or have less time resolution.\n[3] The nature of coherent backscatter is spatially and\ntemporally highly variable. That is, for each measured time\nstep, only a certain percentage of the data points that would\nbe observed in an optimal case are actually available. Fur-\nthermore, like with any radar, the coherent scatter radar\nonly measures the component of the plasma convection\nvelocity along the radar beam, called line\u2010of\u2010sight (LOS)\nvelocity. In order to obtain a spatial map of the full con-\nvection vectors, therefore the available LOS velocities from\ntwo or more radars must be merged into a 2\u2010D plasma\n1Arctic Research Unit, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki,\nFinland.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA014832$09.00\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A03304, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014832, 2010\nA03304 1 of 7\nconvection velocity vector field. In most cases, also in the\npresent paper, it is assumed that inductive effects can be\nneglected, and consequently the resulting 2\u2010D velocity\nvector field is divergence\u2010free.\n[4] Plasma convection maps over the whole northern\nauroral zone are a standard output produced by the data of the\nSuperDARN coherent scatter radar network [Ruohoniemi\nand Baker, 1998]. However, in order to overcome data\ngaps either due to areas where none of the radars has a field\nof view, or due to lack of data because of missing back-\nscatter, the technique to produce these maps (called \u201cAPL\nmodel\u201d here) uses statistical \u201ca priori\u201d information taken\nfrom plasma convection models that are driven by para-\nmeters of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the\nsolar wind. Further, the APL model is built on spherical\nharmonics, which means that missing information on one\npart of the analysis area will have an effect on all other parts\nof that area. For these two reasons, even in regions where\ngood radar backscatter is available, it is not granted that the\noutcome of the APL model reflects the actual radar data in\nthat region well. Particularly, there is a risk that smaller\u2010\nscale variations and anything in the data that is incompatible\nwith the used statistical \u201ca priori model\u201d will be suppressed\nin the plasma convection maps produced by the APL model.\n[5] In this paper, we present a new technique for merging\nplasma flow velocity vectors from LOS data locally in areas\nwhere sufficient backscatter from two or more coherent\nscatter radars is available, without the use of any \u201ca priori\u201d\nmodels. The new technique is based on Spherical Elemen-\ntary Current Systems (SECS) which were introduced by\nAmm [1997], and since then have been used successfully in\nnumerous tasks for ionosphere\u2010magnetosphere physics, e.g.,\nthe determination of ionospheric equivalent currents from\nground magnetometer data [Amm and Viljanen, 1999], the\ndetermination of induction effects in the ionosphere\n[Vanham\u00e4ki et al., 2006], or establishing a local version of\nthe well known KRM technique [Kamide et al., 1981] that\nderives ionospheric electric fields and currents from ground\nmagnetometer data, as shown by Vanham\u00e4ki and Amm\n[2007]. (Note that the notion \u201ccurrent systems\u201d exists for\nhistorical reasons, but in fact the SECS can be used as basis\nfunctions for any kind of continuously differentiable vector\nfield on a sphere.) The analysis region, i.e., the region with\nsufficient backscatter, may have any shape. The SECS basis\nfunctions are local, and thus no upper or lower wavelength\nthat can be represented in the output results needs to be\nselected globally. In addition, no fixed boundary conditions\nneed to be specified. The output plasma flow velocity vec-\ntors resulting from the technique are by definition exactly\ndivergence\u2010free.\n[6] In section 2, we present the analytical basis of the new\ntechnique. In section 3, we test the technique using a syn-\nthetic data set, and by subsequently reducing the amount of\navailable input data, we investigate how much backscatter is\nsufficient for the technique to operate with reasonable error\nmargins. Finally, section 4 contains an application of the\ntechnique for a real SuperDARN data case. We compare the\noutput of our new technique with that of the APL model on\nthe same area, with the same input data.\n[7] It should be noted that although the new technique is\npresented here in terms of merging LOS radar data to\nplasma convection velocity vectors, it is not restricted to this\nspecific application. The mathematics presented in the fol-\nlowing section can be applied to any type of vector com-\nponent data on a sphere, and their merging into a vector\nfield.\n2. Technique\n[8] In this section, we describe the analytical basis of the\nnew technique, based on the SECS approach. For detailed\ndescription of the SECS approach itself, see Amm [1997] or\nAmm and Viljanen [1999].\n[9] Figure 1 sketches the geometry of the input data,\nwhich consist of n vector components Vi in directions ei, i =\n1,\u2026, n, given at positions ~ri on a spherical area F. In our\nradar data application, the unit vectors ei refer to the LOS\ndirections of the radar beams. The area F is the analysis area,\nin which the method provides the searched output of the\ntechnique, namely the vector field ~V on F such that divh~V =\n0. Here and in the following, the subscript \u201ch\u201d denotes the\nhorizontal component of a vector or operator. For simplicity,\nin the sketch a rectangular area was chosen for F, but the\nshape of the analysis area can freely be chosen to best match\nthe area of available input data.\n[10] The way to solve for ~V with the SECS approach is to\nplace m divergence\u2010free spherical elementary system poles\nto an area F* with F \u0001 F*, and then fit the scaling factors\nIj,df, j = 1,\u2026, m of these poles such that the field given by\nthe sum of all SECS optimally fits the measured vector\ncomponents. The elementary systems are placed with their\npoles on positions~r \u2032j on F*. Typically, the positions~r \u2032j are\nchosen as a regular grid, but the density of the elementary\nsystems placed can also be adopted to reflect areas of denser\nor sparser input data availability if so desired.\n[11] The first step of the solution is to solve for the scaling\nfactors of the divergence\u2010free elementary systems. For that,\nwe solve the linear equation\nT \u0003 I \u00bc Z \u00f01\u00de\nFigure 1.

Equation (5) can be applied for any\ndesired~r0 \u0001 F, and thus the searched vector field V can be\nconstructed.\n3. Test With Synthetic Data Sets\n[13] In this section, we test the performance of the new\ntechnique using a synthetic input data set of plasma flow\nvelocity, as shown in Figure 2. In fact, this input data set\nhas been constructed from SuperDARN measurements on\n13 November 1996, 1900 UT, and it has been analyzed\ntogether with magnetometer data in the work of Amm et al.\n[1999]. However, in the context of this technique paper, we\ndisregard the geophysical aspects and use the vector field\nshown in Figure 2 as a synthetic representation of a true\nplasma flow velocity distribution at some given time only.\n[14] In order to test how well the new technique can\nreproduce the given synthetic input data set, and in order to\ntest its sensitivity with respect to the availability of (or lack\nof) backscatter (and thus of input vector component data),\nwe have performed the following virtual experiment: We\ndefine two \u201cvirtual radars,\u201d one of which measures only the\nnorth component, and the other only the east component of\nthe original plasma flow velocity. (We are aware of the fact\nthat in the real world, such a configuration would not be\npossible since lines of constant latitude are not straight on a\nsphere, but this is of no concern for this mathematical test.)\nThe range gates of the \u201cvirtual radars\u201d correspond just to the\nintervals between the vectors shown in Figure 2, i.e., if\noptimal backscatter would be received, the radar data would\nconsist exactly of the north and east components of the\nvectors shown in Figure 2. Next, we define six probability\nlevels (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, and 5%) which define\nthe probability for each vector component of the vectors\nshown in Figure 2 to be actually observed by the virtual\nradar. When generating virtual input data for each of the\nprobability levels, a random process with the respective\nprobability is used to determine for each vector component\nwhether or not it is observed. Each probability level thus\ncorresponds to different amounts of backscatter (on average,\nthe percentage of backscatter received equals the probability\nlevel) and therefore of input data for the technique.\n[15] With the available input vector component data at\neach probability level, we then use the new SECS\u2010based\nlocal merging technique presented in section 2 to reconstruct\nthe divergence\u2010free plasma flow velocity field. The relative\nerror between the recalculated field (denoted by the sub-\nFigure 2. Synthetic model of a plasma flow velocity vector\nfield, used to generate input data for testing the new tech-\nnique with different backscatter probability levels.\nAMM ET AL.: TECHNIQUES A03304A03304\n3 of 7\nscript \u201ccalc\u201d) and the original field, i.e., the vectors shown in\nFigure 2 (denoted by the subscript \u201corig\u201d), is defined as\n\u00bc\nZ\nF\nj~vcalc \u0004~vorigj\nZ\nF\nj~vorigj\n\u00f06\u00de\n[16] Figure 3 shows the output of the reconstruction with\nthe new technique for the probability levels 25%, 10%, and\n5% (Figures 3a, 3b, and 3d, respectively). The reconstructed\nfield is displayed by black vectors, and the original model\nfield is displayed by green vectors, for comparison. The\nreason why we do not show the corresponding output for\nprobability levels higher than 25% is clear from Figure 3a:\nEven at the 25% probability level, visually it is hard to\nobserve any difference between the reconstructed and the\noriginal vector fields. However, the relative error , given in\nTable 1, rises from 0.45% at 100% probability level to 4.41%\nat 25% probability level. The reason for \u2260 0 at 100%\nprobability level is, in addition to numerical effects relating\nto the inversion, the fact that the amount of elementary\nsystem poles that we use for the SECS expansion is finite. At\n10% probability level (Figure 3b), deviations between the\nreconstructed and the original vector fields start to become\nvisual, particularly in the western part of the analysis area.\nStill, also at this low probability level, the structure of the\noriginal field is fully reconstructed, and the deviations are\nmoderate with a relative error of = 12.26%. Figure 3c shows\nthe vector component input data for this level, demonstrating\nthe sparseness of the input data with which the technique still\nobtains a very reasonable reconstruction result. Finally, at 5%\nprobability level, the reconstructed vector field has clearly\ndeteriorated (Figure 3d), and the relative error rises to =\n49.45%. However, even at this very low probability level, the\nresult is not random but the basic features of the original\nvector field, i.e., the change in vorticity from northwest to\nsoutheast, the vortex at the southern flank, and the general\ndecrease of the field\u2019s magnitude from west to east, are still\nrecognizable.\n4. Test With a Real SuperDARN LOS Data Set\nand Local Comparison With APL Model Results\n[17] The second test of our technique is based on real\nSuperDARNLOS plasma velocity data, measured on 5 January\nFigure 3.

In addition to the testing of the technique\nwith real data, we locally also compare the results with those\nof the APL model, based on the same input data. We con-\ncentrate here on the field of view of the two CUTLASS\nradars which are part of the SuperDARN network and sit-\nuated in Hankasalmi (Finland) and Pykkvibaer (Iceland).\nThe location of the radars, their fields of view, and the\nobserved LOS velocities are shown in Figure 4a. In the color\nscale, negative values and red\/orange color denote LOS\nvelocity components away from the radar, while positive\nvalues and blue\/green colors denote LOS velocity compo-\nnents toward the radar. The data are presented in altitude\nadjusted corrected geomagnetic coordinates (AACGM [e.g.,\nGustafsson et al., 1992]). The interval presented is charac-\nterized by a very good level of available backscatter overall\nin the SuperDARN radars, and thus also for the CUTLASS\nradars. Still, some regions where no backscatter is received\nexist especially at the flanks of the field of view in the far\nrange gates in the Pykkvibaer radar (Figure 4a, left), and at\nsome medium distance and far range gates in the Hanka-\nsalmi radar (Figure 4a, right). Again, we do not discuss any\ngeophysical aspects of the data set in this technique paper,\nbut merely use it as an input to our technique.\n[18] Figure 4b shows the output of the APL model on the\nnorthern auroral zone. In Figure 4b, magnetic noon is on the\ntop, and magnetic midnight is on the bottom. For better\norientation, also the two CUTLASS radars and their field of\nview are indicated, where \u201cE\u201d denotes to Pykkvibaer radar,\nand \u201cF\u201d denotes the Hankasalmi radar.

(c) Local comparison of results for the plasma flow velocity in the area of the CUTLASS\nradars\u2019 field of view: (top) APL model and (bottom) new SECS\u2010based radar merging technique.\nAMM ET AL.: TECHNIQUES A03304A03304\n5 of 7\nvectors indicate positions where at least one of the Super-\nDARN radar obtained ionospheric backscatter. However,\nthe direction of the vectors at these positions always point\nalong the APL model solution for the plasma flow velocity\n(not along the original LOS measurement direction). In\naddition, also isocontours of the electric potential that de-\nscribes the electric field ~E = \u2212~V \u00d7 ~B resulting from the APL\nmodel of ~V (where ~B denotes the Earth\u2019s main magnetic\nfield) are plotted. As can be seen from Figure 4b, on the\nmagnetic evening (i.e., on the plot at left) side of the auroral\nzone, the radars generally obtain a good amount of back-\nscatter, while on most of the magnetic morning (i.e., on the\nplot at right) side, backscatter is sparse or fully absent. In\nthese regions, the APL model output is dominated by the \u201ca\npriori\u201d information given to the model, which are based on\nparameters of the IMF also stated in Figure 4b. However, we\nemphasize that the nature of spherical harmonic basis\nfunctions, on which the APL model is built, is such that\nthere cannot be a clear separation into areas that are influ-\nenced by the \u201ca priori\u201d information and others that would\nnot be influenced by them. Moreover, the sparse data\navailability in some areas globally limits the maximum\npossible degree of the spherical harmonic expansion, and by\nthat its spatial resolution.\n[19] In Figure 4c, we directly compare the output of the\nAPL model and that of our new SECS\u2010based merging\ntechnique, in the area of the CUTLASS radar field of view.\nLooking only at the most basic features of the plasma flow\nvelocity pattern, there is good correspondence between the\nresults of the two techniques: Mostly westward flow is seen\nin the southern part of the analysis area equatorward of\n73\u00b0 lat, while poleward of that the plasma flow splits into a\nclockwise vortical structure on the western side, and an\nanticlockwise vortical structure on the eastern side. How-\never, when looking more closely, it becomes clear that the\nresult of the new SECS\u2010based technique preserves much\nmore of the mesoscale detailed structures that are contained\nin the measured LOS velocity data (Figure 4a), and it also\npreserves a much larger variability of the amplitude of the\nplasma flow velocity, again in accordance with the original\nLOS data. For example, the intensification of the eastward\nflow in the northeastern edge of the analysis area and the\nstrong zonal shear flow equatorward of it, as they are clearly\nseen in the LOS data of the Pykkvibaer radar, are both well\nrepresented in the results of the new SECS\u2010based technique,\nbut hardly visible in the results of the APL model.\n5. Summary and Discussion\n[20] In this paper, we have devised a new technique based\non SECS for merging vector component data on a sphere\ninto a vector field, and presented it for the specific case of\ncoherent scatter radar LOS data of the ionospheric plasma\nflow velocity. Most importantly, unlike the traditional APL\nmodel that is regularly used with SuperDARN data on the\nwhole northern auroral zone, the new technique does not\nrequire any \u201ca priori\u201d modeling nor other specific assump-\ntions such as boundary conditions for the scalar potential\nthat describes the plasma flow velocity vector field. On the\nother hand, the new technique must only be applied on\nareas where sufficient backscatter from two or more radars\nis present. These areas may have any shape, and are not\nrestricted to, e.g., spherical caps, as is the case for techniques\nbased on local spherical harmonics such as spherical cap\nharmonic analysis (SCHA [Haines, 1985]). Some inherent\nproblems of SCHA related to the boundary conditions\nassumed in their construction were pointed out by Th\u00e9bault\net al. [2006].\n[21] We have tested the new technique for one synthetic\nmodel case and for one real data case. The test with the\nsynthetic model showed that the technique is able to pro-\nduce excellent reconstructions of the original vector field\nwith relative errors less than \u223c5% when more than \u223c25 % of\nthe original input vector component data are available as\nbackscatter measurements. Even if only \u223c10 % of the\noriginal input vector component data are available, the\nreconstruction is still fairly good with a relative error of\n\u223c12%, and all structural features of the vector field being\nfully contained in the reconstruction. This is particularly\nreconfirming for the performance of our new technique\nbecause the synthetic model shown in Figure 2 is not an\neasy case for a local reconstruction, since it contains opposite\nvorticities, a wide dynamic range of vector magnitudes, and\na vortex that is cut at the equatorward boundary of the\nanalysis area. The above stated numbers of available back-\nscatter can be used as guidelines for what amount of input\ndata is sufficient for the application of the technique, with\nrespect to the scale on which the results for the velocity\nvector field are desired to be obtained. (In our example, this\nscale is \u223c100 km.)\n[22] The test of our new SECS\u2010based merging technique\nwith real SuperDARN LOS data, and the local comparison\nwith the output of the APL model, showed that while the\nmost essential features of the plasma flow velocity vector\nfield agree, the results of the new technique contain much\nmore mesoscale features of the vector field, and variability\nof its magnitude. Those features, which are clearly present\nin the input LOS data, are largely suppressed in the APL\nmodel results, presumably due to the global spherical har-\nmonic basis functions used, and due to the influence of the\n\u201ca priori\u201d modeling. Therefore, in situations when meso-\nscale details of the radar data are of importance, or when the\nradar data is to be combined with other mesoscale data sets,\nin regions where sufficient backscatter exists it is recom-\nmendable to analyze the radar data with the SECS\u2010based\ntechnique presented in this paper.\n[23] For the present paper, we have restricted our dis-\ncussion to the application of the new technique with a\nplasma flow velocity field that is desired to be divergence\u2010\nfree. Therefore, only divergence\u2010free elementary system\nterms appear in equations (3)\u2013(5). If for some other appli-\ncation, the output field is desired to be curl\u2010free, then only\ncurl\u2010free elementary system terms would need to be used\ninstead. If the output field should be of general kind, the\nmatrix T and the vector of scaling factors I need to be\nextended to contain both curl\u2010free and divergence\u2010free ele-\nmentary system terms, and equation (5) would then contain\nthe sum of both of these terms.\n[24] Acknowledgments.
