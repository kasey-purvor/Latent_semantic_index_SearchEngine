Phys. D: Appl. Phys.\n2 Monitoring of CNT network\n1. Introduction\nRecent advances in carbon nanotube (CNT) filled polymer nanocomposites have\nhighlighted the potential of these materials, especially with respect to their electrical\nproperties [1\u00153]. The formation of percolating networks of high aspect-ratio\nnanoparticles allows for the development of relatively high conductivities at low\nconcentrations of carbon nanotubes [4, 5]. A central issue arising when attempting to\nrelate the processing of nanocomposites with the final properties is that of particle\ndispersion. A variety of dispersion methodologies have been proposed and tested\nincluding ultrasonication [6], shear mixing [7, 8], triple roll milling [9] and twin screw\nextrusion [10]. It is generally believed that a `good' state of dispersion results in\nadvantageous properties [2]. Some counter-intuitive results such as the occurrence\nof percolation at loadings significantly lower than expected [7, 11, 12] or an increase\nin electrical conductivities observed after the end of dispersion processing [10, 13]\npoint to the existence of re-aggregation phenomena that influence the formation of\na network of carbon nanotubes.\nDielectric monitoring has been used extensively in the context of thermosetting\npolymer cure [14\u001516]. The dielectric response of thermosets is affected by phenomena\nrelated to dipolar relaxation and charge migration [17], which are both sensitive to\nthe state of the material. Typically the frequency of dipolar relaxation decreases\ndramatically during the progress of cure as a result of the process of vitrification,\nwhilst the conductivity due to the movement of mobile charge carriers decreases. The\nsensitivity of the migrating charge response to the progress of cure forms the basis of\nquantitative use of dielectric signals. This is carried out in impedance terms via the\nuse of the maximum of imaginary impedance, which is found to correlate strongly\nwith the progress of cure [18, 19]. The simplification and robustness offered by this\nform of analysis has now led to the adoption of impedance spectroscopy, coupled with\nequivalent circuit modelling, in the on-line monitoring of thermoset cure. A further\ndevelopment of this approach, utilised in the present study, was originally developed\nin solid state physics and electrochemistry [20]; it uses an electrical circuit comprising\na set of resistors and capacitors that represent dipolar relaxation, charge migration\nand electrode polarisation [15] to simulate the impedance response of the curing\nmaterial. Non-linear fitting of the equivalent circuit response to the experimental\ndata obtained during the cure makes it possible to estimate the circuit element values\nand their evolution as a function of the progress of the reaction [21]. One limitation\nMonitoring of CNT network 3\nof using equivalent circuits is the non-uniqueness of the model; the material response\ncan be represented by a variety of combinations of electrical components, all equally\nfitting the dielectric spectra of the material. The final choice of circuit is usually\nbased on the phenomenological description of the processes involved [22].\nRecent work in the authors' group examined the dielectric response of\nepoxy\/CNT nanocomposites during cure and has shown that, when the addition\nof nanoparticles induces a conductive response, impedance generally increases as\ncross-linking advances [23]. As in the case of neat thermosets, this behaviour can\nbe attributed to mobility limitations imposed on the charge carriers by the progress\nof cure [18]. However, in cases where an epoxy matrix has been reinforced with\nSWNT, the frequency corresponding to the conductive mechanism of the system\nincreases with the progress of cure [24]. This type of behaviour, which has also\nbeen observed in thermoplastics filled with nanotubes when melts are allowed to\nrecover from a shear deformation, has been attributed to re-aggregation of carbon\nnanotubes [10, 13]. The work reported here focuses on the phenomenon of network\nformation via re-aggregation in unsaturated polyester\/carbon nanotube composites\nand its influence on the impedance response of the curing material.\n2. Materials and experimental methods\nThe resin used was an isophthalic unsaturated polyester (UPE) in a typical\nformulation that contains inhibitors, and it is cured by the addition of radicalic\ninitiator and a catalyst. This material cross-links by addition polymerisation between\npolyester chains and the vinyl group of styrene, which in this study was carried\nout at 40\u00b0C for 10 hours. Nanocyl\u00ae7000 multiwalled carbon nanotubes were\nused in this study. These are nominally 1.5 micrometres long and entangled in\nrope-like aggregates (figure 1(a-b)), with carbon purity of approximately 90% [25].\nThe nanocomposites prepared contains between 0.05 and 0.15% by weight of filler\ndispersed by a combination of shear mixing and horn sonication. Details of the\npreparation procedure are given in a previous publication [26].\nCure kinetics information was gathered using a heat flux differential scanning\ncalorimeter (DSC-TA Instruments 2920). Isothermal cure of the resin was carried\nout at 40\u00b0C using sample weights below 10 mg. The total heat of reaction was\ndetermined from a full cure of the material at 120\u00b0C.\nImpedance measurements under thermal profile conditions identical to those\n4 Monitoring of CNT network\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 1: As-received Nanocyl\u00ae7000: (a, b) SEM micrograph (c) TEM micrograph\nused in the calorimetry tests were performed using a Solartron SI 1260 frequency\nresponse analyzer. The instrument communicated with a computer via an IEEE-\nUSB interface. The commercial dielectric sensors used (GIA sensors, Pearson Panke),\ncomprise an assembly of interdigitated copper electrodes, printed with a spacing of\n200 mm on a thin polymeric film. The sensor was immersed in a glass tube containing\nthe liquid resin and the glass tube was placed in a hollow copper cylinder, surrounded\nby heating elements controlled by a Eurotherm 2408 temperature controller. A\ncontrol thermocouple (Type K) was placed in an opening on the wall of the hollow\ncylinder. A second thermocouple was placed in the glass tube in order to record the\nactual thermal profile followed by the resin. The measurements were performed in\nthe frequency range between 10 Hz and 1 MHz for the unfilled resin and between\n100 Hz and 1 MHz for the nanocomposite. Five frequencies per decade were swept\non a logarithmic scale.\nThe morphology of the nanocomposite at low magnifications was investigated by\noptical transmission microscopy. Specimens of uncured composite were prepared by\nplacing the liquid material between a glass slide and a cover slip and applying pressure\nto reach a thickness of 50\u00b110 mm. Slices of cured material with a similar thickness\nwere cut using a Buehler Isomet precision sectioning saw with a diamond wafering\nblade. Characterisation of the solid composite morphology at high magnifications\nwas performed on a thin layer of the resin-nanotube dispersion cured on an aluminium\nstub using a SFEG-SEM (XL-30 Philips\/FEI). The analysis was carried out under\nconditions that induce electron charging of the conductive filler on and to some extent\nbelow the surface; this technique is suitable for visualising the network of nanotubes\nMonitoring of CNT network 5\nembedded in an insulating matrix [27, 28].\n3.

The cure kinetics behaviour is characteristic of a radical-\ninitiated addition polymerisation. The rate is negligible up to about 15 min at the\ncure temperature. This corresponds to the time during which radicals produced are\nconsumed by the inhibitor (stage I in the graph). The reaction speed is maximised\nat about 50 min (stage II). After that the reaction slows down significantly and\nthe degree of cure levels off after 150 min (stage III). The maximum degree of cure\nreached is 93%, as a consequence of diffusion limitations imposed on the cure reaction\nafter vitrification.\n6 Monitoring of CNT network\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n101 102 103 104 105 106\nZ\u2019\n\u2019 [\n\u2126]\nFrequency [Hz]\n0 min\n10 min\n30 min\n40 min\n60 min\n180 min\n(a)\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n102 103 104 105 106\nZ\u2019\n\u2019 [\n\u2126]\nFrequency [Hz]\n0 min\n10 min\n30 min\n60 min\n90 min\n180 min\n(b)\nFigure 3: Evolution of imaginary impedance spectrum during the cure: (a) neat\nUPE (b) 0.10 wt% CNT\/UPE composite.\nThe results of impedance spectroscopy for the neat resin are illustrated in\nfigure 3(a). The imaginary impedance spectrum is characteristic of the existence\nof a mechanism of charge migration which is manifested as a peak at intermediate\nfrequencies [17, 18]. A dipolar relaxation mechanism, which is often manifested as\na secondary peak or knee at higher frequencies [18], is also present but cannot be\ndiscerned clearly in a logarithm plot. The peak of imaginary impedance starts from\na position of approximately 500 Hz and a level of about 5 MW at the beginning\nof cure. With the progress of cure the imaginary maximum increases and shifts to\nlower frequencies, e.g. its value is about 50 MW and its position 20 Hz after 40 min.\nAfter some 60 min the peak moves outside the experimental window of observation.\nThis behaviour is typical of curing thermosets and is attributed to the mobility\nlimitations imposed on charge carriers as the viscosity of the material increases with\ncross-linking.\nThe evolution of the imaginary impedance spectrum of the nanocomposite\nduring the cure is illustrated in figure 3(b). The behaviour observed is noticeably\ndifferent from that of the neat polyester. The initial imaginary impedance spectrum\nhas a peak which is significantly broader than that observed in the neat resin. The\npeak value decreases by more than one order of magnitude with the addition of\nnanotubes, as a result of the high conductivity of the filler. Furthermore, the\nevolution with time is distinctly different in the nanocomposite. The spectrum\nMonitoring of CNT network 7\nmoves towards lower impedance, while the broad peak resolves into two separate\npeaks. The frequencies of the peaks tend to increase as the cure progresses. Thus,\nthe low frequency peak moves from an initial position of about 2 kHz and a level\nof approximately 100 kW to a frequency of 10 kHz and a level of 10 kW, whilst the\nhigh frequency peak shifts from about 10 kHz and 100 kW to 500 kHz and 5 kW after\n90 min. This behaviour is indicative of the existence of two mechanisms which are\nrelated to the behaviour of the nanoparticles rather than that of the matrix.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 4: Micrograph of 0.10 wt% CNT\/UPE composite. Optical transmission\nmicroscopy of (a) liquid uncured material; (b) fully cured material. (c) Charge\ncontrast imaging SEM of fully cured nanocomposite.\nFigures 4(a-b) show the microstructure of the nanocomposite before and after\ncure, respectively. Prior to cure a slight degree of re-aggregation can be observed.\nThis differs from undispersed primary aggregates, which appear as small dark areas\nwith a size of about 2 to 10 mm. Some areas are more optically transparent, but the\nlimits of nanotube-rich regions are not well defined. The microstructure of the cured\nnanocomposite differs significantly, comprising two different types of regions: (i) low\ntransmission areas, which are in the range of 10-100 mm, are rich in nanotubes and\ncover about 50-70% of the surface; (ii) areas of relatively low nanotube content with\nhigh optical transmission. It can be inferred that during the process of cure some\nprocess of re-aggregation of initially well dispersed carbon nanotubes occurs. The\nexistence of loose aggregates of carbon nanotubes is evident in contrasting charge\nscanning electron micrographs of the cured composites, as shown in figure 4(c).\n8 Monitoring of CNT network\n4. Modelling of impedance response\nThe heterogeneous structure of the nanocomposite observed in microscopy comprises\nresin-rich regions that are expected to have properties closer to those of neat polyester\nand filler-rich regions with relatively higher conductivity. The impedance spectra of\nthe system with nanotubes show two mechanisms. These differ significantly from the\nsingle mechanism of the neat resin in terms of absolute value, characteristic frequency\nand evolution during the cure. The impedance response of the composite material is\ndominated by the behaviour of the conductive loose aggregates of nanotubes and the\nresin-rich areas acting as interfaces among them. The behaviour of the system can\nbe modelled by the simplest form of the `bricklayer' equivalent circuit used for the\nsimulation of the behaviour of polycrystalline ceramics [20, 29, 30]. The equivalent\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5: (a) Schematic of structure of aggregated nanotubes and associated\nbricklayer model (b) corresponding equivalent circuit.\ncircuit, illustrated in figure 5(b), comprises two parallel RC sub-circuits connected\nin series. In the context of the bricklayer model these are assumed to represent the\nMonitoring of CNT network 9\nbulk resistance and capacitance (b) and the behaviour of interfaces (i). The bulk\nsub-circuit is expected to result in a relatively higher characteristic frequency, with\ninterfaces occupying the low frequency part of the spectrum.\nThe impedance of the equivalent circuit is:\nZ\u2217(\u03c9) = Z\n\u2032\n(\u03c9)\u2212 jZ \u2032\u2032(\u03c9) (1)\nZ\n\u2032\n(\u03c9) =\nRb\n1 + (\u03c9CbRb)\n2 +\nRi\n1 + (\u03c9CiRi)\n2 (2)\nZ\n\u2032\u2032\n(\u03c9) =\n\u03c9CbR\n2\nb\n1 + (\u03c9CbRb)\n2 +\n\u03c9CiR\n2\ni\n1 + (\u03c9CiRi)\n2 (3)\nHere Z\u2217 denotes the complex impedance of the circuit, Z\n\u2032\nand Z\n\u2032\u2032\nare the real\nand imaginary part of impedance respectively. Cb and Rb denote the capacitance\nand resistance of the bulk material, Ci and Ri are the capacitance and resistance of\nthe interfaces, and \u03c9 is the angular frequency.\nThe four parameters of the equivalent circuit model are estimated for each set\nspectrum during the cure of the nanocomposite following the procedure described\nin [21]. The estimation is performed using a genetic algorithm which minimises the\nfollowing objective for each frequency sweep:\nS (Rb, Cb, Ri, Ci) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u2223\u2223Z (\u03c9i)\u2212 Z (\u03c9i)\u2223\u22232\u2223\u2223Z (\u03c9i)\u2223\u22232 , \u03c4b \u2264 \u03c4i (4)\nHere Z and Z denote the experimental and model impedance respectively, \u03c9i\nthe frequency of measurement i. An additional constraint is used to ensure that the\nobjective function is defined only when the characteristic time corresponding to the\nbulk sub-circuit (\u03c4b = RbCb) is less than the characteristic time of the interfaces sub-\ncircuit (\u03c4i = RiCi). The introduction of this constraint remedies problems related to\nthe non-uniqueness of solution caused by the use of two identical sub-circuits in the\nequivalent circuit model. Solutions that are significantly different (more than 20%\nin impedance terms) from the previous step are rejected. The estimation is then\nrepeated until a solution within the acceptable limits is found or for a maximum of\n50 repetitions. The assumptions underlying this treatment are that values of the\nparameters obtained in the previous sweep are good a priori estimates for the inverse\nsolution in the current step and that interfacial relaxation occurs at relatively low\nfrequencies. The parameters of the binary genetic algorithm used for the estimation\nare given in table 1.\n10 Monitoring of CNT network\nTable 1: Parameters of the genetic algorithm used for the estimation of equivalent\ncircuit parameters.\nBinary string length 164 digits\nNumber of individuals 199\nNumber of generations 100\nSelection operator roulette wheel\nMutation probability 0.05\n2\u00b7104\n4\u00b7104\n2\u00b7104 4\u00b7104 6\u00b7104 8\u00b7104 1\u00b7105\nZ\u2019\n\u2019 [\n\u2126]\nZ\u2019 [\u2126]\n105\n104 103\n102\nFigure 6: Equivalent circuit analysis of curing nanocomposite impedance response:\ncomparison of experimental and model response at 60 min in the cure in the form\nof complex impedance plane plots; \u25e6 represent the experimental data, solid line\nrepresents model results and \u2022 denote selected frequencies (given in Hz).\nFigure 6 illustrates a complex impedance plane plot obtained after about 60\nmin in the cure. The two semicircles in the experimental data point to the presence\nof the two mechanisms that are represented by the parallel RC sub-circuits of the\nmodel. It can be observed that the two experimental arcs are decentralised and\nslightly depressed. These are typical of non-Debye type behaviour with distributed\nrelaxation times usually observed in disordered materials and modelled using an\nequivalent circuit incorporating constant phase elements [20]. The model utilised in\nthis study is limited to an ideal RC behaviour to allow a more robust estimation\nof the evolution of parameters by minimising the number of parameters and their\ninterrelationships.\nThe results of parameter estimation are illustrated in figure 7. The evolution of\nthe conductive network can be separated in three different stages, corresponding to\nthe stages of reaction measured by DSC (figure 2). Stage I corresponds to the first\nMonitoring of CNT network 11\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n0 50 100 150 200\n10-13\n10-12\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\nR\n [\u2126\n]\nC \n[F]\nCure time [min]\nI II III\nCiCbRiRb\nFigure 7: Evolution of the four parameters of the equivalent circuit versus cure time.\nComposite containing 0.10 wt% of CNT.\n15 minutes of the experiment, during which the degree of conversion is negligible;\nthe interphase shows an increase of capacitance (Ci) and a drop of resistance (Ri),\nwhilst the capacitance of the bulk (Cb) remains approximately constant and the\ncorresponding resistance (Rb) decreases steadily. Stage II corresponds to the time\nbetween the onset of curing to approximately the point of maximum rate of reaction;\nthe capacitances Ci and Cb remain essentially constant, while the behaviour of the\ntwo resistances is remarkably different. The two resistances tend to level off at\nabout 35 minutes, at which point they separate: Ri increases and Rb drops sharply.\nReaction continues in stage III, reaching a steady state after about 150 minutes; Ci\ndecreases slightly and Cb remains constant; Ri and Rb decay, levelling off at similar\nfinal values.\nThe evolution of characteristic times for composites with different CNT loadings\nis shown in figure 8. The value of characteristic time at the end of cure is lower at\nhigher filler loading. The characteristic times of the interphase, shown in figure 8(a),\nstart at similar values and then separate during cure. The peak of conductivity\ndue to migrating charges mobility limitations, observed at about 50 minutes at 0.05\nwt%, moves to shorter time and lower intensity with increasing CNT loading. The\ncharacteristic times of the bulk phase at the three loadings studied (figure 8b) are\nwell separated from the beginning of cure.\n12 Monitoring of CNT network\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350C\nha\nra\nct\ner\nist\nic \ntim\ne \nin\nte\nrp\nha\nse\n [s\n]\nCure time [min]\n0.05%\n0.10%\n0.15%\n(a)\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\nCh\nar\nac\nte\nris\ntic\n ti\nm\ne \nbu\nlk \n[s]\nCure time [min]\n0.05%\n0.10%\n0.15%\n(b)\nFigure 8: Comparison of the evolution of characteristic times in CNT\/UPE\ncomposites at different loadings: (a) interphase between aggregates and (b) bulk\nof the aggregates.\n5. Discussion\nThe results of impedance measurements during the cure of neat polyester and\nnanocomposites indicate noticeably different behaviours. The neat resin has the\nresponse usually observed in curing thermosets, i.e. the existence of a conductive\nmechanism due to charge migration that is affected by the increasing viscosity of\nthe material as it cures. In contrast, the response of the nanocomposite is dictated\nby re-aggregation of nanotubes occurring after the end of the process of dispersion.\nSeveral models can be used to describe the AC response of a conductive\/insulating\nmatrix composite, such as the effective media Maxwell-Wagner equation, the two\nexponent phenomenological percolation equation and the bricklayer model [31\u0015\n34]. The bricklayer model with two RC sub-circuits in series, previously used for\npolycrystalline ceramics [29, 35], has been selected in this study for its ability to\nseparate bulk and interphase contributions and to monitor their changes during cure.\nThe choice is based on the heterogeneous morphology of the nanomaterial observed\nby microscopy. This morphology is represented schematically in figure 9.\nThe evolution of the parameters of the equivalent circuit model during the cure of\nthe nanocomposite is influenced by changes in both the geometry of the conductive\nnetwork and in the resin properties. The initial sharp increase of the interfacial\nMonitoring of CNT network 13\nFigure 9: Schematic of carbon nanotube network in insulating thermosetting resin\nduring and after secondary aggregation. Arrows indicate nanotube-rich areas (b)\nand resin-rich layers (i).\ncapacitance reflects the generation of interfaces during the formation of aggregates,\nwhich in turn become richer in filler, leading to lower resistance. When cure begins,\nthe increase of resin resistivity is manifested as a temporary increase in the resistance\nof the resin-rich component (Ri). However, the more evident effect of cure on the\nconductive network is a continuous drop of Rb as well as Ri during the progress of\nreaction, leading to final values of more than one order of magnitude lower than\nthose at the beginning of cure.\nThe values of resistance and capacitance of the equivalent circuit are influenced\nby geometrical factors as well as by material properties. Calculation of the\ncharacteristic time corresponding to each of the sub-circuits allows elimination of\nsome of the effects related to geometry. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the\ncharacteristic time of the two sub-circuits during the cure. The sequence of the three\nstages described previously is repeated for all loadings, although at the lower loading\nscatter is higher due to the low signal\/noise ratio caused by the low conductivity\nof the material. The characteristic time of interfaces (\u03c4i) is about one order of\nmagnitude higher than that of the bulk (\u03c4b) for all loadings. The characteristic time\nof the interface sub-circuit is almost constant during the first part of cure although\nboth the resistance and capacitance change significantly. This fact points to a pure\ngeometrical effect occurring in the first stages of cure, during which new interface\nis produced. Subsequently, the characteristic time increases slightly as a result of\nrising mobility limitations imposed by polymerisation of the thermosetting matrix.\n14 Monitoring of CNT network\nAfter this point, the characteristic times of both interfaces and bulk decay until the\nend of the cure, indicating a contribution from the reaction to the resistivity of both\nphases.\nThe characteristic times at the end of cure of both interphase and bulk decrease\nwith carbon nanotube content. This is in agreement with the expected increase\nof conductivity with filler loading, typical of percolating systems. The peak of\nconductivity due to migrating charges mobility limitations is less evident at higher\nloadings, as shown in figure 8(a). This is due to the faster drop of interphase\nresistance, which causes the shifting and hindering of the peak. The separation\nof characteristic times of the bulk phase at the three loadings (figure 8b) suggests\nthe existence of a different conductivity of the loose aggregates of carbon nanotubes.\nThe decay of characteristic time of both components suggests that reaction affects\nthe electrical properties of the composite, improving its conductivity. Although\nthis effect is observed on both the bulk of the CNT aggregates and the resin-rich\ninterphase, the latter is more significant at higher loading.\n6. Conclusions\nThe investigation of the dielectric behaviour during cure of unsaturated\npolyester\/carbon nanotube composites highlighted significant differences between\nthe response of nanocomposites and the thermosetting matrix. The imaginary\nimpedance spectrum of the nanocomposite shows two mechanisms, both moving\nto lower impedance and higher frequencies with the progress of cure. This behaviour\nis attributed to the re-aggregation of carbon nanotubes observed after the end of\ndispersion processing. This aggregation leads to an heterogeneous morphology of the\nnanocomposite, with nanotube rich regions of size in the range of 10-100 mm. The\nheterogeneous morphology can be modelled by an equivalent circuit comprising two\nparallel RC sub-circuits, one of them representing the nanotube rich regions and the\nsecond the interphase that surround them. Parameter estimation based on a genetic\nalgorithm was used to estimate the evolution of the parameters of the circuit during\nthe cure. This analysis was capable of evaluating the influence of material properties\nchanges as well as of geometrical characteristics of the morphology. The generation\nof interphase induced by re-aggregation affects both elements of the corresponding\nsub-circuit, whilst the drop in conductivity of the thermosetting matrix influences\nthe resistance of interfaces. The phenomenon of aggregation causes an increase in\nREFERENCES 15\nconductivity in the nanotube rich regions, which is reflected in a drop in the resistance\nof the bulk sub-circuit. The characteristic times of the two sub-circuits follow\nclosely the local material response rather than geometrical effects. The characteristic\ntime corresponding to the nanotube rich regions decreases continuously, whilst that\nof interphase is non-monotonous due to the interplay between the changes in the\nelectrical properties of the resin and the effect of cure on the carbon nanotubes. It\nfollows the behaviour of resin, with an increasing trend up to a point which reverses\nin the later stage of cure. At higher filler loadings the effect of the nanotubes is\ndominant and only a decay can be seen.\nThe information obtained using this type of analysis can form the basis for\non-line monitoring of dispersion\/re-aggregation in the context of nanocomposites\nprocessing. The phenomenological model reported in this study can facilitate the\nunderstanding of the changes of electrical characteristics of a nanocomposite during\ncure, which in turn determine its final electrical conductivity. The contributions of\nthe different components can be discerned, which can be a useful tool for control\nand optimisation of the cure of nanocomposites. Implementation in on-line process\nmonitoring, e.g., RTM or pultrusion, could be applied as quality control for the\nindustrial production of fibrous composites containing a nanocomposite matrix.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. S Dunn and Dr. D Gallardo for valuable\ndiscussions.
