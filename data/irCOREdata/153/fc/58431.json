We tested how activity density and species richness of carabid trophic groups responded to 5 \nlocal habitat and landscape structure (forest percentage cover and habitat richness) in 48 6 \nlandscape parcels (1 km2) across eight European countries. 7 \n3. Local habitat affected activity density, but not species richness, of both trophic groups. 8 \nActivity densities were greater in rotational cropping compared with other habitats; 9 \nphytophage densities were also greater in grassland than forest habitats.  10 \n4. Controlling for country and habitat effects we found general trophic group responses to 11 \nlandscape structure. Activity densities of phytophages were positively correlated, and 12 \nzoophages uncorrelated, with increasing habitat richness. This differential functional group 13 \nresponse to landscape structure was consistent across Europe, indicated by a lack of a country 14 \n\u00d7 habitat richness interaction. Species richness was unaffected by landscape structure. 15 \n5. Phytophage sensitivity to landscape structure may arise from relative dependency on seed 16 \nfrom ruderal plants. This trophic adaptation, rare in Carabidae, leads to lower phytophage 17 \nnumbers, increasing vulnerability to demographic and stochastic processes that the greater 18 \nabundance, species richness, and broader diet of the zoophage group may insure against. 19 \n 20 \nKeywords: ground beetle, predator, trophic rank, herbivore, granivore 21 \n 3\nIntroduction 22 \n 23 \nSpecies extinction, replacement, and the modification of assemblage trophic structure can 24 \narise from fragmentation of primary forest (Didham et al., 1998; Davies et al., 2000), habitat 25 \nconversion (Watt et al., 1997; Sala et al., 2000; Eggleton et al., 2002), and land-use 26 \nintensification (Lawton et al., 1998; Benton et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2003). In Europe, as 27 \nelsewhere, this suite of anthropogenic pressures has produced heterogeneous landscapes 28 \nranging from homogenous and intensively used monocultures to heterogeneous, low intensity 29 \nland-use mosaics.  30 \n 31 \nSuch variation in landscape structure will affect biodiversity as a function of taxon-specific 32 \nresponses to different facets of this environmental heterogeneity (e.g. habitat area or diversity) 33 \nat different spatial scales (e.g. habitat to landscapes). For instance, many populations persist 34 \nin complex landscapes containing perennial habitat refuges and are prone to extinction in 35 \nstructurally simple landscapes arising from habitat loss or degradation (Davies & Margules, 36 \n1998; Gonzalez et al., 1998; Hanski, 1998; Lindenmayer et al., 2002; Tews et al., 2004; 37 \nDriscoll & Weir, 2005). Many examples show that a variety of insect taxa such as bees, 38 \nparasitoids, beetles, and soil invertebrates are affected by environmental heterogeneity from 39 \nmicrohabitat to landscape scales (Steffan-Dewenter et al., 2002; de la Pena et al., 2003; Thies 40 \net al., 2003; Eggleton et al., 2005; Vanbergen et al., 2007). Often the diversity of a given 41 \ntaxon is influenced by heterogeneity at more than one spatial scale; hence it is desirable to 42 \nexplicitly account for variation attributable to different habitats when assessing the impact of 43 \nlandscape structure on invertebrate diversity (Chust et al., 2003; Jeanneret et al., 2003; 44 \nKruess, 2003; Schweiger et al., 2005; Hendrickx et al., 2007).  45 \n 46 \n 4\nMoreover, different species within a taxon often respond differently to landscape structure 47 \n(Steffan-Dewenter et al., 2002; Purtauf et al., 2005). An explanation is that ecological or 48 \nfunctional traits predict the species sensitivity to landscape structure because, like most 49 \nenvironmental pressures, it affects ecological assemblages in a non-random manner. One 50 \nimportant trend is that the likelihood of extinction or demographic change tends to scale with 51 \ntrophic level, which itself co-varies with other species traits such as increased body size, 52 \nhome range area, and vulnerability to disturbance (Holt et al., 1999; Raffaelli, 2004). 53 \nPredators, therefore, tend to be larger bodied, and more sensitive to habitat fragmentation 54 \nbecause they require greater home ranges to meet their energetic needs (Holt et al., 1999; 55 \nDuffy, 2003; Raffaelli, 2004; Borrvall & Ebenman, 2006; McCann, 2007). This means that 56 \nenvironmental change is likely to lead to the extinction or reduced abundance of predators 57 \nbefore species within lower trophic levels, such as phytophages. It is therefore likely that 58 \nhuman alteration of landscape structure will differentially influence insect diversity according 59 \nto trophic position (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000; Thies et al., 2003). It should be noted, 60 \nhowever, that there are examples where trophic level does not affect extinction probability, 61 \nthe responses were idiosyncratic across trophic groups, or lower trophic levels precede losses 62 \nat higher trophic levels (Henle et al., 2004).  63 \n 64 \nWhat is needed are studies that use ecological or functional trait approaches to better 65 \nunderstand the response of insect diversity to spatial heterogeneity at both habitat and 66 \nlandscape scales (Henle et al., 2004). The advantage of a functional trait (e.g. trophic group) 67 \napproach is that it provides a direct link to mechanistic processes (e.g. herbivory or 68 \npredation), hence changes in functional group diversity in response to environmental 69 \nheterogeneity are of fundamental and applied interest. Furthermore, a functional approach 70 \nenables the comparison of insect diversity responses to landscape structure across large 71 \n 5\ngeographic areas. Such trans-regional studies are rare (Sousa et al., 2006; Hendrickx et al., 72 \n2007; Billeter et al., 2008) because interpretation is complicated where major differences 73 \nexist in climate, historical origins of landscapes, and local species pools. This use of 74 \nfunctional, instead of taxonomic, groups resolves the problem of regional variation in species 75 \npools enabling generalisations to be made about invertebrate responses to landscape structure 76 \nacross geographic regions (Davies et al., 2003; Schweiger et al., 2005).  77 \n 78 \nThis paper describes the pan-European diversity responses of carabid (Coleoptera, Carabidae) 79 \nbeetle trophic groups to habitat type and landscape structure. Carabidae are widely-distributed 80 \nand abundant (Thiele, 1977) and are functionally diverse (Ribera et al., 2001; Cole et al., 81 \n2002) containing both predatory and phytophagous genera (Lang et al., 1999; Symondson et 82 \nal., 2002; Honek et al., 2003). The phytophagous genera generally being dependent on seeds 83 \nfrom plants (grasses, umbellifers, and crucifers) associated with grassland and agricultural 84 \nhabitats (Thiele, 1977; Stace, 1997). Carabid trophic groups are known to respond differently 85 \nto landscape structure and intensification in agricultural landscapes (Purtauf et al., 2005; 86 \nSchweiger et al., 2005). These earlier studies showed that both landscape structure and 87 \nintensification influenced the trophic structure of carabid assemblages (Schweiger et al., 88 \n2005); and that decreasing cover of perennial habitat affected carabid functional group 89 \nrichness negatively (Purtauf et al., 2005). These studies were, however, restricted to a single 90 \ncountry (Purtauf et al., 2005) or agricultural mosaics across a number of countries (Schweiger 91 \net al., 2005). The novelty of this paper is that it assesses the general responses of carabid 92 \ntrophic group diversity to structure of forested and agricultural landscapes (n = 48) across 93 \neight European countries. 94 \n 95 \n 6\nWe hypothesised that the response of carabid beetle activity densities, an abundance measure, 96 \nand species richness to habitat type and landscape structure - percentage cover of forest and 97 \nhabitat richness - differed between trophic groups (zoophagous and phytophagous species). 98 \nWe predicted, firstly, that zoophages would be more sensitive to landscape structure than 99 \nphytophages as a consequence of trophic position. Secondly, we predicted that phytophage 100 \nactivity-densities and species richness would be greater in open habitats where dietary 101 \nresources (grassland seeds) are readily available. 102 \n 103 \nMethods 104 \n 105 \nLandscape study sites  106 \n 107 \nForty-eight landscape parcels (Appendix S1: Fig. S2) were selected comprising six 1 km2 108 \nlandscape units (LU) sited in each of eight European countries (Finland, France, Hungary, 109 \nIreland, Portugal, Scotland, Spain and Switzerland). These LUs were selected according to 110 \npre-defined guidelines aimed at ensuring there was variation in landscape structure within and 111 \nbetween countries. These guidelines related to the predominating habitat within each 112 \nlandscape unit: LU1 - old-growth forest (100%), LU2 - managed forest (100%), LU3 - forest-113 \ndominated mosaic (> 50% forest, remainder being open, pastoral or agricultural habitats), 114 \nLU4 - mixed-use mosaic (approximately 50% forest and 50% open, pastoral or agricultural 115 \nhabitats); LU5 - grassland dominated (>50%), LU6 - dominated by arable agriculture (>50%). 116 \nThe actual proportions of forest and open habitats in the LUs (Appendix S1: Fig. S1) were 117 \nquantified from satellite images using GIS and were used in the calculation of landscape 118 \nstructure (see below).  119 \n 7\n 120 \nCarabid sampling 121 \n 122 \nCarabid beetles at each LU were sampled using a systematic grid of 16 sampling plots spaced 123 \n200m apart (Appendix S1: Fig. S2), giving a total of 96 sampling plots per country. At each 124 \nof the 16 sampling plots in the 48 LUs, carabid beetles were collected using four pitfall traps 125 \n(8 cm in diameter, 10.5 cm in depth) placed 5 m apart in a regular 2 \u00d7 2 grid. To kill and 126 \npreserve beetles the traps were half filled with a 50% solution of either propylene or ethylene 127 \nglycol with water (the choice of which was consistent within a country). A plastic or stone 128 \nroof was placed a few centimetres above each trap to prevent flooding and disturbance from 129 \nmammals. The traps were emptied at 2 week intervals for a period of 10 weeks in 2001 from 130 \nthe following dates: Finland May 15; France June 19; Hungary April 18; Ireland June 6; 131 \nPortugal April 30; Scotland May 4; Spain May 10; and Switzerland May 16. These sampling 132 \nperiods reflected regional periods of peak activity. In 2001, it was not possible to sample LU4 133 \nand LU5 in Ireland and LU2 in Portugal; therefore, additional sampling in 2002 was used to 134 \nsupplement the data set (sampling was conducted in Ireland from April 30, and in Portugal 135 \nfrom May 1). The catch in the four pitfall traps per sampling plot was pooled in the field to 136 \ngive 16 data points per LU per country; data obtained for each species was then summed over 137 \ntime to give a single value of activity-density for each species at each sampling plot within 138 \neach LU. Activity density is proportional to the interaction between carabid abundance and 139 \nactivity and is used as a surrogate for true relative abundance (Thiele, 1977).  140 \n 141 \nAll carabid beetles were identified to species and lists produced following a standard 142 \nnomenclature (L\u00f6bl & Smetana, 2003). These species were then assigned to a trophic level, 143 \neither predominantly zoophagous (carnivore and carrion feeding) or predominantly 144 \nphytophagous (herbivore, granivore) (Thiele, 1977; Lindroth, 1992; Ribera et al., 2001; 145 \n 8\nPurtauf et al., 2005). This dichotomous classification reflects the fact that most carabid 146 \nspecies will eat either plant or animal material, but will actively prefer one or other food 147 \nsource. Where no information on feeding ecology could be found for a particular species they 148 \nwere assigned to the trophic group of con-generics.  149 \n 150 \nHabitat classification and landscape structure 151 \n 152 \nHabitat type at each sampling point was classified by fieldworkers following CORINE Level 153 \n3 nomenclature and subsequently grouped for analyses into broad habitat classes: broadleaf 154 \nforest (BF), coniferous forest (CF), mixed forest (MF), intensive (IG) and extensive (EG) 155 \ngrassland, permanent (PC) and rotational (RC) cropping.  156 \n 157 \nLandscape structure in each LU was quantified using a combination of remotely sensed land 158 \ncover data and at the LU scale (1 km2) subsequently checked by fieldworkers. Two satellite 159 \nimages, a Landsat 7 ETM+ multispectral image and an IRS-1C panchromatic image were 160 \nused to create a single fused image with a 5-m spatial resolution for each LU. A hierarchic 161 \nclassification system based on the CORINE (Level 3 nomenclature) biotopes database 162 \n(European Environment Agency) was defined and - together with ground knowledge of the 163 \nLUs - used to visually interpret and using GIS (ArcView 3.1) classify the satellite images. 164 \nThese classified images were used to quantify, with the software FRAGSTATS, at the 1km2 165 \nspatial scale two metrics of landscape structure for each LU: 1) percentage cover of forest 166 \n(includes coniferous, broadleaf, mixed, woodland scrub, and Mediterranean sclerophyllous 167 \ntypes) 2) habitat richness (count of all CORINE Level 3 habitat types excluding aquatic and 168 \nartificial surfaces). Percentage forest cover was selected because it was the dominant 169 \nperennial habitat in the surveyed landscapes (Appendix S1: Fig. S1); perennial woody 170 \n 9\nhabitats represent stable refuges for carabids in contemporary landscapes dominated by 171 \nagriculture (Petit & Usher, 1998). Habitat richness was selected as it represented the 172 \naccumulation of ecological niches in the landscapes. 173 \n 174 \nStatistical Analyses 175 \n 176 \nGeneral linear mixed models (GLMMs) (proc mixed, SAS Institute 1999) were used to 177 \naccount for the nested hierarchical structure (3 levels) of the data while testing the effect of 178 \nhabitat type and landscape structure on carabid communities across Europe. The three levels 179 \nare sampling plot (768 plots = 8 countries \u00d7 6 LUs \u00d7 16 sampling plots) where carabid beetles 180 \nwere trapped and habitat type determined; landscape unit (48 1km2 LUs = 8 countries \u00d7 6 181 \nLUs); and country of origin (n = 8). 182 \n 183 \nResponse variables were activity density (count of individuals) and rarefied species richness 184 \nwithin the Carabidae and trophic groups (zoophages, phytophages). Species richness was 185 \nrarefied to account for differences in abundance between experimental plots using the Vegan 186 \nversion 1.15-0 package (Dixon, 2003) implemented in the R-statistical environment version 187 \n2.7.1 (R-Development, 2008). While species richness is an intuitive measure of biodiversity it 188 \nis problematic because the probability that additional species will be recorded increases with 189 \nthe more individuals sampled, thus comparison of species richness without standardisation 190 \ncan yield misleading patterns (Gotelli & Colwell, 2001). Rarefaction curves allow the 191 \ncomparison of species richness independently of number of individuals captured by 192 \nstandardising sampling effort (Gotelli & Colwell, 2001). Note that while rarefaction curves 193 \nare sample based, and sampling effort in the field (16 sampling points per LU) was 194 \nstandardised here, the fundamental unit with which species richness is compared remains the 195 \n 10\nnumber of individuals sampled (Colwell, 2005). All species richness values were rarefied to 196 \n10 individuals. Samples with less than this number of individuals were excluded from these 197 \nanalyses, thus reducing the number of samples considered from an original 768 to 683 for 198 \nzoophages and 704 for total Carabidae. The very high proportion (0.50) of zero values in the 199 \nphytophage species richness dataset (c.f. zoophages = 0.02) meant rarefaction of phytophage 200 \nspecies richness at a sampling effort of 10 individuals would eliminate a large proportion 201 \n(0.74) of the data. Consequently, rarefied species richness were analysed only for total 202 \nCarabidae, and the zoophagous trophic group.  203 \n 204 \nThe categorical variable: LU nested within country, was fitted as a random effect to account 205 \nfor spatial variability among the landscapes across countries. Fixed explanatory variables 206 \ntested were: year, country of origin, habitat (categorical variables), percentage forest cover per 207 \nLU, and habitat richness per LU (continuous variables). Two-way interactions between 208 \ncountry and each landscape parameter and between country and habitat tested if the response 209 \nof the Carabidae and the trophic groups was consistent across countries (non-significant 210 \ninteraction). The effect of the different broad habitat classes on the carabid groups were tested 211 \nwithin GLMMs using pair-wise differences of least-square means with multiple adjustments 212 \n(Bonferroni) for the p-values and confidence limits. Denominator degrees of freedom were 213 \nestimated using the Satterthwaite approximation (Littell et al., 1996). Explanatory fixed 214 \neffects and two-way interactions were individually fitted by forward step-wise selection. Non-215 \nsignificant terms (P >0.05) were dropped - interactions prior to main effects - before the next 216 \nstep-wise addition. This step-wise procedure halted when the simplest model containing only 217 \nsignificant terms was found; F-ratios for each explanatory variable adjusted for other 218 \nvariables (SAS Type 3 tests) are reported. The explanatory variables obtained did not differ 219 \nfrom those obtained by backward elimination from the full model. Residual plots were 220 \n 11\ninspected to ensure assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were met 221 \nfollowing log10 (activity density) and square-root (standardised species richness) 222 \ntransformation. 223 \n 224 \nResults 225 \n 226 \nTrophic group diversity across countries 227 \n 228 \nA total of 152, 863 carabids belonging to 292 species were collected from the eight countries. 229 \nMean activity density and distribution across the 48 LUs for all species collected are given in 230 \nAppendix S2.  231 \n 232 \nIn general, trophic structure of the assemblages was consistently skewed with more 233 \nzoophagous than phytophagous individuals and species in all the countries surveyed (Fig. 1). 234 \nOf the 292 species collected 200 (68%) were classified as belonging to the predominantly 235 \nzoophagous trophic group, and 92 (32%) belonging to the predominantly phytophagous group 236 \n(Appendix S2). Overall, the zoophagous group was more abundant (mean = 2055.2 \u00b1 333.2 237 \nSEM) than the phytophagous group (mean = 928.2 \u00b1 472.1 SEM). The country of origin 238 \nexplained a significant amount of the variability in both total carabid and trophic guild species 239 \nrichness and activity density (Fig.1, Table 1 & 2). Only in the case of the Hungarian dataset 240 \nwas there no significant difference in the species richness of the two trophic groups (Fig. 1B). 241 \nMuch of this between-country variability in carabid diversity is likely to be due to multiple, 242 \nunmeasured environmental influences (e.g. climate, soil) in the different landscapes across 243 \nEurope. The inclusion of the fixed effect \u2018country\u2019 and the random term \u2018LU nested within 244 \ncountry\u2019 in the GLMMs controlled for this country and landscape-specific variation when 245 \n 12\ntesting for an overall effect of habitat and landscape structure on diversity of Carabidae and 246 \ncarabid trophic groups. There was no evidence of an effect of sampling year (45 LUs sampled 247 \nin 2001, three more in 2002) on either activity density or rarefied species richness (Tables 1 & 248 \n2).  249 \n 250 \nTrophic group diversity and habitat type 251 \n 252 \nActivity densities (Table 1) and rarefied species richness (Table 2) of both trophic groups 253 \nwere affected by the interaction between country and habitat. This indicated that there were 254 \ncountry-specific associations between habitat type and trophic group diversity. One 255 \ninterpretation is that this interaction reflected differences in species pools across the European 256 \nsites. The mean activity density and species richness for each habitat \u00d7 country combination 257 \nare shown in Tables S1 & S2 in Appendix S3. 258 \n 259 \nAccounting for these significant habitat \u00d7 country interactions, the habitat type at the 260 \nsampling plot had a strong influence on the activity density of Carabidae and both trophic 261 \ngroups (Table 1, Fig. 2); but did not affect rarefied species richness of Carabidae or the 262 \nzoophage trophic group (Table 2). The influence of habitat on activity density, however, 263 \ndiffered between the phytophagous and zoophagous groups with, as predicted, a tendency for 264 \nphytophage abundance to be greater in open habitat (Fig. 2). Pair-wise comparisons of least-265 \nsquare means (with Bonferroni adjustment) showed zoophage densities were significantly 266 \ngreater under rotational cropping (RC) compared with all the other broad habitat classes: 267 \nbroadleaf forest (BF): t = -6.80, adj. P <0.001; coniferous forest (CF): t = -5.83, adj. P 268 \n<0.001; mixed forest (MF) t = -3.53, adj. P = 0.009; extensive grassland (EG) t = -7.54, adj. P 269 \n<0.001; intensive grassland (IG) t = -5.41, adj. P <0.001). The association of total Carabidae 270 \n 13\nactivity densities with habitat type (data not shown) followed the same pattern as for 271 \nzoophages (above). Phytophages were similarly more abundant in rotational cropping systems 272 \n(Fig. 2) compared with all other habitat (BF t = -10.82, adj. P <0.001; CF t = -13.10, adj. P 273 \n<0.001; MF t = -8.25, adj. P <0.001; IG t = -5.17, P <0.001; EG t = -3.67, adj. P = 0.006; PC t 274 \n= -5.16, adj. P <0.001). In addition, however, there were greater numbers of phytophage 275 \nindividuals in intensive (IG) and extensive (EG) grassland plots compared with the broadleaf 276 \n(IG t = -5.15, adj. P <0.001; EG t = -5.31, adj. P <0.0001), coniferous (IG t = -7.96, adj. P 277 \n<0.001; EG t = -7.79, adj. P <0.001), and mixed (IG t = 4.84, adj. P <0.001; EG t = 5.18, adj. 278 \nP <0.001) forest plots (Fig.2). Altogether, both phytophage and zoophage activity densities 279 \nwere greater in rotational cropping compared with the other habitats; phytophages were also 280 \nmore abundant in grassland habitats compared with forest habitats.  281 \n 282 \nTrophic group diversity and landscape structure 283 \n 284 \nCarabid beetle trophic level modulated the response of activity density \u2013 but not species 285 \nrichness - to landscape structure (Fig. 3, Table 1 & 2), contrary to our prediction, however, 286 \nthis activity density response did not scale with increasing trophic level. These data show that 287 \nactivity density of the lower trophic level (phytophages) was the most sensitive to landscape 288 \nheterogeneity (Fig. 3A; Table 1).  Zoophage activity density was independent of variation in 289 \nlandscape structure (Fig. 3B, Table 1). In contrast phytophage activity density was positively 290 \ncorrelated (Fig.3A, Table 1) with increasing habitat richness, but uncorrelated with increasing 291 \nforest cover (Table 1). The rarefied species richness of total Carabidae or zoophages was not 292 \naffected by either landscape parameter (Table 2); as already mentioned above the large 293 \nnumber of zeros in phytophage species richness precluded a comparable analysis of this 294 \ntrophic group.  295 \n 14\n 296 \nConsistency in the response of carabid trophic groups to variation in landscape structure 297 \namong the different countries was explicitly tested by fitting statistical interactions (country 298 \nof origin \u00d7 forest or habitat richness) in the GLMMs. The lack of statistical significance for 299 \nthese interactions (Tables 1 & 2) indicates that the response was very consistent and can be 300 \nconsidered a generic response of trophic group diversity.  301 \n 302 \nHabitat richness and percentage forest cover, estimated by remote sensing for each LU, were 303 \nnot correlated (Pearsons correlation coefficient r = -0.074, P = 0.618), and thus the presented 304 \nGLMMs (Tables 1 & 2) of trophic group diversity were not confounded by such an effect.  305 \n 306 \nDiscussion  307 \n 308 \nThe response of carabid beetle activity density and species richness to variation in landscape 309 \nstructure was, as hypothesised, modulated according to trophic group. The prediction that 310 \nhigher trophic levels (i.e. zoophages) would be most sensitive to landscape structure was not 311 \nsupported by these data. Instead phytophage \u2013 and not zoophage \u2013 activity densities were 312 \npositively correlated with increasing landscape habitat richness. This relationship between 313 \nphytophage densities and habitat richness was consistent (indicated by non-significant 314 \ninteraction with country) across an array of different biomes demonstrating the generality of 315 \nthis functional group response to landscape structure across Europe.  316 \n 317 \nThis greater sensitivity of phytophage diversity departs from the majority of evidence that 318 \nsensitivity to landscape structure scales with increasing trophic level (Didham et al., 1998; 319 \nGilbert et al., 1998; Holt et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2000), but agrees with other documented 320 \n 15\ndepartures from this general trend (Henle et al., 2004 and references therein). At lower trophic 321 \nlevels in a community the abundance of species or populations is \u2013 due to thermodynamic 322 \nconstraints \u2013 generally greater than that at higher trophic levels, somewhat buffering lower 323 \ntrophic levels against environmental heterogeneity, demographic and stochastic processes 324 \n(Spencer, 2000; Raffaelli, 2004). This applies particularly when considering a whole 325 \ncommunity comprising many plant and animal taxa. This paper, however, focussed on trophic 326 \nlevels within a single insect taxon, the Carabidae, here the zoophagous trophic group were 327 \nmore numerous compared with the phytophagous group, and the phytophages were the most 328 \nsensitive to landscape structure. This may be explained by a degree of dependence of the 329 \nphytophages on ruderal plant species (see below), and their relatively low abundance 330 \nincreasing sensitivity to any stochastic processes. In contrast, there may be an amount of 331 \nredundancy in the response of the speciose and abundant zoophage group to landscape 332 \nstructure - whereby in response to an environmental gradient a reduction in the abundance of 333 \none species is balanced by increasing abundance of others (Spencer, 2000; Raffaelli, 2004) 334 \n 335 \nThe relatively lower abundance and species richness of the phytophagous trophic group, and 336 \ngreater sensitivity to increasing habitat richness, may be explained by the relatively 337 \nuncommon \u2013 within Carabidae \u2013  trophic adaptation of granivory (Thiele, 1977). While the 338 \nmajority of Carabidae are able to consume both animal and plant material (Thiele, 1977), we 339 \nclassified genera according to preference for either animal or plant diet. This classification led 340 \nto the predominance within the phytophagous group of genera (e.g. Amara, Harpalus, and 341 \nZabrus, Appendix S2) to a large extent specialising on plant seed diet from grasses, 342 \numbellifers, and crucifers (Thiele, 1977; Stace, 1997; Tutin et al., 2001; Purtauf et al., 2005). 343 \nThis relative dependency of the phytophages on seeds from ruderal plants (Thiele, 1977), and 344 \nthe frequent association of these plants with disturbed sites (Ribera et al., 2001), means the 345 \n 16\nphytophages can be regarded as habitat specialists typical of grassland and agricultural 346 \nhabitats. Indeed, at a habitat level, as predicted, the abundance of phytophages was generally 347 \ngreater in open agricultural and grassland habitat compared with forest habitats. In contrast, 348 \nzoophagous carabid species are on the whole consumers of a wide variety of animal protein 349 \nboth alive and dead (Thiele, 1977; Symondson & Liddell, 1993; McKemey et al., 2003). 350 \nConsequently, these zoophages may be buffered from variation in environmental 351 \nheterogeneity at both habitat and landscape scales because of their relatively greater ability to 352 \nswitch to alternative prey in different habitat types. 353 \n 354 \nOur findings support previous research that showed generalised diversity responses of 355 \ninvertebrate trophic groups to landscape structure across geographic regions (Purtauf et al., 356 \n2005; Schweiger et al., 2005). Schweiger et al. (2005) showed with a pan-European analysis 357 \nthat arthropod assemblages across an array of trophic levels was \u2013 in order of importance \u2013 358 \nstructured by landscape structure, management intensity, and local habitat effects (Schweiger 359 \net al., 2005). This earlier study also demonstrated that both phytophagous and zoophagous 360 \nassemblages were associated with high diversity landscapes (Schweiger et al., 2005). Land-361 \nuse intensity is another driver of assemblage structure (e.g. Schweiger et al. 2005; Sousa et al. 362 \n2006) that, lacking intensification data, we did not test.  363 \n 364 \nAnother landscape-scale study found that carabid species richness was negatively related to 365 \nthe reduction in percentage cover of perennial habitats (Purtauf et al., 2005) that were 366 \nhypothesised to provide refuges from agricultural disturbance (Ribera et al., 2001). This paper 367 \nfound no evidence that increasing cover of perennial habitat (forest and woodland) enhanced 368 \ntrophic group diversity. Moreover, Purtauf et al., (2005) showed only a weak differentiation 369 \nbetween zoophagous and phytophagous responses to perennial habitat cover, while trophic 370 \n 17\ngroup activity densities were unaffected by perennial habitat cover. These discrepancies 371 \nbetween our findings and Purtauf et al. (2005) may be partly explained by methodological 372 \ndifferences. Firstly, the earlier study did not assume that congenerics shared the same diet; 373 \nsome species were thus excluded from analysis which might influence the results obtained. 374 \nSecondly, Purtauf et al. (2005) included a small and discrete omnivorous group; in this paper, 375 \ncarabid omnivory is assumed, but with a strong preference for plant or animal material. 376 \nThirdly, Purtauf et al., examined the effect of perennial habitat on carabids within agricultural 377 \nlandscapes; whereas our study included forested landscapes supporting only forest specialists 378 \n(e.g. certain Calathus and Cychrus species) and relatively low carabid species richness \u2013 the 379 \nmajority of European carabid beetles are open habitat associates (Thiele, 1977). Finally, this 380 \npapers geographic scope was much greater (c.f. Purtauf et al. 2005: 1 country, 2 regions, 36 381 \nlandscapes, 14108 individuals, and 84 species) providing greater turnover in assemblage 382 \ncomposition among our landscapes.  383 \n 384 \nEcological processes governing carabid diversity operate at both habitat and landscape scales 385 \nfor phytophages, but only at habitat scales for zoophages. Phytophage sensitivity to landscape 386 \nstructure is a consequence of the relative rarity of this trophic group among Carabidae. While 387 \na functional group approach is advocated in this paper it should be noted that taxonomy 388 \nremained essential, in assigning species to trophic groups and in interpreting patterns in 389 \ntrophic group diversity. This paper demonstrates that diversity is affected by heterogeneity at 390 \nmultiple spatial scales, and that functional traits, such as trophic group, that can predict the 391 \nmagnitude or direction of responses are an useful approach to understanding biodiversity 392 \nchange across regions (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000; Thies et al., 2003; Raffaelli, 2004; 393 \nDauber et al., 2005; Purtauf et al., 2005; Schweiger et al., 2005; Hendrickx et al., 2007). 394 \nMoreover in revealing carabid trophic group responses that are consistent across European 395 \n 18\nlandscapes it adds to growing evidence of generic responses of invertebrate diversity to land-396 \nuse and landscape structure in European landscapes (Sousa et al., 2006; Hendrickx et al., 397 \n2007; Schweiger et al., 2007; Billeter et al., 2008). 398 \n 399 \nAcknowledgements 400 \nThis paper is an output from the European Union-funded project \u2018Biodiversity assessment tools (BIOASSESS)\u2019 401 \n(EVK4-1999-00280).
