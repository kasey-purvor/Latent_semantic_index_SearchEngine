This situation resulted in a \ntwo-year project with the local university under \nthe (then) Teaching Company Scheme (which \nhas now evolved into the Knowledge Transfer \nPartnership programme) which employed a \ngraduate under university supervision to anal-\nyse and redesign the company\u2019s management \nand information systems in an enterprise-wide \nendeavour.

Thus, the second case I present \nexamines a \u2018rapid response\u2019 to industry change \nfrom a service company in the airline industry. \nIn this case, competitive advantage (and indeed \nsurvival) is linked to the rapid embedding of new \nsystems in short time frames as new business \nmodels emerge across a whole industry.

This can be followed \nby a \u2018crisis of control\u2019, if the result of delega-\ntion is poor communication between different \nparts of the organisation. It is suggested by the \nmodel that a phase of co-ordination should then \nfollow, where management and information \nsystems are reviewed and developed to improve \ncommunication and effect better reporting \nand monitoring procedures.

By 1992, four separate business units \nwere operating, in various areas of brokerage. \nHowever, in 1993, deregulation removed the \nneed for this type of brokerage role and FD \ndownsized to two business divisions concentrat-\ning instead on niche brokerage activity between \nsmall airlines and large airports in the UK. Over \nthe next few years, FD expanded again, and in \n2001, pre 9\/11, the company boasted over 100 \nemployees, a brokerage division, a ticketing \ncall centre and a branded charter service with \ntwo 737 aircraft. Post 9\/11, the charter service \nwas in liquidation and the call centre survived \nonly at the 11th hour.
