The map is being used by the \nScottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to help characterise and assess \nrisk to groundwater bodies.   \nThe methodology assesses the vulnerability of groundwater in the uppermost \naquifer to the vertical downward movement of a non-specific contaminant from the \nground surface. It considers the intrinsic properties of the pathway between the \nground surface and the water table. The key difference from previous vulnerability \nmaps in Scotland and the rest of the UK is that the new method assesses \nvulnerability in all aquifers regardless of resource potential. This reflects the \ndiverse environmental objectives for groundwater bodies under the Water \nFramework Directive. This approach provides the flexibility to combine the \ngroundwater vulnerability map with maps of pressures, groundwater resources or \nother groundwater-related receptors, as required. \nIntroduction \nGroundwater in Scotland is a valuable resource. It provides private water supplies to many \nthousands of properties and farms, and is also a source for public water supply. Many \nterrestrial ecosystems are fed by groundwater from springs and by seepage. During the summer \nmonths, groundwater helps to maintain river flows via baseflow discharge. In much of \nScotland, the natural groundwater quality is good. However, deterioration in the quality of \ngroundwater can occur, usually associated with human activity. One cause of deterioration is \nsaline intrusion, generally caused by over abstraction, but the main concern in Scotland is the \nleaching of chemicals (derived from agricultural practices or the disposal of domestic and \nindustrial wastes) vertically down into the ground.  \nAssessing the degree to which natural groundwater quality is affected by human activities is \none of the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive 2000\/60\/EC. The Water \nFramework Directive is one of the most significant pieces of European water legislation to be \nproduced in recent years. It expands the scope of protection to all waters (surface, subsurface \nand coastal), with the aim of meeting specified environmental objectives by 2015. In order to \nachieve the objectives set out in Article 4 of the Water Framework Directive, and in order to \nmanage surface and groundwater in an integrated way, the Directive introduces River Basin \nDistricts and requires that a River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) be produced for each \ndistrict. The initial phase of the RBMP involves delineation and characterisation of water \n  \nbodies (surface, groundwater and coastal) within each district, and assessments of their uses \nand the degree to which they are at risk of failing to meet the relevant environmental \nobjectives. The Directive specifies that any geological formation that is capable of providing a \ngroundwater supply of at least 10 m3 d-1 is considered to be an aquifer and must consequently \nbe designated as a groundwater body. This is a lower threshold than has previously been used \nin the UK to designate aquifers for the basis of groundwater protection, and means that all \nbedrock formations in Scotland will be designated as groundwater bodies.  \nThe risk assessment component of groundwater body characterisation involves both an \nassessment of the likelihood that certain pressures will adversely affect the underlying \ngroundwater body or downstream receptors (such as abstraction boreholes and groundwater-\ndependent ecosystems) to the extent that the groundwater body will fail to achieve good \nchemical status by 2015. The body responsible for the protection of the environment and the \nimplementation of the Water Framework Directive in Scotland is the Scottish Environment \nProtection Agency (SEPA). SEPA\u2019s strategy for the implementation of the groundwater \nprotection aspects of the Water Framework Directive requires an assessment of the \nsusceptibility of groundwater bodies, and associated receptors, to contamination, for the whole \nof Scotland.  \nAn integral part of the strategy is to provide a regional scale, relative assessment of: \nthe vertical pathway by which contaminants can reach groundwater within a groundwater \nbody, and, in certain situations, \nthe lateral pathway by which contaminants within the groundwater body can migrate to \ndowngradient receptors.  \nUsing simple, regional scale screening principles, the lateral pathway is being assessed using \nmaps of aquifer productivity for bedrock and superficial deposits, which have been produced \nby the British Geological Survey (BGS) (MacDonald et al. 2005). The vertical pathway \nassessment is based on the new assessment of groundwater vulnerability described in this \npaper.  \nPrevious groundwater vulnerability assessments in Scotland were not adequate for the Water \nFramework Directive as they were either at too small a scale, or were not available for all \ngroundwater bodies. SEPA also required that the groundwater vulnerability map be GIS-based, \nto form part of their suite of GIS-based national maps.  \nThe new methodology and map are intended to assess the vulnerability of groundwater in the \nuppermost aquifer to a potential contaminant moving through the vertical pathway from the \nland surface. In aquifers with low groundwater resource potential, such as is the case for most \nLower Palaeozoic and Precambrian basement rocks, the capacity for dilution, dispersion or \nother attenuation of contaminants is very low. A small loading of contaminant may therefore \nhave a major negative impact on groundwater quality and on the chemical status of associated \nsurface ecosystems. \nThere are differences between the new methodology and that of previous aquifer vulnerability \nassessments, such as the nitrate vulnerable zone assessment for Scotland (Ball et al. 2005) or \nthe Environment Agency\/BGS 1:100 000 scale maps of England and Wales (Palmer and Lewis \n1998, Robins et al. 2004). A key difference is that the new methodology does not specifically \ntake account of the value of the uppermost aquifer as a drinking water supply, but reflects the \nmore diverse environmental objectives for groundwater bodies under the Water Framework \n  \nDirective. This provides the flexibility to combine the groundwater vulnerability map with \nmaps of pressures, aquifer resources, or groundwater receptors, as appropriate.  \nThe new groundwater vulnerablity map is not therefore intended to be a complete solution to \ngroundwater risk assessment. Instead, it is designed to be one of a suite of maps to link \npressures with vertical groundwater pathways and downstream lateral pathways to different \nreceptors, such as large groundwater abstractions or surface water ecosystems. It is therefore a \nvital component in SEPA\u2019s groundwater characterisation methodology and has the potential to \nplay a key role in integrated water management strategies.  \nWork on the new groundwater vulnerability methodology and map was carried out by BGS \nand the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (MLURI) through a project administered by the \nScotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER) on behalf of \nSEPA and the Environment and Heritage Service, Northern Ireland (E&HS). A steering group \nwas drawn from relevant agencies in Scotland, England and Wales, Northern Ireland and the \nRepublic of Ireland. Many of the principles of the methodology are based on those adopted in \nthe Republic of Ireland (DELG\/EPA\/GSI, 1999). \nBasic concepts of groundwater vulnerability used in the new methodology \nGroundwater vulnerability is a term that has been in use for more than 30 years and has been \ninterpreted in different ways. The accepted definition of groundwater vulnerability in the UK \nand most other European countries, amended slightly to reflect the principles outlined above, is  \n\u2018the tendency and likelihood for general contaminants to reach the water table within the \nuppermost aquifer after introduction at the ground surface\u2019. All groundwater is to some extent \nvulnerable to contamination from surface or sub-surface sources (Foster 1998), and one of the \nobjectives of vulnerablity maps is to integrate geological and hydraulic characteristics of \naquifers and overlying material to indicate the relative risk to groundwater from contamination. \nFor the new Water Framework Directive screening methodology, groundwater vulnerability is \ndefined in the context of the standard hazard-pathway-receptor model: \nHazard: land use activities that pose a threat to groundwater, including waste disposal, \nurban development, farming, and mining. The new methodology considers a non-specific \ncontaminant that is conservative in its behaviour in groundwater, and assumes that all \nhazards are released at ground level. It is also possible to consider less conservative and \ndeeper releases of contaminants at a screening level using the same methodology, by \napplying the datasets underpinning the vulnerability map in different ways.  \nPathway: all material between the hazard and the receptor. This will comprise any \nsuperficial materials overlying the uppermost aquifer and, in certain circumstances, the \nunsaturated zone within the aquifer itself.  \nReceptor:  the aspect of groundwater that is at risk. In the new methodology, this is \ngroundwater in the uppermost aquifer vertically below the hazard. Other downstream \nreceptors, such as abstraction boreholes and groundwater-dependent surface ecosystems, \ncan be assessed at a screening level by combining the vulnerability map with other tools \nsuch as aquifer productivity maps.  \nThe characteristics of the pathway that influence groundwater vulnerability within the new \nmethodology are those controlling the rate of vertical movement of infiltrating water and the \ndegree of attenuation of contaminants.  \n  \nThe travel time of contaminants in the pathway not only directly affects the timing of their \narrival at the water table, but also has a bearing on the degree of attenuation that can occur. For \nexample, microbial contaminants degrade over time, and the longer they remain in the pathway \nthe smaller is their impact. At a regional scale screening level, travel time is assumed to be \ncontrolled by the pathway thickness and by the permeability and groundwater flow type of the \ncomponent geological material of the pathway. Bypass flows (rapid groundwater infiltration \nthrough high permeability conduits such as fractures or root-holes) can significantly affect \ntravel time. Although bypass flows were not directly considered in this methodology, they \nwere a key basis for the emphasis on pathway thickness in the vulnerability assessment. For the \npurposes of the regional scale assessment, bypass flow is assumed to be significant only where \nthe pathway is less than an arbitrary 3 m thick.  \nThe potential for contaminant attenuation is also directly affected by the groundwater flow type \nand by the clay content of the pathway material. Where groundwater flow is dominantly via \nfractures, it is assumed that the potential travel time of groundwater to the water table is too \nshort to allow any attenuation to take place. However, where flow is dominantly by \nintergranular means, there is a greater opportunity for water-rock interaction, filtration and \nadsorption of certain contaminants (e.g. microbes) within pore spaces, and dilution and \ndispersion effects on a micro-scale within the pore matrix. If clay is present in soil or \nsuperficial deposits, the attenuation potential with regard to groundwater vulnerability is \nenhanced, as clay has adsorptive qualities that can help reduce concentrations of certain \ncontaminants (e.g. heavy metals) reaching groundwater. Although different clays have \ndifference adsorptive qualities, the majority of clays in Scottish soil and superficial deposits are \nnon-expanding and have relatively low adsorption capacities. Therefore, within the new \nmethodology, which is designed as a screening tool for the Water Framework Directive, it is \nreasonable to consider only the presence or absence of clay.  \nThe effective pathway \u2013 the zone in which contaminant attenuation can occur \u2013 varies \naccording to the characteristics of the aquifer forming the receptor. These variations, and the \nparameters controlling the groundwater vulnerability assessment in each case, are described \nbelow and illustrated in Figure 1.  \nWhere the water table lies within a bedrock aquifer with mixed intergranular\/fracture flow \nor fracture flow only, it is assumed that significant attenuation does not occur. In these \nsituations, the pathway consists only of any superficial deposits that overlie the bedrock \naquifer. The effective pathway within the vulnerability assessment is therefore shorter than \nthe total pathway length. \nWhere the water table lies within a superficial aquifer (by definition within the new \nmethodology, this refers to high permeability superficial deposits that are at least partially \nsaturated), the pathway consists only of the unsaturated superficial deposits above the water \ntable. The effective pathway is the same as the total pathway length. Where a superficial \naquifer overlies a bedrock aquifer, the uppermost water table in the superficial aquifer is \nconsidered to be the receptor.  \nWhere the water table lies within a bedrock aquifer with dominantly intergranular flow, the \npathway consists of the unsaturated bedrock above the water table and any overlying \nsuperficial deposits. Again, the effective pathway is equal to the total pathway length. The \nattributes that control the groundwater vulnerability assessment are therefore the effective \npathway thickness, and the permeability, clay content and groundwater flow type of the \ngeological material making up the effective pathway.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1  Groundwater vulnerability scenarios showing the pathway attributes that determine vulnerability classification\nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nSuperficial Aquifer\nDepth to Water\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nBedrock Permeability\nDepth to Water \nIntergranular Bedrock Aquifer: \nexposed  \nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nNo variation\nFractured Bedrock Aquifer: \nexposed  \nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \n=\n \n0\n \nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nFractured Bedrock Aquifer:  \nsuperficial cover \nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nSuperficial Deposits Permeability \nClay > 5 m thick \nSuperficial Deposits Thickness\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nIntergranular Bedrock Aquifer: \nsoil cover only \nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nBedrock Permeability \nDepth to Water \nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nIntergranular Bedrock Aquifer: \nsuperficial cover \nSuperficial Deposits Permeability \nClay > 5 m thick \nSuperficial Deposits Thickness \nBedrock Permeability \nDepth to Water\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \nSoil Permeability \nFractured Bedrock Aquifer: \nsoil cover only \nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nP\na\nt\nh\nw\na\ny\n \n  \nData Availability for Scotland \nThe following digital datasets were used in the construction of the map: \nDiGMapGB-50, Version 1 (BGS) \u2013 This dataset comprises digital geological maps at a \nworking scale of 1:50 000 of both bedrock and superficial geology of Scotland. \nDiGMapGB-50 forms the foundation for the vulnerability assessment methodology.   \nGeoHazard (BGS) \u2013 a series of digital datasets including permeability indices derived \nfrom pumping tests and lithological descriptions, and a model of superficial deposits \nthickness.  \nSingle Onshore Borehole Index (SOBI) (BGS) \u2013 a digital borehole database containing \nalmost 500 000 records in Scotland.  \nHOST (Hydrology of Soil Types) (MLURI) \u2013 digital soils maps at 1:250 000 scale with \nan assessment of the hydraulic properties of the soil.   \nScottish Soils Database (MLURI) \u2013 a digital database of approximately 38 000 \nmeasurements of soil properties including particle size distribution. \nDigital Terrain Model (Ordnance Survey) \nRiver network (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology). \nOutline of the new methodology \nThe methodology is based on a four step process: \n\u2022 assessing the type of recharge; \n\u2022 assessing the type of aquifer forming the receptor and identifying the key pathway \ncharacteristics for consideration; \n\u2022 assessing the characteristics of the pathway; \n\u2022 assigning a vulnerability classification. \nType of recharge \nPoint recharge, for example through karstic swallow holes or mine shafts, will bypass all the \npathway elements, allowing no potential for attenuation. The vulnerability of underlying \ngroundwater will therefore always be at a maximum. Diffuse recharge, in contrast, is assumed \nto interact with the pathway material as it moves towards the water table, and groundwater \nvulnerability depends on the type of receptor and the pathway characteristics.  \nThe occurrence of point recharge can only be assumed where there are data on features such as \nkarst and mine shafts. In the absence of such national scale data for Scotland, recharge is \nassumed to be diffuse. However, if groundwater vulnerability assessments are used as part of \nland use planning or licensing processes in karstic and extensively mined areas, on-site \nassessments of point recharge features are necessary. \nType of aquifer receptor and identification of key pathway characteristics \nThe receptor is the uppermost aquifer in the geological sequence. The type of groundwater \nflow through this aquifer determines the pathway characteristics that control the vulnerability \nassessment. Groundwater moves through bedrock either via relatively small, interconnected, \n  \npore spaces as intergranular flow, or where fractures are present as fracture flow. Groundwater \nmoves through superficial aquifers only as intergranular flow. The aquifers in Scotland were \ndivided into three groups based on groundwater flow type. For each group, the key pathway \ncharacteristics that determine groundwater vulnerability are listed. \nSuperficial aquifers with intergranular flow, which includes all high permeability \nsuperficial deposits. In these aquifers, contaminant attenuation in the unsaturated zone can \nbe significant. The key pathway characteristic is the thickness of the unsaturated zone. \nBedrock aquifers with dominantly intergranular flow, which comprises a small number \nof highly porous sedimentary bedrock formations: Permian sandstones in the Dumfries \narea, Upper Devonian sandstones in Fife, and Passage Formation sandstones in central \nScotland. Fracture flow also occurs in all these aquifers, but does not generally dominate \nregional groundwater flow. In these aquifers, contaminant attenuation in the unsaturated \nzone can be significant. The key pathway characteristics are the thickness of the \nunsaturated zone within the aquifer, and the thickness and permeability of the overlying \nsuperficial deposits. \nBedrock aquifers with dominantly fracture flow, which comprise the remainder of the \nbedrock aquifers in Scotland. Within this group, some rocks show a degree of intergranular \nflow and storage, but the bulk of groundwater flow (typically more than 80% of the flow to \nan abstraction borehole) is through fractures. In these aquifers, significant contamination \nattenuation in the unsaturated zone is unlikely, due to rapid groundwater flow through \nfractures. The key pathway characteristics are the thickness and permeability of the \noverlying superficial deposits.  \nA map showing aquifer flow type for an illustrative area around Stirling is presented in Figure \n2.  \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n29500068\n00\n00\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling\nAlloa\nDenny\nSuperficial aquifer, intergranular flow\nBedrock aquifer, dominantly intergranular flow\nBedrock aquifer, dominantly fracture flow  \nFigure 2 Map showing the distribution of aquifer flow type in the area around \nStirling \n  \nAssessing pathway characteristics \nQuaternary deposits permeability \nIn the new methodology, Quaternary deposits include both soil and superficial deposits. The \nlatter are defined as those deposits beneath the soil and above bedrock, and are generally at \nleast 1 m thick. Consequently, where BGS geological maps show no superficial cover, there \nmay be up to 1 m of soil and superficial deposits present.  \nSoil permeability \nIn the Environment Agency\/BGS 1:100 000 scale aquifer vulnerability maps of England and \nWales (Palmer and Lewis 1998), soil leaching potential is combined with the characteristics of \nthe underlying geological formations across the maps, although the vulnerability assessment is \nstrongly weighted towards aquifer permeability. In the new methodology, the soil is more \nintegrated within the classification, such that it is considered as a component part of the \nsuperficial deposits. Additionally, the characteristics of the soil are allowed to influence \ngroundwater vulnerability directly where bedrock is present within 1 m of the ground surface \n(i.e., is overlain by very thin or no superficial deposits apart from the soil itself). Only the \npermeability of soils is considered, and not its chemical characteristics or leaching potential, as \nthe methodology assumes only conservative, non-specific contaminants are released. \nWhere superficial deposits are thicker than 1 m, it is assumed that the influence of soil \npermeability on groundwater vulnerability is masked by the stronger influence of the \nsuperficial deposits.  \nSoils were classified according to the HOST classification (Boorman et al. 1995), based on \ntheir presence and their permeability, as either: moderate and high permeability; low \npermeability; or absent (i.e., bare rock is exposed or soil is generally less than 0.3 m thick). \nSuperficial deposits permeability \nSuperficial deposits were divided into three classes: high, moderate or low permeability. Lower \npermeability deposits will result in a greater capacity for attenuation. \nMost superficial deposits were classified by reference to BGS superficial deposits maps and \nlithological descriptions. High permeability deposits are those dominated by sands and gravels, \nincluding river alluvium and glaciofluvial sheet deposits. Moderate permeability deposits are \nthose where there is a high proportion of fine-grained silty material as well as sand, such as in \nmany raised marine deposits. Low permeability deposits are those dominated by clays, \nincluding peat and many lacustrine deposits.  \nThe permeability of glacial till and moraine is more complex to classify, as they vary from low \npermeability clays to high permeability gravely deposits. The lithological variation in glacial \ntill across Scotland has not yet been systematically mapped. Instead, till and moraine deposits \nwere subdivided according to the permeability of the soil parent material as described in the \nScottish Soils Database (MLURI), and their spatial distribution assigned using the Hydrology \nof Soil Types (HOST) spatial dataset (Boorman et al 1995, Lilly et al 1998).  \nWhere the HOST classification showed the absence of a perched water table and\/or low clay \ncontent, the till and moraine deposits were judged to have high permeability. In general, these \nhighly permeable tills are found across the Highlands and Islands, Aberdeenshire and parts of \nsouthern Scotland. \n  \nThe remaining till and moraine deposits, generally found in the Midland Valley and the \nBorders, were subdivided on the basis of the clay content of the soil parent material, which is \ninherited from the lithology of the parent rock. Descriptions of the component parent rock were \nused to assign the remaining till and moraine deposits to one of two groups: those with a \nsignificant component of shales and\/or mudstones, and those where these rocks are absent. For \neach soil profile within the Scottish Soils Database (Langan et al 1996) that fell into either of \nthese two groups, information on the measured particle size distribution for the relatively \nunaltered basal soil horizon was extracted. An Analysis of Variance showed that there was a \nsignificant difference between the two mean clay contents (p<0.001), indicating that the clay \ncontent of the soils derived from rocks with a significant proportion of shales and mudstones \nwas significantly greater than the clay content of soils derived dominantly from sandstones and \nhard rocks. Assuming a direct relationship between permeability and the clay content of the \nunconsolidated superficial deposits, the till and moraine deposits with the smaller clay content \nwere classed as having moderate permeability, and those with the greater clay content as \nhaving low permeability. The spatial distribution of these two groups was determined by a \nsimple reclassification of the 1:250 000 scale HOST and soil maps for Scotland.  \nMaps showing soil and superficial deposit permeability classes for the same area around \nStirling as in Figure 2 are presented in Figures 3 and 4. \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n2950006\n80\n00\n0\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling\nAlloa\nDenny\nModerate & High Soil Permeability\nLow Soil Permeability  \nFigure 3 Map showing the distribution of soil permeability in the area around \nStirling \n \n  \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n29500068\n00\n00\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling\nAlloa\nDenny\nHigh Permeability Superficial Deposits\nModerate Permeability Superficial Deposits\nLow Permeability Superficial Deposits  \nFigure 4 Map showing the distribution of superficial deposits permeability in \nthe area around Stirling \nSuperficial deposits thickness \nWhere the uppermost water table is within a superficial aquifer, only the depth to the water \ntable is relevant to the vulnerablity assessment, not the total thickness of the superficial \ndeposit. However, where the uppermost water table is within a bedrock aquifer beneath \nsuperficial cover, the thickness of that cover is considered an important part of the pathway \nwithin the vulnerability methodology. Superficial deposits provide a pathway in which \nattenuation of contaminants can occur and, in general, the thicker the deposits, the more \nattenuation is possible. \nA digital map of the thickness of superficial deposits in Scotland was available prior to the \ndevelopment of the groundwater vulnerability methodology. This was developed using \ninformation on depth to rockhead from available borehole records to contour the thickness of \nsuperficial deposits. Four thickness classes were distinguished for the purposes of the \nvulnerability methodology: 1 to 3 m; 3 to 10 m; 10 to 30 m; and greater than 30 m.  \nThis method works well where there is sufficient borehole information, but for much of \nScotland, including most of the Highlands and Islands, there are few borehole records, and the \nexisting map was of limited use. The superficial deposits thickness map was modified based on \nthe current knowledge of Quaternary geology in Scotland. In the absence of borehole data, all \nmapped river alluvium and glaciofluvial sand and gravels in valleys, and all raised beach and \nblown sand deposits along the coast, are assumed to be between 3 and 10 m thick. All till and \nmoraine deposits on valley sides and high ground are assumed to be between 1 and 3 m thick. \nAlthough the improved map is still based on estimates across much of Scotland, it is based on \nfield experience and in most cases is likely to be broadly correct. It currently provides the most \nrealistic superficial deposits thickness model available for Scotland.  \n  \nA map showing superficial deposits thickness for the same area around Stirling is presented in \nFigure 5.  \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n29500068\n00\n00\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling\nAlloa\nDenny\n1 - 3 m Superficial Deposits Thickness\n3 - 10 m Superficial Deposits Thickness\n10 - 30 m Superficial Deposits Thickness\n> 30 m Superficial Deposits Thickness  \nFigure 5 Map showing the distribution of the thickness of superficial deposits \nin the area around Stirling \nThick clays \nThe permeability classifications were developed further by identifying zones where a \nsignificant thickness (greater than 5 m) of clay is present within the superficial deposit \nsequence, based on available borehole lithological data in BGS databases. Although there are \nlarge areas of Scotland where borehole data are scarce, the identified zones are thought to \nencompass the main areas in which thick clays occur in Scotland. Because superficial deposits \ncan be extremely heterogeneous, thick clays may occur at depth even where high permeability \ndeposits are mapped at the surface. Where the uppermost water table is in a superficial aquifer, \nthe presence of clays beneath this does not affect the vulnerability assessment, as the clays do \nnot form part of the pathway.  However, where underlying bedrock aquifer contains the \nuppermost water table, the presence of 5 m or more of clay within the superficial deposit \nsequence affects the overall pathway permeability. \nA map showing the presence of clays greater than 5 m thick in the area around Stirling is \npresented in Figure 6. \n \n  \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n29500068\n00\n00\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling\nAlloa\nDenny\nClay > 5 m thick  \nFigure 6 Map showing the distribution of clays over 5 m thick in the area \naround Stirling \nDepth to water \nInformation on the depth to groundwater is not available for most of Scotland, in particular for \nsuperficial aquifers. A method for estimating the base groundwater level in superficial deposits \nin valleys was developed using a digital terrain model (DTM) and a map of the SEPA national \nriver network. This is based on the concept that the depth to the water table is greater beneath \nrelatively high ground than beneath valley floors or close to the coast. The method assumes \nthat the river level (or sea level at the coast) equates to the water table surface. The maximum \ndepth to water table, for a distance of up to 3 km laterally from major rivers and the coast, was \nestimated by calculating the difference in elevation from the ground surface on the valley side \nto the river level in the valley bottom. The model was improved by including data on the \npresence of certain HOST soil classes that indicate the presence of a shallow water table \n(notionally within 2 m of the ground surface) in interfluvial areas. The resultant distribution of \nthe depth to water map was integrated only with those areas where high permeability \nsuperficial aquifers are present.  \nFour classes of depth to water are distinguished: 0 to 3 m; 3 \u2013 10 m; 10 \u2013 30 m; and greater \nthan 30 m.  \nThe depth to the water table in bedrock is relevant only in those aquifers with dominantly \nintergranular flow. These include some of the most heavily used aquifers in Scotland, for \nwhich there is normally at least some information on depth to water. For bedrock aquifers, \ntherefore, depth to water information was drawn up manually, based on available water level \nmeasurements. Four classes are again distinguished: 0 to 3 m; 3 \u2013 10 m; 10 \u2013 30 m; and greater \nthan 30 m.  \nA map showing depth to the water table in superficial deposits aquifers for the same area \naround Stirling is presented in Figure 7.

Lower \n  \npermeability rocks will result in a greater capacity for attenuation. Aquifers were divided into \nthree classes: high, moderate or low permeability, by reference to lithological descriptions \nwithin BGS databases. In Scotland, all the bedrock aquifers with dominantly intergranular flow \nin Scotland are classed as highly permeable. \nAssigning a vulnerability classification \nFive classes of groundwater vulnerability have been distinguished, based on those suggested by \nFoster (1998). The classes denote general and relative degrees of vulnerability. In the areas \nwith highest vulnerability, groundwater is vulnerable to most types of contaminant, and \ncontamination is rapid. In the areas with lowest vulnerability, groundwater is only vulnerable \nto conservative contaminants (such as chloride and nitrates) where these have been persistently \nintroduced over a long timescale. Definitions of the five vulnerability classes in terms of the \nfrequency of contamination activities and the travel time of contaminants are given in Table 1. \nThere are seven possible combinations of aquifer type, soil and superficial cover within the \nnew methodology. These combinations, or vulnerability scenarios, were illustrated in Figure 1, \nshowing the effective pathway between the ground surface and the water table in each case. \nThe attributes of the pathway (the classes into which each of the variables above is divided) \ncontrol the vulnerability classification within each scenario, and are summarised in Figure 1 \nand Table 2.  \nWithin each of the scenarios, the vulnerability classification is determined through a series of \nmatrices combining the key pathway attributes, or classes. For example, where a superficial \naquifer is present at the ground surface, the vulnerability classification depends only on the \ndepth to water table (Table 2), and a single matrix is used to assign vulnerability depending on \nwhether the depth to water table is 0 to 3 m, 3 to 10 m, 10 to 30 m, or greater than 30 m. In \nanother example, where a fractured bedrock aquifer is present, the vulnerability classification \ndepends on whether the bedrock is exposed at the surface or has a cover of soil or superficial \ndeposits (Table 2). Different matrices are used in each case: for example, where there is a soil \ncover but no superficial deposits, a matrix assigns vulnerability depending on whether soil \npermeability is moderate and high, or low.  \nThe following general rules were used to ensure the matrices were developed according to \nconsistent, scientific principles: \n\u2022 Groundwater is most vulnerable in areas where point recharge can bypass superficial \ndeposits, and where fractured unsaturated bedrock allows rapid groundwater flow to the \nwater table. \n\u2022 All bedrock is liable to fracturing to some degree. Some protection from thick and\/or \nlow permeability superficial deposits is therefore required to significantly reduce \nvulnerability, even where bedrock has a significant intergranular porosity. \n\u2022 Superficial deposits can also be fractured and their thickness and properties are often \nvariable over short distances. As such, mapped thicknesses of greater than 3 m are \nrequired to significantly reduce vulnerability. \n\u2022 The capacity of the soil to attenuate contaminants and affect groundwater vulnerability \nis only assumed to be significant where superficial deposits are absent or are less than \n1 m thick. \nAn extract of the new groundwater vulnerability map for the same area around Stirling as \nshown in the previous maps is presented in Figure 9.  \n  \nTable 1 Definition of vulnerability classes with regard to the frequency of \ncontamination activity and the travel time of contaminants through the pathway (adapted \nfrom Foster 1998) \n \nVULNERABILITY \nCLASS \nDESCRIPTION RELATIONSHIP TO \nTHE FREQUENCY OF \nCONTAMINATION \nACTIVITY \nTRAVEL \nTIME \n5 \nVulnerable to most water \ncontaminants with rapid \nimpact in many cases. \n \nVulnerable to individual \nevents \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVulnerable only to \npersistent activity \n \nRapid \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVery slow \n4 \nVulnerable to those \ncontaminants not readily \nadsorbed or transformed. \n3 \nVulnerable to some \ncontaminants, but many are \nsignificantly attenuated. \n2 \nVulnerable to some \ncontaminants, but only when \ncontinuously introduced. \n1 \nOnly vulnerable to \nconservative contaminants in \nthe long-term when \ncontinuously and widely \nintroduced. \n \n  \nTable 2 Pathway attributes that determine vulnerability classification for each \nvulnerability scenario \n \n  SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS \n \n EXPOSED \nBEDROCK SOIL COVER ONLY SUPERFICIAL COVER \nTA\nR\nG\nET\n A\nQ\nU\nIF\nER\n &\n F\nLO\nW\n M\nEC\nH\nA\nN\nIS\nM\n \nSUPERFICIAL \u2013 \nINTERGRANULAR \nFLOW \nDepth to Water \nBEDROCK \u2013 \nFRACTURE FLOW No variation Soil Permeability  \nSuperficial Deposits Permeability \nClay > 5 m thick \nSuperficial Deposits Thickness \nBEDROCK \u2013 \nINTERGRANULAR \nFLOW \nBedrock Permeability \nDepth to Water \nSoil Permeability \nBedrock Permeability  \nDepth to Water \nSuperficial Deposits Permeability \nClay > 5 m thick \nSuperficial Deposits Thickness \nBedrock Permeability  \nDepth to Water \n \n  \n \n275000\n275000\n280000\n280000\n285000\n285000\n290000\n290000\n295000\n2950006\n80\n00\n0\n68\n00\n00\n68\n50\n00\n68\n50\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n00\n00\n69\n50\n00\n69\n50\n00\n70\n00\n00\n70\n00\n00\nStirling Alloa\nDenny\n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1\nHighest vulnerability\nLowest vulnerability  \n \n \n \nFigure 9 Map of groundwater vulnerability in the area around Stirling  \n  \nApplication of the Groundwater Vulnerability Map \nThe new groundwater vulnerability map will help underpin SEPA\u2019s approach to the \nimplementation of the groundwater protection aspects of the Water Framework Directive. As a \nstand-alone product, it provides an overview of groundwater vulnerability across Scotland at a \nsuitable scale for use in groundwater body characterisation.  \nWhere there is information on known point recharge features, the methodology can be adapted \nto take specific account of potential point source pollution. For example, areas within a set \ndistance from a point recharge feature, such as a swallow hole in karstic limestone, could be \nclassified as having very high vulnerability.  \nA further application is the development of an integrated GIS-based suite of maps that would \ninclude groundwater vulnerability, aquifer productivity, land use hazards and key groundwater \nand groundwater-dependent receptors. If developed in conjunction with appropriate guidance \ndocuments, such a suite of maps would be a powerful tool to help regulators make objective, \nrisk-based prioritisation decisions on the scope of any ground investigations.  \nThe GIS-based methodology is also applicable to other areas where digital data are available.   \nConclusions \nThe new GIS-based groundwater vulnerability map illustrates the relative risk to groundwater \nfrom contamination at a regional scale across the whole of Scotland, by revealing the \nlikelihood of a non-specific contaminant moving vertically downward and reaching the \nuppermost aquifer after introduction at the ground surface.  \nThe methodology behind the map is based on a standard hazard-pathway-receptor model of \ngroundwater vulnerability. It considers the intrinsic geological and hydraulic properties of the \npathway between the ground surface and the water table in the uppermost aquifer. \nBased on this model, the map shows that groundwater is most vulnerable where fractured \naquifers with a shallow water table are overlain by a thin cover of superficial deposits and\/or \nsoil. The areas where groundwater is least vulnerable are those where aquifers are protected by \na thick unsaturated zone (deep water table) and a thick cover of low permeability clayey \nsuperficial deposits.  \nA key difference between this and previous groundwater vulnerability maps developed for \nScotland and the rest of the UK is that the new methodology focuses on the Water Framework \nDirective requirement to protect groundwater in all groundwater bodies, regardless of resource \npotential.  \nA further difference in the new method is that soils data have been integrated into the \nclassification of superficial deposit permeability, rather than simply overlain. This has \nproduced a more rigorous assessment of both the potential for rapid downward movement of \ninfiltrating water and contaminants, and the potential for contaminant attenuation. By contrast, \nin past classifications the soil properties often outweighed the protection afforded by thick, \nclayey superficial deposits. \nThe new map allows national consistency in groundwater vulnerability assessments. It is an \nintegral part of SEPA\u2019s approach to the implementation of the groundwater protection aspects \nof the Water Framework Directive.  \n \n  \nAcknowledgements \nWe acknowledge the support of the following: SNIFFER; SEPA; Hugh Barron, Peter \nMcConvey and Nick Robins, BGS; Rob Ward and Steve Fletcher, Environment Agency; and \nDonal Daly, Geological Survey of Ireland.
