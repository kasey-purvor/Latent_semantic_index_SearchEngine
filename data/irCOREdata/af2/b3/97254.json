Modeling is not the final goal,\nbut is a tool to increase understanding of the system, to de-\nvelop more directed experiments, and finally to enable pre-\ndictions. This definition of cancer systems biology matches\nclosely the definition of the EraSysBio consortium of 16 Eu-\nropean ministries, funding bodies, and project management\nagencies from 13 countries.29\nThe most popular definitions of systems biology refer to\n\u201cdynamics,\u201d \u201cmechanisms,\u201d \u201cprinciples,\u201d and \u201cbehaviors.\u201d\nThe complexity of biological systems and\/or functions\narises from the interaction of a myriad of nonlinear spatio-\ntemporal phenomena and components. The fact that most\ncellular processes, such as cell-cycle control, cell differentia-\ntion, and apoptosis, are inherently dynamical highlights the\nneed for integrating mathematical modeling into life science\nand clinical research. A systems biology approach can help\nidentify and analyze the principles, laws, and mechanisms\nunderlying the behavior of biological systems.\nThe participants of the strategic workshop concluded\nthat advancing biomedical applications through systems\nbiology approaches requires the development of new theo-\nretical methodologies, such as novel techniques for data-\nbased system identification, theoretical concepts for the\ndesign of experiments, good methods for hypothesis test-\ning, theoretical frameworks to couple processes occurring\nat (and across) different spatial and temporal scales, andhttp:\/\/www.erasysbio.net, strategy paper, page 6.29\nCancer Systems Biologyeffective algorithms to solve problems of computational\ncomplexity.Approaching Tumor Complexity by Integrating\nExperiments with Mathematical Modeling\nIn order for systems biology to succeed in cancer research,\nand ultimately become an integrated part of it, rather than a\nseparate discipline, it has to overcome significant barriers to\nthe acceptance of mathematical modeling in the life sciences.\nSuch models are necessary because of the dynamic nature of\nmany biological processes involved in the initiation and pro-\ngression of cancer. In order to allow the formulation and cal-\nibration of mathematical models, quantitative data have to\nbe generated.\nBecause the systems approach is, above all, a different way\nof thinking about the organization and behavior of dynami-\ncal systems, the impact of systems biology approaches is\nmore difficult to measure. This situation is further confound-\ned by the fact that all models are abstractions of reality, be-\ncause all the hypotheses on which they are based will\neventually prove to be incomplete in one way or another,\nand science progresses by uncovering these shortcomings\nand looking for models that are improved (if never perfect).\nMathematical models, however, have the advantage of be-\ning quantitative and interactive rather than solely descrip-\ntive. The process by which models are formulated, and\nwhich may include the representation of genetic, epigenetic,\ncellular, and tissue effects across the various physical and\ntemporal scales during tumorigenesis, helps to articulate\nhypotheses and thereby supports the design of appropriate\nexperiments to test them. Consequently, models cannot be\nregarded as \u201cdeliverables\u201d or \u201cfinal products\u201d that unambig-\nuously mark the success of a systems biology project.\nThe role of mathematical modeling is to provide a concep-\ntual framework for the formulation and quantitative testing\nof hypotheses. However, the initial purpose is not prediction\nbut to enhance our \u201cunderstanding\u201d of a biological system.\nGenerating predictions is one way to test whether this un-\nderstanding is consistent with the behavior of the system\nof interest.www.aacrjournals.orgAn Unlikely End to a New Discipline\nRather than defining systems biology as a separate disci-\npline, the workshop participants' recommendation is to en-\ncourage the incorporation of \u201csystems biology approaches\u201d\nacross new research programs, particularly those of medical\nrelevance to cancer. Systems biology emphasizes the integra-\ntion and coordination between theoretical and experimental\nefforts. If systems biology approaches were widely adopted\nin the life sciences as a powerful tool for hypothesis testing,\nthere would be no need to consider systems biology as a\nseparate discipline. However, considering the skepticism\nthat exists toward mathematical modeling in the life\nsciences, it remains important to emphasize and show its\nvalue in dealing with biological complexity.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nAcknowledgments\nThe organizers of the workshop would like to thank Dr.\nFrederick Marcus and Prof. Frank Laplace from the BMBF\nfor their support, advice, and encouragement.
