It briefly reviews the first major postwar revival of \ntheoretical interest in the state that began in Western Europe during the mid-\n1960s. This was mainly led by Marxists interested in the general form and \nfunctions of the capitalist state; but a key supporting role was played by \nMarxist-feminists who extended such ideas to the patriarchal capitalist state.2 A \nsecond revival during the late 1970s is then described. This involved many \nmore theoretical currents and substantive concerns and was also more \ninstitutionalist in overall approach. Although the self-declared movement to \n'bring the state back in' originated in the United States, some of the most \ninnovative work in this theoretical movement is rooted in less overtly state-\ncentred approaches originating in Western Europe. Indeed some of them argue \nthat the state as such should be dethroned from its central position in analyses \nof political power and domination. Thus, in addition to neo-statism, I also \nconsider Foucauldian theory, feminism, and discourse analysis. By the 1990s \nthis proliferation of approaches had contributed paradoxically to an apparent \nwithering away of interest in the state as such. Nonetheless, as I argue below, \nresearch on the state is continuing in new and exciting forms and directions.  \n \nI -- The Marxist Legacy \n \nIt is oft remarked that Marx and Engels left no adequate theory of the state. \nInstead, their work comprises a loose and often irreconcilable series of \nphilosophical, theoretical, journalistic, partisan, ad hominem, or purely ad hoc \ncomments. Later, the Second International (Social Democracy) and the \nComintern (Marxism-Leninism) developed one-sided accounts of the state \nbased on selective interpretation of certain accessible basic writings of Marx \nand Engels. The Second International primarily advanced instrumentalist \nand\/or epiphenomenalist views of the state, modified on occasion to take \naccount of the changing balance of political forces, changing stages of \ncapitalism, and the relative stability or crisis-prone nature of capitalism. It also \ncame to support a parliamentary democratic road to socialism based on the \nelectoral conquest of power and on state planning or nationalization of the \ncommanding heights of industry. Such state control of the economy would be \nfacilitated by the growing concentration and centralization of economic and \npolitical power in a steadily emerging organized capitalism. The Comintern also \ntended to advance instrumentalist or epiphenomenalist views and elaborated \nLenin's idea about the fusion of the state and monopolies into a single \nmechanism of economic exploitation and political oppression in the form of \nstate monopoly capitalism. It also developed the Marxist-Leninist claim that the \nbourgeois democratic republic was essentially capitalist in nature. This ruled \nout any parliamentary road and implied that an entirely new form of state \nshould forcibly replace bourgeois democracy: a soviet system based on \nworkers' councils with direct rather than indirect democracy. There was an \nobvious tension between this commitment to direct democracy and the role of \nthe vanguard communist party in leading the revolution to install and \nconsolidate this new state system. The other main contributions to state theory \nin the interwar period were those of first generation Critical Theorists concerned \nwith the trends towards a strong, bureaucratic state -- whether authoritarian or \ntotalitarian in form.3 This corresponded to the development of organized or \nstate capitalism, relied increasingly on the mass media for its ideological power, \nand had integrated the trade union movement as a political support or else \nsmashed it as part of the consolidation of totalitarian rule. Gramsci was also \nwriting during this period, of course; but his prison notebooks only became \nwidely known and influential in the 1950s and 1960s. \n \nA serious revival of Marxist interest in the state, going well beyond the main \nprewar approaches and arguments, occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s. It \nwas stimulated by the apparent success of the Keynesian welfare national state \nin managing postwar capitalism in the economic space by Atlantic Fordism and \nby the desire to show that this state form was still essentially capitalist in \ncharacter.  Thus it was initially concerned with deriving the necessary form and \nfunctions of the capitalist state from the basic categories of Marx's critique of \npolitical economy and proving that contemporary states could not actually \nsuspend the crisis-tendencies and contradictions of capitalism. In its concern \nwith the fundamental features of the capitalist state, this revival of interest had \nalready largely imploded in the late 1970s. It did so under the weight of a \nmultitude of competing theoretical starting points and an overemphasis on \nhighly abstract theorizing that blithely disregarded the historical variability of \npolitical regimes and the different forms taken by capitalism. Indeed, with a few, \nnotable exceptions, individual contributions to the Marxist state debate have \nbeen lost in the mists of time. But several of the better analysts did formulate \ntwo key insights that are relevant to a far wider theoretical circle and\/or that \nconcern more specific historical and comparative issues. Although these \ninsights were not always expressed in the same words, there was a clear \nconvergence in their core underlying arguments.  \n \nFirstly, in turning from functional analysis to form analysis, Marxist state \ntheorists discovered that form threatens function. Much of their initial work was \nconcerned to derive the necessary form of the state from the various functions \nit was supposedly required to perform on behalf of capital. Seen in such terms, \nform must follow from function. This argument is quite consistent with claims \nabout the state's relative autonomy on condition that the latter is seen both as \nnecessary and as limited to the state's ability to meet the interests of capital. \nBut later work tended to explore how the typical form of the capitalist state \nactually problematized its overall functionality for capital accumulation and \npolitical class domination. Thus viewed, dysfunction may follow from form. For \nthe institutional separation of the state from the market economy, a separation \nwhich was regarded as a necessary and defining feature of capitalist societies, \nresults in the dominance of different (and potentially contradictory) institutional \nlogics and modes of calculation in the state and the economy (e.g., Hirsch \n1976; Offe 1984; Poulantzas 1978; Reuten and Williams 1989). Thus there is \nno guarantee that political outcomes will serve the needs of capital -- even if \n(and, indeed, precisely because) the state is operationally autonomous. This \nconclusion fuelled work on the structural contradictions, strategic dilemmas, \nand path-dependent (i.e., historically conditioned) development of specific state \nforms. It also prompted a decline in highly abstract and often essentialist \ntheorization in favour of more detailed accounts of the complex interplay of \nsocial struggles and institutions. \n \nSecondly, gradually abandoning views of the state apparatus as a simple thing \nor a unitary class subject, Marxist theorists began to analyse state power as a \ncomplex social relation. Some early works saw the state as little more than a \nneutral instrument of class domination; some adopted a more structuralist view \naccording to which the state was bound to serve capitalist interests regardless \nof who controlled it; and yet other works viewed the state as a kind of rational \ncalculating subject, an ideal collective capitalist, able both to discern and \npursue the real interests of capital in general against the particular or perceived \ninterests of individual capitals. None of these views proved satisfactory.4 What \ngradually (and partially) emerged to replace them were studies of different \nstates' structural selectivity and the factors that shaped their strategic \ncapacities. By structural selectivity they referred to the ways in which the state \nas an ensemble of institutions had a specific, differential impact on the ability of \nvarious political forces to pursue particular interests and strategies in and \nthrough access to and control over given state capacities -- themselves always \ndependent for their effects on links to forces and powers beyond the state (on \nthis concept, see especially, Offe 1972; Poulantzas 1978). More attention was \nalso paid to the variability of these capacities, their organization, and exercise. \nThis prompted greater emphasis on the relational nature of state power and on \nstates' capacities to project their power into social realms well beyond their own \ninstitutional boundaries. And, as with the first set of insights, it also led to more \ncomplex studies of struggles, institutions, and political capacities. \n \nGramsci is almost alone among Marxist state theorists whose work attracted \nsustained attention in this first postwar revival still to enjoy widespread critical \nacclaim in the 1990s. It is surely no accident that Gramsci studied the concrete \nmodalities of state power rather than theorizing the capitalist state in general. \nHe investigated the 'state in its inclusive sense' (i.e., 'political society + civil \nsociety') and showed how state power in bourgeois societies rested on \n'hegemony armoured by coercion' (Gramsci 1971). Moreover, rather than just \ntreating specific institutions and apparatuses as technical instruments of \ngovernment, Gramsci was concerned with their social bases and stressed how \ntheir functions and effects are shaped by their links to the economic system \nand civil society. Together with its incomplete and tentative character, this \nmakes his approach compatible with several other theoretical currents. Among \nthese are discourse theory, feminism, Foucauldian analyses, and post-\nmodernism (e.g., Golding 1992; Lester 2000; Sassoon 1980; Smart 2002; and \nHolub 1992). The more open-ended and polyvalent nature of Gramsci's work \nhas helped to maintain the vitality of his work. \n \nA more recent source of continued interest in Marxist state theory is much less \ndirect but still very significant, namely, the regulation approach to political \neconomy. This diverse school of thought first emerged in the late 1970s and \nbecame prominent in the 1980s. In this sense it can properly be considered as \nparticipating in the second wave of interest in state theory. The essential (re-) \ndiscovery of regulationism was that capitalist economies are socially embedded \nand social regularized. From here it was but a short step (more difficult for \nsome than others) to the realization that the state system had a key role to play \nin the reproduction-regulation of capital accumulation. This opened the way for \nmore complex and concrete analyses of the state's contribution to the shaping, \nsustaining, and undermining of specific accumulation regimes and modes of \ngrowth. This is one of the main themes of second and third generation \nregulation theory (e.g., H\u00e4usler and Hirsch 1987; Jenson 1990; Jessop 1992, \n1997b; No\u00ebl 1990; Th\u00e9ret 1992). \n \n \n \n \nII -- The Second Wave \n \nPossibly the most important single theoretical current to have shaped the \nsecond revival of interest in the state as such was the movement (especially \npopular in the USA) to 'bring the state back in' as a critical explanatory variable \nin social analysis. But this movement did not go unchallenged. For, besides the \ncontinuing influence of Gramsci and the variable impact of other neo-Marxist \ncurrents, serious competition came from several other approaches. Among \nthese are, first, the work of Foucault and his followers on the disciplinary \norganization of society, the micro-physics of power, and changing forms of \ngovernmentality -- an approach that ran counter to neo-statism in tending to \nremove the state from theoretical view once again; second, the development of \na broad-based feminist critique of malestream state theory -- an approach \nwhich raised, among other questions, the issue of whether feminists (and \nothers) really need a theory of the state; and, third, growing interest in the \ndiscourses and practices that constitute the state -- an approach that oscillates \nrather unsteadily between deconstructing and reconstructing the state as a \ntheoretical object. This list is not exhaustive but will suffice to illustrate the \nrange of positions in the second revival. \n \n1) State-Centred Approaches \n \nDemands to 'bring the state back' in came from social scientists who claimed \nthat the dominant postwar approaches to the state were too 'society-centred'. \nThese approaches allegedly tried to explain the form, functions, and impact of \nthe state in terms of factors rooted in the organization, needs, or interests of \nsociety. Thus Marxism was accused of economic reductionism for its emphasis \non base-superstructure relations and the class struggle; pluralism was charged \nwith limiting its account of competition for state power to interest groups and \nmovements rooted in civil society and thus ignoring the distinctive role and \ninterests of state managers; and structural-functionalism was criticized for \nassuming that the development and subsequent operations of the state or \npolitical system were determined by the functional requirements of society as a \nwhole. According to 'state-centred' theorists such approaches put the cart \nbefore the horse. They themselves argued that state activities and impact are \neasily explained in terms of its own distinctive properties as an administrative or \nrepressive organ and\/or the equally distinctive properties of the broader political \nsystem encompassing the state. Societal factors, when not actually deemed \nwholly irrelevant, were certainly secondary; and their impact on state affairs \nwas always filtered through the political system and the state itself. \n \nIn its more programmatic guise the statist approach often advocated a return to \nclassic theorists such as Machiavelli, Clausewitz, de Tocqueville, Weber, or \nHintze.5 In practice, however, those working in the statist paradigm have shown \nlittle interest in (let alone any real familiarity with) such thinkers, with the partial \nexception of Weber.6 Indeed it often appears that these thinkers are cited \nchiefly to legitimate neo-statism by linking it to a long tradition of state-centred \nthought. In any event, the real focus of state-centred work is detailed case \nstudies of state building, policy-making, and implementation. \n \nIn this latter context six themes have been emphasized: (1) the geo-political \nposition of different modern states within the international system of nation-\nstates and its implications for the logic of state action; (2) the dynamic of \nmilitary organization and the impact of warfare in the overall development of the \nstate; (3) the distinctive administrative powers of the modern state -- especially \nthose rooted in its capacities to produce and enforce collectively binding \ndecisions within a centrally organized, territorially bounded society -- and its \nstrategic reach in relation to all other social sub-systems (including the \neconomy), organizations (including capitalist enterprises), and forces (including \nclasses) within its domain; (4) the state's role as a distinctive factor in shaping \ninstitutions, group formation, interest articulation, political capacities, ideas, and \ndemands beyond the state -- the aspect sometimes identified as \n'Tocquevillean'; (5) the distinctive pathologies of government and the political \nsystem -- such as bureaucratism, political corruption, government overload, or \nstate failure; and (6) the distinctive interests and capacities of 'state managers' \n(career officials, elected politicians, etc.) as opposed to other social forces. \nDifferent 'state-centred' theorists have emphasized different factors or \ncombinations thereof. But the main conclusions persist: there are distinctive \npolitical pressures and processes that shape the state's form and functions; \nthat give it a real and important autonomy when faced with pressures and \nforces emerging from the wider society; and that thereby give it a unique and \nirreplaceable centrality both in national life and the international order. In short, \nthe state is a force in its own right and does not just serve the economy or civil \nsociety (e.g., Krasner 1978; Nordlinger 1981; Skocpol 1979; and Stepan 1985).  \n \nTheir approach leads 'state-centred' theorists to advance a very different \napproach to state autonomy. For Marxist theorists, the latter was primarily \nunderstood in terms of its capacity to promote the long-term, collective interests \nof capital even when faced with opposition -- including that from particular \ncapitalist interests. Neo-statists reject such a class- or capital-theoretical \naccount and suggest the state can exercise autonomy in its own right and in \npursuit of its own, quite distinctive, interests. Accordingly, they emphasize: (a) \nstate managers' ability to exercise power independently of (and even in the \nface of resistance from) non-state forces -- especially where a pluralistic \nuniverse of social forces provides them with broad room for manoeuvre; and (b) \nthe grounding of this ability in state capacities or 'infrastructural' power, i.e., the \nstate's ability to penetrate, control, supervise, police, and discipline modern \nsocieties through its own specialized capacities (e.g., Dandeker 1990; Giddens \n1985; Mann 1983; Nordlinger 1981; Skocpol 1985). Moreover, neo-statists \nargue that state autonomy is not a fixed structural feature of each and every \ngovernmental system. It differs across states, by policy area, and over time. \nThis is partly due to external limits on the scope for autonomous state action \nand partly to variations in the capacity and readiness of state managers to \npursue a strategy independent of non-state actors. \n \nA specific variant of state-centred theorizing is found in war-centred state \ntheory. A growing band of theorists re-instated the military dimension of state \ntheory and complained about its neglect in other schools -- something they \nattributed to Marxists' exaggerated interest in class struggle and to sociologists' \nfalse belief in the inherently pacific logic of industrialism. Yet, for war-centred \ntheorists, war is not just of archival interest: it is highly relevant to modern \nstates. They note that war has decisively shaped the present century, states \ncontinually prepare for war and have much enhanced military and surveillance \ncapacities, and citizens' (or total) wars have repercussions throughout state \nand society (e.g., Shaw 1991).  \n \nFor such theorists, the state is seen as an apparatus for war-making and \nrepression. It must defend its territorial integrity against other forces and \nmaintain social cohesion inside its own territory by resorting to coercion as and \nwhen this proves necessary.  Thus the state is seen in the first instance as the \nbearer of military power within a world of other nation states, rather than as a \npolitical community within which citizenship rights may be realised (cf. Giddens \n1985). Indeed, for some war-centred theorists, not only is the fully-formed state \na military-repressive apparatus but the very process of state formation is itself \nclosely tied to war. For, as Tilly pithily notes, wars make states and states make \nwars. This goes beyond the trite remark that states are often forged in the heat \nof war (either in victory or defeat); it also involves the idea that war-making can \ninduce political centralisation, encourage the development of a modern taxation \nsystem, and produce other such features of a modern state. Moreover, once \nthe state emerges (through war or preparation for war), many key aspects of \nthe state's form and functions are determined primarily by concerns with \nexternal defence and internal pacification (e.g., Mann 1985, 1987; Tilly 1973, \n1992; Dandeker 1990; Porter 1996; Shaw 1991). \n \nFive main lines of criticism have been advanced against neo-statism.7 Firstly, it \nis said that the approach is hardly novel and that all its core themes can be \nfound in the so-called 'society-centred' approaches (e.g., Domhoff 1987; \nAlmond 1988). Secondly, it has been said that neo-statism is one-sided \nbecause it focuses on state and party politics at the expense of political forces \noutside and beyond the state. In particular, it seems to substitute 'politicians for \nsocial formations (such as class or gender or race), elite for mass politics, \npolitical conflict for social struggle' (Gordon 1990: 181). Thirdly, some critics \nclaim to have identified empirical inadequacies in several key statist studies as \nwell as incomplete and misleading accounts of other studies cited to lend some \ncredence to the statist approach (e.g., Cammack 1989, 1990; Mitchell 1991). \nFourthly, charges of political bad faith have been laid. Thus Binder argued that \nneo-statism implies that politically autonomous state managers can act as \neffective agents of economic modernization and social reform and should be \nencouraged to do so; in support of this charge, he notes that no neo-statist \ncase studies exist revealing the harmful effects of their authoritarian or \nautocratic rule (Binder 1988). \n \nFinally, and most seriously, neo-statism is held to rest upon a fundamental \ntheoretical fallacy. It assumes there are clear and unambiguous boundaries \nbetween state apparatus and society, state managers and social forces, and \nstate power and societal power. It implies that the state (or the political system) \nand society are mutually exclusive and self-determining, each can be studied in \nisolation, and the resulting analyses added together to provide a complete \naccount. This reifies and renders absolute what are really emergent, partial, \nunstable, and variable distinctions. It rules out hybrid logics such as \ncorporatism or policy networks; divisions among state managers due to ties \nbetween state organs and other social spheres; and many other forms of \noverlap between state and society (e.g., Atkinson and Coleman 1992; \nPoulantzas 1974; Jessop 1990). If this assumption is rejected, however, the \ndistinction between state-centred and so-called society-centred approaches \ndissolves. And this in turn invalidates, not merely the extreme claim that the \nstate apparatus should be treated as the independent variable in explaining \npolitical and social events, but also lesser neo-statist claims such as the \nheuristic value of bending the stick in the other direction or, alternatively, of \ncombining state-centred and society-centred accounts to produce the complete \npicture. \n \nThis does not rule out theoretical analyses of the state, of course; it does mean \nthat state theory cannot take the state for granted. For the very existence of the \nstate is problematic. Thus Mitchell concludes his own critique of neo-statism \nwith a plea to study 'the detailed processes of spatial organization, temporal \narrangement, functional specification, and supervision and surveillance, which \ncreate the appearance of a world fundamentally divided into state and society' \n(1991: 95, italics mine). This division is conceptually prior to any possible \ninfluence of state on society, or society on the state; and it is one that is always \nproduced in and through practices on both sides of the state-society divide. \nThis crucial point is taken up in my conclusions but also provides an \nappropriate bridge to Foucault's work. \n \n2) Foucauldian Approaches \n \nIf state-centred theorists hoped to bring the state back in from the cold, putting \nit out for the garbage collector could well describe Foucault's ultimate goal. For \nhe linked his historical investigations into power, knowledge, and discipline to a \nsustained theoretical rejection of liberal and Marxist views of sovereignty, law, \nand the state. More generally his work has major implications for all state \ntheorists because it casts grave doubt on their preoccupation with the state -- \nwhether as an independent, intervening, or dependent variable. Indeed \nFoucault compared his rejection of attempts to build a state theory with the \nwholly sensible refusal to eat an indigestible meal (Gordon 1991: 4). \n \nThis attempt at theoretical self-preservation seems to have been grounded in \nthree key arguments. Firstly, Foucault alleged that state theory is essentialist: \nfor it tries to explain the nature of the state and state power in terms of their \nown inherent, pre-given properties. It should be trying instead to explain the \ndevelopment and functioning of the state as the contingent out-come of specific \npractices which are not necessarily (if at all) located within, nor openly oriented \nto, the state itself. Secondly, state theory is alleged to retain medieval notions \nof a centralized, monarchical sovereignty and\/or a unified, juridico-political \npower. In place of such notions Foucault stressed the tremendous dispersion \nand multiplicity of the institutions and practices involved in the exercise of state \npower and insisted that many of these were extra-juridical in nature. And, \nthirdly, state theorists were allegedly preoccupied with the forms of sovereign \npolitical and legal power at the summits of the state apparatus, the discourses \nwhich legitimated power at the centre, and the extent of the sovereign state's \nreach into society. In contrast Foucault advocated an ascending, bottom-up \napproach which proceeds from the diffuse forms of power relations in the many \nand varied local and regional sites where the identity and conduct of social \nagents was actually determined. He was concerned with what he described as \nthe micro-physics of power, the actual practices of subjugation, rather than the \nmacro-political strategies that guide attempts at domination. For state power \ndoes not stem from control over some substantive, material resource peculiar \nto the state. It is actually the provisional, emergent result of the complex \nstrategic interplay of diverse social forces within and beyond the state. It is \ndispersed and involves the active mobilization of individuals and not just their \npassive targeting, and can be colonized and articulated into quite different \ndiscourses, strategies, and institutions. In short, power is not concentrated in \nthe state: it is ubiquitous, immanent in every social relation (see notably \nFoucault 1975, 1980). \n \nThis did not mean that Foucault rejected all concern with the macro-physics of \nstate power. Far from it. Indeed, among those most closely identified with the \nlinguistic turn and post-structuralism, Foucault is unusual for his interest in the \nstate (cf. Pringle and Watson 1992: 56). This was no longer identified with the \nsovereign state described in juridical-political discourse, however; for Foucault's \napproach was far more idiosyncratic and powerful. He regarded the state as \nthe site of statecraft and governmental rationality. Thus he studied how \ndifferent political regimes emerged through shifts in 'governmentality'. What \ninterested Foucault was the art of government, a skilled discursive practice in \nwhich state capacities were used reflexively to monitor the population and, with \nall due prudence, to make it conform to specific state projects. At the origins of \nthe Foucauldian state was raison d'\u00e9tat, an autonomous political rationality, set \napart from religion and morality (Gordon 1991: 9). This in turn could be linked \nto different modes of political calculation or state projects, such as those \ncoupled to the 'police state' (Polizeistaat), social government, or the welfare \nstate (Gordon 1991: 26-7). It was in and through these governmental \nrationalities or state projects that more local or regional sites of power were \ncolonized, articulated into ever more general mechanisms and forms of global \ndomination, and then maintained by the entire state system. Foucault also \ninsisted on the need to explore the connections between these forms of micro-\npower and mechanisms for producing knowledge -- whether for surveillance, \nthe formation and accumulation of knowledge about individuals, or their \nconstitution as specific types of subject (Foucault 1991). \n \nFoucault's work has inspired many other studies of the state and state power. \nThese are generally focused on specific policies or policy apparatuses and\/or \nspecific political discourses and strategies (e.g. Barry et al., 1996; Burchell et \nal., 1991; Cooper 1998; Dean and Hindess 1998; Miller and Rose 1990; \nNeocleous 1996; Rose 1999; Rose and Miller 1992). A few studies have tried \nto develop a general account of the state purportedly8 based on Foucauldian \nperspectives. For example, Giddens treats surveillance as one of four key \ninstitutional clusterings in modern societies that intersect in the nation-state: the \nothers are industrialism, capitalism, and militarism. As surveillance techniques \ndevelop, control can be extended further over time and space, thereby \nenhancing the state's capacities for internal pacification and external military \noperations. In this regard the modern state's control can be distinguished from \nthe local community control and armed intervention found in the traditional \nstate. For its main means of control and punishment are policing, codified law, \nand imprisonment; these are linked in turn to the dominance of exchange \nrelations in production, civilian control of the military, and extended citizenship. \nAn interesting consequence of these changes is that the modern state actually \nresorts less often to violence to control the populace: surveillance and \ndisciplinary normalization do much of the work of regularizing activities in time \nand space (Giddens 1985: 183-92). These ideas are taken further in a recent \nstudy by Dandeker, who offers a typology of states based on surveillance \nmechanisms and the interests they serve (1990: passim). \n \nAssessing Foucault's oeuvre is almost as complicated as deciphering \nGramsci's notebooks. He never codified his work and his views tended to \nchange with each monograph. For present purposes, moreover, careful regard \nmust also be paid to the shift from his attacks on orthodox views of the state \nand power relations to his concern with the role of political discourses and \nstatecraft in the emergence and transformation of the modern state. Taking his \nideas on the ubiquity of power relations, the coupling of power-knowledge, and \ngovernmentality together, however, Foucault offers an important theoretical and \nempirical corrective to the more one-sided and\/or essentialist analyses of \nMarxist state theory and to the taken-for-grantedness of the state which infuses \nneo-statism. But his work remains vulnerable to the charge that it tends to \nreduce power to a universal technique (whether panoptic surveillance or \ndisciplinary normalisation) and to ignore how class and patriarchal relations \nshape both the state and the more general exercise of power. It also neglects \nthe continued importance of law, constitutionalized violence, and bureaucracy \nin the workings of the modern state (cf. Poulantzas 1978). Moreover, whatever \nthe merits of drawing attention to the ubiquity of power, his work provided little \naccount of the bases of resistance (bar an alleged plebeian spirit of revolt). \nAnd, whilst Foucault himself did later re-examine the state and statecraft, \nFoucauldian studies still tend to ignore the complex strategic and structural \ncharacter of the state. They show little interest in the organizational conditions \nthat make it even half-way possible for a state to engage in effective action. At \nthe same time they show little interest in the various limitations on the \ncapacities of even the most well-endowed state. Both issues require a concern \nwith institutional and organizational factors that lie well beyond the typical \nconcepts and assumptions of Foucauldianism. \n \n3) Feminist State Theory \n \nJust as it is a commonplace that Marx and Engels left no coherent account of \nthe state, so too it is often argued that no such theory has been developed by \nfeminism (e.g., MacKinnon 1982; Connell 1990). For, while feminists have \ncertainly elaborated distinctive theories of gender and the gendering of social \nrelations, even where they have been interested in the state, their ideas on its \ngeneral nature and form have often been imported from outside. This \nobservation is not intended to belittle the many powerful feminist critiques of \npolitical (as opposed to state) theory nor to denigrate the many important \nfeminist accounts of particular, gender-relevant aspects of the operation and \nimpact of states. Instead my remark is meant to highlight the difficulties \ninvolved in developing distinctively feminist accounts of the general form and \nfunctions of the state.  \n \nNot all feminists would agree that feminism needs such a theory -- either \nintellectually or politically. Thus Allen has argued that feminists should \nconcentrate on developing concepts appropriate to a feminist theoretical and \npolitical agenda and should reject existing state theories 'with [their] definitions, \nparameters and analytic tasks forged for political positions other than feminism' \n(Allen 1990: 21). In this context she calls on feminists to focus on categories \nsuch as policing, law, medical culture, bureaucratic culture, organized crime, \nfraternalism, paternalism, misogyny, subjectivity, the body, sexuality, men, \nmasculinity, violence, power, pleasure, and so forth, which bear directly on \nfeminist political concerns (Allen 1990: 28). In other cases it is not so much \ntheir purported irrelevance that prompts rejection of existing theories as it is \ntheir malign 'malestream' or, worse yet, their phallocratic, character and their \nresulting debilitating impact on feminist thought and mobilization (e.g., \nMacKinnon 1982, 1983). But other feminists have called on their sisters to \ntheorize the complexities of state power precisely because of their pervasive \nimpact on gender relations. Thus Brown has argued that feminists need to \nanalyze the state because it is so central to many women's issues and so many \nwomen are state dependants (Brown 1992: 7; cf. Franzway et al., 1989: 12-13). \nBut, rather than a single, all-purpose theory which fails to register the real \nstrategic complexity of the state, its discourses, and technologies of power, \nBrown suggests developing insights from different state theories relevant to the \ndifferent faces that the state presents to women.9 \n \nWhere feminists first began to tackle the state as such was in the attempted \nmarriage between feminism and marxism (cf. Mahon 1991; Pringle and Watson \n1992). This was an important current in the 1970s state theory revival and \ntypically involved attempts to graft theories of reproduction and patriarchy onto \nMarxist analyses of production in order to show how patriarchy served \ncapitalism and how the latter depended for its survival on specific social forms \nreproducing labour-power and gender relations as well as specific social \nrelations of production (e.g., McIntosh 1978; Eisenstein 1981). For some time, \nindeed, the dominant approach in feminist state theorizing was Marxist-\nfeminism. It was perhaps for this reason that efforts to develop feminist state \ntheory often adopted methods of theory construction similar to those found in \nMarxist theorizing more generally. Thus we can distinguish three main ways of \nlinking feminist concerns and the state: the methods of subsumption, \nderivation, and articulation. \n \nSome radical feminist theories simply subsumed each and every state under \nthe overarching category of patriarchal domination: whatever their apparent \ndifferences, all states are expressions of patriarchy or phallocracy and so must \nbe opposed. Such arguments either assimilate the state to patriarchy in general \nor identify specific gendering mechanisms of the state itself. For some, \npatriarchy is diffused throughout society, with the state being yet another \ninstitution that treats men and women unequally, adopts the male viewpoint, \nserves and consolidates the interests of men as a sex. Thus the state is just \none more site of male domination over women; at best (or worst) it serves as \nthe 'patriarch general' (Mies 1986: 26). In its more complex versions such an \napproach views the state as a specific form of patriarchal or phallocratic \ndomination with its own determinate (and distinctive) effects on gender \nrelations. Thus it engenders power relations in specific ways, through its own \npatriarchal strategic selectivity, capacities, and needs.10 However, insofar as it \nis patriarchy that defines the core of the state and all else is treated as \nunimportant, these views are still subsumptionist (for critiques of early feminist \nstate theories, see: Allen 1990: 26-7; Anthias and Yuval-Davis 1989; Connell \n1990: 516-17; Pringle and Watson 1992: 62-3). \n \nOther feminists tried to derive the necessary form and\/or functions of the \npatriarchal state from the imperatives of reproduction (rather than production), \nfrom the changing forms of patriarchal domination, or the nature of the \n'domestic' mode of production, etc.. Such work suffers from similar theoretical \nproblems as the Marxist derivation debate, namely, the assumption that form \nnecessarily follows function and the consequent denial of any real autonomy or \ncontingency to the state. In some cases this simply provides a feminist variation \non economism, in others we find a more elaborate version of subsumptionism \nwhich defines all too well the mechanisms guaranteeing the state's patriarchal \ncharacter (cf. criticisms in Jenson 1986; Walby 1990).  \n \nOthers again try to analyze the contingent articulation of patriarchal and \ncapitalist forms of domination as crystallized in the state. The best work in this \nfield confirms the importance of the articulation method: for it shows that \npatriarchal and gender relations make a difference to the state at the same time \nas refusing to prejudge the form and effects of this difference. In other words, \n'acknowledging that gender inequality exists does not automatically imply that \nevery capitalist state is involved in the reproduction of that inequality in the \nsame ways or to the same extent' (Jenson 1986: 10; cf. Brenner and Laslett \n1991; Hernes 1987). The same sort of approach also reveals the importance of \ndifferences among women as well as between gender groups and this is an \nimportant corrective to extreme forms of gender essentialism. Indeed there is \nnow an extensive literature on the complex and variable forms of articulation of \nclass, gender, and ethnicity in particular state structures and policy areas (e.g., \nBoris 1995; Sainsbury 1994; Williams 1995). This 'intersectional' approach has \nbeen taken further still by third wave feminists and queer theorists, who have \nemphasized the instability and socially constructed arbitrariness of dominant \nviews of sexual and gender identities and have shown the wide variability of \nmasculine as well as feminine identities and interests (on third wave feminism, \nsee Butler 1990; Fraser 1997; Ferree et al., 1999; Randall and Waylen 1998; \nYuval-Davis 1997; and, for a useful introduction to queer theory, Dugan 1994). \nThus there is growing interest in the constitution of competing, inconsistent, \nand even openly contradictory identities for both males and females, their \ngrounding in discourses about masculinity and\/or feminity, their explicit or \nimplicit embedding in different institutions and material practices,11 and their \nphysico-cultural materialization in human bodies. This has created the \ntheoretical space for a recent revival of explicit interest in gender and the state, \nwhich has made major contributions across a broad range of issues \u2013 including \nhow specific constructions of masculinity and feminity, their associated gender \nidentities, interests, roles, and bodily forms come to be privileged in the state's \nown discourses, institutions, and material practices. Such studies rule out any \nanalysis of the state as a simple expression of patriarchal domination and also \ncast doubt on the very utility of \"patriarchy\" as an analytical category. \n \nThe best feminist scholarship on state theory has profound implications. For it \ncasts doubt on key assumptions of much 'malestream' work. Firstly, it is a \ncommonplace that the modern state claims a legitimate monopoly over the \nmeans of coercion. Feminists often attack this conventional approach because \nmen can get away with violence (not to say murder) against women within the \nconfines of the family and, through the reality, threat, or fear of rape, also \noppress women in public spaces. This suggests that the orthodoxy relates to \nthe separation of coercion from the organization of production (exploitation \ntakes the form of exchange, dictatorship takes the form of democracy)12 and \nthe centralization of publicly organized power rather than to the exercise of \nparental or patriarchal coercion in the family over women and children. Even so \nfeminists might well add that this rational-legal legitimation of state coercion is \njust the public form assumed by masculine violence and is actually used to \nsupport its private expression within the family and civil society. \n \nSuch arguments have been taken further in recent work on different forms of \nmasculinity and the state (Connell 1995, 1996). This last point bears on a \nsecond crucial contribution of feminist theorizing: its critique of the juridical \ndistinction between 'public' and 'private'. For, not only does this distinction \nserve to obfuscate class relations (as Marxists have argued), it also, and \nperhaps even more fundamentally, operates to hide a key mechanism of male \ndomination. Thus, whilst Marxists suggest that the rise of the liberal bourgeois \nstate and its attendant split between public citizen and private individual is \ngrounded in the development of capitalism, feminists would interpret it as the \nproduct of the patriarchal ordering of the bourgeois state (Eisenstein 1981). \nWhilst Marxists tend to equate the public sphere with the state and the private \nsphere with private property, exchange, and individual rights, feminists tend to \nequate the former both with the state and civil society, the latter with the \ndomestic sphere and women's alleged place in the 'natural' order of \nreproduction. Men and women are differentially located in the public and private \nspheres: indeed, historically, women have been excluded from the public \nsphere and subordinated to men in the private. Yet men's independence both \nas citizens and as workers is premised on women's role in caring for them at \nhome (Pateman 1989: 120, 123, 203). Moreover, even where women have won \nfull citizenship rights, their continuing oppression and subjugation in the private \nsphere hinders their exercise and enjoyment of these rights (Siim 1988: 163).13 \nNot only is the distinction between 'public' and 'private' political, then, but the \nvery organization of the 'private' sphere itself has major implications for the \nstrategic selectivity of the state. \n A third area of feminist criticism focuses on the links between warfare, \nmasculinity, and the state. In general terms, as Connell notes, 'the state arms \nmen and disarms women' (Connell 1987: 126; cf. Elshtain 1987). At its most \nextreme, this criticism involves concepts such as the 'sado-state' (Daly 1984), \nthe suggestion that the military apparatus is a simple expression of male \naggression and destructiveness, or the view that militarism and imperialism are \nexpressions of a cult of violent masculinity (Fernbach 1981). Thus Lloyd notes \nthat 'the masculinity of citizenship and the masculinity of war have been \nconceptually connected in Western thought' (1986: 64). More nuanced \nhistorical accounts have shown how state legitimacy is structured in terms of \nmasculinity: whilst the ancien regime being organized around notions of \npersonal and family honour, patronage, and military prowess, for example, the \nmodern state rests on ideas of rationality, calculation, orderliness, hierarchy, \nand informal masculine codes and networks (Landes 1988; Connell 1990: 521; \non modern bureaucracies, whether public or private, Ferguson 1984; and, more \ngenerally on different forms of masculinity, Connell 1995, 1996). \n \nThree broad positions could be adopted by non-feminists to feminist work: a) \ndismiss it as wholly irrelevant; b) accept it as a more or less important \nsupplement to the core contributions of some other account; or c) welcome it as \na fundamental challenge to the received wisdom. The first position is \nuntenable. For, as the second view suggests, feminist research shows that \nother theories have missed or marginalized key aspects of the state's form and \nfunctions and has also provided new examples of how form problematizes \nfunction and creates specific contradictions, dilemmas, and conflicts. This holds \nnot only for conventional Marxist and neo-statist approaches, for example, but \nalso for the study of international relations (e.g., Enloe 1983, 2000; Peterson, \n1992; Sylvester 1994) and the recent interest in Foucauldian analyses (for \ncritical feminist appropriations of the latter, see, for example, McNay 1992; \nCooper 1995; Fraser 1988; Martin 1982; Ramazanoglu 1993; Sawacki 1991). \nMoreover, in line with the third view, some feminist research has revealed basic \nflaws in much malestream theorizing. Thus an adequate account of the \nstrategic complexity of the state must include the key feminist insights into the \ngendered nature of the state's structural selectivity and capacities for action as \nwell as its key role in reproducing specific patterns of gender relations (for \nattempts to develop such a strategic-relational approach, see Jessop 1997a, \n2001).  \n \n4) Discourse-Analysis and Stateless State Theory \n \nTo read some recent discourse-analytic work might easily lead one to believe \nthat the best kept of all official secrets is the fact that the state does not exist.14 \nInstead it is an illusion: a product of the political imaginary. Its emergence \ndepends on the prevalence of state discourses. The state appears on the \npolitical scene because political forces orient their actions towards the 'state', \nacting as if it existed. But, since there is no common discourse of the state (at \nmost there is a dominant or hegemonic discourse) and different political forces \norient their action at different times to different ideas of the state, it is evident \nthat the state is at best a polyvalent, polycontextual phenomenon which \nchanges shape and appearance with the political forces acting towards it and \nthe circumstances in which they do so. This apparently heretical idea has been \nadvanced from various theoretical or analytical viewpoints and the following \nparagraphs offer four examples. \n \nFirstly, following a review of Marxist and other attempts to define the state as a \ndistinct material entity, agent, function, or political relation, Abrams noted that \nsuch attempts only create difficulties. He recommended abandoning the state \nas a material object of study. For the institutional ensemble which comprises \ngovernment can be studied without resorting to the concept of the state; and \nthe 'idea of the state' can be studied in turn as the distinctive collective (mis-) \nrepresentation of capitalist societies which serves to mask the true nature of \npolitical practice (Abrams 1977\/1988). Political systems theorists have often \ncondemned the conceptual morass and vapid debates that accompany state \ntheorizing (e.g., Easton 1981). But Abrams's position is both more positive and \nmore negative because he sees a constitutive role for the 'state idea' in both \nshaping and disguising political domination. In turn this calls for a historical \nanalysis of the 'cultural revolution' (or ideological shifts) involved when state \nsystems are transformed (cf. Corrigan and Sayer 1985). \n \nSecondly, Melossi makes a similar claim. He urges a 'stateless theory of the \nstate', i.e., recognition that the state is just a juridical concept, an idea which \nenables people to do the state, to furnish themselves and others with reasons \nand grounds for their own actions. As such it can be used reflexively by many \ndifferent types of official to provide a vocabulary of motives for their (in)actions \nand to account for the unity of the state in a divided and unequal civil society \n(Melossi 1990: 2, 6, 150). In turn this implies that state autonomy should not be \nseen as a reified property of a reified state; instead it varies with the degree of \nautonomy with which governmental elites see themselves endowed in specific \nplaces at particular times (Melossi 1990: 128; cf. Watson 1990: 7). \n \nThird, in addition to general ideological demystification and an emphasis on the \nself-reflexive use of the state idea, we can find an increasing interest in specific \nnarrative, rhetorical, or argumentative features of state power. This is reflected \nin various case studies of policy-making which suggest that state policies do \nnot so much objectively represent the interests located in or beyond the state or \nobjectively reflect 'real' problems in the internal or external environments of the \npolitical system as they are discursively-mediated, if not wholly discursively-\nconstituted, products of struggles to define and narrate 'problems' which can be \ndealt with in and through state action. In this sense the effectivity of policy-\nmaking is closely tied to its rhetorical and argumentative framing -- especially \nas effectivity, like beauty, often exists only in the eyes (or ears) of the beholder \n(see, for example, Fischer and Forester 1993; Roe 1994). In addition to \ndetailed domestic policy studies along these lines, there have been some \nimportant contributions from within 'critical geo-politics' regarding key \ninternational dimensions of state -- especially discourses of sovereignty, the \nchanging nature of 'security' and threats thereto, and the remaking of the \nterritorial boundaries of states (see, for example, Bartelson 1995; Campbell \n1992; Luke 1994; O Tuathail 1996; O Tuathail and Luke 1994; Walker 1993). \n \nFourthly, autopoietic theorists have advanced the idea that the 'state' is simply \na self-description or internal model of the political system.15 The key feature of \nautopoietic systems is their radical operational autonomy. This derives from \ntheir power to determine their own operational codes and programmes and to \nreproduce (or transform) themselves despite attempts at control from outside \nand\/or other perturbing influences in their environment.  One such system is \nthe modern economy as a self-organizing system of payments (cf. marxists on \nthe self-valorization of capital). Two others are the legal system (a self-\ncontained and self-modifying system of legally binding legal decisions) and the \npolitical system (a circuit of power passing among governors and governed and \nproducing decisions that are binding on all participants). Since power \ncontinually circulates through the political system, it is wrong to reify the state \nby treating it as a distinct entity with its own power and resources. Certainly the \ncentrifugal dynamic of functionally differentiated modern societies means that \nthe state is no longer able to play the superordinate role attributed to it in early \nmodern political theory (Willke 1986). It is best understood as the means \nthrough which participants simplify problems of political action by polarizing \nthem around the issue of government and opposition. And the polity in turn \nshould be seen as one system among others in a polycentric, fundamentally \nanarchic society. Neither it nor the 'state' is superordinate or sovereign. Instead \nthey are the means through which society is supplied with legitimate and \nbinding decisions about collective goods. These include internal and external \nsecurity (with the infrastructural power to secure this collective good being \nbased on organized violence); economic and social security (with a key role for \ngovernment-controlled fiscal and financial resources); and, most recently, \ntechnological and \necological security (where infrastructural capacities are based on collectively \norganized knowledge). Each of these forms of security corresponds to \ndistinctive political projects and forms of intervention. Thus the contemporary \npolity is particularly concerned with how best to 'guide' other functional systems \nwithout attempting direct (and fruitless) intervention into their operations. This is \nsaid to be best achieved by defining the parameters within which they operate, \ngenerating knowledge about the unintended external consequences of their \nactivities, and seeking to build consensus on social projects (see: Luhmann \n1990; Teubner 1993; and, most importantly in this context, Willke 1992, 1996; \non changing state capacities and knowledge, see also Wagner 1989 and \nWittrock 1989). \n \nThus, in all four cases, we find rejection of the reification of the state combined \nwith an attempt to theorize the critical role of the idea of the state and its \nassociated narrative and rhetorical practices in the operation of the political \nsystem and\/or wider society. This role is variously defined as mystification, self-\nmotivation, pure narrativity, or self-description but, regardless of standpoint, \ndiscourses about the state have a key constitutive role in shaping the state as a \ncomplex ensemble of political relations linked to society as a whole. This \napproach contrasts markedly with the reification of the state-society distinction \nin state-centred theorizing. It also offers a different slant on the Foucauldian \nrejection of orthodox accounts of the state by highlighting the functions of such \naccounts within the political system. And, in relation to autopoietic theorizing at \nleast, it provides additional, systems-theoretical reasons for disputing that the \nmodern state could ever be a superordinate, sovereign authority standing \nabove society and controlling it from outside. I explore more fully the \nimplications of such 'stateless' theorizing about the state in the concluding \nsection of my paper. \n \nIII - New Directions of Research \n \nNotwithstanding a declining interest in the more esoteric and abstract modes of \ntheorizing about the state, substantive research on states and state power has \nenjoyed an explosive growth in recent years. It is impossible to review even a \nsmall fraction of the resulting literature. But it is worth mentioning five themes \nthat seem to have attracted considerable attention from various perspectives \nand might well offer a useful point of confrontation between the different \ntheoretical approaches outlined above. These are the historical variability of \nstatehood (or stateness); the relative strength or weakness of states; the future \nof the national state in an alleged era of globalization and regionalization; \nissues of scale, space, territoriality, and the state; and the rise of governance \nmechanisms and their articulation with government. None of these issues can \nbe addressed without moving away from the sort of abstract theorizing that \ncharacterized early stages in the rediscovery of the state and all five pose the \nsort of theoretical and empirical problems which only well-developed and \nsophisticated theoretical frameworks could ever hope to decipher. \n \nFirst, interest in stateness has been prompted both by growing disquiet about \nthe abstract character of much state theory (especially its assumption of a \nubiquitous, unified, sovereign state) and by an increasing interest in the \nhistorical variability of actual states. This has led some theorists to focus on the \nstate as a conceptual variable and to examine the varied presence of the idea \nof the state (Nettl 1968; Dyson 1982; Melossi 1990). Others have examined the \nstate's differential presence as a distinctive political form. Thus Badie and \nBirnbaum usefully distinguish between the political centre required in any \ncomplex  social division of labour and the state as but one possible  institutional \nlocus of this centre. For them, the defining features of the state are its structural \ndifferentiation, autonomy, universalism, and institutional solidity. They see \nFrance as having the archetypal state in a centralized society; Britain has a \npolitical centre but no state; Germany has a state but no centre; and the \nHelvetian Confederation (Switzerland) has no state and no centre (Badie and \nBirnbaum 1983). Such approaches are important because they historicize the \nstate idea and stress the wide variety of its institutional forms. A growing \nnumber of studies have explored these issues on all territorial or scales from \nthe local to the international with considerable concern for meso-level variation. \n \nSecond, if stateness as a variable concerns the institutionalization of the state \nas such, interest in strong and weak states concerns the factors that make for \nstate strength. This can be interpreted in two ways: internally it refers to a \nstate's capacities to exercise authority over society, externally it refers to the \nstate's power in the international community of states (on the latter, see \nespecially Handel 1990). This concern is often linked with interest in the state's \ncapacity to penetrate and organize the rest of society. It is especially marked in \nrecent theoretical and empirical work on predatory and\/or developmental \nstates. Whereas the predatory state is essentially parasitic upon its economy \nand civil society, the developmental state has proved itself capable of \ndeveloping one or both of them. Whereas predatory states have a significant \nmeasure of despotic power, developmental states enjoy a balance of despotic \npower and infrastructural power and wield it in market-conforming ways (e.g., \nCastells 1992; Evans 1985, 1995; Johnson 1987; Levi 1988; Weiss 1998; \nWeiss and Hobson 1995). One problem with much of this literature is that it \nuses a blanket contrast between strong and weak states. In addition there is a \nwide variety of different interpretations of strength (and weakness) which \nfurther threatens coherent analysis.16 Most seriously, some of the literature \nruns the risk of tautology to the extent that strength is defined purely in terms of \noutcomes (for reviews, see Clark and Lemco 1988; Lauridsen 1991; Migdal \n1988; \u00d6nis 1991; Waldner 1999). A possible solution is to allow for more \nvariability in state capacities by policy area, over time, and in specific \nconjunctures. This in turn calls for a 'strategic-relational' approach (see below).  \n \nThird, recent work on globalization has increasingly called into question the \nfuture of the national state. This issue was already posed, of course, during \nearlier debates on the internationalization of finance and the activities of \nmultinational firms. It has become more pressing with the emergence of the \ntriadic economic blocs (North America, Europe, and East Asia), development of \ncross-border regional cooperation, and the re-emergence or re-discovery of \ncities, regions, and industrial districts as major bases of (international) \ncompetitiveness. Fourth, and closely linked to the previous issue, is the \nproblem of the changing scale of politics. While some theorists are inclined to \nsee the crisis of the national state as displacing the primary scale of political \norganization and action to either the global or the regional scale, others \nsuggest that there has been a relativization of scale. For, whereas the national \nstate provided the primary scale of political organization in the economic space \nand period of Atlantic Fordism, the current after-Fordist period is characterized \nby a marked dispersion of political and policy issues across different scales of \norganization, with none of them obviously primary. This in turn poses \nparticularly difficult problems about securing the coherence of action across \ndifferent scales (for different approaches to both issues, see Brenner 1999; \nCaporaso 1996; Evers 1994; Hirst and Thompson 1995; Jessop 1999; Mann \n1993; Scharpf 1999; Schmitter 1992; Taylor 1995; Z\u00fcrn 1992; Ziebura 1992).  \n \nFinally, if the period of Atlantic Fordism was largely dominated by concerns \nabout the relationship between state and market, the current theoretical and \nempirical agenda is much concerned with 'governance'. This concerns forms of \ncoordination or concertation that rely neither on governmental hierarchies nor \non the anarchy of the market but are characterized by self-organization. \nGovernance is emerging on different scales of organization (ranging from the \nexpansion of international and supra-national regimes through national and \nregional public-private partnerships to more localized networks of power and \ndecision-making. Although this trend is often taken to imply a diminution in \nstate capacities, it has also been seen as enhancing its power to secure its \ninterests and, indeed, as providing states with a new (or expanded) role in the \nmeta-governance (or overall coordination) of different governance regimes and \nmechanisms (on governance, see, for example, Jessop 1995; Kitschelt 1991; \nKooiman 1993; Messner 1998; Pierre 1999; Scharpf, 1999; Streeck and \nSchmitter 1985). \n \n \n \n \nIV -- An Emerging Agenda? \n \nRecent state theorizing and state research are much more diverse than that \nwhich occurred during the 1970s. Yet the different currents reviewed above \noften seem to have followed a similar trajectory or learning curve to that \npursued by the Marxist debate. The latter originated in a critique of the alleged \nreformist illusions of social democratic and\/or pluralist accounts of the state and \nwas concerned to show why the state in a capitalist society was also and \nnecessarily a capitalist state. It was later forced into growing recognition of the \ncontingency of state forms and regimes and the variation in state capacities \nand performance. And this in turn encouraged the abandonment of highly \nabstract theorizing with its premature closure of many issues and shifted the \nanalysis to more concrete, institutional levels. This emphasis on contingency \nhelps to explain the development of the two insights noted in section one: that \nform problematizes function and that the state is an institutional ensemble that \nhas variable structural selectivity and strategic capacities.  \n \nOther currents discussed here have encountered similar problems -- most \nnotably feminist state theories. These have also shown increasing interest in \nwhat one can call the strategically selective gendering of the state and its \nstructural coupling with other institutional orders in society (see also Jessop \n2001). And, on a more practical level, feminists have discovered some of the \nproblems involved in working both in and against the gendered state (e.g., \nConnell 1990; Watson 1990). Likewise, despite its disposition to reify the state-\nsociety distinction, state-centred theorizing has always emphasized the \ndifference that specific regimes make to the nature and impact of the political \nprocess. Moreover, even if Foucauldian analyses have always shown less \ninterest in more abstract structural properties of the state, they have been very \nsensitive to the constitutive role of political practices and statecraft in shaping \nregimes and their governmental capacities (see, for example, the contributions \nin Gordon 1991). In addition, autopoietic theory, having initially reduced the \nstate to little more than a self-description of the political system, has more \nrecently come to stress the variability of its infrastructural capacities, the \nproblematic relationship between its radical operational autonomy and the \nsystematic interdependence of different institutional orders, and the 'ironic'17 \nrole of political discourse in guiding social evolution (cf. Willke 1992). \nConversely, it remains an enduring weakness of purely discourse-analytic \nresearch on the state that it lacks the conceptual apparatus to comprehend the \nstructural selectivity of the state system or the variability of the state's \ncapacities and vulnerabilities (see further: Jessop 1990). In short, with all due \nrecognition of the obvious differences between the different theoretical \napproaches reviewed above, it is nonetheless possible to identify a remarkable \nconvergence on a small and significant set of themes grounded in the growing \nrecognition of the contingency of the state apparatus and state power.18  \n \nIn identifying these themes and spelling them out we can also identify a useful \nresearch agenda for a third generation of state theorizing. This exercise is \ncertainly not intended to exclude alternative agendas nor prejudge the results \nof the next round of debate (for an alternative agenda, for example, see Smith \n2000). In noting areas of convergence as well as divergence, however, it may \nserve to highlight critical theoretical issues and research topics that may help to \nresolve disputes among different approaches. \n \nFirstly, all these approaches seem to agree in dethroning the state from its \nsuperordinate position within society and analyzing it simply as one institutional \norder among others. Marxists no longer treat it as the ideal collective capitalist; \nneo-statists no longer treat it as a sovereign legal subject; it has been \ndeconstructed by Foucauldians; feminists no longer view it simply as the \npatriarch general; and discourse analysts and autopoieticists alike see it as \nconstituted, ironically or otherwise, through contingent discursive or \ncommunicative practices. In short, the state is seen as an emergent, partial, \nand unstable system that is interdependent with other systems in a complex \nsocial order. This has vastly expanded the realm of contingency in the state \nand its operations and this implies the need for more concrete, historically \nspecific, institutionally sensitive, and action-oriented research. All of the \ntheoretical schools discussed above are concerned in their different ways to \nprovide such analyses. Such concerns are also shaping the growing body of \nsubstantive research into stateness and the relative strength (and weakness) of \nparticular political regimes. All of this marks an important general advance on \nthe loose talk which equates the state to a simple thing or subject and\/or fails to \nconsider its variability as a complex social relation within (let alone across) \ngiven social formations. \n \nFor, fourthly, these structural powers and capacities cannot be understood by \nfocusing on the state alone. For the state should be analyzed in a 'strategic-\nrelational' context (cf. Bertramsen et al., 1990). By virtue of its structural \nselectivity and always specific strategic capacities, its powers will always be \nconditional or relational. Their realization depends on the structural ties \nbetween the state and its encompassing political system, the strategic links \namong state managers and other political forces, and the complex web of \ninterdependencies and social networks linking the state and political system to \nits broader environment.  It is here that neo-statism often proves weak due to \nits tendency to reify the state-society distinction and that discourse-analytic \nwork often misses the deep-rooted, extra-discursive structural conditions that \nshape the effectiveness of state power. But the other approaches considered in \nthis article would find few difficulties in subscribing to this theme.  \n \nThis suggests, finally, that an adequate theory of the state can only be \nproduced as part of a wider theory of society. Even the neo-statists' principled \nrejection of a society-centred approach draws on arguments about the wider \nsociety both to reveal the state's distinctive logic and interests and to explore \nthe conditions for its autonomy and effectiveness. Foucauldian, feminist, and \ndiscourse-analytic studies are even more clearly oriented to wider concerns: \nFoucault starts from a socially dispersed micro-physics of power, feminism is \nconcerned with gender relations, and stateless state theory begins from the \ndiscursive constitution of the state. Recent Marxist work also continues, of \ncourse, to relate the state to capitalism and the anatomy of civil society. This \ninvolves an important redirection of work on the state and state power. But it is \nprecisely on this terrain that many of the unresolved problems of state theory \nare located. For the state is the site of a paradox. On the one hand, it is just \none institutional ensemble among others within a social formation; on the other, \nit is peculiarly charged with overall responsibility for maintaining the cohesion of \nthe social formation of which it is a part. Its paradoxical position as both part \nand whole of society means that it is continually called upon by diverse social \nforces to resolve society's problems and is equally continually doomed to \ngenerate 'state failure' since so many of society's problems lie well beyond its \ncontrol and can even be aggravated by attempted intervention. Many of the \ndifferences between theories of the state considered above are rooted in \ncontrary approaches to various structural and strategic moments of this \nparadox. Trying to comprehend the overall logic (or, perhaps, 'illogic') of this \nparadox may well be the best route to resolving some of these differences as \nwell as providing a more comprehensive analysis of the strategic-relational \ncharacter of the state in a polycentric social formation. \n                                            \nEndnotes \n \n1 This is a lightly revised version of a paper presented at the International \nPolitical Science Association Conference, Quebec City, 1st-5th August 2000. \nThe latter in turn is a revised and updated version of a review of state theory \nthat appeared in Danish (Jessop 1998). Different versions have benefited from \nthe comments of Colin Hay, Paul Reynolds, and Ngai-Ling Sum. \n2 For useful reviews of such Marxist theorizing, see Barrow 1993; Jessop 1977; \nCarnoy 1984; Chandhoke 1995; Clarke 1990; Altvater and Hoffman 1990; \nThomas 1994; and, on Marxist-feminism, Mahon 1991; Burstyn 1983. \n3 On critical theory and the state, see Horkheimer 1942\/1973; Kirchheimer \n1969; Neumann 1964. For an accessible introduction to the Frankfurt School, \nsee Held 1980. \n                                                                                                                               \n4 For various criticisms of these positions, see: Carnoy 1984; Jessop 1977, \n1982, 1990; Offe 1972; Poulantzas 1978. \n5 As we shall see below, it is no accident that these are all male thinkers. \n6 Even Weber's work can be interpreted differently: it has been invoked, for \nexample, to show that the state does not exist but is a reflexive use of ideas to \nenhance the legitimacy of a ruling elite (Melossi 1990: 63-5). \n7 In my earlier critique of neo-statism, only four of these were listed (see Jessop \n1990); the fifth set of charges, listed second here, is just as important. \n8 For a critique of the Foucauldian pretensions of Giddens, see Boyne (1991). \n9 There are four such faces: (a) juridical-legislative or liberal (a proper focus for \nfeminist jurisprudence); (b) capitalist -- property rights and capitalism; (c) \nprerogative -- legitimate arbitrary power marking the state as a state (police, \nmilitary, security); and (d) bureaucratic (Brown 1992: 13-14). \n10 MacKinnon's position is ambivalent in this regard: she treats law as \npatriarchal because it is gender-blind and gender interests themselves are \npregiven (1983). \n11 In distinguishing between discourses, institutions, and material practices, I \nam not trying to deny the materiality of discourses nor suggesting that \ninstitutions or material practices are non-discursive. I am simply noting that not \nall discourses are translated into institutions and material practices with \nemergent properties that are irreducible to the content of these discourses.  \n12  This pithy statement comes from Moore (1957). \n13 Feminists usually criticize the oppressive effects of the public-private split; \nbut Elshtain has argued that women who go public must sacrifice the maternal \nvalues that are rooted in family life (1981). \n14 This is suggested, for example, in Abrams 1977\/1988: 77. \n15 It is impossible to give an adequate account of autopoietic systems theory in \nthis article: for introductions, see Luhmann (1995) and Jessop (1990). \n16 Thus states have been described as strong because there have a large \npublic sector, authoritarian rule, strong societal support, a weak and gelatinous \n                                                                                                                               \ncivil society, cohesive bureaucracies, an interventionist policy, or the power to \nlimit external interference (cf. Lauridsen 1991: 117). \n17 It is ironic in the Rortyian sense of political commitment aware of its own \ncontingency and likely future alteration: see Rorty 1989 and Willke 1992. \n18 I first identified these themes in my book on State Theory (1990). There is \nclearly a danger in reading other theoretical trajectories in terms of such a \nconvergence but, with all due caution, it does seem that the following themes \nare increasingly widespread and are informing current research on the state. \n \n \n \nBibliography \n \nAbrams, P.
