From existing observational\nevidence2,3 on high-redshift galaxies, it is unclear whether such outflows are localized to regions of\nintense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whether they instead have a significant\nimpact on the entire galaxy and its surroundings. Here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of\na star-forming galaxy4 at redshift z=3.09 (seen 11.5 gigayears ago, when the Universe was 20 per\ncent of its current age): its spatially extended Ly\u03b1 line emission appears to be absorbed by HI in a\nforeground screen covering the entire galaxy, with a lateral extent of at least 100kpc and remarkable\nvelocity coherence. It was plausibly ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 108 years\nearlier and has subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and cooled.\nThis demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds.\nThe formation of galaxies requires gas to cool in haloes\nof dark matter that collapse under gravity from the expan-\nsion of the Universe. However, cooling alone overproduces\nbright galaxies at the present day, so models incorporate\nthermal conduction, photoionization and galaxy merg-\ning, together with additional \u2018feedback\u20191 in the form of\ngalactic-scale outflows. The latter are powered by super-\nnovae and massive stellar winds, or by relativistic winds\nand jets resulting from gas accretion onto supermassive\nblack holes. Although starburst superwinds have been\nstudied5 in local dwarf galaxies (such as M82), observa-\ntional evidence for their counterparts in young massive\ngalaxies at high redshift has been less direct.\nIn Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) \u2013 high-redshift galax-\nies with moderate masses and star-formation rates \u2013 spec-\ntroscopic evidence points to powerful outflows2,3 of inter-\nstellar gas, with absorption lines being blueshifted by sev-\neral hundred kilometres per second from the galaxy\u2019s sys-\ntemic velocity. The gravitationally lensed LBG MS1512-\ncB58 at redshift z=2.73 is a clear example3: absorbing\ngas is outflowing at \u223c 255 km s\u22121 at a rate exceeding the\nstar-formation rate, and although it covers the entire star-\nforming region, this shows only that the radius of any shell\nexceeds \u223c 1 kpc; it is not known whether the outflows\nare collimated and localized to star-forming regions, or\nwhether they are galaxy-wide. The latter is suggested by\nthe observed decrease in the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nHI opacity in background quasar sightlines that are close\nin projection to LBGs6 (within 0.7 Mpc co-moving). This\nmay indicate that LBGs drive superwinds at\u223c 600 km s\u22121\nfor several 108 yr, or it might be a statistical fluctuation\nsince there are few LBG-quasar pairs at the smallest sep-\narations.\nTo characterize such outflows better via absorption\nstudies, a background light source is needed with a spa-\ntial extent somewhat larger than an LBG stellar body\nor a quasar sightline. Such a source is provided by the\nrecently discovered Ly\u03b1-emitting blobs (hereafter LABs),\nassociated with LBGs in the SSA22 protocluster at red-\nshift z=3.09, a structure which is likely to evolve into\na rich cluster of galaxies. With sizes \u223c 100 kpc and\nLy\u03b1 luminosities \u223c 1044 erg s\u22121, the LABs resemble the\nemission-line haloes of high-redshift radio galaxies, but\ntheir radio emission is much fainter than in typical high-\nredshift radio galaxies7. Models for LAB Ly\u03b1 emission in-\nclude superwind ejecta8 and cooling radiation from grav-\nitationally heated gas9. Both LABs are submillimetre\nsources10, with LAB-1 the more powerful and consistent\nwith \u223c 1000 M\u2299 yr\n\u22121 of star formation. LAB-2 has an\nX-ray detection, suggestive of an obscured active galactic\nnucleus11, whereas LAB-1 does not.\nWe recently observed the LAB Ly\u03b1 haloes using\nintegral-field spectroscopy, which, unlike conventional slit\nspectroscopy, gathers spatially resolved spectra over a\ntwo-dimensional area. Such information is essential for\na complete picture of morphologically complex objects\n2Figure 1.

The absorption feature, interpreted as due to\nforeground HI, in indicated. A data cube is a three-dimensional\nstructure for spectroscopic data from integral field spectro-\ngraphs. Here the long axis corresponds to the dispersion axis\nand the other two axes represent spatial dimensions on the\nsky, that is, the data cube stores a spectrum for each point in\na two-dimensional region of sky. With visualization software,\nthe data-cube representation can provide useful qualitative in-\nsights into complex data sets. \u03bb, wavelength.\nlike the LABs. We used the SAURON Integral Field\nSpectrograph12 on the William Herschel Telescope, pro-\nviding moderate resolution spectroscopy (\u223c 4A\u02da full-width\nat half-maximum, FWHM) over a 41 \u00d7 31 arcsec area,\nsampled with 0.95-arcsec lenslets. LAB-2 was observed\nfor 15 h (in thirty 30-min sub-exposures), but unlike LAB-\n113 exhibits simple structure in Ly\u03b1. At most positions\nthe emission line is double-peaked, as shown in Fig. 1\nand in the line profiles of individual regions (Figs. 2\nand 3). The position of the profiles central minimum\nvaries across the galaxy by less than 60 km s\u22121 in its\nrest-frame. The observing strategy of dithering between\nsub-exposures ensures that this feature is not a charge-\ncoupled device (CCD) detector defect, nor is it due to a\nnight-sky emission feature. The simplest interpretation\nis that part of the Ly\u03b1 emission is scattered out of our\nline of sight by neutral hydrogen in a coherent foreground\nscreen.\nThe line profiles were each modelled with a gaussian\nemission line and a superimposed Voigt profile absorber\n(all convolved with the instrumental response), as in Fig.\n3. The HI column densities are NHI \u223c 10\n19 cm\u22122, and the\nrelative amplitudes of the red and blue line wings reflect\nvelocity differences between the emission and absorption\ncomponents. The absorber is typically blueshifted from\nthe underlying peak by less than 250 km s\u22121; the emis-\nsion shows a range in absolute velocity of \u223c 290 km s\u22121,\nwith individual linewidths of \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 FWHM.

A reconstructed image of the z=3.09 galaxy LAB-2\nin the Ly\u03b1 emission line. This shows the extent of its gaseous\nhalo (10 arcsec on the sky equates to a physical distance\nof 76 kpc in this galaxy with the cosmological parameters\nH0 = 70 km s\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121, \u2126M = 0.3 and \u2126\u039b = 0.7). The im-\nage was derived from observations with the SAURON integral\nfield spectrograph, by collapsing the data cube shown in Fig.\n1 along the wavelength direction. The labels indicate regions\nfor which one-dimensional Ly\u03b1 emission line profiles have been\nextracted, as shown in Fig. 3. The underlying Ly\u03b1 emission is\nlikely to be from gas in the halo of the associated Lyman-break\ngalaxy4 (at position C), arising from a combination of super-\nwind ejecta8, cooling radiation9, and gas photoionized by the\nobscured active nucleus11.\nposition B, no absorber is detected, perhaps because the\nunderlying emission is more blueshifted than elsewhere.\nAn absorbing shell is predicted to form when a\nstarburst-heated hot gas bubble becomes over-pressurized\nrelative to the interstellar medium and hence breaks out\nof the galactic disk, accelerates, and fragments as a re-\nsult of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Hot gas then es-\ncapes into the halo and forms a second shell of swept-up\nIGM. Evolutionary models for the Ly\u03b1 emission from such\nsuperwinds14 \u2013 which are consistent with Hubble Space\nTelescope observations of local starburst galaxies15 \u2013 sug-\ngest that the LAB-2 absorber is in a late phase, where\nthe shell has cooled and slowed sufficiently to absorb the\nunderlying emission. Figure 4 illustrates the model.\nBecause the absorbing shell\u2019s transverse extent is at\nleast 100 kpc, it is probably a comparable distance in front\nof the Ly\u03b1 source (although the constant absorber velocity\nimplies that, if spherical, the radius must be considerably\nlarger). At a velocity of 1000 km s\u22121, it takes 108 yr to\n34950 5000\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n4950 5000 4950 5000\nFigure 3. Ly\u03b1 emission line profiles across the galaxy LAB-2\nat z=3.09. A profile is shown for each region labelled in Fig.\n2. Thick solid lines are fits to a model where the intrinsic Ly\u03b1\nemission (dashed lines) is partially absorbed by foreground HI.\nThe measured HI column densities are \u223c 1019 cm\u22122, although\nthe modest spectral resolution implies 1\u03c3 uncertainties of at\nleast a factor of \u223c 10, so the column density may not be\nuniform across the galaxy. The widths of the absorbers (ex-\npressed as the gaussian b-parameter in the Voigt profile) are\n\u223c 20 km s\u22121, which for thermal broadening implies a kinetic\ntemperature \u223c 104 K (as expected on photoionization grounds\nand consistent with the lack of bulk motion across the shell).\nNote, however, that similar Ly\u03b1 profiles can result from a Ly\u03b1\nsource in an HI slab of much higher optical depth19; the twin\npeaks then arise because the escaping photons scatter into the\nline wings where the optical depth is lower. This would not,\nhowever, explain why the apparent absorption feature is con-\nstant in wavelength while the fitted emission velocity varies by\nalmost 300 km s\u22121.\ntravel 100 kpc. Although 1000 km s\u22121 is the expected\nlevel of the initial velocity, it has since slowed owing to\nmass loading from the IGM and work against the galaxy\u2019s\ngravity; this implies an age of several 108 yr.\nWe now consider the cooling of the shocked gas. Gas\nbehind a shock of speed vshock is heated to T = 1.4\u00d7 10\n7\n(vshock\/1000 km s\n\u22121)2 K, from which the radiative cool-\ning time is tcool = 1.5kT\/4nhalo\u039b, where \u039b is the cool-\ning function16 (> 5 \u00d7 10\u221223 erg cm3 s\u22121 for 106\u22127 K\nand solar abundances) and nhalo is the surrounding gas\ndensity (the factor 4 reflects the density increase behind\na strong shock). Together, these imply that tcool <\n4.6\u00d7105 yr (vshock\/1000 km s\n\u22121)2\/(nhalo\/cm\n\u22123). Moving\nFigure 4. An illustration of our model for the Ly\u03b1 emis-\nsion and absorption in the redshift z=3.09 galaxy LAB-2. The\nLy\u03b1 emission is produced by gas with a velocity dispersion\n\u223c 1000 km s\u22121 and bulk motions \u223c 290 km s\u22121. This emis-\nsion is then absorbed\/scattered by HI in a foreground shell.\nThe shell\u2019s velocity coherence across the source suggests that\nit is over 100 kpc from galaxy, having been swept up from\nthe surrounding medium by a starburst-driven outflow sev-\neral 108 yr earlier. The possibility that the absorption is\nnot directly associated with LAB-2, but part of a larger fore-\nground absorber which just happens to cover it, is unlikely\nsince this would imply an overall size much larger than ab-\nsorbers of comparable NHI in quasar sightlines\n20 : the LAB-2\nabsorber column density is between that of a Lyman-limit\nsystem (diameter \u223c 80 kpc) and that of a damped Ly\u03b1 ab-\nsorber (\u223c 30 kpc). Such sizes are consistent with recent\nmodelling21 and cosmological simulations22 . Moreover, it has\nbeen shown23 that all damped Ly\u03b1 absorbers at redshift z \u223c 3\nwith NHI > 2\u00d7 10\n20 cm\u22122 can be explained by LBG galactic\nwinds, if they are driven out to \u223c 27 kpc.\nout from the galaxy into the IGM at 100 kpc, the den-\nsity nhalo will range from a few 10\n\u22123 to a few 10\u22124 cm\u22123,\nso for shock velocities of several hundred kilometres per\nsecond, the shocked gas can cool within the expansion\ntimescale of a few 108 yr. The gas is expected17 to cool\nto \u223c 104 K and come into photoionization equilibrium\nwith the metagalactic ultraviolet radiation field, with an\nHI fraction \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.001. Indeed, for the above nhalo\nvalues, the total column density swept up out to 100 kpc\ncould be up to 1021 cm\u22122, compared with the measured\nNHI \u2243 10\n19 cm\u22122. The implied mass of the shell, if it\ncovers an area 100 kpc square, could be almost 1011 M\u2299.\nFor a velocity of 250 km s\u22121 the kinetic energy of such\na shell is 6.3 \u00d7 1058 erg, which we can compare with the\nenergetics of supernovae: the LBG associated with LAB-\n2 (M14) has a near-infrared KS-band magnitude\n4 of 21.7,\nwhich implies (from galaxy evolution models18) a baryonic\n4mass of \u223c 1011 M\u2299, mostly in stars. For a normal stellar\ninitial mass function, supernovae provide \u223c 1049 erg per\nsolar mass of stars1, so \u223c 1060 erg is available and the\nsuperwind model appears energetically feasible.\nWe thus have a consistent picture in which the Ly\u03b1\nabsorber is a highly ionized shell of gas swept up from the\nIGM over several 108 yr since the end of the starburst,\nhaving slowed to within a few hundred kilometres per sec-\nond of the galaxy\u2019s systemic velocity. This demonstrates\nthat superwinds are a galaxy-wide phenomenon, whose\nimpact is not confined to small-scale regions of current\nstar formation, as previous observations might have sug-\ngested. This underscores their importance as a primary\nfeedback agent in galaxy formation.\nReceived 6 December 2004; Accepted 5 May 2005.\n1. Benson, A. J. et al.
