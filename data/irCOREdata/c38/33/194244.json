INTRODUCTION\nThe prohibition of discrimination, at least on grounds of nationality, has\nalways been a constitutional principle of Community law.1 Such discrimina-\ntion can take many forms, since Community law prohibits not only direct\ndiscrimination but various forms of indirect discrimination.2 Furthermore, the\nCourt of Justice has indicated that where discrimination on grounds of nation-\nality is in issue, the requirement of proof is not a heavy one on the\ncomplainant. All that is needed to place the burden on the respondent to justify\nthe potentially differential treatment is that complainants show that the\nrequirement applied to them is intrinsically likely, or susceptible by its very\nnature, to affect them adversely in comparison with the State\u0092s own nationals.3\nThe modern formulation of the prohibition of discrimination recognizes that\nprotection from discrimination on grounds of nationality is central to the\nconcept of citizenship of the Union. Advocate General Jacobs has said:\nFreedom from discrimination on grounds of nationality is the most fundamental\nright conferred by the treaty and must be seen as a basic ingredient of Union citi-\nzenship.4\nThe Court of Justice has repeatedly stated that citizenship of the Union \u0091is\ndestined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States\u0092.5\n* Professor of Law and member of the Centre for European Law and Integration, University\nof Leicester.\n1 See Art 6 of the EEC Treaty, now Art 12 of the EC Treaty: \u0091Within the scope of application\nof this Treaty . . . any discrimination of grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\u0092 Discrimination\non grounds of sex has also always been a part of the Treaty framework, and more recently the EC\nTreaty has addressed, through Art 13, other forms of discrimination.

In a case concerning the\ncitizenship rights of a young child, the Court of Justice has said:\nAs regards the right to reside in the territory of the Member States provided for\nin Article 18(1) EC, it must be observed that that right is granted directly to every\ncitizen of the Union by a clear and precise provision of the Treaty. Purely as a\nnational of a Member State, and therefore as a citizen of the Union, [the child] is\nentitled to rely on Article 18(1) EC. That right of citizens of the Union to reside\nin another Member State is recognised subject to the limitations and conditions\nimposed by the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect (see, in\nparticular, Baumbast and R, paragraphs 84 and 85).6\nIt is the argument of this article that there are two key incidents of citizenship\nof the Union. The first is the right to be free from immigration control in all\nthe Member States. The second is the right for all citizens of the Union to be\ntreated equally with nationals of the host Member State when lawfully present\nin that Member State. To what extent does the current state of Community law\njustify these propositions?\nII. THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM IMMIGRATION CONTROL\nIt is not the thesis of this article that there is no distinction between the nation-\nals of the various Member States; nationality of one of the Member States and\ncitizenship of the Union remain different concepts. The rights of a citizen of\nthe Union who is not a national of a particular Member State are not the same\nas those of a national of that State. For example, under Community law a non-\nnational who is a citizen of the Union can be excluded or expelled from the\nterritory of a Member State on grounds of public policy, public security or\npublic health,7 whereas such exclusion or expulsion is not, under international\nlaw, open to the State of which a person is a national. The issue is therefore\nhow close the rights of citizens of the Union against a Member State are, in\nterms of their being subject to immigration control, when compared with the\nposition of nationals of that State.\nThe case can be made that citizens of the Union are essentially free from\nimmigration control in moving around the territory of the Member States. This\nis because of the range of rights citizens of the Union have to travel to, stay in,\nand reside in, other Member States under Community law as a constitutional\nright flowing from their status as citizens. 8\n886 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n19 Oct 2004, para 25 of the judgment; and Case C-209\/03 Bidar, Judgment of 15 Mar 2005, para\n31 of the judgment.\n6 Case C-200\/02 Zhu and Chen, Judgment of 19 Oct 2004, para 26 of the judgment.\n7 Art 39(3) EC; Art 46; and Art 55.\n8 See generally E Spaventa \u0091From Gebhard to Carpenter: Towards a (Non)economic\nEuropean Constitution\u0092 (2004) 41 CMLRev 743.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nA citizen can travel freely as a tourist or other recipient of services, or as a\nprovider of services. A citizen of the Union engaged in employment or self-\nemployment has a very significant bundle of rights flowing from the EC\nTreaty and its secondary legislation. A citizen of the Union can travel to and\nreside in another Member State, subject to fairly minimal conditions, as a\nstudent, retired person, or person of independent means. A citizen of the Union\ncan travel to and stay in a Member State for a limited period in order to look\nfor work.\nThe Citizenship Directive,9 which must be implemented by the Member\nStates by 30 April 2006, largely recasts the provisions of the repealed direc-\ntives in the language of residence entitlements. Hence, the structure of the\nCitizenship Directive supports the view that citizens of the Union are largely\nfree from immigration control. The first preambular paragraph broadly repeats\nArticle 18 EC, while the second preambular paragraph refers to the free move-\nment of persons as one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market.\nThe third preambular paragraph, echoing the mantra used by the Court of\nJustice in recent cases, provides:\nUnion citizenship should be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member\nStates when they exercise their right of free movement and residence. It is there-\nfore necessary to codify and review the existing Community instruments dealing\nseparately with workers, self-employed persons, as well as students and other\ninactive persons in order to simplify and strengthen the right of free movement\nand residence of all Union citizens.\nThe structure of the Citizenship Directive and its abolition of the Community\nresidence permit for nationals of the Member States10 indicate that it is much\nmore concerned with liberating citizens from immigration control than with\nthe categorization of the economic activity which provides the entitlement to\nrights to enter and reside in a Member State other than that of the citizen\u0092s\nnationality. The directive also makes provision for the first time for the acqui-\nsition of a right of permanent residence which is not linked to the pursuit of\neconomic activity.11\nThe argument that citizens of the Union are essentially free from immigra-\ntion control could not have been maintained with quite this vigour prior to the\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 887\n9 Directive 2004\/38\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 Apr 2004 on the\nright of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of\nthe Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612\/68 and repealing Directives\n64\/221\/EEC, 68\/360\/EEC, 72\/192\/EEC, 73\/148\/EEC, 75\/34\/EEC, 75\/35\/EEC, 90\/364\/EEC,\n90\/365\/EEC, and 93\/96\/EEC [2004] OJ L158\/77, corrected at [2004] OJ L229\/35, referred to in\nthis article as \u0091the Citizenship Directive\u0092. Note that the corrigendum states the number of the\nDirective as 58 in error; other language editions retain the number 38.\n10 A document certifying permanent resident status is introduced in Chapter IV of the\nCitizenship Directive, but this is not a replacement of the \u0091old\u0092 residence permit referred to in Art\n4 of Directive 68\/360\/EEC.\n11 Chapter IV of the Citizenship Directive; acquisition of this status is conditional on having\nresided legally for a continuous period of five years in the host Member State.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nCourt\u0092s judgment in the Baumbast case.12 The ruling in the Baumbast case is\nthat Article 18 EC is capable of giving rise to direct effect, and contains rights\nwhich fill in gaps in the scheme set up in Title III of the EC Treaty. The Court\nsaid:\na citizen of the European Union who no longer enjoys a right of residence as a\nmigrant worker in the host Member State can, as a citizen of the Union, enjoy\nthere a right of residence by direct application of Article 18(1) EC. The exercise\nof that right is subject to the limitations and conditions referred to in that provi-\nsion, but the competent institutions and, where necessary, the national courts\nmust ensure that those limitations and conditions are applied in compliance with\ngeneral principles of Community law and, in particular, the principle of propor-\ntionality.13\nIn the Baumbast case, the Court downplays the significance of the need for\nengagement in economic activity in order to trigger the right to move and\nreside in the Member State of choice; the need for economic activity has been\nsubordinated to a general right to move and reside without being subject to\nimmigration control which flows from the status of citizen of the European\nUnion.14\nAn even more dramatic example of the de-coupling of the requirement of\neconomic activity for residence rights is provided in the Zhu and Chen case.15\nMr and Mrs Chen are Chinese nationals; they were living in the United\nKingdom. They planned matters so that their second child, a girl, was born in\nBelfast; the purpose was to enable her to acquire Irish nationality. The child\nduly obtained an Irish passport attesting her Irish nationality, since the\nRepublic of Ireland allowed any person born in the whole of the island terri-\ntory to acquire Irish nationality. The essential question put to the Court of\nJustice was whether the child\u0092s status as a citizen of the Union entitled her to\nreside in the United Kingdom under Community law and whether her mother,\na third country national, could also reside with the child there in order to care\nfor her as a parent. The Court\u0092s answer in respect of the child was:\nArticle 18 and Directive 90\/364 confer on a young minor who is a national of a\nMember State, is covered by appropriate sickness insurance and is in the care of\na parent who is a third-country national having sufficient resources for that minor\nnot to become a burden on the public finances of the host Member State, a right\nto reside for an indefinite period in that State.16\n888 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n12 Case C-413\/99 Baumbast and R [2002] ECR I-7091. See M Dougan and E Spaventa\n\u0091Educating Rudy and the non-English patient: A double bill on residency rights under Article 18\nEC\u0092 (2003) 28 ELRev 699; see also O Golynker \u0091Partial Migration in the EU after the Baumbast\ncase: Bringing Social and Legal Perspectives Together\u0092 (2004) 15 KCLJ 367.\n13 Para 94 of the judgment.\n14 See, eg para 83 of the judgment.\n15 Case C-200\/02 Zhu and Chen, Judgment of 19 Oct 2004.\n16 Para 41 of the judgment.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe Court also ruled that the mother also had a right to reside in the United\nKingdom under Community law, since otherwise the child\u0092s right to reside\nwould be deprived of any useful effect.\nIt must, however, be acknowledged that there are a number of factors which\ncounter the proposition that citizens of the Union are free from immigration\ncontrol when moving within the territories of the Member States. Both Article\n18 EC and the judgments of the Court of Justice in the Baumbast and Zhu and\nChen cases, as well as the Citizenship Directive, refer to limitations and condi-\ntions provided in the EC Treaty.\nThis is also reflected in the way in which citizenship of the Union is\npresented in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.17 Article I-10\nprovides:\n1. Every national of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship\nof the Union shall be additional to national citizenship and shall not replace it.\n2. Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject to the duties\nprovided for in the Constitution. They shall have:\n(a) the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member\nStates;\n(b) \u0085.\nThese rights shall be exercised in accordance with the conditions and limits\ndefined by the Constitution and by the measures adopted under it.\nThere are restrictions on employment and self-employment by reason of\nthe nature of the activity which reserve certain sectors of employment and\nself-employment for a Member State\u0092s own nationals. There is the exclusion\nof employment in the public service in Article 39(4) EC, and the exclusion of\nactivities involving the exercise of official authority in Article 45 EC. While\nthe existence of such exceptions might be regarded as problematic in the era\nof citizenship of the Union,18 it is the argument of this article that they do not\noperate in a manner which subjects nationals of other Member States to immi-\ngration control. There is merely a limitation in the range of activities which\nmay be undertaken other than by nationals of the host Member State. It can\ntherefore be argued that, rather than affecting their rights of entry and resi-\ndence, they are limitations on the activities which citizens can undertake while\nresident in a Member State other than that of their own nationality. As such it\ncan be argued that the restrictions are more concerned with equality of treat-\nment than limitations on rights of entry and residence.\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 889\n17 Signed on 29 Oct 2004, [2004] OJ C310\/1. Though there is no difference of substance, there\nis a difference in emphasis in the way in which the rights are presented.\n18 The areas reserved for nationals of the host Member State can vary enormously. Note, for\nexample, that provisions of the Police Reform Act 2002 make provision for the removal of the\nrequirement of British nationality as a requirement to serve as a police officer. Furthermore,\nservice in the armed forces in the United Kingdom is open to Commonwealth citizens who have\nbeen resident for a requisite period in the United Kingdom. See further R White Workers,\nEstablishment and Services in the European Union (OUP Oxford 2004) ch 5.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security and\npublic health are rather more problematic. These do mean that, where the exis-\ntence of such grounds can be established, having regard to the requirements of\nCommunity law,19 a Member State can refuse entry to, or expel, a national of\nanother Member State. This is not something a Member State can do in respect\nof its own nationals. The existence of these exceptions means that persons in\nthe territory of the host Member State are treated more as privileged aliens\nthan as persons sharing the rights of citizens of the host Member State by\nvirtue of their shared citizenship of the Union. However, the use of the limita-\ntions is not simply a matter for the discretion of the host Member State. The\nexceptions are narrowly conceived. The grounds have been more and more\nclosely defined.20 The test of proportionality is of major importance in deter-\nmining whether it is appropriate to exclude or expel someone. So, it was not\nopen to Greece to exclude Donatella Calfa from Greece for life when she was\nconvicted of possession of illegal drugs which were exclusively for her\npersonal use, while on holiday in Crete.21 It has never been open to a Member\nState to use the limitations to serve economic ends.22\nThe trend of narrowing the application of the limitations on grounds of\npublic policy, public security and public health can be seen in the provisions\nof Article 28 of the Citizenship Directive. This requires the presence of seri-\nous grounds of public policy or public security to be established where citizens\nof the Union and their families have a right of permanent residence under the\ndirective.23 Where citizens of the Union have resided in the host Member State\nfor the previous ten years, expulsion is only available where there are imper-\native grounds of public policy or public security which justify this.24 There\nare, of course, likely to be references to the Court of Justice on the distinction\nbetween \u0091ordinary\u0092 grounds of public policy and public security, and both\n\u0091serious\u0092 and \u0091imperative\u0092 grounds. It is nevertheless quite clear, in the context\nof the current case law on these exceptions, that only the most serious matters\nwill justify exclusion.\nThe exposition so far has tended to treat the right to enter and to reside\nwithout distinction. But there are important points of distinction to which\nattention should be drawn. At the point of entry there is a very wide right.

However, the right to reside is more limited. It is condi-\ntional in those cases where the person is not engaged in economic activity on\nmeeting the requirements of the relevant directive.25 The condition is that citi-\nzens must be able to support themselves without recourse to public funds.\nEven here, decisions of the Court of Justice which require equality of treat-\nment with nationals of the host Member State have eroded the significance of\nsome of those conditions.26 It is also possible to claim a right to enter and\nreside arising directly from Article 18 EC, though here there is also a require-\nment of self-sufficiency. The requirement that citizens of the Union are not an\nunreasonable burden on the public finances of the host Member State has led\nto suggestions that the right to reside is lost at the point at which self-\nsufficiency comes to an end. However, the Grzelczyk case27 imposes limita-\ntions on the ability of the host Member State to terminate the right of residence\nflowing from citizenship because the Court of Justice imposes a condition of\nproportionality on such a drastic step, which requires the decision to be taken\nin the light of all the surrounding circumstances. By implication, this includes\nconsideration of the extent to which the citizen is integrated into the host\nMember State, and the consequences for him or her of deportation from the\nhost Member State.\nAn issue which arose in both the Trojani case28 and the Bidar case29\nconcerned the status of a non-national\u0092s residence. The issue essentially\nrelated to the evidence available to establish the legal basis of a person\u0092s resi-\ndence in a particular Member State. For the Schengen countries, there is no\ncontrol on entry, and so presumably the status of citizens residing in a coun-\ntry other than that of their own nationality will have to be determined by look-\ning at all the circumstances of the case, including any administrative system\noperating within the State of residence.\nThe difficulty is rather more marked in non-Schengen countries, and can be\nillustrated by reference to United Kingdom practice. There is a practical diffi-\nculty concerning national decision-making in relation to entry to the United\nKingdom, which may well be replicated in some other Member States. Many\nwho enter and reside do so on production of their passports at a port of entry\nin a line reserved for nationals of the European Union, European Economic\nArea, and Switzerland.

Yet much\ncan turn on the legal basis for the right to enter and reside. It might be possi-\nble to say that where a citizen of the European Union enters another Member\nState, that citizen\u0092s right to reside arises under Article 18 EC unless there is\nsome evidence to the contrary. Alternatively, it might be possible to argue that\nthere is a presumption that admission of a citizen of the European Union\nadmitted to another Member State gives rise to lawful residence under national\nlaw in the absence of evidence to the contrary. What is deeply unsatisfactory\nis a situation in which it is unclear whether residence in the United Kingdom\n(or, indeed, any other Member State) arises under national law or Community\nlaw, or both.\nIn the Bidar case, the Court does not address specifically the residence\nstatus of Bidar in the United Kingdom, but proceeds on the basis that he has a\ncommunity right to reside as a student.\nIn the Trojani case, the Court of Justice ruled that Trojani, a single man of\nFrench nationality living in Belgium in a hostel, had no Community right to\nreside, but that he did appear to have been lawfully resident under Belgian law\nfor some time.31 This would be sufficient to bring the equal treatment require-\nments of the Treaty into play in terms of his entitlement to the minimex.32 In\nthe absence of clear evidence of fraud or improper purpose33 at the point of\nentry, it may be difficult for a Member State to show that residence is unlaw-\nful under national law where there has been actual residence for a certain\namount of time.\nBefore turning to the second core right which it is argued attaches to citi-\nzenship of the Union, it is appropriate to make a few remarks about enlarge-\nment of the Union in the context of the right to be free from immigration\ncontrol. This is justified not only because of the importance of the entry of ten\nnew Member States into the Union, but also because the May 2004 enlarge-\nment has been characterized by some intense nervousness about the free\nmovement of persons and the possible migration patterns which might be seen\nin a Union of 25.\nAll enlargements have been accompanied by some transitional provisions,\nand there is nothing new in having transitional provisions relating to the free\n892 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n30 Of course, in many cases Community law precludes any suggestion that leave to enter under\nnational immigration law is involved, but Community law does permit administrative checks or\nenquiries to be made.\n31 Since it appeared that any right of residence arose under national law, the Luxembourg\nCourt left the determination of his precise status for determination by the referring court.\n32 See below.\n33 And it is now well established that using Community law to your advantage does not count\nas an improper purpose: see Case C-109\/01 Akrich, Judgment of 23 Sept 2003 [2003] 3 CMLR\n26.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nmovement of workers.34 A transitional period of seven to ten years for the free\nmovement of workers provisions was put in place when Spain and Portugal\njoined. The full operation of the Treaty provisions was, in fact, achieved in six\nyears. The May 2004 enlargement initially raised worries in the so-called\nfront-line States who were concerned that geographical proximity, consider-\nable variations in earnings levels, differential levels of unemployment, and a\ngreater propensity for labour migration might result in flows of people which\nwould be difficult to manage. So there is a two-plus-three-plus-two-year tran-\nsitional arrangement,35 except in the cases of Cyprus and Malta, where the full\nTreaty provisions on the free movement of workers apply immediately. Until\n1 May 2006, Member States may choose to apply national rules to the admis-\nsion of workers from the new Member States. After this initial two-year\nperiod, the Commission will report on migration patterns and the Fifteen will\nbe required to define their position from 1 May 2006 on the application of the\nrules on the free movement of workers. The hope is that the labour market will\nbe opened up; those countries applying the Treaty rules would for a period of\nthree years be able to apply for safeguard measures in the event of their expe-\nriencing serious and unexpected disturbances of the labour market.36 From 1\nMay 2009, those current Member States still applying national rules would be\ncalled upon to open up their labour markets subject to the possibility of seek-\ning safeguard measures to address serious and unexpected disturbances of\ntheir labour markets. From 1 May 2011 full operation of the Treaty provisions\nmust be applied in all Member States. No Member State may introduce\nmeasures relating to the free movement of workers that is more restrictive than\nthe position as at 1 May 2004.\nThe limitation of the transitional arrangements to the free movement of\nworkers means that there is an immediate right to entry and residence for those\nexercising the right of establishment, or the right to provide or receive\nservices, or as students, retired persons or persons of independent means. The\nway was paved for the application of the provisions on freedom of establish-\nment by provisions of the Europe Agreements, though the entry of persons\nmeeting the requirements of those Agreements arose under national law rather\nthan Community law.\nAlthough it might be argued that the existence of transitional arrangements\nin relation to enlargements and the free movement of workers weakens the\ncase for arguing that citizenship of the Union entails freedom from immigra-\ntion control within the Member States, this represents only a postponement of\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 893\n34 See A Adinolfi \u0091Free Movement and Access to Work of Citizens of the New Member States:\nThe Transitional Measures\u0092 (2005) 42 CMLRev 469.\n35 These arrangements apply both to the new Member States and to the existing Member\nStates, though it is anticipated that the new Member States will take a more liberal approach to\nthe application of the Treaty provisions than the existing Member States.\n36 Malta may make such an application during the period of seven years beginning on 1 May\n2004.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nfull rights in relation to certain movements of people and does not defeat the\nargument. It should also be noted that, if a national of one of the new Member\nStates is admitted as a worker, then their residence will be lawful. Even if that\nis lawful residence under national law,37 then the ruling in the Trojani case\nestablishes that a right to equal treatment arises under Community law with\nnationals of the host Member State. This may be very helpful to a national of\none of the accession countries who falls on hard times.38\nIn summary, it is argued that none of the limitations or exceptions to the\nright of citizens of the Union to enter and reside in a Member State other than\nthat of their own nationality constitutes their being subject to immigration\ncontrol. Though engagement in economic activity arguably still gives citizens\na greater bundle of rights,39 and more security, the limitations which apply to\nthose not engaged in economic activity have been significantly reduced in\ntheir effect by the case law of the Court of Justice, and will be further reduced\nwhen the Citizenship Directive comes into effect. We are very close to the\nposition in which all citizens of the Union are free from immigration control\nwhen moving within the territory of the Member States.\nIII. THE RIGHT TO EQUAL TREATMENT\nThe second incident of citizenship of the Union is the right of citizens of the\nUnion who are not nationals of the host Member State to be treated on an equal\nfooting with nationals of that Member State.\nArticle 24 of the Citizenship Directive provides a good starting point; it is\nentitled \u0091Equal treatment\u0092:\n1. Subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided for in the Treaty\nand secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the basis of this Directive in\nthe territory of the host Member State shall enjoy equal treatment with the\nnationals of that Member State within the scope of the Treaty. The benefit of this\nright shall be extended to family members who are not nationals of a Member\nState and who have the right of residence or permanent residence.\n2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the host Member State shall not be\nobliged to confer entitlement to social assistance during the first three months of\nresidence or, where appropriate, the longer period provided for in Article\n14(4)(b), nor shall it be obliged, prior to acquisition of the right of permanent\nresidence, to grant maintenance aid for studies, including vocational training,\nconsisting in student grants or student loans, to persons other than workers, self-\nemployed persons, persons who retain such status and their families.\n894 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n37 It is unclear whether residence in such circumstances arises under national law or commu-\nnity law.\n38 See R White \u0091Residence, Benefit Entitlement and Community Law\u0092 (2005) 12 JSSL 10.\n39 The rights are explicitly defined in the EC Treaty and Community secondary legislation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe first sentence of the first paragraph already needs qualification having\nregard to the decision of the Court of Justice in the Trojani case.40 This made\nit clear that entitlement to equal treatment under community law could flow\nfrom lawful residence for a certain time under national law. The rights referred\nto in Article 24(1) accrue to this group in addition to those \u0091residing on the\nbasis of this Directive\u0092.\nBefore considering the citizenship line of cases, some brief observations\nwill be offered on those provisions of Regulation 1612\/6841 and Regulation\n1408\/7142 which concern the social protection of citizens of the Union.\nRegulation 1612\/68 confers benefits on workers, though the Court of Justice\ntells us in the Collins case43 that the meaning of \u0091worker\u0092 varies in the context\nof the provision of this Regulation. However, for Part II of the Regulation, the\nbeneficiaries are those who have actually found work, and work seekers are\nexcluded.44 There are specific applications of the prohibition of discrimination\nin Article 1(2) on eligibility for employment; in Article 7 on conditions of\nemployment, and in the availability of social and tax advantages;45 in Article\n8 on trade union rights; and in Article 9 on access to housing. Article 42 of the\nRegulation provides:\nThis Regulation shall not affect measures taken in accordance with Article 51 of\nthe Treaty.46\nIt is the view of the United Kingdom Government47 that where Regulation\n1408\/71 applies, Regulation 1612\/68 has no application. It follows, according to\nthis argument, that in such circumstances, the benefit the claimant is seeking\ndoes not amount to a social or tax advantage within Regulation 1612\/68 if it falls\nwithin Regulation 1408\/71. In the Bobezes case, the English Court of Appeal\nrefused to elaborate on the relationship between the two regulations despite\nCounsel for the Department of Work and Pensions \u0091forcefully contending that it\nis essential that the court should decide under which of the two regulations this\nquestion has to be resolved.\u009248 The case concerned entitlement to a child addi-\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 895\n40 Case C-456\/02 Trojani, Judgment of 7 Sept 2004.\n41 Council Regulation 1612\/68\/EEC of 15 Oct 1968 on freedom of movement for workers\nwithin the Community [1968] II OJ Eng Sp Ed 475, as amended.\n42 Council Regulation 1408\/71\/EC of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security\nschemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to member of their families moving\nwithin the Community, see consolidated text incorporated in Council Regulation 118\/97\/EC\n[1997] OJ L28 (as further amended).\n43 Case C-138\/02 Collins [2004] ECR I-2703.\n44 See also Case 316\/85 Lebon, [1987] ECR 2811.

The English\nCourt of Appeal concluded that, since both parties conceded that the prohibition\nof discrimination in Article 3 of Regulation 1408\/71 applied, there was no need\nto respond to the question about the relationship of the two regulations.49\nRegulation 1408\/71 contains an important set of rules enabling differing\nsocial security systems to work together to ensure that there is no disadvantage\nto those exercising their rights of free movement. Its personal scope has been\nconsiderably widened over time, so that it now covers all those who have been\nsubject to the social security legislation of any Member State. It contains a\nprohibition on discrimination in Article 3, though this will only apply where\nthe benefit in issue is within the material scope of the Regulation.50 This\nexcludes social and medical assistance, and benefit schemes for victims of war\nor its consequences.51\nIt was the Mart\u00ednez-Sala case52 which first hinted that citizenship of the\nUnion may bring new rights. The referring court had conceded that Maria\nMart\u00ednez-Sala\u0092s residence as a Spanish national in Germany was lawful. The\nCourt of Justice ruled that this entitled her to equal treatment with nationals in\nrelation to entitlement to social assistance. There was, however, some feeling\nthat the case might have turned on its special facts and the finding of fact by\nthe referring court of her long-standing lawful residence in Germany.\nThe Grzelczyk case53 established that the decision in the Mart\u00ednez-Sala\ncase was not a flash in the pan. Grzelczyk was a French national who was\nstudying in Belgium. He seems to have supported himself for the first three\nyears of his course. During this time he seems to have done some part-time\nwork, though this does not appear to be material to the Court\u0092s decision; he\nwas not regarded as being a worker. However, in his fourth year he experi-\nenced financial strains, and applied for social assistance. This was initially\ngranted, but when the social assistance agency sought reimbursement from the\nrelevant central authority in Belgium, it was refused because Grzelczyk was\nnot a Belgian national. The Court notes that, from the file submitted by the\nnational court, it is clear that the national court had concluded that Grzelczyk\nwas not a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC. The question the Court\nof Justice addresses is whether the Belgian authorities could make entitlement\nto social assistance conditional on a national of another Member State having\n896 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n49 The Social Security Commissioner, whose decision had been appealed to the Court of\nAppeal, had concluded that the claimant was entitled to rely on Art 7(2) of Regulation 1612\/68\nnotwithstanding that his claim also fell within Regulation 1408\/71: see CIS\/825\/2001.\n50 For a summary of the provisions of the regulation, see R White Workers, Establishment and\nServices in the European Union chap 9.\n51 Regulation 1408\/71, Art 4(4).\n52 Case 85\/96 Mart\u00ednez-Sala [1998] ECR I-2691; see S O\u0092Leary \u0091Putting Flesh on the Bones\nof European Union Citizenship\u0092 (1999) 24 ELRev 68.\n53 Case C-184\/99 Grzelczyk, [2001] ECR I-6193; see also C Jacqueson \u0091Union citizenship and\nthe Court of Justice: something new under the sun?

The Court said that Article 12 EC must\nbe read in conjunction with the provisions of the EC Treaty on citizenship of\nthe Union. The Court goes on:\nUnion citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the\nMember States, enabling those who find themselves in the same situation to\nenjoy the same treatment in law irrespective of their nationality, subject to such\nexceptions as are expressly provided for.54\nA few paragraphs later, the Court says:\nThere is nothing in the amended text of the Treaty to suggest that students who\nare citizens of the Union, when they move to another Member State to study\nthere, lose the rights which the treaty confers on citizens of the Union.55\nDirective 93\/96\/EEC56 on the free movement of students indicates that they\nare not entitled to maintenance grants, but does not \u0091preclude those whom it\napplies for receiving social security benefits\u0092 on equal terms with nationals of\nthe Member State of residence. It would follow that students who start a\ncourse not needing to have recourse to public funds, are not precluded from\nmaking a claim if their circumstances change. Nor, it seems, do they lose their\nstatus as students entitled to reside in the host Member State; such rights flow\nboth from the directive on students and from citizenship of the Union.57 This\nis a significant enhancement of the position of citizens of the Union resident\nin a country other than that of their own nationality. Equality of treatment in\nall matters is required unless there is some exception applicable to their\ncircumstances. This moves the case law on from the earlier decisions.\nThis trend can be seen in the recent decision of the Court of Justice in the\nCollins case.58 The case concerned a citizen of the Union who was not a worker\nwithin the meaning of Article 39 EC and Regulation 1612\/68, and whose right\nto reside did not flow from Directive 68\/360. Despite this, his status as a citi-\nzen of the Union meant that he had a right to equal treatment; any national\nlegislation which made entitlement to a social security benefit conditional on\nmeeting residence requirements would only be lawful if such requirements\ncould be justified on the basis of objective considerations independent of the\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 897\n54 Para 31 of the judgment.\n55 Para 35 of the judgment.\n56 Council Directive 93\/96\/EEC of 29 Oct 1993 on the right of residence for students [1993]\nOJ L317\/59, as amended; see [1995] OJ L1\/1.\n57 Art 18(1) EC gives an independent right to reside subject on the limitations and conditions\nin the Treaty and in the measures to give effect to it.

Trojani was a single man of\nFrench nationality. He clearly fell on hard times. He was living in a Salvation\nArmy hostel in Belgium under an arrangement where he undertook various\njobs for the hostel as part of a personal rehabilitation scheme, in exchange for\nwhich he received board and lodging and an allowance of \u008025.00 per week.\nHe claimed the minimex.62 His claim was refused on the grounds that he was\nnot a Belgian national. Trojani brought proceedings before the Labour Court\nin Brussels to challenge this refusal. That Court referred questions to the Court\nof Justice. For our purposes the most important question is the second one\nreferred to the Court,63 which essentially concerned the possible entitlement\nof Trojani to the minimex as a person exercising his right to reside in Belgium\nas a citizen of the European Union. The Advocate General concluded that it\nwas open to Belgium to deny Trojani a right of residence because he did not\nhave the means to support himself. The Court was a little more circumspect.\nReferring to the ruling in the Baumbast case, the Court indicated that it would\nnot be disproportionate to deny Trojani a right of residence on the basis that\nhe did not have the means to be self-sufficient. In other words, he had no\nCommunity right to reside. But the Court went on to note that he may have a\nright to reside under national law, since he had been issued with a residence\npermit under national law by the municipal authorities in Brussels. The Court\nmade three points:64\n(a) Social assistance falls within the scope of the EC Treaty.\n(b) A citizen of the Union who is not economically active may rely on the\nprohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality where he has been\n\u0091lawfully resident\u0092 in the host Member State \u0091for a certain time or\npossesses a residence permit\u0092.65\n(c) Restricting entitlement to social assistance to the nationals of the host\nMember State constitutes discrimination on grounds of nationality\ncontrary to Article 12 EC.\nIt would follow that, if the national court concludes that Trojani was \u0091lawfully\nresident\u0092 in Belgium under national law, then the prohibition of discrimination\nin Community law would be engaged, and the restriction of entitlement to the\nminimex to Belgian nationals in the circumstances of this case would breach\nthe equality provisions of the EC Treaty.\n898 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n59 Case C-138\/02 Collins, para 73 of the judgment.\n60 Para 72 of the judgment.\n61 Case C-456\/02 Trojani, Judgment of 7 Sept 2004.\n62 The minimum subsistence allowance in Belgium.\n63 The first concerned whether Trojani was a worker.\n64 Case C-456-02 Trojani, Judgment of 7 Sept 2004, paras 41\u00966.\n65 ibid, para 43 of the judgment.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe expanding role of equal treatment is most recently illustrated by the\nCourt\u0092s judgment in the Bidar case.66 Bidar, a French national, came to the\nUnited Kingdom to live with his grandmother at the age of 15 since his mother\nwas to undergo treatment there for a terminal illness. He attended public-\nsector secondary education and secured the entry requirements for admission\nto University College London. He then applied for a student loan, but was\nrefused because he did not meet the conditions of entitlement for such a loan.67\nThree questions are raised in the reference: first, whether financial assistance\nfor living expenses granted to students should now be regarded as within the\nscope of the EC Treaty; and, secondly, what criteria the national court should\napply in determining whether the conditions of entitlement for such assistance\ncould be objectively justified.68\nThe first issue was whether assistance granted to students to cover their\nmaintenance costs should, notwithstanding the Court\u0092s earlier decisions in the\nLair69 and Brown70 cases, now be regarded as within the scope of the EC\nTreaty. The Court refers to the settled case law of the Court under which a citi-\nzen of the Union lawfully resident in the territory of the host Member State can\nrely on Article 12 EC in all situations which are within the material scope of\nthe EC Treaty. Furthermore, movement to another Member State to pursue\nsecondary education there \u0091exercises the freedom to move guaranteed by\nArticle 18 EC\u0092.71 The Court then refers to the proposition in its judgment in\nthe Trojani case relating to social assistance:\na citizen of the Union who is not economically active may rely on the first para-\ngraph of Article 12 EC where he has been lawfully resident in the host Member\nState for a certain time. . . .72\nSignificant developments since the judgments in the Lair and Brown cases\nwere the introduction of citizenship of the Union, and what is now Title XI of\nthe EC Treaty which contains a chapter devoted to education and vocational\ntraining.

As Community law now stands, this right of residence has the following\nprincipal characteristics:\n(a) The right of residence is a fundamental right of every European citizen. \nThat right may be restricted as little as possible.\n(b) Community law recognises as a ground for limiting that right the interest of\na Member State in preventing any unreasonable burden being placed on the\npublic finances.\n(c) In the EC Treaty a distinction is made between economic migrants and non-\neconomic migrants. Both groups have a right of residence, the only differ-\nence being the scope of their respective claims. Economic migrants have\nthe stronger claim. Thus, they do not need to prove that they can provide\nfor themselves.\n(d) The Court interprets the concept of worker broadly. This tends to\nstrengthen the right of residence to the greatest extent possible.76\nThe Advocate General had also commented in this case:\nThe basic principle of Community law is that persons who depend on social\nassistance will be taken care of in their own Member State.77\nThe tension presented by the case law is accordingly the extent to which\nthis principle is eroded by rights flowing from citizenship of the Union. The\ntenor of the Court\u0092s case law is that there is an entitlement to equal treatment\nin all areas of social protection where there is a sufficient degree of integration\nof the Union citizen into the fabric of the host Member State. In the Trojani\ncase that could be established by his lawful residence under national law for a\ncertain time; in the Collins case it could be established by a period of residence\ncoupled with activity which indicated that Collins was genuinely engaged with\nthe labour market of the host Member State; and in the Bidar case, there was\na \u0091genuine link\u009278 as a result of the completion of a substantial part of Bidar\u0092s\nsecondary education in England.\nThe entitlement to equality of treatment with nationals is surprisingly\npowerful. The logical consequence of the entitlement is that much of the\n900 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\npersons who retain such status and members of their families\u0092. Permanent residence is acquired\nwhen Union citizens have resided legally for a continuous period of five years: Art 16 of the\nCitizenship Directive.\n74 Case C-209\/03 Bidar, Judgment of 15 Mar 2005, paras 49\u009663 of the judgment.\n75 Case C-456-02 Trojani, Judgment of 7 Sept 2004.\n76 ibid, para 10 of the Advocate General\u0092s Opinion.\n77 Case C-456-02 Trojani, Judgment of 7 Sept 2004, para 70 of the Opinion.\n78 Case C-209\/03 Bidar, Judgment of 15 Mar 2005, para 63 of the judgment.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nsecondary legislation spelling out the Community rights which flow from\neconomically active status are no longer needed. There will, however,\ncontinue to be a need for Community provisions coordinating the differing\nnational social security systems, as well as those providing for mutual recog-\nnition of qualifications. There will also be a need for those provisions which\nsecure an entitlement under Community law which is higher than that required\nin some Member States, that is, where national treatment falls below the stan-\ndard required by Community law.79\nIV. REVERSE DISCRIMINATION\nIn an era in which citizenship of the Union is \u0091destined to be the fundamental\nstatus of nationals of the Member States\u0092, the continuing existence of reverse\ndiscrimination is highly problematic.80 It does not seem compatible with a\nshared citizenship and with the requirement for equal treatment that a Member\nState should remain free to treat its own nationals worse than it is required to\ntreat the nationals of other Member States under Community law. Equality\nworks both ways. If a citizen of the Union who is a national of another\nMember State can claim equal treatment when in the United Kingdom, why\ncannot a national of the United Kingdom claim equal treatment against the\nUnited Kingdom with the rights enjoyed by the citizen of the Union from\nanother Member State? There is something distinctly odd in citizenship of the\nUnion as a fundamental status about having rights which are Community\nrights which can only be asserted against other Member States but not against\nthe Member State whose nationality is held, unless Community law is engaged\nby the exercise of certain rights under the EC Treaty. Whereas, prior to the\nintroduction of citizenship of the Union, it might have been acceptable to say\nthat the problem rested with the Member States who could easily extend the\n\u0091missing\u0092 rights to their own nationals, the case today for not recognizing the\nCommunity-accorded rights of citizens available against every Member State\nin all circumstances is even less satisfactory.\nV. EQUALITY AND THE OTHER CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS IN THE EC TREATY\nArticle 19 EC gives citizens of the Union the right to stand for election at\nmunicipal elections,81 and to vote in such elections, under the same conditions\nas nationals, and similar rights in relation to elections to the European\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 901\n79 A good example is entitlement arising under Regulation 1612\/68 to bring certain relatives to\nlive with you which are not included in national immigration law, as exemplified by cases on\nreverse discrimination such as Joined Cases 35 and 36\/82 Morson & Jhanjan v Netherlands\n[1982] ECR 3723.\n80 See generally N nic Shuibhne, \u0091Free Movement of Persons and the Wholly Internal Rule:\nTime to Move on?\u0092 (2002) 29 CMLRev 731.\n81 But not in national elections.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nParliament. The development of the requirement to accord equal treatment\nwould require an extension of this provision to cover national elections. But a\nprovision dealing with election rights would not be needed at all if the scope\nof application of the rule of equal treatment were to be extended to this area.82\nArticle 20 makes provisions for shared diplomatic or consular protection,\nthus ensuring such protection in a country where the State of nationality is not\nrepresented but other Member States are. Article 20 only arises where the\nState of nationality has no representation in the third country.\nPerhaps these qualified rights indicate the remaining difference between\ncitizenship of the Union and nationality of one of the Member States. In rela-\ntion to voting rights, it can be argued that a better approach would be to permit\nelection rights in relation to national elections when the citizen has achieved\npermanent resident status, and so has achieved the requisite degree of integra-\ntion into the national community whose legislature is being elected. This\nwould recognise an entitlement to participation in national democratic\nprocesses as an incident of citizenship of the Union where a sufficient degree\nof integration into the Member State in question could be established.\nVI. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\nFreedom from immigration control and equal treatment with nationals of the\nhost Member State are, it is argued, the twin pillars on which citizenship of the\nUnion has been constructed. However, these pillars are not human rights in the\nuniversal sense. They are rights which attach to citizenship. The language of\nfundamental and human rights in Community law is sometimes rather too loose.\nThe rights addressed so far in this article are fundamental rights for citizens of\nthe Union, but they are not fundamental or human rights in the universal sense.\nFundamental or human rights in this sense are not conditioned on the beneficiary\nholding citizenship of the Union. Human rights protection is not, and should not\nbe, conditioned on the holding of citizenship of the Union. Human rights are\nmatters of entitlement for all people regardless of their nationality. That has\nalways, and rightly so, been the position under the European Convention on\nHuman Rights. The rights set out in the European Convention are to be secured\nfor all within the jurisdiction of the Contracting State Party. The position is the\nsame in relation to the protection of human rights which flows from Community\nlaw. Happily, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union makes\nthe distinction between those rights of citizens of the Union and those of every-\none, regardless of their nationality.83\n902 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n82 Equal treatment is only required where the subject matter in issue is within the scope of the\nEC Treaty; standing and voting in municipal and national elections (as distinct from elections to\nthe European Parliament) would clearly be outside the scope of the EC Treaty in the absence of\nArt 19 EC.\n83 See generally S Peers and A Ward The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Politics, Law\nand Policy (Hart Publishing Oxford 2004).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe impact of human rights considerations in the Community law\ncontext can best be seen in cases concerning nationals of States which are not\nMember States of the Union. After many years in which the interests of third\ncountry nationals were largely ignored, Community law is increasingly view-\ning the rights of third country nationals lawfully resident in one of the Member\nStates as being much the same as those of citizens of the Union. This can be\nseen in the directives made under Title IV of the EC Treaty.84 It is also evident\nin the case law of the Court of Justice. The Akrich case85 is a good example of\nthe impact of human rights on the requirements community law imposes. The\ncase concerned the rights of a Moroccan national who had married a United\nKingdom national, had then moved to Ireland where both worked, and sought\nto return to the United Kingdom in reliance on Community law. Akrich had a\nbad record as an illegal immigrant, and the United Kingdom, perhaps under-\nstandably, resisted his attempts to rely on Community law to secure his entry\nand residence in the United Kingdom. In its judgment on a reference from the\nHigh Court, the Court of Justice stressed the need for the United Kingdom\nimmigration authorities in considering the application of a third country\nnational to be admitted to the United Kingdom to have regard to Article 8 of\nthe European Convention and to respect for family life. Those rights belonged,\nin the case in question, to both the third country national and to the citizen of\nthe Union to whom he was married.\nVII. SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS\nA. The rights of the economically active\nThis article has touched only adjectivally on the substantial bundle of rights\naccorded to those who can bring themselves within the Community definitions\nof workers, self-employed persons and providers or recipients of services.86\nThe distinction between migrants engaging in economic activity and those not\nengaged in economic activity has been, and remains to some extent, central to\nthe development of a body of rights for those moving within the European\nUnion. The rights of those who are economically active are less circumscribed\nthan the rights of those who are not economically active. This reflects a view\nthat those who qualify as economic migrants will be able to provide for their\nown needs from the proceeds of their economic activity. By contrast, the right\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 903\n84 See eg Council Directive 2003\/86\/EC of 22 Sept 2003 on the right to family reunification\n[2003] OJ L251\/12; and Council Directive 2003\/109\/EC of 25 Nov 2003 concerning the status of\nthird-country nationals who are long-term residents [2004] OJ L16\/44.\n85 Case C-109\/01 Akrich [2003] ECR I-9607.

The\nadvantages which a migrant may claim will still depend upon the underlying\nbasis of their movement to another Member State. Secondary legislation of the\nUnion also provides detailed rights for those who are economically active\nwhen things go wrong, for example, when a worker becomes involuntarily\nunemployed, or where a worker is unable to continue work as a result of some\naccident or injury.87\nIt is possible to view these different situations as merely affecting what the\ncitizen of the Union must show in order to acquire rights in the Member State\nof residence. Where the citizen is economically active,88 there is a presump-\ntion of entitlement to the full bundle of rights attaching to citizenship of the\nUnion, and there is no need to show financial independence; that is presumed.\nWhere citizens fall within the terms of the directives on students, retired\npersons and persons of independent means, their entitlement is prescribed by\nthose legislative provisions. Finally, in other cases,89 the rights of citizens to\nequal treatment with nationals is conditioned on their establishing a sufficient\nlink with the host Member State to be regarded as integrated with nationals of\nthat State for securing particular benefits.\nThis position might be considered to be supported by the decision of the\nCourt of Justice in the Oulane case,90 in which the Court confirmed that the\nhost Member State may still require citizens of the Union to comply with\ncertain administrative formalities in order to have their rights as citizens\nrecognized.91 The onus will be on the citizens of the Union to establish their\nentitlement,92 and failure to be able to do so may make them liable to depor-\ntation \u0091subject to the limits imposed by Community law\u0092.93\nB. Resource allocation\nThe range of rights enjoyed by citizens of the Union in a Member State other\nthan that of their own nationality raises the issue of social solidarity versus\n904 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n87 Note that the Citizenship Directive opens up broader opportunities for permanent residence\nthan the provisions of the directives concerned with staying on after a period of employment or\nself-employment.\n88 Or has been economically active and can now under Community secondary legislation be\ntreated as if he or she continued to be a worker or self-employed person.\n89 This might include those falling within the first two groups where the provisions governing\nthose situations leave gaps in entitlement.\n90 Case C-215\/03 Oulane, judgment of 17 Feb 2005.\n91 Para 49 of the judgment.\n92 In the Oulane case, establishing a right to reside as a recipient of services was in issue.\n93 Para 55 of the judgment.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nunreasonable burden. There has always been a link between social protection\nand the nation State which is challenged by the pooling of some of the rights\nof citizenship of the individual Member States in citizenship of the Union. The\nerosion of national borders challenges the nation State model of social protec-\ntion, because it raises questions about the allocation of national resources. Free\nmovement also highlights the differing levels of social protection among the\nMember States.\nMember States94 still remain nervous that they will find national resources\nstretched as a result of migratory patterns. There remains the strong myth in\nsome Member States that there are substantial numbers of economic migrants\nunwilling to work their way to better economic status roaming the Member\nStates seeking social assistance. If the hypothesis put forward in this article\nhas any validity, then there are resource issues which will arise. They go to the\nheart of the responsibility of the State to its nationals. At present, there is in\nmany Member States a distinction between the rights which a national enjoys\nand those which third country nationals enjoy in relation to social assistance\nor health care.95 This seems to be traceable back to some notion of a State\u0092s\nhaving a particular responsibility to its own nationals which it is not obliged\nto extend to nationals of other States. That approach has led to differential\ntreatment of a Member State\u0092s own nationals and nationals of other Member\nStates, but such differential treatment is now largely outlawed by the require-\nment of equal treatment of nationals of other Member States with a State\u0092s\nown nationals as a consequence of the possession of citizenship of the Union.\nThe current position under which a genuine link with the host Member\nState is required before lawful residence triggers equal treatment seems to be\na fair and effective way to accommodate the concerns of some Member States.\nThe need for Member States to justify in objective terms, which includes a\nrequirement of proportionality, restrictions on access to the full range of social\nprotection, will prevent the application of rules which essentially offer assis-\ntance only to nationals, and will require thought to be given to the inherent\nfairness of access to such support. There remains some uncertainty about the\nprecise nature of what will be regarded as a genuine link. For example, in rela-\ntion to financial assistance for student maintenance costs, the Member States\nclearly felt that a condition of residence for five years was reasonable, since\nthat is the period during which there is no entitlement under Article 24 of the\nCitizenship Directive. But such a period would seem to be somewhat longer\nthan the Court of Justice envisaged in giving its judgment in the Bidar case.96\nFree Movement, Equal Treatment, and Citizenship of the Union 905\n94 Particularly those who perceive themselves as offering a high level of social protection.\n95 See, for a good example of the debate, Secretary of State for Health v R on the application\nof Yvonne Watts [2004] EWCA Civ 166, referring questions to the Court of Justice on provision\nof health care.\n96 Case C-209\/03 Bidar, Judgment of 15 Mar 2005, though it should be noted that the case did\nnot concern the interpretation of the Citizenship Directive.\n"}
