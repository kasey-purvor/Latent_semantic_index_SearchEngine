Warm advection, associated with f\u00f6hn \nflow, led to the formation of a stable boundary layer over the ice shelf, with a very \nsharp low-level jet at the top of the surface inversion.

The contribution from the sensible heat \nflux (13 W m-2) was largely balanced by an upwards flux of latent heat (\u20139 W m-2). \nThese measurements provide insight into the processes that control surface melt rates \nin an area that has experienced recent rapid warming and deglaciation. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Airborne measurements, Antarctic, Orographic flows, Stable boundary \nlayer,  \n 3\n1. Introduction \n \nStable boundary layers (SBLs) are a common feature of the atmosphere in the \npolar regions. During the winter season, when the solar elevation at high latitudes is \nsmall or even negative, strongly-stable boundary layers can persist for periods of \nmany days. This lack of diurnal variability, together with the availability of flat and \nuniform snow and ice surfaces, has encouraged researchers to use polar sites as \n\u201cnatural laboratories\u201d for studying the SBL under idealised conditions (e.g. King, \n1990; Heinemann, 2004). \nDuring the summer months insolation increases at high latitudes and  polar \nboundary layers are generally only weakly stably-stratified or even weakly unstable \n(Mastrantonio et al., 1999). However, SBLs can develop during summer as a result of \nrelatively warm (T > 0oC) air being advected over a snow or ice surface. In the \nabsence of meltwater ponding, the surface temperature cannot rise above 0oC so a \nSBL develops, with the downward sensible heat flux contributing to melting and \nsublimation at the snow surface.  \nAdvective SBLs of this type are relatively uncommon in Antarctica as the \nsurface temperatures of the seas that surround the continent are generally only slightly \nabove freezing point even during the summer. The northernmost parts of the Antarctic \nPeninsula do, however, experience warm air advection events during the summer. \nThis part of Antarctica has experienced rapid warming over the past 50 years (King et \nal, 2004) which has led, in turn, to significant deglaciation (Vaughan et al., 1996; \nCook et al., 2005). Marshall et al. (2006) suggest that warm air advection events have \nbecome more common in the northeast part of the Antarctic Peninsula in response to a \nstrengthening of the circumpolar westerly winds, which has increased the frequency \n 4\nwith which warm air masses are able to cross the mountain barrier of the Antarctic \nPeninsula. \nIn this paper we report aircraft-based observations of a SBL that formed in \nresponse to a warm air advection event over the Larsen Ice Shelf on the eastern side \nof the Antarctic Peninsula in January 2006. As well as providing information on \nregional climate processes, these observations provide more general insight into the \nstructure and behaviour of a SBL capped by a strong low-level jet. Such jets appear to \nbe a fairly ubiquitous feature of SBLs but aircraft observations under such conditions \nare relatively rare. Our measurements, therefore, complement observations of jet-\ncapped SBLs made at lower latitudes (e.g. Banta et al., 2006). \n \n 5\n2. Description of the study area \n \nThe Larsen Ice shelf (Figure1) is an extensive area of floating glacial ice that \nfringes the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula. As the ice is floating the surface \nslope is small and the ice surface is very uniform in character, although localised \nsurface melting in summer can generate some inhomogeneity. At its widest, the ice \nshelf extends some 200 km to the east of the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula. \nThese mountains take the form of a steep, north-south trending barrier, less than 100 \nkm in width but rising to between 1500 and 2000 masl, which forms an important \nclimatic divide (King and Turner, 1997). A topographic section across the mountain \nbarrier in the vicinity of our study area is shown in Figure 2.  \nThe west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula frequently experiences relatively \nwarm westerly or northwesterly flows which originate over the Pacific sector of the \nSouthern Ocean. These air masses are generally stably-stratified so the Antarctic \nPeninsula mountains provide an effective barrier to their eastward flow. As a result of \nthis orographic blocking, the region to the east of the barrier, including the Larsen Ice \nShelf, is usually under the influence of cold air masses originating over the Antarctic \ncontinent. These frequently take the form of a barrier jet blowing from south to north \nalong the east side of the mountain barrier (Parish, 1983). Consequently, annual mean \ntemperatures on the east coast are 5 - 10 oC lower than those at a comparable latitude \non the west coast (Morris and Vaughan, 2003). \nOn occasions when the westerlies are sufficiently strong, warm air masses are \nable to cross the mountain barrier (Orr et al., 2004; Marshall et al., 2006). Under such \nconditions, the surface temperature gradient across the Peninsula is much smaller and \ntemperatures over the Larsen Ice Shelf are higher than average. During the summer \n 6\nseason, such conditions can lead to high surface melt rates (van den Broeke, 2005). \nThe highest temperatures occur when the upstream flow is partially blocked and the \neastern side of the Peninsula barrier comes under the influence of adiabatically-\nwarmed air descending in a f\u00f6hn flow. The observations described in this paper were \nmade under such conditions. \n 7\n \n \nFigure 1.

The small \ninset map shows the location of the study area within the Antarctic Peninsula. \n \n \nFigure 2. A topographic section along the line shown on Figure 1 .\n 8\n3. Aircraft instrumentation and data processing \n \nMeasurements were made using an instrumented DHC6 Twin Otter aircraft \noperated by the British Antarctic Survey. Static pressure, dynamic pressure and total \ntemperature were measured using standard aircraft sensors. Humidity measurements \nwere made using a cooled-mirror hygrometer and a Vaisala Humicap sensor. The \nformer sensor was not working correctly on the flight described in this paper and all \nhumidity values have been derived from the Humicap. Upwelling and downwelling \nlong- and shortwave radiation were measured using Eppley pyranometers and \npyrgeometers mounted on the cabin roof and under the belly of the aircraft. The \ntemperature of the surface over which the aircraft was flying was measured using a \ndownward-looking Heitronics KT19.82 infrared thermometer. A downward-pointing \nvideo camera provided a record of surface conditions.  \nHigh frequency (50 Hz) timeseries of all three components of air motion relative \nto the aircraft were computed from measurements made using a Best Aircraft \nTurbulence (BAT) probe (Garman et al., 2006) mounted on the end of a boom which \nextended from the cabin roof to just forward of the aircraft nose. This probe \nincorporates sensors for dynamic and static pressure, together with differential \npressure sensors for computing attack and sideslip angles, and a thermocouple sensor \nfor fast-response temperature measurements. All BAT probe sensors were low-pass \nfiltered at 30 Hz and then oversampled at 1600 Hz to avoid aliasing before block \naveraging to provide data at 50 Hz. Measurements of all three components of aircraft \nposition, attitude and velocity were provided at a rate of 20 Hz by a JAVAD AT4 \nfour-antenna GPS system. At the aircraft\u2019s level-flight airspeed of 63 m s-1, the 50 Hz \nsampling of the BAT probe corresponds to a sampling interval of 1.26 m. \n 9\nData from all instruments were recorded on an onboard computer system. Data \nfrom the BAT probe were recorded at 50 Hz, all other instruments were sampled at \nrates between 0.7 and 5 Hz. GPS time signals from the JAVAD system were used to \nprovide a common timebase for all sensors. \nCalculation of corrected temperatures and of wind components in an Earth-\nreferenced frame was carried out according to standard procedures (e.g. Lenschow, \n1986). Briefly, measurements of true air speed, angle of attack and sideslip angle from \nthe BAT probe were used to compute wind components relative to the aircraft. \nAttitude data from the GPS system were then used to rotate these components onto \nearth-referenced axes. Finally, the components of aircraft motion output by the GPS \nsystem were  subtracted to give earth-referenced wind components. The vertical \ncomponent of the wind was corrected for the effects of flow distortion around the \naircraft using the procedure of  Crawford et al. (1996). Optimal calibration \ncoefficients for the BAT probe were determined by flying a series of calibration \nmanoeuvres (Lenschow, 1986). Manufacturer-supplied calibrations were used for all \nother instruments. Downwelling shortwave radiation was corrected for aircraft \nattitude variations using the procedure of Bannehr and Glover (1991), assuming clear \nsky conditions (as was appropriate for this flight). A small correction was applied to \nthe measured upwelling shortwave radiation to account for the fraction of the \ninstrument\u2019s field of view that was obscured by the aircraft undercarriage. \nOn the flight described in this paper, the dynamic pressure sensor on the BAT \nprobe malfunctioned, probably as a result of water or ice blocking the port. Winds \nwere, therefore, computed using the dynamic pressure measured at a standard pitot \ntube mounted on the aircraft nose. As this sensor was only sampled at 1 Hz, there may \nbe some loss of high-frequency variance in the computed wind components. \n 10\nHowever, comparison of turbulence statistics on other flights when both sensors were \nworking indicates that using pitot pressure rather than BAT pressure has negligible \nimpact on the calculated vertical velocity variance and heat fluxes and results in a \nreduction of approximately 10% in the variance of the horizontal components of \nvelocity. We therefore conclude that turbulence statistics computed using pitot \ndynamic pressure are sufficiently accurate for our purposes.\n 11\n \n \n4. Observations \n4.1 FLIGHT PATTERNS \n \nThe aircraft took off from Rothera Research Station (67.6S, 68.1W, marked \u201cR\u201d \non Figure 1) at 1920 UTC on 6 January 2006 and climbed to an altitude of 3000 m \nbefore flying eastwards across the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula. At 2015 \nUTC (approximately 1600 local solar time) the aircraft began a slant descent from this \nlevel to an elevation of 15 m above the ice shelf surface. A series of \u201cL\u201d-shaped level \nlegs, shown on Figure 1, were then flown to characterise the properties of the \nboundary layer. The first leg, flown at an elevation of 15 m, commenced at point \u201cA\u201d \n(67.14S, 61.66W) which is about 50 km west of the ice shelf edge and 130 km east of \nthe eastern foot of the Antarctic Peninsula mountains. From point \u201cA\u201d, the aircraft \nflew approximately northwards for 40 km to point \u201cB\u201d (66.79S, 61.35W), then turned \n90o to the left and continued approximately westward for a further 40 km to point \u201cC\u201d \n(66.69S, 62.22W). Point \u201cC\u201d is approximately 80 km east of the foot of the main \nPeninsula mountain chain but is less than 10 km from Cape Alexander at the tip of  \nthe Churchill Peninsula, a low promontory that extends southeastwards into the \nLarsen Ice Shelf from the main mountain chain. At point \u201cC\u201d, the aircraft ascended to \n152 m and flew the leg in reverse (i.e. C-B-A). The aircraft then flew A-B-C at 305 \nm, followed by C-B-A at 610 m. On reaching point \u201cA\u201d at 2156 UTC, a slant descent \nwas made to 15 m before the aircraft commenced its climb back to 3000 m for the \nreturn flight to Rothera. \n \n 12\n4.2 SYNOPTIC CONDITIONS \n \nSynoptic charts for 6 January 2006 show a weak ridge of  mean sea level \npressure (mslp) to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula and rather small gradients of \nmslp around the study area. Surface observations at the time of the measurements are \nconsistent with this analysis. An automatic weather station on the Larsen Ice Shelf (at \n67.0S, 61.6W) indicated surface winds of  2 \u2013 5 ms-1 from a westerly to northwesterly \ndirection at the time of the aircraft observations while, at Rothera Research Station to \nthe west of the Peninsula, surface winds were light and variable. The 500 hPa level \nanalysis indicated a westerly flow of around 15 ms-1 above the mountains of the \nAntarctic Peninsula, which is consistent with the winds measured at 3000 m during \nthe aircraft transit to the study area. Radiosonde observations from Rothera for 2002-\n2008 indicate that this 500 hPa westerly wind speed is equalled or exceeded for about \n10% of the time during the months of December and January. \nFigure 3 compares the vertical profile of potential temperature obtained during \nthe aircraft's ascent from Rothera (i.e. to the west of the Peninsula mountains) with \nthat obtained during the initial descent to the Larsen Ice Shelf (i.e. to the east of the \nmountains). The atmosphere is stably stratified on both sides of the mountain barrier. \nHowever, at a given level, potential temperatures are higher on the east (downwind) \nside than the west (upwind) side, with the strongest warming on the downwind side \noccurring  below the level of the crest of the Peninsula mountains (about 2000 m at \nthis point). The corresponding relative humidity profiles (not shown) indicate that, \nbelow the height of the mountain barrier, air on the downwind side is significantly \ndrier than air at the same level on the upwind side. \n 13\nThe presence of warmer, drier air on the downwind side of the mountains \nsuggests that a f\u00f6hn  event was in progress at the time of the observations. The Froude \nnumber of the upwind flow, Fr, can be calculated as \n \n5.0)\/\/( \u03b8\u03b8\u0394= ghuFr h        (1) \n \nwhere h is the height of the mountain barrier, uh is the component of windspeed \nperpendicular to the barrier at height h, \u0394\u03b8 is the potential temperature difference \nbetween the surface and height h and \u03b8 is the mean potential temperature. Our \nmeasurements show that Fr was about 0.24. However, the effective value of Fr may \nbe even lower than this since the upstream flow was highly baroclinic, with the \nwesterly component of the wind decreasing towards the surface. At such a low value \nof Fr, classical non-rotating hydraulic theory predicts that flow over the Peninsula \nmountains should be completely blocked. However, Orr et al. (2007) have shown that \nthe influence of the Earth\u2019s rotation can lead to some flow over the Peninsula \nmountains at low values of Fr. At the time of our observations there was clearly some \nairflow across the Peninsula. Adiabatic warming of this air as it subsided to the east of \nthe Peninsula mountains then gave rise to the relatively warm and dry \u201cf\u00f6hn\u201d \nconditions observed over the Larsen Ice Shelf. \n \n \n 14\n \nFigure  3.  Vertical profiles of potential temperature measured during the ascent of the \naircraft from Rothera (thick line) and during the initial descent over the Larsen Ice \nShelf (thin line).  \n \n \n \n 15\n4.3 VERTICAL PROFILES OF THE MEAN FLOW \n \nFigure 4 shows the temperature profile recorded during the lowest 1500 m of the \ninitial descent to point \u201cA\u201d. The most notable feature of this profile is a surface-based \ninversion, extending up to an altitude of around 270 m above the surface of the ice \nshelf. This inversion results from the advection of relatively warm (T > 0 oC) air over \nthe cold surface (T\u2264 0 oC) of the ice shelf. The temperature difference measured \nbetween 270 m and the lowest level reached on the profile (approximately 15 m) is \n2.6 oC. However, given that we would expect the surface of the ice shelf to be close to \nfreezing point, the total inversion strength is probably nearer 4.6 oC. Above the \nsurface inversion, the atmosphere remains stably stratified. \nCorresponding profiles of wind speed and direction are shown in Figure 5. A \nvery sharp low-level jet is present in the lower part of the profile, with a maximum \nrecorded wind speed of about 15 m s-1 at approximately 250m, which corresponds \nclosely to the top of the surface inversion. There is strong directional shear associated \nwith this jet. At the lowest point on the profile, the wind is westerly but becomes \nnearly southerly around the jet maximum. Above the jet, wind speeds are in the range \n8-10 m s-1, blowing from a westerly to southwesterly direction. Also shown on figure \n5 are profiles of wind speed and direction at 1800 UTC as simulated by the Antarctic \nMesoscale Prediction System (AMPS, Bromwich et al., 2005) run at 7 km resolution \nand initialised at 0000 UTC. AMPS captures the structure of the jet quite well, \nalthough it is weaker and shallower than in the observations. We discuss possible \norigins for this jet in section 5 below. \nSome changes are apparent between profiles recorded during the initial descent \nto point \u201cA\u201d and those recorded during the final descent to point \u201cA\u201d at the end of the \n 16\nfinal flight leg. While the sharp jet was still present in the final profile, the jet \nmaximum (reduced to 12 m s-1) rose to 350 m. Potential temperatures in the stable \nlayer increased by about 1oC between the two profiles.  \nA profile of gradient Richardson number, Ri, calculated from the observed wind \nand temperature profiles is shown in Figure 6. As there is significant variation in wind \ndirection through the profile, we calculate Ri  using the magnitude of  vector wind \nshear: \n122 \u2212\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202=\nz\nv\nz\nu\nz\ngRi \u03b8\u03b8        (2) \n \nwhere u and v are respectively the westerly and southerly components of the \nwind speed and \u03b8 is the potential temperature. Vertical gradients of wind components \nand potential temperature were evaluated by fitting piecewise linear functions of \nheight to the measurements over layers of 50 \u2013 100 m thickness. Ri remains small \nfrom the lowest point on the profile upwards through the jet, the strong directional \nshear and extreme sharpness of the jet preventing a singularity at the wind speed \nmaximum. Above the jet, Ri starts to increase, reaching a maximum of around 0.7 at \n850 m. \n 17\n \n \nFigure 4. Temperature profile recorded in the lowest 1500 m of the initial descent to \npoint \u201cA\u201d on the Larsen Ice Shelf. Altitudes in this (and subsequent) figures are \nrelative to the surface of the ice shelf. The thin line indicates the dry adiabiatic lapse \nrate and the dashed lines show the heights at which the level flight legs were flown. \n \nFigure 5.

Gradient Richardson number profile (calculated for layers of 50 \u2013 100 m \nthickness) over the lowest 1500 m of the initial descent to point \u201cA\u201d.  \n \n 19\n4.4 SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS \n \nExamination of the record from the downward-pointing video camera shows \nthat the surface of the ice shelf beneath the flight legs was very uniform apart from \noccasional crevasses. No meltwater ponds were apparent on the camera record, \nsuggesting that melt rates were relatively low at the time of the observations. \nConsistent with these observations, the albedo (Figure 7) shows little variation along \nthe flight track. The surface temperature record from the infrared thermometer (Figure \n7) does, however, reveal some spatial variability. Surface temperatures were close to \n0 oC along most of leg A-B but started to fall as point \u201cB\u201d was approached. Along leg \nB-C, surface temperatures were generally lower (minimum about \u20131 oC) and more \nvariable than along leg A-B, reaching 0 oC only over very short sections of this leg. \nFlight level data show considerable temperature variability at 15 m and \nsomewhat more uniform conditions above this level. Air temperatures at 15m (Figure \n7) were generally around +2 oC and very variable. However, there are two notable \nsections where the air temperature was lower and somewhat less variable. The first of \nthese sections, between 39 and 51 km along the flight track, corresponds \napproximately to a region of reduced surface temperature, while the second, from 66 \nto 74 km, is less clearly associated with surface temperature variations. Both sections \ncorrespond to regions of reduced wind speed at flight level. Air temperatures \nmeasured along the higher legs show much less variability than is seen at 15 m and \nwhat variability there is does not correlate strongly with that at 15 m. \n \n \n 20\n \nFigure 7. Variation along the 15 m flight leg of (a) surface temperature, (b) air \ntemperature at flight level and (c) albedo, all plotted against distance along the flight \ntrack from point \u201cA\u201d. \n \n4.5 TURBULENCE STRUCTURE \n \nTurbulence statistics were calculated over flight segments of approximately 4 \nkm after removing trends over the segment with a second-order polynomial fit. Trials \nwith different segment lengths showed that for segments of less than 1 km, \nmomentum fluxes were significantly reduced while, for segments greater than 4 km, \nturbulence kinetic energy increased as a result of the inclusion of mesoscale motions. \nMean turbulence statistics for each flight leg were then calculated by averaging the \nstatistics from each 4 km segment within a leg. \nFigure 8 shows the profile of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) \n \n)''''''(5.0 wwvvuue ++=   (3) \n 21\n \nwhere u\u2019, v\u2019, and w\u2019 are the fluctuating components of eastwards, northwards \nand upwards velocity, respectively. e is largest along the lowest flight leg and \ndecreases rather slowly with height. The flow is still clearly turbulent at 605 m. This \nis consistent with the profile of gradient Richardson number (Figure 6), which shows \nlow values of Ri persisting up to this level. \n The temperature variance,  \n \n''2 TT\nT\n=\u03c3     (4) \n \nwhere T\u2019 is the fluctuating component of temperature, follows a rather different \nprofile (Figure 8). \u03c3T2 is very large along the lowest flight leg, with smaller, near-\nconstant values measured along the three higher legs. The very high value of \u03c3T2 at 15 \nm may reflect the fact that the vertical temperature gradient at that level is an order of \nmagnitude greater than that at the altitude of the higher legs. Hunt et al. (1985) \nproposed that, under strongly-stable conditions, a robust scaling for temperature \nfluctuations is given by \n \nNzT wTT \/)\/\/( \u03c3\u03b6\u03c3 \u2248\u2202\u2202   (5) \n \nwhere N  is the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency and \u03b6T is a parameter of order unity. \nHunt et al. (1985) found that equation (5) with \u03b6T \u2248 0.8 provided a good fit to data \ncollected under stable conditions from the tower at the Boulder Atmospheric \nObservatory. Values of \u03b6T calculated for the upper three of our flight levels (Figure 9) \nare significantly smaller than the value found by Hunt et al. (1985) and show some \n 22\ntendency to increase with height. The value for the 15 m flight level is closer to Hunt \net al.\u2019s value but is significantly larger than the values we calculate at the three higher \nlevels. As the temperature gradient is so strong close to the ground, it is possible that \nsmall variations in the height of the aircraft above the ground are generating \nadditional variability in the measured temperature that is artificially increasing our \nestimate of \u03c3T at this level. The standard deviation of the absolute altitude of the \naircraft, \u03c3z, as measured by the GPS system, was about 3 m along the 15 m flight level \nand we estimate that the vertical temperature gradient at this level, \u2202T\/\u2202z, is 0.13 K m-\n1. The measured correlation coefficient between temperature and absolute altitude \nalong this leg, rzT , is 0.25 \u00b1 0.08. An estimate of the contribution of aircraft height \nvariations to \u03c3T is given by rzT. \u03c3z.\u2202T\/\u2202z \u2248 0.1 K, which is about one third of the \nmeasured value. We conclude that vertical aircraft motions may be significantly \nenhancing observed temperature variability at 15 m. \nFigure 10 shows the vertical profile of the local friction velocity u*, i.e. the \nsquare root of the magnitude of the kinematic stress, defined through  \n \n25.022\n* )''''( wvwuu +=   (6) \n \nThe profile of u* is similar to that of e, although the measurements appear to \nshow a maximum of u* at the 152 m level. Measurements of u* at  15 m may be \nerroneously low due to a loss of high-frequency covariance resulting from the use of a \nslow-response dynamical pressure sensor on this flight. Calculation of u* for the 15 m \nflight leg from bulk formulae (discussed in section 4.6 below) yields a value of  0.17 \nm s-1, which is more consistent with a value obtained by downward extrapolation of \nmeasurements from the higher flight legs. \n 23\nMean kinematic heat fluxes, ''Tw (Figure 11), are small at all levels and show a \ngreat deal of variability along the flight legs, particularly at the 15 m level. Estimates \nof the sensible heat flux, Hs, along this leg using bulk formulae (see section 4.6) give \nHs=13 \u00b1 5 W m-2, equivalent to a kinematic heat flux of \u20130.001 K m s-1, which is \nsignificantly larger in magnitude than the eddy correlation measurement. It is possible \nthat the temperature fluctuations associated with variations in aircraft height \n(discussed above) may be biasing the eddy correlation estimates of heat flux. \nAccurate measurement of such small heat fluxes by eddy correlation from an airborne \nplatform is quite challenging and it is likely that the discrepancy between the bulk \nformula and eddy correlation estimates of heat flux simply reflect limitations in \noverall system accuracy.  \n 24\n \n \nFigure 8 TKE (triangles) and temperature variance (squares) for the four level flight \nlegs.

Our sign convention is that energy fluxes directed towards \nthe surface are positive. Measurements made along the 15 m flight leg allow us to \nestimate all of the terms on the right hand side of equation (7) and we show mean \nvalues for these fluxes in table 1. Because of concerns over the reliability of eddy-\ncorrelation heat flux measurements for this flight and the lack of fast-response \nhumidity measurements, both Hs and HL were estimated from measurements of wind \nspeed, air temperature and humidity at flight level along with surface temperature \nmeasured by the infrared thermometer using the bulk formulae of King et al. (1996). \nWe assumed that the air at the surface was saturated with respect to ice at the \nmeasured surface temperature and, in accordance with measurements over other \nAntarctic ice shelves (e.g., King, 1990) we set the roughness lengths for both \nmomentum and scalars to 0.0001 m .  \nAlong the 15 m leg, the net shortwave flux was positive but relatively small due \nto the high albedo of the ice shelf surface. The albedo (0.78) is typical of that \nmeasured over snow surfaces in the warmer regions of the Antarctic (e.g. van den \nBroeke et al., 2004). Gain of energy by shortwave radiation exceeded longwave loss \n 27\nby 48 W m-2. Sensible heat flux contributed a further 13 W m-2 to the energy available \nfor melting but this was largely balanced by an upwards latent heat flux of 9 W m-2. \nHs  and HL both varied considerably along the flight leg, largely as a result of \nvariations in the air-to-surface temperature difference (see Figure 7). The relatively \nlarge negative latent heat fluxes resulted from the low humidity of the near-surface air \nwhich originated at upper levels and descended in the f\u00f6hn flow. \nSumming these fluxes gives M = 52 W m-2. If the upper part of the ice shelf is \nisothermal at the melting point, all of this energy will be used to drive melting, giving \nan equivalent melt rate of 13 mm of water per day. The peak melt rate during this day \nwas probably somewhat higher since the flight took place approximately 4 hours after \nlocal apparent noon, when SW\u2193 would have reached its peak. \n 28\n \n \nFlux Mean (W m-2) Standard deviation (W m-2) \nSW\u2193 568 7 \nSW\u2191 \u2013441 7 \nSWnet= SW\u2193+ SW\u2191 127 3 \n\u03b1 = SW\u2191\/ SW\u2193 0.78 0.01 \nLW\u2193 237 5 \nLW\u2191 \u2013316 4 \nLWnet= LW\u2193+ LW\u2191 \u201379 4 \nRnet= SWnet+LWnet 48 6 \nHs 13 5 \nHL \u20139 5 \nM=Rnet+Hs+HL 52 4 \n \nTable 1. Components of the surface energy balance along the 15 m flight leg. \n \n \n 29\n5. Discussion \n \nOur measurements reveal that, on 6 January 2006, warm air advection \nassociated with a f\u00f6hn event generated a stable boundary layer (SBL) over the Larsen \nIce Shelf. While the depth of the surface inversion ( ~ 250 m) was comparable with \nthat seen in nocturnal boundary layers with moderate wind speeds, the depth of the \nSBL, as defined by the TKE profile, exceeded 600 m. The persistence of turbulence \nup to such high levels was explained by the presence of strong vertical shear in the \nhorizontal wind vector, associated with a strong low-level jet (15 m s-1 maximum \nwind speed at 250 m elevation). This wind shear maintained a gradient Richardson \nnumber of less than 0.3 throughout the lowest 600 m despite the presence of a strong \nstable potential temperature gradient. \nThe mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of the jet are \nnot immediately apparent from our measurements. Low-level jets are a common \nfeature of nocturnal SBLs (e.g. Banta et al., 2006), where they develop as a result of \ninertial adjustment of the wind profile to changing turbulent transport (Thorpe and \nGuymer, 1977), sometimes with additional forcing from baroclinicity and cold-air \ndrainage effects (Caughey et al., 1979; King, 1989). While our measurements show \nconsiderable mesoscale variability in the structure of the jet, there is no clear \nindication of rotation of the wind vector along a flow line that would be suggestive of \ninertial adjustment as the flow leaves the Peninsula mountains and moves eastward \nacross the Larsen Ice Shelf. Another possibility is that the jet is driven by the \ninteraction of the large-scale flow with the mountain barrier. The westerly flow \nprevailing at the time of our observations would not support the barrier jet described \nby Parish (1983). However, Orr et al. (2007) note the formation of a strong, southerly \n 30\n\u201clee jet\u201d in laboratory and numerical modelling studies of stratified, rotating westerly \nflow across the Antarctic Peninsula. We have already noted that the structure of the \njet is reproduced well by the AMPS forecast model. On the day of our observations, \nAMPS fields show a low-level westerly jet over the eastern slopes of the Antarctic \nPeninsula mountains associated with strong downslope f\u00f6hn flow. Over much of the \nregion the jet does not extend beyond the foot of the mountains. However, in the area \nof our aircraft measurements, the pressure gradient associated with a mesoscale low \npressure system centred around 68oS, 55oW supports propagation of the jet away from \nthe mountains and across the Larsen Ice Shelf. We therefore conclude that the jet \nresults from a combination of orographic forcing and synoptic support. \nThe jet appears to play an important role in determining the turbulent structure \nof the boundary layer by maintaining strong wind shear throughout a relatively deep \nlayer. Mahrt and Vickers (2002) identified two contrasting forms of SBL: \n\u201ctraditional\u201d, where shear production of TKE is greatest close to the ground and TKE \ndecreases with height, and \u201cupside-down\u201d, where there is shear production associated \nwith an elevated jet and TKE increases with height below the jet maximum. Despite \nthe presence of a strong elevated jet, turbulence structure in our SBL most closely \nresembles that of the \u201ctraditional\u201d SBL, with a TKE maximum close to the ground. \nUnlike the \u201cupside-down\u201d cases studied by Mahrt and Vickers (2002) and Banta et al. \n(2006), we observe strong shear throughout the layer between the ground and the jet \nmaximum. The Richardson number remains low throughout this layer and there does \nnot appear to be any decoupling of the ground-based shear layer and the shear layer \njust below the jet maximum. \nOur measurements reveal significant spatial and temporal variability in \nboundary layer structure, particularly at the lowest flight level. Although the surface \n 31\ntemperature measurements indicate a small degree of inhomogeneity, temperature \nvariations at the lowest flight level are much larger than those at the surface and \nprobably reflect mesoscale variability of the flow rather than surface variability. Such \nmesoscale complexity is a well-known feature of SBLs over somewhat inhomgeneous \nterrain, such as the SBLs observed during the CASES-99 study (Poulos et al., 2002). \nOur measurements, made over a very level and uniform surface, suggest that some of \nthe observed mesoscale variability is an intrinsic feature of the SBL and is not linked \nto surface inhomogeneity. This view is supported by observations of SBLs at Halley \nResearch Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf, that also show considerable mesoscale \ncomplexity despite the uniformity of the underlying surface (Anderson, 2003). \nAt the time of our measurements, a net energy flux of 52 W m-2 was available \nfor melting the ice shelf . The greatest contribution (92%) to the melt rate comes from \nthe net radiative flux. Sensible heat flux contributes about 25% of the total melt rate \nbut this is largely balanced by the latent heat flux, which removes heat equivalent to \n17% of the melt rate from the surface. The measured net energy flux is equivalent to a \nmelt rate of approximately 13 mm water equivalent per day. However, as there will be \na strong diurnal cycle in the radiative fluxes, the daily averaged melt rate is likely to \nbe considerably lower than this. van den Broeke (2005) made climatological estimates \nof melt rate over the Larsen Ice Shelf using measurements from an automatic weather \nstation (AWS) together with simple parametrisations for the radiative and turbulent \nenergy fluxes. He found that melt rate was a strong function of surface wind direction, \nwith the largest average melt rates (3 \u2013 4 mm day-1) occurring for winds from the \nnorthwesterly sector. Melt energy calculated from the AWS shows a strong diurnal \ncycle, with M typically around 50 W m-2 at the time of day (1600 local solar time) of \nour measurements (M. van den Broeke, personal communication, 2007). Our \n 32\nmeasurements of melt energy thus appear to be broadly consistent with climatological \nestimates from AWS data.  \nAs no humidity measurements were available from the AWS, van den Broeke \n(2005) was unable to calculate the contribution of the latent heat flux to the melt rate. \nOur results suggest that, under f\u00f6hn conditions, the near-surface air is very dry and \nthere is near balance between the (downwards) sensible heat flux and (upwards) latent \nheat flux. The melt rates calculated by van den Broeke (2005) are thus likely to \noverestimate M by around 20% under such circumstances. Improved AWS \nmeasurements, including humidity measurements, are needed to provide better \nclimatological estimates of melt rates in this region. Further aircraft measurements \nwill help to clarify how the melt rates are controlled by the large-scale atmospheric \nflow.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nProcurement and installation of the Twin Otter instrumentation was managed by \nM.
