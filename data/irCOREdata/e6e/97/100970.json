INTRODUCTION\nTHE ever-increasing number of wireless communicationstandards being applied to handheld devices has created a\nneed for integrated antennas operating in ten or more distinct\nfrequency bands [1]. Also, there is a trend toward highly inte-\ngrated devices that are slimmer, smaller, and lighter than those\nin current use. However, this creates problem for the antenna\ndesigner, since he is limited by fundamental relationships\nbetween antenna size, bandwidth, and efficiency [2]. Thus, cov-\nering a single very wide frequency band, or multiple frequency\nbands, whilst maintaining small size and high efficiency is\nmajor challenge to the designer. To some extent the problem\nof covering wide bandwidths can be overcome through the use\nof multiple antennas, but then mutual coupling between the\nindividual antennas may cause severe problems.\nRecent studies of handset antennas have mainly focused on\nsmall, wideband or multiband antenna solutions. However, an-\nManuscript received April 26, 2007; revised November 7, 2007.

Whilst this kind of antenna will not\ncover all the frequency bands simultaneously, it may provide\nseveral dynamically selectable narrow frequency bands and,\nwithin these bands, exhibit higher efficiency than is achievable\nwith conventional antenna solutions [3]. This approach may be\nused to downsize the antennas whilst maintaining the operating\nbandwidth or, alternatively, to increase the bandwidth of the\nantenna without increasing the physical size. In addition, the\nantenna tuning can be used to compensate for proximity effects\nthat occur when the operating frequencies of handset antennas\nare detuned by the proximity of the user or by changes in\nthe operating environment, such as occur when opening and\nclosing a clamshell or a swivel- type mobile phone [1], [4]. In\na wider context, frequency-tunable antennas are used in space\nand military applications and are proposed as one of the key\nenablers for the futures software defined radios [3], [5]\u2013[7].\nHowever, there are some conceivable drawbacks to frequency\ntunable antennas, which exhibit high RF power loss, limited\npower handling capability, poor linearity, and especially high\ndc power consumption of active tuning circuit components. It\nshould also be noted that these antennas are often complicated\nstructures to design and implement, which may have cost\nand reliability implications. Withstanding these limitations,\nfrequency tunable antennas provide significant technical and\neconomic advantages over their conventional counterparts.\nPlanar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) are among the most\nwidely used antennas in mobile terminals. PIFAs can be\nmodified to operate over multiple frequency bands by using,\nfor example, parasitic antenna elements and\/or slitting the\nantenna element to form several paths for surface currents.\nRecently, PIFA structures covering the frequency range of six\ntelecommunication standards have been reported [8], [9]. A\ncommon approach to tuning the operating frequency of a PIFA\nis to electrically reconfigure a short circuit connection with an\nexternal tuning circuit. This has been used for single-band and\ndual-band antennas [10]\u2013[13]. Other previously reported tuning\nmethods include the use of an adjustable reactive component\nbetween a PIFA patch and a ground plane [10], [14], [15],\nor switched tuning stubs, which have been applied in both\nsingle-band and dual-band PIFAs [16], [17]. In these tuning\nmethods, the tuning circuit is separated from the antenna and\nbuilt either next to, or under, the antenna element. Tunable\nantennas implemented in this way utilize separate dc wiring for\ncontrolling the state of the RF switches or variable capacitors.\nThese wires, like any metal objects located in the vicinity of an\nantenna, may cause severe performance degradation, such as\n0018-926X\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Dual-band PIFA with an integrated tuning circuit. Dimensions are in\nmm.\ndeformation of the radiation pattern and undesired resonances\n[18]. Furthermore, external tuning circuits increase the overall\nsize of the antenna.\nThe tuning method presented in this paper is based on lo-\ncating a RF switch directly in an antenna element. Unlike the sit-\nuations proposed in [19], [20], no separate dc control circuit for\nthe switch is used. The tuning circuit is integrated using reactive\npassive components that form separate paths for the RF signal\nand dc control voltage. The dc voltage is carried to the switch\nsimultaneously with the RF signal. The proposed tuning method\nhas been demonstrated with a single-feed dual-band PIFA op-\nerating in four distinct frequency bands. The antenna is tuned\nwith a RF PIN diode switch and covers the frequency ranges\nappropriate to the GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, PCS1900,\nand UMTS telecommunication standards. In order to investi-\ngate the effects of the tuning circuit on the antenna\u2019s radiation\npattern and efficiency, a similar reference antenna, but without\nthe tuning circuit, was also fabricated and tested.\nSection II of this paper describes the new tuning method, and\nprovides details of the new antenna structure. Following this\nin Section III the measured return losses, total efficiencies and\nradiation patterns of both the tunable antenna and the reference\nantenna are presented. Finally, discussions and conclusions are\ngiven in Sections IV and V.\nII. ANTENNA STRUCTURE\nFig. 1 depicts the layout of a coaxial probe-fed dual-band\nPIFA. The structure incorporates an antenna element, feeding\nand short circuit pins, a RF diode switch, an inductor and two\ncapacitors, as illustrated. The antenna is of a well-known PIFA\ntype [17], [21], [22]. The rectangular patch is slit to form two\nseparate paths for resonating currents, and this leads to dual-\nband operation. The antenna element is built on a 0.8 mm thick\nR4003C printed circuit board ( , at 10\nGHz) with 35 thick copper metallization. The antenna ele-\nment has a 9.2 mm thick air substrate and it is placed on top of a\n45 mm 110 mm reverse side grounded R4003C PCB. The ge-\nometrical dimensions and the values of the passive components\nwere obtained by designing the antenna structure with the aid of\ncommercial EM software, namely Ansoft HFSS V. 10.\nThe short circuit point is separated from the rest of the an-\ntenna element metallization by a narrow L-shaped slit. In order\nto generate a dc potential difference across the diode, two ca-\npacitors and an inductor are\nconnected in parallel with the slit. The capacitors, with low im-\npedances at RF, act as a dc block and an RF short, and thus allow\nRF currents to flow freely in the antenna element. The inductor\nwith high RF impedance blocks the RF signal and passes the dc.\nThe dc voltage can be brought to the diode with the RF signal,\nso that there is a dc potential difference is between the feed and\nthe short circuit pins. Consequently, changing the polarity of the\ndc voltage to produce either a forward bias (switch ON) or a re-\nverse bias (switch OFF) condition for the diode will control the\nswitch impedance.\nThe RF PIN diode is used here as a switch having either very\nhigh or low impedance depending on the applied dc bias. A\ncomprehensive description of the principle of operation of the\nRF PIN diode switch and its use in frequency tuning of PIFAs\nhas been presented by Louhos and Pankinaho in [10]. Further-\nmore, in the aforementioned paper a complete equivalent cir-\ncuit for RF PIN diode switch, including the package parasitics,\nwas presented. However, in the current work, simplified com-\nponent models are used for describing the switch. In the for-\nward biased state (ON state), the diode is assumed to act as an\nalmost pure ohmic resistance and is modeled by a simple re-\nsistor. The reverse biased diode (OFF state) is assumed to act as\na very small capacitance, which thus represents high impedance\nwhich in turn can regarded almost as an open circuit for RF fre-\nquencies. Use of different kinds of simplified diode models has\npreviously reported [16], [23], [24] and they are able to predict\nthe return losses of the tunable antenna with a reasonable accu-\nracy, as will be shown later in this paper.\nIn the simulation model, the diode was modeled with a RLC\nboundary sheet with 2 ohm resistance in the ON state and a 0.15\npF capacitance in the OFF state. These values are the same as\nthose given for an Infineon BAR50-02V RF PIN diode switch.\nAccording to the manufacturer\u2019s data sheet, the diode switch has\nabout 0.3 dB of insertion loss (with 10 mA dc current) in the for-\nward bias state and OFF-state isolation better than 20 dB over a\nfrequency range up to 2 GHz [25]. Values given in the datasheet\nare, however, referred to 50 impedance. The passive compo-\nnents were modeled with sheets having adequate capacitance\nand inductance values. The simulated return losses ( in dB)\nof the tunable antenna are presented in Fig. 2.\nThe simulations showed resonances at 890 MHz and 1770\nMHz while the switch was ON. The corresponding frequencies\nin the OFF state were 930 and 1960 MHz, respectively. The si-\nmultaneous frequency shift of both frequency bands can be ex-\nplained by using the simulator to display the surface currents on\nthe antenna, as shown in Fig. 3.\nIn the lower frequency band, actual switching occurs and a\nlarge amount of current flows through the diode in the ON state,\nand almost no current passes through the diode in the OFF state.\nHence, frequency tuning of the lower band is simply based on\nmodifying the length of the current path. The amount of current\nthrough the diode is smaller in the upper band than in the lower\nband. This indicates that the function of the switch is to load the\nantenna by changing the coupling between the two resonators\nseparated by the narrow slit. When the switch is ON, strong sur-\nface currents occupy a larger area compared that for the OFF\nstate, thus the resonant frequency is lower in the ON state.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Furthermore, in tunable antennas efficiency deterioration\ncaused by the tuning circuits, can be one of the major draw-\nbacks. So as to address these issues, the electrical performance\nof the frequency tunable PIFA was characterized in terms of\nmeasured return loss, total efficiency, maximum radiation effi-\nciency and far-field radiation patterns. The same measurements\nwere also performed for the reference antenna.\nA. Return Loss\nA coaxial bias-T component was connected to a vector net-\nwork analyzer that provided the dc control voltage for the switch\nduring the return loss measurement. The ON and OFF conditions\nfor the switch were obtained using 1 V (with a 20 mA forward\ncurrent), respectively, to create the forward and reverse bias for\nthe diode. The measured and simulated return losses of the tun-\nable antenna are presented in Fig. 5. The simulation results are\nthe same as in the Fig. 2.\nWhen the switch is ON the resonances are at 854 and 1770\nMHz. The antenna covers the frequency ranges of the GSM850\n(824\u2013894 MHz) and GSM1800 (1710\u20131880 MHz) bands within\nat least a 3 dB impedance bandwidth. When the switch is OFF\nthe resonant frequencies are 931 and 2025 MHz. The GSM900\n(880\u2013960 MHz) and UMTS (1920\u20132170 MHz) bands are thus\ncovered. The PCS1900 (1850\u20131990 MHz) band is between the\noperating frequencies, so that the RX and TX portions are sep-\narated.\nThe simulated and measured return losses of the reference\nantenna are presented in Fig. 6. The antenna resonates at 815 and\n1800 MHz. Compared with the tunable antenna in the ON state,\nslight upward frequency shifts of 40 and 30 MHz were observed\nfor the lower and upper resonant frequencies, respectively.\nThe agreement between the simulated and measured results\nwas generally very good. However, there are small frequency\nshifts between the simulated and measured return losses of the\ntunable antenna. These frequency shifts are 40 MHz in the\nlower band in the switch ON-state and 65 MHz in the upper\nband in the switch OFF-state. However, the very good agreement\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:59 from IEEE Xplore.

Simulated and measured return loss of the reference antenna without\nthe tuning circuit.\nbetween the simulated and measured data for the reference an-\ntenna suggests that the frequency shifts observed for the tun-\nable antenna can be attributed to the inaccuracy of the compo-\nnent models used, or possible fabrication and assembly errors. It\nshould be noted that no account was taken of the parasitic com-\nponents, such as lead inductance and packaging capacitance, as-\nsociated with the PIN diode, and at the higher frequencies these\nparasitics could significantly affect the diode impedances in the\nON and OFF states.

The mea-\nsured total efficiencies of the tunable antenna are presented in\nFig. 7.\nThe results show peak values of 68% and 88% in the switched\nON state and 65% and 85% in the OFF state.

Measured far-field radiation patterns at the center operating frequencies of the tunable antenna and the reference antenna without the tuning circuit.\na good impedance match, with better than 16 dB.\nThus the maximum total antenna efficiencies are nearly equal\nto the maximum radiation efficiencies, which are 69% and 88%\nin the switched ON state, and 65% and 87% in the OFF state.\nThe measured total efficiency of the reference antenna is pre-\nsented in Fig. 8.\nThe result shows peak total efficiency values of 80% for the\nlower band and 95% for the upper band. Both antennas are built\nwith low loss dielectrics, mainly air and partly R4003C PCB. In\naddition, highly conducting copper metallization was used. As\na consequence, the dielectric and metallic losses were assumed\nto be small. Thus the reference antenna has high radiation ef-\nficiency, with peak values of 84% and 95%. Finally, radiation\nefficiency deterioration caused by the tuning circuit can be esti-\nmate at less than 20% for the lower bands and less than 10% for\nthe upper bands. No appreciable difference in the efficiencies\nbetween the switched ON state and the switched OFF state was\nobserved.\nC. Radiation Pattern\nThe measured far-field radiation patterns at the center oper-\nating frequencies of both antennas are presented in Fig. 9. The\npatterns of the lower frequency bands are near omni-directional\nand exhibit similarities with the pattern of a dipole antenna. The\nmaximum lower band gain values of the tunable antenna are\n1.8 dBi in the ON state and 2.2 dBi in the OFF state. The corre-\nsponding value for the reference antenna is 2.5 dBi. The antenna\nis able to maintain the shape of the patterns despite the presence\nand use of the tuning circuit. The patterns of the upper bands\nwere found to be more directional, with maximum gains of 4\ndBi (switch ON), 3.6 dBi (switch OFF) and 4.3 dBi (reference\nantenna). The upper band radiation patterns for the reference\nantenna and the switched ON tunable antenna are quite similar.\nThe use of the tuning circuit, however, slightly tilts the pattern\nin OFF state. This can be seen best from the radiation plot in the\nXY plane, Fig. 9. Nevertheless, the antenna is able to maintain\nits efficiency and there is little degradation in the direction of\nradiation.\nThe essentially constant, dipole-like radiation patterns in the\nlower frequency bands can be attributed to the significant effect\nof ground plane radiation. It has been established in the literature\nthat so-called chassis wave modes have a dominant radiation\ncontribution in mobile phone antennas operating near the 900\nMHz range [27]. At frequencies near 2 GHz, more radiation\noriginates from the antenna element, and thus the antenna is\nmore directional, and a slight tilt in the upper band patterns tends\nto occur when the antenna is tuned.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

DISCUSSION\nThe novel frequency tuning method presented in this paper\nhas several beneficial features. The integrated tuning circuit al-\nlows greater independent design between the antenna and the\nrest of the device when compared with external tuning circuit\ntechniques. This is because no parts of the tuning circuit, except\nfor the bias-T for combining RF and dc, are situated outside the\nantenna element. Moreover, the method enables simultaneous\ntuning of several frequency bands, and the tuning circuit can be\nmade of standard low-cost components. Another important fea-\nture related to the new method is its potential for maintaining\nhigh total antenna efficiency, both in terms of a good impedance\nmatch and high radiation efficiency.\nIn principle, the proposed concept can be extended to any\nkind of PIFA structure as well as other antenna types with a\nshort circuit connection, such as IFAs and shorted monopole an-\ntennas. Replacing the RF diode with a very low loss RF MEMS\nswitch may further increase the electrical performance of the an-\ntenna. In addition, RF varactors are potential candidates for pro-\nviding continuous frequency tuning over the desired frequency\nband. Use of multiple switches or varactors in the same an-\ntenna element may also be considered to yield more versatile\nfunctions, such as greater sub-division of the overall frequency\nband, and also independent tuning of one or more sub-bands in\na multiband antenna.\nA valid performance comparison of different tuning methods\nfor PIFAs is difficult, because a limited amount of efficiency\ndata is available. Nevertheless, by using switchable tuning stubs,\nradiation efficiencies between 80\u201395% have been achieved [16],\n[17]. Also, significant 50\u201360% drops in radiation efficiency,\ncaused by the tuning circuits, have been reported for different\ntuning methods [10]. Essential system-level requirements, such\nas linearity and power handling capability of the active com-\nponents, have to be considered when dealing with electrically\ntunable antennas. Ollikainen et al. in [16] presented a compre-\nhensive study of single-band PIFAs that were tuned with switch-\nable tuning stubs. The antennas operated near 900 MHz and had\ntuning circuit components quite similar to the ones presented in\nthis paper. It was shown that the antenna had very low distortion\nand it was capable of handling high power levels (30 dBm).\nFor completeness, other important requirements such as\nswitching time and dc power consumption, need to be consid-\nered. All of these issues are highly dependent on the system\nspecifications and the properties of the selected active tuning\ncircuit components. Whilst these aspects need further inves-\ntigation, they do not detract from the essential merits of the\nproposed new technique.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA novel frequency tuning method for planar inverted-F an-\ntennas has been proposed, and validated through practical mea-\nsurement. In this method, the tuning circuit is built into the an-\ntenna element by using discrete reactive passive components to\nform separate paths for the RF signal and the dc voltage, the\nlatter being used to control the state of the active component.\nThe dc voltage is applied to the antenna with the RF signal, and\nthe tuning circuit is completely integrated. The effectiveness of\nthe tuning method was demonstrated with a single-feed dual-\nband PIFA tuned with a RF PIN diode switch to operate in four\nfrequency bands. The antenna covers the frequency ranges of the\nGSM1800, PCS1900 and UMTS telecommunication standards\nwith a 65% total antenna efficiency margin. The total efficiency\ncoverage of the GSM900 and GSM850 bands are 50% and 40%,\nrespectively.\nIn order to investigate impact of the tuning circuit on the\nantenna\u2019s radiation pattern and efficiency, a reference antenna\nwithout the tuning circuit was fabricated and measured. It was\nshown that the tuning circuit reduces the radiation efficiency by\nless than 20% in the lower bands and less than 10% in the upper\nbands. The radiation patterns of the lower frequency bands re-\nmain essentially unchanged, despite the presence and use of the\ntuning circuit. However, in the upper band a slight tilt in the pat-\ntern occurs when the antenna is tuned.\nThe proposed frequency-tuning concept can be extended\nto more complex PIFA structures as well as other antenna\ntypes. Instead of the RF diode switch, RF MEMS components\nor RF varactors may used to further improve the electrical\nperformance and functionality of the antennas.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe industrial partners of the TAMTAM technology project\nare acknowledged.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.
