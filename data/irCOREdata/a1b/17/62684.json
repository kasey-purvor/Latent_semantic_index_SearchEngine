Deciduous woodlands are a key habitat for the diversity of invertebrates within \nthe primarily agricultural landscape of lowland Scotland.  Little is known, \nhowever, of the contribution that within site heterogeneity plays in \nmaintaining invertebrate diversity within these habitats.  We consider how \nhabitat heterogeneity affects the beech leaf-mining weevil Rhynchaenus fagi \nL. (Curculionidae, Coleoptera) and its associated polyphagous parasitoids.   \n2. This was done by investigating host density and parasitism rates of the weevil \nas it fed on 88 beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L. (Fagaceae)) occurring in \npatches within a birch woodland. We aimed to assess how patch site, isolation \nand patch quality influenced parasitism rates and parasitoid diversity. \n3. Herbivore leaf-mine abundance was greatest where beech trees were located \non the edge.  Parasitism rates were also affected by the location of the host \ninsect at the woodland edge and interior. Depending on parasitoid species \nidentity, parasitism rates showed independent, direct, and inverse responses to \nthe density of leaf-mines.  Parasitism rates showed direct and inverse \nresponses to the patch sizes of beech trees, while overall parasitoid diversity \nwas negatively correlated with patch size. \n4. Heterogeneity in the location of the beech trees within this birch woodland \nplays a key role in determining local patterns of parasitism rates and parasitoid \ndiversity.  It is suggested that within site variation in the area of high quality \nresource patches, represented by the beech trees, was key to structuring these \nparasitoid communities.

These \nwoodlands are often situated predominantly within areas arable or improved \ngrassland, and represent long-lived habitat features that can provide important refuges \nmany invertebrates in an otherwise intensively managed landscape (Petit & Usher, \n1998; Vanbergen et al., 2005).    While agro-forestry also represents a major \ncomponent of forest cover in Scotland, such forests are predominantly composed of \nnon-native conifers and represent low quality habitats for the majority of native \nwoodland invertebrates (Watt et al., 1998).    \nWhile the availability of deciduous woodlands has been shown to be a key \ncomponents to the maintenance of invertebrate diversity within agricultural \nlandscapes (Woodcock et al., 2003a; Vanbergen et al., 2005), little is known about the \nrole that within site heterogeneity plays in the maintenance of insect populations.  \nThis study aims to assess the effect of heterogeneity in habitat structure on the \ndiversity and numerical response of a suite of polyphagous hymenopteran parasitoids \nutilizing a monophagous leaf-mining beetle host.  Habitat complexity is known to \naffect the capacity of parasitoids to disperse between host populations and so is of \ngreat importance in determining their population structure (Kareiva, 1987; Cronin & \nStrong, 1999).  For example, reduced rates of parasitism for some parasitoids have \nbeen recorded in spatially complex habitats (Gols et al., 2005).  How these factors \ncontribute to determining species abundance and overall diversity is an important \n 3\n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \nfactor in understanding the role of deciduous woodlands within agricultural \nlandscapes for maintaining invertebrate diversity. \nIn this study, populations of the beech leaf-miner - Rhynchaenus fagi - and its \nassociated parasitoids were sampled from small patches of beech trees distributed in \ndiscrete clumps throughout a predominantly birch woodland (Betula spp. \n(Betulaceae)).  As tertiary trophic levels are often more susceptible to habitat \nfragmentation than secondary consumers (Kareiva, 1987; Tscharntke & Brandl, \n2004), we assessed the impacts of beech tree isolation and patch size on the \nparasitoids of R. fagi.  This reflects the assumption that patch size will affect both the \nprobability of local extinction, with smaller populations generally being at greater risk \n(Pimm et al., 1988; Cronin, 2003). In addition to the impact of patch size and isolation \nwe also investigated the role that R. fagi host density and environmental conditions \nassociated with these patches has on both rates of parasitism and overall parasitoid \ndiversity.  We predict that: 1) small and isolated parches of beech trees would provide \nrefuges for the host insect R. fagi from its parasitoids, resulting in low levels of \nparasitism and parasitoid diversity; 2) This response would be modulated by the \nlocation in relation to major environmental gradients (e.g. the woodland edge) and \npatch quality in terms of R. fagi host density. \n \nMethods \n \nStudy site \n \nThe study site was undertaken within a single deciduous woodland (0.28 km2) \nstand in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, Scotland (57\u00b004\u2019N, 2\u00b032\u2019W).  The woodland was \ndominated (>80% of the total area) by two species of birch (Betula pendula Roth and \n 4\nBetula pubescens Ehrh.) with occasional patches of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).   \nGrasses, particularly Holcus spp., Festuca spp. and Deschampsia spp. occurred \nthroughout the understorey.  Interspersed into this birch woodland were 88 beech trees \n(Fig. 1), the host-plant of the monophagous leaf-mining weevil R. fagi.  The woodland \nwas surrounded by either Scots pine dominated plantation, or adjoining the North-\nEast edge of the woodland plantation that had been clear felled in 1998.  Within a 2 \nkm radius of the study site there were no other patches of deciduous woodland. \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n \nTri-trophic system \n \nRhynchaenus fagi is a univoltine leaf-mining weevil which feeds as larvae \nexclusively on beech trees, although adults will feed on a variety of plants (Bale & \nLuff, 1978).  Adult weevils over winter primarily within leaf litter (Bale, 1984) until \nmid-March, when the majority of adults will migrate to beech trees just prior to bud-\nburst.  Eggs are laid in the leaf mid-rib from where a linear blotch-mine develops, \nwithin which the larvae feed on both the palisade and spongy parenchyma (Nielsen, \n1966).  From oviposition to emergence of the weevil takes approximately 30-35 days, \nwith adults appearing towards the end of June (Bale & Luff, 1978).  Rhynchaenus fagi \nis recorded as host to ten species of chalcid wasps (Askew & Shaw, 1974) as well as \nat least one braconid (Day & Watt, 1989). \nThe three dominant species of hymenopteran parasitoids reared from R. fagi in \nthis study were all polyphagous species recorded as utilising leaf-mining insects on a \nvariety of deciduous trees, including Salix spp. (Salicaceae), Quercus spp (Fagaceae), \nFagus spp. (Fagaceae) and Betula spps (Betulaceae) (Askew & Shaw, 1974; Rott & \nGodfray, 2000).   Pnigalio longulus (Zett.) (Eulophidae) and Chrysocharis nephereus \n(Walker) (Eulophidae) are common parasitoids of many species of leaf-mining insects \n 5\n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \nincluding moths (Lepidoptera:  Eriocraniidae, Gracillariidae and Nepticulidae), \nsawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) and weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) \n(Askew & Shaw, 1974).  Both species are likely to be multivoltine (Raske, 1978; \nPschorn-Walcher & Heitland, 2000). Colastes braconius Haliday (Braconidae) is a \nmultivoltine species (Wharton, 1993) known to parasitize a wide range of leaf-mining \nhosts, including both moths and weevils (Day & Watt, 1989; Rott & Godfray, 2000).  \nBoth P. longulus and C. braconius have ectoparasitic larval stages, while C. \nnephereus is an endoparasite (Rott & Godfray, 2000).  All three species are idiobionts \nwith clutch sizes of one (Rott & Godfray, 2000).   Records for all three of these \nspecies suggest that they are normally associated with woodland habitats, although \nmay be found on trees in more open situations where their hosts are present (Askew & \nShaw, 1974; Day & Watt, 1989; Casas, 1990; Rott & Godfray, 2000; Jordano, 2003).  \nIn addition to the R. fagi hosts considered in this paper, leaf-miners of the Eriocrania \nspp. (Lepidoptera: Eriocraniidae) and Phyllonorycter spp. (Lepidoptera: \nGracillariidae) were also found on birch trees within the woodland.  This leaf-mining \ninsects would also have provided potential hosts for these parasitoids (Askew & \nShaw, 1974).  The densities of both of these moth species were, however, much lower \nthan those of the R. fagi on beech trees. Other than the birch and beech trees no other \nspecies of broad leafed trees were found within the woodland.  The understory \nvegetation was dominated by grasses which do not support hosts of these parasitoids \n(Askew & Shaw, 1974; Rott & Godfray, 2000).  Previous studies in Scottish beech \nwoodlands have also found these same three species of parasitoids on R. fagi (Day & \nWatt, 1989).   \n \nHost-plant variables \n \n 6\nFor each of the 88 beech trees present within the woodland the following \nmeasurements were taken.  Tree trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) and canopy \ndiameter (mean of 2 measures per tree) were measured for each of the 88 beech trees \nin the woodland.  The individual canopy diameter of each tree was then used to \ncalculate the canopy area of beech habitat patches (PATCH).  Such patches were \nrepresented by both individual trees and clumps of trees whose canopies overlapped \nto provide a continuous patch of beech canopy to dispersing R. fagi.  As some beech \ntrees occurred on the edge of the woodland adjoining areas of clear-cut coniferous \nplantation forestry, trees were categorised as being either woodland edge or interior \n(EDGE). During winter 2005, so that tree foliage would not interfere with satellite \nreception, geographical co-ordinates of each tree were obtained with a GPS (Garmin \n12). Using the latitude and longitude of each tree the Euclidean distance between trees \nwas calculated. The Euclidean distance to the nearest neighbouring beech tree (DIST) \nwas then included in models as a measure of tree isolation (Hanski et al., 1994).  \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n \nInsect sampling \n \nSampling was carried out between 15-18\/6\/2005, towards the end of R. fagi \nlarval development at this site (pers. obs. BAW).  A branch was excised from both the \nNorth and South aspect of each of the 88 beech trees at a height of between 1.5 and \n4.0 m off the ground.  The proportion of leaves mined by R. fagi was calculated based \non a random sample of 100 leaves from each tree, 50 leaves taken from one of two \nrandomly chosen branches. \nA sub-sample of ten randomly chosen leaves, each containing a single \noccupied R. Fagi leaf-mine, were removed from both the North and South aspect of \neach tree (20 leaves per tree, 1760 leaves in total).  In all cases mines were checked to \n 7\nconfirm that they contained larvae of R. fag by holding the mines up to direct sunlight.  \nThe sub-samples from each tree (n = 10 x 2) were placed into plastic pots covered \nwith fine netting and subsequently kept in an open-air insectary adjacent to the \nwoodland.  This maintained a similar temperature and humidity regime to that of the \nadjoining woodland.  Every two days the leaves were checked and emerging adult R. \nfagi and parasitoids were removed and transferred to 70 % alcohol.  Inspection of the \nmines continued for a 4-week period after the last emergence of either the host or \nparasitoids.  All parasitoids were subsequently identified to species and compared to \nreference material at the Hope Entomological Collection, Oxford.   \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \nAs R. fagi leaf-mines were collected over a relatively short period (four days) \nthis may have led to an underestimation of parasitism rates, particularly where \nparasitoid species attacked late instars in their host\u2019s development.  As all three \nparasitoids of this study were idiobionts and so associated with later instars of larval \ndevelopment this was a potential bias in the sampling method (Rott & Godfray, 2000; \nGrabenweger, 2003). However, underestimation of parasitism rates were likely to be \nminimal as the collection of R. fagi leaf-mines coincided with the latter stages of \nlarval development towards the end of June (Bale & Luff, 1978).  \n \nStatistical analyses \n \nThe data from the North and South branches of each tree were combined for \nanalyses.  Percentage herbivory of beech by R. fagi (leaf-mine abundance per 100 \nleaves) and percentage parasitism of R. fagi (parasitoid count per 20 leaves) were \nmodelled with generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) with Binomial error \ndistribution and Logit link (SAS, 1999).  The influence of four fixed effects on \n 8\npercentage herbivory by R. fagi were considered: 1) the position of beech trees within \nthe woodland interior or at the woodland edge (EDGE); 2) the diameter at breast \nheight of individual beech tree trunks (DBH); 3) the canopy area of R. fagi habitat \npatches (isolated beech individuals or clumps of beech trees with overlapping \ncanopies) (PATCH); 4) distance to nearest neighbouring beech tree (DIST).  Also \nconsidered was the two\u2013way interaction between EDGE*DBH, EDGE*DIST, and \nEDGE*PATCH.   \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \nSimilar models were constructed for the parasitism rates caused by each of the \nthree parasitoid species.  In addition to the main effects and interactions described \nabove, percentage parasitism of R. fagi by each parasitoid species was also correlated \nto the main effect of host insect density (MINES), count of other potentially \ncompeting parasitoid species per tree (either P. longulus, C. braconius or C. \nnephereus) and the interaction of MINE density with tree position (EDGE*MINE).  \nHost insect density of the R. fagi mines provided a measure of the habitat quality of \nthe beech trees for the parasitoids.  Note that the abundance for each parasitoid \nspecies was not included as a covariate in the analysis of its own parasitism rates.  The \ninteractions of DBH, DIST, PATCH and MINE with EDGE were intended to account \nfor variation in environmental conditions associated with the edges of woodlands, e.g. \ngreater daily variation in temperature (Murica, 1995; Tscharntke & Brandl, 2004).  In \nall analyses percentage herbivory or parasitism rates were treated as proportions.  \nTo consider overall changes in the diversity of the parasitoid assemblage \nShannon-Wiener diversity (Krebs, 1999) of the parasitoids was correlated to the same \nfixed effects used in the models above for the assessment of parasitism rates by the \nindividual parasitoid species.  Note that the counts of individual parasitoid species \nwere not included in this model as explanatory variables as they were used to derive \n 9\n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \nthe Shannon-Wiener diversity measure. This final model used a normal distribution \nwith an identity link function.   \nIn all GLMMs the random categorical variables fitted were \u2018patch\u2019 (n = 43) \nand \u2018tree\u2019 (n = 88), which accounted for overdispersion at the observation level. \nSolution of fixed effects (EDGE, PATCH, DBH, MINES, DIST, P. longulus, C. \nbraconius, C. nephereus) and interactions with EDGE were estimated by residual \nmaximum likelihood (REML). Denominator degrees of freedom were estimated using \nSatterthwaite\u2019s approximation (Littell et al., 1996).  Main effect and interaction terms \nwere added step-wise to models with elimination of the least significant term until the \nmost parsimonious model was found.  Where an interaction term was found to be \nsignificant its component main effects were not deleted, even if individually non-\nsignificant. F-ratios adjusted for other significant model terms (SAS Type 3 tests) and \nare reported for all main effects and significant interactions. Partial residual plots were \nconstructed to show the evidence for the effect of particular covariates, after \ncontrolling for random and other significant fixed effects in the model, and include a \nfitted line to show the slopes of the relationships. \n \nResults \n \nA total of 88 beech trees were sampled within the overall Betula dominated \nwoodland, of which 15 trees were found to be present on the woodland edge in one of \nthree patches.  Sixteen patches, containing two or more beech trees, were present \nwithin the Betula dominated woodland, with the largest patch comprised of nine trees \ncovering an area of 1265.6 m2. From the 1,760 leaf-mines returned to the insectary \n10.0 % yielded R. fagi adults (n = 176). Assuming the parasitoid larvae were solitary \n(Askew & Shaw, 1974), 31.0 % of mines were parasitized (551 parasitoids) by one of \n 10\n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \nfour species of hymenopteran parasitoid. This left 59.0 % of the mortality of the \ninsectary reared R. fagi unexplained. Of the four parasitoids, three species represented \n95 % of the total parasitoid abundance: P. longulus (n = 225 individuals); C. \nnephereus (n = 182); and C. braconius (n = 129).  The remaining parasitoid (Pnigalio \nsoemius (Walker) (Eulophidae)) was represented by only 15 individuals, and was \nexcluded from subsequent analyses, with the exception of the calculations of \nShannon-Wiener diversity. \n \nHost-plant location, quality and patch size \n \nPercentage herbivory by R. fagi on beech trees was greater at the woodland \nedge compared to trees in the woodland interior (Fig. 2, Table 1).  The proportion of \nleaves with R. fagi mines was not correlated with any other measured parameter \n(DBH, PATCH, and DIST, see Table 1). The location of the beech tree at either the \nwoodland edge or interior influenced the parasitism rate of R. fagi differently \naccording to parasitoid identity (Fig. 3, Table 1). P. longulus parasitism was greater at \nthe woodland edge, while C. braconius parasitism rate was higher in the woodland \ninterior (Fig.3, Table 1). C. nephereus parasitism rate was also higher in the interior, \nbut this was not statistically significant after controlling for other effects (Fig.3, Table \n1). \nIndividual beech tree trunk diameter (DBH) was positively correlated (GLMM \nslope estimate: 0.8750) with proportional parasitism of R. fagi by C. nephereus (Table \n1). An interaction between DBH and tree location for C. braconius parasitism rate \nshowed a positive correlation with DBH for trees at the woodland edge and negative \nfor trees within the interior (Fig. 4). The parasitism rate by P. longulus was \nuninfluenced by tree trunk diameter (Table 1). \n 11\n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \nThe canopy area (PATCH) of the beech tree patches \u2013 the host-insect resource \n\u2013 was a predictor of proportional parasitism for two of the three parasitoid species. \nPnigalio longulus was positively (Table 1, Fig. 5a) and C. nephereus negatively \ncorrelated (Table 1, Fig. 5b) to patch canopy area, while C. braconius parasitism rate \nwas not affected by canopy area (Table 1).   While the area of patches was an \nimportant determinant of parasitism rates, tree isolation, as defined by the Euclidean \ndistance (DIST) to the nearest neighbouring beech tree, had no influence on the \nparasitism rate of any of the parasitoid species (Table 1). \n \nHost-parasitoid interactions \n \nProportional parasitism by C. braconius was positively correlated with host-\ninsect mine density (MINE) (Table 1, Fig. 6a), while C. nephereus parasitism rate was \ndensity-independent (Table 1).  Furthermore, P. longulus parasitism showed an \ninteraction between host insect mine density and beech tree location (MINE*EDGE: F \n(1, 81) =11.50, p = 0.001, Fig. 6b). For trees in the woodland interior the slope of the \nresponse to host- insect mine density did not differ from zero (b = -0.01 t = -0.15 p = \n0.87).  However, for trees located at the woodland edge there was a negative \ncorrelation between P. longulus parasitism and host mine density (b = -1.06, t = -3.09 \np < 0.05).  Proportional parasitism by each of the three parasitoid species was not \ncorrelated with the density of the other parasitoid species in the assemblage (Table 1).  \nTherefore, there was no evidence of direct interactions between parasitoid species \nusing the same host resource influencing parasitism rates in the three parasitoid \nspecies considered here.  \n \n 12\nParasitoid diversity 305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n \nShannon-Wiener diversity of the parasitoid assemblage was negatively \ncorrelated with the canopy area of the beech tree patches (F 1, 16 = 7.22, p = 0.02; Fig. \n5c). Parasitoid diversity was not affected by EDGE, DBH, DIST, MINES or any of \nthe interaction terms with EDGE. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe density of leaf-mines on the host trees was unexpectedly high, particularly \nat the woodland edge, where c. 78 % of leaves was found to be mined.  Previous \nstudies have shown that 75-85% of leaves present in the lower stratum of the canopy \n(the area sampled in this study) have some form of phytophagous invertebrate \ndamage, although this comprised damage from all species of leaf-chewing and leaf-\nmining insects (Phillipson & Thompson, 1980). It is possible that the high abundances \nof R. fagi in these Scottish woodlands may be due to the reduced impact of top down \ncontrol resulting from a comparatively impoverished fauna of parasitoids in this \nNorthern part of the UK (Askew & Shaw, 1974).  It should be noted, however, that \nwhile this parasitoid fauna may be species poor it was comparable in size to that \nfound in previous work in other Scottish woodlands (Day & Watt, 1989).  While there \nis some potential that competitive release from parasitoids may explain the high \ndensities of R. fagi in this woodland (Kareiva, 1982), rates of parasitism are known to \nbe highly variable between years for this species (Day & Watt, 1989).   \n \n High levels of mortality of the R. fagi larvae were not explained by parasitism, \nand indeed 59.0 % of the mortality remained unexplained.  Previous work has, \n 13\nhowever, shown that R. fagi is highly susceptible to mortality resulting from \nphenological asynchrony with its host plant beech (Nielsen, 1968).  Specifically, if \negg laying does not occur soon after bud burst this limits subsequent development of \nthe leaf-mines and so increases mortality rates.  In addition to this factor, low \ntemperatures in May have also been shown to result in high levels of mortality for R. \nfagi, although this effect has been more clearly demonstrated in Ireland than in \nScotland (Day & Watt, 1989).   \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n \nIsolation and patch size \n \nThe isolation of beech trees within the woodland was not found to have any \neffect on R. fagi density, its subsequent parasitism or the overall diversity of the \nparasitoids.  This finding contradicts first prediction that small and isolated patches of \nbeech trees would provide refuges from parasitism rates for R. fagi.  Small patches of \nbeech trees were, however, found to provide refuges from high parasitism rates from \nthe parasitoid P. longulus.  This finding concurs with other studies that have \ndemonstrated that a reduction in habitat patch area will reduce rates of parasitism for a \nnumber of parasitoid species (Roland & Taylor, 1997; Doak, 2000; Cronin, 2004).   \nHigher rates of parasitism, however, were also found within small patches for the \nparasitoid C. nephereus, while overall parasitoid diversity was found to decrease as \npatch size increased.  This effect may have been caused by a number of different \nprocesses. For example, intrinsic differences in the ability of parasitoids to colonise, \ndisperse and locate new hosts may have driven these responses to patch size (Kareiva, \n1987; Hanski, 1999). Alternatively, competition or interference from P. longulus may \nhave resulted in searching behaviour by C. nephreus that gave the appearance of a \nspecies targeted smaller patches.  There was, however, no direct evidence that P. \n 14\nlongulus had a negative effect on C. nephereus, although this was based on rates of  \nparasitism only.  It was possible that interspecific competition between C. nephereus \nand P. longulus occurred during the process of searching for the R. fagi host (Sato, \n1995; Wieber et al., 1995).   \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n Other studies have shown that several smaller habitat patches may support \nmore species that larger patches of an equivalent combined size, a response that is \nattributed in part to the quality of the surrounding habitat matrix within which these \npatches are situated (Tscharntke et al., 2002).  All the parasitoids were polyphagous \nand so could have utilised leaf-mining insects on other tree species in the woodland \n(Askew & Shaw, 1974; Rott & Godfray, 2000). It may be the case that the more \nwidely dispersed smaller patches occurred in areas of woodland that provided higher \nquality resources in terms of alternative host insects.  Indeed, the fact that all the \nparasitoids reared from the R. fagi host were polyphagous and so could utilise \nalternative hosts on other tree species makes any response to patch size unexpected.  \nIn particular, moth larvae of the leaf-mining genus Phyllonorycter spp. (Lepidoptera, \nGracillariidae) were present throughout the woodland on birch trees. Phyllonorycter \nspp. represented potential alternative hosts for both C. nephereus and the braconid C. \nbraconius (Rott & Godfray, 2000). However, while the Phyllonorycter spp. did \nrepresent potential alternative hosts for the parasitoids, the density of R. fagi leaf-\nmines on the host trees (beech) remained several orders of magnitude greater than \nthose of Phyllonorycter spp. on birch trees (AJV, BAW pers.obs).  Therefore, it may \nbe the case that R. fagi leaf-mines on their host (beech) represented a locally super-\nabundant resource for these parasitoids, rather than the only host resource that they \ncould use within the woodland.   \n \nEnvironmental gradients and patch quality \n 15\n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n \nHigh quality habitats for the parasitoids were considered to be trees with high \ndensities of the host insect R. fagi.  As the second prediction suggested this did \ninfluence rates of parasitism, although the directions of these responses were not \nconsistent between parasitoid species.  Density-dependent parasitism of R. fagi was \nfound for C. braconius, while parasitism by C. nephereus was density independent, \nand that of P. longulus was dependent on the location of the beech trees at either the \nwoodland edge or interior.  The aggregation of parasitoids to patches of high host \ndensity has been shown to contribute to temporal stability in host\u2013parasitoid \ninteractions (e.g. Hassell & May, 1973).  Such density dependent effects in parasitism \nrates have been suggested to be caused by species-specific searching behaviour \nresulting in increased attraction to, and residency time in, areas of high host density \n(Hassell, 1978; Stiling, 1987; Doak, 2000).  Patterns of inverse density-dependence \nmay reflect longer handling times during host location and oviposition (Waage, 1983; \nVisser et al., 1999), or the occurrence of interference reducing parasitoid efficiency in \nexploiting high density patches (Stiling, 1987; Taylor, 1993).  Overall in this study, \nthe different parasitoid responses to host density broadly reflect the suggestion by \nStirling (1987) that direct and inverse dependence occur in 25 % and 23 % of host-\nparasitoid interactions respectively.   \nThe importance of underlying environmental gradients in structuring the \nparasitoid assemblages were apparent in the form of interactions between parasitism \nrates and the location of beech trees at the woodland edge or interior.  For example \nparasitism by P. longulus was density independent on host trees in the woodland \ninterior, whereas at the woodland edge R. fagi experienced inverse density-dependent \nparasitism.  Overall rates of parasitism also differed for P. longulus and C. braconius \nbetween woodland edge and interior. In addition, C. braconius parasitism rates were \n 16\n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \ncorrelated with tree trunk diameter, a factor that provided an indirect index of tree \nage, health and size (Thomas, 2000).  This response, however, was influenced by the \nlocation of beech trees at the woodland edge or interior.  These responses concurred \nwith the second prediction that underlying environmental gradients present within the \nwoodland would alter the interaction between secondary and tertiary trophic levels.  \nIn this case the environmental gradients were the result of edge effects at the interface \nbetween the woodland and the clear cut areas of plantation forestry.  Such an interface \nwould result in local variation in environmental conditions, such as ambient \ntemperature, timing of bud burst (and so host availability) and leaf nutritional quality \n(Murica, 1995).   \n \nThe findings of this study must be considered within the context of some \nmethodological issues.  As emergence, rather than dissection, was used to define \nparasitism rates, the direct assessment of multi- and superparasitism, as well as \nwhether species were primary or hyperparasitoids was not possible.  However, as the \nbiology of all three parasitoids used in this study was known (e.g. Askew & Shaw, \n1974;  Rott & Godfray, 2000) the ambiguity introduced by this limitation of the \nmethodology is thought to be of limited importance.  It was also possible that as no \ndissections of the larvae in leaf-mines were used over wintering parasitoids may have \nbeen missed in this study.  Species of Pnigalio, have been recorded as over wintering \nin the mines of their hosts (Raske, 1978). However, given that the mines of the R. fagi \noccur early in the season a long period is available for these multivoltine parasitoids \nto find alternative hosts (Pschorn-Walcher & Heitland, 2000).  Given this length of \ntime it was thought unlikely that many of the parasitoids would have over wintered \nwithin R. fagi leaf-mines.  \n \n 17\nConclusions 435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n \nDeciduous woodlands play an important role in supporting invertebrate \nbiodiversity in the agricultural landscape of lowland Scotland (Woodcock et al., \n2003a; Woodcock et al., 2003b; Vanbergen et al., 2006).  The responses of the \nparasitoid species associated with R. fagi to effects of host insect density, habitat \npatch area and the spatial location of the host-plant has demonstrated that the structure \nof these woodlands will potentially play a role in determining their contribution to \nlandscape scale biodiversity effects.   Areas of high quality resources within these \nwoodlands, here represented by patches of beech trees with their super-abundant leaf-\nminer R. fagi, will influence the spatial distribution of parasitism and parasitoid \ndiversity, even for polyphagous species.  In addition we have shown that \nenvironmental gradients though these woodlands will also modify the pattern of \nassemblage structure for these parasitoids.  Habitat heterogeneity within woodlands is \ntherefore likely to promote niche separation between the parasitoid species that show \ndifferent functional responses to local patterns of patch quality and size.  This \nvariation in parasitism rates and parasitoid diversity indicates the complex and \nvariable nature of responses by parasitoids to spatial habitat structure and host density \nin natural environments.  \n  \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks to David Elston of Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) and Steve \nPalmer for statistical advice.

The effect of beech tree position (EDGE), host insect (R. fagi) density (MINES), beech trunk diameter (DBH), beech patch area \n(PATCH), Euclidean distance to nearest neighbouring beech tree (DIST) on percentage R. fagi herbivory and proportional parasitism of R. fagi \nby three parasitoid species. Also tested is the influence on parasitism rates of the count of other parasitoid competitors in the assemblage (C. \nbraconius (n) P. longulus (n) C. nephereus (n)).
