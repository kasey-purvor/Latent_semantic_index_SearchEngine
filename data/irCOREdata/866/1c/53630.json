Introduction\nThe sub-Permian unconformity is a pronounced feature\nof the geologicalmap of northern England and southern\nScotland. It records several tens of millions of years of\nregional uplift and erosion during and following the\nVariscan Orogeny (Chadwick et al. 1995; Stone et al.\n2010), and resulted in strata ranging fromprobablemid-\nPermian to early Triassic in age resting discordantly\non rocks of Early Ordovician to Asturian (Moscovian)\nage. As a consequence, the youngest, largely red-\nbedCarboniferous rocks (Bolsovian\u2013Asturian) are only\nlocally preserved in the region and are not well\nunderstood.\nThe largest area in northern England and southern\nScotland where Upper Carboniferous (Bolsovian\u2013\nAsturian) strata are preserved is to the south of the\nCanonbie Coalfield, along the axis of theNNE-trending\nSolway Syncline (Figs 1\u20133). They aremainly concealed\nby the younger Permo-Triassic rocks of the Carlisle\nBasin but, in a relatively small area straddling the\nEngland\u2013Scotland border near Canonbie, they are\nlocally exposed, notably in the River Esk (Fig. 2),\n\u2020Author for correspondence: neil.jones@aramco.com\nproviding a rare opportunity in this region to examine\nthese rocks in the field.\nPrevious research in the area has concentrated\non the older coal-bearing successions because of\ntheir potential economic importance (Peach & Horne,\n1903; Barrett & Richey, 1945; Lumsden et al. 1967;\nRamsbottom et al. 1978; Picken, 1988). Apart from\nestablishing a broad, generalized lithological sequence,\nand the presentation of some faunal and floral data, little\nhas been published on the strata above the cambriense\nMarine Band (Fig. 5).\nStratigraphical subdivision of the younger parts of\nthe Carboniferous is often hampered by the common\noccurrence of reddening of the strata. Besly & Turner\n(1983) and Besly, Burley & Turner (1993) have\ndescribed three phases of reddening of Carboniferous\nstrata: (1) an early syndepositional oxidation of\nsediments at the time of deposition (termed primary\nred-beds in this paper), (2) oxidation of initially\ngrey siderite- and coal-bearing sediments by pen-\netrative weathering beneath the Carboniferous land\nsurface soon after deposition, and (3) penetrative or\ndiagenetic reddening of Carboniferous rocks below\nthe sub-Permian unconformity, linked to the ingress\nof oxidizing groundwaters as a result of periods of\nsubaerial exposure. This penetrative oxidation has been\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nWarwickshire Group, red-beds, Canonbie, UK 51\nFigure 1. General location map for the Canonbie Coalfield and the other UK coalfields mentioned in the text (modified from British\nGeological Survey, 1999). MSNFF \u2013 Maryport\u2013Stublick\u2013Ninety Fathom Fault system.\ndescribed in detail by Bailey (1926), Trotter (1953,\n1954),Mykura (1960), Turner (1980) andBesly (1998).\nThe latter two are grouped here as secondary red-beds.\nIn this account we present the results of a largely\nfield-based stratigraphical and sedimentological study\nof the red-beds that occur above theCambrienseMarine\nBand in the Canonbie area. The paper proposes a\nnew lithostratigraphical nomenclature for these red-\nbeds and comparisons are made with other areas\nof the UK, both onshore and offshore. At the time\nof field investigation (March 2004 and July 2005),\nthe strata were particularly well exposed along the\nRiver Esk at Canonbie as river levels were low and\nrelatively little river sediment was present (Fig. 2).\nThis has allowed us to present a more detailed\ndescription than given previously by Barrett & Richey\n(1945) and Lumsden et al. (1967) of the main River\nEsk section. Observations from the outcrop sections\nare supplemented by information from 17 boreholes,\ndrilled into the coal-bearing Langsettian\u2013Duckmantian\n(Bashkirian) strata (Table 1), and by seismic reflection\nsurveys (Fig. 4). Many of the boreholes were drilled by\nopen-hole rock-bit methods through these mainly red\nrocks as they were regarded as being of little economic\ninterest. Where cores were taken, they have since been\ndiscarded, and descriptions are of variable quality.\nFortunately, some of the more recent boreholes, mainly\ndrilled in the 1980s (Picken, 1988), have wireline\ngeophysical well-log suites (abbreviated hereafter to\nwell-logs) through this part of the succession.\nWhile it was not the primary purpose of this work to\ncarry out a detailed petrographical study, a few samples\nwere analysed by standard optical methods in order\nto provide further information on the nature of the\ndetrital components within the sandstones (Table 2).\nThese samples were also analysed for their heavy\nmineral assemblages in order to compare them with\nthe extensive published dataset (Hallsworth, 1992;\nHallsworth & Chisholm, 2000; Hallsworth et al. 2000;\nMorton, Claou\u00b4e-Long & Hallsworth, 2001; Morton,\nHallsworth & Moscariello, 2005). Heavy mineral sep-\narations from the 63\u2013125 \u03bcm fraction were analysed\npetrographically using the technique of Morton &\nHallsworth (1994, 1999), and using the ribbon counting\nmethod of Galehouse (1971) for 200 non-opaque heavy\nmineral grains (Table 3).

Tectonic and regional setting\nThe Pennsylvanian rocks of the Canonbie Coalfield are\nterminated to the north by the Gilnockie Fault (Barrett\n& Richey, 1945; Lumsden et al. 1967) (Figs 2\u20134),\none of a set of en e\u00b4chelon ENE-trending structures\nthat form the northern margin of the Northumberland\u2013\nSolway Basin (Chadwick et al. 1995). Up to 8000 m\nof Carboniferous strata were deposited in this basin\nwhich was initiated by rifting in Tournaisian times.\nThe Gilnockie and related southerly-directed faults\nare interpreted as being antithetic syndepositional\nstructures on the northern margin of the basin. Phases\nof rifting continued until the end of Visean time, but\nthereafter, dip-slip faulting was much subdued and\nbasin thermal subsidence dominated. The youngest\nrocks now preserved are Asturian in age and form the\nsubject of this paper.\nTowards the end of Carboniferous time, sedimenta-\ntion ceased and the rocks of the basin were deformed\nduring the Variscan Orogeny when the rocks were\nfaulted, locally thrust, and gently folded. In several\nparts of northern England and in the southern North\nSea, it has been suggested that deposition of the latest\npart of the basin-fill was contemporary with the early\nphases of the Variscan Orogeny and that many of\nthe folds are in part syndepositional (e.g. Leeder &\nHardman, 1990; Chadwick et al. 1995, p. 36; Corfield\net al. 1996). Within the study area, Chadwick et al.\n(1995, fig. 27) and Jones & Holliday (2007) have\ninferred syndepositional thickening of strata into the\nSolway Syncline beginning in late Visean time. The\nfolding probably occurred as a response to dextral\ndisplacement on the Gilnockie Fault and other basin-\nbounding faults (de Paola et al. 2005).\n3. Pennine Upper Coal Measures Formation\nFollowing the lithostratigraphical subdivision of Car-\nboniferous rocks proposed by Waters et al. (2007) for\nonshore Great Britain, the oldest rocks described in\nthis account are referred to the Pennine Upper Coal\nMeasures Formation and the overlying red-beds are\nplaced in theWarwickshireGroup (Fig. 5). The Pennine\nUpper Coal Measures Formation comprises mainly\ngrey strata, although secondary red-beds become more\ncommon upwards. The formation is about 150 m in\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n54 N. S. JONES, D. W. HOLLIDAY & J. A. MCKERVEY\nFigure 4.

On the NW flank of the Solway\nSyncline the full thickness of the Pennine Upper Coal\nMeasures Formation is generally not preserved due to\nerosion beneath the sub-Permian unconformity.\nThe base of the formation is taken at the Cambriense\nMarine Band (Figs 5\u20137), and Picken (1988) suggested\nthat there was a major unconformity at this level, with\nabout 155 m of strata (including the upper part of\nthe Pennine Middle Coal Measures Formation) eroded\non the flanks of the coalfield. However, no indication\nof such a major unconformity has been identified on\nthe seismic reflection sections, and the excellent well-\nlog correlation between boreholes across the coalfield\nsuggests that in fact no strata aremissing. There is some\nindication that the strata are generally thicker along the\naxis of the Solway Syncline than on its flanks, and also\nthe gradation to primary red-beds may occur at lower\nstratigraphical levels on the flanks than in the syncline.\nThe basin flanks do appear to contain much more sand-\nstone than along the axis of the syncline, but the log cor-\nrelations suggest that these are localized channel sand-\nstones present at several different stratigraphical levels\nand that they do not constitute evidence for the more\nwidespread unconformity suggested by Picken (1988).\nBorehole well-log data indicate that the form-\nation largely comprises mudstones, some coals,\nEstheria-rich mudstone beds and Spirorbis limestones\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nWarwickshire Group, red-beds, Canonbie, UK 55\nTable 2.

Sandstones are generally thin (2\u20135 m\nthick), although in theGlenzierfoot andBroadmeadows\nboreholes a sandstone is present at the base of the\nformation, forming a single unit up to 20 m in thickness\nwith a distinct blocky gamma-ray character (Fig. 7).\nThe upper part of the formation can be examined\nat outcrop along the western bank of the River Esk\n[between 3905 7715 and 3900 7715] (Fig. 2). Here the\nsuccession dominantly comprises pinkish to reddish\nbrown silty claystone, with some sandy siltstone and\nrare pinkish grey fine- to medium-grained micaceous\nsandstone. Rooted palaeosols are common, although\nin places the roots are present only as traces due to\nthe effects of oxidation. Ironstone nodules and thin\nbeds are also commonly present. Oxidized coals also\noccur, with one example represented by an organic-\nrich, ferruginous limestone at [NY 3904 7712] (Fig. 8).\nMudstones contain a fauna including Anthraconaia\npruvosti and Leaia bristolensi, suggesting this upper\npart belongs to the tenuis Chronozone and thus spans\nthe interval between late Bolsovian and Asturian\n(Moscovian) (Lumsden et al. 1967; Ramsbottom et al.\n1978) (Fig. 5).\n4. Warwickshire Group\nThe term Warwickshire Group has been applied to the\npredominantly red-bed strata that typically form the\nupper part of the Carboniferous succession in the UK\npreviously referred to by such names as the Barren\nor Red Measures (see Powell et al. 2000). The type\narea is the Warwickshire Coalfield in central England\n(Fig. 1), where the succession attains its fullest thick-\nness of 1225 m (Powell et al. 2000). In the southern\nPennine coalfields the Warwickshire Group is largely\nunconformable onto older Pennine Coal Measures\nGroup strata, with the \u2018Symon Unconformity\u2019 present\nin places between the two (Powell et al. 2000).

The group typically\ncomprises red mudstones and sandstones, with varying\namounts of pebbly sandstone, conglomerate, grey\nmudstone, thin coals, lacustrine limestone (\u2018Spirorbis\nlimestone\u2019) and calcrete palaeosols. The lithologies of\nthe Warwickshire Group formed predominantly within\noxygenated surface conditions within a drier climate.\nThe Warwickshire Group has not previously been\nrecognized from the Canonbie area, although earlier\nwork had recorded the presence of red strata in the\n\u2018Upper Coal Measures\u2019 of the area (Peach & Horne,\n1903; Simpson & Richey, 1936; Barrett & Richey,\n1945; Trotter, 1953; Lumsden et al. 1967; Day, 1970;\nPicken, 1988). Picken (1988) described the succession\nas largely comprising interbedded sandstones and\nmudstones, generally calcareous. Marker beds include\nSpirorbis limestones and a persistent coal that was\nnamed the High Coal (Fig. 6).\nThe detailed stratigraphy in the Canonbie area has\nbeen determined by a study of the outcrops along\nthe River Esk between [3915 7706] and [3981 7576]\nwhich form the type section (Fig. 9), together with the\nrelevant borehole information. As a result of this work,\nthree subdivisions of the group have been identified,\ndescribed below from oldest to youngest. These have\nbeen given formation status and were named and\ndefined by Jones & Holliday (2007). Due to the\nextensive Devensian and Holocene cover in the area\nit is difficult to map these formations in the field, hence\nthey should be regarded as informal names. However,\nthey are readily identifiable at outcrop along the River\nEsk and from detailed descriptions of borehole core.\n4.a. Eskbank Wood Formation\nThis formation is 145\u2013175 m thick, although the full\nthickness of the formation is not always preserved on\nthe northwestern flank of the coalfield due to erosion at\nthe sub-Permian unconformity surface. The formation\ndominantly comprises mudstone (60\u201370 %) with the\nremainder being largely sandstone. Red mudstones are\ninterbedded with fine- to medium-grained sandstones,\ncalcrete palaeosols, thin beds of Spirorbis limestone\nand Estheria-bearing mudstones. Sparse thin coals and\ngrey mudstones are present in the lower part of the\nformation; some of these coals have been oxidized\nand altered to limestone. One thick coal (the High\nCoal), locally up to about 1.2 m thick, is known\nonly from boreholes (Figs 6, 7). The outcrop section\n[NY 392 770] proves up to 75 m of the formation,\nincluding mudstones that contain at several localities\na non-marine fauna, particularly bivalves, identified as\nAnthraconauta phillipsii, A. aff. phillipsii, A. cf. tenuis,\nA. cf. wrightii, possibly Anthracomya pruvosti and also\nostracods (A. E. Trueman in Barrett & Richey, 1945,\np. 39; Lumsden et al. 1967, p. 178), and indicative of\nan Asturian age (Fig. 5).\nThe conformable, slightly diachronous base of the\nformation is taken at the first major primary red-bed\nstrata overlying the grey Pennine Upper Coal Measures\nFormation (Fig. 6) and is difficult to locate in uncored\nboreholes. Its exact position differs between boreholes\nbut it generally occurs close to the High Coal. The\ngradational nature of the boundary indicates there was\nlocal variation and alternation between oxidizing and\nreducing conditions. As the High Coal can be identified\nin open-hole from suitable well-logs (e.g. sonic and\ndensity logs), it is suggested that, in the absence of core\ndata, the top of the coal is taken to mark the boundary\nbetween the Pennine Upper Coal Measures and the\nEskbank Wood formations (Figs 6, 7).\n4.b. Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation\nThis formation is more or less continuously exposed\nalong the River Esk in the immediate area north and\nsouth of Canonbie Bridge (Fig. 2) and its base is taken\nat the lowermost sandstone bed in a thick (20\u201330 m)\nmulti-storey sandstone complex at [3919 7695] (Fig. 9).\nThe formation ranges in thickness from 131 m in\nBroadmeadows Borehole up to amaximum of 168 m in\nthe Becklees Borehole (Figs 6, 7). On the northwestern\nflank of the Canonbie Coalfield the full thickness of the\nformation is not always preserved due to erosion at the\nsub-Permian unconformity surface.\nThe formation comprises interbedded reddish brown\nto greenish grey, moderately to poorly sorted, fine-\nto coarse-grained lithic arenite sandstones (50\u201370 %)\n(Fig. 10), reddish brown mudstones and reddish brown\nmudstone palaeosols including calcretes. Sandstones\nare generally cross-bedded, forming individual sharp to\nerosively based channellized units that range in thick-\nness from 2 to 10 m. In some places these amalgamate\ninto multi-storey sandbodies up to 40\u201350 m thick\n(Fig. 11). Intraformational mudstone conglomerates\noccur scattered throughout the sandstones but are more\ncommon lining channel bases.

Classification scheme after\nPettijohn, Potter & Siever (1987).\nsandstones can be micaceous and contain a noticeable\ncomponent of greenish grey grains that, in thin-section,\ncan be identified as lithic clasts, mainly comprising\nfine foliated or schistose low-grade pelitic and psam-\nmitic metasedimentary clasts (Table 4; Fig. 12). The\nhigh lithic component gives the sandstones higher\ngamma-ray log values compared to the overlying\nBecklees Sandstone (Fig. 6).\n4.c. Becklees Sandstone Formation\nThe Becklees Sandstone Formation is the uppermost\nunit recognized and its top is truncated at the sub-\nPermian unconformity. Thus its full thickness is not\nknown, but boreholes show that at least 200 m of\nprobable late Carboniferous strata conformably overlie\nthose of the river section; seismic reflection surveys\nindicate that this thickness could be up to 700 m along\nthe axis of the Solway Syncline (Chadwick et al.\n1995) (Fig. 4). Although these higher strata cannot be\ndirectly examined, their well-log and seismic reflection\ncharacter suggest that they are similar to the youngest\nCarboniferous red-beds seen at outcrop.\nThe formation comprises interbedded subfeldspathic\narenitic sandstones (70\u201390 %) (Fig. 10), reddish brown\nmudstones and reddish brown mudstone palaeosols\nincluding calcretes. Limestones and thin coals are\nalso recorded in cuttings from the Becklees Borehole,\nalthough these are uncommon and were not seen at\noutcrop.\nSandstones are fine- to medium-grained, orange\nbrown to bright reddish brown and pinkish brown,\nmoderately to well sorted and typically lack mica. They\nare generally cross-bedded and occur in thick, sharp-\nbased successions (10\u201330 m), some showing fining\nupwards. The sandstones contain a noticeably lower\nproportion of lithic clasts andmore rounded grains than\nthe underlying Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation\n(Table 4; Fig. 13). At outcrop this lithological change is\nabrupt; in well-logs it can be seen as a lower response\non the gamma-ray log (Fig. 6). Sand-filled polygonal\ncracks penetrating the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nFormation have been recorded at the base of the\nformation [3936 7631]. These may be joints which,\nif this is the case, would point to a significant time gap\nbetween the deposition of the two formations, marked\nby lithification of the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone.\n5.

Scale bar is 0.5 mm\nacross.\na varied fauna including Estheria and non-marine bi-\nvalves (e.g. Anthraconauta, Modiolaris and Naiadites).\nThe deposition of thin fresh-water limestones (Fig. 15)\nsuggests the periodic development of shallow, well-\noxygenated fresh-water lakes, possibly characterized\nby high rates of surface-water evaporation. Into these\nlakes small lacustrine deltas formed, fed from river\nsystems. The presence of thick channel sandstoneswith\nblocky gamma-ray profiles and thin-bedded crevasse\nsplays indicates that, at times, the environment became\nmore akin to an alluvial plain rather than a wetland.\nPoorly drained soils were typically formed at this\ntime, although periods of better-drained conditions\nwere characterized by the development of semi-gley,\npseudogley and brunified alluvial types, with common\nred and green mottling of the soil profiles (Table 5;\nFigs 16, 17). Incipient calcimorphic soils, represented\nas isolated carbonate nodules within brunified alluvial\nsoils, are also recorded in the lower part of the\nWarwickshire Group.\nThe upper part of the Eskbank Wood Formation\nshows an increasing development of better-drained\nfloodplain conditions marked by shallow lakes and\nfloodplains that often dried out, leading to the\nformation of desiccation cracks and better-drained\nsoils. Brunified alluvial and calcimorphic palaeosols\nbecome dominant, some of which can be quite well\ndeveloped (Fig. 18). Lacustrine facies are also present,\nbut are less common than lower in the formation. These\nare generally red but lack features indicative of well-\ndrained conditions (e.g. desiccation cracks), suggesting\nperiods of subaqueous deposition, possibly in reducing\nconditions. These were later oxidized and reddened,\nprobably early in the diagenetic process. Channels are\nalso known, but they are typically minor and do not\nform a significant percentage of the formation.\nThe Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation shows a\nmarked and apparently abrupt change in sedimentation\npatterns, with the establishment of an alluvial plain\nin which large fluvial systems dominated (Fig. 11).\nTypically these channels carried a coarse sediment\nload marked by presence of common lithic detritus,\nrecycled from an earlier metasedimentary terrain. Such\nfluvial systems record the delicate interplay between\nsubsidence, base-level change and sediment supply,\nwith a high sediment load combined with increasing\nrates of accommodation space generation suggested.\nPalaeocurrent analysis indicates that these channel\nsystems flowed from south to north, with low sinuosity\nchannel systems suggested by the low spread of the pa-\nlaeocurrent data (Fig. 19). Locally, overbank and well-\ndrained palaeosol facies are known, with brunified al-\nluvial and calcimorphic palaeosols dominant (Figs 20,\n21). This indicates that the floodplain was generally\nwell-drained, although a thin coal is reported from\ncuttings from high in the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nFormation in the Becklees Borehole, which would re-\ncord a temporary reversal to poorly drained conditions.\nThe Becklees Sandstone Formation also comprises\na high proportion of sandstone, and deposition in\nalluvial channel systems is again indicated. Too few\npalaeocurrent measurements were measured at outcrop\nto be confident of channel trends, although dipmeter\ndata suggest flow towards both the south and the NW\n(Fig. 19). Detailed analysis was not possible for this\nformation, although a provenance change is suggested\nby the change in palaeocurrent data and the reduction\nin both grain size and lithic clast content.\nDuring the late Carboniferous it is known that there\nwas a change in climate from humid or sub-humid\nconditions in Bolsovian times to semi-arid conditions\nby Asturian times. This was brought about by the\nrain-shadow effect of the continuously rising Variscan\nmountain chain to the south during the formation of the\nPangaean supercontinent (Parrish, 1982; Rowley et al.\n1985; Besly, 1987). This led to the development\nof a monsoonal circulation pattern with a marked\nseasonality to the climate (Parrish, 1982; Rowley et al.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nW\narw\nickshire\nG\nroup,red-beds,C\nanonbie,U\nK\n63\nTable 5.

Unidirectional\nsedimentary structures indicate\ndownstream migrating current\ngenerated sandy bedforms, formed\nfrom turbulent flows. The low spread of\npalaeocurrents suggests a low channel\nsinuosity.

This formed the\nrubbly texture and also the concave\nupward planes, which are interpreted as\npseudo-anticlines (= the subsurface\nexpression of surface mounds known as\ngilgai). Successive wetting and drying\nalso led to the deposition of CaCO3\nlower in the soil profile.

Interestingly, desiccation cracks\nhave been locally recorded in the core, indicating the\nstart of better-drained conditions.\nThe most compelling evidence for the presence of\nWarwickshire Group strata comes from SW Ayrshire,\nwhere plant fossils have been suggested to be either\nAsturian or even Stephanian in age (Wagner, 1966).\nMykura (1967) recorded up to 450 m of strata above\nthe Aegiranum Marine Band in boreholes in this area.\nOf these, the uppermost \u223c 120 m of strata are pre-\ndominantly red-beds, and include Spirorbis limestones,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nWarwickshire Group, red-beds, Canonbie, UK 69\ndesiccation-cracked mudstones, mud-clast breccias\nand beds with calcareous concretions (Mykura, 1967),\nwhich are likely to be calcrete palaeosols. These\nhigher strata invite comparison with the Eskbank\nWood Formation at Canonbie (Fig. 22). It would\nappear that there is no evidence for strata equivalent\nto the Canonbie Bridge and Becklees Sandstone\nformations.\n6.a.2. West Cumbria\nThe West Cumbrian Coalfield lies to the SSW of Can-\nonbie and the two areas are connected in the subsurface\nvia the Solway Syncline beneath Permo-Triassic cover\n(Chadwick et al. 1995) (Figs 1, 3). Akhurst et al.\n(1997) assigned the youngest Carboniferous strata\nof west Cumbria, of phillipsii to tenuis Chronozone\n(late Bolsovian to Asturian) age, to the Whitehaven\nSandstone Formation, divisible into the Whitehaven\nSandstone and the overlying Millyeat Beds members\n(Fig. 22).\nThe Whitehaven Sandstone Member is an approx-\nimately 100 m thick succession, largely comprising\na reddened, locally coarse-grained to pebbly, quartz-\ndominant sandstone, deposited by large braided fluvial\nriver systems that flowed fromNE to SW (Jones, 1993).\nNo calcrete palaeosols are known, although evidence\nfor incipient primary reddening and desiccation cracks\noccur, suggesting that the member could be included\nin the Warwickshire Group. This agrees with the\nrecent work of Waters et al. (2007). The Whitehaven\nSandstone Member lacks the large quantities of\nlithic grains seen in the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nFormation and hence there would appear to be no direct\nlithological correlatives of this member at Canonbie\n(Fig. 22).\nThe overlying Millyeat Beds Member contains a\ngreater proportion of mudstones than in the underlying\nmember, comprising an alternating grey and red-bed\nsuccession of mudstone, less common sandstone, thin\ncoals, locally present gley palaeosols that show some\nincipient reddening, and Spirorbis-bearing limestones\n(Brockbank, 1891; Kendall, 1896). These characterist-\nics are similar to the facies described from the Eskbank\nWood Formation of Canonbie. If this is the case,\nthis suggests that Warwickshire Group sedimentation,\nrepresented by the Whitehaven Sandstone Member,\nbegan earlier inWest Cumbria than Canonbie (Fig. 22).\nIt is notable that there appear to be no preserved\nequivalents of the higher Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nand Becklees Sandstone formations preserved in west\nCumbria.\nOther nearby coalfields, such as at Midgeholme\nand Stainmore, can be excluded from this discussion\nbecause only strata up to the lowermost Duckmantian\nare preserved (Ramsbottom et al. 1978; Stone et al.\n2010). The Northumberland\u2013Durham Coalfield pre-\nserves a sequence of Bolsovian rocks, up to 300 m\nthick, locally with Pennine Upper Coal Measures\nFormation strata, for example, in the Boldon Syncline\n(Smith, 1994), but no primary red-beds are known\nthere.\n6.a.3. Ingleton\nThe Ingleton Coalfield forms an isolated area of Upper\nCarboniferous rocks preserved in a syncline at the\nnorthern margin of the Craven Basin (Fig. 1). Upper\nCarboniferous strata are generally not well exposed\ndue locally to unconformable Permian cover and,\nmore generally, an extensive blanket of Quaternary\ndeposits. Ford (1954) provided the only modern\naccount of the succession and recognized a lower grey,\ncoal-bearing unit (Pennine Lower and Middle Coal\nMeasures formations) and an upper dominantly red-\nbed succession, about 580 m thick, believed to be\nseparated by a pronounced unconformity (Ford, 1954;\nRamsbottom et al. 1978) (Fig. 22).\nThe \u2018Red Measures\u2019 above this unconformity have\nbeen divided into lower and upper units, with the\n\u2018Lower Red Measures\u2019 comprising up to 275 m of\nstrata in the Holden House Borehole [SD 6579 7397].\nThese strata typically consist of red conglomerate and\nsandstone, mudstone, locally variegated and mottled,\ncalcareous mudstone, \u2018seatearth\u2019 palaeosols and thin\ncoals, and contain a bivalve fauna indicating the basal\npart of the phillipsii Chronozone (upper Bolsovian\nage).\nThe overlying \u2018Upper Red Measures\u2019, about 240 m\nthick, were separated from the \u2018Lower\u2019 red-beds by\na series of faults (Ford, 1954). The succession was\ndescribed as generally redder, dominantly comprising\nsandstone, but also including several beds of breccia,\nrooted horizons, \u2018seatearth\u2019 palaeosols and three thin\nlimestone beds (Ford, 1954). The non-marine bivalve\nfauna indicates a late Bolsovian, or even possibly early\nAsturian age.\nThe descriptions of the \u2018Lower Red Measures\u2019 sug-\ngest that they largely comprise secondarily reddened\nUpper Carboniferous strata. The coarseness of the\nsuccession invites comparison with the similarly aged\nWhitehaven Sandstone Formation of West Cumbria\nand thus it may belong to the lowermost part of\nthe Warwickshire Group, although this is extremely\nspeculative. The \u2018Upper Red Measures\u2019 are tentatively,\nthough more certainly, assigned to the Warwickshire\nGroup and may be equivalent to the Eskbank Wood\nFormation of Canonbie (Fig. 22).\n6.b. English Midlands, southern England and South Wales\nThe English Midlands saw the diachronous spread\nof red-beds northwards during the late Duckmantian\nonwards (Besly, 1998; Powell et al. 2000). The\nearliest unit within the Warwickshire Group, the\nEtruria Formation, comprises a mottled red mudstone-\ndominated succession with subordinate lenticular\ncoarse sandstones (\u2018espleys\u2019), with volcanic and lithic\nclasts in places (B.

The formation is up to 300 m\nthick and is known from central and northern England,\nNorth Wales and Lancashire (Powell et al. 2000).\nIt typically lacks calcrete palaeosols, although well-\ndrained palaeosols such as brunified alluvial and\nferruginous palaeosols have been described, as well as\npost-depositionally oxidized and hydromorphic gleys\n(B. M. Besly, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Keele Univ. 1983;\nBesly & Fielding, 1989; Besly & Cleal, 1997).\nThe Halesowen Formation overlies the Etruria\nFormation and typically comprises grey-green or red\nmicaceous sandstones (litharenite) and mudstone with\nthin coals, beds of Spirorbis limestone and calcrete\n(Powell et al. 2000). Glover & Powell (1996) and\nBesly & Cleal (1997) described sandstones from\nthe Halesowen Formation as metasediment-dominated\nlitharenites (Association B of Besly & Cleal, 1997).\nThese sandstones contain up to 60 % low-grade\nmetasedimentary grains, mainly foliated psammites\nand pelites rich in muscovite, chlorite and biotite;\nthis gives fresh sandstones a distinctive green colour\n(Glover & Powell, 1996). The Halesowen Formation\nsandstones also contain abundant garnet, and a source\nrich in chrome spinel and chloritoid is suggested\n(Hallsworth, 1992). This metasedimentary detritus is\nthought to be largely recycled, derived from the Rheno-\nHercynian Zone of the Variscan Orogenic belt (Besly\n& Cleal, 1997; Besly, 1998).\nWarwickshire Group strata are also known to\nextend between the South Wales, Forest of Dean,\nBristol, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Kent coalfields\n(Kelling, 1974; Besly, 1988; Shephard-Thorn, 1988;\nFoster et al. 1989; Sherlock, Jones & Jones, 2000;\nWaters et al. 2007) (Fig. 1). Here they predominantly\ncomprise grey, coal-bearing successions with thick\nlithic (\u2018Pennant\u2019 type) sandstones. The sandstones are\ntypically coarse-grained, locally conglomeratic and\ncomprise feldspathic and micaceous lithic arenites\nwith some recycled Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary\nand volcanic clasts (Kelling, 1974). Locally, red-\nbeds are also known; these become more common\nupwards through the group (Waters et al. 2007).\nThe petrological similarities between the Halesowen\nFormation of the Midlands and the Pennant Sandstone\nFormation of SouthWales suggests a similar derivation,\nand braidplain systems sourced from the Hercynian\nmountains to the south have been proposed (Besly,\n1988; Kelling & Collinson, 1992; Jones & Hartley,\n1993; Sherlock, Jones & Jones, 2000).\nSpanning the interval between the late Asturian\nand early Stephanian is the Salop Formation (Pow-\nell et al. 2000). This comprises an interbedded\nsuccession of red and red-brown mudstones and\nsandstones, some pebbly, with thin Spirorbis limestone\nand calcrete palaeosols in the lower part (Powell\net al. 2000). Sandstones are mostly sublitharenite\n(Association C of Besly & Cleal, 1997), largely\ncomprising monocrystalline and polycrystalline quartz\nand minor potassium feldspar. These sandstones also\ntypically contain detrital carbonate grains, formed\neither through reworking of calcrete or representing\ndetritally reworked Carboniferous Limestone grains\n(Glover & Powell, 1996; Besly & Cleal, 1997).\nAccording to Besly & Cleal (1997), sandstones of the\nSalop Formation (Association C) are identifiable in\nthe field by their distinctive orange-brown colour. The\nSalop Formation consists of recycled Carboniferous\nand perhaps Devonian lithic material and also contains\ncalcrete palaeosols.\nIt is difficult to be confident of any correlation of\nUpper Carboniferous rocks between Canonbie and the\nEnglish Midlands, due to the limits of the faunal and\nfloral control, the large distances involved and the\nlikelihood of lateral facies changes. Although both\ndominantly comprise mudstone-rich successions, the\nEskbank Wood Formation is younger than the Etruria\nFormation. If they are equivalent this would indicate\na strong element of diachroneity; hence it would\nappear that there is no equivalent to the Eskbank\nWood Formation in the Midlands. The Halesowen\nFormation is of much the same age as both the\nEskbank Wood and the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nformations and has a similar litharenitic composition\nto the latter. Heavy mineral data from the rocks at\nCanonbie are more restricted in their compositional\nvariations and, in general, are characterized by lower\nMonazite\u2013Zircon, Chrome-spinel\u2013Zircon and Rutile\u2013\nZircon compositions than the rocks from the Pennine\nBasin (Table 3; Figs 23, 24). When the data are\ncompared to samples from the Mexborough suite\n(late Duckmantian to Bolsovian) and the Halesowen\nFormation (Asturian), the Canonbie rocks show more\nsimilarity to the Halesowen Formation; the Mexbor-\nough suite is more heterogeneous and is characterized\nby a much larger range of Monazite\u2013Zircon, Chrome-\nspinel\u2013Zircon (Fig. 24) and Rutile\u2013Zircon values\n(Hallsworth & Chisholm, 2000). Overall, the heavy\nminerals suggest that the rocks from Canonbie may\ncontain material derived from the Variscan orogenic\nbelt, but the data do not exclude contributions from\nother sources. The garnet compositions from the\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation also show some\nsimilarities to those measured from the Halesowen\nFormation (Hallsworth et al. 2000), but are more\nrestricted in their compositional range (Fig. 25).\nHowever, recent zircon age dating from a sample\n(NJN100) from the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Form-\nation shows unequivocally that a significant proportion\nof the sediment was derived from the Variscides of\nwestern or central Europe, supporting the proposed\ncorrelation with the Halesowen Formation and the\nPennant Sandstone Formation (Morton, Fanning &\nJones, 2010). It also means that the idea of a\nlocal, contemporaneous source for the Canonbie red-\nbeds, proposed by Chadwick et al. (1995), can be\ndiscounted.\nThe overlying Salop Formation also appears to have\nsome features in common with the Becklees Sandstone\nFormation, particularly its distinctive orange-brown\ncolour and lower proportion of lithicmaterial. However,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n72 N. S. JONES, D. W. HOLLIDAY & J. A. MCKERVEY\nFigure 23.

Data were obtained\nfrom samples NJN98 and 99 (Becklees Sandstone) and NJN100,\n101 and 102 (CanonbieBridge Sandstone). There is considerable\nvariation in the ATi values (11\u201378), reflecting variable amount\nof apatite dissolution during sediment transport and storage. The\nrocks of the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone have higher ATi (62\u2013\n78) than the Beckless Sandstone (42\u201345). All other indices GZi,\nMZi and CZi are low (0\u20137) with the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\ncharacterized by slightly higher MZi, but similar CZi and GZi,\nin comparison to the Beckless Sandstone.\nthe Salop Formation clearly has some locally reworked\nmaterial (Carboniferous Limestone grains), which is\nnot seen in the restricted exposures of the Becklees\nSandstone Formation. These correlations are extremely\ntentative and more work would be needed on the\npetrography and provenance indicators of the Canonbie\nsuccession in order to confirm any relationship.\nThe Upper Stephanian to Autunian successions of\nthe Midlands are not likely to be correlatives of the\nCanonbie succession because they are typically quite\nrestricted in their geographical distribution and have\nlocal source areas. For example, the Clent Formation\ncontains a distinctive suite of clasts derived largely\nfrom Uriconian (Precambrian) rocks of the Welsh\nBorderlands, and the Kenilworth Sandstone Formation\nis a distinctive unit formed from Precambrian and\nLower Palaeozoic rocks of the Lickey Ridge (Glover &\nPowell, 1996; Powell et al. 2000).\n6.c. Southern North Sea\nSuccessions chronostratigraphically equivalent to Can-\nonbie are present offshore in the southern North\nSea. The Bolsovian-aged Cleaver Formation is a\ngrey-bed succession, suggested to have been derived\nfrom a combination of detritus sourced from the\nFigure 24.

The\nCanonbie data are distinct from the southern North Sea Ketch\nand Cleaver formations (which generally have high CZi, low\nMZi values) and the onshore Mexborough suite (which is\ncharacterized by a much larger range of MZi and CZi),\nsuggesting that the Canonbie rocks are not derived from the\nsame source. There would appear to be some similarity between\nthe Canonbie rocks and the Halesowen Formation (Daleswood\nBorehole).

Although the base of the\nKetch Formation is defined as the lowest occurrence\nof primary red-bed facies (Cameron, 1993, p. 22),\nan angular unconformity is present at the base of\nthe formation in condensed sections near sub-basin\nmargins, for example, in blocks 44\/13 and 44\/14 (Besly,\n1998; Moscariello, 2003; Jones, Allen & Morrison,\n2005). Further south, in blocks 44\/26 to 44\/28, the\nCambriense Marine Band is present and a thick coal-\nbearing section occurs above it (B.

More recent\nwork on the heavy mineral assemblages suggests that\nthe Ketch Formation comprises a single source area\ndraining two distinct lithologies, one from an ultramafic\nsource and the other from Al-poor metasedimentary\nrocks; the Rink\u00f8bing Fyn High is favoured as the likely\nsource area (Morton, Hallsworth&Moscariello, 2005).\nThe Asturian Boulton Formation comprises finer-\ngrained channel facies, as well as non-marine lime-\nstones, calcrete palaeosols and some grey, coal-bearing\nfacies (Besly, 1998, 2005). The formation is less\nfeldspathic and richer in metamorphic lithic material\nthan the Ketch Formation and a Variscan source is\nsuggested for this unit (Besly, 1998; Morton, Halls-\nworth & Moscariello, 2005). Jones, Allen & Morrison\n(2005, p. 186) also described the presence of low-grade\nmetasedimentary rock fragments in sandstones of the\nBoulton Formation, which they believed are indicative\nof a southerly derivation.\nIn terms of relating the onshore Canonbie succession\nwith that of the southern North Sea, Besly (1998,\np. 123) has suggested that the Ketch Formation is\nequivalent to that of the Canonbie succession. The\nEskbank Wood Formation is lithologically similar\nto the Ketch Formation, but is younger (Fig. 22).\nBesly (1998) has also suggested that the lithic-rich\nBoulton Formation is equivalent to the Halesowen\nFormation. Chronostratigraphically it would appear to\nbe equivalent to both the Eskbank Wood and Canonbie\nBridge Sandstone formations, and lithologically it has\nmuch in commonwith both the onshore Halesowen and\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone formations. Unfortunately,\nthe heavymineral character of the Boulton Formation is\ncurrently unknown. If it is comparable with the onshore\nHalesowen and Canonbie Bridge Sandstone formations\nthen there would appear to be no equivalent to the\noverlying Salop and Becklees Sandstone formations\nin the currently available well penetrations in the\nUK sector of the southern North Sea due to sub-\nPermian erosion. The probable equivalents of these\nsections may be present in the youngest Carboniferous\npenetrated in the Dutch sector of the southern North\nSea (the Step Graben Formation, e.g. in wells K07\u2013\n08 (van Adrichem Boogaert & Kouwe, 1995) and\nF10\u201302).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n74 N. S. JONES, D. W. HOLLIDAY & J. A. MCKERVEY\n7. Conclusions\nOur understanding of the youngest Carboniferous rocks\n(Bolsovian\u2013Asturian) in the UK is hampered by their\nlimited preservation and the common reddening of\nthe strata. One such Upper Carboniferous succession\nis present at outcrop and in boreholes around the\nCanonbie area of SW Scotland and adjacent parts of\nnorthern England, preserved within the NNE-trending\nSolway Syncline. This is one of the few areas in the\nUK outside of the English Midlands where such strata\ncan be directly examined at outcrop and hence it is\nan important scientific site. Early workers placed these\nreddened Upper Carboniferous strata at Canonbie into\nthe Upper Coal Measures and were uncertain as to their\norigin. From the work presented here, it is clear that\nthese strata can be assigned to theWarwickshire Group\non the basis that red-bed facies occur which show\nevidence for early oxidation (primary reddening) of\nthe strata. At outcrop, about 290 m of theWarwickshire\nGroup are almost continuously exposed along the banks\nof the River Esk. In the subsurface, up to about 530 m\nof the group is known from the Becklees Borehole, and\nseismic reflection data indicate it could be up to about\n700 m thick in the centre of the Solway Syncline.\nThree informal formations have been recognized\nwithin the Warwickshire Group: from base upwards,\nthe Eskbank Wood, Canonbie Bridge Sandstone and\nBecklees Sandstone formations. These three forma-\ntions have distinctive well-log signatures and hence are\nreadily correlatable in the subsurface around Canonbie.\nThe base of the group is diachronous, marked by\nthe repeated alternations of grey and primary red-bed\nstrata. Initially (Eskbank Wood Formation), sediment-\nation was dominated by muddy facies, with lacustrine\nmudstones dominant, but with common development\nof palaeosols, including calcretes, and thin beds of\nSpirorbis limestone. The overlying Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation marks the incoming of thick\nunits of medium- and coarse-grained cross-bedded\nchannel sandstones. These represent large, braided-\nriver systems flowing northwards across a well-drained\nalluvial plain. A noticeable feature of these sandstones\nis their greenish grey colouration, which can be related\nto the presence of abundant lithic grains. Overbank\nand floodplain fines were commonly deposited lateral\nto channels and soils were able to form during intervals\nof low sediment aggradation.\nThe Becklees Sandstone Formation is the youngest\nunit recognized from the Warwickshire Group of\nCanonbie, overlain unconformably by Permian strata.\nIts full thickness is not known, but up to 200 m\nis proved in the Becklees Borehole. This sandstone\nis finer-grained, has a distinct orange-brown colour\nand contains a significantly lower proportion of lithic\ncomponents.\nComparisons with other areas suggest that these\nare the lateral equivalents of some of the formations\nrecognized elsewhere in Scotland, the English Mid-\nlands and in the southern North Sea. The published\ndescriptions of the red-beds in Ayrshire are similar to\nthose of the Eskbank Wood Formation. The Eskbank\nWood Formation has some lithological similarities to\nthe Etruria and Cleaver formations, although it is much\nyounger and hence it would appear that there is no\nequivalent to the Eskbank Wood Formation in the\nMidlands and southern North Sea.\nMetasediment-dominated litharenites from the\nHalesowen Formation of the English Midlands and\nthe Pennant Sandstone Formation of South Wales\nappear to be similar to those of the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone. This is largely thought to have been derived\nfrom the Variscan orogenic belt. Heavy mineral data,\ngarnet geochemistry and zircon age dating supports\nthis conclusion. Offshore, the Boulton Formation also\ncontains lithic-rich sandstones that are believed to be\nVariscan sourced, and hence this formation could also\nbe equivalent to the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone.\nFinally, the Becklees Sandstone has much in com-\nmonwith the Salop Formation of the EnglishMidlands,\nparticularly in terms of its distinctive orange-brown\ncolour and lower proportion of lithic material. It would\nappear that there is no equivalent in the UK sector of\nthe southern North Sea, although candidates exist in\nthe Dutch sector.\nFurther work is needed to confirm these conclusions\nand there is still much to learn about the provenance\nof these units. However, it is clear that southerly-\nderivedVariscan detrituswas able to travel considerable\ndistances across the southern North Sea, UK and\nadjacent areas, to a position a few hundred kilometres\nnorth of what has previously been recognized. Thus,\ndespite their somewhat limited present extent, the\nCanonbie Warwickshire Group strata are probably\nrepresentative of the sedimentary facies laid down\nover all or much of northern England and its environs\ntowards the end of the Carboniferous and are indicative\nof the palaeogeographical conditions prevalent there\nat that time. Their absence elsewhere in this area is\na measure of the extent and depth of erosion beneath\nthe sub-Permian unconformity and suggests that this\nis of greater magnitude than commonly assumed.\nThis conclusion has major implications for studies\nattempting to model burial history and the timing of\ngeneration of hydrocarbons and mineralizing fluids\nfrom Carboniferous strata in and around northern\nEngland.\nAcknowledgements.
