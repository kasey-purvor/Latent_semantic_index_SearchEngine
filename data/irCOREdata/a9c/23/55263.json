Through network analysis, we show that the community of players\nin a online social game is an example of a scale free small world network\nand that the growth of the player-base obeys a power law.\nThe community is centred around a minority group of \u201chardcore\u201d play-\ners who define the social environment for the game, and without whom\nthe social network would collapse. Methods are discussed for identifying\nthis critically important subset of players automatically through analysing\nsocial behaviours within the game.\n1 Introduction\nLudologists have known for a long time that all players of games are not equal.\nAmong the various classifications of play styles [1] an abstract distinction is\nmade between two classes of player: Hardcore players and Casual players. Hard-\ncore players are defined by their high level of involvement in games, quantified\nby time spent in play and the scale of in-game achievements. In contrast, the\nCasual players are characterised by shorter, less frequent play sessions and more\nshallow involvement in the gaming experience[2].\n1.1 Identifying the Hardcore\nEssentially the Hardcore represent the pioneers of a game, and despite being a\nsmall minority of the total player-base, they help define the experience for their\nfellow players through their actions and behaviour.\nBy identifying the hardcore players and analysing play patterns it is possible\nto see how the game is perceived amongst these influential players. This can\ngive vital clues to areas where the game design needs improvement. Identifying\nthe hardcore players is not a straightforward task. Studies of gamers in the past\nhave identified them via self-report [2] or based on the time invested in play [3].\nOur approach uses Network Analysis to examine the social network within\nan online game and highlight the most highly connected nodes as being the\nhardcore centre of the game.\n1\n2 Network Analysis and Games\nSocial games are also built on top of networks - that is the network of rela-\ntionships (edges in a graph) between the players (the nodes in the graph). By\nusing network analysis methods [4] we can study the nature of social interactions\nwithin the game community. Since game interactions are recorded in real-time\nand network analysis is mathematical, it is possible to get a live picture of how\nthe society within a game behaves and how it grows as time passes.\n2.1 Small World Networks\nSmall World networks are a peculiar kind of network graph where every node\ncan trace a path to every other node in the network[4]. They are named for the\nfamous \u201cSmall World\u201d experiments carried out by Travers and Milgram in the\nlate 1960\u2019s [5] and the most familiar example of which is that of the Six Degrees\nof Kevin Bacon[6].\nSocial games can also expect to be Small Worlds - the larger community of\nplayers are linked through play to one another in a large contiguous social graph.\nIt is proposed that the central nodes of a game are represented by the hardcore\nplayers - our Hardcore social gamers interact frequently with our Casual players\nand therefore bring them into the Small World of the game.\n2.2 Analysis of a Social Game - Familiars\nFamiliars is a social game about collections that can be played online1 and via\nmobile phone[7]. Players adopt the titular Familiars and give them free-form\ntasks which they would like completing. The familiar is left to be discovered\nby other players, who see tasks they wish to help complete. Contributions to\ntasks are any combination of text message, photograph and location (via GPS\nor self-report). Familiars was evaluated in a two month long public trial in\nJuly-August 2008.\nThe trial involved 157 active users and recorded 1546 distinct interactions\nbetween players. An interaction is defined as one player contributing data to\nthe task that has been assigned to a familiar by a second player. This in-\nteraction data builds a network graph based on 157 nodes (players) and 603\ndistinct edges (interactions, excluding duplicates and self-interactions) that can\nbe investigated using network analysis.\n2.2.1 Network Properties\nBased on the graph built by the Familiars players during the trial, we generated\na random graph based on the same parameters of the largest contiguous social\ngraph. N=147 due to 10 of the 157 players being totally isolated and never\ninvolved in a social interaction. By comparing the behaviour of our social players\n1See http:\/\/www.familiars.eu\n2\nTable 1: Comparitive Network Properties\nProperty Familiars Graph Random Graph KBG\nAverage Path Length (L) 2.314 2.584 3.65\nClustering Coefficient (\u03b3) 0.471 0.059 0.79\nwith random data we expected to see the intelligent behaviour of the players\nresult in significant non-random patterns in the network.\nTable 1 shows the properties of the Familiars graph compared with the\nRandom graph with the same parameters. For illustration only, the values\nfrom the \u201cKevin Bacon Graph\u201d (KBG) [4] are included. Average Path Length\n(L) represents the average length of every path from each user to each other\nuser in the network. The higher the value of L, the more spread out the graph\nis, and as L decreases, it indicates how previously distant nodes have become\ncloser via a shortcut between nearby nodes.\nThe Clustering Coefficient shows the average number of connections each\nnode has within its local graph neighbourhood. For example, for every player u\nthat is adjacent to the set of nodes V , \u03b3 is equal to the proportion of neighbours\nof each node v that are also adjacent to u. The clustering coefficient is the\naverage value of \u03b3 for every node in the graph.\nAs the value of \u03b3 increases, the graph is more likely to break up into several,\nsmall, tightly knit graphs (i.e. a Caveman World [4]). A value of \u03b3 approaching\n0 indicates interaction partners are selected randomly from the set of all possible\nplayers.\nCompared with the random graph, the clustering of interactions in the Fa-\nmiliars network is striking. Since interactions are only between pairs, the signif-\nicant difference in coefficient illustrates the intelligent and discerning nature of\nthe players\u2019 behaviour. The high clustering points to the existence of structured\ngroups of players within the game who are still quick to interact outside their\nsocial neighbourhood.\n2.2.2 The Scale Free Nature of the Network\nThe analysis of the properties of the network confirm it as a Small World net-\nwork. All social members of the network (that is, all players that interacted\nwith someone who was not themself) appear on a single contiguous network\ngraph, rather than several distinct groups of players. However, the relatively\nlarge amount of clustering identifies that players were discerning in their choice\nof interaction partner rather than random, which calls for more investigation.\nFor each node, we found the Degree of Connection (k), which is the number\nof nodes adjacent on the graph. In game terms this means the number of distinct\nindividuals who have either interacted with the familiar belonging to player v,\nor have been the recipient of an interaction initiated by v.\nFigure 2.2.1 shows the cumulative distribution of F (k) against increasing\n3\nFigure 1: Cumulative Distribution of Degrees in Familiars and Random Net-\nworks\nvalues of k for both the Familiars players and the random graph with the same\nparameters. As can be seen, the distribution for the Familiars players strongly\nfollows a power law. The average value of k for a network with these parame-\nters is 8.204 but this is meaningless based on the significant difference between\nthe random graph and the players\u2019 behaviour which shows that the Familiars\nnetwork is Scale Free[8].\nScale Free networks are characterised by the way that they exhibit prefer-\nential connectivity as they grow. In other words, as new nodes join an existing\nnetwork, they are much more likely to connect to a highly connected node and\ntherefore \u201cthe rich get richer\u201d. In Familiars this is certainly true, as new players\nare more likely to be involved in an interaction with a more popular player. This\nconfirms findings in several other social applications, such as those built on Face-\nbook [9].\nFigure 2: Classifying the Player\nBase\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n2.3 Player Classification\nGiven the scale free nature of our typi-\ncal social game network, we can classify\nplayers automatically by analysing the so-\ncial attributes of a player within the social\nnetwork.\nFigure 2 illustrates broadly how a\nplayer base can be split into three classifi-\ncations by analysing their position within\n4\nTable 2: Comparison of Player Classifications in Familiars\nClassification No. Players (%) No. Interactions (%) Mean k Max k Min k\nHardcore 18 (12.24%) 302 (50.08%) 33.56 84 17\nCasual 66 (44.90%) 238 (39.47%) 7.10 15 4\nPeripheral 63 (42.86%) 63 (10.45%) 2.03 4 1\nAll 147 (100%) 603 (100%) 8.204 84 1\nthe network based on \u201cinvestment\u201d or their activity within the network.\nHardcore players are the smallest group of players of the game, but the\nmost influential, having invested time and effort to become the most important\nnodes in the network of the game.\nCasual players (or Marginal nodes in Network Analysis terms) account for\nthe remainder of the active players who have invested a little in the game, but\nnot as much as the hardcore.\nPeripheral players are those that are only interacted with other players a\nhandful of times at most. They are inactive and not a part of the community\nso appear at the very edge of the network. This kind of player accounts for the\nmajority of nodes within the network.\n2.3.1 Defining Classification Boundaries\nThere is an issue with the definition of the boundaries between the different\nclasses of player, especially since the hardcore is such an abstract concept by\ndefinition. The boundaries can be based arbitrarily based on sudden changes in\nthe graph [10], by proportion (e.g. boundaries at 10% and 40%) or by analysis\nof cliques (connected subgraphs) within the larger network[4].\nIn the case of Familiars, we analysed the network based on removing the\nmost active players (Highest values for k) until a phase change resulted in the\nlargest contiguous subgraph being smaller than the number of disconnected\nplayers. Practically The removed players were marked as Hardcore in that\nwithout them, the fabric of the social network fell apart. The remaining players\nin the disconnected graphs were identified as the marginal players and the nodes\nthat were completely isolated from the graph were marked as the periphery (they\nwould not even be in the game if it was not for the hardcore).\nTable 2 shows how the analysis through to the small world phase change\nsplit the Familiars players into the three classes. As has been demonstrated, the\ndistribution of players and play-style is distinct - Hardcore players are involved\nin over half of the interactions of the game despite being just 12.4% of the\ncommunity. For other social games heavy with hardcore themes, steep learning\ncurve and high cost of entry might expect the percentage of hardcore players to\nbe much higher than that of Familiars, when performing the same analysis.\n5\n3 Conclusions and Further Work\nIn this paper we proposed that the play style of player can not only be identified\nby their personal preference, but by the effects their play has on the social\nenvironment of the game in which they play.\nThrough performing network analysis of the social game Familiars, we have\ndemonstrated that social games are likely to be Small World Scale-Free net-\nworks. The scale free nature of the networks compared with random graphs\nexemplifies the impact of a small but powerful group of Hardcore players who\nbind together the social fabric of the game community. Due to the importance\nof the Hardcore within the social network of a game, we demonstrated a method\nfor classifying them, along with the marginal and peripheral players, in order\nthat the finer-grained details of a player\u2019s activity and effects within a game\nworld can be studied.\nOur initial findings in this paper are based on a fairly small sample for a\nsocial game. The same analysis is planned to be carried out on larger scale\nsocial games (such as those on existing social networks such as Facebook) to see\nif the same network properties hold true.\n4 Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback and\nsuggestions for improvements to the paper.
