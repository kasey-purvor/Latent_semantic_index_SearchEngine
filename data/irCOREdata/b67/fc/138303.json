A. Titarev\nLaboratory of Applied Mathematics\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nUniversity of Trento, Trento, Italy\nE-ma i l : t i ta rev@ing.un i tn. i t , titarev@mail.ru\nAbstract\nA new conservative discrete ordinate method for nonlinear model kinetic equations is pro-\nposed. The conservation property with respect to the collision integral is achieved by satisfying at\nthe discrete level approximation conditions used in deriving the model collision integrals.\nAdditionally to the conservation property, the method ensures the correct approximation of the\nheat uxes. Numerical examples of a supersonic ow with large gradients are provided for the\nShakhov and Rykov model kinetic equations.\nKey words: rareed, low Knudsen numbers, kinetic equation, Shakhov model, Rykov\nmodel, conservative method.\n21 In t roduc t i on\nCorrect description of rareed gas ows is based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the\nmolecular velocity distribution function. Since this integro-dierential equation is exceed-\ningly complicated due to the presence of the nonlinear multidimensional collision integral\nmuch attention has been given to simpler model kinetic equations. These equations are\nconstructed by replacing the exact collision integral by an approximate model collision\nintegral. Examples include the Krook or BGK [6], Holway [12] and Shakhov [26, 28] model\nequations for monatomic gases as well as Holway [12] and Rykov [24] model equations for\ndiatomic gases.\nNumerical solution of kinetic equations requires the use of conservative methods suit-\nable in a broad range of Knudsen numbers (including transitional and low Knudsen num-\nbers) and for both steady and unsteady ow regimes. In recent years considerable progress\nhas been made in devising such methods for the kinetic equation with the exact Boltzmann\ncollision integral [7, 23, 5]. For model equations the situation is less clear. Conservative\ndiscrete ordinate methods proposed for simple monatomic BGK and Holway model equa-\ntions [22, 11] cannot be extended directly to the Shakhov and Rykov models. A rather\nsophisticated correction procedure was applied in [10] to the Shakhov model collision\nintegral at each time step in such a way as to satisfy the conservation property. Its gener-\nalization to other models has not been reported. No conservative method has so far been\ndeveloped for diatomic models.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present an exceedingly simple and universal approach\nto construction of conservative discrete ordinate methods for model kinetic equations. The\napproach is an extension of [33] and is based on the approximation of the constrains used\nin deriving the model equations. Therefore, i t can be used for virtually any model kinetic\nequation. We provide a detailed explanation of the idea as applied to the Shakhov model\nequation and then extend it to the Rykov model equation.\nAs a numerical example, we consider a supersonic transverse ow over a at plate for a\nwide range of Knudsen numbers from free-molecular to near-continuum regime using\nboth model equations. The presented results illustrate the sensitivity of the method to the\nchoice of the molecular velocity mesh as well as provide a study of aerodynamic properties\nof the plate and distribution of the macroscopic parameters.\n2 Monatomic gases\n2 .1 Cons t r uc t i on o f mode l equa t i ons\nFor monatomic gases a general approach to construction of model kinetic equations was\nproposed in [25, 28] and is based on the idea of approximating the exact Boltzmann kinetic\nequation in terms of momentum equations. I n other words few rst momentum equations\nshould coincide for the model and exact kinetic equations. As a result, a sequence of\nmodel kinetic equations can be developed by increasing the order of moments for which\n3the approximation condition holds.\nLet us write the model kinetic equation for the velocity distribution function f in the\nfollowing form:\nf f\nt r+ = Q(f a ) (1)\nHere = ( 1 2 3 ) is the molecular velocity vector, t is time, r = (x1 x2x3) is the\nspatial coordinate, a is an unknown vector of macroscopic parameters which depends on\nthe chosen model equation. Since the dierential parts of the exact and model equations\nare the same, the approximation condition means that rst few moments Jof exact\ncollision integral J(f) coincide with the rst few moments of the model collision integral\nQ(fa):\nQ(fa)d = J(f f )d = J (2)\nwhere\n= 1i 2i j i j k\nAlternatively one can use\n=1 vi v2vi vj vi vj vk v= u\nAs is common in construction of model kinetic equations for the monatomic gas it is\nassumed that the approximation condition (2) should be satised for the maxwellian\nmolecules only. Then the moments J can be evaluated analytically and we can express\nthe vector a via the integrals of the velocity distribution function:\nU(a) = b()fd(3)\nwhere U is a certain function of macroscopic parameters and b() is a vector function of\nthe molecular velocity .\n2 .2 T he m od e l o f Shakh o v\nThe Shakhov model kinetic equation is a generalization of the Krook model equation in\nthat the approximation condition (2) is satised not only for 1, i , 2,ij, but also fori 2.\nThis ensures the correct relaxation of both the heat ux and stresses, leading thus to the\ncorrect continuum limit in the case of small Knudsen numbers. In particular, the model\ngives the correct Prandtl number. Comparisons of dierent monatomic model equations\nwith experimental data and the nite-dierence solution of the Boltzmann equation with the\nexact collision integral shows the Shakhov model to be more accurate than the BGK and\nHolway models [38, 30].\nIn the rest of the paper we use the non-dimensional form of the kinetic equations in\nwhich non-dimensional spatial variable r, time t, number density n, velocities u and ,\n4temperature T, viscosity , heat ux q and distribution function f are given by\nn u\nn = u = 2RT= __________________2RT n\nq f\nq = mn (2RT) 3 2 f = n (2RT ) 3 2\n(4)\nHere L is a typical spatial scale of the problem, n , R is the gas constant, T- some\ncharacteristic values of gas density and temperature; m is the molecule mass, is the\nmean free path connected to by\n5\n= 16mn 2RT\nBelow we shall use the conventional notation for all variables meaning the non-\ndimensional quantities.\nIn the non-dimensional form the Shakhov model collision integral is given by [26, 28]\nQ(f a ) = f +f\n4 v 2 v 2\nf + = f M 5(1 Pr)2qv1 + T 5f M =___________n(T )3 2 expnT 2 2 T\nHere f M is the locally-maxwellian function, Kn = L and Pr are the Knudsen and Prandtl\nnumbers, respectively. The vector of unknown parameters in the model collision integral a\n= (nuTq)T containing number density n, temperature T and vectors of gas velocity u\nand heat ux q can be calculated as:\nn nu3U(a) = 2nT + nu 22q (12vv2) f d =\nSince the expression for f + contains the third-order polynomial of the distribution\nfunction f may become negative at the tails. Although a possible loss of positivity is a\ndrawback from the theoretical point of view, it does not aect the robustness of the model\nin practical applications because f 0 a s . For example, see [3] for the numerical\nstudy of the structure of exceedingly strong shock waves (Mach numbers up to 100) and\n[34] for calculation of the hypersonic t ransverse ow over a cold plate with free-stream\nMach numbers up to M= 30. Moreover, according to the Godunov theorem [9]. second-\norder advection schemes with linear operators often used in practice [1, 34] are not\nmonotone and may generate the negative values of f even for the BGK model, further\ndiminishing the importance of strict theoretical positivity.\nThe H theorem for the Shakhov model can be proven only for ows with small\ndepartures from equilibrium [28]. We remark, however, that the problem of spatially-\nhomogenous relaxation to equilibrium admits an exact solution for the Shakhov model\nequation with the correct relaxation of all non-equilibrium moments of the distribution\nfunction as well as the H function, see e.g. [28]. This fact constitutes an indirect evidence\nthat the H theorem holds for the Shakhov model equation.\n8 1 nT = 5 K n\n52.3 Conventional discrete ordinate method\nA standard approach to solve the model kinetic equation with given boundary and initial\nconditions is the so-called discrete ordinate method. Its main idea is to replace the exact\nintegration with respect to molecular velocity over all velocity space by an approximate\nnumerical integration over a nite domain using a discrete set of points. Let be an index of\nthe three-dimensional molecular velocity mesh, be a node in this mesh, f = f(t r ). Then\nthe model kinetic equation is replaced by a system of equations for f:\nt r\nf + (f) = Q Q = Q(f a ) (7)\nwhich are connected via macroscopic parameters dened as integrals over the entire molec-\nular velocity space. Each of equations (7) can now be solved using a modern high order\nnon-oscillatory scheme. For example, an explicit semi-discrete scheme can be written as\nf = Dh(f) + Q(8) t\nwhere Dh is a conservative numerical approximation to the advection operator. A review of\nmodern approaches to the construction of such operators can be found in many refer-\nences, e.g. [35, 17, 31]. For example, in the spatially one-dimensional case the expression\nfor Dh reduces to\n(Dh(f))i = fi+ 1 2 fi 1 2 xi\nwhere i is the index of the spatial mesh, xi is the cells size. The values of the distribution\nfunction at the cell interfaces fi+12 can be computed using a second-order MUSCL-type\nreconstruction [15, 16, 36] or higher order reconstruction, e.g. nite-dierence or nitevolume\nweighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions [14, 31].\nConventionally, e.g. [37], macroscopic parameters are evaluated by direct approxima-\ntion of (3).\nU(a) = b()fA (9)\nFor the Shakhov model this gives:\n3 12vv2fA(10)\nn nu =\n2nT+nu22q\nHere A are weights of the integration rule used in the numerical scheme. Normally one\nuses a tensor product of one-dimensional quadrature to perform the three-dimensional\nintegration in the molecular velocity space, e.g. the simplest choice corresponds to the rst\norder quadrature and is given by A = 3 .\n2.4 Conservation property\nIt is well known that the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy of the gas\ncan be obtained by multiplying (1) by collision invariants 1, , 2 and integrating over the\n6entire molecular velocity space. I t is natural to require that this property be maintained at\nthe discrete level by the numerical method (8),(9). The discrete relations expressing\nconservation of mass, momentum and energy in the computations are obtained by\nmultiplying (8) by the collision invariants and summing them with the weights A :\nR +D h( ) = K n\nt\nHere the vector of conserved quantities R , the ux tensor i j and the numerical source\nterm (a Kn)K n on the right hand side are given by\nR = l f A = l T f A K n = l Q A l = (12)T\nIt is obvious, that R coincides with rst ve components of U dened by (10).\nFollowing [4] we call the numerical method (8) conservative with the respect to the\ncollision integral if the numerical source term vanishes: K n 0. Basically, conservative\nmethods mimic the conservation property of the collision integral on a given molecular\nvelocity grid. They do not produce non-physical sources of mass, momentum and energy\nand therefore in the limit of small Knudsen numbers the kinetic solution approaches the\nsolution of Navier-Stokes equations away from boundaries. On the contrary, as will be\nshown below, for non-conservative methods very ne meshes in the molecular velocity\nspace are needed to keep the conservation error small when the Knudsen number decreases.\nWe now demonstrate that for any choice of the quadrature weights A and cell size\nthe conventional discrete ordinate method, given by (8), (10) is not conservative.\nUsing (10) we can rewrite the expression for the source term K n in the following form:\nThe exact integration of f + with respect to\n(12)f +d = n n u\ngives\n3\nn 2T +u 2\nHowever, the r t h order quadrature with weighs A used in the discrete ordinate method\nyields\n(0)\nSubstituting the above\nexpressions into (12) we can estimate the norm of the numerical\nsource term as K n O (r) 1 KnO (r) (14)\nK n =\n\uf02d n\n\uf02d n\nu\n3\n\uf02d n 2T +u 2\n3\n(12)f + A = n n u n 2T + u 2+O (r)\n7From (14) i t is obvious that for a given molecular velocity mesh the conventional\ndiscrete ordinate method applied to the nonlinear Shakhov model equation produces a\nsource term that grows K n as Kn 0. Moreover, the same behaviour can be observed for\nthe linearized kinetic equations (details are omitted). I n the case of small Knudsen\nnumbers K n can be very large. I n practical calculations one cannot a o r d a\nne mesh for due to excessive memory requirements. As a result, computing ows with\nsmall Knudsen number may become d i c u l t . For example, it follows from the above\nargument that the free-stream conditions cannot be preserved exactly.\nI n addition to the conservation property, one would also like the numerical integration\nwith respect to to reproduce the exact values of macroscopic parameters when f is given in\nthe form of the locally Maxwellian function. This is called compatibility with the initial\ndistribution of macroscopic parameters [4]. The conventional discrete-ordinate method is\nnot compatible with the init ial data because the macroscopic parameters are computed\nwith an error of order of ()r, see (13). Due to the presence of the large numerical source\nterm K n , this error may grow rapidly with time.\nA similar conservation error occurs at the boundary; however, i t does not depend\ndirectly on the Knudsen number and in many cases can be simply ignored.\n2.5 Construction of the explicit conservative method\nThe explicit conservative method is obtained by modifying the discrete collision integral\nin the following way: f = Dh(f) + Q(f a )(15)\nt\nwhere the m o d ie d vector of macroscopic parameters a is obtained as a solution of the\ndiscrete approximation to (2)\nQ(f a )A = J (16)\nFor the Shakhov model equation it is convenient to use = 12 vv2. Then rst ve equations in\n(16) represent conservation of mass, momentum and energy of colliding molecules; the\ncorresponding moments J vanish. The conservation conditions (16) can be written as:\n1 0\n0\nQA = (17)\n2 0\nvv2 ( 4 3 ) q\nThe nonlinear system (17) for (n u T q ) can be easily solved by the Newton iteration\nmethod. The iteration process requires an initial guess which is provided by the conven-\ntional expressions (9), (10). Usually, i t is sucient to make one or two iterations since the\nNewton process converges very rapidly.\n8I t is obvious that the m o d ie d method (15), (16) is conservative by construction for\nany choice of the quadrature weights A, including the rst order quadrature, and any value\nof the Knudsen number Kn. However, since\na= a +O(r)\nthe use of higher-order quadratures results in a better init ial guess (10) and thus faster\nconvergence of iterations. Naturally, smaller values of Kn require more iterations. The\nchoice of the cell size of the molecular velocity mesh also plays a role: the smaller is the\nfaster iterations converge; normally we useT2. See the section of numerical\nresults for a numerical study of the inuence of on the accuracy of the results.\nThe conservation property holds for the macroscopic parameters a dened by the\nconventional expression (10). Although on a suciently ne molecular velocity mesh a and q\nd i e r only slightly, on a coarse mesh a is a more accurate approximation to the\nmacroscopic parameters. Therefore, while presenting results of computations, we always\nuse the m od ie d vector a rather than a. Since the model collision integral Q is an inn i t e l y\nsmooth function of all variables the formal approximation order of the mo d ie d discrete\nordinate method (15) is equal to that of the conventional one.\nThe BGK model collision integral does not contain the values of q and thus it is\nsucient to use only the rst ve equations in (17), see [22, 11].\n2 . 6 I m p l i c i t m e t h o d s\nWe have considered explicit advection schemes only. For steady-state applications, how-\never, one-step implicit schemes are more frequently used. On the construction of such\nschemes see e.g. [37, 22]. The essential dierence of the implicit scheme from the explicit\nmethod (15) is the presence of an additional dierential operator in front of the temporal\nderivative. This operator is approximated by rst-order upwind dierences and makes the\nscheme unconditionally stable; it also leads to the appearance of an additional numerical\nsource term and thus to the loss of the global conservation property. However, vanishes\nin the steady-state and we again have the correct approximation to the conservation laws.\nWe also note that for time-dependent calculations the source term is small due to the\ncondition t< 1 and therefore can be neglected. The details are omitted.\n3 Extension to diatomic gases\n3 . 1 T h e m o d e l o f R y k o v\nFor the diatomic gas the distribution function now depends not only on t, r, , but also on\nthe energy of rotational movement e. The Rykov model kinetic equation has the form (1)\nwith the collision integral given by [24]:\nQ(f a ) = rfr + tft (r + t)f(18)\n9Here r, t are the frequencies of nonelastic and elastic collisions, f r f t are the distribution\nfunctions of molecules after nonelastic and elastic collisions, respectively. Let us introduce\nthe following reduced distribution functions [24]\nf 0( t r ) = f d e f 1( t r ) = e f d e\n0 0\nMultiplying (18) by 1, e and integrating with respect to e we obtain the following non-\ndimensional system for f 0, f 1:\nf k f k\n+ ____=H kH k(f ka ) = rf r k +tf t k (r+t)f kk = 0 1 ( 1 9 )\nt r\nwhere\n8 1 n T t 1 8 1 nTt1 1\nr =___________ Z t =5 K n 5 K n Z\nt t\n8 q t v 2 5 8 q t\nv v 2v 5\nf r 0 = f M(T ) 1 + f t 0 = f M(T t) 1 +\n15 0 p T T 2 15 p t T t T t 2\nHere t = (T t) - viscosity, T t, T r translational and rotational temperatures, T\naverage temperature, qt, qr translational and rotational heat uxes, Z = Z ( T rT t) is\nratio of the number of collisions to the number of rotational (nonelastic) collision.\nExpressions for and Z ( T rT t) can be found in [24, 18, 19]:\n( B ) T\nt = T 23 ____________\nt ( B T t) B = T\n3 9 B T tw 0461 + 05581w + 00358w 2(BTt)\nZ ( T tT r) = 4 B T t + 8 ( B T t) 16\nThe expression for Z approximates the results of [21]. For nitrogen we have [20]\nT = 915o K0 = 023541 = 03049\nThese values of 0, 1 are found from the conditions that the heat conductivity coecient\nobtained from the model kinetic equations is equal to its experimentally found value.\n3.2 Approximation conditions and macroscopic parameters\nFor the Rykov model the vector a in the model collision integral is given by\na = ( n u T t T rq t q r)T\nT r w = T t\n) T f M( T ) qrv\np T\n3 2Tt+Trpt =\nf t 1 = T rf t 0 + 4(1 )T rf M(T t) ___ q rv\np\nt\nT\nr\nn T t p = n T = 1155\nf r 1 =T f r 0 +41(1\n52T\n=\n10\nThe approximation conditions (2) on the model collision integral which are used to deter-\nmine the expressions for the vector\nas follows:\na in terms of the distribution function can be written\nd = (20)\nH 0\nH 0\n2H 0 + H 1\nH 1\nv v 2 H 0\nvH 1\n0\n0\n0\n(32)rn (T t T )\n(43 + 2(1 0) 3 Z ) Z rqt\n( 2 + 2(11)(1)Z )Z rqr\nThe rst six equations represent conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy and\ninclude the relaxation of translational and rotational temperatures to the average gas\ntemperature. The last six equations represent the conditions for relaxation of translational\nand rotational heat uxes.\nPerforming exact integration in(20) we obtain the following expressions for macro-\nscopic parameters:\n3 (12)f 0d n n u =\n2\nnT\nt + n u2\n1\nq t = v v 2f 0d n T r = f 1d q r = 1 v f 1d\n2 2\nNote that when the rotational degrees of freedom are frozen ( Z = ), the Rykov\nmodel reduces to the Shakhov model.\n3.3 The conserva t i ve d isc re te ord ina te m e t h o d\nThe conservative version of the discrete ordinate method for the Rykov model is a direct\nextension of the monatomic version from the previous section. The basic idea is again to\nmodify the vector of macroscopic parameters in used in the model collision integral so that\nto ensure the conservation property.\nLet us denote the values of f k in the velocity nodes by f k= f k( t r ) .\nTheconservative discrete ordinate method (8) is now written as:\nf k = D h ( f k) + H k( f ka ) k = 0 1 t\nwhere the modied vector of macroscopic parameters a is obtained by solving the following\nsystem of equations:\nH 0\nH 0\n2H 0 + H 1\nH 1\nvv2H0 v H 1\nA =\n0\n0\n0\n(32)rn (T t T )\n(43 + 2(1 0) 3 Z ) Z rqt\n( 2 + 2 ( 1 1)(1)Z )Z rqr\n(23)\n11\nThe system (23) is a direct approximation of (20) on the given molecular velocity\nmesh and is solved by the Newton iteration method. The rst guess is provided by the\nconventional expressions of the\nform:\n1\nqt = vv2 f1A qr = 1f0A nTr = vf1A\n2 2\nAs for the monatomic model, the method given by (23) remains conservative for any\nKn and A. The choice of the quadrature and is motivated by the same arguments as for\nthe Shakhov model.\n4 Numer ica l examples\nTo illustrate the advantages and robustness of the proposed conservative procedure for\nevaluating macroscopic parameters we calculate two ows: cylindrical Couette ow and\nsupersonic transverse ow over a at plate.\n4 . 1 C y l i n d r i c a l C o u e t t e o w\n4.1.1 Statement of the problem\nA detailed setup of the conventional problem can be found in many papers, e.g. [32, 29, 2].\nConsider a steady-state ow between two i n n i t e coaxial cylinders with radii r1 < r 2. The\nouter cylinder is at rest. The gas ows due to the rotation of the inner cylinder with a\nconstant angle velocity . On the surfaces of the cylinders a constant temperature Tw (the\nsame for both cylinders) is maintained.\nWe introduce the cylindrical coordinate system (r z ), where the z axis coincides\nwith the axis of the cylinders, r is the distance from this axis, and is the azimuthal\ncoordinate. I n velocity space we also introduce a cylindrical coordinate system with the\naxis parallel to the z axis. We will denote by the velocity component in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis of the cylinders and by the angle between this component and\nthe radial direction outward from the symmetry axis so that r = cos , = sin .\nWe use the non-dimensional variables, in which the scales of the spatial coordinate r,\ntemperature and density are given by\nr2\n2\nn0 = ______ rn(r)dr\nr2 2 r2 1 r1\nmean density of the gas between the cylinders.\nreduced by integrating with respect toz [8] and\n3 n nu2nTt + nu2(12)f0A =\nr2Tw n0 (0)\nThe dimension of the\npassing from f to the\nHere, n0 is the\nproblem can be\n12\nvector of reduced distribution function g :\n+\n12 Tf d zg = z\nIn non-dimensional variables the kinetic equation for g in the cylindrical coordinate\nsystem can be written in the following conservative form:\nt(rg)=r(grcos)+___________________(gsin) + rHH = (G g) (26)\nwhere the components of G and the collision frequency are given by\nG = gM\n4\n1+5(1Pr)(S rc r + Sc)(c 2 r + c 2 2)\n4\n(12)T 1+5(1Pr) (S r c r + Sc)(c 2 r +c 2 1)\nn r c 2\ngM=____ T exp(c2 )\n8 n T 1\n= ____\n5 Kn\nHere, Kn = 0r 2 is the Knudsen number, which determines the degree of gas rarefac-\ntion;0 is the free path in the gas at rest with density n 0 and temperature T w.

Sinceweare\nnot interested in correct approximation of the unsteady transition regime from the\ninitial distribution function to the steady state a fully implicit dierence scheme for kinetic\nequation (26) is used. The scheme can be written in the following form [13, 37]:\n1 + c o s s i n + = K n\nt r r\n(28)\n0 (27)\n( q rq )\n=\n13\nK n = (r c o s g ) n + ______(sing)n +r H n r\nNext in variables r , we introduce a nite-volume mesh with cell centers r i, jthat is\nrened toward the surfaces of the cylinders. With respect to we use a uniform mesh with\n14\nnodes k and cell size . The derivatives in the right-hand side are approximated using a\nsecond-order non-oscillatory reconstruction technique described in [15, 16, 36]. Then, the\nrange of is divided into four subdomains depending on the sign of the molecular\nvelocity componentsr ,: + m2 2 + m2, where m = 0 3 . For each subdomain, the\nderivatives with respect to r and on the left-hand side of (28) are approximated by rst-\norder accurate upwind dierences and the distribution function at a new time level is\ndetermined according to a running scheme.\nThe resulting advection scheme (28) can be used for arbitrary Knudsen numbers,\nincluding free-molecular regime, in which the discontinuities of the distribution functions\nplay important role, and the continuum region, in which the second order of accuracy is\nessential to correctly model the ow in the boundary layer.\nThe description of the method is complete once we describe the procedure of com-\nputing the macroscopic parameters (10) in the right hand side. The conventional non-\nconservative expressions can be written as\nHere A j k are the weights used in the quadrature formula. As a rule, the integrals with\nrespect to are evaluated by using the composite Simpson rule, while the integrals with\nrespect to are evaluated by applying the second-order accurate midpoint formula in-\nvolving the distribution function values at the cell centers j .\nEquations (17) for computing macroscopic parameters proposed in this paper take the\nfollowing form (index i is omitted for simplicity):\nj k H1sinH12H1 + H2jkk A j k = 0\nj k (v vr ) jk (v2 r + v2 )H1 + H2jkk A j k = 3( qr q)\n4 (30)\nSystem (30) for the macroscopic gas parameters n, u, T, q r , q is easily solved by\nNewtons method using (29) as the init ial guess.\nTherefore we have two methods of solving the formulated cylindrical Couette problem.\nThe conventional method is given by the advection scheme (28) and non-conservative\nexpressions (29). The method proposed in the present paper is a combination of the same\nimplicit advection scheme (28) but uses (30) for computation of macroscopic quantities.\n4.1.3 Convergence cr i ter ia\nWe use two dierent convergence criteria to stop the time marching to the steady state.\nFor the method proposed in our paper we use the L2 norm of the residual in conservation\nlaws:\nCriteria 1 =R i1 for all i R T H1H12H1 +H2\ni = i j k k A j k (31)\nj k\n2g 1\ng\n1\ng\n1 j k\n1 ( r v ) (2\nr\n2 j k\n+ g2jkk A j k\n+ v2 )g1 + g2jkk A j k\n(29)\n3\nn nu 2nT + nu 2\n15\nwhere 1 is a small prescribed tolerance. Our choice is motivated by the fact that in the\nstationary limit the temporal derivative of the distribution function vanishes, and we must\nhave Kn = 0. Then, expression (31) is a measure of how far the conservation laws are\nfrom the steady state.\nFor the conventional method it may not be possible to satisfy C r i t e r i a 1 due to the\nlack of the conservation property. Therefore we use the following criteria:\nQn+ 1 i_________Qn i L 2\nC r i t e r i a 2 = _______ t 2\nwhere Q = ( n n u E ) , L2 is the L 2 norm, 2 is the small\ntolerance. We remark that in steady-state iteration methods [32, 2] the following condition\nis often used:\nC r i t e r i a 3 = Qn+1\ni Qn i L 22 for all i (33)\nwhere n is now the number of iteration. However, in unsteady computations (32) is a\nmore accurate criteria.\nR e m a r k . We note that since the advection scheme (28) is implicit the resulting method\nof the present paper is not conservative on unsteady solutions in the sense of [3]. However,\nit can be easily shown that in the steady-state limit we have the correct conservative\napproximation to the conservation laws.\n4.1.4 Numer ica l tests\nWe have carried out a number of calculations for the rotation velocity U = 05, cylinder\nradii ratio r1r2 = 1 2 and the range of Knudsen numbers 001 Kn 10. The aim of the\ncalculations was to compare the accuracy of the conventional non-conservative method\n(28),(29) and the its conservative modicaton (28),(30) proposed in this paper. We use the\nsame tolerance value 10 5 both in (31) and (32). Since the advection scheme is essentially\nthe same for both methods, the dierence in the results can be attributed to the way the\nmacroscopic parameters are computed, that is conservative (30) versus nonconservative\n(29).\nSince our goal is to show the dierence between two methods rather than to obtain a\nvery accurate solution to the physical problem, we use in our convergence study a rather\ncoarse non-uniform spatial mesh of N r = 50 cells. I n the molecular velocity space (), 0 5,\n0 2 , a sequence of uniform meshes was considered: 12 50 cells, 20 100 cells and 40\n200 cells.\nWe compare our results with those published in [29] obtained on an exceedingly ne\nmesh using a conventional steady-interation method. In this reference the problem was\nsolver for the BGK model (Pr = 1) and dierent values of the so-called rarefaction\nparameter :\n8 = 5Kn\nWe note that for this particular problem the S and BGK models yield the same results for\nthe shear stress thus making it possible to do a direct comparison.\nfor all i (32)\n16\nTable 1: Comparison with the results of [29] for the shear stress Pr.

Table 2 contains the relative errors (in\npercents) of f u l l l i ng the condition r2Pr= const = A which is the sequence of the kinetic\nequation. I t is obvious that for Kn 1 both conservative and non-conservative methods\nproduce accurate results on the given rather coarse computational mesh. How-ever, as the\nKnudsen number decreases the non-conservative method starts losing its accuracy even for\nthese rather moderate values of Kn whereas the conservative scheme maintainces its high\naccuracy. This is also evident from Table 2.\nTable 3: The relative errors (in percents) of f u l l l i ng the condition r2Pr= const.\nKn 1 0 1 003 001\nConservative scheme\nmesh of 12x50 cells 2.1079 0.8134 2.0863 5.2832\nmesh of 20x100 cells 1.5387 0.3135 0.3773 1.3811\nmesh of 40x200 cells 1.0896 0.4348 0.3303 0.6908\nNon-conservative scheme\nmesh of 12x50 cells 1.8230 8.5605 94.9058 not available\nmesh of 20x100 cells 1.5119 0.5854 6.9609 18.4220\nmesh of 40x200 cells 1.0719 0.4023 0.2796 2.9190\nUnfortunately, the data in [29] does not allow us to carry out the comparison for\n17\nsmaller Kn numbers for which the dierence between conservative and non-conservative\nmethods becomes more evident. We have thus carried out a separate convergence study\nwith respect to the molecular velocity mesh for the same xed spatial mesh of 50 cells.\nSince no reference solution is available to us we use the integral relation r2Pr= const as\nthe measure of the computational error. Table 3 contains the corresponding relative\nerrors. I t is obvious, that for a given molecular velocity mesh the non-conservative method\ncan compete with the conservative one only up to a certain Knudsen number. As Kn\ndecreases, the errors present in the nonconservative computations grow rapidly and at a\ncertain value of Kn the nonconservative method mail fail to provide a solution.\nThe conservative method gives an accurate solution for the shear stress already at\nthe mesh of 20 100 cells. On the other hand, for Kn = 001 the result of the noncon-\nservative method on the nest mesh of 40 200 cells is still inferior to the conservative one\nobtained on the four times coarser mesh of 20 100 cells. We also note that a ner mesh\nrequires more time steps until the converged solution is reached. This translates in a large\ngain in computational eciency as well as memory requirements of the method proposed in\nthis paper over a conventional non-conservative scheme. We also remark that the\nconventional non-conservative method with (30) converges perfectly to the steady state\naccording to a commonly used criteria (32). However, the resulting solution may be\nexceedingly inaccurate.\nFig. 1 shows distributions of density and temperature as functions of the normalized\nspatial coordinate x = (r r1)(r2 r1) for Kn = 01 and two nest molecular velocity meshes: 20\n100 and 40 200 cells. Results of both conventional non-conservative and new\nconservative methods are shown. We observe, that for this Knudsen number the proles\nobtained by the conservative method and that of the nonconservative method on the nest\nmesh agree reasonably well. However, on the 20 100 mesh the nonconservative method is\nrather inaccurate for the temperature p ro le .\nFig. 2 shows distributions of density and temperature for Kn = 001 on all three\nmeshes for the conservative method and on the nest molecular velocity mesh for the\nnonconservative scheme. We remind the reader than on coarser meshes the latter method\neither fails to provide a solution or is very inaccurate. I t is obvious, that density is\ncomputed accurately by the conservative method on all meshes; for temperature the result\non the coarsest mesh is less accurate. Eectively, the results of the conservative scheme on\ntwo nest meshes virtually coincide. On the other hand, the nonconservative method does\nnot provide an acceptable solution even on the nest mesh of 40 200 cells, especially for\nthe temperature p ro le . This observation is in line with Table 3. We also note that when\nthe molecular velocity mesh is further rened to 80 400 cells, the nonconservative solution\nfor temperature does become closer to the conservative one computed on the mesh of 40\n200 cells.\n18\n4.2 Transverse supersonic ow over a plate\nWe study transverse ow of a rareed gas past a zero-thickness plate of nite width L. Both\nmonatomic and diatomic ows are considered. A detailed setup of the problem can be\nfound in [27, 34]. The free stream is characterized by the density n , velocity U,\ntemperature T. We introduce a coordinate system with the x axis aligned with the normal\nto the plate, and y and z axes directed along the plate and spanwise. The plate is\nassumed to be homogeneous. Then the distribution function does not depend on z. The\nboundary condition of complete temperature accommodation of molecules to the surface\ntemperature Tw is used throughout.\nAll calculations were performed for the non-dimensional freestream velocity U = 3\nand plate temperature Tw = 2. For the monatomic gas we use Pr = 23 in the Shakhov\nmodel and = T1 2 (hard spheres). The diatomic gas is taken to be nitrogen with B = 2\nwhich corresponds to the free-stream temperature 183 K. We study the inuence of the\nKnudsen number and degrees of freedom (monatomic versus diatomic gas) on distribution\nof macroscopic parameters as well as the aerodynamic characteristics of the plate such as\nthe drag cD and heat transfer cH coecient given by the following expressions\n1 2\n2\ncD= __ (Pxx(0y)Pxx(0+y))dy U2\n1 2\ncH =\n1 2\nE1 (Ex(0y) Ex(0+y))dy\nx\n1 2\nHere the free-stream energy ux is Ex = 1 2(U3 + 5 2U) for the monatomic gas and E x=\n1\n2(U3 + 7 2U) for the diatomic gas.\n4.2.1 M e t h o d of the solut ion\nThe problem is solved in the non-dimensional variables as given by (4) so that the plate\ncorresponds to x = 0, 1 2 y 1 2 . Since the distribution function and macroscopic\nparameters do not depend on z the dimension of the problem can be reduced by eliminat-\ning the molecular velocity componentz normal to the plane of the ow [8]. As a result, the\ndistribution function depends on time t, two spatial coordinates x, y and two molecular\nvelocity componentsx,y. The resulting kinetic equation is thus four-dimensional.\nWe incorporated the proposed conservative procedure into a implicit nite-volume\nTVD scheme for the kinetic equation, similar to (28). For Kn 03 we use a non-uniform\nspatial mesh of 130 180 cells in the computational domain 55 x 8, y 10. The cell size\nvaried from 0 1 0 2 away from the plate to 0002 in the Knudsen layer for the spatial\nmesh. For Kn 1 a dierent mesh of 140 165 cells was used with the\ndomain size 15 x 15, 15 15. The computational domain in the molecular\nvelocity space wasx9, 0y 9. Here we used the symmetry of the velocity\ndistribution function with respect toy. The mesh used was uniform with = 045. The\nfourth-order composite Simpson rule is used for constructing the weights A and\nevaluating integrals with respect to the molecular velocity.\n19\ncD cH\nKn 0.003 0.03 0.3 0.003 0.03 0.3\n= 090 1.644 1.585 1.759 0.025 0.0633 0.1897\n= 045 1.641 1.673 1.845 0.024 0.0664 0.1966\n= 025 1.641 1.673 1.845 0.024 0.0665 0.1966\nTable 4: Dependence of cD and heat transfer cH coecients on (monatomic gas).\n4.2.2 I n u e n c e of\nWe study inuence of the cell size in the molecular velocity mesh on the accuracy of the\nsolution. To do so, we consider in addition to the basic molecular velocity mesh with\n= 045 two more meshes: a coarse mesh with = 09 and a ne mesh with =\n025. The results obtained with the nest mesh are used as the reference. I t is well known,\nthat one can expect to obtain a reasonable accuracy only if = m i n T2. However,\nr\ndue to the conservative nature of the method one may hope to get acceptable results with\nlarger , especially for small Knudsen numbers. I n fact, this property of conservative\nmethods is often used in computations with the exact Boltzmann equations [7] in order to\nreduce the cost of evaluating the ve dimensional collision integral. We note however, that\nthe numerical solution of the exact kinetic equation does not require the computation of\nthe macroscopic parameters at each time step since there are not part of the equation. As\na result, we cannot automatically generalize this property of conservative methods to\nmodel kinetic equations.\nTable 4 shows aerodynamic coecients of the plate as a function of . I t is obvious that\nfor the smallest Kn = 0003 the computed values of drag and heat transfer coecients are\nvery close for all meshes. When the Knudsen number increases so that the ow\nbecomes more rareed we begin to see the dierence. For Kn = 03 the coarsest mesh\nleads to an error in the aerodynamics coecients at about 3 5 % , which may be considered\nas signicant.\nFigs. 3 4 present distribution of density and pressure over the both sides of the plate for\nKn = 03 as a function of . We see that on the upwind side the proles\ncorresponding to = 045 and = 025 are virtually identical whereas the solution\nwith = 09 has an error of about 6%. For the downwind side the inuence of\nis somewhat larger the solutions on two nest meshes being dierent of around 5% for\ndensity and 3% for pressure. The coarse mesh computation has a signicantly larger\nerror. Figs. 5 6 present the same convergence study but for a smaller Knudsen number\nKn = 0003. We see that solutions on two nest meshes ( = 045 and = 025) are\nvirtually identical. However, for the downwind side the use of = 09 still gives a visible\nerror. The observed errors in pressure proles for results on dierent velocity meshes are\nconsistent with those in the drag coecients given in Table 4.\nThe numerical examples presented in this subsection show that overall i t is sucient to\nuse 05, especially for small Knudsen numbers when the ow is in a near-continuum\n20\nKn 0.003 0.01 0.1 1 10\nmonatomic cD 1.641 1.656 1.723 2.091 2.653 2.947\ncH 0.024 0.039 0.116 0.330 0.558 0.652\nnitrogen cD 1.704 1.705 1.782 2.161 2.708 2.947\ncH 0.021 0.034 0.103 0.290 0.460 0.520\nTable 5: Drag cD and heat transfer cH coecients for U = 3 and Tw = 2.\nregime. The use of smaller is j us t ied only if an accurate computation of the low-density\nregion behind the plate for transitional and large Knudsen numbers is necessary. This is\ndue to the fact that for these Kn discontinuities of the velocity distribution function\noriginating from the edges of the plate do not diminish rapidly enough in that region. In\nthis situation one may use for better eciency a non-uniform molecular velocity mesh\nr e n e d towards the originx =y = 0.\n4.2.3 Comparison of monatomic and diatomic results\nTable 5 contains dependencies of the drag cD and heat transfer cH coecients for both\ngases. We rst note that in the limiting case Kn = and given boundary conditions on the\nplate the drag coecient is the same for both models. The heat transfer coecient is\ndierent though. For nite Knudsen numbers we see clear inuence of the number of\ndegrees of freedom on the aerodynamic properties of the plate in the whole range of\nKnudsen numbers.\nWe also note that in order to cross check our method we have computed the drag and\nheat coecients in Table 5 for Kn 1 by the code from [34]. Identical results have been\nobtained.\nFig. 7,8 show the density and temperature proles along the symmetry line (normal to\nthe plate) for the transitional ow with Kn = 01. The position of the plate corresponds to\nthe origin x = 0. We observe typical pro les, with a tendency to the formation of the bow\nshock wave and the sharp boundary layer upstream of the plate and a region of low\ndensity after the plate. The ow is overall far from equilibrium. I t is especially well seen\nfrom the proles of Tt and Tr for nitrogen, which are quite dierent around the plate. The\ntemperature jump on the plate is quite large. However, in the far eld x the ow begins to\nresemble continuum.\nFor the second much smaller Knudsen number Kn = 0003 we see a standard ow\npattern with a bow shock wave and exceedingly thin boundary layer with very sharp\ngradients of density and temperature. The temperature jump is negligible and the ow is in\nequilibrium everywhere except at the shock front and the Knudsen layer. Fig. 9 shows\now streamlines for nitrogen. We clearly see the formation of the recirculation zone as\nthe Knudsen number is decreased.\n21\n5 Conclusions\nA conservative procedure for evaluating macroscopic parameters of the gas in the discrete\nordinate method for the nonlinear model kinetic equations of Shakhov and Rykov has\nbeen presented. Conservation laws are satised for arbitrary values of the Knudsen num-\nber. Additionally, the correct evaluation of the heat ux is ensured in the limit of small\nKnudsen numbers.\nThe proposed method has been successfully used to calculate the cylindrical Couette\now and supersonic transverse ow past a at plate in the broad range of the Knudsen\nnumber. The numerical results show that our method leads to signicant savings in\ncomputer time and memory and is robust enough to be used in supersonic ows with\nsharp gradients.\nAcknowledgments.
