As a consequence, managers and owners often fail to develop strategies for\ncoping with challenge or crisis the next time it occurs. The result is that many organizations are\ndoomed to repeat the same or similar mistakes over and over again in a form of corporate d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. To\ngain insights into how companies can better manage in hostile environments, we consider the\nsolutions that have evolved in nature over billions of years. We trace nature\u2019s codes for adapting to\nhostile environments and explore the underlying characteristics of four genetic code types that can\nhelp business organizations to offset the negative implications of hostility through ensuring strategic\nfit. We link the four genetic codes most frequently found in nature with organizational capabilities.\nWhen correctly identified and leveraged, these capabilities can enable a company to focus attention\nand resource on how to manage successfully in hostile environments.\nKey words\nHostile environment, genetic codes, organizational capabilities, strategic fit, coping strategies,\nstrategic adaptation, biomimesis.\n3\n4COMING TO TERMS WITH HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS\nHostile environments \u2013 defined by natural scientists as a set of unstable external conditions \u2013 have\nbecome a clarion call for business. Consider the now defunct Lehman Brothers, not so long ago the\nfourth largest investment bank in the United States. It was considered one of Wall Street's biggest\ndealers in fixed-interest trading and was heavily invested in securities linked to the US sub-prime\nmortgage market (Schwartz & Bajaj, 2007). In 2008, the environment was turning hostile, with\ninvestments shunned as high risk. After the collapse of Bear Stearns in early 2008, it was no surprise\nthat confidence in Lehman Brothers would be hit. In its June to August 2008 period, the bank made\nwrite downs of $700 million as it adjusted the value of its investments in residential mortgages and\ncommercial property to the decline of the market value of such assets. However, this figure soared to\n$7.8 billion, which resulted in Lehman reporting the largest net loss in its history. The bank also\nadmitted that it still had $54 billion of exposure to hard-to-value mortgage-backed securities. With its\npeers and the government reluctant to extend a helping hand, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection\nin September 2008. We can see in this example that hostile environments can hit companies\u2019 hard.\nBut could it have turned out differently for Lehman if they possessed an instinctive coping strategy\nfor surviving the hostility of the US sub-prime mortgage meltdown? By \u201ccoping strategies\u201d we mean\nthe collective behavioral tools and techniques that individuals, animals and organizations routinely\nuse to counteract or conquer adversity and turbulence, without actually correcting or removing the\nunderlying causes. These are strategic in that they are about how to survive and are fundamental to\nthe continued existence of the organism or organization.\nEven without the threat or likelihood of corporate failure, the challenges of senior managers\nincrease exponentially as they strive to lead their companies in business environments characterized\nby hostility (Duncan, Yeager & Rucks, 2011, McGrath & MacMillan, 2009). In a fast paced,\ninterconnected world, high impact and often improbable political and economic events make hostility\n5the new default environment. In extreme situations, man-made or natural disasters can threaten the\nvery survival of the organization in their given industries (Duncan, Yeager & Rucks, 2011). At the\nvery least, hypercompetition (Ilinitch, D\u2019Aveni & Lewin, 1996), characterized by intense inter-\ncompany rivalry, rapidly evolving markets and ease of entry into new markets, has become the norm\nin most industries. Sustainable competitive advantage is increasingly rare and is declining in duration.\nConsequently, most companies in given industries can at best aspire to temporary advantages\n(D\u2019Aveni, 1994; Wiggins & Ruefli, 2005) and research indicates that the temporary (volatile)\ncomponent of competitive advantage is increasing compared with the long-term sustainable\ncomponent (D\u2019Aveni, Dagnino & Smith, 2010; Thomas & D\u2019Aveni, 2009).\nThe purpose of this paper is to look at how animals deal with their hostile environments in\norder to provide fresh insights into how business managers can approach their uncertain\nenvironments. In these circumstances, how can companies develop the organizational survival\ninstincts needed to ensure strategic fit in hostile environments? We understand strategic fit to mean\nthe appropriateness of a company\u2019s resource-base for their given industry and strategy in terms of its\nalignment with the environmental or organizational threats and opportunities facing the business\n(Hofer & Schendel, 1978; Zajac, Kraatz and Bresser, 2000). Lessons from nature offer insights into\nthe limits of and potential for business management survival strategies (Penrose, 1953; Gavetti,\nLevinthal & Rivkin, 2005). Animals can thrive in environments that are much more deadly than the\nmarketplaces that businesses operate in. By looking at how animal species deal with hostile\nenvironments we can gain fresh insights into the capabilities by which companies coded for specific\nindustries can help adapt to external hostility (Clippinger, 1999; Plotkin, 1994; Zimmer, 2007).\nManagers can learn from animals that have evolved instincts of coping in hostile environments over\nbillions of years (Benyus, 1997; Winter, 2004). In other words, managers need to learn which genes,\nor capabilities, they need to switch on and which to switch off. We therefore advocate a bionic\nanalogy between animals and industries to suggest alternative capabilities to achieve or reestablish\n6strategic fit. Managers can consequently make choices about how they can better equip their\ncompanies for business survival.\nNelson & Winter (1982) view organizational capabilities as the ability of companies to use\nroutines and resources in changing environments. More precisely, it is the bundling of resources that\nbuilds capabilities (Sirmon, Hitt & Ireland, 2007). The empirical research on the development and\ndeployment of organizational capabilities concentrates mainly on specific processes and routines such\nas pricing (Dutta, Zbaracki & Bergen, 2003) and marketing (Morgan, Zou, Vorhies & Katsikeas,\n2003). Although strategic management researchers use various constructs to define capabilities, there\nis consensus that a capability is a distinctive and superior way of allocating, coordinating, and\ndeploying resources (Schreyogg & Kliesch-Eberl, 2007). Whilst capabilities are company specific,\nthey share a basic common structure (Teece, 2007). The evolution of capabilities (Helfat & Peteraf,\n2003; Stinchcombe, 1965), similar to an innovation process that is based on variation, selection and\nretention, is triggered by the need to adapt them to achieve fit, even in hostile environments. Looking\nat capabilities that have evolved in nature in response to hostile environments allows us to explore the\nlessons that business enterprises may learn. We then translate these lessons into concepts that can\nassist managers in choosing strategies and developing capabilities that facilitate fit.\nLEVERAGING BIOMIMESIS IN MANAGEMENT\nVelcro in design, passive cooling in architecture, water repellent surfaces (lotus effect), or friction\nreducing sharkskin swimsuits are all among the better known commercial applications based on\ninsights derived from nature. The systematic approach to explore and use nature\u2019s solutions is called\nbiomimesis - derived from the Greek words for life (bio) and imitation (mimesis). In each of the\nabove cases, through observation and analysis of how specific problems are solved in nature, an\nanalogy has helped develop a high-value mechanism, property or process based on a model in nature.\n7Developing solutions that have functionalities similar to those found in nature, yet with a commercial\nor social utility, lies at the heart of the biomimetic method (or biomimicry). Already widely applied\nin design, engineering and the sciences to exploit nature\u2019s successful ideas (Bar-Cohen, 2006; Benyus,\n1997; Vincent, 1998), we employ the biomimetic method in this paper to determine how animal\nsurvival instincts and practices can enable a more innovative and effective approach to the strategies\nand underlying capabilities of organizations striving to withstand hostile environments.\nAnalyzing basic resemblances as shown in Table 1, we explore the fit between the survival\nstrategies of animals with their hostile environments using three metrics familiar to managers\n(Gadagkar, 1997).\nInsert Table 1 about here\nPrincipally the metrics in Table 1 relate to four interrelated issues. Firstly, the hostile environment\nmay require organisms and organizations to focus on cost efficiency and effectiveness to meet their\nobjectives. Second, focusing on cost efficiency is essential for managers in modern organizations\nthat face less favorable market conditions. Similarly in the natural world, when the context turns\nhostile animals need to economize on their usage of energy to survive. Thirdly, increasing the\nnumber of customers, their satisfaction and their amount of business is imperative for positive cash\nflow and organic growth \u2013 key metrics for managers. In the same way, for subsistence, growth and\nreproduction, animals need to locate and catch calories to survive. Finally, similar to organizations`\nobjectives, animals seek to avoid disruptions and safeguard continuity. Business disruptions threaten\nperformance in the short, mid and the long term. Animals need to avoid dangers - a prey needs to\navoid a predator - and just like in the business world, animals and managers are often blind to the\nhigh impact, hostile events. Such analogies have their hazards, but here they help us to conceptualize\n8and illustrate alternative strategies for managers dealing with external hostility (Bonabeau, Dorigo &\nHeraulaz, 1999; Gavetti & Rivkin, 2005).\nWe sought to understand whether the survival capabilities and resultant strategies that have\nevolved in animals also resonate with managers who are struggling with hostile environments. Our\nresearch had four phases. The first phase included clustering various ways in which animals ensure\nsurvival in hostile environments and collating these survival strategies from the animal kingdom.\nDrawing on biomimicry, the second phase of our research led us to the identification of four basic\ncoping capabilities and survival strategies that have evolved in animals and that can be successfully\ndeployed by managers. In the third phase, to gain a better understanding of the challenges managers\nface in managing in their environment, we pretested the ideas with small groups of participants in\nstrategic management executive programs at Rotterdam School of Management and in the Master of\nScience programs at EMLYON Business School and Grenoble School of Management. When we\ndiscussed our ideas with participants, they concurred with these survival strategies. In the fourth\nphase we discussed the emergent strategies with groups of experienced managers registered on\nCranfield School of Management\u2019s Executive MBA program in 2009-10 and Imperial College\nLondon\u2019s Full-Time and Executive MBA programs in 2010-11 who also concurred with the survival\nideas. Our research and subsequent individual discussions with a sample of delegates enabled us to\ndiscern how they managed their businesses in hostile environments and which of our four coping\nstrategies best illustrates their approach to cope with and survive hostile environments.\nORGANIZATIONS CODED FOR INDUSTRIES\nAnimal survival instincts are largely encoded in their genes and these genes are active or switched on,\nfunctioning as capabilities in the way we previously discussed this term. They allow the innovative\nbiological infrastructure and storage areas of learning to develop and accumulate through\n9evolutionary processes. As a result, bears hibernate when food is scarce and seagulls flee from threat\nof danger. The implications are that innate survival strategies offer highly efficient reflexes to\ncounteract hostile environments that a species frequently encounters. Other elements of animal\nbehavioral routines are clearly learned through experience - real or simulated (playing). Lion cubs\nfirst play how to fight and learn how to hunt in packs before adulthood.\nHowever, greater variability in how hostile environments differ may expose limits to one or\nthe other strategy (Mintzberg 1991). Consider a poisonous animal encountering a new predator that is\nimmune to its venom. Similarly, consider the poison pills that can help management avoid unsolicited\ntakeovers of their company. Then suddenly regulatory change renders these strategic responses illegal.\nIn other words, animals are largely locked into their own particular species` survival strategy, just as\ncompanies can remain locked into their industries. Especially related to such enterprises, highly\nunlikely events with devastating consequences have become known as black swans (Taleb, 2010).\nIncreasing the odds of survival is possible if a species can manage more than one survival strategy\nand the transition between strategies. In nature, also this adaptability is largely encoded. For instance,\nbears can both fight and hibernate when appropriate. Organizations need to develop similar\ncombinations of operational capabilities (Flynn, Wu & Melnyk, 2010) that ensure the exploitation of\nexpertise in industries, but they also need to ensure strategic or dynamic capabilities that enable an\norganization to renew and adapt to increasingly hostile environments.\nWhile animals are preprogrammed by their genetic code, which defines their species,\norganizations are preprogrammed by existing industries and can adapt to changing circumstances,\noften through learning from their own or others experiences (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003; March, 1991;\nSenge, 1990; Stinchcombe, 1965). Organizations develop highly specialized operational capabilities\nto exploit existing opportunities (March, 1991) and they seek to develop dynamic capabilities\nenabling them to modify existing capabilities (Helfat, Finkelstein, Mitchell, Peteraf, Singh, Teece &\nWinter, 2007). The specialization or fit of animals in specific environments or niches helps them to\n10\neschew rivalry and ensures survival. Similar to specific organizational forms that align with specific\nindustries, animals\u2019 adaptation to their environments can enhance fitness. This relative degree of\nspecialization (genetic and behavioral) makes these survival strategies highly effective in\nenvironments that are hostile in specific and stable ways.\nFOUR CAPABILITIES-BASED PRACTICES FOR ENSURING STRATEGIC FIT\nWe can see that the majority of industries have predetermined codified capabilities. It follows that\ncompanies are coded to succeed in their industries, similar to animals for specific niches. However,\ncompanies are also coded for the founders\u2019 values and goals (Stinchcombe 1965) in the way that\nphenotypes build on genotypes. We believe the phenotypes can change quickly, while industries take\nlonger to evolve. In Table 2, we attempt to capture the key industries that we explored to see if these\nindustries developed flight, fight, search or sleep capabilities. For instance, aerospace manufacturers\nare founded by military personnel or entrepreneurs, auto manufacturers are founded by engineers or\nmarketing experts and private equity companies are founded by bankers, scientists and politicians.\nThe specific founders and their values codify the way companies behave and may alter the industry\nspecific codes, which has implications for capabilities developed to cope with hostile environments.\nHowever, the key implication is that companies could perhaps develop other complimentary coping\ncapabilities, an important point that the masters\u2019 students and executives strongly supported in our\ndiscussions. The following section explores in more detail the four strategies and related capabilities\nfor creating strategic fit with a specific hostile environment.\nInsert Table 2 about here\n11\nPractice 1: Build a Fighting Capability \u2013 Attack an Obvious Source of Hostility\nPutting up a fight is the strategy of choice for well-resourced, aggressive companies in specifically\nhostile environments that threaten to erode their competitive advantages. Fighting requires readiness.\nLions illustrate the distinct survival instincts to master the harsh hostility of their environments.\nWhen faced with specific threats from other dominant animals, they become alert and are able to\nattack swiftly and with forceful strikes using multiple adaptations. Lions are generally quick with\ngreat vision and can be vicious if challenged for resources or territory. In the merciless heat of the\nsavannah, these powerful beasts clash with cheetahs and hyenas for the terrain and prey that\nguarantees survival. These conflicts are direct, involve tremendous force and reserves of resource and\nare, at times, merciless. Lions are prepared for the moment of truth, when they need to ensure\nsurvival and they will expend all necessary energy and effort to avoid defeat. Typically organizations\nthat follow lion strategies take a proactive role in going after new customers and may adopt direct and\nforceful approaches in doing so. These companies confront and tackle competitors rapidly and with\nsignificant resource deployment. This may result in price war or an advertising blitz. These fighting\nstrategies are pursued by proactive companies that want to face down competition and control their\nhostile environment instead of having it control them.\nTo see a lion strategy applied to organizations, we have only to look at Google\u2019s attacks on\nMicrosoft (Vascellaro & Smith, 2009). Having bided their time and built up market strength and\nbrand equity, Google then launched a full frontal assault on the once dominant software giant,\nchallenging Microsoft for existing markets in word processing and spreadsheet applications and\ntrumping them in new markets such as cloud computing. Software installed on personal computers is\nwhere Microsoft makes its living but Google see the prospect of 90 percent of computing tasks\nmigrating to the Web-based cloud. The two adversaries are also fighting it out in promising new\n12\nmarket spaces as varied as Web maps, online video and cell phone software (Lohr, 2009). Like the\nlion, Google has evolved so that it can fight any predator and catch any prey with their strength of\ninnovation and market perseverance.\nPractice 2: Embracing Flight Capabilities \u2013 Move Quickly Away From Hostile Environments\nSeagulls are astoundingly agile birds. They are capable of thriving in many different environments\nand can move rapidly to avoid specific threats to their survival. Being able to fly obviously helps\nthem to escape from danger but their agility also derives from their seeming ability to eat just about\nanything. A seagull\u2019s robust digestive system has evolved to enable it to cope with a wide variety of\nfood. Companies pursuing a seagull strategy have the agility to move rapidly to avoid threats,\ncoupled with a capability to survive and thrive in differing environments. Seagull companies can\ncombine agility and adaptability to cope with specific hostility. They can swiftly escape from specific\nthreats and relocate and thrive somewhere less hostile. But in order to do this, their basic approach to\nvalue creation must be highly tolerant to changes in the business environment.\nCompanies that are able to shift the location of their facilities from one country to another to\ntake advantage of lower wage costs or even change product-market combinations are exhibiting\nseagull capabilities. In order to do this the core processes of value creation must be robust and not\noverly dependent on specific contexts or locally available skills. Typically these companies have\nhighly developed systems that do not require specific types of scarce labor or other inputs. Their\nknow-how has been invested in the development of these robust assets and processes, which can be\nput into operation by employees who do not need to have company-specific know-how. The valuable\nassets of the company are its systems, processes, patents, brand names and so on, which can be\nrelocated or adapted. These assets are either physically mobile or are capable of rapidly flexing and\nadapting to produce different products or services. So for example, where such a company faces\n13\nincreasing labor costs this adaptability can be packaged up and physically transplanted to a more\nattractive labor market context.\nSimilarly, like seagulls, some companies are able to swiftly exit declining markets and rapidly\nexploit emerging markets. They can sense a threat ahead of rival companies, and their asset\nconfiguration enables them to rapidly change what they produce or the services they offer. Some\nretailers seem to be more agile than others, being able to observe when product lines are likely to face\ndeclining demand, and to be able to switch to new lines faster than rivals.\nAn example of a successful seagull enterprise is Phoenix. This financial services company\nserves the investment needs of high net worth individuals and is currently head quartered in Dublin,\nIreland. However, it is a subsidiary of the Italian bank Unicredito. Why Dublin? The business was\nable to benefit from tax incentives and regulatory advantages on offer in Dublin. Should these\ndisappear, Phoenix could conceivably relocate elsewhere, swiftly and without considerable costs.\nGiven that its sales network is distributed across Europe, and assuming they can recruit local talent,\nthese activities could be supported just as effectively from, say, Bratislava or Warsaw.\nPractice 3: Developing Search Capabilities \u2013 Continuously Looking for Opportunities and\nThreats\nAnimals with search capabilities typically use their stamina to survive in hostile environments.\nSharks are creatures that have been around for millions of years. The shark epitomizes such\nendurance and serves here as an illustration of organizational search capability. Knowing\ninstinctively how to bear prolonged hardship and survive, they have staying power and know\ninstinctively when and how to surge to reclaim territory. They are the most efficient predator in their\ndomains and protect their hunting ground through vigilance and persistence. Organizational\nendurance is dependent on an ability to search for and find resources and sources of value \u2013\n14\ncustomers or acquisitions \u2013 even in the most hostile of environments and often at long distances.\nMost of all, search strategy is associated with a killer instinct that works to locate and secure the prey,\nregardless of environmental distractions or obstacles, and serves to ward off competitors through\ndeploying superior strength and force.\nTo see shark strategy in action we can look at The Coca-Cola Company (hereafter Coca-Cola)\nafter 2004. The sudden death of CEO Roberto Goizueta in 1997 led to a period of strategic drift for\nCoca-Cola, with PepsiCo eclipsing its once dominant rival, particularly in the U.S. market. The\nCoca-Cola shark\u2019s dorsal and tail fins had been damaged, causing the corporate animal to lose\nstability and veer off course. The new appointed CEO, Neville Isdell, swiftly repaired the damage,\nreturning Coca-Cola to good health through a diversification strategy intended to establish the\ncorporation as the world\u2019s dominant competitor in a broad range of beverages. His vision was simple:\nto firmly establish Coca-Cola as a total, non-alcoholic beverage company, seizing opportunities to\nrespond to consumer\u2019s beverage needs at every stage in their day, every day, everywhere. Today,\nafter showing persistence and stamina, the corporation has recaptured territory lost to an assortment\nof smaller companies and especially to its archrival, PepsiCo. It has more than 3,000 different\nbeverage products and 13 brands with annual revenues in excess of $35 billion. It is the global\nnumber one in sparkling drinks, fruit juices and ready to drink coffee and teas; number two in sports\nand energy drinks and number three in packaged water. In addition to successful acquisitions and\nalliances such as Glac\u00e9au in the US, Aquavision in Russia and Innocent in the UK, Coca-Cola\ninvested in-house, resulting in innovative products such as the highly successful Coca-Cola Zero.\nThese twin organic and inorganic growth strategies enabled the company to respond to changing\ntastes and demands, particularly in established markets, for more healthy and \u2018wellness\u2019-oriented\nproducts. After 2004, Coca-Cola also leveraged internationally disseminated competencies in\nbranding, supply, distribution and sales, cemented a decade earlier, to push Coca-Cola ahead of\nPepsiCo in the global battle for sales and acquisitions. In so doing, Coca-Cola reasserted the\n15\ncorporation\u2019s focus, strength and dominance in established markets and rendered it more swift and\nagile in vast emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia.\nBoth sharks and lions are formidable predators. The key difference between them is the lion\nattacks specific rivals and threats within its domain or hunting grounds, whereas the shark roams far\nand wide in its search for prey, enabling it to offset general threats that may affect less mobile or\nagile animals. Overly driven and too finely tuned, Sharks also happen to swallow metal cans and car\ntires. This can happen to a company too. A business cannot prepare for a hostile environment by\nbecoming a machine that indiscriminately seeks too many customers. It must have the structure and\nresources in place to search and exploit the right opportunities that ensure strategic market fit.\nPractice 4: Embracing Hibernation Capabilities \u2013 Displaying a Capacity to Conserve Energy\nWhen cold weather turns rain into snow and ice, food is harder to find and, at some point, seems to\ndisappear entirely. Consequently, animals such as bears prepare to spend time in their winter quarters,\nwith significantly reduced energy and activity levels. In doing so, they spend the critical months of\ngeneral weather hostility more or less asleep in a safe domicile, waiting for spring. Evolution has\nproduced innovations such as hibernation as a response to seasonal hostility.\nDo companies choose to radically alter their behavior and their organizational metabolism\nwhen the general environment turns hostile? The answer is a resounding yes. We have witnessed the\ndramatic changes that periodically alter organizational processes in fast moving consumer goods\n(FMCG) companies, automobile manufacturing, tourism, fashion and farming. During the high\nseason, enterprises in these sectors exploit to the maximum all available resources, knowing that\nseasonality will cause a slump in demand for the remainder of the year.\nIn agriculture, part time employees` contracts end when the harvest is over \u2013 when the farm\nmanagers and owners reduce activity levels dramatically. In periods of relative rest, organizations can\n16\nfocus on repair, maintenance, improvement and preparation. Similar to craftsmen who fix and\nimprove the tools that broke in the heat of the high season, companies in sectors ranging from\nbuilding and construction to hotel services slow down periodically. Seasonality in FMCG businesses\nallows companies to prepare for the next season by developing new products and manufacturing\nduring the off-season to build stock, while temporarily reining in marketing and sales spend.\nThe most recent, dramatic frosting of the world economy, following the US mortgage and\nbanking crisis, showcases how companies can outcompete their rivals with sleep and size strategies.\nAfter the Lehman shock, banks ceased to give out loans, which was for many a core activity. That is\nto say, they radically reduced their activity levels. The automobile industry was one of the hardest hit\nby this shortage of credit for consumers, historically high oil prices, and concerns about global\nwarming - three crises frozen together in one long winter. With Chrysler and GM severely hit,\nconsider how other automobile companies executed their sleep and size strategy even in these most\nsevere of times.\nHonda is a case in point. Between September and December 2008, Honda unexpectedly\naccumulated a 102-day stock of Honda and Acura vehicles, up from a 30-day supply on September 1.\nHonda quickly moved into a hibernation strategy and lowered its activity level in several ways.\nHonda stopped production on December 22 and 23, and did so for the good part of a week in the\nfollowing month. Originally Honda had intended to manufacture 1,468,000 vehicles up to March 31\n2009; the adjusted production goal for the financial year was still 1,293,000 cars and light trucks.\nAdapting to new conditions, Honda put its new models and concepts such as the latest Honda NSX,\nCR-Z hybrid, and the S 2000 on hold and pulled out of Formula 1, citing the high costs involved as\nirreconcilable with the harsh conditions. Aiming at savings of billions of dollars for new product\ndevelopment, Honda consolidated the originally separately developed local and global versions of the\nHonda Acura into one version. Honda focused new product development efforts on small city hybrids\nincluding super minis. Honda cut down the number of cars produced, especially in those countries\n17\nwhere the crisis hit hardest. In North America, the manufacturer cut production for the first quarter of\n2009, which came in addition to the 56,000 cars that had already been canceled.\nNote that most of Honda\u2019s decisions shrank the need for resources, reduced the activity level\nand put units, parts or projects in hibernation \u2013 without ending them or severing relationships core to\nthe business. Compare a reduction of workforce with the reduction of work hours, a move typical of\nhibernation strategies. Terminating work contracts is permanent, difficult and costly to reverse. A\nreduction of working hours amends contracts in ways that can be changed back quickly. In other\nwords, hibernation can allow for high flexibility because low levels of activity still include\nmonitoring the environment and the triggering of adequate metabolic and behavioral reaction.\nIf organizations cannot forecast and assess the duration of a hostile environment, they may\nfail to sustain low activity levels long enough to see conditions improve. When the environment\nbecomes highly volatile and unpredictable, badly executed hibernation strategies can set companies\nup for disaster. Waking up in mid winter because the reserves are exhausted exposes the animal to the\nrisk of starvation. Consider cases where companies had depleted their financial resources in the\nmiddle of the recent credit crunch. Management theorists refer to organizational reserves as slack, i.e.\nexcess resources that add to overall costs but that can provide a fallback in hard times and that can\nenable the company to adapt to changing environments. Building slack is an optimization challenge\nthat necessitates predicting environmental change with (relative) certainty. However, when low\nvisibility and high environmental hostility make meaningful estimates impossible, companies should\nselect a different strategy. Hibernation is a risky strategy, if seasonality cannot be predicted. But\nsome can get it right. Consider Japan Steel Works (JSW), the only company in the world that\nproduces machine pressure vessels which house the coolant and reactor core of nuclear facilities.\nAfter a protracted time period during which nuclear energy was out of favor with politicians and the\npublic, it returned to the fore and JSW enjoyed the benefits of \u2018spring\u2019 in its particular markets. Its\norder books filled for years to come. However, this nuclear renaissance experienced a dramatic turn\n18\nof fortune in early 2011. The Japanese earthquake of March 2011 and resultant devastating tsunami\nand nuclear meltdown in the Fukushima nuclear facilities, once again called into question the safety\nand viability of nuclear power around the world. The crisis triggered political debate in other\ncountries with sizeable nuclear energy capability, such as Germany, Italy and the U.S. The\nwidespread reconsideration of nuclear power appears to foreshadow another winter for the nuclear\nindustry at a moment when companies had just hoped for an invigorating upturn.\nIn summary, as seen from the four practices above, our framework of practices to create\nstrategic fit with the environment (Table 3) includes options that cover a wide range of possible\nactions as observed in nature: flight, flight, search and sleep. These can be seen as interchangeable\nand complementary, depending on the nature of the hostility. Realizing one or combinations of these\noptions can involve challenging strategic change, as they are likely to be new to the company.\nIntroducing such innovative practices often translates into alterations in a company\u2019s structures,\nsystems, routines and culture. They can be assessed by static outcome measures such as energy usage\n(costs in companies), calorie consumption (customer attainment in companies), and other \u2018strategy\u2019\nmeasures such as speed, flexibility and vision, as seen in Table 3.\nInsert Table 3 about here\nKEY LESSONS \u2013 BEGIN THE JOURNEY\nAnimals, predator and prey alike, seek to safeguard continuity of existence and survival of the\nindividual and its species by establishing the balance between calorie intake and energy usage over\ntime. In discussions with executives throughout our research process it emerged that combinations of\nthe four practices are possible but some combinations are more promising than others. Birds are\n19\nskilled at searching and scanning the surface for prey and predators alike. Searching capabilities\nallows companies to spot opportunities and threats (Teece, 2007). The main challenge related to\nsearching lies in developing effective routines without incurring high costs. Predators cannot waste\ntheir energy on searching only \u2013 they still have a catch to make. Likewise, prey cannot exhaust their\nresources by analyzing their environment in detail until it is too late \u2013 timely escape routines need to\nbe triggered to ensure survival.\nWe believe that stamina, alertness and rapid action enable combinations, as they support fight,\nflight, search and sleep. Some industries are predetermined to have stamina, having regularly\nexperienced hostile environments, as emerged in our conversations with corporate executives. For\ninstance, automobile manufacturing, tourism and air transport. Similarly, alertness helps enable\ncompanies to activate the most appropriate capability at the right moment, such as shifting from\nsearch to fight. The time it takes to shift should not leave organizations defenseless. Hence the ability\nto rapidly take action is as fundamental as stamina and alertness. However, in addition managers need\nto develop and switch on the four specific capabilities of fight, flight, search and sleep, so as to\nmanage in hostile environments. That said, combining these four strategies is not trivial. The agility\nrequired to swiftly flee does not naturally convert into sufficient physical strength to take a stand and\nfight. The best runners rarely make good prize fighters. Likewise, hibernating is not an action pattern\nnaturally conducive to search efforts. Sleep comes with the risk of missing out on change dynamics\nand resultant opportunities. Managers need to understand that organizations are partially\npredetermined by a genetic code or a set of routines and procedures, but they can still develop those\nbehavioral patterns through changing their culture. Being specialized through disposition,\norganizations need to be aware of the consequences of a too narrow repertoire of survival strategies\nto create fit.\n20\nAs noted above, managers must follow a process to deal with their hostile environment in\norder to ensure sustainability. They can begin the journey by asking their management teams to\nconsider the following questions in the process:\n1. What are the behavioral patterns and instincts that exist in our business?\n2. Reflecting on the most important hostile episodes of the last few years, how did we react?\n3. Can we conduct an honest cost-benefit analysis of these behavioral patterns?\n4. Will environmental hostility require more than one survival strategy in the future?\n5. How likely will success in the future be determined by reacting in the same way as in the past?\n6. Alternatively, how likely is it that circumstances will demand alternative behavioral patterns?\nSuccessful companies often stumble when they face hostile environments. They falter, in part,\nbecause they assume they can look into the future and develop a long-term strategy that will confer a\nsustainable competitive advantage (Govindarajan & Trimble, 2005). Highly improbable events of\ndramatic consequences (Taleb, 2010) such as the previously mentioned credit crunch brought about\nthe demise of Lehman Brothers and can threaten industries such as investment banking, where even\nGoldman Sachs had to abandon its status as an investment bank. Hostile environments can erode\ncompetitive advantage, wipe out profits and even destroy long established enterprises within\nindustries. Witness the decline and failure of once unflappable companies such as Anglo-Irish Bank,\nAIG, ING, Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Scotland. The future will present business leaders with\nmore hostile environments because of the many different variables in play. Changes in complex\nfinancial instruments, global viruses, terrorism, technological innovation, customers' evolving needs,\ngovernment policy and regulation and changes in the capital markets interact with and overlap one\nanother to create more and more unexpected outcomes with increasingly wide ranging consequences.\n21\nThe animal kingdom, even with some hazards in analogies, can illustrate the results of the\ndestruction of niches (resulting in the extinction of entire species) and loosing capabilities (resulting\nin becoming another animal\u2019s lunch). The animal kingdom also inspires solutions to reestablish or\nmaintain strategic fit \u2013 strategies to cope with hostile environments. Many companies follow similar\napproaches to animals. Their coping strategies win them the trappings of success \u2013 size, cash, time,\nloyalty and position. While it may be difficult to make the necessary changes to develop a new\nanimal instinct, companies are sometimes too slow to effectively adopt even the approaches closest to\ntheir nature or culture. Changing the behavioral routines of companies does not only require having\nthe alertness to tackle this task but also the stamina and rapid action to succeed. Changing culture or\ndeveloping a new capability is difficult, expensive and hard to justify with people who do not foresee\nseveral probable hostile environments nor have the courage to confront them.\nWe contend that future environmental hostility will require managers to be more versatile to\ncreate fit. If this occurs, the success rate and consistency of responses to a single kind of hostility\nwill improve. Furthermore, business leaders can prepare for hard times (Day & Shoemaker, 2008).\nThey can learn from the animal kingdom by observing how animals have, without conscious intent,\nevolved survival strategies. Seeking a better understanding of animal survival instincts can help\nbusiness leaders consider their own organization\u2019s ability to adapt to and survive hostile\nenvironments.\n22\nREFERENCES\nBar-Cohen, Y.
