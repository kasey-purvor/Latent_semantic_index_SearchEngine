INTRODUCTION\nAutoradiography (AR) is a widely used technique in biology\nto map the two dimensional bio-distribution of radiolabelled\nmolecules within thin (\u223c10 \u03bcm) ex-vivo tissue sections. The\naim of this technique is to qualitatively observe the relative\ndistribution of the tracer, or, in many cases, to quantify speci\ufb01c\nareas of uptake (using simultaneous imaging of calibrated\nmicroscales). Traditionally, photographic \ufb01lm has been used as\nthe imaging technology for AR. This exhibits excellent spatial\nresolution (\u223cfew \u03bcm) for low cost (\u223c$3 per sheet for standard\n\ufb01lm and \u223c$50 per sheet for 3H imaging). But this technique\npresents a number of undesirable qualities, particularly with\nrespect to image quanti\ufb01cation. These include poor linearity,\nlimited dynamic range (\u223c102) and low sensitivity, producing\nlong (typically \u223cdays, \u223cmonths) exposure times. Alternative\ntechniques based on digital imaging technology have been pro-\nposed to replace \ufb01lm. Whilst many authors have claimed that\ndigital imaging technologies have superior sensitivity compared\nwith \ufb01lm, we are not aware of any systematic study. In this\nwork we attempt to make a \ufb01rst comparison between \ufb01lm and\ntwo exemplar imaging sensors.\nManuscript received November 17, 2006.\nJ. Cabello and K.

Turchetta are with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, CCLRC,\nChilton, OX11 0QX, UK.\nSome of the more important techniques proposed as al-\nternatives to \ufb01lm in AR include phosphor plates [1], [2],\nmicrochannel plates [3], [4] a Beta Camera [5] based on plate\ntechnology, multiwire proportional chamber systems [6] and\nsolid state detectors [7], [8]. Our work presented here is focused\nin the latter area. Within solid state detectors several different\ntechnologies can be distinguished including CCD technology\n[8], CMOS technology [9] and hybrid detector technology [7].\nIn this work we examine two solid state alternatives to \ufb01lm:\na commercial CCD sensor and a CMOS Monolithic Active\nPixel sensor, both under direct irradiation from a radiola-\nbelled sample. From an engineering perspective, CCD sensor\ntechnology has traditionally provided the \u201dgold standard\u201d in\ndigital image performance in terms of high \ufb01ll factor, quantum\nef\ufb01ciency, small pixel size, dynamic range and low noise \ufb02oor.\nHowever, CMOS imaging technology has made great strides\nin performance, and offers a potentially lower cost alternative\nadditionally providing low power consumption, high level of\nintegration, radiation hardness and high-speed operation.\nThe application of CCD technology for AR under cooled\nconditions has been clearly demonstrated previously [8]. Pre-\nliminary work at room temperature using CCDs under direct\nirradiation has also been reported [10]. In this new work\nwe further examine the potential of these solid state imaging\ntechnologies operating at room temperature.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe most common radioisotopes used in AR are 32P, 33P,\n35S, 14C and 3H, shown in TABLE I.\nTABLE I\nCOMMON RADIOISOTOPES USED IN AR\nRadioisotope Average energy Maximum energy Half life\n32P 0.7 MeV 1.71 MeV 14.3 days\n33P 76 keV 249 keV 25.3 days\n35S 48-53 keV 167 keV 87.4 days\n14C 49 keV 156 keV 5730 years\n3H 5.7 keV 18.6 keV 12.26 years\nTritium, or 3H, in particular, can label many sites on most\nbiomolecules and provides the highest resolution due to its\nlow energy (and hence low particle range, e.g. \u223c0.2 \u03bcm and\n\u223c2.5 \u03bcm for mean and maximum energy betas respectively\nin silicon) and therefore is one of the most common labels in\nmolecular AR imaging studies.\n2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record M11-227\n1-4244-0561-0\/06\/$20.00 \u00a92006 IEEE. 2607\nA. Imaging System Description\nWe have used, in our initial experiments, a CCD55-20\ninverted mode sensor (e2v) [11] and a StarTracker active pixel\nsensor (APS) [9] to detect 14C and 35S. A back-illuminated\nCCD55-20 sensor has also been used to make the \ufb01rst demon-\nstrated 3H imaging at room temperature using a CCD under\ndirect irradiation.\nThe CCD is a 770 x 1152 array of pixels on a 22.5 \u03bcm pitch\nwith a depletion region of 7 \u03bcm and a sensitive \ufb01eld free region\nof 13 \u03bcm. The charge to voltage conversion is 3 \u03bcV\/electron\nas quoted by the manufacturer [11]. The CCD has a 3-phase\nstructure and is read out in full frame slow scan mode at a rate\nof 10 s\/frame using correlated double sampling. The passivation\nlayers, comprised of the electrodes layer and oxide layers, is\n\u223c1.5 \u03bcm.\nThe CMOS StarTracker APS is a 525 x 525 array of pixels on\na 25 \u03bcm pitch with 5 \u03bcm of overlying passivation layers and a\ndepletion region of 4 \u03bcm. Each APS pixel has a structure made\nof 3 transistors (a reset MOSFET, a source follower MOSFET,\nwhich converts signal charge to voltage, and a row-select\nMOSFET) and four n-well\/p-substrate photodiodes placed on a\n12.5 \u03bcm pitch. This architecture optimizes the charge collection\nhaving, at the same time, low node capacitance (\u223c18 fF)\nin order to give better charge to voltage conversion (\u223c8.9\n\u03bcV\/electron). The readout is column-parallel with an adjustable\ngain ampli\ufb01er and a 10-bit ramp ADC per column that reads\nout at near video rates (10 frames s\u22121).\nIn order to correct for dark current and inter-pixel non-\nuniformities, every image acquired on each system is processed\nusing Matlab-based software. For the case of the CCD, \ufb01rst a\npost-acquisition dynamic Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN) correction\nis applied to every image. For the case of the APS, a set of\nblank frames is previously acquired and used to compute the\nmean of each pixel, referred to as a static FPN correction. The\nmean of each blank pixel is subtracted from each observed\npixel intensity in the acquired image. After this \ufb01rst step,\nthe subsequent processing is the same for both sensors. A\nstatistical threshold is then applied to each pixel de\ufb01ned as\nthe mean (in absence of signal) of each pixel plus k standard\ndeviations of each pixel, using prior knowledge of the mean and\nvariance of each pixel acquired under dark level conditions. The\nresulting binary images are then labelled using 8-connectivity\nanalysis and the size and intensity of each event cluster is saved.\nTo obtain a useful composite image the thresholded images,\ndescribed above, were accumulated and summed.\nThe result of this correction is shown in the \ufb01g. 1. Note the\nscale of each image.\nIn the case of the CMOS sensor the images were acquired\nwith an integration time of 100 msecs. A static blank back-\nground was subtracted from each acquired image. Posterior\nthresholding then applied to every corrected image is suf\ufb01cient\nto obtain a largely \u201dclean\u201d composite image. See \ufb01g. 2.\nB. Calibration\nIn order to compare sensor performance it was necessary to\ncalibrate the energy response of both imaging systems, so that\n(a) Raw image (b) Corrected image (c) Thresholded\nimage\nFig. 1. Raw, corrected and thresholded images of the front illuminated CCD\nsensor, showing the stages used to correct for pattern noise.\n(a) Raw image (b) Corrected image (c) Thresholded\nimage\nFig. 2. Raw, corrected and thresholded images of the front illuminated CMOS\nsensor.\na comparative event threshold in calibrated keV units could be\nused. The CCD sensor was exposed to a point source of 241Am\n(activity of 41 kBq) situated around 30 mm from the CCD with\na layer of insulating tape to absorb the associated \u03b1 particles.\nPeaks corresponding to the 241Am photon energies of 11.9\nkeV, 13.9 keV, 17.5 keV, 22 keV and 26 keV were observed.\nExposing the CCD sensor to a 14C source also provided\na reference mean energy of 49 keV from the associated beta\nenergy deposited spectrum. From these data, a \ufb01tted line is\nshown in \ufb01g. 3 with a slope of 0.36 keV\/ADC unit, from which\n1 keV corresponds to 9.72 ADC units. Assuming 3.6 eV is\nrequired to liberate 1 electron in silicon, then this yields a slope\nof 100 electrons\/ADC unit.\nExpressing the threshold applied to the corrected images\nacquired with the CCD sensor in keV, a mean threshold of\n6.7 keV is obtained with an approximately Gaussian variation\nof width \u03c3=1.9 keV. This width represents the variation in\neffective pixel threshold used, due to inter-pixel variations in\nperformance.\nIn the case of the APS sensor, it was not possible to calibrate\nwith a beta or x-ray source because of the thin epi layer of the\nsensor (4 \u03bcm). This therefore calibration was undertaken using\nthe Photon Transfer Technique. Using corresponding values\ntaken from [12] the resulting calibration plot is shown in \ufb01g.\n4.\n2608\n0 50 100 1500\n5000\n10000\n15000\nSignal (ADC units)\nSi\ngn\nal \n(el\nec\ntro\nns\n)\nFig. 3.

Image Acquisition\nPreliminary results obtained using calibrated microscales of\n14C and 3H are presented below. These microscales consist of\nknown amounts of radioactivity homogeneously distributed in\na plastic tissue equivalent polymer of 5-10 \u03bcm thickness. Each\nmicroscale has 8 cells or varying activity; for 3H the range is\n0.11-4.04 kBq\/mg and for 14C is 1.11-31.89 kBq\/g [13]. The\nexperiments were set up placing each sensor in a light proof\nbox and placing the microscale in direct contact with the surface\nof the sensor. The exposure time of the experiments with 14C\nfor the CCD (\ufb01g. 5) and the APS (\ufb01g. 6) was 1 hour and 40\nminutes. For 3H experiments using the CCD, the exposure time\nwas 11 hours with the microscales (\ufb01g. 14), and 16 hours for\nthe tissue specimen with 35S (\ufb01gs. 12 and 13).\nIII. PRELIMINARY RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nA. Sensitivity\nIn \ufb01g. 5 we present a composite image of calibrated 14C\nmicroscales using the CCD sensor. Fig. 6 demonstrates the\ncorresponding image obtained from the APS sensor with 14C,\nrepresenting the \ufb01rst use of this particular APS imaging device\nfor AR. Computing the number of events per band and dividing\nby the activity of each band, the sensitivity for each band\nFig. 5. Composite image with 14C obtained with the CCD sensor after 100\nminutes exposure\nFig. 6. Composite image with 14C obtained with the CMOS sensor after 100\nminutes exposure\nis calculated. The mean of the sensitivity of each band is\n233 counts\/kBq\/g for the CCD and 175 counts\/kBq\/g for the\nAPS (1.33 times lower). Although both images appear visually\nsimilar this demonstrates the lower sensitivity of the CMOS\nsensor which is to be expected due to the higher \ufb01ll factor\nof the CCD technology and the thinner epi layer of this APS\nsensor. This is also shown in \ufb01g. 8 that shows the number of\ndetected events per mm2 in each band. This plot shows that\nthe slope of the CMOS sensor (36.2 counts \/ kBq\/g mm2) is\nlower than that of the CCD sensor (43.3 counts \/ kBq\/g mm2)\nmeaning, again, that the sensitivity of the CCD sensor is higher\nthan that of the APS.\nFrom the ROI analysis described in Section I.A. the density\nof events in the background for the CCD was estimated at\n20 events\/mm2 and for the APS at 9 events\/mm2 (2.22\ntimes lower). This shows us that the APS sensor exhibits lower\nsensitivity but also lower background pixel noise than the CCD.\nFor comparison, we have also exposed a Biomax MR \ufb01lm\nto the same calibrated source for 100 minutes. The resulting\nimage is shown in \ufb01g. 7. Clearly, the level of contrast against\nbackground fogging makes image quanti\ufb01cation impossible at\nsuch a short exposure time.\nFig. 7. Exemplar image produced using 14C microscale after exposure to\nBiomax MR \ufb01lm for 100 minutes.\nROI analysis has been undertaken demonstrating excellent\nlinear response for both sensors. In \ufb01g. 8 we present the number\nof detected events per mm2 for the CCD sensor (squares) and\nthe CMOS sensor (crosses) as a function of source activity.\nB. Energy Spectra\nIn \ufb01g. 9 we show the deposited energy spectrum of 14C\nobtained with the CCD and the APS sensors. These spectra\n2609\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 400\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nActivity (kBq\/g)\nDe\nns\nity\n o\nf e\nve\nnt\ns p\ner\n m\nm2 CCD\nCMOS\nFig. 8.

Deposited energy spectrum of 14C obtained with the CCD (\ufb01g. 9(a))\nand the CMOS (\ufb01g. 9(b)) sensor. Note that in the case of 9(a), below 50 keV\nthe pattern noise correction has dif\ufb01culties in correctly identify genuine events\nfrom the background pattern noise artifacts. 9(b) compared to 9(a) suggests the\nthe CMOS sensor only partially samples the incident energy.\nNote that the spectrum obtained with the CCD is similar to\nthe expected continuous spectrum of 14C, in contrast to that\nexhibited by the CMOS APS sensor. This is attributed to the\nthickness of the epitaxial layer: in the CCD this is 20 \u03bcm\nwhereas in the CMOS sensor, it is 4 \u03bcm. The range of the beta\nparticles from 14C in silicon is 16 \u03bcm for the mean energy and\n121 \u03bcm for the maximum energy. This means that in the thin\nepitaxial layer of the CMOS device, we believe that the sensor\nbehaves as a thin dE\/dx detector, partially sampling the particle\nenergy, compared to the CCD, where there is a relatively high\nchance of observing the full beta energy deposition.\nC. Size of Events\nIn \ufb01g. 10 we show the histograms of different cluster sizes of\nthe detected events from 14C. This was obtained computing the\nhistograms of the size of every event from the arrays mentioned\nin the subsection I.A. This shows that, in both sensors, most of\nthe detected events are 1-2 pixels in size and those events over\n4-5 pixels are not normally detected. Note the CCD, with its\nthicker sensitive region, produces relatively more of the larger\n(>2 pixels) events.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n14000\nSize of clusters (pixels)\nF\nre\nq\nu\ne\nn\ncy\n o\nf \no\ncc\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nce\n(a)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n14000\nSize of clusters (pixels)\nF\nre\nq\nu\ne\nn\ncy\n o\nf \no\ncc\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nce\n(b)\nFig. 10.

Tissue Imaging\nTo examine the imaging system performance under realistic\nconditions various tissue sections were prepared. Several mouse\ntissue sections were preincubated with 1 mM GDP1 and then\nincubated for 2 hours with 35SGTP\u03b3S2 (0.04 nM) and 1 mM\nGDP [14]. These sections shown are from the level of the\nCaudate (Bregma 1.00mm) (\ufb01g. 11 left) and from the level of\nthe Hippocampus (Bregma 2.56 mm) (\ufb01g. 11 right) bonded with\n35SGTP\u03b3S. The physical size of these sections was measured\nas 10.4 mm x 6.8 mm. After this preparation the sections were\nplaced within a \ufb01lm cassette, in direct contact with \ufb01lm, for\n\u223c4 days for 35S.\nTo demonstrate the comparative biological imaging potential\nof CCD and APS technology compared to \ufb01lm, exemplar im-\nages produced using direct irradiation of the same radiolabelled\nbiological mouse samples are presented in \ufb01gs. 11, 12 and 13.\nThis shows a comparison of images taken with \ufb01lm (\ufb01g. 11) for\nfour days (5760 minutes, the usual exposure time used in our\nlaboratory for these studies) and with the CCD (\ufb01g. 12) and\nwith the APS sensor (\ufb01g. 13) exposed for 103 minutes (\u223c6\ntimes shorter). These images were then smoothed with a 3x3\nblock \ufb01lter applied twice.\nFig. 11. Film-based AR images from coronal mouse sections, from the level\nof the Caudate (Bregma 1.00mm) (left) and from the level of the Hippocampus\n(Bregma 2.56 mm) (right), bonded with 35SGTP\u03b3S exposed to \ufb01lm for four\ndays\nE. 3H Imaging\nAs mentioned above, the most common radioisotope in AR\nis 3H. The energy of this isotope is so low that in a front-\nilluminated device, the beta particles would be stopped in the\noverlying passivation layers. Therefore a back-thinned CCD55-\n20 device was substituted for 3H imaging to demonstrate the\n1Guanosine 5\u2019-Diphosphate binding\n2Gamma-thio-triphosphate gamma S binding bonded with 35S\n2610\nFig. 12.

Composite image with 3H obtained with the CCD after 11 hours.\nUndertaking the same ROI analysis as undertaken with 14C,\nin \ufb01gs. 15 and 16 we show the energy spectrum of 3H and\nthe number of events per mm2 of this radioisotope with the\nback-illuminated CCD. From \ufb01g. 14, the sensitivity measured is\n0.56 counts\/kBq\/g and the density of events in the background\nis 64 events\/mm2. From \ufb01g. 16 the slope measured is 0.15\ncounts \/ kBq\/g mm2 which in comparison with that of 14C,\nshows an expected lower sensitivity to 3H beta-particles. The\nhigh number of events in the background is explained by the\nsub-optimized read-out electronics and Fixed Pattern Noise\ncorrection. Using the same calibration procedure as undertaken\nfor the front-illuminated CCD sensor, the back-thinned device\nwas found to use a threshold of 3.46 keV with an inter-pixel\nvariation of 0.3 keV.\nFor comparison with \ufb01lm, in \ufb01g. 17, we present an image\nobtained from digitizing a sheet of tritiated hypersensitive\nhyper\ufb01lm exposed to a 3H microscales for two weeks.\nTo make a comparative assessment against using conven-\ntional \ufb01lm we repeated this experiment for exposure periods of\n100 minutes, one, two and four weeks, and applied a similar\nROI analysis as described previously. To compare the sensitivity\nwe initially exposed a microscale of 3H to a sheet of tritiated\nhypersensitive hyper\ufb01lm for 11 hours, the same length of time\nused with the CCD sensor. The result was a completely blank\n0 5 10 15 20 250\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nSignal (keV)\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny o\nf o\ncc\nur\nre\nnc\ne\nFig. 15.

As can be\nseen in \ufb01g. 18 the resulting data can not be \ufb01tted with a straight\nline. This demonstrates the expected non linear response of \ufb01lm\nimaging compared to that of the digital devices. Note that for\nthe two weeks exposure, the weakest band from the calibrated\nmicroscales is not detected and for the experiment, taken for\none week exposure, the two weakest bands are not detected.\nFig. 17.

CONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated thus far that it is possible to use CCD\nand APS sensors operating at room temperature for AR, reduc-\ning exposure, thus improving sensitivity, and linearity, easing\nimage quanti\ufb01cation, and reducing exposure time compared to\nusing traditional \ufb01lm. We have in addition demonstrated that the\nCMOS APS sensor shows lower sensitivity but it also presents a\nlower background noise \ufb02oor, compared to the slow-scan CCD\ndevice. This makes this technology a serious choice to bare in\nmind for future digital AR.\nWe have also demonstrated that it is possible to detect 3H\nradiation with a backthinned CCD operating at room tempera-\nture.\n2611\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500\u221210\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nActivity (Bq\/mg)\nPi\nxe\nl In\nte\nns\nity\n4 weeks\n2 weeks\n1 week\nFig. 18.
