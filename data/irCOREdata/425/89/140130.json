What are the\ntrends and issues in teaching this subject? These were the sort of the questions which\nprompted an exploratory investigation of operations management (OM) courses\nprovided within the MBA programmes of ten leading European business schools.\nAlthough OM teaching has been the subject of numerous studies in the US,\nlittle has been published on European MBA teaching. This is a significant gap, since\nimportant insights can potentially be gained by comparing the teaching strategies of\ndifferent business schools. As a new member of the teaching faculty at a UK business\nschool, the author attended the 1996 International Teachers Programme (ITP),\norganised by the International Schools of Business Management at London Business\nSchool. A survey of OM teaching was made as a project for ITP and the results\npresented here\u2014a detailed analysis of European core MBA teaching at ten schools\u2014\nwill be useful to all faculty who teach OM, particularly those who are designing or re-\ndesigning courses and subsequently looking for ideas.\nThe goals of the research project were defined in preliminary discussions with\nsix faculty at three different schools, who were asked which aspects of OM teaching at\nother schools would they most interested in learning about. They expressed strong\ninterest in the research and the following research questions:\n1) How is OM taught on full-time MBA courses at ten European business schools?\nWhat approaches are there to:\ni) course content?\nii) teaching methods?\niii) assessment methods?\niv) integration of OM with other subjects?\n32) What are the views of OM faculty on the key challenges they will face in the future\nin teaching the subject?\nTEACHING OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT\nAlthough the focus of this paper is MBA teaching, the substantial body of literature on\nOM teaching\u2014including undergraduate, postgraduate and executive teaching\u2014was\nreviewed, in order to obtain a comprehensive picture. Many of the papers on teaching\noriginate from the US where the subject is normally referred to as production and\noperations management (POM). In this paper both terms\u2014OM and POM\u2014will be\nused, with the latter being used to indicate US courses. The relevant topics in the\nliterature will be presented in categories which closely match the focus of the first\nresearch question.\n\uf0b7 Course content\n\uf0b7 Teaching methods\n\uf0b7 Assessments\n\uf0b7 Integration with other subjects\n\uf0b7 Perceptions of OM\nCourse Content\nThe choice of course content is generally acknowledged in the literature as key to\nachieving the aims of OM teaching. Apparently, however, there is little consensus on\nthe content of operations management courses in the US.\nA 1989 survey of 431 teachers at US business schools showed a wide diversity\nin the content of their POM undergraduate courses (Raizadeh and Ettkin, 1989). This\nwide variation in content between schools was viewed negatively by the researchers\n4who stated \u201calthough there are advantages to diversity, too much of it in an academic\ndiscipline can lead to a lack of focus and potential for confusion\u201d (ibid). Investigating\noperations management teaching on MBA courses, Bahl surveyed 31 US business\nschools and found: \u201cthere seems to be considerable disagreement as to what should be\ntaught in a POM option\u201d (Bahl, 1989).\nSeveral descriptions of US core MBA courses were presented at a US\nconference [see for instance (Donohue, 1996), (Bowen, 1996) and (Chand, 1996)] and\nthese also showed some differences in content. However, since information on\nEuropean OM courses has not been published, no evidence exists that the variations in\ncourse content that have been identified in the US are found in Europe. In a study of\nEuropean MBA core course teaching, course content obviously needs to be thoroughly\ninvestigated as the only published information on European teaching is a description\nof an undergraduate course and an MBA elective (Armistead et al, 1986).\nThe differences in course content in the US appear to be the result of three\nmain factors:\n\uf0b7 In the past OM courses have normally presented tools and techniques. However,\nthere is also a need for a the strategic aspects of OM to be taught and so there is a\ntension between covering techniques in detail and focusing on operations strategy.\n\uf0b7 Operations management evolved from studies of the manufacturing sector but, due\nto the shift in many economies towards service, there is a need to cover service\noperations in OM courses. Faculty must strike the right balance between service\nand manufacturing operations.\n\uf0b7 There are new areas of OM, such as international manufacturing operations, which\npotentially need to be covered in core courses. These newer topics compete for\ntime with the more traditional areas of OM.\n5Tools or Strategy?\nTraditionally, OM courses have been based around a number of tools and techniques\n(Adler, 1989) (Hill, 1996), and this means that OM has been taught differently to the\nway it is practised in successful organisations (Davies, 1996). Consequently, there is a\nneed for the strategic importance of the subject to be underlined by the inclusion of\noperations strategy in teaching courses (Adler, 1989)(Bahl, 1989).\nBergman and Flores (1991) argue strongly that strategic aspects of OM need to\nbe more highly emphasised, rather than techniques. It has also been argued that\nteaching which is based on too many, often unrelated, tools and techniques is an\nineffective way to convey \u201cthe excitement, magnitude and complexity\u201d of operations\nmanagement (Hill, 1987). Consequently, appropriate teaching materials are required\nwhich cover strategic issues effectively. It is important that students understand that\noperations strategy should be the driver which leads to the adoption of appropriate\ntools and techniques and not vice versa\u2014operations strategy must therefore be at the\ncentre of OM teaching (Wood and Britney, 1988). Since teaching more operations\nstrategy will take time away from the tools and techniques, the question arises: what is\nright balance between strategy and techniques? In answer to this, one author has\nrecommended that 40% of postgraduate sessions should be allocated to strategy (Hill,\n1996).\nSupport for the argument that strategic issues should be covered in OM\ncourses also comes from practitioners. Since practitioners have day-to-day experience\nof the issues in OM, their views on teaching \u201cshould be given some merit and\nconsideration in structuring the introductory POM course\u201d (Berry, 1979). Survey\nresults (ibid) showed that 181 operations managers in US companies thought POM\n6concepts and strategy were more important than too much detail on techniques.\nSimilarly Levenburg (1996) found that practising managers thought the emphasis of\nPOM courses should be concepts, as opposed to tools and techniques.\nFrom the literature it is clear that the right balance between strategic issues and\ntools and techniques needs to be achieved.\nService or Manufacturing?\nIt is important to cover service operations in OM teaching (Wood and Britney, 1988).\nHowever, undergraduate POM courses in the US were found to place too little\nemphasis on service operations (Raizadeh and Ettkin, 1989). In contrast, Bahl\u2019s 1989\nstudy of 31 US MBA courses showed that \u201cboth manufacturing and service sector\napplications are now covered in most POM courses\u201d, although the level of detail on\nservice issues varied. For instance, most schools taught manufacturing planning and\ncontrol but did not cover teach how planning and control is managed in the service\nsector. Rather than separating manufacturing and service, it has been argued that a\nbetter approach is to fully integrate service and manufacturing topics throughout OM\ncourses (Bregman and Flores, 1991).\nThere is also pressure from students for service to be comprehensively\naddressed in core programmes (Armistead et al, 1986). Appropriate materials (e.g.\nservice case studies) should be used to show \u201cthat all operations management\ntechniques and approaches can be applied in the service environment\u201d (ibid). It has\nalso been claimed that covering service operations management gives students a better\nunderstanding of OM (Killeya and Armistead, 1983).\nFrom the extant literature, it is clear that the right mix of manufacturing and\nservice operation-based material needs to be used.\n7Which OM Topics?\nThere is much scope to include new topics within OM courses, as the subject is broad\n(Berry, 1979). It is also a rapidly changing subject [(Bergman and Flores, 1991)(Hill,\n1996)], and so there is a need to generate relevant, up-to-date material for teaching\nwhich reflects that the practice of OM is moving away from simple, serial application\nof techniques towards the implementation of complex, parallel solutions (Wood and\nBritney, 1988).\nAreas which could be covered in OM teaching include field service (Hull and\nCox, 1994) and international manufacturing, a current \u201chot topic\u201d (Klassen and\nWhybank, 1994). In addition, as in practice OM involves a lot of human resource\nmanagement, this broader dimension needs to be reflected in teaching (Dreyfus,\n1996). However, the adoption of new areas into OM teaching may not be fast enough.\nA survey of 20 leading schools in the US found that the introduction of new topics\nsuch as Total Quality Management was slow (Kaplan, 1991). It is essential that the\nresults of research into current OM practices are fed back quickly and effectively into\nteaching (Hill, 1987). In contrast, other authors have warned that the scope of OM\ncourses can be made too wide, bringing with it a danger that courses become\nunfocused (Bregman and Flores, 1991).\nThe right balance needs to be struck between including enough new\ninformation to demonstrate the topical issues in OM but not trying to cover too many\ntopics. Focus must be given to allocating time to a limited number of key topics which\nare relevant and stimulating (Bregman and Flores, 1991).\nTeaching Methods\n8A wide range of methods can be used to teach OM including: lectures and case\nstudies; videos; factory visits; practitioners as guest speakers; field projects; and\ngames and simulations. Despite the range of approaches available, a survey of US\nundergraduate teaching found \u201cthe methodologies used to teach the basic POM course\nhave remained very traditional\u2014the lecture approach\u201d (Raizadeh and Ettkin, 1989).\nUnfortunately Bahl\u2019s study of US MBA teaching (Bahl, 1989) did not investigate\nteaching methods. Consequently, there is only limited evidence on how the different\nmethods are typically used for MBA teaching.\nSeveral authors have pointed to the advantages of particular methods in OM\nteaching. For example, videos of factories or service operations are an ideal way of\nbringing realism into the classroom (Nicholson, 1996a). Even popular film clips can\nbe used to illustrate operations management concepts\u2014for instance Charlie Chaplin\u2019s\nModern Times includes a sequence which illustrates balancing a production line\n(Schvaneveldt, 1996). Another approach, visits to factories or service operations can\nprovide a useful learning experiences for students (Raizadeh and Ettkin, 1989),\nparticularly if an assignment is based on the visit (Helms, 1989). Guest speakers can\nbring the \u201creal world\u201d into the classroom and are another way of increasing students\u2019\ninterest in OM (Desai and Inman, 1994). Short field projects are a very effective way\nof teaching service operations (Armistead and Voss, 1986). Similarly, games and\nsimulations are very useful approaches.\nOperations management lends itself to the use of games and simulations which\ncan bring clarity, realism and fun into the classroom. A number of games and\nsimulations have been developed over the years, some of which require the use of\ncomputers whereas others are paper-based.\n9Morgan (1989) discusses the use of a simulation of a manufacturing plant\nwhere small groups of students make operations decisions based on, for example,\nfactory layout and product mix. The advantage of this approach is \u201cstudents are better\nable to understand the impact of POM on the other parts of the organisation (and vice-\nversa) and to view POM techniques in their relation to each other rather than as a set\nof unrelated technical tools\u201d. Another example of a paper-based game is an \u201cIn-tray\nExercise\u201d where, adopting the role of a newly appointed manufacturing manager,\nstudents must assess the performance data and mail in their in-tray. Class discussions\nhelp students to realise the broad array of issues that are typically faced by a\nmanufacturing manager, including shipment targets, plant layout and statistical\nprocess control [(Sohal and Oakland, 1990)(Oakland et al, 1986)]. A number of other\ngames and simulations can be identified in the literature [see, for instance,\n(Levenburg, 1996), (Pariseau, 1996) and (Julien, 1996)]. Excellent descriptions of\nover twenty paper-based games are given by Heineke and Meile (1995).\nComputer simulations can be used to effectively demonstrate many aspects of\nOM. For example, an early simulation showed the relationship of OM to other\nfunctional areas (Harms and Huff, 1981). Smith developed a computer simulation for\ndemonstrating issues of plant layout and operations planning and control and\nconcluded \u201csimulation remains a powerful tool for the teacher of operations\nmanagement\u201d (Smith, 1990). A wide range of OM topics can be taught using\nsimulations but one author warns of the difficulties of producing good computer\nsimulations stating, \u201cthe operations management teacher must be clear about teaching\nand learning objectives before designing a microcomputer-based simulation\u201d (Batley,\n1991).\n10\nIn addition to recognising the advantages of individual teaching methods,\nDesai and Inman (1994) identify the value of using several methods on one course.\nThey recommend that in addition to case studies, plant tours and guest speakers are\nnecessary to create a more stimulating course. However, it appears that no previous\ninvestigations have looked at the balance of methods employed in teaching on MBA\ncore courses.\nAssessments\nThere are two main types of assessments: assessments of the quality of courses and\nOM faculty (usually surveys of students\u2019 views); and assessments of students\u2019\nperformance on OM courses. Interestingly, only the former topic has been discussed in\nthe literature.\nMost schools survey their students\u2019 views on individual courses and use the\nresults to decide how to make improvements. Normally details are not published but\nthere are a number of exceptions. An alumni survey (Haugen, 1996) showed the need\nfor more case studies, group and computer work on a core POM course. The perceived\nbenefits of studying POM were studied at another institution using a sample of five\nacademic classes, including under- and postgraduates (Ala, 1987). The perceived\nbenefits included: an exposure to manufacturing technologies (such as automation); an\nunderstanding of the terminology and; the development of skills necessary to become\na general manager.\nIn a comprehensive study of 366 students, the ratings achieved by POM faculty\nwere investigated. This research identified the problem of surveying students\u2019\nopinions as a monitor of the effectiveness of OM teachers. \u201cRatings do not reflect an\ninstructor\u2019s ability to help students learn and are not valid measuring devices in terms\n11\nof faculty ability to enhance performance\u201d (Biggs et al, 1991). A better method is\nrequired to identify and measure the links between cause (the teacher\u2019s ability) and\neffect (students\u2019 learning), although this will be difficult to test empirically.\nHow are students typically assessed on MBA courses? This question remains\nopen, as apparently it has not been addressed in previous surveys.\nIntegration of OM\nIn the OM literature the issue of integration is hardly mentioned and only two\nreferences were found to this topic. Klassen and Whybank (1994) stated that teaching\ninternational operations management needed a cross-disciplinary approach with team\nteaching. Gunawardane (1991) recognised that a better understanding was required of\nhow OM could be integrated with other functional area courses effectively.\nPerceptions of OM Teaching\nAn important topic, judging by the number of times it is discussed in the literature, is\nthe perception of OM courses and claim that OM is not as highly regarded as it should\nbe.\nSeveral pieces of research have investigated both students\u2019 and practitioners\u2019\nperceptions of OM teaching. A survey of under- and postgraduates at a US school\nexamined whether they were biased against POM courses and manufacturing in\ngeneral (Desai and Inman, 1994). Although the survey was only conducted at one\nschool, the results are nonetheless revealing as student bias against POM was\nconfirmed. Bias resulted from the low image of the subject as it was seen to be linked\nto manufacturing, and therefore removed from the \u201creal action\u201d. Additionally careers\nin operations were seen as less attractive (ibid). The authors of the study opine that\n12\nbusiness schools place too little emphasis on POM; to rectify this the professional\nimage of the subject needs to be raised by making it more interesting and applicable\n(ibid). Ala (1987) also claims to have detected student bias against POM but his\nconclusion can be called into question because of the ambiguity of one of his\nquestions. Students were asked \u201cWhat is your reason for taking this course?\u201d Because\nthe course was compulsory, most students responded indicating they took the course\n(only) because they had to. In this case the answers cannot necessarily be taken as an\nindication of bias, students were possibly responding in a factual manner and not\nshowing bias against the subject.\nSeveral authors conclude from their investigations of OM teaching that the\nperception of the subject is not as good as it should be. Adler (1989) thinks that more\nrealism and less quantitative methods are needed to improve the image of OM\nteaching, Ala (1987) believes that OM needs to be promoted more strongly to faculty\nfrom other disciplines. Gunawardane (1991) concludes that OM faculty must\nthemselves clearly recognise that OM concepts are not only applicable to production\nand service operations, if they are going to raise the perception of the subject by\ndemonstrating its wide applicability.\nSummary\nSeveral key themes emerge from the literature which are relevant to the current\ninvestigation of MBA teaching at European business schools. These are:\n\uf0b7 Course content. A wide variation exists in the topics covered on POM courses in\nthe US. As no European data has been published, investigation is needed to\nestablish whether this is also the case in Europe. In deciding OM course content,\nthe right balance needs to be chosen between strategic and tactical (tools and\n13\ntechniques) issues; manufacturing and service operations; and new and traditional\nmaterial. In other words: \u201can essential task facing OM faculty is to rethink the mix\nand emphasis of what is taught in core courses\u201d (Hill, 1996).\n\uf0b7 Teaching methods. A wide variety of teaching methods can be employed for OM\nteaching. Previous investigations of teaching have focused mainly on content and\nhave not investigated the mix of teaching methods adopted.\n\uf0b7 Assessment. Both students\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 assessments of OM courses have\nbeen used as inputs to the course design process. However, the other aspect of\nassessments\u2014how students\u2019 performance is assessed\u2014has been ignored in the\nliterature.\n\uf0b7 Integration. Almost nothing has been written on how and why OM should be\nintegrated with other subjects, as part of a MBA programme.\n\uf0b7 Perceptions. There is some controversy about OM teaching; it needs to cover more\nthan just a collection of tools and techniques. Additionally, it needs to raise the\nperception of the subject\u2014by making it interesting, relevant and of recognised\nstrategic importance.\nRESEARCH METHOD\nThe aim of the research was to make an exploratory investigation of how OM is\ntaught at ten European business schools. To achieve this the following methodology\nwas adopted:\n1) The members of faculty responsible for teaching OM at the schools in the sample\nwere identified by telephoning each school.\n2) In May 1996 respondents were personally sent a request by post for an outline of\ntheir OM core course. The letter explained the aims of the project and that it was\n14\nbeing conducted as a project as part of the International Teachers Programme (this\nwas an important factor in gaining the support of respondents). The letter also\npromised respondents a copy of the results.\n3) Follow-up telephone calls were made two weeks later to \u201cremind\u201d respondents to\nsend details of their courses, to further explain the project and to set a mutually\nconvenient date for a telephone interview. These calls established that there was a\nhigh level of interest in the survey.\n4) The outlines of OM courses from each school were collated and comparison tables\nprepared. These tables identified where data were not included in the course\noutlines from particular schools and therefore which needed to be collected during\nthe telephone interviews. The comparison tables also helped generate ideas for\ngeneral questions for the telephone survey.\n5) A questionnaire for the telephone interviews was prepared to collect details of the\nrespondents\u2019 OM courses.\n6) Telephone interviews were conducted in June-September 1996. Each interview\nlasted 30 minutes or more and produced substantial data on both respondents\u2019 OM\ncourses and their views on teaching.\n7) A preliminary report on the findings was sent to respondents in September 1996, to\nenable them to check the data on their school and to obtain their agreement to\npublish the results.\nQuestionnaire Development\nIn order to keep the telephone interviews to an acceptable length, it was clear that they\nneeded to focus on key areas only. To establish these, informal discussions were held\nwith six OM faculty from three schools. They were asked which aspects of OM\n15\nteaching at other schools would be of most interest to them and the consensus of their\nviews was strong interest in five areas:\n\uf0b7 course content\n\uf0b7 teaching methods\n\uf0b7 assessment methods\n\uf0b7 integration of OM\n\uf0b7 faculty\u2019s views on challenges in OM teaching.\nA standard questionnaire was developed to cover the above points and this is\ngiven in Appendix A. As respondents\u2019 course outlines had been obtained in advance\nof the interviews, separate customised versions of the questionnaire were prepared for\neach interview. These customised questionnaires were annotated with answers that\nwere already known from course outlines (and these were then checked with\nrespondents during the interviews). In addition, it was noted on the customised\nquestionnaires where particular information was required which was not included in\nthe course outline.\nThe approach used in this research was significantly different to the previous\ninvestigations based on postal questionnaires [e.g. (Bahl, 1989),(Raizadeh, 1989)]. As\nthe course outline was obtained in advance, this enabled the researcher to have an\nunderstanding of the interviewee\u2019s course before the telephone interviews were made.\nDetails of courses were then reviewed with a faculty member during the telephone\ninterviews. This created a rich data set (which included the case studies used, the time\nallocated to the topic, course reading, etc., etc.) and enabled, for example, the\nindividual sessions on each of the courses to be accurately categorised by their\ncontent, even though the sessions in the various courses might have had different\ntitles.\n16\nSample\nThe sample was chosen from the Association of MBAs Guide to Business Schools\n1995\/96 listing of recognised schools (Assoc. MBAs, 1995). The choice of schools\nwas not random; instead, a purposive sample was selected according to two criteria.\nFirstly, rather than selecting a large number of UK schools (34 from the 47 in the\nAMBA list are UK schools), a number of schools in continental Europe were chosen.\nSecondly, schools were chosen which are \u201cparticularly well-known\u201d and which\nreceive high ratings for their MBA courses in the popular press [see for example\n(Bickerstaffe, 1996)].\nIn order to help establish a basis for discussions and comparison, the OM\ncourse at the author\u2019s own school was included in the survey. To achieve a\ncomparison of ten schools in total and allow for possible non-response, it was decided\nto contact a further twelve schools. In the event, this caution proved appropriate as\ntwo schools are currently re-designing their core courses and, as a consequence,\ndeclined to share information about unfinished and untried designs. In addition,\nalthough a faculty member had agreed to participate, one school failed to send details\nof their course, despite numerous reminders. The ten schools that participated in the\nsurvey are identified in the following section. (As a direct result of contacts made\nduring the survey, the author has subsequently had the opportunity to teach at SDA\nBocconi and so has first-hand knowledge of two of the OM courses described).\nRESULTS\nTable I shows an overview of the OM courses at the ten schools. The first thing to\nnote is that the duration and structure of the MBA courses themselves vary\u2014most are\n17\none year courses but SDA Bocconi and London Business School (LBS) are longer; 16\nand 21 months respectively. The second thing to note is that only eight schools have a\nOM core course as such. Ashridge\u2019s MBA is based on a modular structure (rather than\ncore and elective subjects) but the OM course is compulsory. At Lancaster the\nintroductory OM course is not compulsory, although it is chosen by approximately\n50% of students.\nInsert Table I\nThe time allocated to courses varies enormously, from 18 hours (Groupe ESC\nLyon) to 76 hours (Bocconi). Partly, this can the accounted for by the different length\nof the MBA courses at these schools (12 and 16 months respectively). However, the\nmain explanation provided by respondents is that Groupe ESC Lyon has a background\nof commerce and consequently operations has not traditionally been a main focus of\nthe MBA. Bocconi, on the other hand, has strong contacts with the manufacturing\nsector and consequently allocates more time to operations. Another possible\nexplanation for the differences in the length of courses is that certain topics are\ncovered by certain schools in electives. However, this is not the main reason for the\ndifferences in the length of courses as the range of electives offered by schools is\nbroadly similar (including for example manufacturing strategy, planning and control,\netc.) and even the schools offering longer core course also offer further electives.\nTherefore, time allocated by different schools to teaching the OM core course does\nvary significantly. The average time allocated is 34 hours; the average across one year\nMBA courses only is 29 hours.\n18\nCourse Content\nThe course objectives from each schools are given in Table I and these are generally\nsimilar; European teaching aims to show the importance operations can play in\nbusiness performance and to cover some of the key concepts, tools and techniques.\nThe choice of content to achieve these aims was investigated further.\nTools or Strategy?\nThe review of the literature demonstrated the need for faculty to strike the right\nbalance between strategic and tactical issues in their teaching of OM. However, it is\ndifficult to identify the correct emphasis which should be placed on strategic issues, as\nthe results show a wide range of variation. From Table I it can be seen that the\nemphasis on strategic issues may be only 15%, or as high as 50%.\nHow much strategy should be covered in an OM course? There is some\ncontroversy on this. Several respondents commented on the difficulty of choosing the\nright balance. One stated that it is difficult \u201ctrying to balance the strategic and the\nquantitative\u201d. Another indicated that caution is advised when increasing the amount of\nstrategy in a course, saying \u201cthe big debate for us on the core programme is how much\nmore strategy to introduce. I see a danger if all the tools and techniques are abandoned\n... [the core course needs] a rich mixture of both strategic discussions and tools and\ntechniques\u201d. However, another respondent (with already a high percentage of strategy\nin their course) commented \u201cI think we might even teach more strategy in the future\u201d.\nAlthough it is not necessarily an indication of the ideal mix, the average across the\ncourses in the sample was a mix of 30% strategic issues and 70% tactical tools and\ntechniques.\n19\nService or Manufacturing?\nTable I shows that more emphasis is placed of manufacturing as opposed to service\noperations in many courses\u2014on average 66.5% of course content focuses on\nmanufacturing (with a range from 50 to 90%). For instance, Bocconi, with its strong\nlinks to manufacturing focuses 90% of the time on production (but is introducing\nmore focus on service), whereas LBS has an approximately equal mix of service and\nmanufacturing. Ashridge aim to cover all operations management concepts in a\n\u201cgeneric\u201d way, explaining them with examples of how they apply in both\nmanufacturing and service situations [similar to the recommendation of Bregman and\nFlores (1991).\nIn contrast to the discussions on the difficulty of choosing the right balance\nbetween strategic and tactical issues, faculty were much clearer about the right balance\nbetween manufacturing and service. Almost all faculty said they wanted to place a\nhigher emphasis on service operations in the future. In most cases they stated the need\nfor equal emphasis, in terms of examples, cases used, time allocated, etc. Several\nrespondents said that their present courses were \u201cstill too manufacturing based\u201d and\none of the reasons mentioned for this was the shortage of case studies based on service\noperations which illustrate concepts effectively.\nWhich OM Topics?\nA check was made on the level of variation between the topics taught at different\nschools and Table II shows the results. Across all OM courses, 14 major topics were\nidentified, such as the Role of OM, Total Quality Management, Operations Strategy,\netc. Table II also shows the number of schools that teach each topic and it can be seen\nthat there is relatively close agreement between the courses. The first seven topics are\n20\ntaught by at least 70% of the ten schools surveyed. This contrasts strongly with the\nUS, where there is much variation in the topics taught (Bahl, 1989). Every European\nschool includes the Role of OM and Total Quality Management in its OM course. The\ntopics Analysing Operations, Inventory Management and Supply Chain Management\nare taught at eight schools. Surprisingly, considering the discussion in the literature\nabout raising the perceived importance of OM as a strategically key subject, not every\nschool has a separate session focusing on OM strategy\u2014only seven do\u2014although the\nother schools say they raise strategic aspects in many sessions.\nInsert Table II\nSome topics are only taught at a few schools. For instance, new product\ndevelopment is only taught on three courses, whilst at other schools, it is often\ncovered in an elective. Only two schools cover the international aspects of operations\nin separate sessions. Time-based competition is taught in separate sessions at two\nschools, although (arguably) it is a form of Business Process Re-Engineering, which is\ncovered on the OM course at four other schools. Project management techniques are\ndiscussed at two schools; in most other schools it is a separate course. Only two\nschools have a separate session on the cost elements of OM.\nThe textbook used will have an influence on course content. Six schools use\neither a single or two recommended textbooks (four schools use Slack et al, 1995).\nFour schools have decided not to recommend textbooks and instead use readings from\nseveral books or journal articles (Harvard Business Review articles are commonly\nused). In order to promote more interest in OM from students with no manufacturing\nexperience, four schools (Ashridge, EAP, INSEAD and Cranfield) recommend that\n21\nstudents read Goldratt and Cox\u2019s novel The Goal, in advance of the course. This book\ntells the story of a manufacturing manager\u2019s struggle to improve his plant\u2019s\nperformance and gives a good understanding of manufacturing problems and\npractices. Appendix 1 gives full details of the textbooks used in courses.\nTeaching Methods\nA mix of teaching methods are used on all courses. Every schools uses lectures, case\nstudies and videos in their teaching and, in addition, there is heavy usage of guest\nspeakers, factory visits and games and simulations. Table III summarises the teaching\nmethods used by the ten business schools.\nFrom Table III it can be seen that case studies are used for between 50% and\n88% of teaching sessions on OM courses. Four schools use comparatively few cases\u2014\nin 50% of sessions\u2014(Ashridge, Bocconi, EAP, and Groupe ESC Lyon). For instance,\nBocconi uses case studies in 19 out of 38 sessions i.e. for approximately 50% of the\nteaching time available. In contrast, IMD make the heaviest use of case studies; in 15\nout of 17 sessions (approximately 88% of sessions), whereas the average usage of\ncases is in 64% of sessions.\nThe way in which cases are used was investigated and found to be similar\nacross the schools in the sample. Case studies were seen by OM faculty to be\nparticularly important for two reasons:\n\uf0b7 Firstly, faculty thought that for an applied subject like OM, tools and concepts can\nonly be effectively demonstrated within the context of an actual business situation.\n\uf0b7 Secondly, the problems faced by operations managers today are complex and so the\napproaches to solve them, in order to be effective, often involve the use of several\nconcepts or tools in parallel. Students can only start to understand that real\n22\noperations problems are this complex if they have discussed a sufficient number of\nsuitable cases.\nCases are typically used in combination with presentations (on the concepts), plenary\ndiscussions and, sometimes students themselves are required to present their\nconclusions on a case. The cases used in core courses come from a range of sources\nand \u201ccase studies are selected that reinforce a particular concept\u201d. There is a heavy\nreliance on Harvard Business School cases at some schools but every school uses at\nleast one case study which they have developed themselves. IMD, LBS and Warwick\nall of whom have published a large number of cases, use much of their own material.\nCases from IMD, LBS and Warwick are also used at a number of the other schools in\nthe sample.\nVideos are used to varying degrees by every school, as shown in Table III.\nThey are used to give students, who often have no experience of manufacturing\noperations, an idea of the technologies and production layouts. In addition, although\nstudents have generally more experience of service operations, faculty say videos are\nuseful to demonstrate in detail how service operations are organised (including back\noffice functions). Several faculty commented that they had difficulty finding enough,\nup-to-date videos which effectively demonstrate operations issues. To get around this\nproblem, London Business School have obtained access to a number of companies\nand produced their own videos for teaching purposes. These show manufacturing or\nservice operations, including the technologies involved, and include interviews with\noperations managers, discussing particular problems or issues. Consequently these\nvideos are used in class as short case studies.\nNine schools use games or simulations to demonstrate operations management\ntechniques, rather than just explaining them. Games and simulations are most\n23\ncommonly used for demonstrating inventory control and Just-in-Time techniques.\nSome of the games used have been published, such as the \u201cSampson Tiles Game\u201d on\nforecasting used by Bocconi and Cranfield (Leenders, 1973) and LBS\u2019s \u201cDiscovery\nElectronics\u201d (Nicholson, 1996b). Several schools use simple games that they\ndeveloped themselves but have not published; for instance EAP Paris have a Just-in-\nTime game. One respondent thought that games and simulations would be used more\noften in the future, as there is \u201ca move towards action-oriented learning activities and\naway from lectures\u201d at his school. However, another respondent said that games and\nsimulations were only effective for demonstrating tools \u201cand tactical issues\u201d and so\nthought that their use on MBA core courses had to be limited, if sufficient time was to\nbe allocated to strategic issues.\nMost respondents reported that many of their students do not have\nmanufacturing experience. Although videos were felt by faculty to be useful in\ndemonstrating the operations environment, most of them still believed that actual\nvisits were necessary to give students a real \u201cfeel for the environment\u201d. Consequently,\neight schools organise at least one factory visit. Faculty at these schools were all very\npositive about the advantages of this approach\u2014visits were viewed to be effective at\nboth demonstrating operations and motivating students\u2019 interest in OM. Warwick\nhave particularly focused on visits and offer students the chance to visit about a dozen\nfactories (one visit is compulsory). Three schools use guest speakers to add a \u201cfirst-\nhand, up to date\u201d view of OM (many of the other schools use the factory visit for this\npurpose).\nInsert Table III\n24\nOne innovative approach to teaching\u2014only used by IMD\u2014is to formally have\nstudents with an OM background present operations concepts and discuss their own\nexperiences at suitable points in the course. This requires significant preparation, with\nthe teacher reviewing students\u2019 c.v.s to determine which student(s) can best contribute\non which topic(s). IMD were positive about the results stating, \u201cin fact, the\ncomparison of experiences of different participants about the same issues is the richest\nlearning environmental in operations\u201d (excerpt from the IMD course outline).\nAlthough a number of other schools including Groupe ESC Lyon do encourage\nstudents to share their experience of managing operations, only IMD emphasise it to\nthe extent that it can account for 40% of students\u2019 marks.\nAssessments\nHow are students on OM courses assessed? In total, the following four different\napproaches were identified across the schools in the sample:\n\uf0b7 Examinations\n\uf0b7 Written case assessments\n\uf0b7 Project work\n\uf0b7 Class participation\nTable I gives details of the assessment methods used at each school and it can be seen\nthat every school uses a combination of at least two different types of assessment. In\nterms of the marks allocated, examinations are the most important method. They are\nused at every school and, on average 58% of the total OM marks are allocated to\nexaminations (with a range 30 to 80%). Most examinations are based on short case\nproblems. Written assignments also account for a significant amount of the marks on\nmost courses. The types of assignment include case assessments (performed as either\n25\nindividual or group work); short projects, such as analysing an operation and making\nrecommendations for improvements (used by Warwick, LBS and Cranfield); and\napplying techniques and concepts to the participant\u2019s own organisation (Ashridge).\nClass participation is assessed at only three schools (Bocconi, IMD and INSEAD)\nwith the range of marks allocated to this varying from 10 to 70% of marks. Another\nassessment method is to have participants with an operations background present their\nexperiences (used by IMD, as explained earlier).\nSeveral OM faculty (respondents) mentioned that they consider it difficult to\nrealistically assess students\u2019 performance in OM, as it is such an applied subject. For\nthis reason one respondent was considering giving a higher emphasis to assessment\nbased on project work and stated \u201cexaminations are not terribly satisfactory. Projects\non, for instance, auditing an operation, give a better measure of students\u2019\nperformance\u201d.\nIntegration with Other Subjects\nBusiness schools need to \u201cbreak down the barriers between academic disciplines that\nprevent many MBA graduates from understanding say, the link between\nmanufacturing and marketing\u201d (Anon, 1992). One school\u2019s core course outline even\nstates \u201ca crucial aspect of this subject is the integration with other disciplines,\nparticularly marketing, IT, HRM and Business Policy\u201d. However, integration is\ndifficult and one respondent commenting on it said, \u201cThat\u2019s difficult, we don\u2019t do it\nvery well to be honest. With a very international faculty flying in and out, it is\nsomewhat random but we do try and talk [across the disciplines]\u201d. Another respondent\ncommented on integration in his school stating that it was; \u201cnot very well done\n26\nalthough, for instance, we know what marketing are doing in parallel. We will be\nworking on more cross-functional approaches\u201d.\nSome schools try to solve the integration problem in an informal way. For\ninstance by having students give short presentations about experiences which raise\nrelevant cross-functional issues, or OM teachers discussing points from other\ndisciplines in their sessions: \u201cI address related subjects like marketing and finance [in\nthe OM core course]\u201d. At other schools, more formal solutions to the issue of\nintegration come from the MBA course structure itself. For instance:\n\uf0b7 One school already uses a significant amount of cross-functional team-teaching\u2014\nin addition to the core OM course where cases are taught from an operations\nperspective, students have approximately 30% more cases where cross-functional\nteam-teaching brings out a range of issues.\n\uf0b7 Another school has an ambitious project to change its curriculum, so that half of\nthe teaching will be fully integrative, with 2-3 teachers co-teaching complex cases.\nSuitable cases are currently being prepared by teams of cross-functional teachers\n(including OM faculty).\n\uf0b7 Several schools have cross-functional electives.\n\uf0b7 Most schools stress that MBA projects should be approached in a cross-functional\nway.\nSeveral of the schools surveyed are currently focusing on integration and it was\nidentified as a key issue by most respondents.\nChallenges in OM Teaching\nThe respondents, all of whom regularly teach core courses, were asked their opinion\non the challenges in OM teaching\u2014and all expressed particular interest in the results\n27\nof this part of the research. The issues raised can be grouped into three broad\ncategories:\n\uf0b7 Difficulties with the scope of the subject itself\n\uf0b7 Concern on how best to demonstrate the importance and relevance of OM\n\uf0b7 The complexity of teaching an applied, constantly changing subject.\nSeveral faculty did not think that operations was a sufficiently well-defined\nsubject and commented, for example, \u201cI still think the biggest challenge is definition; I\nam far from satisfied that we actually know what operations is\u201d or, \u201cthe challenge is to\ndefine our subject from [the current] rat-bag of tools\u201d. Another respondent said it was\na challenge \u201ctrying to give structure to a course consisting of lots of diverse tools and\ntechniques\u201d.\nHow can the wider relevance of OM be demonstrated and students convinced\nof its importance? One respondent was of the opinion that \u201cstudents are increasingly\nconvinced that operations is important, I think the tables are turning in our favour\u201d.\nHowever, most respondents commented on the difficulties of trying to \u201cget people to\nrecognise that OM tools and techniques are useful in many situations\u201d. One stated, \u201cI\nthink the biggest challenge is to grow our subject area and the key is relevance.\nTeaching has to be highly relevant...\u201d and continued to say that, in addition, OM\nteachers must \u201cteach the magic of the area\u201d. Another said \u201cthe biggest challenge is to\nbe in touch with reality and know what it is relevant to teach (to managers who have\ncome from industry and know what is important)\u201d. One respondent noted the problem\nof relevance also existed in executive education saying \u201cexecutives don\u2019t see the key\nimportance of operations\u201d. Several respondents said that the strategic side of OM must\nbe even more strongly emphasised if students are to be convinced of its importance.\n28\nRespondents said their courses required constant revision to include the latest\nideas: \u201cwe think that the challenges are covering supply chain integration; the virtual\norganisation; time-based competition and; out-sourcing but still covering JIT, TQM\nand other topics well\u201d. One respondent said the biggest challenge was \u201ckeeping up\nwith the changes in technology: scurrying around trying to keep up is the biggest\nfrustration, as it takes some much time\u201d.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis research was the first investigation of European OM teaching on MBA courses.\nAlthough the methodology used was comparatively simple, the results are important\nand conclusions can be drawn on two levels. Firstly, direct conclusions can be drawn\nfrom comparing the different courses and their content; secondly, conclusions can be\nreached from the issues raised by respondents and the need for more detailed research\ninto OM teaching issues.\nOn the primary level, the survey results give useful insights in five key areas:\n\uf0b7 Course content. Although there is strong agreement between European schools on\ncourse content, there are significant variations on three dimensions: the time\nallocated to OM; the emphasis placed by OM faculty on strategic or tactical issues;\nand the relative focus on manufacturing or service operations.\nThe time allocated to OM varied widely. From discussions with respondents, it\nappears that 25-30 hours is generally viewed as appropriate for teaching OM on\none-year MBA programmes\u2014in order to achieve the twin goals of showing the\nimportance of operations and covering some of the key tools and techniques. (One\nrespondent even said he will be using the results of the survey to convince his\nschool to allocate more time to OM!)\n29\nThe amount of strategy included in core courses ranged from 15 to 50%. Most\nfaculty thought that it was important to include a significant amount of strategy to\ncapture students\u2019 interest but found it difficult to decide exactly how much was\nrequired. Taking an average across the sample, a 30% focus on strategy, as opposed\nto tools and techniques, is used. However, this figure does not necessarily indicate\nthe correct mix\u2014further research would be required to investigate the complex\nissue of the ideal amount of strategy to be included in the core course.\nSeveral schools still have a stronger focus on manufacturing than on service\noperations. The consensus of the respondents was that parity between service and\nmanufacturing operations is highly desirable in core courses. However, most\nschools have some way to go to achieving this and good material, especially case\nstudies, is scarce.\n\uf0b7 Teaching methods. A wide variety of teaching methods can be employed for OM\nteaching. The survey showed a strong similarity in the teaching methods adopted\nacross schools. It could be concluded that this indicates that all schools are\nadopting the right approach. However, on the other hand, it could be said that there\nis room for more innovation in OM teaching. Indeed, significant innovation may be\nrequired if the key challenges facing OM teachers are to be addressed. For instance,\nsince OM is such an applied subject, maybe some elements of action-based\nlearning are required even on core courses.\n\uf0b7 Assessment. The survey results are the first data on how students are assessed.\nThey indicate that faculty think that a combination of at least two methods are\ndesirable on core courses. Further research would be required to probe the\neffectiveness of the different assessment methods, or their combinations.\n30\n\uf0b7 Integration. Although integration is perceived by faculty to be an important issue,\nthe results show that most schools are only just starting to investigate formal ways\nto approach this problem. OM faculty, as they perceive this issue as important,\nshould take an active role in the moves towards integration at their schools.\n\uf0b7 Perceptions. From respondents\u2019 views, it appears that OM faculty are facing two\nfundamental challenges. These are the need to develop a clearer structure for the\nsubject and to become more effective at demonstrating its wider relevance.\nAlthough the current study only provides anecdotal evidence of these key\nchallenges, these do mirror some of the concerns about OM teaching raised in the\nliterature. Perhaps, OM teachers in general \u201cstill seem to consider POM as the key\nuser of these concepts and skills\u201d (Gunawardane, 1991) and do not focus on\nshowing the wider relevance for the tools and techniques. Certainly the majority of\nOM case studies demonstrate how the tools and techniques can be applied in a\nmanufacturing or a service environment. Therefore, it can be concluded that there\nis a real need for research and good case material which demonstrates how OM\nconcepts are useful to not only operations managers but also managers in all\nfunctional areas.\nTo raise the perceived importance of their subject, OM faculty face a difficult\nchallenge and they must be proactive in looking for ways to do this. Many schools\nare currently revising their MBA programmes and, in particular there is much\ndiscussion on integration. OM teachers must be active in influencing how\nintegration will be achieved and in setting OM at the centre of these programmes. It\nis, in the author\u2019s opinion, an opportunity to be grasped by, for example, OM\nteachers taking a leading role in developing suitable cross-functional cases.\nBecause, if OM continues to be associated with \u2018just manufacturing\u2019 or \u2018just\n31\nmanufacturing and services\u2019, then the perception of the subject will not be\nenhanced.\nThe broadest conclusion on the research is that\u2014as the first investigation of\nOM teaching on MBA courses in Europe\u2014it was long overdue and demonstrates that\ntoo little emphasis has previously been placed on this area. The author hopes that this\npaper will trigger wider discussions on and deeper research into OM teaching. This is\ncertainly necessary because of the fundamental nature of some of the issues raised by\nrespondents\u2014particularly the problems with the definition of OM and its perceived\nrelevance. These are issues which urgently need to be addressed if the standing of\noperations management is to be enhanced through teaching.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author would like to thank the operations management faculty who responded to\nthe survey: Stuart Chambers (Warwick), Carlos Cordon (IMD), Alberto Grando (SDA\nBocconi), Terry Hill (LBS), John Mapes (Cranfield), Nick Middle and Anthony\nMitchell (Ashridge), Mike Pidd (Lancaster), John Smith (EAP Paris), Luk Van\nWassenhove and Enver Yucasan (INSEAD) and Derek Waller (Groupe ESC Lyon).\n32\nAPPENDIX A\nReply Number:______\nTelephone Survey Instrument\nEuropean Operations Management MBA Core Courses\nSection One Details of Institution \/ Respondent\nInstitution...............................
