For some \nyears it has been accepted that microelectrode arrays offer an attractive route for lowering minimum limits \nof detection and imparting stir (convectional mass transport) independence to sensor responses; despite \nthis no commercial biosensors, to date, have employed microelectrode arrays, largely due to the cost of \nconventional fabrication routes that have not proved commercially viable for disposable devices. \nBiosensors formed by our sonochemical approach offer unrivalled sensitivity and impart stir independence \nto sensor responses. This format lends itself for mass fabrication due to the simplicity and inexpensiveness \nof the approach; in the first instance impedimetric and amperometric sensors are reported for glucose as \nmodel systems. Sensors already developed for ethanol, oxalate and a number of pesticide determinations \nwill be reported in subsequent publications.  \n 1\nIntroduction \nBiosensor technology has developed into an ever expanding and multidisciplinary field since the Clark \nenzyme electrode was first reported (Clark and Lyons 1962). Biosensors generically offer simplified \nreagentless analyses for a range of biomedical and industrial applications and for this reason this area has \ncontinued to develop into an ever expanding and multidisciplinary field during the last couple of decades. \nSince more than half of the sensors reported in the literature are based on electrochemical transducers \n(Meadows 1996) and at the time of writing approximately 85% of the world commercial market for \nbiosensors is for blood glucose monitoring (Newman et al 2002), we will as the first model system of this \nsonochemically fabricated microelectrode array biosensor, report a glucose oxidase based impedimetric \nsensor.  We have already within our laboratory demonstrated the fabrication of enzymatic and affinity \nbased sensors that lend themselves to interrogation by either (i) amperometric or (ii) impedimetric \napproaches. Enzymatic sensors have been developed for analytes including ethanol, oxalate and a series of \npesticides. Affinity sensors have been developed using antibody\/antigen and DNA hybridisation based \napproaches. These will all be reported in a series of further publications. \n \nMicroelectrodes offer advantages over conventional larger working electrodes within biosensors since \nthey experience hemispherical solute diffusional profiles, and it is this phenomenon that can impart \nstir-independence to sensor responses, whilst also offering lowered limits of detection. \n \nIndividual microelectrodes offer very small responses and one approach for overcoming this problem is to \nuse many microelectrodes together in the form of an array to allow a cumulative and so larger response to \nbe measured. \n \nMicroelectrode arrays may be fabricated by a number of approaches although techniques such as \nphotolithography or laser ablation have to date proved cost prohibitive for the mass production of \ndisposable sensor strips. We will within this paper describe a novel sonochemical fabrication approach \n 2\n(Higson 1996) for the production of microelectrodes, that lends itself to the mass production of sensor \narrays.. \n 3\nExperimental Section \n \nGlucose oxidase from Asperigillus niger (80% protein, 132,000 units\/g solid), was purchased from the \nSigma Chemical Company (Poole, Dorset, UK), D-glucose, aniline, potassium hydrogen phthalate, \ndisodium hydrogen orthophosphate 1-hydrate, sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate, sodium \nchloride, and diaminobenzene dihydrochloride (all \u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade), were purchased from BDH (Poole, \nDorset, UK). All chemicals were used without further purification. \n \nGlucose oxidase was prepared using 250 units\/ml, in distilled water for deposition at microelectrode \narrays.  \n \nAnhydrous \u03b1-D-glucose solutions were prepared to a range of concentrations, from 1 to 40mM, in pH 7.4 \nphosphate buffer. \n \nA small volume, 2.7 ml, PTFE cell was milled for the co-deposition of aniline\/enzyme. The cell held the \nglass slide working and counter electrodes at a fixed distance from each other, whilst the reference \nelectrode was clamped overhead. \n \nA Sycopel PCI- 100 MK3 Potentiostat computer interface was used in conjunction with a \u2018Ministat \nPotentiostat\u2019, H.B. Thompson and Associates, (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) for all electrochemical studies: \ncurrent\/charge transients were recorded using a PC with dedicated software. AC impedance measurements \nwere performed using a ACM Auto AC DSP frequency response analyser and potentiostat again linked to \na PC. \n \nA Philips XL30 FEG SEM was used for all scanning electron microscopy.  \n \n \n 4\nElectrode Preparation  \nPolymer modified insulated electrodes were prepared on gold-coated glass slides as reported earlier \n(Myler and Higson 1997).  \n \nSonochemical Ablation of Polydiaminobenzene Ultra-Thin Films \nThe polymer modified electrodes were then immersed in a beaker containing distilled water, and then \nsonicated for 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and 90s using a Camlab Transsonic T460, 25kHz sonic \nbath. This is set and calibrated by the manufacturer and we have verified this using a crystal microphone \nand recording the sound waves on a digital storage oscilloscope. The sonic bath employed 12 transducers \ngeometrically arranged and bonded to the base of the stainless steel tank housing.  \n \nPolymerisation of  microelectrode arrays \nFor the polymerisation of Glucose oxidase enzyme microelectrode arrays, a pH 4.5 phthalate buffer was \nfirst prepared using 0.2M potassium hydrogen phthalate and 0.2M NaCl. A 0.2M aniline solution was then \nprepared in the phthalate buffer. Glucose oxidase, (500 units ml-1) was prepared in distilled water, to avoid \ndenaturing the enzyme. 2.7 ml of the buffer and enzyme preparation (1.35 ml each) were mixed in a small \nvolume PTFE cell, immediately prior to the electrochemical coating procedure being performed. \n \nAniline\/GOD was polymerised by potentially sequentially cycling for 5 minutes between \u2014200 and +800 \nmV vs. Ag\/AgCl at 50 mVs-1, film growths were terminated at \u20140.2V. Immediately following \npolymerisation, the working electrode was submerged in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer to prevent enzyme \ndenaturisation. \n \nVoltammetric Techniques \nHydrodynamic voltammetric techniques were used to examine the stir independent behaviour of the \nmicroelectrodes.  Polydiaminobenzene coated electrodes, sonicated for 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 \nseconds, were placed in the glass stage within the cell along with a gold sputtered counter electrode and \n 5\nAg\/AgCl reference electrode.  The electrodes were submerged within a 5 mM ferricyanide\/phosphate \nbuffer solution previously purged for 20 minutes with N2; the working electrode was then polarised at \u2013\n300 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl.  A magnetic stirrer was used to agitate the solution.  Current responses were \nrecorded using a PC with dedicated software. We have determined the reproducibility of sensor responses \nto be <5% variability in a series of trials. \n \nA C Impedance Analysis \nA sealed glass cell assembly contained a gold sputtered auxiliary, a Ag\/AgCI reference and an \nenzyme\/polyaniline microelectrode array in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution previously purged with \nnitrogen for 20 minutes for the removal of oxygen prior to any electrochemical investigation. Serial \nadditions of glucose were introduced to the cell giving 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM., 20 mM, 30 mM and 40 mM \nconcentrations. AC impedance measurements were performed using an ACM Auto AC DSP frequency \nresponse analyser between the frequencies of 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz. \n 6\nResults and Discussion \nWe have within our laboratory previously shown that 1,2-diaminobenzene dihydrochloride may be \nelectropolymerised at conductive surfaces via a 2e- process to form essentially defect free insulating \npolymer films of less than 100 nm thickness (Myler and Higson 1997).  \n \nThe rationale underpinning this work is that sonochemical ablation of thin insulating polymer films at \nelectrode surfaces may expose localised areas, each of which can act as localised microelectrodes and \ncollectively as a microelectrode array.   \n \nMany other workers have studied the immobilisation of enzymes (e.g. the oxidases and dehydrogenases) \nwithin conducting polymers such as polyaniline or polypyrrole for use within sensors (Foulds and Lowe \n1986, Shaolin et al 1992). We will, in this paper, describe a technique that allows the co-deposition of \nglucose oxidase within the conducting polymer, polyaniline, at conducting microelectrode cavities to form \n\u201cmushroom\u201d shaped microelectrode protrusions. \n \nThe interrogation of enzymatic microelectrode sensors of this type is described by both amperometric or \nAC impedance approaches to demonstrate their versatility.  Scanning electron micrographs of electrode \nsurfaces are included at each stage of the electrode fabrication process. \n \n1,2-diaminobenzene was first electropolymerised on gold sputter coated ground glass slides as previously \nreported (Myler and Higson 1997) and this is shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). Cyclic voltammetry for \nthe electrodeposition of insulating polydiaminobenzene film, Fig. 1(b), shows that diminishing peak \ncurrents are seen as the electrode becomes progressively insulated by the polymer film as it is deposited at \nthe electrode surface (Myler and Higson 1997).   \n \nScanning electron microscopy of a polydiaminobenzene coated gold substrate, Fig. 1(c), confirms that its \nsurface is largely featureless and that the electrode is coated and so insulated by an essentially defect free \n 7\npolymer film of polydiaminobenzene. Charge integration calculations for the current passed during the \nelectropolymerisation would suggest that the polymer film is ~30-40 nm in thickness, in close agreement \nwith previously calculated and experimentally determined thicknesses (Myler and Higson 1997).\n \nUltrasound (in the KHz range) passing through a solvent such as water causes thermal agitation and \nlocalised hotspots of up to several hundred to a few thousand K, which in turn gives rise to the formation \nof superheated vapour bubbles (Suslick 1990, Taleyarkan et al 2002). These bubbles are, however, cooled \nby the solvent at ambient temperature (in our studies 25oC) and asymmetrically implode with the ejection \nof micro-jets of solvent at speeds of up to several hundred ms-1. These micro-jets may cause the shattering \nof hard brittle solids and this is exploited, for example, within medicine for the shattering of kidney \nstones. Soft solid surfaces such as polymers may, however, be ablated by such jets (Suslick 1990). \n \nSonochemically fabricated microelectrodes were prepared via the ablation of polydiaminobenzene films \nusing an ultrasonic frequency of 25 KHz as shown schematically within Fig. 1(d), for a range of differing \ntime durations from 1 through to 90s. \n \nScanning electron micrographs for a 60s sonicated electrode assembly are shown in Fig. 1(e). These were \nchosen since these provided the clearest images of the cavitation at the polymer surface. There are several \nfeatures of interest within these micrographs. Firstly the distribution of the pores is random since ultra-\nsonic cavitation is a chaotic process.  It is also evident that almost all of the cavities are bimodal in size, \npossessing either ~3\u00b5m (+\/\u22121\u00b5m) or sub-micron diameters. We believe that the smallest of the cavities \nobserved are formed by the initial impact of the micro-jets of fluid (Suslick 1990). These cavities are \nknown to act as nucleation sites for further bubble formation (Suslick 1990) and it is thought that the \ncavity grows as new bubbles implode within the confines of the original cavity. This process gives rise to \na quantum enlargement in the diameter of a cavity. Since no larger pores are seen it is believed that the \n3\u00b5m diameter pores no longer act as nucleation sites. In some instances there is evidence of a few pores \njoining to form dumbbell shaped cavities when two pores form in close proximity to each other, Fig. 1(e). \n 8\nFig 1(f) shows a close-up of the pores, showing how the polymer coating has been peeled back from the \nsubstrate. \n \nElectrochemical characterisation \nElectrochemical evaluation of microelectrode assemblies was performed for possible use within sensors or \nbiosensors. Microelectrodes characteristically exhibit sigmoidal shaped cyclic voltammograms \n(Southampton 1985) for reversible solution bound redox couples such as Fe(CN)63-\/Fe(CN)64-, in contrast \nto the characteristic diffusion limited reversible voltammograms expected at a planar electrode surface.   \n \nFig. 2 shows a series of cyclic voltammograms recorded at a scan rate of 50 mVs-1 for a 1 mM solution of \nFe(CN)63- at (i) planar gold electrodes, the (ii) sonochemically fabricated microelectrode arrays and (iii) \npolydiaminobenzene coated gold electrodes as a control.  The voltammogram corresponding to the plain \ngold slides reveals an approximate 59 mV peak separation as would be expected for a 1e- diffusional \ncontrolled reversible reduction\/oxidation process. Cyclic voltammograms for the polymer insulated \nelectrode and the microelectrode array are also shown in the enlarged bubble caption of Fig. 2 for clarity. \nVery little voltammetric response is observed at the polydiaminobenzene coated electrode, confirming that \nits has been insulated. The micro-electrode array electrodes yield sigmoidal shaped voltammetric profiles \nsuggesting that all of the microelectrode arrays formed in this way were indeed exhibiting true \nmicroelectrode like behaviour.  Individual microelectrodes would be expected to see forward (reductive) \nand reverse (oxidative) current transients that would fall almost on top of each other with little evidence of \ndouble-layer charging capacitance, however separate forward and reverse peaks displaying evidence of \ndouble layer charging are observed in this case due to the very large pore density (115,000 \nmicroelectrodes cm-2) that will give rise to a significant cumulative double layer charging current. \n \nMicroelectrode Population Density and Reproducibility of Sensor Arrays. \nIt is important to understand in this context both how microelectrode population densities grow with \nincreasing sonication time as well as the reproducibility of their formation.  Population density may be \n 9\nestimated via SEM imaging across a number of quantified cross-sectional areas.  Fig. 3(a), shows that the \ncalculated population density of the microelectrode arrays enlarges in a near linear manner as the \nsonication time increases from 1 through to 90s. Coefficient of variance of the charge densities for arrays \nwas found to be <2% (at an electrode state E= -100mV vs Ag\/AgCl for the reduction of 1 mM Fe(CN)63-). \n \nConvectional stir-independence of microelectrode arrays. \nThe convectional (stir-independent behaviour) of the microelectrode arrays was investigated since this is \none of the most significant advantages that arrays could offer for use within sensors. \n \nAmperometric responses of microelectrode arrays formed via a range of differing sonication times \npolarised at \u2013600 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl to 1 mM Fe(CN)63-, were recorded in both unstirred (quiescent) and \nstirred solutions. If the microelectrodes were to become too closely packed together, eventually \nhemispherical diffusion profiles would begin to overlap and ultimately all microelectrode-like behaviour \nwould be lost. \n \nThe calculation of the percentage change in amperometric response in a quiescent and a stirred solution \nfor a given electrode allows us to assess when microelectrode behaviour begins to be lost, as \nmicroelectrode populations increase. The performance of electrodes prepared via different sonication \ntimes, Fig. 3(b) shows the percentage change in amperometric responses for electrodes when stirring is \nintroduced (in excess-via the use of a mechanical stirrer) in comparison to the response for the same \nelectrode in a quiescent (unstirred) solution.   \n \nMicroelectrode arrays prepared via 20s or less sonication show no change in signal response to the \nreduction of Fe(CN)63-, confirming that under these conditions the microelectrode arrays indeed show true \nstir independence in their response behaviour.  Microelectrodes sonicated for 30s, give rise to a ~5% \nincrease in response upon stirring the solution - and this variation increases progressively to a value in \nexcess of 30% for electrode arrays prepared via 90s sonication.  It is therefore clear that for electrodes \n 10\nprepared via 30s or longer sonication, that the microelectrode arrays population density reaches a value \nwhere the hemispherical diffusional profiles of the individual microelectrodes begin to overlap and that \nthis effect progressively leads to the loss of stir independent performance.   \n \nElectropolymerisation of enzyme containing polymer protrusions in microelectrode arrays. \nAniline solutions containing glucose oxidase were electropolymerised on microelectrode surfaces to form \nenzyme containing protrusions at each of the microelectrode cavities of the array as shown schematically, \nFig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b), shows cyclic voltammograms recorded for the electropolymerisation of aniline from \nphosphate buffer containing glucose oxidase. The voltammogram is characteristic of an irreversible \ndeposition with successive voltammograms progressively showing smaller peak currents (Foulds and \nLowe 1986, Shaolin et al 1992). Scanning electron microscopy, Fig. 4(c), of these arrays following the \nelectrodeposition of polyaniline shows that polymer protrusions are indeed formed via growth of the \npolymer from the sonochemically fabricated pores. Several interesting points should be noted from the \nelectron micrograph of Fig. 4(c).  Firstly it can be seen that all of the microelectrode cavitations appear to \nbe filled with polyaniline, including the very smallest of the ~0.1\u00b5m diameter pores. This shows all \nablative cavitations of the insulating polymer film lead to exposure of the underlying conductive surface, \nsince aniline could not be electropolymerised without access to the underlying conducting surface. \n \nSensor Interrogation Approaches. \nEnzymic microelectrode arrays of this type may interrogated by both (i) amperometric and (ii) \nimpedimetric approaches. Microelectrode arrays prepared by 20s sonication were used throughout, since \nthese offered the largest response whilst retaining stir-independent properties.  \n \n(i). Demonstration of Amperometric Interrogation \nEnzyme electrodes were polarised at +650 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl for the interrogation of glucose responses as a \nfirst demonstration of the enzymic microelectrode array described in this paper. Glucose oxidase catalyses \n 11\nthe production of H2O2 in the presence of glucose and oxygen, Eqn. 1. This approach allows for the \ninterrogation of the sensor based on the amperometric monitoring of H2O2, Eqn. 2. \n \nGlucose oxidase \nEqn. 1.  glucose + O2    \u00c6  Gluconolactone + H2O2.  \n \n+650 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl   \nEqn. 2.  H2O2                     \u00c6               2H+ + O2 + 2e-   \n \nThe calibration curve of Fig. 5(a), clearly demonstrates that an amperometric enzymatic sensor may be \nproduced (with stir-independent responses) that could be exploited for a variety of applications in which \nvarious flow conditions may be encountered. \n \n(i). Demonstration of Impedimetric Interrogation \nImpedimetric measurements for enzyme electrode sensors were recorded in the plane of the working \nmicroelectrode array\u00c6analyte solution\u00c6electrode. Since the solutional impedance contribution will affect \nthe final response of any sensor, defining and controlling the inter-electrode spacings of the working \nmicroelectrode array and counter electrode would clearly be crucial for all electrochemical investigations. \nA glass stage was therefore designed, to hold the working microelectrode array a fixed distance of 10 mm \nfrom the counter electrode within an analyte solution, with this assembly being designed so as to be held \nwithin a commercial Methrohm\u00ae glass cell as previously reported (Myler and Higson 1997). \n \nAc impedance spectra were first recorded for glucose oxidase\/polyaniline sonochemically fabricated \nmicroelectrode arrays across a range of frequencies from 0.1 through to 10000 Hz upon \u00b15 mV ac \nexcitation (0 V bias) (Teasdale and Wallace 1993), in order to characterise electrochemical redox \nbehaviour and sensor performance for a range of differing concentrations of glucose within O2 saturated \nconditions, Fig. 5(b). This bias potential allows monitoring of the impedance (conductivity) of the \npolymer without interference from, for example, the oxidation of H2O2 or biological interferents such as \n 12\nascorbate. It is clear that ac Bode impedance spectra show a clear trend towards lowered impedances upon \nincreasing concentration of glucose, with lowered impedances also occurring at higher frequencies. \n \nControl experiments were also performed by recording impedance spectra for enzyme free polyaniline \nmicroelectrode arrays (not shown for clarity) and showed minimal impedance changes to differing \nconcentrations of glucose, confirming that the sensor responses observed within Fig. 5(b) were indeed \nenzymatic in nature. \n \nIt is firstly clear that increasing concentrations of glucose give rise to lowered impedances, via the \nenzymic activity of glucose oxidase. \n \nA plot of total impedance vs. frequency is shown in Fig. 5(b) for a microelectrode exposed to 20 mM \nglucose with a corresponding Nyquist phase angle plot. For simplicity, only these plots are shown, since \nsimilar profiles are seen for all of the glucose concentration ranges studied. Fig. 5(c) shows a straight line \nprofile of the real Z\u2019 vs. the imaginary Z\u201d components with a slope close to unity, indicative of a diffusion \ncontrolled reversible process, where the phase angle (\u03b8) profiles seen within Fig. 5(b) would appear to be \ndictated by the capacitance of the polymer film in conjunction with the double layer contribution within \nthe circuit.  \n \nUntil now, we have only considered how recorded impedance values, or components thereof, vary under \ndiffering conditions, as opposed to how percentage changes in impedimetric behaviour vary even though \nthe total impedance measured may be dominated by the background impedance of the circuit. Percentage \nchanges of microelectrode array glucose sensors across a range of glucose concentrations as a function of \nfrequency under aerobic conditions are shown within Fig. 5(d). Percentage impedances are reported \nrelative to the corresponding impedance at 0 mM glucose at a particular frequency, as shown in Fig. 5(d). \nThese percentage changes may be plotted with respect to the analyte concentration in the form of a  \ncalibration plot, Fig. 5(e) clearly demonstrating this approach for interrogation. \n 13\n  \nThe most prominent feature of this data is that impedance minima are observed at frequencies between 10 \nHz and 100 Hz. Similar responses are seen under anaerobic conditions (not shown for clarity), although \nthe percentage changes in response are not so pronounced. We have already shown that the impedance \nvalues are modulated by enzyme catalytic behaviour, although the nature of the impedance changes have \nnot yet been considered. \n \nAt this stage the possible mechanisms by which the conductivity of the polyaniline may be modulated \nshould be considered. Polyaniline has three differing forms (Eggins 1996). \n \nThe first mechanism by which glucose oxidase may give rise to redox modulated conductivities within the \npolyaniline involves the catalysed production of H2O2 (Eggins 1996). Previous workers (Cooper and Hall \n1992) have shown that in aerobic conditions, H2O2 would be expected to play a major role in the \nmodulation of the impedimetric behaviour of polyaniline. The responses observed under anaerobic \nconditions could clearly not be accounted for by such a mechanism, since without a supply of molecular \noxygen as an electron acceptor from the enzyme, H2O2 could not be produced. Since we have established \nthat the impedimetric responses are due to enzyme catalytic behaviour, it follows that electron donation \nfrom the enzyme must be occurring by some other mechanism. Since the sensor responses under aerobic \nconditions are always greater than those observed under anaerobic conditions, it is therefore probable that \nthe generation of H2O2 in aerobic conditions might contribute to this behaviour - even if additional \nmechanisms are involved in the overall response. \n \nA number of other possible mechanisms to explain anaerobic glucose oxidase responses have also been \nproposed by other workers. One of the most controversial of these is via a possible direct electron transfer \noccurring between the active site of enzyme and the polymer (Cooper and Hall 1992). The distance \nthrough which electrons would have to traverse would be in excess of 1.3 nm (www-biol.paisley.ac.uk) \n 14\nand would on first reflection appear to be prohibitive. Other workers have shown, however, that electron \ntunnelling can occur across distances that had previously been thought impossible via complex pathways \nof unsaturated and delocalised bonds together even with some saturated bonds and free space (Moser et al \n1992, Onuchic et al 1992). \n \nIt should not be forgotten that gluconolactone may be produced under anodic conditions so long as a \nsurrogate electron acceptor for the enzyme is provided. Gluconolactone readily hydrolyses to form \ngluconic acid and this may easily protonate the polymer allowing another route for altering the \nconductivity of the polymer. \n \nSkinner and Hall (1997) have previously shown that gluconolactone produced under anaerobic conditions \nmay give rise to conductivity changes within the polymer via interaction of gluconolactone with the \nemeraldine base to form a zwitterion complex that itself may be readily oxidised through to the \nperigraniline form of the polymer. \n \nWhile this behaviour would account for anaerobic impedimetric responses for our sensors to glucose, it \nwould be difficult to fully explain why the response profiles we have observed exhibit minima at \nfrequencies of approximately 10 Hz to 100 Hz. We believe that this behaviour could be linked to the \nhydrogen bonding of water to the imine centre of the polymer. These effects have been extensively studied \nand while these findings cannot be fully described here due to space limitations, they will form the basis \nof a subsequent publication. \n \nApplications of Sonochemically Fabricated Sensors. \nThe focus of this report has been to show that sonochemical ablation of thin-polydiaminobenzene film \ncoatings that insulate planar electrode surfaces can be exploited as a novel approach for the fabrication of \nmicroelectrode arrays.  It was, at the outset, our intention to exploit these arrays as templates within a \nrange of differing sensors and biosensors. \n 15\n Enzymatic sensors of this type have so far been developed for ethanol, oxalate and a range of pesticides  \nas well as DNA hybridisation and affinity antibody\/antigen based sensors, all of which will be reported in \nforthcoming publications. These enhanced sensitivities and lower limits of detection have been made \npossible via the hemispherical diffusional profiles these microelectrode arrays experience. \n 16\nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the BBSRC for funding for FD as part of the Centre for Bioarray \ninnovation as part of the post-genomic consortium, the EPSRC for studentships for DDG and DWM and \nthe European Community for contracts QLK3-CT-2000-000481 (SAFEGARD) for KAL, QLRT-2001-\n02583 (SMILE) and T505485-1 (ELISHA). \n \n 17\nReferences: \nClark, L.C and Lyons, I.R., 1962 Electrode systems for continuous monitoring in cardiovascular surgery. \nAnn New York Academy Sci. 102, 29. \nCooper, J.C and Hall, E.A.H., 1992 Electrochemical response of an enzyme-loaded polyaniline film. \nBiosensors and Bioelectronics, 7, 473-485. \nEggins, B., 1996 Biosensors - An Introduction, Wiley, Chichester. \nFoulds, N.C and Lowe, C.R., 1986 Enzyme entrapment in electrically conducting polymers, \nimmobilization of glucose-oxidase in polypyrrole and its application in amperometric glucose sensors.
