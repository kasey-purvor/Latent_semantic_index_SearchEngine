Introduction and Rationale\n[2] The Aegean and Mediterranean Seas are of particular\nimportance to palaeoceanography, as the limited volumes of\nthese basins promote rapid responses to climatic change.\nBecause of the restricted communication with the open\nocean, these responses are also amplified in comparison\nwith oceanic signals. Together with the enhanced sediment\naccumulation rate common in marginal basins, this allows\ndetailed records of change to be preserved, and facilitates\nhigh-resolution sampling [Bethoux et al., 1999]. However,\nto interpret this wealth of information accurately, good\ndating constraints are essential [Sarnthein et al., 2000].\n[3] Unfortunately, high accumulation rates commonly\nincrease the probability of sediment reworking. It has been\nsuggested that much of the sediment in the Mediterranean is\nredeposited, with some estimates ranging as high as 75%\n[Stanley, 1985]. Another pervasive problem in marine cores\nis bioturbation, which mixes older and more recent material.\nHence individual AMS dating results are not as reproduc-\nible as one would wish. Careful sample selection can\nincrease the accuracy of individual datings, but even small\namounts of allochthonous \u2018\u2018old\u2019\u2019 carbon, normally impos-\nsible to detect when picking material, may cause significant\nanomalies, biasing results toward older ages. For example, a\n10% increase in \u2018\u2018dead\u2019\u2019 carbon in a sample will result in an\nage biasing of \u0001800 radiocarbon convention years.\n[4] Jorissen et al. [1993] reported wide dating ranges for\nthe timing of I\/II and II\/III biozonal boundaries in the\nMediterranean, spanning 950 and 1270 years, respectively.\nThe association of these boundaries with the global glacial\nTerminations 1a and 1b in their records suggests that the\ndating range is not real, but a likely artifact due to dating\nuncertainties. Jorissen et al. [1993] also note offsets in the\nradiocarbon ages for a number of evident lithological\nhorizons between Adriatic cores IN68-9 and IN68-5 (only\n100 km apart), with offsets nonsystematically varying\nbetween 300 and 1400 years, suggesting dating uncertain-\nties. Moreover sequences of dating within a single core may\nalso highlight uncertainties. For example, Jorissen et al.\n[1993] show several instances of dating \u2018\u2018reversals\u2019\u2019 within\nindividual cores. Similarly core KET 8216 from the Adriatic\nshows an 800 year difference between virtually adjacent\ndatings from below and above the base of the sapropel (S1)\n[Fontugne et al., 1989]. These datings are only 3 cm apart\nand the suggested separation would require an almost\nthreefold reduction in the average sedimentation rate of\nthe core. Although individual datings may be offset from\n\u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 age by variation in the reservoir age, this is unlikely\nto explain substantial dating reversals or large age differ-\nPALEOCEANOGRAPHY, VOL. 22, PA4215, doi:10.1029\/2007PA001422, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Geography, Durham University, Science Site, Durham,\nUK.\n2Geology Department, Mansoura University, El-Mansoura, Egypt.\n3National Oceanography Centre, European Way, Southampton, UK.\n4Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Waikato,\nHamilton, New Zealand.\n5Laboratoire des Bio-Indicateurs Actuels et fossils, UFR Sciences,\nAngers, France.\n6School of Geography, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.\n7Department of Archaeology, Durham University, Science Site,\nDurham, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0883-8305\/07\/2007PA001422$12.00\nPA4215 1 of 15\nences between narrowly spaced samples. These offsets are\nmore likely to have resulted from sedimentary processes\naffecting the material that was dated.\n[5] The main sedimentary processes concerned involve\nremobilization and redeposition of previously deposited\nmaterials and\/or bioturbational mixing. Bioturbation effects\nhave been previously discussed, in general [Bard, 2001] and\nfor the specific example of Zoophycos burrows [Lo\u00a8wemark\nand Werner, 2001; Bromley and Hanken, 2003]. Lo\u00a8wemark\nand Werner [2001] emphasize that there can be considerable\ndifficulty in recognising Zoophycos traces in unconsolidated\nsediments, and suggest that such burrows may cause age\nfalsifications of as much as 1110\u20132525 years. These effects\nare not limited to the remobilization of older material by\nburrowing, but may also include the pushing of younger\nmaterial down into older sediments by up to 1 m.\n[6] Thus the real limitations to age accuracy are not\ninstrumental but, determined by the nature of the dated\nmaterials and the sedimentary history. Datings on a single\nhorizon are best viewed as individual samples from a\nprobability function, which we aim to quantify here. The\ndistribution of dates in previous work (see above) suggests\nthat in the eastern Mediterranean as a whole, margins of\n\u2018\u2018error\u2019\u2019 might be expected of the order of \u00b1800 years.\n[7] Our high-resolution Aegean records provide a unique\nopportunity to constrain a regional Aegean chronostrati-\ngraphic framework, by comparing and contrasting detailed\nmultiproxy stratigraphic and AMS 14C data. With the\nAegean\u2019s limited area it is expected that events would be\n(virtually) synchronous across the basin and the occurrence\nof the sapropel S1 provides a useful interval with sup-\npressed bioturbation. We use a multiproxy approach to\nreduce parameter-specific bias, such as regional asynchro-\nneity or patchiness in faunal records; postdepositional reox-\nygenation of sapropel tops [Higgs et al., 1994; Thomson et\nal., 1995]; or more general signal disturbances by, for\nexample, bioturbation and reworking. An event-based stra-\ntigraphy enables the assembling of dates from several cores\ninto a \u2018\u2018master\u2019\u2019 stratigraphic framework with the potential\nto assess the error in any one individual dating. This allows\nFigure 1. Core locations. Solid circles indicate cores presented in this study, and open circles are core\nsites from the published literature (see text for references).

The event\nstratigraphic framework may provide further studies with a\nmeans to assess chronostratigraphy in considerable detail\nand hence to provide guidance for targeting new AMS\nradiocarbon datings.\n2. Methods\n[8] We present results for three gravity cores on a transect\nthrough the northern Aegean Basin (SL-11, SL-21, and\nSL-31), an additional gravity core (SLA-9) and two piston\ncores from the southern Aegean (LC-21) and from the Levan-\ntine Sea (LC-31). All six cores consist of microfossil-rich\nhemipelagic ooze with a clearly defined darker band of\nsapropelic material. Core locations are shown in Figure 1, with\ntheir exact coordinates and water depths detailed in Table 1.\n[9] Each corewas sampled in a contiguous sequence: SL-21,\nSL-31, and SLA-9 at 0.5 cm intervals; and LC-31 and LC-21 at\n1 cm intervals for faunal analysis. Cores SLA-9, LC-21, and\nLC-31 were also sampled at 1 cm intervals for geochemical\nanalysis. The faunal samples were freeze-dried, weighed, and\nselected (weighed) subsamples were disaggregated and wet\nsieved using demineralized water. The sieved fractions were\ncollected on 600, 150, 125, and 63 mm mesh sizes. The\n>150 mm fractions were subdivided using a random splitter\nto provide an aliquot of at least 200 individual planktonic\nforaminifera, providing a significance level of at least 95% for\nspecies of 4% or greater relative abundance [see Fatela and\nTaborda, 2002]. These were then identified, sorted on\nChapman slides, and counted. Results were recorded as\nabsolute abundance in numbers g\u00021 sediment dry weight\nand as relative abundance or percentages. We present here\nonly the percentages, for brevity (Figure 2).\n[10] Detailed stable oxygen and carbon isotope records\nhave been constructed for several individual planktonic forami-\nniferal species in cores LC-21, LC-31, SLA-9, SL-11, SL-21,\nand SL-31, with resolutions of the order of 1 cm (Figure 3).\nThe species selected were the shallow, surface-dwelling\nGlobigerinoides ruber (white) and the deep-living species\nNeogloboquadrina pachyderma (right coiling) which has been\nassociated with the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum at the base of\nthe euphotic layer [Rohling and Gieske, 1989; Rohling et al.,\n2004, 1995]. This selection follows global and specific Med-\niterranean habitat descriptions [Hemleben et al., 1989; Pujol\nand Vergnaud Grazzini, 1995; De Rijk et al., 1999; Hayes et\nal., 1999; Rohling et al., 1993, 1995, 1997, 2004], which are\ncorroborated for the study area by isotopic evidence [Casford\net al., 2001, 2002]. The stable isotope analyses were per-\nformed at two separate intercalibrated facilities at the National\nOceanography Centre (NOC) on a Europa Geo 20-20 with\nindividual acid bath preparation; and at NERC Isotope Geo-\nscience Laboratory (NIGL), Keyworth on the VG-Optima with\na common acid bath preparation. Isotope results are reported in\n% deviations from the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard.\nAnalytical errors are of the order of 0.06% (1s).\n[11] Samples for geochemical were freeze-dried, provid-\ning approximately 5g of dried material for analysis in LC-31\nand 3g in SLA-9 and LC-21. Samples from cores LC-21\n[see Mercone et al., 2000] and LC-31 were analyzed by\nX-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) at NOC. The dried sample was\nground in an agate mortar, then 3g was pressed into disc\nshaped pellets and the pellets analyzed for minor elements.\nThe remaining 2g of material was treated with a fluxing\nagent and melted to form glass beads that were analyzed for\nmajor elements. Core SLA-9 was analyzed for concentra-\ntions of Al, S, Ba, Ca, Mn, Fe, and P by Induced Coupled\nPlasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Dried,\nground samples were determined from digestion in a mix-\nture of HF, HNO3 and HClO4 and final solution in 1 M HCl.\nThis method is adapted from Li et al. [1995]. We note that\nthe two methods can give significantly different values for\ncertain elements, especially lithophiles, because of incom-\nplete extraction.\n3. Radiocarbon Dates\n[12] AMS radiocarbon dates were obtained for cores LC-\n21, LC-31, SLA-9, and SL-31 using handpicked clean\nplanktonic foraminiferal tests with no evidence of pyritiza-\ntion or overgrowth. The samples were too small for mono-\nspecific dating [Bard et al., 1987], but no systematic\ndifferences would be expected within the Mediterranean\nbasin for such dates relative to clean total planktonic\nforaminiferal tests [cf. Jorissen et al., 1993]. The picked\nmaterial was submitted for analysis at the NERC radiocarbon\nlaboratory at SUERC (LC-21, LC-31) and at the Leibniz\nAMSLaboratory at Kiel (Germany) (SLA-9, SL-31). Datings\nfor the other cores discussed here have been presented\nTable 1.

CASFORD ET AL.: CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY FOR EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n6 of 15\nPA4215\npreviously: cores SK-1 [Zachariasse et al., 1997], IN68-9\n[Jorissen et al., 1993; Rohling et al., 1997], and C-40\n[Geraga et al., 2000]. We calibrate radiocarbon ages in this\npaper using the IntCal Marine04 curve and the program\nCalib 5.1 [Stuiver and Reimer, 1993, Hughen et al., 2004a]\nwith reservoir-age corrections (DR) as discussed in the text.\n[13] Radiocarbon datings are best seen as a direct expres-\nsion of the concentration of 14C (abbrv. [14C]). As such,\nthey contain three components: the age-controlled reduction\nin [14C] from original concentrations common in all cores; a\nreservoir age effect, which for any given time slice is likely\nto be very similar in the cores presented here because of\ntheir close proximity; and an undetermined contribution of\nold carbon, which may vary considerably between individ-\nual core samples. The radiocarbon convention ages obtained\nare shown in Table 2. To obtain reliable calibrated ages, an\naccurate assessment of the reservoir age effect and of the\ncalibration to calendar years is needed. Both of these require\nforeknowledge of the error in the undetermined old carbon\ncontribution, with small increases in the uncertainty of\nuncorrected ages adding considerably to the errors in\ncalibrated ages. Here, we present two direct date compar-\nisons using uncalibrated ages and calibrated ages both\nconstrained by basinwide synchronous events. This event\nstratigraphy allows us to produce a reduced error age model\nfor uncalibrated and calibrated radiocarbon concentrations\nin the eastern Mediterranean. These two approaches are\ncomplementary to one another. The uncalibrated age model\nmakes no assumption of error size, and so provides an\nindependent assessment of the size of the total uncertainty,\nbut it is based on the assumption that reservoir age effects\nare similar between cores (see section 7). The calibrated\nmodel allows us to directly assess the component causes of\nuncertainty in individual samples, but requires that we make\nassumptions about the size of these uncertainties before\ncalibrating the dates. Together these two approaches allow\nus to assess the potential errors in both the dating and\ncalibration process.\n4. Event Stratigraphy\n[14] We identify and describe 24 faunal, isotopic and\ngeochemical events and use these to define a stratigraphi-\ncally controlled chronology. Each event is identified by\neither a sharp change in gradient with time or by alterna-\ntions of presence and absence in the case of faunal changes.\nWe divide these events into 12 primary and 12 ancillary\nevents. The primary events are defined as occurring in all\ncores (analysis permitting) and appear to be basin wide.\nAncillary events (mostly faunal) are defined as those that\noccur only in some of the cores and\/or those that may have\nthe potential to give a local or asynchronous expression.\n[15] Primary events are subdivided into isotopic, faunal,\nand chemical.

This final\nisotope event is similar in character to isotope event 1.\nHowever, it appears to occur earlier than the d18O N.pachy-\nderma inflection. The nature and causes of these events are\nexamined in more detail by Casford et al. [2002, 2003].\n[16] Faunal events are identified on exits, entries and\nparticularly strong inflections in the faunal record. Both\nabsolute and relative abundance records were used to\nestablish the exact levels of entries and exits. Inflections\nin the record were taken from relative abundance plots only\nand may reflect population shifts rather than changes in\nabsolute numbers of the individual species listed. The\nprimary faunal events (Figure 2 and Table 3) are (event 4)\nthe exit or low in G.inflata above peak at top of sapropel;\n(event 5) the first (near) absence of O.universa above the\nsapropel; and (event 6) the minimum or absence in G.inflata\nnear the top of the sapropel, which is followed by a rapid\nincrease in G.inflata on or shortly after the top of the darker\nsapropelic material. Next, we use (event 7) the last absence\nof O.universa before the sapropel; (event 8) the end of the\nramping down in T.quinqueloba relative abundance below\nthe sapropel, which often ramps down to zero abundance;\nand (event 9) the first, rapid increase in G.ruber located\nbelow the sapropel, marking the shift from very low values or\nabsence to the higher Holocene\/sapropel levels. This popu-\nlation shift seems to be associated with the isotopic increase\nin d18O G.ruber normally identified as Termination 1a\n[Casford et al., 2001, 2002]. This faunal point is constrained\nat the last low value in G.ruber\u2019s relative abundance before\nthe increase.\n[17] Chemical signals in marine cores generally record\ndiagenetic changes within the sediment. This is a particular\nproblem during periods of sapropel deposition which are\nknown to suffer oxidative \u2018\u2018burn down\u2019\u2019. This study focuses\non the barium signal, as while there is some potential for\nremobilization [Dickens, 2001], the Ba\/Al ratio is widely\nbelieved to reflect precipitation associated with primary\nproductivity or at least to record syndepositional changes\n(further discussion by Calvert [1983]; Van Os et al. [1991,\n1994]; Thomson et al. [1999]; and Mercone et al. [2001]).\nThese primary geochemical events are identified by their\ndeviation from background values, as shown in Figure 4:\n(event 10) the end of Ba\/Al anomaly, where it returns to\nbackground values; (event 11) the lowest point in the saddle\nin the Ba\/Al anomaly within the sapropel and; (event 12)\nthe start of the anomaly, where the Ba\/Al ratio appears to\ndepart from background values.\n[18] Ancillary events are identified in Table 4 and illus-\ntrated in Figures 2 and 3. We determine the regression\nrelationships between the depths of occurrence of the\nprimary events in each core, to allow a direct stratigraph-\nically controlled comparison between the cores. The details\nof each regression are given in Table 1, and we show the \u00b12\nstandard errors (SE) interval relevant for each regression on\nthe plots (Figure 1). The ancillary events are also provided\nin these plots as validation of the primary regression. As\ncore LC-21 is one of the best dated and most understood\nrecords in the eastern Mediterranean [Hayes et al., 1999; De\nRijk et al., 1999; Mercone et al., 2000, 2001; Casford et al.,\n2002; Rohling et al., 2002; Casford et al., 2003], we use\nLC-21 as the standard and we plot the occurrence depth of\nall events in each individual core versus their equivalent\ndepths in LC-21.\n[19] The statistically determined multiproxy stratigraphic\nframework allows the production of \u2018\u2018stacked\u2019\u2019 age models,\nusing the regression equations, to project both uncalibrated\nand calibrated AMS 14C datings from the various records\n(Table 2) onto the age-depth framework of LC-21. We\nalready have a well-constrained chronostratigraphic frame-\nwork for LC-21 from its \u2018\u2018own\u2019\u2019 AMS 14C datings (Table 2)\nand by correlation to GISP II [Rohling et al., 2002], so we\ncan use the ages projected from other cores to assess the\nquality of our intercore (radiocarbon) correlations. The 2 SE\nintervals constrain the uncertainty in the assigned LC-21\nequivalent depths. If this projection were poor, the dates\nfrom the other Aegean cores would be unlikely to fit within\nthe established time framework. Having thus projected all\ndatings into LC-21, the new joint dating framework can be\ncompared against the framework on the basis of the datings\nfor LC-21 proper (Figure 5). We conclude that our correla-\nTable 3.

In addition, the age-depth model for\nLC-21 can thus be corroborated and further detailed by the\naddition of the projected datings from our correlated cores.\n5. Uncalibrated Chronology\n[20] We use the new composite Aegean time frame to\nexamine other previously published, lower-resolution\nrecords from the same region: cores SK-1 [Zachariasse et\nal., 1997] and C-40 [Geraga et al., 2000]. These are located\nclose to our existing cores (Figure 1), provide good signal\ncomparability with our records and allow the assumption\nthat reservoir ages between cores are small [Reimer and\nMcCormac, 2002] (see discussion of calibrated framework\nin section 6). Any differences in the reservoir ages will be\nconstrained within the 2 SE correlation uncertainty. The\ndepth of each identified correlation level in these cores is\nlisted in Table 3 and regressions are shown in Figure 6. The\nequations for standardizing depths to the LC-21 depth scale\nare shown in Table 1, and these were used to calculate the\nTable 4.

Circled numbers indicate primary geochemical events\n(Table 3). The dark bar represents the position of the visible sapropel. We note that the Ba\/Al ratio differs\nsignificantly between the cores; this may relate to differences in analytical techniques, local productivity,\nclay inputs, or a combination of these.\nPA4215 CASFORD ET AL.: CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY FOR EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n9 of 15\nPA4215\nLC-21 equivalent depths for the datings in cores SK-1 and\nC-40, reported in the source publications. Figure 6 shows\nthese dates against the Aegean framework of \u2018\u2018age versus\nLC-21 equivalent depth\u2019\u2019 that was presented in Figure 5.\n[21] We also examine the potential use of our method in\ncores from outside the Aegean Sea. Two high-resolution\ncores were chosen: LC-31 (Levantine\/eastern Mediterra-\nnean Sea; this study) and IN68-9 (Adriatic Sea [Jorissen\net al., 1993; Rohling et al., 1997]). These cores were\nselected, as both possess multiproxy records and AMS\nradiocarbon datings. The identified events are detailed in\nTable 2 and the regressions are shown in Figure 6 and\nitemized in Table 1. As with SK-1 and C-40, we plot these\ncores\u2019 AMS 14C datings versus LC-21 equivalent depth\n(based on the regressions), in comparison with our overall\nAegean framework (Figure 5). The result provides strong\nendorsement of our new correlation method and of our\noverall Aegean chronostratigraphic framework, hence con-\nFigure 5. Chronostratigraphic framework for LC-21 and all dated Aegean cores from this study,\nshowing radiocarbon convention ages and calibrated ages from our Aegean cores plotted versus a LC-21\nequivalent depth. The narrow line indicates best fit regression for datings on LC-21 only, and the heavy\nline indicates the best fit regression on our three Aegean Sea cores. For radiocarbon convention ages the\nvertical error bars represent the machine errors quoted for the datings (see Table 2) and horizontal error\nbars equate to the 2 SE from our \u2018\u2018event occurrence versus depth\u2019\u2019 regressions, projected on a LC-21\nequivalent depth scale. For calibrated ages, only vertical error bars are shown as all uncertainties must be\nestimated before calibration. The size of these bars represents the 1 sigma probability spread of the\ncalibration, with median values for the date shown as symbol points. In addition, we detail the second-\norder polynomial for all Aegean datings, shown within the legend.\nFigure 6.

Event occurrence\nregressions are included to the right of the age correlation, with regressions of the depth occurrence (in centimeters down\ncore) for primary events (solid diamonds) and ancillary events (open diamonds) and a 2 SE error bar on the x axis.\nPA4215 CASFORD ET AL.: CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY FOR EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n10 of 15\nPA4215\nF\nig\nu\nre\n6\nPA4215 CASFORD ET AL.: CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY FOR EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n11 of 15\nPA4215\nfirming that the framework is also applicable outside the\nAegean Sea.\n[22] To evaluate the usefulness of our method and the\nresultant Aegean (and eastern Mediterranean) chronostrati-\ngraphic framework (Figure 5), a critical quantitative assess-\nment is needed. Using our chronostratigraphic framework\nan age can be predicted for each depth in LC-21, and\ntherefore via the regressions, in any of the correlated cores.\nWe can thus predict an age for all horizons at which AMS\n14C datings were performed. In an ideal case the predicted\nand analyzed values would coincide perfectly, and a plot of\none versus the other (Figure 7) would follow a 45\u0001 line\nthrough the origin. Since most conceivable mechanisms\nbiasing AMS ages tend to impose shifts toward older\nvalues, we expect a proportion of the datings to fall off\nthe isoline toward older ages (shaded area). Figure 7 shows\nan excellent overall agreement between predicted and\nobserved ages, even in datings that are entirely independent\nof the time frame used for the predictions (i.e., those in LC-\n31, IN68-9, C-40, and SK-1).\n[23] Using the age in radiocarbon convention years, the\nisoline falls within 1 SE (\u0001120 years) of the regression\nthrough all points (Figure 7). Within our ability to deter-\nmine, these lines appear to be identical. The framework\nmust then approach the chronostratigraphic accuracy of the\ndating technique itself and the spread of datings around this\nline will reflect the total (analytical plus material related)\nerror of the individual AMS datings, including any potential\nvariation in DR between sites. This suggests that the total\nerror for AMS 14C datings on this type of material is of the\norder of \u00b1240 years (2 SE) in the eastern Mediterranean.\n6. Calibrated Framework\n[24] We can follow the same process with the calibrated\ndatings. However, before this is possible we must have a\nclear understanding of the size of potential errors in this\nprocess and the value for the marine carbon reservoir age.\nAny direct intercomparison of dating between cores requires\nradiocarbon dates to be corrected for variations in produc-\ntion rates of 14C over time (calibration), the contribution of\nold carbon, and to account for the marine reservoir effect.\n[25] Unlike the uncalibrated datings we need to determine\nthe sample uncertainty and reservoir ages directly before we\ncan accurately calibrate the dates. To do this we need to\nknow the size of contribution of old carbon. However, until\ntechnology advances enough to allow dating on single\nforaminifera these measurements can only be estimated.\nFor the cores in this study we assume bioturbation to be\nlimited to 10 cm [Casford et al., 2002] except within the\nperiods of sapropel deposition [Rohling et al., 2002].\nDuring sapropel deposition bioturbation appears to be\nreduced. Only few sapropels are truly laminated, however,\nso in most cases there may have been some bioturbation,\nFigure 7.

Similarly the sampling interval (an integration of\nseveral decades to centuries) will also add to the uncertainty.\nThese sampling uncertainties together with the analytical\nuncertainty are detailed in Table 2. A simple addition of\nthese errors suggests the uncertainties in any one dating may\nbe as large as 1200 years and is termed sampling uncertainty\nin Table 2, i.e.,\ndsampling uncertainty \u00bc p d2analysis \u00fe d2sample range \u00fe d2bioturbation\n\u0001 \u0002\n[26] Before calibration we also need to allow for the\nadditional 2 SE uncertainty in the correlation framework.\ndtotal \u00bc p d2sampling uncertainty \u00fe d2correlation\n\u0001 \u0002\nCalibration will propagate and increase these errors. Even in\nLC-21 (no correlation error) the median datings from\ncalibration have an average 2s range of 1710 years or \u00b1855\nyears and a high of 2822 (\u00b11411 years). This is similar to\nthe error size suggested by the uncalibrated ages by Jorissen\net al. [1993]. This suggests these age differences are real\nand that individual datings may be rather misleading.\nFortunately we can substantially reduce these errors by\nconstructing a time framework model that benefits from\nerror reduction by multiple datings.\n7. Marine Reservoir Effect\n[27] Before calibrating we must also assess the size of the\nmarine reservoir effect. Foraminifera fix carbon (including\n14C) in the form of calcite from carbonate and bicarbonate\nions in seawater. 14C atoms are formed in the upper\natmosphere by the addition of a neutron and loss of a\nproton from abundant 14N (present as molecular nitrogen\nN2). These\n14C atoms immediately start to decay back to\n14N (by emission of a beta particle, 0b). Radioactive 14C\nreacts with oxygen to form CO2 and is incorporated into the\natmospheric carbon budget. In the oceans, only surface\nwaters can freely exchange CO2 and hence take up this\natmospheric 14C signal [Broecker and Peng, 1974]. As\nocean waters are mixed away from the surface, 14C lost\nby radioactive decay is not longer replaced by exchange\nwith the atmosphere. Hence all marine waters show an\naging 14C signal and the longer a water mass is removed\nfrom the surface exchange the older the radiocarbon signal\n[Mangerud, 1972]. This means that any marine (foraminif-\neral) calcite will show an older radiocarbon age than its true\nage, because of the inclusion of this old carbon [Berger et\nal., 1966]. The amount of old carbon is controlled by the\ndepth\/region of the calcite growth, the circulation regime of\nthis site and any life effects involved in the deposition of the\ncalcite [Mangerud, 1972]. Clearly, this will vary both\nspatially and temporally, and a \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 reservoir age is\nnormally impossible to determine. In practice, estimates of\nthis reservoir age are a combination of an averaged whole\nocean reservoir age of 405 years plus a local correction\ntermed DR. This local correction is based on averages of\nseveral measurements across large areas, often over whole\nocean basins, with an error value quoted to account for\npossible spatial variability and accuracy in the measurement\nprocess [Stuiver et al., 1986].\n[28] In addition, a number of closed system assumptions are\nnormallymade: (1) that there is no influx of old carbon into the\nbasin, e.g., from terrestrial\/riverine sources; and (2) that the\nsample material accurately records the age of the horizon in\nwhich it is found (i.e., no bioturbation or redeposition).\n[29] This can lead to considerable inaccuracies. For exam-\nple even in the highly laminated (annually) varved sediments\nof the Cariaco Basin with no bioturbation and little fluvial\ninput, foram ages show a standard deviation from the varved\ndetermined agemodel of 42 14C years [Hughen et al., 2004b].\nHughen et al. also note potential age falsifications due to\ncontamination in some individual samples of up to 145 years.\n[30] Within the Mediterranean, Reimer and McCormac\n[2002] suggest that there is statistically no difference\nbetween reservoir age results recorded in all of the basins\nincluding the Aegean basin. They suggested a local reser-\nvoir age correction (DR) of 58 \u00b1 85 14C years for the last\n6000 years. This DR is based on the measurement of four\nmarine shells in the Aegean, a further four from the wider\neastern Mediterranean, and 26 measurements in the rest of\nthe Mediterranean Sea. They also suggest that before\n6000 years B.P., changes in deep water circulation should\nbe taken into account, notably during the period of sapropel\ndeposition between 6000 and 9000 14C years B.P. that is\nknown to have been characterized by reduced deep water\nventilation [Rohling, 1994;Kallel et al., 1997;Mercone et al.,\n2000; Casford et al., 2003]. A single shell determination of\nDR during this period of sapropel deposition gives a DR\nvalue of 149 \u00b1 30 years [Facorellis et al., 1998]. Before\n9000 years B.P., circulation in the Aegean appears to have\ngenerally been similar to the modern since \u000118,000 years\nB.P. [Casford et al., 2002]. For ages older than 18,000 14C\nyears B.P., DR is harder to model, since lower sea levels\nreduced the shallow shelf areas essential for deep water\nproduction but colder temperatures increased the density of\nthe surface waters. Siani et al. [2001] attempted to resolve\nuncertainty prior to 12,000 years B.P. by dating planktonic\nforaminifera associated with marine tephras. They deter-\nmined seven values for surface water age over the last\n18,000 years, five of which correspond to the modern values\nduring the Holocene, Younger Dryas and the Last Glacial\nMaximum. The remaining two values at 15 700 and\n17,000 years B.P. both show noticeable increases in surface\nwater age. However, this calculation assumes no bioturba-\ntion in the marine samples. Siani et al. explicitly state this\nassumption, justifying it by pointing to the high sedimen-\ntation rate of \u2018\u2018\u000135 cm in 1000 years\u2019\u2019. This is somewhat\nproblematic, since such marine tephras are normally found\nas admixtures of marine ooze and ash and do not preclude\nnormal bioturbation processes after deposition. Moreover\nwhen such layers comprise pure ash they do not prevent\nbioturbation until the time of the tephra placement. Thus\neven low bioturbation rates of the order of 10 cm [Casford\net al., 2002] would suggest that inaccuracies of the order of\n300 years remain possible. Still the arguments of Siani et al.\n[2001] for older surface waters in this period are both\nPA4215 CASFORD ET AL.: CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY FOR EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n13 of 15\nPA4215\ninteresting and persuasive. Siani et al. also state that they\ncannot rule out the possibility that the two datings showing\nwater ages older than expected, are short-lived events and\nconstrain these excursions inDR to the year ranges [Siani et\nal., 2001]. As the dates used here do not fall in either of\nthese excursions and the bioturbation argument is not\ncomprehensively addressed by Siani et al. [2001] we use\na value for DR of 58 \u00b1 85 14C years below the sapropel\n[Reimer and McCormac, 2002]. This is consistent with\nSiani et al.\u2019s five remaining datings.\n8. Error Reduction\n[31] Multiproxy studies within the radiocarbon dating\nrange are often supported by about 10 AMS 14C datings,\nfor reasons of economy and practicality (i.e., availability of\nmaterial). By using these datings to construct an age model,\nsome error reduction (relative to individual values) can be\nachieved. This reduction is proportional to 1\/\np\nn where n is\nthe number of analyses. Thus analyzing 10 samples will\nreduce the standard error for the framework to 31% of the\naverage error for individual analyses. Thirty datings are\nrequired to obtain an error reduction to 18% of the total\nspread of data and more than 100 samples to reduce this to\nbelow 10%. Beyond 30 samples, increasing the number of\ndatings results in only small (and decreasing) improvements\nin precision. We provide 30 datings inside our correlatable\nboundaries. This allows us to determine a calibrated age\nmodel that benefits from this error reduction. We determine\nthat the calibrated time frame (Figures 5 and 6) provides an\nage model with uncertainties of the order of \u00b1350 years.\nAddition of more datings is unlikely to lead to substantial\nimprovements through error reduction.\n[32] These considerations dictate that future studies in\nmarine cores using microfossil material require at least 30\ndatings to constrain the chronology in systems where\nsediment deposition appears linear. Relating a new core to\nour framework would offer a cheap and easily applied tool\nto apply maximal error reduction for the time-stratigraphic\nframework of new Mediterranean cores. Every additional\nAMS dating correlated into our framework helps to further\nimprove its accuracy and usefulness. We emphasize that the\nmain effort to improve the framework is best targeted at\nextending the upper and especially lower boundaries of the\ncorrelated interval.\n9. Conclusions\n[33] Material used in individual marine AMS 14C datings\nis normally a composite of both contemporaneous and\nallochtonous material. This present study quantifies the total\nstatistical error resultant from this composite. AMS dates on\nplanktonic foraminifera or other similar material must\naccount for the recorded variance, with the literature and\nthe 2s (95% of variance) results in our study suggesting the\nuncertainties in individual AMS datings are of the order of\n1300 years.\n[34] To optimize error reductions in the chronostrati-\ngraphic of a single core, at least 30 data points are required.\nOur method offers a standard eastern Mediterranean frame-\nwork with 30 datings already in place, and allows optimum\nerror reduction to the time framework of any core correlated\ninto this framework. This framework currently gives error\nvalues of \u00b1240 years (2 SE) for our uncalibrated time\nframework and \u00b1350 years (2s, 95% variance) in the\ncalibrated time framework.\n[35] Correlation of additional cores to this framework\nwould improve these uncertainties. For correlation to the\nframework a strict application of the events identified here\nfrom records of multiple proxies, is required. These records\nshould in addition rely on proxy measurements taken on\nsame\/equivalent depth samples, to ensure similar bioturba-\ntion effects etc. for all proxies in the core. The method works\nbest if sampling resolution is better than\u0001200 years ensuring\naccurate placement of events and hence dating accuracy.\nReferences\nBard, E.
