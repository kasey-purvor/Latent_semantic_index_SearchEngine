Temperature measurements from the ALOMAR\nWeber Na lidar together with cosmic radio noise absorption\nmeasurements from IRIS and particle measurements from\nNOAA 15, 16 and 17 are used to study effects of geomag-\nnetic activity on the polar winter upper-mesospheric temper-\nature. On 21\u201322 January 2005 we have 14 h of continuous\ntemperature measurement with the Na lidar coinciding with\nstrong geomagnetic activity in the declining phase of one of\nthe hardest and most energetic Solar Proton Event (SPE) of\nsolar cycle 23. According to measurements by the imaging\nriometer IRIS in northern Finland, the temperature measure-\nments coincide with two periods of increased cosmic radio\nnoise absorption. Particle measurements from the three satel-\nlites, NOAA 15, 16 and 17 that pass through and near our\nregion of interest confirm that the absorption events are prob-\nably due to particle precipitation and not due to changes in\ne.g. the electron recombination coefficient.\nThe measured temperature variation at 85 and 90 km is\ndominated by a 7.6-h wave with downward phase propaga-\ntion and a vertical wavelength of approximately 10 km. As-\nsuming that the wave is due to a lower altitude source inde-\npendent of the particle precipitation, we do not find any tem-\nperature modification that seems to be related to the absorp-\ntion events. The average temperature is larger than expected\nabove 90 km based on MSIS and the monthly mean from\nfalling spheres, which could be due to particle precipitation\nand Joule heating prior to our measurement period.

A large number of parameters influence the en-\nergy balance. Electromagnetic radiation from the sun, par-\nticle precipitation, Joule heating, atmospheric waves, winds,\nturbulence, chemical reactions, infrared cooling, photoelec-\ntrons and heat conduction do all play an important part in\nthe cooling and heating processes. The energy balance gets\neven more complicated when considering their internal in-\nteractions, and that some of the processes are able to heat the\natmosphere as well as to cool it, depending on the specific\nconditions present (Offermann, 1985; Roble, 1995).\nDuring geomagnetic disturbances the atmosphere will ex-\nperience an energy increase from particle precipitation and\nJoule heating (e.g. Banks, 1977, 1979; Rees et al., 1983).\nAt the same time, the particle precipitation will influence the\ncomposition of the atmosphere through ionization, dissocia-\ntion, and excitation. Changing the gas composition will also\nchange the chemical heating rates, and the infrared cooling\nrates. The plasma flow, controlled by the electric field, will\ntogether with the new temperature gradients change the neu-\ntral winds, which in turn also modifies the temperatures and\ngas composition in the upper atmosphere. In particular, So-\nlar Proton Events (SPEs) are predicted to have a significant\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2516 H.

These studies are mostly\nbased on model calculations that use measurements of e.g.\nparticle fluxes and electric fields, and not actual temperature\nmeasurements. There is also a group of studies suggesting a\ntemperature enhancement associated with SPEs or other par-\nticle precipitation events partly based on observations of the\ndisappearance of noctilucent clouds and polar mesospheric\nsummer echoes during SPEs (Kubo et al., 2003; von Savi-\ngny et al., 2007), or observations of enhanced upward winds\nin the upper mesosphere or lower thermosphere (Peterherych\net al., 1985; Price and Jacka, 1991). Efforts to measure the\ntemperatures directly during SPEs have been made by e.g.\nZadorozhny et al. (1994). Based on rocket measurement they\nfound a temperature decrease from the stratopause up to ap-\nproximately 70 km. The Microwave Limb Sounder onboard\nthe Aura satellite detected a temperature increase at 85 km\naltitude coinciding with the January 2005 SPE (von Savigny\net al., 2007). Pancheva et al. (2007) found a significant tem-\nperature drop of approximately 25 K, detected by the meteor\nradar at Andenes at an altitude of about 90 km during one of\nthe October 2003 SPEs. The contradictory results in the up-\nper mesosphere may be due to the complexity of the energy\nbudget. Additionally, there are very few studies where both\nthe upper mesospheric temperature and the local particle pre-\ncipitation are observed.\nOn 16 January 2005 a series of Solar Proton Events (SPEs)\nbegan. A SPE starts as emission of high energy charged par-\nticles on the surface of the sun associated with solar flares\nand coronal mass ejections (CME). Energetic particles are\nalso generated in the interplanetary medium by interactions\nwith shocks. The particle flux is dominated by protons, ac-\ncompanied by heavier ions and electrons. Guided by the in-\nterplanetary and Earth\u2019s magnetic field, the energetic parti-\ncles precipitate their energy in both the upper and middle\natmosphere in the polar cap and the auroral zone. The X7\nflare and CME on 20 January marked the start of the so far\nhardest and most energetic SPE of Cycle 23. The >10 MeV\nproton flux peaked on 20 January UTC and showed an en-\nhanced level until about 18:00 UT 22 January. Additionally,\nthe declining phase of the SPE (21\u201322 January) is accompa-\nnied by an intense geomagnetic storm and strong substorm\nactivity. The 3-hourly Kp index was 7 and 8 late on 21 Jan-\nuary accompanied by strong deflection in both the Dst and\nAE index as shown in Fig. 1.\nFrom about 18:00 UT on 21 January until 07:00 UT on 22\nJanuary 2005 we measured upper-mesospheric temperatures\nabove And\u00f8ya in Norway using the ALOMAR Weber Na li-\ndar. We monitored the particle precipitation near And\u00f8ya by\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2515\u20132529, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/\nH.

These measurements give us a valu-\nable opportunity to search for possible temperature effects\ncaused by particle precipitation during a relatively strong ge-\nomagnetic event. Since very few studies consider simulta-\nneous observations of both upper mesospheric temperature\nand local particle precipitation, the following analysis is im-\nportant for our understanding of the energy budget in this re-\ngion. The instrumentation used is presented in Sect. 2, while\nthe measurements and associated discussion are presented in\nSect. 3. In Sect. 4 we will evaluate possible theories explain-\ning our results.\n2 The instrumentation\n2.1 The ALOMAR Weber Na lidar\nThe ALOMAR Weber Na lidar is a sodium (Na) fluorescence\nlidar (She et al., 2002; Vance et al., 1998; Arnold and She,\n2003). This instrument is used to determine the Na density\nprofiles, as well as atmospheric temperature and wind from\nabout 80 to 100 km by remote spectroscopy. The instrument\nis part of the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmo-\nsphere Research (ALOMAR), located at And\u00f8ya in Norway\n(69.2\u25e6 N, 16.0\u25e6 E).\nThe lidar system emits light at three known frequencies\nin sequential order. A small fraction of the emitted light is\nresonantly scattered by atmospheric Na atoms, which exist in\nthe mesopause region due to meteor ablation. The measured\nintensities are fitted to the theoretical shape of the spectrum\nof the D2a transition of the Na atom, which depends on the\natmospheric temperature (Doppler broadening) and the line-\nof-sight wind (Doppler shift). The Na density is proportional\nto the ratio of the observed count rates in the Na layer and\nthe Rayleigh reflected signal from the stratosphere (Fricke\nand von Zahn, 1985; Heinrich et al., 2005).\n2.2 IRIS\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) in\nKilpisjarvi in northern Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E) mea-\nsures ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio noise at\n38.2 MHz in 49 beams (Browne et al., 1995). The projection\nof these beams at 90 km spans the area of 67.8\u25e6\u201370.2\u25e6 N, and\n17.8\u25e6\u201323.8\u25e6 E, as seen in Fig. 2. None of the riometer beams\noverlaps with the ALOMAR Weber Na lidar, but beam 8,\n15 and 22 might be representative for the absorption above\nAnd\u00f8ya.\nCosmic radio noise is of galactic origin and is a known\nquantity (varying with e.g. location and time of day and\nyear), so that any deviation in the expected signal observed\non the ground is due to changes in the ionospheric absorp-\ntion. There are several sources causing ionization in the D-\nFig. 2. The beam projection for the 49 beams of IRIS at 90 km\n(Map: S. Marple, Lancaster University). None of the riometer\nbeams overlap with the ALOMAR Weber Na lidar (marked as a red\ndot), but beam 8, 15 and 22 (coloured red) might be representative\nfor the absorption above And\u00f8ya.\nregion, such as solar electromagnetic emissions, solar pro-\ntons and energetic electrons. The ionospheric effects of\nSPE were already identified in the 1950s, after a large so-\nlar flare was followed by radio communication blackout due\nto the enhancement of electron densities, thus these events\nwere named polar cap absorption (PCA) in the field of radio\nphysics.\nThere have been several attempts to derive an empirical\nrelationship between the cosmic radio noise absorption and\nthe precipitating flux of the solar protons (e.g. Kavanagh et\nal., 2004; Hargreaves, 2005; Rodger et al., 2006). One chal-\nlenge is the electron recombination coefficient and its sensi-\ntivity to the solar zenith angle. During night-time the free\nelectrons are removed at the lower altitudes by attachment to\noxygen. Hargreaves (2005) showed that the altitudes from\nabout 45\u201365 km typically account for 80% of the total day-\ntime absorption. At night most of the absorption takes place\nin the interval from 75\u201385 km. The criterion for \u201cnight\u201d is\nmet when the sun is more than 10\u25e6 below the horizon.\nAssuming a fixed electron recombination coefficient for\nthe different heights during night-time conditions, the varia-\ntions in the riometer signal observed on the ground are due to\nvariation in the particle precipitation flux. The energy spec-\ntrum of the precipitating energetic particles varies from one\nevent to another, as well as during an event. Therefore we\ncannot expect to find a precise relationship between the ra-\ndio absorption at different heights and the energy deposited\nat a certain height, but neither are the absorption variations\nentirely random. We will use the ground based night-time\nmeasurement performed by IRIS as a proxy for the energy\ndeposited by precipitating particles in the upper-mesosphere\nnear And\u00f8ya. We will discuss this assumption further in\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 2515\u20132529, 2008\n2518 H. Nesse Tyss\u00f8y et al.: Upper-mesospheric temperatures\nFig. 3.

In Jan-\nuary 2005 three satellites, NOAA 15, 16 and 17 were orbiting\nthe Earth in a polar, sun-synchronous at 850 km altitude with\na period of approximately 100 min. Each satellite carries\ntwo types of particle sensors, Total Energy Detector (TED)\nand Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED)\n(Evans and Greer, 2000).\nTED monitors electron and proton fluxes with energies in\nthe range between 50 and 20 000 eV, divided into 16 energy\nintervals. Four detectors (two electron and two proton detec-\ntors) are mounted in two groups, where one group is viewing\nradially outward from the Earth and the other group viewing\nat 30\u25e6. Every group has a proton detector and an electron\ndetector. At auroral altitudes the first group, looks approxi-\nmately along the field line and we refer to it as the vertical\ndetector. We will use the electron fluxes measured in the\nenergy intervals 2116\u20133075 eV, and 6503\u20139467 eV from the\nvertical detector.\nMEPED provides directional measurement of energetic\nparticles. The instrument holds four directional solid-state\ndetectors, pointing 9\u25e6 and 89\u25e6 to the local vertical. We refer\nto these detectors as the vertical and the horizontal detector,\nrespectively. At high latitudes the vertical detector measures\nparticles in the loss cone, while the horizontal detector mea-\nsures particles that mirror or are close to mirroring at satellite\naltitude. The detectors have a \u00b115\u25e6 (total 30\u25e6) field of view.\nThe protons are measured in six energy ranges: 30\u201380, 80\u2013\n250, 250\u2013800, 800\u20132500, 2500\u20136900 and >6900 keV. The\nelectrons are measured in three energy channels: >30, >100,\nand >300 keV.\n3 Observations\nOn the 16 January a series of SPEs began causing periods of\nstrong particle precipitation and geomagnetic disturbances as\nseen in the geomagnetic indicies in Fig. 1. In the declining\nphase of the so far hardest and most energetic SPE of So-\nlar Clycle 23, the AE index reveals strong substorm activ-\nity. In particular, a large geomagnetic disturbance occurred\nat 21\u201322 January starting around 15:00\u201319:00 UT, reaching\nAE values of 2000 nT and Kp of 7\u20138. In this period we have\n14 h of continuous nighttime temperature measurement with\nthe Na lidar. In this period we also have continuous absorp-\ntion measurement from IRIS. The three satellites, NOAA 15,\n16, and 17, passes through or near our region of interest. The\nfirst part of this section will be devoted to the observations\nconcerning the particle precipitation, while the second part\nfocuses on its possible influence on the temperature.\n3.1 Absorption and particle measurements\nFigure 3 shows the cosmic radio noise absorption measured\nby IRIS in beam 8, 15, and 22 from 16:00 UT 21 January to\n08:00 UT 22 January 2005. At about 15:30 UT an absorp-\ntion event starts. The three beams show more or less the\nsame values, which indicates that the particle precipitation is\nfairly uniform over a large area. The absorption decreases to\nquiet values around 21:00 UT and it remains quiet till about\n04:00 UT when a second absorption event starts. The absorp-\ntion values in the different riometer beams indicate, however,\nthat the precipitation has some localized variations. The so-\nlar elevation angle was more than 10\u25e6 below the horizon from\nthe beginning of this period until about 06:45 UT on the 22\nJanuary. Consequently the criterion for nighttime conditions\nis fulfilled for most of this period. Even so, we wish to in-\nvestigate if the changes in the absorption are actually due\nto changes in the particle precipitation and not an effect of\nchanges in the electron recombination coefficient.\nUsing particle measurements from the vertical detectors\non the TED and MEPED instruments onboard NOAA 15, 16,\nand 17, we can detect the precipitating particles in and near\nour region of interest at several points in time. We project\nthe particle measurement down to about 100 km, and sort the\nmeasurement in a geomagnetic grid of 4\u25e6 latitudes and 10\u25e6\nlongitudes. To increase our data in the geomagnetic box that\nencloses And\u00f8ya, we interpolate linearly between the mea-\nsurements from two of the satellites, e.g. NOAA 15 and 16,\nthat passes the same geomagnetic latitude east and west of\nAnd\u00f8ya close in time. Global patterns of precipitating par-\nticle fluxes based on the NOAA satellites using interpola-\ntion techniques have been generated before by e.g. Fang et\nal. (2007). However, considering the interpolation, the time\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2515\u20132529, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/\nH.

The red dashed lines show the cos-\nmic radio noise absorption measured by IRIS in beam 8, 15\nand 22. We find that both the absorption events are asso-\nciated with increased electron flux. Focusing on the energy\nchannel >30 keV, we find the strongest electron flux during\nthe second absorption event in the period 06:00\u201307:00 UT.\nThe maximum of the electron flux fits well with the maxi-\nmum in the absorption in this period. The first absorption\nevent is also associated with an increase in the precipitating\nelectron flux, but the electron flux is more than a factor 10\nless than the electron flux at 06:00\u201307:00 UT. In the energy\nchannels >100 keV and >300 keV we have the opposite re-\nlation between the two absorption event. The electron flux\nat these energies associated with the first absorption event is\nlarger than during the second absorption event. In fact, we do\nnot see any increase in precipitating electrons with energies\n>300 keV associated with the second absorption event.\nFigure 5 shows the proton flux in the energy channels 240\u2013\n800 keV, 800\u20132500 keV, and 2500\u20136900 keV. We find that\nthere are more protons associated with the first absorption\nevent compared to the second one in all the energy channels.\nThe maximum in the proton flux in the three channels seems\nto fit fairly well with the first absorption maximum. How-\never, we do not find increased proton fluxes coinciding with\nthe second absorption event.\nThe particle measurements by the MEPED detectors could\nalso indicate the hardness of the energy spectrum based\non the ratio between the particle fluxes in the different en-\nergy channels. In Fig. 6 we have estimated a differential\nelectron energy spectrum based on the electron flux in the\nvertical TED and MEPED detectors at two different times.\nThe first point in time is associated with the first absorption\nevent, while the other spectrum is based on observations dur-\ning the second absorption event. The electron fluxes mea-\nsured by the MEPED detector are integral fluxes. However,\nby combining the three channels, >30 keV, >100 keV, and\n>300 keV, we can derive the differential fluxes in the en-\nergy range 30\u2013100 keV and 100\u2013300 keV. In other words, by\ncombining these differential fluxes retrieved from MEPED\nfluxes and the fluxes measured in the two energy channels\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/ Ann.

We find a very hard en-\nergy spectrum associated with the first absorption event. As\nshown in Fig. 6 the characteristic energies are 4 and 132 keV.\nVertical incident electrons with the latter energy can pene-\ntrate the atmosphere down to almost 70 km.

The dashed line is the\nenergy deposited by electrons, the dotted line is the energy deposited by protons, and the solid line is the total energy deposited by both\nprotons and electrons.\nBaron, 1976; Vondrak and Robinson, 1985). MANGLE uses\nthe value of 35 eV for the energy expended by the primary\nprecipitation electrons for each ion-electron pair produced,\nwhich is in accordance with Rees (1989). The energy height\nprofile for proton is calculated based on the simple formula\npresented in M\u00e6hlum (1973):\ndE\ndz\n= \u2212236 \u00b7 E\u22120.78 (2)\nwhere the energy loss, dE\/dz, is given in units MeV cm2 g\u22121.\nWe assume that the precipitating protons are vertically inci-\ndent. Atmospheric densities are estimated using MSIS-E-90.\nOn 21 January 18:40 UT we find that the energy deposition\nrate has two local maxima, at 85 km and 105 km. The energy\ndeposition rate is dominated by protons, possibly solar pro-\ntons based on their initial energy. However, on 22 January\n06:43 UT we find a more typical energy deposition height\nprofile peaking at one height, dominated by electrons with\ninitial energies similar to auroral particles.\nAccording to Fig. 8 we find an energy deposition rate of\nabout 180 keV cm\u22123 s\u22121 at 95 km at 06:43 UT. Converted to\nSI units this corresponds to 2.88\u00d710\u22128 Jm\u22123 s\u22121.The energy\ntransfer to an individual neutral atmospheric particle per time\nat 95 km, 1E95 km\/1t , is approximately:\n1E95 km\n1t\n=2.88\u00d710\n\u22128 Jm\u22123 s\u22121\n0.22\u00d71020 m\u22123 \u22481.31\u00d710\n\u221227 Js\u22121 (3)\nwhere the number density at 95 km, 0.22\u00d71020 m\u22123, is\nfound using MSIS. According to Rees et al. (1983) about half\nof the energy, 1Etherm, results in local atmospheric heating,\nwhich gives rise to a heating rate of approximately:\n1T\n1t\n= 2\n5\n1Etherm\n1t \u00b7 k \u2248 2.00\u00d7 10\n\u22125 Ks\u22121 \u2248 0.07 Kh\u22121 (4)\nassuming that the atmosphere at 95 km is an ideal diatomic\ngas. k is the Boltzmann constant.\nIn summary, based on the particle fluxes retrieved from\nthe particle detectors on the NOAA satellites the first absorp-\ntion event observed by IRIS seem to be dominated by proton\nfluxes with initial energies similar to precipitating solar pro-\ntons. The second absorption event observed by IRIS is as-\nsociated with enhanced electron fluxes with energies similar\nto auroral electrons. Based on the electron and proton spec-\ntra from two selected periods in time we estimate the energy\ndeposition height profiles, and the resulting heating rate at\n95 km altitude.\n3.2 Temperature and absorption measurement\nOn 21\u201322 January 2005 we have 14 h of night time measure-\nments with the ALOMAR Weber Na lidar. Figure 9 shows\ncontour plots based on hourly averaged temperatures mea-\nsured in beam 1 and beam 2. Beam 1 points 20\u25e6 W of zenith,\nwhich corresponds to about 32 km (0.8\u25e6 longitude) at 90 km\naltitude. Beam 2 points 20\u25e6 E of zenith. The contour plots\nreveal a complex temperature structure in our height interval\nof interest. In particular, we see a wavelike perturbation with\na period of approximately 8 h and a vertical wavelength of\nabout 10 km. In the following we wish to analyze the gravity\nwave field in order to distinguish possible energetic particle\nprecipitation effects from gravity waves effect.\nIn Figs. 10 and 11 we have fitted a 7.6-h wave at 85, 90,\n95 and 100 km. The 7.6 (\u00b10.5) hour wave period is the most\nprominent period at 85 and 90 km in both beams (found by\ncalculating Lomb Normalized Periodogram, and performing\nleast squares fits of the data). At these altitudes it seems like\na 7.6-h wave, with approximately 20\u201325 K amplitude could\naccount for most of the temperature variations. At 95 and\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/ Ann.

The second absorption event is also as-\nsociated with temperatures less than the mean value of the\nresidual temperatures. At 95 km we do not see any obvi-\nous correlation between the temperature and the absorption\nevents, while at 100 km we find temperatures below average\nin the periods of increased absorption in both beams.\nAnother way to eliminate the dominant temperature varia-\ntions due to the 7.6-h wave could be to integrate the thermal\nenergy over the vertical wavelength of the wave, assuming\nthat the wave does not dissipate energy. Using the thermal\nenergy instead of the temperature itself will average out the\nwave effect within the height interval. This will also reduce\npossible temperature effects from other possible waves with\nshorter vertical wavelengths than the 7.6-h wave. As men-\ntioned above, we find the vertical wavelength of the 7.6-h\nwave to be about 10 km. Figure 12 shows the height in-\ntegrated energy at two height intervals, 80\u201390 km, and 90\u2013\n100 km, respectively. The atmospheric densities are found\nusing MSIS-E-90. Since a wave also will cause variation in\nthe background density, we have included an uncertainty of\n3% in the density in addition to the temperature uncertain-\nties. In the height interval 80\u201390 km it seems like the height\nintegrated energy experiences a general decrease during our\n14 h of observations. However, we do not find any correla-\ntion between the absorption events and the height integrated\nenergies in either of the two beams. The same conclusion\napplies to the height interval 90\u2013100 km.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Expected temperature changes\nJoule heating caused by ionospheric current systems and par-\nticle precipitation are prominent energy sources during geo-\nmagnetic disturbances. These heating sources can be highly\nlocalized in space and time. Peterherych et al. (1985) and\nPrice and Jacka (1991) suggested that winds of several tens\nof m\/s at heights less than 110 km altitude could be triggered\nby particle heating and\/or Joule heating. However, we do not\nfind evidence of any immediate heating associated with en-\nergetic particle precipitation that could initiate vertical winds\nof this size. Our results are more in line with e.g. Offermann\n(1985). Offermann (1985) found daily averaged particle pre-\ncipitation heating rates of approximately 0.1 K\/h (2.5 K\/d) at\n90 km during disturbed geomagnetic conditions, about the\nsame size as we found at 95 km coinciding with the absorp-\ntion events. The ionization caused by particle precipitation\nincreases the Pedersen conductivity, which is proportional\nto the Joule heating. Banks (1979) and Roble et al. (1987)\nshowed that locally mesospheric Joule heating at 90 km alti-\ntude could be substantial (1\u201312 K\/d) for certain large SPEs.\nThese heating rates are comparable to solar, infrared and\nchemical heating rates in the mesopause region (Berger and\nvon Zahn, 1999). An increase in Joule and particle heat-\ning might be responsible for the observed heating of \u223c2 K\/d\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2515\u20132529, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/\nH.

However, von Savigny et al. (2007) also covered the\nmain phase of the January 2005 SPEs, and we might not ex-\npect to find similar heating rates in the declining phase of\nthese events where our observations were done.\nThe particle precipitation does not only deposit energy, but\nalso modifies the gas composition through ionization, disso-\nciation and excitation. In particular, there has been found a\nstrong correlation between the production of odd nitrogen,\nNOx and odd hydrogen HOx species and energetic particle\nprecipitation (e.g. Crutzen et al., 1975; Swider and Kenesha,\n1973; Jackman et al., 1980; Solomon et al., 1981; S\u00e6tre et\nal., 2004). These minor constituents reduce the ozone con-\ncentration through catalytic processes. Ozone is an important\nheating source in the mesopause region both as an absorber\nof solar radiation and through chemical reactions (Mlynczak\nand Solomon, 1993; Berger and von Zahn, 1999). There-\nfore any decrease in ozone ultimately results in less heating,\nin particular in the sunlit atmosphere, explaining the cooling\nbelow 80 km altitude associated with the October 1989 SPEs\nobserved by Zadorozhny et al. (1994).\nPancheva et al. (2007) found a significant temperature\ndrop of \u223c25 K detected at \u223c90 km altitude by the meteor\nradar at And\u00f8ya. The temperature decrease was in line\nwith the enhancement of the proton fluxes associated with\nthe SPEs and geomagnetic storms in late October 2003.\nSeppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al. (2004) showed significant ozone depletion\nin the Northern Hemisphere polar mesosphere, as seen by\nGOMOS\/Envisat (Global Ozone Monitoring by Occulta-\ntion of Stars\/Environmental satellite) caused by the SPEs in\nOctober\u2013November 2003. The ozone depletion could con-\ntribute to a cooling in this region. In contrast to Pancheva et\nal. (2007) we did not find a cooling effect in the upper meso-\nsphere associated with the energetic particle precipitation.\nOn the other hand, this could be due to the lack of sunlight\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/ Ann.

The blue dashed line shows the temperature climatology\nfound by Lu\u00a8bken and von Zahn (1991) based on falling spheres\nabove And\u00f8ya.\nin the period we were measuring. Additionally, Pancheva et\nal. (2007) suggested that the heating via precipitating pro-\ntons in the middle atmosphere could cause upwelling of the\nair cooling the upper mesospheric air adiabatically. As men-\ntioned above, we did not find evidence for a heating that\ncould be responsible for a potential upwelling at any of the\nobserved heights. However, we cannot exclude the possibil-\nity of a potential heating or cooling effect occurring in the\nmain phase of the January 2005 SPEs.\nA cooling in the middle mesosphere as observed by\nZadorozhny et al. (1994), could initiate a small downwelling.\nModel calculation by Jackman et al. (2007) suggested down-\nward vertical winds of the order of mm\/s. Even though\nthe wind was relatively small it could cause an increased\ndownward transport enhancing the atomic oxygen abun-\ndance. More atomic oxygen leads to more O-CO2 collisions,\nwhich results in more excited CO2, and an enhanced infrared\ncooling rate (Jackman et al., 2007). The vertical transport\ncould also change the CO2 abundance, as the CO2 concen-\ntration is not a constant fraction of the total atmospheric gas\nabove \u223c65 km. However, a larger atomic oxygen concentra-\ntion also strengthens the exothermic reaction O-HOx and in\nthat manner the chemical heating rate. The downward verti-\ncal wind could also cause adiabatic heating (Jackman et al.,\n2007).\nAll in all, energetic particles can cause both heating and\ncooling depending on which altitude we focus on and the\nspecific conditions present. A sensitivity analysis made by\nJackman et al. (2007) shows that the temperature modifica-\ntion is seasonally dependent. In the sunlit hemisphere, we\nmight expect a heating at altitudes above 80 km and a cooling\nbelow 80 km. However, they found little temperature modi-\nfication in the winter hemisphere. In other words, we might\nnot expect to see any temperature changes in the Northern\nHemisphere during the January 2005 SPEs. The temperature\nincrease reported by von Savigny et al. (2007) was observed\nin the Southern Hemisphere during this event. In addition,\nconsidering the size of the heating and cooling rates asso-\nciated with SPEs and other energetic particle precipitation\nevents, the discrimination of solar influences and influences\nby e.g. tidal and gravity waves, remains an almost impossible\nchallenge. Analysing the temperature field on 21 and 22 Jan-\nuary 2005, we found a possible wave field with a period of\n7.6 h and amplitude of 20\u201325 K at 90 km. A potential heat-\ning of 10 K\/d would more or less be impossible to extract in\na case study like ours.\n4.2 Time constants\nWhen looking for potential temperature changes associated\nwith energetic particle precipitation we should also consider\nthe time constants involved. Since radiative relaxation times\nin the upper mesosphere are of the orders of several days\n(Barabash et al., 2004) a potential temperature modification\nis expected to be rather stable and last several days after\nthe event. As mentioned, the solar proton events in Jan-\nuary 2005 started already on 16 January, which means that\nthe temperature observed on 21 and 22 January could be in-\nfluenced by days of increased particle precipitation and not\njust the precipitation coinciding with our measurement pe-\nriod. In Fig. 13 we have plotted the average temperature\nprofiles based on our 14 h of measurements, the MSIS tem-\nperature profile, and the monthly mean based on the clima-\ntology found from falling spheres on And\u00f8ya (Lu\u00a8bken and\nvon Zahn, 1991). We find that above 90 km our average\ntemperature is larger than both the MSIS and the monthly\nmean falling sphere predictions. The deviation between the\nmeasured and predicted profiles increases with height, as we\nalso would expect if the higher temperatures were due to e.g.\nJoule heating. However, we should interpret the comparison\nbetween the profiles with care because of the existence of a\ndiurnal tidal wave or other long period waves, as our average\ntemperature profile is only based on 14 h.\n4.3 Long period waves\nWhen looking for possible temperature effects associated\nwith the absorption events in Sect. 3.2 we identified a wave\nperiod of approximately 8 h at 85 and 90 km, which we pre-\nsumed was caused by tidal and gravity waves independent\nof the particle precipitation events. However, Rietveld et\nal. (1992) and Ro\u00a8ttger (1994) have reported of similar wave-\nlike structures in wind observations made by the EISCAT\nVHF radar during SPEs. They inferred a vertical wavelength\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2515\u20132529, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2515\/2008\/\nH. Nesse Tyss\u00f8y et al.: Upper-mesospheric temperatures 2527\nof about 10 km and large amplitudes due to a wave with\ndownward phase progression and 8\u201310 h period at altitudes\nof 60\u201380 km during three different SPEs in 1989 and 1990.\nRo\u00a8ttger (1994) points out that this period range, the large am-\nplitude and the rather short vertical wavelength of 10 km is\nunlikely to be caused by the tidal variations below 75 km at\nhigh latitudes. They suggest that the waves could be excited\nby the thermodynamical and chemical effects created by so-\nlar protons precipitating the middle atmosphere.\nIn particular, Ro\u00a8ttger (1994) focuses on the periodicity of\nthe potential change in heating rates during SPEs. For in-\nstance there is strong dependence of the electron density on\nthe solar zenith angle due to the formation of negative ions in\ndarkness (Collis and Rietveld, 1990). This results in a diur-\nnal and seasonal variation of the electron density below this\naltitude. The magnetospheric electric field also has a diurnal\nvariation. The time scale of these changes is often consis-\ntent with a substantial 6\u201310 h spectral component in the elec-\ntric field variations Ro\u00a8ttger (1994). The combined effect of\nthe varying electron density and electric field could perhaps\ncause noticeable variation in the Joule heating. Furthermore,\nthe temporal variation in the SPEs itself often show quasi-\nperiodicities of several hours to days, and is usually charac-\nterized by impulsive increases. Additionally, there could also\nbe a change in the heating rates due to the production of NOx\nand HOy, and the subsequent destruction of ozone.\n5 Summary and future work\nOn 16 January 2005 began a series of SPEs, which ended\nwith the so far hardest and most energetic SPE of Solar Cy-\ncle 23 on 20\u201322 January. In the declining phase of the SPE\non 21\u201322 January 2005 coinciding with a large geomagnetic\nstorm we have 14 h of continuous temperature measurement\nwith the ALOMAR Na lidar, which according to the IRIS\nmeasurements includes 2 absorption events. Particle mea-\nsurements from the three satellites, NOAA 15, 16 and 17\nthat pass through or near our region of interest confirms that\nthe absorption events are probably due to particle precipita-\ntion and not due to changes in the electron recombination\ncoefficient. This gave us an opportunity to search for possi-\nble temperature effects caused by local particle precipitation\nduring a relatively strong geomagnetic event.\nThe temperature variations at 85 and 90 km is dominated\nby a 7.6 h downward propagating wave with vertical wave-\nlength of approximately 10 km. Assuming that the wave is\ndue to tidal or gravity waves independent of the particle pre-\ncipitation, we do not find any temperature modification that\nseems to be related to the absorption events. However, a po-\ntential temperature modification could be too small to iso-\nlate in a system of tides and gravity waves in a single case\nstudy. Above 90 km the measured average temperature is\nlarger than predicted from both MSIS and the monthly mean\nclimatology based on falling spheres, which could be due to\nenergy deposited by particle precipitation and Joule heating\nprior to our measurement period. There is also a possibility\nthat the identified wave phenomenon is an effect of the SPEs\nitself. Rietveld et al. (1992) and Ro\u00a8ttger (1994) have reported\nof similar wavelike structures in wind observations made by\nthe EISCAT VHF radar during SPEs, and found it conceiv-\nable that the wave could be exited by the effects of energetic\nparticles precipitating the mesosphere.\nConsidering the size of the calculated heating rate we find\nit likely to be no immediate significant temperature effects\nof the particle precipitation in the upper mesosphere above\nAnd\u00f8ya on the 21\u201322 January 2005. If any measurable tem-\nperature effects take place, we find it most likely to be heat-\ning caused by particle precipitation over a longer time period\nprior to our measurement period. A wave with downward\nphase propagation would have to be triggered by a lower al-\ntitude source. Due to higher densities at lower altitudes the\nparticle energy input would have to be significantly larger\nthan measured in our case. However, taking into consid-\neration that this paper only addresses one case and the dif-\nferent results reported on energetic particle precipitation and\ntemperatures in the upper mesosphere, we choose to be pru-\ndent in making a general conclusion. Instead, we point out\nthe need for future work and studies of simultaneous mea-\nsurements of both the upper mesospheric temperatures and\nlocal energetic particle precipitation. First of all, we wish\nto address a similar study using the ALOMAR Na lidar in\nsummer time, since earlier studies have shown a larger tem-\nperature effect due to strong particle precipitation in sunlit\nareas. Recent improvements of the lidar system have sig-\nnificantly improved our daylight measurements making this\na strong possibility in the future. Independently of season,\nwe should look for wave structures similar to the downward\npropagating wave of\u223c8 h and short vertical wavelength both\nin geomagnetically quiet and disturbed periods using both\nlidar and other available instruments. An updated lidar cli-\nmatology could also be useful when comparing temperature\nmeasurements retrieved in regions influenced by significant\nparticle precipitation.\nAcknowledgements.
