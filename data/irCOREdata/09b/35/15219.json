INTRODUCTION\nSolution-processable materials are attractive candidates\nfor photovoltaic \u0001PV\u0002 devices because of their potential low\ncost. However, such materials typically have a high exciton\nbinding energy and require films of thickness \u0005100 nm to\nefficiently absorb light. Consequently, to have viable charge\ngeneration one must use an intimately mixed blend of donor\nand acceptor materials, the heterojunctions between which\ndrive exciton dissociation.1,2 Such bulk heterojunctions\n\u0001BHJs\u0002 are easily realized by blending the donor and accep-\ntor materials in solution prior to deposition. Unfortunately,\nthe constraints placed on the morphology by charge genera-\ntion, which is favored by a fine phase separation, are counter\nto those of charge transport, which is favored by a coarse\nphase separation. Consequently, balancing the competing de-\nmands upon the morphology is critical to optimizing PVs.\nMany methods exist to alter the morphology of a BHJ, in-\ncluding annealing,3 and the choice of solvent4 or cosolvent.5\nHowever, while these techniques broadly control the domain\nsize, crystallinity, or packing of the components of the BHJ,\nthese characteristics of the blend morphology are not uni-\nform throughout the film. Indeed, studies of the structure\nof polymer-polymer,3,6,7 polymer-fullerene,8\u201310 and polymer-\nnanocrystal11 blends show hierarchies of phase separation\nand vertical variations in the blend morphology. How this\nlocal variation in blend morphology affects the local mobility\nof carriers, and in particular the PV performance, is largely\nunknown. This may be a serious deficiency in our knowl-\nedge, especially since the limited existing studies point to\nsignificant changes in charge transport when some aspects of\nmorphology are changed.12\u201316 In particular, Frost et al.12\nshowed that networks of self-repelling and self-attracting\npolymers show orders of magnitude difference in mobility\nand substantially different dispersive character.\nIn this paper we use a Monte Carlo model to reveal the\ndependence of mobility upon domain size, blend composi-\ntion, and energetic disorder. It is predicted that local changes\nin the characteristics of blend morphology seen in high-\nperformance PV devices can lead to local changes in the\nmobility by more than an order of magnitude. The effect of\nnonuniform mobility upon space-charge-limited \u0001SCL\u0002 diode\nand PV device performance is then investigated using a drift-\ndiffusion model. The current passing through SCL diodes is\nfound to be sensitive not only to the local mobility varia-\ntions, but also to where within the device the variations oc-\ncur. This shows that caution should be exercised when deriv-\ning SCL mobility from devices with nonuniform blend\nmorphology. PV device performance is also shown to be\nsignificantly affected by nonuniform mobility, indicating that\ngood morphology control is vital if one is not to lose poten-\ntial performance. Furthermore it is shown that models, which\nassume the blend to be a homogeneous effective medium, are\nnot capable of reproducing well the performance of a PV\ndevice with nonuniform mobility. We conclude that it is im-\nportant to experimentally characterize and control the blend\nmorphology throughout the film and to develop models that\ncan take into account the local variations in mobility, which\nare a consequence of nonuniform blend morphology.\nII. THE EFFECT OF MORPHOLOGY UPON LOCAL\nMOBILITY\nFirst, we shall examine the effect of morphology upon\nmobility using a Monte Carlo model. Here we represent the\nmorphology as a regular 1 nm Cartesian lattice comprising\ndonor and acceptor sites extending 70 nm in each direction.\nInitially, the sites are chosen at random to be either donor or\nacceptor in accordance with the ratio of the acceptor volumea\u0002Electronic mail: cg378@cam.ac.uk.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 105, 094510 \u00012009\u0002\n0021-8979\/2009\/105\u00029\u0001\/094510\/6\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics105, 094510-1\nDownloaded 09 Mar 2011 to 129.234.252.67.

Thereafter, the simulated annealing ap-\nproach of Peumans et al.17 is used to coarsen blend as re-\nquired. In summary, this technique involves choosing a pair\nof neighboring sites at random and probabilistically admit-\nting a swap based on the energy change of the system.14,15,17\nNote that since cyclic boundary conditions are allowed for\ntransport \u0001see later\u0002, pairwise swaps over matching faces of\nthe morphology are also allowed. Phase separation is encour-\naged by choosing the interfacial energies of the acceptor\n\u0001EDD\u0002, acceptor \u0001EAA\u0002, and heterojunction \u0001EAD\u0002 such that\n2EAD=EAA=EDD. Boltzmann factors are included to satisfy\ndetailed balance. During the succession of annealing steps,\nthe domain size of the minority component is calculated\nfrom\nd =\n6\u0002V\nA\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere A is the interfacial area, V is the total blend volume,\nand \u0002 is the volume fraction of the minority component \u0001i.e.,\n\u0002=\u0001 when \u0001\u00030.5, \u0002= \u00011\u2212\u0001\u0002 when \u0001\u00040.5\u0002. Note that we\ncreate at least 50 morphologies, which share the same char-\nacteristics \u0001d and \u0001\u0002 to ensure that we are sampling the av-\nerage behavior for a particular type of morphology. Thereaf-\nter, this set of morphologies is used in a Monte Carlo model\nto predict mobility in a manner similar to that reported\npreviously.14,16 In summary, each site is assigned a Gaussian\ndistributed energetic disorder of standard deviation \u0005 prior to\neach simulation, and then an electron is placed on an accep-\ntor site at random. The rate of hopping between the current\nsite \u0001i\u0002 and a nearest neighbor site \u0001j\u0002 is calculated using a\nMarcus rate expression,\nRi\u2192j = \u0006hop exp\u0006\u2212 \u0001Ej \u2212 Ei + Er\u000224ErkBT \u0007 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere Ei and Ej are the energies of the sites i and j, respec-\ntively, and Er is half the polaron relaxation energy. The en-\nergies of the sites include energetic disorder and the applied\nelectric field F=105 V \/cm in all cases. The parameters used\nin Eq. \u00012\u0002 are chosen to give a low-field mobility of\n10\u22124 cm2 \/Vs, and are shown in Table I. Hops are only al-\nlowed between acceptor sites. Hop times are generated from\n\u0007i\u2192j =\u2212ln\u0001X\u0002 \/Ri\u2192j, where X is a random number between 0\nand 1, and the process with the shortest wait time is chosen\nas the behavior for the carrier. The mobility is calculated\nfrom \b=x \/Ft, where x is the distance traveled downfield in\ntime t. Since carriers are injected at random points within the\nlattice, their initial energy distribution matches the density of\nstates rather than the equilibrium energy distribution,18 and\nconsequently their mobility is transiently enhanced. Since\ncarriers are expected to thermalize rapidly within the density\nof states, the experimentally relevant variable is the equilib-\nrium mobility. Hence, we measure mobility as a function of\ntime and only record the time-independent mobility corre-\nsponding to equilibrated carriers. Note that we are examining\nlow charge densities typically found in time-of-flight experi-\nments and PV devices under normal operating conditions.\nThe process is then repeated with different conformations of\nenergetic disorder and morphology \u0001all with the same d and\n\u0001\u0002 to ensure accurate sampling of average behavior.\nFigure 1 shows the ratio of the mobility of electrons in\nthe blend, \bblend, to that in the bulk, \bbulk, for 4 nm\u0003d\n\u000312 nm, 0\u0003\u0005\u0003125 meV, and 0.2\u0003\u0001\u00030.8. All of the\ncurves show the same general character, with \bblend \/\bbulk\ndropping as \u0001 reduces, simply as a consequence of there\nbeing fewer acceptor pathways for the electrons through the\nmorphology. Figure 1 shows that \bblend drops precipitously\nwhen \u0001 reduces below 0.25; indeed, for all cases examined\n\bblend is one order of magnitude less than \bbulk when \u0001\n=0.25.\nDomain size and energetic disorder are also shown to\nhave a significant effect upon \bblend. Note that it is the do-\nmain size of the minority component that defines each mor-\nphology curve on Fig. 1. Hence, when \u0001\t0.5, electrons are\ntraveling through a network of domains of size d, and when\n\u0001\u00040.5, electrons are traveling around a network of domains\nof size d. First considering \u0001\t0.5, Fig. 1 shows that carrier\nmobility is improved when the domain size of the transport-\ning component is increased, as would be expected.12 When\n\u0001\u00040.5, Fig. 1 shows that carrier mobility is reduced when\nthe domain size of the nontransporting component is re-\nduced. Reducing the domain size when \u0001\u00040.5 implies that\nthe nontransporting component is better dispersed through\nthe transporting component. This in turn impedes transport\nmore effectively and so the mobility is reduced. Interestingly,\nincreasing the degree of energetic disorder is shown to re-\nduce \bblend \/\bbulk for a given morphology, i.e., the energetic\ndisorder has a larger effect on the mobility in the blend than\nit does in the bulk. Increasing the degree of energetic disor-\nder naturally creates pathways where transport is, or is not,\nenergetically favored, with the former being termed\nTABLE I.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nfilaments.19 In essence, filaments are an energetic landscape\nthrough which carriers have to negotiate in much the same\nway that the BHJ is a physical landscape for carriers to ne-\ngotiate. For efficient transport one would want these two\nnetworks to be coincident, however, in this model, the posi-\ntion of the filaments bears no relation to the physical mor-\nphology and so the mobility is reduced. Since guiding along\nfilaments improves as \u0005 \/kBT increases, \bblend \/\bbulk reduces\nas the degree of energetic disorder increases for a given mor-\nphology.\nHence we have shown that local blend morphology can\ncause orders of magnitude reduction in the mobility when\n\u0001\t0.25. It is important to realize at this point that the blend\nmorphologies in regions of some PV devices access this re-\ngime. Indeed, even high-performance polymer:polymer PVs\nhave been shown to have strata with \u0001=0.15,3 which accord-\ning to Fig. 1, would give many orders of magnitude reduc-\ntion in the local mobility. We now use a drift-diffusion model\nto give some insight into how nonuniform blend morphol-\nogy, and the mobility variations it causes, affects device per-\nformance.\nIII. MOBILITY VARIATIONS IN SCL DIODES\nAs a first step, we examine the effect of nonuniform\nmobility upon SCL diodes. This is important since current-\nvoltage measurements on SCL diodes are often used to char-\nacterize the mobility of carriers in a blend, and so help inter-\npret PV performance.20,21 Here we consider devices with a\nlayer in which the electron mobility is one order of magni-\ntude lower than in the rest of the device \u0001in which \be\n=10\u221210 m2 \/V s\u0002. For simplicity we ignore the dependence of\nthe mobility on field and carrier density, which is discussed\nin detail in Ref. 22. Note that one order of magnitude varia-\ntion in mobility is well within the variation in mobility ex-\npected in some real devices. Two types of devices are con-\nsidered: Case I, in which the low-mobility region is adjacent\nto the cathode and Case II, in which the low-mobility region\nis adjacent to the anode. The thickness of the low-mobility\nlayer z is allowed to vary from zero to the device thickness\nL\u0001=70 nm\u0002.\nThe current-voltage characteristics of single-carrier de-\nvices are predicted by self-consistently solving the Poisson\nand drift-diffusion equations,20 while suppressing hole injec-\ntion. Here we assume both contacts are electron-injecting\n\u0001Ohmic\u0002, although we note that the behavior shown does not\nchange if the anode is assumed to be noninjecting and a\nperfectly absorbing boundary. The parameters used in this\nsimulation are given in Table II. In both cases reducing the\nmobility reduces the current as expected. Our results are very\nsimilar to those of Crone et al.,23 who examined the conse-\nquence of a Case I type structure for light-emitting diodes. In\nthe context of PV devices, SCL diodes are important because\nthey are often used to derive mobilities for carriers within\nblend morphologies. Hence, we now interpret the resultant\ncurrent-voltage curves using a model, which assumes a uni-\nform blend morphology, as in Refs. 20 and 21, to determine\nthe effective electron mobility \be,eff for the device with a\nnonuniform blend morphology. The results shown in Fig.\n2\u0001a\u0002 indicate that the insertion of a layer with an electron\nmobility that is one order of magnitude lower than in the rest\nof the device is detrimental to the transport through the\nwhole of the device. For Case I, just 10 nm is sufficient to\nreduce \be,eff by a factor of four, whereas the implications for\nCase II are less dramatic because the electron concentration\nis greatest adjacent to the cathode. Clearly the position of the\nlow mobility layer is important in determining the current in\na SCL diode, and in turn the effective mobility. The mobility\none derives from a nonuniform device is therefore not a good\nindicator of charge transport processes. However, it would be\npreferable if one did not have to use a drift-diffusion model,\nwhich incorporates nonuniform mobility to interpret data\nfrom nonuniform devices. Consequently, we have rederived\nthe Mott\u2013Gurney law to determine the effective mobility for\na device with nonuniform mobility \u0001for full derivation see\nAppendix\u0002. By setting the mobility to be \b1 over the range 0\nto z and \b2 elsewhere, we find the effective mobility to be\n\beff = \b 1\t\b1\u000632\t zL \u2212 12\n zL\u000b3\/2\u0007 + 1\t\b2\n1 \u2212 zL\u000b3\/2\f\u22122.\n\u00013\u0002\nThe predictions of Eq. \u00013\u0002 for Case I and Case II are shown\nin Fig. 2. It can be seen that Eq. \u00013\u0002 underestimates the ef-\nfective mobility for both Cases I and II. Hence, even when\nTABLE II. Parameters used in the drift-diffusion simulations.

In Fig. 3 we show the predictions of the\ncarrier density by the drift-diffusion model for Case I and\nCase II devices, and a device with uniform mobility for com-\nparison. It can be seen that there is a significant accumulation\nof charge in the lower mobility regions for both the Case I\nand Case II devices, and that there is a sharp change in\ncharge density at the boundary between the layers of differ-\ning mobility with some \u201dsmearing\u201d due to diffusion. The\ncharge density profile around the boundary is only approxi-\nmately reproduced in the analytical description. This, in turn,\nleads to a redistribution of the field, which gives rise to an\nincreased drift current for Case I and Case II devices. Hence\nit is the boundary between the two layers of differing mobil-\nity that gives rise to the difference between the analytical and\ndrift-diffusion models.\nIV. MOBILITY VARIATIONS IN PV DEVICES\nNow we examine what the implications of nonuniform\nmobility are upon PV device performance. In these double-\ncarrier devices we insert a layer with low electron mobility in\nthe same manner as in Sec. III, while the hole mobility is\nassumed to be constant throughout the device. Parameters\nused in the simulation are shown in Table II. Field-dependent\ngeminate recombination efficiency is included after the\nmodel of Braun, in a similar manner to previous models.24\nBimolecular recombination is also included using the Lange-\nvin expression for the rate constant, which has recently been\nshown to be accurate to within an order of magnitude for\nblend devices \u0003with the notable exception of annealed\npoly\u00013-hexylthiophene\u0002 \u0001P3HT\u0002: 1-\u00013-methoxycarbonyl\u0002\npropyl-1phenyl-\u00036,6\u0004-methanofullerene \u0001PCBM\u0002 devices\u0004.25\nWe assume a uniform generation rate of free charge carriers\nof 5\u000b1027 m\u22123 s\u22121, which is typical for PV operating con-\nditions. Parameters are shown in Table II.\nFigure 4 shows the J-V characteristics of a PV device\nwith no low-mobility layer \u0001i.e., z=0\u0002, compared against\nthose for Case I and Case II devices with z=20 nm. All\ndevices show approximately the same open-circuit voltage\nand fill factor. However, they do differ in their short-circuit\ncurrent, JSC, with Case I having JSC 21% lower than that for\nz=0 case. Note that experimental data3 suggest that even\nlarger changes in mobility due to morphology variations than\nassumed here may be possible. As in the SCL diode case,\nhaving a low-mobility layer adjacent to the anode \u0001Case II\u0002\nhas a lesser effect. The cause of the change in JSC between\nthe various cases is primarily due to bimolecular recombina-\ntion losses. Figure 5 shows the bimolecular recombination\nrate for the Case I and Case II devices compared to a device\nwith no low-mobility layer \u0001z=0\u0002 at short circuit. It can be\nseen that the insertion of a layer with low electron mobility\nclose to the cathode significantly increases the bimolecular\nrecombination rate in the region of the low-mobility layer.\nWe can rule out geminate recombination losses being a fac-\nFIG. 3.

The open symbols in Fig. 6 show the pre-\ndictions of \f for a device with nonuniform electron mobility\nnormalized to the efficiency of a device without any low\nelectron mobility region \u0001i.e., z=0\u0002. Insertion of a layer with\nlow electron mobility is shown to have a stronger effect in\nCase I than in Case II. Indeed, insertion of only a 20 nm\nthick layer with low electron mobility next to the cathode\nreduces efficiency by \u000520%. A consequence of these data\nwould seem to be that it is vital we gain complete control\nover the blend morphology throughout the entire device, oth-\nerwise potential PV performance will be lost.\nSince PVs are often analyzed by assuming the device\nhas a uniform blend morphology, it seems pertinent to exam-\nine the effect of this assumption if the device has a nonuni-\nform blend morphology. So, in a similar manner to how ex-\nperimental data are analyzed,20,21 we now predict the\nefficiency of a device with a uniform mobility using the ef-\nfective mobility for a nonuniform device, \be,eff shown in Fig.\n2. The data are shown in Fig. 6 as closed symbols, to com-\npare with the open symbols that show the predictions when\nthe mobility is treated as nonuniform. Although relatively\nsmall, the differences between the models assuming uniform\nand nonuniform mobility can be significant when attempting\nto relate device performance to the underlying materials\nproperties. Larger differences are seen when the variation\nbetween mobilities is increased.\nV. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\nOur data show that the range of blend morphologies seen\nin real PV devices can give rise to significant variations in\nthe local mobility. Of course, the predicted results will not\napply to all blend systems. For example, blending\npoly\u00012-methoxy-5-\u00013\u0001 ,7\u0001-dimethyloctyloxy\u0002-p-phenylene vi-\nnylene\u0002 \u0001OC1C10-PPV\u0002 with PCBM actually improves the\ntransport through the OC1C10-PPV.26 Furthermore, blends of\nP3HT with nonconducting crystalline polymers have been\nshown to force the P3HT into structures capable of conduct-\ning when the concentration of P3HT is only 3 wt %.27\nWhether the present Monte Carlo approach is appropriate\ndepends upon whether the morphologies generated by simu-\nlated annealing match the local morphology of the device in\nquestion. However, the morphologies used are expected to be\naccurate for many blends.14,15,17 Indeed, there is experimen-\ntal evidence, which shows that the blend morphology can\nsignificantly affect mobility in the manner we propose, for\nexample,28,29 and further data that local morphology affects\nlocal charge transport.8\nDrift-diffusion modeling has shown that changes in the\nlocal mobility of one order of magnitude can give rise to\nsignificant changes in SCL diode and PV device perfor-\nmance. It is shown that the sequence of the layers with dif-\nferent mobilities makes a profound difference to the current\nthe SCL diode carries, and in turn, the effective mobility\nderived. Similar behavior is shown in the double-carrier PV\ndevice, stressing the need to take into account the morphol-\nogy of the device when interpreting data taken by experi-\nment. Furthermore it is shown that including layers with a\nmobility that is reduced by one order of magnitude can re-\nduce the device efficiency by more than 20%. Therefore it is\nimportant to exert a high degree of control over the morphol-\nogy, otherwise potential PV performance may be lost.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge useful discus-\nsions with Dr. C.
