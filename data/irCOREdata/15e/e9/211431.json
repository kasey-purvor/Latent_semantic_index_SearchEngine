Introduction \nPeople\u2019s thoughts in a golf course are sometimes peculiar. While most of us would use the occasion \nto try, somewhat clumsily, to emulate Tiger Woods in the approach to the famous 12 hole at the \nAugusta National Golf Club, to bond with our bosses and business partners, or to simply enjoy a \nrelaxing Sunday afternoon with our friends and family, Thomas L Friedman (2005) spent his time \non the course in Bangalore (or Bengaluru, as it has officially been renamed since 2006) to ponder \nabout the implications of having to aim his ball at either Microsoft or IBM (p. 3). And by managing \nto squeeze his ball right onto the flat Hindustani green, he reached the conclusion that the \u2018world is \nflat\u2019, i.e. \u201cthat the global competitive playing field is being levelled\u201d (Friedman 2005: 8).  \n \nFriedman\u2019s personal eureka is, alas for him, in itself not particularly new. A string of researchers \nand commentators have been for now almost two decades arguing that the expansion of trade, the \ninternationalization of firms, the galloping process of outsourcing, and the possibility to get \nnetworked at increasingly low prices herald the \u2018end of geography\u2019 (O\u2019Brien 1992), the \u2018death of \ndistance\u2019 (Cairncross 1997), or the emergence of a \u2018space of flows\u2019 (Castells 1998) or of a \n\u2018weightless economy\u2019 (Quah 1999). As Ohmae underlines, in a \u2018flat world\u2019 the real map of the \nworld is no longer a political map, but a map of capital, financial, and industrial flows, where \npolitical \u201cboundaries have largely disappeared\u201d (Ohmae 1991: 28). Yet, despite not putting forward \na completely new message, Friedman deserves credit on two counts. First, he manages to turn a \nwell-established idea into the spinal chord of an entertaining and well-written book, contributing to \npopularise a concept that, while well-known in academic and policy-making circles, has been fuzzy \nand somewhat overlooked or manipulated by managers, trade unionists, civil servants, and the \ngeneral public. Second, he takes the idea of the \u2018flat world\u2019 further than his predecessors by \nclaiming that \u2018Globalization 3.0\u2019, as he calls it, does not only flatten the playing field and represent \nthe end of geography as we know it, but also that the evening of the playing field empowers \nindividuals (Friedman 2005: 11). \u201cPeople all over the world started waking up and realizing that \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity. Cambridge journal of regions, economy and society, 1 (3). pp. 371-388. ISSN 1752-1378 - doi: 10.1093\/cjres\/rsn011 \n4 \nthey had more power than ever to go global as individuals, they needed more than ever to think of \nthemselves as individuals competing against other individuals all over the planet\u201d (Friedman 2005: \n11). \n \nHowever, Friedman\u2019s views of the flattening world and of the empowerment of individuals through \n\u2018Globalization 3.0\u2019 may simply be the result of him deciding to play golf with educated Indians and \nexpatriates on perfectly manicured courses on the high but relatively flat plateau that surrounds \nBangalore. Had he played cricket with barefoot children and with cardboard boxes as wickets in the \nNorth-West Frontier Province of Pakistan or, for that sake, dominoes with middle-aged blue collar \nworkers in a bar in the Italian Piedmont or boules or petanque with their French equivalent in \nGrenoble, his vision of the impact of globalization could have been very different. There, the sight \nof the Hindu Kush or of the Alps would have made him realise that, although this globalization \nwave does indeed represent a tectonic shift of perhaps unprecedented scale, it does not necessarily \nimply the erosion of previous mountains into a flat and uniform world. In contrast \u2013 as with any \ncrash of tectonic plates \u2013 it seems to signal the emergence of mountains ranges of similar height, if \nnot higher, than previously existing ones, although not necessarily in the same place. Globalization \nimplies changes, opportunities, and threats and not all territories across the world have the same \ncapacity and tools to make the world and even playing field.

He describes how these processes have evolved in recent years, levelling the \ncompetitive playing field in favour of initially more disadvantaged countries and individuals (the \n\u2018triple convergence\u2019 process). The evidence to support his thesis is based on extracts from \ninterviews and discussion with relevant people in different parts of the world and references to \nnumerous cases. This amiable validation of the \u2018flat world\u2019 thesis allows Friedman to proceed \nalmost seamlessly to the implications of globalization for the existing world political and socio-\neconomic order, placing special emphasis on the US competitive position and internal welfare.

Friedman puts together \u2018ten forces that flattened \nthe word\u2019 aseptic enough to make them attractive to virtually every one. Flattener #1 is the Fall of \nthe Berlin Wall in 1989, which allowed more connections across different societies, reinforcing \nglobalization\u2019s capacity to enhance all types of freedom: the freedom of movement of goods, \ncapital, services, and individuals; the freedom to adopt best practices and common standards (p. 54) \n\u2013 whatever this means \u2013 regardless of where you are based; and the freedom for creativity to flow. \nBy engaging in greater exchange not only individuals and territories become more innovative or \ncreative, they also achieve a significant leap with the adoption of best practices. Flatteners #2 \n(Netscape), #3 (Workflow software), and #4 (Uploading material) refer to the capacity of new \ntechnology to bring about greater interaction through enhanced connectivity and the creation of \nwhat Friedman calls a \u2018global supply chain of software\u2019, which allows the combination of different \nplatforms, such as PC and e-mail, as well as the increasing generation of community developed \nsoftware (p. 94). However, globalization is also about outsourcing (Flattener #5) \u2013 \u201ctaking some \nspecific, but limited, function that your company was doing in-house [\u2026] and having another \ncompany perform that exact same function for you\u201d (p. 137) \u2013, offshoring (#6) \u2013 recreating a \ncompany in a different place (p. 137) \u2013, supply-chaining (#7), and insourcing (#8) \u2013 something akin \nto synchronizing global supply chains [what apparently UPS now does (p. 168)]. Taken together, \nthe process allows for better \u2018in-forming\u2019 (#9) or the \u201cability to build and deploy your own personal \nsupply chains\u201d (p. 179). And all this is done at lightening speed by the use of what Friedman calls \n\u2018steroids\u2019 (Flattener #10), which allow engines to talk to computers, people to talk to people, \ncomputers to computers, and people to computers \u201cfarther, faster, more cheaply, and more easily \nthan ever before\u201d (p. 200). \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

Convergence I implies that the powerful flatteners which co-existed independently of each \nother for a number of years, started to converge in 2003,  emphasizing their self reinforcing nature \nand their intrinsic complementary. Convergence II or \u2018horizontalization\u2019 means that the interaction \nof the ten flatteners has brought about a radical revision of the predominant business model, forcing \nthe conversion of pre-existing vertical relationships (within and between firms) into horizontal \nforms of cooperation. Finally, convergence III or \u2018new actors entering the scene\u2019 represents the \nenlargement of the world\u2019s boundaries, as a corollary of the horizontalization of power and \neconomic relations. Progressively more countries and territories \u2013 from China and India to Russia, \nEastern Europe, and Latin America \u2013 are becoming able to play a prominent role in the global \nmarket place.  \n \nThe net result of this transformation is simply a better world. A world where individuals are \nempowered and better off. As Friedman underlines, \u201cmore people in more places, now have the \npower to access the flat world platform\u201d (p. 206), even if this only means the opportunity to \nchallenge someone giving a conference by accessing more accurate information in real time (p. \n189) or to pay \u201cSouth West Airlines to be their employee\u201d (p. 202). But empowerment is only the \ntip of the iceberg. As a consequence of globalization, consumers benefit from cheaper and more \nefficient goods, from cheaper and better quality access to their friends and family living abroad, or \nfrom the possibility of assimilating innovation \u201cwithout having to emigrate\u201d (p. 217). But, even if \nthis process seems \u2013 from Friedman\u2019s perspective \u2013 a natural evolution of modern capitalism, there \nare still some obstacles that have been slowing the \u2018triple convergence\u2019 and its impact. Habits and \ninstitutions often act as sand grains in this powerful mechanism, requiring a \u201cmassive world wide \nchange in habits\u201d (p. 217). This \u2018great sorting out\u2019 calls into question the role of the nation state \n[\u201cCan it be preserved in a flat world?\u201d (p. 23)], world-level exploitation relationships [\u201cWho is \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

In this framework, Friedman argues that the main \nforce likely to remove these residual obstacles to a perfectly flat world is the dear old \u2018free trade\u2019 \nrecipe. Free trade is the milestone of Friedman\u2019s argumentation: \u2018flat\u2019 is in fact synonymous with \n\u2018free trade\u2019 (p. 264). As a consequence, Friedman\u2019s discussion of the patterns of winners and losers \nin the flat world and the corresponding remedies brings to mind the vast literature on the economic \neffects of the free movement of capital, goods, and labour.  \n \nIn particular Friedman\u2019s thesis (and his rhetoric) is reminiscent of the literature on the \u2018death of \ndistance\u2019 (O\u2019Brien 1992; Ohmae 1995; Castells 1996; Cairncross 1997). In this literature it is \nclaimed that technological progress and innovation is rapidly reducing the importance of distance in \nthe location of economic activity. The great achievement of globalization has been to lower the \nbarriers that prevented the mobility of capital, goods, labour, and, increasingly, services. As \nlocation matters \u201cwhile physical barriers exist, while travel takes time, and while cultural and other \nsocial differences persist\u201d (O\u2019Brien 1992: 2), the rapid erosion of the obstacles that prevented the \nexchange of information, knowledge, goods, and other production factors has meant an even faster \nconvergence towards a \u2018spaceless\u2019 digital world and towards more homogenous and global cultural \nmodels (Castells 1996; Cairncross 1997). As in Friedman\u2019s thinking, the main engine behind the \n\u2018death of distance\u2019 notion is the \u2018communications revolution\u2019, technological progress and the \nemergence of advanced telecommunications and computing technologies allows for an enhanced \nmobility of economic factors, for an homogenisation of habits and activities, and for the removal of \nresource bottlenecks (Castells 1996). Technological progress, thus, detaches economic activity from \nits territorial and socio-economic context, permitting growth and development to occur virtually \neverywhere, even in areas where poor endowments had prevented development to take root \n(O\u2019Brien 1992). Hence, thanks to computers and communication technology, economic activity can \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

Information once available only to the few will be \navailable to the many, instantly and (in terms of distribution costs) inexpensively\u201d (Cairncross \n1997: 4).  \n \nThe concept of the nation-state both as a barrier, but also as an increasing irrelevance in this \u2018world \nof flows\u2019 is also present across previous \u2018death of distance\u2019 arguments. No one focuses more on this \npoint than Kenichi Ohmae (1991 and 1995), who posits that economic actors have seized the \nopportunities afforded to them by this wave of globalization and have become extremely mobile, \nincreasingly disregarding national or legal borders (Ohmae 1991 and 1995). More often than not, the \nhitherto almighty Westphalian nation-state is finding itself powerless to counter these trends. As \neconomic activity and ownership become more and more international and global, economic actors \nbecome increasingly \u201cdivorced from national definitions\" (O'Brien 1992: 100). As Friedman (2005) \nputs it \u201cthe more the flattening forces reduce friction and barriers, the sharper the challenge they \nwill pose to the national-state and to the particular cultures, values, national identities, democratic \ntraditions, and bonds of restraint that have historically provided some protection and cushioning for \nworkers and communities\u201d (p. 237-8). As a consequence, the powers of the state are reportedly being \n\u2018hollowed out\u2019 through the emergence of other actors, such as regions and international \norganizations, on the one hand, and multinational enterprises, on the other (Jessop 1995), limiting \nthe state\u2019s capacity to influence economic processes that take place on its territory.  \n \nThe best thing of the flat world proposed by Friedman (2005) is that all its benefits come at very \nlittle cost. It is true that Americans and countries in the developing world would have to workout in \nthe gym in order to get themselves into shape for the challenges the flat world brings about. But \nnothing too hard. The recipe for Americans is nothing they have not experienced before: more \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

With those ingredients, the US will be able to address the ambition \ngap with the emerging economies which is at the root of the current US problems to adapt to a \nglobalized economy. For the developing world the recipe is not more daunting: more accessibility \nto the internet, more education, and better governance (p. 398).  \n \nHence, taken to its limits, the flat world argument implies that \"location no longer matters\" (O'Brien \n1992: 73), that activity can flourish virtually anywhere in the world at little cost, as advances in \ntechnology and telecommunications would have allowed a much greater mobility of information \nand knowledge, progressively eroding the traditional benefits of economies of scale, of scope, or of \ncommunication. From this perspective, thanks to advances in connectivity, in global supply chain \nsoftware, and of outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring, and supply chaining, every territory, no matter \nhow remote, has the potential to become a global player. Traders in the London stock exchange can \nmove to the Seychelles and perform their work from there not only while sipping Pimm\u2019s lying on \ntheir hammocks on an idyllic beach, but also saving thousands on rent as a result of not having to \nworry about having an office in the City. Probably this shift may allow them to be as productive \nbecause, despite possibly spending more time lying around, traders in the Seychelles will lose less \ntime to commuting and congestion and will be happier, and happiness is associated with greater \nproductivity (Layard 2005). Real time and low cost connectivity will make this possible. In a \nsimilar way, global production chains would generate millions of industrial and service jobs across \nthe world, regardless of whether the workers are located in Bangalore, in Shanghai, in Djakarta, or \nin Sao Paulo. These jobs would not only raise the standard of living of those getting them \u2013 as they \ngenerally pay much higher salaries than local jobs \u2013 but also generate multiplier effects that will \nimprove the quality of life of individuals all over the world at no cost for the developed world.

Globalization hence does not entail winners and losers from a territorial perspective. It creates \nthe conditions for a win-win situation: both the global North and the global South win. \n \n3. Mountains in the flat world \n \nYet, unfortunately, the evidence that the world is being flattened out by the eroding forces of \nglobalization and that this is empowering people across the globe is less forthcoming than Friedman \nwould have wished. While it may be true that global conditions have improved and contributed to \nraise millions out of poverty, in relative terms the positive evidence is less forthcoming. For every \nBangalore, Hyderabad, or Chandigarh, there are many other similar-sized cities in India \u2013 not to \nmention a whole swathe of rural areas \u2013 that are virtually untouched, if not negatively affected, by \nthe whole globalization process. Bangalores are conspicuously absent from most eastern Indian \nstates, including Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa, and even the largest state in India, \nUttar Pradesh. Similarly in China, for every Shanghai, Guandong, Wenzhou, or Bohai rim, there are \nlarge territories in inland China that have been unable to shake their dependence on declining and \noften decrepit old communist heavy industries or on agriculture, to attract foreign direct investment, \nor to significantly raise the standard of living of its citizens. Bangalores are also noticeably absent \nfrom most of Africa, most of the Arab World \u2013 with the possible exception of Dubai \u2013 and most of \nLatin America. And for every Indian, Chinese, Brazilian, Malay, or Arab engineer playing golf in \nBangalore, watching the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Hong Kong, or attending the Formula 1 \nGrand Prix in Sao Paulo, Kuala Lumpur, or Bahrein, there are thousands, if not millions, of \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

Not all citizens of the world and, for that sake, all Indians, have what Friedman \n(2005) calls the \u201cgreat advantage in having a pool of educated, low-wage English speakers with a \nstrong service etiquette in their DNA and an enterprising spirit\u201d (p. 221) or even \u201cthe tools or the \nskills or the infrastructure to participate in any meaningful or sustained way\u201d (p. 470) in \n\u2018Globalization 3.0\u2019. \n \nIn fact the evidence about the economic implications of globalization is rather mixed. Whether \nconvergence at country level exists is much discussed. 1 Most analyses using countries across the \nworld tend to find either divergence, or the emergence of a \u2018twin-peaked\u2019 evolution in the \ndistribution of world income (Quah 1997; Jones 1997), that is the emergence of convergence clubs \nat high and low levels of income leading to increasing polarisation across the world. However, that \nis not always the case (e.g. Dollar and Kraay 2002) and, when population-weights are introduced in \nthe equation, the picture changes radically and divergence or twin-peaked distributions disappear, \nleading to convergence (Schultz 1998; Sala-i-Mart\u00edn 2006). Finally, when data for individuals are \nused the results indicate that inequality is very high, and that either there is uncertainty \u2013 mainly as \na consequence of lack of adequate time series of data \u2013 about the direction of change (Milanovic \n2005), or inequality has indeed increased (Dowrick and Ackmal 2001; Wade 2004).  \n \nAt subnational level, the evidence tends to be less controversial. The general consensus is that, \ndespite the fact that poverty levels have tended to decrease, within countries income inequalities \nhave tended to grow, regardless of whether the analysis includes data for regions or individuals \n(UNDP 2001, 2003; Milanovic 2005). Regional disparities in India, for example, grew by more \nthan 23 percent in the 1990s (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Gill 2006: 1209).

Large metropoli and urban agglomerations \nseem to be, by and large, the main beneficiaries of this trend. As Scott puts it, although it is true that \nthe combination of technical progress and de-regulation have greatly enhanced the mobility of \ngoods, labour, capital, and knowledge, this has neither implied the ubiquity of economic activity, \nnor undermined the need for urban concentration (Scott et al. 2001: 15). There is clear evidence \nacross the world that large urban areas are attracting increasing shares of wealth, economic activity, \nand skilled workers. This is certainly the case in the developed world, where the protagonism of \ncities such as New York, London, Tokyo, or Paris at a global scale has been significantly enhanced \n(Sassen 2001; Taylor et al. 2001), or of Mumbai in India, Shanghai in China, Mexico City in \nMexico, or Sao Paulo in Brazil. Economic command and control functions have been significantly \nincreased in these so-called \u2018alpha\u2019 cities (Taylor and Hoyler 2000; Taylor and Walker 2001; \nTaylor et al. 2001). \n \n But below this top level, many second-tier \u2018beta\u2019 and third-tier \u2018gamma\u2019 cities are also doing \nparticularly well. In Europe, cities like Brussels, Amsterdam and the Randstad, Madrid, \nCopenhagen, Helsinki, Stockholm, or Rome have witnessed growth levels well above their national \naverage. Cities such as Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Djakarta, Santiago de Chile, \nCape Town, or even, within poorer countries, Accra or Maputo have also performed well. The \nconcentration \u2013 rather than the more even territorial spread \u2013 of wealth and economic activity in \nthese cities tells a very different story from that of the flat world. Other factors determining the \ncreation of wealth are also increasingly agglomerated in and around large urban metropoli. This is, \nfor example, the case of innovation and research spillovers which have become concentrated in \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

This is evident in Europe, where knowledge spillovers have \nbeen calculated not to exceed radius of around 200 kms from the largest and most dynamic cities \n(Moreno et al 2005; Crescenzi et al. 2007; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008), but more so in the \nUS, where knowledge spillovers barely exceed the boundaries of metropolitan areas (Anselin et al. \n1997; Varga 2000; Sonn and Storper 2008). These global, sub-global, and lower rank cities, which \nare becoming interrelated in an emerging \u2018world city network\u2019 (Taylor 2001) and where the \nfunctional links between cities are strengthened beyond physical contiguity (Castells 1996), are the \nmountains (or, if you want, the islands) in this flat world. In fact the world these days resembles \nmuch more what Veltz (1996, 2000) has called an \u2018archipelago economy\u2019, that is, a world where the \nconnections between cities with relatively similar functions and powers in a world economy are \ngreatly developed, regardless of distance, as they become increasingly detached from their regional \nand national contexts. As Castells (1996) indicates, in this \u2018space of flows\u2019 generated by \nglobalization, large metropolitan areas become the nodes within the global network of financial and \nbusiness firms. Hence, although advances in technology and deregulation may allow for economic \nactivity to take place virtually everywhere, the reality is that this \u2018everywhere\u2019 is represented by a \nrelatively limited number of places in different areas of the world, where global corporations locate \nengendering an ever greater urbanization of capital and decision-making structures (Sassen 1990; \nO\u2019Brien 1992; Hall 1993; Castells 1998), a greater agglomeration of company headquarters \n(Bosman and de Schmidt 1993), and an even closer relationship between economic and political \npower (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose 1998: 81).  \n \n4.

What are the tectonic forces that explain the \nreinforcement of these mountains in a flat world? \n \nThe emergence of mountains in a flat world is related to the role played by proximity in \ndetermining the location of economic activity. As O\u2019Brien (1992), Cairncross (1997), and Friedman \n(2005) posit, there is little doubt that, in theory, progress in telecommunications and in the capacity \nto store and diffuse massive amounts of information online has greatly reduced the role of physical \nproximity for the development of economic activity. However, physical or geographical proximity \nis only one dimension of proximity. Boschma (2005: 62) identifies four other dimensions: \ncognitive, organizational, social, and institutional. Cognitive proximity is related to the fact that \n\u201cknowledge and innovations are often cumulative and localised outcomes of search processes \nwithin firms with a high degree of tacit knowledge\u201d (Boschma 2005: 63). Organizational proximity \nrefers to the organizational practices and interdependencies that facilitate interactive learning, while \nsocial proximity highlights the fact that economic activity is embedded in a social context \n(Granovetter 1985; Grabher 1993). Finally, institutional proximity refers to the presence of similar \ninstitutions, such as \u201ca common language, shared habits, a law system securing ownership and \nintellectual property rights, etc\u201d (Boschma 2005: 68) that provide the support for economic co-\nordination. While Boschma (2005) is careful to state that these different types of proximity do not \nnecessarily relate to geographical proximity, we will argue that the reason behind the emergence of \nmountains in a flat world is precisely the interdependence of all the different types of proximity and \nhow these different proximities coalesce in large metropolitan areas (and hence in relatively \nreduced geographical scales from a world perspective). Our tenet is that large urban agglomerations \nprovide the setting where economic and social actors benefit from proximity to other economic and \nsocial actors with whom they can relate from a cognitive, organizational, social, and institutional \ndimension, creating the adequate environment for exchanges of ideas, Jacobs\u2019 type externalities, \ninnovation, and ultimately, economic activity and growth (Duranton and Puga 2001).

Let us now briefly \nreview some of these factors in order to discuss how their interaction shapes a much more complex \ngeography of the world economy than that underlying Friedman\u2019s flat world metaphor.  \n \n4.1 Tectonic Plate Movements 1: Innovation and economic performance  \nWhen, in contrast to neoclassical assumptions, technology and human capital accumulation are \nfully recognised as the result of explicit decisions of economic agents, economic growth becomes \n\u201can endogenous outcome of an economic system, [and] not the result of forces that impinge from \noutside\u201d (Romer 1994: 3). Technology, technological progress, and human resources \u2013 considered \nas the main forces \u201cbehind perpetually rising standards of living\u201d (Grossman and Helpman 1994: \n24) \u2013 become endogenous, and change differently in different territories according to the quality of \nhuman resources and to the amount of human and physical capital devoted to research and \ndevelopment (Romer 1986; Lucas 1988; Rebelo 1991). Innovation takes place where the adequate \nendowments of human and physical capital are located and, vice versa, innovation generates \neconomic dynamism which attracts more human resources and more capital. Hence \u2013 and although \ntechnology has, in theory, the potential of weakening these agglomeration forces \u2013 under an \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

ISSN 1752-1378 - doi: 10.1093\/cjres\/rsn011 \n17 \nendogenous growth framework, innovation and human capital will tend to co-locate in relatively \ncompact geographical areas. \n \nThe potential for the concentration of economic activity and for divergence becomes more evident \nwhen issues such as the minimum thresholds of R&D and of appropriability of technology \u2013 \nhighlighted by the neo-Schumpeterian strand of the endogenous growth approach \u2013 are considered. \nFor R&D investment to be effective a minimum threshold of investment is necessary, making the \nrelationship between investment in R&D and economic growth not linear. Furthermore there are \nstrong threshold effects and external economies associated with R&D investment and returns from \nR&D rely heavily on the quality of the workforce conducting research, on the concentration of \nR&D centres in limited spaces, on the quality of the local human capital (Audretsch and Feldman \n1996; De Bondt 1996; Engelbrecht 1997), and, above all, on the amount of investment (Scherer \n1983; Dosi 1988). Hence, limited and\/or dispersed investment in R&D in lagging areas may not \nyield the expected returns, as most R&D projects may lack the adequate dimension to conduct \ncompetitive research and local scientists and researchers are likely to be more isolated than in \nadvanced technological centres. In addition, as will be discussed in further detail below, the local \neconomic tissue may lack the capacity to successfully achieve the passage from technological \nprogress to innovation and to economic growth (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose 1999). Most spaces in the flat \nworld will thus be unable to innovate and can only hope to increase their innovation absorptive \ncapacity. The net result will be the agglomeration of innovative forces in urban \u2018mountains\u2019, with \ninnovation being generally related to the size of the urban agglomeration. \n \n4.2. The impact of knowledge spillovers.  \nNew knowledge, the ultimate engine of growth in the theories sketched above, is neither fully \nappropriable by its producers, nor exhausted after use. It is cumulative and can be diffused. \nConsequently the process of knowledge accumulation gives rise to spillovers which could benefit a \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

The degree and extent of the diffusion \nof knowledge spillovers has thus important implications for the possibility of considering \ninnovation as a \u2018flattening\u2019 force. If spillovers were to be diffused globally without costs or frictions \n\u2013 making innovation instantly available to everybody as manna from heaven \u2013 innovation and \ntechnological change could benefit all countries, regions, and individuals regardless of their actual \nlocation [as sunlight in a flat landscape or, using Friedman\u2019s (2005) terms, as a powerful steroid \nfuelling globalization]. However, an increasing amount of empirical evidence seems to point in a \ndifferent direction stressing, on the one hand, the place-boundedness of spillovers and, on the other, \nthe complex mechanisms underlying their diffusion across distance. According to Audretsch and \nFeldman, \u201cknowledge spillovers do not [...] transmit costlessly with respect to geographical \ndistance\u201d (1996: 256). Numerous empirical studies have shown that the returns linked to the \ntransmission of knowledge are geographically bounded and suffer from important distance-decay \neffects (Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson 1993; Narin, Hamilton and Olivastro 1997; Howells 2002). \nKnowledge and innovation tend to agglomerate geographically, with spillovers from research \nleading to the creation of self-reinforcing virtuous circles of accumulation and to the genesis of \nsignificant multiplier effects in technologically advanced areas (Verspagen, 1997). Technological \nimprovements in communication infrastructures have not affected all kinds of information in the \nsame way, while \u2018codified information\u2019 can be transmitted over increasingly large distances, \u2018tacit\u2019 \nknowledge is geographically bounded \u2013 or in Morgan\u2019s (2004) words \u2018locationally sticky\u2019 \u2013 and is \nalso related to context and culture (Gertler 2003), contributing to the increasing concentration of \ninnovation (Audretsch and Feldman 2004; Cantwell and Iammarino 2003). \u201cCodifiable information \n[\u2026] is cheap to transfer because its underlying symbol systems can be widely disseminated through \ninformation infrastructure\u201d (Leamer and Storper 2001: 650). However, information is not \ncompletely codifiable due to some specific features which, in some cases, make codification \nimpossible or too expensive. \u201cIf the information is not codifiable, merely acquiring the symbol \nsystem or having the physical infrastructure is not enough for the successful transmission of a \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

Thus, in this latter case information is transmitted by \nface-to-face contacts, an intrinsically spatial communication technology. Furthermore, even if the \ntransmission of formally codified knowledge is less sensitive to proximity relationships for its \ndiffusion and more dependent on local absorptive capacity for its impact (Cohen and Levinthal \n1990), research on patent citations suggests that proximity facilitates a faster diffusion of the latter \nkind of knowledge as well (Sonn and Storper 2008). \n \nAt least three mechanisms make knowledge and its transmission powerful forces for the genesis of \nmountains and valleys in the world economy landscape: \n1) Local innovative activities are crucial for the production of new knowledge and the economic \nexploitation of existing knowledge given the presence of a minimum threshold. Such activities are \nnot evenly distributed geographically and thus become a localised source of competitive advantage \nfor some areas rather than for others; \n2) Information is not automatically equivalent to economically-useful knowledge (Sonn and Storper \n2008). A successful process of innovation depends on \u201clocalised structural and institutional factors \nthat not only shape the innovative capacity of specific geographical contexts\u201d (Iammarino 2005: \n499) \u2013 as highlighted by the systems of innovation approach (Lundvall 2001), regional systems of \ninnovation (Cooke et al. 1997) and learning regions (Gregersen and Johnson 1996; Morgan 1997) \u2013 \nbut that also influence the capability of every territory to absorb and productively employ \nexogenous knowledge spillovers; \n3) The evidence of the spatial boundedness of knowledge spillovers not only contradicts the idea of \nubiquitous knowledge evenly available everywhere, but also helps explain how peripherality can \npersistently hamper regional innovative capacity after controlling for indigenous innovative efforts: \nthe smaller the spatial extent of knowledge spillovers, the lower the exposition of peripheral areas \nto externally produced knowledge. While highly-accessible core regions can benefit from \ninnovative activities pursued in their proximity, the spatial boundedness of spillovers prevents them \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

As a consequence, the stronger the spatial decay of the \nspillovers the more accentuated their tendency to develop localised pools of knowledge in central \nlocations.  \n \nThe processes which seem to be shaping this mountainous world economy are complemented and \nmaximised by, but not limited to, geographical proximity. Boschma\u2019s (2005) cognitive, \norganizational, social, and institutional distances also play an important role. In conjunction with \ngeographical proximity they all provide alternative means to reduce uncertainty and solve the \nproblem of coordination, facilitating learning and innovation. This perspective on the process of \ninnovation (and its diffusion) makes the picture even more complex: a country\u2019s, a region\u2019s, or an \nindividuals\u2019 potential of becoming part of Friedman\u2019s level playing field depends on their capacity \nto develop a number of other proximity relations with other relevant actors. Not only the cognitive \nbase of individuals and firms needs to be close enough to the sources of new knowledge, in order to \nallow its successful absorption and processing (cognitive proximity), but also the way in which \nrelations between (and within) actors are shared in an organizational arrangement becomes crucial \n(organizational proximity). Furthermore, the exchange of tacit knowledge requires \u2013 at the micro \nlevel \u2013 trust \u201cbased on friendship, kinship and experience \u201d (Boschma, 2005: 66)  (social proximity) \nand \u2013 at the macro level \u2013 actors sharing \u201cthe same institutional rules of the game as well as a set of \ncultural values and habits\u201d (p. 68) (institutional proximity).  \n \nThe set of proximities needed to generate a virtuous circle of innovation \u2013 by allowing the \nemergence of complex innovative network relationships, operating between and across different \nscales (from local to transnational) \u2013 further contributes to the emergence of mountains in \nFriedman\u2019s flat world. From this perspective \u201cinnovation systems are a combination of intra-local, \nextra local and transnational network connections\u201d which \u201care not just intra or inter-corporate in \nnature [as highlighted in Faulconbridge, 2006], but may also encompass other forms of social \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

These networks generate a multifaceted geography of \nrelations in the world economy which may systematically favour some actors (those enjoying the \nbest balance of the various proximities with the most innovative actors), while further marginalising \nthose at the geographical, cognitive, organisational, social, and\/or institutional periphery. \n \n4.3. Backward and forward linkages and the \u201cnew economic geography\u201d. \nA third tectonic force are the backward and forward linkages of the \u2018New Economic Geography\u2019 \n(NEG). The NEG has tended to highlight the increasing concentration of economic activity based \non factors such as the interplay of agglomeration economies, backward and forward linkages, \ncritical threshold and market size (Krugman, 1991), and, above all, falling transport costs \n(Krugman, 1991). The equilibrium depends on the interactions between agglomeration (economies \nof scale, home market effect, backward and forward linkages, labour pool) and dispersion (prices \nfor intermediates, wages, competition) forces. Changes in transaction and transport costs (due to \neconomic integration and globalization) modify the balance between these forces, eventually \ngenerating new core-periphery patterns. \n \nUnder a new economic geography framework, assuming a two region, two sector model \u2013 with \ncities specialised in manufacturing and services, and rural areas in agriculture \u2013 as trade in \nmanufacturing increases, cities will grow, often at the expense of their rural hinterlands (Paluzie, \n2001), reinforcing a core-periphery pattern. Hence, when a country opens to trade, imports and \nexports to and from the core areas contribute to expand their hinterlands at the expense of less \ndeveloped areas. No longer are firms and industries subject to the maximum size constraint \nimposed by the limited demand of domestic rural markets \u2013 they can sustain growth, and \nagglomeration, by servicing foreign demand, and making use of cheaper foreign inputs. The \nincentive to agglomerate therefore increases alongside the increased market potential that cities, as \nthe mountains in the flat world, have access to through the opening of export and import markets \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

As a result, opening to manufacturing trade tends to increase the \nincentives for firms, and workers, to concentrate in core areas, and in larger rather than in smaller \ncities, thereby fostering greater within country disparities.  \n \n4.4. Specialisation vs. diversification  \nThe analysis of the impact of specialisation vs. diversification on innovation and economic \nperformance sheds additional new light on the increasing success of cities and agglomerations in \nthe era of \u2018Globalization 3.0\u2019. While increasing specialisation is likely to foster MAR (Marshall-\nArrow-Romer) externalities within the same industry, the diversity of economic activities pursued \nlocally allows local actors to benefit from knowledge base complementarities and across-industry \nexchange of ideas (Jacobian externalities). The empirical literature suggests that both MAR \n(Glaeser et al. 1992; Henderson 1999) and Jacobian externalities (Andersson et al. 2005; Carlino et \nal. 2001; Feldman and Audretsch 1999) may play an important role in fostering innovation either in \ndifferent industrial contexts2 or at different phases of a product life cycle3. A crucial issue for the \nprosperity and success of cities stems from the capability to efficiently exploit MAR and Jacobian \nexternalities. When other forces (historical, institutional, political) prevent the evolution of the \ncluster from reaching its most efficient equilibrium at any moment in time between both types of \nexternal economies, overall economic performance could be hampered. Diversified cities tend to be \nlarger while specialised cities are generally smaller in size. Whereas both diversified and \nspecialised cities can in principle perform equally well, the potential risks for specialised cities are \ngreater4. These risks are related to their lower innovative capacity and their greater exposure to rise \nand fall patterns of specific sectors of specialised cities (Duranton and Puga, 2000). In the long-run, \n                                                 \n2\n Henderson et al. (1995) find that Jacobs-type externalities prevail in high tech and MAR in capital \ngoods industries. \n3\n Duranton and Puga (2001) suggest that firms develop new products in diversified creative urban \ncontexts, subsequently, relocating to specialised cities in the mass production phase in order to \nexploit cost advantage. \n4\n Although many specialised cities are doing rather well in this \u2018flat world\u2019. \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

Hence it is fundamentally \nthe unique mix of social, institutional, cognitive, and organizational proximities found in large \nmetropolitan areas that once again allows for the adequate linkages to be developed and for the \nright mix of specialisation vs. diversification to emerge. \n \n4.5. Community, social capital and the creative class  \nFormal and informal institutions also play an important role in shaping the mountains of the uneven \nworld we are depicting. Many of the agglomeration effects of the endogenous growth and new \neconomic geography theories are reinforced by the predictions of numerous institutional theories \nthat underline the role of institutions and institutional factors on economic activity. These theories, \ndespite their different origins, coincide on the role played by institutions in fostering economic \nconcentration.  \n \nMany studies have unearthed a close link between \u2018good\u2019 institutional conditions or the presence of \nstrong communities and the clustering of economic activities. Qualitative work on clusters and \nindustrial districts (e.g. Piore and Sabel 1984; Kristensen 1992; Semlinger 1993; Burroni 2001), \n\u2018learning regions\u2019 (Gertler, Wolfe and Garkut 2000; Henry and Pinch 2000; Bathelt 2001), and \nregional systems of innovation (Cooke and Morgan 1998) stresses how complex institutional and \ngovernance arrangements create the conditions for economic activity to thrive and ultimately \u2013 as \ngood institutional conditions are hard to replicate \u2013 to agglomerate. Factors such as the close \ninteraction among local political actors, the presence of a functioning civil society, regional \nadministrations, employers organizations and trade unions \u2013 in what Trigilia (1992) calls an \n\u2018institutionalized market' \u2013 favour economic development and agglomeration.

Conversely, the absence of poles of collective action often leads to the formation of \nvicious circles of low growth. The lack or relatively little importance in social life of collective \norganizations, the presence of clientelistic practices, or the governing of social activity by simple social \nstructures (often characteristic of relatively remote and backward spaces) facilitate migration and \ndiscourage economic activity. \n \nMany quantitative analyses reach similar results. Putnam\u2019s work on Italian social capital (1993) \nshows how differences in levels of community institutions between Northern and Southern Italy are \nat the base of their sizeable income inequalities. Other research has found that different institutional \nproxies of community, such as group participation, help explain higher economic performance \n(Knack and Keefer 1997; Zak and Knack 1998; Beugelsdijk et al. 2004; Guiso, Sapienza and \nZingales 2004), or that, conversely, excessive divisions within societies limit their growth potential \n(Easterly and Levine 1997; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Storper 2006).  \n \nTaken to its limits, some analysts indicate how having a high density of closely-knit institutional \nnetworks in close physical proximity \u2013 called \u2018institutional thickness\u2019 by Amin and Thrift (1995) \nand \u2018institutional capital\u2019 by Healey (1998) \u2013 is a key condition for economic development. \nCombinations of \u2018intellectual capital\u2019 (i.e. knowledge resources), \u2018social capital\u2019 (trust, reciprocity, \ncooperative spirit and other social relations), and \u2018political capital\u2019 (capacity of collective action) \nwithin these institutional networks determine the potential for development. The greater the density \nof complex institutional networks within a given territory, the greater the potential for higher \ngrowth and development (Amin and Thomas 1996; Morgan 1997; Cooke and Morgan 1998). \n \nThese structural sources of competitive advantage are far from vanishing in response to the process \nof globalization (let alone the ten \u2018world flatteners\u2019 singled out by Friedman).

For Florida (2002) the future of local economies relies on attracting and retaining members \nof the \u2018creative class\u2019, comprising those who work in sectors such as technology, media and \nentertainment, and finance and whose activities embody creativity, individuality, and difference. \nAnd there is no better place to achieve this than in open and cosmopolitan cities that provide all \nwhat the \u2018creative class\u2019 are looking for in terms of alternative lifestyles, relaxed dress codes, \nflexible working arrangements, and leisure activities focused on exercise and extreme sports, and \ntheir preference for \u2018indigenous street level culture\u2019 (Florida 2002). The interaction between the \nenormous capability of the members of this \u2018creative class\u2019 to generate economic value and its \nunprecedented mobility gives cities able to develop adequate conditions (thanks to their endogenous \nsocio-institutional capabilities) an enormous advantage over other areas and territories. \n \n 4.6 Buzz: The ultimate tectonic force \nSo far we have discussed the origins and mechanics of the forces responsible for the emergence of \nurban \u2018mountains\u2019 in today\u2019s world economic landscape5. We now need to take a closer look at the \nultimate driver behind all these tectonic movements: the \u2018buzz\u2019 of the cities. By innovatively \ncombining economic and institutional approaches to economic agglomeration Storper and Venables \n(2004) have proposed the theory of \u2018buzz\u2019 or of \u2018buzz cities\u2019: \u2018Buzz\u2019 is eminently about face-to-face \ncontact. They argue that backward and forward linkages, access to markets, the clustering of \nworkers, and technological interactions are not the only factors determining agglomeration. Any \nexplanation of why economic activity is agglomerating more and more is incomplete without what \nthey call the \u2018most fundamental\u2019 aspect of proximity: namely face-to-face contact (Storper and \nVenables 2004: 352). In this approach, face-to-face interaction is economically efficient, as it helps \n                                                 \n5\n In many ways there is nothing new under the sun. The forces of agglomeration and urbanization described so far have \nbeen among the leading drivers of capitalism since, at least, the 16th  and 17th centuries: well outside the scope of the \ntwenty-first century history presented by Friedman. The logic of the process of territorial differentiation of the world \neconomy seems to trascend historical shifts, even if the scale of this process is nowadays undoubtedly global.  \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

And nowhere is face-to-face contact more likely to take place than in large and \ndiversified cities. These cities \u2013 which Storper and Venables (2004) define as \u2018buzz cities\u2019 \u2013 put \nhighly-skilled and motivated individuals in contact with one another, contributing to making people \nin a \u2018buzz\u2019 environment highly productive and encouraging cross-fertilization between sectorally-\nspecialised networks. New activities are, thus, more likely to be developed in the \u2018buzz\u2019 centres \nwhere agglomeration forces are not only dependent on classical economic agglomeration \neconomies, but institutional and \u2018buzz\u2019 factors are regarded as playing an increasingly prominent \nrole in this direction. \u2018Buzz\u2019 is cognitive, organizational, social, and institutional proximity brought \ntogether in a reduced geographical environment and acts as the ultimate tectonic force for the \nemergence of mountains in Friedman\u2019s flat world. \n \nWhat might be misleading at a first glance is that the most important buzz cities (e.g. London, New \nYork, L.A.) are also the most globalized: they are nodes of international business, financial and \ncultural networks, locations of the headquarters of many multinational corporations; they are at the \nvery centre of \u2018global\u2019 travel-and-meeting activities. However, \u201cthe highest levels of international \nbusiness require insertion into locally-grounded government and political networks in order to \nfunction efficiently\u201d and although \u201cthe precise mix of activities involving face-to-face contacts and \ncollocation will change, they (\u2026) will continue to generate agglomeration of highly skilled \nindividuals, firms and bureaucracy in high-cost urban centres\u201d (Storper and Venables 2004:366 and \n368).

This process is not only about a few major \nworld centres, but has produced a complex roster of cities where leading world cities in the major \n\u2018globalisation arenas\u2019 are functionally interconnected by an uneven world city system (Beaverstock, \nTaylor, and Smith, 1999). Furthermore, the increasing importance of cities is likely to be \ncomplemented by the emergence and reinforcement of a number of highly specialised high-tech \ncentres of excellence where the importance of global interconnections may complement and even \nexceed that of local buzz  (Moodysson et al., 2005).  \n \nBy enabling face-to-face contacts and the transmission of uncodified\/tacit (or uncodifiable) \nknowledge \u2013 often in conjunction with their role of major nodes of (material and immaterial) global \nnetwork relations - \u2018buzz\u2019 cities benefit from an enduring competitive advantage over other \nterritories which reinforces other agglomeration forces in a process of cumulative causation. Local \ninnovative activities allow better local economic performance but also produce localised knowledge \nspillovers whose beneficial effects not only depend on proximity relationships, but also on the \npresence of local institutions (or social filters) enabling their absorption and translation into further \neconomic growth. However, the appearance of new mountains in the economic landscape or the \nsurge of existing ones also depends on other localised factors such as a favourable balance between \nspecialisation and diversification and an efficient equilibrium between agglomeration and \ndispersion forces. The unprecedented pace of the shifts of the technological frontier in a large \nnumber of sectors has also brought the role of a class of \u2018creative people\u2019 continuously involved in \nthe generation of new ideas to the fore. Innovation and ideas are exchanged, diffused, and cross-\nfertilised in the urban areas able to develop the adequate environment in terms of its capacity to \nattract and retain creative people and, last but not least, maximise face-to-face contacts. Once this \nprocess is activated it has an enormous cumulative potential: the productivity of local innovative \nactivities is significantly enhanced when the conditions mentioned above are met, generating the \neconomic incentive for further investment.

A favourable \nsocio-institutional environment is, in its turn, prone to the development of outward connections, \nextra-regional interdependencies, and global network relations. \n \nThis process creates progressively higher mountains in the world economic geography. However, \nthe whole system is highly dynamic and big radical shifts in the technological frontier may allow \u2013 \nas in any active tectonic period \u2013 new windows of opportunity to be opened (and others to be \nclosed) thus allowing new cities and agglomerations to emerge in the global landscape but, at the \nsame time, condemning other areas to economic decline.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nFriedman has created a powerful metaphor to describe the effects of the ongoing change of the \nworld economy. According to him, technological change, in general, and the advances in \ninformation and communications technology (ICT), in particular, have, over the past three decades, \nradically flattened our world. Technological change has not only been the single most important \nforce behind the process of economic growth but it has also enabled the \u201cwidening, deepening and \nspeeding up of worldwide interconnectedness in all aspects of contemporary social life, from the \ncultural to the criminal, the financial to the spiritual\u201d (Held et al. 1999: 2) that may be referred to as \nglobalization. The progressive liberalisation of the movements of capital and labour, the sharp \nreduction in the cost of international and intercontinental travel, as well as the purportedly \nprogressive convergence towards \u2018global\u2019 cultural models, and, above all, the frictionless \navailability of information and knowledge determine an ever-decreasing influence of both physical \ndistance and the underlying contextual conditions upon economic interactions. Faster and cheaper \naccess to information and technology has also led to a restructuring of how we conduct business all \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

ISSN 1752-1378 - doi: 10.1093\/cjres\/rsn011 \n29 \nover the world and contributed to dismantle the barriers that anchored economic activity to specific \nlocations. The consequence of all these changes is a better world: a world where neither the distance \nbetween the economic actors \u2013 be it cognitive, organisational, social, institutional or geographical \u2013  \nnor the contextual condition in which their interactions take place would matter any longer; a world \nwhere information \u201conce available only to the few would be available to the many, instantly and (in \nterms of distribution costs) inexpensively\u201d (Cairncross 1997: 4); a world where every economy has \na similar chance of exploiting and maximizing the opportunities of global interaction, regardless of \nits geographical location and its indigenous conditions. In brief, a world where more and more \npeople are empowered by this access to information and become more conscious of the need to \nengage and compete as individuals in an integrated world. For Friedman the world is flat and, as a \nresult, we are all better off. \n \nAs Friedman himself acknowledges, the empirical evidence available does nevertheless not support \nhis vision of the world. \u201cThe bad news in Africa today, as well as rural India, China, Latina \nAmerica and plenty of dark corners of the developed world, is that there are hundreds of millions of \npeople who have no hope and therefore no chance of making it to the middle class\u201d (Friedman \n2005: 462). Yet, despite acknowledging this in his \u2018Unflat world\u2019 chapter (one chapter out of 15), \nFriedman still falls victim of his own metaphor.  \n \nHowever, the sheer evidence that not all people and territories can benefit equally from the changes \nthat Globalization 3.0 brings about ends by forcing him to describe the geography of the world in a \nmore nuanced and perhaps more realistic way: \u201cthere\u2019s not just the flat world and the unflat world. \nMany people live in the twilight zone between the two\u201d (Friedman 2005: 470). And the reality is \nprecisely that, the world is not flat. The powerful tectonic forces linked to globalization are shaping \na world where there are winners and losers; where the winners are precisely those that can \nmaximize the opportunities for innovation, economic activity, and growth that real time access to \n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.

The information revolution has opened new windows of opportunity so that new \nactors may emerge in the global arena while others have been closed, provoking the relative decline \nof some previously leading regions. In addition, some economies have remained marginal in the \nworld economic panorama. The new technological regime is producing a thoroughgoing \nreorganisation of the world economy, rather than a global trend towards similar development levels \nmade possible by ubiquitous economically productive knowledge. In this new geography of the \nworld large cities emerge as the real winners, as they provide the right environment to allow \neconomic agents to thrive. So the irony is that the flat world is full of high peaks. \n \nAnd not everyone is capable of climbing these high peaks. Just as the average citizen of the world \nwould not even dream of climbing the Everest, only professional mountaineers \u2013 those who are \nreally being empowered \u2013 dare to venture into the peaks created by globalization. As in any elite \nsport discipline, the real players, the real mountaineers, are just a chosen few, mainly made of \nmultinational firms and high-flying executives. Most of the rest of us just have to be content with \nwatching the mountains from a distance and hope that we would eventually benefit from their \nascent.\n Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Mountains in a flat world: why proximity still matters for the location of economic \nactivity.
