INTRODUCTION \nTurbulent intermittency is an important issue for many fundamental and practical \nflows. For example inhomogeneous turbulent free jets, the ignition of turbulent flows, \nboundary layers and shear layers can exhibit varying levels of turbulent intermittency \ndepending on the conditions adopted for the configurations. A turbulent free round jet \nissuing from a circular orifice displays intermittent behaviour in the region near the \nouter edge of the flow and thus can be considered as one of the simple prototype \nproblems for turbulent intermittency. High Reynolds number turbulent jets commonly \nappear in many engineering application areas such as combustion, propulsion, \naeroacoustics, etc. Literature includes various publications which reveal many key \nphysical insights into turbulent jets, such as mixing of active and passive scalars, self-\nsimilarity behaviour, skewness and correlations etc. (see [1] for example). A series of \nintermittency investigations have also been carried out for such shear flows. For \nexample, Townsend [2] investigated the velocity intermittency in a turbulent wake, \nand Becker et al. [3] have presented intermittency data for the scalar in turbulent jets. \nWygnanski and Fiedler [4] also obtained intermittency data for a self-preserving high \nReynolds number axisymmetric turbulent jet. Bilger et al. [5] investigated the \ntemperature intermittency using a probability density function approach while Shefer \nand Dibble [6] reported intermittency as a function of time for the mixture fraction for \na propane round jet. Theoretical analyses of turbulent intermittency have also been \ncarried out by Libby [7], Dopazo [8], Chevray and Tutu [9] and many others. \n \nAlthough accurate numerical calculations of turbulent flows in complex practical \nsituations using engineering models remains a somewhat elusive goal, it has become \npossible to study prototype problems by means of numerical simulation to help us \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4 \nidentify the physical insights which are often not possible to discover from available \nexperimental techniques. Therefore state-of-art numerical tools can be used to \nsimulate intermittency while available experimental data can be used principally for \naccuracy tests of the prediction. With recent advances in computer processing \ntechniques and speed, applications of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large \nEddy Simulation (LES) techniques have become feasible especially in more \nfundamental investigations.  In DNS, all the length and time scales of turbulence are \ndirectly resolved and hence no turbulence models are required.  In LES, large scales \nof turbulence are directly computed with the effect of the small scales requiring a \nturbulence model.  \n \nIn the last few years comprehensive DNS and LES studies have been carried out with \nmuch success for turbulent jets. The first DNS of a spatially evolving turbulent jet \nwas done by Boersma [10].  Freund et al. [11] carried out the first DNS calculations \nfor a compressible supersonic jet and estimated the overall sound pressure levels for \naeroacoustic calculations.  Lubbers et al. [12] extended Boersma\u2019s work and \nsimulated the mixing of a passive scalar using DNS. Babu and Mahesh [13] \nperformed DNS of a spatially evolving round jet with upstream entrainment near the \ninflow nozzle and demonstrated the importance of allowing inflow entrainment \nparticularly for the studies of near field behaviour.  Babu and Mahesh [14] further \nextended their DNS calculations to study passive scalar mixing for a turbulent round \njet which discussed the convective and diffusive dominant regions.  \n \nThe LES technique allows the simulation of higher Reynolds number jets and many \nsuch investigations have now been conducted successfully using the affordable \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5 \ncomputing power, eg. see recent reviews [15-16]. Furthermore, Mankbadi et al. [17] \nhave simulated the structure of a supersonic round jet and its sound field using LES. \nBoersma and Lele [18] have performed LES computations for a compressible round \njet, while Yuan et al. [19] reported a series of LES calculations of a round jet issuing \nnormally into a cross flow.   \n \nThe study of turbulent intermittency is important for many applications such as \nboundary layer transition in modern turbines and aerofoils, ignition of combustion \ndevices and environmental emissions. However, the majority of existing turbulence \nmodels were originally derived for fully developed flows and thus exhibit some \ndeficiencies in the inhomogeneous intermittent regions near the outer edge of such \nflows which contain regions of irrotational flow. To date only a little work has been \ndone to simulate the intermittency fields of high Reynolds number turbulent round \njets and most previous numerical investigations have been carried out using the \nclassical Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. For example, a \u03b5\u2212k  \nmodel based intermittency model was developed by Byggstoyl and Kollomann [20] \nand Kollmann and Janicka [21] studied the intermittency using a transported \nprobability density function (PDF). Cho and Chung [22] developed a more \neconomical intermittency model by incorporating an intermittency transport equation \ninto an already existing \u03b5\u2212k turbulence model. Several groups extended the Cho and \nChung [22] intermittency model and applied this to different applications such as an \naxisymmetric plume [23], and a plane plume [24]. Pope [25] also calculated \nintermittency using a velocity-composition transported PDF and Savill [26] discussed \nthe development of a Reynolds stress intermittency transport model for predicting \nintermittency in transitional flows which was subsequently used successfully by \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6 \nAlvani [27] to improve PDF predictions for pre-ignition mixing of combusting \nignitability.  \n \nTo further improve the understanding of the intermittency process for more \npractically oriented engineering problems, it is important to gain more insights into \nthe turbulent intermittency especially for high Reynolds number flows such as \nturbulent jets. This paper has two objectives. The first objective is to investigate the \nintermittency for a high Reynolds number round jet and the second objective is to \nstudy the intermittency for a jet with a recirculation zone in the near field using the \nlarge eddy simulation technique. Therefore the present work aims to improve our \nknowledge of LES based intermittency prediction for turbulent round jets with and \nwithout a recirculation zone, with a view to improvement of LES based sub-grid \nmodels to tackle the intermittency explicitly \n \nThis paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we discuss the governing equations \nand modelling. In section 3, we give a detailed description about the numerical setup \nfor simulations. Section 4 first discusses the comparisons of LES results with \nexperimental data and then analyse the probability density functions and intermittency \nprofiles for both velocity and passive scalar fields. Finally, we end the paper with \nconclusions in section 5.   \n \n \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 7 \n2.

SIMULATION DETAILS \n3.1. Numerical discretisation methods \nThe mathematical formulations for mass, momentum and passive scalar are \nnumerically solved by means of a pressure based finite volume method using the large \neddy simulation code PUFFIN developed by Kirkpatrick et al. [30-31]. The code has \nbeen recently parallelised by Kirkpatrick [32] and the results presented in this paper \nhave been obtained using the parallel version. Spatial discretisation is achieved using \na non-uniform Cartesian grid with a staggered cell arrangement.  Second order central \ndifferences (CDS) are used for the spatial discretisation of all terms in both the \nmomentum equation and the pressure correction equation. The diffusion terms of the \npassive scalar transport equation are also discretised using the second order CDS. The \nconvection term of the passive scalar transport equation is discretised using a third \norder QUICK with ULTRA flux limiter [33] to ensure that the solution remains \nmonotonic. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 9 \nThe momentum and scalar transport equations are integrated in time using a hybrid \nsecond order Adams-Bashforth\/Adams-Moulton scheme. The pressure correction \nmethod of Van Kan [34] and Bell et al. [35] which involves solving an equation for \npressure correction rather than the pressure is used for the present work. The solution \nto this equation is then used to project the approximate velocity field that results from \nthe integration of the momentum equations onto a subset of divergence free velocity \nfields. The time step is varied to ensure that the maximum Courant number \niio xtuC \u2206\u2206= remains approximately constant where ix\u2206  is the cell width, t\u2206  is the \ntime step and iu  is the velocity component in the ix  direction. The solution is \nadvanced with time steps corresponding to a Courant number in the range of =oC 0.3 \nto 0.5.  A Gauss-Seidel solver is used to solve the system of algebraic equations \nresulting from the numerical discretisation of momentum and passive scalar transport \nequations.  The BiCGStab method with a Zebra Gauss-Siedel preconditioner using \nsuccessive overrelaxation (SOR) and Chebyshev acceleration is used to solve the \nalgebraic equations resulting from the discretisation of pressure correction equation.  \n \n3.2. Computational geometry, domain, and boundary conditions \nThe simulated round jet configuration has been studied experimentally by Garry and \nHolt as a part of a wider investigation of initial jet mixing relevant to the \nenvironmental impacts of aircraft engine efflux [36]. Their investigation considered a \nsingle, 6.35D mm=  diameter jet, with bulk exit velocity of 23 m\/s and free-stream \nvelocity of 5 m\/s, to which a neutrally buoyant gas was added. In addition, they also \nconsidered a jet with a circular bluff body at the inlet plane with diameters \n1 25D mm= and 2 50D mm=  respectively. Our simulations for all three configurations \nemployed a non-uniform Cartesian grid covering the full range of experimental \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 10 \nmeasuring stations extending 210 jet diameters (D) axially and 25D radially, with a \n2.4 million point grid distributed as 240( ) 100 100axially \u00d7 \u00d7 . Fig. 1 (a-c) show the \nLES snapshots of filtered axial velocities for round jet, round jet with circular bluff \nbody of diameter 1 25D mm= and round jet with circular bluff body of \ndiameter 2 50D mm= . Each figure contains marked axial locations which have been \nconsidered for intermittency calculation.  \n \nThe inlet jet nozzle mean velocity distributions were specified using a standard 1\/7th \npower law velocity profile: \n                                      \n7\n1\n)1( jetbulkjet rrCUU \u2212=                                                    (7) \nHere the constant C=1.32 is consistent with a fully developed turbulent pipe flow \ncondition upstream of the nozzle exit. An appropriate, 10% turbulence intensity was \nimposed by superimposing fluctuations on the mean velocity profiles generated by a \nGaussian random number generator. A free slip boundary condition was applied to the \ndomain walls (except for a case in which a solid wall was substituted at the lower \nboundary surface). The upstream boundary was specified as a multiple inlet; while at \nthe downstream outlet, a zero normal gradient boundary was employed. \n \nThe simulations have been carried out in both serial and parallel environments, with \nthe computational grid distributed over to up to 10 processors using axial direction \npartitioning on the Cranfield HP Supercomputer, Astral. \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 11 \n4. RESULTS, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION  \nThis section presents a detailed description of the computed pdf distributions and \nradial variation of intermittency fields for velocity and passive scalar for the round jet, \nround jet with circular bluff body of diameter 1D and round jet with circular bluff \nbody of diameter 2D .  However, since validation of the LES predicted velocity and \npassive scalar fields is necessary before we can discuss any physical insights obtained \nregarding turbulent intermittency, first we discuss the comparison between LES \nresults and experimental measurements for the round jet. Subsequent sections discuss \nthe computed probability density functions and external intermittency profiles of both \nvelocity and passive scalar fields at different axial and radial locations. \n \n4.1. Time-averaged calculations  \nFig. 2 (left-hand side) shows the resulting LES predictions for the mean velocity field \nat different axial locations compared to experimental measurements. It can be seen \nthat the streamwise mean velocity profile development, both in magnitude and shape, \nis in good agreement with that measured throughout nearly the whole of the flow \ndomain. There is just a small underprediction of the centreline value at 15 and 30D, \nwhich may indicate a need for preferentially higher axial grid resolution where such \nrapid variations are occurring in the stream direction. \n \nThe distribution of the rms (root mean square) axial velocity is also seen to be \ncorrectly reproduced by the simulations in Fig. 2 (right-hand side), but their peak \nmagnitude is somewhat overpredicted. This is not inconsistent with the use of a \nsimple turbulence eddy viscosity sub-grid scale modelling and may well reflect the \nneed for intermittency-scaling of the sub-grid scale contribution and for which it is \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 12 \nnecessary to study the intermittency for both the velocity and scalar near and far \nfields. \n \nA comparison of the LES results and experimental data for the mean passive scalar \nfield is shown in Fig. 3. In this case, the experimental data was limited to a smaller \naxial range of stations due to difficulties detecting the jet efflux tracer gas in the far \nfield. However it appears that the width and therefore spreading rate of the scalar is \nparticularly well captured by the LES.   \n \n4.2. Intermittency field studies \n4.2.1 Intermittency calculation \nThe physical interpretation of intermittency can be divided into two parts namely \nexternal intermittency and internal intermittency.  The interfacial distinction between \nturbulent-bearing fluid (e.g. the jet or the boundary layer) and non-turbulent fluid \n(free stream) is referred as the external intermittency. Internal intermittency refers to \nlocal fluctuations of turbulence intensity (the intermittency in an inertial range of a \nturbulent flow).  Both external and internal intermittency can be seen as multiscale \nspatiotemporal random processes. Mathematically external intermittency can be \nexpressed using an indicator function with the value of one in turbulent regions and \nzero in non-turbulent (laminar) regions. The indicator function represents the fraction \nof the time interval during which a point is inside the turbulent fluid.  \n \nGenerally, a statistical tool is required for the external intermittency calculation and \nthe probability density function (pdf) plays an important role in this regard. For \nexample, a normalised histogram method tested by Andreotti and Douady [37] can be \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 13 \nused to determine the pdf.  Thus the intermittency value can be calculated using a \nsummation of probability values for a given threshold value  \n \nSince various techniques are available to calculate external intermittency, here we \nemployed two approaches \u2013 the first method based on previous computational studies \nand the second method based on experimental studies. The first method was originally \nproposed by Schefer and Dibble [6].  In their method, the intermittency for a \nparticular variable can be calculated from pdfs in which we assumed that the pdf is \nsmooth at the scale of one histogram bin. In our investigation we considered 8000 \nmeasurements at each spatial location with 50 bins over 3 \u03c3\u2212  limits of data are \nconsidered. Therefore the normalised PDF\u2019s can be written as  \n         ( )1\n0\n1P f df =\u0007                                                                               (8) \nThe intermittency value \u03b3  (gamma) can be calculated from the probability values \nwith respect to considered threshold value such that  \n           ( )thP f f\u03b3 = >        (9) \nThe second method, which chooses the fluctuation of the variable (for example \nvelocity fluctuation in velocity intermittency calculation), is an approach more widely \nused by many experimental investigations. Here the intermittency factor is defined as \nthe fraction of time that the fluctuation of the variable itself is greater than a threshold.  \nFor any variable\u03c6 , the flow is considered to be turbulent if the fluctuation| | th\u03c6 \u03c6\u2032 > . \nThe ratio of the time the flow is turbulent to the total time then provides the \nintermittency factor.  \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 14 \n4.2.2 Intermittency of a jet  \nThis section discusses the probability density function (pdf) distributions and radial \nvariation of intermittency first for the axial velocity and then for the passive scalar. \nThe pdf distributions of the axial velocity at equidistant radial locations (r\/D=0.0, 1.0, \n2.0 and 3.0) at axial location x\/D=20 are presented in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 4 \n(r\/D=0.0), the evolution of the pdf on the jet centreline exhibits a Gaussian like \ndistribution. However the pdf shape becomes less well structured with increased \nradial distance and shifts towards a delta function at the furthest radial locations, see \nFig. 4 (r\/D=3.0). The intermediate region Fig. 4 (r\/D=1.0,r\/D=2.0) can be identified as \na highly intermittent region where we can assume less structured pdf distributions \noccur because of frequent changes from rotational to irrotational velocity fluctuations.  \n \nThe radial profiles of the axial velocity intermittency calculated for two different \nthreshold values based on method 1 are shown in Fig. 5. Since the axial velocity of \nthe jet in the co-flow lies between 5 m\/s and 23 m\/s we chose to employ two threshold \nvalues of 5.1,6.1thu =  m\/s in the first method for the analysis of threshold sensitivity. \nAs seen in Fig.5 the intermittency values show little difference, however, the laminar \nregion shifts more towards the centreline (as indicated by zero intermittency values) \nas a result of the higher threshold value.   \n \nFig.6. shows the velocity intermittency profiles calculated using methods 1 and 2.  \nSince we already compared the sensitivity of the threshold for method 1 (Fig.5), here \nwe have used a threshold of 6.1 \/thu m s= . In method 2 we selected a threshold for the \naxial velocity fluctuation ' 0.5 \/u m s= typically used for the experimental studies, \nnamely approximately 10% of the peak value. The calculated profiles for the near \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 15 \nfield (x\/D=10, 20) and far field (x\/D=30, 40) axial locations show the variation of \nintermittency for corresponding methods and threshold values.  Although we could \nget similar values for intermittency with both methods by adjusting threshold values, \nour intention here is to demonstrate the prediction of external intermittency using two \nnoted methods for selected thresholds values.  \n \nThe pdf distributions of the passive scalar at an axial location x\/D=20 are shown in \nFig. 7. A similar method to that discussed in the velocity intermittency section was \nagain applied to determine the probability density functions of the scalar. Fig.7 \n(r\/D=0.0) shows the variation of the pdf on the centreline which indicates a Gaussian \ntype distribution. Again, pdf shapes become more irregular at intermediate regions, \nFig. 7 (r\/D=1.0, r\/D=2.0) and then shift to a delta function at the furthest radial \nlocation, Fig. 7 (r\/D=3.0).   \n \nFig.8 shows passive scalar intermittency profiles at axial locations x\/D=10, 20, 30 and \n40 obtained from two different threshold values 0.05thf = and 0.06 using method 1 \n[6].  The comparison indicates the laminar region (zero intermittency value) at a lesser \nradial distance for the higher threshold value.  The comparisons of the passive scalar \nintermittency obtained from methods 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 9. The first method \nagain used the Schefer and Dibble [6] technique with threshold value of  0.06thf =  \nwhile the second method considered the passive scalar fluctuation with a threshold \nvalue of ' 0.01f =  which is close to 10% of the peak variance. It is interesting to note \nthat both methods demonstrate similar variation of intermittency at near field axial \nlocations (x\/D=10, 20, 30) for the considered threshold values. However, in addition \nto these findings it is also important to make a comment about the variation of the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 16 \npresented scalar intermittency results with respect to available experimentally based \nintermittency findings. Despite using different threshold values, our analysis indicated \ngood consistency for the distribution of passive scalar intermittency with the results of \nSchefer and Dibble [6]. Furthermore, the decay is similar at near field axial locations \nand the differences only become large in the far field region. Therefore the present \nfindings certainly add a new dimension to the available intermittency literature \nespecially for the round jet.   \n \n4.2.3 Intermittency of a jet with bluff body \nTo relate pdfs and intermittency findings for the round jet to more complex \nrecirculating flows similar to practical engineering applications requires further \nanalysis. In this section we fulfil the second objective of the work and discuss the \nvariation of pdfs and external intermittency in the presence of near field flow \nrecirculation zone formed by a circular bluff body.  The objective of introducing a \ncircular bluff body is to study the variation of external intermittency due to the \ntorroidal shaped recirculation zone formed by the sudden expansion at the bluff body \nwall. Here we consider two different bluff body diameters and results will be analysed \nfor the variation of intermittency of both velocity and passive scalar in the presence of \ndifferent sized torroidal recirculation zones compared to the jet.   \n \nA comparison of velocity pdfs for a jet with and without a bluff body at equidistant \nradial locations r\/D=0.0, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 at x\/D=20 is shown in Fig.10. The \ndifferences between the pdfs of velocity are wider near the centreline due to the \nformation of the recirculation zone for the bluff body jets, but show similar behaviour \nat the furthest radial locations. The Gaussian type distribution is seen near the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 17 \ncentreline also for the bluff body jets and eventually converts into a delta function at \nfurthest radial locations. The differences between the pdfs of velocity near the \ncentreline provide an indication of the intermittent behaviour associated with the bluff \nbody stabilised recirculation zone. As seen in Fig.11 the pdfs of the passive scalar also \nshow differences close to the jet centreline and follow a similar behaviour to the \nvelocity field. The changes in the bluff body diameter ( 1D and 2D ) affect the size of \nthe recirculation zone and hence the variation in pdfs of both velocity and scalar fields \nand thus we can expect deviation of the intermittency value with respect to the jet for \na given threshold value.  \n  \nFig.12 shows the radial profiles of velocity intermittency at x\/D=10, 20 and 30. Here \nwe used the threshold value of 6.1 \/thu m s= . As expected, the variation of the \nintermittency values indicates the effect of the bluff body on velocity intermittency \nwith respect to a given threshold value. The introduction of a recirculation zone due to \na circular bluff body reducdes the intermittency value on the centreline in the near \nfield and thus indicates the variation of turbulence fluctuations. However, the radial \nprofiles for all three cases follow the similar shape distribution in the near field \n(x\/D=10) and start to deviate in the intermediate region (x\/D=20) and also at the \ndownstream limit of the bluff body stabilised recirculation zone (x\/D=30).  As seen in \nFig.12 (x\/D=30.0), the velocity intermittency shows rapid variation with respect to \nbluff body diameter which changes the axial extent of the recirculation zone. \nTherefore the velocity intermittency profile provides useful details for the variation of \nintermittency for a round jet with and without a circular bluff body.  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 18 \nThe radial profiles of scalar intermittency at x\/D=10, 20 and 30 are shown in Fig.13. \nHere we used a threshold value of value of 0.06thf = . The scalar intermittency \nprofiles shows similar variation at all three axial locations with slight differences \napparent at x\/D=10 and 20.   \n \nWe believe that the comparison plots of pdf distributions and intermittency of the \nturbulent round jet for both velocity and passive scalar, with and without a torroidal \nshaped near field recirculation zone provide contributions to the established literature \nthat are of both intrinsic and practical value. Methodology and data established in the \npresent investigation could be used to determine the characteristic features of active \nscalars especially in combustion applications. The present findings are particularly \nrelevant to bluff body stabilised flames in both premixed and non-premixed \ncombustion applications, and thus could also potentially be used to analyse \ninstantaneous behaviour of active scalars in the context of large eddy simulation. \nSince we used the dynamics sub-grid LES model the variation of intermittency with \nrespect to inlet conditions provides further useful input concerning the instantaneous \nflow characteristic in the presence of a wall surface and so provides additional detail \nof near wall behaviour. Therefore the results discussed here could also be helpful for \nnear wall sub-grid model development.  \n \nThere are number of other important issues identified in this investigation which \nshould be considered for a next phase of investigation. A natural continuation of the \npresent work is the study of intermittency by solving an intermittency transport \nequation. In particular, it would be instructive to solve a modified intermittency \ntransport equation in the LES sub-grid scale modelling that has been originally \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 19 \ndeveloped in a RANS context [26]. An intermittency factor could simply be included \ninto Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model once determined from the intermittency \ntransport equation. Alternatively however, a dynamic Smagorinsky model could be \nconsidered in which the degree to which the large scale space filtering could be \ndetermined using local box estimation directly. This then can be used to calculate \neffect of intermittency on sub-grid scale eddy viscosity. It is well known that the LES \nsub-grid models assume the existence of a cascade process and therefore sub-grid \nscale physical process conditioned from the resolved scale physical process depend on \nthe filtered scale. However, the cascade process might not completely valid for high \nReynolds number free shear flows where we experience high intermittency behaviour \nespecially in the region of a viscous super layer. In such situations, an alternative \nmodelling strategy such as a level set approach perhaps could be useful and thus also \nneeds to be considered in future modelling. \n \n \n5.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has presented modelling of turbulent intermittency of high Reynolds \nnumber round jets using a large eddy simulation technique.  First the accuracy of the \nnumerical results was tested with available experimental data and then analysed for \nthe intermittent variation from turbulent to laminar flow for both velocity and passive \nscalar fields.  \n \nGenerally, our LES results are in good agreement with experimental data for both \nvelocity and passive scalar fields. The axial decay and radial spread of the axial \nvelocity and passive scalar are found to closely match the experimental results.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 20 \nHaving established the accuracy of the LES results, investigation was then further \nextended to analyse the intermittent behaviour of the jet flow with and without a bluff \nbody using the LES database. Derived probability density function distributions for \nboth velocity and passive scalar indicate these change from Gaussian distributions to a \ndelta function with increased radial distance.  The intermittency factor calculated \nusing two different methods shows similar variation at different axial locations and \ndifferent threshold values demonstrate the regional changes between turbulent and \nlaminar values. Adding a circular bluff body to a jet changes the structure of the pdfs \nfor both velocity and passive scalar fields. In particular, the intermittency values of \nvelocity indicate differences in the near field close to the jet centreline and also close \nto the downstream limit of the recirculation zone.  \n \nIn this study we have employed a standard dynamic sub-grid model without inclusion \nof any specific allowance for such intermittency effects. Further work is necessary to \ninclude the effects of intermittency on the sub-grid modelling of large eddy \nsimulation, which should improve sub-grid models for the application of LES to such \ninhomogeneous free shear flows.  \n \n \nAcknowledgment: We are grateful to the EPSRC for their financial support under \ngrant EP\/E036945\/1 on the Modelling and Simulation of Intermittent Flows.
