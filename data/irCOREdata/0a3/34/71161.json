A large database of Solar Proton Events (SPE)\nfrom the period 1995 to 2001 is used to investigate the rela-\ntionship between proton flux at geostationary orbit and Cos-\nmic Noise Absorption (CNA) in the auroral zone. The effect\nof solar illumination on this relationship is studied in a sta-\ntistical manner by deriving correlation coefficients of integral\nflux and absorption as a function of solar zenith angle limit,\nthus both an upper limit on the angle and the best correlated\nintegral flux of protons are determined (energies in excess of\n10 MeV). By considering the correlation of various energy\nranges (from the GOES 8 differential proton flux channels)\nwith CNA the range of proton energies for which the rela-\ntionship between flux and absorption is best defined is estab-\nlished (15 to 44 MeV), thus confirming previous predictions\nabout which proton energy ranges are most effective in giv-\ning rise to absorption during Polar Cap Absorption (PCA)\nevents. An empirical relationship between the square root\nof the integral proton flux and the absorption, measured by\nthe imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (IRIS), is determined and\ndepartures from linearity and possible causes are examined.\nVariations in spectral \u201chardness\u201d and in collision frequency\nare demonstrated not to be significant causes of the observed\ndepartures from a linear relationship. Geomagnetic activity\nmay be a significant factor in changing the relationship be-\ntween the absorption and the square root of the integral pro-\nton flux, although it is concluded that the cause is likely to be\nmore complex than a straightforward dependence on Kp. It\nis suggested that the most significant factor might be a bias\nin the absorption estimates imposed by the presence of So-\nlar Radio Emission (SRE), which is not routinely measured\nat the operating frequency of IRIS, making its precise effect\ndifficult to quantify. SRE is known to be most prevalent un-\nder conditions of high solar activity, such as those that might\ngive rise to solar proton events.\nKey words. Ionosphere (particle precipitation; solar radia-\ntion and cosmic ray effects; polar ionosphere)\nCorrespondence to: A. J. Kavanagh\n(kavanagh@ucar.edu)\n1 Introduction\nSolar Proton Events (SPE), also known as Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events, originate during active solar condi-\ntions, though arguments continue as to whether the parti-\ncles are energised during the release of the X-ray flare or\nthrough acceleration by solar wind shock fronts driven by\ncoronal mass ejections (Krucker and Lin, 2000). Regard-\nless of which theory is correct, or whether it is some com-\nbination of the two, SPE are major (though relatively in-\nfrequent) space weather phenomena that can produce haz-\nardous effects in the near-Earth space environment. Protons\nin the MeV energy range are the dominant species in SPE,\nalthough lower fluxes of heavier ions (e.g. He, Fe and O in\nvarious charge states) and electrons are also present. The\nionospheric effects of SPE were first identified following the\nmajor event of 23 February 1956 (Bailey, 1957), when large\nsignal losses on high-latitude VHF communication circuits\nwere detected. The increased ionisation at low altitudes also\nresulted in the sudden disturbance of phase and amplitude on\nLF and VLF radio signals (Allen et al., 1957; Belrose et al.,\n1956; Ellison and Reid, 1956; Pierce, 1956). Around this\ntime, Japanese researchers (Hakura et al., 1958) described\npolar cap effects observed before major geomagnetic storms\nbased on observations of blackouts recorded by ionospheric\nsounding equipment.\nEvents similar to that of February 1956 were found to oc-\ncur to the order of one per month. The protons gain access\nto the ionosphere through the polar caps and due to the high\nenergies involved can cross closed field lines into the auroral\nzone; thus, these events became known as periods of Polar\nCap Absorption (PCA) and the principal method of observ-\ning them is through the use of a riometer (Relative Iono-\nspheric Opacity Meter using Extra-Terrestrial Electromag-\nnetic Radiation), which measures the absorption of the cos-\nmic radio noise at a given high frequency, usually between\n20 and 60 MHz.\n1134 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption\nSince the cosmic noise absorption (CNA) is directly linked\nto the precipitating flux of solar protons, several workers\nhave attempted to derive empirical relationships between the\ntwo parameters. Measurements of proton flux have been ob-\ntained through the use of rocket (Fichtel et al., 1963) and\nballoon instruments (Bailey, 1964) and compared with day-\ntime observations of absorption at 30 MHz. In 1960 proton\nintensities greater than 30 MeV were measured by detec-\ntors on the Explorer 7 satellite and compared with data from\n27.6 MHz riometers at College, Alaska and Thule (Van Allen\net al., 1964). A relationship was derived linking the integral\nflux with the square of the absorption but the ratio of the two\nvaried considerably during several events. Reid (1970) de-\ntermined that the best correlation between integral fluxes and\nthe CNA during the event of 5 February 1965 was for protons\nwith energies in excess of 20 MeV. More complex methods\nhave also been proposed, involving the derivation of proton\nflux spectra and the use of ionisation models (e.g. Adams\nand Masley, 1965). Juday and Adams (1969) determined\nthat the ratio of integral flux to the squared absorption was\nleast sensitive to model proton spectra for a threshold energy\nof 11 MeV. Potemra (1972) determined that the best relation-\nship was obtained for a threshold energy of 7 MeV based on\ncalculations from events in the period 1960 to 1967 and us-\ning power-law proton spectra. It was further concluded that\nthe daytime polar cap absorption is most affected by 15 MeV\nprotons, although a lack of differential flux measurements\nmade this impossible to verify.\nIn this paper we return to the simple method of comparing\nthe satellite integral fluxes with the cosmic noise absorption\nin the auroral zone to determine an empirical relationship\nbetween the two parameters with the aim of demonstrating\nhow unreliable the technique can be without consideration of\ngeomagnetic and, particularly, solar effects. Only daytime\nobservations are used, since the complex chemistry of the\nD-region leads to significant electron depletion at night and\nthe determination and implementation of recombination co-\nefficients are beyond the scope of this work. The day\/night\ndependence is illustrated by comparing the solar zenith angle\nwith the correlation coefficient of the absorption and integral\nproton flux for a number of threshold angles. It is shown\nthat an empirical relationship based on observed absorption\nis subject to severe constraints; in particular, the effects of\nhigh geomagnetic activity and solar radio emission (SRE)\nare shown to contaminate the empirical approach, leading to\nover- and underestimation of the absorption, respectively. It\nis concluded that any empirical method must be treated care-\nfully and that suitable ionisation models should be employed\nto gain a more realistic measure of the PCA from satellite ob-\nservations. Riometer observations of PCA during high solar\nactivity must also be handled with care, since it is estimated\nthat the observed signal can deviate from the true ionospheric\nabsorption by a few decibels.\n2 Theory and Instrumentation\n2.1 Integral flux and absorption\nTraditionally, auroral absorption is taken to occur at heights\nclose to 90 km and is caused by the precipitation of electrons\nwith energies in excess of a few keV. During PCA the ma-\njority of radio absorption occurs at lower altitudes due to the\nprecipitation of high-energy solar protons (>1 MeV). The at-\nmospheric penetration of these particles is much greater than\nthat of typical auroral electrons, with 100 MeV protons de-\npositing energy at altitudes around 30 km (Reid, 1974). A\nrelationship between a mono-energetic flux of particles and\nan ionisation profile in the atmosphere has been described by\nRees (1989) and for a given particle energy the ion-electron\nproduction rate is proportional to the incident flux of charged\nparticles.\nThe D-layer of the ionosphere can be represented as a\nChapman alpha layer with an effective recombination coef-\nficient that includes the attachment of electrons with neutral\nspecies to form negative ions, as well as the recombination\nwith positive ions. In this case the production rate (and thus\nthe flux) is proportional to the square of the electron con-\ncentration (e.g. Hargreaves, 1995). For slowly varying re-\ncombination rates CNA is approximately proportional to the\nheight-integrated product of the electron density and the ef-\nfective collision frequency (e.g. Hargreaves, 1969). By con-\nsidering an integral flux of protons, which deposits across a\nrange of altitudes, the height-integrated absorption is propor-\ntional to the square root of the flux as long as the collision fre-\nquency profile does not change rapidly with time and the ab-\nsorption is observed on a constant frequency. If only daytime\nvalues are considered and the twilight transition is neglected,\nwe implicitly assume a constant recombination coefficient.\nThis approach mirrors the assumptions made by Patterson et\nal. (2001), who simplified the recombination coefficient into\nthree cases: illuminated ionosphere, non-illuminated iono-\nsphere and high altitudes (>85 km).\n2.2 Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS)\nFor this study CNA data have been taken from the Imag-\ning Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nFinland (Browne et al., 1995), located in the auroral zone\n(69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E geographic coordinates). Due to the\nconfiguration of the magnetosphere and the existence of the\nmagnetotail, high-energy protons gain virtually uniform ac-\ncess to the polar cap (Reid and Sauer, 1967) and only the\nlowest energies are prevented from crossing closed field lines\ninto the auroral zone. Thus, IRIS measures the vast majority\nof protons responsible for the PCA.\nIRIS is operated by Lancaster University (UK) and has\nbeen recording data since September 1994. It is based on a\ndesign from the University of Maryland (Detrick and Rosen-\nberg, 1990) and consists of a phased array of 64 dipole an-\ntennae that generate 49 (7\u00d77) narrow beams. The whole ar-\nray is sampled every second and data recording is arranged\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption 1135\nsuch that each second is divided into eight time slots. The\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS uses the eighth time slot to record the output\nfor a co-located wide beam antenna, with a beam width of\n\u224894\u25e6. This is similar to the design of the original and most\ncommon variety of riometer (Little and Leinbach, 1959),\nwhich uses a broad beam to monitor the cosmic radio noise.\nSince PCA events tend to be spatially uniform it is unneces-\nsary to use a narrow beam of the riometer, which would be\nuseful for distinguishing the absorption from narrow features\n(e.g. Collis et al., 1996); thus, the data presented in this paper\ncome from the IRIS wide beam. However, the broad receiv-\ning beam pattern of these instruments leads to the detection\nof absorption from a range of angles from the zenith, leading\nto an overestimation of the true ionospheric absorption. Har-\ngreaves and Detrick (2002) have developed corrections to the\nwide beam of IRIS that depend on the observed absorption;\nthese have been applied to the data presented here.\nAlthough the instrument records data every second, for\nthis experiment these values have been averaged over 5 min\nsince PCA tend to be slowly varying. The Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS\nhas an advantage over riometers that have been used previ-\nously to develop empirical relationships with the proton flux,\nin that it operates at 38.2 MHz, which is a protected astron-\nomy frequency, and so is theoretically resistant to contami-\nnation from HF transmitters.\nSince the riometer actually monitors the level of cosmic\nnoise, some measure of the background signal prior to at-\ntenuation is needed to account for the absorption. In the\nIRIS system this is accomplished by generating a \u201cquiet-\nday-curve\u201d (QDC) based upon at least 14 days of IRIS ob-\nservations. The basic technique is described in Browne et\nal. (1995), although the algorithm has been modified some-\nwhat to operate at the same resolution at which the instru-\nment records data and to remove the bulk of the solar radio\ncontributions from the QDC. The use of 14 days of data en-\nsures that effects such as high snow levels and solar ioni-\nsation do not figure in the absorption output. Although the\nQDC can be computed to an accuracy of greater than 0.1 dB,\ncaution must be used when applying it to periods of solar ra-\ndio emission that can affect the position of the curve and so\na cautious system error of \u00b10.2 dB is often considered.\n2.3 Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites\n(GOES)\nNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion) operates the Geosynchronous Operational Environmen-\ntal Satellites (GOES), each of which carries a package of\ninstruments designed to monitor space weather variations.\nThree principle measurements are made by the Space Envi-\nronment Monitor (SEM) system: X-rays, energetic particles\nand magnetic fields. The observations presented in this pa-\nper are from the EP8 instrument on board the GOES-8 satel-\nlite, launched in 1995. This was the successor to the EPS\n(Energetic Particle Sensor) that flew on each of the previ-\nous GOES spacecraft. EP8 uses a series of solid-state de-\ntectors with pulse-height discrimination to measure proton,\nTable 1.

Proton data provided by\nNOAA are in two forms: integral and differential fluxes in\nseven energy channels (described in Table 1), all at 5-min res-\nolution. In the differential channels the lowest energy thresh-\nold (P1) primarily responds to trapped outer-zone particles\n(energy >1 MeV); the P2 channel occasionally responds to\ntrapped particles during magnetically disturbed periods. The\nhigher channels respond only to the presence of solar pro-\ntons. Throughout this paper, J (>X) will be used to describe\nan integral flux of protons with a threshold energy, X, given\nin MeV.\nFigure 1 displays the footprint of GOES-8, located in\nNorthern Canada at 356.9\u25e6 longitude AACGM (Altitude\nAdjusted Corrected Geomagnetic Coordinates - Baker and\nWing, 1989) and on an L-shell of 6.85 Earth radii (RE). Also\nshown is the field of view of the IRIS wide beam antenna at\n104.3\u25e6 and on an L-shell of 6.06RE . Thus, IRIS and GOES-\n8 are separated by 107.4\u25e6 of longitude and 0.79RE in L-\nshells (\u223c1.5\u25e6 geomagnetic latitude). It is assumed that the\nincident solar protons bombard the atmosphere in a uniform\nmanner such that the large separation between the two instru-\nments is not important. This approach has been implemented\npreviously when using the GOES satellites to provide mea-\nsurement of the incident proton flux at the top of the iono-\nsphere (e.g. Hall et al., 1992; Hargreaves et al, 1993; Harg-\nreaves et al., 1987, and Collis and Rietveld, 1990). Similarly,\nIRIS is sufficiently poleward of the quiet time absolute cutoff\nboundary such that all but the least energetic (<1 MeV) pro-\ntons will precipitate within the field of view (inferred from\nLeske et al., 2001).\n3 Observations\n3.1 Event identification\nPolar Cap Absorption events are inherently linked to the flux\nof energetic solar protons incident on the ionosphere. The\nSpace Environment Center (SEC) maintains a list of all so-\nlar proton events that have occurred since April 1976; the\nidentification criterion is based upon a minimum integral flux\nof protons at geostationary orbit (i.e. the GOES spacecraft).\nThus, a solar proton event is defined to occur only when the\n1136 A.

In\nthis study the data have been restricted to events that occurred\nbetween 1995 and 2001 inclusive, which cover the first seven\nyears of IRIS operations. This leads to 51 separate events of\nvarying duration, comprising over 90 days of solar proton\nobservations. Table 2 lists the start and end times of the so-\nlar proton events together with their maximum p.f.u. as far\nas the authors are aware this is the largest database of events\nthat has been used in a study of this kind.\nIn the next section two of the listed events are briefly pre-\nsented. These have been selected because they demonstrate\nthe general characteristics of PCA and SPE whilst showing\nhow both geomagnetic and solar activity can influence the\nobserved structure.\n3.2 PCA\/SPE examples\nThe top panel of Fig. 2 displays the solar proton flux in three\nintegral channels (>10, >30 and >100 MeV as described in\nthe legend) from the SPE that began on 20 April 1998 (event\n4 from Table 2). The middle panel displays the cosmic noise\nabsorption (CNA) observed by IRIS at this time; the onset\nwas at \u223c14:00 UT following a small negative deflection in\nthe absorption that corresponded with a type II radio sweep,\nemitted at the same time as the X-ray flare and solar pro-\ntons. Nighttime values are reduced due to the attachment of\nelectrons to neutral species that occurs in the lower D-region\nduring periods of darkness (Reid, 1974; Rietveld and Col-\nlis, 1993). The absorption varied slowly for the first two full\nPCA days, tracking the structure in the GOES proton data\nduring daylight hours; this corresponded with quiet to un-\nsettled geomagnetic activity (Kp<3), as demonstrated in the\nbottom panel. For the majority of the fourth day (23 April)\nCNA was slowly varying except for a sharp negative spike\nfrom a type IV radio sweep that began at 05:38 UT and lasted\nuntil 06:20 UT. Towards the end of 23 April an interplane-\ntary shock struck the magnetosphere leading to enhanced ge-\nomagnetic activity; Kp jumped from 1- to 5 as the absorption\nbecame much more variable. Figure 3 shows event 42 from\nTable 2 in the same format as Fig. 2. This event began late on\n24 September 2001 and lasted for 6 days. In contrast to the\nApril 1998 event this PCA demonstrates more variability in\nthe absorption signature. A number of negative spikes occur\nclose to local noon on each of the days, suggesting enhanced\nsolar radio emission. The absorption signature is more vari-\nable after 20:25 UT on 25 September, when a coronal mass\nejection buffeted the magnetosphere, driving the KP index\nup to 7+. Two more CME impacted the magnetosphere in\nthis period (29 and 30 September).\nThese two isolated events demonstrate how variable the\nPCA signature can be between cases from a riometer located\nin the auroral zone. Electron precipitation following injec-\ntion during substorms can lead to increased structure in the\nabsorption, and solar radio emission can also lead to devi-\nations from the signal due to the proton precipitation. The\nApril 1998 PCA was generally free from magnetospheric\ncontributions (at least from the 20\u201323 April), whereas the\nSeptember 2001 event, which occurred closer to solar maxi-\nmum, exhibited much greater contamination from both mag-\nnetospheric electrons and solar radio emission. Thus, it is ap-\nparent that when attempting to derive an empirical relation-\nship between the proton flux and the cosmic noise absorption\nthere are some constraints that must be considered. The most\nbasic limit is the effect of solar illumination; for this study we\nare only interested in examining the daylight absorption and\nso all values that correspond to a dark ionosphere must be\ndiscarded.\n3.3 Solar zenith angle\nThe solar illumination of the ionosphere plays an impor-\ntant role in the chemistry through both photodetachment of\nelectrons and photodissociation of ions (e.g. del Pozo et\nal., 1999). This effect is most prominent at twilight as the\nEarth\u2019s shadow height increases\/decreases, leading to a re-\nduction\/enhancement in the electron concentration (Collis\nand Rietveld, 1990). Thus, the solar zenith angle can be used\nA. J.

This is presented as a function\nof a limiting solar zenith angle, \u03c7L, i.e. for each value of \u03c7L\nthe correlation coefficient is calculated using data for all so-\nlar zenith angles below the limit; thus, the number of data\npoints that contribute to this varies from 1787(\u03c7L=60\u25e6) to\n20281(\u03c7L=135\u25e6). At the lowest angle displayed it is clear\nthat the absorption and the square root of the flux are well\ncorrelated for several channels; J (>1) to J (>50) all have\nr>0.9, whereas the two higher energy threshold channels\nhave r<0.9(\u223c0.7 for J (>100)). During SPE J (>10) can\ncontain very energetic particles and so the slowly varying\nstructure is reflected in the higher energy channels (e.g. the\ntop panels of Figs. 2 and 3), though the signature may be dif-\nferent in the higher energy channels following acceleration\n1138 A.

In the same format as Fig. 4,\nhowever, now the differential flux chan-\nnels from GOES-8 are used instead of\nthe integral channels.\nby a solar wind shock, as has occurred before midnight on\n25 September 2001. J (>100) has a lower correlation, since\nthese particles are less likely to be responsible for the ionisa-\ntion that leads to the absorption; this is demonstrated by those\nperiods when J (>100) is in the noise level, e.g. 23\u201324 April\n1998 (Fig. 2). The lower correlation of the J (>1) channel\nwith the CNA may be attributed to too much variation; as\nstated in Sect. 2, this channel (I1 in Table 1) also contains\ngeomagnetically trapped radiation which will display extra\nstructure over the riometer observations, even though it will\nencompass the flux of solar protons.\nJ (> 10) has the best correlation with J (>30) and J (>5)\nclose behind. The >10 MeV protons do not decrease in cor-\nrelation by as much as the other energy channels (except\nJ (>100)), until \u03c7L=84\u25e6 at which time the rate of decor-\nrelation increases; throughout, those protons with energies\nin excess of 10 MeV correlate best with the absorption and\nwe can infer that the range of proton energies that contribute\nmost effectively to the observed absorption is within 10 and\n50 MeV. A better estimate of the energy of the protons most\nresponsible for the PCA can be obtained by considering the\ndifferential proton fluxes and how well they correlate with\nthe CNA.\nFigure 5 presents correlation curves for the differential\nflux of protons against the solar zenith angle limit; the en-\nergy range for each channel is included in the legend and\nlisted in Table 1. Two of the GOES channels, covering an\nenergy range of 15\u201382 MeV, exhibit r>0.95 at a zenith angle\nof 60\u25e6. Protons with energy in the range of 15\u201344 MeV retain\na higher correlation as the solar zenith angle limit increases,\nwhereas the 39\u201382 MeV channel decorrelates at a higher rate,\nespecially after \u03c7L=84\u25e6. Modelling the spectrum of precipi-\ntation (possibly using a power law to link the channels) may\nmake it possible to narrow the energy range, though results\nwould depend heavily on the assumptions made in generat-\ning the spectrum.\nIt appears that data from below \u223c84\u25e6 solar zenith angle\ncan be used in the formation of an empirical relationship be-\ntween the CNA at 38.2 MHz and the integral proton flux. The\nbest threshold energy for the protons is 10 MeV, which is in\nbroad agreement with the results of Juday and Adams (1969)\n(11 MeV) and Potemra (1972) (7 MeV). Similarly, the best\ncorrelation with the differential fluxes of protons is for the\nenergy range of 15\u201344 MeV and Potemra (1972) speculated\nthat 15 MeV protons were most responsible for the absorp-\ntion. The current findings would seem to support this. Hav-\ning established some of the limits on the proton contribution\n1140 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption\nto polar cap absorption it is possible to attempt to fit a func-\ntion to the riometer and particle sensor data. Since those\ntimes when photo detachment affects the absorption can now\nbe removed the resulting relationship can be used to probe\nthe effects of both the geomagnetic and solar activity on the\nlower ionosphere during solar proton events.\n4 Flux \u2013 Absorption Relationship\nIn the following derivation of an empirical relationship be-\ntween the proton flux and CNA, we concentrate on the\nintegral flux of protons above 10 MeV, which precipitate\nthroughout the altitude range of the absorbing region.\nThe long duration observations of both IRIS and GOES\nprovide a large database for determining the absorption-flux\nrelationship. By using a geosynchronous satellite, continu-\nous observations of proton fluxes are possible during the en-\ntire duration of a Solar Proton Event, rather than being lim-\nited to the polar passes of an orbiting spacecraft (usually in\n90 minute orbits). It is assumed that the separation of the\ninstruments (\u223c8 h of MLT) should not adversely affect the\nresults, as explained in Sect 2.3.\nSection 2.1 described how the CNA should vary with the\nsquare root of the integral flux (e.g. Van Allen et al., 1964;\nReid, 1970; Potemra, 1972). In this case a relationship of the\nform:\nA = m\u221aJ (> 10)+ c (1)\nis fitted to our results, where A is the absorption in decibels,\nJ (>10) is the integral flux of protons with energy greater\nthan 10 MeV (cm\u22122s\u22121sr\u22121), and m and c represent gradient\nand intercept, respectively.\nFigure 6 displays the scatter of absorption with the square\nroot of the >10 MeV integral flux (top panel). The line of\nbest fit is also displayed, and the values for m and c are 0.074\nand 0.067, respectively. All levels of Kp have been included\nin the fit, but only absorption values from periods with a so-\nlar zenith angle of less than 80\u25e6 have been included. This\nsafely removes the sudden change in correlation observed in\nFig. 4 and results in a correlation coefficient of 0.975. An\nintercept of zero (c=0) would represent the ideal case, in\nwhich the GOES sensors measured no proton flux and the\nriometer recorded no absorption. The method of determin-\ning the absorption for IRIS through quiet-day curve gener-\nation leads to a negligible contribution from solar illumina-\ntion. Error margins have been calculated for the fit to the data\nthrough a least-squares method and yield a median correction\nof \u00b10.376 dB (the maximum was \u00b10.377 dB); this overlaps\nthe ideal value of 0 dB for\n\u221a\nJ (>10)=0.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 6 plots the residuals (observed\nminus calculated absorption) and for a good fit to the data\nthese should be scattered evenly around zero with no trends.\nThis is reasonably true below\n\u221a\nJ=20, with the bulk of the\nscatter (\u223c90%) within \u00b11 dB. After \u221aJ=60 there is a dis-\ntinct trend from high to low values in the data, with most scat-\nter located between 0 and 3 dB before\n\u221a\nJ=100, and between\n0 and \u22123 dB after that. Thus, even though the correlation is\nhigh, there are still problems with the linear relationship. At\nhigher flux levels the absorption is overestimated by as much\nas 4 dB and likewise the absorption is underestimated at the\nmid flux range. In the next section we discuss possible expla-\nnations for this problem and examine the effect of removing\ndata from geomagnetically active periods.\n5 Discussion\nSo far, it has been demonstrated that for the polar cap absorp-\ntion and solar proton events between 1995 and 2001, there is\nan excellent correlation between the square root of the in-\ntegral flux of >10 MeV protons with the cosmic noise ab-\nsorption observed in the auroral zone. The correlation is best\nwhen data for solar zenith angles greater than \u223c80\u25e6 are ex-\ncluded (Fig. 4). Around 84\u25e6 there is a sudden decrease that is\npossibly related to the effects of the sunrise transition when\nthere is a delay in the build-up of atomic oxygen that Collis\nand Rietveld (1990) linked to the rate of electron detachment\nthrough reactions with both ionic ozone and CO\u22123 . Since\nall twilight values contribute to the correlation calculation r\ndoes not decrease as much as it might for just sunrise. The\nincreasing rate of change in the decorrelation observed after\n90\u25e6 is linked to the movement of the Earth\u2019s shadow height\nupward through the ionosphere as oxygen is rapidly depleted\nand photodetachment of electrons can no longer take place\n(Reid, 1974; Collis and Rietveld, 1990).\nAlthough initially promising with a high correlation\n(r=0.975), the fit of the square root of the flux to the CNA\n(Fig. 6) leads to a wide spread of residuals and distinct trends\nat the higher flux values. One parameter that may upset the\ncomputation is the effective collision frequency, which so far\nhas been assumed to remain relatively constant in time at\nall altitudes. The electron-neutral collision frequency is the\ndominant factor in determining ionospheric absorption. It\ndepends on two factors: the concentration of the various at-\nmospheric constituents and the temperature of the electrons\n(Schunk and Nagy, 1978; 1980). The neutral density and\ncollision frequency increase exponentially with decreasing\naltitude. As a result, electrons become thermalized; at lower\naltitudes the temperature of the electrons is considered equal\nto that of the neutral species but if this is not the case, then\ncollisions will increase, in turn affecting the absorption. Fric-\ntional heating leads to an increase in ion temperature, but the\nion-electron collision frequency has only a small role in the\neffective collision frequency at heights where radio absorp-\ntion is appreciable. The electron temperature increase during\nfrictional heating is significantly lower in the F- and E-layers\n(Schlegel and St.-Maurice, 1981) but does become compara-\nble in the D-layer. Stauning (1984) determined that strong\nelectric fields in the polar cap (invariant latitude=77\u25e6) could\nraise the E-region electron temperature sufficiently to pro-\nduce additional absorption of 0.5 dB on a 30 MHz riometer.\nFor IRIS (operating at 38.2 MHz) this translates to a max-\nimum increase of \u223c0.3 dB which is well within the error\nA.

R provides a simple in-\ndication of the hardness of the spec-\ntrum of precipitation by determining\nhow much of the >10 MeV protons are\nalso >30 MeV. A spread of absorption\nlies below R=0.3; the bulk of the resid-\nuals are between\u00b11 dB (\u224885%). There\nis no readily apparent trend in the resid-\nuals that suggests consistently higher\nerrors at larger values of R.\nestimate. Thus, it is not expected that increased collision fre-\nquency would lead to dramatic changes in the flux-absorption\nrelationship.\nThe collision frequency may still play an important role\ndue to the varying deposition of the solar protons in different\nevents. The following section investigates how CNA result-\ning from a \u201chard\u201d spectrum of precipitation differs from that\ndue to a less energetic shower of protons.\n5.1 Spectral hardness\nFor comparable electron densities the cosmic noise absorp-\ntion is greater at lower altitudes due to the effects of the\nelectron-neutral collision frequency. This may have a sig-\nnificant effect on the derived relationship when the spectrum\nof proton precipitation varies significantly; either during an\nevent or between one event and the next. A \u201chard\u201d spectrum\nof precipitation during SPE results in energy deposition at\nlower altitudes (30\u201350 km). Whilst resulting in lower elec-\ntron concentrations this could still lead to higher integral ab-\nsorption; i.e. although the \u201csofter\u201d protons occur in greater\nfluxes and produce more ionisation, the more energetic pro-\ntons will still provide a considerable contribution to the ab-\nsorption.\nTo test the dependence of CNA on the spectrum of proton\nprecipitation, Fig. 7 plots the residuals of the empirical fit as\na function of the ratio, R, of J (>30) to J (>10); there are\nfew examples of the proton flux being composed of predom-\ninantly >30 MeV particles (\u223c2% with a ratio >0.5). As R\napproaches 1 there is a spread of absorption (\u00b11.3 dB) but\nthere are few data points to draw meaningful conclusions\n(\u223c0.5%). Most of the data lies below R=0.3(\u223c94%) and\nthese points spread between \u00b11 dB with a few extending to\n\u00b13 dB. There is no discernable trend in the data to suggest\nthat the hardness of the spectrum has more than a very minor\nrole in affecting the flux-absorption relationship. There are\n1142 A. J.

Overall, the\ngradient drops between Kp=3 and 9,\nhowever, the gradient rises from Kp=1\nand from Kp=5. The values of the co-\nefficients are displayed in Table 3.\ntwo other possible factors that could cause the observed vari-\nation of the CNA: increased geomagnetic activity and solar\nradio emission. The following sections examine these, and\nexplain how they might cause the measured absorption to be\ndifferent from that caused only by solar protons.\n5.2 Geomagnetic activity\nWe have used the planetary K index as our proxy for geo-\nmagnetic activity. Since only daytime values are included in\nthe flux-absorption relationship, the magnetospheric precip-\nitation that we anticipate is from electrons that have drifted\nfollowing injection during substorms. As such, the precipita-\ntion is likely to be more dependent on the night-side activity\nrather than on the local level. Relationships between absorp-\ntion and Kp have already been determined (e.g. Hargreaves,\n1966; Kavanagh et al; 2003), whereas links between local\ngeomagnetic indicators and absorption are less well defined,\nwith known results being station specific (e.g. Oguti, 1963).\nThe results plotted in both Figs. 4 and 6 contained data\nfrom all levels of geomagnetic activity, as defined by the Kp\nindex. This did not seem to effect the correlation. During\nthe most active periods, however, there is a general tendency\nfor absorption to increase due to elevated precipitation of en-\nergetic electrons (e.g. energy >10 keV). The nature of CNA\nas measured through the riometry technique is such that the\ncontributions of high-energy protons and electrons are cumu-\nlative. In general, the electron contribution is likely to be a\nsmall percentage of the total absorption from the solar pro-\nton ionisation, but at times it could contribute as much as\n6 dB (e.g. Nielsen and Honary, 2000), though cases of such\nhigh absorption are rare. Electron induced absorption has\na broad peak on the dayside of the ionosphere (Kavanagh\net al., 2003 and references therein) in the post dawn sector\n(06:00\u201312:00 MLT); thus, electron precipitation would lead\nto contamination of the flux-absorption relationship by cre-\nating higher levels of absorption than the proton flux alone\nwould warrant.\nTo investigate the effect of geomagnetic activity on the\nempirical relationship, a number of threshold values of Kp\nwere used to limit the data. Only those data for which Kp\nwas less than the threshold value were then fitted, using a\nlinear relationship with the form of Eq. (1). Table 3 presents\nthe gradient (m) and intercept (c) for 9 values of Kp. Also\nincluded are the corresponding correlation coefficients and\nan associated error level in the absorption, derived from a\nleast-squares fitting technique. The final column provides\nthe number of data points that contributed to the fit. Figure\n8 plots several of these lines (as indicated in the legend) for\nJ (>10) from zero to 2500 cm\u22122s\u22121sr\u22121.\nDifferences in the parameters are small, suggesting that\nKp has no clear systematic effect on the relationship. A sep-\naration in the value of the intercept occurs between Kp=4\nand Kp=5, leading to higher values for the larger Kp in-\ndices. This would be expected if electron precipitation is\ncontributing to the observed absorption that determines the\nrelationship. High Kp during PCA is often indicative of ge-\nomagnetic storm conditions following the impact of a CME\nassociated with the SPE. Often this leads to acceleration of\nthe solar protons resulting in higher fluxes. Thus, one might\nexpect to see a higher gradient for higher Kp, however, this\nis not the case with the gradient diminishing after Kp=4,\nsuggesting that some other factor is involved in reducing the\nobserved absorption. This is possibly solar radio emission\n(SRE), which causes the observed absorption to deviate from\nthe true level by enhancing the radio signal at the riometer\nfrequency. The following section explains the problems of\nsolar radio emission and examines four different PCA events\nin an attempt to determine whether SRE is a likely candidate\nfor affecting the empirical relationship.\n5.3 Solar Radio Emission (SRE)\nThe riometry technique is a relatively simple method of prob-\ning the lower ionosphere and its ability to monitor during\ndaylight hours is an improvement over many current optical\ntechniques; however, there is a severe constraint on the use of\ndaytime CNA observations, particularly close to solar max-\nimum. At this time the Sun is more active in the emission\nof radio waves, as demonstrated in Sect. 3.2, where the PCA\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption 1143\nTable 3.

Figure 3 (bottom panel) showed\nthat on many of the days of the September 2001 event, a neg-\native spike appeared in the riometer data close to local noon.\nAt these times the apparent position of the Sun in the sky is\nwithin the receiving beam of the riometer, and the wide aper-\nture (\u223c94\u25e6 to the half power point) ensures that solar radio\nemission is recorded, resulting in unrealistic negative absorp-\ntion and sometimes leading to saturation of the receiver. A\nfurther complication arises when the CNA is high (as is often\nthe case during polar cap absorption); when solar emission\noccurs the observed absorption may not drop below zero,\nmaking it difficult to estimate when the observations deviate\nfrom the true ionospheric cosmic noise absorption. It might\nbe argued that through the use of a narrow beam riometer\nthis effect can be reduced (if not removed altogether), unfor-\ntunately the radio emission is often so strong that the side\nlobes of the riometer beam (although less sensitive than the\nmain beam) will be contaminated by the SRE and, therefore,\naffect the overall riometer signal (Kavanagh, 2002). A sim-\nilar problem occurs using riometers deeper in the polar cap,\neven when the main beam is not pointing towards the Sun\nalthough the effect would probably be reduced.\nFigure 9 presents the results of determining a flux-\nabsorption relationship for four separate events, in each case\nwith a zenith angle limit of 80\u25e6 but with no restriction on the\nlevel of geomagnetic activity. Two of the lines are from the\nPCA\/SPE described in Sect. 3; the solid line is for the April\n1998 PCA and the dashed line is for the event in September\n2001. The remaining events are from 2\u20136 April 2001 (dash-\ndot) and 14\u201319 July 2000 (dotted) - the so-called Bastille\nDay event. Table 4 lists the parameters of the fit and also\nlists the median Kp for the events, as well as two indicators\nof the level of solar activity: the median sunspot number and\nthe f 10.7 index for each event. The minimum number of\ndata points used to generate the fits was 439 for April 2001,\nwhereas the maximum number was for the Bastille Day event\n(965).\nThe intercepts closest to zero occur for the PCA events\nof April 1998 and July 2000 but the errors associated with\nthe fitted relationships for these two days are distinctly dif-\nferent. In April 1998 the median error was over three times\nsmaller than for July 2000. The two 2001 events also have\nsimilar intercepts but their associated errors are separated by\n\u223c0.1 dB. These two events had a similar level of geomag-\nnetic activity throughout but the September event demon-\nstrates a much shallower gradient, very similar to the Bastille\nDay. Thus, the events with higher geomagnetic activity lead\nto lower absorption for higher fluxes than when activity is\nquiet to moderate. Interestingly, two events of similar ac-\ntivity display very different gradients (over 1 dB difference\nfor J (>10)=3600 p.f.u), and two events with quite different\nlevels of geomagnetic activity have very similar gradients.\nThe Bastille Day event peaked at Kp=9 for daytime activity\ncompared with Kp=5 for the September 2001 event.\nIn summary, there appears to be no clear relationship be-\ntween the level of geomagnetic activity and the gradient of\nthe fitted curve. To some extent, it is obvious that one should\nnot expect a direct relationship between a rapidly varying\nquantity such as absorption and a discrete activity index such\nas Kp. Kavanagh et al. (2003) demonstrated that, although a\nstatistical relationship could be applied over long time scales,\nvery significant variations in local absorption levels could oc-\ncur while the global KP index remained constant.\nThese differences in behaviour between apparently similar\ndays can perhaps be better understood when the level of solar\nradio emission (SRE) is taken into account. During the April\n1998 event (shown in Fig. 2), there was little contamination\nof the riometer measurements by SRE. The riometer mea-\nsurements made during the PCA event of September 2001,\nhowever, exhibited a number of spikes and bays around lo-\ncal noon (Fig. 3), and it is therefore inferred that the level of\nSRE was high. The possibility therefore exists that the actual\n1144 A. J.

Both April 2001 and Septem-\nber 2001 had similar geomagnetic ac-\ntivity levels, however, the Sun was more\nactive during September 2001; thus,\nthe gradient is shallower due to more\ncontamination from solar radio emis-\nsion.

Three lines are displayed de-\npicting the relationship between the in-\ntegral proton flux and the cosmic noise\nabsorption calculated for three ranges\nof solar activity defined by the f 10.7\nindex. Note that with higher activity the\nabsorption reduces (for\u221aJ>10) due to\na combination of reduced gradient and\nintercept (for the two higher ranges).\nabsorption levels in the September 2001 event were signif-\nicantly higher than those measured by the riometer, as the\npresence of SRE would increase the received signal level,\nthereby decreasing the calculated absorption. For the PCA\nevents of July 2000 and April 2001 geomagnetic activity was\nalso significant, and the actual levels of absorption may thus\nhave been higher than that measured by the riometer, due to\nSRE contamination.\nThe dramatic extent to which SRE can affect absorption\nmeasurements can be seen in Fig. 3. On 25 September 2001,\na large spike-like event occurred, which reduced the absorp-\ntion level almost instantaneously from some 3 dB to near\nzero. This variation was almost certainly due to a burst of\nSRE. It is instructive to compare this event to the sharp in-\ncrease in absorption (\u223c1.3 dB), which occurred on the fol-\nlowing day in response to a sudden storm commencement.\nThus, it seems that the effect of SRE on absorption can eas-\nily be double that caused by geomagnetic activity, and has\nthe opposite sense.\nIt is important to note that even though we use the f 10.7\nand sunspot numbers as indicators of the level of solar ac-\ntivity, the authors are unaware of any published study link-\ning these parameters directly to the solar radio emission at\n38.2 MHz. Some evidence does exist linking the duration of\nSRE (as a percentage of the day) as observed by a riometer,\nwith the f 10.7 flux and with the duration of X-ray emission\nabove a threshold, and this will be the subject of a future\ninvestigation using IRIS observations during periods of low\nprecipitation. Figure 10 displays the flux-absorption relation-\nship derived under three different levels of solar activity, as\nderived from the f 10.7 index. Higher solar activity leads to\na drop in the calculated absorption from the same integral\nflux except at relatively low PFU. This reduction is achieved\nthrough decreases in the derived gradient, as well as, in the\nintercept values for the two higher activity bins. The asso-\nciated error of the relationship from highest solar activity\n(\u00b10.54 dB) is more than double those of the first two bins\n(\u00b10.27 dB). Thus, on a qualitative level the increased solar\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption 1145\nTable 4.

This phenomenon was first described and defined by\nLeinbach (1961, 1967) and consists of a decrease in CNA\nobserved near the edge of the cut-off boundary around noon.\nSatellite measurements of the precipitation of energetic par-\nticles have confirmed the existence of this effect as a combi-\nnation of a local reduction in cut-off latitude (e.g. Reid and\nSauer, 1967) and the development of an anisotropy in the\npitch angle distribution (e.g. Paulikas et al., 1968). How-\never, equatorward riometers are likely to be more susceptible\nto SRE due to the relative position of the Sun in the sky,\nmaximising around local noon, thereby either enhancing the\neffect or indeed producing a false observation of a midday re-\ncovery. Although this is speculation, the effect of solar radio\nemission on cosmic noise absorption measurements is such\nthat it seems likely that some observations of midday recov-\neries are in fact an effect of increased solar radio signal at\nthe riometer operating frequency. Comparisons of riometers\nclose to the absorption cut-off boundary and deeper in the po-\nlar cap may determine whether this could be an effect of SRE\nsince one would expect the solar emission to still affect the\npoleward riometer measurement (to a lesser degree) whereas\na true recovery should be confined to the equatorward obser-\nvations.\n6 Summary and Conclusions\nThe relationship between cosmic noise absorption and solar\nproton bombardment has been investigated using 51 separate\nsolar proton events of varying duration and intensity. As far\nas the authors are aware, this is the largest database used in a\nstudy of this nature. This paper highlights the excellent cor-\nrelation that exists between high-energy protons (>10 MeV)\nand cosmic radio noise absorption in the auroral zone during\nsolar proton events. The correlation is heavily dependent on\nthe solar zenith angle due to chemical changes in the lower,\nunilluminated D-region, and data corresponding to zenith an-\ngles smaller than \u223c80\u25e6 show only small changes in corre-\nlation coefficient. Our results indicate that the integral flux\nmost responsible for PCA has an energy threshold of 10 MeV\nand furthermore, we identify the most responsible protons\nas having energy in the range of 15 to 44 MeV. These find-\nings confirm the results of previous authors. Although there\nis an excellent correlation between the flux and absorption\n(r=0.975) some serious underlying problems with the lin-\near fit to the data have been discovered. The calculated and\nmeasured absorption levels can differ by as much as 3 dB, al-\nthough it must be remembered that in some cases short-term\nadditional electron precipitation may result in higher than ex-\npected absorption. It appears that increased geomagnetic ac-\ntivity (as indicated by the Kp index) does not seem to af-\nfect the overall correlation. We have demonstrated that SRE\nplays a large role in contaminating the measured absorption\nand reducing it from the true value. In turn, this effects the\nderivation of a flux-absorption relationship, leading to an un-\nderestimation of absorption. This is shown to dominate over\nthe geomagnetic effects by comparing four different PCA\nwith different magnetospheric conditions (as described by\nthe median Kp) and solar activity (defined by the average\nf 10.7 cm index and sunspot number for the event). The\nevent with least geomagnetic and solar activity resulted in\nthe smallest associated error (\u00b10.211 dB), whereas the event\nwith highest sunspot number and Kp recorded the highest\nerror (\u00b10.673 dB).\nComparing relationships derived using data corresponding\nto different levels of solar activity demonstrates a trend of\nlower absorption levels occurring for similar integral proton\nflux at higher f 10.7 values. This reinforces that SRE has a\ndistinct effect on the CNA during solar active conditions, al-\nthough it is difficult to quantify this effect with the current\ndata set. Since many SPE occur during the active phase of\nthe solar cycle, any attempt to derive or utilize an empirical\nrelationship must be treated with utmost care due to the ef-\nfects of SRE. More thorough methods, in which the observed\nspectrum of precipitation is used to model the absorption,\nare also limited by uncertainties in D-region recombination\nrates, although steps toward resolving these problems have\nbeen undertaken by Hargreaves et al. (1987, 1993).\n1146 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: On solar protons and polar cap absorption\nThe current study highlights an even more significant\nproblem, namely the difficulty in measuring the true iono-\nspheric absorption level when riometer data are affected by\nSRE. Under these conditions comparisons between modelled\nresults and observations might suggest that the modelling is\nflawed, when in fact it is the riometer data that is misrepre-\nsenting the ionospheric conditions. Further work on under-\nstanding the extent and magnitude of solar radio emission\nin riometer measurements is much needed and an ability to\ndetermine and remove the effects would improve the data\ntremendously. This is the subject of an ongoing study us-\ning periods of low absorption from IRIS in comparison with\nsolar indices.\nAcknowledgements.
