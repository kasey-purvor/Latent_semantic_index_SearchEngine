A Canadian survey revealed that adults spend an average of 15 hours\n*Corresponding author. Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, Milton\nKeynes MK7 6AA, UK.

There is much discussion\nin the literature about the definition of informal learning and different typologies of\ndifferent kinds of learning. Livingstone describes informal learning as \u2018\u2026 self-directed\ninformal learning per se is most simply understood as learning that is taken on the\nlearner\u2019s or learners\u2019 own terms without either prescribed curricular requirements or\na designated instructor\u2019 (Livingstone, 2006, p. 205). Looking at informal mobile\nlearning, Clough et al. (in press) survey personal digital assistant (PDA) and Smart-\nphone enthusiasts from web fora and found that 100 of her 200 respondents\ndescribed informal learning with mobile devices. These experienced mobile device\nusers found inventive and ingenious ways of using their devices to support their infor-\nmal learning. In another study by Pettit and Kukulska-Hulme (2007), alumni of a\nMasters Programme in Online and Distance Education were surveyed about their\nexperience of using mobile devices. These participants were also creative in the way\nthey combined their devices to support their learning\u2014although here it was often in\na formal context.\nThe use of mobile devices has now become commonplace around the world, with\nnon-western countries showing the highest rates of current growth. This is in spite of\nknown usability issues in using portable devices (for an overview, see Kukulska-\nHulme, 2007). Usability problems are linked to small screen size (Waycott, 2004;\nCorlett et al., 2006) as well as problems with entering data into the device (Sm\u00f8rdal\n& Gregory, 2003). The extensive use of mobiles suggests that there are strong\nincentives for people to persist in using their mobile devices even where usability\nproblems are experienced. This led us to consider what aspects of using mobile\ndevices might be so motivating for informal learners.\nDrawing from the literature on both mobile learning and informal learning, Jones\net al. (2006) proposed six reasons why mobile informal learning might be motivating:\ncontrol (over learners\u2019 goals), ownership, learning-in-context, continuity between\ncontexts, fun and communication\u2014the first four of these motivational factors were\ndiscussed in more detail in Issroff et al. (2007). These features are not viewed as a\ndefinitive list or set, but as a starting point for exploring the motivational pull of using\nmobile devices\u2014an area that, like affective issues in learning more generally, has been\nrather neglected in learning research until relatively recently. In this paper we explore\nhow these features relate to two lines of relevant theoretical work\u2014that of appropria-\ntion, which focuses on the adoption and use of devices, and that of coping strategies in\nlearning with technologies. Before discussing technology appropriation and coping\nstrategies, the proposed motivational factors are outlined in a little more detail.\nThe first motivational factor is that in the context of informal learning, learners\nhave control over their own goals and the freedom to define the tasks and activities they\nwish to engage in. The very nature of informal learning means that there is a strong\nrelationship to learners\u2019 goals and interests, and so intrinsic motivation is likely to be\nhigh.\nSecond, mobile devices seem to give their users a strong sense of ownership. In the\nmotivational literature, ownership is often highlighted as a key motivational factor but\ncan refer to ownership of the learning or of learning products. In the context of mobile\nMotivation and mobile devices 249\ndevices it also refers to physical ownership of the devices and their personal nature.\nMobile devices are much more likely to be viewed as individual personal property\nthan other kinds of digital tools and resources (Waycott, 2004). A study on the use of\ntablet PCs in schools (Twining & Evans, 2005) suggested that ownership was also\nimportant in this more formal context.\nThird, many mobile devices also allow users to communicate, thus enabling and\nsupporting collaborative learning. Crook (2000) has suggested that working with\nother people, given the right conditions, is in itself motivating.\nFourth, mobile devices are widely used for entertainment, especially by young\npeople, so it is possible that the emotion and the excitement generated by this use may\nbe associated with the device\u2014mobiles become identified as \u2018fun\u2019 devices.\nFifth, mobile devices enable learners to access resources and information in the\ncontext where they are needed and used, including \u2018in the field\u2019 and to share this infor-\nmation with others. For example, the amateur naturalist can access web sites from\ntheir mobile device, which provide identification guides (including audio and video)\nto support them in identifying what they see at the point they need this information.\nFinally, the portability of mobile devices can provide continuity between different\nsettings so that information or resources that have been captured in one context can\nbe transported to another. Learners can therefore use these devices to support their\ninformal learning projects over time and in different locations\u2014suiting the episodic\nnature of much informal learning, which is carried out in small, distributed chunks\n(Vavoula & Sharples, 2002).\nThese features therefore suggest that using mobiles in informal settings is likely to\nbe highly motivating, but a list of features alone is not sufficient to account for the\nmotivational process. Mobile learning, as a new area, is generally under-theorised.\nSharples et al. (2007) have recently proposed a theory of learning for the mobile age,\nbut while this does emphasise learning as a personally managed lifelong activity there\nis little focus on affective issues such as motivation.\nTheoretical approaches: technology appropriation and coping strategies\nIn this section two theoretical approaches are considered as candidates to help us\nunderstand the motivational power of mobile learning: technological appropriation,\nand J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al.\u2019s (2000) model of coping strategies. Appropriation has been chosen\nbecause this has previously been used to understand why and how people choose to\nuse mobile technologies in a range of settings, and is therefore very relevant to under-\nstanding what motivates the use of mobile devices. The J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al. model, by\ncontrast, focuses on learning with technologies although these are fixed technologies.\nCan these two approaches help to extend and understand the motivational factors we\nhave identified?\nJ\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al.\u2019s study was reported in 2000, the study by Carroll et al. in 2002 and\nWaycott\u2019s study in 2004. However, although there is a rapid change in terms of\ntechnological development, the different temporal locations of the study (or indeed\nthe different contexts) are not problematic for our discussion about motivation.\n250 A. Jones and K. Issroff\nIndeed, many studies about technology-supported learning have shown that the same\nissues and principles re-occur even though the technology changes\u2014for example, the\nissue about the need to have the use of technology for learning assessed and for this\nassessment to be integrated is one that emerged from studies in the early 1980s and\nis still current today (see, for example, Jones & O\u2019Shea, 1982; Kirkwood & Price,\n2005). Accessibility is also a recurring issue\u2014in the 1970s and 1980s, when there\nwere few personal computers, learners found it hard to get access to computers: now\nthere is almost ubiquitous access, but there is often an expectation that learners can\nbe online frequently, which does not fit with the life and work patterns of many learn-\ners so the issue has not gone away. The intention is not to compare the strengths of\none theory against the other, or to compare the studies with each other, but to\nconsider the benefits of each of them to see how the theoretical concepts from those\nstudies can be applied to our data and how they help us with understanding motiva-\ntion and mobile technologies.\nTechnology appropriation\nCarroll et al. (2002) discuss the role of mobile technologies in the lives of young\npeople and why some technologies are adopted by young people and not others. They\npropose a model of appropriation that they define as \u2018the way in which technology or\ntechnological artefacts are adopted, shaped and then used by young people\u2019 (Carroll\net al., 2002, p. 1777). This model is developed from extensive data collection and\nobservation of young people\u2019s use of mobiles in which they discuss factors that influ-\nence young people\u2019s adoption, use and shaping of mobile technologies. These factors\ncome into play at various stages of the appropriation model\u2014and result in either\nappropriation, non-appropriation or disappropriation. The first stage of appropria-\ntion is where users decide whether or not to explore and try out the technology and\nare influenced in this by constraints and attractors, which include, for example,\nconvenience and fashion. If the technology satisfies these constraints (i.e. the attrac-\ntors are stronger than the constraints), the process of appropriation begins. The next\nstage involves assessing whether and how the technology adds value to the young\npeople\u2019s lifestyles. Carroll et al.\u2019s (2002) data show how in this second stage their\nparticipants view their mobile phones and the activities that they support (e.g. text\nmessaging) as an essential component of their lives. Finally, at the third stage, there\nare higher-order reinforcers (e.g. reinforcement through social use in groups). We\nshould note, however, that although it has three stages, Carroll et al. emphasise that\nit is not a linear model\u2014it is more cyclical and recursive.\nA number of the features that we proposed as motivating, as described earlier, map\nwell onto this model (see Table 1). Carroll\u2019s model includes control as a general\nattractor in stage one of their appropriation model; we discuss it in terms of control in\na learning context\u2014where the learner is motivated because they own the goals of their\nlearning. Four other factors fit well with the next stage of appropriation. Carroll\u2019s\nparticipants emphasised the importance of the personal nature of the device: \u2018it\u2019s\nmore personal because it is you being called not your home\u2019, which maps to our\nMotivation and mobile devices 251\ncategory of ownership. Communication was also particularly important to the social\ngoals of these young people in appropriating the devices: \u2018A mobile phone builds\nfriendships because you can talk to them more\u2019 and another described them as \u2018a pre-\nrequisite for a social life\u2019. As predicted, young people talked about using their mobiles\nfor leisure, which maps to our category of fun. Continuity between contexts maps on to\ninformation management as this allows information such as addresses, where young\npeople are to meet, their contacts, and so on, to be accessed while on the move. So\ndespite the fact that the two models were derived from different contexts (a study of\nyoung people\u2019s use of mobile phones compared with a review of the literature on\nlearning with mobile devices), there is a good mapping between these two lists of the\nattractive features of technologies. The one feature that does not occur in Carroll\net al.\u2019s model is learning in context, which is not surprising since Carroll et al.\u2019s work is\nnot focused on learning as such but on the use of mobile devices more generally.\nThe model of technology appropriation in Carroll et al.\u2019s framework relates to\nparticipants\u2019 everyday use and describes stages in the technology appropriation\nprocess. It does not, however, examine the socio-cultural factors that may affect how\nnew technologies are appropriated by individual users, including the context into\nwhich a new technology is introduced. Waycott\u2019s study of appropriation (Waycott,\n2004, 2005) focused on the use of handheld devices\u2014PDAs\u2014as workplace and\nlearning tools. Her ASTAM framework focuses more specifically on the socio-\ncultural factors that influence appropriation through an activity theory analysis that\nalso considers how new technologies fit with current technical systems. Her work also\nemphasises the two-way process of technology appropriation and technology mediation:\nin addition to appropriation, where the adoption and adaptation of technology is\nshaped by social and technological systems, technology mediation also takes place,\nTable 1.

Jones and K. Issroff\nwhich is the process by which tools and technologies change the activities that they\nsupport.\nLike Carroll et al.\u2019s model, Waycott\u2019s model of how mobile technology is appropri-\nated by learners is concerned with how technology is shaped by users and adapted to\ntheir needs, but as noted above it also emphasises the bi-directional nature of this\nprocess by describing how the technologies or artefacts in turn affect and change the\nusers\u2019 actions and their environment. She focuses on the user\u2019s objectives and their\nuse of technology, in particular handheld technologies, to achieve these objectives.\nWaycott carried out a number of case studies of participants\u2019 use of PDAs. These\nincluded: case study a, 44 learners studying a distance education course (mostly\nnovice PDA users who used a Palm m105 PDA over the final two months of their\ncourse); case study b, 11 participants in an academic workplace setting who took part\nover two years and where three different PDA devices were given to the participants\ndepending on their use and preferences; and case study c, a study of a large interna-\ntional organisation that had introduced PDA\u2019s two years previously but which were\nnot being used very much. In this third case study, 16 participants were interviewed\nand there was also a very small case study of use in museums and art galleries.\nWaycott (2004) reports on all these studies, while Waycott (2005) reports on case\nstudies b and c.\nDrawing on these studies, Waycott analysed how participants differed in their\nexpectation and evaluation of the device and the relationships between the design of\nthe device and the activity it was expected to support. The PDAs gave the distance\nlearners, in case study a, access to some of their course materials to supplement their\nuse of other media, which included static text and the Internet. In one of the\nworkplace settings (case study b), academics and administrators were given PDAs to\nsupport their everyday work activities; while in the study of the large international\norganisation (case study c), workers in the energy industry used mobile devices to\naccess information while they were out of the office.\nWaycott uses an activity system framework to analyse the process of tool appropri-\nation as an activity in her ASTAM framework, and activity theory concepts (Waycott\net al., 2005) in her analysis of the technology integration process, which focuses on\nhow users\u2019 activities are changed and shaped by technology use. Using an activity\ntheory approach is helpful in understanding the social factors in appropriation. For\nexample, in her consideration of the subject in the activity system, Waycott examines\nsome of the past experiences, personal circumstances (time and inclination\u2014or\nmotivation, to use the mobile devices) and personal preferences that had an effect on\nhow participants responded to and appropriated the PDA. Each of these will be\ndiscussed briefly below. Waycott addresses motivation when considering her\nparticipants\u2019 personal circumstances.\nParticipants varied in the time they had available and were prepared to make\navailable to learn how to use the PDA. For some it was not worth the effort: \u2018the\nbenefits didn\u2019t outweigh the costs, either \u2026 of getting to know how it worked in the\nfirst place or the cost of continuing to use it whilst I got the hang of it\u2019 (Waycott,\n2004, p. 161).\nMotivation and mobile devices 253\nDifferences in personal inclination\u2014intrinsic motivation\u2014also had an effect on\nthe effort that participants were prepared to put in and the time to set aside. One\ngroup of participants in the study were distance learning students. When asked\nabout their general attitudes towards new technologies, many of these students\nwere very positive towards technology development but their enthusiasm was\nfocused on technologies that were useful as learning tools. For example, one\nparticipant said \u2018I am sufficiently interested \u2026 in \u2026 voice recognition and other\ntools so I try them out \u2026 I\u2019m intrinsically interested in any piece of technology\nthat allows anybody to communicate. I would even say to the point of obsession\u2019\n(Waycott, 2004, p. 161).\nBy contrast, a participant who had never used the PDA much commented \u2018I don\u2019t\nwant the annoyance of having to re-learn different ways of working \u2026 I\u2019m probably\ntoo lazy to learn a new medium\u2019. He did not have the motivation necessary to learn\nto use the PDA and to adapt his work or study practices in order to successfully incor-\nporate the new tool into these activities.\nParticipants had different working practices, and for some there was a close fit\nbetween their working practice and use of the device. For example, one participant\nhad previously used a diary as a time and information management system, keeping\nprintouts of appointment schedules, agendas and emails in her paper filofax folder.\nThe PDA simplified this system for her\u2014it fitted neatly into her way of doing things\nand provided a clear added advantage. By contrast, another participant (a student)\ncommented that he had little need of access to course materials on the move as he\nworked in a nine-to-five job and cycled to work: he thought that if he used trains he\nmight well have benefited.\nWaycott\u2019s activity system approach has therefore enabled a more detailed focus on\nsocial factors affecting appropriation, and on how the use of the mobile devices\nshaped and changed particular activities as well as how participants adapted the way\nthey used the devices themselves.\nIn both Carroll et al.\u2019s and Waycott\u2019s studies, an outcome of successful adoption is\nincreased dependence on the tool. Both the mobile phones used by the young people\nand the PDAs were viewed as highly personal tools: \u2018it goes in my handbag with all\nthose other crucially important things like my credit card, my reading glasses, my car\nkeys \u2026 Those are what I need to function\u2019 (Waycott, 2004, p. 174). As described\nearlier, one of our motivational features is ownership, and both the Waycott and\nCarroll studies certainly support the idea that these devices were seen as very personal\nresources. In response to a query about borrowing a PDA from another student, one\nof Waycott\u2019s participants replied: \nIt would be akin to lending someone my personal diary. I \u2026 store all birthdays \u2026 appoint-\nments, kids functions \u2026 also personal and household finances \u2026 names and addresses of\neveryone I know \u2026 all my security codes \u2026 Absolutely anything and everything I need to\nknow is in one place. \u2026 I could not conceive of letting anyone else look at it let alone\nborrow it. (Waycott, 2004, p. 193)\nThese two approaches to appropriation have some clear differences as well as\nsome strong similarities. The models are derived from work with different mobile\n254 A. Jones and K. Issroff\ndevices\u2014and this has an impact on appropriation. At the time that Carroll et al.\u2019s\nstudy was conducted, mobile phones were generally not as multifunctional as\nPDAs and were probably not as complex to learn to use. The activities for which\nthe devices were used differed too. The mobiles were mainly used as social,\ncommunicative and organisational devices so their owners did not need to get\ninvolved in activities such as typing-up documents\u2014which for the PDA users had\nan additional overload. Waycott found that the PDA\u2019s conflicted with other tech-\nnologies: participants in one of her workplaces had to decide whether to take their\nlaptops or their PDAs when they travelled: although the PDAs were relatively small\nand light\u2014by the time chargers were also taken, and mobile phones, they were a\nsignificant extra when participants were trying to travel relatively light and so were\noften left behind in favour of the heavier laptop that supported typing and Internet\naccess better. However, for Carroll et al.\u2019s young participants, mobiles would not\nusually have been competing with other devices or technologies. Another signifi-\ncant difference is that the PDA was not a stand-alone technology. Participants used\nit as an adjunct to their main computers. It allowed them access to digital informa-\ntion and so on while on the move\u2014but needed to be synchronised with the PC for\nfull benefit.\nIn both models of appropriation, being part of a community, and in particular the\nsupport of other users, is particularly important. Participants made use of knowledge\nelicited from the communities they were part of and were influenced by practice in\nthese communities. In Waycott\u2019s study, community knowledge also played a part in\nparticipants\u2019 decisions not to persevere with using the PDA.\nCoping strategies\nAnother lens that we can use to understand the relationship between motivation and\nthe use of mobile devices is J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al.\u2019s work on coping strategies. J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al.\n(2000) describe three potential types of coping strategies that students could use\nwhen faced with a technology-based task: task-oriented, ego-defensive and social\ndependence. Using case studies, they show how students\u2019 subjective interpretations\nof the task and its context are important variables that interact with features of the\nsetting and impact on the students\u2019 behaviour.\nThe most productive coping strategy for learning is task-oriented coping. This is\ncharacterised by an intrinsically motivated tendency to approach, explore and master\nthe challenging aspects of the environment. So the learners\u2019 initial (cognitive)\nappraisal of task cues and instructions suggests to him or her that the task is doable\u2014\nand there is a moderate expectation of success. This coping strategy is characterised\nby the learner expressing curiosity, interest and enthusiasm\u2014and these in turn\npromote task-approaching behaviours. Motivational tendencies such as sense of\ncontrol and mastery motivation interact with cognitive processes to promote task-\ncoping strategies such as exploring and planning\u2014and the cycle is reinforcing. In less\nproductive strategies, such as ego-defensive strategies, the learner\u2019s expectation of\nsuccess is low and they may believe the task is too difficult.\nMotivation and mobile devices 255\nApplication of the two approaches: the BirdWatch study\nSo how does this work in practice? Next we describe how we applied these two\napproaches to one of our small case studies. Two recent studies by Clough and\ncolleagues have investigated informal learning in the area of natural history. One\nsmall study investigated the use of wireless-enabled tablet PCs for taking part in a UK\nnational survey\u2014BirdWatch. Eight participants used tablet PCs to participate in a\none-hour observation of garden birds and reported back on their experience. In one\nstrand of the study, interviews with participants included a particular focus on\nmotivation (Jones et al., 2006).\nAlthough the overall task of the study was defined as taking part in the BirdWatch\nactivity\u2014which involved recording the number of birds of particular species that they\nsaw within the period of an hour\u2014the tablet PC did support learners in also defining\ntheir own goals. It turned out that this was an important element for one participant\nin particular, for whom things did not go as expected. She planned to do the activity\nwith her family (including six-year-old twins) but was unable to get the wireless\nconnection set up for the tablet PC and thus could not complete the activity in the\nway that she had anticipated. However, rather than abandoning the task she (and the\nfamily) subverted and appropriated it by using the tablet in conjunction with an\nInternet connection on another PC. Furthermore, no birds were observed, and so the\ntask of observing birds was not possible to carry out\u2014again the activity was changed\nand this led to unexpected but interesting outcomes: \nWe finally all got lined up along the window and there were NO birds \u2026 there is a limit to\nhow long they (the 6 year olds) will stare at an empty garden\u2014they were much more\ninterested in the technology because they had been doing a lot of work on it at school. [My\nson] was very excited that he could \u2026 go on Google \u2026 do some of the ICT suite work he\nhad done at school. So the learning activity they were doing actually was spelling\u2014because\nof course you can\u2019t use Google unless you can spell so they would be going how do you\nspell Samuel Pepys\u2014so I am starting out of the window making some notes on my tablet\nsaying how do you think it is spelt?\nTherefore, the fact that the technology supported learners in defining their own\ngoals and ways of accessing further information was crucial here\u2014it allowed them\nto alter the task to something that they still got something out of (i.e. they devel-\noped new goals). The Carroll et al. model does not particularly add to our under-\nstanding of what happened in this case study because it does not focus on particular\nactivities, whereas Waycott\u2019s model of appropriation and assimilation emphasises\nthe bi-directional nature of appropriation and assimilation. The technology appro-\npriation here is seen in the way that the PC is used alongside the tablet PC to\nprovide the Internet access when there is a failure in setting up the wireless. The\nactivity (i.e. the task) is also changed.\nWhat about applying the coping strategies model to BirdWatch? This also adds\nsomething to our understanding of what happens here because, according to J\u00e4rvel\u00e4\net al. (2000), what is important is what the student\u2019s coping efforts are: these are\ninitially influenced by the environment (social interaction, cultural conventions, etc.),\n256 A. Jones and K. Issroff\nand by the socio-emotional, motivational and cognitive interpretations made by the\nlearner; and in turn these are influenced by their emotionally important experiences\nfrom their learning histories\u2014and the quality of learning strategies available for them\nin that particular domain. So, applying this to the BirdWatch case study, and in\nparticular to this family, it can be argued that this participant took a task-oriented\ncoping strategy characterised by \u2018an intrinsically motivated tendency to approach,\nexplore and master the challenging aspects of the environment\u2019. In such an\napproach, the learners\u2019 appraisal of the task and instructions leads her to think that\nthe task is one that she can do and there is a moderate expectation of success. J\u00e4rvel\u00e4\net al.\u2019s examples of task-oriented coping behaviours include exploring and planning.\nIn this case, of course, it turns out that the task as set is not do-able\u2014there are no\nbirds\u2014and neither is she able to get the wireless set-up to work. However, the\napproach taken is very consistent with a model in which emotions such as interest,\ncuriosity and enthusiasm are evident\u2014and in the absence of being able to carry out\nthe original task allow the learner to change the task and goals to those that are\nachievable. It would also suggest that other individuals in the same situation who\nwere less task-oriented and less confident of being successful might easily give up or\ninvoke other less productive coping strategies. For example, ego-defensive coping is\ndominated by self-defence and self-protective motives\u2014the learner does not view\nhimself or herself as an active agent but more passively, so not strongly in control.\nThey become sensitised to task difficulty cues and demand aspects\u2014and initial\nappraisal may lead to interpretations such as \u2018it is too difficult\u2019, and expectations of\nsuccess are low. We can see how in this situation such a strategy would have been\nreinforced by the difficulty of the task.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have discussed two theoretical approaches\u2014appropriation and\ncoping strategies\u2014and considered these in terms of how they relate to what motivates\nlearners to use mobile devices. We then provided an illustration of their application\nby applying them to a case study from our own research on motivation and mobile\ntechnologies. We found that one approach, the coping strategies, enabled us to\nfurther our understanding of the use of mobile technologies, while the other\napproach, appropriation, was also helpful but in a different sense. Appropriation as\ndefined by Carroll et al. was not so helpful in this context, but Waycott\u2019s model was\nhelpful in thinking about the bi-directional relationship between appropriation and\nassimilation, and in particular the way in which the mobile technology was used with\nanother tool\u2014the fixed PC.\nThe two different theoretical approaches work at different levels of granularity\u2014\nthe J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al. theoretical approach is based on relatively small episodes of learning\nand is helpful in the BirdWatch case study. One way of interpreting this example is\nthat it extends J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al.\u2019s model because, as it is informal learning, with a task that\nis not a requirement for a formal course, the task-oriented coping strategy that was\nused is in fact an \u2018other task-oriented strategy\u2019 (i.e. the participants changed the task\nMotivation and mobile devices 257\nto one that was relevant to them and that they were able to do in the given context\nwith the mobile device available to them). This was facilitated by the nature of the\ntool, which is very flexible. In contrast, the appropriation models work at a different\nlevel, over a much longer period of time.\nIt therefore appears that the coping strategy model is useful in terms of explaining\nsmall incidences of learning, while the appropriation model as defined by Waycott is\nmore useful for understanding the larger contextual aspects of the use of mobile\ntechnologies, and their relationship to other technologies in the setting.\nReferences\nCarroll, J., Howard, S., Vetere, F., Peck, J. & Murphy, J.
