Stewart\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Durham,\nScience Labs, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, U.K.\nAbstract\nIn this note, we show, through the use of examples, how generic results for prov-\ning fixed-parameter tractability which apply to restricted classes of structures can\nsometimes be more widely applied.\nKey words: computational complexity, analysis of algorithms, fixed-parameter\ntractability\n1991 MSC: 68Q15\n1 Introduction\nFixed-parameter tractability has emerged in recent years as an alternative to\nthe traditional notion of tractability, namely that of solvability in polynomial-\ntime. It is a more general notion of tractability, in that even someNP-complete\nproblems are fixed-parameter tractable, yet the notion remains a realistic one\nin an empirical sense. A structural parameterized complexity theory now ex-\nists, and there is a considerable ongoing effort to both classify the (param-\neterized) complexity of problems, with much research as to whether specific\nproblems are fixed-parameter tractable or not, and also to develop increas-\ningly better algorithms for specific problems (especially those that are fixed-\nparameter tractable). The reader is referred to [3,5,8] for a thorough overview\nof the current status of parameterized complexity theory and fixed-parameter\nalgorithms.\nEmail address: i.a.stewart@durham.ac.uk (Iain A. Stewart).\nURL: http:\/\/www.durham.ac.uk\/i.a.stewart (Iain A. Stewart).\nIn this note we are concerned with generic techniques for proving problems to\nbe fixed-parameter tractable. We have in mind results such as the following.\nTheorem 1 ([6]) Let C be a polynomial-time decidable class of structures of\neffectively bounded local tree-width. There is a computable function f and an\nalgorithm \u03b1 such that, given A \u2208 C and a first-order sentence \u03d5 \u2208 FO, \u03b1\ndecides whether A |= \u03d5 in time O(||A||) + f(|\u03d5|) \u00b7 |A|2.\n(Here, ||A|| is essentially the length of the encoding of A as a string of symbols\n[5, p. 74].)\nTheorem 2 ([4]) Let C be a non-trivial class of graphs that is minor closed.\nThere is a computable function f , a polynomial p and an algorithm \u03b1 such\nthat, given A \u2208 C and a first-order sentence \u03d5 \u2208 FO, \u03b1 decides whether\nA |= \u03d5 in time f(|\u03d5|) \u00b7 p(|A|).\nTheorem 3 ([1]) Let C be a class of graphs locally excluding a minor. There\nis a computable function f , a polynomial p and an algorithm \u03b1 such that, given\nA \u2208 C and a first-order sentence \u03d5 \u2208 FO, \u03b1 decides whether A |= \u03d5 in time\nf(|\u03d5|) \u00b7 p(|A|).\nSuch results are only applicable to restricted classes of structures yet are still\nvery powerful. For example, the class of structures of degree at most d, for\nsome fixed d, has effectively bounded local tree-width, as does the class of\nplanar graphs (see [5, p. 314]); consequently, any first-order definable param-\neterized problem on these classes of structures is necessarily fixed-parameter\ntractable (when parameterized by the length of the input formula). We have\ntwo remarks. First, there are other generic results, such as Courcelle\u2019s The-\norem [2] which states that there is a computable function f such that given\na structure A and a sentence \u03d5 of monadic second-order logic, we can decide\nwhether A |= \u03d5 in time f(|\u03d5|, tw(A)) \u00b7 |A|+O(||A||), where tw(A) is the tree-\nwidth of A. However, (results similar to) Courcelle\u2019s Theorem are too limiting\n(in comparison to Theorems 1, 2 and 3); for example, there are planar grids\nof arbitrary-size tree-width. Second, there are generic results in traditional\ncomplexity theory that automatically yield tractability bounds on classes of\nproblems, one of which is Seese\u2019s result that any first-order definable problem\non a class of structures of bounded degree is solvable in linear time [9].\nHowever, it turns out that (a theorem derived from the proof of) Theorem 1\ncan sometimes be applied to show that a specific parameterized problem whose\ninputs come from a class of arbitrary structures is fixed-parameter tractable\n(where the applicability of the theorem depends upon the problem in hand).\nThis note simply remarks upon this observation and is intended to act as a\nstimulus to further research into generalizing the application of results such\nas Theorems 1, 2 and 3.\n2\n2 An example\nHenceforth, we use [5] as our standard reference text for (proofs of) existing\nresults of interest to us in this paper. We motivate and explain our ideas\nwith an example. Consider deciding whether the following problem k-Almost\ns-Regular Graph, ARG(s), where s \u2265 0, is fixed-parameter tractable.\nInput: Positive integer k, graph G = (V,E).\nParameter: k.\nQuestion: Does there exist a set S \u2286 V of size at most k such that\nthe subgraph of G induced by the vertices of V \\ S is regular\nof degree s?\nThis problem has recently been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable [7]\nusing combinatorial techniques (the algorithm in [7] runs in time O(n(k +\ns) + ks2(k + s)2(s + 2)k)), but ideally we would like to use results such as\nTheorems 1, 2 and 3.\nNote that the problem ARG(s) can be defined in first-order logic, as the\nfollowing sentence \u03c7sk witnesses:\n\u2203x1\u2203x2 . . .\u2203xk\u2200y(\n\u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\n(xi 6= y)\u21d2\n\u2203z1\u2203z2 . . .\u2203zs(\n\u2227\n1\u2264i<j\u2264s\n(zi 6= zj) \u2227\n\u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\n\u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264s\n(xi 6= zj)\n\u2227\n\u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264s\n(E(y, zj) \u2228 E(zj, y))\n\u2227\u2200w((E(y, w) \u2228E(w, y))\u21d2\n\u2228\n1\u2264j\u2264s\n(w = zj)))).\nGiven any input (G, k) to ARG(s), we can construct the pair (G,\u03c7sk) in\nO(n2 + ks) time, where n is the number of vertices of G (note that |\u03c7sk| =\nO(ks(log(k) + log(s))). However, we cannot apply any of Theorems 1, 2 or 3\nto show that ARG(s) is fixed-parameter tractable as the inputs of ARG(s)\npotentially involve graphs of unbounded local treewidth, come from a class\nthat is not minor-closed or come from a class that does not locally exclude a\nminor.\nThe problem ARG(s) can be reduced (as we explain below) to a similar prob-\nlem ARG\u2032(s) where the degrees of the vertices of any input graph are bounded\nin terms of (a function of) the parameter. The problem ARG\u2032(s) is defined as\nfollows.\nInput: Positive integer k, graph G = (V,E) for which every vertex of V\n3\nhas degree no less than k and no more than k + s.\nParameter: k.\nQuestion: Does there exist a set S \u2286 V of size at most k such that the\nsubgraph of G induced by the vertices of V \\ S is regular of\ndegree s?\nThe following algorithm reduces ARG(s) to ARG\u2032(s).\nwhile k \u2265 0 and there exists a vertex v \u2208 V of degree in G\n> k + s or < k do\nremove v from V ;\nset G to be the subgraph of (the old) G induced by V ;\nk := k \u2212 1;\nod\nif k \u2265 0 then return (G, k)\nelse return (Ks, 1) fi\nClearly, the above algorithm is a parameterized reduction from ARG(s) to\nARG\u2032(s) (running in time O(kn2); note that any vertex of G of degree more\nthan k + s or less than s must necessarily be in the chosen subset S of V ).\nThus, ARG(s) is fixed-parameter tractable if, and only if, ARG\u2032(s) is fixed-\nparameter tractable, and we may as well work with the problem ARG\u2032(s).\nNevertheless, we still cannot apply Theorem 1 as in order to do so, we require\nthat the local tree-width of any input graph is explicitly bounded and this is\nnot the case for the input graphs of ARG\u2032(s). However, a simple observation\nopens up our problem to application. Let FIN be the class of finite structures\nand let FO be first-order logic. Furthermore, let tw(A) be the treewidth of\nany structure and let NAr (a) be the r-neighbourhood of the element a \u2208 |A|\nin the Gaifman graph of A (again, see [5, p. 314]).\nDefinition 4 Let C \u2286 FIN \u00d7 FO. We say that C has effective p-bounded\nlocal tree-width if there is a computable function f : N \u00d7 N \u2192 N such that\nfor every r \u2208 N, ltw(A, r) \u2264 f(r, |\u03d5|), for every (A, \u03d5) \u2208 C, where ltw(A, r) =\nmax{tw(NAr (a) : a \u2208 |A|}.\nThe definition of effective local bounded tree-width in [5] is as in Definition 4\nexcept that the computable function f has domain N and for each r \u2208 N,\nltw(A, r) \u2264 f(r).\nThe proof of the following result is identical to the proof of Theorem 12.22 of\n[5] (and so there is no need to include the proof here).\nTheorem 5 Let C \u2286 FIN \u00d7 FO have effective p-bounded local tree-width.\nConsider the parameterized problem \u2126 defined as follows.\n4\nInput: (A, \u03d5) \u2208 C.\nParameter: |\u03d5|.\nQuestion: Is it the case that A |= \u03d5?\nThere is a computable function f , a polynomial p and an algorithm \u03b1 such that,\ngiven (A, \u03d5) \u2208 C, \u03b1 decides whether A |= \u03d5 in time O(||A||) + f(|\u03d5|) \u00b7 |A|2.\nWe can now apply Theorem 5.\nCorollary 6 For every s \u2265 0, the decision problem ARG(s) is fixed-parameter\ntractable.\nPROOF. As there is a parameterized reduction from ARG(s) to ARG\u2032(s), it\nsuffices to show that ARG\u2032(s) is fixed-parameter tractable. Let (G, k) be an\ninput to ARG\u2032(s); in particular, every vertex of G has degree at most k + s.\nDefine\nC = {(G,\u03c7sk) : (G, k) is an input to ARG\n\u2032(s)}.\nAs remarked earlier, this reduction can be completed in O(n2 + ks) time,\nwhen the graph G has n vertices. For every (G,\u03c7sk) \u2208 C and for every r \u2208 N,\nltw(G, r) \u2264 (k + s)r \u2264 (|\u03c7sk|)\nr, and so C has effectively p-bounded local tree-\nwidth. By Theorem 5, ARG\u2032(s) is fixed-parameter tractable and the result\nfollows. \u0003\nNote that complexity of the resulting algorithm for ARG(s) is O(f(k) \u00b7 n2),\nwhich (as is to be expected) is not as good as the algorithm in [7], in terms of\nneither n nor the function corresponding to k (note that no bound is given for\nthis function in Corollary 6). Nevertheless, if all one is interested in is whether\na problem is fixed-parameter tractable or not then applying our generic tech-\nnique is much easier than the approach employed in [7].\nThe proof in [7] that ARG(s) is fixed-parameter tractable actually also shows\nthat the following problem, k-Almost Regular Graph, ARG, is fixed-parameter\ntractable, though this is not stated explicitly in [7].\nInput: Positive integers k and s, graph G = (V,E).\nParameter: k + s.\nQuestion: Does there exist a set S \u2286 V of size at most k such that\nthe subgraph of G induced by the vertices of V \\ S is regular\nof degree s?\nAn identical argument to that above yields the following result.\nCorollary 7 The decision problem ARG is fixed-parameter tractable.\n5\nWe end with a remark regarding Courcelle\u2019s Theorem, stated earlier. As can\nbe seen from Section 11.6 of [5], there exists a technique called tree-width re-\nduction where, essentially, one reduces an instance to an instance of bounded\ntree-width and then applies Courcelle\u2019s Theorem. This technique has similar-\nities with ours, though our technique is more powerful in that it enables us to\nshow fixed-parameter tractability by reducing to classes of structures which\ndo not have bounded tree-width.\n3 Conclusion\nIn this note we have demonstrated, with a simple example, the wider applica-\nbility of generic results such as Theorems 1, 2 and 3. We hope that this note\nacts as an impetus for further research into the applicability of results such\nas these. For example, it would be interesting to derive properties of defining\nformulae (such as \u03c7ks) which necessarily make a problem amenable to attacks\nsuch as that demonstrated here.\nAcknowledgement.
