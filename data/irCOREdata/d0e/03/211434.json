These complementary approaches have, however, rarely been combined. Important operational and methodological barriers have thwarted any potential cross-fertilization. This paper tries to fill this gap in the literature by combining in one model R&D, spillovers, and innovation systems approaches. A multiple regression analysis is conducted for all regions of the group of 25 European Union countries (EU-25), including measures of R&D investment, proxies for regional innovation systems, and knowledge and socio-economic spillovers.

Introduction \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe. Regional studies, 42 (1). pp. 51-67. ISSN 0034-3404 \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00343400701654186 \n 4 \nThe capacity to innovate and to assimilate innovation have regularly been considered \nas two of the key factors behind the economic dynamism of any territory (Feldman \nand Florida, 1994; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Cantwell and Iammarino, 1998; \nFurman, Porter, and Stern, 2002). Yet, despite this agreement on the essentials, \ndifferent researchers have tried to untangle the link between research, innovation, and \neconomic growth in very different ways. Three different approaches to this \nrelationship predominate. The first is the so-called \u2018linear model\u2019 (Bush, 1945; \nMaclaurin, 1953), whereby basic research leads to applied research and to inventions, \nthat are then transformed into innovations, which, in turn, lead to greater growth. \nEmpirically, this type of analysis focuses fundamentally on the link between R&D \nand patents, in the first instance, followed by that between patents and growth. Such \nanalyses are fundamentally conducted by \u2018mainstream economists\u2019 and, despite \ncriticisms (e.g. Rosenberg, 1994), the approach remains popular with academics and \npolicy makers. A second group can be classified under the denominations of \u2018systems \nof innovation\u2019 (Lundvall, 1992) or \u2018learning region\u2019 (Morgan, 1997) approaches. \nThese approaches, associated with evolutionary economics (Dosi et al, 1988; \nFreeman, 1994), concentrate on the study of territorially-embedded institutional \nnetworks that favour or deter the generation of innovation. The capacity of these \nnetworks to act as catalysts for innovation depends, in turn, on the combination of \nsocial and structural conditions in every territory, the so-called \u2018social filter\u2019 \n(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1999). These approaches tend to be fundamentally qualitative and \nmainly conducted by geographers, evolutionary economists, and a number of \neconomic sociologists. Finally, there is a large group of scholars who has mainly \nconcentrated on the diffusion and assimilation of innovation (Jaffe, 1986; Audretsch \nand Feldman, 1996; Cantwell and Iammarino, 2003; Sonn and Storper, 2005). This \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe. Regional studies, 42 (1). pp. 51-67. ISSN 0034-3404 \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00343400701654186 \n 5 \nknowledge spillovers approach has been generally adopted by economists and \ngeographers, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. \n \nAlthough such a variety of approaches contributes to improve our understanding of \nthe process of innovation and of the linkages between innovation and economic \ndevelopment, there has been little cross-fertilisation between these different, but \nnevertheless complementary strands of literature. Major operational and \nmethodological barriers have hitherto kept any potential interaction to a bare \nminimum. The main reasons for this lack of interaction are related to the different \ndisciplinary backgrounds of the researchers working on innovation, to the different \nmethods used in the various approaches, and to the difficulties in operationalising \nsome of the concepts employed by the diverse scholarly strands. \n \nThis paper represents an attempt to try to bridge this gap in the literature by \ncombining in one model linear, innovation systems, and spillover approaches. The \naim is to show how factors which have been at the centre of these research strands \n(i.e. innovative effort, socio-institutional contextual factors, and localised knowledge \nspillovers) interact and account for a significant part of the growth trends of the \nregions of the enlarged EU after 1995. An additional objective is to shed new light on \nthe role of geographical distance in the process of innovation, by focusing on the \n\u201ccontinuing tension between two opposing forces\u201d (Storper and Venables 2004, \np.367): the increasingly homogeneous availability of standard \u2018codified\u2019 knowledge, \non the one hand, and the spatial boundedness of \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge and contextual \nfactors, on the other. Such tension is an important determinant of the present \neconomic geography of European regions, which is further accentuated by the \nunderlying socio-economic differences.  \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe. Regional studies, 42 (1). pp. 51-67. ISSN 0034-3404 \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00343400701654186 \n 6 \n \nIn order to achieve this aim, we ground our approach on a series of fundamental \ntheoretical mechanisms which make knowledge and its transmission an important \nexplanation for regional diversity in economic growth. First, that, as highlighted by \nthe linear model of innovation, local innovative activities are crucial for the \n\u2018production\u2019 of new knowledge and the economic exploitation of existing knowledge, \ngiven the presence of a minimum threshold of local innovation capabilities (as put \nforward by evolutionary economics and neo-Schumpeterian strands). Such activities \nare not geographically evenly distributed and thus become a localised source of \ncompetitive advantage for some areas rather than others. Second, that information is \nnot automatically equivalent to economically-useful knowledge (Sonn and Storper, \n2005). A successful process of innovation depends on \u201clocalised structural and \ninstitutional factors that shape the innovative capacity of specific geographical \ncontexts\u201d (Iammarino, 2005, p.499), as indicated by the systems of innovation \n(Lundvall, 2001), regional systems of innovation (Cooke et al., 1997), and learning \nregions (Morgan, 2004; Gregersen and Johnson, 1996) approaches. And third, that \ntechnological improvements in \u2018communication infrastructures\u2019 have not affected all \nkinds of information in the same way. While \u2018codified information\u2019 can be \ntransmitted over increasingly large distances, \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge tends to be \ngeographically bound and a key factor behind the concentration of innovation \n(Audretsch and Feldman, 2004; Cantwell and Iammarino, 2003; Sonn and Storper, \n2005; Charlot and Duranton, 2006; Iammarino and McCann, 2006). \n \nThe paper is organised into four further sections. First, we introduce the theoretical \nframework for the analysis. The second section presents the empirical model and \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

In the third section the empirical results are \ndiscussed. The final section concludes with some economic policy implications.  \n \n2. R&D, innovation systems and knowledge spillovers \n \nFrom a pure neoclassical perspective, factors such as the percentage of investment in \nresearch and development (R&D) or where the actual research is conducted matter \nlittle. The traditional neoclassical view of knowledge as a public good (non rivalrous \nand non excludable), available everywhere and to everybody simultaneously implies \nthat innovation flows frictionless from producers to a full set of intended and \nunintended beneficiaries (as \u2018manna from heaven\u2019), contributing to generate a long-\nterm process of convergence across countries and regions (Solow, 1957; Borts and \nStein, 1964). However, this view of innovation as a factor that could be overlooked in \nthe genesis of economic development is now firmly on the retreat. It is not just that \ninnovation is considered as one of the key sources of progress (Fagerberg 1994), but \nalso that technology and innovation have become regarded as essential instruments in \nany development policy (Trajtenberg, 1990). Differences in innovation capacity and \npotential become thus, from an \u2018endogenous growth\u2019 perspective (e.g. Grossman and \nHelpman, 1991), one of the basic explanations for persistent differences in wealth and \neconomic performance. By bringing innovation to the fore, it is often assumed that \ngreater investment in basic R&D will lead to greater applied research and to an \nincrease in the number of inventions, that, when introduced in the production chain, \nbecome growth-enhancing innovations. This linear perception of the innovation \nprocess places localised R&D investment at the heart of technological progress and, \neventually, economic growth. In essence, the implications of this approach are that the \nhigher the investment in R&D, the higher the innovative capacity, and the higher the \neconomic growth. Despite being much derided (e.g. Fagerberg, 1988; Verspagen, \n1991; Rosenberg, 1994; Morgan, 1997), the linear model remains popular with \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe. Regional studies, 42 (1). pp. 51-67. ISSN 0034-3404 \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00343400701654186 \n 8 \nacademics and policy makers because of its simplicity and powerful explanatory \ncapacity: nations and regions that invest more in R&D, generally tend to innovate \nmore, and often grow faster. But by focusing on local R&D, the linear model \ncompletely overlooks key factors about how innovation is actually generated. These \nfactors are related to the context in which innovation takes place and to the potential \nfor territories to assimilate innovation being produced elsewhere. \n \nIt has now become widely accepted that innovation is a territorially-embedded \nprocess and cannot be fully understood independently of the social and institutional \nconditions of every space (Lundvall, 1992; Asheim, 1999). The \u2018territorially-\nembedded\u2019 factors influencing the process of innovation have thus become the main \nfocus for a number of theoretical perspectives: from innovative milieus (Camagni, \n1995) and industrial districts (Becattini, 1987) to learning regions (Morgan, 1997) and \nsystems of innovation (Cooke et al., 1997; Cooke, 1998). These approaches are \ncharacterised by powerful insights that help us improve our understanding of how and \nunder which conditions the process of innovation takes place. Some of the most \nrelevant findings related to these approaches are the relevance of proximity, local \nsynergies, and interaction (Camagni, 1995, p.317) and the importance of \u201cinter-\norganization networks, financial and legal institutions, technical agencies and research \ninfrastructures, education and training systems, governance structures, innovation \npolicies\u201d (Iammarino, 2005, p.499) in shaping innovation. The explanatory capacity \nof such approaches is, however, somewhat constrained by the problems of \noperationalising in a relatively homogenous way across space the territorially-\nembedded networks, social economic structures, and institutions that lie at their heart. \nBy nature, the systemic interactions among (local) actors are intrinsically unique and \nthus hard to measure and compare across different systems.

ISSN 0034-3404 \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00343400701654186 \n 9 \nthis problem is the \u2018evolutionary integrated view of the regional systems of \ninnovation\u2019 (Iammarino, 2005). From the perspective of evolutionary economics, a \nmeso-level analysis can be developed by contrasting the macro-level (national \nsystems) with the micro-level (the level of the individual innovative actors). This \nmeso-level constitutes \u201cthe essential thing that is changing in a process of \nevolutionary economic change\u201d (Dopfer et al., 2004, p.269) and accounts for local \nand regional variety in terms of absorption, diffusion, and generation of new \nknowledge1. The concepts of industrial district, learning region, innovation system, \netc. \u2013 from an evolutionary economics point of view \u2013 can all be referred back to this \n\u2018meso\u2019 perspective. An integrated micro-meso-macro approach to the socio-\ninstitutional determinants of innovative performance is a means for dealing with the \nheterogeneity and path dependency \u2013 in terms of \u201clocal structural regularities from \npast knowledge accumulation and learning\u201d (Iammarino, 2005, p. 503) \u2013 of the \nregional economy which, in its turn, shapes and constrains new growth opportunities. \nThis approach provides a flexible theoretical tool for the identification of a series of \n\u201cexternal conditions in which externalised learning and innovation occur\u201d (Cooke et \nal., 1997, p.485) that can be identified across innovation systems and on which \ninnovation strategies can be based. These factors act as \u201cconditions that render some \ncourses of action easier than others\u201d (Morgan, 2004) or as \u2018social filters\u2019, that is, the \nunique combination \u201cof innovative and conservative (\u2026) elements that favour or \ndeter the development of successful regional innovation systems\u201d (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, \n1999, p. 82) in every space.  \n \nFinally territories rely not only on their internal capacity to produce innovation either \nthrough direct inputs in the research process or through the creation of innovation \nprone systems in the local environment, but also on their capacity to attract and \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

At the micro-level, innovative units (R&D \ndepartments within firms, universities, research centres, etc.), as well as local \ninstitutions and individuals, interact with each other and with their external \nenvironment through the networks described above. Such interactions produce the \ntransmission of knowledge in the form of \u2018knowledge spillovers\u2019 (Jaffe, 1986; Acs, \nAudretsch, and Feldman, 1992) that are reaped by local actors. The origin of \nknowledge spillovers can be local, but they can also be generated outside the borders \nof the locality or region object of the analysis, as \u201cthere is no reason that knowledge \nshould stop spilling over just because of borders, such as a city limit, state line or \nnational boundary\u201d (Audretsch and Feldman, 2004, p.6). As there are internal and \nexternal sources of spillovers, important questions arise. The first relate to the balance \nbetween internally generated innovation and externally transmitted knowledge and the \nextent to which a territory can rely on externally-generated knowledge for innovation. \nThe second group of questions concerns the local and external conditions that \nmaximise the diffusion of knowledge. The final group deals with the capacity of \nknowledge spillovers to travel and the potential for distance decay effects. In order to \naddress these questions we have to resort to the theoretical distinction between \ncodifiable information and tacit knowledge. According to Leamer and Storper (2001, \np. 650) codifiable information \u201cis cheap to transfer because its underlying symbol \nsystems can be widely disseminated through information infrastructure\u201d. Hence \ncodifiable information can be disseminated relatively costlessly over large distances \nand does not suffer from strong distance decay effects. However, all information is \nnot completely codifiable. The presence of some specific features make, in some \ncases, codification impossible or too expensive. \u201cIf the information is not codifiable, \nmerely acquiring the symbol system or having the physical infrastructure is not \nenough for the successful transmission of a message\u201d (Storper and Venables, 2004, p. \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

In the latter case there is thus a need to disseminate tacit knowledge by an \nintrinsically \u2018spatial\u2019 communication technology, among which face-to-face \ninteraction is key. Face-to-face contacts, as discussed in Storper and Venables (2004) \nor in Charlot and Duranton (2006), do not only act as a communication technology \nbut also pursue other functions (such as generating greater trust and incentives in \nrelationship, screening and socialising, rush and motivation) which make \ncommunication not only possible but also more effective, and ultimately ease the \ninnovation process.  \n \nHowever, and in contrast with codifiable information, the process of transmission of \ntacit knowledge is costly and suffers from strong distance decay effects. Face-to-face \ncontacts are maximised within relatively small territories, due to a combination of \nproximity and the presence of common socio-institutional infrastructures and \nnetworks. The potential to reap knowledge spillovers will thus be maximised within \nthe region. Some of this knowledge will nevertheless spill over beyond the borders of \nthe region or locality flowing into neighbouring areas, as a consequence of the \nexistence of different forms of inter-regional contacts. Flows of interregional \nknowledge are thus important as agents of innovation, but their influence is likely to \nwane with distance (Anselin et al., 1997; Adams and Jaffe, 2002; Adams, 2002), as \nthe potential for face-to-face and other forms of interaction decay.  \n \n3. The model: putting the different strands together \nThe three strands of literature presented above rely on three crucial factors: internal \ninnovative efforts, socially and territorially embedded factors, and more or less \nspatially-bound knowledge spillovers.

The difficulties \nof operationalising some of the factors in systemic and knowledge spillover \napproaches, given existing statistical information, provides an additional barrier for \ncross-fertilisation. In this section we propose a simple model which tries to combine \nthe key factors from these three approaches in order to study how they affect \ninnovation and how innovation influences economic growth. The model is aimed at \nunderstanding \u2013 and, to a certain extent, discriminating among \u2013 the role of the \ndifferent innovation factors proposed by different strands in order to generate \neconomic dynamism in the regions of the EU-25 after 1995. As presented in Table 1, \nthe model combines inputs in the innovation process (R&D expenditure) with the \nsocio-economic local factors that make the presence of favourable regional systems of \ninnovation more likely and controls for the wealth of European regions. These factors \nare considered locally, i.e. the R&D and the local conditions in the region being \nconsidered, and externally, i.e. the conditions in neighbouring regions. Finally we \ncontrol for the influence of national factors, such as the presence of national systems \nof innovation, by the introduction of a set of national dummies.  \n \n[Insert Table 1 around here] \n \n By developing the framework above, we obtain the following model: \n\u03b5\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 ++++++++=\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\nDExtGDPcaperExtSocFiltSpillovSocFilterRDy\nY\nY\nT TtiTtiTtiTtiTtiTtiTti\nti\n7,6,5,4,3,2,1\n,\n, )ln(ln1\n(1)\n  \nwhere:  \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212Tti\nti\nY\nY\nT\n,\n,ln1  \nis the usual logarithmic transformation of the ratio of regional per \ncapita GDP in region i at the two extremes of the period of \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

Local R&D \nexpenditure is also frequently used as a proxy for the local capability to adapt to \ninnovation produced elsewhere (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Maurseth and \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

There are, however, measurement problems associated to this \nvariable that must be borne in mind, as they may partially hide the contribution of \nR&D towards economic performance. First, the relevant time lag structure for the \neffect of R&D activities on productivity and growth is unknown and may vary \nsignificantly across sectors (Griliches, 1979). Second, as pointed out by Bilbao-\nOsorio and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose (2004) for the case of European regions, the returns from \npublic and private R&D investments may vary significantly. Furthermore, the fact \nthat not all innovative activities pursued at the firm level are classified as formal \n\u2018Research and Development\u2019 may be a source of further bias in the estimations. \nHaving acknowledged these points, we assume R&D expenditure is a proxy for \u201cthe \nallocation of resources to research and other information-generating activities in \nresponse to perceived profit opportunities\u201d (Grossman and Helpman, 1991, p.6) in \norder to capture the existence of a system of incentives (in the public and the private \nsector) towards intentional innovative activities.  \n \nSocial Filter \u2013 The multifaceted concept of \u2018social filter\u2019 is introduced in the analysis \nby means of a composite index, which combines a set of variables describing the \nsocio-economic realm of the region. In particular, the variables which seem to be \nmore relevant for shaping the social filter of a region are those related to three main \ndomains: educational achievements (Lundvall, 1992; Malecki, 1997), productive \nemployment of human resources, and demographic structure (Fagerberg et al., 1997; \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1999). For the first domain, the educational attainment (measured by \nthe percentage of the population and of the labour force having completed higher \neducation) and participation in lifelong learning programmes are used as an indication \nof the accumulation of skills at the local level. For the second area, the percentage of \nlabour force employed in agriculture and long-term unemployment are included in the \nanalysis. The reasons for choosing these two variables are related to the traditionally \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

The role of long term \nunemployment as an indicator of both the rigidity of the labour market and of the \npresence of individuals whose possibilities of being involved in productive work are \npersistently hampered by inadequate skills (Gordon, 2001) is the reason behind the \ninclusion of this variable. The percentage of population aged between 15 and 24 was \nused as our measure of the demographic structure. It represents a proxy for the flow of \nnew human resources entering the labour force and thus of the renewal of the existing \nstock of knowledge and skills. The European Commission has made explicit the \nchallenges of an ageing population when regions have to rely on the benefits of a \nknowledge based society and highlighted \u201cthe risk of a slower spread of new \ntechnologies that could be associated with ageing\u201d (European Commission, 2006; \np.6).  \nFrom this perspective the percentage of young people is a particularly relevant \nindicator of the economic potential of a region, as far as its social filter is concerned. \n \nProblems of multicollinearity prevent the simultaneous inclusion of all these variables \nin our model. Principal Component Analysis is therefore applied to the set of \nvariables discussed above, in order to merge them into an individual indicator able to \npreserve as much as possible of the variability of the initial information. The output of \nthe Principal Component Analysis is shown in Table 2a.  \n \n[Insert Tables 2A and 2B around here] \n \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

These coefficients emphasize the educational dimension of the social \nfilter by assigning a large weight to the educational achievements of the population \n(0.576) and of the labour force (0.554) and to the participation in life long learning \nprogrammes (0.395). A negative weight is, as expected, assigned to the agricultural \nlabour force (-0.430) and, with a smaller coefficient, to long term unemployment (-\n0.140). The weight of the population between 15 and 24 is much smaller (0.019) in \nthis first principal component.

For this purpose we rely on a somewhat artificial4 distinction between \nintra-regional spillovers (i.e. those generated within the boundaries of the \ngeographical unit of analysis) and extra-regional spillovers (i.e. those accruing from \nneighbouring regions). The aggregate nature of the data prevents us from \ndistinguishing \u2013 within the boundaries of the individual region \u2013 between the impact \nof different sources of knowledge, that is to discriminate between the economic \nimpact of the effort produced by individual innovative actors from that of the \nexternalities produced by this process.

Conversely, extra-regional spillovers are proxied by a specific variable i.e. \nthe distance-weighted innovative activities pursued in neighbouring regions. Thus, \nwhile the effect of intra-regional spillovers is captured by the R&D investment \nvariable, where innovative activities pursued in the neighbouring regions are shown to \nexert a positive impact on local economic performance, there is also evidence in \nfavour of inter-regional spillover effects: knowledge produced in one region spills \nover into another (through the mechanisms discussed in the previous section), \ninfluencing its economic performance. Such spillover variable captures the \n\u2018aggregate\u2019 impact of innovative activities pursued in the neighbourhood (and its \nsensitivity to geographical distance), but does not allow us to single out whether and \nto what extent this process is the result of intentional (either market-mediated or non-\nmarket mediated contacts) knowledge flows or of unintentional spillovers5. The \nsignificance of this indicator suggests that accessibility to extra-regional innovation \npermits the inter-regional transfer of knowledge. In particular, in the framework \npresented in the previous section, face-to-face contacts enable the transmission of \nnon-codifiable knowledge which, in turn, has an impact on regional growth. \nFurthermore, the transmission of formally codified knowledge, which is less sensitive \nto proximity relationships for its diffusion, is also partially captured by this \u2018spatial\u2019 \nvariable. Even if the differential impact of formally codified knowledge flows \ndepends more on the local absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) than on \ngeographical constraints, research on patent citations suggests that proximity \nfacilitates a faster diffusion of the latter kind of knowledge as well (Sonn and Storper, \n2005). \n \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

Another major problem concerns endogeneity, which we address by \nincluding in the model the value of the explanatory variables as a mean over the five \nyears preceding the first year of the period of analysis (i.e. over the period [t-T-5, t-\nT]), while the average growth rate was calculated over the period  [t-T, t]8.

No spatial autocorrelation in the residuals was detected using \nMoran\u2019s I statistic10. \n \n[Insert Table 3 around here] \n \nSeveral implications can be extracted from the results of the empirical analysis. First \nis that the initial level of GDP per capita is significant in a few cases only, thus \nsuggesting that for the period under analysis, neither regional convergence, nor \ndivergence can be recorded (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Fratesi, 2004). Only when social \nconditions are explicitly controlled for (regressions 3, 10, 11 and 12) there is evidence \nof a weak degree of regional convergence. However, the magnitude of the \nconvergence parameter, where significantly different from zero, is in all cases very \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

For the European regions \nconsidered, investing in R&D seems to be a more important source of economic \ngrowth than relying of knowledge spillovers from neighbouring regions. When \nconsidering both factors together (Regression 1) the coefficient of local R&D \nexpenditure is positive and significant, while the impact of innovation generated \noutside the region is insignificant. Relying exclusively on local R&D inputs is, \nhowever, not a guarantee for achieving greater growth, as such relationship proves to \nbe not always robust when controlling for social conditions (the \u2018social filter\u2019 \nvariable). As highlighted in Regression 2, the local socio-economic conditions are a \nbetter predictor of economic growth than investment in R&D. The social filter \nvariable is always positively associated with economic growth and statistically \nsignificant. The relevance of the \u2018social filter\u2019 is enhanced when R&D investment and \nexposure to knowledge spillovers are considered in conjunction with local conditions \n(Regression 3). The results point out that having a good social filter increases the \npotential of European regions to assimilate spillovers, making local R&D expenditure \nirrelevant. These results highlight that while investing in R&D locally enhances \neconomic growth, relying of knowledge spillovers stemming from other regions is an \nimportant alternative source of competitive advantage where adequate socio-\neconomic structures \u2013 that would guarantee the reception and assimilation of those \nspillovers \u2013 exist. This does not mean that local innovative efforts are unimportant for \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

However, as far as knowledge may flow also from \noutside the region (both in the form of codified and non-codified knowledge \nspillovers), local socio-economic conditions may prove to be the true differential \ncompetitive factor by enabling the translation of all sources of knowledge into \nsuccessful innovation and economic growth.  \n \nIntroducing the individual sub-components of the social filter uncovers the specific \nimportance of the educational endowment of both the population and the labour force \nfor economic growth (Regressions 4 and 5). The role of life-long learning, the \npercentage of the labour force working in agriculture, the level of long term \nunemployment, and the demographic structure of the population, are, in contrast, not \nsignificant. Agricultural employment and long-term unemployment, in addition, limit \nthe capacity of regions to assimilate knowledge spillovers (Regressions 6 and 7). In \nthese cases, relying on knowledge spillovers is no substitute of local investment in \nR&D.  \n \nThe results underscore that accessibility to extra-regional innovation, our proxy for \nknowledge spillovers, is related in a positive and statistically significant way to \nregional growth performance, in particular when associated to an appropriate measure \nfor socio-economic conditions. This confirms that knowledge spillovers, by \nincreasing the \u2018amount of knowledge\u2019 available in the region, reinforce the effect of \nlocal innovative activities, and, to a certain extent, may even compensate for a weak \ncontribution of the innovative activities pursued locally. Thus, other things being \nequal, a region within an innovative neighbourhood is more advantaged than one in \nthe vicinity of less innovative areas. In contrast, both the socio-economic endowment \n(Regression 11) and the level of wealth (Regression 12) of neighbouring regions (i.e. \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

The \nextra-regional social filter is significant only when considered jointly with internal \nfeatures, as in Regression 10 where the total accessibility to innovation prone space is \nconsidered by including in a single variable both the region\u2019s features and that of its \nneighbourhood11. \n \nOn the basis of these results, the economic potential of a region is maximized when an \nappropriate set of social conditions is combined with local investment in R&D. The \nreception of R&D spillovers from neighbouring regions is an important additional \nsource of advantage which, in any case, requires an appropriate social infrastructure in \norder to be productively translated into innovation and economic growth. In this \nframework the analysis of the spatial scope of such spillovers, which we will discuss \nin the next subsection, becomes particularly important for understanding the role of \ngeography in a knowledge-based economy. \n \n4.3 The spatial extent of innovative spillovers \nUnderstanding the spatial scope of knowledge spillovers is extremely relevant from \nboth a theoretical and a public policy point of view. Even if, as discussed in section 2, \na variety of contributions provides significant evidence in support of the role of \nproximity as a relevant factor for the transmission of knowledge, in a recent review of \nthe research on geographical knowledge spillovers, D\u00f6ring and Schnellenbach (2006) \nhighlight that \u201cno consensus is reached about the spatial range that can be attributed to \nknowledge spillovers, and in fact the majority of studies refuse to quantify the range \nat all\u201d (p.384). Since the seminal work by Anselin et al. (1997) on the influence of the \nlocation of universities and private R&D facilities on local innovative productivity, \nthe spatial extent of knowledge flows in the US has been extensively studied.

Even if such results \nadjust downward the 75 mile radius previously measured by Varga (2000), the range \n50-75 miles provides a \u2018consolidated\u2019 measure for the geographical extent of \nknowledge spillovers in the US case. At the EU level, the scarcity (and heterogeneity) \nof research efforts in this direction have prevented the formation of any consensus. \nGreunz (2003) finds a positive and significant effect on local patenting activity of \ninnovative efforts pursued in first and second order neighbouring regions (190 miles \nor 306 Km on average). The magnitude of this effect sharply decreases when reaching \nthe third order neighbourhood (274 miles or 441 Km on average) and is no longer \nsignificant thereafter. Bottazzi and Peri (2003) find evidence of spillover effects, with \na positive impact of neighbouring regions\u2019 R&D efforts on local productivity, only \nwithin a 200-300 km limit. In the same vein, Moreno et al. (2005) estimate a similar \nspatial scope of regional spillovers: \u201cinnovative activity in a region is positively \nrelated to the level of innovative activity in regions located within 250 kilometres of \ndistance, but no further\u201d (p.7). Our analysis helps filling the existing gap in the \nempirical literature on the measure of the spatial extent of regional spillovers in the \nEU by including the regions of the entire EU25. In addition, our empirical analysis, \nwhile delivering comparable results, differs from previous studies in that: \na) it is not based on a Knowledge Production Function but on a regional growth \nmodel thus capturing the effects of neighbouring regions\u2019 innovative efforts on the \noverall productivity of the regional economy, rather than on the production of \ninnovative output only; \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

The regression not only confirms that knowledge \nflowing from neighbouring regions improves regional growth performance, as was \nunderlined before, but also shows that spillovers are geographically bounded and \ndecay with distance. The weighing mechanism on which the variable is based makes \nthe importance of other regions\u2019 innovative activities decrease with distance thus \nemphasizing the effect of innovative activities pursued in neighbouring regions.

When \nmore remote regions are taken into consideration, by fixing the cut off trip length at \n300 and 600 minutes (Regressions 3 and 4 respectively), the variable is no longer \nsignificant thus showing that beyond a 180 minute trip-time the returns to extra-\nregional innovative activities are inexistent. Such measure for the spatial extent of \nregional spillovers is, as discussed above, in line with the empirical evidence \nproduced so far. However, trip-length distance has allowed a more accurate measure \nof distance as a barrier to human interactions across geographical space. These results \nare confirmed also when total accessibility to innovative activities is considered by \nintroducing a variable capturing both internal and distance-weighed R&D expenditure \n(Regressions 5-12). In this second case the \u2018institutional\u2019 borders of the region are \novercome by focusing on a \u2018continuous\u2019 space which results from the aggregation, in \nan individual variable, of the total R&D expenditure that can be reached from a \ncertain location regardless of regional borders. In doing this, we aim to measure the \ntotal impact of R&D agglomeration on economic performance. \n  \nOur results show once again that only the variables combining the strength of internal \nefforts with those pursued in more proximate (within the 180 minutes limit) areas \nproduce a positive and significant effect on regional growth performance. The 180 \nminutes limit for interregional knowledge flows comes to reinforce the idea of a \n\u2018human-embodied\u2019 transmission technology since it allows the maximization of face-\nto-face contacts between agents. Agents within driving distance from one another can \nexchange their information face-to-face potentially on a daily basis, at a much lower \nmarginal cost in comparison to those where an overnight stay is necessary (Sonn and \nStorper, 2005).  \n \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

Conclusions  \nThe objective of this paper has been to analyse, for EU regions, the role played by the \ndifferent combinations of factors identified by different approaches to the study of \ninnovation, and to discriminate among them. The results of the empirical analysis \nuncover the importance not only of the traditional linear model local R&D innovative \nefforts, but also of the local socio-economic conditions for the genesis and \nassimilation of innovation and its transformation into economic growth across \nEuropean regions. In addition, it shows the importance of proximity for the \ntransmission of economically productive knowledge. The results highlight that not \nonly knowledge flowing from neighbouring regions improves regional growth \nperformance, but also that spillovers are geographically bounded and that there is a \nstrong distance decay effect, which in the European case expands to more or less a \n200 km radius. These outcomes shed additional light on the role of geography in the \nprocess of innovation, by supporting the idea of an existing tension between two \nforces: the increasingly homogeneous availability of standard \u2018codified\u2019 knowledge \nand the spatial boundedness of \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge and contextual factors. Such tension \nis an important force behind the present economic geography of European regions and \nits role is further accentuated by the underlying socio-economic differences.  \n \nThe analysis also has important regional policy implications. When innovation is \nrecognized as the key source of sustained economic growth, the mechanics of its \ncontribution to economic performance becomes crucial for an effective policy \ntargeting. In this respect the results of the analysis show that, in terms of innovation, a \nregion can rely on both internal and external sources of innovation, but that the socio-\neconomic conditions in order to maximize the innovation potential of each region are \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

R&D investment in core regions, which benefits from \nboth a location and social filter advantage, is overall more conducive to economic \ngrowth due to its impact on both local and neighbouring regions\u2019 performance. \nConversely, in peripheral regions investment in R&D may not yield the expected \nreturns. The limited R&D investment capacity of regions in the periphery, their \ninadequate social filters, and their lower exposure, because of their location, to R&D \nspillovers are likely to undermine the R&D effort conducted within the borders of \nthese regions. Does this mean that it is not worth investing in innovation in the \nperiphery? While investing in promoting innovation is likely to remain a key factor \nfor the development of peripheral regions in Europe, these sort of policies will need, \nmuch more than in the case of core regions, to be complemented by policies \nspecifically aimed at tackling the local social and economic barriers that prevent the \ngeneration and the reception and assimilation of innovation. This fundamentally \nimplies developing policies targeted at improving education, training, and skills, in \norder to guarantee not only greater returns from any innovation effort, but also \u2013 and \nperhaps more importantly in these environments \u2013 a better assimilation of knowledge \nspillovers generated in neighbouring regions and a better transformation of innovation \ninto economically productive activities.  \n \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.

In this paper we adopt the definition of \u2018knowledge\u2019 developed by D\u00f6ring and \nSchnellenbach (2006): we understand \u201cknowledge as comprising all cognitions \nand abilities that individuals use to solve problems, make decisions and \nunderstand incoming information (\u2026), knowledge is a tool that can be \nconsciously used by individuals\u201d (p.377). \n2.

As discussed in the previous section there is no reason that knowledge should stop \nspilling over just because of the (often arbitrary) boundaries of the NUTS regions \non which the analysis is based. \n5.  Taking into account these caveats, our measurement of spillovers represents not \nonly \u2018pure knowledge externalities\u2019 but also, more generally, the broader set of \nknowledge flows produced by any external source and appropriated by local \ninnovative agents. \u201cThe pathways by which knowledge spills over in this way are \nmany and various; they include written texts, informal conversations, input-output \nlinks, inter-firm mobility of workers, strategic alliances and so on\u201d (Scott, 2006, \np.9). The analysis of such pathways is outside the scope of this paper which, in \nthis regard, inevitably shares the limitations of other studies based on a similar \napproach (compare Breschi and Lissoni, 2001). \n6.  The indicator of accessibility to innovation used in this article is purely \ngeographical. While we acknowledge that geographical distance may neither be a \nsufficient, nor a necessary condition for the assimilation of spillovers, and \ncognitive, organizational, social, and institutional proximity play an important role \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Crescenzi, Riccardo (2008) Research and development, spillovers, innovation systems, and the genesis \nof regional growth in Europe.
