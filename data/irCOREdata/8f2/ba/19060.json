There was some evidence of an increased risk of AML and CLL. The meta-analysis \nindicated a lack of association between benzene exposure and the risk of CML.\nBackground\nLe Noire and Claude published in 1897 the first report on\nthe possible role of occupational exposure to benzene in\nthe development of leukemia [1]. Since then a substantial\nnumber of epidemiologic studies in different occupa-\ntional groups have assessed benzene exposure and made\nattempts to quantify the magnitude of risk related to such\nexposure. In 2005, Schnatter and colleagues published a\nsystematic review of the available 22 epidemiologic stud-\nies of the relation between benzene exposure and leuke-\nmia subtypes [2]. They concluded that there was\nconsistent evidence that the risk of acute myeloid leuke-\nmia (AML) is related to benzene exposure with an indica-\ntion of a dose-response pattern, and a suggestion for\nchronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), whereas the data for\nchronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic\nleukemia (ALL) are sparse. They did not present any\nquantitative assessment of these relations. To our knowl-\nedge there are no previous meta-analyses that have esti-\nmated the effect of exposure to benzene on the risk of\nleukemia taking into account the cumulative exposure\nfrom individual studies. To bridge this gap in current\nknowledge, we synthesized the existing epidemiologic\nevidence on the relation between occupational exposure\nto benzene and the risk of any leukemia and the risks of\n* Correspondence: jouni.jaakkola@oulu.fi\n1 Institute of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of \nBirmingham, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\u00a9 2010 Khalade et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The search command was further\nrefined to include any leukemia combined [leukemia,\nlymphoid] and the subgroups of leukemia, including\nAML, CML, and CLL. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale\n(NOS) was used to assess the quality of papers. The arti-\ncles from the search were then screened according to the\nfollowing a priori inclusion criteria:\n(1) Provides information that can be used to estimate \nthe relation between benzene exposure and cancer \nrisk (effect size) in terms of odds ratio (OR), relative \nrisk (RR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), stan-\ndardized relative risk (SRR), cumulative incidence \nratio (CIR), or standardized incidence rate ratio (SIR);\n(2) Original study;\n(3) Provides comparable measures of effect estimates \nand\/or cumulative exposure to benzene\n(4) Is a cohort, case-control or cross-sectional study \nin design; and\n(5) Includes occupationally active adults as a study \npopulation.\nThe selection of studies was based on a clearly defined\nsearch strategy. In addition to the primary Medline and\nEmbase searches, we identified references that were cited\nby the articles identified in the primary database\nsearches. Many of these secondary references directly\ninvestigated the relation between benzene exposure and\ncancer risk with leukemia being the main cancer. Two\nobservers independently checked the eligibility of the\nstudies according to a priori set inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, and identified the most appropriate effect or\nprevalence estimates. There was little disagreement\nbetween the two observers and these were settled by dis-\ncussion. Incompatibility of the exposure or outcome cri-\nteria with our preset criteria was the main reason for\nexclusion.\nDuplicate reports of studies were rejected and the study\nwith the longest follow-up period or the most recent\nstudy of the cohort were chosen. All studies providing\nsufficient information on the relation between work\nexposure to benzene and leukemia were included, irre-\nspective of whether this question was their primary or\nsecondary objective, as measuring benzene alone was\nvery unlikely due to fact that other chemicals were often\npresent in the workplace alongside. The references of all\nincluded and excluded studies were further screened to\nidentify any relevant papers. The definitions of the out-\ncomes were based on the codes of the International Clas-\nsification of Diseases (ICD) Revision 10 as follows any\nleukemia (C91-95), acute lymphocytic leukemia (C91.0),\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (C91.1), acute myeloid\nleukemia (C92.0) and chronic myeloid leukemia (C92.1).\nA total of 15 papers which provided 16 effect estimates\nfor the risk of leukemia in relation to benzene exposure\nwere selected. Of these three studies applied codes of\nICD revision 8, ten studies used revision 9, one revision 8\nonwards, and one revision 6-9. There were no studies\nreporting classifications based on ICD-10 although it was\navailable for use from 1992.\nData extraction\nTwo co-authors (AK, JJ) independently examined the\npapers and identified and recorded the main characteris-\ntics of the study including: (1) author(s) with the year of\npublication; (2) study design; (3) size of study population;\n(4) study group; (5) geographical location; (6) time win-\ndow of exposure; (7) exposure assessment; (8) study out-\ncome; (9) effect estimate for given exposure category; (10)\nstudy selection criteria; (11) comparability in terms of\nconfounders accounted for in the studies, for example\nsmoking, age, socio-economic status; (12) the outcome\nfor cohort studies and the exposure ascertained for case-\ncontrol studies; and (13) the overall quality of the based\non (10), (11) and (12). We defined the categories for\ncumulative exposure on as low from > 0 to < 40, medium\nfrom 40 to < 100 and high 100+ parts per million (ppm)-\nyears. The two sets of data were then grouped together to\nidentify any discrepancy in recording of the findings, and\nsuch discrepancies were then reviewed and re-assessed\nfor the final recording.\nAssessment of study quality\nWe applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess\nthe quality of the specific studies. The NOS for cohort\nand case-control studies includes the following items: 1)\nrepresentativeness of the exposed cohort\/adequacy of\ncase definition; 2) selection of the non-exposed cohort\/\nrepresentativeness of the cases; 3) ascertainment of expo-\nsure\/selection of controls; 4) demonstration that outcome\nof interest was not present at start of study\/definition of\ncontrols; 5) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the\ndesign or analysis\/comparability of cases and controls on\nthe basis of the design or analysis; 6) assessment of out-\ncome\/ascertainment of exposure; 7) sufficiency of follow-\nup for outcomes to occur\/similarity of method of ascer-\ntainment for cases and controls; and 8) adequacy of fol-\nlow-up of cohorts\/non-response rate. A star can be\nawarded for good quality for each item (except 1-2 stars\nKhalade et al. Environmental Health 2010, 9:31\nhttp:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/9\/1\/31\nPage 3 of 8for item 5) resulting in a range of 0-9 stars, more stars\nindicating higher quality.\nStatistical methods\nWe first calculated summary effect estimates for the four\noutcomes (Leuk, AML, CLL, CML) by using both the\nfixed-effects and random-effects models. The fixed-\neffects model applied the general variance-based method\nwith inverse variances of individual study effect estimates\nas weights [3]. The random-effects model applied the\nmethod of DerSimonian and Laird [3]. The natural log of\nthe effect estimates and its standard error were calculated\nfrom the effect estimates and confidence intervals (CI)\npresented in the articles. We ran the Stata version 10 for\nthe fixed- and random-effects models by using the \"meta\"\ncommand. The Q statistics and subgroup analysis were\nthen applied to address potential heterogeneity between\nstudy-specific effect estimates. Finally, we conducted a\ndose-response analysis in a meta-regression model of\nln(effect estimate) by average cumulative exposure in the\nexposure category.\nResults\nStudies\nThe Medline and Embase search identified a total of 466\narticles. We screened the abstracts, and excluded 287 as\nbeing clearly irrelevant or duplicates of the same study.\nThe remaining 179 abstracts were then evaluated using a\npriori inclusion criteria (see Methods). A total of 14 arti-\ncles met the selection criteria for inclusion and 165 were\nexcluded. The reasons for exclusion were: no information\non the relation of interest (n = 121) and\/or no quantita-\ntive effect estimate or sufficient figures to calculate an\neffect estimate (n = 29) and\/or duplicate publication of\nthe same data (n = 7). Some studies provided no informa-\ntion on cumulative exposure to benzene (n = 8). The\nincluded articles cited additional 23 seemingly relevant\narticles of which one was included. The meta-analysis\nwas based on 15 articles with 16 effect estimates summa-\nrized in Additional File 1: Table S1. Similar review pro-\nduced 8 articles with 9 effect estimates for AML, 10 for\nCLL, 6 for CML and no articles for ALL. These fifteen\nstudies were grouped according to the weighted average\nof the cumulative exposure. Additional file 2 lists the\nstudies cited in the narrative systematic review by\nSchnatter et al. [2] but not included in the present meta-\nanalysis.\nDesign characteristics\nFrom the 15 included studies, 10 were published in 1996-\n2004, [4-14] and the remaining five were published more\nrecently in 2005-2008 (Additional File 1:Table S1) [15-\n19]. A total of 12 studies were cohort studies, and the\nremaining three were case-control studies. Seven studies\nwere carried out in Europe (United Kingdom, Nether-\nlands Sweden, Norway, Italy), one in Canada, five in the\nUnited States of America, one in China, and one in Aus-\ntralia. Additional File 1: Table S1 shows the workplace\nsettings where the benzene exposure took place.\nExposure assessment and effect estimates\nThe exposure assessment of 9 studies was based on work-\nplace exposure measurements and\/or job exposure\nmatrix. Three studies used work histories and\/or benzene\nair concentrations. The remaining three studies defined\nexposure on the basis of employment in a given industry,\nand compared cancer mortality between the industry and\ngeneral population. A total of 9 studies presented cumu-\nlative exposure.\nTen studies provided effect estimates in relative risks\nand odds ratios and five studies presented SMRs. SMRs\nwere converted into relative risks to provide uniform esti-\nmates of the effect size (ES) for the meta-analysis. The\neffect estimates from the studies varied considerably\nfrom ES of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.20-4.67) to ES of 11.3 (95% CI,\n2.85-45.1). Most studies presented effect estimates for\nseveral different cancer types, however only effect esti-\nmates for \"any leukemia\", AML, CLL and CML were\nextracted for this analysis.\nBenzene exposure and the risk of any of leukemia\nAdditional File 1: Table S1 illustrates the study-specific\neffect estimates for any leukemia, as well as for the three\nleukemia subgroups used in the meta-analysis. Nine stud-\nies provided effect estimates based on cumulative expo-\nsure to benzene, which were categorized in to low,\nmedium, and high exposure. The remaining five studies\npresented SMRs comparing mortality rates between\nexposed cohorts and general population. Figure 1 shows a\nforest plot of all the study-specific effect estimates, the\nweights of the studies, and the summary effect estimate\nwith the 95% confidence interval. Additional File 3: Table\nS3 presents the summary-effect estimates based on all 15\navailable studies (16 estimates), 9 studies with cumulative\nexposure categories, and 5 studies without quantitative\nexposure information.\nIn the fixed-effects model the summary effect size for\nbenzene exposure was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.23-1.57), indicat-\ning a significantly increased risk of leukemia. However,\nboth the I2 index (56.5%) and Q statistics (34.47) revealed\nstrong heterogeneity between the study-specific esti-\nmates (Additional File 3: Table S3). The random-effects\nmodel that allowed for heterogeneity yielded a summary\nES of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37-2.17). Additional File 3: Table S3\nshows also summary-effect estimates for three levels of\nexposure, low (based on 8 studies), medium (6 studies),\nand high exposure (7 studies). Taking into account the\naverage level of cumulative exposure in each study practi-\nKhalade et al. Environmental Health 2010, 9:31\nhttp:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/9\/1\/31\nPage 4 of 8cally eliminated heterogeneity, so the variable exposure\nlevels seemed to explain the heterogeneity observed in\nthe overall estimate. The summary-effect estimates for\nlow (1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39), medium (1.90, 95% CI 1.26-\n2.89), and high exposure (2.62, 95% CI 1.57-4.39) showed\na clear dose-response pattern. The summary-effect esti-\nmate based on studies providing no dose information was\nslightly lower, 1.25 (95% CI 1.09-1.44).\nTo further elaborate the dose-response pattern we fit-\nted a meta-regression model for ln(effect estimate) by\naverage cumulative exposure to benzene. There were sev-\neral effect estimates for different contrasts: eight esti-\nmates for low vs. reference, six for medium vs. reference\nand seven for high vs. reference category. The meta-\nregression model showed a moderate, statistically signifi-\ncant association with the R-squared value of 37% and P\nvalue of < 0.05.\nThe potential for publication bias was assessed by pro-\nducing a funnel plot shown in Figure 2 The vertical line\nindicates the summary-effect estimate from the fixed-\neffects model (1.40), and the corresponding pseudo 95%\nconfidence limits converging as a function of the stan-\ndard error (SE) of the effect estimate. The smaller studies\nwith large SEs of ln OR seem to be scattered symmetri-\ncally around the summary-effect estimate, whereas the\nfunnel plot shows substantial heterogeneity among the\nlarge studies with small SEs, with an imbalance toward\nlarge positive effect estimate. The pattern differs from a\ntypical publication bias, in which the effect estimate from\nthe small studies would be biased towards large positive\nvalues.\nBenzene exposure and the risk of acute myeloid leukemia \n(AML)\nThe study-specific effect estimates for the relation\nbetween benzene exposure and the risk of AML appear in\nAdditional File 1:Table S1. Additional File 3: Table S3\nsummarizes the results of the meta-analysis on AML. In\nthe main analysis based on 9 articles, the fixed-effects\nmodel yielded a summary-effect estimate of 1.38 (95% CI,\n1.15-1.64), and the study-specific effect estimates were\nhomogeneous (I2 index 51.4%, Q statistic of 16.46, P\n0.036) (Figure 3).

The summary estimate from the fixed-effects\nmodel was 1.40 (95% CI 1.23-1.57), but the study-specific\nestimates were heterogeneous. Focusing on 9 studies that\nprovided information on cumulative exposures and strat-\nifying the effect estimates according to the magnitude of\ncumulative exposure eliminated the heterogeneity. The\nsummary-effect estimate was 1.64 (1.13-2.39) for low,\n1.90 (1.26-2.89) for medium, and 2.62 (1.57-4.39) for high\nexposure, showing evidence of a dose-response relation.\nThe summary effect estimate for the studies which did\nnot have dose information was lower 1.25 (1.09-1.44).\nAlso the meta-regression model was consistent with a\ndose-response pattern. The results provided some evi-\ndence of an increased risk for AML and CLL. The meta-\nanalysis indicated consistently a lack of association\nbetween benzene exposure and the risk of CML. There\nwas not sufficient information on ALL.\nThe outcome assessment in all the specific studies was\nbased on an ICD-diagnosis. Although there was a signifi-\ncant association between exposure to benzene and the\nbroad category of any leukemia (ICD C91-95), there was\nsubstantial heterogeneity in the effects on specific leuke-\nmia ranging from a strong summary effect for AML to no\neffect for CML. Our results indicate that the use of the\nbroad category of any leukemia underestimates the mag-\nnitude of the effect on AML. Although the summary-\neffect estimates for any leukemia, as well as for AML and\nCLL indicated an increased risk, the study-specific effect\nestimates presented strong heterogeneity.\nWe were able to retrieve some type of quantitative esti-\nmate for cumulative exposure to benzene from 9 studies.\nAdditional File 1: Table S1 displays estimates of cumula-\ntive exposure for different exposure categories. Although\nexposure assessment varied between the studies, each\nstudy applied similar approaches to different levels of\nexposure. Use of exposure categories based on cumula-\ntive exposure reduced or practically eliminated this het-\nerogeneity, suggesting that different amounts of benzene\nexposure in different studies explained the heterogeneity\nobserved in the overall risk estimates. For example, for\nany leukemia the effect estimate for better quality studies\n(NOS 6-9) was 1.32 (95% CI 1.15-1.51), and for others\n(NOS 0-5) 1.79 (1.34-2.38). The summary-effect esti-\nmates for studies without dose information were pre-\nsented mainly as standardized mortality ratios using\nexternal cancer mortality rates as the reference group.\nTheir estimates were systematically lower than those\nfrom the studies providing data for dose-response analy-\nses. A funnel plot analysis of studies on benzene exposure\nand leukemia risk did not show any suggestion of publica-\ntion bias [20].\nSeveral studies have been published since the most\nrecent systematic reviews [2,21,22] on benzene and leu-\nFigure 3 Forest plot showing the studies providing an estimate of the relation between exposure to benzene and the risk of acute myeloid \nleukemia.

This finding was\nconsistent across the reviewed studies except a Chinese\nstudy by Wong. This early review reported no consistent\nevidence for ALL, CML, or CLL in relation to benzene\nexposure. In 1997, Savitz and Andrews reviewed epide-\nmiologic research on lymphatic and hematopoietic can-\ncers. They identified 14 studies, three community-based\nand 11 industry-based, on benzene and total leukemia\nand 16 studies, nine community-based and seven indus-\ntry-based, on benzene and specific histologic types of\nleukemia [22]. However, they did not conduct any meta-\nanalyses. They concluded that the \"epidemiologic evi-\ndence linking benzene to leukemia in the aggregate, as\nwell as acute and chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leuke-\nmia, is no less persuasive than that for AML alone\", but\ndid not suggest any quantitative estimates.\nIn the most recent systematic review published in 2005,\nSchnatter and colleagues assessed 22 industry-based\ncohort and case-control studies. A high and significant\nAML risk was reported across study designs, especially in\nmore highly exposed workers of rubber, shoe, and paint\nindustry. Results on CLL were controversial with an\nincreased risk in nested case-control studies, but with no\nincrease in cohort studies. Data for ALL and CML were\ndeemed sparse and inconclusive [2].\nThe results of our systematic review both strengthen\nthe evidence of the effect of benzene exposure on leuke-\nmia risk, and provide quantitative estimates of effect size.\nWe detected substantial heterogeneity between the dif-\nferent types of leukemia, which reduces the relevance of\nthe overall estimate. Thus we also assessed the leukemia-\nspecific effect sizes. The risk of AML was estimated to be\ntwo-fold for cumulative exposure below 40 ppm-years,\n2.3-fold for exposures from 40 ppm-years to below 100\nppm-years, and over 3-fold for exposures 100 ppm-years\nand above. These estimates indicated an increased risk\nrelated to substantially lower dose than that suggested by\nLamm and colleagues [21]. As a new contribution, our\nresults also show that the available evidence is consistent\nwith no effect on CML. Our results strengthen the evi-\ndence that benzene exposure also increases the risk of\nCLL, suggesting a dose-response pattern, although the\neffect estimate for the highest exposure category is based\non a single study. Consistently with the previous reports,\nwe found that there is no sufficient evidence to make any\ninference on the effects of benzene exposure to ALL.\nConclusions\nOur study provides consistent evidence that exposure to\nbenzene at work increases the risk of leukemia with a\ndose-response pattern. The results showed some evi-\ndence of an increased risk for AML and CLL. The meta-\nanalysis indicated consistently a lack of association\nbetween benzene exposure and the risk of CML. The evi-\ndence was insufficient to make any inference on the\neffects on ALL. For the purposes of clinical, occupational\nhealth, and policy implications, it is important to note\nthat a significantly increased risk of any leukemia and\nAML was observed already in relation to the low benzene\nexposure and that the risk varied according to the type of\nleukemia.\nIn 1946, The American Conference of Governmental\nIndustrial Hygienists set the first occupational exposure\nlimit for benzene to 325 mg\/m3 (100 ppm), and in 1963\nthe limit was reduced to 35 ppm. Currently most Euro-\npean and North American countries have harmonised\nthe limit to 1.63-3.25 mg\/m3 (0.5-1 ppm) This recent fig-\nure was agreed within the European Union in 1997 and\nwas adopted within standard setting committee [23].\nAdditional material\nAbbreviations\nALL: Acute lymphocytic leukemia; AML: Acute myeloid leukemia; CLL: Chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia; CML: Chronic myeloid leukemia; CIR: Cumulative inci-\ndence ratio; ICD: International Classification of Diseases; OR: Odds ratio; NOS:\nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale; RR: Relative risk; SIR: Standardized incidence rate ratio;\nSRR: Standardized relative rate; SMR: Standardized mortality ratio.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAK conducted the literature search, reviewed the articles, conducted the statis-\ntical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
