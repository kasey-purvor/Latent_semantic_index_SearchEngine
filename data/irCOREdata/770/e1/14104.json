The paper concludes by\ndiscussing the implications for research of adopting such a perspective.\nKeywords: mobile learning; context; activity theory\nIntroduction\nPortable devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, laptops and tablet\nPCs have become increasingly integrated into many facets of our daily activities, including\neducation. The number of mobile phone owners has risen in the last few years (e.g. 75% of the\ngeneral population in the UK, 90% of young adults) (Crabtree et al. 2003) and the capabilities of\nthese devices are increasing at a steady rate.\nPortables are used in education to support students\u2019 learning inside and outside the classroom\n(Demb, Erickson, and Hawkins-Wilding 2004), lifelong learning (Sharples 2000) and location-\nbased experiences (Price et al. 2003; Weal et al. 2003). Some educational institutes provide\nstudents and academics with portable technologies to be used for learning and teaching (Zelin and\nBaird 2002; Demb, Erickson, and Hawkins-Wilding 2004; McVay, Snyder, and Graetz 2005), as\nthese devices are believed to offer portability, accessibility and convenience (Kukulska-Hulme,\nEvans, and Traxler 2005). In addition, as reported by Savill-Smith and Kent (2003) in their study\non the use of palmtop computers, these devices are relatively inexpensive, provide access to\ninformation and promote the development of information literacy, collaborative learning and\nindependent learning, all within the context of students\u2019 learning.\nMany researchers in the field are interested in empirically studying mobile learning by explor-\ning the possibilities and constraints introduced by mobile technologies for teaching and learning\nin different settings. For example, Waycott (2002) studied the possibilities and constraints intro-\nduced by PDAs that can change the activity of reading course material. She used activity theory\nto analyse PDAs as new tools for reading and to consider the context in which these devices are\nused. She conducted the study on a higher education online course, where students were given\n*Corresponding author. Email: ewali@ioe.ac.uk\n42  E. Wali et al.\nPDAs as a medium for reading course material. The study found that the portability of PDAs was\nthe main benefit for students\u2019 reading course materials using these devices. The devices provided\naccess to course material anytime and anywhere, thus changing the way students undertook read-\ning. However, the limitations of PDAs, such as their small screen size and poor screen quality,\nlimited their usability for reading activities. As a result, the devices did not replace the tools\nstudents usually used to support reading; instead they were used in conjunction with printed\ncourse materials and desktop computers.\nAnother example of mobile learning research is the educational game \u2018Savannah\u2019, developed\nby NESTA Futurelab and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories (Facer et al. 2004). \u2018Savannah\u2019 helps\nchildren to learn about lion behaviour by exploring a virtual savannah. The project aimed to\n\u2018explore how using mobile technologies in direct physical interaction with space and other play-\ners can be combined with principles of engagement and self-motivation to create a powerful and\nengaging learning experience\u2019 (Facer et al. 2004, 399). The game requires a group of six children\nto collaborate and play together, moving around the playing field, exploring the varied terrain of\nthe savannah and discovering the resources that lions need to survive. The researchers found that\nthe game successfully encouraged collaborative learning and the players reported enjoying the\nexperience and learning about lions.\nDespite the numbers of interesting studies, a well-conceptualized understanding of mobile\nlearning has not emerged. Our aim is to clarify current misconceptions and to propose a definition\nof mobile learning that takes an activity theoretic approach and does not suffer from the\nobjections one may raise against the definitions in current use.\nMobile learning\nDifferent researchers have defined the term \u2018mobile learning\u2019 in a variety of ways. Some focused\non the mobility of the devices and, hence, developed techno-centric definitions. In these defini-\ntions mobile learning is characterized as learning using mobile devices such as PDAs or mobile\nphones. For example, Kukulska-Hulme, Evans, and Traxler (2005, 1) defined wireless and\nmobile learning as \u2018learning delivered, enhanced or supported mainly or solely by wireless and\nmobile devices and their technologies\u2019. However, the researchers admit that the definition is\nlimited, as it places great emphasis on the technology and too little on learning. They called for a\ndefinition that focuses on the learning and the experiences of the learner. Lehner and N\u00f6sekabel\n(2002, 103) shared the same emphasis. They defined mobile education as \u2018any service or facility\nthat supplies a learner with general electronic information and educational content that aids in the\nacquisition of knowledge regardless of location and time\u2019. In addition, Sharma and Kitchens\n(2004) defined mobile learning as learning that is supported by mobile devices, ubiquitous\ncommunications technology and intelligent user interfaces.\nHowever, we believe that these definitions focus more on the technology than learning itself.\nIn addition, they ignore learning that is not mediated by the use of portable technologies or learn-\ning that is mediated by traditional devices such as handouts, even when, intuitively, this might be\nclassified as mobile. O\u2019Malley et al. (2003) shared this emphasis, as the researchers argued that\nmobile learning is any sort of learning that happens when the learner is not at a fixed, predeter-\nmined location. The definition discards the properties and type of device used to facilitate learn-\ning and focuses on the mobility of the learner rather than the mobility of the devices used.\nHowever, the researchers still argued that the employment of certain types of technology is what\ndifferentiates mobile learning from other types of learning; in spite of their theoretical position\nthey retain their technical emphasis.\nOther researchers defined mobile learning as an extension to e-learning. For example,\nQuinn (2000) defined mobile learning as \u2018elearning through mobile computational devices:\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  43\nPalms, Windows CE machines, even your digital cell phone\u2019. He described his vision of\nmobile learning as the intersection of mobile computing and e-learning where people have\naccess to resources, search capabilities, rich interaction and support for effective learning and\nperformance-based assessment. Quinn (2000) visualised mobile learning as \u2018elearning indepen-\ndent of location in time or space\u2019. In addition, Traxler (2005) defined mobile learning as \u2018any\neducational provision where the sole or dominant technologies are hand-held or palmtop\ndevices\u2019. He argued that the definition \u2018merely puts mobile learning somewhere on e-learning\u2019s\nspectrum of portability\u2019. Although these definitions look at e-learning provision, they remain\ntechno-centric as they focus on the type of device used. For example, Traxler (2005) admitted\nthat his definition is limited as it is \u2018rather techno-centric, not very stable and based around a\nset of devices\u2019. In addition, these definitions are limited because they are based on the defini-\ntion of e-learning, which itself is difficult to conceptualize. This hinders identifying the unique\nnature of mobile learning.\nWhen these definitions, both techno-centric and those based on e-learning, are applied to real\nworld examples many borderline cases where learning cannot be defined as mobile or static\nappear. This is because these definitions are based on the assumption that mobile learning occurs\nas a result of using portable technologies to aid learning in different physical locations. The defi-\nnitions are focused on the technology rather than the learning practices that are mediated by the\ntechnology. They also discard all learning that is not mediated by the use of portable technologies.\nIn addition, the definitions place overt emphasis on a change of physical location while discarding\nthe social setting of learning activities. This point was addressed by Roschelle (2003), who illus-\ntrated the importance of understanding the social practices involved in using hand-held devices\nto facilitate learning. He reviewed a number of studies that explored the use of hand-held devices,\nsuch as classroom response systems and their application in classrooms. A classroom response\nsystem allows a teacher to pose a question (e.g. short answer or multiple choice) and collect and\naggregate students\u2019 responses sent by individual hand-held response units. The review showed\nthat using portable devices does not make learning mobile as the activity space of technology\nusage is the classroom space (Roschelle and Pea 2002). Portable technologies in the reviewed\ncases were used during the class to achieve certain objectives and some could not be used outside\nthe classroom (e.g. classroom response systems). Roschelle (2003) argued that the case studies\nfailed to establish a link between informatics and social practices as the researchers in the\nreviewed studies provided little insight into the social practices of hand-held use, presuming that\nthe social practices surrounding education remain largely unchanged as the technology moves\nfrom desktops to hand-helds. He suggested that research attention should be directed towards\n\u2018understanding the social practices by which those new affordances become powerful educational\ninterventions\u2019.\nSome researchers considered the emphasis of the social practices surrounding learning activ-\nities to develop their conception of mobile learning. These researchers\u2019 conceptualization of\nmobile learning also started as techno-centric definitions focusing on devices (Sharples, Corlett,\nand Westmancott 2002) and the potential for enabling lifelong learning (Sharples 2000). Soon,\nhowever, the focus became the learner, who is mobile, rather than the technology. For example,\nO\u2019Malley et al. (2003) defined mobile learning as \u2018any sort of learning that happens when the\nlearner is not at a fixed, predetermined location, or learning that happens when the learner takes\nadvantage of learning opportunities offered by mobile technologies\u2019. In addition, Vavoula and\nSharples (2002) considered learning to be mobile in three ways: \nin terms of space, i.e. it happens at the workplace, at home, and at places of leisure; it is mobile\nbetween different areas of life, i.e. it may relate to work demands, self-improvement, or leisure; and\nit is mobile with respect to time, i.e. it happens at different times during the day, on working days or\non weekends.\n44  E. Wali et al.\nThese definitions diverted the focus from the technologies used to the mobility of the learner and\nthe context of usage that extends learning to informal learning settings.\nSharples, Taylor, and Vavoula (2007) are developing a theory of mobile learning that\naddresses the relations between mobile technology and learning. They seek to encompass both\nlearning supported by mobile devices and learning that is characterized by the mobility of people\nand knowledge. They argued that in order to create a theory of mobile learning, first, mobile\nlearning should be distinguished from other forms of learning by showing that learners: \n(1) learn across space as they take ideas and learning resources gained in one location and\napply or develop them in another;\n(2) learn across time by revisiting knowledge gained earlier in a different context which then\nprovides lifelong learning;\n(3) move from topic to topic by managing a range of personal learning projects instead of\nfollowing a single curriculum;\n(4) move in and out of engagement with technology.\nSecond, Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula argued that a theory of mobile learning must embrace the\nconsiderable learning that occurs outside the classroom and lecture halls. Third, it must be based\non contemporary accounts of practices that enable successful learning. Fourth, they suggest that\nthe theory must take account of the ubiquitous use of personal and shared technology.\nBased on this, Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula (2007, 224) proposed a definition of mobile\nlearning that focuses on the communicative interactions between the learner and the technology\nto advance learning in context that is shaped by continuously negotiated dialogue between people\nand technology. They defined mobile learning as \u2018the processes of coming to know through\nconversations across multiple contexts amongst people and personal interactive technologies\u2019,\nwhich they described as a tentative definition. They based their definition on the conversational\nframework (Laurillard 1993), in which the conception of learning is based on the idea that\ncommunication, which is a feature of portable devices, is a central process in education as it helps\npeople to negotiate their differences, understand each others\u2019 experiences and establish shared\nmeaning. The definition is also based on activity theory, which is used to study mobile learning\nin relation to the context of learning activities. They conceptualized the context of learning as\nboth the physical environment and the community (actors as both people and interactive technol-\nogies) that interact around shared objects.\nAs part of developing a theory of mobile learning Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula introduced\na framework for analysing mobile learning based on Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s (1987) expansive activity\nmodel. However, the framework was illustrated through a case study whose criteria were chosen\nfrom the data. Their illustration was descriptive rather than analytical, as they did not test their\nframework against other real world cases that do not match the framework exactly. The chosen\ncase reflects on the four criteria proposed by the researchers as a basis for the theory of mobile\nlearning discussed above. The case represents learning that occurs in an informal learning setting\n(a gallery) (second criterion) where visitors were supplied with the portable technologies (fourth\ncriterion) to be used throughout their journey in the gallery. Portables were used to look for infor-\nmation about the paintings in the gallery and to communicate with each other (third criterion).\nThe case represents mobile learning as learners used their devices to learn across space, time,\nmove from topic to topic and move in and out of engagement with technology (first criterion).\nWe believe that the definition of mobile learning of Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula represents\na useful first step towards a better conceptualized definition of the term. The definition focuses\non learning through conversations that take place across different contexts rather than locations,\nas in some of the previous definitions of the term. Critically, Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula concep-\ntualized context as the physical environment and the community that interacts around shared\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  45\nobjectives. This conceptualization helps with considering the community as being engaged in learn-\ning activities and the influence of these practices on learning. This gives a new perspective on\nmobile learning by considering factors other than location that influence it. However, Sharples,\nTaylor, and Vavoula\u2019s definition requires development. We believe that to understand mobile learn-\ning there needs to be a greater focus on learning practices that are directed towards the same objec-\ntives and take place across multiple contexts, instead of focusing on learners\u2019 communicative\ninteractions with their peers and technology. This helps with identifying mobile learning and differ-\nentiating it from static learning.\nBy de-emphasising the focus on communicative interactions we promote a definition of\nmobile learning that can be conceptualized using activity theory alone and, therefore, we do not\nrequire the conversational framework. The conversational framework is mainly helpful when\nthere is a need to understand how learners develop understanding of a specific matter through\nconversation with others or through \u2018conversation\u2019 with technology. This is not the case here, as\nwe focus on learning as practice and not as the internal development process. As a result, activity\ntheory is sufficient as an approach to defining mobile learning as it permits the study of learning\npractices, and is still able to account for communication between peers and technology by treating\ncommunication as an example of an activity, that are mediated by the use of tools in relation to\nthe context of these activities. We believe that focusing on context helps with considering the\nsetting of learning practices, comprising both the physical and social setting, which are believed\nto be essential in understanding learning practices (Roschelle 2003).\nGiven the limitations of the definitions of mobile learning, we believe that it is important to\nstudy mobile learning by focusing on learning activities that may be mediated by any kind of\ndevice (old or new) and the context of these activities, including both the social and physical\nsettings. Therefore, using an activity theory perspective, we propose an initial definition of\nmobile learning as learning that occurs as a result of pursuing learning activities that are directed\ntowards achieving some objective in multiple contexts (physical and social). This definition\nenables the study of real world cases to differentiate mobile and static learning. The theoretical\nframework outlined below draws on key concepts of activity theory that are of particular rele-\nvance in elaborating the definition. It provides a way of looking at learning activities and the\ncontinuity of these in multiple contexts. The concept of context is also illustrated below, as it\nrepresents a core concept of our conceptualization of mobile learning.\nActivity theory\nActivity theory was developed as an attempt to create a new form of psychology based on Marxist\nphilosophy (Leont\u2019ev 1978; Vygotsky 1978). Bannon (1997) and Kuutti (1996) demonstrated\nthat activity theory is not actually a \u2018theory\u2019 in the strict interpretation of the term, as it is not \u2018a\nfixed body of accurately defined statements\u2019 (Kuutti 1996, 25). Rather, it consists of a set of\nprinciples that are open to interpretation and can be used as a foundation for more specific\ntheories. The description presented here discusses the main concepts of activity theory that are\nhelpful in conceptualizing mobile learning.\nActivity theory is based on the idea that all human activities are mediated by the use of tools,\nboth physical tools, such as technology, and conceptual tools, such as language, that are enabling\nand limiting. An activity system involves a subject whose actions are directed towards the\nachievement of some object through the use of tools. The object of the activity is to be understood\nas the \u2018purpose\u2019, rather than an artefact, and towards which the activity is directed. The existence\nof an activity is motivated by transforming objects to outcomes. Engestr\u00f6m (1987) expanded the\nactivity system, shown in Figure 1, to include the social context of an activity represented in the\ncommunity, rules and division of labour, shown in Figure 1. The community includes the people\n46  E. Wali et al.\nthat are involved in an activity and who share the same object. The rules cover both explicit and\nimplicit norms, conventions and social relations within a community. The division of labour\nrefers to the explicit and implicit organization of a community as related to the transformation\nprocess of the object into the outcome (Kuutti 1996).\nFigure 1. Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of activity theoryActivity theory is used in research examining mobile learning (for example Sharples,\nTaylor, and Vavoula 2007) because it provides tools with which to study learners\u2019 activities that\nare mediated by the use of physical or conceptual tools. Therefore, from an activity theory\nperspective mobile learning should not be defined on the basis of the type of device used, as in\nsome of the definitions of the term, as this type of learning can be mediated by any type of phys-\nical (old or new) or conceptual (symbolic or embodied) tool. Activity theory also provides an\nhistorical perspective on learning activities. This facilitates studying mobile learning by show-\ning the continuity of learning activities that are directed towards the same objective in different\ncontexts. Nardi (1996) argued that activities and their elements are in continuous development.\nIn addition, the remains of previous activities are usually embedded in them as they develop,\nwhich requires historical analysis to understand the recent situation. Activity theory also places\ngreat emphasis on the relationship between context and human activities. Cole and Engestr\u00f6m\n(1991) suggested that in order to understand human activities it is crucial to understand how\nartefacts (such as tools and symbol systems) mediate the activity within the cultural context in\nwhich the activity is situated. In terms of studying mobile learning, studying context helps with\nunderstanding and considering the properties and constraints of the environment where learning\ntakes place and the impact of the relations among individuals, artefacts and social groups within\nthese learning activities.\nContext\nUnderstanding human activities requires understanding them within their context (Cole and\nEngstr\u00f6m 1991). The concept of \u2018context\u2019 has been a source of endless confusion for Anglo-\nAmerican psychologists. Over the last decade psychologists have come to distinguish between\ntwo general uses of the word. For example, Cole (1996) distinguished between context as \u2018that\n Object Outcome\nTransformation\nprocess\nDivision of \nlabour \nCommunityRules\nSubject\nTool\nFigure 1. Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of activity theory.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  47\nwhich surrounds us\u2019 and context as \u2018that which weaves together\u2019. In terms of the interactions\nbetween humans and technology these definitions map context as that which surrounds the human\nuser of the technology and context as that which arises from the constructive interaction between\npeople and technology.\nThe context that surrounds the human user of technology is roughly equivalent to the term\n\u2018environment\u2019 and refers to a set of circumstances with which the individual interacts and which\ninfluences individuals in various ways (Cole 2003). This is often represented as a set of concentric\ncircles representing the different levels of context. For example, a student using technology is part\nof a lesson that is part of a classroom that is part of a university that is part of a community (Cole\n1996). Understanding activities in relation to the environment where these take place helps with\nunderstanding how the task is shaped by the broader levels of context. In terms of the impact of\ncontext on learning activities, Sharples (2005) referred to the informational model of communi-\ncation developed by Shannon-Weaver. The model states that the context that surrounds the human\nuser of technology situates the learner in an environment from which the senses continually receive\ndata that are interpreted as meaningful information and employed to construct understanding.\nThe context that arises from the constructive interaction between people and technology can\nbe thought of as two moments in a single process that help in modifying objects to create support-\nive workspaces or forming ad hoc social networks of people with shared interests (Cole 1996).\nThis definition of context is more focused on the social setting of the learning activities, which\nnot only affects learning activities but is also affected by these activities. Vygotsky viewed\ncontext in this way, seeing humans as an embedded part of the social matrix so that their\nbehaviour cannot be understood independently of this matrix (Cole 2003).\nThe complexity of understanding context has started to feature in research on the design of\ntechnology. For example, Dourish (2004) argued that \u2018context\u2019 plays a central role in ubiquitous\ncomputing where computing is embedded in the world around us. He suggested that as computa-\ntion has moved \u2018off the desk\u2019 it is important to keep track of where it has gone, as the situations\nin which the technology is used became more variable and require further attention.\nDourish argued that since \u2018context\u2019 entered the area of computational design designers have\nhoped that incorporating context into interactive technologies can make these technologies more\nsensitive to the details of the specific setting of use. He relayed Suchman\u2019s (1987) critique that\nsocial scientists have often pointed out that conventional system designs fail to respond to the\nsetting in which the action unfolds. These conventional systems may be more responsive to the\ndifferent social settings in which they might be used, but they fail to address the sociological\ncritique, which makes turning social observations into technical design problematic.\nDourish suggested that the notion of context in ubiquitous computing has a dual origin. \nOn the one hand, it is a technical notion, one that offers system developers new ways to conceptualize\nhuman action and the relationship between that action and computational systems to support it. On\nthe other hand, it is also a notion drawn from social science, drawing analytic attention to certain\naspects of social settings. (Dourish 2004, 21)\nTo summarize, current conceptions of context in both social and technological research view it in\nterms of the features of the environment where learning takes place and the social setting of the\nlearning activities. We believe that for the definition of mobile learning both conceptions of\ncontext should be considered, because this type of learning occurs as a result of pursuing learning\nactivities across multiple locations. This helps in considering the factors that affect and are\naffected by the utilization of portable devices in multiple contexts, such as the impact of changes\nin the physical environment and the social setting within these environments on learning activi-\nties. Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula (2007) also considered both conceptions for the definition of\nmobile learning. However, what differentiates our approach is the way in which we understand\n48  E. Wali et al.\nthe interplay between the physical and the social conceptions of context and the way social\ncontext is conceptualized through activity theory.\nMobile learning and context\nUnderstanding learners\u2019 activities in relation to context is important in studying mobile learning\nas this type of learning occurs when learning activities are mediated by the use of tools (physical\nor conceptual) across different contexts. Therefore, we take context crossing as the basis for our\nconceptualization of mobile learning through activity theory. From an activity theory perspective\nwe consider context as a mixture of the physical features and constraints of the location where\nlearning activities take place and the social features of these activities, such as the social relations,\nnorms and conventions and the division of labour within the learners\u2019 community.\nExisting interpretations of activity theory for mobile learning\nActivity theory has been used as a framework for studying mobile learning because it provides a\nframework for studying activities that are mediated by the use of tools and accounts for the context\nof these activities. For example, Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula (2007) attempted to describe the\nactivity system of mobile learning through the use of Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s (1987) expansion of activity\ntheory by describing the relationship between people and technology. They used activity theory\nin combination with the conversational framework to indicate the importance of conversation and\ncontext in understanding mobile learning. Based on that, they developed a two layered version of\nEngestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of the activity system triangle. They argued that it is helpful to separate\ntwo layers of tool-mediated activities in order to analyse the activity of mobile learning. First, the\nsemiotic layer describes learning as a semiotic system where learners\u2019 object-oriented actions are\nmediated by cultural tools and signs. The learner internalizes public language that is instantiated\nin writing and conversation, which then provides the resources for the control and development\nof activity (Vygotsky 1978). Second, the technological layer represents learning as an engagement\nwith technology where tools, such as computers and mobile phones, are used as interactive agents\nin the process of coming to know. This layer creates a human\u2013technology system to mediate agree-\nments between learners (e.g. spreadsheets and concept maps) and aid recall and reflection (e.g.\nonline discussion lists). The researchers suggest that these two layers should not be separated from\neach other nor be superimposed; they should be put in a continual dynamic where they can be\nmoved together and apart, creating an engine that drives forward the analysis of mobile learning.\nFigure 2 shows Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula framework for analysing mobile learning.\nFigure 2. Framework for analysing mobile learning (adapted from Sharples et al. 2005)3 However, we believe that this framework is complicated because it introduces two layers to\nrepresent the semiotic and technological layers of an activity. We suggest that there is no need for\nthese layers, because what concerns us when studying mobile learning is the learning activities\nthat are mediated by the use of tools (physical or conceptual) in relation to the context of use\n(physical and social). Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of activity theory is sufficient for this as it has the\nability to represent human activities (including the semiotic and technological elements of such\nsystems) in relation to their context, eliminating the complexity introduced by the two layers\nproposed by Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula\u2019s framework. Therefore, our conceptualization of\nmobile learning will be based on Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of activity theory as it provides a frame-\nwork for studying learning activities that are mediated by any kind of tool (old or new, embodied\nor symbolic) and how these practices vary across physical location and considers the social\ncontext of learning activities through \u2018rules\u2019, \u2018community\u2019 and the \u2018division of labour\u2019. This\nmakes analysing the activity system of mobile learning simpler by focusing on the collective\ncontext embodied in the physical and social setting of learning activities.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  49\nApplication\nTo illustrate our conception of mobile learning we draw upon our experience of an ongoing\nproject in higher education which formed part of a Ph.D. research project investigating the\nconcept of mobile learning. Three studies were conducted, focusing on how higher education\nstudents use both portable and conventional devices to aid their learning practices. The aim of the\nstudies was to investigate the impact of utilizing portable technologies on students\u2019 learning prac-\ntices. The data was mainly collected through observation of students in both formal and informal\nsettings. Data was also gathered from log files collected from students\u2019 laptops, which showed\nthe activities students pursued using them. Log files were particularly helpful in providing infor-\nmation about students\u2019 utilization of portables in settings where students could not be observed,\nsuch as at home. The observations and log files helped in looking at the continuity of students\u2019\nlearning in formal and informal settings.\nThe collected data were interrogated for cases that represent mobile (Table 1) and static\n(Table 2) learning based on the idea of context crossing discussed earlier. Context can be the\nphysical features of the environment where learning takes place or the social setting of learning\nactivities. We considered both conceptions through Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansion of activity theory. A\nchange in the physical context was interpreted as a change in the location where learning activi-\nties took place, which also determined whether learning was mobile or static. A change in the\nsocial context was interpreted as a change in the rules and the division of labour that governed the\nstudents\u2019 community, which shares the same objective. Tables 1 and 2 provide some examples\nfrom our project data that use our two understandings of context to distinguish between mobile\nand static learning.\nTables 1 and 2 show that context crossing can be used as a basis for studying mobile learning\nand can differentiate it from static learning. Learning was considered to be mobile when a change\nFigure 2. Framework for analysing mobile learning (adapted from Sharples et al. 2005).\n50  E. Wali et al.\noccurred in the physical location. In these cases learning activities directed towards the same\nobjective were pursued in different physical locations over time. In addition, Tables 1 and 2 show\nthat static learning occurred when the objective of a learning activity was achieved while the\nlearner remained in the same location. Thus, using context as physical location helped with differ-\nentiating mobile and static learning. Tables 1 and 2 also show that in some cases of mobile and\nstatic learning changes occurred in the social context as a result of a change in the physical loca-\ntion or a change in the activity pursued. In these cases students\u2019 learning was more socially inter-\nesting than the cases where the social context was unchanged. Thus, using context as the social\nsetting of learning activities helped in showing what is interesting about mobile learning.\nTables 1 and 2 show that using context crossing as a basis for defining mobile learning gives\na different perspective on the term as it illustrates the relationship between context, both physical\nand social, and learning practices. The tables can represent both the technological layer as well\nas the semiotic layer proposed by Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula without the need for complex\noverlapping activity systems or the conversational framework. However, the question remains,\nwhich of these cases represents \u2018real\u2019 mobile learning? Is it the case where context was repre-\nsented as a change in both the physical and social contexts or any case where mobile learning was\nclassified as a result of a change in the physical context alone? We believe that what is interesting\nfor research is the cases where context crossing is represented as a change in both the physical\nand social contexts. This shows that there is more to mobile learning than pursuing learning activ-\nities across multiple physical locations.\nDiscussion\nThe current definitions of mobile learning are limited when used to analyse real world case studies.\nFor example, some of these definitions are based on the assumption that learning is mediated by\nportable technologies which are used in different physical locations (location crossing). However,\nwe have offered examples that show how learners not only use portable technologies (e.g. PDAs,\nlaptops) to aid their learning activities, as conventionally studied in research, but also use conven-\ntional devices such as handouts and textbooks. This challenges the general understanding that\ntraditional learning is static learning because learners use traditional devices to aid their learning,\nwhich usually takes place in the same classroom. Much traditional learning can be considered\nmobile because learners use conventional devices in the same manner as they use portable tech-\nnologies to pursue learning activities across different contexts, such as at home or in a library.\nTherefore, definitions of mobile learning should cover conventional devices as well as any other\ntechnology. It should also consider learning that is mediated by conceptual tools as learners engage\nin different activities that aid their learning and may\/may not use physical devices to aid that learn-\ning. For example, a student may use his laptop to view lecture slides in the classroom, review them\nat home and then practice what he has learnt in the laboratory in conducting an experiment. In\nthis case, although the student is not using any type of device to aid his learning in the laboratory,\nhe is undertaking an activity that aims at achieving the same objective, developing his understand-\ning of a topic, as the activities pursued in the classroom and at home using a laptop. Therefore,\nlearning in this case is considered mobile because the student pursued learning activities that are\ndirected towards the same objective in different contexts, even if the student did not use a portable\ndevice to aid learning. Moreover, the definition of mobile learning should consider learning that\ncontinues to take place in the same location but over time, as in traditional education where\nlectures usually take place in the same classroom over the academic year.

Wali et al.\nfeature of a mobile phone is used in a lecture theatre to help solve mathematical problems usage\nof the device is static, as the learning objective is achieved while the learner remains in the same\nlocation. In such a case the learner maintains the context, with no crossing.\nDefining mobile learning based on location crossing is not useful, as this puts too great an\nemphasis on the location where learning activities take place and ignores all other factors that\naffect these activities, such as the social setting. Therefore, we base our conception of mobile\nlearning on the idea of context crossing. However, defining mobile learning based on context\ncrossing has also not been helpful historically, as the definition of context itself is ambiguous.\nCole (1996) and Dourish (2004) defined context as (a) what is constructed through the interac-\ntions between learners and technology or (b) what surrounds the human user of the technology.\nThe conception of context in the first definition is misleading when used to define mobile learn-\ning because interactions between the learner and the technology can be constructed and changed\neven if the learner is physically static. This is also a problem for activity theory. From an activ-\nity theory perspective context changes as a result of a change in the social setting of the learner,\nrepresented as the community, rules and the division of labour in an activity system. This\nimplies that all learning where the social setting changes is defined as mobile learning, even if\nthe learner is physically static. For example, the community that the learner is part of changes\nwhen someone comes into the lecture room in which the learner is located, but, arguably, this is\nnot something we would want to classify as mobile learning. Thus, the first definition of context\nis insufficient to support our definition of mobile learning. In the second definition context is\nrepresented as the location where the learner is and how the properties and constraints of that\nlocation affect learning activities. Context crossing here implies location crossing, as context\nchanges for each location. Thus, the second definition of context is sufficient to define mobile\nlearning based on the idea of context crossing, however, it discards the social context of the\nlearning activities that help in studying what is interesting about mobile learning. For instance,\nif this conception is applied to Case 1, illustrated in Table 1, learning is defined as mobile\nbecause the learner pursued learning activities across locations. However, there will be no indi-\ncation of the changes in the social context that occur as a result of using the technology, which,\nif represented, show what makes using portable devices for learning fun and socially interesting.\nThus, what makes learning activities socially interesting is for the social context to develop in\nsome way.\nNeither concept of context crossing alone is a good basis for researching mobile learning. It\nis apparent that what actually interests us is the intersection of these definitions, where mobility\nhappens as a result of location crossing and at the same time changes in the social context make\nmobile learning socially interesting. Based on that, we view context as the combination of the\nphysical location, including the properties and the constraints of that setting, and the rules and the\ndivision of labour governing the learners\u2019 community. The activity system triangle in Figure 3\nTable 3. Illustration of context crossing as a basis for defining mobile and static learning.\nContext as social setting\nContext as physical \nenvironment Conventional Social setting changing\nLocation crossing Mobile learning\n(e.g. lecture being moved to seminar \nroom)\nSocially interesting mobile learning\n(e.g. dispersed discussions during fieldwork)\nStatic Static learning\n(e.g. lecture)\nSocially interesting static learning\n(e.g. innovative lecturing [new teaching])\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  55\nshows our representation of mobile learning based on the idea of context crossing, where location\nis represented in the activity system as the tool that enables mobile learning. Thus, mobility\noccurs when the subject and object are preserved but the location (conceived as a tool and includ-\ning any available devices) is changed. In this reformulation the social context, which is presented\nin the rules, community and division of labour of the activity system, may or may not change. The\nsituation becomes interesting socially when the bottom half of the activity theory triangle also\nchanges. In contrast, Sharples, Taylor, and Vavoula representation of context in the activity\nsystem of mobile learning occurs through the \u2018community\u2019 component alone, which it was argued\nrepresents both the physical environment and the community of actors (people and the interactive\ntechnology) who interact around shared objectives.\nSummarizing these discussions, Table 3 illustrates how mobile and static learning can be distin-\nguished from one another. It also distinguishes between socially interesting mobile and static learn-\ning. Table 3 is based on the conception that mobile learning can be defined in relation to the concept\nof context crossing, where context is the conjunction of the location in which the learning activity\ntakes place and the social setting, represented as the rules and the division of labour of the commu-\nnity that the learner belongs to. In Table 3 the intersection between context as change in location\nand context as change in social settings helps with identifying socially interesting mobile learning.\nHowever, it should be noted that as a consequence of activity theory\u2019s historical perspective we\nmust recognize that what makes mobile learning socially interesting may dwindle over time, in\nwhich case learning that was interesting may become less so. Learning will still be either mobile\nor not \u2013 the historical aspect only affects one of the two dimensions when analysing a case.\nBased on our conception of context crossing, illustrated in Table 3, mobile learning can be\ndefined as learning that occurs as a result of pursuing learning activities that are directed towards\nachieving the same objective across multiple contexts (both physical and social).\nConclusions\nThe current definitions of mobile learning are problematic as they are focused on learning that is\nmediated by certain mobile technologies.

Framework for analysing mobile learning.\n56  E. Wali et al.\ngives a new perspective on the term by shifting the focus from the technology used to the context\nof use. However, the current uses of context in defining mobile learning are ambiguous and\nunhelpful. This paper clarifies \u2018context\u2019 from an activity theory perspective as a combination of\nthe properties of the physical location where the learning activity takes place and the rules and\nthe division of labour within the community that the learner belongs to. This conceptualization\nhelps in proposing a definition of mobile learning that does not focus on the utilization of mobile\ntechnology but on the forms of learning practice, involving any technology, old or new, and how\nthese practices vary across contexts embodied in a combination of the physical and social settings\nof learning activities. This definition denotes that it is not the technology that makes learning\nmobile but the continuity of learning activities in different contexts (physical and social). The\ndefinition also helps in differentiating mobile learning from static learning, which was a weakness\nof previous definitions of the term.\nWe propose that future studies look at mobile learning in terms of learning activities taking\nplace across contexts (both physical and social), placing more emphasis on the relationship\nbetween learning activities and social context, which has been shown to affect and be affected by\nlearning practices. This also helps with studying what differentiates learning that is mediated by\nthe use of portable technologies from learning that is mediated by the use of other conventional\ndevices. For example, learning through portable technologies is not only affected by the social\ncontext of the learning activity, but also helps to create contexts that conventional devices cannot\ncreate and thus helps with creating new learning experiences. However, these experiences\nbecome routine over time. Future studies should also focus more on studying learning that\ncontinues to occur in the same location over time, such as in a classroom. These cases can clarify\nthe relationship between learning activities that occur in the same physical context and the social\ncontext.\nReferences\nBannon, L. 1997. Activity theory.
