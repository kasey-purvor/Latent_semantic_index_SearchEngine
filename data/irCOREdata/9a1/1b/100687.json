While much recent re-\nsearch has focussed on the search for exotic \u2018\u2018doubly magic\u2019\u2019\nnuclei @1,2# formed by assuming the standard shell model\ngaps at nucleon numbers 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126, their\neven-even \u2018\u2018doubly midshell\u2019\u2019 counterparts are arguably even\nmore rare. Above the sd shell, the corresponding doubly\nmidshell, even-even systems which are particle bound are\nlimited to 14\n28Si14 , 14\n38Si24 @3#, 24\n48Cr24 @4#, and 66\n170Dy104 . ~One\nmight also include near-midshell nuclei 62,64Cr38,40 @5#, 3876Sr,\n40\n80Zr @6#, 104Sr66 , and 106Zr66 @7,8# in such a discussion!.\nIt has long been recognized that the nature of nuclear\ncollectivity at low spins is linked to the number of valence\nprotons and neutrons. Casten and collaborators have demon-\nstrated that many of the low-lying collective nuclear proper-\nties, such as the excitation energy of the first 21 level (211),\nthe energy ratio 41\n1\/21\n1 @9\u201312# and the B(E2) of the first\nexcited state @13# have a smooth dependence on NpNn , the\nproduct of the number of valence proton and neutron par-\nticles or holes outside of the magic numbers. However, even\nin this simple scheme, in some cases, subshell closures must\nbe envoked, such as those at Z564 @10,14# and at Z576\n@11# for the simple NpNn relationship to remain applicable.\nAssuming the standard spherical shell gaps at Z550 and 82\nand N582 and 126, 170Dy has the largest number of valence\nparticles for any nucleus lighter than 208Pb, and as such,\nmight naively be expected to be amongst the most collective\nof all nuclei. However experimentally, one observes the well\nknown saturation of B(E2) values when approaching the\ndouble midshell in this region @15,16# which has been ex-\nplained in terms of the spatial overlap of specific proton and\nneutron Nilsson orbitals @15#.\nThe single-particle structure of nuclei in the deformed\nrare-earth region is also of longstanding interest. This is in\npart due to the preponderance of states with large single-\nparticle components of angular momentum along the axis of\nnuclear symmetry @17\u201320#. These so called \u2018\u2018high-K\u2019\u2019 states\nare hindered in their decay to the predominantly K50\nground-state band by the K-selection rule, which states that\nthe multipole of decay, l , must be at least as large as the0556-2813\/2002\/65~3!\/037302~4!\/$20.00 65 0373change in the K value between the two states @17,20#. Thus\ndecays between states of widely differing K values require\nhigh order multipoles, giving rise to long-lived high-K iso-\nmers. In practice, the constancy of the value of the\nK-quantum number is eroded both by fluctuations away from\nthe pure axially symmetric shape and by Coriolis mixing of\nother K values @21# which increases as a function of rota-\ntional frequency. Walker @22# demonstrated a dependence of\nthe K-isomer hindrance factors on NpNn , which implied a\ngreater degree of K hindrance as the valence product in-\ncreased, corresponding to more deformed, axially symmetric\nnuclei. The high degree of axial symmetry and large defor-\nmation expected for a doubly midshell nucleus means that\none might expect 170Dy to be an excellent candidate for hav-\ning a very long lived \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 K-isomeric state.\nRecent studies of the f p , doubly midshell nuclei 38Si and\n48Cr @3,4# have shown that these systems exhibit significant\nquadrupole collectivity. Due to the limited number of va-\nlence particles in these light systems, theoretical descriptions\nof their structure have been presented which are based on the\nconstrained-basis shell model ~see, e.g., Ref. @23#!. The yrast\ndecay schemes of the even-even neighbors of the N5Z\n539 doubly midshell nucleus 78Y, namely, 38\n76Sr and 40\n80Zr\nhave recently been extended into the medium-spin regime\n@6#. Although the energies of the 21\n1 states suggest large\ndeformations for these nuclei (b2;0.4), the E(411)\/E(211)\nratios of 2.84 and 2.86, respectively, suggest that these struc-\ntures are not pure prolate rotors, but have some degree of\naxial asymmetry @24#. This may be explained by the exis-\ntence of other deformation minima which are present in the\npotential-energy surfaces for these nuclei @25# and arise due\nto the presence of deformed shell gaps in the single-particle\npotentials at both prolate, spherical and oblate shapes for\nproton and neutron numbers in this region. It may also reflect\nthe rather small number of valence particles ~compared\nto 170Dy).\nDue to the much larger valence space associated with\n170Dy, constrained-basis shell-model methods are not viable.\nConsequently, prior theoretical work on the excited states of\nthis nucleus has been limited mostly to Monte Carlo shell\u00a92002 The American Physical Society02-1\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 037302model @26#, the generator co-ordinate method @27,28#, the\nStrutinsky shell correction @16,29#, and relativistic-mean-\nfield @30# calculations. Nevertheless, the behavior as a func-\ntion of angular momentum has not yet been adequately ex-\nplored. The current paper addresses this issue.\nThe neutron-rich nature of 170Dy has meant that until\nnow, it has been experimentally inaccessible for spectro-\nscopic study. The heaviest b-stable dysprosium isotope is\n164Dy98 , while the lightest stable N5104 isotone is 70\n174Yb.\nRecently, however, some progress has been made on the pro-\nduction of neutron-rich nuclei in this region. These include\n170Dy being synthesized and tentatively identified following\nthe projectile fragmentation of a 208Pb beam at 1 GeV per\nnucleon @31#. This result, coupled with advances in the in-\nstrumentation associated with experiments using multi-\nnucleon transfer reactions @32# with stable ions when\ncoupled with high-efficiency g-ray spectrometers @33#, opens\nup the intriguing possibility of studying the structure of this\nunique nucleus up to medium spins in the near future. To\ndate, the N5102 isotone 66\n168Dy is the most neutron-rich dys-\nprosium isotope where the 21\n1 state has been identified @34#.\nThis was populated following the b decay of 65\n168Tb, which\nwas in turn produced as a product of proton induced fission\nof 238U. A similar isotope separation on-line ~ISOL! tech-\nnique could be used to identify states in 170Dy. Experimental\naccess to the energy of even the first excited state in the\ndoubly midshell system will provide a useful guide to the\nquadrupole deformation @21,35#, and if the yrast 41 excited\nstate can also be identified, information on the de-\ngree of triaxial deformation, or lack thereof, can also be\ninferred @36,37#.\nMotivated by the recent experimental advances in produc-\ntion and identification of heavy neutron-rich rare-earth nu-\nclei, we present calculations predicting the evolution of the\nyrast and low-lying single particle-structure of 170Dy. In the\ncurrent work, the nonaxial deformed Woods-Saxon ~WS! po-\ntential @25# was employed. Collective rotation was investi-\ngated in the framework of the cranked shell model ~CSM! by\nmeans of total-Routhian-surface ~TRS! calculations @38# in\nthe three-dimensional deformation b2 ,b4 ,g space. Both\nmonopole and quadrupole pairings are included. The mono-\npole pairing strength G is determined by the average gap\nmethod @39# and quadrupole strengths are obtained by restor-\ning the Galilean invariance broken by the seniority pairing\nforce @40#. To avoid the spurious phase transition encoun-\ntered in the BCS approach, we used approximate particle-\nnumber projection, described by Lipkin-Nogami pairing\n@41#. Pairing correlations are dependent on the rotational fre-\nquency (v) and deformation. In order to include such depen-\ndence in the TRS, we have performed pairing-deformation-\nfrequency self-consistent TRS calculations, i.e., for any\ngiven deformation and frequency, pairings are self-\nconsistently calculated by the HFB-like method @41#. At a\ngiven frequency, the deformation of a state is determined by\nminimizing the calculated TRS.\nFigure 1 shows the results of TRS calculations for the\nyrast sequence of 170Dy. Note the presence of a very deep,\naxially symmetric, prolate minimum corresponding to b20373050.288. The ground state (v50) deformation compares\nwith calculated values of b250.292, 0.281, 0.288, and 0.287\nfor the neighboring isotopes and isotones 168Dy102 ,\n172Dy106 , 64\n168Gd, and 68\n172Er, respectively. This is consistent\nwith the results of relativistic mean-field calculations for this\nregion @30# which predicted a saturation of quadrupole de-\nformation around neutron number 102. As Fig. 1 shows, the\ndeformation parameters predicted for this minimum in 170Dy\nare found to be remarkably constant as a function of rota-\ntional frequency ~which is related to the projection of the\naverage spin on the axis of rotation Ix).\nFigure 2 shows the calculated kinematic moment of iner-\ntia for the yrast sequence of 170Dy as a function of rotational\nfrequency. The figure highlights the almost simultaneous\nalignments of both protons and neutrons, with the predicted\ngradual alignment starting at \\v\u20190.35, corresponding to I\n\u201914\\ . This simultaneous alignment arises from the breaking\nof a pair of i13\/2 neutrons and a pair of h11\/2 protons. The\nnature of the simultaneous alignments in the two fluids can\nbe easily qualitatively understood since the neutrons and pro-\ntons have the same status, namely in the middle of high-j\nshells, and hence experience similar Coriolis forces.\nIn the present work, we also investigate noncollective ex-\ncitations, i.e., multiquasiparticle ~multi-qp) states. For the\nFIG. 1. TRS calculations for the yrast sequence in 170Dy as\ncalculated in the present work for rotational frequencies of v5 ~a!\n0.0, ~b! 0.1, ~c! 0.2, and ~d! 0.3 MeV\/\\ .

In this method, the orbitals involved in a given con-\nfiguration are identified and diabatically blocked by calculat-\ning the average Nilsson numbers of the orbitals. The shape\nand excitation energy of a multi-qp state can be obtained\nfrom the configuration-constrained PES. It is well known\nthat a large axial deformation and high K value provide good\nconditions for the formation of isomeric states @17#. Our cal-\nculations suggest the presence of a Kp561 two\nquasineutron state at a low excitation energy of approxi-\nmately 1.2 MeV. This state is based on the n( 52 2@512#\n^\n7\n2\n2@514#) configuration. Note, that similar Kp561 in-\nstrinsic states have been experimentally observed in the\nheavier N5104 isotones 174Yb, 176Hf, and 178W @43#.\nFigure 3 shows the configuration-constrained potential en-\nergy surface calculation @42# for the Kp561 state in 170Dy.\nThe deformation predicted for this state is essentially identi-\ncal with that predicted for the low-lying members of the\nground-state band. The large deformation and high degree of\naxial symmetry predicted for both the two-quasineutron state\nand ground state band, suggest that this may represent an\nextremely good example of a K-isomeric state, with little\nmixing of either the initial or final K value due to either\nCoriolis mixing or softness in the triaxial plane.
