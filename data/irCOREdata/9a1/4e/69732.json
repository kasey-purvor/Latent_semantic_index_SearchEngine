Introduction\nThree dimensional (3D) computer graphics have been\nplaying a vital role in the implementations of various\ncommercial, health, critical and entertainment\napplications since it was first introduced in 1984.\nApplications ranging from modeling, virtual reality,\ncomputer-aided design, scientific analysis and\nvisualization, computer gaming, and complex image\nprocessing [1] are all examples of such systems that use\n3D capabilities.\nThere is no doubt that 3D-based content are more\nperceivable and attractive to viewers. Since 2003,\nseveral industry leaders have been developing solutions\nto bring 3D presence into the mobile platforms,\nspecifically mobile phones and Personal Digital\nAssistants (PDA). Many potential applications for 3D\ncomputer graphics on mobile devices are possible. 3D\ncomputer games are the most dominant ones. According\nto eMarketer research, the mobile gaming market is\nexpected to reach $1.5 billion in 2008 up from $600\nmillion in 2005 [2]. With the advances in mobile 3D\ntechnologies, we will see more 3D-based titles with\nbetter graphics quality as in the newer version of Doom\nin Figure 1.\nBy introducing 3D effects to mobile games people\nwill likely be more enthusiastic to play games on their\nmobile phones allowing 3D games to take a big share of\nthe mobile gaming market which will open new doors of\nrevenues for marketers and developers alike.\nFigure 1: Old and new versions Mobile Doom\nBesides games, 3D graphics can be applied in\nbusiness applications like the ones for advertising\npurposes. 3D M-Ad is an opt-in, innovative 3D mobile\nadvertising tool that sends customers 3D ads\naccompanied with information about products they\nrequest, or pull, from public display screens to their\nmobile phones, Figure 2. Users will be able to retrieve\nthese products while being mobile, away from the shop,\nand can make purchases wirelessly. As specialists expect\nthat the mobile commerce revenues will reach $1 trillion\nby the end of this decade, marketers have huge\nopportunity to construct a new advertising channel\nthrough the mobile medium [3].\nI I Eel3-Rd IIIII_\nTeddy BQea\nNikom Camera\nMventions\nMoka Phone\nMike Shoes\nOptions Exit\nProducts list Roman vase in Roman vase\ninitial view rotated\nFigure 2.

There, users can\nlearn from, meet, chat or even date virtually other\npeople, anywhere in the glob, as long as they are present\nin the 3D virtual world(s) on the mobile phones.\nBecause the mobile medium is limited to diminutive\nprocessing power, small screen sizes, primitive battery\npower and parameterized memory [4], pushing the\nboundaries of 3D graphics on mobile platforms was not\nan easy task. However, in this paper, we will show how\nthe industry giants managed to advance the quality of 3D\n0-7803-9521-2\/06\/$20.00 (2006 IEEE.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\ngraphics delivered to mobile handsets in a couple of\nyears to a level took PCs decades to reach.\nWe will start by listing the major limitations that put-\nback 3D graphics on mobile phones in section 2. Then,\nsections 3 and 4 will highlight the advances that have\nbeen taken in software and hardware technologies\nrespectively in order to bring new dimensions for the\nfield of mobile 3D graphics and overcome these\nlimitations. Tests for 3D performance on different\ngenerations of mobile phones, specifically Nokia\nSeries6O smartphones, will be conducted in section 5\nshowing the hardware specifications implemented in\neach phone and their 3D graphics presentation and\nrendering capabilities. We will use third-party\nbenchmark applications to perform the tests and we will\nanalyze in section 6 the results obtained to prove the\nincrease in performance. Then we will use in section 7\nour applied analysis to predict and conclude in section 8\nhow the future generation of mobile software and\nhardware will acquaint to better 3D performance.\n2. Main limitations for 3D graphics on\nmobile phones\nWhen moving from PC platforms to palm-size, or\neven smaller, devices like mobile phones, familiar 3D\ngraphics techniques become generally unimplementable.\nDeveloping 3D graphics for the mobile environment is\nhighly affected by various limitations. The following\nsubsections denote the major constraints. The sections\nafter will show the leap advances that took place to\novercome these limitations.\n2.1. CPU\/GPU:\nMost mobile phones at the mean time run at\nrelatively slow clock speed between 1OOMHz and\n500MHz. They also lack Graphics Processing Units\n(GPU) meaning that a speed up in code must be obtained\nthrough software means. Add to this that CPUs in\nmobile phones have small caches [4]. Some specialists\nexpect that mobile processors with 1GHz speed are\nlikely to appear in the next three years [4]. However, for\nthese processors to exist they will have to overcome the\nnon-trivial problems of battery life and heat generation.\n2.2. Low buss bandwidth\nData sent from the CPU to the graphics routines\ncould easily become bottlenecked because of the low\nbus bandwidth available on mobile phones. This\nbandwidth will affect the vertex per polygon count and\nframes per second rates in applications. Graphics and\nmobile venders are trying to optimize this as much as\npossible, but developers have to be aware of this\nlimitation while programming their applications by not\noverloading the data path [4].\n2.3. Lack of floating-point arithmetic\nAll processors currently available on mobile phones\ndon't support floating-point arithmetic because of their\nexcessive power consumption. If floating-point data\ntypes are used on mobile applications they will perform\nextremely slowly since they are implemented in software\nemulation routines. Floating point processors have yet to\nmake their way into standard mobile platforms although\nas we will see in Section 3.1 many manufactures have\nprocessors in development with floating point\ncapabilities.\n2.4. Resolution\nDisplays on mobile phones have limited and different\nresolutions and color depths. The largest display size\navailable now is 240X320 pixels (02 Xda series), and\nthe maximum color depth is 18-bit (256K colors.) These\ndifferentiations affect massively the quality and type of\ngraphics that can be implemented on mobile phones\nsince developers have to always be aware of the various\nresolutions and color ranges available on the different\nphone models. This practice is hard when tackling for\ninstance 3D games since it is more complex to export 3D\ngame objects to different screen sizes than a\ncorresponding 2D object.\n2.5. 3D graphics APIs\nUntil recently, interfaces that enable 3D graphics on\nmobile phones were limited to personal implementations\nof different APIs. No standards were available and no\ncommon engines were used. Skilled programmers were\nrequired to write their own 3D graphics APIs. \"Nude\nEngine\" by Robert Rose and \"Nova3D\" by the 7777-\nteam are just two examples of such APIs.\n3. Software advances\nDifferent mobile manufacturers develop different\nplatforms for their devices. This results in various\noperating systems, hardware and standards. The most\ndominant mobile operating systems are: Symbian OS\n(worldwide) [3], Windows Mobile (Pocket PC), Binary\nRuntime Environment for Wireless (BREW) in the US,\nMobile Linux and SavaJe (newly-born Java-based\noperating system). Considering that operating systems\nhave support and capabilities that are distinguishable\nfrom each other, almost all manufacturers have currently\nimplemented software support in their devices for 3D\ngraphics. There are two Application Programming\nInterfaces (APIs) available: OpenGL for Embedded\nSystems (ES) which is being supported by the Khronos\nGroup and M3G (Mobile 3D Graphics) which is mainly\npushed forward by Sony Ericsson.\n3.1. OpenGL ES API\n0-7803-9521-2\/06\/$20.00 \u00a72006 IEEE. 120\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on January 7, 2009 at 05:06 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nOpenGL ES is a lightweight well-defined subset of\ndesktop OpenGL which is optimized by removing some\nclasses and APIs that are expensive for the mobile\nplatform, and introducing smaller data types and support\nfor fixed-point arithmetic [4]. There are 3 versions of\nOpenGL ES available currently. The first is vi.0 which\nwas introduced in July 2003 by the Khronos Group and\nwhich emphasizes software rendering and basic\nhardware acceleration for mobile 3D graphics. The\nKhronos Group is the premier global association that\nstrives to stimulate the growth of OpenGL ES and other\ngraphics technologies for mobile devices such as\nOpenVG for vector graphics and OpenML for Dynamic\nMedia Authoring [5].\nIn mid 2004, Khronos released its newer version of\nthe API, OpenGL ES vi. 1, which emphasizes hardware\nacceleration. Later in 2005 Khronos introduced the latest\nversion, OpenGL ES version 2.0, which provides the\nability to create shaders and write to vertex using\nOpenGL ES Shader Language, OpenSL ES [5].\nOpenGL ES vi.0 is currently the only version\nsupported by manufacturers. Early 2004, Nokia was the\nfirst to release a mobile phone implementing OpenGL\nES, Nokia 6630. Now, all Symbian- (v8.0 and above)\nand BREW- (vi.1 and above) based phones implement\nthis API in addition to some Mobile Linux phones.\nAlthough there is an OpenGL ES implementation for\nWindows CE-based Pocket PCs and Smartphones,\nMicrosoft has stripped off its DirectX 3D API to suit\ndevices running its newest mobile operating system:\nMobile Windows 5.0. The API is called MDX, DirectX\nMobile.\n3.2. M3G API\nM3G is the first Java-specific standard for 3D\ngraphics on mobile phones. The API is an optional\npackage to be used with profiles like the Mobile\nInformation Device Profile (MIDP). It is based on\nOpenGL ES in low-level and crafted for the Java 2\nMicro Edition (J2ME)' development platform as shown\nin figure 3. This implies that any device embedding\nJ2ME interpreter, given that its profile is aligned with\nOpenGL ES, will be able to present and render 3D\ngraphics [6].\nAlthough M3G is based on OpenGL ES, the API\ndoes not implement fixed-point arithmetic. It uses\nfloating-point instead which causes loss in programming\nefficiency and resources consumption [6].\nThe first device to support M3G in software was\nNokia 6630 and the first to accelerate it in hardware is\nW900 Walkman\u00ae phone by Sony Ericson released\nOctober 2005 [7, 12].\n' J2ME is not an operating system but an open-source second-layer\ndevelopment platform based on Java and interpreted by Java Virtual\nMachine (JVM) that is embedded on most mobile phones hardware.\nApplications created with J2ME are portable to the majority of phones\navailable.\nJava AppsNative Apps\nI MIDP\nJava Virtual Machine\nGraphics symbin brew\nHardware Device Hardware\nFigure 3. Software\/hardware stack for mobile phones\n4. Hardware advances\nUnlike APIs and operating systems, hardware\narchitecture for mobile phones is almost similar. The\nmajority of mobile Central Processing Units (CPU), and\nhence processor Instructions Set, are based on the ARM\ntechnology. All Symbian OS, Microsoft Windows\nMobile, Mobile Linux and SavaJe support the ARM\narchitecture [8].\nThere is currently a plethora of companies\nintroducing optimized CPUs for the mobile platforms. In\nthe next subsection we shall mention only those\nprocessors that are dedicated for graphics acceleration in\ngeneral and 3D graphics in particular.\n4.1. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)\nWith the explosion in the demand for high-quality\ngraphics presentation on cell phones, and the continuous\nappeal for sophisticated multimedia services, graphics\nhardware technology providers have leveraged their\nextensive experience and knowledge to indulge new\nsolutions to meet users' and companies' requirements.\nPowerVR MBX graphics processor by Imagination\nTechnologies, a leader in system-on-chip intellectual\nproperty (SoC IP), is developed to meet the growing\nneeds of multimedia applications on power-consuous\nmobile devices like smartphones. It implements OpenGL\nES 1.0\/1.1. PowerVR MBX introduces benefits of low\nmemory bandwidth, high image quality, low power\ndemands, fill rate of 300 million pixels\/sec, throughput\nof 3.7 million triangles\/sec [9] and refresh rate up to 37\nframes\/sec [10].\nNVIDIA\u00ae GoForceg 3D 4800 handheld graphics\nprocessing units on the other hand deliver dazzling 3D\ngraphics, multi-megapixel digital still images, video\ncapture and playback, and extended battery life to\nadvanced handheld devices. The processor is capable of\nrendering 250 million pixels per second and 5 million\ntriangles per second while a frame rate of 30 frames\/sec\n[11]. The Sonny Ericsson W900 Walkman\u00ae phone\nmentioned earlier is the first phone to ship with NVIDIA\nGoForceg 3D 4800 on board.\nOther industry leaders like Bitboys, ATI and\nQualcomm are emphasizing on developing solutions to\naccelerate 3D graphics on mobile handsets in hardware\nrather than purely in software.\n5. 3D Performance testing\n0-7803-9521-2\/06\/$20.00 \u00a72006 IEEE. 131\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on January 7, 2009 at 05:06 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nConsidering the variety of mobile phones released in\nthe market and the differences in their capabilities, some\nphones support 3D graphics in software, little in\nhardware and others do not support it at all. Since\nhardware acceleration is not commercially common yet,\nwe shall limit our discussion in this paper to those\nmobile phones that have 3D graphics support in software\nvia OpenGL ES 1.0 API. OpenGL ES 1.1 is\nimplemented only on prototypes of handsets and not\nwidely available. So it will not be considered. The tests\nwill be applied on Nokia Symbian-based Series60\nSmartphones: 3650, N-Gage, 6600, N-Gage QD, 6630\nand 6680.\nWe will test the 3D performance of these phones\nusing Futuremark SPMarO4 benchmark software. The\nbenchmark is a comprehensive OpenGL ES 3D test suite\nthat measures graphics capabilities. It includes 2D and\n3D tests [13]. The 3D part is an advanced gaming scene\nthat contains models rendering, camera movement,\ncollision detection, texturing and blending. It lasts for\n110 seconds. The 2D section features 2D content bliting\nand image manipulation, and lasts 30 seconds [4].\nThe results of the benchmark will demonstrate details\nof each phone's frame\/second rate, texel2\/second dotting\n(in millions) and triangle\/second rendering features (in\nthousands). Despite the fact that tested phones belong to\ndifferent versions of Symbian OS, which accordingly\nimplies that only those of version 8.0 will allow the tests\nsince they come shipped with the OpenGL ES API,\nSPMarkO4 provides within its package an OpenGL ES\nimplemntation for all devices under test except 6680. A\nDLL file containing OpenGL ES libraries is installed\nlocally when the application is installed. Hence, the tests\nwill run on all phones but will vary in performance\naccording to the hardware integrating with it.\nIn addition to performance, we will conduct battery-\ndurability tests that would conclude how long the battery\nwould last on each phone while rendering animated 3D\nscenes. This test is performed by continuously running\nGUnit demo which is a 3D noneinteractive animated\ngame featuring real-time rendering, transformation,\ntexturing, lightening, collision detection and simple\nmodels animation. It is developed by Hybrid Graphics\n[14]. The demo includes Hybrid's implementation of\nOpenGL ES 1.0 which means that GUint will run on any\nof the phones in the same way as SPMarkO4 does.\nTable 1 below shows the result of the tests applied\nlisting the major information about each device's\nhardware and software support. Versions of Symbian OS\nand the processing power each phone embeds are\nentitled in addition to details of the graphics\nperformance which will be analyzed in the next section.\nM Texel\/sec 1.73 1.73 1.62 1.8 3.26 n\/a\n6. Analyzing performance results\nIt is obvious from the results above that the devices\nnot supporting OpenGL ES perform poorly when\ncompared to those that do. The performance of Nokia\n6630 is approximately as twice as the others'. Although\nthere is no implementation available of SPMarkO4 for\nNokia 6680, it is expected to perform similarly to 6630\nwith more improvement due to the better resolution\nfeature it incorporates. Note here that the CPU speed\nplays a great role in improving performance as well.\nOpenGL ES claims to reduce the power consumed to\nrender 3D graphics on mobile phones and this has been\ntested by continuously running GUnit. From Table 1, the\ntime Nokia 6600 spent running GUnit, until its battery\ndied is almost 6 hours. Nokia 6680, on the other hand,\ncould run GUnit for 7 hours and 2 minutes, with an\nincrease of almost an hour. This increase is a result of\nthe software support of OpenGL ES by the phone. When\nthe API gets supported by hardware, the increase is\nexpected to be much higher.\nAs shown in Table 1, each phone has different\ndisplay color range support. Through subjective analysis\nNokia 6680 proved to have the clearest output on screen.\nOn the N-Gage and 3650 the image was dimmed and\npale.\nThe availability of wide color ranges help processors\nreduce computation efforts to estimate the colors to paint\nthe screen pixels with if not available in the devices'\ncolor table. This means faster performance and longer\nbattery life, as we could see in 6680's test results.\nWe would note that the battery life was much greater\nthan expected and as the demo did not include any user\ninteraction or game play, it is likely to be considerably\nreduced when playing 'real' games.\nTable 1. Test results of Nokia smartphones\n7. Future expectations\n2 Texel is the coordinate point on a 3D model where texture maps are\nusually attached to. But here texel means the base unit composing a 3D\nmodel. In 2D world pixel is used instead.\nCurrently many software and hardware companies\nare investing in researching for new technologies to\nimprove the 3D experience on the mobile platforms.\nThis interest is expected to expand and increase as the\n0-7803-9521-2\/06\/$20.00 \u00a72006 IEEE. 142\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

However, to meet this\ndemand several boundaries have to be crossed though\nout the pathway.\nThe chief complaint among consumers remains the\nperceived short running time of mobile phones. With the\nexcessive calculation of 3D graphics, this time will\nbecome even shorter. The efforts to reduce energy\nconsumption by battery-powered devices have touched a\nrelative success on almost all portable electronic devices,\nincluding mobile phones, with an increase in efficiency\nof 10-20% every year. To continue this improvement,\nmobile device makers may have to combine batteries\nwith other technologies such as superconductors and\nfuel cells [ 16]. This gives a promising insight of the\nfuture technologies for batteries on mobile phones.\nIn addition to optimizing power consumption,\nprocessing units with faster clock cycles will appear in a\nshort tern. The fastest CPU available now on mobile\nphone is Intel PXA272 with a clock cycle of 520MHz\n[17]. It is shipped in 02 Xda IIi, which is a dual purpose\nmobile phone and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA),\nwithout using any cooling mechanism. When compared\nto its predecessor Xda, we notice an increase of half an\nhour in the talk-time and 20 hours in the stand-by time\nalthough the latter has a slower processor, 206MHz [17].\nThis leap proves that it is possible to reach faster clock\ncycles for processors on mobile phones while decreasing\ntheir power consumption.\nMobile phones dedicated for gaming purposes, such\nas the Nokia N-gage series, are expected to incorporate\nin their hardware architecture Graphics Processing Units\n(GPU) like the ones introduced in section 4.1 to manage\nthe excessive calculation of 3D games. Currently only\nSony Ericsson W900 provides hardware acceleration for\n3D graphics. However, this does not mean that there are\ntwo processors in the unit, CPU and GPU. Only one\nprocessor is available and it is responsible of both\nfunctionalities controlling and graphics. Once GPUs are\nembedded alongside CPUs more clock cycle resources\nwill be freed resulting better performance and user\nexperience.\nSoftware wise, OpenGL ES is expected to be the\nstandard API for 3D graphics on almost all mobile\nphones. All mobile processor manufacturers will provide\nhardware support for the standard. \"The consolidating\nforce in PC games was OpenGL, and history will repeat\nitself with the introduction of OpenGL ES for handheld\ndevices,\" said John Peddie, president of John Peddie\nResearch [19].\n8. Conclusion\nMobile 3D graphics applications will be ones of the\nmost commercially successful applications on mobile\nplatforns. With the relentless progress pace of both\nhardware and software on mobile phones, applications\nthat used to be restricted to text and primitive\nmonochrome-based graphics will move to a newer stage\nof equipping fully 3D featured contents by doubling, if\nnot more, their perfornance. By having coherence\nbetween the software and hardware worlds in the mobile\ndevices, the mobile 3D graphics industry will grow\nrapidly as we progress.\nThe future trends for mobile devices not only will\nimprove performance of 3D graphics on mobile phones,\nbut also will open new doors for other innovative\napplications.\n9.
