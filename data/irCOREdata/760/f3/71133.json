Black auroras are recognized as spatially well-\ndefined regions within uniform diffuse aurora where the op-\ntical emission is significantly reduced. Although a well stud-\nied phenomenon, there is no generally accepted theory for\nblack auroras. One theory suggests that black regions are\nformed when energetic magnetospheric electrons no longer\nhave access to the loss cone. If this blocking mechanism\ndrifts with the source electron population in the magneto-\nsphere, black auroras in the ionosphere should drift eastward\nwith a velocity that increases with the energy of the precipi-\ntating electrons in the surrounding aurora, since the gradient-\nB curvature drift is energy dependent. It is the purpose of this\npaper to test this hypothesis. To do so we have used simul-\ntaneous measurements by the European Incoherent Scatter\n(EISCAT) radar and an auroral TV camera at Troms\u00f8, Nor-\nway. We have analyzed 8 periods in which a black aurora\noccurred frequently to determine their relative drift with re-\nspect to the ionospheric plasma. The black aurora was found\nto drift eastward with a velocity of 1.5\u20134 km\/s, which is in ac-\ncordance with earlier observations. However, one case was\nfound where a black patch was moving westward, this being\nthe first report of such behaviour in the literature. In general,\nthe drift was parallel to the ionospheric flow but at a much\nhigher velocity. This suggests that the generating mechanism\nis not of ionospheric origin. The characteristic energy of the\nprecipitating electron population was estimated through in-\nversion of E-region plasma density profiles. We show that\nthe drift speed of the black patches increased with the en-\nergy of the precipitating electrons in a way consistent with\nthe gradient-B curvature drift, suggesting a magnetospheric\nmechanism for the black aurora. As expected, a compari-\nson of the drift speeds with a rudimentary dipole field model\nof the gradient-B curvature drift speed only yields order-of-\nmagnitude agreement, which most likely is due to the night-\nside disturbed magnetosphere being significantly stretched.\nCorrespondence to: E.

Two distinctly different types of black auroras have\nbeen identified. The most commonly observed are black\npatches, which exhibit a variety of forms and, mapped to\nan altitude of 105 km, they are typically around 5\u00d71 km in\nextent (Trondsen and Cogger, 1997; Kimball and Hallinan,\n1998a). The second type are black vortex streets, which have\na clockwise rotation (opposite to that of auroral curls), and\ncommonly have a wavelength of about 1\u20133 km (Trondsen\nand Cogger, 1997; Kimball and Hallinan, 1998b). Both types\nare most common in the midnight sector in the late substorm\nrecovery phase. The visual appearance of the two types is\ndramatically different, basically because black patches show\nno signs of shear. While black patches move predominantly\nin the eastward direction with a speed of 1 to 4 km\/s (all\nthe black patches of Parsons and Thomas (1973); Schoute-\nVanneck et al. (1990) and Trondsen and Cogger (1997) were\ndrifting eastward), black vortex streets exhibit a large spread\nin both drift direction and speed. Black patches have also\nbeen found to have much longer lifetimes than the vortex\nstructures. Black arcs, typically around 0.5 km thick (Trond-\nsen and Cogger, 1997), are an intermediate state which can\nbe difficult to classify. This is foremost because both black\npatches and vortex streets often are formed from black arcs,\nbut also because the drift direction of an east-west aligned\narc with smooth boundaries is difficult to estimate. In this\npaper we focus on the drift of black patches.\n1612 E. M. Blixt et al.: Relative drift between black aurora and the ionospheric plasma\nThe generation mechanism of black auroras is uncertain.\nTwo major mechanisms have been proposed over the years:\n1. An active ionospheric mechanism where a downward\nfield-aligned current associated with a positive space\ncharge is pulling cold electrons out of the E-region\n(Royrvik, 1976; Marklund et al., 1997; Trondsen and\nCogger, 1997). This mechanism has predominately\nbeen associated with black vortex streets.\n2. A magnetospheric mechanism that locally hinders the\nstrong pitch angle diffusion\/scattering into the loss\ncone, and thus stops electrons from precipitating (Kim-\nball and Hallinan, 1998a; Peticolas et al., 2002; Blixt\nand Kosch, 2004).\nWe refer to the latter as a blocking mechanism, although\nit can be argued that it is not an active blocking mecha-\nnism, but merely a region where the strong pitch angle dif-\nfusion\/scattering is not enabled. However, the fact that pitch\nangle diffusion is enabled in the large area covered by the dif-\nfuse aurora, and that black regions within the diffuse aurora\nare very small and coherent structures, justifies our choice of\nterminology.\nThe relative drift between the black aurora and the iono-\nspheric plasma can provide us with important information\nregarding the source mechanism. The generally most ac-\ncepted theory of black vortex streets associates them with a\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability due to shear in theE\u00d7B veloc-\nity induced by an excess positive charge. As such, the vor-\ntices must move with the plasma flow (Keskinen and Gan-\nguli, 1996; Marklund et al., 1997; Kimball and Hallinan,\n1998b). It is expected that auroral features associated with\nfield-aligned currents move more or less with the E\u00d7B flow\nin the E-region, although a relative drift of the aurora with re-\nspect to the background plasma of around 100 m\/s has been\nobserved (Haerendel et al., 1993). This relative drift velocity\nis found to increase during the expansion phase of a substorm\nand for bright aurora (del Pozo et al., 2002b). The relative\ndrift is thought to arise from parallel electric fields which\ndecouple the ionosphere from the magnetosphere and the ac-\nceleration region, a mechanism referred to as braking field\nlines by Haerendel et al. (1993). So in the case of black au-\nrora, where the parallel electric field is expected to be small,\nor directed downwards, the relative drift should be expected\nto be small.\nOn the other hand, it has been suggested that black auro-\nras are due to structures in the hot electron population which\ngradient-B curvature drift around the Earth (Kimball and\nHallinan, 1998a). If these structures drift along with the ener-\ngetic plasma, the black patches should follow the drift of the\nhot magnetospheric electron population. This drift velocity\nis energy dependent, so we are interested in the relationship\nbetween the energy of the precipitating electrons, which sur-\nround the black patches, and the ionospheric drift velocity of\nthe black aurora. By combining radar and optical data of the\nblack aurora, it becomes possible to study this relationship.\nWe begin in Sect. 2 by describing the instrumentation used\nin the study. Then in Sect. 3 we discuss the observations and\nthe drift speeds we have observed in the black aurora. In\nSect. 4 we explain how the characteristic energy of the auro-\nral particles have been obtained, and we establish a positive\ncorrelation between the characteristic energy of the auroral\nparticles and the black auroral drift speed in Sect. 5. The\nmain results and conclusions are summarized in Sect. 6.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter facility) mainland\nUHF radar consists of three antennae; the transmitter, located\nin Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.58\u25e6 N, 19.22\u25e6 E), and two receiv-\ning antennae, one in Kiruna, Sweden (67.86\u25e6 N, 20.44\u25e6 E)\nand one in Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland (67.36\u25e6 N, 26.63\u25e6 E). In the\ntristatic mode, each antenna measures the line-of-sight ve-\nlocity of the ion population in a given common volume. For\na common volume in the F-region (\u223c300 km), where the\ncollisional drift is negligible compared to the E\u00d7B drift, a\ngood estimate of the horizontal local E\u00d7B plasma drift is\nobtained. Post-integration of the radar data (a basic integra-\ntion of 5\u201310 s is typical) is needed to reduce the noise in the\nmeasurements. The radar data from the March 2002 events\nwere post-integrated for 30 s, while 20-s integration was used\nfor the radar data from March 2003. However, to obtain the\ntristatic velocity estimates from the radar data, it was nec-\nessary to perform additional post-integration, to a total of\n300 s, to obtain enough signal-to-noise ratio. The March\n2002 experiment was \u201ctau3\u201d. This has an initial time resolu-\ntion of 5 s and an unambiguous height resolution of 5.4 km.\nThe March 2003 experiments were \u201carc1\u201d, which have a sub-\nsecond time resolution and a range resolution of about 1 km.\nThe first range gate was around 92 km for both experiments.\nTo optically identify and track the black patches, the digi-\ntal auroral imager, Odin, from the University of Troms\u00f8 was\nused. The imager consists of a GEN III, extended blue, im-\nage intensified (XYBION ISS-750) camera. A F0.95 lens\nwith 14.35\u00d710.92\u25e6 field of view (yields a 26.4\u00d721.1 km\nview at 105 km altitude), observing in white light, was used\nin all observations. The video stream is digitized in real time,\nand converted to (PAL) DV, and a GPS controlled time stamp\nsynchronizes the imager to the radar. The imager was lo-\ncated close to the Troms\u00f8 antenna (<500 m), and pointed up\nalong the magnetic field line direction, parallel to the radar\nbeam. To derive the velocity of the black patches, we have\nidentified the center of form of the structures, which is anal-\nogous to the center of mass of the black structures if the\nblack pixels had been given a mass. These center of forms\nhave been tracked as they traverse the field of view. The\nblack patches can be tracked for approximately 10\u201315 s be-\nfore they change their shape too much or disappear out of\nview. Longer measurement times yield better velocity es-\ntimates.

The error in the veloc-\nity estimate varies linearly with the error in the altitude esti-\nmate, which is less than 10%, as estimated from the peak of\nthe electron density profile. The velocity estimate of the per-\nturbations traveling along the border of the black aurora (the\nripple drift) is less certain. However, we are not seeking any\nquantitative measure of the ripple drift in this paper, instead\nwe are merely interested in it as a qualitative indicator of the\nbehavior of the black aurora, as there is reason to believe that\nsheared black auroras are different to simple black patches\nand arcs (see discussion in Blixt and Kosch (2004), Kimball\nand Hallinan (1998a) and Kimball and Hallinan (1998b)).\nThe Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS imaging riometer (69.05\u25e6 N,\n20.79\u25e6 E) operates at 38.2 MHz, and monitors the relative\ncosmic noise absorption in 49 different beam directions.\nThe absorption maximizes at around 90 km altitude and\nbelow, which corresponds to precipitating electrons with\ncharacteristic energy of a few tens of keV to a few hundred\nkeV (del Pozo et al., 2002a). The effective field of view\nat 100 km altitude is a square which covers 67.8\u25e6\u201370.2\u25e6\nlatitude and 17.8\u25e6\u201323.8\u25e6 east longitude, so the field line\nwhich crosses the EISCAT common volume at 300 km\naltitude is well within the field of view.\n3 Observations\nThe data presented in this paper stem from two observa-\ntional campaigns, one in March 2002 and one in March 2003,\nwhere EISCAT was run in a tristatic mode and the common\nvolume was monitored through the Odin imager. A typical\nobservation of black patches, with the EISCAT plasma drift\nvelocity measurement superposed, is shown in Fig. 1 (this\none from 2 March 2003, 22:02:08 UT).\nTable 1 gives the geophysical context for each black au-\nrora event in the two campaigns.

The March 2002\nevents (02A\u201302C) happened just after a substorm, during\nrather quiet conditions. The March 2003 events (03A\u201303E)\nall happened in substorm expansion phase or right in between\nsubstorms, and exhibit much more active auroras than the\n2002 events. This is also seen in the electron density mea-\nsurements. For March 2002 (02A\u201302C) the electron density\nrarely exceeds 1011 m\u22123 (Figs. 7 and 8), while it is signifi-\ncantly higher in the other events (Figs. 9 and 10). There were\nno indications of plasma density dropouts in the E-region\nassociated with any of the black aurora events, which Blixt\nand Kosch (2004) used as an indicator for the lack of strong\ndownward field-aligned currents when they analyzed events\n1614 E.

In event 02A two east-west aligned black arcs\ndrift slowly south, and fast moving ripples were seen to move\nwest along the borders of the black arcs. In event 02B, two\nblack patches slowly transform into a thin black arc, which\ndrifts slowly northward. Ripples are seen to move both east\nand west along the borders. For both of these events there\nis no connection between the drift of the optical black au-\nrora and the plasma flow, and there is no sign of shear flow\nin the aurora. Event 02C shows thin distorted black arcs in-\ntertwined with streaks of enhanced luminosity on a diffuse\nbackground. Black arcs are seen to drift west at the end of\nthe event, which correlate well in both direction and magni-\ntude with the E\u00d7B flow.\nIn event 03A the black structures drift much faster than\nin the earlier events. An example image of the black aurora\nduring this event is shown in Fig. 1. At the beginning several\nblack patches drift westward at a speed of about 2.6 km\/s, di-\nrectly anti-parallel to the observed plasma flow. The black\npatches then slow down and start moving eastward, with a\nslightly lower speed. This is the only report of westward\ndrifting black patches in the literature as far as the authors\nknow. Figure 1 shows the black patches just as they are start-\ning to move eastward. Event 03B is the direct continuation\nof 03A, and covers a period where the diffuse aurora gradu-\nally disintegrates. The lower image in Fig. 3 shows how the\ndiffuse aurora is nearly gone at the end of the event. At the\nbeginning there are two thin black arcs (not shown) aligned\nwith the E\u00d7B flow vector. The two black arcs soon sepa-\nrate and disappear, and there are signs of shear flow in the\nE. M.

The riometer observations tabulated in Table 4 indi-\ncate that there are precipitating particles with energies over\n25 keV present in all events. As a part of the tail of the\nelectron energy distribution, this is consistent with the as-\nsumed altitude of the background aurora (105 km) within\nwhich the black aurora is visible, as well as the typical\nprecipitating particle energy associated with diffuse aurora\n(Paschmann et al., 2002).\n2003-03-04, 23:11:23.16 UTC\nEast, 300 m\/s\nNorth, 300 m\/s\n2003-03-04, 23:11:23.96 UTC\nEast, 300 m\/s\nNorth, 300 m\/s\nFig. 6.

The electron density profiles measured by\nEISCAT provide indirect information about the characteris-\ntic energy and the overall shape of the incident electron en-\nergy spectrum. As the characteristic energy increases, the\naltitude of maximum electron density decreases in a pre-\ndictable manner. Models of the ionospheric response to an\nauroral particle source have been used to formulate an in-\nverse problem whereby the differential number flux spectrum\nmay be estimated from a measured E-region density profile\nwith no prior assumption on its functional form (Vondrak\nand Baron, 1975; Brekke et al., 1989). Semeter and Kamal-\nabadi (2005) have developed a variant implementation of this\nprocedure involving the Maximum Entropy method and have\nE. M.

Their procedure was\nfound to be robust in the following sense. When an iono-\nspheric electron density profile was computed using a given\nmeasured electron energy spectrum, the original spectrum\ncould be reliably recovered, even if large statistical errors\nwere incorporated in the measurement. The bulk properties\nin the recovered spectrum (e.g. net energy flux, characteris-\ntic energy) were also reliably recovered in the presence of\ncertain types of model uncertainty. Direct verification of in-\nversion results is difficult owing to the difficulty in obtaining\nin-situ measurements for small-scale auroral forms. How-\never, Kirkwood and Eliasson (1990) and Osepian and Kirk-\nwood (1996) have demonstrated order-of-magnitude agree-\nment with conjugate satellite measurements.\nFigures 7 through 10 show typical electron density pro-\nfiles, together with the accompanying recovered spectra for\neach event. Some cautionary points should be made concern-\ning the interpretation of the recovered spectra. First, as the\nelectron energy increases, the sensitivity of the altitude of the\nionization peak to changes in characteristic energy decreases\ndramatically. At the same time, for energies <500 eV, the\nelectron deposition altitude is above 180 km, where electron\ndensity may be influenced by horizontal transport. Thus,\nthere is a range of energies from 0.5 to \u223c40 keV where the\ninversion can be considered reliable.\nAlthough the shape of the recovered energy spectra is not\nconstrained in the inversion, the spectra often take the form\nof an exponentially decaying background distribution with an\nadditional suprathermal distribution (bump in tail), as seen in\nFigs. 7 to Figs. 10. Extensive studies show that the \u03ba distri-\nbution is very good at fitting the high energy tail often found\nin space plasmas (Vasyliunas, 1968; Olsson and Janhunen,\n1998; Kletzing et al., 2003). In our effort to fit the recovered\nspectra to a model, we choose to use a simpler distribution\ncloser to the Maxwellian distribution,\nF(E)=A0(E\/kT )\u03b3 exp\n(\n\u2212 E\nkT\n)\n, (1)\n1010 1011 1012\nElectron Density (m-3)\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nAl\nt (k\nm)\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nEnergy (keV)\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\nJ N\n \n(cm\n-\n2 s\n-\n1 e\nV-\n1 )\nTime: 2002-03-05, 20:03:29 UTC,  E\n0\n =  2.7 [keV],  kT =  2.6 [keV]\n02A\n1010 1011 1012\nElectron Density (m-3)\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nAl\nt (k\nm)\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nEnergy (keV)\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\nJ N\n \n(cm\n-\n2 s\n-\n1 e\nV-\n1 )\nTime: 2002-03-05, 20:13:59 UTC\n02B\nFig. 7. Electron density profiles and differential number flux (cal-\nculated through inversion of the density profile) for events 02A and\n02B. When applicable, a Maxwellian function (dotted line) has been\nfitted to the secondary peak in the spectra. This gives approxima-\ntions to the characteristic energy (E0) and temperature (kT ) of the\nprecipitating electron population.\nwhere E is the energy in keV. This function will not fit the\nhigh energy tail so well, but, as mentioned above, the inver-\nsion is not so reliable at high energies. Our simpler model\nwill yield a reasonable estimate of the characteristic energy\nof the suprathermal peaks occurring in the 0.5 to 40 keV\nrange. For \u03b3=0, Eq. (1) describes an exponential distribu-\ntion, for \u03b3=1 a Maxwellian, and for \u03b3\u22652 a modified power-\nlaw distribution (Rees, 1989). kT is the temperature of the\nsource (in keV), and we have defined the characteristic en-\nergy, E0, as the energy for which the supra-thermal distribu-\ntion peaks. The distribution in Eq. (1) is not an accelerated\ndistribution (Evans, 1974). The reason for this choice is that\nthe electrons generating the diffuse aurora, within which the\nblack aurora appears, are thought not to have been acceler-\nated (Strickland et al., 1994).\nThe black aurora events studied here last from about 1 to\n5 min. As the diffuse aurora changes slowly in each event,\nand the EISCAT data post-integration time is fairly long (20\u2013\n30 s), the shape of the recovered spectra (Figs. 7 through 10)\nremains fairly stationary during each of the events.

The dotted\nlines are far from being perfect fits, but we have chosen to\nuse a model with only a few parameters to keep the model\nsimple and transparent. Our major interest is only the loca-\ntion and width of the secondary supra-thermal peak. The re-\nsulting characteristic energy ranges from about 2 to 11 keV,\nand Table 4 shows the results (except for A0, which does\nnot concern us here) in more detail. Most of the events are\nquasi-Maxwellian, however, \u03b3=4.0 in event 03B indicates\nthat the energy distribution is more of a modified power-\nlaw type, which suggests that the tail of the distribution has\nbecome wider in this case, presumably under some sort of\nacceleration process.

Note how the drift velocity increases\nwith energy.\n5 Discussion and results\nOur motivation in this paper is to study how the black patches\ndrift relative to the ionospheric plasma, and whether the drift\nvelocity depends on the energy of the electrons in the diffuse\naurora. Both of these factors are pertinent to the question\nof whether the black patches are drifting with the magneto-\nspheric gradient-B curvature drift or not.\n1010 1011 1012\nElectron Density (m-3)\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nAl\nt (k\nm)\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nEnergy (keV)\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\nJ N\n \n(cm\n-\n2 s\n-\n1 e\nV-\n1 )\nTime: 2003-03-02, 22:06:10 UTC,  E\n0\n =  9.5 [keV],  kT =  2.6 [keV]\n03B\n1010 1011 1012\nElectron Density (m-3)\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nAl\nt (k\nm)\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nEnergy (keV)\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\nJ N\n \n(cm\n-\n2 s\n-\n1 e\nV-\n1 )\nTime: 2003-03-02, 23:56:10 UTC,  E\n0\n =  6.6 [keV],  kT =  3.8 [keV]\n03C\nFig. 9. The same as Fig. 7 but for events 03B and 03C.\nAs hot plasma convects inwards from the central plasma\nsheet, the highest energy particles start gradient-B curva-\nture drifting already at 10\u201312RE . Inside of the stable trap-\nping boundary for the high-energy outer belt particles (Feld-\nstein, 1974), there is a relatively warm isotropic plasma (\u223c1\u2013\n10s keV) which is the source plasma for the diffuse aurora\n(Paschmann et al., 2002). This plasma is bounded on the\nequatorial side by the 10\u2013100 keV ring current and the MeV\nradiation belts. It is safe to say that this source region is\nbounded between approximately 6 and 12RE . It is generally\nbelieved that the electron precipitation in the diffuse aurora\nis due to scattering or diffusion into the loss cone, and not\nacceleration (Strickland et al., 1994).\nRecent results and models suggest that black patches are\ndue to a local drop-out of precipitating electrons, and not\ndue to downward field-aligned current (Kimball and Halli-\nnan, 1998a; Peticolas et al., 2002; Blixt and Kosch, 2004).\nKimball and Hallinan (1998a) noted that limited pitch angle\ndiffusion might be responsible for the black patches. They\nalso remarked that the general eastward drift of the observed\nblack patches is consistent with the gradient-B curvature drift\nof trapped energetic electrons in the magnetosphere, and sug-\ngested that the black patches might represent structures in\nthe high-energy electron population, without specifying what\nthese \u201cstructures\u201d could be. This model is based on the work\nby Chiu et al. (1983), who argued that the precipitating hot\nE. M.

The same as Fig. 7 but for events 03D and 03E.\nelectrons that create optical signatures are gradient drifting\nazimuthally on trajectories which can depart significantly\nfrom the ionospheric convection path. Results from com-\nbined FAST and airborne auroral imager studies by Peticolas\net al. (2002) indicate (their Fig. 4) that black patches are as-\nsociated with a large dropout in energy flux at energies of\n2\u201310 keV in the loss cone. They attributed this \u201cmissing\u201d\nloss cone to a local suppression of whistler waves (upper-\nband chorus wave). These waves were assumed to be re-\nsponsible for the scattering of energetic particle into the loss\ncone. Furthermore, Blixt and Kosch (2004) showed through\nEISCAT observations of electron density within non-sheared\nblack patches that they were not associated with any signifi-\ncant downward currents.\nEarlier observations indicate that black patches are not\ndrifting with the E\u00d7B flow. Trondsen and Cogger (1997)\nnoticed that black patches drifted with respect to the mag-\nnetic field, and not with it. In a group of drifting black\npatches, individual patches underwent identical deformations\nat a fixed position in space, suggesting that they might have\nbeen drifting relative to a fixed magnetic field. Simultane-\nous measurements of drifting black aurora and ionospheric\nelectric fields by Schoute-Vanneck et al. (1990) also showed\nthat the black aurora did not drift with the E\u00d7B flow in the\nionosphere.\nFig. 11. Scatter plot of the observed black auroral drift (vd , aster-\nisks) and measured plasma flow velocity (vp , triangles) against the\ncharacteristic energy (E0).\nIf the black patches are due to structures (where the pitch\nangle diffusion is locally hindered, or not enabled) in the\nhigh-energy electron population, which drift along with the\nmagnetospheric plasma, we should see an energy depen-\ndence in the drift of the black patches. However, it should be\nnoted that these localized regions need not drift with the hot\nplasma, they could drift along with structures in the waves\nwhich are responsible for the strong pitch angle scattering,\nor whatever process is causing the lack of pitch angle scat-\ntering in the black aurora. Nonetheless, at this stage we are\nonly capable of testing whether the drift of black patches is\nconsistent with the drift of the hot magnetospheric plasma or\nwith the ionospheric E\u00d7B velocity, as the exact mechanism\nor process from which the black patches are generated is still\nunknown. Figure 11 is arranged so as to show if such an\nenergy dependence is present. It shows a scatter plot of the\nobserved drift velocity of the black aurora (asterisks) versus\nthe measured characteristic energy (E0) of the precipitating\nparticles within the diffuse background aurora, and there is\nclearly an increase in drift speed with increasing energy. We\nhave used the maximum velocity observed during each event\nin Fig. 11. Events 02B and 03E are not included (for 02B\nwe have no estimate of the characteristic energy, and for 03E\nwe have no estimate of the drift velocity of the black aurora).\nThe plot also shows the measured ionospheric plasma flow\nvelocity (triangles) versus E0. Note how the plasma flow ve-\nlocity is essentially the same at all energies. The deduced\nrange of energies fit well with the observations of Peticolas\net al. (2002), who associated black auroras with a dropout in\nelectron energy flux at energies of 2 \u2013 10 keV.\nWe can go a step further and compare the observed drift\nvelocities with the combined gradient-B and curvature drift\nin the magnetosphere. This drift is given by\nvgc = (W\u22a5 + 2W\u2016)(B \u00d7\u2207)B\neB3\n, (2)\nwhere W\u22a5 and W\u2016 are the perpendicular and parallel ener-\ngies of the plasma. If the source plasma is considered to be\n1620 E. M. Blixt et al.: Relative drift between black aurora and the ionospheric plasma\nisotropic, which is a fairly good approximation in this case,\nand if the magnetic field is given by a dipole field, which may\nnot be such a good approximation at distances of more than\n6 Earth-radii (RE) away from Earth, the angular velocity of\nthe electrons (eastward in the equatorial plane) is\nv\u03c6 = 2pi LW3\u00d7106 [rad\/s], (3)\nwhere L is the distance from the surface of the Earth in RE ,\nand W is the energy of the electrons in keV (Parks, 1991).\nThis angular velocity can be mapped down to the iono-\nsphere and the resulting drift velocity in the ionosphere, for\ndifferent energies and L-shells, can be compared with the\nobserved drift velocities of the black patches.\nThe observed range of velocities (1.5\u20134 km\/s) correspond\nto the gradient-B curvature drift of 10\u201350 keV electrons for\n6 \u2264L\u226412 (the assumed source region of the diffuse aurora).\nWhile these high energies are consistent with the riometer\nobservations of the high energy tail of the precipitating elec-\ntron energy distribution, it is unlikely that the bulk of the\nparticles generating the diffuse aurora have such high en-\nergy. This is foremost because the ionospheric density pro-\nfile generated by such high energy bulk particles is inconsis-\ntent with the density profile measured by the EISCAT radar.\nThe mismatch between observed characteristic energy (2\u2013\n11 keV) estimated from the density profiles, and the energy\ndeduced from the gradient-B curvature drift in a dipole field\n(10\u201350 keV), may have two major contributing factors. First,\nsince the theoretical drift velocity yields higher velocities for\nlarger gradients in B, and the dipole field overestimates the\ngradient in B compared to a stretched dipole, the electrons\nmay, in reality, move slower than what the model suggests.\nThus, we overestimate the energy of the electrons at a given\ndrift speed. In order for the energy of the gradient-B curva-\nture drift in a dipole field to match with the observed energy\nof the diffuse aurora, we need to assume that the dipole field\nmodel is overestimating the energy with a factor of three. Al-\nthough we can expect large variations from the dipole field at\ndistances close to 10\u201312RE (the outside boundary of the dif-\nfuse aurora source region), especially during disturbed con-\nditions such as those reported here, it is beyond the scope of\nthis article to model the gradient-B curvature drift in more\nrealistic magnetic field models. Second, the mechanism that\nhinders scattering into the loss cone need not drift with the\nparticle population that generates the diffuse aurora. Thus,\nif the dipole field model can be assumed to be correct, the\nmechanism that hinders scattering into the loss cone drifts\nwith a higher energy particle population (10\u201350 keV), while\nthe diffuse aurora is generated by a 2\u201311-keV electron popu-\nlation.\nThe tendency for the black aurora drift speed to increase\nwith the energy of the precipitating electrons, and the fact\nthat the absolute majority of black patches are observed to\ndrift eastwards, lend support to the hypothesis that the mech-\nanism generating the black aurora is drifting with the hot\nmagnetospheric electrons. However, there is one case in\nwhich black patches drift westward (beginning of 03A, at\naround 22:02 UT), counter to the gradient-B curvature drift.\nAll earlier observations of drifting black patches (Parsons\nand Thomas, 1973; Schoute-Vanneck et al., 1990; Trondsen\nand Cogger, 1997; Kimball and Hallinan, 1998a) are east-\nward, and it is uncertain what creates the discrepancy in this\ncase. It could be that the substorm onset just prior to the start\nof the event (according to SAMNET there is one onset at\n21:50 and another at 22:11 UT) caused dramatic changes in\nthe shape of the magnetic field line sufficient to temporarily\nreverse the drift direction (Li et al., 1998).\n6 Summary and conclusions\nEight events, each about 1\u20134 min long, where black auroras\nhave been observed through an image intensified video cam-\nera and where the EISCAT radar measured the ionospheric\nplasma flow and electron density, have been examined in or-\nder to study whether black patches are drifting with a veloc-\nity consistent with the gradient-B curvature velocity of the\nhot source plasma or not. The results show that most black\npatches drift eastward, with v\u223c1.5\u20134 km\/s, which is faster\nthan that which Kimball and Hallinan (1998a) and Trondsen\nand Cogger (1997) observed, but similar to what Parsons and\nThomas (1973) and Schoute-Vanneck et al. (1990) observed.\nThe observed drifts of the black patches is several km\/s faster\nthan the ionospheric plasma flow, but often in the same direc-\ntion. One case of westward drifting black patches, opposite\nto the gradient-B curvature drift, is reported for the first time.\nThe reason for this westward drift remains unclear.\nThrough an inversion of the electron density profiles, the\ncharacteristic energy of the precipitating electrons has been\nestimated, and these agree well with observations by Petico-\nlas et al. (2002). Most significantly, we have found that the\ndrift velocity of the black patches increases with the energy\nof the precipitating particles. As expected, theE\u00d7B velocity\nwas found to be unrelated to the particle energy. The increase\nin drift velocity with energy and the direction is consistent\nwith the magnetospheric gradient-B curvature drift, but only\nan order-of-magnitude agreement in actual drift speed could\nbe established with a rudimentary model of the gradient-B\ncurvature drift speed in a dipole field.\nOur findings support the theory that black patches are due\nto structures in the magnetospheric hot plasma where scat-\ntering into the loss cone has been suppressed, and that these\nstructures are gradient-B curvature drifting along with the\nhot plasma, thereby generating an eastward drift of the black\npatches which is increasing with increasing energy of the\nprecipitating electrons.\nAcknowledgements.
