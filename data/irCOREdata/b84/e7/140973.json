Introduction \nFor the damage tolerance design of aircraft structures, fatigue tests are required at all \nstructural levels according to the airworthiness regulations [1] to support and validate the \ncrack growth life predictions. There are several aspects in both the practical fatigue testing \nand the development of predictive models.  \nSince a representative service loading spectrum can contain a large number of low amplitude \nload cycles that do not cause fatigue damage but consume unacceptable testing time and cost \nin the full scale fatigue tests (FSFT), an economic and common practice is to eliminate these \nlow amplitude stress cycles in the test spectrum. Tests and analysis on laboratory specimens \nare necessary to determine an acceptable load truncation level for the FSFT of a structural \ncomponent. These laboratory sample tests are used to demonstrate that the elimination of \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n3 \ncertain low-range loads will not change the characteristic of the crack growth and have little \ninfluence on crack growth life while considering the scale of time saving.  \nThe second aspect is the requirement of life prediction tools. Fatigue crack growth (FCG) \nbehaviour and life prediction methods under the constant amplitude loads (CAL) have been \nwell established for commonly used aluminium alloys. The problem of predicting FCG life \nunder the variable amplitude loads (VAL) is still challenging due to the load sequence and \nload interaction effects [2, 3]. For simple VAL sequences, e.g. large numbers of CAL cycles \nplus occasional tensile overload cycles, or an overload followed by an underload, current \nprediction methods include the Wheeler [4], the Generalised Willenborg [5, 6], and the crack \nclosure models [7, 8]. These models and a few others have now been implemented in \ncomputer packages, such as the AFGROW crack growth analysis code [8].  However, the \nproblem of life prediction gets more complex when randomly ordered flight-by-flight loading \nspectrum is used. In most of the cases, the low-amplitude load cycles that tend to be \neliminated contribute little to the fatigue crack growth. However, for some circumstances, the \nelimination of small load cycles might shift the balance between the crack initiation and crack \ngrowth phases [9]. Moreover, the overload retardation effect is found to be very sensitive to \nsubsequent underload cycles [2, 10, 11] as well as to the cycle numbers of subsequent lower \namplitude stresses [10].  \nThirdly, the influence of the low-amplitude load cycles on crack growth rates also depends on \nthe material properties and test sample\u2019s material orientation. In the last four decades, most \nresearch efforts in the aircraft applications have been focused on the 2024 and 7075 \naluminium alloys (AA). Consequently, adequate crack growth prediction models are now \navailable [12]. In recent years, trend in the aircraft industry is to gradually introduce new \nversions of the 2000 and the 7000 series alloys due to their superior mechanical properties. \nTheir performance in terms of FCG life in flight-by-flight loads needs to be investigated.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n4 \nThe materials investigated in this study are the AA 2324-T39 and AA 7050-T7451, which are \nwidely employed in the current generation of aircraft components. The former is a higher \nstrength version of AA 2024-T351 and is a high-purity controlled composition variant of \n2024, and is mainly applied on the lower wing skin and center wing box components of new \ncommercial transport aircraft. The fracture behavior and crack growth behavior of 2324 have \nbeen widely investigated in recent years for better understanding and further application of \nthis material [13]. Alloy 7050 is the premier choice for aerospace applications requiring the \nbest possible combination of strength, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance and \ntoughness. However, it is one of these highly anisotropic alloys; consequently, crack growth \nbehaviour along the short transverse direction (L-S) is found to be quite different from that \nalong the long transverse direction (L-T). Nevertheless, the L-S orientated plates have found \nsome applications in the spar caps and stringer webs of machined integral skin-stringer panels. \nProgress has been made in understanding the crack growth behaviour in L-S orientated AA \n7050-T7451 plates under CAL at different stress ratios [14, 15], in which comparisons of the \nfailure modes between the L-S and T-L plates under truncated loading spectra are also \npresented. Small crack growth rates in AA 7050-T7451 subjected to simple load sequences \ncontaining underloads are reported in [16] to generate constant amplitude crack growth data \nfor use in life predictions.  \nThe experimental tests conducted in this study were designed to achieve two objectives: 1) to \nselect a suitable low-load truncation level for the FSFT; 2) to investigate the characteristics of \ncrack growth behavior under different load spectra with various truncation levels. The first \nobjective was achieved and reported in [17]. The purpose of this paper is to present the \ninvestigation findings towards the second objective, which covers the studies of crack growth \nbehaviour under a flight-by-flight loading spectrum of a civil transport aircraft wing at \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n5 \ndifferent small-stress range truncation levels and the performance of current predictive models \nin spectrum loads. \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Material \nCrack propagation tests were conducted using the middle-crack tension, M(T), specimens \nmade of AA 2324-T39 and AA 7050-T7451. The configuration and orientation of the \nspecimens are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The material data is found in reference [18,19]. \nFor alloy 2324,  (WT.%), Si 0.1, Fe 0.12, Cu 3.8-4.4, Mn 0.3-0.9, Mg 1.2-1.8, Cr 0.10, Zn \n0.25, Ti 0.15, others each 0.05, others total 0.15, Aluminum Remainder. For alloy 7050, \n(WT.%), Si 0.12, Fe 0.15, Cu 2.0-2.6, Mn 0.10, Mg 1.9-2.6, Cr 0.04, Zn 5.7-6.7, Zr 0.08-\n0.115, Ti 0.06, others each 0.05, others total 0.15, Balance Aluminum. The mechanical \nproperties are fully defined in [18, 19] and presented in Table 2. Crack growth rate and \nfatigue properties are available for the L-T orientation (refer to Fig. 1) for both alloys [20].  \nA total of 66 specimens were tested; for each load truncation level six specimens were tested \nfor AA 2324-T39 and five specimens for AA 7050-T7451. \n2.2 Load spectra \nThe baseline load spectrum is a flight-by-flight spectrum with each load block simulating \n4200 flights. The gust and manoeuvres loads are represented by ten load levels flatulating \naround the mean load corresponding to 1g flight condition. The flights in each load block are \nclassified into five types, stated as A, B, C, D and E, respectively, according to the stress \nlevels. Flight type A is the most severe loading condition occurring only once in each block, \nwhereas flight type E is the least severe occurring 2958 times in each block. The five flight \ntypes were arranged randomly within one block except that flight type A was arranged to \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n6 \noccur near the middle and in the second half of a block. The taking-off and landing taxiing \nloads were taken into account by eight equivalent loading cycles in each flight. Fig. 2(a) \nillustrates a loading segment of the baseline spectrum containing the flight types A, B and E. \nIt can be seen that the spectrum is dominated by tension loads.  \nThe baseline spectrum (S0) was filtered by removing small stress range cycles to obtain \ndifferent truncated spectra, while the taxiing loads during each flight were retained. A 9.82% \ntruncation level indicates that those load cycles with stress range less than 9.82% of the \nmaximum stress range in the S0 were removed, while the other parts of the spectrum were \nkept unchanged. So no matter what the load truncation level is, the mean stress level remains \nto correspond to the 1g acceleration. There are five truncation levels resulting in five different \ntruncated load spectra, named as S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5, shown in Table 3. Fig. 2(b) shows the \nload sequences of flight type A in S0 and S5. \n2.3 Fatigue testing \nPre-cracking was accomplished under constant amplitude load of 90max =\u03c3  MPa, 06.0=R  \nwhich resulted in an initial half crack length 0a  of about 5.5 mm. The FCG tests were \nsubsequently carried out under the aforementioned six load spectra until the half crack length \na  was greater than 24 mm. \nAll the tests were conducted using the MTS 880 fatigue test system. Specimens were held in a \npair of 100 mm wide hydraulic wedge grips.  \nAn observation system consisting of a digital microscope, servo motor and raster ruler was \nused to record the crack tip position. Incremental crack length measurements were made on \nboth the right and left sides of the front surface of the specimen. The following rules were \nadopted when recording the crack length: (1) If it is an ideal mode I crack, which is \nperpendicular to the applied loads and propagating along the x-axis, the crack length is the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n7 \ntrue distance from the symmetric axis of the specimen to the crack tip, Fig. 3(a); (2) If the \ncrack has deviated from the horizontal x-axis, then the crack length refers to the projected \nlength of the crack on the x-axis, Fig. 3(b); (3) If the crack has branched, the recorded crack \nlength is the projected length of the longest branch, Fig. 3(c). \n3. Prediction method \n3.1 Review of available crack growth prediction models \nBased on the principle of the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), FCG rates can be \ncorrelated with the stress intensity factor range \u2206K. There are many empirical FCG laws to \ndescribe this relationship. Paris law [21] is the first and most popular, which correlates crack \ngrowth rate da\/dN with only the \u2206K. During the following decades, modifications to the Paris \nlaw have been developed by taking into account of different factors. For example, the Forman \n[22] and Walker equations [23] were proposed to encompass the mean stress effect. Both the \nParis and Walker equations work well for the stable crack growth stage showing good \nlinearity in double logarithm coordinate of da\/dN vs. \u2206K. The Forman equation [22] also \nintroduces the parameter of critical stress intensity factor Kc therefore can be applied in the \nprediction of the final fracture regime. Hartman and Schijve [24] suggested a modified form \nof Paris law by adding a parameter of stress intensity threshold which depended strongly on \nthe alloy and the environment. The NASGRO equation [8] takes account of the influences of \nthe mean stress, the critical and threshold SIF, and plasticity-induced crack closure by \nintroducing several empirical constants. Most of the empirical constants in the above \nmentioned crack growth laws are obtained by fitting measured crack growth test data under \nconstant amplitude stresses.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n8 \nWhen variable amplitude loading is applied, crack growth behaviour shows more complicated \ncharacters. One of the most important factors that should be taken into account is the \nprofound overload retardation effect [2, 12]. However, this effect is much reduced when the \ntension overload is immediately followed by compressive underload [2, 12]. Furthermore, if a \nload history has peak loads with a long recurrence period, i.e. peak overload cycle is followed \nby large numbers of baseline stress cycles, it will result in large retardation in the crack \ngrowth curve, while an almost regular crack growth curve may be resulted by a load history \nwhich has peak loads with a short recurrence period [10]. These two factors were paid more \nattention in this study, since the loading spectra in this study all contain a tensile overload in \nthe flight type A which is followed by a negative underload, and with the increase of load \ntruncation levels, the recurrence periods between the two overload peaks become shorter and \nshorter. \nA number of crack growth models have been developed to account for the load interaction \neffects and thereby enable predictions of crack growth lives. Most of the retardation models \nare based on either the crack tip plastic zone concept or the crack closure argument. Five \nretardation models are available in the crack growth prediction software AFGROW; they are \nthe Closure model [7, 8], the FASTRAN model [25], the Hsu [26], Wheeler [4] and \nWillenborg models [5, 6]. Each retardation model has one or more user adjustable \nparameter(s), which are used to tune the model to fit the actual test data. Ideally, the \nparameter in crack retardation models should be a material constant, which is independent of \nother variables such as the spectrum sequence or load level. The Generalised Willenborg \nmodel is a modified version of the original Willenborg model. Physical arguments were used \nto account for the reduction of the overload retardation due to subsequent underloads. The \nAFGROW code has adapted the treatment of the underload acceleration effect by using the \nChang\u2019s model [8, 27] to adjust the overload induced yield zone size. Therefore the effect of \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n9 \ncompressive stresses after a tension overload is considered. This model is suitable to the \noverload\/underload pattern found in the load spectra used in this study as shown in Fig. 2(b). \nThe AFGROW Closure model is based on the original Elber\u2019s crack closure concept [7] and \ndeveloped by Harter et al. [8]. This type of crack closure models has been very popular in \nboth the constant and variable amplitude loads because they correlate crack growth rates with \nthe effective stress intensity factor range, which is affected by the applied loads and crack \nopening displacements; both can be related to the cyclic plasticity effect. The AFGROW \nClosure model uses a single adjustable parameter (Cf 0) that is determined at stress ratio R = 0 \nin order to \u201ctune\u201d the closure model for a given material. The suggested Cf 0 value by \nAFGROW for aluminium alloys is 0.3 [8]. \n3.2 Crack growth and retardation laws used in this study \nIn this study, FCG life predictions were accomplished by using the AFGROW computer \npackage [20] and employing the NASGRO equation [8], eq. (1). Since this equation takes \naccount of the influences of the mean stress, the critical and threshold SIF, and plasticity-\ninduced crack closure, it usually gives more accurate predictions provided that the required \nmaterial constants are available. The material constants used in the NASGRO equation for \ncommonly used aluminium alloys, including 2324-T39 studied here, are provided in the \ndatabase of the AFGROW package. \n q\ncrit\np\nth\nn\nK\nK\nK\nK\nK\nR\nfC\nN\na\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\u2212\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\u000b\n\f \u2206\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\nmax1\n1\n1\n1\nd\nd\n (1) \nIn order to find a suitable crack retardation model for further analyses of the truncated load \nspectra, attempts have been made to predict FCG life from a =5.5 mm to 22 mm under the S0 \nspectrum using the Generalised Willenborg model and Closure model. The prediction results \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n10 \nare shown in Table 4. It indicates that both the No-retardation model and the Generalized \nWillenborg model have achieved good agreement with the test result, whereas the Closure \nmodel underestimated the life by 13% using the recommended  0fC =0.3. Prediction is found \nto be sensitive to the value of  parameter 0fC . \nThe following crack life predictions are performed by the NASGRO equation (no retardation) \nand NASGRO equation plus the Generalised Willenborg model. \n4. Results and discussion \n4.1 Crack growth morphology \n4.1.1  AA 2324-T39 L-T oriented specimen \nIt has been observed during the experiment that cracks subjected to load spectra S0, S1, S2 \nand S3 are perfect mode I cracks which are flat and straight and perpendicular to the applied \nloads direction. However, significant crack meandering and\/or branching are observed when \nthe low-load range truncation is increased to a certain level, i.e. S4 and S5, shown in Fig. 4. A \ntypical branched crack occurred under spectrum S4 is illustrated in Fig. 5. It is amazing that \nthe crack always tended to grow away from the centerline of the specimen rather than taking a \nzigzag route. \nThe crack growth rate dropped significantly after the crack had branched. Some evidence has \nbeen found for the relationship between the crack growth path change and the peak stress in \nthe flight type A. This will be discussed in section 4.3. However, branching was not observed \nimmediately after the maximum overload. It can be deduced that the tension overload had \nintroduced a few secondary cracks in the subsurface of the specimen, which were later \nobserved at the surface of the specimen. The lead crack and the secondary cracks kept \ngrowing for a period of loading cycles until they were linked up, which has resulted in the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n11 \nobserved branched crack. The appearance of the secondary cracks and the linking up process \nare shown in Fig. 6. \nThe final failure mode of the branched crack under tension load is almost the same as the \nperfect mode I crack, showing the typical characteristic of mode I crack in ductile materials, \nsee insert of Fig. 5.  \n4.1.2 AA 7050-T7451 L-S oriented specimen \nCrack turning, meandering, branching and splitting (90?  turn) were observed on some \nspecimens whatever the load truncation level was applied as shown in Fig. 7(a). However, not \nall the specimens showed significant crack turning or branching. It is quit different from the \n2324-T39 L-T specimens, in which crack branching occurred only under the spectrum S4 and \nS5. Schubbe also observed crack branching and splitting in 7050-T7451 L-S oriented \nspecimens [14, 15]. He has pointed out that significant forward growth retardation or splitting \nis evident at a threshold K\u2206  value in the range of 10-15 MPa m  and a distinct crack arrest \npoint where vertical growth is dominating is found when K\u2206  is between 18 and 20 MPa m  \n[14]. In this study, the K\u2206  value corresponding to the peak stress range in flight type A at \ninitial crack length 0a =5.5 mm is already above 22 MPa m , therefore the reason for \nobserved crack branching and splitting is understood, whether or not the load spectrum was \ntruncated.  However, it should be mentioned here that slight crack branching was also \nobserved occasionally during the pre-cracking stage with fatigue crack length no more than \n0.5 mm from the edge of the saw-cut and  K\u2206 < 10 MPa m , see Fig. 7(b). \nIt was hard to get the normal mode I failure strength when performing the residual strength \ntesting after the half crack length a had reached 24 mm. Longitudinal splitting occurred \nparallel to the load direction, as shown in Fig. 8.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n12 \n4.2 Crack growth lives \nSince the loading cycle numbers are different in different load spectra corresponding to \ndifferent truncation levels, FCG life is defined as the number of flights, fN , rather than the \nnumber of load cycles N. Initial half crack length 0a  was 5.5 mm for all the specimens.  \nMeasured a  vs. fN  data corresponding to the S0, S2 and S4 load spectra are shown in Fig. 9 \n(a) and (b) for the two aluminum alloys, which indicate good linearity in the log-linear \ncoordinate. For the clarity of illustration, measured data for spectra S1, S3 and S5 are omitted \nin these figures. They do follow the same trend and similar scatter range. Fig. 9 (c) and (d) \npresent the best fitted curves of the test data with respect to all the loading spectra using \nexponential linear least square method, eq. (2),  \n \nfBNAea =  (2) \nwhere, A and B are fitting parameters. Since 0a  = 5.5 mm, find 5.5=A . \nCrack growth retardation due to overload effect are not obvious in this figure for spectra S0, \nS1, S2, and S3. The significant retardation found in the S4 and S5 spectra tests was partially \ncaused by the crack branching described in section 4.1 and partially by the removal of large \nnumbers of load cycles at these two higher truncation levels. \n4.3 Prediction of crack growth lives \nCrack growth life predictions were performed using the AFGROW code. Predicted a ~ fN  \ncurves for AA 2324-T39 are shown in Fig. 10. The loading spectra and specimen \nconfiguration used in the prediction are the same as those used in the experimental tests. In \nthe figures, \u201cNo Retardation\u201d means no load sequence effect was considered; \u201cWillenborg\u201d \ndemotes the Generalized Willenborg model. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n13 \nFollowing observations can be made: (1) For S0, S1, S2 and S3, i.e. load range truncation \nlevel of 0%, 9.82%, 11.72% and 13.98% of the maximum load range, the predicted lives \nagree well with the test results. (2) Under the spectra S4 and S5, 17.11% and 21.36% \ntruncation levels, measured crack growth lives are much longer than the predicted by \nWillenborg model. Such differences in the model and measurement cannot be related to the \noverload retardation effect alone. The main reason is the occurrence of significant crack \nmeandering and branching under these two loading spectra, as mentioned in 4.1, which slow \ndown the lead crack growth rate significantly. This kind of crack growth retardation \nmechanism is very different from that due to the overload induced plastic zone effect. Crack \npath deviation was not observed in the tests subjected to load spectra S0, S1, S2 and S3. \nHence, the FCG life predictions are fairly accurate, even though the same tensile overloads \nexist in these spectra as in the S4 and S5. (3) Predicted lives obtained by the \u201cNo Retardation\u201d \nmodel and \u201cWillenborg\u201d model do not differ from each other too much; both are located \nwithin the scatter band of the test data. This is mainly due to the overload pattern: an \nunderload is immediately following the overload, see Fig. 2(b), reducing the retardation effect. \nConsidering the preferred conservativeness in practical applications, NASGRO equation \nwithout overload retardation is applicable for such kind of load spectrum investigated in this \nstudy with low-stress range truncation levels no higher than 14% of the maximum stress range. \nSince the crack growth rate data in terms of KNa \u2206~dd  is not available for the 7050-T7451 \nL-S orientation in the AFGROW package, FCG life prediction for this material under \nspectrum loads was not conducted. Schubbe published some KNa \u2206~dd crack growth data \nfor AA 7050-T7451 L-S orientation under constant amplitude loads at different stress ratios in \n[14]. Attempts have been made to use these data and the Harter T-method to predict crack \ngrowth lives for 7050-T7451 under spectrum loads. However, the KNa \u2206~dd  curves in [14] \nhave a characteristic divergent sinusoidal trend of growth when mMPa10>\u2206K , where the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n14 \ngrowth mode alternates between arrested forward growth and splitting, or arrested vertical \ngrowth and continuing forward progression. This crack growth data cannot be used in the \ncrack growth life prediction with the AFGROW, because there is no crack growth model that \ncan take account of such sinusoidal trend of crack growth. \n4.4 Crack growth rate \nIt has been mentioned in section 4.2 that the \u201cNo Retardation\u201d option in AFGROW gives \ngood FCG life predictions under the load spectra S0, S1, S2 and S3. However, when the crack \nbranching or splitting occurred under S4 and S5, the observed significant crack growth \nretardation is not caused by the overload induced yield zone effect; hence it cannot be \npredicted by these retardation models in AFGROW. Another point is that the crack branching \nwas not observed immediately after the maximum stress in the block. Since it is difficult to \nobserve the overload effect from these a ~ Nf  curves, the crack growth rate data may shed \nlight on the effect immediately after each overload. Attempts have been made to find \nexplanations for the relationship between crack growth retardation and tensile overloads. \n Fig. 11 shows the measured da\/Nf ~ Nf   curves for the 2324-T39 L-T and 7050-T7451 L-S \nspecimens under different load truncation levels. Locations of the peak loads in the flight A \nare marked by the vertical lines. The effect of these peak loads on crack growth rate can be \nobserved. These crack growth rate vs. flights curves show periodic changes in both aluminum \nalloys. Following observations can be made: (1) The occurrences of crack retardation follow \nthe maximum tension overload regularly in each load block. (2) Retardation is more \nsignificant at higher truncation levels, S4 and S5, than that at lower truncation levels, S0, S1, \nS2 and S3. (3) Crack growth retardation in 2324-T39 L-T specimens is more significant than \nthat in 7050-T7451 L-S specimens, especially with spectra S4 and S5. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n15 \nIt is mentioned in 4.1 that crack branching was only observed under spectrum S4 and S5 for \nthe 2324-T39 specimens, but for the 7050-T7451 specimen, crack branching and splitting \nwere observed on almost all the six loading spectra. These observations are also reflected by \nplots in Fig. 11. Remarkable retardation was also found under S2, S3 for 7050-T7451, \nespecially when the crack became long, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). However, significant \nretardation can only be seen under S4 and S5 for 2324 alloy in Fig. 11 (a). Referring to Fig. \n10(e) and (f) and discussion in section 4.3, currently available crack growth models are \nincapable of prediction these crack growth morphologies. \nAlthough it can be said from Fig. 10 (a) - (d) that both the \u201cNo Retardation\u201d and \n\u201cWillenborg\u201d model are applicable for 2324-T39 under S0, S1, S2 and S3 spectra, in which  \nno macro-level crack branching was observed, there are still some signs of crack retardation \neven under the baseline spectrum as shown in Fig. 11 (a); this was predicted by the \nWillenborg model, Fig. 10 (a)-(d), and the predicted lives are on the conservative side. Fig. 12 \nshows the \u201cWillenborg\u201d model predicted crack growth rate and comparison with the test \nmeasurements of 2324-T39 under S0. It indicates that: (1) Although tension overload was \nfollowed immediately by an underload, the crack retardation phenomenon can still be \nobserved during the experiment of AA 2324-T39 under S0 with no crack branching. (2) \nAlthough the generalised Willenborg model can predict the crack growth rate in trend, it \ncannot model precisely the crack retardation introduced by such loading spectrum. \n5. Conclusions \n(1) Fatigue crack growth tests on AA 2324-T39 L-T and AA 7050-T7451 L-S oriented M(T) \nspecimens under truncated spectrum loading have shown some abnormal behaviours. For the \n2324 alloy, crack branching was observed when the low-load range truncation was increased \nto a certain level. There was no noticeable crack branching under lower truncation levels. For \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n16 \nthe 7050 L-S specimens, crack branching and slitting were observed in some of the specimens \nirrespective of the load truncation levels, which means that these are mainly resulted from the \ntest material orientations. \n(2) Crack growth life predictions using the AFGROW code have demonstrated that both the \nNASGRO equation without a retardation model and NASGRO plus the generalised \nWillenborg retardation model give good predictions for the 2324 alloy under lower stress \nrange truncation levels when there is no significant crack branching; therefore, both models \ncan be employed in crack growth prediction of structural components subjected to these kind \nof loading spectra. However, all current retardation models derived from the cyclic plasticity \nargument cannot predict the crack retardation caused by crack branching effect. \n(3) Crack growth rate analysis has indicated that the crack growth retardation always followed \nthe peak tensile overload in the spectrum. For the 2324-T39 specimens tested under spectra \nS0, S1, S2 and S3, these retardations are mainly caused by the crack tip and crack wake \nplasticity effect, since there is no significant crack branching. For the same specimens tested \nunder higher truncation levels, spectra S4 and S5, retardation effect is more significant which \nis mainly due to the crack branching. It can be deduced indirectly that the observed crack \nbranching phenomenon has a close relationship with the tensile overload, although it was not \nobserved immediately after the overload.  \n(4) For the 7050 L-S specimens, the stress intensity factor ranges corresponding to the peak \nstresses are high enough to cause crack branching and splitting resulting in reduced crack \ngrowth rates. With the increasing crack length, peak stress effect on SIF range is even greater, \nhence crack retardation becomes more significant. \nAcknowledgements \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n17 \nThe authors thank Ms. Hailing Tian at the Shanghai Aircraft Research Institute in China for \nproviding the specimens and load spectra used in this study.
