G. BARCLAY\nDepartment of Theology and Religion, Durham University, Abbey House,\nPalace Green, Durham DH1 3RS, UK\nInstructions given to the \u2018older\u2019 and \u2018younger\u2019 in some early Christian texts prompt\ninquiry into the rationale for this polarity and its ideological freight. Demographics\nsuggest that the adult population rarely contained more than two generations, and\ncomparative study indicates that where age was marked these categories usually\nsufficed. Their ambiguity and flexibility made them suited to ideological deploy-\nment, legitimating the power of the \u2018older\u2019. 1 Peter, 1 Clement, the Pastorals, and\nPolycarp demonstrate this phenomenon in early Christianity, with 1 Tim 4.12 and\nIgnatius Mag. 3.1 as exceptions that prove the rule. But why are age qualifications\nabsent from the authentic Paulines?\nConsiderable research has been focused in recent decades on gender dif-\nferentials in early Christianity, alongside differences in ethnicity, wealth, legal\nstatus, and social location. By contrast, very little attention has been paid to dif-\nferentials in age, despite the fact that several early Christian texts make explicit\ncomment on generational divides. The instructions in these texts, both within and\noutwith the NT, refer to \u2018the older\u2019 and \u2018the younger\u2019 in terms loaded with moral\nand political assumptions; and although such age-group relations clearly had\nstructural significance for early Christian communities, it is rarely discussed how\nthey participated in larger cultural systems of value and power. Recent discussion\nof the development of offices in the early church, including Alastair Campbell\u2019s\nbook on The Elders, has re-opened the question of the relationship between office,\nhonour, and seniority in age,1 but there is still much to be learned in this area, not\nleast from the recent outpouring of classical scholarship on the life-cycle in antiq-\n225\n1 R. A. Campbell, The Elders: Seniority within Earliest Christianity (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark,\n1994). Among other things, this succeeded in overturning the old consensus that early\nChristians took over the \u2018office\u2019 of \u2018elder\u2019 specifically from Judaism. His survey of \u2018the status\nof older people in the Graeco-Roman world\u2019 (79\u201390) is suggestive, though the focus of his\nstudy is on how the title of \u2018elder\u2019 developed within early Christian churches.\nNew Test. Stud. 53, pp. 225\u2013241. Printed in the United Kingdom \u00a9 2007 Cambridge University Press\nDOI:10.1017\/S0028688507000136\nuity and on the place of the \u2018older\u2019 generation within it.2 Given the breadth of this\ntopic, I shall confine myself to literature broadly in the Pauline tradition, but the\nresults could be relevant to those working in other fields.\nWe may start with some observations and a few simple questions. By the end\nof the first century, leaders of the Christian movement, in many of its branches,\nwere called presbuvteroi, as witnessed by texts as diverse as James (5.14), 1 Peter\n(5.1, 5), Acts (11.30; 14.23; 15.2, 4, etc.), the Pastorals (1 Tim 5.17; Titus 1.5\u20139), and, per-\nhaps, the shorter Johannine epistles (2 John 1; 3 John 1). What is more, in a range\nof texts (1 Peter; the Pastorals; 1 Clement; Polycarp Philippians), instructions are\ngiven to adult members of the church using the simple polarity of \u2018older\u2019 and\n\u2018younger\u2019 (usually presbuvteroi and newvteroi; see below). Normally in such texts\nthe comparative adjective is used, but sometimes the positive form is found (nevai\nor the noun presbu`tai; cf. Titus 2.2\u20134); in either case it is implied that, between\nthem, these labels embrace the whole adult congregation.3 What do such appar-\nently vague terms mean and why is this binary sufficient to cover everyone? How\ndid one know whether one was in the \u2018older\u2019 or \u2018younger\u2019 category? Was it possi-\n226 john m. g. barclay\n2 On the life-cycle approach, see, e.g., M. Harlow and R. Laurence, Growing Up and Growing\nOld in Ancient Rome (London: Routledge, 2002). The upsurge of interest in old age in\nWestern societies has helped spawn a new focus on the representations and realities of old\nage in both Greek and Roman antiquity. See, e.g., K. Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age in\nAncient Rome (London: Routledge, 2003); T. G. Parkin, Old Age in the Roman World: A\nCultural and Social History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 2003). On age in early\nChristianity, see C. Gnilka, \u2018Greisenalter\u2019, RAC 12:995\u20131094 and idem, Aetas Spiritualis: die\n\u00dcberwindung der nat\u00fcrlichen Altersstufen als Ideal fr\u00fchchristlichen Lebens (Bonn: Hanstein,\n1972). For bibliography (up to 1989) see E. Eyben, \u2018Old Age in Greco-Roman Antiquity and\nEarly Christianity\u2019, Old Age in Greek and Latin Literature (ed. T. M. Falkner and J. de Luce;\nAlbany, NY: SUNY, 1989) 230\u201351.\n3 The comparative presbuvteroi is used in the NT as follows: a) on its own, with reference to:\nthe \u2018elders\u2019 of the Jews (e.g., Matt 26.3); the \u2018elders\u2019 of the church (e.g., Acts 14.23; 1 Tim 5.17;\n2 John 1 [singular]; Jas 5.14); \u2018elders\u2019 as general figures of authority (e.g., Matt 15.2); the \u2018elders\u2019\nin the heavenly courtroom (e.g., Rev 4.4); b) in conjunction with newvteroi in address to con-\ngregations: 1 Pet 5.1\u20135; 1 Tim 5.1\u20132 (both male and female forms); with reference to \u2018older\u2019 and\n\u2018younger\u2019 brothers (Luke 15.12, 25); c) in conjunction with neanivskoi (Acts 2.17). The noun\npresbu`tai \/ presbuvtide~ is used in conjunction with newvteroi \/ nevai in instructions to the\nchurch (Titus 2.2\u20136), or on its own (Phlm 9, singular). The comparative newvteroi \/ newvterai\nis found sometimes in a comparative context (in contrast to presbuvteroi, Luke 15.12; 1 Pet\n5.5; 1 Tim 5.1\u20132; or simply to presbu`tai \/ presbuvtide~, Titus 2.2\u20136; or in implicit contrast\nwith the widows aged 60 and over, 1 Tim 5.11, 14; cf. John 21.18 [o{te h\\~ newvtero~ in contrast\nto o[tan ghravsh\u00db~]), but sometimes not (Acts 5.6, identical in meaning to neanivskoi, Acts\n5.10). nevai has a comparative sense, though not a comparative form, in Titus 2.4 (juxtaposed\nwith newvteroi Titus 2.6). These facts suggest that the terms \u2018young\u2019 and \u2018younger\u2019 are in\nmost contexts synonymous (as are \u2018old man\u2019 and \u2018older man\u2019); in other words, even the non-\ncomparative forms generally carry an implicit comparative sense, since such age labels are\nalmost always defined by comparison with one another.\nble to be neither, but something in between? Just as importantly, what ideological\nfreight do such terms carry \u2013 what moral and social expectations would have clus-\ntered around them, and what ideological work are they being required to perform\nin Christian texts? And if these were, as we shall see, common terms for the total-\nity of an adult population, why do we not find them within the authentic Pauline\nletters \u2013 neither the term presbuvtero~ nor indeed any reference to people\u2019s age,\nbeyond the mention of the centenarian Abraham (Rom 4.19) and Paul\u2019s reference\nto himself, in Philemon 9, as a presbuvth~?4 Is this absence of age vocabulary a\npurely accidental phenomenon, or does Paul\u2019s silence on age differentials suggest\na different social configuration, even a different theological anthropology?\n1. The Binary of \u2018The Old\u2019 and \u2018The Young\u2019\nLet us begin with some demographic facts \u2013 or at least reconstructions.5 In\nthe most recent estimates, the high rates of infant mortality put average life-\nexpectancy at birth in the range of 20\u201330 years. Of course, for those who survived\ninto their teens, the future looked better, but the number of people living beyond\nthe age of 60 was still, compared to the modern Western world, extremely low.\nAccording to estimates used by Parkin, if we set average life-expectancy at birth at\n25, and if we take a cross section of the population of the early Roman empire, we\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 227\n4 Bentley\u2019s emendation (to presbeuvth~) has been rightly dismissed by Birdsall; see J. N.\nBirdsall, \u2018presbuvth~ in Philemon 9: A Study in Conjectural Emendation\u2019, NTS 39 (1993)\n625\u201330. It is still just possible that presbuvth~ could be interpreted to mean \u2018ambassador\u2019 (so\nJ. B. Lightfoot, The Epistles of St. Paul to the Colossians, to Philemon [London: Macmillan, 5th\ned., 1880] 338\u20139; M. Barth and H. Blanke, The Letter to Philemon [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,\n2000] 321\u20133), but there is no difficulty in giving the term its normal meaning \u2018old man\u2019, which\nmakes sense as a ground for Paul\u2019s appeal and should probably be preferred (so, e.g., P.\nStuhlmacher, Der Brief an Philemon [EKK; Z\u00fcrich: Benziger, 1975] 37\u20138).\n5 The demography of ancient societies \u2013 based on the sparse record of tombstones, census\nreturns from Egypt, and the analysis of skeletons \u2013 is a precarious science, which depends in\nlarge part on the slightly fuller record of pre-industrial societies in parallel conditions; see T.\nParkin, Demography and Roman Society (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1992) and R.\nP. Saller, Patriarchy, Property and Death in the Roman Family (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity, 1994) 9\u201369. These utilise the model life tables of Coale and Demeny which assess\nage-distributions of stable populations according to varying estimates of life-expectancy at\nbirth. It is generally accepted that the closest model to the conditions of the ancient world is\nCoale-Demeny2 West Level 3 (female), with life-expectancy at birth averaged at 25; see\nParkin, Old Age, 36\u201356, 280 (table 3); Saller, Patriarchy, 22\u20135. But the field is fraught with dif-\nficulty; see the critique by W. Scheidel, \u2018Roman Age Structure: Evidence and Models\u2019, JRS 91\n(2001) 1\u201326; idem, ed., Debating Roman Demography (Leiden: Brill, 2001). Scheidel doubts the\nvalue of the Coale-Demeny models (except for highly schematic calculations of kinship\nstructures), and emphasises the likelihood of greater adult mortality (due to disease and mal-\nnutrition). The following figures may, thus, overestimate the percentage of the population\nwho lived to and beyond the age of 60.\nwould find about 60% of the population to be under the age of 30; about a third\n(33%) between the ages of 30 and 59; and only about 7% over the age of 60 (drop-\nping to 4% over the age of 65).6 Of course, some individuals are known to have\nlived into their 70s, even their 80s and 90s, but plenty of sources indicate that\npeople who died in their 60s would be considered to have lived a full life.7 If we\nthink this through in terms of generations, the results are interesting. Parkin reck-\nons that the average age of marriage for men in the Roman world was 30, for\nwomen 15.8 That would mean that by the time he reached 10, a boy would have a\nfather aged 40 and a paternal grandfather, if he was very lucky, aged 70. When the\nboy reached 20, his father would be 50, and his paternal grandfather would be\nalive only if he had survived till the age of 80. Even if we reduce the average age at\nmarriage for men to 25, the paternal grandfather would have to live to 70 to wit-\nness his grandson\u2019s twentieth birthday \u2013 only likely, as we have seen, for a tiny\npercentage of the population.9 Thus by the time a young male began to become\nsocially and politically active, he would have had, for all intents and purposes,\nonly one generation above him \u2013 even his maternal grandfather would be in the\nthin bracket of 60-year olds.10 Adult life was, for practically everyone, a two-\ngeneration phenomenon.11 To put this in other terms, there were too few people\nin the 60\u0002 age-bracket for them to constitute a socially significant age-class of\ntheir own.\n228 john m. g. barclay\n6 Parkin, Old Age, 280, Table 3; the aggregation of the relevant percentage figures at Level 3 (life\nexpectancy at birth of 25) is more precisely: 59.64%; 33.38%; and 6.98%, dropping to 4.07%\nover 65. But the precise figures give a spurious sense of accuracy, and if these tables are of\nany value at all (see previous note), they are useful only for giving a very rough sense of pos-\nsible age profiles. We should perhaps be content with a rough sense that only 5%\u20138% of the\npopulation was over the age of 60.\n7 Livy (apud Seneca Suas. 6.22) considered Cicero\u2019s death at 63 not premature, while Statius\nthought his father\u2019s death (at 65) neither early nor late (Silv. 5.3.252\u20134).\n8 Parkin, Old Age, 51\u20132. There is some evidence that in elite Roman families men may have\nmarried earlier (ca. 25). For the average age of marriage for Roman men, see R. P. Saller,\n\u2018Men\u2019s Age at Marriage and its Consequences in the Roman Family\u2019, CP 82 (1987) 20\u201335.\n9 It is possible that the marriage age for Jewish men was lower (as young as 18: see m. Aboth\n5.21 and the anecdote of the married 18 year-old in b. Ber. 28a, cited below; cf. 1QSa 1.9\u201311 [not\nbelow 20]; I am grateful to Dr. Roger Aus for advice on this point and for reference to the rab-\nbinic sources gathered in Strack-Billerbeck 2.373\u20135). But it is not clear if this was so in the\nDiaspora; and, in any case, most of the churches addressed in the texts here studied were\npredominantly Gentile.\n10 Saller\u2019s tables for senatorial families (Patriarchy, 54\u20139, Table 3.2) give precise figures using\nCoale-Demeny2 Level 3 West: only 13% of men aged 20 would have had a living grandfather\nof either sort, only 3% a living paternal grandfather.\n11 This was complicated, of course, by the different ages at marriage of men and women: a\nman\u2019s father-in-law was likely to be in the generation space between himself and his father;\nsee Harlow and Laurence, Growing Up, 92\u2013103. The point here is that there was no significant\npresence of a generation above that of his father or father-in-law.\nThis already alerts us to the fact that age-categories, in antiquity as today, are\nthe product of history and culture. While we may each count our own age in years\n(with more or less accuracy or honesty),12 the age-categories into which we place\nourselves, or are placed by others, are manifestly social constructs. In the Greek\nand Roman worlds, at puberty a boy became a \u2018youth\u2019 (neaniva~; adulescens) and\na girl, in most cases, a wife; thereafter there were no physiological transitions\nwhich demarcated the remaining course of a human life.13 In the midst of the\ngradual and constant process of ageing, stages in life, if they are marked at all,\nhave to be culturally imposed.14 In ancient narratives \u2013 histories and novels \u2013 the\nage of characters is often, in fact, unmarked; it is either unknown or irrelevant to\nthe story being told. Where it is marked, it bears some narrative significance, and\nit is striking how those individuals whose age is noted are generally labelled either\n\u2018young\u2019 or \u2018old\u2019. In Xenophon\u2019s Ephesiaca, where 15 of the 45 characters are classi-\nfied in age, all these are identified as either \u2018young\u2019 or \u2018old\u2019: \u2018young\u2019 where they are\nbeautiful, marriageable, or full of passion (e.g., 1.2: Habrocomes and Anthia; 1.13:\nCorymbus; 2.3: Manto and Rhode), and \u2018old\u2019 where they are soon to die or in\nstereotypical roles, such as the elderly tutor, the retired soldier, or the garrulous\nold woman (e.g., 1.14: Habrocomes\u2019 elderly trofeuv~; 3.9: the garrulous Chrysion;\n3.12: Araxus, the former soldier).15 There are no \u2018middle-aged\u2019 people noted here:\ntheir age would contribute nothing to the narrative or to their character profile. In\nChariton\u2019s Callirhoe, the same is true (the young hero and heroine, 1.1; the half-\ndead elderly father, 3.5; the wise elderly philosopher, 8.3) \u2013 or, rather, the one\nexception, Dionysius, proves the rule: he is introduced as a man \u2018in the prime of\nlife\u2019 (hJlikiva\u00ca kaqestwv~, 1.12.6), only so that when he falls madly in love with\nCallirhoe he chides himself for being immature, behaving like an adolescent\n(2.3\u20134). In Luke\u2013Acts the narrative profile is similar: children, \u2018youths\u2019, and \u2018old\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 229\n12 There is evidence in antiquity that individuals were likely to know their birthdays (for cele-\nbrations or astrological calculations) better than the exact year of their birth (Parkin, Old Age,\n33\u20134); it is common in epitaphs for ages to be rounded to the nearest five; see R. P. Duncan-\nJones, \u2018Age-Rounding, Illiteracy and Social Differentiation in the Roman Empire\u2019, Chiron 7\n(1977) 333\u201353.\n13 The menopause is a possible exception for women. Though it is never explicitly noted as a\nmoment of category-transition, there are some indications of changes in attitude to women\nonce they were considered infertile (Harlow and Laurence, Growing Up, 127\u20139). The rules on\nthe support of widows over 60 in 1 Tim 5.3\u201316 may be a case in point (\u2018younger widows\u2019 are\nexpected to marry and bear children, 5.11\u201315); although 60 seems a high threshold for the\nmenopause, it is not unparalleled in antiquity (Soranus Gyn. 1.6.20).\n14 The point is widely recognised in the sociology and anthropology of ageing. For a study of\nAfrican social systems, in which physiological and \u2018structural\u2019 age are clearly distinct phe-\nnomena, see B. Bernardi, Age Class Systems: Social Institutions and Politics Based on Age\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1985).\n15 I am grateful to Professor Tomas H\u00e4gg for pointing me to the Greek novels for evidence of the\nmarking, or non-marking, of age.\npeople\u2019 are noted, very occasionally with their exact age (e.g., Anna: Luke 2.36\u20137);\nbut most people remain unmarked in age.16 Not everyone has to be put into an age\nbracket, but when they are, the terms \u2018young\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019 are the ones most fre-\nquently used and most culturally significant.\nThis conclusion is largely corroborated elsewhere. Certain specialised dis-\ncourses might divide the lifespan into precise units, or mark exact age for the sake\nof legal entitlement or obligation. Medical and astronomical calculations, for\ninstance, might divide a life into 7-year or 9-year units;17 enrolment in the army\noperated with lower and upper age-limits;18 taxation sometimes operated in age-\nbands, deftly manipulated by the tax-payers;19 and for the holding of political\noffice an age-qualification might be legislated, and an upper limit (for \u2018retire-\nment\u2019) discussed, though not necessarily applied.20 But outside these special\narenas, and, it seems, for most spheres of ordinary life, a simple binary was suffi-\ncient: after childhood and a loosely defined \u2018youth\u2019 (for men until their mid-20s),\nthe free population (both male and female) was divided into two categories, the\n\u2018young(er)\u2019 and \u2018old(er)\u2019, with no clearly defined boundary between them, or\nrather, only such demarcation as fitted the rhetorical or political interests of those\nwho created it.21\n230 john m. g. barclay\n16 How old were Joseph, Herod, Pilate, Stephen, Barnabas, Philip? The question is of no inter-\nest to Luke. The advanced ages of Zechariah and Elizabeth (Luke 1.7, 18, 36) are important to\nthe narrative, as is the youthfulness of the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7.12\u201314) and of the\nboy Jesus (Luke 2.42). Anna\u2019s great age (2.36\u20137), with her long period of widowhood, demon-\nstrates her purity in reception of prophecy; the age of the lame man healed by Peter and John\nindicates how miraculous is his healing (Acts 4.23). It is not entirely clear why Luke marks the\nage of Jesus as \u2018about 30\u2019 at the start of his ministry (Luke 3.23); there may be echoes of\nJoseph (Gen 41.46) or David (2 Sam 5.4), or an allusion to the age of Moses (32) \u2018when he\nbegan to instruct Israel in Egypt\u2019 (Num. Rab. Naso 14.18 on Num 7.85 [suggested to me by Dr.\nAus]; but cf. Exod. Rab. 1.27, 30).\n17 E.g., Hippocrates\u2019 seven ages of humankind (apud Philo Opif. 105, with a 21-year period for\nthe age of \u2018manhood\u2019 [ajnhvr]); on similar divisions see Parkin, Old Age, 16\u201319, noting their\nmarginal significance.\n18 Aulus Gellius Noct. Att. 10.28, recording Roman practice (enrolment at 17; entering the status\nof seniores at 46).\n19 For the evidence from Roman Egypt regarding liturgy-obligations and the poll tax, see\nParkin, Old Age, 138\u201372.\n20 For the rules and their application regarding the Roman senate, see Parkin, Old Age, 96\u2013128.\n21 Thus, although Philo knows Hippocrates\u2019 scheme (Opif. 105), he generally refers to the adult\npopulation in these two categories (see below). It is therefore mistaken to assume that one\nmay use Hippocrates\u2019 (or others\u2019) life-stage schemas as means to determine precisely when\nPaul or others could classify themselves as \u2018old\u2019 (pace J. Murphy-O\u2019Connor, Paul: A Critical\nLife [Oxford: Oxford University, 1996] 1\u20134, on Phlm 9). Slaves can also be marked in literature\nas both old and young, though in a social sense they have the marginal status of a \u2018child\u2019\n(pai`~); see T. Wiedemann, \u2018Servi senes: The Role of Old Slaves at Rome\u2019, Polis 8 (1996) 275\u201393.\nIt may strike us as odd that there are only these two categories: it was very rare\nfor either Greeks or Romans to talk of a \u2018middle age\u2019 of mature adulthood before\none became \u2018old\u2019.22 Aristotle did advance something like this notion, but only\nbecause he wanted to define a golden mean between the excesses of youth, on the\none hand, and the miseries of old age, on the other (Rhet. 2.12\u201314\n[1388b31\u20131390b13]). In the course of this definition Aristotle distinguishes between\nthe maturity of the body (at the age of 30\u201335) and the maturity of the soul (at the\nage of 49); but using two different ages in the definition of \u2018maturity\u2019 (ajkmhv) makes\nthe schema practically unworkable.23 Elsewhere adult society was divided, in a\nneat polarity, into \u2018the young\u2019 and \u2018the old\u2019, with \u2018old\u2019 (or \u2018older\u2019) applicable to\nparents or senior politicians in their 40s and 50s as well as to the tiny percentage\nof those who lived into their 60s or beyond. Occasionally the term senium is used\nby Roman authors, in distinction from senectus, to describe what we might term\n\u2018senility\u2019.24 But in general when our texts talk about \u2018the old\u2019 or \u2018the older\u2019, we\nshould resist thinking of those considered in the West (until recently) \u2018of retire-\nment age\u2019; the term could apply to anyone distinguishable from a younger gener-\nation.25\nThe categories are interestingly flexible and uncertain. When did men or\nwomen become \u2018old\u2019? Only when the next generation so defined them, or when it\nsuited the \u2018older\u2019 to categorise themselves in this way.26 According to Xenophon\n(Mem. 1.2.35), when Socrates was accused of corrupting \u2018the young\u2019, he had to ask\nhis critics who counted as \u2018young\u2019 (nevoi); anyone, he was told, not yet wise\nenough to serve on the Council (boulhv), that is anyone under the age of 30. The\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 231\n22 On Greek usage of just these two categories, see R. Garland, The Greek Way of Life (London:\nDuckworth, 1990) 205\u20136, 242\u20133.\n23 Aristotle\u2019s categories are neovth~, ajkmhv and gh`ra~. The young are over-passionate, over-\nheated, and na\u00efve; the old are cold, suspicious, cowardly, and mean; in between, by the prin-\nciple of mhde;n a[gan, are those \u2018in their prime\u2019. But the contrasts are artificially schematic,\nand the paucity of comment on \u2018middle age\u2019 (beyond its falling between the opposite\nextremes) suggests it was a category of limited value. Artemidorus sometimes uses a four-age\nscheme (child; youth; grown man [ajnhvr]; old man, 1.50; cf. 2.44; 4.10), but not always (cf. 1.78),\nand it is striking that the third category (ajnhvr) does not itself signify age. Terms for middle\nage (constans aetas; aetas virilis; medium tempus) are notably rare in Latin, even when the\nlifespan is divided into four or more stages; see E. Eyben, \u2018Die Einteilung des menschlichen\nLebens im r\u00f6mishen Altertum\u2019, Rheinisches Museum 116 (1973) 150\u201390; Parkin, Old Age, 21\u20132.\n24 T. G. Parkin, \u2018Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Elderly Members of the Roman Family\u2019, The Roman\nFamily in Italy (ed. B. Rawson and P. Weaver; Oxford: Clarendon, 1997) 123\u201348, esp. 141\u20138.\n25 This is true even of the Latin term senex: as Parkin insists, \u2018one cannot and should not define\ngeneral terms like senex by a minimum number of years\u2019 (Old Age, 25); on the distinction in\nRoman law between minores and maiores see idem, Old Age, 93\u20135.\n26 According to Livy (30.30.10\u201311), Hannibal at the age of 44 called himself a senex in contrast to\nthe adulescentia of Scipio (aged 34); but Cicero, looking back, can call himself at the time of\nthe Catalinarian conspiracy (when he was 44) an adulescens (Phil. 2.46.118).\nfact that he had to ask the question shows that the term was ill-defined, and it is\nthis very lack of definition, together with the neat polarity of the two opposing cat-\negories, young and old, that makes these labels so rhetorically useful. Precisely\nbecause they were ambiguous, such terms were malleable and could be put to all\nkinds of prejudicial use. And that leads us to enquire into the politics of these cat-\negories: if \u2018older\u2019 and \u2018younger\u2019 do not have a precise physiological sense, but are\nnonetheless in frequent use, what ideologies are they being made to serve?\n2. Ideologies of Age\nIn antiquity, as today, youth and age carried their own particular stereo-\ntypes, both positive and negative. Old age is notoriously easy to ridicule. The stock\nimage of the decrepit old man, deaf and losing his memory, with tottering limbs,\nbald head, and drivelling nose \u2013 or the old woman, bent over, wrinkled, and with\ntoothless gums \u2013 is common in literature and art (most memorably in\nAristophanes\u2019 plays and Juvenal\u2019s Satire 10.188\u2013288).27 Besides these physical\ntraits, the older generation are often depicted as long-winded, opinionated, carp-\ning, slow-witted, miserly, and ridiculous when they pursue love-affairs.28 The old\nor older, of course, see things differently: from their perspective \u2013 and this is a\nnotion ubiquitous in the ancient world \u2013 with age come prudence, moderation,\nand the wisdom of experience.29 The young, who can be portrayed in certain con-\ntexts as vigorous, beautiful, and bursting with sex-appeal, can also be viewed, by\nthe older, as wilful, greedy, ambitious, sex-crazed, and emotionally unstable. And\nbecause the population divides into two groups, one can charge men even in their\n30s with the immaturity and indiscretions of \u2018youth\u2019, or conversely, label a 45-year\nold a senex, and load against him all the associated negative connotations.\nSuch stereotypes are not socially or politically innocent: they enter into the\nstructuring of power, providing rationalisations for its unequal distribution across\nthe generations. In the domestic sphere, the appeal for the young to respect their\nelders is as common as, and frequently tied to, the expectation that children obey\ntheir parents. Summarising the Jewish law, but in line with all ancient moralists,\nJosephus twins the honouring of parents with the instruction that the young\nshould honour everyone who is older (pa`~ oJ presbuvtero~), \u2018since God is oldest\u2019\n232 john m. g. barclay\n27 On the latter, with literary parallels, see Parkin, Old Age, 80\u20136. On the depiction of the old in\nstatuary, see Cokayne, Experiencing, 11\u201333; with the Roman fashion for \u2018verism\u2019, the wrinkled\nface of an older man can become a symbol of dignity, solemnity, and authority.\n28 See Parkin, Old Age, 76\u201389; the last case signifies the sense that each age has its own proper\npattern of behaviour.\n29 The topos of the wise old counsellor is familiar in Greek literature from Homer onwards; for\nexamples, see Parkin, Old Age, 335 n. 18, to which add Sir 25.4\u20136 among other examples in the\nJewish tradition.\n(Apion 2.206).30 For Philo there is an obvious symmetry in the hierarchical rela-\ntionships which demand respect (Spec. 2.224\u201341): between children and parents,\njuniors and elders, pupils and teachers, beneficiaries and benefactors, subjects\nand rulers, slaves and masters. The parallel with parents is particularly stressed: to\ndisrespect an older man or woman would be an indirect, but gross, dishonour to\none\u2019s parents (Spec. 2.237\u20138). More generally, Philo links older age with wisdom,\nvirtue, maturity, and reason, while the youth (nevoi) are an inherently dangerous\nphenomenon, associated with upheaval and revolution (newteropoiiva; new-\nterivzein, Sob. 6\u201329).31 Such political terms alert us to the cross-over between the\nhousehold and the state. In politics, the division between the two generations, the\nold and the young, is as old as Homer, whose portrait of the wise (but garrulous)\nold Nestor constituted a stock figure (Il. 1.247\u201351; 2.369\u201372, etc.). The famous\nAthenian debate on the Sicilian Expedition (Thucydides Hist. 6.8\u201323) is turned by\nNikias into a contest between the older and wiser generation (the geraivteroi or\npresbuvteroi led by himself, against the young, headstrong, and madly ambitious\nyoungsters (nevoi, led by Alcibiades, aged 35); needless to say, the political victory\nof the young led to military disaster. The ideological ramifications of age are\nspelled out even more clearly in Plutarch\u2019s treatise \u2018Whether an old man should\nengage in public affairs\u2019 (Mor. 783b\u2013797f). Here Plutarch argues than an older\npolitician should not \u2018retire\u2019 from public life (all the alternatives are dishon-\nourable and \u2018womanish\u2019), but should continue to offer to the rest of society, and\nparticularly to the young, the benefits of their superior experience, prudence, and\nwisdom. The young may be physically stronger, but they are addicted to honour,\nto competition, and to show, and are ruled by strong impulses (790c\u2013d). The\nolder, by contrast, have an established advantage in experience and thus in good\nsense (frontiv~); they are by definition oiJ nou`n e[conte~ (788a\u2013e; 789d; 797e). And\nthis distinction makes the power differential wholly natural: it is of the essence of\nyouth to obey, of old age to rule (peiqarciko;n hJ neovth~, hJgemoniko;n de; to; gh`ra~,\n789e).32\nThe philosophical discussion of this topic is equally revealing. Cicero\u2019s famous\ntreatise De Senectute carefully counters four arguments that old age is an unhappy\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 233\n30 For discussion, see my Flavius Josephus, Translation and Commentary. Vol. 10. Against Apion\n(Leiden: Brill, 2006) ad loc. Elsewhere, Josephus\u2019 narrative assumes that the young are lower\nin ajxiva and thus take lower places at the table (Ant. 12.210); the same assumption is present\nin Luke 22.26 (the newvtero~ is normally in the humble role of the diakonw`n). Cf. Sir 32.3\u20139\non the right to speak at banquets.\n31 According to Philo, the Essenes do not admit young men, \u2018since the character of such are\nunstable with a waywardness corresponding to the immaturity of their age\u2019 (Hypoth. 11.3);\nthey sit in rows in their synagogues, the younger below the older (Prob. 81). Cf. the ideal com-\nmunity of the Therapeutae, where the younger members serve the older (Contempl. 70\u20132).\n32 Plato would have strongly approved: he takes it for granted that the \u2018older\u2019 will rule the\n\u2018younger\u2019 in any just political system (Resp. 412c, 465a; Leg. 659d, 690a).\nand burdensome period of life (namely, that it removes us from active pursuits;\nthat it weakens our bodies; that is deprives us of almost every pleasure; and that it\nbrings us nearer to death). Cicero (through his mouthpiece Cato) will not allow\nany of these claims to devalue old age: they are either half truths or, from the per-\nspective of philosophy, describe conditions which are positively advantageous \u2013\nafter all, with the passions dimmed, there is more room for virtue! Although\nCicero knows the stereotype of old men as morose and irascible (Sen. 65), he dis-\nputes its universal application. More positively, he associates old age with auc-\ntoritas, consilium, and sententia (Sen. 17). Busy in their own (more intellectual)\nways, old men can offer the young wisdom and good sense, a maturitas (Sen. 33)\nlike that of ripe fruits on a tree, just before they fall (Sen. 5, 71).33 Sometimes in this\ntreatise (written age 62), Cicero deploys a four-age schema of \u2018boyhood\u2019 (pueritia),\n\u2018youth\u2019 (adulescentia), \u2018settled age\u2019 (aetas constans or media), and \u2018old age\u2019 (senec-\ntus; e.g., Sen. 33, 76) but generally this resolves to a simpler scheme of \u2018young\u2019 and\n\u2018old\u2019, in which the wisdom of age can be contrasted to the immaturity and wild\nvoluptates of youth (Sen. 17\u201326, 39\u201350).34 For a Stoic, or indeed anyone in a philo-\nsophical tradition where mind is valued over body, older age provides the perfect\nconditions for the full display of virtue; it is a period not of decline but of ever\ngreater moral development.\nWe should note here the ideological work of such texts (\u2018ideological\u2019 in the\nstrong sense of sustaining asymmetrical relations of power): age and youth are\ncarefully defined to maintain the status quo as both natural and morally neces-\nsary. In the simple polarity of \u2018younger\u2019 and \u2018older\u2019, an older man can never be\nclassed as \u2018too old\u2019; if there is no final category of \u2018senile\u2019 into which to decline, the\n\u2018old\u2019 can continue to compare themselves advantageously with the \u2018young\u2019 for as\nlong as it suits them to do so. The right of the older to rule is vigorously asserted:\nthat is the reward (gevra~) that goes with old age (gh`ra~, Plutarch Mor. 789f). I am\nnot claiming that this is the perspective of everyone in the Roman world: the fact\nthat the philosophers have to work to extol the benefits of age indicates that the\nsubject is contestable and contested.35 But it is clear that where age, however\n234 john m. g. barclay\n33 As one might expect, little positive attention is given by Cicero or other ancient authors to\nolder women, who are quite frequently (though unflatteringly) depicted in statuary. The old\nwoman still desperate for sex, or addicted to drink, is a common object of scorn or satire; see\nO. Musso, \u2018Anus ebria\u2019, Atene e Roma 13 (1968) 29\u201331; Cokayne, Experiencing, 134\u201352.\n34 In the same vein, Seneca admits only a simple bipolarity: \u2018youth\u2019 (adulescentia, sometimes\ntwinned with pueritia) and \u2018seniority\u2019 (senectus). The latter is the time when the mind is at its\nfull bloom (Ep. 26.2), when the apple is perfectly ripe (Ep. 12.4). Although the body may be\ncomparatively weak, so are its vices, while the mind enjoys tranquillitas and modestia (Ep.\n26.3).\n35 There are certainly cases in antiquity where those considered \u2018too old\u2019 are dismissed as\n\u2018stupid\u2019 or \u2018useless\u2019; see e.g., Josephus Ant. 12.172\u20133; Thucydides Hist. 2.44.4. In CD 10.4\u201310 the\noffice of judge is removed from anyone over the age of 60, \u2018for on account of man\u2019s sin his\nloosely defined, becomes a criterion for power \u2013 and there is good evidence that\nin the political sphere most men in power were definable as \u2018older,\u2019 that is, in their\n40s and 50s36 \u2013 it has developed a structural significance which requires continual\nlegitimation and reinforcement. Since age could be used as a mechanism for the\ndistribution, and eventual rotation, of power, discourse about it is by no means\npolitically innocent; we should expect its presence or absence in early Christian\ntexts to be similarly significant.\n3. Age Instructions in the Pauline Tradition\nSpace does not permit more than a survey of four texts which lie broadly in\nthe Pauline tradition. They are strikingly similar in their assumptions and ideolo-\ngies of age, illuminated by the context we have just set.\ni) 1 Peter\nDespite its language about charismatic endowment (1 Pet 4.7\u201311), the open-\ning verses of 1 Pet 5 indicate that respect is due to age in the Christian community.\nIt is presbuvteroi who are exhorted to \u2018shepherd\u2019 the flock, and not from greed\n(5.2).37 Even if the term presbuvtero~ refers to an \u2018office\u2019, it is clear that only \u2018older\u2019\npeople are expected to wield this authority, for the corresponding injunction is to\n\u2018the younger\u2019 (newvteroi, 5.5) \u2013 which is not a junior \u2018office\u2019, but an age-category,\nthe younger people in the churches.38 They are issued with one simple instruction:\nuJpotavghte presbutevroi~ (5.5); as normal, youth defers to age. The unequal dis-\ntribution of power is hardly qualified by the following instruction that all should\nshow humility to one another; in terms of \u2018submission\u2019 there is no ethos of reci-\nprocity. What we find here is precisely what we noted in the ideologically driven\nliterature: vagueness in definition of the categories \u2018older\u2019 and \u2018younger\u2019, accom-\npanied by the firm smack of order.\nii) 1 Clement\nClement\u2019s letter to Corinth displays the outrage caused when this proper\nhierarchy is not observed. Although the details are unclear, it appears that there\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 235\ndays were shortened, and because of God\u2019s wrath against the inhabitants of the earth, he\ndecided to remove knowledge from them before they completed their days\u2019; cf. CD 14.6\u201311;\n1QSa 2.7 (the tottering aged are excluded from the congregation).\n36 Parkin, Old Age, 100: \u2018we might say as a generalization that most power (as opposed to less\ntangible respect) lay not with those over the age of 60, but with those in their 40s and 50s.\u2019\n37 On the avarice or meanness of the older generation, see above, n. 28.\n38 See discussion by E. G. Selwyn, The First Epistle of St. Peter (London: Macmillan, 1955), 227,\n233; N. Brox, Der Erste Petrusbrief (Z\u00fcrich: Benziger, 1979) 226\u20137, 233\u20135. The latter argues that\npresbuvteroi both in 5.1 and 5.5 means \u2018elders\u2019 (as an office); but even if so, the age conno-\ntations of the term are clear in the contrast of 5.5.\nhas been some \u2018revolt\u2019 (stavsi~) against the presbuvteroi (47.6); whether this\ncomes from within their ranks, or from outside, the strategy of Clement through-\nout is to reinforce the authority of the duly constituted \u2018elders\u2019 (oiJ kaqestamevnoi\npresbuvteroi, 54.2).39 One means to this end is to construct a chain of contrasts,\neach shocking in its implication that order has been overturned: the factionalism\nthat has broken out in Corinth is conducted by the a[timoi against the e[ntimoi, the\na[doxoi against the e[ndoxoi, the a[frone~ against the frovnimoi, and the nevoi\nagainst the presbuvteroi (3.3). Although these four antitheses are not precise\nequivalents, the associations are telling: the \u2018young\u2019 are classed alongside the \u2018dis-\nreputable\u2019 and the \u2018senseless\u2019 \u2013 presumably because they lack the age-entitlement\nto honour and wisdom.40 A second tactic is to reinforce obedience to the \u2018elders\u2019\nby placing them in a network of relationships requiring proper submission to the\nkavnwn uJpotavgh~ (1.3). Thus in 1 Clement 1 the Corinthians are praised for their pre-\nvious orderly conduct, and in 1 Clement 21 exhorted, in very similar terms, to\nrenew this order. In both cases obeying their leaders and \u2018paying proper honour\u2019\n(timh; hJ kaqhvkousa) to their \u2018elders\u2019 is juxtaposed with expectations that the\nyoung (nevoi) are taught to \u2018think moderate and respectful thoughts\u2019 (mevtria kai;\nsemna; noei`n, 1.3), and are instructed in the discipline of the Lord (21.6). The hier-\narchical relationship between \u2018the older\u2019 and \u2018the young\u2019 is closely allied to that\npresupposed in the family, with the normal assumption that the young tend to\nexcessive and irresponsible behaviour.41 It is not quite clear here whether the\npresbuvteroi represent an informal age-group or a formal office.42 But that suits\nClement\u2019s rhetoric well: respect for the office of \u2018elder\u2019 is boosted by its associa-\ntion with \u2018old age\u2019, while respect for the older members of the congregation is\nboosted by their association in nomenclature with the emerging office of \u2018elder\u2019.\nIn either case, age proves if not a prerequisite at least a distinct advantage for\naspiring leaders in communities who share Clement\u2019s ideology.\niii) The Pastorals\nA similar set of assumptions, and rhetorics, is to be found in the Pastoral\nepistles. There is the same ambiguity about the label presbuvteroi, which in some\ncases seems to designate an age-group (1 Tim 5.1\u20132; cf.

The term may be\nin transition, or the subject of subtle political redescription;43 but all its uses build\nupon the special respect accorded to age. Titus 2.1\u20135 represents many of the clas-\nsic cultural assumptions about age. Older men (presbu`tai) are to be sober, seri-\nous, and moderate \u2013 the virtues one would expect in those who have left behind\nwhat the Pastor elsewhere terms \u2018youthful passions\u2019 (newterikai; ejpiqumivai, 2\nTim 2.22). Older women are to control their tongues and their appetite for drink.44\nSuch women, however, have a crucial role to play in socialising the younger gen-\neration of wives (aiJ nevai) into the proper family ethos, to ensure that they are\ndomestic, motherly, and obedient to their husbands (Titus 2.4\u20135). Younger men\n(newvteroi) are to be moderate in everything (swfronei`n peri; pavnta), learning to\nshed youthful excess so they are fit to be, in turn, the wise older generation. In 1\nTimothy, where the addressee is presented as young (4.12; see below), care is to be\ntaken as to how the older generation are exhorted and corrected. Just as slaves are\nnot to be insolent to their Christian masters (1 Tim 6.1\u20132), so older men must not\nbe rudely rebuked (presbutevrw\/ mh; ejpiplhvxh\u00db~), but exhorted \u2018as fathers\u2019 (1 Tim\n5.1), older women \u2018as mothers\u2019, and the younger generation (newtevrou~ and\nnewtevra~) as brothers and sisters. Again, we note, there are only two categories\n(older and younger), no \u2018middle aged\u2019. And the family metaphor is significant:45 it\nindicates that in a community which thinks of itself as \u2018the household of God\u2019 (1\nTim 3.15), the patterns of respect for the older generation in the family are likely to\nbe replicated in social relations within the church.\niv) Polycarp\nIn his letter to the Philippians, Polycarp includes a number of comments\nabout the generational divide which tally precisely with what we have discovered\nthus far, but add a further moral tone. In Phil. 5\u20136 he first instructs the \u2018younger\nmen\u2019 (newvteroi) to exercise self-control. The dangers here are \u2018impurity\u2019 and \u2018the\ndesires of the world\u2019, and, considering what was generally believed about young\nmen\u2019s libido, it is not surprising that the following list of vices \u2013 a shortened ver-\nsion of 1 Cor 6.9\u201311 \u2013 is entirely focused on sexual misdemeanour. To avoid this, or\nany other such \u2018aberrant behaviour\u2019 (a[topa), the young must be subject to \u2018the\nelders and deacons\u2019 (toi`~ presbutevroi~ kai; diakovnoi~), as to God and Christ;\none could hardly devise a stronger legitimation of the authority of the leaders,\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 237\n43 See F. Young, The Theology of the Pastoral Epistles (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1994)\n104\u201311; Campbell, Elders, 176\u2013205; I. H.

Meanwhile, the \u2018elders\u2019,\nwho have the power to correct and care for the rest of the congregation, are\nwarned to avoid the usual vices of age \u2013 the tendency to be cantankerous and\nmoney-grabbing (6.1; cf. 11.1\u20134). Rather, they are to be merciful, generous, unprej-\nudiced, free from anger, and mild in their judgement of others. We have the\nimpression of a community where leadership is more or less neatly aligned with\nage, and where the younger generation will have to prove their ability to \u2018rein\nthemselves in\u2019 (5.3) over a protracted period before they, in turn, can fill the role\nof \u2018elders\u2019.\n4. Two Exceptions that Prove the Rule\nLest the picture appear over-simple, we should note two passages which\nsuggest that, on occasion, leaders in the churches might be comparatively young.\nIn both cases it is clear that this is problematic and exceptional, and words are\ncarefully chosen to validate this unusual phenomenon. The fact that it happens at\nall indicates that early Christian practice did not always match its age-presump-\ntions; but the justification provided for these exceptions proves that they did little\nto disrupt the normal assumptions concerning the authority of age.\nIn the first of these texts, 1 Tim 4.12, instruction is given to \u2018Timothy\u2019 not to let\nanyone \u2018despise\u2019 him because of his youth (mhdei;~ sou th`~ neovthto~\nkatafroneivtw). The notice may go back to early memory of Timothy, or serve as\nan interpretation of Pauline fears on his behalf (1 Cor 16.11; cf. Titus 2.15). In this\npseudonymous letter, such a fictionalised instruction has been taken by Brox to\nsuggest that young leaders were not untypical in the circles addressed by the\nPastorals.46 To counteract this disadvantage, Timothy must make himself an\n\u2018example\u2019 to others (examples are normally expected in the older generation),\nand, as we have seen, he must be specially careful to address older men and\nwomen with respect (5.1\u20132). He is also reminded of the cavrisma which was given\nto him through prophecy (4.14) \u2013 but given through the laying on of hands by the\ncouncil of elders (to; presbutevrion)! In other words, Timothy\u2019s youthful authority\nis not an example of \u2018charisma\u2019 which escapes or challenges the \u2018traditional\u2019\nauthority of the older generation. What at first sight appears to circumvent the\ndue process of age-qualification turns out to be authentic, and authenticated,\nonly when the elders have appointed him to his task. That they might appoint\nsuch a young person indicates that age is not a sine qua non for leadership in such\n238 john m. g. barclay\n46 N. Brox, Die Pastoralbriefe (Regensburg: Pustet, 4th ed., 1969) 178\u20139; cf. J. Roloff, Der Erste\nBrief an Timotheus (EKK; Z\u00fcrich: Benziger, 1988) 251; but the inference is not wholly secure.\nCf. N. Brox, \u2018Pseudo-Paulus und Pseudo-Ignatius. Einige Topoi altchristlicher\nPseudepigraphie\u2019, VC 30 (1976) 181\u20138.\nchurches; but in the context of the Pastorals as a whole, this disregard of the age\ncriterion is clearly an exception.\nOur second text offers a real case of a youthful leader, in the role of overseer\n(ejpivskopo~). In his letter to the Magnesians (3.1), Ignatius urges the church not to\ntake advantage of Damas because of his age: they are to accord him all proper\nrespect (as if he were \u2018old\u2019), as even the \u2018holy elders\u2019 have done (overriding their\nnatural scorn of the young). The crucial justification for this unusual phenome-\nnon is then presented: his youthful status\/condition (newterikh; tavxi~) is only an\noutward appearance (fainomevnh),47 and the elders, seeing through this deceptive\nexterior, have honoured Damas \u2018as one who is wise in God\u2019 (wJ~ fronivmw\/ ejn qew`\/).48\nWisdom is, of course, precisely what one would not expect in a young man, but\nwould naturally associate with the old, and it is Damas\u2019 \u2018wisdom in God\u2019 which\nequips him to play his unusual role. Heavy sanctions are added: one must defer to\nDamas as if to God, and not with hypocrisy, for that would be detected by the\ndivine ejpivskopo~ (3.2). One has the impression that Damas\u2019 job would have been\na lot easier if his hair had been that little bit greyer and his brow a little more wrin-\nkled.49\n5. The Silence of Paul\nFinally, we may return to our question about Paul. Is it significant that, in\ncomparison with these later texts written in his name or in his tradition, and\ndespite the depiction in Acts (14.23), Paul did not appoint presbuvteroi in his\nchurches? Leadership was indeed appointed, or at least emerged (1 Thess 5.12\u201313;\n1 Cor 16.15\u201316; Phil 1.1), but it was not characterised by terms depicting age. Age dif-\nferentials are not included in the formula of Gal 3.28, alongside the nullified labels\nof ethnicity, gender, and legal status; but are they implicitly ignored in Pauline\nanthropology?\nAs always, silence can be interpreted in more than one way. We might con-\nclude that Paul really thought no differently from everyone else on this matter. As\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 239\n47 For the translation of tavxi~ see J. B.

Ehrman, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. 1 (LCL; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 2003)\n244. For the notion of a young man as wise as an elder, cf. Susanna 44\u201350 (Theodotion),\nregarding Daniel; Apostolic Constitutions 2.1 (a man under 50 may be appointed bishop \u2018if he\nhas behaved from his youth like a much older person\u2019).\n49 I am grateful to Dr. Joel Kaminsky for pointing me to an apposite anecdote in the Babylonian\nTalmud. When Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaraiah was only 18 years old he was appointed head of\nthe Sanhedrin and there was concern that the masses would not respect him because of his\nyouthful appearance; so a miracle occurred and his beard turned white overnight (b. Ber.\n28a).\nwe have seen, one did not have to speak of people\u2019s ages in every context (age\noften goes unmarked), but the fact that Paul did once pull rank, or evoke pity, as\na presbuvth~ (Phlm 9) might suggest that he associated authority with age.50 His\nappeal to his converts to think no longer as paidiva but as tevleioi (1 Cor 14.20; cf.\n1 Cor 2.6; 13.11; Phil 3.12\u201315; Col 1.28; 4.12) could be taken to indicate that he linked\nChristian maturation to experience and age. Moreover, it has been argued that in\nchurches founded by Paul leadership would naturally gravitate to householders\nand hosts, and thus to the paterfamilias or equivalent \u2013 in any case (given the\nimportance of age in the domestic context) to the oldest generation.51\nOn the other hand, there are both sociological and theological indications of a\nquite contrary conclusion. As a first-generation conversionist sect, the Pauline\nmovement could hardly afford to limit leadership to an older generation (there\nmight be few among the converts in any particular place), and its charismatic fea-\ntures could break with the traditional structures of authority associated with age.\nJust as Luke, citing Joel, can imagine both young men seeing visions and old men\ndreaming dreams (Acts 2.17), spiritual gifts in Pauline theology are not distributed\nby age. There is no indication that prophecy or teaching, or even apostleship,\nmust be in the hands of the older generation (1 Cor 12\u201314), and this not by acci-\ndental omission but because the structures of power in the Pauline churches\nescape both legal and traditional frameworks.52 Theologically, one may relate this\nto the emergence in Paul of an alternative, apocalyptic anthropology. If the\nwisdom of the world is made foolish by the message of the cross, and if the form\nof this world is passing away (1 Cor 1.18; 7.31), one can hardly expect the normal\nassociations between age, wisdom, and authority to remain intact. In the kainh;\nktivsi~ (Gal 6.15; 2 Cor 5.17) the believer is reconstituted by dependence on the\nSpirit, who is the source of wisdom and of the moral qualities that constitute\ngrowth in Christ. It is not clear that an older person must be necessarily wiser \u2018in\nChrist\u2019, and if a believer goes astray, it is the pneumatikoiv who are to correct him,\nnot the presbuvteroi (Gal 6.1). Experience of life in \u2018the present evil age\u2019 (Gal 1.4)\ncan hardly qualify one for leadership in the emerging new creation, while the gifts\n240 john m. g. barclay\n50 Cf. the presumption that the first-born son (Jesus) has a higher rank than his brothers (Rom\n8.29); as father (or mother) of his churches, Paul assumes authority over them (e.g., 1 Cor\n4.14\u201315), but this lies more in his parentage than in his superior \u2018age\u2019.\n51 So Campbell, Elders, 97\u2013140, arguing that \u2018elder\u2019 (a general term of honour) does not emerge\nin Pauline times, since each church had its own leader. It emerges only later when churches\nare collectively represented by groups of leaders, called elders. But it is still unclear whether\nPaul would have accepted an age-term as a label of leadership.\n52 The issue is more complex than can be discussed here; see B. Holmberg, Paul and Power: The\nStructure of Authority in the Primitive Church as Reflected in the Pauline Epistles (Lund:\nGleerup, 1978).\nand fruits of the Spirit are acquired not by the passage of time but by the distribu-\ntion of grace.\nThus, from related sociological and theological angles, it is possible to find\ntraces in Paul of an alternative ideology, challenging the structuring assumptions\nof Roman society. But if so, one can understand why this did not last. As soon as\ntime began to pass, and converts could be expected to mature in the faith, the typ-\nical links between seniority, experience, and wisdom would naturally emerge. If\nChristians conceived of themselves as \u2018growing into salvation\u2019 (1 Pet 2.2), they\ncould plot a path of increasing spiritual maturation through the life-cycle; and via\nthe normal processes of routinisation, leadership would be largely restricted to\nthose qualified by their social standing, domestic or otherwise. Thus in time \u2018the\nyoung\u2019 are told to knuckle down and respect their \u2018elders\u2019. But, arguably, there\nremains within the Christian tradition a trace of an earlier, alternative, vision of a\nsocial structure that is Spirit-led and age-blind.53\nThere is Neither Old Nor Young? 241\n53 Gnilka traces in subsequent Christian literature the discussion of \u2018age\u2019 as a spiritual, rather\nthan a physical, phenomenon, and thus the capacity to recognise the spiritual maturity of\nthe young. This discourse has its roots more in philosophy (e.g., the topos of the puer senex)\nthan in charismatic freedom, but the exception texts noted above (1 Tim 4.12; Ignatius Mag.\n3.1) played their part in this discussion (Aetas Spiritualis, 170\u20133, 244).\n"}
