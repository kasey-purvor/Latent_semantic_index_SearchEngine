Possibilities and challenges \n \nParvati Raghuram\n1\n and Clare Madge\n2 \n1\nDepartment of Geography, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK \n2\nDepartment of Geography, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK \n \nCorrespondence: Parvati Raghuram (email: P.Raghuram@open.ac.uk) \n \nIn this paper we explore the contours of a \u201emethod\u201f for postcolonial development geography, \nwhich makes it possible to imagine another \u201eworld-picturing\u201f. We suggest three steps towards \nsuch a method. First, we propose that a postcolonial method involves thinking about why we are \ndoing research in the south in the first place; how we come to and produce our questions; and how we \nanalyze and represent our findings based on our subject positionings. Second, that we need to \nrecognize theorization as an inherent part of method, rethink how we currently theorize and \nreconfigure our methods of theorization to address wider political aims. Problematizing \ntheorization helps challenge the universalism of Eurocentric theories, thus enabling development \ngeography to move towards more decolonized versions and visions. Finally, that this must be \naccompanied by firmer recognition of our multiple investments \u2013 personal, institutional and \ngeopolitical \u2013 and how they frame the possibilities for change. These are some possible steps that \nwe think can reconfigure the 'scholarly track' that postcolonial development geographers traverse.  \n \nKeywords: development geography, postcolonial, method, dialogue, theory, British neoliberal \nacademy \n \nIntroduction \nIn this paper we explore the possibility of a \u201emethod\u201f for postcolonial development geography.1 \nRecently there has been increasing interest in the potentials that a postcolonial perspective offers \ngeography and its subdisciplines (Nash, 2002; King, 2003; Robinson, 2003; Yeoh, 2003; \nRadcliffe, 2005). Power et al. (2006), for example, suggest that the nexus between development \nand postcolonialism is a particularly fertile one, which helps to embed postcolonial theory in \nmaterial practices (Abrahamsen, 2003; McEwan, 2003) while also providing an umbrella under \nwhich to incorporate (newer?) inductive development theories that have followed the \npostdevelopment impasse. However, despite a great deal of work theorizing postcolonial \npositions, we still lack a thorough and detailed discussion about what a postcolonial method \nmight look like, the issues we should consider while deploying such a method, what problems \nmight arise, and how these might be overcome.\n2\n In particular, how can the \u201ecolonial present\u201f \n(Gregory, 2004) of one contemporary practice of imperialism \u2013  that of why, how and what we \nresearch \u2013 be decentred and relocated to make development research more postcolonial? In this \npaper we begin to address some of the questions.\n3\n \n 2 \n \n Right at the outset it must be said that developing this postcolonial method involves \ncomplex and potentially contested processes that require recognition of the specificities of \nhistorical and spatial production of inequalities in particular places, thoroughgoing dialogue with \nthose who inhabit these places, and willingness to challenge existing hierarchies. A commitment \nto take up issues raised by those who are researched, a willingness to engage in constructive \ndialogue that takes into account the conceptual landscape of those with whom we engage, as well \nas a desire to participate in emancipatory politics are all necessary if we are to get outside of a \nwhat Sidaway (2000a:606) terms as Eurocentric \u201eworld-picturing\u201f. \n \n Some of the contours of such a method may be traced in research that development \ngeographers have engaged in, particularly during the past decades. For instance, there is \nexemplary contemporary research, which arises from and speaks to the issues raised by the \nresearched (see for example Townsend, 1995; Peake & Trotz, 2002) and reports collaborative \nresearch that works across many axes of difference (Pratt, 2002; Monk et al., 2003; Nagar & Ali, \n2003). However, our paper arises out of concern that such practices are not very widespread. As \nBriggs and Sharpe (2004: 664; original emphasis) argue, in most research, 'the experiences of the \nmarginalized are used in the West, but without opening up the process to their knowledges, \ntheories and explanations\u201f. We therefore want to think through some of the issues that face us in \ntrying to practice postcolonial research and about the moves that may be necessary to open up the \nprocess of research so that it enables another world picturing. \n \nThe rest of the paper is divided into three sections. Following this introduction, we place \nour research in the context of relevant debates in the literature on postcolonialism, development \ngeography and method. In the second section we explore three key ways in which method may be \nexpanded to make development research more postcolonial. First, we argue for the need to think \nabout the politics behind the process of \u201eproducing\u201f research questions and how these might \nideally arise out of dialogue with the research subjects. Second, we explore why the ways in \nwhich we usually deploy academic theories are limited and exclusionary and how the practice of \ntheory needs to be modified to address the materialities of the (post)colonial world. Finally, we \nargue that we need to think through and acknowledge not just the identities we bring to the \u201efield\u201f \nbut also how these are linked to our investments in the broader geopolitical context of the \nneoliberal British academy, where we are both currently located.\n4\n We suggest that thinking \ncarefully about method in these ways gives us a much more thorough going notion of \n 3 \npositionality, which is required if we are to address as well as redress current limitations in how \nwe think and write about issues of development and the \u201eglobal south\u201f. In the third section we \noutline an agenda for action for reconfiguring the scholarly track of academia to enable the \ndevelopment of a postcolonial method. Through the twists and turns of the paper we aim to \nexplore the relationship between our (post)colonial research practices and the construction of the \nacademy. \n \nPostcolonial development geography \nAt its most general, postcolonialism refers to ways of criticizing the material and discursive \nlegacies of colonialism. It presents a powerful critique of `development\u201f and offers an \nincreasingly important challenge to dominant ways of apprehending north\u2013south relations. \nMcEwan (2002) identifies several core issues underlying a postcolonial approach. First, \npostcolonial critiques stress the need to recognize the ways in which the knowledge of those who \nwere colonized are a central part in constructing imperial knowledges, and how this knowledge \nhas nevertheless become localized, provincialized or erased.  Second, these processes of \nknowledge construction are seen as central to the way in which wider geopolitical and economic \npower is secured by some groups in the north for their own benefit. Third, a postcolonial approach \nargues for the need for a radical reconstruction of history and knowledge production, demanding \nattention to a diversity of perspectives and priorities (McEwan, 2002: 128), which are elided both \nwithin the colonial project and the postcolonial present. Recognizing the voice of the subaltern \nthen becomes a crucial methodological priority for postcolonial writers, who seek to decentre the \nnorth as the privileged position from which people speak (Bell, 2002) and to recognize agents and \nsites of knowledge outside the north (Loomba, 1998). And finally, a postcolonial perspective does \nnot simply presume all the inhabitants of the third world as subaltern but, rather, recognizes how \nthe postcolonial present is constituted through the simultaneous presence of a range of subject \npositions, differentially located along different axes of power across different locations. Hence, \nthe subaltern cannot simply be mapped onto the contours of the \u201ethird\u201f world.  \n \nHowever, in the context of development geography, north\u2013south relations take a \nparticular and pressing form.\n5\n The subject of development is a colonized subject who is artificially \nproduced as distinct from the colonizer, and whose fate is often linked not to the histories of the \nproduction of inequalities but to its own lack of capacity. The intellectual authority of the colonial \nproject therefore sits heavily on the shoulders of the northern development professional working \n 4 \nin the south. Some counterweight to this authority may however be offered by \u201eengaged \nintellectuals\u201f who: \nseek to find solutions to issues of inequality, inequity and social justice rather \nthan simply record and describe them. \u2026These all require not just \nacknowledging some elements of postcolonial theory, but working creatively \nand sincerely with them.  Making connections and engaging in dialogues \nwith others is not simply an intellectual counterweight to the divisive forces \nof imperialism, but a necessary part of a progressive politics (Mercer et al., \n2003: 418). \n \nThis has to be part of challenging and changing the power hierarchies and material disparities \nupon which wider geopolitical inequalities rest.  \n \nA method for postcolonial development research? \nSo how can this progressive politics translate into developing a postcolonial method? And how \ncan postcolonial approaches, which have primarily been developed within disciplines such as \nliterary studies and history, be reformulated to undertake decolonized development research? Here \nwe can draw upon the rich vein of writing on methods in development literature (Smith, 1999; \nCorbridge & Mawdsley, 2003; Eade & Rowlands, 2003; Hickey & Mohan, 2004; ROBSON \nAND WILLIS, 1997), which problematizes power at multiple levels \u2013 from the interpersonal, to \nthe global \u2013 and argues for the need to address those power relations actively (Mohan, 1999; Nagar \n& Ali, 2003; Chambers, 2005). Such approaches attempt to make research more participatory and \naccountable (Noxolo, 2006; Routledge, 2003; for some critiques see Cooke & Kothari, 2001). \nCritical geographical literature on method too has much to contribute with its discussions around \nreflexivity (Rose, 1997; Cupples & Kindon, 2003; Reid-Henry, 2003), the power of whiteness \n(Bonnett & Nayak, 2003) and of representation (Cline-Cole, 1999; Tevara, 1999; Tembo, 2003). \nAnd finally, the extensive debates in feminist writing on methodology and ethics arise from \nsimilar imperatives and have much to offer towards postcolonial discussions on method (Butz & \nBesio, 2004; Sharp, 2005). In particular, the detailed discussions of technique distilled from years \nof feminist practice can help to situate postcolonial research practice and to embed it in material \nrelations. The mutually constitutive role of a variety of theoretical traditions in informing \ndeliberations about a postcolonial method must, therefore, be acknowledged. \n \nHowever, this vast literature on method still leaves us with two troubling issues. First, \nthere is widespread concern that on the whole development research still does not speak to the \nproblems of those who \u201eare researched\u201f (Dreze, 2002).6 Our experience is that despite many years \nof discussion on these topics, the way in which \u201eother places and people\u201f are incorporated into \n 5 \nresearch practice has not significantly altered and the impact of postcolonial (and \npostdevelopment) theorizing on the practices of \u201edoing\u201f development research has been limited.7 \nMany of us working in development geography still only appear to be taking \u201epackage trips into \nthe life of others\u201f [missing Source\/Ref? - ONLY A PHRASE WE ARE USING. IT IS NOT \nSOURCED FROM ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR]. Is Jean Dreze (2002) then correct in \nasserting that social scientists are predominantly engaged in interacting with each other about \nissues and theories that bear little relation to the \u201ereal world\u201f?  \n \nIn response, we suggest that a postcolonial method requires us to recognize the realities of \nthe academy and how it shapes research. When Dreze (2002) suggests that the issues and theories \nthat academics work with often bear little relation to the 'real world', it presupposes that academics \nare outside reality, that conversations in universities and conference halls are somehow \u201eunreal\u201f. \nAlthough we feel seduced by this account, and we definitely feel sympathetic to Dreze's \nsuggestions, when we have ourselves engaged in such conversations, we do often feel part of a \n\u201ereal\u201f, perhaps a \u201edifferent real\u201f to that we meet in the field but one which definitely has its own \npressures, hopes and projects. So what is needed is an expansion of the notion of the \u201ereal world\u201f \nto include the 'reality' of the academy so that the academic world can be reshaped to acknowledge \nand be accountable to wider social and political formations. This would open up spaces for the \nacademic activist to challenge and change material inequalities and injustices (Kitchin & \nHubbard, 1999; Massey, 2000).\n8\n We therefore focus here on some of the reconfigurations of \nacademic realities that would make place for more accountable research practices. \n \nSecond, it has been argued that this process of research interaction takes specific shape \namong northern academic development geographers who are distanced not only from the imperatives \nof people living in the south but also from geographical writing in the countries in which they \npractice their research. Thus, there is for instance disquiet about the increasing divide between \nAnglo-American research (and its forms of production) and the concerns of southern academics \n(see the issues of Gender, Place and Culture, 2002: 9(2); and Environment and Planning D, 2003: \n21(2)).  Arguably, the \u201ecultural turn\u201f in Anglo-American geography, marked by increasing \ndependence on cultural and social theorists whose work does not \u201etravel\u201f (see particularly Raju, \n2002), and particular visions of political interventions (Sakho, 2003) have exacerbated these \ndivides.\n9\n \n \n 6 \nThis argument of the increasing divide, although true on the whole, comes with many \ncaveats because many geographical researchers have lively and collaborative partnerships with \ngeographers in other parts of the world. Besides, it is possible to overstate the case for nationally \nhomogenous practices both within and among Anglo-American and non-Anglo countries. For \ninstance, Krishnendu Ray (2003) argues that there are significant differences in institutional \npower between academics working within India (e.g. between those who work at institutional \nlocations in metropolises, and in research institutes and universities, between colleges and central \ndepartments in universities) \u2013 in the resources available, the demands made on them and in the \nlanguages of communication. Similar differences resonate across the Anglo-American institutions \ntoo. Geographers are themselves embedded in complex matrices of power relations, producing \ntheir own inclusions and exclusions so that in comparing geographical work across different \nplaces, a nation is not \u201ethe only legitimate category of analysis\u201f (Ray, 2003: 2722).10 And, finally, \nusing categories such as Anglo-American geography can sometimes be delimiting because \nlocations, as Radhakrishnan (2003:22) suggests, \u201eare never simple, but rather multi-layered \nrealities overdetermined by diverse cultural and political flows\u201f.  \n \nHence, although there is no simple and unproblematic way of distinguishing different \ngeographical traditions, we would like to argue that there are still spaces and forms of knowledge \nthat are not entirely determined through their relations with the north (Mufti, 2005) but also that \nour existing academic frameworks give us little room to validate these spaces and their distinctive \nworld picturing. A postcolonial method therefore always involves holding in tension the mutual \nconstitution of the north and the south and the importance of each for the other's formations, while \nalso making room for a south that is not entirely constituted through its relation with the north. \nThis is a move in the direction of Mufti\u201fs (2005:476) global comparativism \u201ethat is a determinate \nand concrete response to the hierarchical systems that have dominated cultural life since the \ncolonial era\u201f. \n \nWe would therefore hold that the disjunctures between the ideas, methods and priorities of \nnorthern academics and their southern subjects (Dreze, 2002) sometimes overlap, sometimes \nintersect, and at other times may be distinct from that between northern academics and their \nsouthern counterparts, but that together they produce the contours of academic imperialism (Ake, \n1979). Despite the examples of \u201egood practice\u201f outlined above, there is still a: \nlack of systematic research that explores the reasons behind our limited ability to \nexcite the imagination of those whose struggles we study in the \u201eSouth\u201f, or to shift \n 7 \nthe forms, boundaries and languages of what is considered meaningful academic \ndiscourse (Nagar & Ali, 2003: 366\u2013367).  \n \nIn the rest of the paper we want to examine some ways in which we could move towards \nsuch a meaningful academic discourse in which research \u201eopens up, makes space and crosses \nover\u201f. We suggest that we need to explore the possibilities offered by expanding the notion of \nmethod to include three other aspects of the research process that have received little attention \u2013 \nthe questions we ask, how we theorize and how these are both embedded within the current \ngeopolitical situation of the British academy which presently structures our research practice. \nSuch an expanded notion of method is an essential first step towards making \u201edevelopment\u201f \nresearch more postcolonial because it takes account of the multiple realities that position \nacademics not only in the `fields\u201f that they go to and the \u201eothers\u201f they come across, but also the \nstructural frameworks of the academy which produces its own pressures of what constitutes \nacademic work. This allows us to be more cognizant of the circumstances within which \nknowledge is produced and how it is connected to the \u201eopportunities, constraints and values \nembedded in our academic institutions\u201f (Nagar & Ali, 2003: 356; also see Robinson, 2003). It also \nenables us to question how the academy validates certain knowledges and excludes others and to \ndiscern the actual social and political processes through which this is achieved, as well as how they \nmight be challenged. Finally, this involves a thoroughgoing notion of positionality, one where we \n\u201econsider our own positionalities in a much more difficult way than what has now become the \ncustomary laying out of the \u201cme\u201d in the usual \u201crace\u201d class and gender mantra\u201f (Puwar, 2003: 27). \nTogether they provide a framework for thinking about research in a holistic way and this is what a \npostcolonial method can offer. \n \nIn this paper we focus primarily on a postcolonial method for development geography as it \narises in fieldwork-based research (though many of the issues we raise are not limited to this) for a \nnumber of reasons. First, there is a strong tradition of fieldwork in development geography so \nresearch practice and discussion of these practices is often skewed towards fieldwork methods. \nSecond, and despite this tradition, there has been in recent times a tendency towards the \n\u201eabandonment of fieldwork by some researchers in favour of textual analyses\u201f (Nagar, 2002: 180) \nfollowing the critiques of fieldwork practices by researchers (Sidaway, 1992; Madge, 1993; \nPowell, 2002) and also in response to the literary and historical traditions of much early \npostcolonial work. While other texts \u2013 literary, historical secondary datasets \u2013 undoubtedly have \nmuch to offer, we want to argue for the continuance of fieldwork (and despite many of the issues we \n 8 \nraise below) because it brings us most directly into contact with the everyday lives and realities of \nothers, and through this democratic impulse has considerable potential for developing a dialogic \nversion and accountable outcome for research (Sharp, 2005).\n11\n This paper has grown out of an \nongoing dialogue between us (the authors) on these issues over the last decade, on reflections on our \nresearch practices and dialogues with the many others with whom we have done research and lived \nout our lives.\n12\n We use examples from our own work which are (primarily) embedded within debates \nabout gender and development, a field where the intersection between feminist questions around \nmethod and development's interrogation of ethics\/politics come so pressingly alive. \n \nTowards a postcolonial method  \nIn this section we want to focus on aspects of academic research practice that we think shape the \nproblems of relevance and dialogue identified above and which could be altered to make \ndevelopment research more postcolonial because: \u201eself-criticality needs to embrace not only the \nsubstantive topics of research but also the practices involved in the doing of human geography\u201f \n(Cloke, 2002: 591; emphasis added). We suggest the need to be more vigilant about how we \nframe our entry into academic work, how we frame our theories and how we frame our own \ninvestments in the academy.\n13 \n \nEarly beginnings, creating a dialogue \nThe initial framing of a postcolonial method must be in terms of why the research is being \nconducted in the first place. If a postcolonial approach involves critical recognition of the material \nand discursive legacies of colonialism, then a postcolonial method has no option but to be a \npolitically engaged method that forefronts the ethical issues of who gains from this research, and \nwhy. The researcher must be clear about the power relations, inequalities and injustices that \nenable and allow their research to occur and must be committed to working towards challenging \nthese at different scales \u2013 the personal, the institutional, the global political.  \n \nIt is only then that we can consider how the research question might be produced. We use \nthe example of Parvati\u201fs PhD thesis (Raghuram, 1993) to explore the complexities of this issue. \nThe thesis arose from two theoretical streams: development critiques of vulnerability (which \nshifted the focus of vulnerability from the microeconomic unit of the individual to that of a \nhousehold) and feminist critiques of the household as a unit of equality. She postulated that the unit \nof vulnerability is usually a subset of the household and that social networks, which subsidized their \nwelfare, supported such units. The topic emerged neatly from existing theoretical discussions in the \n 9 \nBritish academy at the time. Parvati then went to India to conduct fieldwork. However, as the \nfollowing excerpt from the thesis shows, things did not necessarily go well: \nThe agenda for the study was set by the researcher.  My study uncovered areas that \nwere considered important by the respondents whom I had addressed but could do \nlittle to redress. \u2026Further research and policies for the areas should focus on these \nagenda (Raghuram, 1993: 73). \n \nThis passage suggests that Parvati was aware of the limitations of her entry points, but like many \nnew researchers, felt constrained by the conceptual framework adopted before the fieldwork. Her \nthesis agenda were shaped by the discursive frameworks of northern academic institutions \nbecause: \u201ethe production, distribution and consumption of \u201cknowledge\u201d on non-European [gender] \nissues is still governed by what has the \u201csanction\u201d of Western academic centres of learning\u201f \n(Pandurang, 2003: 121\u20132). As well as being linked to European theoretical traditions, it was also \ntemporally situated so that, as Raju (2002: 176) suggests, the initial research questions were \ninfluenced by \u201ethe flavours of the month\u201f. So the thesis and the questions it set out to address were \nframed within northern academic imperatives \u201ewith a consequent underplaying of the need to \nconnect ideas with a broader range of political practice\u201f (Cloke, 2002: 589) that might have been \nmore relevant within the Indian fieldwork context. The hegemony that the academy holds over its \nmembers, especially students and others who feel disadvantaged within the academy (due to their \nclass, race, gender backgrounds, perhaps?), to \u201espeak\u201f in a certain way can trouble and delimit the \nscope of much development research. \n \nThis is, however, not to argue for a form of na\u00efve localism or a simple particularism as no \nplace is free from the play of power (Mohan, 1999). Rather, this example suggests the need to \nexplore methods that will make our questions themselves more dialogic. This dialogue does not \nmean giving up your own position entirely, but starting from your own acknowledged position \nwith openness to other positions. But in advocating dialogue we certainly do not presume that all \ndifference can be dissolved to attain a complete (rational) understanding of the other, for there \nwill always be degrees of incomprehensibility and continuing spaces \u201ein between\u201f. But working \nthrough these inbetween spaces can bring moments of enlightenment; glimpses of the world \nthrough someone else\u201fs reality and a sense of the losses associated with privilege. From such \nmoments of deep personal and political change more relevant research questions can arise, \nquestions that can potentially challenge the \u201emaster narrative\u201f of  northern-centred research.  \n \n 10 \nWe would argue that a postcolonial method demands that research questions should be \nproduced in dialogue so that project beginnings are embedded within and take account of the \npriorities of the researched and not delimited by the concerns of the northern \u201eexperts\u201f (Escobar, \n1995). It is this imperative from the \u201eground\u201f that has the potential to make research more \ntransformatory. Thus, what is needed is a redefinition of fieldwork to include the paradigmatic \nquestions of the research and an assessment of their relevance (Tembo, 2003:231). But what \nacademic configurations would be necessary for this to occur? What kinds of changes would be \nrequired of funding bodies, thesis committees, and research training and supervision sessions to \nmake them flexible enough to accommodate changes wrought to the initial research questions as a \nresult of an engaged dialogue with those who inhabit some of our fieldwork locations? These are \nsome of the realities that often influence how research questions are currently produced and \ndelimit the nature of research engagements, an issue we return to later in the paper. \n \nBut starting early also involves reflecting on and questioning the assumptions we make in \nour analyses in the field, showing how these are thoroughly dependent on the subjectivities that we as \nacademics bring to our research. This is important because a postcolonial method must work \ntowards problematizing the way that the world is known and challenging the hidden assumptions \nat the heart of northern research practice. These assumptions inform representations of knowledge, \nwhich are not neutral but charged with power that can influence the way in which our world is \nshaped. This link between representation, knowledge and subjectivities is illustrated through the \nfollowing extract from an unpublished  paper (Madge, c. 1993) Clare wrote sometime after \nsubmitting her PhD thesis (Madge, 1992). Based on fieldwork in The Gambia, her thesis focused \non gender issues in the collecting economy of rural Gambian households but the representations in \nthe thesis were influenced by her own subjective experiences of the academy:  \nNot long after returning to England from The Gambia I gave a seminar at \nBirmingham University entitled \u201eGambian women: so strong a force?\u201f This \nsummed up many of the representations in my thesis text. I saw the women as \npowerful, centred, in control. However, I now feel that such representations were a \n\u201edescriber\u201fs descriptions\u201f. Some women did have power (sometimes) but not \nnecessarily authority; some did have respect and control within the family \n(sometimes) but at a broader political and economic scale, many changes were \nbeyond their control. So where were the representations in my thesis text coming \nfrom?\n14\n The representations were in part a reaction to the negative images of \nAfrican women in the 1980s Eurocentric literature, which I had read before going to \nThe Gambia (for example Cutrufelli, 1983). African women were portrayed as \u201ethe \npoorest of the poor\u201f, people lacking \u201eagency\u201f who were \u201esubjugated\u201f and powerless. \nHowever, on arriving in The Gambia I was impressed by (what I labelled as) the \npower women seemed to exercise and esteem they appeared to command. However, \nthe positive roles of African women that I represented were also probably a result of \n 11 \nmy own perceived relative powerlessness as a young woman in the lower ranks of \nthe academic establishment. In comparison with how powerless I felt at that time, \nthe Gambian women appeared confident and comfortable with themselves. In the \nonly framework I then knew (self\/other) I therefore perceived and represented the \nGambian women as powerful. At this stage I did not link this \u201enaming\u201f to the \ncreation of an \u201eother\u201f with me at the centre, the norm. The interesting issue, on \nreflection now, is that in trying to overcome one set of Eurocentric discourses I was \nactively creating a new set (Madge, c.1993).  \n \nA postcolonial method must therefore also involve early beginnings that challenge the experiences \nof analysing, representing, speaking and writing by which development research comes into \nbeing, highlighting how knowledge is a form of `messy power\u201f (cf Rose, 1997). If not, we silence \nour positionings with peril because our subjectivities not only make us privilege some angles, aspects \nand attitudes in our analyses but also occlude others which shape the contours of our postcolonial \nprojects.  \n \nTo summarize, a postcolonial method starts early on. It involves thinking about why we are \ndoing research in the south in the first place, how we come to and produce our questions within a \nbroader geopolitical context and how we analyze and represent our findings based on our subject \npositionings. But while these practices can help towards creating a more materially grounded and \nrelevant research agenda, this framing of our entry into research is not enough. If postcolonialism \nis about a radical reconstruction of history and knowledge production, demanding attention to a \ndiversity of perspectives and priorities, then we must also consider how we frame our dialogues \nwith other texts, in particular, how we theorize. \n \nQuestioning theory, theorizing practice \nA second way that we could move towards developing a postcolonial method in development \ngeography is through expanding the notion of method to include theorization. The use of \nparticular sets of theories, and more importantly theoreticians, in guiding research provides its \nown exclusions\/inclusions (Spivak, 1988; Hooks, 1989; Chow, 1993). We begin with an example.  \n \nSome years ago, an Indian scholar was invited to present a paper on representations of the \nbody in women's magazines in India at a famous centre for sociological research in a British \nuniversity. After the presentation, a member of the audience expressed her disappointment that the \nscholar had drawn on the gurus of western social theory, in particular the analysis offered by \nBourdieu, and that she had not used Indian theorists. If this scholar had not framed her analysis within \n 12 \ntheoretical frameworks familiar to the audience, we wonder, would she have been known to the \nacademics at this university, or even invited to present a paper there? In short, as they stand, do our \nmethods of knowing give little room to do anything more than \u201erecreate what we already assume, \nand\u2026 re-inscribe the politics of the status quo\u201f (Passaro, 1997: 151)?  \n \nSo in this section we suggest three ways of altering how we think\/use theory to help us \nmove towards a postcolonial method for development research, one which moves away from the \nstatus quo to \u201eprovincialize\u201f western theory (Chakraborty, 2000). First, we need to embed \ndiscussions of theory in practice by talking about theory as practice; second, we must recognize \nand reconfigure our methods of theorization; and finally, it is imperative that we contextualize \ntheory. Together, we believe these steps (further discussed below) can help to destabilize the \npower of certain northern theories, open up the possibility of theoretical dialogue and enable a \ntheorization that is more accountable to and embedded in the perspectives of those in the south \nabout whom we theorize.  \n \nFirst we suggest that we need to consider theory as practice. We can do this by \ndeconstructing the artificial opposition between theoretically-led approaches (where questions are \nled by key concepts and their development by theorists) and strongly empirical conceptions of \nknowledge (where explicit theorization is kept to a minimum) (Johnson et al., 2004). We argue \nthat theory is part of all intellectual work. Indeed, all knowledge is inherently theoretical, as it \ninvolves making sense of the world through a process of abstraction. Knowledge construction \ninvolves editing in and editing out, holding in abeyance, choosing and reflecting, connecting and \ndisconnecting, all part of the process of theorizing. However, because \u201etheory\u201f has acquired a \nreified and highly valued status in academic work we sometimes lose sight of its relationship to \nour everyday practices. On the other hand, an overemphasis on knowledge as practice can also be \nproblematic. A move to a client-oriented approach to knowledge, where consultancy and \nevaluation research becomes central to how the development industry operates in the search for \n\u201esimple solutions\u201f to emergent problems, can sometimes lead to a disdain for theoretical \nknowledges (Mukherji, 2004). The critique of theory as belonging to the ivory tower can then be \nutilized to devalue abstracted thinking while at the same time reinscribing existing hierarchies \nabout what constitutes knowledge. We therefore suggest that a postcolonial method must move \naway from treating theory and practice as oppositional because we all practice and live out our \ntheories. \n \n 13 \nNevertheless theoretical knowledge in the academy does produce its exclusions\/inclusions \nbecause theory is usually assumed to be archival knowledge, that which is written, stored and \nreproduced in particular forms, such as books and journal articles, and prized for its immanent \nvalue. Theory is often seen as distanced from the process of embodiment, for instance, from oral \nknowledges that are passed down from generation to generation and altered through practice. The \nprocesses of distanciation may become even more marked in writing theory, where a particular \nform of language is usually deployed, which while varying both within and around disciplines and \napproaches is marked by complexity and elaborated structures. It is also generated through \nparticular sites, usually within academic institutions, though not necessarily so. Finally, theory is \noften referential \u2013 we often enter theory through theory (Dixon & Jones, 2004) \u2013 so that with new \nlayers of theorization and more and more references to texts that we have not read, more and more \nof us are left behind. Thus, \u201etheory\u201f is not a set of disembedded practices, but is also a located and \nhistorical entity. Indeed, any theory is inevitably produced within, and may well be expressive of, \nthe social hierarchies and inequalities of those who produce and circulate it. For these reasons, \ntheory is always value-laden, even where it makes claims to objectivity or \u201escientific\u201f neutrality. \nBut, we would like to suggest, these are problems about how we currently do theory, rather than \ntheory per se.  \n \nSo how might we go about reconfiguring our methods of theorization to meet the \nimperatives of postcolonial method? Towards this we suggest, following Johnston et al. \n(2004:98\u201399), that it is more fruitful to think of theorization as a process of abstraction by which \ndetails are simplified and links and relationships made more apparent, a kind of empirical \ndisembedding, a move away from the complexity of the concrete, a shift from the particular to the \ngeneral, a move away from a \u201ereal\u201f that is more complicated than we can possibly tell. All \nintellectual work involves abstraction \u2013 we define our research questions by selecting from the \ncomplex tapestry of everyday life. However, by being conscious of the processes of selection and \nour pre-knowledges that influence how we know what we know, we can justify our choices and \nsee \u2013 and make visible to others \u2013 their effects. This achieves three things. First, it highlights the \ninevitability of theorization. Second, it outlines a method for \u201edoing theory\u201f, and describes it as a \nsituated practice, and therefore helps to destabilize the power of \u201eTheory\u201f. And third, it sheds light \non the geographical and historical locatedness of particular ways of theorizing and issues of power \nas they are configured in the processes of abstraction. \n \n 14 \nA crucial aspect of the destabilization of \u201eTheory\u201f is a conscious movement between the \ndifferent levels of abstraction involved in intellectual work. \u201eTheory\u201f often secures its authority by \nworking only at a highly abstracted level, one that we call \u201ehighly theoretical\u201f. For instance, even \nwhere the language of place is deployed in some versions of globalization theory, it is an \nabstracted place, one that is removed from the concrete. Counterposed to this version of theory is \nthat outlined by Richard Johnson (1982) with regard to the writings of Karl Marx. Johnson argues \nthat Marx\u201fs theoretical work focused on what was specific to the capitalist organization of labour \nin Britain of the mid-nineteenth century and carefully identified its links, continuities and \ndifferences with other societies in which class and property ownership were central, in order to \ndemonstrate the validity of his argument. Marx therefore moved from universal categories (true \nof all history), to trans-epochal categories (true of all class societies), to categories with a \nnarrower scope of reference true of a particular epoch or social regime of labour, usually the \ncapitalist epoch. This movement between levels helped to produce specificity but also a \ngeneralizability: it began with a concrete historical and spatial formation, an analysis of the \nproblem of the time which was contextually embedded, and from this moved between different \nlevels of abstraction, returning finally to what this meant for a politics of change. So starting and \nreturning to the concrete is what produces its explanatory value, helping us to explain our own \nconcrete particularities. As Johnson et al. (2004:100) suggest: \nMoving between levels includes re-embedding our theories in the denseness of \nthe particular, so that our understanding of the particular is enhanced. \nTheorization, therefore, involves a double articulation: a move away from the \ncomplexities of individual instances to relatively simplified concepts, a move \nback to the concrete with our explanations enhanced\u2026  In concretion, our theory \nfinds further correction or elaboration. The whole circuit is necessary: it doesn\u201ft \nhelp, except sometimes strategically, to privilege one level or the other.  \n \nWhat we suggest therefore is that we need a much more complete return to the concrete issues that \nwe are theorizing because without it we limit the scope of the theory, we universalize theory while \nat the same time its ability to facilitate understanding is diminished. Most importantly, we \nencourage an evasiveness of the political implications of the theoretical ideas, and hence an \nincomplete accountability. In contrast, postcolonial theory suggests that it is not enough to \nprovincialize northern theories; we also need to move southern knowledges to a level of \nabstraction that shakes up the idea that generality emanates from northern knowledge construction \nwhile particularity is synonymous with southern knowledges. Thus moving to a level of \nabstraction where the question resonates across space, where the place-specific can be \nilluminative, but not binding, and can enable us to think about a located praxis and its relations \n 15 \nwith trans-epochal alliances. This enables an understanding of the \u201egeneral account of the play of \nthe particular in the universalizing processes of capitalist-imperial modernity\u201f (Mufti, 2005: 485).  \n \nThis brings us to the third point, the importance of contextualizing theory. The the above \ndiscussion suggests that a postcolonial method for development research must be one that moves \nbetween levels of abstraction, gaining its imperatives from the concrete as well as returning to the \nconcrete. It is also one in which the spatial and temporal locatedness of theories must be made \napparent. Empirical work usually makes explicit its moment of production; it locates itself both \nspatially and temporally. But we are rarely required to do this when we begin with \u201eTheory\u201f.  Just \nas we need a context for understanding our empirical work, we also need a historical and \ngeographical contextualization for the theories that we use. This would make transparent and offer \nchallenges to the scope of some Eurocentric theories. The often unstated claim to universality is \none of the key problems of how many northern academics currently theorize. The hierarchies of \npower within the academy inscribe some theories with a global reach and universalistic scope \nwhile others are demarcated as \u2013 and see themselves to be \u2013 local. Indigeneity is then unhelpfully \ncounterposed to universality, so that one speaks for the particular and the other for the general. \nWe therefore argue for the need to make clear the context in which all theories are being produced \nand for theoretical work to identify its scope in ways similar to what we require and expect from \nempirical studies.\n15\n And we need the academy to validate theories not for their universality, but \nfor their locatedness. \n \nSituating theory involves not only recognizing the current geographical and historical \nembeddedness and scope of theory, but also recognizing how theorization then incorporates \npeople differently in different parts of the (post)colonial world. Global political economy and \nhistory have produced particular sites of development, and delimited the language of development \nto some sites while positioning some people as \u201edevelopers\u201f. These demarcations affect who does \ndevelopment research, and where. For example, it is rare to see academics from India coming to \nBritain to undertake fieldwork; rather, they come to one of the British institutes to read \ndevelopment theory but return to India (or, less frequently, go elsewhere in the global south) to \nactually \u201edo\u201f development research\/work.16 These splits have political and emotional \nconsequences. Thus, Wole Soyinka (quoted in Tiffin, 1991: xiv; original emphases), laments:  \nWe have been blandly invited to submit ourselves to a second epoch of colonialism \u2013 \nthis time by a universal\u2013humanoid abstraction defined and conducted by individuals \nwhose theories and prescriptions are derived from the appreciation of their world and \ntheir history, their social neuroses and their value systems. \n 16 \n \nOur academic politics means that very often we use places in the south as empirical sites \nand sites for application of theory, not as sites which generate their own abstractions, so that there \nis a \u201epersistent alignment of theory\/development dualism with the \u201cWest\u201d\/\u201dthird world\u201d division\u201f \n(Robinson, 2002: 531). Therefore:  \nwhen the \u201ewho is speaking about what\u201f issue is examined, development scholars \n(from the South and North) might prefer the term \u201ecolonization\u201f to \u201ecross \nfertilization\u201f to refer to the way in which theory is formulated in geography. \n\u2026Only when, as a matter of course, social science research draws on theoretical \ninsights and empirical examples from work on development (especially from the \nSouth) to understand and critique processes like globalization, will the \npostcolonial agenda become fully established. At this point development studies \nand political geography will reach the \u201estage of full maturity\u201f (Laurie with Calla, \n2004: 112). \n \nThis critique of the \u201eculture of theory\u201f has been the subject of many theorists working within a \npostcolonial frame (see Said, 1984, for extended discussions). For instance, Mufti (2005: 486) \nargues that it:  \nhas become a last defence and redoubt for some of its inhabitants, a place of safety \nand refuge from the imperatives of what Said calls contrapuntality; it can be \ngranted that \u201cthey\u201d have literatures and other modes of cultural expression that are \nworthy of consideration, but only \u201cwe\u201d have theory, the inclination to think in \nabstract and conceptual terms about language, culture, and the world and about the \nconditions of possibility of such knowledge itself.  \n \nThere is, therefore, an urgent need for readings which \u201econcede the reality of other knowledges\u201f \nand for research practices to avoid becoming \u201ean arena where readings take on a purely \nepiphenomenal significance long after the question of knowledge has been settled in favor of \nmetropolitan knowledge\u201f.[RADHAKRISHNAN, 2003: 24] Other worlds need to be recognized \n\u201enot merely as other histories but as other knowledges that question the legitimacy of metropolitan \ntheory\u201f (Radhakrishnan, 2003: 24). \n  \nHowever, by situating the critique of theory within a relatively high level of abstraction, \nthe route into making these transcultural readings is not always made very clear. We would urge \nfor a close look at theorization as part of research practice, as a method. To summarize, we \nadvocate a postcolonial method which problematizes theorization and makes transparent both its \ncontext and the scope of its effects. This will help to destabilize the power of some theories, \nenable us to find points of theoretical intersection and commonality between different particular \ntheoretical accounts and make place for a more dialogic version of theory that hears from and \n 17 \nspeaks to people in different parts of the world. But this \u201epostcolonial vision\u201f will only be possible \nif we very firmly locate our research within the framing of our own institutional, geopolitical and \nmaterial investments, the issue to which we turn next. \n \nPersonal investments, neoliberal academy \nThe final framing to consider as part and parcel of a postcolonial method is that of investments. \nConsidering the early beginnings to a research project and questioning the manner of theorizing \nrequire a deep engagement and reconstruction of the multiple investments academics make in \ntheir research and the necessity of contextualizing these investments in particular settings which \nare structured by the global political economy, in the British case, by the increasing \ncorporatization of higher education. It is necessary, as Sidaway (2000b: 265\u201366) argues, to \nconsider the wider \u201efield\u201f of academic production, because `reflexivity is not primarily a project \nabout self-knowledge but rather concerns itself with the conditions of production of the \u201cself\u201d and \nits knowledges\u201f. Moreover, as Castree & Sparke (2000: 222) urge, this is imperative as \ngeographers have not addressed directly the way in which the British academy itself is embedded \nin flexible accumulation dynamics, which inevitably structures the way in which we do \ndevelopment research. \n \nThus, it is necessary to move beyond location to investments to examine the conditions \nwithin which we produce academic work, how we benefit from these conditions and how we \nmight challenge them. As Chacko (2004) suggests, personal interest and career advancement are \nthe twin engines that often drive a research topic, so a thoroughgoing positionality needs to take \ncognizance of how research is brokered by academic discourses and power. The issue of \ninvestments has to be considered part of academic practice because for many of us, our academic \ninvestments compete with, and are sometimes antagonistic to, our other investments. We as \nacademics also have other investments \u2013 to our families, to political projects, to our mental and \nphysical health, to the people whom we research, to our own ethics and conscience \u2013 that jostle \nwith each other to produce our final version of knowledge. Recognizing and validating our other \ninvestments can help to place academic work in wider world contexts, to return academic \npractices to the complexity of the concrete and to recognize the many other people and places to \nwhich we are accountable. The question here is how do we prioritize our investments and which of \nour engagements do we consider most compelling? What we argue below is that given the \nimportance of the world of work in our identity, we need the academy (as our site of work) to change \n 18 \nthe kinds of investments it requires of us and to put its \u201egeopolitical house in order\u201f (Robinson, 2003: \n65), in order to really enable us to practice postcolonial research. \n \nBut many changes to the institutional structure of the academy will be required to achieve \nthis, because in 2005 political activism is increasingly difficult in the British academy. According \nto Ruddick (2004: 230) there are \u201egrowing difficulties of being politically engaged beyond the \nconfines of our institutions, that at best do not reward this activity, and at worse actively \ndiscourage it. Activism remains something of an illegitimate discourse\u201f. The dynamics of \ncontemporary capitalism, with the attendant marketization of education and commodification of \nknowledge, are \u201esplitting apart\u201f the university as a space for a critical intellectual citizenship \n(Castree & Sparke, 2000: 223\u201324). We therefore need the \u201econditions of our labour\u201f to be altered in \norder to allow us to  invest in the kind of reality that Dreze privileges, a critical activist reality that \ntakes its questions from the ground to guide our research. There are few academics who appear to be \nable to achieve this given the current productionism of the neoliberal research environment of the \nBritish academy. \n \nIn the UK, major grant awarding bodies, such as the Economic and Social Research Council \n(ESRC) and the British Academy, distinguish particular themes as priorities for research, so in order \nto get grants, research must be set within \u201ethe contours set by their funders\u201f and the outputs meet the \nrequirements of such bodies (Cloke et al., 2004: 371). This, along with shifts in the system for \nresearch funding, whereby institutions are rewarded for particular forms of publications and in certain \njournals, has led to increasing institutional and personal pressure to target publications to these \njournals rather than to the multiple audiences appropriate to the project (Demeritt, 2000). The \nproblem with the academy can then be summarized by the questions we all often are faced with: If we \nwant to invest in the academy what do we have to disinvest from? Given the current institutional \npressures of the academy, how possible is it to enter into a research process as an \u201eengaged \nintellectual\u201f who makes connections and engages in dialogues with others (Mercer et al., 2003: \n418)? Academics need \u201eto pause within their scholarly tracks and to think about how their own \ninvestments are ultimately linked to the very postures and productions they produce\u201f (Puwar, \n2003: 21).We conclude this paper by offering some suggestions for reconfiguring \u201ethe scholarly \ntrack\u201f. \n \nWhere now? An agenda for change  \n 19 \nWe have in this paper looked at some processes through which dominant research practices are \nreproduced and how they produce particular, usually northern biases, which serve to limit the \nscope of our development research. In this section, we outline some practical moves that we \nconsider to be necessary if we are to attempt another \u201eworld picturing\u201f based on a postcolonial \nmethod. If we want to move away from being \u201epart of the problems, rather than being part of the \nsolutions to the problems\u201f (Edwards, 1989: 117), we have to think carefully about how we choose \nto position ourselves within the academic hierarchy and the world beyond it. This requires \nchallenging and changing the nature of academic work, so that we can link our academic \npractices, ways of thinking and performing in the academy, with our way of being in the world.  \nBelow we outline some suggestions that we think will lay the basis for a postcolonial method in \ndevelopment geography. \n \nFirst, we think that there should be greater funding opportunities to enable more dialogic \nresearch practice. For example, research-funding bodies could award funds for doing an extended \nperiod of fieldwork early on in the research, to identify appropriate questions, to make suitable \nalliances and to have a meaningful engagement with research communities. Additionally, \ncollaborative research with southern research practitioners could be more readily funded. An \nexample of good practice is the British Arts and Humanities Research Board's new initiative of \ncollaborative doctoral awards based on active collaboration between higher education institutions \nand other bodies. Southern development practitioners too should be eligible for these forms of \npostgraduate funding and their southern experience should be validated on its own terms. \nProgrammes such as the new collaborative programme announced by the UK's ESRC \u2013 along \nwith the Department for International Development (DFID), move towards these objectives.  \nHowever great care needs to be taken to ensure that such collaboration does not serve to expropriate \nand `adopt' others while academics (particularly northern academics) retain the prestige, research-\nfunding and decision making authority about what constitutes knowledge. To support and encourage \ndialogic working practice is not simply a matter of flipping the coin. A new set of questions, \nlanguages, techniques, working practices and textual forms may develop and we will have to be \nhumble in our efforts to work in collaboration. A \u201edouble critical consciousness\u201f, tuneful to the \nrealities of multiple locations and the power hierarchies that cross them, will be a challenging \nmethodological approach to be working towards.  \n \nBut to support a postcolonial method we also need to reconsider the way in which we \ntheorize. We need to think about theoretical practices differently, evaluating theories for their \n 20 \nability to handle and explain concrete problems or issues and their ability to open up the \npossibility of praxis. Our theoretical methods should be less referential, less reverential and more \ncontextualized so that theory does not become the playing ground for those who are already in the \n\u201eknow\u201f. This could potentially force enormous changes to our current disciplinary practices. Our \nknowledge construction and regulation, writing patterns, grant reviewing practices, supervision \nsessions, methodological training, external examining procedures and refereeing processes, that is, \nour professional practices, will all need reconfiguring for this. Changes to such academic cultural \nnorms will not happen overnight and will involve enormous commitment and potential losses for \nsome. \n \nFinally, a postcolonial method requires full awareness of our investments in the \ngeopolitical academy, which are not posited as oppositional to other investments. This requires \ngreater recognition of the significance of policy relevant research and of steps towards breaking \ndown divisions within and between academia and beyond. Practitioner-orientated journals, such as \nDevelopment in Practice and Gender and Development, which provide a forum for debate \nbetween practitioners, policymakers, academics and activists, must be valued in RAE (research \nassessment exercise) culture. Routinized behaviour of individual academics must not be judged \nwholly by the norms of personal ethics without recognizing that these are also institutionally \nproduced. A consideration of the banal processes of production of academic knowledges has to be \na first step in rethinking the possibility of activism and genuine dialogue as part of academic \nresearch (Cloke, 2002:598).\n17\n  \n \nAt the foreground of all these deliberations must be the haunting questions: just why is it \nso difficult to imagine and undertake a method of research that takes more concrete steps towards a \nmore just and equal society for all? What personal, institutional and political changes must be \nundertaken to alter the \u201econditions of labour\u201f which will make this possible? And do we have the \npolitical will to create a postcolonial method for development research that has a better chance to \n\u201emake a difference\u201f? These are urgent and necessary questions that we must ask ourselves if we are \nnot simply to adopt postcolonialism as a comfortable buffer of inclusion of some sites and \nknowledges whilst reproducing dominant northern paradigms. Without this, postcolonialism \nmight become yet another colonizing discourse and practice directed from northern centres of \nglobal power, one which plays to the political rhetoric of inclusion within the academy while \nadding further layers of delusion and amnesia to the material exclusion beyond it. \n \n 21 \nAcknowledgments  \nParticular thanks to Reginald Cline-Cole, Clive Barnett and two anonymous SJTG referees for their \nthoughtful comments. We hope we have addressed some of their concerns but any shortcomings \nremain our own. \n  \n \nEndnotes \n \n1 There have been interesting debates on research techniques that might be used in a postcolonial method, for \nexample, over the value of action-orientated participatory approaches in development research (see Cooke & \nKothari, 2001). However, we would like to argue for an expanded definition of method that incorporates all the \npractices and preconceptions that shape the technique (see Johnson et al., 2004 for a detailed argument). We \nwould also like to highlight the contingency of method, that is, there is no single appropriate postcolonial method \nas our method must be adapted to the specificities of the social, political, historical and material locations of the \nresearcher and the people with whom they work. This is because the (post)colonial world of economies, \ninstitutions, cultures and minds is differentiated, uneven and interconnected. Finally, we do not have space here \nto discuss all aspects of what might constitute a postcolonial method and many important issues are left for \nanother time, including techniques\/ethics\/leaving the field\/ways of writing and so on.  \n \n2 We offer a located perspective on postcolonialism that suggests agendas for action within our own academic \nsetting. Here `we\u201f refers to academic development geographers who we assume will be the main audience of this \nacademic journal. We recognize problems with the use of the term 'we' in the paper as it is suggestive of a \ncommon constituency and can erase the socially, spatially and politically differentiated aspects of development \nresearch. We hope however, that the paper will speak, if differently, to our various readers. \n \n3 However, due to space constraints this paper does not address key questions such as what defines a \nmethod as postcolonial, or why some of the issues discussed here should not be part of any (ethical) \nresearch project.  \n \n4 The \u201efield\u201f is a highly contested term (Gupta & Ferguson, 1997). Here we refer to it as the physical location and \npolitical\/social terrain where research is undertaken, both of which are intimately connected to other sites of the \nresearcher\u201fs world. Fieldwork then is not just a set of logistics but a whole range of human encounters occurring \nwithin the uneven social terrain of the field (cf Cloke et al., 2004: 4).  \n \n5 Since organizations such as the World Bank identify \u201elack of knowledge\u201f as a vector of development, \nit is important to intervene and argue for wider notions of knowledge that go beyond institutional \napproaches (see Zein-Alabdin, 2004, for an extended critique). On the other hand, the move to \nincorporate and institutionalize indigenous knowledges too raises alarm bells (Briggs & Sharpe, 2004). \nIn this paper we are presuming that engaged dialogue around knowledge construction is not driven by \nrenewed desires to colonize the knowledge of others, but out of a recognition of the perils of parochial \nnorthern knowledge. \n \n6\n This also problematically presumes that all development research focuses on those who are \n\u201erelatively powerless\u201f but, given the extant critique of this position (Mohan, 1999, also see below), we \ndo not engage with this element here.  \n \n7 Recent critical texts on practicing human geography (see for e.g. Cloke et al., 2004 and Scheyvens & Storey, \n2003) have begun to pay attention to disciplinary research practices, recognizing them as embodied and \nconstituted through practices of travelling, dwelling, seeing, recording, narrating etc. They also have a more \n\u201epolitical\u201f vision of why research might be undertaken in the first place and who might benefit from the process, \nand why. This framing will spill over into the practices of current development\/geography students, hopefully \nchanging the way in which development research is done in the future.  \n \n 22 \n8\n \nHere we are not simply arguing that all academics should be involved in more activist fields. There is \na whole scale of potential involvement with interconnected political and intellectual motivations. \nRather, what we are arguing is that political and theoretical frameworks of research projects must not \nbe solely contained within existing Anglo-American academic structures. This requires the academy to \nchange to let us have other beginnings and it requires us to change so that we validate our ways of \nbeing which are not merely academic. \n \n9 A number of attempts have also been made to respond to these divides, both through thinking \nthrough how social sciences in other parts of the world can become `less fixated\u201f by western \nparadigms (Mukherji, 2004), and by elaborating frameworks for other beginnings (Smith, 1999; \nGrossman, 2003). \n \n10 The role of the displaced intellectual \u201eor those who left\u201f is even more ambiguous \u2013 many become \nethnic minorities in the white academy (Chow, 1993; Puwar & Raghuram, 2003). \n \n11 We recognize that all fieldwork is ultimately textualized but feel that fieldwork produces particular versions of \naccountability as we feel committed to \u201epersonified others\u201f we meet in fieldwork in very different ways than we \nfeel to texts.  \n \n12 Parvati would like to thank Richard Johnson and Estella Tincknell in particular, for opening up cultural studies \nand its possibilities and politics to her. Clare would like to thank Tim Sayers, Ansu Badjie and Vahida \nMohammad for opening up the possibility of another world picturing to her. \n \n13 We like the word frame here, because it suggests that there may be more going on outside the frame but that at \nthis moment and for this audience this is how we draw our boundaries around these issues. We would however \nargue for a \u201eplastic\u201f frame, one that is malleable and is altered by pressures from both inside and outside the \nframe.  \n \n14 (and where are my representations coming from now in this paper)? \n \n15 However, as Barnett (1999:290) suggests meaning is 'dependent on, but not finally reducible to local \npractices', so that contextualisation must itself become a reflexive practice, where contexts are understood as \nconstituted through institutional and social practices. \n \n16 We were particularly struck by this during a conversation with a British academic who obtained a \nCommonwealth scholarship in the 1960s to pursue a doctorate at an Indian university: how many \npeople from the first world register for development studies degrees in the third world nowadays? \n \n17 These manoeuvres for reconfiguring the academy should be accompanied by steps to include and take account \nof our reproductive responsibilities. For example, grants which permit us to bring our families with us for extended \nfieldwork periods. \n \nReferences \nAbrahamsen R (2003) African studies and the postcolonial challenge.
