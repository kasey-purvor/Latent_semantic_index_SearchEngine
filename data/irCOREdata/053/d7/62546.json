We have previously identified two HSP70 genes (HSP70A \nand HSP70B) in subtidal populations of the Antarctic limpet (Nacella \nconcinna). These genes are up regulated in response to increased seawater \ntemperatures of 15\u00baC or more during acute heat shock experiments, \ntemperatures, which have very little basis when considering the current \nAntarctic ecology of these animals. Therefore the question was posed as to \nwhether these animals could express HSP70 genes when subjected to more \ncomplex environmental conditions, such as those that occur in the intertidal. \nIntertidal limpets were collected on three occasions in different weather \nconditions at South Cove, Rothera Point over a complete tidal cycle and the \nexpression levels of the HSP70 genes measured. Both genes showed relative \nup regulation of gene expression over the period of the tidal cycle. The \naverage foot temperature of these animals was 3.3\u00b0C, far below that of the \nacute heat shock experiments. These experiments demonstrate that the \ntemperature and expression levels of HSP production in wild animals cannot \nbe accurately extrapolated from experimentally induced treatments, especially \nwhen considering the complexity of stressors in the natural environment. \nHowever, experimental manipulation can provide molecular markers for \nidentifying stress in Antarctic molluscs, provided it is accompanied by \nenvironmental validation, as demonstrated here. \n 2\nHSP_Limpet \nIntroduction \nTo successfully colonise and reproduce in a particular environment, any \norganism has to be responsive to, and able to adapt to, changes in their \nphysical surroundings. This is particularly crucial for marine intertidal \ninvertebrates as they regularly experience conditions that for most species \nwould constitute acute, and potentially lethal, stress (for Antarctic intertidal \nstresses see Waller et al 2006). As part of their daily routine, they have to \ncope with periodic tidal emersion and the consequential changes in \ntemperature, desiccation, humidity and ultraviolet irradiation. How animals \ncope with regular acute stresses has always been of interest to biologists. In \nparticular thermal biologists\/ecologists are interested in how tolerance of \ntemperature varies between species and the effect this has on setting species \nrange boundaries and how species distribution patterns might be affected by \nclimate change (Reviewed in Somero 2002 and Hofmann 2005). \n \nA key tool in the investigation of stress tolerance has been the \ncharacterisation and monitoring of heat shock proteins. These are a family of \nhighly conserved proteins, which act as chaperones to stabilise and refold  \ndenatured proteins,  preventing the formation of cytotoxic aggregates (Parsell \n& Lindquist 1993, Hartl 1996, Fink 1999, Gross 2004). Numerous families of \nheat shock proteins have been identified, the naming of which is related to \ntheir weight in kiloDaltons. One such is the HSP70 (heat shock protein 70) \nfamily, which although up-regulated under different stress conditions is \n 3\nHSP_Limpet \nclassically associated with transcriptional up regulation in response to \nelevated environmental temperatures in most organisms studied to date.  \n \nThe induction and expression of these HSP70 genes is highly plastic. Levels of \ninduction are influenced by thermal history such as seasonal temperature \ncycling, vertical zonation and biogeography (reviewed in Somero 2002; \nHofmann 2005). Certainly prior exposure to slightly elevated temperatures \n(such as summer verses winter water temperatures) increases the \ntemperature at which the HSP70 genes are induced (Buckley et al 2001, \nTomanek 2002). Also the height of the vertical zonation of animals in the \nintertidal region does influence their heat shock thresholds (Halpin et al 2002, \nStillman 2002, Tomanek 2002). The animals in the studies described above \nare eurythermal. However this work has lead to great interest in the response \nof Antarctic marine organisms, which are highly stenothermal (Somero & \nDeVries 1967, Peck & Conway 2000, Peck 2002) and lose critical biological \nfunctions with temperature elevations of only 1-2\u00b0C above current summer \nmaximum seawater temperatures (0-1.8\u00b0C) (Peck et al 2004). \n \nThe first studies of heat shock responses in Antarctic marine ectotherms \nshowed that both microorganisms and fish did not increase HSP70 expression \nwhen warmed (Carrat\u00f9 et al 1998, Hofmann et al 2000). However, recent \ndata (Clark et al, in press) on the heat shock response of Antarctic marine \nmolluscs has shown that the classical heat shock response is initiated in the \nAntarctic limpet (Nacella concinna) at 15\u00baC and the Antarctic clam (Laternula \n 4\nHSP_Limpet \nelliptica) at 8\u00baC. Given that these are temperatures in excess of that which is \ncurrently experienced by these animals (Waller et al 2006), the obvious \nquestion to ask is whether these animals express HSP70 when subjected to \nlonger, lower levels of elevated temperatures in the natural environment or in \nresponse to multiple environmental insults? i.e. is there an environmental \ncontext to this response? \n \nN. concinna is an ideal candidate species with which to pose these questions. \nIt is a common Antarctic intertidal species and therefore regularly experiences \nperiods of acute stress when it is uncovered at low tide. Intertidal limpets \nwere collected on both sunny and cloudy days during the austral summer at \nSouth Cove, Rothera Point from the high water level over a complete tidal \ncycle. For comparative seasonal data, samples were also collected from the \nsame site at the end of spring. The temperatures of the air, water, limpet foot \nand shell were logged and muscle tissue assayed for the expression of \npreviously characterized inducible HSP70 genes. The objective of this study \nwas to take HSP70 genes, which are known to be up regulated in response to \ntemperature with a 15\u00b0C threshold temperature in laboratory experiments \nand identify their threshold limits in the field.  \n \n 5\nHSP_Limpet \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nAnimal sampling and experimental work  \nNacella conncina were collected from South Cove, Rothera Research Station, \nAdelaide Island (67 34 11S, 068 07 88W) during the austral summer (January \n2004) and the late spring, whilst there was still snow cover (November 2004). \nEach sample batch consisted of 5 animals. Control samples were collected \nusing SCUBA from subtidal populations (6M depth). Experimental (intertidal) \nsamples were collected from the mean mid-tide water level over a complete \ntidal cycle, and so subsequent batches experienced progressively longer \nexposure to air temperatures (5 collections were made for the sunny day, \nwhilst 6 collections were made for each of the cloudy and spring days). Hence \nbatch one were just exposed to air, batch two had one hours exposure and \nsubsequent batches at hourly intervals until they were re-immersed (see \nSupplemental Tables 2-4 for full details). Only one set of spring samples was \ncollected, but two batches of summer samples were collected under sunny \nand cloudy conditions on separate occasions; the air and water temperatures \nwere recorded (\u00b10.1oC) at each sampling point. Limpet shell and foot \ntemperatures were recorded to an accuracy of \u00b10.1oC in situ using a \nhandheld non-contact infrared thermometer (Supplemental Tables 1, 2, 3 and \n4). The shell temperature of the limpet was recorded prior to the animal \nbeing gently pried from the rock. After removal animals were carefully placed \nin the shade and the foot temperature, shell length, width and height and \n 6\nHSP_Limpet \nrecorded using vernier calipers (\u00b10.1mm). The shells were removed and a \nsmall (ca 200mg) sample of the foot muscle tissue placed in RNA later. These \nsamples were stored at 4oC overnight then at \u201380oC until required.  \n \nSample Analysis \nRNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted from N. concinna whole foot muscle \nusing TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u03bcg \nof total RNA was DNAse treated using 0.4U DNase I (Ambion) in 10mM \nDTT\/100mM MgCl2 buffer and reverse transcribed using a first strand \nsynthesis kit (Promega).  \n \nQ PCR: Species-specific HSP and actin sequences had been previously \ncharacterised (Clark et al, in press) and were amplified using the following \nprimer sets: HSP70A: Nco1F: ATTCGATGACGAGACGGTTCA and Nco1Rev2P: \nAACGTCTTCAATTCGCTTTTGTA. HSP70B: Nco3F: \nAGTTCACCGACGACACAGTAC; Nco3Rev: TATTTTAGTCTCTGATTTGTACTC. \nActin primers: NcoActinF: GAGAAATCGTCCGAGACATCAA; NcoActinRev4: \nCAGCAGATTCCATACCCAAGAA using Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR Master Mix \n(Stratagene) with Sure Start\u00ae Taq DNA polymerase and an MX3000P \n(Stratagene). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of \n95\u00b0C 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute with a final \ndissociation curve step as per manufacturers recommendations. The plate set-\nup for each Q-PCR experiment consisted of 5 control individuals and 5 \n\u201ctreated\u201d individuals amplified with a specific HSP primer set (designated Expt \n 7\nHSP_Limpet \n1) and an actin control primer set (designated Normaliser).  Each HSP and \nactin amplification was reproduced in triplicate. Each primer set was checked \nto ensure that no primer dimers were produced during the course of the \namplification reaction. RSq values and PCR efficiencies were checked over a \nfour fold 10x dilution series and the values calculated using the MxPro - \nMX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software (for RSq and efficiency details \nsee: Clark et al, in press). Amplifications were analysed using the MxPro - \nMX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software and Ct (dR) values exported \ninto Excel. Relative expression ratios of the HSP genes compared to the actin \nhousekeeping genes between the control and treated samples were derived \nusing the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) (http:\/\/www.gene-\nquantification.info\/)  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). This is an excel macro \nthat incorporates both a mathematical model to calculate relative expression \nratios on the basis of the PCR efficiency and crossing point derivation of the \ninvestigated samples and a two sided  Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation \nRandomisation Test. This test makes no assumptions about distribution (such \nas normality of distribution) and assumes that treatments were randomly \nallocated. The randomisation test repeatedly and randomly reallocates the \nobserved values to the two groups and notes the apparent effect (expression \nratio). The proportion of these effects, which are as great as that actually \nobserved in the experiment provides the p-value of the test. 2000 \nrandomisations were used in the test  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). These \nresults were then followed by further statistical analysis  (MINITAB v 14) \nusing a 2-way ANOVA to test for the significance of an effect of either gene or \n 8\nHSP_Limpet \nbatch number. Overall results for each primer pair under each sampling \nregime were subjected to a 2-sample t-test to assign significance of results \nfrom random variation. \n \n \nResults \n \nBoth heat shock protein genes (HSP70A and HSP70B) were induced under all \nintertidal conditions surveyed. A two way ANOVA of the 3 combined datasets \nshowed an effect of batch number (at the 10% level) (F4,4 = 2.48, p=0.77), \nbut no effect of gene (F1,4 = 1.54, p = 0.229). Analysing the datasets \nindividually using a 2 way ANOVA showed no effect of either gene or batch \nnumber for the sunny day samples (F1,4 = 3.01, p = 0.158; F4,4 = 1.03, p = \n0.49, respectively), although the individual p values for batches 1 and 2 for \nHSP70A were significant at the 10% level (Figure 1). The cloudy day samples \nshowed no effect of either gene or batch number (F1,4 = 6.19, p = 0.68; F4,4 \n= 2.56, p = 0.193, respectively), but again provided individually significant \nresults with batch 1 for HSP70A significant at the 5% level and levels of \nHSP70B significant at the 5% level (batch 4) and 10% level (batches 3 and 6) \n(Figure 2). The spring day samples showed no effect of either gene (F1,4 = \n2.55, p = 0.185), but showed an effect of batch at the 10% level (F4,4 = 4.62, \np = 0.084). An individually significant result at the 5% level was shown for \nHSP70B, batch 5 only (Figure 3). Within the three groups of samples relative \ngene expression levels varied from 27.70 \u2013 0.41 for HSP70A and 14.22 \u2013 3.90 \nfor HSP70B, with the highest relative expression levels for HSP70A being \n 9\nHSP_Limpet \nmore apparent at the early tidal cycle batches where the animals are just \nbecoming uncovered. \n \nThe average foot temperature of the sunny day animals was 3.3\u00b0C with an \nSD of 1.07 and a range of 4.6 (data from Supplemental Table 2). The average \nfoot temperature of the animals on a cloudy day was 3.8\u00b0C with an SD of \n1.26 and a range of 5.5 (data from Supplemental Table3). The spring \nsamples, whilst overall having a lower mean foot temperature of 2.1\u00b0C, \nshowed a much wider temperature range of 9.4\u00b0C, which is reflected in the \nhigher SD of 2.0 when compared to the other two samplings (data from \nSupplemental Table 4). In this sampling set, it was noted that some of the \nanimals that were taken were in the sun and therefore were exposed to \nhigher levels of solar radiation.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nPrevious experiments (Clark et al, in press) have indicated that N. concinna \nhas a 15\u00b0C induction threshold for the HSP70A and HSP70B genes. The data \npresented here shows that in the natural intertidal environment these genes \nare up regulated when the foot temperatures of the animals are only 3\u00b0C. \nHeat shock proteins were named initially because of their role in cellular \nprotection from heat stress but are, in fact, generalised stress proteins and \nare activated under several different conditions e.g. hypoxia, cadmium etc \n(reviewed in Sorensen et al 2003). Intertidal animals, in particular, have many \n 10\nHSP_Limpet \ndifferent environmental conditions to accommodate: periodic tidal emersion, \nchanges in temperature, desiccation, oxygen availability, humidity and \nultraviolet irradiation (Menge & Branch 2001). In Antarctica these stresses are \nenhanced by physical disturbance from ice, low temperature freezing and \nextreme seasonality of resource availability (Peck et al 2006). The overall \nstress load on intertidal limpets is, therefore great and it may be that the \ncombined stress is equivalent to the higher temperatures needed in the \nlaboratory to elicit a heat shock response (c.f. Halpin et al 2002, Todgham et \nal 2006).  \n \nOverall there is a statistically significant effect (at the 10% level) of batch \nindicating that tidal emersion and immersion play a role in the induction of \nheat shock genes in these animals. Comparing the individual p values and the \nANOVA analyses, there appears to be a difference in the relative expression \nlevels of HSP70A compared to HSP70B over the period of the tidal cycle, with \nHSP70A most highly expressed when the animals are first uncovered and \nsignificant results for HSP70B present in the latter half of the tidal cycle \n(when the animals are becoming covered again). This difference in expression \npattern between paralogous genes is not uncommon. The most parsimonious \nexplanation for the presence of two closely related HSP70 genes is a gene \nduplication event and maintenance of such duplicates is invariably by a \nprocess of sub-functionalisation (Force et al 1999), with each gene \nperforming a slightly different, but vital cellular function. Work is currently \nunderway in our laboratory to identify the triggers of HSP70 expression in \n 11\nHSP_Limpet \nthese animals, as factors other than heat are clearly involved given the HSP \nthreshold induction temperature of 15\u00b0C in Clark et al (in press). \n \nThe statistical significance of the results under the three different \nenvironmental conditions is confounded by high individual genetic variability \n(discussed in greater detail in Clark et al, in press). Hence care has to be \ntaken with the Q-PCR results and regarding the relative differences in gene \nexpression as an absolute figure. In reality, the data has to be examined \nmore globally and general trends extracted. Virtually all the different batches \nof animal collections show up-regulation of both HSP70A and HSP70B \nexpression. If this was a random event, 50% up-regulation and 50% down-\nregulation would be expected. These results are highly significant as shown \nby the results of the 2-sample t-tests. Therefore the environmentally sampled \nanimals do show significant up-regulation of both HSP70 genes compared to \nthe subtidal control animals, indicating higher endogenous levels of chronic \nstress. Subtidal animals were chosen as the controls as they inhabit a stable \nenvironment and were the animals shown to have an acute HSP threshold \ntemperature of 15\u00b0C. The tides at Rothera are normally limited to 0.8M and \ntherefore all animals in this zone will experience a wider range of \ntemperatures even when covered by water. \n \nFor decades it was considered that the Antarctic intertidal zone did not have \npermanent residents and species e.g. N. concinna were merely transient.  \nRecent intensive sampling has shown that in fact many diverse species occur \n 12\nHSP_Limpet \nthere and that some, again such as N. concinna, survive below the icefoot \ncovering the intertidal in winter (Waller et al 2006).  Although the long term \nmonitoring of air temperatures at Rothera shows variation between +5\u00b0C and \n-25\u00b0C, and seawater at 15m depth ranging from +1.8\u00b0C to \u20131.8\u00b0C (Figure 4A \nand B), microhabitat temperatures e.g. rock surfaces can differ considerably \nfrom this and the animals will be affected by zonation (figure 4C). Few marine \ninvertebrates are capable of colonising the high intertidal zone and surviving \nthere (Waller et al 2006), so N. concinna probably experiences amongst the \nwidest temperature ranges of any marine Antarctic endemic species (Barnes \net al 2006).  This is true for both subtidal and intertidal N. concinna due to its \nwide geographic and tidal range (Barnes et al 2006).  Therefore despite being \nan Antarctic endemic, the model organism we studied is in some ways \nextreme. \n \nWe have now shown that two very distantly related Antarctic molluscs (N. \nconcinna and L. elliptica) have the ability to up regulate HSPs (Clark et al, in \npress). We have extended these laboratory-based studies with an \ninvestigation of HSP expression in wild N. concinna. Which shows that the \ntemperature and expression levels of HSP production in wild animals cannot \nbe accurately predicted using experimentally induced acute heat shock \ntreatments (c.f. Lund et al 2002), especially in this case when considering the \nmuch more complex stresses of the intertidal zone. However, the controlled \nlaboratory based physiological experiments were essential for the cloning of \nthe genes and defining the nature of the heat shock response, particularly \n 13\nHSP_Limpet \nagainst a high background of inter-individual genetic variation. Our work on \nN. concinna has provided us with a methodology for identifying molecular \nstress markers in Antarctic molluscs and their validation in environmental \nmonitoring studies. These data take advantage of the intertidal ecosystem \nand demonstrate for the first time, the effective combination of field ecology \nand physiology in Polar research. \n 14\nHSP_Limpet \nReferences \n \nBarnes DKA, Fuentes V, Clarke A, Schloss IR, Wallace, M. 2006.
