INTRODUCTION\nTraffic flow may be viewed as an example of a driven\nmany particle system \u00031,2\u0004. Models based on probabilistic\ncellular automata have proven especially useful in the study\nof such systems and, in the context of traffic flow, have\nhelped our understanding of complex phenomena such as\njamming \u00033\u20138\u0004. Much of this work has relied extensively on\nsimulations and scaling arguments. By contrast, the number\nof exact analytic results known is comparatively small, al-\nthough there have been some notable successes, e.g., \u00034,6,8\u0004.\nExact results are always welcome, even for simple models,\nsince they provide a benchmark against which one can\ncompare the behavior of more complicated models.\nIn this paper we revisit the vmax=1 limit of a traffic model\nproposed by Nagel and Paczuski \u00035\u0004, itself a variant of the\nwidely studied model proposed by Nagel and Schreckenberg\n\u00033\u0004. The objective is to quantify in detail the statistics of a\nsingle jam initiated by the random perturbation of an other-\nwise freely flowing system. Although much is known already\nabout this model through the use of semiquantitative\nrandom-walk arguments \u00035,9\u0004, a complete analysis seems to\nbe lacking. The present paper seeks to address this, providing\nseveral interesting results in the process.\nAn important feature of the model is that it exhibits criti-\ncal behavior. Thus when the inflow to a given jam derives\nfrom the outflow of another jam, and both inflow and outflow\nare identical in a statistical sense, the jam lifetime distribu-\ntion P\u0001T\u0002 t\u0002 has a power-law tail. For the vmax=1 limit stud-\nied below the jams remain compact and do not branch,\nwhereupon the evolving jam length may be viewed as a ran-\ndom walk whose first-passage time defines the jam lifetime.\nSince P\u0001T\u0002 t\u0002\u0005 t\u22121\/2 for an unbiased random walk, this es-\ntablishes that the jam lifetime probability P\u0001T= t\u0002\u0005 t\u22123\/2 in\nthe critical state \u00035,9\u0004. At the qualitative level one may ex-\ntend this line of reasoning to consider other variables asso-\nciated with the jam. Thus since the typical excursion of an\nunbiased random walk at time t scales as t1\/2, the maximum\nlength of the jam during its lifetime should scale as\nL\u0005T1\/2. This suggests that P\u0001L\u0002 l\u0002\u0005 l\u22121 or P\u0001L= l\u0002\u0005 l\u22122 in\nthe critical state. Further, the jam mass, which is the inte-\ngrated vehicle waiting time of all the vehicles involved in the\njam during its lifetime, should scale as M\u0005\u00060Tt1\/2dt\u0005T3\/2.\nThis implies that P\u0001M\u0002m\u0002\u0005m\u22121\/3 or P\u0001M =m\u0002\u0005m\u22124\/3 in\nthe critical state. Such arguments are compelling and ulti-\nmately correct, but they are not entirely satisfactory. They\nare also difficult to generalize to the off-critical case, when\nthe jam is initiated in a traffic flow whose average vehicle\ndensity is above or below the critical value \u0001see below for\ndetails\u0002. This corresponds to the jam length executing a\nbiased rather than an unbiased random walk.\nIn what follows, exact results are obtained in relation to\nthe jam lifetime, the maximum jam length and the jam mass,\nin both the critical and the off-critical cases. This is achieved\nby mapping the model onto a discrete-time queueing system\nwhich is amenable to analysis using generating function\ntechniques \u000310\u0004. One benefit is that existing scaling results\nmay now be seen in their full and natural context. Among the\nresults presented, the off-critical behavior of the jam mass is\nshown to have a particularly nontrivial asymptotic form. This\nsuggests that further studies of this quantity would be\nwelcome for more complicated traffic models.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the model is\ndefined. In Sec. III, the jam lifetime probability is derived,\nfollowed by the maximum jam length probability. The near-\ncritical behavior of the expected maximum jam length is also\nidentified. A two-parameter probability generating function is\nthen introduced, which satisfies a given nonlinear functional\nequation, from which the asymptotic behavior of the jam\nmass probability can be ascertained. Finally, the results are\ndiscussed in Sec. IV.\nII. MODEL\nThe model is simple to define \u00035\u0004. Vehicles occupy sites\non an infinite one-dimensional lattice. Each vehicle has a\nspecified velocity v, which is either 0 or 1, and vehicles\nmove from left to right. At the start of a given time step the\nvelocity of each vehicle is updated, in parallel, according to\nthe following rules: \u0001i\u0002 If v=1 and the adjacent site to the\nright is empty, the velocity stays at v=1. \u0001ii\u0002 If the adjacent\nsite to the right is occupied, then the velocity is set to v=0.\n\u0001iii\u0002 If v=0 and the adjacent site to the right is empty, then*Electronic address: m.j.kearney@surrey.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 061115 \u00012006\u0002\n1539-3755\/2006\/74\u00016\u0002\/061115\u00016\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society061115-1\nthe velocity increases to v=1 with probability p, otherwise it\nstays at v=0. During the remainder of the time step the po-\nsition of each vehicle is then updated, in parallel, according\nto \u0001iv\u0002 The vehicle moves forward v steps. There are equiva-\nlent ways of representing the above rules which are more\ncompact, but not necessarily more clear. To set the model\ninto context, rule \u0001i\u0002 is the so-called cruise control limit of\nthe Nagel-Schreckenberg model with vmax=1 \u00033,5\u0004. This rule\ndistinguishes the model from the asymmetric exclusion pro-\ncess \u0001ASEP\u0002 with fully parallel dynamics, for which exact\nresults are known for both periodic \u00036\u0004 and open \u00038,11\u0004\nboundary conditions. Rule \u0001ii\u0002 prevents vehicles from crash-\ning, a generic feature of models with exclusion dynamics or\nhard-particle interactions. Rule \u0001iii\u0002 implies that vehicles are\nslow to start, a feature which also appears in different guises\nin other models \u00037,12,13\u0004. In the context of actual traffic\nflow, all these behavioral patterns are considered to be real-\nistic \u00031,2\u0004.\nA jam consists of a queue of motionless vehicles occupy-\ning adjacent sites, and we consider that a jam has resolved\nitself the instant all vehicles have been updated to v=1. To\nstudy the behavior of a single jam we choose an initial, free-\nflowing configuration of vehicles as follows. Moving along\nthe lattice from, say, left to right, sites are occupied with\nprobability p\u0001 if the preceding site is empty, else the site is\nleft empty, so that no two vehicles occupy adjacent sites. The\naverage density of vehicles is thus p\u0001 \/ \u00011+ p\u0001\u0002. Each vehicle\nis then assigned the value v=1. Such a configuration will\ncontinue to flow freely in the absence of external perturba-\ntions, so to initiate a traffic jam a vehicle is chosen at random\nand its velocity is set to zero. The lifetime of the resulting\njam is the time it takes until all the cars are flowing freely\nagain. An example is shown in Fig. 1.\nThere are two sources of randomness in the model. First,\nthe vehicle at the head of the jam accelerates away with\nprobability p, as specified by rule \u0001iii\u0002. Second, the choice of\ninitial configuration means that vehicles join the back of the\njam with probability p\u0001. One can equally well consider these\nvehicles to have originated from a large jam far to the left,\nwhere vehicles accelerate away with probability p\u0001 rather\nthan p. By such means one can study the off-critical behav-\nior, p\u0001\u0001p, as well as the critical behavior, p\u0001= p. Studies of\nthe expected jam lifetime in a similar model were presented\nin \u000313\u0004. It should be noted that a slightly different interpre-\ntation of when a jam has resolved itself was used in \u000313\u0004,\nalthough this has no bearing on the large scale asymptotic\nbehavior deduced in either case.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Jam lifetime\nAn alternative representation of the jam in Fig. 1 is shown\nin Fig. 2, wherein the queueing nature of the behavior is\nmade clear. The queue transition probabilities are given by\nP+= p\u0001q, P\u2212= pq\u0001, and P0= pp\u0001+qq\u0001, where q\u00071\u2212 p and\nq\u0001\u00071\u2212 p\u0001. Since the initial vehicle is stopped at time t=0\nwith probability 1, the probability of a lifetime-1 jam is\ngiven by P\u0001T=1\u0002= P\n\u2212\n, while the probability of a lifetime-2\njam is given by P\u0001T=2\u0002= P0P\u2212. For T\u00033 we have\nP\u0001T = t\u0002 = P0P\u0001T = t \u2212 1\u0002 + P+\b\nk=1\nt\u22122\nP\u0001T = t \u2212 1 \u2212 k\u0002P\u0001T = k\u0002 ,\n\u00011\u0002\nwhere the last term captures the fact that a length-2 jam must\nfirst become a length-1 jam before it finally resolves itself.\nSimilar ideas were presented in \u000314\u0004 based on the observa-\ntion that the evolving jam length traces a Motzkin path. From\nEq. \u00011\u0002, it is easy to show that the generating function\nG\u0001x\u0002\u0007\u0004tP\u0001T= t\u0002xt obeys\nG\u0001x\u0002 = P\n\u2212\nx + P0xG\u0001x\u0002 + P+xG\u0001x\u00022 \u00012\u0002\nso that\nG\u0001x\u0002 =\n1 \u2212 P0x \u2212 \t\u00011 \u2212 P0x\u00022 \u2212 4P+P\u2212x2\n2P+x\n. \u00013\u0002\nThe model admits, for certain parameter choices, the\npossibility of an infinite jam. This needs to be handled\nwith care. The probability of an infinite jam occurring is\nP\u0001T=\u0005\u0002\u00071\u2212limx\u21921G\u0001x\u0002. From Eq. \u00013\u0002 one finds that\nP\u0001T=\u0005\u0002=0 when p\u0001\u0006p; however, P\u0001T=\u0005\u0002=1\u2212 P\n\u2212\n\/ P+\u00020\nwhen p\u0001\u0002p.

The expected jam lifetime\ndiverges when p\u0001= p and evidently the line p\u0001= p is critical.\nFor x\u0007xc\u0007\u0001P0+2\tP+P\u2212\u0002\u22121 the right hand side of Eq. \u00013\u0002\nmay be expanded as a convergent power series in x whose\ncoefficients determine the lifetime probability P\u0001T= t\u0002 for\nt\u0007\u0005.

For example, as p\u0001\u21920\none finds that P\u0001T= t\u0002\u2192pqt\u22121. This, as expected, is the prob-\nability that the initially stopped vehicle will start moving\nagain in exactly t steps, thus ending the jam. What is of\nparticular interest, however, is the asymptotic behavior as\nt\u2192\u0005 in the neighborhood of the critical line, such that\n\fp\u2212 p\u0001\f\u0007\t where \t is suitably small.

It then follows from Eq. \u00015\u0002\nthat in the neighborhood of the critical line as t\u2192\u0005\nP\u0001T = t\u0002 \u0005\n1\n\t4\npq\nt\u22123\/2 exp\u000e\u2212 \fp \u2212 p\u0001\f24pq t\u000f . \u00018\u0002\nThus one observes the expected power law scaling P\u0001T= t\u0002\n\u0005 t\u22123\/2 on the critical line itself \u00035\u0004. Slightly off the critical\nline this is augmented by a simple exponential decay con-\ntrolled by a cutoff time tco\u00114pq \/ \fp\u2212 p\u0001\f2, a scaling which\nwas also identified in \u00035\u0004. The present analysis, however,\ngoes further in that Eq. \u00015\u0002 is universally valid. It is worth\nstating that well away from the critical line tco will be small,\nwhereupon large finite jams are very rare. Of course, when\np\u0001\u0002p there is a nonzero probability of finding a jam whose\nlifetime is infinite.\nB. Maximum jam length\nThe maximum length attained by the jam during its life-\ntime is given by the random variable L\u0007max\u0012N\u0001t\u0002 : t\n=0,1 , . . . ,T\u0013, where N\u0001t\u0002 is the number of vehicles in the jam\nat time t. Thus L is the extremum of a set of strongly corre-\nlated random variables, a subject of interest in many other\ncontexts also; see, e.g., \u000317\u0004. It is actually quite straightfor-\nward to derive the maximum jam length probability\nP\u0001L= l\u0002. Let P\u02c6 \u0001l \fn\u0002 be the probability that a jam, whose ini-\ntial length n\u00020, never grows to be larger than some fixed\nvalue l, i.e., P\u02c6 \u0001l \fn\u0002\u0007P\u0001L\u0006 l \fn\u0002. The strategy is to solve for\ngeneral n and then set n=1 since the jam starts with a single\nvehicle stopping. The Markov nature of the process implies a\nsimple backward recursion for P\u02c6 \u0001l \fn\u0002;\nP\u02c6 \u0001l\fn\u0002 = P\n\u2212\nP\u02c6 \u0001l\fn \u2212 1\u0002 + P0P\u02c6 \u0001l\fn\u0002 + P+P\u02c6 \u0001l\fn + 1\u0002 \u00019\u0002\nwith boundary conditions P\u02c6 \u0001l \f0\u0002=1 and P\u02c6 \u0001l \f l+1\u0002=0.

If Nv denotes the total\nnumber of vehicles that participate in the jam throughout its\nlifetime, it is relatively easy to show that \nNv\u000b= p \/ \u0001p\u2212 p\u0001\u0002 for\np\u0001\u0007p. The stronger divergence of \nNv\u000b as p\u0001\u2192p as com-\npared to \nL\u000b emphasizes the fact that, typically, Nv\u000eL for\nlarge jams. In other words, many more vehicles will typically\npass through a large jam during its lifetime than will be\nfound in the jam at any one time.\nC. Jam mass\nThe jam mass is a considerably more difficult quantity to\nevaluate than either the jam lifetime or the maximum jam\nlength. The jam mass is defined to be the size of the space-\ntime cluster associated with the stationary vehicles, as shown\nin Fig. 1. It is equivalent to the integrated waiting time of all\nthe vehicles involved in the jam as shown in Fig. 2, which\nestablishes its relevance. To make progress, consider the\nprobability P\u0001t ,m\u0002 that a given jam has lifetime T= t and\nmass M =m. Related to P\u0001t ,m\u0002 we have a two-parameter\ngenerating function G\u0001x ,y\u0002 such that\nG\u0001x,y\u0002 \u0007 \b\nt,m\nP\u0001t,m\u0002xtym. \u000116\u0002\nOne can show, based on the analysis of the discrete-time\nqueueing system presented in \u000310\u0004, that G\u0001x ,y\u0002 obeys a\nnonlinear functional equation,\nG\u0001x,y\u0002 = P\n\u2212\nxy + P0xyG\u0001x,y\u0002 + P+xyG\u0001x,y\u0002G\u0001xy,y\u0002 .\n\u000117\u0002\nThe derivation of Eq. \u000117\u0002 draws inspiration from the study\nof a number of problems in lattice combinatorics; see, e.g.,\n\u000318,19\u0004, and in particular is intimately related to the enu-\nmeration of staircase polygons \u000320\u201323\u0004. It should be noted\nthat the jam lifetime probability, P\u0001T= t\u0002\u0007\u0004mP\u0001t ,m\u0002, has the\ngenerating function G\u0001x ,1\u0002\u0007G\u0001x\u0002, upon which Eq. \u000117\u0002\nreduces to Eq. \u00012\u0002 in a satisfying way.\nThe jam mass probability, P\u0001M =m\u0002\u0007\u0004tP\u0001t ,m\u0002, on the\nother hand, has the generating function G\u00011,y\u0002, which is\nmuch harder to determine. Indeed, the formal solution of Eq.\n\u000117\u0002 for G\u00011,y\u0002, expressible in terms of q series \u000321\u0004, is\nhopelessly complicated as regards trying to determine\nP\u0001M =m\u0002 exactly. This is despite the fact that one can easily\nderive the expected jam mass \nM\u000b exactly from Eq. \u000117\u0002, in\nconjunction with Eq. \u00013\u0002, namely \nM\u000b\u0007\f\u0002G\u00011,y\u0002 \/\u0002y\fy=1\n= pq\u0001 \/ \u0001p\u2212 p\u0001\u00022 for p\u0001\u0007p.\nIt is possible, however, to identify the asymptotic form of\nG\u00011,y\u0002 as y\u21921\u2212, from which the asymptotic form of\nP\u0001M =m\u0002 as m\u2192\u0005 may be determined.

Nor can one \u201cderive\u201d the scaling\nbehavior of Eq. \u000127\u0002 starting from Eq. \u00018\u0002, although assum-\ning the \u201cplausible\u201d scaling M\rLT\r \fp\u2212 p\u0001\fT2 does at least\nhint at the origin of the stretched-exponential tail seen in Eq.\n\u000127\u0002. The long-tailed nature of Eq. \u000127\u0002 has implications for\nthe likelihood of occurrence of jams which have a large mass\nor a large integrated vehicle waiting time. Thus even in this,\nthe simplest of models, the off-critical behavior for this\nquantity is highly nontrivial.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe model studied in this paper is simplistic, and prob-\nably too simplistic to be truly representative of real traffic\nscenarios. For example, one may legitimately argue that one\nloses something essential by having a model in which the\njams are forced to remain compact. The results should, how-\never, hint at what one might expect to find in more realistic\nsituations. For the jam lifetime probability and the maximum\njam length probability it has been possible to find exact re-\nsults valid over the whole p , p\u0001 domain, given by Eqs. \u00015\u0002\nand \u000111\u0002 respectively. One interesting finding is the logarith-\nmic divergence of the expected maximum jam length, Eq.\n\u000115\u0002.\nFor the more complicated jam mass probability it has not\nbeen possible to find a solution valid over the whole p , p\u0001\ndomain. However, it has been possible to determine the exact\nasymptotic behavior as m\u2192\u0005 for the critical case, Eq. \u000123\u0002,\nand for the near-critical case, Eq. \u000127\u0002, and in many respects\nthis asymptotic regime is the most important one. The behav-\nior is far from trivial and it would be interesting to see how\nthis manifests itself in more complicated models, accepting\nthat there is no universal definition of jam mass that is ap-\nplicable to every model. It seems clear, however, that the\nconcept of an integrated vehicle waiting time is a useful one\nand, based on the findings for this simple model, it should\nprovide additional insights into the behavior of traffic jams\nbeyond that which can be simply deduced from, say, the jam\nlifetime alone. Certainly from an operational point of view\nthe integrated vehicle waiting time is a useful parameter with\nwhich to characterize the associated cost and inconvenience\nof traffic jams.\nAs a final remark, the asymptotic scalings given above are\nbroadly insensitive to the discrete nature of the model and\ntheir functional form may therefore be studied by consider-\ning the first-passage process for a drifted Brownian motion\n\u000324\u0004. This does not, however, detract from the merits of hav-\ning a direct solution of the cellular automaton model, which\nis the primary motivation for the present work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Satya Majumdar for useful\ndiscussions during a stay at the Isaac Newton Institute for\nMathematical Sciences, where part of this work was carried\nout.\nEXACTLY SOLVABLE CELLULAR AUTOMATON TRAFFIC\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 061115 \u00012006\u0002\n061115-5\n\u00031\u0004 D.
