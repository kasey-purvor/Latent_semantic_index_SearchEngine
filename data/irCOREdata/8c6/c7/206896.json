It focuses in particular on quality, availability and affordability \nand in so doing explores issues of equity.  It will be argued that whilst overall levels of pre-school \neducational provision have increased, there are still not enough places, costs are too high for some and \nthe quality is variable.  In the light of research evidence indicating greater cognitive and social \nprogress in certain types of pre-school provision, it is argued that there is a particular need to improve \naccess to such forms of provision as they can enhance the educational and social outcomes of children \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds.  A number of policy changes are proposed in order to enhance the \nquality, availability and affordability of pre-school education for children from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThis paper is concerned with pre-school education policy in England and changes that have been \nintroduced since the Labour Government was elected into office in 1997.  Early Childhood Education \nand Care (ECEC) has had a high policy profile under the Labour Government and there have been \nsignificant improvements in terms of access and provision.  However, it is argued that these have been \ninsufficient to ensure that an adequate supply of affordable, high quality pre-school educational \nprovision is available to meet the needs of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \n \nHistorically, pre-school educational provision in England has been patchy and diverse with little \noverall planning.  This is in marked contrast to the compulsory school system.  Institutional education \nproviders for children under statutory school age\n1\n are varied and comprise bodies in the public, private \nand voluntary (non-profit) sectors.  It is important to note that pre-school education is inter-related \nwith day care, as both provide care and learning experiences for children below compulsory school \nage: \u2018There is no clear and logical dividing line between them, as both must secure and promote \nchildren\u2019s healthy physical, emotional and intellectual development\u2019 (Acheson, 1998, p. 3).  Providers \nare varied and have differing characteristics.  Nursery school, nursery class and infant class (part of \nprimary schools)\n2\n provision is restricted to term-time only.  Although a full school day is offered in \nprimary schools and some nursery schools, this is not generally the case with nursery classes or pre-\nschool groups (or playgroups), which offer a morning or afternoon session.  Full day care all the year \nround is offered in day nurseries; these are run by local authority social services departments (for \nchildren identified as being \u2018at risk\u2019) or by private and voluntary bodies, so catering for the needs of \nworking parents (notably mothers). \n \nThe high policy profile of pre-school education in the UK can be traced back to the nursery voucher \nscheme introduced by the Conservative Government following the 1996 Nursery Education and Grant \nMaintained Schools Act.  This began as a pilot scheme in 1996-97 in four local authorities in \nEngland,\n3\n setting a precedent in relation to pre-school education as an entitlement (Sparkes and West, \n1998).  It was extended to all LEAs in 1997-98.  Under the nursery voucher scheme parents of eligible \nchildren were invited to apply for vouchers, which were used to \u2018purchase\u2019 a free part-time pre-school \neducation place for their child.  Parents who exchanged vouchers in private or voluntary sectors were \nable to \u2018top up\u2019 the voucher with their own resources if higher fees were charged, for the part-time \n 3 \nplace or for a full-time, all year round place.  The Labour Government that was elected into office in \nMay 1997 was committed to ending the scheme and did so in April 1998 (HM Treasury, 1997).   \n \nSoon after the election of the Labour Government the Equal Opportunities Minister announced that a \nNational Childcare Strategy would be introduced (DfEE, 1997).  According to the subsequent Green \nPaper, \u2018Meeting the childcare challenge\u2019: \n \nA National Childcare Strategy matters to children, parents and employers.  For too long, the \nUK has lagged behind in developing good quality, affordable and accessible childcare.  The \napproach taken by previous Governments to the formal childcare sector has been to leave it \nalmost exclusively to the market (DfEE, 1998, pp. 5-6). \n \nThree specific problems were identified, namely that the quality of childcare was variable; the cost of \ncare meant that it was too high for many parents; and there were not enough childcare places in some \nareas.  In particular, the Green Paper stated: \n \n[It is the] Government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that parents have access to services to enable \nthem to make genuine choices.  This means good quality, affordable childcare for parents who \nwish to work outside the home (p. 6). \n \nThrough the National Childcare Strategy and working in partnership, the Government will \nprovide the framework within which good quality, affordable childcare is developed across the \ncountry (p. 7).   \n \nIt is important to stress that the focus of the National Childcare Strategy has been on \u2018strengthening \nearly years education provision\u2019 (Lewis, 2003, p. 226).  \n \nThis paper examines the extent to which the key Government objectives of increasing the quality, \naffordability and availability of childcare have been achieved, by means of an analysis of policy \ndocuments, research studies and official statistics.  The following section addresses the policy and \nfunding mechanisms for pre-school educational provision since the introduction of the National \nChildcare Strategy.  Section 3 then explores quality and regulation in the pre-school educational \nsector.  Section 4 follows with an analysis of changes in participation and availability of places; in so \ndoing issues of equity, including affordability are explored.  The final section discusses the main \nthemes to emerge and their implications for policy, in the light of three key Government objectives in \nrelation to Early Childhood Education and Care, namely improving quality, availability and \naffordability. \n \n2. Policy and funding \n \nWith the introduction of the National Childcare Strategy, the Labour Government made significant \nchanges to the organisation of early years provision (see Lewis, 2003).  For the first time, a local \nsystem of planning was introduced to try and ensure that there was adequate provision to meet \ndemand, with each Local Education Authority (LEA) being required to set up an Early Years \nDevelopment and Childcare Partnership (EYDCP).  A number of initiatives targeted more specifically \non children living in poverty were also introduced.  The Sure Start programme, for example, involved \nas one of its key facets an increase in the availability of childcare places (Sure Start, 2004a), together \n 4 \nwith a variety of new types of provision, including Children\u2019s Centres and Early Excellence Centres, \nintegrating education and care in deprived areas.   \n   \nSince 1998, all four year olds have been entitled to receive a free part-time nursery education place for \nthe three terms before they reach statutory school age (i.e. the term after they reach five years of age); \nfurther, since April 2004, all three years olds have been entitled to the same level of provision (DfES \nand DWP, 2003a).  The funding scheme introduced by the Labour Government comprised a quasi-\nvoucher with a set value, to be paid to registered pre-school education providers for every eligible \nthree and four-year-old in attendance.  One of the key differences with the previous scheme is that \nthere is no \u2018voucher\u2019 or \u2018coupon\u2019 for parents to give to the provider.4  There is no automatic \nentitlement to a place at a particular pre-school \u2013 the onus is on the parent (usually the mother) to find \nout if their chosen provider has a place available for their child.     \n \nSince 2003-04, funding for the education of three and four year olds has been allocated to local \nauthorities through a block grant (Revenue Support Grant) from central government for local services \n(West and Pennell, 2003).  Funds for pre-school education are distributed via the Education Formula \nSpending Share (EFSS).  Formula spending for nursery education comprises a basic amount of \nfunding per pupil to which are added \u2018top ups\u2019 relating to the LEA\u2019s local circumstances \n(disadvantage, costs) (DfES, 2004a).  In 2003-04, funding was available via EFSS to give each \nauthority \u2018a minimum level of funding for each three year old place of \u00a3416 per term (\u00a31248 per \nannum\u2019 (DfES and DWP, 2003a, p. 19).5  The LEA distributes funds for free places to pre-school \neducation providers based on the number of eligible children attending the particular setting (DfES, \n2004a). There is thus a \u2018quasi-voucher\u2019 system in operation with providers receiving higher levels of \nfunding the greater the number of children registered. \n \nThe funding covers five sessions of nursery education per week, each session amounting normally to \n2.5 hours a day for 33 weeks of the year.  This minimum entitlement is free.  Whilst parents of a child \nwho is eligible for a free place do not pay for this, if the child attends a provider that normally charges \nfees, \u2018the fees charged should be reduced accordingly so that the basis entitlement is free at the point \nof delivery\u2019 (DfES, 2004a, p. 16).  There are, nonetheless, circumstances in which \u2018top up\u2019 is allowed: \nparents \u2018will be expected to pay for any care received which exceeds the free entitlement\u2019 (DfES, \n2004a, p. 14). \n \nWhilst the Government now funds free part-time pre-school educational provision, there are also \nadditional government funds available in the form of the Working Tax Credit (WTC) to assist with \nfees for pre-school education.  The WTC is available for parents who are in employment, but on low \nincomes and the childcare element meets 70% of childcare costs with a registered provider.  For 2004-\n05, the costs were up to a maximum of \u00a3135 per week for one child (in which case \u00a394.50 would be \nthe maximum amount of tax credit payable) or \u00a3200 for two or more children (\u00a3140 would be \npayable) (see Inland Revenue, 2004).  According to the Inland Revenue, which has monitored the take \nup of WTC, in October 2003, the average amount of financial aid received was \u00a350 per week and one \nthird of families benefiting were reported to be \u2018the poorest families, receiving the maximum level of \nsupport\u2019 (National Audit Office (NAO), 2004, p. 35).  Students in higher education with dependent \nchildren may also be eligible for a childcare grant based on actual childcare costs \u2013 although in this \ncase, for one child up to \u00a3114.75 a week (85% of the actual costs of up to \u00a3135 a week) is payable \nthroughout the year, or \u00a3170 a week for two children (DfES, 2004b).\n6\n   However, it is important to \nacknowledge that in 2004, the average cost of a nursery place for a child over two years was \u00a3123 a \nweek and in inner London it was even higher at \u00a3149 (Daycare Trust, 2004).  \n 5 \n3. \u2018Quality\u2019 and regulation  \nRegulation and quality \nRegulation, in the English context, is seen as a means of assuring quality in the pre-school education \nmarket: \u2018Regulation of childcare ensures that childcare providers operate in accordance with \nminimum quality standards to make sure that children are safe and well looked after\u2019 (HM Treasury, \n2004b p. 24). \n \nThe Labour Government has strengthened regulation (and quasi-regulation via guidance) and there is \nnow a \u2018Code of Practice on the Provision of Free Nursery Education Places for Three to Four Year \nOlds\u2019 to which LEAs must have regard (the first Code was introduced along with the Education Act \n2002).  This provides guidance for EYDCPs and providers of early years education places (DfES, \n2004a).  Each LEA is required to keep an up-to-date directory of all providers not maintained by the \nauthority that are eligible to claim funding for the provision of free nursery education places (DfES, \n2004a, p. 9) and also to attach conditions to the financial assistance they pay to providers of free \nnursery education (e.g. in relation to the duration of sessions, inspection).     \n \nUnder the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, nursery education for which government \nfunding has been received, is required to be inspected by the regulatory body, the Office for Standards \nin Education (Ofsted).  Following an inspection, providers must produce an action plan outlining how \nthey intend to address any issues raised.  Where provision is judged unacceptable, the provider is \nallowed either six months to improve provision, or the LEA is advised by Government to remove the \nprovider from the directory and withdraw funding (see DfES, 2004a).  \n \nThere are also regulations specifying the child to adult ratio in pre-school educational provision.  For \nreception classes (catering for children aged four to five years) the maximum class size is 30.\n7\n  For \nnursery classes, the regulations specify a ratio is 13 to 1 and for nursery schools 10 to 1.  In non-\nschool settings for three to five year olds, the required ratio is 8 to 1 (DfES and DWP, 2003b).  \nRegulation is thus not consistent across providers, even though funding, at least in terms of the quasi-\nvoucher funding mechanism, is (within a given EYDCP).  Nor are regulations regarding staff \nqualifications consistent with qualified teachers not necessarily being employed except in nursery \nschools, nursery classes and  reception classes.\n8\n \n \nIn addition, to these \u2018structural\u2019 regulatory mechanisms, the curriculum has also been subject to \nchange.  In September 2000, the Foundation Stage was introduced for children aged three to five years \nand the Education Act 2002 extended the National Curriculum to include this stage.  This focuses on \npersonal, social and emotional development; communication, language and literacy; mathematical \ndevelopment; knowledge and understanding of the world; physical development and creative \ndevelopment.  For each area there are also \u2018learning goals\u2019 (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, \n2004).  Thus, there is a degree of regulation in terms of what is taught.  \n \n\u2018Quality\u2019 and pre-school education \nWhilst regulation might be seen as a form of \u2018quality assurance\u2019, there are different conceptualisations \nof quality.  It is not possible to do justice to the large body of research that has addressed this issue \n(see Mooney, Cameron, Candappa, McQuail, Moss and Petrie, 2003; OECD, 2001; Tanner et al., \n2005) but it is clear that the concept of \u2018quality\u2019 is elusive.  As Mooney et al. (2003) note: \u2018To \ndistinguish between good and poor practice we need to know what quality is.  Yet there is no single, \n 6 \nuniversal definition\u2019 (p. 7).  The concept is subjective and not objective, depending as it does on the \nperceptions of stakeholders: \n \nConcepts of quality differ across countries and according to the priorities, visions, and \nperspectives of different stakeholder groups \u2013 national and local government authorities, \nparents, children, employers and providers\u2019 (OECD, 2001, p. 63). \n \nMuch early years empirical research has focused on quality issues in the USA and has been concerned \nwith the impact of non-parental care on the intellectual, social and emotional development of children \n(see Mooney et al., 2003).  A Cochrane Review of day care for pre-school children (Zoritch, Roberts, \nand Oakley, 2004), reviewed eight randomised controlled trials, involving over 2000 children \nrandomly allocated to receive day care or to a control group, which did not receive day care (see \nZoritch et al., 2004 for details).  All of the studies were carried out in the USA, with most of them \ntargeting families from lower socio-economic groups and all except for one involving children of \nAfrican American origin only.  The studies were explicitly concerned with the attainment of basic \ncognitive concepts, and many emphasised the development of language.  As a result of participation in \nday care, IQ increased.  However, this effect appeared to decrease within two years of the intervention \nin most of the studies reviewed.  Tests of reading, writing, mathematics and general knowledge were \nused to assess educational outcomes, along with other measures.  This information was available for \nsix of the eight studies and all, except for one, showed persistent differences in favour of the day care.  \nOne of the studies, the Perry Pre-School project, collected data over several years; these data related \nto almost all of the 128 children originally recruited to the study.  More of the experimental group had \njobs at the age of 19; more were attending college or job-training programmes; fewer were in receipt \nof welfare assistance; had experienced a teenage pregnancy; or had been arrested for criminal acts \n(Schweinhart, Barnes and Weikart, 1993).  The difference was present at the age of 27 years: more of \nthe experimental group had graduated from high school, they had half as many arrests, higher \nearnings, and less dependence on welfare assistance (Schweinhart et al., 1993).   \n \nOther American research has used a quasi-experimental approach.  Studies have found that \nparticipation in Head Start, an intervention programme to improve the outcomes of children from \ndisadvantaged families, has been associated with short-term improvements in cognitive development \nalthough often these \u2018appeared to \u2018fade out\u2019 after a few years\u2019 (Melhuish, 2004, p.18); there is also \nsome evidence that this is associated with the experiences for African American children as opposed \nto white children and that this may be attributable to African American children who attended Head \nStart going to \u2018lower quality\u2019 schools than other African American children, which was not found for \nwhite children (Melhuish, 2004). \n \nAlthough these studies were all carried out in the USA and are not necessarily generalisable to an \nEnglish context, they offer some evidence about the potential for pre-school education to have a \npositive effect on children\u2019s later outcomes (see also Melhuish, 2004).  It is also important to stress \nthat these research studies were targeted specifically on children from lower socio-economic groups.  \nFrom the point of view of equity there are sound grounds for such a policy focus given the strong \nassociations between disadvantage and poorer educational outcomes.  In England, the Effective \nProvision of Pre-school Education project, a major longitudinal research study of young children\u2019s \ndevelopment, has investigated the effects of pre-school education (Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Elliot, \nSiraj-Blatchford and Taggart, 2001, 2003b; Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj-Blatchford, Taggart and \nElliot, 2003a; Sammons, Elliot, Sylva, Melhuish, Siraj-Blatchford and Taggart, 2004; Sylva, \nMelhuish, Sammons, Siraj-Blatchford and Taggart, 2004).  In its early stages, the research involved \n 7 \nexamining the associations between a range of personal, family and home environment characteristics \nand cognitive attainment of children aged around three years at entry to pre-school.  It was found that \nsocio-economic background was highly significant even at three years of age: children whose fathers \nwere in professional or managerial work had higher scores than those whose fathers were in partly or \nunskilled manual work (Sammons, Sylva, Melhuish, Siraj-Blatchford, Taggart, Smees, Dobson, \nJeavons, Lewis, Morahan and Sadler, 1999). \n \nIn England, as in the USA, there is a focus on \u2018quality\u2019 construed in terms of educational outputs and \noutcomes.  However, the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education project focused on both \nprocesses and outputs (see Sylva et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004; Sammons et al., 2004).  The pre-school \nproviders included maintained nursery schools and nursery classes, local authority day nurseries, \nintegrated centres (providing both education and care), private day nurseries and playgroups.  A \nsample of children with no, or minimal, pre-school experience was also selected; these children had \nexperienced less than 50 hours at a pre-school centre before entering primary school (Sammons et al., \n2004). \n \nOne of the key findings was that pre-school education can help to ameliorate the effects of \ndisadvantage.  Children with no pre-school experience had lower levels of attainment (having \ncontrolled for background factors related to the child, parent and home learning environment) \ncompared with children who had experienced varying durations of pre-school provision (Sammons et \nal., 2004).  The impact of the duration of pre-school was also investigated, using the categories of:  no \nexperience, up to one year, one to two years, two to three years and over three years.  It was found that \nin general, \u2018the longer a child was in a target pre-school centre, the stronger the positive impact on \nattainment\u2019 (Sammons et al., 2004, p. 702).  However, there was no evidence that full day attendance \nwas associated with greater gains than half day attendance (Sylva et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004). \n  \nThe research also found that having controlled for background factors, the type of pre-school provider \nattended affected progress: \n \n\u2026integrated centres (these are centres that fully combine education with care) and nursery \nschools tend to promote better intellectual outcomes for children.  Similarly, integrated centres \nand nursery classes tend to promote better social development even after taking account of \nchildren\u2019s background and prior social behaviour (Sylva et al., 2003a p. 3). \n \nIt was also noted that integrated centres and nursery school provision had the \u2018highest scores on pre-\nschool quality, while playgroups, private day nurseries and local authority centres [had] lower scores\u2019 \n(Sylva et al., 2004, p. iv).    \n \nThere was, moreover, a significant positive association between the \u2018quality\u2019 of the provider, as \nassessed through observations using standardised rating scales, and outcomes.  In addition, a positive \nrelationship was found between ratings of the quality of the pre-school provision and the qualification \nlevels of staff employed by the provider (Sylva et al., 2003a, 2003b).  The research found that the \nhigher the qualifications of the pre-school staff and in particular those of the manager, the greater the \nprogress of children attending the provider (Sylva et al., 2003a): \n \nHaving qualified trained teachers working with children in pre-school settings\u2026had the \ngreatest impact on quality, and was linked specifically with better outcomes in pre-reading and \nsocial development\u2019 (p.4).   \n 8 \n \nSimilar findings have been found by Zill et al. (2003) in the Head Start Family and Child Experiences \nSurvey (FACES), a study of a national random sample of Head Start programmes.  The results \nshowed that:  \n \nHead Start teachers with higher levels of educational attainment, and with more years of \nteaching experience overall, were more likely to have knowledge and positive attitudes about \nearly childhood education practices, which subsequently influenced classroom quality (p. 1). \n \nThese findings are important given that in England there is no requirement for all types of pre-school \nproviders to have qualified teachers on their staff.  Staff qualifications vary markedly depending on \nthe type of provider.  In 2002\/03, as shown in Table 1, around a third of paid staff in pre-schools and \nplaygroups and a fifth of those in day nurseries had no qualifications related to working with children \nor young people; this compared with around one in ten of those in primary schools with nursery and \nreception classes (12%) and nursery schools (8%) (MORI 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d). \n \nTable 1 Percentage of paid staff with no qualifications related to working with children or \nyoung people (2002\/03 or 2003) \n \nType of provider  % of paid staff with no \nrelevant qualifications \nPlaygroups and pre-schools 34 \nDay nurseries and other full day care provision 20 \nPrimary schools with nursery and reception classes 12 \nNursery schools 8 \nSource MORI 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d \n \nWhilst one conceptualisation of quality focuses on outcomes as an indicator, there are other indicators \nof quality.  They could, for example, include meeting the needs of parents for affordable care outside \nthe home, providing a safe environment and so on.  \u2018Narrowly defined developmental outcomes are \nnot the primary goal of services in the Nordic countries, such as Denmark, nor in parts of Italy\u2026\u2019 \n(Mooney et al., 2003, p. 8).   \n \nPerceptions of quality by different stakeholders may also be considered relevant in the context of \ndebates about quality (see Mooney et al., 2003).  A large-scale\n9\n DfES-funded survey of parents of \nthree to five year olds asked about perceptions of the quality of pre-school providers (Bell and Finch, \n2004).  This revealed that the proportion rating the quality of education at the main or sole provider as \n\u2018excellent\u2019 was 42% (this was significantly higher than in 1997 when it stood at 35%).  However, \nthere was variation in terms of the type of provider used with only 36% of parents reporting that \nprovision in playgroups\/pre-schools was \u2018excellent\u2019 compared with 50% of nursery school users. \n \nJudgments of \u2018quality\u2019 are also part of the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) inspection \nregime.  Its 1999-2000 report (Ofsted, 2000) noted that much needed to be done to improve the \nquality of provision for language and literacy and for mathematics in order for three and four year olds \nto get the \u2018best possible foundation\u2019 (p. 3) before they start school.  Particular concerns were raised in \nconnection with playgroups.  However, a later report (Ofsted, 2001), relating to 2000-01, noted \n\u2018considerable improvement\u2019 (p. 7).  This ties in with the findings of Bell and Finch (2004) who found \n 9 \nthat the percentage of parents rating playgroups or pre-schools as \u2018excellent\u2019 was significantly higher \nin 2002 than in 1997 (36% versus 22%). \n \nIn short, the literature reveals that there is variation in terms of the \u2018quality\u2019 of provision on offer in \nthe pre-school education market, with, in England, particular concerns being raised about certain types \nof provision. \n4. Participation, availability and affordability  \n \nA number of different studies have explored participation in pre-school education and changes since \n1997.  Participation is clearly linked to both availability and to affordability.  Large scale surveys \ncarried out on behalf of the DfES (Blake, Finch, McKernan and Hinds, 2001; Fitzgerald, Finch, Blake, \nPerry and Bell, 2002; Bell and Finch, 2004) have revealed that overall participation in pre-school \neducation among three and four year olds increased significantly between 1997 and 2002 from 92% to \n96%.  However, the overall statistics mask stark variation in participation by children from families \nwith different income levels. Thus, Bell and Finch (2004) found that amongst children classified as \n\u2018younger\u2019 three year olds, participation was lower among those from households earning less than \n\u00a310,000 than those earning \u00a330,000 or more a year (77% versus 95% in the previous week).\n10\n   They \nalso found that participation was higher amongst white children than amongst those from minority \nethnic groups (96% versus 92% in the previous week); for younger three year olds the difference was \neven more marked \u2013 88% versus 79%.  In this context it is noteworthy that 70% of ethnic minorities \nlive in the 88 most deprived local authority districts compared with 40% of the general population \n(Social Exclusion Unit, 2004).  Some of these areas are not well served by pre-school educational \nprovision.\n11\n  \n \nBetween 1997 and 2002, parents reported that overall provision had increased; whilst in 1997, 54% of \nrespondents felt that there were too few places providing nursery education in the local area, this \nfigure was 51% in 2002 (Blake et al., 2001; Bell and Finch, 2004).  Nevertheless, the fact that half of \nthose surveyed felt that there were too few places, suggests that the current policy has not yet \nsucceeded in meeting demand.  Given the differing participation rates between parents from minority \nethnic groups and white parents, it is perhaps not surprising to learn that the former were more likely \nto report that there were insufficient nursery education places in the local area (56% versus 50%). \n \nThere have also been changes in terms of the types of providers attended by three and four year old \nchildren.  The free funding of places for four year olds (extended to three year olds in 2004) has \nresulted in certain types of provision expanding markedly as shown in Tables 2 and 3 (DfES, 2003a). \n 10 \nTable 2 Percentage of three year olds in differing types of early years education provider \n(1)  \n \nType of provider 2000 2003 \n Number % of population Number % of population \nPrivate and voluntary providers (2) 268,800 44 323,900 56 \nNursery schools and nursery classes \n(3) \n228,400 37 216,200 37 \nIndependent schools  25,900 4 26,800 5 \nOthers (4) 3,800 - 4,400 - \nAll providers 526,900 86 571,300 99 \nNotes \n1.

By way of contrast, the percentage of those attending \nnursery schools or classes fell by four percentage points; and the percentage attending infant classes \n(including reception classes) increased by three percentage points.  This may tie in with earlier \nresearch (see Sparkes and West, 1998), indicating that pressure was exerted on parents to send their \nchildren to school in order that schools should not lose funds, as a result of the predominantly per \ncapita funding for schools (see West and Pennell, 2003). \n \nThe overall increase in the proportion of three and four year olds attending private or voluntary \nproviders is not unexpected in the light of the fact that there has been a very explicit policy drive to \nincrease the range of providers from the private and voluntary sectors.  There has been a concomitant \ndecrease in terms of the percentage of four year olds in state-funded nursery classes and nursery \nschools and an increase in the percentage in reception classes.  This is a cause for concern.  Not only \nhave there been persistent concerns raised about the appropriateness of reception classes for young \nchildren (see Lewis, 2003; Sparkes and West, 1998) but there is research evidence to demonstrate that \nnursery schools and nursery classes offer high quality education, in terms of what is on offer and in \nterms of progress made by children (Sylva et al., 2004).  And as Penn (2000) notes in relation to \nnursery schools: \u2018They can potentially offer continuity for children from 0-5, provide childcare as well \nas education on a single site\u2026But unfortunately, nursery schools have been neglected in the most \nrecent policy discussions\u2019 (p. 53).   \n \nThere are clear differences in terms of the type of provision used by parents with different income \nlevels.\n13\n  Table 4 presents the type of provision used in relation to reported income levels (Bell and \nFinch, 2004).  \nTable 4 Use of different types of preschool provider in the last week by lowest and highest \nincome brackets (2002) (children aged three and four years of age) \n \nPreschool provider  Income per year  \n Total  Less than \n\u00a310,000  \n\u00a310,000 to \n\u00a319,999 \n\u00a320,000 to \n\u00a329,999 \n\u00a330,000 or \nmore \n % % % % % \nReception class 30 30 31 31 29 \nNursery class 26 34 30 25 19 \nPlaygroup\/ pre-school 21 14 19 22 25 \nNursery school 9 7 7 8 11 \nDay nursery 11 5 8 10 18 \nSpecial school 1 * 1 1 1 \nCombined\/Family centre * 1 1 * * \nOther 3 4 2 4 3 \nNone 4 7 6 4 2 \nBase 3572 614 802 735 1219 \nSource Bell & Finch (2004) \nNote  \nCategories of preschool provider do not match with those used in official statistics (e.g. DfES, \n2003a) \n 12 \nMany more high income families (and those in professional and managerial social classes) used day \nnurseries for their children than did low income families (and also those in partly-skilled and unskilled \nsocial classes).  The higher use of day nurseries by those from higher income families is likely to be \nrelated to cost, as fees charged for full day nursery care are generally high.  More three and four year \nolds from low income families than from high income families were in nursery classes, which are part \nof the state school sector.  In addition, more children from minority ethnic groups than white children \nattended nursery classes (34% versus 25%).  These differences could be associated with \u2018the \nprevalence and scarcity of different provider types in urban areas where ethnic minority families are \nconcentrated and possibly work status\u2019 (Bell and Finch, 2004, p. 69), but the issue of affordability is \nof fundamental importance.   \n \nThe Daycare Trust noted that almost three-quarters of parents reported a \u2018lack of affordable quality \nchildcare in their area\u2019 (2004).  Whilst a survey carried out for the NAO (2004), found that costs were \nnot reported to be one of the \u2018most important\u2019 factors in selecting pre-school providers, other research \nsuggests that costs are likely to be a significant factor in patterns of attendance.  Bell and Finch (2004) \nfound that just over a fifth of parents (22%) considered that the amount of their child\u2019s nursery \neducation had been limited by cost, and more parents of \u2018younger threes\u2019 than \u2018rising fives\u2019 (32% \nversus 18%) reported that this was the case.  Those on the lowest incomes were the most likely to \nreport having had their choice restricted by cost with more parents in the lowest income group than \nthe highest reporting that their children received too little nursery education (24% versus 19%).  In a \nsimilar vein, Penn (2000), in her case studies of nurseries found that: \u2018On the whole parents felt they \nhad had little choice in choosing their nursery \u2013 it was the only one that children of the right age, or \nhad a place at the right time, or was available for the right hours\u2026Costs were crucial and determined \nthe intake of the nursery\u2019 (p. 49).   \n \nThis problem of affordability is not unique to England.  As noted by the OECD: \n \nDespite availability of fee subsidies, affordability is cited as a major barrier to non-school \nECEC [Early Childhood Education and Care] services in countries including the UK, the \nNetherlands and the US, leading to a lower percentage of low-income families enrolled in \nECEC than higher-income families (2001, p.92).   \n \nIt is noteworthy that in an international context there is a tendency for children from low income \nbackgrounds \u2018to receive inferior services compared to their higher income counterparts\u2019 (OECD, \n2001, p. 74).    \n5. Discussion \n \nThis paper set out to examine the extent to which progress has been made in meeting three key \nobjectives of the Labour Government\u2019s National Childcare Strategy, namely improving the \navailability, quality and affordability of Early Childhood Education and Care.  In terms of availability, \nmore children were in pre-school provision in England in 2002 than in 1997, largely as a result of an \nexpansion of private and voluntary providers.  Notwithstanding the expansion, participation was lower \namongst younger three year old children from lower than higher income families; it was also lower \namongst children with ethnic minority than with white parents. \n \nIn relation to quality, there are now improved regulatory systems; however, the existence of quality \nassurance mechanisms does not necessarily mean that the provision is of a high quality.  The evidence \n 13 \nindicates that there is variability in terms of the quality of the provision.  Integrated centres (providing \nboth education and care), nursery schools and nursery classes are associated with greater progress on \ndifferent outcomes.  One reason for other forms of pre-school provision being, in general, less \neffective, is likely to be because fewer staff in these settings have relevant qualifications. \n \nIn view of the findings about the high quality of provision in nursery schools and classes, the fact that \nthe numbers of three and four year olds attending these types of provision has declined, is a cause for \nconcern.  The Government is, however, planning to expand integrated pre-school centres, providing \nboth education and care.  Children\u2019s Centres are being increased (Sure Start, 2004b) and the objective \nis for children attending these to \u2018get the same high quality early learning experience that would be on \noffer in a maintained nursery school\u2019 (p.11).  The Government aims for there to be at least 1,700 \nChildren\u2019s Centres for all the children in the 20 per cent most deprived wards by 2008, with a longer \nterm aim of a Children\u2019s Centre in every community (DfES, 2004c).   \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that there are benefits of high quality pre-school educational provision to \na range of different outcomes, cognitive and social (Sylva et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004; Melhuish, \n2004).  There are also societal benefits.  As noted by the Government: \n \nGiven that childcare benefits society as a whole, a modern childcare system should \nensure that parents are not prevented from accessing high quality childcare provision \non the grounds of cost.  Availability of childcare plays an important role in tackling \ndisadvantage and child poverty, and supporting social mobility and equality of \nopportunity (HM Treasury, 2004b, p. 4)  [author\u2019s italics] \n \nThe OECD, in its report on early childhood education, makes an additional point: \n \nAs children with limited access to services are often those who would benefit the most \nfrom quality ECEC, for equity reasons, there is a need for better monitoring of the \nconsequences for public expenditure and mechanisms for distributing resources \n(OECD, 2001, p. 92). [author\u2019s italics] \n \nThe report also notes that there is a need for the Government to re-examine whether the time available \nvia the free, part-time place is \u2018sufficient to address the social, emotional and language needs of \nchildren, especially ethnic minority and children from low-income families\u2019 (OECD, 2001, p.180-\n181).   \n \nWhilst the current \u2018free\u2019 pre-school educational provision is limited, the Government covers a \nsignificant percentage of the fees for additional provision in the case of parents who are eligible for \nWorking Tax Credit (and higher education and some other students).  However, the beneficiaries do \nnot include those working less than 16 hours a week.  Nor is any additional provision available for \nchildren living in workless families.  This seems anomalous as research evidence indicates that the \neffects of pre-school education on later academic skills are largest for disadvantaged children who \nalso benefit significantly from high quality provision (Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm and Waldfogel, \n2004; Sylva et al., 2004). \n \nTo meet the needs of parents on low incomes and their children it is argued that further financial \nsupport from the Government is needed.  A new pilot scheme extending free part-time education \nplaces to 6,000 two-year olds in disadvantaged areas (HM Treasury, 2004a) is significant, as the \n 14 \nresearch evidence reviewed points to a longer period \u2013 in terms of the number of years or provision \u2013 \nof early education being more beneficial than a shorter period (Sylva et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004). \nSignificantly, Sylva et al. (2004) found that disadvantaged children tended to have participated in pre-\nschool education for less time than those from more advantaged backgrounds.   \n \nHowever, it should also be stressed that Government initiatives are targeted, in the main, on \ndisadvantaged areas (wards).  The difficulty with this approach is that whilst over 50% of children \nfrom families on income support live in the 20% most deprived wards, over 40% of children from \nfamilies on income support do not live in these areas (House of Commons Select Committee on Work \nand Pensions, 2003). \n \nWhat, then, are the implications for future policy?  Further funding could be targeted to eligible \nparents via the Working Tax Credit; the maximum fee level under the childcare element could be \nincreased as could the percentage of costs covered by the Government; it could also be extended to \nthose working less than 16 hours a week.  However, this still leaves some of the most disadvantaged \nchildren (e.g., those in workless families) with very limited pre-school education; these are children \nwho stand to benefit significantly from pre-school educational provision.  On the basis of the evidence \nexamined, there would be a strong argument for extending the current quasi-voucher (providing a free \npart-time place) to all two year old children living in households with incomes below a given level \nirrespective of where they live, so that they have a longer period of high quality pre-school education.  \nThere is also an argument for increasing the value of the quasi-voucher so that it covers more than 2.5 \nhours for 33 weeks a year; such a move would assist those parents on low incomes, a significant \nminority of whom report that the amount of pre-school education is limited by cost considerations.  It \nwould also create a more level playing field in the pre-school education market and those on low \nincomes would be able to make more authentic choices and not have their choices restricted, to the \nextent that they are at present, by cost considerations.   \n \nIf the Government moves in the direction of making it easier for disadvantaged children to benefit \nfrom pre-school education, it will be important for consideration to be given to the type of provision \nthat should be funded.  The research analysed here suggests that if the Government wishes to pursue \nfurther expansion of voluntary and private providers, provision should be modelled on policy and \npractice in nursery schools, nursery classes and integrated centres providing education and care.  The \nevidence indicates that \u2018quality\u2019 construed in terms of processes and outputs, is higher in these types \nof provision, not least because of the qualification levels of the staff employed.  By focusing policy on \nhigh quality provision, targeted on those most in need, the overall benefits, educational and social, are \nlikely to be greater.   \n \nReferences \nAcheson, D.

DOI: 10.1002\/14651858.CD000564. \nRetrieved 28 December 2004 from: \nhttp:\/\/www.nelh.nhs.uk\/cochrane.asp \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks are due to the anonymous reviewers of an earlier version of this paper, whose comments were \nextremely helpful, and to colleagues who have also given useful comments.  \n 20 \nEndnotes \n \n                                                 \n1\n In England, education is compulsory from the term after a child reaches five years of age. \n2\n Including reception classes catering for children in the year before compulsory schooling begins. \n3\n In 2004 there were 150 local education authorities in England. \n4\n The term \u2018nursery voucher\u2019 is still used on occasion as is the term \u2018nursery education grant\u2019; the \nlatter is named after the funding stream initially used by the Labour Government to fund the quasi-\nvoucher scheme. \n5\n Under the Conservative voucher scheme there was a flat fee across the country, with no top-ups for \ndisadvantage or higher costs.  According to information provided by a sample of local education \nauthorities (London Borough of Brent (2005), Islington (2005), Harrow (2005), City of Westminster \n(2005), Dorset County Council (2005), East Sussex (2005) and Kent (2005)), the amount payable for \n2004-05 varied little, ranging from \u00a31248 to \u00a31278. \n6\n Financial assistance with childcare fees is also available for under 19 year olds (DfES, 2005), for \nthose taking health professional courses and may also be available for eligible further education \nstudents (Learndirect, 2005). \n7\n In 2002, the average number of children per adult was 12.4, with 87% of pupils being in classes with \n15 or fewer children per adult, and 13% in classes with over 15 and up to 30 children per adult (DfES, \n2003b). \n8\n Classroom assistants are often employed in addition to qualified teachers. \n9\n The total sample size was over 4,000. \n10\n All differences reported are statistically significant at the 0.05 level or beyond on the basis of the \nconfidence limits and sample sizes provided by Bell and Finch (2004). \n11\n The DfES, recognising the fact that local authorities in some disadvantaged areas were having \nproblems reaching this target, made additional funds available to help increase provision (NAO, \n2004). \n12\n Data prior to 2000 are not available. \n13\n The focus on income as opposed to social class is intentional. \n"}
