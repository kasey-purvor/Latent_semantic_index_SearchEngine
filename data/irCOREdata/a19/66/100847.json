INTRODUCTION\nWith the view of achieving quantum coherent control and\nmanipulation of spin-polarized states in semiconductor nano-\nstructures recently there has been a significant interest in\ncircularly \u0001elliptically\u0002 polarized optical pulse excitations\ndue to their ability to transfer angular-momentum and drive a\nsystem to a particular angular-momentum state. A necessary\ncondition for quantum coherence is the use of sufficiently\nshort optical pulses so that they can interact with the quan-\ntum system before it can be affected by its environment. The\nachievement of control and manipulation of the dynamics of\na single \u0001or a few\u0002 electron spins \u0001quantum bits\u0002 in semicon-\nductor nanostructures is of key importance toward the chal-\nlenging goal of realization of quantum computation. Recent\nresearch \u00032\u0004 has demonstrated that semiconductor quantum\ndots might be strong candidates for the realization of spin\nquantum bits. This is due to their atomiclike electronic struc-\nture which suppresses coupling of the spin to the solid-state\nquantum environment and thus impedes the spin decoher-\nence processes. In this respect, the analogy with the discrete\nmultilevel system becomes more relevant and permits mod-\neling of the quantum-dot coherent dynamics on the basis of\nthe Maxwell pseudospin equations \u00033\u0004.\nIt is well known that in the coherent regime the time\nevolution of the two-level quantum system under external\ndipole coupling perturbation can be described by the coher-\nent optical Bloch equations \u0001see, e.g., \u00034\u0004\u0002. These equations,\nhowever, have been derived under the assumptions of a lin-\nearly polarized optical excitation for which the selection\nrules \u0001Jz=0 apply. The optical transitions between the two\nlevels are induced by the dipole interaction which is given by\nthe scalar product \u0002\u0001 \u00b7E\u0001 \u0001t\u0002, \u0002\u0001 being the dipole moment. How-\never, the vectorial character of the electric field E\u0001 \u0001t\u0002 is com-\npletely ignored and only \u0002E\u0001t\u0002 is considered.\nThe optical Bloch equations with linear polarization\ncoupled with the vector Maxwell\u2019s equations have been suc-\ncessfully applied for description of ultrashort pulse propaga-\ntion in nonlinear media \u00035,6\u0004 and for demonstration of self-\ninduced transparency effects and soliton propagation in two-\nlevel atomic absorbing or amplifying media in one\ndimension \u00011D\u0002 \u00037\u0004.\nHowever, the selection rules for the excitonic transitions\nin bulk semiconductors, and in particular in semiconductors\nwith reduced dimensionality, require \u0001Jz= \u00b11. These transi-\ntions are excited by elliptically \u0001or circularly\u0002 polarized light\nand can no longer be described by a single scalar interaction,\nas has been already pointed out by Feynman et al. \u00031\u0004. This\njustifies the need for a model of coherent dynamics account-\ning for the polarization state of the applied electromagnetic\nfield. In what follows, we shall be interested in circularly\npolarized pulse propagation and interactions, inducing the\nabove type of optically allowed \u0001dipole-active\u0002 transitions\nbetween the quantum states.\nIn this paper we develop a general formalism and propose\na numerical model for description of polarized ultrashort op-\ntical pulse interactions with a two-level quantum system. The\npolarized ultrashort optical pulse propagation and interac-\ntions with the discrete quantum-level system are treated\nwithin the semiclassical approach. The optical field is calcu-\nlated self-consistently from the vectorial Maxwell equations\ncoupled via macroscopic polarization to the time-evolution\nequations of the quantum system in terms of the real pseu-\ndospin \u0001coherence\u0002 vector \u00031\u0004. The latter represents a special\ncase \u0001N=2\u0002 of the generalized pseudospin formalism for an\nN-level quantum system \u00038,9\u0004.

S30=\u22121 initially set corresponds to all resonant di-\npoles in their ground states and therefore the modeled me-\ndium will be absorbing; S30= +1 corresponds to all dipoles\ninitially excited in the upper energy level describing ampli-\nfying \u0001gain\u0002 medium.\nThe above system coincides with the equation of motion\nderived by Feynman et al. in the case of electric \u0001Jz= \u00b11\ndipole transitions \u00031\u0004:\ndS\ndt\n= \n \u0004 S , \u00012.17\u0002\nwhich is of the well-known form of precession of a classical\ngyromagnet in a magnetic field.\nThe macroscopic polarization density induced in the me-\ndium is given by\nP = \u2212 eNa Tr\u0001\u000b\u02c6Q\u02c6 \u0002 \u00012.18\u0002\nwhere \u000b\u02c6 is the density matrix, Q\u02c6 is the local displacement\noperator whose expectation value gives the local displace-\nment from equilibrium vector q and Na is the resonant dipole\ndensity. During its propagation the optical wave induces a\npolarization along the x and y axes, therefore the local dis-\nplacement operator can be split into two orthogonal compo-\nnents\nQ\u02c6 x =\nq0\n2\n\t\u02c6 1, \u00012.19\u0002\nQ\u02c6 y =\nq0\n2\n\t\u02c6 2, \u00012.20\u0002\nwhere \t1 ,\t2 are given by Eq. \u00012.9\u0002. It is easy to show that\nwith this expansion and an electric field vector within the x\n-y plane, we can recover the dipole interaction Hamiltonian\nfrom Eq. \u00012.5\u0002. Using Eq. \u00012.18\u0002 we get\nPx = \u2212\n1\n2\n\u0002NaS1, \u00012.21\u0002\nPy = \u2212\n1\n2\n\u0002NaS2. \u00012.22\u0002\nThus we end up with the time-evolution equations of the\ntwo-level quantum system \u00012.14\u0002\u2013\u00012.16\u0002 coupled to the Max-\nwell curl equations \u00012.1\u0002\u2013\u00012.4\u0002 via the polarization \u00012.21\u0002 and\n\u00012.22\u0002 acting as a source term in Maxwell\u2019s equations.\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nWe consider the Goursat-type inital boundary value prob-\nlem \u000310\u0004 for the solution in the time domain of the above\nfirst-order system of differential equations. The problem is\nwell posed if the whole time history of the pulse excitation is\ngiven at a certain characteristic of the medium, e.g., at the\nleft boundary z=0. In order to model an elliptically \u0001circu-\nlarly\u0002 polarized optical pulse we excite simultaneously two\northogonal linearly polarized pulses, one time delayed with\nrespect to the other by \f \/2 at the left boundary.

Consider a 15-\u0002m-long\nsimulation domain filled with a resonantly absorbing GaAs\nmedium with refractive index n=3.3827 at wavelength \t\n=1.5 \u0002m \u0001the initial population profile is S30=\u22121\u0002. At the left\nboundary of the FDTD simulation space two orthogonal\nGaussian pulses phase shifted by \f \/2 and given by Eqs.\n\u00013.1\u0002 and \u00013.2\u0002 with an envelope given by the second line of\nEq. \u00013.5\u0002 are launched toward the slab. The carrier frequency\nof the pulses is tuned in resonance with the atomic transition\nfrequency \u00070 corresponding to the wavelength \t=1.5 \u0002m,\nand the pulse duration is chosen as Tp=30 fs. We shall re-\nstrict ourselves to the linear absorption and gain regime;\ntherefore the initial electric field amplitude is chosen to be\nE0=1 V m\u22121. The population and polarization relaxation\ntimes of the damped resonant dipoles are set to T1=100 ps\nand T2=70 fs, respectively. The electric field is sampled as a\nfunction of time at two locations z1 and z2 within the absorb-\ning medium separated by one dielectric wavelength. The\ncomplex propagation factors over distance l=z2\u2212z1=\t \/n for\nthe Ex and Ey components of the electric field are calculated\nby taking the Fourier transform of the time traces, according\nto\neikc\u0001z2\u2212z1\u0002 =\nEj\u0001z2,\u0007\u0002\nEj\u0001z1,\u0007\u0002\n, j = x,y , \u00013.22\u0002\nwhere the complex wave vector is given by kc=\u000f+ i\n. Sepa-\nrating the real and imaginary parts we can obtain the ampli-\nfication \u0001absorption\u0002 factor e\u2212\nl and the phase factor \u000fl. From\nthe former the gain \u0001absorption\u0002 coefficient can be calculated\nand from the latter the atomic phase shift is inferred.

The optical wave interacts with the two-level system\ndriving the population to the upper state by absorbing the\npulse energy.

SELF-INDUCED TRANSPARENCY AND POLARIZED\nSOLITON FORMATION\nIn this section we investigate the nonlinear regime of po-\nlarized pulse propagation which is achieved at high pulse\nintensities. We shall be interested in the coherent effects, and\nmore specifically, in the self-induced transparency \u0001SIT\u0002\nwhich occurs when the ultrashort pulse propagates through\nmedia whose atomic lifetimes greatly exceed the pulse dura-\ntion. Therefore, in order to satisfy the SIT criterion, i.e., T1,\nT2\u0010Tp, we have set Tp=100 fs and T1=T2=100 ps through-\nout the simulations. The simulation domain is 15 \u0002m long\nand the two-level absorbing medium \u0001corresponding to initial\npopulation profile S30=\u22121\u0002 with refractive index n=1 is em-\nbedded between two free-space regions each with length\n7.5 \u0002m. As we have shown in the previous Sec. III \u0001Figs. 2\nand 3\u0002, the only polarized optical wave which excites the\nsystem \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 initially in its ground state, is the left-\ncircularly-polarized one: \b\u2212\u0001+,\u2212\u0002. Therefore we inject a left-\ncircularly-polarized pulse given by Eq. \u00013.1\u0002 and \u00013.2\u0002 with a\nhyperbolic secant \u0001HS\u0002 envelope given by the first line in Eq.\n\u00013.5\u0002 at the left boundary \u0001z=0\u0002 of the simulation domain.\nWe make an initial guess for the pulse shape to be a HS one\nsince the stable soliton solution of Maxwell-Bloch equations\nin 1D is of this form \u000313\u0004. The carrier frequency is taken to\nbe equal to the resonant transition frequency of the two-level\nmedium \u00070=2\ff0, where f0=2.0\u00041014 s\u22121, corresponding\nto a wavelength \t=1.5 \u0002m. According to the pulse area\ntheorem \u0001PAT\u0002 which has been formulated within the slowly-\nvarying-envelope approximation \u000314,15\u0004, the stable solutions\nin an absorbing medium are given by even multiples of \f.\nWe shall chose the initial field amplitude for both Ex and Ey\ncomponents to give a 2\f pulse area, which yields E0\n=4.2186\u0004109 V m\u22121 \u00037\u0004.

A\nsingle pulse at the simulation time t=200 fs from Fig. 8 is\nplotted on an expanded scale in Fig. 9 showing the local\nexcitation of the two-level system by the leading pulse edges\nand the subsequent deexcitation by the trailing pulse edges.\nThis is indicative for the self-induced transparency phenom-\nenon and in agreement with the predictions of the PAT. Thus\nwe have numerically demonstrated the formation of polar-\nized SIT solitons excited by a certain polarization state of the\noptical field \u0001left-circular polarization in this case\u0002. Note that\nthe cubic-polynomial features characteristic for the linear po-\nlarization case occurring at the null-field points attributed to\nthe time-derivative behavior \u00037\u0004 are no longer present in the\ncircularly polarized case \u0001Fig. 9\u0002. This is due to the superpo-\nsition of the effects of the time derivatives of the E field\ncomponents, the second being time shifted with respect to\nthe first one.\nTo complete our validation study we need to check the\npredictions of the PAT regarding the polarized pulse propa-\ngation in an amplifying \u0001gain\u0002 two-level media. By the virtue\nof the PAT, the stable solutions are obtained when the pulse\narea is odd multiples of \f. The simulation domain is as de-\nscribed above except for the population which is assumed to\nbe initially in the excited level, corresponding to S30= +1.\nWe launch a \f right-circularly-polarized pulse \b+\u0001+, + \u0002 from\nthe left boundary, given by Eqs. \u00013.3\u0002 and \u00013.4\u0002, modulated\nby a HS function \u00013.5\u0002. The initial pulse amplitude is taken\nE0=2.1093\u0004109 V m\u22121 which corresponds to pulse area of\n\f. The pulse and the corresponding population inversion are\nplotted in Fig. 10. As expected from the PAT, the pulse com-\npletely inverts the medium returning the population back to\nthe ground state. The pulse time evolution is shown in Fig.\n11. The pulse amplitude increases while the pulse duration is\nshortened. As a result the pulse area is conserved during the\npropagation in the amplifying medium.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have developed a formalism and a numerical method\nbased on it for the exact treatment of polarized ultrashort\noptical pulse interactions with a model two-level quantum\nsystem. The proposed approach takes advantage of the real\npseudospin vector representation in its little known ramifica-\ntion for description of the time evolution of a two-level\nquantum system in case of excitation by circularly polarized\nlight due to Feynman et al. \u00031\u0004.

This permits for a rigorous description of pulse propa-\ngation and interactions on an ultrashort time scale including\nfew-optical-cycle pulses which are the most likely candidates\nto be used for realization of coherent quantum control of\nspin-polarized states. The proposed model fully accounts for\nthe vector character of the electric field of the ultrafast opti-\ncal excitation and hence for its polarization state. We dem-\nonstrated selective excitation of atomic transitions with \u0001Jz\n=1 or \u0001Jz=\u22121 by predefined helicity of the optical pulse.\nAnother important advantage of the FDTD solution of the\nMaxwell pseudospin system is the possibility of treatment of\na variety of realistic geometries including microcavities \u0001see\n\u00035,6\u0004\u0002. The range of validity of the model potentially reaches\nto the extreme nonlinear regime. It is successfully applied to\nthe study of coherent propagation phenomena, such as SIT,\nand the formation of polarized solitons is numerically dem-\nonstrated. The model is currently being extended to multiple\ndimensions and multilevel quantum systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the CPU time on the\nparallel cluster available at the ATI.
