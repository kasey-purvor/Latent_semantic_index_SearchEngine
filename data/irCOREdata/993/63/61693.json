However, with a diffuse phosphorus source and short \nretention times, an increase in biomass was observed when the nutrient was limiting \nfor growth. \n 2\nIntroduction 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \nThe concept of lake retention (residence) time is well established in limnology, as is \nits importance in influencing lake ecology (Kalff, 2002).  The rate at which water \nmoves through a lake can affect the supply, and the loss, of nutrients, organic matter \netc., making changes to this flushing rate a complex balance between the competing \neffects of gain and loss (S\u00f8balle & Kimmel, 1987).  For many lakes, such changes in \nflushing rate are likely in the next few decades because of climate change and its \nassociated effects on rainfall and snowmelt (IPCC, 2007).  Therefore, it is important \nto understand the sensitivity of lakes to changes in retention time and, more \nimportantly, the potential drivers that may lie behind any change. \n Perhaps one of the most important mechanisms by which retention time \n(flushing rate) has been thought to affect phytoplankton in lakes is through \ndetermining the in-lake phosphorus (P) concentration.  Interestingly, flushing rate was \noriginally excluded as a factor in the Vollenweider (1968) model because most of the \nlakes originally used to derive the empirical relationship had very long retention times \n(i.e. 3 of 25 had retention times < 1 year; Dillon (1975)).  Dillon\u2019s (1975) application \nof the model to a lake with a retention time of approximately 19-21 days highlighted \nthis omission and subsequent versions of the Vollenweider model included flushing \nrate (Vollenweider, 1976; Larsen & Mercier, 1976; Vollenweider & Kerekes, 1980): \n \n)1(\n\/\nw\nsp qLP\n\u03c4+\n= \u2019                                                          (1) 20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nwhere Lp is the annually and areally averaged phosphorus load (mg m-2 y-1), qs is the \nwater discharge height (m y-1) and \u03c4w (y) is the reciprocal of the flushing rate.  In this \nversion of the model, the flushing rate acts as a surrogate for the sedimentation of \nphosphorus from the water column (Kalff, 2002).  In a recent review, Brett & \n 3\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \nBenjamin (2008) re-emphasized the importance of retention time in the Vollenweider \n(1976) phosphorus loading model and its many derivatives.  They also highlighted \nthat the source of phosphorus in the Vollenweider model is non-specific and may \naccount for some of the variation in the relationship i.e. internal loading of \nphosphorus can affect the relationship between external phosphorus supply and in-\nlake phosphorus.   \nThe relationship between nutrient source and retention time has long been a \nrelatively unexplored issue, despite its potential importance being highlighted in \nEdmondson\u2019s (1970) review of Vollenweider (1968); the former found issue with the \nlatter\u2019s lack of consideration as to the source of the phosphorus in Vollenweider\u2019s \nmodel.  Schindler (2006) recognized the importance of this factor in a comprehensive \nreview of the state of eutrophication science, stating that the effect that retention time \nhas on eutrophication is poorly understood when the nutrient load to the lake is split \nbetween point (e.g. sewage waste, sediment released phosphorus) and diffuse (e.g. \nagriculturally derived phosphorus) sources.   \nIn an initial study examining precisely this issue, Jones & Elliott (2007) \nadapted the Vollenweider model in Equation 1 to demonstrate the theoretical basis for \nthis point\/diffuse effect.  They rewrote the model in a form that could separate inflow \ndependent and inflow independent phosphorus sources thus: \n)()\/1( QVQ\nM\nQV\nPP si +++= ,      (2) 20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nwhere Pi is the inflow phosphorus concentration (mg m-3), V is the volume of the lake \n(m3), Q is the discharge from the lake (m3 y-1) and Ms is the annual input mass from \npoint sources (see Jones & Elliott (2007) for a full explanation and derivation).  In this \nstudy, we make the approximation that the first and second terms of the right hand \n 4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \nside of the above equation are analogous to diffuse and point source loading \nrespectively.  This simplification should be considered when interpreting the results of \nthis study.   Furthermore, P can be used to predict C, the annually averaged \nchlorophyll concentration (mg m-3) with this equation from Vollenweider & Kerekes \n(1980): \n C = 0.37(P0.91),        (3) \n Coupling these two equations allows the prediction of the annual mean chlorophyll of \na given lake in response to different point and diffuse source ratios and retention \ntimes.  Whilst it is simplistic and has its limitations, it does provide an important \nstarting hypothesis of response for a given lake. \nThis study aims to expand upon the investigation of Jones & Elliott (2007) by \ntesting a lake which naturally experiences a wide range of retention times.  By using \nthe phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, the study examines fully the impact \nof changing retention time, as well as considering the importance of annual discharge \npattern, the relative effects in winter and summer and, of course, the importance of \nnutrient source.  It compares these outputs to those predicted by Equations 2 and 3 \nand considers the implications of any differences in response. \n 5\nMethods 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSite description \nBassenthwaite Lake (54\u00b0 39.09' N, 3\u00b0 12.93' W) is situated to the north of the English \nLake District. It is relatively shallow, with a mean depth of 5.3 m and a maximum \ndepth of 19.0 m (Ramsbottom, 1976). Thermal stratification is episodic and readily \nbroken down, and the average annual retention time is short, c. 19 days (Thackeray et \nal., 2006). Based on the annual average concentration of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a \n(13.4 mg m-3, Thackeray et al., 2006), Bassenthwaite Lake may be considered \neutrophic (OECD, 1982).  Estimates of the relative importance of the sources for \nnutrients entering the lake suggest that approximately 60% of the total annual load \ncomes from anthropogenic sources (treated sewage waste) with the rest derived from \nthe catchment (Thackeray et al., 2006).  In the UK, for example, this split can range \nfrom anywhere between 100% point source to virtually 0% (Anthony & Lyons, 2007). \n Bassenthwaite Lake has been routinely monitored since 1991, with nutrient \nand phytoplankton samples taken every two weeks (the exception was during the \n2001 foot and mouth incident which restricted access to the rural areas of the UK).  \nCorresponding daily meteorological measurements for wind speed, air temperature \nand air humidity were available from a meteorological station approximately 4 km \naway from the lake.  Daily cloud cover measurements were available from another \nmeteorological station near Windermere, approximately 25 km away.  Daily outflow \ndischarges were available and the inflows were assumed to be the same as these \nvalues.  Previous analysis (see Elliott et al., 2006) had identified that 1996 was the \nyear during this study period with the longest annual retention time (c. 28.25 days), \ntherefore this year was chosen for the subsequent sensitivity analysis in order to \nprovide the widest range of retention times, and its corresponding observed discharge \n 6\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nand meterological data were used to drive the simulations. \n \nPROTECH model description \nPROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange) is a computer \nmodel that simulates the growth of multiple phytoplankton species types (see \nReynolds et al., 2001 for full details of the equations and philosophies behind \nPROTECH). The biological component of the PROTECH model is the basic state \nvariable equation determining the daily change in the chlorophyll a concentration (X) \nof each algal species: \n\u0394X\/\u0394t =  (r\u00b4 - S - G - D) X,       (4) \nwhere r\u00b4 is the proportional growth rate over 24 h, S represents the losses due to \nsettling, G the losses due to Daphnia grazing (see below for further details) and D \nthose due to dilution. The growth rate for a species in the model is firstly determined \nby their morphology and then modified by the water temperature and daily \nphotoperiod and can be limited further by lack of phosphorus, nitrogen or silicon.  \nThese nutrient concentrations in the water column are modified to reflect uptake due \nto growth and daily supply and loss via inflow\/outflow exchange.  For all the species \nsimulated it is assumed that these nutrients are consumed from the water column in \nthe following stoichiometric ratio of 82 g SiO2 (only if diatom): 8.3 g nitrogen : 1.2 g \nphosphorus : 1g chlorophyll (Stumm & Morgan, 1981).  \nIn this study eight phytoplankton species were modelled at one time and an \nanalysis of Bassenthwaite Lake phytoplankton data was conducted in order to identify \nthe dominant taxa that should be included in the simulations.  They were Chlorella, \nCryptomonas, Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Fragilaria, Aulacoseira, Asterionella \nformosa Hass. and Planktothrix (Table 1).  A species-specific movement function \n 7\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncalculates the position of each species in the column, accounting for the movement of \nthe water and Stoke\u2019s Law (movement down the water column), as well as the \nmotile\/buoyancy properties of some phytoplankton (positive movement up the water \ncolumn, dependent upon light intensity for motile species) (Table 2). \nAs mentioned above, there is a simple grazing routine in PROTECH, adopting \nthe temperature- and food-dependent growth and reproduction relationships \ndeveloped for Daphnia by Reynolds (1984).  This simulated grazing pressure is also \naffected by flushing loss and was applied to only three of the eight species simulated \nin this study (Table 1). \n The physical structure of the water column is defined over vertical, \nmorphologically-dependent 0.1 m slices. The extent of mixing within the water \ncolumn is calculated by following the Monin-Obukhov length calculation (Imberger, \n1985), which gives an instantaneous prediction of the depth at which the buoyancy \nforces (due to the heat flux) and the opposing dissipative forces (due to wind stress) \nare equal in magnitude.  This point corresponds to the extent of the mixed layer, \nassuming initial uniformity.  To test the resistance to mixing of an existing density \nstructure, it is also necessary to apply a Wedderburn-test, which incorporates a term \nfor the accumulated density difference between the water at the surface and at any \nnominated depth.  At each iteration, the model works down the water column, \nincorporating each slice until the accumulated density difference resists the \nincorporation: this slice then corresponds to the depth of the thermocline (Reynolds et \nal., 2001). \n The PROTECH model has had its key growth parameters verified (Elliott et al. \n1999b), tested for sensitivity (Elliott et al. 1999a) and been validated at numerous \nsites (Elliott et al., 2000; Lewis et al., 2002; Elliott & Thackeray, 2004; Elliott et al., \n 8\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n2007; Bernhardt et al., 2008).  Also, it has been successfully used to simulate \nBassenthwaite Lake in a previous study (Elliott et al., 2006). \n \nRetention time sensitivity  \nThe biomass of the simulated phytoplankton was calculated at a daily temporal \nresolution in terms of an integrated 5-m concentration of chlorophyll-a per unit \nvolume of lake water.  This made the results comparable with observed data from \nBassenthwaite Lake in 1996.  The total chlorophyll output of PROTECH was \ncompared with the observed data and tested both visually and statistically, using \nregression analysis for its \u201cgoodness-of-fit\u201d. \n This 1996 simulation was then subjected to a detailed testing by the following \nmethod.  Eleven nutrient supply ratios were calculated ranging from 100% diffuse to \n100% point phosphorus source in 10% changes to the ratios (i.e. 90-10, 80-20, 30-70 \netc.) and representing ratios commonly observed in UK water bodies (Anthony & \nLyons, 2007).  The point source was created by altering the measured inflow SRP \nconcentration so that the daily load was the same regardless of the changes in daily \ndischarge (i.e. a dilution).  Conversely, a diffuse source was created by not changing \nSRP concentration with changes in discharge, so that the daily load would change \nwith discharge.  Finally, to create scenarios that had different ratios of point and \ndiffuse nutrient sources, the alterations outlined above were applied in different \nrelative proportions to SRP inflow input.  100 different retention time simulations for \neach nutrient scenario were then run, providing a range of annual retention times \nbetween 5.7 \u2013 260.0 days.  Annual, winter (defined as January-March and November-\nDecember) and summer (August-September) mean chlorophyll were calculated for \neach run. \n 9\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n The previous study of Jones & Elliott (2007) suggested that the seasonal \npattern of discharge might have an influence on the simulated phytoplankton, thus \nadditional runs were made for the two extreme cases of source scenarios (100% point \nand 100% diffuse) using a seasonal average discharge pattern.  The latter was \nachieved by calculating the mean daily discharge for October-March and also for \nApril-September, and then applying those means to the relevant time period of the \nsimulations e.g. the October-March mean was used for all the days in the simulation \nduring those months and, again, 100 different retention time scenarios were run for \nthe two nutrient sources.  Finally, in response to the results of these stepped-flow \nsimulations, the runs were repeated but this time the phosphorus concentration of the \ninflow was reduced to 20% of its original value in 10% reductions and 100 different \nretention time scenarios were run for each of these changed nutrient concentrations.  \nOnly the mean summer chlorophyll values are shown for these latter simulations \nbecause this period showed the greatest sensitivity to the flow changes.  \n 10\nResults 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nVollenweider model predicted response \nBy applying Equations 2 and 3 to Bassenthwaite Lake in 1996 for a range of annual \ndischarge rates (Q), a theoretical response of annual mean chlorophyll to changing \nretention time was produced for the two extreme nutrient source scenarios of 100% \npoint (i.e. Pi set to zero) and 100% diffuse (i.e. Ms set to zero) (Fig. 1). The figure \nshows clearly large differences between the two theoretical loading scenarios.  If the \nsource is totally point, then the supply of phosphorus is independent of discharge and \nis therefore flushed out at higher discharges (shorter retention times) and the mean \nannual chlorophyll response follows a bow shaped curve.  In contrast, with only \ndiffuse sources the relationship is relatively flat and unchanging because the increase \nin phosphorus supply is balanced by the nutrient\u2019s flushing loss and sedimentation.  \nHowever, there is the notable exception that at very high discharges (c. <40 days \nretention time) more chlorophyll is produced, as the gain of phosphorus begins to \noutweigh the \u201csedimentation of phosphorus\u201d, as approximated by Equation 2. \n \nPROTECH simulation of Bassenthwaite Lake in 1996 \nThe total chlorophyll output of PROTECH (i.e. sum of the eight species\u2019 individual \nchlorophyll concentrations) was compared to the observed seasonal pattern (Fig. 2).  \nThe seasonal pattern was reproduced, particularly the spring bloom, although the \nsingle high summer value was not produced by PROTECH.  Regression analysis \nbetween observed and simulated confirmed the \u201cgoodness-of-fit\u201d of the simulation \n(R2 = 0.67, P < 0.01). \n \nRetention time sensitivity \n 11\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nConsidering initially the two extreme nutrient supply scenarios, it was clear that the \nresponse of the mean total chlorophyll to retention time changes was greatly \ndependent upon the period of year examined (Fig. 3).  The annual mean total \nchlorophyll showed that nutrient source did affect the response of chlorophyll to \nretention time change.  Both scenarios showed a decline in the annual mean with \nincreasing discharge at short retention times, although the response curve under the \n100% diffuse scenario was flatter than the 100% point simulations above about 100 \ndays (Fig. 3).  In the summer, the different responses between the nutrient scenarios \nwere much more pronounced.  The point source scenario produced a steady decline \nfrom the maximum mean summer total chlorophyll of 30 to 12 mg m-3 (Fig. 3a) with \nshortening retention time, whereas the diffuse source scenario showed a steady \nincrease in chlorophyll (Fig. 3b).  It was also interesting that during the summer, for \nthe point source scenario, a distinct step change in chlorophyll occurred at c. 90 days \nretention time (Fig. 3a).  Finally, irrespective of nutrient source, the mean winter total \nchlorophyll response was virtually identical between the two nutrient scenarios, \nshowing a slight decline with shorter retention times (Fig. 3). \n The other nutrient source scenarios provided further information on these \nresponses (Fig. 4).  Each 10 % change in the point-diffuse ratio produced a relatively \nsmooth transition between the two extreme mean annual chlorophyll response curves \n(Fig. 4a).  The greatest rate of change occurred between the 100% diffuse scenario \nand 20-80 point-diffuse scenario.  The summer mean chlorophyll values showed a \nsimilar response as the annual mean curves, with gradual changes in chlorophyll \noccurring as the resource ratios altered.  It is interesting to note that the gain in \nchlorophyll that was seen at short retention times in the 100% diffuse scenario became \na loss with only a 30% reduction in the diffuse source contribution (i.e. for ratios \n 12\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ngreater than 30-70 point-diffuse).  Finally, the abrupt change in chlorophyll at c. 100 \ndays retention time was hinted at in most ratios but was most pronounced at ratios \ngreater than 70-30 point-diffuse. \n For the 100% diffuse and point scenario, the day at which the total chlorophyll \nfirst and last passed 10 mg m-3 was recorded for all the retention time scenarios (Fig. \n5); these points nominally represented the start of the spring bloom and the end of the \nsummer\/autumn bloom.  Irrespective of nutrient source, the onset of the spring bloom \nbecame 14 days earlier with retention times shorter than 18 days but barely advanced \nfurther with longer retention times.  The end of the bloom occurred later with \nincreasing retention time but did show a nutrient source related effect.  With a point \nsource, the bloom end levelled out 60 days later (day 335) than that observed for the \nshortest retention time scenario (day 272).   In contrast, the diffuse source scenarios \nlevelled out about 40 days later at day 315. \n The seasonal average discharge pattern scenarios produced response curves \nthat were generally similar to those in Fig. 3 (Fig. 6).  There was one notable \nexception to this: the summer mean chlorophyll for the diffuse scenario did not \ncontinue to increase at very short retention times, but instead declined sharply (Fig. \n6b).  This result warranted further consideration, thus the seasonal average \nsimulations were repeated, but this time with decreasing inflow phosphorus \nconcentrations and focusing solely on the summer means.  The patterns produced \nwere similar to those in Fig. 6 for the point source conditions (Fig. 7a), although the \nactual amount of chlorophyll produced naturally declined with decreasing inflow \nphosphorus.  The same was not true for the diffuse source simulations (Fig. 7b) where \nthe pattern of sharp decline in summer mean average seen in Fig. 6b was only \napparent in the scenarios with more than 40-50% of the original inflow phosphorus \n 13\n1 \n2 \n3 \nconcentration.  Below this amount, the mean chlorophyll had a much flatter response \nwith changing retention time, actually rising slightly with very short retention times in \na way similar to the summer mean curve in Fig. 3b. \n 14\nDiscussion 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe effects on phytoplankton of changing retention time can be varied and complex \n(Kalff, 2002).  By using models, we can try to unravel this complexity to understand \nquantitatively the response of phytoplankton populations to these changes.  If we \nconsider first the results from equations 2 and 3, it would appear that changes in \nretention time seem to be able to produce large variations in annual phytoplankton \nbiomass, but that the source of nutrients greatly determines the extent of variation, i.e. \nwith a 100% point nutrient source, the change is greatest (Fig. 1).  With this simple \nmodel, it is easy to understand why this is the case by examining Equation 2.  If the \nnutrient load entering a lake is wholly proportional to the inflow (\u2018100 % diffuse\u2019 \nsource), then as river discharge increases, more nutrients are brought into the lake, but \nsimultaneously, more nutrients are flushed out of the lake. This can be seen in the first \npart of the right hand side of Equation 2, which also indicates that this balance is \nslightly altered by sedimentation effects, albeit ones that are approximated empirically \nin this Equation. Conversely, if the nutrient load to a lake is from a point source only, \nthen an increase in river discharge brings no extra nutrients to the lake, but the \nconsequent increase in flushing still removes in-lake nutrients (i.e. increased dilution). \nThis is represented by the second part of the right hand side of Equation 2, where the \ndischarge is firmly within the denominator. Following Equation 3, a decrease in in-\nlake nutrient concentration leads directly to a decrease in phytoplankton biomass.  \nInterestingly, this means that the Vollenweider equation does not account for the \nactual removal of biomass directly from flushing but rather via the loss of in-lake \nphosphorus.  Of course, in order to explore these predictions for Bassenthwaite Lake, \nwe used a second, more complex, model. \n The PROTECH simulations produced a greater range of response curves than \n 15\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nEquation 3 and were less smooth in nature.  The latter reflects the interactions \nbetween the eight species with their different traits and, whilst interesting, such \ncompetitive interactions were not the focus of this study.   Rather the broad overall \nchanges were compared to the simple Vollenweider responses.  The winter curves \nshowed little response, regardless of phosphorus source; under such poor \nenvironmental conditions (low temperatures and light levels), net growth was very \nlow.  In the summer, both curves agreed with those predicted by Equation 3, with \nshortening retention time causing a decrease in chlorophyll under point source \nconditions and an increase under diffuse conditions.  The explanation for this lies in \none of the fundamental assumptions behind the original Vollenweider model, namely \nthat phosphorus is controlling the amount of chlorophyll in the lake (see Equation 3).  \nIn the PROTECH simulations, growth limiting concentrations of phosphorus (<3 mg \nm-3, Reynolds (1984)) occurred only in the summer period.  This meant that during \nthe rest of the year, the supply of phosphorus to the lake was less important than the \ndirect flushing of phytoplankton, leading to a decrease in biomass with increasing \ndischarge.  However, in the summer diffuse scenario, the increased flow brought with \nit vitally important extra phosphorus as well as a reduced sedimentation rate, leading \nto an increase in biomass; this is in accordance with the first term of the right-hand \nside of Equation 2. \n Given the two different response curves for 100% diffuse or point sources and \nthe fact that most lakes experience varying ratios of both types of nutrient source \n(Anthony & Lyons, 2007), it was important to see if altering the split between the two \nwas a gradual, even transition or involved sudden changes.  The evidence from this \nstudy suggested that the former was generally the case (Fig. 4) although other growth \nlimiting factors in PROTECH made the transition with changing ratio less regular \n 16\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwith longer retention times.  The ratio scenarios (Fig. 4) illustrated that the increase in \nchlorophyll at short retention times was dependent on the diffuse supply being \ndominant; with only a 20-30% reduction in the diffuse source contribution, the \nbiomass accumulation was no longer positive under high flushing conditions.  This \nshowed that even in the summer, the loss processes associated with high discharges \nwere generally more dominant than the benefits of increased nutrient supply and \nreduced sedimentation.  Finally, it is worth briefly commenting on the discontinuous \nchange in summer mean chlorophyll observed around retention times of c. 90 days \n(Fig. 4b). The abruptness of the change was sharpest with the increasing proportion of \nthe point source and was caused primarily by changes in Planktothrix biomass.  \nCloser analysis of this threshold showed that the increase in Planktothrix with longer \nretention times was connected to more SRP being available, allowing Planktothrix to \ngradually establish a larger population, shading out the other species and reducing the \ntotal chlorophyll.  This phytoplankton type in PROTECH has demonstrated rapid-\nchange responses like this before, such as when the model was used to investigate the \nintermediate disturbance hypothesis (Elliott et al., 2001) and shows how more \ncomplex models can produced more complex outcomes. \n The timing of the start and end of the blooms showed similar patterns of \nresponse to each other and to those observed in our Blelham Tarn study (Jones and \nElliott, 2007).  For the starting day of the bloom, the lack of difference between the \nnutrient source treatments was again due to the lake being replete with nutrients and \nthe delay simply due to the increase flushing loss under the high discharge scenarios.  \nThe marked difference between the nutrient scenarios response curves for the end of \nthe bloom was due to the scarcity of nutrients under the conditions of diffuse source \nand low flow i.e. low overall nutrient supply led to more rapid bloom termination.  \n 17\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nWith a point source and low flow, nutrients were largely not limiting, hence the \nbloom was more prolonged (Fig. 5a). \n The seasonal average discharge pattern scenarios were introduced in this study \nto try and correct for any potential complexity that was being caused by the specific \ndischarge pattern being used.  They produced response curves that were similar to \nthose derived from the observed 1996 discharge pattern except for the significant \nexception of the summer mean chlorophyll with a 100% diffuse phosphorus source \n(Fig. 6b).  This curve declined with shortening retention time, in marked contrast to \nthe curve in Figure 4b.  It was suspected that this difference was, again, due to the \nphosphorus supply and indeed this was the case; the averaged summer discharge \nconditions simply supplied enough phosphorus to preventing it reaching persistent \nlimiting levels and thus the effects implied in Equation 2 did not apply.  Therefore, we \nalso ran simulations where the overall inflow phosphorus concentration was reduced \nand saw a reduced rate of decrease in summer mean chlorophyll with increasing \ndischarge and low nutrient (Fig. 7), thus clearly proving how important it was to have \na limiting in-lake phosphorus concentration to produce the diffuse source curve of \nEquation 2 (Fig. 1). \n Drawing together these various responses, it seems clear that Equations 2 and \n3 have their limitations compared to the more complex PROTECH model when \napplied to a specific lake.  Taking each nutrient source response curve in turn, the \n100% point source relationship seemed the more robust in that its general shape was \nsimilar between the two models used.  This is perhaps unsurprising, because it has the \nleast complex driving factor of the two; the increasing discharge just flushes out more \nand more nutrients and phytoplankton.  This latter effect is regarded as the most \ntypical response by phytoplankton to an increasingly flushed system (Dickman, 1969; \n 18\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nKalff, 2002).  However, for 100% point source, the PROTECH model produced an \nupward sloping asymptotic curve compared to the continuingly rising curve of \nEquation 3.  This happened because PROTECH, being a single lake model that \ncalculates daily chlorophyll values, accounts for other growth limiting factors not \npresent in the original, statistically derived, Vollenweider model which seeks to model \na huge range of lake types and provide an annual mean value.  In the case of the \nscenarios run in this study, the most important one was light limitation caused by self-\nshading.  This was also found to be the case by Reynolds\u2019 (1992) assessment of the \nVollenweider model which showed that the chlorophyll to phosphorus yield could not \nincrease indefinitely and that some other factor would eventually cap the chlorophyll \nyield (e.g. light or nitrogen availability). \n Understanding the effect of the diffuse source was more complex.  It seems \nclear that the Equation 3 prediction of mean chlorophyll being fairly unresponsive at \nlong retention times is supported by PROTECH, but at lower retention times there can \nbe a marked difference.  Thus, within the scope of the scenarios tested in this lake \nsystem, only under one set of circumstances can PROTECH produce a relationship \ncomparable to Equation 3\u2019s output and, as was shown clearly with the seasonal \naverage flow scenarios, this was dependent on phosphorus availability being limiting.  \nTherefore, only under these precise circumstances would the increase in flow bring \nsufficient net-benefit to the phytoplankton populations.   \nRelating the modelled outputs of this study to specific case-studies was quite \nchallenging because studies focusing on such high flushing in lakes, particularly in the \nsummer, are rare (these rates are more typical of rivers).  Nevertheless, there are some \nexamples of increasing biomass production under very high flushing conditions.  For \nexample, the very shallow lakes (mean depth 1.1-1.2 m) of the Pampa Plain \n 19\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n(Argentina) were reported to have increased summer total chlorophyll and phosphorus \n(primarily from agriculture, i.e. diffuse sources) when the retention time decreased to \n< 15 days (Rennella & Quir\u00f3s, 2006) and there have been similar responses observed \nin comparable systems that regularly experience such low retention times (Van den \nBrink et al., 1994; Walz & Welker, 1998).  However, these systems are all considered \nhypertrophic, so nutrients are unlikely to be limiting, although there are other studies \nthat show a similar response pattern and also nutrient limitation (Turner et al., 1983).  \nAnother study found an increase in in-lake phosphorus occurred with increasing \ndischarge, but phytoplankton growth was curtailed by the raised turbidity caused by \nthe flushing (Vanni et al., 2006).  The influence on growth of other factors linked to \nchanges in retention time again shows the limitations of a model as simple as equation \n2.  Clearly, though, there is still a need for further research on this topic, particularly \nat the species level. \n \nConclusions \nIt would appear that variations in retention time, irrespective of discharge pattern, can \nhave large influences on phytoplankton populations under several combined \nconditions.  These are when the dominant source of phosphorus is point and the \nretention time is < 90-100 days, or simply when the retention time is < c.30 days.  \nThese results find further support in that it has been often found that retention times \ngreater than 100 days are inconsequential in terms of their influence on growth rate \n(S\u00f8balle & Kimmel, 1987; Kimmel, Lind & Paulson, 1990; Reynolds, 2006) and, \nsecondly, that lakes regularly experiencing retention days < 30 days struggle to \nsupport Planktothrix populations (Reynolds, 2006).  Finally, both models show that if \nfuture climate change causes the predicted reduction in rainfall that could be seen in \n 20\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nmainly regions, the response of a lake to a change in its retention time will be greatly \ndependent on the nutrient source.  Thus, if summer flows were low in a point source \nsystem limited by phosphorus, chlorophyll is likely to increase and conversely in a \ndiffuse system, it would decrease. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the British Atmospheric Data Centre and Mr B.C.
