There is increasing recognition of the\nneed for non-drug approaches and TENS may have a significant role to play. Only two studies met eligibility criteria for this review.\nTENS was given to five participants in one study and 41 participants in the other. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to\njudge whether TENS should be used in adults with cancer-related pain. Further research using well designed clinical trials is needed to\nimprove knowledge in this field.\nB A C K G R O U N D\nThere are many reasons why a patient with cancer may experience\npain and these include pain associated with the disease, pain as-\nsociated with the cancer treatments and any associated co-morbid\nconditions. The mainstay of cancer pain management has pre-\ndominantly used the biomedical approach including drug ther-\napy, medical or surgical treatments (Turk 1998). However, it is\nclear that cancer-related pain is complex and multidimensional\nand there is a definite need for amulti-disciplinary team approach,\nutilising non-pharmacological and innovative approaches. Physi-\ncal treatments such as electrical stimulation may have a role for a\nsignificant number of patients (Simpson 2000).\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-in-\nvasive therapeutic intervention which has been widely used for\nmany years to manage a range of acute and chronic pain prob-\nlems (Johnson 2002; Walsh 1997). TENS is used in a variety\nof clinical settings and has gained popularity with both patients\nand healthcare professionals of different disciplines. TENS devices\nhave many advantages in that they are portable, easy to use, have\nrelatively few side-effects or contra-indications and allow the user\nautonomy over their pain control.\nThere are several types of TENS application which are used in\nclinical practice but the twomost common are high frequency, low\nintensity (conventional) TENS (LF-TENS) and low frequency,\nhigh intensity (acupuncture-like) TENS (AL-TENS).More recent\ndevelopments of TENS have evolved with the aim of improving\nthe efficacy of TENS and these include \u2019burst\u2019 and \u2019modulated\u2019\nmodes of stimulation. The clinical use of conventional TENS is\nunderpinned by the gate control theory of pain (Melzack 1965)\nwhich suggests that there is a \u2019gating\u2019mechanism in the dorsal horn\nof the spinal cord which can control nociceptive signals and ulti-\nmately influence the pain experience. In summary, the stimulation\nof large diameter (A-beta) afferent fibres is thought to \u2019close the\ngate\u2019 and reduce the perception of pain. Acupuncture-like TENS\nmainly stimulates A-delta and C fibres and is therefore thought\nto achieve pain control mostly through the descending pain sup-\npression system. In essence, acupuncture-like TENS is thought to\nhelp close the gateway of pain transmission and hence result in a\nreduction in pain.\nThere are currently five Cochrane Systematic Reviews addressing\nthe use of TENS for benign pain (Brosseau 2003; Carroll 2001;\nKhadilkar 2005; Osiri 2000; Proctor 2005) as well as excellent\n2Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for cancer pain in adults (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nreview articles (Bjordal 2003; Johnson 2001; Reeve 1996). There\nis some controversy over the use of TENS in chronic pain, with\nmost review papers citing the need for further research using large\nmulti-centre RCTs. The single available review in cancer pain ad-\ndresses non-drug approaches for symptoms related to cancer and\nincludes the evidence on TENS for painmanagement (Pan 2000).\nAlthough experts in the field suggest that TENS has an important\nrole in the management of cancer-related pain (Filshie 2000) it is\nclear that there is currently no guidance for clinicians on the use\nof TENS for oncology and palliative care patients. The clinical\nbenefit of TENS for cancer patients with pain remains controver-\nsial. A Cochrane review of TENS in acute pain is currently being\nundertaken (Walsh 2006).\nThe aim of this Cochrane review is to determine the effectiveness\nof TENS in themanagement of cancer-related pain and to provide\nguidance for healthcare professionals and patients on the optimal\nparameters of TENS for best pain relief.\nO B J E C T I V E S\nTo establish the effectiveness of TENS in the management of can-\ncer-related pain in adults.\nM E T H O D S\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\nTypes of studies\nOnly randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (crossover and parallel\ndesign) were included; those investigating the use of TENS for the\nmanagement of cancer-related pain in adults where the control\n(placebo) group was clearly defined and was either:\n1. no active stimulation or,\n2. no treatment.\nComparisons of TENS with active treatment were not included.\nTypes of participants\nParticipants were 18 years of age or older. They had experienced\ncancer-related pain, unspecified or persistent cancer treatment-re-\nlated pain, or both, for a minimum of three months after any anti-\ncancer treatment had been completed. Pain was classified based\non commonly used verbal rating scales or pain interference scales.\nTypes of interventions\nOnly studies that evaluated transcutaneous electrical stimula-\ntion administered using a standard TENS device that delivered\nmonophasic or biphasic pulsed electrical currents in the mA range\nwere included. Studies that used percutaneous electrical stimula-\ntion were not included. We considered Conventional TENS as\nadministered using any TENS device which delivered a \u201cstrong\nbut comfortable\u201d electrical sensation either:\ni. in an area of pain where sensation is present,\nii. over nerve bundles proximal to the site of pain.\nOur definition of appropriate TENS delivery also included the use\nof Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation devices (NMES) and In-\nterferential current devices, providing that a \u201cstrong but comfort-\nable\u201d electrical sensation was produced. Any parameters of treat-\nment which resulted in this were considered, as was any duration\nand frequency of treatment. TENS is typically delivered using\nat least two surface electrodes; however, studies involving single\nelectrical probes (i.e. TENS pens) were also included providing\nthat a \u201cstrong but comfortable\u201d electrical sensation was produced.\nThis included the placement of electrodes over an area of pain\nthat co-incidentally included acupuncture points. Given the above\nphysiological criteria, TENS delivered at intensities reported to be\n\u201cbarely perceptible\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d were excluded.\nTypes of outcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was patient reported pain using\nvalidated scales (e.g. visual analogue scales (VAS), numerical rating\nscales). Secondary outcome measures included any of the follow-\ning:\n\u2022 patient satisfaction,\n\u2022 function,\n\u2022 range of movement,\n\u2022 quality of life,\n\u2022 mood,\n\u2022 pain coping,\n\u2022 sleep,\n\u2022 analgesic consumption,\n\u2022 hospital attendance and other healthcare interventions e.g.\nphysiotherapy visits, hospice admissions, and\n\u2022 adverse events - major and minor.\nIdeally, studies would take outcome measures before, during and\nafter stimulation but studies which did not do this were not ex-\ncluded. We wanted to perform subgroup analyses on outcomes of\ngreater than or equal to 30% reduction in pain from baseline but\nthis was not possible.\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nThe Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psych-\nINFO, AMED and PEDRO physiotherapy databases were\n3Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for cancer pain in adults (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nsearched on the 11th of April 2008. Detailed search strategies\nwere developed for each database searched, based on the strategy\nfor MEDLINE but revised appropriately for each database. Vari-\nous foreign language databases were also searched with the terms\noutlined below. Reference lists of eligible trials were reviewed to\nidentify further studies. Relevant RCTs were identified using the\nfollowing search strategy combined with the Cochrane Sensitive\nSearch Strategy for RCTs {as published in Appendix 5b in the\nCochrane Reviewers\u2019Handbook for Systematic Reviews (Alderson\n2004)}. Our MEDLINE search strategy for this review can be\nseen in Appendix 1 and all other search strategies can be seen in\nAppendix 2.\nData collection and analysis\nStudy selection\nThe search strategy identified 36 published studies which were di-\nvided between twopairs of review authors that decided on study se-\nlection. An additional seven published studies that were not iden-\ntified by the search strategy were identified from reference lists and\ncontact with authors. A study eligibility form was used to screen\neach abstract which identified whether the study was randomised,\nparticipants were adults with cancer related pain, the study com-\npared TENS with another control group, and reported pain re-\nlated outcomes. Where study eligibility could not be determined\nfrom the abstract, the full paper was obtained and assessed by one\npair of review authors.\nData extraction\nA standardised data extraction sheet was used to collect informa-\ntion on authors, participants, trial design, characteristics of inter-\nventions (TENS settings, application, treatment schedule, concur-\nrent interventions), adverse effects and baseline and end of study\noutcomes. The quality of the studies was assessed independently\nby two review authors using the validated five-point Oxford Qual-\nity Scale (Jadad 1996) which considers the method of randomi-\nsation, blinding and the description of withdrawals or drop-outs.\nKR was not involved in this process as one of her publications was\nassessed. Final scores were discussed and agreed between all four\nreview authors.\nAnalysis\nThe small sample sizes and differences in patient study populations\nof the two included studies prevented meta-analysis.\nR E S U L T S\nDescription of studies\nSee:Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded\nstudies.\nIn total 43 published studies were identified, of which only two\nmet our eligibility criteria for review (Gadsby 1997; Robb 2007).\nThe most common reasons for exclusion were non-randomised\nstudies and the published source contained no clinical data (i.e.\neducational reviews). A full list of the 41 excluded studies and the\nreasons for exclusion is provided in the \u2019Characteristics of excluded\nstudies\u2019 table.\nThe two RCTs included in our review were heterogenous with\nrespect to study population, sample size, study design, method-\nological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of\nadministration and outcome measures used (Gadsby 1997; Robb\n2007). Participants who had previously used TENSwere excluded\nin both studies. Robb 2007, who is also a member of this review\nteam, compared conventional TENS with Transcutaneous Spinal\nElectroanalgesia (TSE) and sham TSE in 49 cancer survivors with\nchronic pain associated with breast cancer treatment. The inves-\ntigators attempted to mimic clinical practice and used treatment\nfor three weeks duration of each intervention with participants\nalso self-treating at home as needed. They assessed outcome using\nmeasures for pain, anxiety and depression and physical function-\ning. Gadsby 1997 investigated acupuncture-like TENS for cancer\npain or nausea and vomiting, or both, in 15 terminally ill par-\nticipants. The investigators administered TENS for 30 minutes\ndaily for five days and assessed the outcome using a quality of life\nquestionnaire and a performance status score (see \u2019Characteristics\nof included studies\u2019 table for more details).\nRisk of bias in included studies\nRobb 2007 scored four points and Gadsby 1997 scored three\npoints on the five-point Oxford Quality Scale (Jadad 1996).\nEffects of interventions\nRobb 2007 found no significant differences in pain relief scores\nbetweenTENS or shamTSE. There were also no significant differ-\nences in any of the other outcome measures, except one dimension\nof a patient satisfaction questionnaire where TENS was consid-\nered significantly more effective than sham TSE. Twenty six of 41\nwomen (63%) who completed the study decided to continue with\na device on completion of the trial and of these, the majority (n =\n13) decided to continue with TENS, as opposed to shamTSE (n =\nsix). The majority of the women continuing with TENS were still\nusing it to good effect at three months (n = 14) and 12 months (n\n= ten), with those using sham TSE to good effect at three months\nand 12 months, n = four and n = two respectively. Overall, TENS\nappeared to be well tolerated, women found TENS easy to use and\nfew reported difficulties with electrode placement. Adverse effects\nwere monitored and reported and were minimal in this study.\nGadsby 1997 did not detect any statistically significant differences\nbetween AL-TENS and sham AL-TENS. However, the study was\n4Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for cancer pain in adults (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nunderpowered with only five participants randomised into each of\nthe three treatment groups and only 13 participants completing\nthe study.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nThe results of this systematic review examining the effectiveness\nof TENS for cancer pain in adults are inconclusive due to a lack of\nsuitableRCTs.Only twoRCTsmet the inclusion criteria for review\nand heterogeneity of these RCTs prevented meta-analysis. The\nstudieswere differentwith respect to study population, sample size,\nstudy design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment\nduration, method of administration and outcome measures used.\nThe larger study (Robb 2007) scored four out of five for theOxford\nQuality Score and provided little evidence that TENSwas superior\nto a placebo in treating women with chronic pain following breast\ncancer treatment. The smaller study (Gadsby 1997) scored three\nout of five and provided no evidence that TENS was significantly\nbetter than placebo in treating pain in palliative care patients. We\nare unable to comment on important clinical issues such as optimal\ntreatment parameters as there was insufficient data for analysis.\nThere have beennoprevious systematic reviews onTENS in cancer\npain and only one review paper has been published (Pan 2000).\nThis paper reviewed the use of complementary and alternative\nmedicine tomanage pain and other symptoms associated with end\nof life. Four studies on TENS were discussed (Avellanosa 1982;\nGadsby 1997; Ostrowski 1979 and Wen 1977), one of which was\nincluded in our review (Gadsby 1997). Pan 2000 concluded that\nTENS, along with a range of other interventions, may provide\npain relief in palliative patients with pain but acknowledged that\nthere is a paucity of data to support this. A major criticism of the\nmajority of studies found in the literature search is that they were\nmostly case-series or non-randomised studies and the bulk of these\nstudies were published in the 1970s and 1980s.\nA major criticism of both RCTs found in the literature search is\nthat they were undersized and lacked sufficient power to detect\nsignificant differences. Robb 2007 performed power calculations\nbut failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants whereas\nGadsby 1997 did not perform any power calculations. Adequate\nblinding was an issue in both studies with Robb 2007 failing to\nblind the assessor and Gadsby 1997 failing to provide sufficient\ninformation on how blinding was performed.\nIn summary, there is insufficient evidence to judge whether TENS\nshould be used in adults with cancer-related pain. Further research\nis needed to improve knowledge in this field.\nA U T H O R S \u2019 C O N C L U S I O N S\nImplications for practice\nThe evidence from two RCTs provides insufficient evidence to\njudge whether TENS should be used to manage cancer-related\nand cancer treatment-related pain.\nImplications for research\nLarge multi-centre RCTs are required to assess the value of TENS\nin the management of cancer-related pain. Attention should be\ngiven to:\n\u2022 power calculations to ensure adequate sample sizes;\n\u2022 selection of participants to ensure homogeneity of pain\nconditions under study;\n\u2022 optimal stimulation parameters and treatment schedules;\n\u2022 use of valid, reliable outcome measures to assess all\ndimensions of pain;\n\u2022 short and long-term follow-ups; and\n\u2022 cost analysis in comparison to standard treatment i.e.\nmedications.\nA C K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nWe would like to acknowledge the work of: Sheila Leadbeater,\nSenior NHS Librarian in the Leeds General Infirmary in develop-\ning our search strategy; Jessica Thomas, Cochrane Pain, Palliative\nand Supportive Care Review Group Co-ordinator for her ongoing\nsupport; Phil Wiffen, Co-ordinating Editor of the Cochrane Pain,\nPalliative and Supportive Care Review Group for his feedback on\nthe protocol.\n5Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for cancer pain in adults (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration.
