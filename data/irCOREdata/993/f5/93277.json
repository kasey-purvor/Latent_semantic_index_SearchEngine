More than \u00a36 in every \u00a3100 of national\nincome goes through the National Insurance system, making it as important\nwithin the public finances as paying for the National Health Service.\nLarge parts of the system still rest \u2013 albeit with substantial later modification \u2013\non the foundation of Beveridge\u2019s 1942 report, Social insurance and allied services.\nHis plan was for a comprehensive scheme of what he firmly saw as insurance to\ncover the main contingencies which led to Want in the 1930s: unemployment,\nsickness and old age. It was based on flat-rate contributions leading to flat-rate\nbenefits. In that way it was not redistributive, but, as it worked through a national\npool, those at low risk did subsidise those generally poorer people at high risk,\n348 john hills\nunlike private insurance. The system was work-based: if in work, you paid the\n\u2018stamp\u2019; if you lost work, you got benefit. As Beveridge put it:\nBenefit in return for contributions, rather than free allowances from the State, is what the\npeople of Britain desire . . . Payment of a substantial part of the cost of benefits as a contribution\nirrespective of the means of the contributor is the firm basis of a claim to benefit irrespective of\nmeans. (Beveridge, 1942: para. 21)\nOver the last 60 years, many others have argued powerfully for and have\neloquently defended the principles of social insurance. The article starts with\na summary of some of the key arguments. This is followed by a recapitulation\nof the current structure of National Insurance, a brief discussion of why the\nsystem has ended up in this form, and the implications of these arguments\nfor its future development. The article then looks in more detail at how state\npensions \u2013 which account for five-sixths of all national insurance benefits \u2013 have\ndeveloped, and are now planned to develop. It discusses some issues raised by\nthese developments, and an alternative to them. It concludes by discussing the\nimplications for National Insurance as a whole of such changes.\nThe fundamental questions posed in the article are why, given the strength\nof the arguments which have been put for a National Insurance system, is it in\nfact in such decline and, given this decline, where should we go from here? More\nthan 60 years after the Beveridge Report, which led to the post-War National\nInsurance system, should it be heading for retirement?\nWhat is National Insurance?\nGiven the widespread lack of popular understanding, it may be helpful to\nsummarise the main features of National Insurance:\n\u0001 Its key characteristic is that it is a contributory system, with special taxes \u2013\nNational Insurance Contributions (NICs) \u2013 paying for the benefits paid out.\nIt is the main example of earmarking or \u2018hypothecation\u2019 in the UK public\nfinances.\n\u0001 Beveridge\u2019s idea of flat rate, Poll Tax-style contributions was abandoned in\nthe early 1960s and contributions are today based on a percentage of earnings\nabove a threshold (of \u00a389 per week in 2003\u201304).1\n\u0001 The overwhelming bulk of the spending is on pensions: five-sixths of National\nInsurance benefits spending in 2003\u201304 were on the flat rate state pension or\nearnings-related additions to it. But contributory benefits also include Widows\nPensions, Incapacity Benefit, Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (for up to six months\nnowadays) and maternity allowances.2 These differ from other benefits in that\nthey are dependent both on a particular contingency and on someone having\na satisfactory \u2018contributions record\u2019.\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 349\n\u0001 When people have been asked what NICs pay for, they suggest \u2018hospitals or\nthe NHS\u2019 first, with most mentioning pensions as well (Stafford, 1998). In fact,\nless then a tenth of NICs have actually gone towards the NHS in recent years\n(although the proceeds from the increases in contributions in April 2003 will\ncontribute to rising NHS spending).\n\u0001 Originally, National Insurance was funded from three sources: employees,\nemployers, and the State. It was this combination which allowed Lloyd George\nto promise workers \u2018ninepence for fourpence\u2019 when the original, more limited,\nversion of National Insurance started in 1911. The Treasury Supplement was\nphased out in the 1980s. It made a brief reappearance in the mid-1990s, but\ntoday NI benefits are paid for entirely by contributions \u2013 indeed, the so-called\n\u2018National Insurance Fund\u2019 runs a surplus and is likely to continue to do so\n(but the net effect is a contribution to general government revenues rather\nthan accumulation of funds genuinely walled off from the rest of the public\nfinances).\nThe contributory principle\nThe heart of Beveridge\u2019s system was straightforward: those who pay in\ncontributions when at work are then entitled to benefits when out of work or\nretired. This is what the \u2018contributory principle\u2019 meant. Under the strongest kind\nof contributory principle, in private insurance, the contributions (premiums)\nmade are actuarially linked to the potential value \u2013 allowing for individual risk\nand life expectancy \u2013 of the benefits. Under social insurance of the Bismarckian\nkind in countries such as Germany and France, risks are pooled but there is still a\nstrong link between contributions and benefits in that both are earnings-related.\nThose who pay in more because of higher earnings at work are then entitled to\nhigher pensions or benefits when unemployed.\nThe UK system has evolved with a weaker contributory principle: contri-\nbutions are mostly earnings-related, but benefits are now mostly flat rate (apart\nfrom the state second pension \u2013 what used to be called SERPS \u2013 and, as explained\nbelow, that is also becoming less earnings-related than it was). In theory, making\ncontributions is still what gives benefit entitlement:\n\u0001 Except for those disqualified despite contributions, for instance: those who\nhave not paid in for enough years to get the pension; or who did not contribute\nenough in the last two tax years before the benefit year in which a claim begins;\nor if entitlement has run out, for instance after six months on Jobseeker\u2019s\nAllowance; or if claiming Incapacity Benefit while getting other pensions (in\nwhich case it will be cut back by half of these).\n\u0001 And, people can be \u2018credited in\u2019 without making actual contributions for the\nfirst two years of education after 16; or if caring for a child or disabled person;\nor \u2013 recently for maternity allowance \u2013 if earning over \u00a330 per week, well below\n350 john hills\nthe contributions threshold; or, more generally since 2001, if earning above\nthe old \u2018Lower Earnings Limit\u2019, but below the more generous new \u2018primary\nthreshold\u2019 for contributions.\nWhat we have is in fact a very weak contributory principle: benefitsmainly depend\non the fact of having made contributions, but people can receive \u2018contributory\nbenefits\u2019 without having made contributions, and can be ruled out of entitlement\ndespite having made contributions.\nWhy has the British system ended up like this? There are, after all, very strong\narguments for social insurance, as opposed to other kinds of benefits, and ones\nthat have proved enduring in continental systems and for what is in fact the\nlargest part of the US benefits system:\n\u0001 They are a manifestation of social solidarity, through their pooling of risks \u2013\nan argument that proved very popular at the height of the Second World War\nas the Beveridge Report was published.\n\u0001 Benefits come as a right, as a result of paying contributions. As Titmuss put\nit, \u2018One fundamental historical reason for the adoption of the principle was\nthe aim of making services available and accessible to the whole population\nin such ways as would not involve users in any humiliating loss of status,\ndignity or self-respect\u2019 (2001: 117). As a consequence, not only is life better\nfor the recipients, but it should also mean higher take-up and hence greater\neffectiveness in preventing poverty than stigmatised benefits that people fail to\nclaim.\n\u0001 Because they depend on a contingency such as old age or unemployment rather\nthan a means-test, disincentives to additional self-provision are minimised.3\n\u0001 It is in origin a work-based system. This has two sides to it. The entitlements\nboost the return to formal, declared work (or at least, offset the resultant\ntaxes and contributions). Also, as Atkinson (1995) has argued, the existence\nof unemployment insurance can be seen historically as a form of subsidy to\nemployment in the industrial sector, and as improving the working of the\nindustrial labour market.\nFinally, there may be greater willingness \u2013 or at least less reluctance \u2013 to pay\ncontributions for a clear purpose like this than taxes into a general pool. The\nword \u2018may\u2019 is important here: what evidence there is of public attitudes suggests\nthat people do not make a very big distinction between contributions and other\ntaxes (Stafford, 1998; Hedges and Bromley, 2001). The word \u2018clear\u2019 may also be\nimportant: as Hedges and Bromley put it, \u2018it may be that the less [National\nInsurance] is thought to be dedicated to Health and Social Security, the more it\nis seen as just another tax.\u2019\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 351\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n48 53 58 63 68 73 78 83 88 93 98 03\n%\n o\nf G\nDP\n Tax credits\nMeans-tested \nNon-contributory\nWar pensions\nOther contributory\nContributory pensions\nFigure 1. Social security benefits 1948\/9\u20132003\/4.\nSource: DWP Benefit Expenditure Tables (http:\/\/www.dwp.gov.uk\/asd\/asd4\/expenditure\/asp).\nWhat has happened to National Insurance?\nSo what has happened to the scope of National Insurance since the post-\nWar system was established in 1948? Contributions in 2003\u201304 represented about\n6.5 per cent of national income. Contributory benefits in 2003\u201304 are forecast to\nbe just over 5 per cent of national income. As Figure 1 shows, this is down from\ntheir peak of 6.5 per cent of national income 20 years ago. But more strikingly,\ncontributory benefits and pensions are a much smaller share of the total than\nthey used to be. The growth in social security as a share of GDP in the last 20 years\nhas come from a combination of non-contributory contingency-based benefits\n(such as extra costs benefits for disabled people) and means-tested benefits. At\ntheir peak in the 1960s and 1970s contributory benefits accounted for 70 per\ncent of all social security spending. They are now less than 45 per cent of the\ntotal.\nThis has happened for several reasons. One is the decline in the relative value\nof contributory benefits. Compared to average earnings, the basic state pension\nhas been falling pretty well continuously since its peak in 1979, and what used to be\nUnemployment Benefit for longer, since its link to the pension ended in 1973. But\nthe thresholds for means-tested benefits have not fallen as fast in relative terms.\nIn 1978, the single basic pension was 24.7 per cent of average full-time earnings,\nand the means-tested minimum (then called Supplementary Benefit) for most\nsingle pensioners was 25.2 per cent. Apart from the important complications of\nHousing Benefit, only a small amount of other income could carry someone clear\nof the sharpest means-testing. By 2002 the basic pension had fallen to 16.2 per\ncent of average earnings (\u00a3465 per week in April 2002 for full-time adult workers),\nbut what was then the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) was 21.1 per cent of\nthem. There was a much larger gap to get over to get clear of the MIG. As a result,\n352 john hills\nmany recipients of contributory benefits also receive a means-tested top-up \u2013\nfor instance, one in seven of those getting the basic pension had it topped up by\nIncome Support in 2001. For them, the contributory benefits make no difference\nto their incomes.\nBut this has not been the only issue. The story of the last 55 years (from\nthe very start, and the differences between what was actually implemented and\nBeveridge\u2019s recommendations) has been one of only a few battles won for the\ncontributory principle that is supposedly at the heart of National Insurance, but of\nmany more lost.4 When decisions have been made about the future development\nof social security, few have reinforced the idea of a system based around National\nInsurance benefits linked in any strong way to past contributions. The failure of\nthe 1997\u20131998 Minister for Welfare Reform, Frank Field, to convince the Treasury\nunder New Labour to revitalise contributory benefits may well have represented\nthe last battle for the contributory principle in the UK.\nThe introduction of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS)\nfrom 1978did try to re-establish a strong link between what were by then earnings-\nrelated contributions and subsequent benefits. However, it came 20 years too late\nto create an embedded system seen as the main source of income replacement\nfor middle and higher income groups, of a kind which has resulted in the strong\npolitical defence of continental social insurance schemes. By the late 1950s, one\nthird of those at work were already covered by occupational pension schemes.\nWhen mildly earnings-related (\u2018graduated\u2019) state pensions were introduced in\n1961, members of such schemes were allowed to \u2018contract out\u2019 in return for lower\ncontributions. This principle was carried over into SERPS, arguably the key factor\nin the system\u2019s later lack of resilience when its generosity was cut back in the 1980s,\nand its structure altered in the late 1990s. As Clasen argues, contrasting the British\ncase with other European social insurance systems:\nthe decline of the contributory principle in Britain would be difficult to comprehend without\nrecourse to the role of earnings-related transfers. Essentially, because of the poverty rather\nthan wage-replacement orientation, there is a much weaker incentive structure for contributors\n(employees and employers) to be involved in matters of social insurance (2001: 651).\nThis pattern, of \u2018contributory\u2019 benefits becoming less related to contributions\nand declining in importance as a share of social security spending, is not\naccidental. When governments of the Left have been in power, arguments in\nfavour of inclusion have been predominant, non-contributory benefits have been\nexpanded, and contribution conditions have been softened to \u2018credit in\u2019 people\nwith low earnings or interrupted work histories. When governments of the Right\nhave been in power, particularly in the 1980s, contribution conditions have been\nmade tougher and the emphasis has been on focusing limited resources on the\npoorest through means-testing. New Labour, interestingly, has done both.\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 353\nShould the system survive?\nIn the light of this history, the five arguments summarised above for contributory\nbenefits now look distinctly battered:\n\u0001 The solidarity argument applied to rights based on full-time work is under-\nmined by the reality of today\u2019s labour market and society. If rights depended\nonly on work records, many would be excluded; hence the expansion of\n\u2018crediting in\u2019 within National Insurance and of non-contributory contingency-\nbased benefits to avoid this.\n\u0001 The complexity of the system and the obscurity of many conditions make it\nhard to describe the system as embodying clearly understood rights.\n\u0001 For many, contributory benefits are too low to avoid the need for means-tested\ntop-ups.\n\u0001 The links to work records and actual contributions are in fact so weak that it is\nhard to argue for strong labour market effects from people\u2019s recognition of the\nrights earned through contributions.5 New Labour\u2019s ideology could have been\nconsistent with a revitalised work-based system, but this is a road that has not\nbeen taken.\n\u0001 There is little link between contributions and benefits, either at the individual\nor the aggregate level, and the links that exist are incomprehensible to most.\nContributions are not in reality earmarked, and there is no truly separate\nNational Insurance Fund. If people are less unhappy about paying National\nInsurance than income tax, that is more a product of folk memory than of\ncurrent reality.\nThere is an apparently obvious conclusion: National Insurance has outlived its\nusefulness and should be swept away (Dilnot et al., 1984; Webb, 1994). In its place\nwe could either integrate National Insurance Contributions with income tax in a\nmuch cleaner, more rational system, or reconstitute them as a Social Security Tax.\nAs far as benefits are concerned, the job could be completed of replacing them\nwith either inclusive contingency-based benefits or, depending on ideological\ntaste, means-tested ones.\nBut while the arguments for a reinvigorated contributory system have\ndecisively lost the policy argument in recent years, the arguments for putting\nthe system out of its misery have not succeeded either. There are reasons for this\nas well:\n\u0001 First, despite the low level of public understanding of the system, there does\nappear to be a relatively strong popular commitment to the basic idea that\nthere is a system which you pay into, and then have rights to benefits from\n(Stafford, 1998). \u2018National Insurance\u2019 is still a good brand name.\n\u0001 The majority of what the welfare state as a whole does is in fact this kind\nof redistribution across people\u2019s life cycles rather than between people on a\n354 john hills\nlifetime basis (Falkingham and Hills, 1995). Titmuss (1955) once described the\npublic finances as being like Crewe junction, with traffic (transfers) in many\ndirections, rather than like a simple terminus with one-way one-dimensional\nflows from rich to poor. There is thus much to be said for a system that conveys\nthis idea. Given the imperfection of the system, this is close to saying that the\nsystem is a myth, but a useful myth for the population to believe in. Clasen even\nconcludes that, \u2018too much transparency might have a counterproductive effect\nin terms of diminishing rather than increasing legitimacy and support\u2019 (2001:\n655). But if a clearer, more honest, contract could be salvaged, encapsulating\nthe life cycle principle might be a point in favour of the system.\n\u0001 Most concretely, the bulk of the system is about pensions. Reinforcing the\nnotion that people pay into pension systems to accumulate later rights has\nfundamental advantages. More practically, people already have accumulated\nrights to both the basic and earnings-related pension. Governments have been\nvery reluctant to renege on such rights (as opposed to changing the rules for\nfuture accumulation). Such rights can persist for 70\u201380 years. As we shall see\nbelow, adapting them is a very slow process.\n\u0001 Fourth, almost the only part of the tax system that registers publicly is the basic\nrate of income tax. It is hard to see a government of any persuasion agreeing\nto absorption of NICs into income tax, and a rise of 11 or 24 points in the basic\nrate. Some form of separately labelled tax mimicking NICs will survive any\nreform.\n\u0001 Fifth, within the EU, migrant workers enjoy reciprocal rights to various benefits\nand pensions. Many of these rest on being an \u2018EU worker\u2019, as witnessed by\ncontributions into the more strongly contribution\u2013based systems in other\nmember states. We need some system that allows such reciprocal rights both\nfor British workers elsewhere, and for other nationals working here.\n\u0001 Finally, unless we were to move entirely to a means-tested system, benefits based\non contingency would have to meet some other test. Would UK residence be\nenough, so those spending the rest of their lives elsewhere could arrive and\nreceive, for instance, equal pension treatment to those who have \u2018paid in\u2019 all\ntheir lives? If not, would citizenship be the criterion? But if so, who would be\nexcluded despite paying in?\nState pensions now and in future\nGiven these conflicting arguments, where might we go? Titmuss (1955) described\nBeveridge as being a better guide to the 1930s than to the 1950s. He is unlikely to\nbe a perfect guide to the twenty-first century either, but some of his principles\nmay help. One may be his commitment to flat rate benefits rather than means-\ntested ones (which are lower for those with other income) or earnings-related\nones (which are higher for those who had higher earnings). As Table 1 shows,\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 355\nTABLE 1.

Forecast government spending on pensions.\nSource: DWP (2002).\nthe public appears strongly committed to the idea of flat rate benefits.6 This\nis particularly true of pensions and unemployment benefits. At the same time,\npeople consistently see the state pension as being too low: not one of the retired\nrespondents to the 2000 British Social Attitudes survey thought it was even a bit\n\u2018on the high side\u2019; half thought it was \u2018very low\u2019 (Hills, 2001).\nAs providing state pensions is five-sixths of what National Insurance benefits\ndo, it is worth examining how they are now planned to evolve. First, Figure 2\nshows the government\u2019s forecast of the share of national income to be spent on\nstate pensions of different kinds over the next fifty years.7 What is remarkable is\nthat the total is almost constant, at around 5 per cent of GDP, throughout the\nperiod despite the forecast that the ratio of the population over 65 to that aged\n15 to 64 will rise from 25 per cent in 2000 to 39 per cent in 2050 (DWP, 2002). It\ncontrasts greatly with other European countries, as shown in Figure 3.\nThis is achieved through a series of reforms whose long-run impact is perhaps\npoorly understood. First, Figure 4 shows a very simplified version of how things\n356 john hills\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nUK NL Spain Germany France Italy\n%\n o\nf \nG\nD\nP\n 2000 \n  2050\nFigure 3.

At any given\nearnings level, some would be entitled to a private pension, others not. As drawn,\nthe diagram shows the case where those with half average lifetime earnings or\nmore could receive a private pension of half their own average earnings.

Retiring in 1998.\nmany lower paid workers paid just above this level would not in fact receive\nsuch a pension, but most of those with nearer to average or higher earnings\nwould. At that time Supplementary Benefit (SB) for pensioners below 80 was\nfractionally above the basic pension. Anyone with only the basic pension, or\nwith only a partial pension, would have it topped up to this level (shown by\nthe cross-hatched area in the diagram). But \u2013 apart, again, from the important\ncomplication of Housing Benefit \u2013 the effect of the system was that beyond quite\na low level, people could benefit in full from any savings they had made through\nadditional private pensions.\nThrough the 1950s to the 1970s, a key debate was that many people did\nnot actually have an earnings-related pension of the kind illustrated at the top\nof the diagram, or as given through continental social insurance systems. After\ntwenty years of attempts, Barbara Castle\u2019s State Earnings Related Pension Scheme\n(SERPS) started in 1978. The result, for its greatest beneficiaries, who retired in\n1998, is shown in Figure 5, again greatly simplified. By then, the basic pension,\nlinked only to prices, had fallen to only 17 per cent of average earnings. But people\ncould \u2013 under the accelerated accrual rules that then applied \u2013 have accumulated\na full \u2018Additional Pension\u2019 (AP) under SERPS worth a quarter of their uprated\nearnings over the previous 20 years. For those with a private occupational pension,\nthey would most likely have \u2018contracted out\u2019 of SERPS in return for lower NICs\nwhen at work. Their total private pension would have two parts \u2013 the equivalent\nof the Additional Pension, and the rest (shown here as the private pension).\nMeanwhile Income Support (IS), as the safety net was now called, had fallen to 18\nper cent of average earnings \u2013 a wider gap than before above the basic pension.\nNote that what the combination of SERPS and the Thatcher government\u2019s\nabandonment of uprating with earnings growth had achieved was to lower the\n358 john hills\n0\n25\n50\n75\n0 25 50 75 100 125\nBasic pension\nAP (SERPS)\nS2P extra\nGuarantee credit\nSavings credit\nPension income as % average adult earnings\nLifetime earnings as % adult average\nFigure 6(a).

But this was at the cost of those\nwith low lifetime earnings, who lost more from the fall in the relative value of the\nbasic pension than they gained from SERPS. For later generations of retirees, the\nsituation would be worse, as SERPS was made less generous for them by changes\nin 1988.\nNew Labour has tried to grapple with this in three ways, as Figures 6 (a) and\n(b) show. These give the \u2013 again simplified \u2013 position for a single person retiring\naround 2018. Under the reforms, a further part of what will come from the state\n(the \u2018savings credit\u2019 part of the new Pension Credit) is affected by whether any\nprivate pension is received, so Figure 6 (a) shows the position for someone with\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 359\nno private pension at all, and Figure 6 (b) the position if there is a private pension\nof the kind shown before.\nBy 2018, a price-linked basic pension would be only 12 per cent of average\nearnings9 (although now going to some with lower relative earnings than would\nhave qualified before), and the earnings-related addition will be (mostly) based\non 20 per cent of average lifetime earnings. This leaves very low state pensions\nfor those earning below two-thirds of average earnings over their lifetime. In\nresponse, the government has boosted SERPS \u2013 now renamed the State Second\nPension (S2P) \u2013 for people earning below \u00a310,500 in 2002 terms, with some gains\nhigher up as well. The effect of this is shown in the diagrams by the horizontally\nshaded addition (\u2018S2P extra\u2019) to what would previously have been given through\nthe SERPS Additional Pension. The impact of these reforms phases in gradually\nby 2050, but by 2018 the reform will already begin to flatten out entitlements for\nthose below half average earnings.\nThe government has also increased the means-tested minimum for pensio-\nners \u2013 renaming it first as the Minimum Income Guarantee or MIG, but now as\nthe \u2018guarantee credit\u2019 \u2013 back up to 21 per cent of average earnings. The diagram\nshows that for those with less than half of average earnings, the total of the basic\npension, the Additional Pension, and the State Second Pension top-up is not\nquite enough to get a low earner clear of the MIG at the moment of retirement\nin 2018.\nThe third reform was the Pension Credit introduced in October 2003. Under\nthis, people with small occupational or additional pensions above the basic\npension get a little extra \u2013 the \u2018savings credit\u2019 (shaded with diamonds in the\nfigures) \u2013 above what was the MIG, so that they do gain something from their\nadditional self-provision (but subject to a withdrawal at a rate of 40 per cent\non any excess of income over the level of the guarantee credit). Someone with\nno private pension will still receive savings credit in respect of any State Second\nPension rights (under old or new rules), so total state pension rights in the\nabsence of any private pension are flattened further.\nWithout any private pension at all, the \u2018savings credit\u2019 element extends\nbeyond those with average earnings, potentially extending means-testing over a\nmuch wider range than before (but at a lower withdrawal rate than the 100 per\ncent under the old MIG). As can be seen in Figure 6 (b), however, even a relatively\nsmall private pension is enough to remove entitlement to the savings credit \u2013 the\nextension of means-testing is potentially wide, but quite shallow.\nBy 2038, the basic pension will be even lower (8 per cent of average earnings)\nbut the new State Second Pension will be more fully phased in. This creates the\nposition shown in Figure 7(a) for the case where there is no private pension,\nand in 7(b) for the case where there is for those above half average earnings.\nAs with the diagrams for 2018, these projections assume that both the basic\npension and the point at which people are credited into the system continue to be\n360 john hills\n0\n25\n50\n75\n0 25 50 75 100 125\nBasic pension\nAP (SERPS)\nS2P extra\nGuarantee credit\nSavings credit\nPension income as % average adult earnings\nLifetime earnings as % adult average\nFigure 7(a).

This compares\nthe total state support given on retirement to those with different lifetime\nearnings levels in 1978, 1998 and 2038. In 1978, this was almost flat at 25 per cent\nof average earnings \u2013 single people received much the same from the state whether\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 361\n0\n25\n50\n75\n0 25 50 75 100 125\n1978\n1998\n2038(no PP)\n2038 (C - 0)\nPension income as % average adult earnings\nLifetime earnings as % adult average\nFigure 8. State support: retiring 1978\u20132038.\nthey had little private income and were receiving Supplementary Benefit or had\nprivate pensions on top of the basic pension. By 1998 those with lifetime incomes\nbelow half the average would have received less from the state than this (as the\nrelative values of the MIG and basic pension had fallen), but those above would\nreceive more (from SERPS).\nTwo lines are shown for 2038. For someone without a private pension,\nstate support would rise from around 27 per cent of average earnings for those\nwith all but the lowest earnings to nearly 35 per cent for those with the highest\nearnings shown. The result of 60 years of reform would be a return towards\nthe point we began from in 1978, with total support again nearly flat, although\nat a slightly higher level in relation to future average earnings at the point of\nretirement (but lower later on in retirement as such benefits are planned to be\nprice-linked, whereas in 1978 the reasonable assumption would have been that\nthey would be earnings-linked after retirement). The end result when the reforms\nare fully phased in by 2050 is effectively to unwind Barbara Castle\u2019s attempt to\nturn Britain\u2019s state pensions into an earnings-related system along continental\nlines.\nBut how does this cost the state the same proportion of national income as\nnow if there are going to be nearly 60 per cent more people over 65 in relation to\nthe working age population? The often unappreciated answer lies in the fourth\nline \u2013 the cost to the state for those who are in private pensions and are \u2018contracted\nout\u2019 of the State Second Pension (as most are). This is much lower \u2013 partly because\n362 john hills\nof the way in which those with significant private pensions will not benefit from\nthe Pension Credit, but also because contracted-out private pensions pay part of\nwhat would otherwise come from the State Second Pension. In public finance\nterms, through the sacrifice of lower tax revenue today \u2013 achieved by \u2018contracting\nout rebates\u2019 \u2013 we are trying to stabilise the future costs of state pensions, despite\nthe ageing population.11 The reward for today\u2019s fiscal sacrifice is that private\npensions are intended to pick up part of the cost of future pensions that would\notherwise have been carried by the state.\nAre the reforms likely to survive?\nWhat these plans are intended to achieve is quite neat: to return state support\nto something much closer to a flat rate system, with more generous support for\nlow earners than in recent years, but to do so while keeping overall spending to\na fixed share of GDP despite an ageing population.\nDespite this, it seems unlikely that the reforms as presented here will survive\nintact. First, the combination of the different parts of the future state system\ndescribed in the previous section is, to say the least, rather hard to explain simply.\nEven before the full changes including the Pension Credit came in, few people\nclaimed that they understood pensions well. For instance, in 2002 only 13 per cent\nof working age respondents said that they had \u2018a good knowledge of pensions\nissues\u2019 and only 37 per cent \u2018a reasonable, basic knowledge\u2019 (Mayhew, 2003:\nTable 4.1). Nearly half, 49 per cent, said they only knew \u2018a bit about what concerns\nme\u2019 or knew \u2018little or nothing\u2019 (with slightly higher proportions in these categories\nthan in 2000).\nThis lack of understanding, particularly about the interactions between state\nand private pensions is potentially problematic, as people\u2019s beliefs about what the\nstate will provide affect their decisions about what they should add privately. For\ninstance, some people might be unaware of the later potential effects of means-\ntesting, carry on contributing towards a small pension, but then later resent the\nfact that this ended up making them little better off in retirement. Alternatively,\nothers might believe that they were likely to be caught by the spread of means-\ntesting and so reduce their pensions saving, even though a small private pension\nwould actually carry them clear of the means-test, leaving the return on saving\nunaffected at the margin.\nSecond, while current understanding is very foggy, people do know that\nthere is a flat-rate basic state pension and have a rough idea of its level (Hedges,\n1998). The emerging system is in fact designed to mimic something not unlike a\nflat rate pension of more than 25 per cent of average earnings, but the part that\npeople understand is planned to fall to a third or less of this total. Most people\nunder 40 interviewed in 1998 no longer counted on getting a state pension at all.\nThis is not popular. As Hedges summarised his 1998 research:\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 363\nHardly anyone wants the state to withdraw. They not only feel that obligations to those who\nhave already \u2018paid in\u2019 should be honoured, but beyond that the great majority of participants\nwould prefer the state to stay in the pensions business long-term (1998: 2).\nCurrent plans do not, in fact, mean that the state is getting out of pensions,\nbut that is not what people believe. This does not seem good salesmanship.\nThird, as others have discussed in some detail (Rake et al., 1999; Agulnik,\n1999; Falkingham and Rake, 1999), the effect shown in Figures 6 and 7 for 2018 and\n2038 that the state second pension will almost (but not quite) get people clear of\nthe guarantee level only applies at retirement. After that, during retirement, state\npensions are linked to prices only, while the means-tested minimum is planned to\nrise with earnings. Ten to fifteen years into retirement many with small pensions\nwould be pulled into sharper means-testing. Here the new Pension Credit will\nhelp \u2013 but only by spreading shallower means-testing over a wider range. The\nsame problem will apply even at the point of retirement after the 50 years phase-in\nof the new system in 2051, as the base of the whole system \u2013 the basic pension \u2013\nslips further in relative value.\nIt is too early to tell what the effect of the recent batch of reforms on public\nbeliefs, understanding and behaviour will be, but it looks unlikely that we have\nreached the end of the journey.\nOn the other hand, a simple \u2018Back to Beveridge\u2019 restoration of a more valuable\nand earnings-linked basic pension does not look likely either, despite its many\nadvocates. Compared with current plans, that would obviously mean significantly\nhigher future spending.12 That might be seen as the inevitable consequence of\na growing elderly population, but much of the benefits of that spending would\naccrue to those with higher, not lower, lifetime earnings who would be eating their\ncake through lower contracted out NICs now, but still having it through higher\npensions later on.13 Those below two-thirds of average earnings \u2013 including many\nwomen \u2013 would gain little.\nThe cost of restoring earnings indexation of the basic pension could be kept\ndown by allowing the relative value of the means-tested minimum to fall.14 There\nwould be some low-income gainers from such a change, those who claim the\nbasic pension, but not means-tested supplements to it.15 However, the majority\nof low-income pensioners would lose out by comparison with current plans, as\nthe relative value of the means-tested minimum fell towards the current (lower)\nlevel of the basic pension. At the same time, higher-income pensioners would\ntend to gain by comparison with current plans, as they would benefit from the\nhigher basic pension, without having means-tested benefits to lose.\nAn alternative way forward for state pensions?\nThe fundamental aims of any reform of state pensions remain simple to\nstate: keeping costs to acceptable levels (or making inevitable costs acceptable);\n364 john hills\n0\n25\n50\n75\n0 25 50 75 100 125\nBasic pension\nAP (SERPS)\nS2P extra\nGuarantee credit\nPrivate pension\nPension income as % average adult earnings\nLifetime earnings as % adult average\nFigure 9. Integrating State Second Pension and Pension Credit (2018)?\nensuring that those entitled to support receive it; minimising disincentives to\nself-provision; avoiding adverse distributional effects (the direction of which will\ndepend, of course, on ideological taste); and promoting the public acceptability\nand durability of the system. The difficulty is that such apparently reasonable aims\nconflict. Current plans keep costs down, but at the cost of significant complexity,\nand of a wider spread of means-testing, with potential problems for incentives and\ntake-up. Simply increasing the value of the basic pension would have significant\ncosts, and would do little for many poor pensioners. Keeping costs down and\nreducing disincentives by making means-testing less generous would make many\nlower-income pensioners worse off than under current plans.\nThere are many possible reform options, and no space here to review\nthem. The discussion above does, however, suggest one modification of current\nproposals that might navigate through some of the conflicting objectives. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, it would involve being more honest and explicit about what recent\nreforms are trying to achieve \u2013 getting a minimum contributory state pension\nwhich people can build on as close as possible to the current means-tested\nminimum, while not giving extra to those with higher lifetime earnings. In effect\nrecent reforms are an attempt to restore something closer to Beveridge\u2019s flat-\nrate payments to pensioners by other means, and to unwind Britain\u2019s belated\nexcursion into earnings-related state pensions. If we were explicit about it, the\nnext stage of reform could be an alignment or integration of the State Second\nPension and the minimum guaranteed by the Pension Credit.\nFigure 9 illustrates what such a system might look like for those retiring in\n2018. This shows what would result if the State Second Pension top-up was set not\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 365\nas a complicated function of accrued earnings, but simply to bring the total of the\nbasic pension and any rights through SERPS up to a minimum level at the point\nof retirement.16 The minimum is shown here at 25 per cent of average earnings\nfor an individual by way of illustration.17 As time went by, the basic pension\nwould become less important and the top-up more important. Eventually the\ntotal would become completely flat rate \u2013 except that the \u2018Additional Pension\u2019\npart could continue to perform the functions of both pre-funding future costs\n(through contracting out) and ensuring that those who can afford to provide for\npart of the costs of this minimum do so through their own contributions. Once\ncalculated at retirement, the total (either from the state or promised in return for\ncontracting out) could be adjusted each year to keep up with growth in general\nincomes.\nAn outcome of this kind would have several advantages:\n\u0001 A clear message could be given that the total \u2018state pension\u2019 would be at least\nthe set percentage of earnings (except to the extent that people had chosen to\nfund part of this themselves in return for lower contributions).18\n\u0001 Eventually the \u2018state pension\u2019 would again become a flat rate amount. Indeed\nrules on future accrual of the State Second Pension could be adapted to\naccelerate this process.\n\u0001 This amount could be maintained both over time and after retirement, so that\nthe part of pensioners\u2019 living standards based on it would not slip back in\nrelative terms.\n\u0001 Over time, the effect of the price-linked shadow Lower Earnings Limit would\nmean more and more of those with relatively low earnings being credited\nin, as well as carers for children or disabled people, or those unable to work\nbecause of disability. In effect, it would turn into a \u2018participation pension\u2019 rather\nthan a contributory pension.19 If the recommendations of the recent House\nof Commons Social Security Committee report (2000) on the contributory\nprinciple were followed, and the lower limit for entitlement frozen in cash\nterms, this process would be accelerated.\n\u0001 Crucially, with the minimum state pension set at retirement, most people\u2019s\nprivate pension receipts would return to being an add-on to the flat rate state\npension (apart from any part which was being provided privately in return for\ncontracting out rebates on NICs). The spread of means-testing within the state\npension system would be reduced, so that at the margin people would retain\nthe benefits of their additional saving, restoring much clearer incentives for\nadditional private provision.\nNational insurance as a whole\nWhat would such an outcome mean for the future of the National Insurance\nsystem? Perhaps surprisingly, given the discussion at the start of the article, it\n366 john hills\nwould leave it with a future \u2013 albeit in a rather different form from that envisaged\nby Beveridge or familiar to people used to continental social insurance.\nThe system we have today results from a series of battles that the \u2018contributory\nprinciple\u2019 has lost over the last 60 years. Contribution-based entitlements\nexcluded too many, and benefits related in size to contributions have not taken\nroot. Restoring what was intended by Barbara Castle\u2019s reforms in the 1970s seems\npolitically out of the question. But equally, outright abolition of the system also\nseems politically unlikely, particularly given that the overwhelming bulk of it\nrelates to pensions, accrued rights to which last for decades. However, as it stands\nthe system is widely misunderstood and very hard to explain.\nAs far as pensions are concerned, the suggestion above is that one way\nforward would be to be explicit about what recent reforms are trying to achieve\nand to adapt them to allow a clearer message about their effects. At the heart of\nthis would be explicit acceptance that one of Beveridge\u2019s principles \u2013 of flat rate\nbenefits \u2013 has proved of enduring \u2013 even strengthening \u2013 popular appeal.\nThe recent invention of the \u2018shadow\u2019 Lower Earnings Limit giving pension\nrights to low earners without making contributions comes on top of credits for\npeople in education, training, caring and in other recognised circumstances.\nRecent reforms to maternity allowances have equally credited in low earners\n(albeit with different rules). These reforms open up a new way of looking at\n\u2018National Insurance\u2019. It could become a system based on \u2018participation\u2019 records,\nnot \u2018contribution\u2019 records.\nOf course, once looked at this way, the question of \u2018what is participation?\u2019\narises. For instance, if low paid work without contribution counts, as it now\ndoes for the State Second Pension, why not self-employment (perhaps with\nhigher contributions than now)? Should caring for children of any age (as in the\nbasic pension) or only those aged under six (as in the second pension) count as\nparticipation? A series of questions of this kind would have to be answered, but\nin answering them we would be making explicit choices which are already being\nmade, but in obscurity.\nThere is then a choice for the remaining sixth of National Insurance\nbenefits. One option would be to argue that times have changed since social\ninsurance was developed to cope with the \u2018risks\u2019 that \u2018interrupted\u2019 earnings\nthrough unemployment, sickness, and old age. Today, looking on retirement as\na \u2018risk\u2019 seems anomalous: in today\u2019s labour market, retirement is anticipated and\nplanned for. This puts it in a different category from the others, and could be\nargued to make the case for dissociating pensions from the other \u2018insurance\u2019\nbenefits, absorbing the latter into the rest of social security. National Insurance\nContributions could then be seen more clearly as what they mainly are, \u2018state\npension contributions\u2019 (or \u2018state pension and health contributions\u2019). Non-means\ntested Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance could become more clearly run together with other\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 367\nbenefits and measures for the unemployed, and maternity allowances similarly\nabsorbed into the rest of social security.\nThis separation would match other recent reforms to benefits for the working\nage population. But it does not solve all the problems. In particular, where would\nIncapacity Benefit lie: as part of unemployment benefits, and so with working age\nsocial security, or treated as effective early retirement, and so part of the pensions\nsystem? Many of those receiving it may indeed have started retirement, but for\nothers it has been damaging to treat them as never likely to work again. Drawing\nthis boundary is not straightforward.\nAn alternative would be to combine the direction of reform to pensions\ndiscussed above with the recommendations made by the House of Commons\nSocial Security Select Committee (2000) when it examined the contributory\nprinciple. This was to extend the recent maternity allowance reforms \u2013 with\nentitlement depending on a (low) level of previous earnings rather than\ncontribution records \u2013 to the other insurance benefits. In effect, this would\nmaintain the scope of National Insurance, but with it all run on a \u2018participation\u2019\nsystem, abandoning the residual (and increasingly obscure) remnants of links\nto actual contributions. This would, however, cost more, and the present\ngovernment showed little enthusiasm for it in its response to the committee.\nTaking the cost on would require a judgement that a reinvigorated National\nInsurance system of this kind could be successfully marketed politically \u2013 this\nmight be optimistic in the light of recent history.\nConclusion\nThe Beveridge Report celebrates its 65th birthday in 2007. A prior expectation\ngiven the decline of National Insurance in recent years might have been that\nthis could mark a good moment for retirement of the system it led to. But this\nmight not match the spirit of the times. Under age discrimination legislation\ncompulsory retirement ages will, after all, be illegal by 2007. \u2018Flexible retirement\u2019\nis on its way in. Similarly, some of the original principles of National Insurance\nhave undoubtedly already gone, and others are on their way out, but those which\nunderpin an inclusive, flat rate system for large parts of our social security system\nmay still have some working life in them yet, if we could pull them clear of the\ntangles of what we have now.\nNotes\n1 In 2003\u201304 the contribution rate for employers was 12.8 per cent on all earnings above the\nprimary threshold. For employees, the rate was 11 per cent up to the Upper Earnings Limit\nof \u00a3595\/week, beyond which a rate of 1 per cent is now charged on the excess. The self-\nemployed pay a small flat rate amount as well as a low percentage (8 per cent in 2003\u201304)\nof profits between the threshold and the upper limit, and 1 per cent of profits on the excess\nover that.\n368 john hills\n2 Conditions governing Statutory Maternity Pay and Statutory Sick Pay are closely related to\nthe rules of National Insurance, but are paid by employers, rather than through the benefit\nsystem.\n3 That is, people gain from any additional insurance or pension coverage they organise for\nthemselves, in contrast to the position with means-tested benefits, where part or all of the\nbenefit may be lost. Under any kind of social security cover, the fact of that coverage may\nmean, of course, that people decide that they do not need any more, whereas in the absence\nof state protection, they might have organised some for themselves.\n4 For a summary list, see Hills (2003, table 1). For more detailed discussion, see the\ncontributions to Hills et al. (1994), particularly those by Glennerster and Evans, Lowe\nand Veit-Wilson. For overall accounts of the development of social security in the UK since\n1945, see Hill (1990), or relevant chapters of Timmins (1995) or Glennerster (2000).\n5 The existence of a state benefit system may in itself affect the labour market, with bargaining\nbehaviour affected by the existence of, say, benefits during times of unemployment or\nretirement. What is harder to argue in the current UK system is that there would be much\nrecognition of the way such rights are \u2018earned\u2019 through contributions in a different way\nfrom other benefits.\n6 The relevant questions in the survey do not explicitly put the argument that, for instance,\nthose with higher earnings have previously paid more in National Insurance Contributions\n(or tax) and so might be \u2018entitled\u2019 to higher benefits. None the less, they show little sign of\nan appetite for income replacement as an aim of the state system.\n7 It takes account of the 2001 Census and the Pension Credit introduced in October 2003, but\nnot of unfunded public service pensions, the net value of tax reliefs for occupational and\npersonal pensions, or NIC rebates for those contracted out of the State Second Pension.\n8 For simplicity, people are assumed \u2013 through one route or another \u2013 to be entitled to a\nfull basic pension if their earnings are at or above the Lower Earnings Limit at the date of\nretirement . With the Lower Earnings Limit effectively price-linked, this brings those with\nprogressively lower lifetime earnings into entitlement over time. However, for other parts\nof the state pension system, the diagrams take account of the way entitlements depend on\nthe relationship between earnings and the Lower Earnings Limit (and other parameters of\nthe system) at the date of accrual of rights.\n9 Assuming real earnings growth of 2 per cent in line with recent government projections.\n10 The Upper Earnings Limit is assumed to stay above 125 per cent of average earnings. Recent\npolicy on the level of the Upper Earnings Limit has been ambiguous, having been price-\nlinked for many years, and so falling in relation to average earnings, but then increased\nsignificantly in 2000 and 2001. If the limit were linked only to prices, it would fall to 92\nper cent of average earnings by 2018, and further still by 2038. This would limit \u2013 and\nfurther flatten \u2013 accruals of rights to state pensions for those with higher earnings levels,\nbelow those shown in the diagrams. It would also have major \u2013 and perhaps unlikely \u2013\nimplications for the structure of direct taxation unless there were further changes to the\ntreatment of earnings above the limit.\n11 Whether the terms of this deal are a good one for the state or for those contracting out\nis rather complex, and depends on both personal circumstances and future developments.\nWard (2002) quotes estimates that for those in \u2018defined benefit\u2019 occupational schemes, every\n\u00a31 of rebate paid out in the late 1990s only generated 88 pence-worth of later savings in\nSERPS costs.\n12 Of course, as with any system, costs could be cut by raising state pension age (to the extent\nthat savings were not offset by rising spending on other benefits going to those who did\nnot continue working). What should happen to state pension age goes beyond the scope of\nnational insurance, state pensions, and the future 369\nthis article, which is concerned with the structure of support. See Pensions Policy Institute\n(2002, 2003) for an overview of issues around state pension age.\n13 Unless a government were to take the highly contentious step of reneging on already accrued\nrights to the State Second Pension (as opposed to changing rules for future accrual).\n14 As implied, for instance, by recent Conservative Party plans for pensions (Willetts and Yeo,\n2003).\n15 Official estimates are that between 24 and 32 per cent of pensioners entitled to the\nMinimum Income Guarantee failed to claim it in 2000\u201301. Non-claimants tend to have\nlower entitlements than those who do claim, so the amount of available cash left unclaimed\nwas estimated at 14\u201322 per cent (DWP, 2003).\n16 See Curry (2002) for a more detailed proposal for a \u2018State Pension Guarantee\u2019 along similar\nlines.\n17 This is close to what we are heading for on average by 2018 and 2038, for those not contracted\nout, allowing for assumed post-retirement indexation only with prices under current plans.\nHere post-retirement indexation of the total topped-up to is assumed to be earnings-linked.\nWhat level was actually set would depend on what costs were seen as acceptable, and on\nother issues such as whether state pension age remained at its equalised 65, which are beyond\nthe scope of this paper. The logic of the argument here also suggests that the minimum\npension should be set on an individual basis (so that a couple with full \u2018participation\u2019\nrecords would be entitled to a minimum totalling 50 per cent of average earnings between\nthem). As the Pension Credit is means-tested on a joint basis for couples, this would mean\nthat there would be less of an offsetting saving from its absorption into the State Second\nPension for them than for single people, which would also increase net costs for any given\nminimum.\n18 For those who had \u2018contracted out\u2019, what they would get from the state might be lower,\nunder the rules at the time reflecting their lower contributions (usually equivalent to the\n\u2018AP\u2019 part of Figure 9). As discussed above (note 11), while the impact of this on entitlements\ncan be defined relatively clearly, whether or not the trade-off between lower contributions\nand lower entitlement was a \u2018good deal\u2019 for either side is much harder to calculate. For\nsimplicity, there are arguments in favour of abolishing future contracting out, but that\nwould have significant cash flow effects on government (positive initially, but leading to\nhigher spending later on).\n19 This would create, in effect, a limited form for those above pension age of the \u2018participation\nincome\u2019 suggested by Atkinson (1995: ch. 15) for the whole population, or a step towards an\n\u2018Old Age Basic Income\u2019 (Atkinson, 2002). Note that the form of top-up suggested here differs\nfrom \u2013 and is less ambitious than \u2013 his (1995: ch. 16) suggestion of a \u2018Minimum Pension\nGuarantee\u2019, as the minimum state pension suggested here takes account of compulsory\nsecond pension accumulation as well as the basic pension.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding for the research for this paper from the Economic and Social Research Council as part\nof its support for CASE is gratefully acknowledged.
