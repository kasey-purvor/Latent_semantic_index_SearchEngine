Our starting point in reconsidering issues of\nstaging is Scullion\u2019s recent (and in our view compelling) argument against the\nstandard assumption that there is a change of location after the exit of the chorus at\n814.1 Scullion focuses on the implications of this argument for Ajax\u2019s suicide; we have\ntried to work out the consequences of the single location for the play as a whole,\nsuggesting an overall account of the play\u2019s stage\u2013movements. In tracing the unfolding\nsequence of events on stage (\u00a71, \u00a73) it becomes clear that Sophocles has organized\nthis sequence in a way consistently calculated to surprise the audience. We argue that\nhe was seeking the same effect in his adaptation of the traditional story. First, there is\nreason to believe that Sophocles has made a surprising innovation with respect to the\nantecedents of the play\u2019s action that makes Ajax a more radically problematic figure\n(\u00a72). Second, we suggest that Sophocles may have placed Odysseus\u2019 resolution of the\nconfrontation between Teucer and the Atreids (\u00a74) in a new and surprising light by\nintegrating the action of this play with subsequent events more closely than is\ngenerally recognized (\u00a75). We do not have space to explore the interpretative impli-\ncations of these proposals in detail. But the thematic appropriateness of the dramatic\nstrategy we identify should be self\u2013evident in a play in which the leading character\nenunciates the principle that \u2018nothing is beyond expectation\u2019 (\n, 648), a principle echoed by the chorus (714\u201315), who close the play with the\nreflection that we need to see to understand: sight unseen, no one is a prophet of\nfuture events (1418\u201320).\nI. WHAT DOES THE AUDIENCE SEE AT THE START OF AJAX?\nAt the beginning of the play the audience sees, at a minimum, Ajax\u2019s hut,2 the\nentrance to which is the central sk\u00ean\u00ea door. That is all that can be said with certainty\non the assumption that the location changes later in the play. If, however, that\nassumption is wrong, then the visible set must include from the start the wood that is\nreferred to when Ajax\u2019s body is discovered (892).\nScullion\u2019s reconstruction of the staging posits a simple sk\u00ean\u00ea with a single central\ndoor, and places the wood beyond the end of the sk\u00ean\u00ea.3 However, we are persuaded\nby the evidence of comedy that the sk\u00ean\u00ea acquired three doors at some point, at least,\nin the fifth century. It is true that in general the two flanking doors are not used in\n363\n1 S. Scullion, Three Studies in Athenian Dramaturgy (Stuttgart, 1994), 89\u2013128. The standard\naccount is already found in the scholia to 813, 815a.\n2 In the tenth year of the war, we think it reasonable to assume that the encampment has\nacquired semi-permanent structures.\n3 Scullion (n.1), 93: \u2018it seems preferable to suppose that the grove would be immediately beside\nthe skene, represented by theatrical trees and bushes which would provide both cover for the\ncorpse and some open space in which Tekmessa can be seen discovering it . . . the grove offers\nconcealed access to the backstage area.\u2019 For the number of doors see 93, n. 12, and 115f. for\nantecedents of Scullion\u2019s theory that use more than one door; there is a useful note on theatrical\ntrees at 93, n. 13.\ntragedy,4 and it might seem odd to have doors in the sk\u00ean\u00ea that are simply idle. But if\nwe accept that Sophocles introduced sk\u00eanographia (in the form of moveable painted\npanels attached to the front of the sk\u00ean\u00ea, or something similar), these doors would\nnormally have been hidden when not in use.5 In Ajax, the placing of a representation\nof the wood in front of a section of the sk\u00ean\u00ea would make it possible to have one of\nthe flanking doors in use without any observable violation of the tragic norm. There\nis, however, no reason to assume that this norm was observed inflexibly, least of all in\na play which, on any account, is unconventional in its use of theatrical space.6 We are\ntherefore open to the possibility that the other flanking door was also in use, visibly\nrepresenting a second hut, since we take the initial mention of Ajax\u2019s huts ( ,\n3) to be a genuine plural, referring to the encampment of Ajax and his followers.7\nAlthough that does not prove that any of the other huts in the encampment were\nvisible, we shall argue below (\u00a73) that such an arrangement would be dramatically\nconvenient. We recognize that those who reject the use of multiple doors in tragedy on\nother grounds are unlikely to find either of these proposals persuasive, and our\nreconstruction does not critically depend on their acceptance.\nThe play\u2019s opening lines remind us that Ajax and his followers are encamped at one\nend of the Greek lines (4); the wood, placed at one end of the sk\u00ean\u00ea, represents the\nstart of the wild, unoccupied territory beyond the camp. We may assume, therefore,\nthat the eisodos beyond this end of the sk\u00ean\u00ea leads away from the camp, while the\nopposite eisodos leads towards the main part of the camp. It is from this direction that\nOdysseus makes the entry with which the play begins.\nOdysseus may initially enact his search (5) by moving about in the orkh\u00eastra (cf. 19\n), but the trail leads him to the door of Ajax\u2019s hut (13 . . . ).\nThen Athene addresses him. Where is she? Some commentators place her on the roof\nof the sk\u00ean\u00ea,8 but that would make her conversation with Ajax, when he emerges from\nhis hut, awkward. Moreover, placing her at ground level allows a more effective visual\nrepresentation of Athene\u2019s control of the space (e.g. her protection of Odysseus could\nbe enacted by her interposing herself physically between him and Ajax). Odysseus\u2019\nreference to her invisibility (15), which might seem to count against this staging, is\nexplicable if Athene is initially placed within the wood.9 She would remain concealed\nwhen she first addresses Odysseus, and then move forward so that Odysseus can see\nher when they engage in dialogue.10 Sophocles has thus devised a striking opening for\n364 HEATH AND OKELL\n4 There is a possible exception in Choephori, discussed by A. F. Garvie, Aeschylus, Choephori\n(Oxford, 1986), xlvii\u2013lii, with extensive references to earlier literature on the number of doors.\n5 If Garvie is right to conclude that more than one door is used in Choephori (see n. 4), it may\nbe significant that this exception is in a play that (to judge from the change of location in\nEumenides) antedates the introduction of sk\u00eanographia.\n6 Scullion (n. 1), 116 speaks of Sophocles as \u2018conservative in matters of stagecraft\u2019: the\ndescription seems particularly inappropriate in connection with this play.\n7 For this interpretation of the plural see Scullion (n. 1), 123, n. 129.\n8 This position is defended in D. J. Mastronarde, \u2018Actors on high: the skene roof, the crane, and\nthe gods in Attic drama\u2019, ClAnt 9 (1990), 247\u201394.\n9 So A.W. Pickard-Cambridge, The Theatre of Dionysus at Athens (Oxford, 1946), 48\u20139;\nMastronarde (n. 8), 278, 282\u20133 agrees that a concealed door is needed if Athene is at ground\nlevel. The staging of Athene\u2019s entrance is also discussed in D. Fitzpatrick, \u2018Initial entrances in\nthree Sophoclean tragedies\u2019, in L. Hardwick et al. (edd.), Theatre Ancient and Modern (Milton\nKeynes, 2000), 137\u201352.\n10 At what point she does so is uncertain. Since Odysseus uses a generalizing conditional at 15,\nit is not certain that Athene is still invisible to him (cf. M. Heath, The Poetics of Greek Tragedy\n(London, 1987), 165\u20136, although the staging proposed there needs modification in the light of\nthe present discussion).\nthis play. Odysseus\u2019 silently enacted search poses a puzzle for the audience (what is\ngoing on?); the voice of a concealed character adds a surprise to the puzzle\u2014the first\nof many.\nII. WHAT DOES THE AUDIENCE KNOW AT THE START OF AJAX?\nWhat the audience sees and hears at the beginning of the play engages with their\nbackground knowledge to evoke an intelligible scenario.\nWe begin with three points about the implicit geography of the Greek camp. First,\nit should be recalled that a narrow ribbon of occupied territory close to the shoreline\ndoes not constitute a viable encampment: space is needed. Ideally, an army that has\nlanded in hostile territory would fortify the neck of a headland or promontory,\noptimising the ratio of space secured to the length of the defensive perimeter. Failing\nthat, the camp perimeter would at least need to arc out from the coast. Either way,\nwhere the perimeter approaches the coast it will be at an angle to, not parallel with,\nthe shoreline. So the eisodos beyond the wood leads to the shoreline, and the eisodos\ntowards the main body of the camp leads away from the shoreline. Second, troops in a\nsingle contingent would keep together. The orkh\u00eastra may therefore be thought of as\nthe assembly area for Ajax\u2019s followers, and it can be assumed that the immediately\nadjacent offstage region is occupied by Ajax\u2019s followers. So the eisodos towards the\nmain body of the camp does not lead directly into potentially hostile territory. Third,\nit may be worth bearing in mind that, according to familiar lines from the Catalogue\nof Ships, the next contingent beyond the encampment of Ajax\u2019s followers would be\nAthenian (Il. 2.557\u20138). These points will become relevant in due course.\nMore immediately relevant is the fact that Ajax\u2019s position at one end of the Greek\nlines, highlighted early in Athene\u2019s speech (4), reminds the audience of what they\nknow already from the Iliad: Ajax and Achilles were stationed at opposite ends of the\nGreek camp, the best fighters securing the army\u2019s flanks; Odysseus, by contrast, was\nstationed at the centre of the Greek camp (Il. 8.222\u20136, 11.5\u20139). The visible wood is\ntherefore thematically significant: it is a reminder of Ajax\u2019s importance to the Greek\narmy,11 and is therefore arguably relevant to assessing the fairness of the adjudication\nof the arms.\nAthene\u2019s opening speech quickly solves the puzzle of Odysseus\u2019 actions. Within a\nfew lines Odysseus\u2019 identity is revealed or confirmed (1); we learn that he is seeking to\ngain an advantage over some enemy (2); and we are told that the enemy is Ajax (4).\nSince Ajax\u2019s conflict with Odysseus over the arms of Achilles, his defeat in the adjudi-\ncation, his madness, slaughter of the livestock, and subsequent suicide, were all\nwell-established and familiar elements of the mythological tradition,12 these opening\nallusions combine with the audience\u2019s prior knowledge to situate the action. The\naudience\u2019s initial puzzlement places them on the same level as Odysseus, whose initial\nsearch enacts his own uncertainty about what is going on; but the information\nconveyed in the opening lines may leave them confident that they have understood\nwhat remains puzzling to Odysseus. If so, they are wrong.\nIt is hard for us to appreciate this, because it is so easy to read the play with\nexpectations formed by our knowledge of the play itself. But there is one element in\nthe play\u2019s initial situation which the original audience was probably unable to retrieve\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 365\n11 Ajax in the Iliad is second only to Achilles (2.768\u201370, 17.279\u201380); a key defensive fighter\n(e.g. 16.674\u2013746); the \u2018bulwark\u2019 of the Greeks (3.229, 6.5, 7.211).\n12 T. Gantz, Early Greek Myth (Baltimore, 1993), 629\u201335 summarizes the evidence.\nfrom prior knowledge. There is no evidence that Ajax\u2019s plot against the Greek leaders\nwas part of the tradition before Sophocles. Most earlier accounts make the suicide a\ndirect consequence of the adjudication, with no mention of an assault on cattle, let\nalone of a plot to assault the other Greek leaders.13 The assault on the cattle was\nincluded in the Little Iliad, but in Proclus\u2019 summary it seems to be consequent on the\nmadness induced by the adjudication: \u2018Ajax goes insane, savages the Achaeans\u2019\nplundered livestock, and kills himself \u2019 (tr. West). Proclus\u2019 summary is admittedly\nsparse, and our knowledge of the rest of the tradition is incomplete; so the absence of\nany reference to the plot is not conclusive.14 But the evidence is at least consistent with\nAjax\u2019s plot being a Sophoclean innovation, and that would make a vitally important\ndifference to the dynamics of the opening scene. Odysseus at first knows\u2014or, rather,\nconjectures (22\u20133, 28\u201331)\u2014part of the traditional version, that Ajax has killed the\nanimals and herdsmen (25\u20138),15 and he is mystified (33). When he asks Athene to\nexplain the attack on the flocks (42), the audience would expect the traditional\nexplanation, that Ajax had gone mad as a consequence of his defeat in the adjudi-\ncation; her unexpected reply overturns what they thought they knew. So the audience\nshares the process of discovery with Odysseus, and the shock and astonishment which\nOdysseus expresses in the following stichomythia (44\u201350) is likely to be theirs as well.\nIf that is right, Sophocles has sprung on his audience a more extreme and more\nstarkly problematic Ajax than any they had previously known.16\nIII. STAGE MOVEMENTS\n1 Odysseus enters from the direction of the camp. Athene, initially\nconcealed in the wood at the opposite end of the sk\u00ean\u00ea, addresses him;\nshe subsequently emerges from the wood.\nSee \u00a71 for our grounds for favouring this account of the play\u2019s opening.\n91 Ajax enters from his hut. Athene interposes herself between Ajax and\nOdysseus.\n117 Ajax exits into his hut.\n133 Odysseus exits to the camp. Athene exits into the wood.\nOdysseus certainly returns to the camp. Since that is where the chorus will come\nfrom, there must be a brief interval between his exit and the entry of chorus to avoid\ntheir crossing.17 To achieve this delay we have assumed that he is the first to leave and\n366 HEATH AND OKELL\n13 Od. 11.543\u201351; Pind. Nem. 7.24\u201330, 8.23\u20137, Isthm. 4.37\u201340. There is no evidence that the\nattack on the cattle figured in Aeschylus\u2019 Thracian Women.\n14 Apollod. Epit. 5.6 is likely to be influenced by Sophocles.\n15 The inclusion of the herdsmen in the slaughter itself goes beyond what we know of the story\nin the Little Iliad, and this heightening of the madness may be the first step in Sophocles\u2019\nescalation of the story. As sch. 27a notes, the detail means that there are no surviving\neye-witnesses to tell Odysseus what has happened: this ensures his dependence on circumstantial\nevidence and conjecture.\n16 The discussion in Heath (n. 10), 72\u20134 does not sufficiently recognize this, as E. Barker, \u2018The\nfall-out from dissent: hero and audience in Sophocles\u2019 Ajax\u2019, G&R 51 (2004), 1\u201320, points out\n(5\u20138).\n17 G. Ley, \u2018A scenic plot of Sophocles\u2019 Ajax and Philoctetes\u2019, Eranos 86 (1988), 85\u2013115, at 89,\nsends Odysseus and Athene off together in the opposite direction to avoid this pause: but since\nthe chorus come from the place Odysseus was going to, this cannot be right.\nthat Athene watches him go before herself withdrawing. The wood is her natural exit\npoint at the end of the opening scene if we are right in supposing that she emerged\nfrom it at the start.\nBecause Athene withdraws into the wood, the audience may feel that she remains\non hand as an implicit presence throughout the following action. She is there to see,\nand perhaps to oversee, the final downfall of her antagonist. But that is not the limit\nof her interest in what happens, since Ajax, Teucer and Eurysaces were all Athenian\nheroes. We return to this point in \u00a75.\n134 Chorus enters from the camp.\nThe chorus is aware of the rumours about the attack on the livestock (141\u20137,\n182\u20135) which were circulating before Odysseus\u2019 investigation (25\u20138); though they\nreport that Odysseus is now saying things about Ajax (150\u20131), they apparently have\nnot stayed long enough to learn the content of Odysseus\u2019 new intelligence in detail.\nThat is plausible: as Ajax\u2019s loyal followers they do not wait to find out what someone\nthey distrust is saying, but come urgently to establish the truth and offer help. Hence\nthey, too, are a partially informed audience who will be shocked when they learn the\nfull story from Tecmessa.\n134\u2013200 Choral recitative and song.\n201 Tecmessa enters from Ajax\u2019s hut.\nSince the chorus\u2019s first song ends with a summons to Ajax, it is a surprise18 when\ninstead Tecmessa emerges from the sk\u00ean\u00ea and joins the chorus in the orkh\u00eastra.\nAt 329 she invites the chorus to go inside the hut to help: \u2018assist, entering, if you\ncan\u2019. That is one thing a chorus cannot do. This line begins a shift of focus back to the\ndoor. Since the audience knows that the chorus cannot go in, the redirection of\nattention creates an expectation that someone will come out, and it is not hard to\nguess who. The expectation of Ajax\u2019s imminent appearance is heightened by his cries\nfrom within (starting at 336).\n348 Ajax enters from his hut, on the ekkukl\u00eama.\nAlthough the audience has been led to expect Ajax\u2019s entry at this point, its manner\nis unpredictable. Tecmessa responds to Ajax\u2019s calls by moving back to the hut and\nopening the door (344\u20137). This cues Ajax\u2019s presumably spectacular appearance on the\nekkukl\u00eama, surrounded by dead animals (cf. the deictic in 453) and much blood.\n541\u2013545 Tecmessa calls for Eurysaces. The attendants who have him in their care\nbring him out of the second hut; one attendant leads him by the hand to\nAjax, and passes him up to Ajax.\nThe child Eurysaces appears onstage twice in Ajax, and is repeatedly an object of\nconcern even when not physically present. We suggest in \u00a75 that his role has a signi-\nficance that reaches beyond the play itself. In this section, however, we focus on his\nstage-movements.\nAjax orders Tecmessa to fetch the boy at 530; playing for time, she explains that she\nhas removed him from harm\u2019s way (531), and that he is nearby in the care of\nattendants ( , 539). When further delay is impossible she calls out for him\n(541), and orders the attendant who has him by the hand to escort him to them\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 367\n18 A. F. Garvie, Sophocles, Ajax (Warminster, 1998), 138.\n(541\u20132); the attendant brings the boy to Ajax (544); on Ajax\u2019s instruction (545) he is\nlifted onto the gory ekkukl\u00eama.\nWhere has Eurysaces been? And where do he and his attendants enter from? We\ncan rule out the central sk\u00ean\u00ea door, since Tecmessa has sent him away from Ajax\u2019s hut\nas a precaution; and it would be strange to send the child into the wilderness beyond\nthe camp for safety. He must be close by, at least within earshot, since no one is\ndispatched to fetch him; and it was noted above (\u00a72) that the adjacent part of the\nGeek camp is friendly territory, occupied by Ajax\u2019s contingent. The obvious assump-\ntion is therefore that Tecmessa has sent him to a neighbouring part of the Salaminian\nencampment. That might suggest an entrance from the eisodos leading to the camp,\nbut an entrance from an eisodos would need more cover than the two lines between the\nsummons in 541\u20132 and the arrival at 544. Hence we favour the use of the third door to\nrepresent another hut.19\nHow old is Eurysaces? He is too young to understand what is happening (553), but\nthat does not mean that we should think of him as an infant; he is simply too young to\nunderstand the full implications. At his first entrance he is led by the hand (542), not\ncarried; but he is still small enough to be lifted up to Ajax at 545. The posing of the\nsuppliant tableau (1171\u20135, 1181\u20132) and the formation of the final procession\n(1409\u201311) both contain instructions to the child which imply that he is capable of\nindependent action to some degree. He seems, then, to fall between infants who can be\nrepresented by props (such as, most notably, Orestes in Telephus, parodically exposed\nin Thesmophoriazusae) and children old enough to speak for themselves (such as\nMedea\u2019s children).20\n595 Ajax exits into his hut. Eurysaces is escorted back to the second hut, and\nexits with his attendants. Tecmessa remains on stage.\nAjax returns the child to Tecmessa (578), and orders her to close the hut up quickly,\nand not indulge in lamentation outside the hut ( , 579\u201380). Clearly,\nshe shows no sign of obeying these commands, since Ajax immediately repeats them\nwith added urgency (581\u20132). Tecmessa still disobeys, and begins to plead with Ajax\n(585). At 593 he repeats the instruction to shut the door, but no longer to Tecmessa:\nthe imperative is now in the plural.\nAt the end of this exchange the ekkukl\u00eama is withdrawn, bearing Ajax back into\nthe hut. But Tecmessa\u2019s movements are less certain: some favour an exit here, others\nkeep her onstage. It does not seem likely that a definitive conclusion can be reached,\nand interpreters will no doubt continue to disagree in assessing the balance of\nprobability. The reconstruction proposed here is consciously tentative. For Tecmessa\n368 HEATH AND OKELL\n19 Heath (n. 10), 183, n. 32 assumes an eisodos, but overstates the \u2018covering lines\u2019 to accompany\nthe entrance. For the staging proposed here see Mastronarde (n. 8), 278: \u2018a separate tent from\nwhich Eurysaces can be brought on quickly at lines 541\u201344\u2019. R. C. Jebb, Sophocles: Ajax\n(Cambridge, 1896), ad 595, and W. B. Stanford, Sophocles: Ajax (London, 1963), ad 595, also\nmake use of another door, but interpret it as the entrance to the women\u2019s quarters; but these\nwould not have an external exit. J. C. Kamerbeek, The Plays of Sophocles: Commentaries, vol. 1:\nAjax (Leiden, 1953), ad 541f., speaks more vaguely of \u2018another room\u2019.\n20 The Athenians might have assumed that he was at least three, if the story in Philostratus,\nHeroicus 35.9 is authentic. But there is reason to be cautious: see R. Hamilton, Choes and\nAnthesteria (Ann Arbor, 1992), 57, 72\u20133. Stanford (n. 19), ad 545ff., suggests \u2018a child of three to\nfive years\u2019; M. Ewans, Sophokles: Four Dramas of Maturity (London\u2013Vermont, 1999), 186, n. 36\nsuggests that \u2018[p]resuming that Tekmessa\u2019s native town was sacked early in the Trojan War, he is\nbetween six and eight years old.\u2019\nherself there are two possibilities: either she follows Ajax into the hut, or she remains\noutside the hut. But Eurysaces\u2019 movements must also be considered: he may go inside\nwith Tecmessa; or he may stay outside with her; or she may pass him back into the\ncare of the attendants who escorted him on, who will lead him away.\nIf Tecmessa goes inside, she will have to follow Ajax out after 646. Since that entry\nis not signalled or motivated, it may be preferable to leave her onstage.21 If Ajax was\nordering her to go inside at 578\u201381, it does not follow that she does so: she showed\nlittle sign of compliance with his orders in the subsequent exchange. But it is not clear\nwhether that was what Ajax meant. He wants to be shut inside the hut, but it does not\nfollow that he wants his wife to be shut inside with him: why should Ajax think it\ndesirable to have his wife and child inside the hut with him when he kills himself ?\nWhen he forbids lamentation, the qualification \u2018outside the hut\u2019 cannot mean that\nlamentation inside the hut would be acceptable; he does not want her to lament at all,\nand the fact that Ajax specifies public lamentation implies an assumption that she will\nremain outside the hut while he kills himself inside. By the end of the scene there is\neven less reason to suppose that he would want to bring her inside, since it has become\nobvious in the interim that Tecmessa is unable to exercise the restraint he demands.\nThe switch from singular to plural shows that the command to shut up the house at\n593 is directed to attendants, and the scholion ad loc. plausibly interprets it as an\ninstruction to shut Tecmessa out of the hut.\nWhat of Eurysaces? It might be felt that Tecmessa\u2019s emotionally intense appeals to\nAjax in the concluding lines of the scene would be encumbered if she has a small child\nby the hand or in her arms; if so, passing him back to the attendants who have been\ntaking care of him is an easy solution. The attendants have to be taken offstage, in any\ncase, so this arrangement involves no loss of economy. If Tecmessa herself does follow\nAjax into the hut, she would have good reason not to take the child with her. She\nmight still harbour the fears which made her want to keep the child away from Ajax\nearlier. But even if there is no direct danger to the child, the hut will not be a good\nplace for him to be: Tecmessa cannot be in any doubt that Ajax is going inside to kill\nhimself, nor can she imagine any longer that she will be able to dissuade him. If, on the\nother hand, we are right in thinking that she stays outside the hut, then there is no\nsuch pressing need to pass the child back to the attendants. However, if she does not\ndo so he will still be onstage with her in the next act; the fact that his presence on stage\nis not registered by Ajax (even to the extent of the deictic which acknowledges\nTecmessa\u2019s presence at 652) makes this unlikely.22 It follows that he must have been\ntaken offstage by someone else.\nThere is one further consideration relevant to Tecmessa\u2019s movements at this point.\nThe end of the long first act leaves the audience expecting Ajax\u2019s suicide (which the\ntradition mandates in any case). In Aeschylus\u2019 Thracian Women the suicide was\nreported by a messenger (TrGF F83), and Sophocles\u2019 audience might expect a\nmessenger to emerge from the hut to give a similar report at the beginning of the next\nact. If so, there is another advantage in keeping Tecmessa onstage: the person most\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 369\n21 If she went inside though a different door from Ajax (as Jebb and Stanford suppose: n. 19\nabove) her reappearance, synchronized with Ajax\u2019s entry, would be especially unmotivated; Jebb\nand Stanford are both vague about her reappearance.\n22 For Eurysaces\u2019 absence in the next act see Garvie (n. 18), 184. One might, however, argue\nthat Ajax had no reason to acknowledge his presence separately from Tecmessa\u2019s; certainly, any\ndirect address to his son would be hopelessly anticlimactic after the previous farewell.\nKamerbeek (n. 19), ad 646\u201392, has Eurysaces come on with Tecmessa, but gives no reason.\nintimately connected with Ajax, and most directly affected by his death, is present\nonstage, ready to receive the expected report and to provide an emotionally intense\nresponse to it rather than merely having her reprise the messenger role of her first\nappearance.\n596\u2013645 Choral song.\n646 Ajax enters from his hut, carrying a sword.\nIf the audience does expect a messenger to report Ajax\u2019s death, its expectation is\ndefeated: Ajax himself appears, still alive, and carrying his sword (658). Even if the\naudience\u2019s expectations are less specific, Ajax\u2019s re-emergence will surely be un-\nexpected, after what he said in the preceding act.\n686 Tecmessa exits into Ajax\u2019s hut.\nThis exit is in response to Ajax\u2019s orders at 684\u20136. If we are right in suggesting that\nshe remained onstage at 595, then it is understandable that the apparent abandon-\nment of the suicide plan has put Tecmessa in a more compliant frame of mind.\n692 Ajax exits away from the camp.\nFrom the reconstruction offered so far this is the first time in the play that a char-\nacter has exited at a different point from that of their entry: a pattern has been\nbroken, meaning that exits can no longer be predicted, and the action of the play now\nacquires a more expansive spatial range.\nAjax has announced a two\u2013stage plan of action.23 First, he will go to the shore to\ncleanse himself (654\u20136); secondly, he will go to an untrodden place to hide the sword\n(657\u20138). The audience, unlike Tecmessa and the chorus, have understood this as\nmeaning that he will find a concealed location for the suicide, since the deception\nspeech will certainly not have left the audience in any doubt that Ajax still intends to\ntake his own life. So at the start of the next act they might again look for the arrival of\na messenger to report the suicide.24\n693\u2013718 Choral song.\n719 Messenger enters from the camp.\nAgain, the audience is surprised at the start of the new act. A messenger does\narrive, but from the wrong direction\u2014he brings news from the camp, not from the\nwilderness where Ajax has gone to die.\n787 Tecmessa enters from Ajax\u2019s hut (with attendants).\nTecmessa comes out of Ajax\u2019s hut in response to the chorus\u2019s summons (784\u20136).\nWe infer that she is accompanied by at least two attendants, who accompany her when\nshe goes in search of Ajax, and are thus on hand to move Ajax\u2019s body. If the plural (\n) at 804 indicates that the Messenger does not go alone to fetch Teucer, then we\nmust assume either that he arrived in company, or that Tecmessa has more than two\nattendants with her here. The latter seems preferable: there is no obvious reason why\nTeucer would have sent more than one person with his message, but it is entirely\nplausible that the Messenger\u2019s arrival should attract an interested audience.\nTecmessa\u2019s address to her child ( ) at 809 might be taken as prima facie\nevidence that he is present, implying that she has Eurysaces with her when she enters;\n370 HEATH AND OKELL\n23 Scullion (n. 1), 111\u201312 rightly insists that these two stages should not be conflated.\n24 Garvie (n. 18), 195 and many others (references in Scullion [n. 1], 113, n. 97).\nif so, then our suggestion that he is sent back to the second hut at 595 must be wrong.\nBut Eurysaces\u2019 onstage presence at this point would require consequential decisions at\nlater points in the action. At 814 Tecmessa must either leave him in the care of an\nattendant (but no order is given) or take him with her; if she takes him with her,\narrangements must be made to deposit him between her return and\n985. None of this would be impossible to manage, but the complications are un-\nnecessary, since 809 can also be understood as a rhetorical address to an absent\nperson (cf. 944 and 340).25\n814 Messenger exits towards the camp (with attendants?). Chorus exits away\nfrom the camp. Tecmessa exits away from the camp (with attendants).\nTecmessa (804\u20136) sends people in three directions: (1) to fetch Teucer; and (2) west\nand (3) east to look for Ajax. When the two halves of the chorus return, they are the\nwestern and eastern groups (874, 877). So the first group must be, or include, the\nMessenger; Tecmessa may send one or more of the attendants who entered with her to\naccompany him. She is herself accompanied by at least two attendants (see on 787).26\nThe Messenger, two search-parties, and Tecmessa give us four exits: how is this to\nbe managed in a theatre with two eisodoi? The Messenger\u2019s errand entails an exit\ntowards the camp, since that is where Teucer is currently located. By contrast, it\nmakes no sense for the search-parties to go towards the camp to look for Ajax; the\nchorus knows perfectly well in which direction Ajax departed. It follows that the\nwhole chorus should exit away from the camp. That is consistent with its being sent in\nopposite directions: we have already noted (\u00a72) that the shoreline must run at an angle\nto, not parallel with, the line of the camp where it approaches the coast. The implicit\ngeography of the camp therefore suggests that the chorus exits together towards the\ncoast, and divides into two groups when they reach the shoreline. Tecmessa must go in\nthe same direction as the chorus; she, too, knows that there is no point in going\ntowards the centre of the camp to look for Ajax.\nThere is no doubt that the exit of the chorus in the middle of the play is a major\nsurprise. The emphasis on speed ( , 804; , 811; , 814)\nanticipates the rapid urgency of developments in the latter part of the play (see\nbelow), but there must be a pause between the clearing of the stage and Ajax\u2019s entry,\nallowing tension to build. Since we accept Scullion\u2019s argument that there is no change\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 371\n25 Heath (n. 10), 191, n. 54, accepted by Garvie (n. 18), 201; cf. D. J. Mastronarde, Contact and\nDiscontinuity: Some Conventions of Speech and Action on the Greek Tragic Stage, University of\nCalifornia Publications Classical Studies 21 (Berkeley, CA, 1979), 104, n. 28. Jebb ([n. 19], ad\n787f.), Stanford ([n. 19], ad 784\u20135) and Kamerbeek ([n. 19], ad 787: \u2018Enter Tecmessa with\nEurysaces on her arm\u2019) all infer Eurysaces\u2019 presence from 809; Kamerbeek is clear that Tecmessa\nmust leave him behind, but none is explicit about how he is to be managed. Ley (n. 17), 91\nsuggests that he \u2018may be left by Tek. in front of the tent . . . He would exit into the tent\u2019; but he is\npresumably not abandoned to make his own way offstage. If 809 did require Eurysaces\u2019 presence,\nwe would favour keeping him onstage at 595, and having Tecmessa give him into the care of an\nattendant before her exit at 814.\n26 Garvie (n. 18), ad 804\u20135 divides the chorus itself into three groups, one going with the\nmessenger to fetch Teucer; two of the three groups exit in the same direction. But at 814 and 866\nGarvie\u2019s stage-directions refer to two half-choruses. Ley (n. 17), 91 likewise has \u2018some of the\nchorus\u2019 sent to find Teucer; he divides the remainder of the chorus to search for Ajax, and yet\nbrings half-choruses back from the search. Ewans (n. 20), 191 has all the chorus follow Tecmessa\noff, envisaging them dividing after their exit in order to re-enter along both eisodoi (see also 195);\nhe leaves the Messenger alone, as otherwise some chorus members could not return to the\norkh\u00eastra until Teucer\u2019s entrance.\nof location at this point, we do not envisage this pause being filled with any\ndistracting reorganization of the stage.\n815 Ajax enters from the wood.\nWhat might the audience have expected to follow the pause? One obvious contin-\nuation would be: a messenger arrives to report that Tecmessa and the chorus have\nfound the body; after his report Tecmessa and the chorus return in a solemn\nprocession, bringing the body back into the acting area.27 What actually happens is\ndoubly surprising: Ajax reappears alive, and makes his entrance from an unexpected\ndirection.\nThe focus of the stage-action thus shifts away from the centre of the sk\u00ean\u00ea,\nrepresenting Ajax\u2019s hut at the limit of the Greek camp, towards the end of the sk\u00ean\u00ea\nwith the wood, representing unoccupied territory beyond the camp. Hence Ajax\u2019s\nreappearance does not mean that he has come back to his hut (which would be\ninexplicable); he is still in the wilderness beyond the camp. That makes perfect sense in\nterms of the two-stage plan of action he has announced: the wood is untrodden\nground (outside the camp, and away from the path that is the eisodos), such as he\nenvisaged for the second part of the plan. On the assumption that he has cleansed and\npurified himself in accordance with the first part of the plan, the audience will be able\nto see that he is no longer covered in blood.28 Since he is no longer carrying his sword,\nit might initially appear that he has carried out the second part of the plan announced\nin the deception speech in the way that Tecmessa and the chorus understood it, not in\nthe way that the audience will have expected, intensifying their surprise. His opening\nwords dispel this false impression.\nIn the suicide speech Ajax recognizes the risk that his body will be found and cast\nout unburied by his enemies; he prays that Teucer will be first to find his body\n(826\u201331). The choice of the wood as the place for his death therefore makes sense: it\nconceals the suicide (\u2018where no one will see\u2019, 659), but does so close to his followers\u2019\nencampment, where he is most likely to be found by friends.29\nThe prospect of a problem over the burial is raised here for the first time (burial\nwas implicitly treated as unproblematic at 577), preparing the way for the conflict that\ndominates the latter part of the play. That Ajax\u2019s burial should become an issue will\nnot, in itself, come as a surprise to an audience familiar with the epic tradition, but\nSophocles again presents a more radical version of the epic motif. In the Little Iliad\nAjax was buried, but Agamemnon withheld the honour of cremation; the prospect of\nthe body being exposed is, so far as we know, a new element in the story. So at the very\nmoment that Sophocles draws the audience\u2019s attention to what will be at issue in the\n372 HEATH AND OKELL\n27 Cf. Scullion (n. 1), 114 (without the Messenger). S. Mills, \u2018The death of Ajax\u2019, CJ 76\n(1980\u20131), 129\u201335, at 130: \u2018The poet has thus made a point of rejecting the tableau from within [at\n646] and the cort\u00e8ge brought on [at 815]: what tertium quid can he possibly have in store?\u2019\n28 Scullion (n. 1), 120 suggests that he has not performed the purification, and is still blood-\nstained. We can see no good reason for this. On a practical level, are we to suppose that the blood\nwhich distresses Tecmessa at 919 is simply adding to the gore with which he is already stained? At\na deeper level, while Scullion dismisses out of hand the performance of a ritual to placate Athene\n(120, n. 120: \u2018it is perhaps not totally impossible that he washes himself while offstage, though not\nof course as a ritual act for Athena\u2019), we think it essential. Knowing that the fate of his body is at\nrisk (826\u201331: see below), Ajax would be foolish in the extreme if he did not attempt to assuage\nAthene\u2019s anger (655\u20136: Ajax, of course, knows nothing of the limits to her anger reported at\n755\u20136, 776\u201380); and Ajax is no fool (119).\n29 Scullion (n. 1), 122\u20133.\nlatter part of the play, he innovates in a way that creates an element of uncertainty\nabout what will happen next.30\n865 Ajax exits into the wood.\nAjax retires into the wood to throw himself onto the sword fixed there; so the\nactual death is out of sight. Once concealed by the wood the actor (who is needed to\ntake another role later) can leave the stage unseen by a side door; the corpse will be a\ndummy.31\n866, 872 The two halves of the chorus enter from the wilderness.\nThere is, presumably, a short pause before the chorus arrives. Half the chorus\nenters at 866; at 870\u20131 they hear a noise, immediately explained (872) as the arrival of\nthe other half of the chorus. The two halves of the chorus leave together, and then\nsplit along the shoreline. Logically, two parties sent to search in opposite directions\nwill not meet again until, after a fruitless effort, they return to their starting point.32\nSo they now return to the orkh\u00eastra by the eisodos by which they left. The slightly\nstaggered arrival of the two halves of the chorus makes it possible for them both to\nenter along the same eisodos without interacting before their arrival in the orkh\u00eastra.\n894 Tecmessa enters from wood.\nTecmessa is heard from within the wood at 891\u20133, and is seen at 894\u20135.33 She gives\nthe chorus information about the corpse, which she refers to with deictics (898, 904,\n908); but the questions which the chorus asks (912\u201314) show that, though they can see\nher, they cannot see the corpse. So Tecmessa must be on the edge of the wood,\ngesturing back into it.\n915 Tecmessa removes her cloak and enters the wood.\n925\u2013936 Tecmessa, assisted by her attendants, carries Ajax\u2019s body into the\norkh\u00eastra.\nAt 915\u201316 Tecmessa says she will cover the corpse with her cloak. The corpse will\nbe uncovered at 1003; the temporary covering may be designed to make the carrying\neasier, but it is not certain how and when the corpse is brought into view. It seems\nplausible that Tecmessa carries out her intention straight away. If so, she removes her\ncloak at 915 and enters the wood; the exclamations in 920 may be prompted by her\nhaving to go close to, and look closely at, the corpse while covering it; she comes back\nout of the wood straight away. At 920 has been taken by some\nas a cue for the moving of the corpse into sight,34 but it is more plausible to read these\nwords as an emotional rhetorical question than as an oblique command. Yet the\ncorpse must be brought into the open at some point. The window of opportunity, at\nits widest, would be from the point at which Tecmessa covers the corpse (920) to the\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 373\n30 On the burial of Ajax see J. R. March, \u2018Sophocles\u2019 Ajax: the death and burial of a hero\u2019,\nBICS 38 (1991\u20133), 1\u201336, esp. 27\u20139; P. Holt, \u2018Ajax\u2019s burial in early Greek epic\u2019, AJPh 113 (1992),\n319\u201331.\n31 The discussion of the staging of the suicide in Heath (n. 10), 192\u20134 (criticised by Scullion\n[n. 1], 101\u20133) is to be discarded in its entirety.\n32 Scullion (n. 1), 117\u201318.\n33 The sequence is therefore parallel to the opening of the play: a female character is heard\nfrom within the wood before she is seen. The effect is enhanced if the same actor plays both\nAthene and Tecmessa.\n34 Cf. Scullion (n. 1), 124\u20135.\nend of her last speech (973). Perhaps the most likely possibility is during the chorus\u2019s\nantistrophe (925\u201336); the partially sung dialogue (937\u201360) would then be a lament\nover the corpse.\nTecmessa, we have suggested, took at least two attendants with her when she went\nin search of Ajax (see on 787, 814). They may remain in the wood during her brief\nconversation with the chorus, and will then be in place to carry the corpse out of the\nwood. Where precisely do they carry it to? Scullion argues that it should be taken near\nthe hut.35 However, since 985 implies that the huts are not immediately to hand, the\ncorpse cannot be right up against the sk\u00ean\u00ea; and there is a positive advantage in\nhaving the corpse in a more forward, central position where it can serve as a focus for\nthe following scenes and be fought over. If we think of the orkh\u00eastra as the contin-\ngent\u2019s assembly area (\u00a72), it would make sense for the corpse to be brought there:\nAjax\u2019s body is displayed to his men, represented by the chorus, for them to pay their\nrespects.\n974 Teucer enters from the camp.\nTeucer cries out at 974; the chorus at first only hear him (975\u20136); he does not\ninitially see the corpse (977\u20138 is still dependent on rumour, and asks a question); the\nchorus speak to him at 979. He need not be crying out in response to any particular\nsight or sound: the distressing news he has been told would be enough. Having him\ncry out when still out of sight means that the new character can be identified for the\naudience before he arrives; hence no time is wasted on announcement and greeting.\nThis reflects the rapidity and urgency of developments in this part of the play. It is in\nkeeping with this that his first thought is to take steps to secure the safety of the child,\nand that he emphasizes the need for urgent action ( , 985).36\n989 Tecmessa goes to the huts.\nIt is only after the urgent practical precautions have been taken in hand that Teucer\npauses to react explicitly to the sight of the corpse (992). At 1003 he gives an order for\nthe uncovering of the body.\n1040 Menelaus enters from the camp.\nThe chorus see Menelaus at 1040; Teucer cannot see him at 1044, but does so at\n1046; Menelaus speaks at 1047. This is a more measured entry than Teucer\u2019s, there-\nfore, but the arrival of a new character at this point is unexpected. It interrupts\nTeucer\u2019s mourning, and creates a crisis, as the chorus point out (1040\u20135). The rapid\nunfolding of events in this part of the play (cf. on 814, 974) is expressed in a series of\nmovements that cut across the normal development or completion of a sequence of\naction already in progress, constantly surprising the characters and the audience.\n1162 Menelaus exits to the camp.\n374 HEATH AND OKELL\n35 Scullion (n. 1), 125.\n36 See Heath (n. 10), 198 on Teucer\u2019s efficiency here. Note the parallel: Ajax thinks first of his\nson (339: as sch. 342b notes, when he calls for Teucer he is probably already thinking of him as\nthe person to whom the child will be entrusted), and the child is brought to him from where he is\nbeing kept safe in the camp; Teucer thinks first of Eurysaces (983f.: he does not need to be told\nthat he has been entrusted with the child\u2019s care), who is brought to him from where he is being\nkept safe in the camp. Here, too (cf. n. 33), the effect is enhanced if the same actor plays both\nAjax and Teucer.\nAfter Menelaus\u2019 exit the chorus (in recitative metre) predict a great conflict, and\nurge Teucer to hurry ( ) to make arrangements for Ajax\u2019s burial. But his exit is\npre-empted by the arrival of Tecmessa and Eurysaces.\n1168 Tecmessa returns from the huts with Eurysaces.\nA tableau is posed round the corpse. Then Teucer is able to start on his interrupted\nmission.\n1184 Teucer exits to the camp.\nThe direction of the exit is secured by the fact that he returns at 1223 having seen\nthe approach of Agamemnon, who must be coming from the camp. The significance\nof the direction of this exit is discussed below (on 1316).\n1185\u20131222 Choral song.\n1223 Teucer enters from the camp.\nHere, too, Teucer is in a hurry ( ). Once again, an ongoing action has been\ninterrupted.\n1225 Agamemnon enters from the camp.\nThis entry, in immediate succession to Teucer\u2019s, continues the sense of rapid and\nurgent movement.\n1316 Odysseus enters from the camp.\nThe situation that the antagonists have reached is one in which external mediation\nis needed, and might have been expected (\u00a74). But in view of the oppositional\nperspective towards Odysseus that has been dominant since the parodos an audience is\nunlikely to have seen him as a potential mediator; so his appearance at this point and\nin this role is unexpected. What alternatives might the audience have envisaged? We\nhave noted that the Athenian contingent should occupy the neighbouring encamp-\nment (\u00a72). Teucer\u2019s exit in this direction in his search for a burial place for Ajax might\ntherefore predispose the audience to expect Athenian involvement in the continuing\naction: tragic Athenians have a habit of intervention, and the play has highlighted\nconnections between Ajax and Athens (201f., 861, 1217\u201322) that would have been\nfamiliar to an Athenian audience (\u00a75). Another possibility is that, as in Philoctetes,\nthe impasse reached by the human characters will need divine intervention to resolve.\nAs Athens\u2019 patron deity, Athene has an interest in Ajax that goes beyond the anger\nthat has driven the hero to his death. We have suggested that she has remained an\nimplicit presence since her withdrawal into the wood (see on 133), and as the play\nnears its end the possibility of that presence becoming overt might suggest itself.\nThe surprising nature of Odysseus\u2019 intervention is enhanced by the dramatic\ntechnique. This is another in the series of interruptive entries, its abruptness reflected\nin the way the chorus\u2019 address to Odysseus cuts off the formal structure of the agon.37\n1373 Agamemnon exits to the camp.\n1402 Odysseus exits to the camp.\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 375\n37 P. Holt, \u2018The debate scenes in the Ajax\u2019, AJPh 102 (1981), 275\u201388, at 285\u20136: \u2018His arrival\nkeeps the expected stichomythia from beginning.\u2019 Ewans (n. 20), 200, n. 79 suggests that \u2018Odys-\nseus\u2019 surprising entry would have had even greater power if (like Pylades\u2019 intervention in\nAischylos\u2019 Libation Bearers Scene 6) it shocked the original audience by being technically \u201cimpos-\nsible\u201d because all three of the normal speaking actors are already in view, playing Aias, Teukros\nand Agamemnon.\u2019\nOdysseus\u2019 unexpected intervention as mediator appears to have resolved the\ndeadlock of the confrontation. This appearance, too, may be misleading (\u00a75).\n1420 Chorus, Teucer, Tecmessa and Eurysaces exit with the corpse to the\ncamp.\nTeucer (1403\u20138) details three parties, ordered respectively to dig the grave, to heat\nwater to bathe the body, and to fetch Ajax\u2019s armour\u2014other than his shield: Teucer\nagain (cf. n. 36) follows his brother\u2019s wishes (577) without needing to be told. The first\nparty must go by the eisodos towards the camp, as Teucer did at 1184. The third party\nmust, and the second may, go into Ajax\u2019s hut. Since it is unlikely that the chorus\u2019 final\nexit is split in this way, the execution of these orders must also involve attendants. It is\npossible that the recipients of Teucer\u2019s instructions exit immediately, perhaps to\nre-emerge in time to join the final procession. We think it more likely that 1414\u201315\nprovides the cue for the parties to execute their orders. The attendants who enter the\nhut are to be imagined subsequently catching up with the procession which conveys\nthe body to the burial place.38 It may seem surprising that the washing of the body is\nto be done at the graveside, not in the hut. But Teucer\u2019s insistence on the need for\nhaste (1402\u20134, 1414) sustains the sense of urgency that has pervaded the last part of\nthe play. He is apparently not confident that Odysseus\u2019 intervention has completely\nremoved the threat from Ajax\u2019s enemies.\nIV. ODYSSEUS\u2019 INTERVENTION\nAt 1316 Odysseus enters from the direction of the camp, and receives a warm\nreception from the chorus, which has until now always seen Odysseus as a hostile\nfigure. This response to Odysseus\u2019 arrival has struck many interpreters as out of char-\nacter and unmotivated.39 It may help to understand this moment better if we think of\nit in the larger economy of the confrontation between Teucer and the Atreids.\nWe may start from the question of what Teucer was trying to achieve. He clearly\n(and entirely plausibly) does not believe that he will achieve anything through\npersuasion. It is self-evident that he could not win against the whole army if it came to\na fight.40 His only option, therefore, is to induce the opposition to back down by\nthreats. Ethologists have observed that animal threat displays are typically a mechan-\nism to avert dangerous forms of interaction.41 An aggressor\u2019s threat display may\n376 HEATH AND OKELL\n38 Discussion: Scullion (n. 1), 125, n. 135; Garvie (n. 18), 249\u201350. The fact that 1402\u201317\npresent serious problems of language and metre complicates the question: for a summary see\nH. Lloyd-Jones and N. G.

It makes sense only for the audience, with their knowledge of the\nopening scene.\u2019\n40 That is not to his discredit: Ajax could not have done so either (408\u20139). Most critics\nunderrate Teucer. For a more positive assessment see Heath (n. 1), 198\u2013202; J. Hesk, Sophocles,\nAjax (London, 2003), 105 concurs (\u2018not just a mediocre substitute for Ajax\u2019).\n41 E.g. D. MacFarland (ed.), Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour (Oxford, 1981), 134:\n\u2018Displays often function as deterrents . . . Threat is a form of social interaction, which tends to\ncause withdrawal without injury on the part of an adversary\u2019; 563\u20134: \u2018Threat behaviour is a form\ninduce the target to back off without fighting; conversely, the aggressor may back off\nif the target responds with a threat display that evidences a capacity and deter-\nmination to inflict damage such that the potential cost of fighting outweighs any\npossible benefit of victory. Teucer\u2019s threat display works in the same way. By the end\nof his speech, Agamemnon knows that Teucer would rather die than betray his\nbrother (1310\u201311); so Teucer has nothing to lose, which makes him particularly\ndangerous (1314\u201315), since an opponent in such a position cannot be relied on to be\nguided by a normal assessment of potential costs and benefits.42 Although Teucer\ncannot win a fight, he can make his opponents\u2019 victory unacceptably costly.\nAgamemnon therefore has good reason to back down. He also has good reason not\nto do so: in competitive social groups which place a high value on honour\/shame there\nis a cost involved in being seen to back down once a public confrontation exists. To\ncounteract this destabilizing factor, such societies need to develop counterbalancing\nmechanisms for stabilization. Disapproval of disruptive behaviour is one such\nmechanism: the participants in a confrontation must also take account of the social\ncost involved in being seen to persist in or escalate the conflict. A positive value\nattaches to self-control, as well as to self-assertion. This is likely to be a precarious\nbalance, however, and the social pressure to avoid conflict will often need to be\nsupplemented by third-party mediation. Such mediation will inter alia provide an\nhonour-preserving way of backing down, since those involved in the confrontation\nwill not be giving way to each other, but showing respect to the mediator (who may be\na senior figure).\nHomer portrays a society in which the factors which promote conflict are clearly\nvisible, but which also has a variety of resources to offset these factors. The salience of\nthe confrontation between Agamemnon and Achilles in Iliad 1 makes it easy to forget\nthat it is untypical. If uncontrolled escalation is inevitable in this case, that is due to\nthe depth of the underlying tensions unique to this relationship, not to general\nstructural features of Homeric society.43 The rapidity of the escalation means that\nNestor\u2019s attempt at mediation comes too late; but in book 9 he intervenes quickly and\neffectively to avert any possibility of a confrontation developing out of Diomedes\u2019\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 377\nof communication that usually occurs in situations involving mild aggression or conflict between\naggression and fear . . . The main function of threat is to keep rivals at a distance without undue\nexpenditure of energy or risk of injury.\u2019 See more extensively J. W. Bradbury and S. L.\nVehrencamp, Principles of Animal Communication (Sunderland, MA, 1998), 598\u2013602 (threat\nsignals), 649\u201376 (signal honesty), 677\u2013710 (conflict resolution).\n42 Anger can be a stabilizing factor for similar reasons. Since anger produces unpredictable and\ndisproportionate reactions, the risk of provoking anger may act as a restraint on those kinds of\nbehaviour likely to lead to conflict. Cf. R. H. Frank, Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role\nof the Emotions (New York, 1988). More generally on threat and commitment see (e.g.) T. C.\nSchelling, The Strategy of Conflict (London, 1960); R. M. Nesse (ed.), Evolution and the Capacity\nfor Commitment (New York, 2001).\n43 Even in this extreme case, one can detect abortive efforts at self-mediation. Achilles proposes\ndeferred compensation (1.127\u20139); Agamemnon\u2019s response, though ostensibly aggressive, also\noffers postponement (1.140), presumably as a way of defusing the immediate crisis (adjournment\nwould allow others to broker an honour-preserving solution). But the deeper roots of the conflict\nmean that neither party is willing to be seen to give way by accepting the opponent\u2019s offer. When\nAchilles does in the end make a concession which guarantees that Agamemnon\u2019s action will not\nlead to violent conflict (1.297\u20139: note how the shift to the second person plural in 299 presents\nthis as a concession to the whole army, not Agamemnon) he disguises it with a simultaneous\nshow of uncompromising self-assertion (1.300\u201303); since Agamemnon is not intending to do\nwhat Achilles commits himself to opposing by force, the gesture carries no risk of further\nescalation.\nattack on Agamemnon (9.52\u201378). Achilles intervenes in one of the quarrels that arise\nfrom the chariot race, reminding Idomeneus and Ajax of the social disapproval their\nbehaviour would evoke (23.493\u20134); Menelaus and Antilochus manage to mediate\ntheir quarrel for themselves (23.566\u2013613). Within Ajax, the intervention of the elders\nin the quarrel that flares up when Teucer returns to camp (731\u20132) shows that third-\nparty mediation is still understood as a standard resource for conflict-management.44\nTeucer\u2019s emphatic assertion that he has the capacity and determination to inflict\nunacceptable damage leaves Agamemnon needing to find a way to back down without\nloss of honour (a fact reflected in the purely token resistance that he puts up to\nOdysseus\u2019 arguments). The significant point, then, is that by 1316 we have reached\nprecisely the point at which third-party mediation is likely to be effective. The chorus,\nwhich has a vested interest in the confrontation not escalating, has been making its\nown ineffectual attempts at mediation (note the even-handedness of 1091\u20132, 1118\u201319,\n1264\u20135), and has every reason to hope that the arrival of a senior member of the army\nfrom the camp in response (presumably) to this noisy confrontation signals the\nmediating intervention that is the norm in this society. Therefore, even though they\nhave every reason to dislike and distrust Odysseus, it is reasonable for them to extend\na tentatively friendly welcome. It is only tentative: the conditional in 1317 shows that\ntheir distrust has not disappeared. But if the chorus is uncertain whether Odysseus\nwill play the conciliatory role predicted by the social system or the aggressive role\npredicted by past alignments, it makes tactical sense for them to adopt an attitude\nconsistent with the positive outcome unless and until he initiates a more negative\ninteraction.\nWe suggested above that, though the intervention of a mediator as a way of\nresolving the dangerous impasse might have been predictable, it is surprising to find\nOdysseus in this role. On the other hand, what the audience saw of him in the opening\nscene (supported perhaps by background knowledge of his conciliatory stance in\nOdyssey 11.543\u201364) will combine with their understanding of the social dynamics to\nmake it readily intelligible that he should take on this role.\nV. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\nAfter Odysseus\u2019 successful mediation, Teucer gratefully acknowledges the role he has\nplayed, admitting that it went against what he would have predicted: \u2018you have\ndeceived me greatly in my expectation\u2019 (1382). Hesk comments: \u2018Aside from the\nobvious joke that the proverbially duplicitous Odysseus has once again deceived by\nbeing honest, these lines offer another example of the play\u2019s concern with dashed\nexpectation and revised understanding.\u201945 But precisely that concern with dashed\nexpectation should make us cautious. It would perhaps be out of keeping with the\nrest of the play if what seems to go so well here is not to be looked at with some\nreserve. What, then, if the proverbially duplicitous Odysseus has been using his\nmediating role as the vehicle for a more sophisticated deception?\nThat possibility may seem inadequately unmotivated if we think of Ajax in\nisolation.46 But should we do so? Although we do not readily associate Sophocles with\n378 HEATH AND OKELL\n44 Compare OT 631\u20136, where the chorus looks to Jocasta to mediate the quarrel between\nOedipus and Creon.\n45 Hesk (n. 40), 128.\n46 Odysseus\u2019s role is generally viewed positively by the play\u2019s interpreters. E.g. Holt (n. 37), 288:\n\u2018Odysseus\u2019 humility, moderation, and reason come as a refreshing relief to the wrangling . . . Thus\ntrilogies, we know that he did compose at least one, a Telepheia.47 We know, too, that\nhe composed three plays which, in terms of their subject matter, could very easily have\nconstituted a trilogy: Ajax, Teucer and Eurysaces.48 The conjecture that these three\nplays formed a trilogy cannot be proved. But it is possible that they did, and worth\nreflecting on the implications if this were so.\nWe know the basic scenario dramatized in Teucer: Teucer returns to Salamis;\nTelamon blames him for Ajax\u2019s death and exiles him (cf. Ajax 1006\u201320); he founds\nSalamis in Cyprus. Less is known about Eurysaces.49 The most common conjecture,\nbased on the fragments of Accius\u2019 Eurysaces and a story in Trogus (Just. Epit.\n44.3.2f.), is that Teucer tries to return home on hearing of his father\u2019s death but is\nbarred by Eurysaces. That hostility would make sense, since Eurysaces will have been\nbrought up by the grandfather (cf. Ajax 567\u201370) who exiled Teucer for betraying Ajax.\nIt would be fruitless to speculate on how the confrontation was worked out. In Trogus,\nTeucer goes to Spain;50 one could imagine this being foretold in a concluding appear-\nSOPHOCLES\u2019 AJAX : EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED 379\nthe double debate-scene provides an effective showcase for Odysseus in two ways. It first displays\nthe need for him, then presents his merits.\u2019 For an argument that Odysseus\u2019 motives may not be as\nfriendly as he suggests see E. R. OKell, \u2018The rite of inheritance: burial competitions in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone and Ajax\u2019, in D. Burton (ed.), Good Deaths, Bad Deaths: Death, Dying and Burial in the\nAncient World (BICS supplement, forthcoming): the Athenian expectation that those who wish\nto make a claim to inherit will participate as fully as possible in the burial invites a reading of\nOdysseus\u2019 eagerness to participate in Ajax\u2019s funeral rites as a consolidation of his position prior\nto making a claim on Ajax\u2019s estate. The fact that Odysseus has already succeeded in securing\nAchilles\u2019 arms, after rescuing his body from the battlefield and in preference to Ajax (his fellow\ncorpse-rescuer and Achilles\u2019 paternal cousin) and Neoptolemus (Achilles\u2019 son), lends support to\nthis interpretation of Odysseus\u2019 motives, clarifying his expectations of such a claim.\n47 See TrGF I Did. B5.8 (Snell\u2013Kannicht), and IV.434 (Radt). Schmid and St\u00e4hlin (1934),\n436\u20137 propose an Andromeda trilogy; H. Lloyd-Jones, Sophocles: Fragments (Cambridge, MA,\n1996), 275, suggests an Argonautic trilogy comprising Colchides, Rhizotomoi and Skythae, and\nnotes (249) that \u2018one cannot rule out the possibility\u2019 that Nauplios Katapleon, Nauplios Purkaeus,\nPalamedes and Odysseus Mainomenos \u2018belonged to a tetralogy with a continuous theme\u2019.\n48 For the two fragmentary plays see (as well as the standard editions of Sophoclean\nfragments) D. F. Sutton, The Lost Sophocles (Lanham, MD, 1984), 132\u20139 (Teucer), 49\u201356\n(Eurysaces); cf. Gantz (n. 12), 694\u20135. The suggestion that these three formed a trilogy is antici-\npated in W. H. R\u00f6scher, Ausf\u00fchrliches Lexikon der griechischen und r\u00f6mischen Mythologie\n(Munich, 1916\u201324), 5.413, and in W. Schmid and O. St\u00e4hlin, Griechische Literaturgeschichte\n(Munich, 1934), 1.2.54, n. 7, 342, 459. If our conjecture is right, it imposes a constraint on dating:\nClouds 583 = Sophocles F 578, from Teucer (sch. ad loc.); since this passage must belong to the\noriginal version (K. J. Dover, Aristophanes: Clouds [Oxford, 1968], lxxxi) Teucer must have been\nperformed before 423. This simply places a terminus ante quem at one extreme of the (very wide)\nrange of dates proposed for Ajax, which stretches from the 460s to the 420s. For the purposes of\nthe present paper we do not need to defend any particular date. Because of the play\u2019s concen-\ntration on the characters of nothoi (Teucer, Eurysaces) and their rights, E. R. OKell, Practising\nPolitics in Sophocles (Diss., University of Exeter, 2003), 226\u20138, and n. 46 favours a date around\n451\/0 and the introduction of Pericles\u2019 Citizenship Law, or dates at which that law affected the\npublic progression of the nothoi it created: 433\/2 (when they reached eighteen, and could\notherwise be registered in demes and begin to attend the assembly) or 421\/0 (when they reached\nthirty and could otherwise begin to fill public offices); Pericles\u2019 request for his two nothoi by\nAspasia to be enfranchised in 430 would be another occasion on which these issues would come\nto the fore. See also C. B. Patterson, \u2018Those Athenian bastards\u2019, ClAnt 9 (1990), 40\u201373, at 62,\nwho identifies an echo of the law\u2019s language at Ajax 1304 and suggests 451\/0, in the lead-up to or\naftermath of that law, or 445\/4, during the associated scrutiny of the deme lists. For illegitimacy\nas a theme in the play see K. Ormand, \u2018Silent by convention? Sophocles\u2019 Tekmessa\u2019, AJPh 117\n(1996), 37\u201364, at 46f.\n49 We have a single one-word fragment of this play: (F 223). It is, no doubt, a\ncoincidence that this fits so neatly with the theme of the unexpected in Ajax.\n50 Cf. Strabo 3.3.3; Philostr. VA 5.5.\nance by Athene, who might (like Heracles in Philoctetes) intervene to cut through an\ninsoluble knot tied by humans.\nIf these plays did constitute a trilogy it would put Teucer\u2019s foreshadowing of his\nfate and Eurysaces\u2019 appearances in Ajax in a new light: both prepare the way for\nsubsequent plays in the trilogy.51 Moreover, the trilogy would have a sustained focus\non Athenian heroes.52 In particular, if Eurysaces foreshadowed the gift of Salamis to\nAthens from Eurysaces\u2019 son Philaeus53 and the establishment of Eurysaces\u2019 hero-cult\nin Melite, where Ajax was probably also worshipped,54 the play would have looked\nforward to the completion of the heroisation of Ajax which, as many interpreters have\nseen, is initiated in Ajax.55\nThere is one more important fact that we know about Teucer: Odysseus was instru-\nmental in Teucer\u2019s exile, turning Telamon against him with accusations of disloyalty\n(F 579a = Arist. Rh. 1416a32\u2013b4). The startlingly different perspective in which that\nsequel would place the reconciliation in the closing scenes of Ajax is no reason to\nreject the proposed trilogy. On the contrary, in this respect Teucer would engage with\ncentral themes of Ajax as closely as Eurysaces (on our best conjecture) engages with\nthe play\u2019s anticipation of Ajax\u2019s hero-cult. Since the instability of friendship has been\nsuch a salient concern in Ajax, it would surely be na\u00efve to assume that the cordial\naccommodation reached at the end of the play will inevitably endure. Odysseus, after\nall, makes no secret of the fact that he works above all for his own advantage (1367);\nhis interaction with Teucer, though cordial, ends with a rebuff (1400\u20131); and we have\nnoted (on 1420) that Teucer still feels under threat at the end of the play. Where might\nwe expect this to lead? The closing words of the play remind us that we cannot predict\nor understand what will happen until we have seen it happen (1418\u201320).\nUniversity of Leeds\nUniversity of Durham\nMALCOLM HEATH\nELEANOR OKELL\nm.f.heath@leeds.ac.uk\ne.r.okell@durham.ac.uk\n380 HEATH AND OKELL\n51 Pearson sees Ajax 1013ff. as alluding to Teucer, and infers that Teucer must antedate Ajax;\nKamerbeek (n. 19), 6, sees an allusion to Aeschylus\u2019 Salaminiai.
