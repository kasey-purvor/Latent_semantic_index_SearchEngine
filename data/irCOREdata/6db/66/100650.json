The films were prepared using a layer-by-layer method sa-CNx :LLd, by the\ncyclical nitrogen radical sputtering of a graphite radical, alternated with a brief hydrogen etch. The\nphotosensitivity S of these films is 105, defined as the ratio of the photoconductivity sp to the dark\nconductivity sd and is the highest value reported thus far. We believe that the carriers generated by\nthe monochromatic light (photon energy 6.2 eV) in the a-CNx :LL films are primarily electrons, with\nthe photoconductivity shown to increase with substrate deposition temperature. \u00a9 2004 American\nInstitute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063\/1.1792384]\nThe family of tetrahedral amorphous carbon films has\nshown promise toward device applications based on lumines-\ncence. In particular, hydrogenated tetrahedral amorphous car-\nbon has shown relatively good photoconducting\nproperties,1\u20133 which can be further improved by the addition\nof impurities such as nitrogen.1,4\u20136 The resulting amorphous\ncarbon nitride films sa-C:Nxd show interesting properties,\nincluding electroluminescence,7 photoluminescence,8 low di-\nelectric constant9 and detection capability for heavy-ion\nparticle.10 The layer-by-layer amorphous carbon nitride films\nsa-CNx :LLd prepared in this study show a two to three or-\nders of magnitude improvement in photoconductivity re-\nported for any form of a-C films. We investigated the density\nr, sp3 fraction and nitrogen concentration [obtained using an\nelectron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)], the optical en-\nergy gap E04, the Urbach energy EU [calculated from photo-\nthermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS)], and defect density\n[from electron spin resonance (ESR)] as a function of sub-\nstrate temperature TS during sputtering, in order to examine\nthe thermal evolution of the growth and structure affecting\nthe photoconductivity of these films.\nThe a-CNx :LL films were prepared by a cyclic process\nof a deposition step of thin a-CNx film by a nitrogen radical\nsputtering, immediately followed by a hydrogen treatment\nstep that helps to reconstruct the bulk material; this process\nis repeated until the required thickness of film is grown. The\nhydrogen treatment on the a-CNx films helps to reduce the\ndefect density and remove weak C dangling bonds without\nthe inclusion of significant atomic hydrogen.4 The a-CNx\nfilms were prepared using sputtering in a 13.56 MHz rf sys-\ntem, at a power of 85 W, a substrate temperature TS that\nvaries from room temperature (RT) to 400\u00b0C, and a N2 sput-\nter gas pressure of 0.12 Torr (gas purity of 99.999%). For the\nhydrogen treatment step, we used a glow discharge of H2 at\n0.50 Torr (gas purity 99.999%) at a rf power of 85 W at TS.\nThe a-CNx films initially grown are reduced with structural\nreconstruction during this phase. Typical film thicknesses per\nlayer for a single-sputter growth and etching cycle are esti-\nmated to be 15 and 5 nm, respectively, for a growth time of\n3 min, followed by H2 etching for 40 s. We ran seven cycles,\nresulting in a film thickness of 70 nm. Deposition and etch-\ning rates for individual layers are estimated to be in the order\nof 3.0 and 7.5 nm\/min, respectively. The heating and cooling\nrates during the film preparation were maintained at 4 and\n1\u00b0C\/min, respectively.\nThe photoconductivity was measured using aluminum\nsAld gap electrodes, comprised of structures with a lateral\ngap of 60 mm, in 6-mm-wide stripes. A light source from a\nXe lamp of 150 W was used to irradiate the gap cell with a\nmonochromatic light. The photon flux, Fscm2 sd\u22121, was cal-\nculated using a voltage lock-in-amplifier configuration (Stan-\nford research system SR830), with a pyroelectric detector\n(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.P2613) at a chopping frequency\nof 3.5 Hz. The photocurrent passing through the a-CNx :LL\nfilm was monitored using a Keithley 6512 picoammeter. The\ndependence of the photoconductivity on photon energy, at a\nfixed photon number and applied voltage of 32 V dc, is\nshown in Fig. 1. The photon number F used for the experi-\nments for the low-energy range of 3.5\u20134.6 eV s5\n31013 cm\u22122 s\u22121d was different from the one used for the\nhigh energy at 4.5\u20136.2 eV s131012 cm\u22122 s\u22121d. The photo-\nconductivity of the a-CNx :LL films increased with substrate\ntemperature TS and photon energy, whereas the dark conduc-\ntivity sd, measured at room temperature was 10\u221214 sV cmd\u22121\nor lower. The photosensitivity, S=sp \/sd, is approximately\n105 at a photon energy of 6.2 eV, with an energy flux of\n5mW\/cm2. As the mobility gap of the a-C films has been\nshown to be larger than that of the optical band gap,2,6 which\nin turn is smaller than the energy used to measure photocon-\na)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.silva@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 85, NUMBER 14 4 OCTOBER 2004\n0003-6951\/2004\/85(14)\/2803\/3\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics2803\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

In the band\nmodel used here, due to the high concentration of nitrogen in\nthe films, a nitrogen lone pair state is believed to form in the\np valence band.11,12 The increase of signal in the photocon-\nductivity at 3.5 eV in Fig. 1 can be attributed to a transition\nfrom a nitrogen lone pair state in the valence band to a s*\nempty antibonding state in the conduction band sENLP-s*d.10\nDue to the high optical penetration depth, it follows that the\noptical absorption is not sufficient in the films examined in\nthis study (film thickness of 70 nm) to show photoconduc-\ntivity below incident photon energies of 3.5 eV.\nFigure 2 shows the dependence of the defect density NS\nand nitrogen concentration for a-CNx :LL films as a function\nof substrate temperature TS. Previous reports have shown\nthat the photoconductivity of the a-C films is related to the\ndefect density NS, varying in the range of 0.5,1\n31018 cm\u22123, and decreasing very slightly with an increasing\nTS. Furthermore, the nitrogen concentration in these films\nprepared layer-by-layer is almost constant as a function of\nthe substrate temperature, showing the direct link between\nthe defect density and the nitrogen concentration.\nFigure 3 shows the dependence of the sp3 fraction and\ndensity r for the a-CNx :LL films as a function of substrate\ntemperature Ts as obtained by EELS. The results suggest that\nthe films have a unique composition, as they show an un-\nusual increase in the sp3-hybridized carbon fraction con-\ncomitant with a decrease in the density r of free carriers.\nBecause of the almost constant nitrogen concentration as a\nfunction of substrate temperature, we suggest that the in-\ncreased substrate temperature affords higher atomic hydro-\ngen mobility in the films, resulting in more sp3 bonding, in\nthe form of C\u2013H (and C\u2013H\u2013N) states. Generally, with\nhigher atomic mobility of C and N atoms, a more sp2-rich\nstructure is formed, with a predominance of the planar\nbonds. The proposed higher density of C\u2013H sp3 states re-\nsults in a lower overall density of the films, as measured.\nFurthermore, C\u2013N sp3 bonds would be more stable than\nCvN sp2 bonds at higher temperatures, consistent with the\nmeasured sp3 fractions.\nThe dependence of the optical energy gap E04 and Ur-\nbach energy EU obtained from the PDS for the a-CNx :LL\nfilms as a function of substrate temperature Ts is shown in\nFig. 4. The E04 was determined from the energy at which the\nabsorption coefficient a equals 104 cm\u22121. The EU describes\nthe curvature of the band edge of the tail state. The E04 and\nFIG. 1.

The increase in EU is\nrelated to the amount of disorder near the band edge. This\nmay be explained by the free N forming clusters of C\u2013N sp2\nstates leading to the lower defect and physical density, and\nalso a decrease in the E04 band gap. We believe this cluster-\ning to predominate the p component of the valence-band\nedge, for in optical absorption, the filled states are excited to\nempty antibonding states. If the C\u2013N sp2 cluster is present,\nwith or without lone pair states at the p band, this would\ngive a broader tail.\nThe data shown in Fig. 1 gives a very interesting insight\ninto the properties of these films. It firstly gives the shape of\nthe convoluted bonding and antibonding states in which the\nbonding side probably dominates. It also gives a very large\ndynamic range of values, indicative of the huge difference in\nmobility values between high-energy extended states and\nhighly localized p states. The y axis of the figure, as it\nstands, is equivalent to the uncorrected \u201cfigure of merit\u201d for\na single-carrier photoconductor, and will be a combination of\nthe carrier absorption, recombination time, and convoluted\nmobility as a function of energy. There is a case for a two-\nGaussian fit to the data shown, with the first peak attributed\nto sp2 states based upon C, C\u2013N, and some lone pair bonds.\nThe higher energy peak at 6 eV has been observed by many\nexperiments, including the EELS low-loss region, and is at-\ntributed to the extended state conduction, or the high-\nmobility region. If we are now to consider the data below\n4.7 eV for which we have accurate absorption data sad,\nbased on optical measurements, it is possible to obtain the\ncorrected mt product. This gives a change in the photon\nnumber in the range of 10\u221211\u201310\u22128 cm2 V\u22121, for the energy\nof 3.5\u20134.7 eV, with the y axis in Fig. 1 transported by eight\norders of magnitude to lower values. These absolute values\nare significant, for if we assume the recombination time to be\nin the order of 10\u22129\u201310\u22128 s,13 the resulting lower bound mo-\nbility is in the order of 10\u22123\u201310\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 for the carri-\ners (electrons) at an energy of 3.5 eV, increasing to around\n1\u201310 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 for the 5 eV states. These values are fur-\nther justified as the mobility, close to the Fermi level, has\nbeen measured to be around 10\u22129\u201310\u22126 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121.14,15\nHigher values of 1\u201310 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 have also been observed\nunder special conditions of nanostructuring in the a-CNx\nfilms16 and under superlattice conditions.17 The small varia-\ntion in the data as a function of substrate temperature is\nexpected with the evolution of the bonding, especially the\nC\u2013N sp2 lone pair states and band gap. The variation is\nsmall, and we believe this could be due to the little variation\nobserved in the unpaired defects measured by ESR.\nIn conclusion, we report high photosensitivity values of\n105 at monochromatic light with photon energy of 6.2 eV,\nwith an energy flux of 5 mW\/cm2. We show the movement\nof the resultant photoconductive spectrum as a function of\nsubstrate growth temperature, and postulate the existence of\na C\u2013N sp2 lone pair state that dominates the recombination\nprocess close to the p bonding states. The layer-by-layer\ngrowth process gives quite unexpected results in terms of the\nmicrostructure of the film with high sp3 bonding and low\nband gap at high temperatures. This is explained by invoking\nthe restructuring process that takes place during the hydro-\ngen plasma treatment step, through the formation of sp3\nbonds with the introduction of hydrogen at higher substrate\ntemperatures. Unlike previous studies, we do not see a sig-\nnificant dependence of the photoconductivity on the unpaired\ndefect spins measured by ESR. The data shows this novel\nsynthesis route of layer-by-layer growth of a-CNx :LL by ni-\ntrogen radical sputtering to be a candidate for photodetector\nmaterials as well as photoconductors.\nThis research was supported partly by the Grant-in-Aid\nto Gifu University from the Ministry of Education, Sports,\nand Culture, Science and Technology, Japan.
