Induction of apoptosis \nby structurally diverse HDACi in primary cells from patients with chronic \nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and different leukemic cell lines was mediated by the \nBcl-2 regulated intrinsic pathway and demonstrated a requirement for de novo protein \nsynthesis. A marked time dependent induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, \nBim, Noxa and Bmf was observed, which preceded the induction of apoptosis. A key \nrole for both Bim and Noxa was proposed in HDACi-mediated apoptosis based on our \nfindings that siRNA for Bim and Noxa but not Bmf largely prevented the HDACi-\ninduced loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase processing and \nphosphatidylserine externalization. Noxa, induced by HDACi, in CLL cells and tumor \ncell lines, bound extensively to Mcl-1, a major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member \npresent in CLL cells. Our data strongly suggests that HDACi induce apoptosis \nprimarily through inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by increases in \nBim and Noxa and highlights these increases as a potential clinical target for \nCLL\/lymphoma therapy. \n \nKey words: Histone deacetylase inhibitors, CLL, apoptosis, Bim, Noxa, Mcl-1 \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are a relatively new class of targeted anti-\ncancer agents that exert anti-tumor activity both in vivo and in vitro by their ability to \ninduce growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis.1-3 The acetylation status of core \nhistones, which is normally regulated by the balance between the opposing activities \nof histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is frequently altered \nin many cancers and is further disrupted by HDACi.1-3 Based on their chemical \nstructure, four types of HDACi have been characterized including short chain fatty \nacids (valproic acid),  hydroxamic acids (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]), \ntrichostatin A and LBH589), synthetic benzamide derivatives  (MS-275) and cyclic \ntetrapeptides (depsipeptide).1-3  \n \nInduction of apoptosis occurs by two main pathways: triggering of cell surface death \nreceptors (the extrinsic pathway) or by perturbation of mitochondria (the intrinsic or \nBcl-2-family-regulated pathway), with caspase-8 and -9 being the apical caspases, \nrespectively.4 Members of the Bcl-2 family are critical regulators of apoptosis and \ncomprise pro-survival anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, \nmultidomain pro-apoptotic members, such as Bax and Bak, and pro-apoptotic BH3-\nonly proteins, including Bad, Bik, Bim, Bmf, Puma and Noxa.4, 5 On receipt of a death \nsignal, Bax and Bak can form oligomers in mitochondrial membranes leading to \nrelease of cytochrome c and caspase activation, whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 \nmembers prevent this release by blocking activation of Bax and Bak. BH3-only \nproteins are critical for cell death initiation, they act upstream of Bax and Bak and \ntheir pro-apoptotic activity is tightly controlled by diverse transcriptional and post-\ntranslational mechanisms.4, 6-8 Activation of different BH3-only proteins by multiple \nstimuli including cytokine withdrawal and many chemotherapeutic agents result in \ntheir binding into the hydrophobic groove of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members. \nAlthough initially such interactions were considered promiscuous, it has been realized \nrecently that certain BH3-only proteins selectively bind to different functional \nsubclasses of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members.9, 10 Thus Bim and Puma bind \ntightly to all pro-survival proteins, Bad binds tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w but \nvery weakly to Bfl-1\/A1 and not to Mcl-1, whereas Noxa only binds to Bfl-1\/A1 and \nMcl-1.7, 9, 10  Thus, pro-survival proteins can be divided into two groups, one \ncomprising Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w and the other containing Mcl-1 and Bfl-1\/A1 and \n 4\nimportantly efficient apoptosis and effective therapy requires neutralisation of both \nsets of pro-survival proteins.7, 9, 10 \n \n The precise mechanism whereby HDACi induce apoptosis is not known, although \nmost studies suggest they act by the intrinsic pathway 3, 11, 12 compatible with reported \nHDACi-mediated increases in Bim and Bmf.13-17 Furthermore such increases in BH3-\nonly proteins may be important in HDACi-induced apoptosis as early studies \ndemonstrated that HDACi-induced apoptosis was inhibited by cycloheximide.18, 19 \nReactive oxygen species (ROS) may be involved in induction of apoptosis by SAHA \nand MS-275 but it is unclear if this applies to other HDACi and whether the increase \nin ROS precedes or is a consequence of apoptosis.11, 20, 21 Depsipeptide has been \nproposed to induced apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in primary cells from patients \nwith chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and MS-275 induced a late generation of \nROS that did not precede the commitment to apoptosis in CLL cells.21, 22  \n \nAlthough several HDACi have entered Phase I and II clinical trials, they will likely be \nof most value in combination with other anti-tumor agents including agents that \ninduce death receptor-induced apoptosis.2, 3  We have shown that CLL cells, which \nare inherently resistant to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),23 are \nsensitized by prior treatment with an HDACi that preferentially inhibits HDAC Class \nI but not Class II 14, 24 and this sensitization occurs almost exclusively through the \ndeath receptor TRAIL-R1 but not TRAIL\u2013R2.25-27  \n \nIn this study we further investigate the mechanism whereby HDACi induce apoptosis \nin various leukemic cell lines and in freshly isolated CLL cells, with particular \nemphasis on the role of BH3-only proteins. HDACi induce apoptosis by de novo \nprotein synthesis of the BH3-only proteins, Noxa, Bim and Bmf and activation of the \nintrinsic pathway. We report an HDACi-mediated increase in Noxa that is critically \nimportant in HDACi-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells.  \n \n \n  \n 5\nMaterials and Methods \n Lymphocyte purification, cell lines and culture. CLL cells, obtained with patient \nconsent and local ethical committee approval, were purified and cultured (4 x 106 \ncells ml-1) as described.14, 23  Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1), Z138, a human mantle cell \nlymphoma cell line,28 and K562, a human myelogenous leukemic cell line, were \ncultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 5% GlutamaxTM.14, \n23  K562 cells were from ATCC.  \n \n Reagents. Media and serum were from Life Technologies, Inc (Paisley, UK). \nAntibodies were sourced as follows: rabbit anti-Puma Ab was from Cell Signalling \nTechnology (Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-Bmf (Ct) and anti-acetylated tubulin mAb \n(clone 6-11B-1) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). A second rabbit anti-Puma Ab (NT) \nwas from ProSci (Poway, CA). The antibody to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase \n(PARP) (clone C2-10) was from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK). The rabbit anti-\nacetylated -H3 and -H4 Abs, rabbit anti-Bak (NT) Ab and rabbit anti-Bax (NT) Ab \nwere from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit anti-p21 (H164) \nmAb, mouse anti-p53 (clone DO-1) mAb and rabbit anti-Mcl-1 Ab (sc-19) were from \nSanta Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit anti-Bid Ab and mouse anti-\nBcl-2 mAb were from BioSource (Camarillo, CA) and DAKO (Cambridge, UK), \nrespectively. The rabbit Bim Ab and mouse anti-Noxa mAb were from Merck \nBiosciences (Nottingham, UK). The rabbit Bcl-xL Ab, mouse anti-Bad mAb and \nmouse anti-Bik mAb were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). LBH589 was \nkindly provided by Dr. P. Atadja (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East \nHanover, NJ). SAHA was kindly provided by Dr. R. Schultz (NCI, MD). MS-275 and \nsodium valproate were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).  \nQuantification of apoptosis and western blot analysis. Apoptosis was quantified \neither by loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) or by phosphatidylserine \n(PS) externalization in the presence of propidium iodide as described.14, 23  Samples \nfor western blot analysis were prepared and acetylated histones, caspases and cleaved \nPARP detected as previously described.14  \n \n \n Measurement of ROS production.   Cells were exposed for 30 min at 370C to the \nnonfluorescent probe 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (20 \u03bcM - DCFDA) \n 6\n(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in phenol red free RPMI medium. After washing the \nmedium, cells were exposed to a series of HDACi for 60 min at 370C and oxidation to \nthe highly fluorescent 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein was measured by flow cytometry \nusing a BD FACSCaliburTM System (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). \n \n Real-time RT-PCR \n Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) and 50 ng \nreversed-transcribed using standard techniques with Superscript III (Invitrogen, \nPaiseley, UK). The resulting cDNA was used for the real time amplification reaction \nwith a SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Primers \nwere designed using the Primer Express software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, \nWarrington, UK) and the sequences used were as follows; \nNoxa forward, 5'-GCTCCAGCAGAGCTGGAAGT-3', reverse, 5'-\nAAGTTTCTGCCGGAAGTTCAGT-3'; \u03b2-actin forward, 5'-\nCAGCTCACCATGGATGATGATATC-3', reverse, 5'-AAGCCGGCCTTGCACAT-\n3'. These were used at 900 pmol (forward) and 300 pmol (reverse) in a 25 \u03bcl reaction \nvolume and were checked for linear amplification characteristics at the these \nconcentrations across a range of cDNA concentrations prior to use in assay. Reactions \nwere carried out using an ABI PRISM7000 RT-PCR machine. The expression level of \nthe Noxa gene was determined by normalization to \u03b2-actin in all samples.  Statistical \nsignificance of the data was assessed by an unpaired two tailed t-test on log 2 \ntransformed data. \n \n Small RNA Interference (siRNA) of Bim, Bmf, Noxa and Bak. Jurkat cells were \nelectroporated with siRNA oligonucleotides using a Nucleofector system (Amaxa). \nCells (2x106 cells) were suspended in annealed siRNA oligonucleotides (0.25 nmol) \nin solution V (100 \u03bcl) and electroporated using program C16. Cells were transferred \nto pre-warmed medium (0.9 ml) in 12-well plates for 24 h and then pre-warmed \nmedium (1 ml) was added and cells were exposed to LBH589 for 8 h. The sequences \nused for RNA interference (RNAi) for Bim and Bmf were validated by previous \nstudies.15, 29  The sense strand sequences used were as follows:- \nBim a sense, 5\u2032-(AGCAACCUUCUGAUGUAAGtt)-3\u2032;  \nBim a' sense, 5\u2032-(GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUtt)-3\u2032; \n 7\nBmf b sense, 5\u2032-(AAUCGUGUGUGGUGGCAGAtt)-3\u2032;  \nBmf b' sense, 5\u2032-(CAAGGUGUCAUGCUGCCUUtt)-3\u2032; \nNoxa c and c' oligos were predesigned by Ambion (ID: 5926 and 144356, \nrespectively); Bak and untargeted siRNA oligos were predesigned by Ambion (ID: \n120201 and 4635, respectively).  \nImmunoprecipitation of Mcl-1 \n After treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in \nlysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 1% CHAPS supplemented \nwith a cocktail of protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were spun at \n13,000 g for 20 min at 40C. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with Protein G Sepharose \nbeads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AP, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 40C. Protein \nconcentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Biorad, Herts, UK). Protein G \nSepharose beads (100 \u03bcl) were washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and then \nincubated at 40C for 1 h using a daisy wheel with 2 \u03bcg of mouse IgG or mouse anti-\nMcl-1 mAb (BD Biosciences). The labelled beads were washed three times with 0.2 \nM triethanolamine (pH 8.2) followed by incubation, using a daisy wheel, with cross-\nlinker (0.2 M ethanolamine (pH 8.2), 20 mM dimethyl pimelinediimidate (Fluka \nBiochemika, Switzerland)) at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking \nreactions were terminated by incubation with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) for 15 min at \nroom temperature. The cross-linked beads were washed three times with PBS and \n0.05% Tween 20 and incubated on a daisy wheel overnight at 40C with 0.6 mg of pre-\ncleared lysate. The samples were eluted by SDS-sample buffer without 2-\nmercaptoethanol. \n \nDensitometric analysis \nBlots were scanned on a Bioimaging Systems machine (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). \nThe density of the bands was measured using the GeneSnap and Gene tool software \n(Syngene, Cambridge, UK).  \n \n \n 8\nResults \nHDACi-induced apoptosis requires de novo protein synthesis and occurs by \nactivation of the intrinsic pathway \nThe HDACi, LBH589 and SAHA, induced apoptosis in both K562 and Z138 cells, as \nassessed by both an increase in cells with phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and \na decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) (Figure 1a lanes 4, 7, 13 and \n16). Pre-treatment with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD.fmk (25 \u03bcM), \nprevented the HDACi-mediated increase in PS externalization but not the loss in \n\u0394\u03a8m (Figure 1a lanes 5, 8, 14 and 17), whereas pre-treatment with cycloheximide \nblocked both (Figure 1a lanes 6, 9, 15 and 18). Thus these results suggested that \nHDACi-induced apoptosis required both de novo protein synthesis and occurred by \nactivation of the intrinsic pathway as the loss of \u0394\u03a8m occurred prior to caspase \nactivation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the processing of caspase-3 and -9 \nand the cleavage of the caspase-3\/-7 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). \nLBH589 induced a time dependent loss of \u0394\u03a8m and increase in PS externalization in \nboth K562 and Z138 cells with \u0394\u03a8m loss clearly preceding increases in PS \nexternalization in K562 cells (Figure 1b lanes 2-7). A time-dependent HDACi-\nmediated processing of caspase-3 and -9 as well as PARP was observed, which was \nprevented by cycloheximide (Figure 1b lanes 9 and 15). In contrast z-VAD.fmk (25 \n\u03bcM) was not as efficient as cycloheximide at inhibiting caspase processing, its effects \nbeing primarily to significantly inhibit the processing of caspase-3 to its processed \nand catalytically active p17\/19 forms and to almost completely prevent PARP \ncleavage (Figure 1b lanes 8 and 14 ). Similar effects were observed with z-VAD.fmk \nin Jurkat cells (Figure 1b lanes 16-19). Cycloheximide (1 \u03bcM) alone induces \napoptosis in Jurkat cells so precluding its use in conjunction with LBH589. Taken \ntogether our data strongly suggested that de novo protein synthesis was required for \nHDACi-mediated apoptosis and caspase processing and that HDACi-induced \napoptosis occurred by the intrinsic pathway.     \n \nGeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is not a general mechanism for \nHDACi-mediated apoptosis.  \nAs ROS generation has been implicated in HDACi-induced apoptosis,11, 20, 30 we \nwished to investigate if this was a general mechanism. Using hydrogen peroxide as a \n 9\npositive control, an increase in ROS was observed within 1 h in K562, Z138 and \nJurkat E6.1 cells (Supplemental Figure 1a) and this increase was almost totally \ninhibited by pre-treatment with diphenyleneiodinium chloride (5 \u03bcM) (data not \nshown). Similarly sodium valproate (2.5 mM) and MS-275 (250 \u03bcM) induced an \nincrease in ROS within 1 h that was blocked by diphenyleneiodinium chloride, \nwhereas no increase in ROS was observed following incubation for up to 8 h with \nLBH589 (10 nM - 50 \u03bcM) and SAHA (250 nM - 250 \u03bcM) (Supplemental Figure 1a \nand data not shown). These concentrations of SAHA, LBH589 and MS-275 all induce \napoptosis in these cell lines (Figure 1 and data not shown). These results do not \nsupport a general role for ROS at the early stages of HDACi-induced apoptosis, \nalthough they may be important in apoptosis induced by certain specific HDACi in \nsome cell types.  \n \nHDACi induce an increase in Bim, Bmf and Noxa \nLBH589 induced a time dependent accumulation of both acetylated tubulin and \nacetylated histones in K562, Z138 and Jurkat cells (Figure 2a) compatible with it \nbeing an inhibitor of Class I and II HDACs in agreement with previous \nobservations.31 LBH589 caused a time dependent increase in p21 expression in all \nthree cell lines, which was p53 independent (K562 cells are p53 null) and was \ncompletely prevented by pre-treatment with cycloheximide but not z-VAD.fmk \n(Figure 2a). HDACi resulted in accumulation of acetylated proteins resulting in de \nnovo synthesis of proteins, such as p21, which was completely blocked by \ncycloheximide. In addition this experiment shows that this concentration of \ncycloheximide was sufficient to inhibit de novo protein synthesis in these cell lines.  \n \nBased on previous reports, we suspected that HDACi modulated apoptosis by \naffecting Bcl-2 family members.15, 17, 32 Examination of the effects of LBH589 on the \nexpression of multi-domain anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins revealed no \nmajor alterations in the levels of Bax, Bak or Bcl-2 (Figure 2b). A time dependent \ndecrease in Bcl-XL was observed being most marked in K562 and Z138 cells (Figure \n2b), compatible with HDACi ability to down regulate expression of many genes, \nincluding Bcl-2.1, 2, 33  The effects on Mcl-1 appeared somewhat more complex. A \nmarked loss of Mcl-1 was observed in the presence of cycloheximide in Z138 cells \n 10\n(Figure 2b lane 15) and to a lesser extent in K562 cells (Figure 2b lanes 6 and 9) \ncompatible with the known short half life of Mcl-1 due to proteasomal degradation.34 \nA time-dependent uncharacterized immunoreactive protein of ~32 kDa appeared that \nwas inhibited by cycloheximide but not by z-VAD.fmk (Figure 2b compare lanes 6, 9 \nand 15 with 5, 8 and 14). In Jurkat cells, a caspase-dependent cleavage product of \nMcl-1 of ~ 28 kDa was observed that was inhibited by z-VAD.fmk (Figure 2b lanes \n18-19). Although no significant changes were observed in Bad or Bik in the three cell \nlines, marked changes were noted in Noxa and Bim (Figure 2c). Incubation with \nLBH589 resulted in a loss of Bid and Puma at later times that was prevented by z-\nVAD.fmk (Figure 2c compare lanes 7 and 8, 13 and 14 and 18 and 19), raising the \npossibility that Puma may be a caspase substrate as previously observed for Bid. \nLBH589 also caused a marked induction of Bmf in Jurkat cells, but not in K562 or \nZ138 cells, which did not express detectable levels of the protein (Figure 2c). A rapid \ntime-dependent increase in Noxa was observed in all three cell lines after exposure to \nLBH589 (Figure 2c lanes 2, 11 and 17), which was totally abrogated by \ncycloheximide (Figure 2c lanes 6, 9 and 15) but not by z-VAD.fmk. Similarly \nLBH589 induced a time dependent increase in BimEL that was inhibited by \ncycloheximide but not z-VAD.fmk (Figure 2c).  \n \nTo confirm these increases in Noxa and Bim were observed with other HDACi, we \nexamined the effects of MS-275 and SAHA using LBH589 as a positive control. Both \nMS-275 and SAHA induced a marked increase in BimEL and Noxa that was inhibited \nby cycloheximide (Figure 2d). MS-275 and SAHA also caused a decrease in Bcl- XL \nin K562 and Z138 cells (Figure 2d). A decrease in Mcl-1 was clearly observed in both \nK562 and Z138 cells following exposure to cycloheximide for 24 and 16 h, \nrespectively (Figure 2d) consistent with its known short half-life.  \n \nHDACi-mediated increases in Noxa and Bim but not Bmf are functionally active \nAs Bmf was only detected in Jurkat cells, we chose these cells to investigate the \nfunctional importance of the increase in Bim, Bmf and Noxa in HDACi-induced \napoptosis. Exposure of Jurkat cells to LBH589 again caused an up-regulation of Bim, \nBmf and Noxa (Figure 3a compare lanes 1 and 2). We then examined the effects of \ntwo siRNAs for Bim, Bmf and Noxa on this HDACi-mediated up-regulation of the \nBH3-only proteins. Only one siRNA for Bim (a\u2032) and one for Bmf (b\u2032) caused a \n 11\nspecific reduction in Bim or Bmf, respectively without affecting the other BH3-only \nproteins (Figure 3a lanes 2, 4 and 6). Both siRNAs for Noxa (c and c\u2032) caused a \ndecrease in Noxa without affecting Bim or Bmf (Figure 3a lanes 2, 7 and 8). \nCombinations of the different siRNAs for Bim, Bmf and Noxa, using only the active \nsiRNAs (a\u2032 and b\u2032), also gave the desired specificity of knockdown of different BH3-\nonly proteins (Figure 3a lanes 9-15). Another siRNA for Noxa (ID: 144355, Ambion) \nshowed similar results (data not shown). \n \nNext we examined the effects of these siRNAs on LBH589-induced apoptosis in \nJurkat cells. LBH589 induced apoptosis as assessed by an increase in PS \nexternalization and loss of \u0394\u03a8m as well as processing of caspase-9 and -3 to their \np37\/35 and p19\/17 large fragments, respectively (Figure 3b lane 2). Knockdown with \nthe active siRNA for Bim (a\u2032) resulted in a partial protection from LBH589-induced \napoptosis, assessed by PS externalization, \u0394\u03a8m and processing of caspase-9 and -3, \nwhereas no protection was afforded by transfection of the inactive siRNA for Bim (a) \n(Figure 3b compare lanes 4 and 3). Neither the active nor inactive siRNA for Bmf \nafforded any protection against LBH589-induced apoptosis (Figure 3b lanes 5 and 6), \nwhereas both siRNAs for Noxa caused a partial protection (Figure 3b lanes 7 and 8). \nSignificantly the protection afforded by both the siRNAs for Bim and Noxa involved \npreservation of cells with high \u0394\u03a8m and a decrease in PS externalization together \nwith a decreased processing of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 to their large subunits \n(Figure 3b lanes 4, 7 and 8). These results demonstrated that knockdown of Bim or \nNoxa conferred a marked protection against LBH589-induced apoptosis and strongly \nsupported the hypothesis that this HDACi-mediated apoptosis resulted from an \ninduction of Bim and Noxa upstream of mitochondria followed by loss of \u0394\u03a8m and \nformation of the Apaf-1 apoptosome and activation of caspase-9 followed by \nactivation of effector caspases. No marked protection was provided by any \ncombination of two individual siRNAs over the effective siRNA alone (Figure 3b \nlanes 9-13). However, the combination of all three siRNAs may have conferred some \nadded protection (Figure 3b lanes 14-15).  \n \nAs Jurkat cells have undetectable levels of Bax expression (Figure 2b),35 we assumed \nthat HDACi-induced apoptosis was mediated by Bak. To test this hypothesis, \n 12\nHDACi-induced apoptosis was examined in Jurkat cells with decreased Bak. Firstly \nwe confirmed that siRNA for Bak resulted in a marked reduction in cellular Bak \n(Figure 3c compare lanes 2 and 4) without affecting either endogenous levels or \nHDACi-induced increased levels of Noxa or BimEL (Figure 3c lanes 2-4). Knockdown \nof Bak caused a marked protection against HDACi-induced apoptosis (Figure 3c \ncompare lanes 2 and 4). Similarly knockdown of Noxa, used as a positive control, \nagain abrogated LBH589-induced apoptosis (Figure 3c compare lanes 2 and 3). \n \nHDACi causes a transcriptional up-regulation of Noxa mRNA \nAs we had observed that the increase in Noxa was functionally important, we wished \nto ascertain whether the increase in Noxa was due to transcriptional upregulation.  \nUsing real time RT-PCR we determined that LBH589 caused a time dependent \nincrease in Noxa mRNA levels which was statistically significant at 2 h (Figure 3d). \nThe HDACi-mediated increase in Noxa mRNA levels was abrogated by the \ntranscriptional inhibitor, Actinomycin D (Figure 3d). Additionally exposure of Jurkat \ncells to Act D blocked LBH589 mediated increases in protein levels of Noxa \n(Supplemental Figure 2). Taken together these data demonstrate that LBH589 causes \nincreased Noxa by elevated gene transcription.  \n \nNoxa immunoprecipitates with endogenous Mcl-1 \nIn normal cells, Bak is sequestered by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL.10, 36 To test the hypothesis \nthat HDACi-induced apoptosis could be due in part to the increase in Noxa binding to \nMcl-1 so allowing Bak to exert its pro-apoptotic function, we initially examined \nwhether Noxa was associated with Mcl-1. Endogenous Mcl-1 was \nimmunoprecipitated and examined for Mcl-1, Noxa and Bak. An increased expression \nof Noxa (5-6 fold) but not Mcl-1 or Bak (Figure 4a and b lanes 1-2) was observed \nfollowing exposure of Jurkat or CLL cells to LBH589. Although no significant \nincrease in cellular levels of Mcl-1 was observed, the amount of Mcl-1 \nimmunoprecipitated increased (1.6- 2.4-fold) in LBH589 exposed cells (Figure 4a and \nb lanes 5-6). The more efficient binding to the Mcl-1 antibody may have been due to a \nconformational change in Mcl-1 after disruption of its binding to its normal partners \nby the increased Noxa.  Exposure of both Jurkat and CLL cells to LBH589 followed \nby immunoprecipitation with the Mcl-1 mAb resulted in a marked increase in Noxa \n(Figure 4a and b lanes 5-6). In contrast no major change or possibly only a small \n 13\ndecrease in the amount of Bak immunoprecipitated by the Mcl-1 Ab was observed \n(Figure 4a and b lanes 5-6). These data demonstrate that the LBH589-induced an \nincrease in Noxa binding to Mcl-1 in both Jurkat and CLL cells.   \n \nLBH589 induces BH3-only proteins in CLL cells \nDepsipeptide and MS-275 induce apoptosis in CLL cells.21, 37 We wished to examine \nthe ability of LBH589 to induce apoptosis in CLL cells and to assess the involvement \nof BH3-only proteins. We have examined the effects of cycloheximide on LBH589-\ninduced apoptosis in cells from 30 different patients, cells from 9 patients were \nexcluded due to high spontaneous apoptosis (\u2265 35 %) at 20 h and cells from 9 further \npatients were excluded due to sensitivity to cycloheximide. LBH589 induced \napoptosis in CLL cells from the remaining 12 patients, which was partly but not \nentirely blocked by co-treatment with cycloheximide (Figure 5a). The cycloheximide \nconcentration could not be increased because of its ability to induce apoptosis. Thus \nwhilst there is a major component of LBH589-induced apoptosis in CLL cells that is \nprotein synthesis dependent, there may also be a component that is protein synthesis \nindependent. Valproate and MS-275 but not LBH589 and SAHA induced the early \ngeneration of ROS in CLL cells (Supplemental Figure 1b). No changes were observed \nin Bax, Bak or Bcl-2 following exposure of CLL cells to LBH589 despite a marked \ninduction of apoptosis (Figure 5b). Bcl-xL expression in CLL cells is either very low \nor undetectable (Inoue and Snowden \u2013 unpublished data).38  However, significant \nprocessing of caspase-3 to its p19\/17 catalytically active large subunit accompanied \nby cleavage of Mcl-1 was observed in cells from four individuals examined (Figure \n5b lanes 5, 12, 19 and 26). z-VAD.fmk (20 \u03bcM) almost completely inhibited HDACi-\ninduced apoptosis in cells from all four patients, when assessed by PS externalization \nbut not by loss in \u0394\u03a8m (Figure 5b). z-VAD.fmk also markedly inhibited the \nprocessing of caspase-3, by blocking the formation of the p19\/17 subunits of caspase-\n3, which was accompanied by the appearance of an ~20 kDa fragment as well as an \naccumulation of the unprocessed zymogen (Figure 3c lanes 6, 13, 20 and 27). This \np20 fragment is most probably catalytically inactive and likely arises from the \ncovalent binding of z-VAD.fmk to the large subunit of caspase-3 following its initial \ncleavage by caspase-9 at Asp 175 between the large and small subunits.39 The effects \nof cycloheximide on HDACi-induced apoptosis in CLL cells were clearly different \n 14\nfrom those of z-VAD.fmk. Cycloheximide protected against HDACi-induced loss of \n\u0394\u03a8m as well as causing a partial protection against the increase in PS externalization \nand partially blocked caspase-3 processing (Figure 5b).   \n \nExposure to LBH589 resulted in a time-dependent induction of some BH3-only \nproteins with significant inter-individual variation observed (Figure 5c). In cells from \nall 7 patients, a rapid time-dependent induction of Noxa was observed that was \ninhibited by cycloheximide but not z-VAD.fmk (Figure 5c and Supplemental Figure \n3). LBH589 caused a marked time- and protein synthesis-dependent induction of Bim \nin cells from 3 patients (Figure 5c #1 and 2 and Supplemental Figure 3 #7) with a \nmuch more modest increase in cells from 3 other patients (Figure 5c #3 and 4 and \nSupplemental Figure 3 #5 ) and no increase in cells from 1 patiens (Supplemental \nFigure 3 #6). Induction of Bmf was clearly observed in cells from some patients but \nnot others (Figure 5c and Supplemental Figure 3). Little or no induction of Puma or \nBid was observed following exposure to LBH589 (Figure 5c). However, a time-\ndependent loss of both Bid and Puma was observed, which was prevented by z-\nVAD.fmk (Figure 5c lanes 5, 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26 and 27). Taken together with the \ncell lines (Figure 2c), these data suggest that Puma, as well as Bid, may be a caspase \nsubstrate. In summary, although significant inter-individual variation was observed in \nthe HDACi-mediated increases in BH3-only proteins in CLL cells, the most \nconsistent response was a rapid increase in Noxa.    \n 15\n \nDiscussion  \nOur data strongly support the suggestion that HDACi induce apoptosis primarily by \nthe intrinsic pathway with caspase-9 as the apical caspase in agreement with previous \nstudies.3, 11, 12 In agreement with previous studies,20, 21 some HDACi, such as MS-275 \nand valproate, caused ROS generation. However this ROS generation did not seem to \nplay a general role in the early stages of HDACi-induced apoptosis in various \nleukemic cell lines and CLL cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Rather, our data highlight \na requirement for de novo protein synthesis of BH3-only proteins in HDACi-mediated \napoptosis. Recent studies have also reported that HDACi-induced apoptosis may be \nmediated by increases in BH3-only proteins particularly Bim and Bmf, although this \nmay be cell type dependent.14-17, 32, 40 In addition to HDACi-mediated increases in \nBim and Bmf, we demonstrate a p53-independent HDACi-mediated increase in Noxa \nthat precedes the induction of other BH3-only proteins.  \n \nHDACi-induction of Noxa has not been previously characterized. The mechanism \nwhereby HDACi increase Noxa expression is beyond the scope of the current \nmanuscript, although some of the increased expression is clearly due to an up-\nregulation of mRNA for Noxa (Figure 3d). Although some studies in melanoma cells \nhave noted that HDACi do not induce Noxa expression 41, the increase in Noxa \nobserved in haemopoietic cells in the present study may not be entirely surprising as \nNoxa shows an elevated expression in the haemopoietic system particularly in B \ncells.42 In addition, it has been recently shown that CLL cells express high levels of \nNoxa mRNA.43 Although Noxa was initially reported as a p53 responsive gene,44, 45 \nmore recent work has demonstrated a p53-independent induction of Noxa involving \neither E2F1 or p73.46, 47 However, our preliminary studies suggest that HDACi-\ninduced increase in Noxa in some cell lines is independent of E2F1 or p73 \n(Supplemental Figure 4). Proteasome inhibitors can also induce Noxa in a p53-\nindependent manner in melanoma, multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma cells \nand blocking this induction by antisense oligonucleotides or RNA interference \nprotects against apoptosis.48-50 Interestingly in these studies, Noxa was selectively \nincreased in melanoma compared to normal melanocytes suggesting that upregulation \nof Noxa may be valuable therapeutic strategy for some malignancies.48, 50  We \ndemonstrate a rapid and extensive HDACi-mediated induction of Noxa in CLL and \n 16\nother leukemic cells (Figures 2 and 5), that is functionally important (Figure 3). \nAlthough HDACi-mediated induction of Bim and Bmf was also observed, the most \nconsistent change was the increase in Noxa observed in all 7 patient samples analyzed \nas well as in the different cell lines. \n \nUnlike other BH3-only proteins, Noxa interacts and inactivates almost exclusively \nwith Mcl-1 and to a lesser extent with Bfl-1\/A1 but not with other anti-apoptotic Bcl-\n2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w.7-10  In this regard, expression \nof Bcl-xL and Bcl-w was below detectable levels in CLL cells (Inoue and Snowden\u2013 \nunpublished data).38 HDACi-mediated up-regulation of Noxa was associated with \nendogenous Mcl-1 in both CLL and Jurkat cells (Figure 4). In some cells, the \ninteraction of Noxa and Mcl-1 results in displacement of Bak from Mcl-1 followed by \nrapid proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1.10  Mcl-1 may be an important regulator of \napoptosis in response to changes in the cellular environment and is rapidly down-\nregulated in response to apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA damage.10, 34, 36  In the present \nstudy, extensive HDACi-induced apoptosis can clearly occur in the absence of \nmarked loss of Mcl-1 (Figures 2 and 5). Thus rapid loss of Mcl-1 accompanying \napoptosis is both cell type and stimulus dependent and is not an absolute requirement \nfor HDACi-induced apoptosis mediated by increased Noxa and Bim. Another \npossible consequence of the Noxa\/Mcl-1 interaction could be the release of Bak with \na consequent loss of \u0394\u03a8m and induction of apoptosis.10  Somewhat surprisingly the \nincreased Noxa binding resulted in only a small decrease if any in the amount of Bak \nimmunoprecipitated by the Mcl-1 Ab (Figure 4). Our results raise the possibility that \nNoxa, in addition to its primary mode of inducing apoptosis through release of Bak \nfrom Mcl-1, may also exert additional effects, such as a direct activation of the \nmitochondrial permeability transition pore.51  However such an effect of Noxa would \nstill need to act in concert with Bak, as Bak knockdown resulted in marked protection \n(Figure 3c) confirming a key role for Bak in HDACi-induced apoptosis, at least in \nJurkat cells that express little or no Bax (Figure 2b).35  Furthermore Bak knockdown \ndid not affect HDACi-mediated induction of either Bim or Noxa (Figure 3c) \ncompatible with the hypothesis that BH3-only proteins act upstream of Bak and Bax.4, \n7  \n \n 17\nBased on our findings, it is interesting to speculate in which paradigms the HDACi-\nmediated increases in Noxa may be significant. Increased Noxa neutralizes Mcl-1 so \ninactivating the major member of one group of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. \nFirstly, increased Noxa may be important in cells where the HDACi also causes a \nconcomitant decrease in members of the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pro-survival group, \nsuch as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, or Bcl-w. Such HDACi-mediated decreases in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 \nwere observed in this (Figure 2) and other studies, respectively.33  Secondly, the Noxa \nincrease may be important in cells, such as Jurkat, that are Bax negative and Bak \npositive, as well as in tumors with deletions or mutations in Bax.52  Thirdly, Noxa \nincreases may be important in tumors such as CLL, where Mcl-1 is proposed to be an \nimportant anti-apoptotic protein.53  In this regard, a very recent study showed that a \ndecreased Noxa\/Mcl-1 ratio in lymph nodes compared to peripheral CLL cells \ncorrelated with increased survival.38  Additionally HDACi may decrease the elevated \nlevels of Bcl-xL found in lymph nodes,38 so facilitating the induction of apoptosis in \nlymph nodes. Furthermore, Noxa levels in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma cells can \nalso be increased by proteasome inhibitors leading to the proposal that the Noxa\/Mcl-\n1 ratio may be a key determinant of cell death in these diseases.38, 49  Taken together \nwith our present findings, these data suggest that Noxa may be an attractive clinical \ntarget in the treatment of CLL and possibly other haematological malignancies.   \n \nIn the present study, we observed a late caspase-dependent loss of both Puma and Bid. \nCaspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid is important in amplification of the extrinsic \npathway.54  However, Bid is also cleaved by effector caspases at later times following \nan apoptotic stimulus. To our knowledge, this is the first description that Puma may \nbe a caspase substrate. The physiological or pathological importance of this cleavage \nis not known. Although this cleavage occurred late in the apoptotic process, Puma \nmay also be cleaved early in apoptosis by an initiator caspase.  \n \nIn summary, HDACi induce apoptosis by inducing de novo protein synthesis of BH3-\nonly proteins, particularly Noxa and Bim, and consequent activation of the intrinsic \npathway. Up-regulation of Noxa by different therapeutic strategies, including HDACi, \nmay provide a novel and valuable approach to target certain malignancies, including \nCLL.  \n \n 18\n \n 19\nReferences \n1 Marks P, Rifkind RA, Richon VM, Breslow R, Miller T, Kelly WK.

HDACi-mediated induction of apoptosis requires de novo protein \nsynthesis. \n(a) K562 and Z138 cells were incubated either alone or with LBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM) \nor SAHA (25 \u03bcM) for 24 and 16 h, respectively either alone or in the presence of the \ncaspase inhibitor, z-VAD.fmk (Vad 25 \u03bcM) or cycloheximide (Chx 2.5 \u03bcM). \nApoptosis was the assessed either by measuring the cells with lower mitochondrial \nmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) or increase in phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. \nResults shown are the Mean \u00b1 SD (n=3). (b) K562, Z138 and Jurkat cells were \nincubated with LBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM) and apoptosis measured as described in (a). \nThe processing of caspase-9 and -3 and the cleavage of PARP was also assessed by \nwestern blotting.  \n \n \nFigure 2. HDACi-mediated induction of BH-3-only proteins in various cell lines.  \n(a-c) K562 and Z138 cells were incubated either alone or with LBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM) \nin the presence or absence of z-VAD.fmk (z-VAD 25 \u03bcM) or cycloheximide (CHX \n2.5 \u03bcM) as indicated. Cells were harvested at the indicated times and cell lysates \nanalyzed as follows.  (a) Inhibition of HDAC activity was assessed by accumulation \nof acetylated tubulin (Ac-tubulin) and acetylated histone H3 or H4 (Ac-H3 or Ac-H4). \nDe novo protein synthesis and its inhibition were assessed by the accumulation of p21 \nin the presence or absence of cycloheximide. (b) Effects on anti-apoptotic and Bax \nBak like pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members assessed by western blotting. (c) Effects \non BH3-only proteins analyzed by western blotting. (d) K562 and Z138 cells were \nincubated for 24 or 16 h, respectively, either alone, or with LBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM), \nMS-275 (MS 250 \u03bcM), or SAHA (25 \u03bcM) in the presence or absence of \ncycloheximide (CHX 2.5 \u03bcM) as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by western \nblotting for the indicated proteins. Apoptosis was also assessed by measuring PS \nexternalization. \n \nFigure 3. Knockdown of Noxa and Bim protects cells from HDACi-induced \napoptosis.  \n 24\nJurkat cells were transfected for 24 h with (a and b) two siRNAs for untargeted \nsequences (-), Bim (a, a'), Bmf (b, b') or Noxa (c, c') and (c) siRNA for untargeted \nsequences (-), Noxa or Bak. Cells were exposed to LBH589 (LBH) (25 \u03bcM) for 8h \nfollowed by western blotting with (a and c) Bcl-2 family proteins as indicated and (b) \ncaspase-3 and \u20139. Apoptosis was also assessed by PS externalization and loss of \u0394\u03a8m \n(b). (d) Jurkat cells were exposed to LBH589 (25 \u03bcM) for 1 or 2 h either alone or in \nthe presence of Actinomycin D (Act D 5 \u03bcg ml-1). Expression of Noxa and \u03b2-actin \nwere analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The results are expressed as the fold change in \nNoxa expression normalized to the expression of \u03b2-actin. The asterisk (*) indicates \nsignificantly different from the corresponding control (p<0.05).  \n \nFigure 4. Immunoprecipitation of Noxa and Mcl-1. \n(a) Jurkat and (b) CLL cells were exposed to LBH589 (25 \u03bcM) for 6 h and 14 h, \nrespectively. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for the indicated proteins. \nCell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse IgG or mouse anti-Mcl-1 mAb \nfollowed by western blotting with the indicated antibody. For detection of Bak in the \nlysate, a short exposure is shown (lanes 1-2) whereas the longer exposure was \nnecessary to detect Bak in the immunoprecipitated samples.  In the lysate samples \neach lane (lanes 1-2) was loaded with 10 \u03bcg or 20 \u03bcg protein for Jurkat or CLL cells, \nrespectively. Cells were lysed with 1% CHAPS and solubilized protein (0.15 mg for \nJurkat cells and 0.3 mg for CLL cells) was pre-cleared followed by \nimmunoprecipitation (IP) and western blotting (lanes 3-6). Western blots were also \nanalyzed by densitometry as described in Material and Methods and the results \nexpressed as the ratio of Mcl-1, Bak or Noxa in either the lysate or the Mcl-1-\nimmunoprecipitiate from LBH589 compared to control cells (lanes 1-2 and 5-6).   \n \nFigure 5. LBH589 induces Noxa and Bim in CLL cells. \n(a) CLL cells from twelve patients were cultured for 20 h either alone (Con) or with \ncycloheximide (CHX 2.5 \u03bcM), LBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM) alone or in combination \n(LBH\/CHX). Apoptosis was assessed either by measuring cells with lower \nmitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) or increase in phosphatidylserine (PS) \nexternalization. Each line represents the data from one individual patient. The mean \nvalues represent the means of the 12 patients. (b and c) CLL cells from four \n 25\nindividuals were incubated for either 5 or 20 h either alone or in the presence of \nLBH589 (LBH 25 \u03bcM), z-VAD.fmk (z-VAD 200 \u03bcM) or cycloheximide (CHX 2.5 \n\u03bcM) and cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for the indicated proteins. \nApoptosis was assessed by \u0394\u03a8m or PS externalization. Two Puma Abs were used in \norder to confirm the specificity and help distinguish Puma \u03b1 and \u03b2. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
