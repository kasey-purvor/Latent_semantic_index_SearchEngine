Introduction\nBacterial chemotaxis refers to the ability of bacteria to sense changes in their extracel-\nlular environment and to bias their motility towards favorable stimuli (attractants) and\naway from unfavorable stimuli (repellents). Generally too small to sense a change in ex-\ntracellular gradient along their own length, bacteria use a system of membrane receptors\nand intracellular signals to sense, adapt, and respond to changes in their environment.\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: tindallm@maths.ox.ac.uk (M.J. Tindall).\n1526 Tindall et al.\nBacterial chemotaxis was first observed in the late 1800s (Beyerinck, 1895; Engelmann,\n1881a, 1881b; Pfeffer, 1888). The motivation for studying such small organisms lies in\nthe belief that elucidating the mechanisms controling their behavior will help in under-\nstanding more complex biological pathways and organisms. Hence today, in part thanks\nto the pioneering work of Adler (1966), bacterial chemotaxis is one of the most studied\nand well-documented systems in biology, serving as a powerful model for higher organ-\nisms. There remain, however, a number of important, unanswered questions about this\nintriguing system.\nThere exist a number of different but related bacterial chemosensory systems (Eisen-\nbach et al., 2004), of which the most widely studied is Escherichia coli (E. coli).1 E. coli\nis a rod-shaped bacterium with polar clusters of membrane-spanning methyl-accepting\nchemotaxis proteins (MCPs) situated at either end of the cell as shown in Fig. 1 (Mad-\ndock and Shapiro, 1993; Lybarger and Maddock, 2001). Receptor types (responding to\ndifferent chemoeffectors) vary both within each bacterium as well as across the various\nspecies. In E. coli, the most common receptors are Tar (responding to aspartate) and Tsr\n(serine), with Tap (dipeptides), Trg (galactose) and Aer (oxygen) being less abundant\n(Bren and Eisenbach, 2000). In the case of E. coli, the four or so flagella are located at\nrandom points on the bacterial membrane which during smooth swimming, collectively\nbundle together to propel the bacterium through the medium.\nBacteria swim in a random walk in the absence of a gradient of attractant or repellent.\nIn the presence of attractant gradients, this random walk becomes biased so that movement\ntowards a better environment is favored. E. coli alternates between counter-clockwise\n(CCW) rotations of its flagella and clockwise (CW) rotations. CCW rotations result in\nruns while CW rotations are responsible for tumbling and reorientation of the bacterium.\nCCW rotations cause the flagella to come together forming a single flagellar bundle which\npropels the bacterium through the surrounding medium. When the cells are swimming up\nan attractant gradient, CCW rotation is favoured resulting in longer periods of directed\nmotion (runs).\nThe signal transduction between the receptors and the flagellar motors is controlled by\na set of well defined intracellular protein\u2013protein interactions (Wadhams and Armitage,\n2004). In the case of E. coli, one of the most common attractants used to study the bacte-\nrial response is aspartate. A number of intracellular proteins (known as chemotaxis (Che)\nproteins) provide the necessary signaling cascade which links the membrane receptors to\nthe flagellar motor as shown in Fig. 1. Both CheW and CheA are localized to the recep-\ntors. CheW is thought to act as a linker between the receptor and CheA although CheA\nappears to also directly interact with the receptors. To bring about tumbling, the receptors\nactivate CheA autophosphorylation on a conserved histidine in response to decreased at-\ntractant or increased repellent concentration. One of the phosphoryl groups is transferred\nto CheY. CheYP shows a reduced affinity for CheA and a higher affinity for the flagellar\nmotor protein FliM, and thus diffuses through the cytoplasm to the motors. CheZ acts to\ndephosphorylate CheYP at the receptors to regulate the rate of signal termination.\n1The work presented in this manuscript focuses mainly on E. coli given that most experimental and thus\ntheoretical work has been undertaken using this system. The reader should consult Garrity and Ordal\n(1995), Armitage (1999), Eisenbach et al. (2004), and Wadhams and Armitage (2004) for details on other\nchemotactic species.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1527\nFig. 1 A schematic representation (not to scale) of a typical E. coli bacterium (approximately 3 \u00b5m long)\nshowing the location of the membrane receptors and flagella. At the cell poles, the receptor proteins are\nclustered along with the linker protein CheW and the kinase CheA. A decrease of attractant causes CheA\nto autophosphorylate, the phosphorylated CheA, CheAP , is a phosphodonor for both CheY and CheB. The\nsubsequently phosphorylated CheY diffuses (indicated schematically by the dotted lines) to the flagellar\nmotors where it causes them to rotate in a clockwise direction. CheYP can be dephosphorylated by CheZ.\nThe rise in CheBP levels reduces the receptor methylation state which mediates adaptation by reducing\nthe ability of the receptors to activate CheA autophosphorylation. With the addition of attractant, the rate\nof autophosphorylation of CheA is reduced, and thus CheYP levels fall. This fall causes the motors to\nrevert to CCW rotation allowing the flagella to bundle together to produce runs.\nPhosphotransfer does not only occur between CheAP and CheY, a phosphoryl group\ncan also be transferred from CheAP to CheB. CheBP mediates the process of adapta-\ntion. The phosphotransfer between CheAP and CheB occurs more slowly than the phos-\nphotransfer between CheAP and CheY. CheB is key to resetting the receptors into the\nunstimulated state. The phosphorylated CheB acts to demethylate the receptors counter-\nacting the effect of constant methyltransferase (CheR) activity which methylates specific\nglutamate residues on the receptor. CheY and CheB both compete for a specific binding\ndomain of CheA. In the case of unstimulated bacteria, this process results in a dynamic\nequilibrium between CheR and CheBP , and thus no net methylation change of the re-\nspective receptors occurs. The most abundant receptor Tar has five methylation sites per\nmonomer (commonly denoted m = 0,1,2,3,4 in the modeling literature), which when\nmodified affect the activity of the receptors. State m = 4 is the highest methylation level\nwhereas m = 0 denotes no methylation.\nThe addition of attractant to the membrane receptors reduces the rate of CheA au-\ntophosphorylation. This has a twofold effect. First, no phosphoryl groups are available\nfor phosphotransfer to CheY. The levels of CheYP in the cytoplasm of the bacteria thus\nfall, CheY dominates and the flagellar motors rotate in the CCW direction. Second, a drop\n1528 Tindall et al.\nFig. 2 Schematic representation of typical adaptation curves to impulse (A) and step (B) attractant gradi-\nents as adapted from Segall et al. (1986). In each case, the adaptation curve comprises a period of excitation\nand a period of adaptation. The measured response is generally the motor bias (measure of CCW) or level\nof intracellular protein concentration, for instance, the concentration of CheY or CheYP . The observed\novershoot is often explained by the negative feedback of the methylation\/de-methylation process (Shimizu\net al., 2003) and was first observed by Block et al. (1982) and Segall et al. (1986).\nin CheBP allows the receptors to be methylated by CheR. The rise in receptor methyla-\ntion increases the rate of CheA auto-phosphorylation, thus returning the system to its\nprestimulus state. The effect of a typical attractant stimulus is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe following are common characteristics of bacterial systems:\nAdaptation: Many bacterial systems show an inherent ability to adapt to local changes\nin the levels of extracellular attractant or repellent over quite wide ranges (approxi-\nmately five orders of magnitude) of background concentrations (Wadhams and Armitage,\n2004). Exact adaptation in a bacterial chemotaxis context means the ability to respond to\nchanges in the external environment and return the intracellular protein phosphorylation\nlevels to their pre-stimulus levels. Adaptation is not necessarily always exact as in the\ncase of E. coli responding to serine. Following this process, the bacteria are then able to\ndetect any further changes in the attractant concentration. A typical adaptation curve is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nSensitivity: Studies have shown (Segall et al., 1986) that even small changes in the local\nextracellular environment of bacteria, as small as ten attractant molecules per cell, can\ninitiate a chemotactic response from the bacteria.\nGain: The ability to sense small changes in the extracellular environment means the bac-\nterium must be able to amplify the received signal, so as to modulate the intracellular\nsignaling cascade (Bray, 2002). Gain is generally defined as the change in motor bias\nwith respect to the change in occupancy of the receptors.\nRobustness: In order to cope with cell-to-cell variations in levels of the signal transduc-\ntion proteins the intracellular signaling network must be robust (Alon et al., 1999).\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1529\nAll of the above concepts are closely interwoven. For instance, gain requires the sen-\nsitivity of the system to be high enough to initiate the downward cascade of biochemical\nsignals. The system must be robust to cope with variations in levels of the signal transduc-\ntion proteins between cells in order to be able to adapt across an extremely wide range of\nbackground concentrations. It is important to note that these events all occur on different\ntimescales. Attractant binding occurs over the order of milliseconds whereas demethy-\nlation is of the order of 1\/10ths of seconds. In stark contrast, adaptation can take up to\nseconds or minutes dependent upon the magnitude of the stimulus (Wadhams and Ar-\nmitage, 2004).\nUnderstanding the mechanisms which drive adaptation, sensitivity, gain, and robust-\nness, both individually and collectively, has been the focus of both experimentalists and\ntheoreticians for the past four decades. In many cases, experimental work has informed\nmathematical models derived to understand concepts such as adaptation (Block et al.,\n1983). In addition, mathematical models have allowed various aspects of the bacterial\nsystem to be studied without the need for intensive experimental work, and proposed a\nrange of testable hypotheses for the way in which certain elements of the bacterial system\nmay function (Bray et al., 1998).\nThe work reviewed here focuses on mathematical models developed to understand the\nbacterial chemotactic response on the single cell scale. We begin by considering the early\nwork of experimentalists and theoreticians who sought to elucidate the reasons for the\nobserved chemotactic response by considering the idea of temporal \u201cmemory.\u201d Section 3\nfocuses on the large number of models which have been proposed to explain the observed\nadaptation of bacterial systems. The modeling of the biochemical phosphorylation cas-\ncade is discussed in Section 4 before the models which have sought to elucidate sensitivity\nvia receptor interactions are discussed in Section 5. Both the importance of and various\napproaches to modeling methylation and demethylation are briefly reviewed in Section 6.\nRecently developed models which account for the spatial movement of proteins within the\nbacterial cytoplasm are discussed in Section 7. We conclude our discussion on intracel-\nlular signaling with an overview of some common modeling assumptions and outcomes\nthat have arisen from our review process. We do not provide an overview of modeling of\nflagella motors given the recent comprehensive reviews, both experimental and theoreti-\ncal, of Berg and Berry and Armitage in this area (Berg, 2000, 2003; Berry and Armitage,\n1999).\nWhile the biochemical reactions controlling chemotaxis within bacteria are now well\nunderstood, no single mathematical model based upon experimental findings can, as yet,\nproduce an accurate and comprehensive description of adaptation, sensitivity, and gain as\nwell as being robust to changes in parameter values governing the respective processes.\nFurthermore, a number of interesting questions remain regarding certain elements of how\nthe bacterial system functions. These issues and possible areas of future research are dis-\ncussed in Section 9 of this review.\n2. Early work\nEarly mathematical modeling work (Segel, 1976; Koshland, 1977; Block et al., 1982,\n1983) focused on the adaptive behavior individual bacteria exhibited when subjected to\n1530 Tindall et al.\nFig. 3 (a) The response regulator of Macnab and Koshland (1972) as adapted from their original manu-\nscript. An intracellular control factor X is upregulated by W, due to fast enzyme activity, and downregu-\nlated by Y. Koshland (1977) later postulated the activity to be controlled by receptor methylation. (b) The\ntwo-state model of Block et al. (1982) as adapted from their original paper.\nchanges in their extracellular environment. Such work was often combined with experi-\nmental results (Block et al., 1982, 1983). In understanding such work, it is important to\nremember that much of the detailed knowledge we currently have of the biochemistry\nwithin E. coli was unknown at the time.\nMacnab and Koshland (1972) were the first to postulate that bacteria use an internal\n\u201cmemory\u201d to respond to both positive and negative stimuli. They postulated the existence\nof an intracellular compound W (essentially CheY) which was converted to a state X\n(CheYP ), as shown in Fig. 3(a). Conversion was by enzymatic processes whose activity\nwas dependent upon the concentration of the external attractant. The first enzyme acts\nquickly to ensure a rapid response by the bacteria to the external stimulus, while the post-\nadaptation response is regulated by a slower acting enzyme (predecessor to CheBP ) which\nreturns X to its pre-stimulus level by degrading it to Y (CheY). In the case of positive\nattractant, the first enzyme is more active than the second and this leads to X exceeding\na critical level which leads to chemotactic runs. In the case of a negative stimulus, X is\ndegraded and tumbling of the bacteria ensues. This notion of an intracellular or response\nregulator was further extended by Koshland (1977). He noted that covalent modification of\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1531\nthe receptors due to methylation was most likely responsible for controlling the proposed\nenzymatic activity of the response regulator X.\nThe work of the Berg laboratory (Block et al., 1982, 1983) involved undertaking a\nnumber of experiments, combined with theoretical predictions, to understand the bac-\nterial response. In their 1982 paper, they considered the bacterial response to pulses of\nattractant and repellent. They averaged the CW and CCW responses of individual cells to\nattractant and considered the average respective probability of CCW motor rotation versus\ntime. Analysis of the resulting response showed that excitation and adaptation occurred\non somewhat different timescales, sufficiently separate to infer that each was controlled\nby a different process. The time taken for a bacterium to respond to an attractant gradi-\nent indicated that it was able to integrate stimuli over a number of seconds in order to\ndetermine its response. The biphasic nature of the bacterial response also showed that\nbacteria were sensitive to stimuli which had occurred over the past few seconds and any\nvariations in concentration that occurred on a longer timescale were simply averaged out.\nFrom their results, Block et al. (1982) postulated the existence of a two-state system, as\nshown in Fig. 3(b). The respective rates, the probability of terminating a run or tumble per\nunit time, were determined from plots of the CW and CCW responses.\nIn their 1983 paper, Block et al. considered the bacterial response to increasing concen-\ntration levels (ramps) of attractant, both exponential and sinusoidal. They showed receptor\nactivity corresponded to the rate of change of receptor occupancy, thus indicating the bac-\nteria must be able to compare current and previous levels of receptor occupancy. This was\ncomparable to results found by Segel (1976, 1977) in modeling populations of chemo-\ntactic bacteria. In numerical simulations of the response regulator model of Koshland\n(1977), Block et al. (1983) showed that resultant run and tumble distributions from their\nmodel did agree with the experimentally derived ones, thus indicating that the transition\nbetween either state was not random, but depended upon adaptation to the sensory input.\nBy extending their two-state model to include a description of adaptation and receptor\noccupancy, they showed that their model agreed well with experimental evidence.\nBlock et al. (1983) were the first to formulate a basic model of the bacterial response\nwhich included adaptation and alluded to the possible role of methylation in affecting\nthe bacterial response. They adapted the model of Delbr\u00fcck and Reichardt (1956) (ini-\ntially used to show light adaptation in Phycomyces) to chemotaxis, in which the degree of\nadaptation was proposed to follow that of receptor occupancy\ndA\ndt\n= 1\n\u03c4\n(P \u2212 A),\nwhere A is the concentration of an internal (adapting) cell variable which changes ac-\ncording to the receptor occupancy P . In essence, A lags P and the difference between\nthem is referred to as the error in the signal. Here \u03c4 is an adaptation time constant. As\n\u03c4 \u2192 0, A \u2192 P and the system shows perfect adaptation. Block et al. (1983) noted that\nthe original Delbr\u00fcck\u2013Reichardt model could not account for the response thresholds the\nbacteria exhibited to attractant and repellent, but a revised model which includes methyla-\ntion can. They proposed that methylation could be the bacterium\u2019s adaptation mechanism,\nand hence the error signal could be accounted for by the difference in receptor occupancy\nand methylation.\n1532 Tindall et al.\nFig. 4 A conceptual representation of how methylation of receptors may occur. Receptors are methylated\nand demethylated with a maximum of up to five sites on each receptor complex being available for methy-\nlation. The above diagram shows a receptor which has four sites methylated (black circles) whilst the fifth\nremains unmethylated. Receptors are methylated by CheR and demethylated by CheBP .\n3. Adaptation\nFollowing the work undertaken by members of the Berg laboratory (Block et al., 1983),\na number of researchers have sought to understand adaptation within bacterial systems\n(Goldbeter and Koshland, 1982; Asakura and Honda, 1984; Segel and Goldbeter, 1986;\nHauri and Ross, 1995; Barkai and Leibler, 1997; Almogy et al., 2001; Mello and Tu,\n2003a; Arocena and Acerenza, 2004), with many of the models focusing on the role of\nmethylation in describing the process. Such models have generally used the framework\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the underlying processes. In order\nto successfully describe adaptation, the mathematical models have had to ensure that the\nsteady-state bacterial response is independent of the attractant concentration. In addition,\nmodels should also show \u201crobustness.\u201d Goldbeter and Koshland (1982) were the first to\npropose a receptor modification model which included methylation (as demonstrated in\nFig. 4). They proposed a four state model whereby free receptors are bound by attrac-\ntant and may subsequently undergo modification as shown in Fig. 5. They noted that\nfor perfect adaptation to be achieved within this model, the steady-state concentration\nof attractant-bound receptors is independent of the attractant concentration. From their\nODE model, the authors derived analytical estimates of the adaptation time and the de-\ngree to which receptor modification occurs as a function of methylation rate in either\nstate, namely kd and km. Analysis of various forms of the reaction rates, both depen-\ndent and independent of the attractant concentration and overall receptor occupancy, and\ncomparison with experiment showed that the simplifying assumption km = kd = constant\ndid not give good model-experimental agreement. Reasonable comparison was, however,\nobtained when receptor demethylation was assumed to depend on receptor occupancy.\nAsakura and Honda (1984) proposed a two-state model in which multiple methylation\noccurred in a preferred order. Based on experimental evidence from a number of sources,\ntheir model assumes unbound receptors S accept attractant molecules whereby they move\nto a state T , such that Ti = SiA where Si is the ith methylated unbound receptor state\nand A is the attractant concentration. T state receptors can accept repellent molecules to\nmove back to S. Only unbound receptors can be methylated whilst bound receptors only\nundergo demethylation, processes which were assumed to occur on a longer timescale\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1533\nFig. 5 The model of Goldbeter and Koshland (1982) as adapted from their original paper. Here R repre-\nsents the concentration of free receptors, C the concentration of attractant, RC the concentration of bound\nreceptors and RmC the concentration of bound receptors which have undergone modification. See text for\nfurther details.\nthan that of attractant binding. A dynamic equilibrium of S and T receptors can thus exist\nwhereby methylation causes a shift of the receptors toward the T state as shown in Fig. 6.\nThis simple model allows for up to n methylated states of either receptor state. Analysis of\nthe model showed that it exhibited both excitation and adaptation and the T bound states\nare independent of bound attractant concentration for certain parameter values. Asakura\nand Honda (1984) noted that their model could maintain a constant steady-state fraction\nof T states over a wide range of attractant and repellent concentrations so long as: (i) \u201cthe\nS\/T equilibria of unmethylated and fully methylated species heavily favored S and T\nconformations, respectively\u201d, i.e., L00 = S0\/T0 \u0004 1 and L0n = Sn\/Tn \u0005 1, where L00 and\nL0n represent the zeroth and nth methylation state, respectively; and (iii) all methylation\nsteps were characterized by the same rate constant ratio, i.e., \u03bc = ai\/bi = Ti\/Si\u22121. Analy-\nsis for n = 1 and n = 6 methylation states revealed that in the case of n = 1 the bacterium\ncould still maintain a steady-state over a wide range of attractant concentrations. Increas-\ning the number of methylation states increased the sensitivity of the bacterium to the\nattractant concentration, but the model sensitivity decreased more rapidly with increas-\ning attractant concentration when n = 1. From these results, Asakura and Honda (1984)\nconcluded that methylation plays a dual role. Firstly, it allows the bacterium to adapt to\nchanges in the attractant concentration and secondly, it increases the excitation sensitivity\nto small changes in it. They also noted that their model responded in a similar way to the\nexperimental findings of Block et al. (1983) in the case of a sinusoidal input.\nSegel and Goldbeter (1986) defined a four state model which achieved perfect adapta-\ntion. Although conceptually similar to the work of Goldbeter and Koshland (1982), their\nmodel allowed receptor modification to occur before or after attractant binding, in essence\nallowing the effect of methylation and de-methylation on unbound and attractant-bound\nreceptors to be considered. Similar to Asakura and Honda (1984), Segel and Goldbeter\n(1986) assumed that attractant binding occurs on a faster timescale than receptor modifica-\ntion, an assumption also adopted by many later models (see Appendix B for an overview).\nConsidering Fig. 7, the total activity of the system was defined as\nA(t) = a1R(t) + a2X(t) + a3Y (t) + a4D(t), (1)\n1534 Tindall et al.\nFig. 6 The multiple receptor methylation model of Asakura and Honda (1984). Here Si and Ti are the ith\nmethylated attractant-free and attractant-bound states, respectively. See text for further details. Adapted\nfrom Asakura and Honda (1984).\nFig. 7 The four state model of Segel and Goldbeter (1986) as adapted from their manuscript. Here R rep-\nresents the concentration of attractant-free, unmodified (unmethylated) receptors, D is the concentration\nof attractant-free, modified (methylated) receptors, L is the ligand concentration and X and Y denote the\nconcentration of attractant-bound, unmodified, and modified receptors, respectively.\nwhere ai (i = 1,2,3,4) are constants. We note that the model does not differentiate be-\ntween varying levels of methylation, as later models would, but simply that receptors are\neither unmodified (unmethylated) or modified (methylated). By choosing appropriate val-\nues of ai , based on deriving relationships assuming exact adaptation, Segel and Goldbeter\n(1986) were able to show that the model exhibited exact adaptation. Whether this model\nis robust, however, remains unclear, as no sensitivity analysis was undertaken. Segel and\nGoldbeter (1986) noted that the level of receptor modification increased with increasing\nlevels of attractant binding and that demodification acts as a counter-weight to changes in\nthe attractant concentrations. The authors also derived a number of analytical estimates\nfor the requirements for inexact adaptation, time for adaptation, the extent of receptor\nmodification and the effect of quickly removing the applied stimulus following excitation\non the system response.\nThe work of Segel and Goldbeter (1986) has been extended by Hauri and Ross (1995)\nand more recently by Arocena and Acerenza (2004). The extensions in the former in-\ncluded a description of the phosphorylation pathway (and its interaction with the receptor\ncomplexes) and increasing the number of receptor states from four to ten (five attractant-\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1535\nfree, five attractant-bound). Each receptor complex T constituted an MCP receptor and\nCheA and CheW molecules, an assumption since adopted by a number of researchers as\ndetailed in Appendix B. The Hauri and Ross model of the phosphotransfer pathway went\nso far as describing the phosphorylation of CheY and CheB and their subsequent dephos-\nphorylation. They did not include a description of the CheYP -flagellum motor interaction,\nas little was understood about the respective interactions at the time. Instead, they noted\nthe frequency of counter-clockwise rotations of the flagellum (fCCW ) could be related to\nthe CheYP levels (YP ), as experimentally observed by Kuo and Koshland (1989)\nfCCW = 11 + hY 5.5P\n, (2)\nwhere h is a constant. A description of receptor methylation by CheR was also included.\nHauri and Ross (1995) further assumed that the rate of phosphorylation was dependent\nupon the methylation level of the receptors and whether or not an external attractant was\nbound to them. Their model sought to differentiate between two different mechanisms for\nachieving adaptation, namely: (1) the effect of decreasing the rate of receptor demethyla-\ntion by CheBP ; and (2) increasing the rate of receptor methylation upon attractant bind-\ning, where the difference is due to conformational change at the receptor. Hauri and Ross\n(1995) noted that their model agreed well with experimental findings, in particular the\npredicted timescale of initial excitation is similar and the model demonstrates exact adap-\ntation for both attractants and repellents or a combination of both. However, their model\nfailed to account for the observed sensitivity and gain and the timescale of adaptation was\nnot significantly dependent upon the concentration of the stimulus. In undertaking sen-\nsitivity analysis of their model by altering the rate constants, the ability of the model to\nadapt is removed, thus the model is not robust.\nThe recent work of Arocena and Acerenza (2004) has sought to understand the effect of\nreceptor modification, via attractant binding (using mass action kinetics), in comparison\nto covalent modification via, for example, methylation or phosphorylation, over the bac-\nterial response range. Their work shows that covalent modification of the receptors allows\nthe bacterium to respond across five orders of magnitude of attractant binding, a wider\nrange than in the case of receptor modification via attractant binding. Arocena and Ac-\nerenza (2004) note that two conditions are required for a high and a repeatedly similar\nadaptive response for varying attractant concentrations: (1) by varying the number of re-\nceptor states in the model, it is found that the receptor modifying reactions need to include\na similar number of reaction cycles to the orders of magnitude of attractant concentration;\nand (2) the receptor is able to operate at steady-state. They used an optimization scheme to\nobtain estimates for their parameter values and noted that the optimized parameters gave\nhigher values than the experimentally reported ones. As with other models of adaptation,\nthey are unable to obtain the observed experimental level of sensitivity. They do, however,\npostulate that a wider response range may be due to the ability of some receptors to form\nclusters (for more detail, see Section 5).\nIn 1997, Barkai and Leibler (1997) developed a model using a single receptor species\nwhich included the effects of phosphorylation and methylation on the receptors, but not\nphosphotransfer from CheAP to CheY or CheB. As shown in Fig. 8, receptor methylation\nwas assumed to be by CheR and demethylation by CheBP , which only acted on active\nreceptors. As with previous models, the receptors existed in either an attractant-bound or\n1536 Tindall et al.\nFig. 8 (a) Schematic of the adaptation model of Barkai and Leibler (1997) which exhibits perfect adap-\ntation and is robust for a large range of parameter values.

They were able to show\nthat the model exhibited perfect adaptation and was robust for a wide range of parameter\nvalues. This latter result was important for this was the first model of perfect adaptation\nthat showed robustness over a wide range of parameter values. Yi et al. (2000) stated that\nrobustness was an inherent characteristic of an integral feedback control system, com-\nmonly observed in engineering systems, and showed that the model of Barkai and Leibler\ncould be written in a form analogous to such a system. Hence, they argued, it was not\nsurprising that the Barkai and Leibler model exhibited robustness. Furthermore, this work\nshowed that the biological system operates like many man-made engineering systems,\ne.g., amplifiers.\nMethylation-free adaptation has been the subject of work undertaken by Almogy et\nal. (2001). They considered modeling the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation path-\nway within E. coli, but did not include receptor modification. Following experimental\nresults reported by Wang and Matsumura (1997) they assumed either active CheZ or a\ncomplex formed of CheAs 2 and CheZ (CheAs\u2013CheZ) dephosphorylated CheYP , the lat-\nter more active than the former. Their model exhibits adaptation in the case where both\nCheZ and CheAs\u2013CheZ dephosphorylate CheYP , but not when either acts individually.\nThe model also exhibits robustness. One important feature of the model is the assumption\nthat CheA molecules may dissociate preferentially from active receptors and associate\nwith inactive ones. Interestingly, while both concentrations of CheYP and CheZ show\n2CheAs (the subscript \u201cs\u201d denotes short) is a truncated version of CheA only found in species with CheZ\nas the CheYP phosphatase. It is expressed from an internal start site in CheA producing a protein lacking\nthe histidine phosphorylation site, but containing all other CheA domains.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1537\nalmost perfect adaptation, the concentration of CheAs\u2013CheZ does not, tending instead to\na different steady-state value than that of the initial value. Almogy et al. (2001) note that\nmethylation dependent or independent adaptation processes do not alone give perfect and\nrobust adaptation, but combinations of them do. This, they argue, is the overall result of\nthe interaction between the regulatory mechanisms seeking to adapt due to changes in one\nanother.\nMore recent work by Mello and Tu (2003a) has modeled the effect of attractant binding\nthrough to the phosphorylation of CheY. The authors derive a set of governing ODEs by\napplying the law of mass action to the known reactions. Both attractant-bound and free\nreceptors may undergo up to n of levels of methylation and demethylation, although the\nmodel analysis considers only a total of five states (one unmethylated, four methylated).\nFrom both model results and further analysis, Mello and Tu (2003a) define six conditions\nfor perfect adaptation.\n1. Attractant binding occurs on a faster timescale than methylation\/de-methylation and\nphosphorylation\/dephosphorylation. Thus, the attractant binding reaction can be as-\nsumed to be in quasi-equilibrium.\n2. The association rates for methylation and demethylation, by CheR and CheBP , respec-\ntively, are linearly related to the receptor activity and are zero for the unmethylated and\nthe fourth methylation states. The dissociation rates3 are independent of the receptor\nstate, either bound or unbound.\n3. The receptor activity of the unmethylated and fourth methylated receptors is indepen-\ndent of the receptor state.\n4. The ratio of the rate of methylation for the nth methylation state by CheR to that of the\n(n + 1)th de-methylation rate by CheBP is independent of the methylation state.\n5. The rate of phosphorylation by CheA of CheB and CheY is proportional to the rate of\nCheA autophosphorylation.\n6.

They find that violating conditions (5) and (6)\nhas little effect on adaptation, violating condition (4) leads to the largest deviation away\nfrom perfect adaptation, deviation away from perfect adaptation increases with increasing\ndifference in activity of the zeroth and fully methylated receptor for condition (3) and\n3In a reaction of the form A+B\nk+\n\u0002\nk\u2212\nC, the dissociation constant is given by K = k\u2212\nk+ .

A large\ndissociation constant means the opposite, i.e., C breaks down more quickly than it is formed.\n1538 Tindall et al.\n10\u201315% deviation away from adaptation occurs when condition (2) is violated. Violation\nof condition (1) is considered to be unrealistic given experimental evidence. By incor-\nporating receptor methylation governed by CheR and CheBP as well as certain aspects\nof the phosphorylation cascade, the results in this model provide a clear and comprehen-\nsive check-list of conditions which are required in order for the signaling pathway within\nE. coli to exhibit robust adaptation.\n4. Modeling the phosphorylation cascade\nIncreasing experimental knowledge of the phosphorylation cascade within E. coli, partic-\nularly during the 1990s, led a number of investigators to model the cascade.\nBray et al. (1993) were the first to produce a mathematical model, called BCT, of the\nphosphorylation cascade. As they note, their work is an extension of Block et al. (1982,\n1983). The model extensions included incorporating the motor\u2013CheYP interaction and\nthe effects of pausing between tumbling and swimming (the stationary motor case). The\nauthors undertook numerical simulations of their ODE model of the phosphorylation re-\nactions, but excluded receptor methylation. Autophosphorylation of CheA was considered\nto be governed by a Michaelis\u2013Menten reaction, while phosphotransfer was governed by\na first order reaction and dephosphorylation was assumed to be linear. Motor bias was\nconsidered to be dependent upon the number of CheYP molecules which bind to the mo-\ntor. The model was populated with data from the experimental literature and considered\nthe motor response to step changes in aspartate (attractant) and nickel (repellent). Much\nof the model analysis attempted to reproduce the results of mutant experiments, the model\nresults agreeing well with experimental evidence. However, the model was unable to re-\nproduce the gain reported by Segall et al. (1986) and did not exhibit adaptation.\nIn 1997 Spiro and coworkers (Spiro et al., 1997; Spiro, 1997) sought to incorporate\nthe effects of attractant binding, methylation, phosphorylation, and motor bias into a sin-\ngle model. Their model, as shown in Fig. 9, accounted for a total of three methylation\nstates, the rate of phosphorylation increasing with each state. The methylation reaction\nwas assumed to obey Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics, given the saturating effect of CheR on\nthe receptors, while demethylation was described by first order reaction kinetics. While\nit was further assumed that the rate of demethylation for both attractant-bound and un-\nbound receptors remains the same, the rate of methylation for attractant-bound receptors\nis much greater than for unbound receptors. While the Spiro et al. model was able to show\nadaptation, corresponding to various levels of attractant, it could not reproduce the exper-\nimentally reported sensitivity or gain, where gain was defined as g = \u2212db\/d(lnp), with\nb being the motor bias and p the rate of CheY phosphorylation. The authors do hypothe-\nsize that cooperation between certain elements in the biochemical pathway, e.g., binding\nof CheYP to the motor and CheZ activity, could be enough to obtain the desired gain\nobserved experimentally.\nThe effect of variation in the concentration of each intracellular protein on the over-\nall concentration of CheYP was the subject of work by the Bray group (Levin et al.,\n1998). This work was motivated by the observations of the Koshland group (Spudich and\nKoshland, 1976) who observed variational differences in the response of a cloned popu-\nlation of E. coli to attractant. At the time, they hypothesized that such a variation could\nbe due to stochastic variation in a small number of molecules, but further investigation\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1539\nFig. 9 The model of Spiro et al. (1997) which incorporates attractant binding, methylation and phos-\nphorylation. Here Ti (i = 2,3,4) represents the concentration of receptor complex (MCP\u2013CheA\u2013CheW)\nin the ith methylation state, LTi represents an attractant-bound receptor, TiP a phosphorylated receptor\ncomplex and LTiP an attractant-bound phosphorylated receptor complex. Methylation is governed by\nMichaelis\u2013Menten kinetics and is assumed to be more rapid when the receptors are phosphorylated than\nwhen they are not. Figure adapted from Spiro et al. (1997).\nwas not possible given the lack of detail on the biochemical work. Levin et al. consid-\nered the effect that both individual and collective protein variation (Tar, CheA, CheW,\nCheBP , CheR, CheY, CheYP ) has on the CheYP concentration. They developed two\nmodels which extended the early work of Bray and Bourret (1995) (see Section 5) to\ninclude the adaptation reactions of CheR and CheBP . The first, the \u201cfine-tuned model,\u201d\nincorporates a similar adaptation mechanism as proposed by Segel and Goldbeter (1986).\nThe second, the \u201crobust model\u201d, includes receptor state kinetics as detailed by Asakura\nand Honda (1984) and methylation as described by Barkai and Leibler (1997). Individual\nprotein variation effects show that increasing Tar, CheW, or CheA concentrations cause\nthe CheYP concentration to pass through a maximum, while increases in CheR or CheY\nresult in rising levels of CheYP and increases in CheB or CheZ the reverse. The refined\nmodel does not exhibit adaptation of CheYP , but the robust model does. Noting that pro-\ntein concentration in eukaryotic cells can vary by a standard deviation of as much as 10%\nof the mean in any one population (Darzynkiewicz et al., 1982; Crissman et al., 1985),\nLevin et al. (1998) show that the spread in CheYP concentration increases with the vari-\nance in protein concentration. The model shows that differences in bacterial behavior are,\ntherefore, possible if the standard deviation of the mean in concentration is approximately\n10%. The variation in CheYP concentration is shown to be reduced for mutants lacking\nCheR and CheB or Tar, CheW, and CheA, given the lack of receptor modification and\nreceptor complexes, respectively.\nThe Bray group (Morton-Firth and Bray, 1998) also considered a stochastic approach\nto modeling the intracellular signaling pathway. Their approach was motivated by the in-\nability of previous deterministic models to reproduce the reported stochastic behavior of\nmotor switching as reported by Block et al. (1982, 1983) and Eisenbach (1990), and was\nbased on the two models of Asakura and Honda (1984) and Barkai and Leibler (1997).\n1540 Tindall et al.\nThe developed stochastic simulation programme StochSim considers individual protein\nmolecules and the interactions which occur between them. The program chooses two\nmolecules at random, considers the likelihood of interaction between them and assigns a\nreaction rate, randomly chosen from a predefined probability density distribution specific\nto the respective reaction, should the reaction be deemed to take place. StochSim can also\naccount for both uni- and bi-molecular reactions as well as for molecules in various dif-\nferent states, e.g., attractant-bound or unbound receptors. Morton-Firth and Bray (1998)\napplied StochSim to the methylation and phosphotransfer reactions governing bacterial\nchemotaxis, where the resulting bias in terms of CheYP was defined by a Hill function\nsimilar to that of Eq. (2). They found that the concentration of CheYP fluctuated around\nthe deterministically calculated values, even when the system was in a steady-state, the\nfluctuations decreasing with increasing number of molecules. The length of the fluctu-\nations (\u223c80.7 ms) was found to be less than that of clockwise and counter-clockwise\nrotations of the flagella (\u223c2.6 s). They concluded that while their model was unable to\naccount for motor switching, filtering of the CheYP fluctuations could produce tempo-\nral run and tumble distributions closer to the experimentally observed behavior, thereby\nraising the possibility that the flagellar motors may filter the CheYP signal.\nRecent work by Rao et al. (2004b) has focused on comparing the intracellular signaling\npathway of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). B. subtilis has a similar intracellular\npathway to E. coli but, importantly, has a number of \u201cextra\u201d chemotaxis signaling proteins\n(Ches), namely, CheC and CheD, localized to the receptors and responsible for negative\nand positive receptor methylation, respectively, and CheV, which is predicted to down-\nregulate receptor activity by impeding CheW function. Rao et al. (2004b) modeled the\nintracellular pathway of E. coli by combining the two-state model of Barkai and Leibler\n(1997) with the phosphorylation cascade model proposed by Sourjik and Berg (2002a),\nthe latter extended to include the phosphorylation of CheB. The B. subtilis pathway was\nmodeled on a variation of the E. coli pathway in which receptors were considered to\nexist in either an active, inactive, weakly active, or weakly inactive state. Results from the\ntwo models showed that both E. coli and B. subtilis can adapt to external stimuli and the\nrespective pathways are robust, a somewhat unsurprising result given the model is based\nupon that of Barkai and Leibler (1997). B. subtilis was found to be no more sensitive than\nE. coli to changes in attractant concentration. Rao et al. (2004b) also showed that deletion\nof CheR and\/or CheB (methylation independent chemotaxis) in B. subtilis still led to\noscillations in CheYP due to the presence of the CheV and CheY feedback loops. From\nthis result, they hypothesized that the CheY pathway provides adaptation and methylation\nwas later added (as an evolutionary step) to provide a more robust, adaptive pathway in B.\nsubtilis. In all, whilst both species of bacteria have related intracellular signaling pathways\nit is unclear why B. subtilis is apparently far more robust than E. coli.\n5. Sensitivity and gain\u2014the role of receptor clustering\nSurprisingly, while many of the models detailed in the previous sections have increased\nour understanding of the role of methylation and phosphotransfer in respect of bacterial\nexcitation and adaptation, they repeatedly fail to reproduce the experimentally observed\nsensitivity and gain (Segall et al., 1986; Sourjik and Berg, 2002b). In more recent years,\nexperiments have shown that receptor clustering is a possible mechanism for explaining\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1541\nthis sensitivity and gain. Mathematical models have played an important role in assessing\nthe plausibility of such a mechanism, the details of which are discussed in this section.\n5.1. Early work\nWork by Bray and Bourret (1995) on receptor biochemistry sought to elucidate the bind-\ning steps involved in the formation of the Tar\u2013CheW\u2013CheA complex (denoted TTWWAA\nfor short, where CheW is a monomer and CheA is a dimer), receptor complex. By consid-\nering an ODE network model of the various formations that the complex could assume,\nthey found from a total of ten possible complexes that the smallest working reaction net-\nwork consisted of six complexes. This receptor formation model was then coupled to their\n1993 phosphorylation model (Bray et al., 1993) to investigate how differences in cor-\nresponding receptor complex formation affected the phosphorylation rate of CheY, and\nhence the respective motor bias. By considering seven, ten, and twelve reaction networks,\nBray and Bourret (1995) showed the bias was sensitive to the concentrations of Tar, CheW\nand CheA and the bias was lowest when the concentration of the complex TTWWAA was\nat a maximum. All of the networks showed that the bias differed from one only over small\nchanges in the concentration of CheW. Bray and Bourret (1995) noted that the binding\nconstants for all of the receptor forming networks were three to four orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the experimentally determined values. Fixing the rates at their experimental\nlevels failed to produce the expected bias.\nThe work of Bray et al. (1998) made an important contribution in understanding the\nrole receptor clustering may play in providing a bacterium with the ability to sense small\nchanges in its extracellular environment. They hypothesized that receptors do not work\nindividually, but collectively. Although receptor clustering had been demonstrated exper-\nimentally as early as 1993 (Maddock and Shapiro, 1993) Bray et al. (1998) provided a\ntheoretical interpretation of the effect such clustering may have on the sensitivity and\nresponse of a bacterial system. By considering each receptor as a discrete entity, which\nexisted in either an attractant-bound or unbound state (the latter being more active than\nthe former), they assumed that the inactivation of a single receptor caused a number of\nits neighbors to become inactive. Thus, the inactivation of a single receptor is magnified\nand can inhibit the phosphorylation cascade to the flagellum. By considering an array\nof 2,000 receptors, Bray et al. (1998) showed a number of important results. Firstly, the\nability of the receptor network to respond to attractant decreased as the number of re-\nceptors which were inactivated by binding increased. This is a result of the majority of\nunbound receptors within the network assuming the reduced activity of the bound state.\nHence, sensitivity increases, but with a loss in attractant range to which the bacteria could\nrespond. The solution to this is for the bacteria to adapt, thereby freeing receptors to re-\nspond to further changes in attractant concentration. Bray et al. (1998) further showed\nthat the best bacterial response (a range of five orders of magnitude) is achieved when\nreceptor clustering is maximized at low attractant concentration and minimized at high\nconcentrations.\n5.2. The Ising model approach\nFollowing the work of Bray et al. (1998), an increasing number of models, using differ-\nent modeling approaches, have sought to elucidate the effect of receptor coupling on the\n1542 Tindall et al.\nFig. 10 A schematic representation of the Ising model applied to receptor\u2013receptor interactions on a\ntwo-dimensional lattice array. Receptors exist in either an inactive (patterned box) or active state (clear\nbox) and can flip between them randomly (thermal fluctuations). The binding of an attractant molecule\ninactivates the bound receptor and surrounding receptors become inactive dependent upon the coupling\nstrength between them. The four cases above show: significant coupling (middle left), some coupling\n(upper right), no coupling (bottom right) and random thermal fluctuations (far lower right). Note that\nattractant-bound receptors (denoted by a star) are in this case inactive, but for diagrammatic purposes are\nnot shaded.\nbacterial response. A number of authors (Shi and Duke, 1998; Duke and Bray, 1999; Shi,\n2000, 2001, 2002) have applied the Ising model (Toda et al., 1983) to study receptor\u2013\nreceptor interactions and the effect of attractant binding on the activity of a receptor array.\nThe Ising model is a statistical mechanics description of how an array of particles, for\ninstance electrons, behave when a magnetic field is applied to them. Most importantly it\nallows for a description of particle coupling, i.e., the effect of the state of one particle\nbeing allowed to change the state of neighboring particles, dependent upon the strength\nof a coupling energy.\nThe Ising model is, therefore, an appropriate analog of receptor\u2013receptor coupling as\nshown in Fig. 10; the average magnetization of a lattice of particles corresponds to the\nactivity of the receptor array and the strength of the local magnetic field represents the at-\ntractant concentration. The receptors exist in either one of two states (commonly denoted\ni = \u00b11) between which they flip. The energy of the array is defined by a Hamiltonian\nH(t) = \u2212\n\u2211\n\u3008ij \u3009\nJijSiSj \u2212\n\u2211\ni\nBi(t)Si, (3)\nwhere Si and Sj represent the spin of the ith and j th particles (in this case, the ith and j th\nreceptor dimers), respectively, Jij is the coupling strength between them (generally taken\nto be constant) and Bi(t) is the strength of the local magnetic field (in this case attrac-\ntant concentration). In the absence of attractant binding (the applied magnetic field), the\nreceptors are free to flip randomly between their states. These are thermal fluctuations or\nnoise. Given the large difference in timescales of attractant binding, phosphorylation, and\nadaptation, these fluctuations can be considered to be in quasi-equilibrium. Ising models\nhave also been used to describe receptor\u2013receptor interactions in other cellular systems\n(Guo and Levine, 1999, 2000).\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1543\nShi and Duke (1998) were the first to apply the Ising model to receptor\u2013receptor inter-\nactions in bacterial chemotaxis. Using mean-field analysis and considering various limits\nof the thermal fluctuation, their work showed that the sensitivity of the receptor array\ndepended greatly on the strength of the receptor\u2013receptor coupling, but less so on the\nstrength of the attractant binding. While adaptation is also included in the model by sim-\nply inducing a \u201cmagnetic field\u201d opposite to that induced by attractant binding, it is not\nstudied in detail. Shi and Duke (1998) note that receptor\u2013receptor coupling enhances the\nsensitivity of the bacterium in detecting attractant gradient changes.\nDuke and Bray (1999) undertook Monte Carlo simulations of the model of Shi and\nDuke (1998) using an array of 50 \u00d7 50 receptors. Here, each receptor was coupled to its\nfour nearest neighbors and the paper considered the array response to varying levels of\nattractant over differing timescales. Results showed that the receptor array could detect a\nrelative change in attractant concentration over five orders of magnitude. A 30% reduction\nin signal is achieved when doubling the attractant concentration over four orders of mag-\nnitude, in comparison to 10% for an uncoupled array of receptors. Duke and Bray (1999)\nargued that a linear system, i.e., one in which the receptors are uncoupled, can not give\nthe required sensitivity at high concentrations given the difference in coupling energies\nis too large and can not be accommodated without affecting the response at lower lev-\nels of concentration. However, in the nonlinear coupled model, the number of receptors\nwhich have been modified by methylation and are attractant-bound cancel each other out\nand the receptors are not biased toward an active or inactive state. They are thus free to\nbe influenced by further localized receptor coupling at higher attractant concentrations.\nIt was further noted that the geometry of the array is important\u2014the receptors need to\nbe arranged in a well-ordered lattice given the sensitivity of the response to the coupling\nenergy.\nShi (2000) later extended this earlier work (Shi and Duke, 1998) by incorporating the\neffects of CheBP and CheR. Here, an adaptive Ising model was used in which a source\nof negative feedback from the receptor system, in this case the effects of methylation by\nCheR and demethylation by CheBP , was fed back into the output from the system (the\nphosphorylation of CheAP ). Attractant binding to the receptors is assumed to be the input.\nIn effect, this adds a second governing equation to Eq. (3)\ndSi\ndt\n= \u2212\u03c3Si(t \u2212 tr ), (4)\nwhere tr is the delay time, the sum of the time taken for demethylation and phosphoryl\ntransfer from CheAP to CheB. Given the difference in timescales of attractant binding,\nphosphorylation, and adaptation, Shi (2000) coarse-grained the governing Hamiltonian\nand showed that the feedback effect of CheR and CheBP was sufficient to naturally at-\ntenuate the receptor activity back to zero following an initial stimulus, i.e., perfect adap-\ntation. They also noted that the feedback relaxed certain conditions on the strength of the\nreceptor\u2013receptor coupling, thus making the model more robust. The model also remained\nsensitive to repeated changes in the attractant concentration.\nShi later considered (Shi, 2001) how the models presented in Shi and Duke (1998) and\nShi (2000) could be compared with experimental findings. He compared theoretical pre-\ndictions of the ratio of attractant binding to receptor\u2013receptor interactions, the adaptation\ntime, and the ratio of pre- versus post-stimulus CheA phosphorylation with experimental\n1544 Tindall et al.\nevidence and found that all agreed well with experiment. Thus, he argued, the statistical\nmechanics approach adopted by Shi and Duke (1998) and Shi (2000) provides a good\nand plausible description of receptor\u2013receptor interactions. It was noted that unlike Hill\nfunctions, where the physical meaning of non-integer values of the Hill coefficient (Mur-\nray, 1993) are unclear, each of the expressions obtained from this statistical mechanics\napproach are physically descriptive.\nThe effect of receptor movement on the receptor array activity was considered in Shi\n(2002). Using mean-field analysis, Shi (2002) obtained expressions for the receptor ar-\nray activity and the average number of receptors. Monte Carlo simulations showed that\nclustering is important in order for there to be interactions amongst the receptors, but that\nthe correlation amongst receptors died off exponentially quickly in terms of interactions\nwith non-nearest neighboring receptors, i.e., nearby receptors are closely correlated and\nthose at a distance are not. These results were unaffected by the receptor\u2013receptor cou-\npling strength and the fraction of attractant-bound receptors. It was noted that receptors in\nthe same state clustered together to decrease the total energy of the system, and thus Shi\n(2002) argued it is the receptor state, rather than whether they are attractant-bound or not,\nwhich is most likely to affect the interaction between receptors.\n5.3. Recent modeling work\nThe Bray group (Morton-Firth et al., 1999) extended the work of Barkai and Leibler\n(1997) by modeling the Tar receptor and the related methylating and phosphorylating re-\nactions using StochSim (Morton-Firth and Bray, 1998; Nov\u00e8re and Shimizu, 2001). Like\nBarkai and Leibler (1997), Morton-Firth and Bray (1998) assumed that only active re-\nceptors were demethylated by CheBP . Early simulations showed that if CheR is active at\nsaturation then adaptation cannot be exact, i.e., there is a 6\u20137% variation in post- versus\npre-stimulus levels of CheYP . They also noted that the experimentally determined con-\ncentration of CheR was not high enough for the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics assumption\nof the substrate being in excess of the enzyme to hold for a receptor\u2013CheR interaction.\nIt was thus assumed that CheR only affects inactive receptors, which also meets the re-\nquirement that methylation is activity dependent. Whilst model results for the duration of\nbacterial response agree well with experimental data over four orders of magnitude, the\nmodel fails to show sensitivity at low aspartate concentrations and shows a 2% error in the\npre- versus post-stimulus levels of CheYP . The adaptation error was found to arise from:\n(1) the level of activation of the receptor complex (receptors bound with either CheB or\nCheR can not bind CheR or CheB, respectively, thus a number of inaccessible receptors\nis created. This means the rates of methylation and demethylation are not exactly propor-\ntional to the number of active and inactive receptors, and hence any error in adaptation\nwill increase with increasing attractant concentration); and (2) deviations in the rate of\nCheY phosphorylation, due to differences in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of\nactive and inactive receptor complexes.\nMorton-Firth et al. (1999) also considered the effect of aspartate binding on methyla-\ntion of the Tar and Tsr receptors. As expected, methylation of the Tar receptor increased\nwith aspartate binding, but unexpectedly decreased in the case of the Tsr receptor. They\nnoted that aspartate binding to the Tar receptors lowers CheBP affinity for the Tar recep-\ntors such that it is released into the cytoplasm. The reduction in CheBP formation due to\nthe phosphotransfer from CheAP means the increase in CheBP occurs over a very short\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1545\ntimescale, the same timescale over which there is an observed decrease in the Tsr receptor\nmethylation. Analysis of whether methylation of Tar receptors occurs in a sequentially or-\ndered or independent (random) manner showed that ordered methylation is important for\nadaptation; the randomly methylated systems failed to adapt and showed a 50% deviation\nin pre- versus post-stimulus activity.\nLevin et al. (2002) used deterministic simulations and StochSim (Morton-Firth and\nBray, 1998; Nov\u00e8re and Shimizu, 2001) to simulate the diffusion and binding of CheR\nwithin a cluster of receptors. They devised a generalized \u201cdumbell\u201d model of enzyme-\nreceptor binding, whereby each end of the molecule contains a binding site separated by\na flexible chain. The probability of particle attachment was explored when either one or\nboth ends of the molecule were attached to a surface. A more detailed analysis of this\nsituation was recently provided by Windisch et al. (2006). The attachment and partial\ndetachment of the molecule from the surface meant it was able to wander across the\nreceptor surface, a process termed \u201cmolecular brachiation.\u201d Levin et al. (2002) noted that\nthis generalized model was analogous to CheR binding to and detaching from a receptor\ncluster and showed that when the dissociation constant is of the order of that observed\nexperimentally, the CheR molecules had sufficient time to both visit and methylate the\nreceptor sites. When receptor\u2013molecule association was increased to mimic binding to\na corresponding single high-affinity site, the delayed time meant fewer receptors were\nvisited and was not in agreement with experimental evidence. Levin et al. (2002) further\nnoted that CheB was likely to behave in a similar manner. However, the modeling could\nnot account for the effects of receptor size or shape and the likelihood of some receptors\nnot being able to bind CheR, i.e., Trg and Tap. They also noted that the dissociation\nconstant may vary with attractant binding; CheR preferentially methylates receptors that\ninactivate CheA while CheBP preferentially demethylates receptors that activate CheA.\nThis may also lead to the two enzymes excluding one another from different domains.\nBornhorst and Falke (2003) have addressed the issue of the inability of a two-state\nmodel of receptor modification to predict the experimentally observed changes in attrac-\ntant affinity for varying ranges of adaptation. The general two-state model describes re-\nceptors as existing in either an on- or off-state. The authors propose a model whereby\naltering the attractant affinity of the receptor off-state gives an appropriate fit to the exper-\nimental data. They conclude that this result produces a heterogenous off-state population\nof receptors and note that changes in attractant-receptor affinity for on-state receptors,\nmaximal kinase stimulation of either state, receptor\u2013receptor interactions, or the forma-\ntion of a receptor-kinase signaling complex do not provide adequate matches of model\noutput with experimental data.\nThe work of Shimizu et al. (2003) considered a spatially extended version of the\nStochSim algorithm coupled with an Ising type model of receptor\u2013receptor interactions.\nTheir model included a description of methylation and adaptation based upon the work\nof Barkai and Leibler (1997) in which receptors can be in up to five different methyla-\ntion states. Shimizu et al. (2003) examined the importance of the receptor array geometry\n(hexagonal, trigonal, or square) and size on the overall sensitivity, gain and signal-to-noise\nratio of the receptor array. They found that the array sensitivity increases up to a certain\nlattice size and gain is largest for trigonal lattice arrays, i.e., when the number of nearest\nneighbors is highest. However, increasing the interactions amongst receptors decreases\nthe signal-to-noise ratio, but increases the gain. Both the signal-to-noise ratio and gain\nare insensitive to the attractant concentration. Shimizu et al. (2003) chose the most stable\n1546 Tindall et al.\narray configuration, a square lattice, and showed that coupling amongst receptors gives a\nbetter comparison with experimental data (motor bias) than the uncoupled case. Gain is\nlarger for smaller changes in receptor occupancy when the receptors are coupled. Cou-\npling is also shown to be important in describing the observed overshoot phenomenon.\nThe uncoupled model can only produce overshoot in cases where the methylation and\ndemethylation levels are increased 100-fold, whereas overshoot is easily reproduced for\nonly small changes in methylation and demethylation in the coupled model. Coupling be-\ntween receptors was also predicted to generate spatial patterns of methylation in the two-\ndimensional array of receptors, something that would be impossible to test experimentally\nwith present techniques. Even with coupling there are still, as Shimizu et al. (2003) ob-\nserve, significant differences between the model and the experimentally reported gain.\nBray and Duke have summarized experimental evidence indicating that conforma-\ntional changes can propagate through protein lattices (Bray and Duke, 2004). They pro-\npose a statistical mechanics model, analogous to the Ising model, to consider the dynam-\nical propagation of conformational change within a ring of proteins (Duke et al., 2001).\nTheir model shows that conformational spread progresses over a number of steps, i.e., the\nring does not automatically switch between an \u201coff\u201d and \u201con\u201d state, but varying numbers\nof proteins become turned \u201con\u201d by propagation or \u201cdiffusion\u201d of a single signal through\nneighboring proteins.\nGoldman et al. (2004) undertook Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice gas model of\nprotein\u2013protein (receptor\u2013receptor) interactions with a defined two-dimensional lattice.\nTheir model considered the effects of geometry between the individual proteins, i.e.,\nthe bond angle, and also the overall geometry of the lattice array (trigonal, square, or\nhexagonal). They showed that protein clusters of a single species formed nonlinearly\nand the bonding and clustering of the proteins was spread heterogenously across the\ntwo-dimensional space. As with the previous Ising models (Shi and Duke, 1998; Duke\nand Bray, 1999), their work demonstrated that this clustering depended upon the local\nprotein concentration and the bond strength between each protein. This result was un-\naffected by the different lattice types. In the case of the two protein species within the\ntwo-dimensional lattice, changing the initial ratio between the two species affected the\nnumber of bonds formed, and thus the respective clustering. From this result, Goldman et\nal. (2004) were able to determine a maximum aggregation ratio.\nRecent work by a number of authors (Albert et al., 2004; Mello and Tu 2003b, 2005;\nMello et al., 2004; Rao et al., 2004a) has sought to elucidate the mechanisms responsible\nfor receptor interactions inferred by the work of Sourjik and Berg (2002b, 2004). Sourjik\nand Berg (2002b) studied the sensitivity of the chemotactic response, in particular focus-\ning on the role of CheR and CheBP . Their work suggested that signal amplification is\ndependent upon CheBP and the degree to which receptors are modified. They also noted\nthat receptor\u2013receptor interactions may provide an explanation for the observed sensitiv-\nity of the cell. In Sourjik and Berg (2004), they studied the effect on CheA activity that\nvariations in receptor concentrations (Tar and Tsr) had, both individually and together.\nThey noted that the activity of the cells containing both Tar and Tsr was greater than\ncould be explained by the activation of just one receptor type when either aspartate or ser-\nine was present. They inferred coupling between Tsr and Tar receptor clusters to explain\nthe observed activity.\nMello and Tu (2003b) and Mello et al. (2004) extended the Ising model to include a\ndescription of receptor methylation and demethylation. Their model does not include a\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1547\ndescription of CheR or CheBP , but assumes that receptors can occupy up to five different\nmethylation states. Following on from the work of Barkai and Leibler (1997), Mello and\nTu (2003b) and Mello et al. (2004) assumed that only inactive receptors could be methy-\nlated and active ones demethylated. Their initial work (Mello and Tu, 2003b) focused on\nreproducing the experimental results of Sourjik and Berg (2002b) for both mutant (CheR\nand CheB deleted) and wild type E. coli. Undertaking mean-field analysis of their model,\nthey showed that mutant results agreed well with the experimental data. However, match-\ning the wild-type data required different parameters and this, the authors noted, was most\nlikely due to the multiple methylation levels of the wild-type bacteria versus the single\nmethylation levels of the mutants. Mello and Tu (2003b) noted that the interesting re-\nsult of Sourjik and Berg (2002b) on Tsr receptor activity at concentration levels below\nwhich such receptors are generally active can be explained by strong coupling between\nTar and Tsr receptors and the associated methylation of each. Analysis of the sensitiv-\nity and gain showed that the model could only give a 20-fold increase in gain versus the\n36-fold increase reported by Sourjik and Berg (2002b). It was also shown that attractant\nbinding is dependent upon receptor activity; a result of methylation and the assumption\nthat attractant can only bind active receptors and release from inactive ones.\nMello and Tu (2003b) further extended their work in Mello et al. (2004) where they\nundertook both mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations of the model in which\nmultiple methylation states were allowed. An important finding of this later work was that\nreceptor coupling has a large effect on the activity of the array for differing methylation\nlevels. Stronger coupling leads to a steeper response versus attractant curve. In order to\nobtain the experimentally observed range of sensitivity across four orders of magnitude,\nMello et al. (2004) noted that the receptor-attractant dissociation constant must depend\nupon the methylation level of the receptors, although they do not provide explicit model\nexamples of this. The authors also addressed the issue of overshoot following adaptation\nand showed that it may be a result of signal amplification; a change in methylation for one\nreceptor is amplified by coupling amongst the receptors. It was further shown that model\nestimates using the mean-field analysis compared well with experimental data, and that\nnumerical solutions of the full model agreed with those of the mean-field analysis.\nThe recent work of Albert et al. (2004) has focused on an ODE model of receptor\n\u201cteam\u201d formation to explain the observed gain within E. coli. The authors argue that the\nIsing model approach to receptor clustering does not allow the form of the interaction\nbetween receptors to be specified, and thus experimental justification is difficult. Citing\nthe experimental work of Ames et al. (2002) and Kim et al. (2002), Albert et al. (2004)\nassume that attractant binding destabilizes teams of receptor dimers within the receptor\nclusters. The groups consist of either individual receptor units (homodimers), two dimers\n(two-fold dimers) or three dimers (trimers of dimers). The trimers of dimers are assumed\nto form stable complexes when coupled with CheA and CheW and are assumed to be\nthe model output which drives autophosphorylation of CheA. Albert et al. (2004) con-\nstruct a network diagram of the respective pathways which form the different possible\nattractant-bound and unbound receptor dimer teams. The model is only valid for the short\ntimescale of attractant binding, and thus does not include a description of methylation\nor the phosphorylation cascade. Model results show good qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental work of Li and Weis (2000), Bornhorst and Falke (2001), Levit and Stock\n(2002) and Sourjik and Berg (2002b). Importantly, the theoretically determined Hill co-\nefficients for the description of kinase activity as a function of attractant concentration\n1548 Tindall et al.\nare more closely aligned with the experimentally observed range. In order to explain the\nwork of Sourjik and Berg (2002b), with respect to the receptor activity of Tar and Tsr, Al-\nbert et al. (2004) extend their model to differentiate between the two receptors, but allow\nreceptor team interactions. They note that the analysis of a network of trimers of dimers\nis unduly complicated, and hence only consider up to two-fold receptor dimer formation.\nModel comparison with the experimentally observed sensitivity of CheR\u2013CheB mutants\nand wild-type bacteria in Sourjik and Berg (2002b) shows good agreement.\nRao et al. (2004a) considered a two-state allosteric model of receptor clustering based\non the work of Monod et al. (1965) and Shimizu et al. (2000). Their model focuses on\ndescribing the activity of receptor complexes (trimers of dimers) and the activity between\nthem. The receptors are assumed to exist in either a relaxed or tense (active) state, the\nmore stable state assisted by the association of CheW and CheA with the receptor clus-\nters. Receptor methylation increases the level of receptor activity whilst attractant binding\nincreases the likelihood of destabilizing the complexes, returning the complexes to the\nrelaxed state. Rao et al. (2004a) note that attractant sensitivity is determined by the co-\noperative interaction between the receptor complexes and shows that the lowest methyla-\ntion state has the greatest effect on increasing the number of active receptors. They model\nreceptor clustering on a hexagonal lattice by using the Metropolis algorithm approach of\nBray and Duke (2004) and assume that the receptor\u2013receptor signaling is localized. Rao\net al. (2004a) compared their model results with those of Sourjik and Berg (2002b) for\nmixed receptor types: two Tar and one Tsr receptor; and one Tar and two Tsr receptors.\nThey found that both configurations fit well with the experimental data and further noted\nthat their results agreed well with those of Mello and Tu (2003b). Other findings were that\nincreased receptor methylation stabilizes the complexes (a result of the reduced attractant\naffinity for higher methylated receptors), and receptor cluster size is determined by the\nlocal concentration of receptor type, CheW and CheA.\nA number of recent models (Mello and Tu, 2005; Skoge et al., 2006; Endres and\nWingreen, 2006) have used the Monod\u2013Wyman\u2013Changeux (MWC) (Monod et al., 1965)\nmodel to understand receptor\u2013receptor interactions. The MWC model accounts for clus-\nters of receptor types rather than the interaction between individual receptors, thus details\non the interaction between individual receptors is not required. The MWC model requires\ndefining an energy Hamiltonian, where each receptor state, e.g., active or inactive, has\na different corresponding energy level. Mello and Tu (2005) used the MWC model to\nreproduce the response of mutant and wild-type bacteria to serine and methyl-aspartate\nas reported by Sourjik and Berg (2004). Their model included a description of Tar and\nTsr receptors and they found it could account for each of the fourteen response curves\nreported by Sourjik and Berg (2004). The authors also explored the response when a mix-\nture of serine and methyl-aspartate is applied to the receptor cluster. They found that when\nboth attractants are present one suppresses the response of the receptor cluster to the other\nattractant. Furthermore, the presence of one attractant increases the sensitivity of the re-\nceptor cluster to the other attractant. The receptor response to the two attractants is not\nadditive.\nRecent work by Skoge et al. (2006) has compared model predictions of one- and two-\ndimensional Ising models and those of the MWC model with the experimental results\nof Sourjik and Berg (2002b, 2004). They show that the MWC model provides a better\nprediction of the differing responses of wild-type, CheR mutant and CheR\u2013CheB mu-\ntant strains to attractant concentration than do Ising models. Given the dependency of the\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1549\nMWC on the number of receptors in either an on- or off-state, the authors infer that clus-\ntering of each type of receptor is required in order to reproduce the observed experimental\ndifferences in the mutant and wild-type bacteria. The importance of differing attractant\ndissociation constants for receptors in either state is discussed as is the sensitivity at low\nattractant concentrations.\nEndres and Wingreen (2006) have also applied the MWC model to receptor clustering.\nThe experimental basis for their work is that of Li and Hazelbauer (2005) who showed that\nCheR and CheBP act on groups of five to seven receptors, thus forming \u201cassistance neigh-\nborhoods.\u201d Endres and Wingreen (2006) adopt the adaptation model of Barkai and Leibler\n(1997) in allowing CheR to only methylate inactive receptors and CheBP to demethylate\nactive ones (see Section 6) and model receptor groups consisting of six receptors. Both\nTar and Tsr receptors, and their response to asparate and serine, respectively, are included\nin the model. Endres and Wingreen (2006) show that the resultant mixed cluster types are\nboth highly sensitive and exhibit the experimentally observed adaptation response, with-\nout the need for changing attractant-binding affinities. They note two different adaptation\nresponses at high attractant concentrations: (i) cessation of receptor response due to re-\nceptor saturation by the attractant; or (ii) full receptor methylation which causes them to\nstop adapting. By modeling separate clusters of both Tar and Tsr receptors, they argue that\neven at high aspartate concentrations when the Tar receptors are fully methylated, and thus\nunable to sense changes in attractant concentration, the low-affinity binding of asparate\nto Tsr means there are still enough free receptor sites to initiate receptor signaling. Thus,\nthe bacterium can still respond to attractant concentration changes.\n6. The role of methylation in intracellular signaling\nThe models which have included a biochemical description of methylation, i.e., involv-\ning CheR and\/or CheBP , will be described briefly give its importance in adaptation. The\nmodel descriptions of Barkai and Leibler (1997), Spiro et al. (1997), Morton-Firth and\nBray (1998) and Mello and Tu (2003a) have made assumptions regarding whether CheR\nand CheBP affect active or inactive receptors as detailed in Table 1. Experiments have\nnot been done to determine whether either protein is solely targeting receptors in either\nstate or receptors in both states. While other models have included general descriptions of\nmethylation or covalent modification (Asakura and Honda, 1984; Hauri and Ross, 1995),\nthey have not explicitly included descriptions of the methylating and demethylating pro-\nteins and their effect on differing receptor activity.\nTable 1 A comparison of models which have made different assumptions regarding the methylation and\ndemethylation of active or inactive receptors. \u201cAll\u201d here indicates that all receptors, irrespective of whether\nthey are active or inactive, are affected by either CheR or CheBP as indicated\nReference CheR CheBP\nInactive All Active All\nBarkai and Leibler (1997) \u221a \u221a\nSpiro et al. (1997) \u221a \u221a\nMello and Tu (2003a) \u221a \u221a\nMorton-Firth and Bray (1998) \u221a \u221a\n1550 Tindall et al.\nTable 1 shows that the model of Barkai and Leibler (1997) is the most general and\nplaces the least restrictions on the mechanism of adaptation required for robustness. The\nmore specific models of Mello and Tu (2003a) and Spiro et al. (1997) specify that methy-\nlation and demethylation occur in a sequential order which, as noted by Asakura and\nHonda (1984), is required for adaptation. It is further noted that Morton-Firth et al. (1999),\nYi et al. (2000) and Mello and Tu (2003a) show that perfect adaptation is only possible if\nthe methylation and demethylation rates depend upon receptor activity.\nEach of the papers discussed here has used different models of the methylation path-\nway, encompassing various modeling approaches and has focused on slightly different\naspects of methylation and demethylation. The analysis and reported outcome of each\nmodel differ, making a detailed and meaningful comparison difficult.\n7. Spatial modeling of the intracellular signaling cascade\nApart from the work of Lipkow et al. (2005), no other mathematical modeling work on\nintracellular signaling has considered the importance of spatial localization and diffusion\nof the cytoplasmic proteins on network performance. Lipkow et al. (2005) focused on\nthe distribution and diffusion of CheY, CheYP , and CheZ in a single E. coli cell. Three-\ndimensional stochastic simulations of individual protein molecules were undertaken using\nthe Smoldyn program based on Smoluchowski dynamics (Andrews and Bray, 2004). In\nrespect of CheZ localization, Lipkow et al. (2005) showed that when the protein is re-\nstricted to the ends of the cell, where the receptors and high concentrations of CheAP\nare found, the concentration of CheYP is constant throughout the cytoplasm. However,\nwhen CheZ is allowed to diffuse freely through the cytoplasm an exponential gradient in\nCheYP , highest at the anterior end, is seen across the length of the cell. Simulations show\nthat the average lifetime of a CheYP protein is 0.1 s, but this may vary depending on the\nspatial position of CheZ, i.e., whether at the poles or evenly distributed throughout the\ncytoplasm. Lipkow et al. (2005) also analyzed the effects of receptor-to-motor separation\nand macromolecular crowding. Analysis of motor position revealed that when CheA is\nphosphorylated at the anterior end, a wave of CheYP travels between the receptors and\nthe motors. To reproduce the effects of macromolecular crowding (anomalous diffusion),\nLipkow et al. (2005) introduced arrays of impenetrable blocks within the cytoplasm. This\nincreased the steepness in the CheYP concentration gradient when CheZ is distributed\nevenly throughout the cytoplasm. Lipkow et al. (2005) hypothesize that this is due to\nretardation of diffusion of CheYP away from the poles of the cell.\nLipkow has recently extended her previous model to introduce the novel concept of\ndynamic protein localization (Lipkow, 2006), demonstrated with CheZ and CheYP . The\nwork notes that a variant of CheA (CheAs ) is important for the localization of CheZ near\nthe receptor poles. The model assumes that CheZ location is dependent upon the concen-\ntration of attractant or repellent. In the case of an attractant gradient, where a decrease in\nCheYP results, CheZ molecules are free to diffuse in the cytoplasm of the cell. When a\nrepellent is detected, leading to increased levels of CheYP , CheZ, and CheYP oligomer-\nize with CheAs at the poles. The clustering of CheZ leads to enhanced dephosphorylation\nof CheYP , thus introducing a negative feedback upon the concentration of CheYP within\nthe cell. Lipkow notes that this leads to a robust \u201csecond tier\u201d of adaptation; this feed-\nback system can explain the overshoot of CheYP levels in CheR\/CheB mutant bacteria,\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1551\ni.e., adaptation which is methylation independent as has been observed experimentally by\nStock et al. (1985).\n8. The physics of individual cell chemotaxis\nSince the work of Berg and Purcell (1977), which was based on physical arguments to\ndescribe how bacteria sensed their external environment and responded to it, a number of\npapers have focused on similar issues. We detail the work of these papers in this section.\nThe early work of Berg and Purcell (1977) focused on the physics of attractant particles\ninteracting with receptors on the bacterial surface. Berg and Purcell obtained estimates\nof the effective absorption by specific receptors, the effect of initial deflection from the\nsurface followed by secondary absorption, bacterial movement on uptake of attractant, the\neffects of possible local stirring by bacterial movement and the benefits which swimming\nimparts on the interactions between a bacterium and its environment. Their work showed\nthat swimming (using flagella) is highly useful in non-uniform environments of attractant.\nIf the attractant is spatially non-uniform, stirring of the bacterium\u2019s local medium as a\nmethod of increasing the likelihood of detecting attractant is too energy inefficient except\nif the medium viscosity is high. Energy expenditure is highly dependent upon the bacterial\nradius and calculations showed that receptors may only necessarily cover a small region\nof the membrane surface.\nStrong et al. (1998) and Bialek and Setayeshgar (2005) extended the work of Berg and\nPurcell (1977). Strong et al. (1998) considered the optimal bacterial strategy for E. coli\nwhen the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low or high. A high SNR means a bacterium can\nevaluate the chemotactic gradient in the direction it is swimming in a shorter time than\nany other processes it is undertaking. A low SNR means the bacterium needs to filter out\nbackground noise in order to determine the signal and also requires a threshold attractant\nlevel at which to respond. Strong et al. (1998) note that although the high SNR problem\nmay not necessarily be realistic it is more mathematically tractable in terms of possible\nsolutions. Estimates of the time spent tumbling and the tumble angle as a function of the\ntumbling time are derived. The low SNR problem is more difficult mathematically and the\nauthors note that by assuming: (i) completely disorientating tumbles are of finite duration\nand; (ii) instantaneous tumbles do not completely disorientate the bacteria, asymptotic\nsolutions to the filter behavior can be found for various timescales. The authors discuss\nways of comparing their theoretical predictions with experiment.\nThe work of Bialek and Setayeshgar (2005) focused on deriving an accurate limit to\nwhich bacterial receptors are able to respond to a change in concentration of signaling\nmolecules. Their work was motivated by the claim of Berg and Purcell (1977) that the\nbacterial ability to sense a change in the attractant gradient is independent of the size\nof the receptor cluster detecting the change and the assumptions underlying this finding.\nBialek and Setayeshgar (2005) show that a noise level can be defined which is independent\nof kinetic parameters and that there exists a minimum noise \u201cfloor\u201d due to diffusion of\nattractant molecules. Comparison with experiment shows that bacterial systems operate\nnear this theoretically derived limit of diffusive noise.\n1552 Tindall et al.\n9. Discussion and future directions\nMathematical modeling is a useful tool which can provide insight into often complex\nbiological problems. The case of bacterial chemotaxis is a good example. This review\nhas highlighted the development of mathematical models over the past thirty years that\nhave aided in our understanding of intracellular signaling within bacteria. This has in-\ncluded understanding the mechanisms responsible for providing the initial excitatory re-\nsponse, adaptation, sensitivity, and gain. Of particular note is the elucidation that receptor\u2013\nreceptor interactions can explain the observed sensitivity and gain of the system. Mathe-\nmatical modeling in this area has allowed a number of different hypotheses to be tested,\nusing various mathematical techniques, and where necessary, the model outcomes to be\nexamined experimentally. Such methodology is not uncommon in applied mathematical\nmodeling of real world phenomena: models based on current knowledge can be used to\ntest theoretical hypotheses without the need for often expensive experiments.\nThis overview has highlighted a number of characteristics which are inherent to a num-\nber of these models, in particular those which have focused on adaptation and modeling\nthe phosphorylation cascade. Detailed notes on each model discussed are given in Appen-\ndix A and an overview of model properties is provided in Appendix B.\nGeneral assumptions which have been made by a number of modelers include the\nfollowing.\n\u2022 Attractant is assumed to be in excess and binding is assumed to be rapid.\n\u2022 One of the most common receptor types to be modeled is the Tar receptor. This is not\nunexpected given that a large degree of the experimental literature has focused on the\nresponse of E. coli to asparate which is detected by this receptor. Tar is also one of the\nmost abundant receptors within the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\u2022 In models which have focused on adaptation and\/or the phosphorylation cascade, re-\nceptors are commonly modeled as complexes consisting of MCP, CheW, and CheA.\nThis is justified by the tight association of CheW and CheA to the MCP receptors.\n\u2022 Descriptions of motor bias. Given the limited detail available on the interaction of both\nCheYP and CheY with the cytoplasmic FliM end of the flagellar motors and that this\ninteraction may be quite complex, it has been a common, simplifying assumption of a\nnumber of authors that the fraction of time a motor spends spinning counter-clockwise\ncan be expressed in terms of CheYP by a Hill function (see Eq. (2)). Such relation-\nships are based upon experimental observations (Segall et al., 1986; Kuo and Koshland,\n1989).\nWhile these assumptions hold for a number of models, we note that the modeling\nwork highlighted here has in each case generally only focused on one aspect of the bac-\nterial system, for instance receptor clustering, the phosphorylation cascade, sensitivity,\netc. A range of different mathematical approaches have been used to tackle such issues.\nThese differences have meant comparison between all of the models presented in this re-\nview, and particularly a difference in reported outcomes, has not been straightforward,\ne.g., modeling methylation as discussed in Section 6. As such, we have attempted to draw\nas many general conclusions from the work reviewed here as is plausible.\nWhat is the future of mathematical modeling in helping to understand bacterial chemo-\ntaxis? In order to answer this question, we reflect upon the exact goal of understanding\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis I 1553\nTable 2 Known biological attributes of bacterial chemotactic systems.

Is it not to elucidate the mechanisms of sensing and mov-\ning in order that we may be able to predict the behavior of bacterial chemotactic systems\nin the environment? In order to meet this overall aim, the recent use of multiscale ap-\nproaches (Emonet et al., 2005; Erban and Othmer, 2004, 2005; Kreft et al., 1998) appears\na plausible way of integrating and understanding the effects of individual cell behavior on\nthe bacterial population macroscale. However, in order to do this, we note that no single\nmathematical model yet exists on the single cell scale to explain the full behavior exhib-\nited by an individual cell. This is not a failure of the modeling. Rather it is telling us that\nwe do not yet fully understand the system\u2014either there are key biological components\nstill to be discovered, or we are not correctly integrating the processes we are including.\nA fully comprehensive model would include receptor sensitivity, phosphotransfer, adap-\ntation, motor response, and appropriate gain and either the full single cell model or an\nappropriately reduced form would be used to inform the macroscale behavior.\nIt is also worthy of note that there exists a range of unanswered questions regarding\nsingle cell behavior. The spatial organization of proteins within the cytoplasmic domain\nplays an important, as yet unconfirmed, role in the signaling cascade. Protein diffusion and\nlocalization, in particular that of CheY, CheYP , and CheZ, as recently noted by the work\nof Lipkow (Lipkow et al., 2005; Lipkow, 2006), can have important consequences on\nthe overall behavior of the signaling system. Further investigation of protein localization\nwithin the cell is thus required.\nFurthermore, prokaryotes and eukaroytes are not simply well-stirred \u201cbags of fluid\u201d as\nis often assumed in modeling their intracellular signaling pathway. Instead, they may be\ndensely packed with, e.g., membrane, protein, or cytoskeletal filaments which may hinder\nprotein diffusion. Such delays may have important consequences for protein interactions,\n1554 Tindall et al.\nand thus affect the overall network response. In this case other modeling alternatives, for\ninstance anomalous diffusion (Metzler and Klafter, 2000), are worthy of investigation.\nA list of further issues include:\n1. modeling individual receptor types, apart from Tar (e.g., Tsr) on their own;\n2. modeling repellents and the bacterial response;\n3. modeling mixed receptor types, including Tar and Tsr, Tar and Trg and Tsr and Aer;\n4. modeling mixed concentrations of receptors and repellents with mixed families of re-\nceptor types;\n5. modeling attractants that do not use MCPs for signaling, e.g., the action of transporting\nPTS sugars causes an MCP independent metabolic change altering CheA activity; and\n6. does metabolic activity modify the bacterial response to attractant and repellent gradi-\nents?\nFor a more detailed list of outstanding issues in bacterial chemotaxis, the reader should\nconsult http:\/\/www.pdn.cam.ac.uk\/groups\/comp-cell\/Questions.html.\nWith the current, and ever growing biological knowledge of bacterial species and sys-\ntems in general, as detailed in Table 2, the likelihood that many of these questions will\nbe answered, with the assistance of appropriately formulated mathematical models, is an\never increasing one.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded (MJT and SLP) by a grant (BB\/C513350\/1) from the Biotech-\nnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), UK.
