Eschewing a \u2018developing\u2019\/\u2019developed\u2019 dichotomy it is \nnevertheless demonstrated that while terrorism has levelled risk across cities of the North \nand South, vulnerabilities in developing country cities are far greater. It is here that the \nlink between terrorism and development can be most tightly drawn, providing a clear \nrationale for destabilising the vicious cycle of terrorism and counter-terrorism that \ndestroys past and undermines future development. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n                                                 \n* Correspondence to: J. Beall, Development Studies Institute, London School of Economics and Political \nScience, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK. E-mail: J.Beall@lse.ac.uk \n 2\nThe history of warfare has always seen cities both as sites of protection and sites of \nattack. Although by no means the first such incident, the collapse of New York\u2019s Twin \nTowers on 11th September 2001 dramatically demonstrated the susceptibility of cities to \nterrorist attacks as well. Two and a half years later, on the 11th March 2004, bombs were \ndetonated on packed commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 and injuring over 1,500 \npeople, extending this amplified sense of urban vulnerability to cities in Europe. This was \nreinforced by the recent London bombings in July 2005, which again targeted ordinary \ncity dwellers going about their daily lives. Analyses of urban insecurity growing up in the \nwake of these events and contributing to the literature on the \u2018war on terror\u2019 have \nexamined the consequences of targeted urban terror campaigns in cities of the global \nNorth (Cutter et al, 2003; Glaeser and Shapiro, 2001; Graham, 2004). However, the \nargument advanced here is that the \u2018implosion of global and national conflicts into the \nurban world\u2019 (Appadurai, 1996, pp. 152-3) cannot be understood without attention also \nbeing paid to cities of the global South.1   \n \nWhen cities in developing countries \u2013 particularly those in the Islamic world \u2013 are \ndiscussed in relation to terrorism, it is often in the context of \u2018breeding grounds\u2019 for \ninternational terrorists.  However, many large cities of the South, from Karachi and \nMumbai, to Nairobi and Bogot\u00e1, have themselves been targets for episodic or sustained \nacts of terror. The London bombings also proved beyond a doubt the extent to which \ninternational networks operate across increasingly permeable international borders with \ncities serving both as nodes for the articulation of international terror networks as well as \ntargets of terrorism. Indeed, a vicious circle is increasingly in evidence, whereby cities \nare targeted in the \u2018war on terror\u2019 \u2013 Kabul and Baghdad come immediately to mind \u2013 \nbreeding further terrorism, counter terrorism and so on in a seemingly endless cycle.  \n \nWhen examining the incidence and impact of terrorism in cities of the developing world, \nit is important to think very carefully about which of the many definitions of terrorism to \ntake as a point of departure. Following Jonathan Barker\u2019s lead, the definition employed \n                                                 \n1 For ease of expression, I use inter-changeably the terms \u2018North\u2019 and \u2018South\u2019 on the one hand and \ndeveloped and developing countries, on the other, to refer respectively to industrialised and low- and \nmiddle-income countries.  \n 3\nhere has three main elements: a) violent acts threatened or employed; b) violent acts \ndirected against civilian targets; and c) violent acts threatened or perpetrated for political \nobjectives (Barker, 2003, p. 23). Unlike some characterisations, this definition embraces \nacts of terror committed by states. Although contentious, this is considered critical; for as \nBarker points out:  \n \nDefinitions that exclude state terrorism remain blind to a major source of the \nviolence and fear that is visited upon civilians around the world. State terrorism \nand group terrorism, it is true, have rather different features, but their effects on \npeople and politics are similar and they are often closely linked\u2019 (Barker, 2003, p. \n24).  \n \nMoreover, by putting more focus on terrorist acts rather than actors, this definition also \navoids the vexed question of when one person\u2019s \u2018terrorist\u2019 becomes another\u2019s \u2018freedom \nfighter\u2019 and escapes the essentialist categories associated with the discourse of the current \n\u2018war on terror\u2019. There is a danger that a focus on acts strips the analysis of considerations \nof power. While terrorist acts are themselves incredibly powerful \u2013 not least because they \ntransgress what is perceived to be \u2018normal\u2019 -  it is also the case that there are often great \ndifferentials in power between those espousing the causes advanced by terrorist acts and \nthose against whom such causes are pitted. This observation is made without wishing to \nportray terrorism as a \u2018weapon of the weak\u2019 (Scott, 1985). \n \nHere the largely negative implications of terrorist activities for development are \nexamined, as well as the potential of cities for propelling reconstruction and peace \nbuilding. The essay concludes by suggesting that while the specific challenges faced by \ncities of the South cannot be under-estimated, the very phenomenon of urban terrorism is \nserving to break down any sense of a rigid binary between the \u2018developed\u2019 and \n\u2018developing\u2019 worlds, at least in the urban realm. The implication for development is that \nthe \u2018them\u2019 and \u2018us\u2019 attitude prevalent in the international security discourse, and creeping \ninto development discourse, is not only misleading but is itself damaging to both \ndevelopment co-operation and global security. Moreover insisting on a clear divide \nbetween the notions of \u2018them\u2019 and \u2018us\u2019 serves to fuel ever-intensifying cycles of violence \n 4\nborn of \u2018terrorism\u2019 and \u2018counter-terrorism\u2019, levelling risk across cities of the world, while \nleaving the vulnerabilities of urban dwellers highly unequal.   \n \n \n2. CITIES, TERRORISM and GLOBALISATION \nOne of the most striking things about the blasts on the London Underground was the \nextent to which they illustrated how the politics of terror have become internationalised.  \nWhile the events of 9\/11 demonstrated the devastation that organisations based far \noutside the US could inflict on American cities, the more recent series of al-qa\u2019ida  \nrelated attacks in London further elucidated the truly global nature of terrorism: the \nattackers were British, seemingly orchestrated from Pakistan (their country of origin), \narguably in support of a cause rooted in the Arab world. Clearly, grievances felt in one \npart of the globe can be felt in many others and the more cosmopolitan the city the more \ngrievances are likely to resonate. This is not, of course, inevitable. If Pakistani youth in \nthe North of England are resentful and aggrieved due to unemployment, exclusion and \nreal or perceived racism, it is because multiculturalism has failed to translate into real \ncosmopolitanism. If, on the other hand, immigrants and refugees have opportunities and \nare treated with respect, it is more likely that the positive face of the cosmopolis will \nemerge. However, when people feel aggrieved or disenfranchised in one context, they can \nachieve satisfaction from championing a cause across the globe that somehow resonates \nwith their own misgivings or discontent. This has long been a feature of solidarity \nmovements and today international causes are facilitated by enhanced networking. \n 5\n \nThe geography of terror has moved on to the global stage largely by way of cities and \nspecific urban symbols. In part the message of the London bombers was that any war \nperceived to have its origins in London would come back to roost in London. While \nLondon was the site of thousands of people of multiple origins, taking to the streets in \nprotest against the war, 7th July 2005 also stand as a symbolic gesture against the Anglo-\nAmerican alliance that went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a quintessentially \ncosmopolitan city like London, the events of July 2005 are further emblematic of how the \nvictims of the bombs were inextricably linked to families, friends and sympathisers \nacross the globe.  \n \nThe notion of an internationally networked world economic system is not new (Castells, \n1989, 1998, 1996). Nor is it any longer revelatory to describe cities as critical nodes in \nsystems of global exchange (Sassen, 1991, 1994). However, a more recent and sobering \nrecognition of a \u2018networked urban world\u2019 (Hall and Pfeiffer, 2000) suggests that terrorism \nhas fundamentally changed the geographies of global inclusion and exclusion (Flint, \n2003). Not only is international communication easier than ever before but also many of \nthe supportive urban infrastructures or \u2018lifelines\u2019, such as transportation and \ncommunication, are available as targets for terrorist networks seeking to exploit the \nvulnerabilities of the \u2018network society\u2019 (Esser, 2004; Miller, 2003; Dezzani & \nLakshmanan, 2003). However, not all cities, nor all of their inhabitants, are similarly \nnetworked and few under conditions of their own choosing. Consequently, we need to go \nbeyond seeing networked cities simply as providing an optimum environment for the \noperation of global terrorism, to understand the accompanying networks of global, \nnational and local power.  \n \nIn order to understand why cities become targets of acts of terror and the impact of such \nacts on urban dwellers, it is necessary to say something about the nature of cities. The \nphysical environment of the city is important, as is the role of cities in national \ndevelopment, alongside the economies of scale provided by cities in addressing human \nwell-being through public goods and services. All these dimensions are attractive to those \nseeking maximum impact from their acts of destruction and disruption. Moreover, in \n 6\ncities institutional organisation and human interaction takes place within urban spaces. As \nargued elsewhere, \u2018Struggles for survival and power are played out in physical spaces and \nbuilt environments that are spatial and organisational expressions of social relations and \ncontesting realities\u2019 (Beall, 1997, p. 3). Urban space has been used by planners to put or \nkeep people in their place, while urban dwellers claim, challenge and change space and \nits uses. Hence terrorist acts not only attack the built environment and the urban political \neconomy but cities as social institutions and the very fact of urbanism itself.  \n \nAt the same time, an attack on a given city need not necessarily be a deliberate attack on \nthe city itself. Cities transcend national boundaries and have come to represent something \nbigger than the countries in which they are located. For instance, it is questionable as to \nhow likely the bombs in the busy urban tourist centres of Bali and Sharm el Sheikh were \naimed at the towns themselves, or even the Indonesian or Egyptian governments. \nSimilarly, the al-qa\u2019ida  backed bombings of the Australian embassy in Jakarta and the \nAmerican embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam also had an international focus. Thus \nunlike civil wars and other instances of urban political violence, terrorism is not only \ndomestic in impact and reach. Instead, urban terrorist acts in developing countries are \nused to communicate and send signals across the globe, with their impact ricocheting \nacross continents, or they become enmeshed in the rhetoric and policy agendas of the \nglobal \u2018war on terror\u2019. It is thus not unreasonable to speak of urban terror as a sort of \ninternational language. \n \nThat urban terror operates simultaneously at both global and local levels means that it \nmust be interpreted as profoundly geopolitical. This becomes clear, for example, when \none considers that the kind of terror\/counter-terror dynamics evident for so long in the \ncities of Israel and Palestine and now being replicated on a much wider international \nstage, articulated across strategic urban sites. A few anecdotal examples serve to illustrate \nthe point. In July 2002, the Colombian authorities foiled an attempt by the Revolutionary \nArmed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to fly a plane into government buildings in the \ncapital, Bogot\u00e1 (BBC News, 2002). After the July 2005 London bombings, there were \npress reports of Britain consulting Israeli politicians and security services in order to \nbring in expertise on the subject of \u2018dealing with suicide bombers\u2019 in urban centres \n 7\n(Shang-jen Li, 2005).  And precedence can be found in the presence of the US military at \nthe Battle of Jenin in Israeli Defence Force (IDF) uniforms, in order to observe the way \nthe IDF conducted itself within the Palestinian urban terrain, with a view to applying such \nmethods in their own military actions in Arab cities, despite Jenin having been widely \nbeen considered a failure and a grave violation of human rights (Graham, 2004). \n \n \n3. CITIES OF THE SOUTH AS ARENAS OF VIOLENCE \n \nWhen urban centres become arenas of terror, the way violence is visited upon them can \nvary enormously. For example, cities can be caught in the crossfire of wider international \nconflicts, chosen for attack simply because they afford a high degree of visibility or \nbecause urban targets promise maximum impact. Given the proximity of urban living and \nthe technologies central to modern urban life, cities offer the potential for devastating \nattacks. The London bombings or the periodic targeting of buses and passenger ferries in \nMindanao and Manila by the Philippine Abu Sayyaf Group, are testimony to this. City \nlife can itself be absolutely central to the terrorists\u2019 political goals. Here Israeli attempts \nto destroy Palestinian towns provide an example, constituting an attack on Palestinian \nurbanism itself.  \n \nIn identifying cities as arenas for acts of terror, it is important to recognise that these are \njust one form of violence faced by urban populations. Cities are also sites of political \nviolence and opposition, civil war and conflictual competition for access to and control \nover urban space and resources. Urban violence can take the form of communal riots, \nsuch as those that from time to time tear Indian cities apart, or see attacks on vulnerable \npopulations, such as the killing of hundreds of children by vigilantes every year in the \nstreets of Brazilian cities. Such battles can overlap or mesh with criminal violence, gang \nwarfare, or other features of the brittleness of urban life, but should not be confused with \ninternationally linked terrorism, although they often are in the rhetoric of the \u2018war on \nterror\u2019. \n \n 8\nAside from the various forms of man-made violence, cities of developing countries \n(especially in Africa and Asia) are vulnerable to new and growing forms of specifically \nurban risk (Mitchell, 2003). Under conditions of rapid urbanisation, these range from \ninadequate infrastructure, to poor service delivery and deficient or corrupt local \ngovernments. The effects of unregulated globalised industrialisation and climate change, \nfor example, are generating new forms of urban environmental hazard alongside older \nones (Wisner, 2004). Low-income urban populations are at particular risk, living in \nvulnerable locations exposed to the effects of poor water quality, petrochemical \nexplosions, landslides and earthquakes, as well as urban violence and crime (Douglass, \n1992; Patel, 1997a, 1997b).   \n \nNancy Scheper-Hughes (1993) and Daniel Goldstein (2004) refer to \u2018everyday violence\u2019 \nand \u2018spectacular violence\u2019 respectively. Associated with the latter, terrorism is a hazard \nthat derives from a very deliberate attempt to unsettle populations but it is important to \nrecognise that it is, in many cases, a relatively small risk compared to other hazards. As \nsuch it differs significantly from the more prosaic and pernicious threats that give rise to \nurban vulnerability. Thus, while the risk associated with a range of possible terrorist \nthreats is enormous, James K. Mitchell argues that efforts would be better spent focusing \non the particular vulnerabilities of urban populations.  Terrorist acts, he argues, \n\u2018challenge us to carefully examine changing relationships between the two main \ncomponents of environmental hazard (risks and vulnerabilities), and to increase our \nefforts to understand the more neglected component of the two, vulnerability\u2019 (Mitchell, \n2003, p. 21). \n \nCities of the South are particularly vulnerable because poverty, urbanisation and the rapid \nand unplanned expansion of cities exacerbate the impact of terrorism. According to recent \nUnited Nations projections, 2.2 billion people are likely to be added to the world\u2019s \npopulation between 2000 and 2030, with cities of Africa, Asia and Latin America \nexpected to absorb most of this increase. Indeed, by 2030 it is anticipated that 60% of the \nglobal population will live in cities and towns, with nearly all of this growth being \nabsorbed into the urban areas of the world\u2019s least developed regions (UN Habitat, \n2004\/05). The pace of urbanisation in the South has caused some to predict imminent \n 9\nurban dystopias, characterised by flood tides of people housed in walled islands of cheek-\nby-jowl wealth and extreme poverty (Hall and Pfeiffer, 2000). Cities are also vibrant and \ncreative places (Hardoy et al, 1992). Nevertheless, many of the distinctive qualities of \nurbanism derive from the fact that \u2018spatial proximity brings socio-economic diversity into \nfocus\u2019 (Montgomery et. al., 2004, p.71).  \n \nWhile cities are the source of cosmopolitanism and conviviality, it is also the case that as \nurban populations grow and become more differentiated, social distance is often \nmagnified. The demonisation of ethnic and religious minorities has been a central feature \nof urban terrorist attacks in developing countries. These can be identified from \nAhmedabad to Karachi and from Beirut to Sarajevo. Moreover, conflicts rooted in \ndivided cities where people are at war with highly \u2018othered\u2019 neighbouring communities \nare equally mirrored in the West (Davis, 2004). However, as demonstrated by Robin \nSoans (2005) in his recent play Talking to Terrorists,2 similarities are often as evident as \ndifferences. The script was based entirely on actual conversations he had conducted with \npeople formerly involved in terrorism. In one such conversation, a former member of the \nUlster Volunteer Force from Belfast tells of how he met and became friends with a \nmember of the IRA whilst in prison:  \n \n We were both working-class men from Belfast; we had both put cardboard into \n our shoes when it rained; by and large, I could have lived his life, and he mine. \n \nIt is likely that these dynamics parallel experiences of civil conflict in the Balkans or \nRwanda, where people literally found themselves at war with their neighbours. Similarly, \nthe rise of no-go areas, gated communities and the privatisation of security, bred by fear \nand insecurity, is equally a global urban phenomenon (Beall et al, 2002; Blakely and \nSnyder, 1997; Caldeira, 2000; Davis, 1990). \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Robin Soan\u2019s play Talking to Terrorists, directed by Max Stafford-Clarke for the theatre company Out of \nJoint, toured in England in 2005. Its recent London run took place at the Royal Court Theatre.  \n 10\nIn drawing conclusions about cities of the South as arenas for violence it is interesting to \nnote that conventionally war in developing countries has been thought of as a rural \nphenomenon, involving peasant soldiers and being conducted across mainly rural \nterrains. Reinforced by images of Amilcar Cabral, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh or Ch\u00e9 \nGuevara, there were of course urban exceptions in the anti-colonial struggles across the \nworld. The importance of Managua for the Sandinistas, the militant role of urban workers \nin colonial Africa and the now iconic example of Battle of Algiers3 are all instances that \nare easily recalled. Nevertheless, for the most part a rural focus predominates in \nsubsequent analyses of anti-colonial struggles, civil wars and the armed uprisings \naccompanying struggles for land, water and other essential resources. However, Eric \nWolf\u2019s (1969) Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century are increasingly giving way to \nwhat we might call urban wars of the twenty-first century (although it should be noted \nthat Wolf recognised that peasant wars sometimes arose as a result of opportunities to \nally with urban interests). What is different today is that equivalent examples of \nrevolutionary violence, such as the Chiapas in Mexico or rural uprisings in Nepal, operate \nwithin complex axes of interest that span national, regional and international localities \nand where rural-urban linkages seem more tightly drawn. They also operate within a \nhegemonic global context that often without analysis or justification, brands all forms of \noppositional violence, \u2018terrorist\u2019, particularly when it spills over into the visible arenas of \ncities.  \n \nThe effect of terrorist acts on cities of the global South is not well understood. However, \ngiven that the national economies of developing countries are less competitive, it makes it \nfar more difficult for them to recover after a severe terrorist attack. For example, the al-\nqa\u2019ida  bombing of a hotel in Mombassa in November 2002 was to the residents of that \ncity the last straw in the region\u2019s downward spiral into poverty and banditry (Richards, \n2002). The impact of the bombings in Sharm-el-Sheikh and Bali has been equally \nsubstantial. Moreover, in the context of weak governments and flailing economies, such \nas in Afghanistan, it is more difficult to undertake reconstruction, both physical and \n                                                 \n3 Made in 1965, Battle for Algiers was directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. The film has for decades been studied \nby liberation movements across the globe. Interestingly, the Pentagon held a screening of it in 2003, with a \nview to understanding more about the situation they faced in Iraq and the tactical options open both to them \nand their opponents. See http:\/\/www.taipeitimes.com\/News\/editorials\/archives\/2005\/07\/28\/2003265387. \n 11\nsocial (Beall and Esser, 2005). More generally, terrorism and the vulnerabilities on which \nit plays reduce the space for social and economic interaction and brake the economic \ngrowth and social development of affected nations (Dezzani and Lakshmanan, 2003). \nThere are certainly differences in the incidence of terror between cities of the North and  \nSouth. In the industrialised countries it is much lower (if Israel is discounted), despite the \ngreater analytical focus on cities of the North since 9th September, 2001. Colombia, for \ninstance, above all other countries, has had the highest number of attacks that can be \nclassified as terrorist, with a reputed 191 terrorist incidents in 2001 (Barker, 2003, p. 34). \nWhile the risk associated with terrorism in the South are very similar to those in the \nNorth, one of the insights that can be gleaned from the study of urban hazards in general \nis that the outcomes differ substantially in the South (Wisner, 2004). This is the case for \nterrorism as much as it is for earthquakes or heat waves. Under such conditions, cities are \ndoubly afflicted, by being the targets of actual attacks and primary recipients of the \neconomic and social side effects from which it is difficult to recover, underscoring the \ncontention that vulnerability is worst in urban areas, especially in developing countries \n(Mitchell, 2003).  \n \n \n4. URBICIDE AND STATE TERRORISM \n \nGiven the definition employed in this article, violence inflicted on civilian populations for \npolitical purposes by state actors is taken to be a form of terrorism, and one that is central \nto our analysis of urban terror in the developing world. The use of political violence in \nand against cities, as a deliberate attempt to deprive people of the benefits of urban life, \ngoes to the heart of Graham\u2019s analysis in Cities, War and Terrorism (Graham, 2004). \nFollowing Marshall Berman, Graham also uses the concept of \u2018urbicide\u2019 to describe the \nways in which cities are systematically and violently targeted (Berman, 1987; Graham, \n2004). In this view, urban targets are not only associated with terror attacks and war but \nalso pernicious urban planning, evictions, involuntary relocation and the deliberate \ndestruction of urban infrastructures for political purposes (Davis, 2004). Moreover, as \nGraham points out, the link between militarism and urban planning is often very close, \neven to the extent that the same personnel are involved.  \n 12\n \nThe most obvious example from the South is that of South Africa, where the apartheid \nstate sought to keep the black population of cities restricted to those people with jobs and \na pass giving them permission to live in urban areas. When this policy faltered the regime \nresorted to bulldozing settlements and forced removals to rural Bantustans, giving rise to \nwhat Murray has called \u2018displaced urbanisation\u2019 (Murray, 1987). Such forms of violence \nagainst the city and urban dwellers are not confined to apartheid South Africa. While \nnever couched in the language of terrorism, the legacy of colonialism is one in which the \n\u2018pacification\u2019 or \u2018regularisation\u2019 of cities featured to a considerable degree. Indeed the \nwholesale attempt to destroy certain urban spaces or to disperse particular urban \npopulations was a recognisable feature of empire and one that has persisted in some \ncontexts to the present. In contemporary Kabul, foreign military personnel actively and \nassertively participate in urban planning processes, despite being viewed by many of the \nAfghans involved, as members of an occupying force. \n \nIn many ways, the enhanced vulnerability of urban life in the South is best epitomized by \ninstances of state terrorism. While not exclusively confined to the developing world, state \nterrorism is more widespread in the South where many countries still fall under \nauthoritarian regimes or are victim of violent state institutions. Under such conditions, \nurbanity is often one of the first targets of states wishing to exert control by means of \nterror. For example, the Taliban, an armed non-state organisation whose origins were \nrural, succeeded in capturing the Afghanistan state and forming a regime based on terror.  \nHerold goes so far as to argue that the Taliban: \n \u2026represented the forceful imposition upon the city of distorted, traditional, \n decentralized, rural value and lifestyles [\u2026] one might say it was the revenge of \n the poor countryside against the city (Herold, 2004, p. 313). \nWhile it might be argued that Afghanistan\u2019s recent history offers a fairly idiosyncratic \ncase, the destruction of structures and symbols of urbanism is not unique and constitutes a \ncommon feature of state terrorism and can be used for strategic advantage. In this way, \nfor example, Israeli attempts to counteract Palestinian terrorism have often involved \n 13\npreventing Palestinians from forming enduring urban centres, with Palestinian urbanism \nbeing regarded as a \u2018cancer\u2019 on the body of the Israeli state (Graham 2004, Weizman \n2004).  \n \nThat activities aimed at eliminating urbanism fall within the realms of state terrorism is \nconfirmed by Ariel Sharon\u2019s words after a suicide bomber killed 19 and injured 172 \npeople at a Pesach dinner in a crowded seaside hotel in Netanya, Israel in March 2002. In \nremarks that preceded by a few weeks the bulldozing of Jenin in April 2002, he told his \nministers:  \nWe are in a hard war against a cruel and bloodthirsty enemy\u2026We must cause \nthem losses, casualties\u2026so that they understand they will gain nothing by \nterrorism\u2019 (Hills, 2004, p, 142).  \nBeyond civil war or inter-state conflict, the kind of destruction of urban settlements \npursued with such vigour by Sharon constitutes acts of terror that have been employed \nextensively elsewhere in the developing world. Examples of \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019, such as \ntook place in the Balkans, are not examples of urbicide as they are not necessarily \ndirected against the urban fabric. On the contrary they often seek to preserve physical if \nnot social resources for the victors. This is not the case with \u2018urban cleansing\u2019 such as is \nevident in contemporary Zimbabwe. While perhaps not a straightforward attack on \nurbanism per se, it has resulted thus far in around 700,000 people losing their homes, \nlivelihoods or both (UN Habitat report, July 2005). At one level it can be characterized as \na targeted political campaign akin to \u2018urbicide\u2019. At another it is very likely aimed at \npunishing urban voters who sympathise with the powerful Movement for Democratic \nChange opposition party established in 1999. It may also be aimed at swelling the ranks \nof the rural poor who are more dependent on government and therefore more supportive \nof it (BBC News, 2005). As such, a focus on urbanism should not obscure the class \ndynamics involved.  \n \n 14\nThe failure of Mugabe\u2019s regime in Zimbabwe to expand formal employment or income \nearning opportunities inevitably led urban dwellers in Harare to engage in irregular \neconomic activities. This in turn became central to the reason why the urban poor were \ntargeted (Brett, 2005). The residents of the Harare settlements that were bulldozed, \nillustrated in Figure 1, fall into two main groups. On the one hand are elderly \nhomeowners, unemployed and subsisting through the rents received from subletting \nrooms, outbuildings and houses to low-income urban tenants. On the other are the tenants \nthemselves who are much younger, with few prospects and who are largely ignored by \ngovernment policies. As a result they are dependant on informal sources of income \ninimical to the interests of the better off and aspirant supporters and beneficiaries of the \nMugabe regime. Very much urban dwellers, many among the urban poor lack support or \na sense of safety in the rural areas. Hence they are caught between town and countryside, \nreportedly living in \u2018the bush\u2019 on the city limits. The example of \u2018urban cleansing\u2019 in \nZimbabwe offers an important reminder that class dynamics are intrinsic components \nboth of urbanism and state terrorism.  \n \nFIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nInsecurity of tenure is a central vulnerability of many urban populations and one that is \nexacerbated by much wider examples of \u2018urban cleansing\u2019, whereby under conditions of \n\u2018urbicide\u2019, states perpetrate acts of terror on their own people. Beyond the immediate \nexample of Harare above, it is possible to cite a number of other contemporary examples \nof state terrorism. In 2001 and 2002 in Asia alone, 1.8 million people were evicted from \ntheir homes and another 3.9 million were under immediate threat of eviction (ACHR \nnewsletter). Between July and October 2001, 12,000 families were evicted from the \nAgargoan area of Dhaka under the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh, in the name of \nclearing up criminal elements in the city. Around the same time, the governor of Jakarta \nwas beginning his own \u2018clean-up\u2019 campaign. By November 2003, approximately 50,000 \npeople in Indonesia\u2019s capital had been evicted. The list goes on. In Karachi, according to \nestimates of the city\u2019s Urban Resource Centre, a total of 16,470 houses have been \n 15\nbulldozed as a result of evictions since 1992 (Urban Resource Centre, 2001). In \nAfghanistan since the fall of the Taliban residents of Kabul who live in or close to the \ncity centre have had to cope with several incidents of urban cleansing, allegedly to \nrevitalise the urban economy but in some cases clearly following elite interests and \nlargely detached from mutually agreed local economic development strategies.  \n \nEvictions and the bulldozing of informal settlements are such major causes of urban \npoverty that security of tenure was taken up by UN-Habitat as one of two major themes \nto take into the new millennium.4 Of course UN-Habitat does not deal with tenure issues \nfrom the perspective of state terrorism. Indeed, there is an argument that by describing \nsuch gross violations of human rights in this way is to undermine the rights agenda and to \nfall foul of the \u2018hype\u2019 associated with the \u2018war on terror\u2019. However, there is equally no \nreason why states should escape being included under the rubric of terrorism and to \nexclude them would be to overlook some of the most substantial acts of political violence \nagainst cities and citizens in the developing world. That said it is not just states that \ndeliberately enact violence on people in cities. As Martin Shaw points out, \u2018Ethnic-\nnationalist political movements often draw on rural and small-town hatred of the city\u2019 \n(Shaw, 2004, p. 145). The Abu Sayyaf separatists in Mindanao, for example, direct much \nof their vitriol and indeed their terror specifically at Manila (Cragin and Chalk, 2003). \nHowever, those episodes of terror that have had the most devastating impact on cities \nhave usually been state-led, with many having been backed by the United States. When \nexternal sovereign states become involved in perpetrating acts of terror in another nation, \ndistinguishing between war and state terrorism can be a thorny area. It has been \nfrequently asserted that the war on terrorism is a war of terrorism (Gregory, 2004, cited in \nGraham, 2004; Pilger, 2002) and in Kabul, Baghdad, Palestine and elsewhere, civilians \nhave arguably been targeted for the purpose of spreading fear and exerting dominance.  \nPut another way and in the words of C. Douglas Lummis (1994, p. 304, cited in Herold, \n2004), \u2018Air bombardment is the terrorism of the rich\u2019, a terrorism perpetrated against \n                                                 \n4 The other is Urban Governance.  \n 16\ncities where poor people are particularly vulnerable and where the prospect of \nreconstruction and recovery that much more difficult. \n \n5. URBAN TERRORISM AND DEVELOPMENT  \nUrban acts of terror are not only a geopolitical but very much a development issue. The \nidea of cities as heroic sites of civilisation is turned on its head by acts of terror (Graham, \n2004). They destroy what development has built, in relation to both the physical and \nsocial fabric and cause cities to regress in development terms. Writing about the first Gulf \nWar in 1990-91, Gautam Banarji notes that the violent assault on Baghdad\u2019s \ninfrastructure by US forces had the capacity to reduce what was previously a fairly \nadvanced economy to a \u2018pre-industrial age\u2019 (Banarji, 1997, p. 199). Terror onslaughts by \nincumbent regimes and US-led coalitions have subsequently led to similar outcomes in \nKabul, Gaza, and other cities across the Middle East, including Baghdad once more.  \nTerrorist acts divert resources away from investment in areas of development that \npromote growth and poverty eradication and when the state itself is a perpetrator of \nterror, another impact is that development assistance is often withdrawn, resulting in \nfurther blows to the development process. For example, development in Zimbabwe will \nsuffer not only because of the devastating effect of \u2018urban cleansing\u2019 but also because \ndonors are concerned not to provide aid to the Mugabe government for fear of propping \nup an authoritarian regime. When organisations such as al-qa\u2019ida  are present in a \ncountry, ironically the effect is often opposite, with aid to that country increasing in the \nhope that it will help diminish their influence. Given the spurious connection between \nterrorism and poverty and the long-term nature of pro-poor growth strategies, this \napproach might be questioned if the latter remain the critical focus of development \ncooperation. Critical for the monitoring of humanitarian and development aid is whether \nwhen it is increased, it is actually used to further the fundamental goals of development \nor whether, for example, it fuels the repression of citizens in the name of counter-terror. \nWell before the \u2018War on Terror\u2019 the efficacy of aid was questions, testified to by the \nreams written and many conferences held on the subject. Moreover, for a long time aid \nhas been seen as propping up unsavoury regimes (Duffield, 1992). However, as pointed \n 17\nout in the introduction, the \u2018War on Terror\u2019 has tightened the noose conjoining the twin \nheads of security and development and in such a way that it is not always clear how the \nlatter can remain of equal value and stature.  \n \nMany of the resources directed towards reducing terrorism \u2013 especially since 11 \nSeptember 2001 \u2013 have not targeted root causes but have been channeled into \nsurveillance, emergency planning and training operatives in counter-terrorism. This has \ndetrimental effects on other sectors of development, as suggested in the introduction.  In \nboth Tanzania and Kenya, for example, USAID has invested in training centres and \nemergency planning relating to terrorism, while these countries lack fundamental \ninfrastructures to deal with hazards such as floods, droughts or public health issues \n(Wisner, 2004). As such, the proportionality of urban hazards has been skewed by the \nwar on terror and development in many sectors crucial to managing urban hazards has \nbeen hindered by the focus on counter-terrorism. These processes affect both the global \nSouth and North alike. For example, it is arguable that the resources ploughed into the \ndepartment of Homeland Security in the US have weakened the state\u2019s ability to cope \nwith more common threats to its urban centres, the poor response to Hurricane Katrina \nbeing a case in point. .  In an unfortunate irony, the disproportionate focus on counter-\nterrorism by developed countries stands to leave their own cities open to increased \nvulnerabilities; hence, after hurricane Katrina, the widespread perception that New \nOrleans was a city reduced to \u2018third world\u2019 levels of chaos.  \n \n \nThe impact of terrorist acts on domestic policy and the delivery capacity of governments \nis also important. In the case of urban governance, the latter is undermined by one of the \nknock-on effects of terrorist acts and urban violence: the rise of private security and gated \ncommunities in which better off residents opt out of both public service delivery and \nlocal democracy. Moreover, it is often the case that those who perpetrate terrorist acts \n 18\nsurface from the ranks of the better off. It may be that targeted urban development \nprogrammes might yield rewards in terms of reducing support for terrorist acts, although \non their own they are by no means sufficient (Cragin and Chalk, 2003). Policies designed \nto assist particular marginalised or disaffected communities are difficult because they \nsignal lack of parity in the treatment of citizens. This can reinforce inter-communal \ndistrust, especially in tight urban spaces and lead to discontent (Cragin and Chalk, 2003, \np. 13).  However, whether urban development can reduce the incidence of terrorist acts is \nhard to say and attribution is almost impossible to ascribe. Despite this sober prognosis, \nthis is not an argument for abandoning urban reconstruction and development. \n \nCities can play a vital role in helping to resolve conflicts and rebuild societies. Antanas \nMockus, the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, for example, has written of his experiences \nattempting to change civic culture and attitudes to violence in the city. In part due to \nmayoral efforts to change perceptions of citizens\u2019 duties and responsibilities in respect of \nthe law and in part to a concerted and partially successful attempt to dispel negative \nperceptions of Bogot\u00e1, he has argued that violence is increasingly seen as morally and \nculturally unacceptable. While still rife, crime and homicide have dropped significantly in \nthe last decade and, crucially, it appears that citizens feel an ownership of these positive \nresults (Mockus, 2004). Just as the visibility of urban targets are crucial to the success of \nterrorist acts, the profile of cities is also central to their potential role in peace-building. \nIndeed, some of the very properties of urban life \u2013 diversity, cosmopolitanism and \ncreativity \u2013 can contribute to a defiant resilience and progress towards peace. More \ntangible peace resources include proximity to decision-makers and financial resources, \nthe protection or reconstruction of vital urban services, as well as opportunities for non-\nviolent political action and conflict management.  \n \nEmbracing cities as sites for peace requires engaging with difficult contradictions. In \nNicosia, while Turkish and Greek Cypriots were divided by the Green Line, they were \nequally dependent upon on the effective operation and maintenance of subterranean \nsewers, as were black and white South Africans, residentially segregated under apartheid. \n 19\nIn Palestine, an organisation perceived as terrorist by the Israelis is functioning at a city \nlevel in ways that could be construed as constructively working towards peace. Despite \nbeing in prison, Wajia Qawais \u2013 a leading member of Hamas \u2013 was recently elected as \nMayor of the town of Qalqilya. Its position on the West Bank border and its almost total \nenclosure by Ariel Sharon\u2019s dividing wall, places it right on the faultline of conflict, \nexplaining the high level of local support for the hard-line posture of Hamas. Despite the \nfact that Hamas is rhetorically committed to the destruction of Israel the nature of \nmunicipal governance renders necessary some communication between local \ngovernments. The Qalqilya mayor and his deputy made it clear that they were willing to \ndeal with surrounding Israeli municipalities on matters relating to electricity or sewage. \nBy the same token, while the Israeli foreign ministry has repeatedly stated that they will \nhave no dealings with Hamas, a senior Israeli commander in the West Bank has said that \nhe will deal with all mayors, whatever their political party (BBC Radio 4, 2005).   \n \n6. CONCLUSION \n \nIn highlighting the ways in which acts of terror impact on cities of the South, a distinction \nhas been made between cities in the \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 worlds. This is more \nthan simply a heuristic device. Cities in the world\u2019s poorer countries experience terrorist \nacts with greater frequency and often with more devastating effect than in economically \nadvanced countries. Nevertheless, given the globalisation of terror networks, the \npermeability of international boundaries and the fact that characteristics defining the \nurban experience in Botog\u00e1, Johannesburg and Los Angeles increasingly overlap, the \ndistinction between \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 cities does tend to break down in ways \nthat are not necessarily replicated at the national level. The extreme differentials of \nwealth in cities of many developed countries parallel those in the cities of the South, as \ndoes the way the increasing incidence of urban violence has entrenched social divisions \nand distance. Cities like Detroit are characterized by decaying infrastructure, half-ruined \ncityscapes and levels of gang and ethnic violence to rival the megacities of the \ndeveloping world (Graham, 2004, p. 44). There is a vibrancy, creativity and strong sense \nof order that underpin the seemingly informal and chaotic working and living \narrangements of low income urban communities in the South (Hardoy and Satterthwaite, \n 20\n1989). This is increasingly evident in cities of the North. Urban places everywhere are \nmore likely to be heterogeneous than rural areas. Indeed, the very reasons for terrorist \nacts targeted at Istanbul or Mumbai are not dissimilar to those aimed at New York, \nMadrid or London.  \n \nParticularly in cities of the South it is difficult to define acts of terrorism, given the \n\u2018conceptual minefield that is the current state of classification and understanding of \npolitical violence\u2019 (Shaw, 2004). Moreover, local acts of urban political violence can \nbecome entangled in the vicious cycle of terrorism and counter terrorism that \ncharacterises the \u2018War on Terror\u2019. Neither is differentiating terrorism from civil war not \nstraightforward, for example, in a country like India where separatist causes are rife. In a \ncity such as Bogot\u00e1, where urban violence takes many forms, it often becomes difficult to \nknow where terrorism begins and violent crime ends, as pointed out in this policy arena \nby Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez San\u00edn, especially given that Colombian terrorism is tightly bound \ntogether with the narcotics industry. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1 has sought to play down the \nrelevance of the distinction, stating: \u2018We\u2019re not interested in intent \u2013 whether political or \nnot, [violence] is a disease that we need to cure \u2026 the important thing is to preserve \nlives\u2019 (Regan-Sachs, 2001). The difficulty in determining the point at which urban \nviolence becomes terrorism is illustrated by Sophie Body-Gendrot, who argues that in \nsome cases \u2018Inter- social urban violence is not political per se but becomes political \nthrough its generated effects, that is via the potential exploitative strategies open to \npolitical actors\u2019 (Body-Gendrot, 1994, p. 215). Ultimately though, it is acts of terror that \nremain a defining feature of terrorism. It was the act of planting bombs in two cinemas in \nNew Delhi in May 2005, by the militant Sikh organisation, Babbar Khalsa International, \nthat rendered the incident terrorist rather than simply a gesture of Sikh separatism.  \n \nThe analysis presented here exposes something of a paradox: it is noted that cities of the \nSouth experience terrorism very differently to those of the North, and yet at the same \ntime urban terrorism also reveals the analytical weaknesses of a rigid binary between \ndeveloped\/developing cities. To make sense of this it is helpful to return to the distinction \nbetween risks and vulnerabilities. While vulnerability is more blatantly evident in the \nSouth, international terrorism has somewhat levelled the risk of exposure to political \n 21\nviolence. Issues of proportionality aside, it has become clear that the risks faced by cities \nin the North and South are very similar, both with respect to terrorist acts and, more \nrecently, other dangers such as environmental hazards. Yet it is the particular \nvulnerabilities of urban populations of developing societies, which result in differences in \nthe ultimate outcomes. \n \nA developing\/developed country binary can also be misleading in relation to political \nviolence. Mockus, in analysing attempts to alleviate crime in Bogot\u00e1, is explicit that some \n\u2018should also be recognized as important issues for American society\u2019 (Mockus, 2004, p. \n11). Far from being at opposite ends of a spectrum, the cities of both the North and South \nare not only afflicted by many of the same problems, but are bound together in their \naffliction. Views based on rigid binaries are problematic and indeed often serve to sustain \npolitical violence. It is just such an approach that allows al-qa\u2019ida  to proclaim everyone \nin New York a legitimate target, or for the American Administration to refer to hundreds \nof civilian deaths in Baghdad or Kabul as \u2018collateral damage\u2019. Ultimately the most \nsignificant dimension of urban terrorism is that it is an international problem requiring \nboth local and global resolution. This resolution, however, cannot be bought at the \nexpense of development. The vicious dynamic of terror and counter-terror currently \nunfolding, threatens development and stands to make cities more violent and less \nfunctional. Cities both in the North and South have enormous potential to become both \narenas of conflict and sites of conviviality and cosmopolitanism. It is upon the latter \ncapacity of the cosmopolis that development and security solutions are best built.   \n 22\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nI  first wish to thank Tom Goodfellow for his professional and indispensable research and \neditorial assistance.
