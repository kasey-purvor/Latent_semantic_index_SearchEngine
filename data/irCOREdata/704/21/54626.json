The acceptance of her work by a wide range of admirers has helped to \nsecure her position in the mainstream of theatre. She is renowned for continually \nrejuvenating dramatic form, as each play she writes pushes dramaturgy in new \ndirections. Yet her innovative approach to theatre has never been detached from an \nunswerving political commitment, a commitment that while channelled into \ninterrogating all forms of political power, continues to reflect a principled \nacknowledgement of the impossibility of political neutrality. Churchill\u2019s plays \nembrace the potential that the medium of drama offers, a medium by its nature \ncharacteristic of tension, conflict, and dynamism. Her plays are a testimony to the \npotentially seamless relationship between aesthetics and politics. These two \ndiscourses form one richly multi-layered language in Churchill\u2019s plays, a language \nthat seems especially capable of penetrating the political and social problems of the \ncontemporary moment through the interpellation of the audience as imaginative and \nsensory as well as intellectual spectators. \n \nChurchill\u2019s Mad Forest was first performed by Central School of Speech and \nDrama students in London in June 1990, and then performed at the National Theatre, \nBucharest, in September, finally opening at the Royal Court Theatre, London in \nOctober of the same year. It is a play that presents a staging of before and after the \nRomanian revolution seen predominantly from the perspectives of the middle-class \nAntonescu and working-class Vladu families. The revolution in Romania and the \ndemise of communism in Eastern Europe more generally form part of a sequence of \nevents that is reconstituted in neoliberal discourse as evidence proclaiming the failure \n 2\nof the communist project and the endurance and ultimate success of free-market \neconomics and liberal democracy.TPD1DPT Mad Forest powerfully intervenes in events that \ntypify the economic and political milieu characteristic of the closure of the decade, a \nclosure that is often considered to bear out Francis Fukuyama\u2019s earlier claims that the \ntriumph of capitalist democracy signalled the end of history. \n \nMad Forest dramatizes the burgeoning frustration and growing articulacy of a \npopulation repressed under a totalitarian dictatorship, suffering economic hardship, \npolitical censorship and cultural stagnation. In the first scene, the audience is \npresented with both the normality of repression and economic hardship in the life of \nthe Vladu family. The silence of the characters, punctuated by occasional exchanges \nunheard by the audience because of the blaring radio, indicates the presence of state \nsurveillance, surveillance that has altered methods of communication between family \nmembers. Bogdan angrily smashes one of the eggs Lucia has managed to acquire due \nto her marriage to the American, Wayne. At the end of the scene, Lucia\u2019s sister, \nFlorina scoops the egg off the floor with a cup, an action that reinforces the material \npaucity of the family\u2019s everyday context.TPD2DPT Later on in the play, in scene five, silence \nonce more dominates the scene, with only momentary interjections of action, gesture \nand speech. Radu Antonescu, the young art student, is queuing for meat; \u201cDown with \nCeau\u015fescu\u201d (Churchill 111), he whispers. The stage directions read: \n \nThe woman in front of him starts to look round, then pretends she hasn\u2019t heard.  \nThe man behind pretends he hasn\u2019t heard and casually steps slightly away from \nRadu. Two people towards the head of the queue look round and Radu looks \nround as if wondering who spoke. They go on queuing (Churchill 111). \n 3\n \nThe collective familiarity with political censorship is underlined, although here in this \ntransitory space of the queue, a quiet subversive act is indicative of the growing levels \nof non-cooperation. \n \nThe revolution in Mad Forest, like other Eastern European revolutions, is a \ncrystallization of the yearning for the collapse of the repressive regime, an end to \neconomic hardship, and the eradication of the autocratic administration. However, the \nplay is enriched by the dramatization of revolution in an Eastern European country \nthat is least typical in relation to these events.TPD3DPT George Galloway and Bob Wylie talk \nabout it as \u201cthe most extraordinary end, through the most extraordinary revolution, of \nthe most extraordinary dictatorship in all of Eastern Europe\u201d (4). Unlike other Eastern \nEuropean transformations where administrations in the main peacefully conceded the \noverwhelming demand for change, Romania was the site of bloody revolution with \nmass demonstrations, the shooting of protesters, and the taking up of arms by civilians \nagainst a resistant state;TPD4DPT hence the importance of the second part of the play, which \nforms its structural centre: the revolution, a part comprising quasi docudrama-style \ntestimony spoken by a diverse range of unnamed characters, who do not appear in any \nother part of the play. Unlike other regimes, which responded to the escalating \ndemands for change and would not risk the unpredictable outcome of mass uprisings, \nCeau\u015fescu clung firmly to power, condemned the actions of other Eastern European \nstates, and in so doing, precipitated the uprising. \n \n \n 4\nThe extraordinary character of the Romanian revolution is articulated too in the \ntheatrical nature of its expression. There is a brief but well-documented revelation on \nRomanian and world television that some of the crowd in the Ceau\u015fescu-organized \nsupport rally on 21 December were heckling and booing Ceau\u015fescu. The shock too \nthat many television spectators experienced on observing the famously startled look \non his face and the waving of his arms before the recording was prematurely cut, \ncontributed to the sense of drama surrounding these remarkable events. This is \nintensified by the melodramatic exit of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u015fescu by helicopter \nfrom the roof of the Central Committee Building, the second helicopter dropping \nleaflets warning the Romanian people of the immediate danger to their country\u2019s \nautonomy and integrity, and the videotaped trial and execution of the Ceau\u015fescus. \n \nInterestingly though, Mad Forest chooses not to represent the support rally or the \nsensational departure of the Ceau\u015fescus, other than in occasional references made \nduring the revolutionary accounts of part two. Instead, the play punctures the realist \nvignettes so acutely entwined with the historiography of the revolutionary period with \nstrange sketches of imagined Ceau\u015fescus. Rodica \u201cwearing a cloak and a big fur hat \nwith dollars and flowers on it\u201d (Churchill 148) dreams she is Elena Ceau\u015fescu \nexperiencing the betrayal of her soldiers. This surreal nightmare articulates the \npersisting presence of the Ceau\u015fescus. Although gone, they continue to haunt the \ncollective imagination. The Ceau\u015fescus are represented again towards the end of the \nplay when Gabriel returns home from hospital. He arrives back with Radu, Florina, \nLucia, Iano\u015f and other friends after stopping off for drinks. They re-enact the trial and \nexecution of the Ceau\u015fescus, which increasingly degenerates into aggression \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve \nall fucked your wife\u201d (Churchill 163) \u2013 they shout at Radu (as Nicolae) just before \n 5\nthey shoot Florina (as Elena). The stage directions indicate that Gabriel \u201cis \nparticularly vicious throughout this\u201d (Churchill 163). This viciousness culminates in \nGabriel hitting Iano\u015f with his crutch and shouting \u201cget your filthy hands off [Lucia] \n\u2026 Just joking\u201d (Churchill 164).TPD5DPT \n \nThis residual anger is, in part, an emotional expression of the revolutionary \nperiod as a site of intense contestation. Mad Forest articulates this contestation by \ndramatising incommensurate perspectives on the revolutionary events. While Gabriel \nis recovering in hospital having been shot during the uprising, a patient described by \nFlorina as \u201ca bit crazy\u201d (Churchill 145), asks: \u201cdid we have a revolution or a putsch? \nAnd who was shooting on the 22Pnd P? Was the army shooting on the 21PstP or did some \nshoot and some not shoot or were Securitate disguised in army uniforms?\u201d (Churchill \n143-144). Radu, too, thinks along similar lines: \u201cthe only real night was the 21Pst P. After \nthat, what was going on? It was all a show\u201d (Churchill 146). The historian, Martyn \nRady, claims:  \n \nThe rapidity with which the new government of the National Salvation Front \nwas formed, strongly suggests that close discussions between members of the \nparty \u2018old guard,\u2019 the army and the securitate may already have been underway \nby the time of Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s flight (102). \n \nHowever, the play does not endorse the view that the revolution was a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.  \n\u201cI\u2019ve no time for all that nonsense\u201d (Churchill 147), Irina says in response to this \nclaim. Florina, too, expresses frustration with her partner, Radu\u2019s, political position: \n\u201cI don\u2019t like what you think. You just want to go on playing hero\u201d (Churchill 165). \n 6\n \nPost-revolutionary Romania saw the National Salvation Front (NSF) gaining a \nhuge majority in the election: Ion Iliescu gained 85.07% as the NSF candidate for the \nPresidency, and the NSF gained 66.3% in the Chamber of Deputies. Many of the NSF \nwere members of the old bureaucracy, although several of the leaders had been \ndissident members (171). Explaining the election results from the right, Harry Barnes \nJr. (United States Ambassador to Romania 1974-77) insists \u201cthere is a strong \nRomanian cultural tradition that the way to survive is to get out of the way of harm\u201d \n(Nelson 3), a viewpoint that is poignantly countered in the revolutionary reports of \npart two of Mad Forest; a painter\u2019s comment, \u201cI saw a tank drive into the crowd, a \nman\u2019s head was crushed. When people were killed like that more people came in front \nof the tanks\u201d (Churchill 127) is just one of many examples. In contrast to Barnes Jr.\u2019s \nevaluation, British Marxists propose that the NSF was the party standing on a \nplatform least in favour of a rapid transfer to a free-market capitalist system, a system \nthat in turn would inevitably lead to mass unemployment and economic hardship.TPD6DPT \nThe play represents a multifaceted response to the aftermath of the revolution and to \nthe election results. Irina responds positively to the economic improvements: \u201ceggs in \nthe shops. We\u2019re getting the benefit already\u201d (Churchill 140) but Rodica seems in \nshock and is \u201cfrightened to go out\u201d (Churchill 141). Florina asks: \u201chow many people \nwere killed at Timi\u015foara? Where are the bodies? There were bodies found in a sandpit \nfor the longjump?\u201d (Churchill 147) Radu takes the position that the NSF stole the \nrevolution: \u201cthe Front tricked us\u201d (Churchill 153), and that the new regime is a \ncontinuation of the old: \u201cCeau\u015fescu Ceau\u015fescu. Iliescu Iliescu\u201d (Churchill 154). \n \n 7\n Fukuyama\u2019s famous article that appeared in the North American journal The \nNational Interest in the summer of 1989 was a cogently argued right-Hegelian \n(influenced by Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve) critique and development of such announcements \nas Daniel Bell\u2019s notion of the end of ideology and the postmodernist philosopher \nRichard Rorty\u2019s declaration that the grand narratives of human emancipation are now \ndefunct.TPD7DPT Fukuyama argues: \n \nThe century that began full of self-confidence in the ultimate triumph of \nWestern liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where \nit started: not to an \u2018end of ideology\u2019 or a convergence between capitalism and \nsocialism, as earlier predicted, but to an unabashed victory of economic and \npolitical liberalism (\u201cThe End of History\u201d 3). \n \nFukuyama\u2019s thesis stipulates that history arises out of the conflict of ideologies, that \nliberalism has achieved a supreme and lasting victory; hence, this enduring victory \nbrings with it the end of history. As well as referring to the decline of global \ncommunism, Fukuyama points to the demise of class struggle as an index to the \ncollapse of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism\u2019s major competitor.TPD8DPT Five \nyears after the article, Fukuyama reasserted his central thesis that \u201cliberalism does not \nhave many serious competitors\u201d and that \u201cthere is only \u2018one language,\u2019 that of liberal \ndemocracy\u201d (Reflections 257). Although dependent itself upon an engagement with a \nHegelian idealist grand narrative, Fukuyama\u2019s argument can be placed in dialogue \nwith postmodernist claims made earlier in the decade. The most high profile of these \nwas Jean Baudrillard\u2019s (cynical) appropriation of Frankfurt School thinking \nconcerning culture, politics and ideology, leading to his declaration that struggles \n 8\nagainst oppression are now lost in mass consumerist society, a society that is \ndominated by simulacra and the hyper-real.TPD9DPT \n \nMad Forest certainly does not dramatize a tangible alternative to free-market \ncapitalism. However, the play\u2019s narrative refuses to endorse the characteristics of \nWestern political economy as the panacea to the Ceau\u015fescu regime. In fact, it goes \nfurther; the play chooses to include specific and unmistakable signifiers of the United \nStates (the emblematic capitalist power) only to expose them as undesirable, if not \nobjectionable. The first of two weddings is between Lucia and the American, Wayne. \nWayne\u2019s presence is limited to the wedding scene, and he has no lines, but he is \nsignificant as the encroaching presence of values represented by the centre of \nneoliberal power, a power gleefully awaiting the destruction of the Eastern European \nregimes. It is because of Wayne that the Vladu family benefit from extra produce such \nas eggs and American cigarettes. It is also because of Wayne\u2019s money that Lucia is \nable to bribe the doctor to illegally abort what we find out later is her Hungarian \nlover, Iano\u015f\u2019s baby. But most insidiously it is the marriage between Lucia and Wayne \nthat has aroused suspicion and disapproval of the authorities. Bogdan is questioned by \nSecuritate over his loyalty, demoted from the position of foreman, and warned that \nlife will be made more difficult for his family; and indeed, Irina is moved to a \nworkplace much further away from home. Association with this emblematic \nAmerican figure, a figure that the audience never hears speak but whose impact is \nconsiderable, leads to a greater level of repression for the family. This clearly serves \nto intensify the indictment of the Ceau\u015fescu regime; however, American \u201cassistance\u201d \nhere is also subtly menacing; private American money is offered as the solution to an \n 9\nunwanted pregnancy and to the shortage of family resources; an impinging neo-\nimperialism is an alternative reading of this assistance. \n \nNotably, the marriage between Lucia and Wayne fails, as she prefers Iano\u015f. But \nshe also ends up rejecting America: \u201cI don\u2019t like America\u201d (Churchill 152) she replies \nto Iano\u015f when he says he would like to go there. Lucia\u2019s fickle and self-centred \ndisposition is suggested at several times \u2013 particularly in her insensitive response to \nToma, a Romanian orphan who Iano\u015f\u2019s family adopt \u2013 but also in her first words on \nreturning from America after the revolution: \u201cIn America everyone\u2019s thrilled\u201d \n(Churchill 144). However, her description of American consumerism is laden with \nanxiety: \n \nThere are walls of fruit in America, five different kinds of apples, and oranges, \ngrapes, pears, bananas, melons, different kinds of melon, and things I don\u2019t \nknow the name \u2013 and the vegetables, the aubergines are a purple they look as if \nthey\u2019ve been varnished, red yellow green peppers, white onions red onions, \nbright orange carrots somebody has shone every carrot, and the greens, cabbage \nspinach broad beans courgettes, I still stare every time I go shopping. And the \ngarbage, everyone throws away great bags full of food and paper and tins, every \nday, huge bags, huge dustbins, people live out of them (Churchill 144). \n \nThe celebratory discourse of consumerism with its seductive promise of fulfilment is \nshown to be an illusion, an illusion signified through the somewhat futile access to \n\u201cfive different kinds of apples\u201d and the lack of nutrition in the chemically vivid \n\u201cbright orange carrots.\u201d The last lines of Lucia\u2019s speech reveal her shock at the \n 10\ndisplay of disparity between the needs and desires of middle-class Americans who \ndiscard bagfuls of food each week, the remains of which are taken by those who \ncannot afford to satisfy basic needs.TPD10DPT Lucia\u2019s rejection of Wayne and America is also \nin an important sense the play\u2019s articulation of antipathy towards the free-market as a \ndesirable economy. \n \n Predictably, Fukuyama\u2019s end of history argument caught the imagination of the \nestablishment in the United States. In his searing critique of Fukuyama\u2019s arguments in \nSpectres of Marx, Jacques Derrida notes the importance of the end of history thesis in \ncontributing to an attempt to establish \u201can unprecedented form of hegemony,\u201d part of \nthis attempt consisting in \u201ca great \u2018conjuration\u2019 against Marxism\u201d (50).  But as well as \nfuelling new attempts by the Right to neutralize socialist discourses, the end of history \nthesis also further increased the general malaise of the Left in Britain and elsewhere.  \nThe \u201cpost-isms\u201d and \u201cend-isms\u201d were to a significant degree accommodated by the \nacademic Left, New Left Review, and Marxism Today. Although Eric Hobsbawm \nrecognizes the emptiness of Fukuyama\u2019s predictions (\u201cfew prophesies look like being \nmore short-lived than that one\u201d (23)), he nevertheless inadvertently buttresses some of \nthe main tenets of Fukuyama\u2019s claims when he identifies the 1989 revolutions as the \npermanent closure of the revolutionary narrative initiated in 1917: \u201cfor over 70 years \nall Western governments and ruling classes were haunted by the spectre of social \nrevolution and communism.\u201d For Hobsbawm, then, the Eastern European revolutions \nwere \u201cthe end of the era in which world history was about the October Revolution\u201d \n(18).  However, as J\u00fcrgen Habermas rightly argues: \n \n 11\nThe presence of large masses gathering in squares and mobilizing on the streets \nmanaged, astoundingly, to disempower a regime that was armed to the teeth. It \nwas, in other words, precisely the sort of spontaneous mass action that once \nprovided so many revolutionary theorists with a model, but which had recently \nbeen presumed to be dead (7). \n \nVladimir Tismaneanu is, of course, persuasive in his assertion that \u201cCeau\u015fescu\u2019s more \nthan two decades of rule succeeded in compromising the very name of Marxist \npolitical and social doctrine\u201d (135). Yet, during the Romanian revolution, huge \nnumbers of young people, students and workers participated in revolutionary \nactivities, some forming committees, temporarily taking control of key civic sites \nsuch as governmental buildings and radio and television stations, and engaging in \narmed conflict against a belligerently resistant political establishment. Indeed, in Mad \nForest it is made clear that all three of the young men, Gabriel, Radu and Iano\u015f, took \nan active part in the revolutionary uprising. The ghosts of Marx and the spectre of the \n1917 revolution (to borrow again from Derrida) are undoubtedly present in the 1989 \nrevolutions, and particularly in the Romanian instance.   \n \nThe political narrative of Mad Forest cautiously guards against the recuperation \nof the play as part of this neoliberal jubilatory discourse, a discourse that is both \u201cvery \nnovel and so ancient\u201d as well as \u201cboth powerful and, as always, worried, fragile, \nanxious\u201d (Derrida 50).  Derrida\u2019s assertion - \u201cnever in history, has the horizon of the \nthing whose survival is being celebrated (namely, all the old models of the capitalist \nand liberal world) been as dark, threatening, and threatened\u201d (52) - provides a useful \nillumination of the political coordinates within which Mad Forest locates itself. \n 12\nIndeed it is the signifiers of the old models of capitalism in the play that are \nrepresented as fragile and stale, as well as threatening and undesirable. In addition to \nimbuing the Ceau\u015fescu regime with a heavily outmoded significance, the play also \nindicates that the NSF\u2019s (capitalist) competitors are equally burdened with historical \nanachronism. The main parties to choose from in the election are the NSF, the \nHungarian Democratic Union of Romania, the National Liberal Party and the National \nPeasants Party. The latter two are the NSF\u2019s main rivals and are led by veterans of the \npre-communist period; thus significantly, there is nothing new to reflect the \nrevolutionary spirit of the moment, only old-communist versus pre-communist \nparties, and a choice between gradual or rapid return to free-market capitalism. In part \nthree, scene v, at Lucia\u2019s grandparents, the family discuss the murder of a man who \nput up posters for the National Peasants Party: \n \nGrandfather. A lot of people didn\u2019t like him because he used to be a big \nlandowner. The Peasants Party would give him back his land. \nFlorina.  So was he killed because\/the rest of the \nLucia. I thought the Peasants Party was for peasants. \nIano\u015f.   No, they\u2019re millionaires the leaders of it. \nFlorina.  village didn\u2019t want him to get all the land? \nLucia.   He should get it\/if it\u2019s his. \nFlorina. No after all this time working on it\/everyone (Churchill 155). \n \nThe old pre-communist parties promote the rapid restoration of a capitalist economy \nwith no rejuvenated thinking to reflect the newfound political agency that the \nrevolution has inspired. Furthermore, overlaps between old parties, including the \n 13\ncommunists, abound, as illustrated in the grandfather\u2019s assertion: \u201che was a party \nmember. He was very big round here. He was a big Securitate man,\u201d to which Lucia \nresponds, \u201cso whose side was he on?\u201d (Churchill 155) \n \n Rather than conceding the ideological supremacy of neoliberalism, Mad Forest \nrepresents the revolution as an expression of a myriad of social and political impulses, \nnone of which, however, are conterminous with Fukuyama\u2019s triumphant end of \nhistory discourse. As with the revolutionary hopes in Churchill\u2019s 1976 play Light \nShining in Buckinghamshire, a dominating social class quickly appropriates the space \nfor self-realization. But the anti-communist expressions of many of the characters are \nshown not to be equivalent to a desire for the restoration of capitalist economics; \nFlavia says: \u201cblack market prices have shot up\u201d to which Irina responds with \u201cit\u2019s not \nblack market, it\u2019s free market\u201d (Churchill 168). Bogdan worries about privatization: \n\u201cprivate schools, private hospitals. I\u2019ve seen what happens to old people. I want to \nbuy my father a decent death\u201d (Churchill 174). The play points towards the \nconsciousness, activities, and relationships between ordinary people as the location of \nhistorical development, and these become fluid and dynamic, opening up sites of \ndiscussion usually closed or at least muted in communist and capitalist systems alike. \n \nThe social and political landscape dramatized in Mad Forest is full of ambiguity \nand uncertainty. The ideological hesitation of the play\u2019s perspective is reiterated in \nmany aspects of the drama. A prime example of this is in the first act, which is \ncharacterized as including several long silences (\u201cBogdan and Irina Vladu sit in \nsilence\u201d (Churchill 107); \u201cMihai thinking and making notes, Flavia correcting \nexercise books, Radu drawing. They sit in silence for some time\u201d (Churchill 108); and \n 14\n\u201cFlavia and Mihai sitting silently over their work\u201d (Churchill 118)). The silences are \ncertainly reflective of the stifling context of the Ceau\u015fescu regime but they also mark \nthe absence of narrative in the play, a narrative providing a coherent account of the \nplot, but also a political narrative explaining the revolutionary period. The lack of a \nclear sense of political direction in the play is both a purposeful depiction of the \ndearth of political options in revolutionary Romania as well as a reflection of the lack \nof clarity and weakening of confidence that exists on the British Left in relation to its \nresponse to the demise of the Eastern bloc. However, there is too, an attempt not to \nappropriate the revolution \u2013 not to speak for Romanians, but allow instead a cultural \ndifference to remain, a difference articulated as well in the play\u2019s refusal to be fully \nunderstood.  \n \n The characters develop sophisticated modes of negotiating and subverting the \nstate\u2019s system of repression, and in the process they repudiate the passive, complicit \nsubject positions that constrain them. This reaches a high point when Gabriel moves \nbeyond covert and defensive modes of resistance towards more open forms of non-\ncooperation. In scene ten he arrives at his parents\u2019 house and excitedly starts to inform \nhis family \u2013 without turning the radio on \u2013 of his dealings with Securitate. Irina\u2019s \nresponse \u2013 \u201cwait, stop, there\u2019s no power\u201d \u2013 indicates the perceived danger of doing \nthis (Churchill 117). However, his newfound courage gives Gabriel the confidence to \ntransgress what seem like immutable boundaries, and this triggers the same impulse in \nthe others. Florina says: \u201cno, what if they do hear, they know what he did\u201d; the stage \ndirections read, \u201cafter a while\u201d Irina \u201cstarts to listen again\u201d (Churchill 117). Bogdan \ntoo, expresses endorsement (\u201cyou\u2019re a good boy\u201d), although appreciation of Gabriel\u2019s \n 15\ndefiance is not unanimous; Lucia asks, \u201cwhat if I don\u2019t get my passport?\u201d (Churchill \n118) \n \n Gabriel cleverly manipulates dogmatic statutory code in order that he can be \nrelieved of Securitate\u2019s request of him to inform on his colleagues: \n \nAnd I said, \u2018Of course I\u2019d like to help you,\u2019 and then I actually remembered, \nlisten to this, \u2018As Comrade Ceau\u015fescu says, \u201cFor each and every citizen work is \nan honorary fundamental duty. Each of us should demonstrate high professional \nprobity, competence, creativity, devotion and passion in our work.\u201d And \nbecause I\u2019m a patriot I work so hard that I can\u2019t think about anything else, I \nwouldn\u2019t be able to listen to what my colleagues talk about because I have to \nconcentrate\u201d (Churchill 117). \n \nGabriel\u2019s skilful process of deconstruction reveals weaknesses in the coherence of the \nstate\u2019s disciplinary codes; how can you dedicate yourself to your work and at the \nsame time focus on the conversations and actions of others? Additionally, he openly \ndivulges this information to his family in contravention of perceived surveillance. \nFurthermore, and perhaps most importantly, Gabriel\u2019s action is one that refuses \nbetrayal of his fellow workers and is therefore a thoroughly social and comradely \naction. His refusal recalls a politics that depends upon a sense of collectivism, \nsolidarity, and unity. Gabriel gains a sense of agency and autonomy, \u201cand I\u2019m so \nhappy because I\u2019ve put myself on the other side, I hardly knew there was one\u201d \n(Churchill 117). The other side, however, is fluid, embryonic, and in want of political \nand theoretical development, which is why the revolution is so swiftly expropriated.   \n 16\n \nThe reports that make up the revolutionary narrative in part two form a dynamic \nmesh, a mesh that contains contradictory strands jostling in a state of flux. The \npainter\u2019s statement (\u201cI had an empty soul.  I didn\u2019t know who I was\u201d (Churchill 127)) \ngestures as much towards the potential for change, towards transformed identities and \na new sense of self-awareness, as it does towards the fear and terror prompted by \nviolent confrontation. We hear from a student that \u201csome workers from the People\u2019s \nPalace come with construction material to make barricades\u201d (Churchill 125); he says a \nlittle later \u201cwe tried to make a barricade in Rosetti Place. We set fire to a truck\u201d \n(Churchill 126). The following day the housepainter sees \u201cthousands of workers from \nthe Industrial Platforms \u2026 more and more, two three kilometres\u201d (Churchill 129).  \nThe translator says, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed in films people scatter away from gunfire but here \npeople came out saying, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 People were shouting, \u2018Come with us,\u2019 so we \nwent in the courtyard and shouted too\u2019\u201d (Churchill 129). A student describes the fear \nof seeing the \u201cpolice in front of the Intercontinental Hotel\u201d but adds \u201cin a crowd you \ndisappear and feel stronger\u201d (Churchill 130). The translator, who states, \u201ceveryone \nwas hugging and kissing each other, you were kissing a chap you\u2019d never seen \nbefore\u201d (Churchill 130) reinforces this sense of solidarity and comradeship. But this \nrenewed feeling of commonality and shared sense of militancy sits alongside residual \ndivisions; \u201cwe hadn\u2019t gone far when we saw a crowd of people with banners with Jos \nCeau\u015fescu, shouting, \u2018Come and join us.\u2019 They were low class men so we didn\u2019t \nknow if we could trust them\u201d (Churchill 130), asserts one of the students. \n \nThe most visible divisions in the play are those arising from racism, xenophobia \nand ethnic hatred. The fascism of the Iron Guard that resurfaces in post-revolutionary \n 17\nRomania appears in scene nine where the angel tells the priest \u201cthe Iron Guard used to \nbe rather charming and called themselves the League of the Archangel Michael and \ncarried my picture about\u201d (Churchill 116). Rady describes Iron Guard ideology as \nowing \u201cmuch to the peasant populist movement of the nineteenth century, but with the \nrational element burnt out leaving only a malignant emotionalism\u201d (24). The priest\u2019s \nchallenge to the angel over his flirtation with fascism places other instances in the \nplay of racism and xenophobia in the context of an established history of fascism in \nRomania, a history formed out of complicity of the Orthodox Church with the Iron \nGuard and the pre-war pro-Nazi governments. Notably, the mode of representation of \nthese fascist impulses is anti-realist. In the New York premiere the angel appeared \u201cin \nresplendent Byzantine artifice under brilliant illumination and to the accompaniment \nof stirring ecclesiastical music\u201d (Garner 399). Una Chaudhuri interprets the angel\u2019s \nfantastical presence firstly as a joke, secondly as a manifestation of the priest\u2019s \nconscience and thirdly, after rejecting both of these, as intentionally inexplicable: \u201cit \nis recognition of the actual enigma of the supposedly familiar\u201d (152). Yet the angel is \nundoubtedly spectral in nature, and as such its importance can be attributed to its \nhaunting propensity. Like the radical currents of the October 1917 revolution, the \npresence of fascist predilection similarly lingers, threatening to resurface at any \nmoment. In this way, the experience of contemporary events played out in the \nintensely realist nature of much of the scenes is supplemented by an alternative, anti-\nrealist discourse that facilitates the representation of past and future histories. \n \nMost racist incidents occur after the revolution. Pre-revolution, the characters \noperate in stifled conditions, speaking in code and repressing thoughts and desires. \nThe gap of anticipation, created by revolution, provides them with the opportunity to \n 18\nexpress their means of making sense of the past and present, including voicing beliefs \nsteeped in reactionary and bigoted frameworks of thinking. Lucia, whose lover is \nHungarian, seeks to reposition Hungarians in the ethno-political matrix: \u201cHungarians \nwere fighting beside us they said on TV. And Iano\u015f wasn\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s good. I think \nAmericans like Hungarians\u201d (Churchill 135). In response to Gabriel\u2019s xenophobia \n(\u201cthe poor Hungarians have a bad time because they\u2019re not treated better than \neveryone else\u201d (Churchill 145)) Lucia replies, \u201cthis is what we used to say before.  \nDon\u2019t we say something different?\u201d (Churchill 145) But her desire to move away \nfrom anti-Hungarian sloganeering seems selfishly motivated and does not extend to a \nmore enlightened anti-racism: \n \nIn America they even like the idea of gypsies, they think how quaint. But I said \nto them you don\u2019t like blacks here, you don\u2019t like hispanics, we\u2019re talking about \nlazy greedy crazy people who drink too much and get rich on the black market. \nThat shut them up (Churchill 146). \n \nFukuyama\u2019s model of liberal democracy, America, is once again undermined as \nAmerican racism is used by Lucia to justify discriminating against Romanian gypsies.   \n \nMad Forest is often engaged with as a postmodern play that, in Tony Mitchell\u2019s \nwords, \u201ceschews the \u2018master narratives\u2019 of totalising social-realist paradigms on the \none hand and epic pageantry on the other for an open-ended, quasi-cinematic series of \ncryptic vignettes portraying everyday life in Romania\u201d (500). Donna Soto-Morettini \ndescribes the play as \u201creinforcing neither a \u2018meta-narrative\u2019 of progress, nor the ideals \nof reason\u201d (114) and Chaudhuri claims, \u201cin the extreme, Mad Forest presents place \n 19\nitself as a function of change, and change, in turn, as an effect of language, especially \nspoken language\u201d (148). While the uncertainty expressed in the drama can be \ncharacterized as fractured and mosaic, the play is nonetheless more than a postmodern \narticulation of what Soto-Morettini describes as a \u201cpost-Enlightenment sphere\u201d (114) \nwhere the examination of \u201cpolitical cynicism\u201d (115) takes place. Although the play \ndoes not articulate coherent clarification of the revolutionary narrative or provide \ntangible political solutions, Mad Forest nevertheless communicates a faith in \nemancipatory goals. Notwithstanding the play\u2019s ideological hesitation and its \nconstruction of a certain cultural untranslatability, there remains a strong commitment \nin the play to the potential of both individual and collective resistance, and a faith in \nthe characters\u2019 desire for self-empowerment and self-realization. Unlike other British \nLeft plays on the break-up of the Eastern bloc such as David Edgar\u2019s The Shape of the \nTable (on the subject of political negotiations in Czechoslovakia) and Howard \nBrenton and Tariq Ali\u2019s Moscow Gold (concerning power struggles between \nGorbachev and Yeltsin with three cleaners representing the mass of ordinary people), \nChurchill populates the stage with the lives of ordinary people. Through the play\u2019s \nemphasis on and sympathy with figures, families and communities that lack official \npolitical agency, it intimates its interest and faith in cooperative and popular \nresistance. The political silences, then, in Mad Forest can be read as partly an \nobjectification of the challenges confronting British Left engagement with the Eastern \nEuropean revolutions and partly as an attempt to construct and contribute towards a \ncertain Romanian self-determination. Indeed, these political silences can additionally \nbe read as an interrogation into the process of history making, but they are less an \ninsistence on privileging a representation of the world, that \u2013 in Terry Eagleton\u2019s \n 20\ndescription of postmodernism \u2013 is \u201ccontingent, ungrounded, diverse, unstable, \nindeterminate\u201d (vii). \n \n   Churchill presents the characters\u2019 far from simplistic and at times contradictory \nengagement with the Ceau\u015fescus, communism, revolution, Western capitalism, and \nelections; nevertheless, this engagement is always materially contextualized. Radu\u2019s \nvehement anti-communism, for example, continues with his attitude towards the NSF, \nand his middle-class identification with the opposition is made clear: \u201cIlescu\u2019s going \nto get in because the workers and peasants are stupid\u201d (Churchill 153). This class \narrogance causes problems in his relationship with Florina, who feels \u201cin a panic,\u201d \nafter the revolution since before she could \u201ckeep everything out\u201d (Churchill 153). \nRadu says to her \u201cbut you didn\u2019t have me then,\u201d to which she replies, \u201cno but I \nthought you were perfect;\u201d \u201cI am perfect,\u201d he answers\u201d (Churchill 153). Their \nrelationship becomes more fraught when Radu joins the occupation of University \nSquare; \u201cso what have you done today? Sat in the square and talked?\u201d (Churchill 165) \nsays Florina. As their argument intensifies, Radu retorts, \u201clet\u2019s forget we know each \nother\u201d and brands her \u201cCommunist\u201d to which Florina replies, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me\u201d \n(Churchill 165). \n  \n Bogdan expresses frustration with the occupation of University Square (\u201cwe can\u2019t \nhave a traffic jam forever\u201d (Churchill 170)) because of the persistent claim from the \nprotesters that the revolution was hijacked by a coup: \u201c\u2018was it a revolution?\u2019 of course \nit was. \/My son was shot for it\u201d (Churchill 170). His old peasant aunt shouting ritual \nchants at Florina (\u201clittle bride, little bride, \/you\u2019re laughing, we\u2019ve cried\u201d (Churchill \n169) provides a thematic connection with Bogdan\u2019s assertion, \u201cI support the Peasants \n 21\nParty because my father\u2019s a peasant \u2026 They should have their land because their feet \nare in the earth and they know things nobody else knows\u201d (Churchill 175). Bogdan \nretreats into what he thinks he knows best; his roots in the peasantry, growing up in \nthe countryside, folklore, the earth and nature provide a sense of security amidst the \nconfusion, \u201cCIA, KGB, we\u2019re all in the hands of foreign agents. That\u2019s one point \nwhere I\u2019m right behind Ceau\u015fescu\u201d (Churchill 175). \n \nRacist comments, violent incidents, and misunderstandings compete with \nmoments of kindness, understanding, and unity. The exchanges at the wedding of \nFlorina and Radu in part three over land ownership, the revolution, the occupation in \nUniversity Square, the nature of the NSF and the other parties, the relationship \nbetween Romania and Hungary and the related Transylvanian question end up \ndeteriorating into a drunken brawl. But the play does not end here, as the stage \ndirections read, \u201cthey pick themselves up, see if they are all right \u2026 They begin to \nenjoy themselves\u201d (Churchill 178). Although initially disruptive, the fight also \nappears to be cathartic as they resume the wedding rituals, seemingly, or at least \ntemporarily, reconciled.TPD11DPT In the final moments of the play, the characters \u201cstart to \ntalk while they dance, sometimes to their partner and sometimes to one of the others, \nat first a sentence or two and finally all talking at once\u201d (Churchill 178). They switch \nfrom speaking English to Romanian, which prevents English-speaking audiences from \nfull comprehension of the conclusion to the play. Producing a certain \nindecipherability for audiences (readers are provided with translations) is a reminder \ntoo that, as the sub-title of the play designates, Mad Forest proposes to be \u201ca play \nfrom Romania,\u201d and as such seeks to construct a sense of cultural specificity for the \nRomanian revolution. It is, of course, a play from Britain as well, and the intercultural \n 22\ndiscourse that takes place seems to oscillate between different geopolitical as well as \nmacro and micropolitical perspectives. \n \nThe political vision in Mad Forest seems to be dispersed gently through a \ncommitment to the potential and desire of ordinary people for self-emancipation. \nFurthermore, there is a refusal in the play to perceive the revolutionary events as \nheralding the end of socialist paradigms. Of course, confidence in a clearly \nidentifiable socialist solution is absent in the play, just as it is in much of British Left \ndebate of the moment. At the same time, rather than welcoming the free-market, or \npositing postmodern relativity as a political impasse, the play seems to indicate the \ncontinuing importance of discussion, debate, individual and collective resistance. The \ndrama was created out of \u201cthe company\u2019s intense involvement\u201d with \u201cRomanian \nstudents and other people\u201d when \u201cemotions in Bucharest were still raw\u201d (Churchill \nvii). This also contributes to the play\u2019s political position; it reflects the continuing \ndynamic of political fluctuation and emotional engagement of Romanian participants. \nThe play dramatizes the revolution as a utopian moment of possibility but also as a \nvulnerable space, a space of disputation, a space that is ultimately lost to forces of \ntradition and anachronism, most potently symbolized by the vampire who smells \nblood and comes to feed. The play implicitly acknowledges that the prospect of a \ndemocratic socialist movement emerging in Romania is unlikely in the near future, \nbut the buoyant, self-realization of huge numbers of people dramatized in Mad Forest \nclearly demonstrates the potential for future collective resistance and upheaval. Rather \nthan endorsing what Michael Evenden describes as \u201can apocalypse of stasis\u201d (100) \nbrought about by the end of history, Mad Forest suggests that political impulses \nextraneous to capitalist democracy continue to remain significant in their threat to \n 23\ndestabilize a fragile hegemony. Mad Forest tells us history has not ended; history\u2019s \nradical unpredictability, if anything, is its defining characteristic. \n \n \n \n  \n                                                 \nTP\n1\nPT I appreciate the debates surrounding the terms \u201crevolution\u201d and \u201cEastern Europe.\u201d  However, I am \nretaining both.

Nevertheless, I agree with Ludmilla Kostova\u2019s discussion of the \nsimplification and homogenization of identities that takes place when the term \u201cEastern Europe\u201d is \nused, and therefore I use the term with hesitation. \nTP\n2\nPT In the discussions that took place after the production of Mad Forest at the National Theatre \nBucharest, some audience members expressed shame at the idea that a Romanian would do this.  \nAnother Romanian woman admitted doing it twice (Roberts 239). \nTP\n3\nPT I say least typical because of Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s hostility to Moscow and Romania\u2019s idiosyncratic Stalinist \nregime.
