A key challenge in\nachieving the desired specifications is thus to find ways to\nprevent BIC formation.4,5 Techniques such as preamorphiza-\ntion and solid-phase epitaxial regrowth \u0001SPER\u0002 can enhance\nboron electrical activation above solid solubility,6 but end of\nrange damage, left in the crystalline phase after SPER is\ncompleted, provides excess interstitials that drive BIC for-\nmation during subsequent annealing.7 Furthermore, as\nsilicon-on-insulator \u0001SOI\u0002 substrates increase in importance,\nthe integration of techniques based on preamorphization may\nbe problematic, especially for fully depleted devices.8\nThis letter reports on an optimized vacancy engineering\ntechnique as a potential rival to preamorphization and SPER.\nThe method relies on the inherent properties of ion implan-\ntation, which produces Frenkel pairs in which the vacancy\nand interstitials are spatially separated due to the momentum\ntransfer from the incident ion. This leaves a net excess of\nvacancies close to the surface and a corresponding excess of\ninterstitial atoms around the ion projected range.9 The excess\nvacancies close to the surface improve the properties of a\nsubsequent boron implant by annihilating the excess intersti-\ntials needed for BIC formation, thus facilitating an increase\nin electrical activation of boron.\nThe presence of a deeper band of interstitial defects\nmight be seen as a disadvantage of vacancy engineering,\nbecause, as in the case of SPER \u0001Refs. 7 and 5\u0002 interstitials\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\na.j.smith@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u00028\u0001\/082112\/3\/$23.00 88, 08211\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject todiffusing back from this band could cause deactivation at\nlonger annealing time scales. In early vacancy engineering\nstudies, this was not a problem as high-energy high-dose\nsilicon co-implants were used, generating deep stable inter-\nstitial damage in the form of dislocation loops.10 However,\nmuch lower energies and doses are needed for compatibility\nwith industrial silicon processes, and the shallower, less\nstable interstitial defects produced by such implants may\ncause deactivation. Previous work has shown that this diffi-\nculty with lower-energy coimplants can be overcome by the\nuse of SOI substrates.11,12\nWhen a vacancy engineering implant is performed in\nSOI and the silicon coimplant energy is designed such that\nthe majority of the excess interstitials are recoiled beyond the\ndepth of the silicon top layer, it is difficult for them to diffuse\nback through the buried oxide \u0001BOX\u0002 and annihilate with the\ngenerated vacancies at the surface.11 This enables a much\nlower silicon coimplant energy to be used, with parameters\ndictated by the SOI structure.12 In this letter, we apply this\napproach to the activation of an ultrashallow boron implant\nwith parameters typical for the next complementary-metal-\noxide-semiconductor technology generation. The results\nshow stable activation levels well above previous reported\nvalues.\nThe experiments were performed on SOITEC SOI wa-\nfers having a 55\/145 nm structure. The 160 keV silicon\ncoimplant was performed at a 7\u00b0 tilt and 22\u00b0 rotation to\ndoses in the range from 4\u00011014 to 1.1\u00011015 cm\u22122 prior to a\n500 eV, 1\u00011015 cm\u22122 boron implant. The projected range of\nthe silicon implant places the peak of the excess interstitial\nregion just below the BOX, with a portion residing in the\nlower part of the buried insulator. Transmission electron mi-\ncroscopy images obtained after silicon implantation \u0001not\nshown\u0002 indicate that the excess interstitial damage is isolated\nbehind the BOX, leaving the top silicon free of the\ninterstitial-type defects that occur when conventional\npreamorphization and SPER are used.

To study the effects of the\nvacancies on the ultrashallow p-type layer, a 10 s isochronal\nannealing cycle \u0001500\u20131000 \u00b0C\u0002 was used. Subsequently,\nsamples were examined using SIMS and Hall-effect mea-\nsurements to study the effects on diffusion and electrical ac-\ntivation, respectively. For this study a Hall scattering factor\nof unity has been assumed in order to estimate the hole\nconcentration.\nThe measured sheet resistance, Rs, of the p-type layers is\nshown in Fig. 2 as a function of annealing temperature and\ncoimplant dose. Without a silicon coimplant, Rs follows a\ntrend which has previously been observed and explained in\nterms of two key influences.12 First, a nonequilibrium pro-\ncess driven by interstitials causes boron to cluster into BICs\nat low temperature, the BICs starting to dissolve as the tem-\nperature is raised above 700 \u00b0C. Secondly, equilibrium solid\nsolubility of boron increases as a function of temperature in\nthis range. The first effect is the major limitation on boron\nactivation at low temperature; the second is more important\nat high thermal budgets as the solution of boron approaches\nequilibrium.\nFIG. 1. Schematic of our experimental conditions, showing the SOI struc-\nture, the distributions of excess vacancies \u0001\u0001\u0002 and interstitials \u0001\u0002\u0002 resulting\nfrom our highest-dose 160 keV silicon coimplant \u0001estimated from Monte\nCarlo simulations\u0002, and the 500 eV B implant profile \u0001measured by SIMS\u0002.\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject toBy comparing the boron with and without a coimplant,\none can see that all coimplants reduce the Rs and the level of\nreduction increases monotonically with silicon dose \u0001Fig. 2\u0002.\nFurthermore, the trends across all silicon doses are similar\nshowing that at 1000 \u00b0C there is a negligible difference be-\ntween the boron implant with or without the silicon coim-\nplant. However, as the anneal temperature is reduced the\neffects of the coimplants become apparent, showing large\nreductions in Rs which increase with decreasing annealing\ntemperature down to 600 \u00b0C. This shows that even with a\ncoimplant the mechanisms discussed above still have a major\neffect on the boron layer. However, due to the presence of\nthe excess vacancies it is possible to reduce the formation of\nBICs so that a greater fraction of the boron implant can be-\ncome electrically active at low temperatures.\nThe highest dose silicon coimplant \u00011.1\u00011015 cm\u22122\u0002\nshows the greatest effect on the Rs. Comparing values with\nand without the 1.1\u00011015 cm\u22122 silicon coimplant, it can be\nseen that the Rs is reduced by a factor \u000330 in the tempera-\nture range of 600\u2013700 \u00b0C. Hall-effect measurements show\nthat at 700 \u00b0C this reduction arises from a factor \u0003100\nimprovement in sheet hole density Ns \u0001from 3.18\u00011012 to\n2.93\u00011014 cm\u22122\u0002 and a resulting factor \u00033 decrease in mo-\nbility \u0001from 83 to 25 cm2\/V s\u0002, due to ionized impurity scat-\ntering. Low-temperature activation of boron by vacancy en-\ngineering has previously been observed by Kalyanaraman et\nal.,8 however, in that work the improvement in Nswas only a\nfactor of 2.5.\nFigure 3 shows the effects of silicon dose on diffusion at\n700 \u00b0C, corresponding to the Rs values in Fig. 2. The effect\nof a boron implant without a silicon coimplant has been\nomitted from Fig. 3 as no measurable diffusion of the boron\noccurred. By correlating this with the low level of activation\nobserved, it is concluded that at 700 \u00b0C the majority of the\nboron profile has evolved into BICs, resulting in an identical\ncurve to the as-implanted case.\nThe diffused profile after the lowest silicon dose coim-\nplant \u00014\u00011014 cm\u22122\u0002, compared to the as-implanted profile,\nshows a significant amount of diffusion, resulting in a met-\nallurgical junction depth of Xj\u000322 nm as defined at the\n3\u00011018 cm\u22123 level.

This trend continues with the\nhighest silicon dose \u00011.1\u00011015 cm\u22122\u0002 which shows a mini-\nmal amount of diffusion compared to the as-implanted\nprofile.\nAt this highest dose, the small amount of diffusion\nmakes it difficult to locate a kink in the boron atomic profile.\nTherefore, to estimate the level of activation, a differential\nHall profiling technique was used.13 Three Hall\nprofiles are shown in Fig. 4, indicating the reproducibility of\nthe technique and consistently showing a peak carrier con-\ncentration of \u00036\u00011020 cm\u22123. By integrating areas beneath\nthese curves we obtain an average value of\nNs=2.7\u00011014 cm\u22122, which is in good agreement with our\nearlier values from sheet measurements. Recently, Shao et\nal.14 have reported boron activation levels above solid solu-\nbility using a combination of preamorphization and vacancy\nengineering implants with conventional SPER. In contrast,\nthis work proves that\u2014in SOI wafers at least\u2014optimized\nvacancy engineering implants alone can achieve much\ngreater levels of activation, at much lower annealing\ntemperatures.\nBefore concluding this letter, we comment on the\nFIG. 4.

The data demonstrate a very high activation level for this low-\ntemperature process.broader potential for the use of vacancy engineering. Suc-\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tocessful application of vacancy engineering relies on prevent-\ning the majority of interstitials in the deep part of the coim-\nplant distribution from reaching the boron and deactivating\nit. This can be achieved by a complete physical barrier as in\nthe present work, by introducing traps for interstitials, by\nincreasing the stability of the interstitial defects so that they\ndissolve less, or by lowering the processing temperature. We\nbelieve that particular solutions will be found for a variety of\ndevice architectures, making vacancy engineering a flexible\nand effective method for boron activation in future device\ntechnologies.\nIn summary, optimized vacancy generating implants are\nshown to be an efficient approach to inhibiting BIC forma-\ntion. They work by reducing the supersaturation of intersti-\ntials present after the two-step sequence of a vacancy implant\nand a subsequent low-energy boron implant. This leads to a\nhighly stable highly active p-type layer without the need for\nconventional preamorphization and SPER, or the use of ad-\nvanced annealing schemes.\n1N. Cowern, K. Janssen, and H.
