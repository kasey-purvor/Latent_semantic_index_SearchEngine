Evidence supports the view that bromate is a possible human carcinogen and\nis therefore strictly controlled in drinking water (Weinberg et al, 1993; Bull and\nCottruvo, 2006). Ozonation has become increasingly important in water treatment\nacross the world as an oxidising agent and disinfectant due to its strong oxidation\npotential (von Gunten, 2003a). Ozone is used as a disinfectant in the water industry that\nis active against a wide range of microbes including more effective treatment of\nCryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia over conventional chlorine due to the increased\noxidation potential of ozone (Bull and Cottruvo, 2006). Ozone is also used at water\ntreatment works (WTW) for oxidising organic molecules such as pesticides and taste,\nodour and colour causing compounds and oxidising inorganics such as iron and\nmanganese to their insoluble form (Kasprzyk-Hordern et al., 2003).\nDisinfection by-product (DBP) formation is associated with all disinfectants and\noxidants, however, the major DBP of concern when using ozone is bromate (BrO3-), a\nDBP that forms from naturally occurring bromide (Br-) in raw water (Legube et al.,\n2004). Toxicity testing on experimental animals has consistently shown bromate to\ninduce cancer in rats, mice and hamsters through damage to genetic material (Chipman\net al., 1998 and Bull and Cottruvo, 2006). Whilst there is no data demonstrating that\nbromate is carcinogenic to humans, it is plausible to assume that the mechanisms\nresulting in tumour formation in laboratory animals could occur in humans. For this\nreason the World Health Organisation (WHO) has set a provisional guideline\nconcentration of 10 \uf06dg\/L bromate in drinking water (WHO, 2004). European Union law\nspecifies that all member states must enforce a maximum bromate concentration of 10\n\uf06dg\/L by 2008 (European Drinking Water Directive). In the UK, the legislation\nenforcing this standard came into effect in 2003. In the US, regulations also specify a\nmaximum value of 10 \uf06dg\/L (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nStage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection By-products Rule, 1998).\nThere is some evidence showing that water utilities using hypochlorite solids or liquids\nfor disinfection purposes may add up to 3 \uf06dg\/L of bromate in to drinking water as a\nresult of the formation of bromate during the manufacture of hypochlorite products\n(Weinberg et al., 2003). However, the formation of bromate during disinfection and\noxidation is generally only associated with the use of ozone as it has superior oxidising\nability over other commonly used disinfectants. In the presence of ozone, the conversion\nof bromide to bromate occurs via two complex pathways (Figure 1). The first is through\nthe direct oxidation of bromide from molecular ozone (O3) to hypobromite (BrO-),\nwhich is then further oxidised to bromate (Haag and Hoigne, 1998). The second\npathway occurs from the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH\u2022) from the\ndecomposition of molecular ozone in water. The hydroxyl radical has an even greater\noxidation potential than molecular ozone (Balakrishnan et al., 2002). The hydroxyl\n3radical converts the bromide ion to the bromide radical (Br\u2022) which is then converted to\nBrO3- through further reactions with OH\u2022 or molecular ozone.\nBromate formation has been the major barrier in the use of ozone for water treatment\nwhere the source water contains bromide, particularly given the challenging targets set\nfor the maximum allowable bromate concentration (Magazinovic et al., 2004). A\nnumber of bromate modelling tools have been developed for predicting bromate\nformation in order to provide a better understanding of when bromate regulations may\nbe exceeded at WTWs. From a health and water utility perspective, the ultimate goal of\nsuch models would be to provide a bromate formation tool capable of accurately\ncontrolling bromate formation by changing operational conditions during ozonation to\nbring bromate formation below the maximum allowable concentration.\nThe objectives of this review were to:\n- determine the important operational parameters for modelling bromate formation\n- describe and discuss empirical regression, kinetic and artificial neural network\n(ANN) bromate modelling efforts that have been developed for predicting\nbromate formation.\n- Use real historical data from a full scale WTW to determine the applicability of\nbromate formation models at full scale.\nFactors influencing bromate formation\nThe formation of bromate during ozonation is strongly dependent on the characteristics\nof the water to be treated and the amount of ozone contacting the water. The following\nlists the important variables for bromate formation:\n1) Bromide concentration\nGiven that bromide is oxidised by ozone to bromate, an increase in bromide\ninevitably leads to an increase in bromate for a constant ozone dose and contact time\n(Legube et al., 2004). Conversion of bromide to bromate is usually between 10-50\n% during ozonation (Song et al., 1996). Typical concentrations of bromide in\nnatural waters usually range from 30-200 \uf06dg\/L, with an average of 100 \uf06dg\/L (Amy\net al., 1994), however this can be greater than 500\uf020\uf06dg\/L (Legube et al., 2004). Amy\net al. (1994) have suggested that up to 30 \uf020\uf06dg\/L of bromate can form from an\naverage bromide concentration of 100 \uf06dg\/L \u2013 significantly above the target bromate\nconcentration of 10\uf020\uf06dg\/L. This equates to a 20.5 % conversion rate of bromide to\nbromate in terms of Br. Groundwater sources can have particularly high bromide\nconcentrations due to ingress by salt water, road run-off following the salting of\nroads in winter and also as a result of dissolution from sedimentary rocks\n(Magazinovic et al., 2004; Butler et al., 2005). A general conclusion by von Gunten\n(2003b) was that waters containing <20 \uf06dg\/L of bromide do not present a problem\nfor bromine-derived DBPs, whilst waters containing >100 \uf06dg\/L of bromide are\nlikely to cause significant bromate problems. The propensity to form bromate from\nbromide is therefore highly dependent on the raw water quality and source and the\ngoals of disinfection.\n42) pH\nAs the ozonation pH of the water is increased, the rate of bromate formation\nincreases (Pinkernell and von Gunten, 2001). In part, this is as a result of the\nformation of the more unstable and reactive BrO- compound at high pH as the\nequilibrium between \uf02b\uf02d \uf02b\uf0db HBrOHBrO shifts to the right as the concentration of\nhydrogen ions decreases. In addition to this, hydroxyl radical formation is promoted\nat high pH due to the increased concentration of hydroxyl ions present and the lower\nstability of ozone at high pH (Song et al., 1997; Siddiqui et al., 1998). Bromate\nformation has been shown to increase from 10 \uf06dg\/L at pH 6.5 to 50 \uf06dg\/L at pH 8.2\n(Legube et al., 2004) whilst Krasner et al. (1994) observed a 60 % decrease in\nbromate formation for each drop in pH unit. The ozonation pH is widely regarded as\nbeing the most effective bromate control strategy at WTW and should be considered\nthe best available treatment for bromate control (Ozekin and Amy, 1997). However,\nthis must be balanced by the increased formation of brominated organic compounds\nas pH is reduced (USEPA, 1999a). Additionally, the cost of pH reduction may be\nprohibitive for high alkalinity waters due to the volume of acid required (von\nGunten, 2003b).\n3) Applied ozone concentration and contact time\nAn important consideration in the conversion of bromide to bromate is the specific\ngoal of disinfection (von Gunten et al., 2001). For example, if bacteria and viruses\nare being targeted, the conversion of bromide to bromate is low. However, if\nCryptosporidium parvum oocysts are being treated, the conversion of bromide to\nbromate is high. This relates to the concentration of applied ozone (C) and the\nresidence time of the ozone (t). The efficiency of any disinfectant may be\ncharacterised by the \u2018Ct\u2019 factor (USEPA, 1999b). The relationship between bromate\nformation and Ct follows a linear function with an increase in Ct leading to an\nincrease in bromate formation (von Gunten and Hoigne, 1996 and Legube et al.,\n2004). Due to its low solubility, typical residual concentrations of ozone found at\nWTW are in the range 0.1-1 mg\/L. In order to achieve 99 % inactivation of C.\nparvum oocysts typical Ct of 3.1-48.0 mg min\/L are recommended by the USEPA\n(USEPA, 2006). The range of Ct was temperature dependent with the Ct increasing\nwith temperature (<0.5-30 \u00baC). For bacteria and virus inactivation, the Ct required to\nachieve a similar inactivation is much less. For example the Ct required to achieve a\n2-log inactivation of Escherichia coli is five orders of magnitude less than for C.\nparvum (von Gunten et al., 2001). However, Ct is dependent on temperature and the\nlog inactivation of microorganisms required. For example at 13 \u00b0C, a 3-log\ninactivation of Cryptosporidium requires a Ct of 22 mg min\/L whilst at 22 \u00b0C a\nsimilar inactivation requires a Ct of 8 mg min\/L (Galey et al., 2004). Any change in\nCt for bromate control must therefore also ensure that adequate disinfection is\nmaintained.\n4) DOC concentration\nBoth the concentration and nature of organic material in water can affect bromate\nformation. During ozonation, any natural organic matter (NOM) present in the water\ngenerally reduces bromate formation. This is because ozone and hydroxyl radicals\nare consumed by the oxidation of organic molecules and therefore taken away from\n5the bromate formation pathways. However, this is not always the case because if a\nresidual ozone concentration is required for disinfection, more ozone may need to be\nadded resulting in similar or in some cases increased concentrations of bromate. The\npresence of NOM and bromide during ozonation can also lead to the formation of\nbrominated organics. The exact identity of all of these brominated compounds has\nyet to have been fully established (and are not currently regulated for), but they are\nbelieved to be a higher risk to health than chlorine based DBP\u2019s (Song et al., 1997).\nFrom a bromate modelling point of view, the presence of NOM can be the principle\nstumbling block in producing accurate bromate formation models due to the\ncomplexity and site specific nature of NOM and its complex interactions with ozone\n(Westerhoff et al., 1998; Sohn et al., 2004). This prevents accurate knowledge of the\nprecise reactions between ozone and NOM difficult.\n5) Alkalinity\nThe presence of inorganic carbon (IC) species increases bromate formation because\nboth carbonate (CO3-2) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) species can form the carbonate\nradical (CO3-\u2022) as a result of oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (von Gunten, 2003a).\nOnce the carbonate radical has been formed, this can convert hypobromite into the\nhypobromite radical (BrO-\u2022) and then bromate (Kim et al., 2004).\n6) Ammonia concentration\nThe presence of ammonia in water acts as a scavenger of hypobromous acid (HOBr)\nduring ozonation, an important intermediate in the formation pathway of bromate\n(Pinkernell and von Gunten, 2001; von Gunten, 2003a). HOBr reacts with ammonia\nto form bromamine compounds, which, in turn, can be converted back to bromide\nthrough oxidation by ozone. Ammonia can therefore remove a significant\nintermediary from the bromate formation path and reduce the amount of bromate\nformed (Song et al., 1997). Ammonia may be present naturally in waters to be\nozonated, or alternatively can be added prior to ozonation as a bromate prevention\nstrategy. The addition of a high concentration of ammonia (1.5 mg\/L) has been\nshown to reduce bromate formation by around 5 \uf06dg\/L when applied to water\ncontaining 100 \uf06dg\/L Br- under constant conditions (Ozekin and Amy, 1997). This\nreduction, although small, may be critical for those WTW where bromate levels are\naround the maximum permitted concentration. However, this must be tempered by\nthe fact that above a certain concentration, the addition of ammonia has no further\neffect on bromate reduction. Therefore, for waters that contain naturally high to\nmedium concentrations of ammonia, the addition of further ammonia may offer no\nfurther benefit (von Gunten, 2003b). Furthermore, any un-removed ammonia may\nact as a nutrient for nitrifying bacteria once in distribution (USEPA, 1999a). An\nadditional strategy for bromate control using ammonia is combined pre-\nchlorination\/ammonia addition before ozonation. This has been shown to reduce\nbromate formation in lake Zurich water from 10 \uf06dg\/L to 2 \uf06dg\/L (conditions: Cl2 0.7\nmg\/L; NH3 400 \uf06dg\/L; 1.5 mg\/L O3; Br- 90 \uf06dg\/L) and may be a promising control\nstrategy involving lower ammonia addition to drinking water (Buffle et al., 2004).\n7) Temperature\n6Increased temperature has been shown to increase the rate of bromate formation as a\nresult of increased reaction kinetics and because the equilibrium between\n\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf0db HBrOHBrO shifts to the right as the temperature increases due to a\ncommensurate increase in the acidity constant (Legube et al., 2004). The effect of\ntemperature has been shown to be more pronounced at higher ozone doses. For\nexample, Galey et al. (2004) observed that at an ozone dose of 1 mg\/L the bromate\nformation was 8 \uf06dg\/L at both 5 and 24 \u00b0C whilst at 2.5 mg\/L the bromate formation\nwas 22 \uf06dg\/L at 5 \u00b0C and 37\uf020\uf06dg\/L at 24 \u00b0C. Bromate formation is therefore\ndependent on water temperature and remediation strategies may only need to be\nconsidered seasonally where there are big differences in the temperature of the water\nto be treated. However, it must also be considered that ozone disinfection efficacy is\nalso dependent on temperature. There is evidence showing that for some\nmicroorganisms, increased temperature results in reduced inactivation (bacteria and\nbacterial spores) whilst for C. Parvum, inactivation increased with increasing\ntemperature (von Gunten, 2001b). The proposed purpose of ozonation therefore\nneeds consideration. Increased ozone may need to be added for bacteria inactivation\nwhen the temperature is high whilst for C. Parvum lower ozone doses may be\napplied. The two different goals of disinfection will therefore also result in different\nlevels of bromate formation.\nModelling approaches\nPrevious bromate modelling papers have concentrated on empirical modelling using\nmultiple linear regression (MLR) or kinetic based models. The following section will\nreview and evaluate each of these approaches in turn.\nEmpirical models and multiple linear regression\nEmpirical modelling from existing bromate formation data has been the most widely\napplied approach to bromate formation modelling. The variables important for bromate\nformation are those mentioned previously: bromide, DOC or UV254, pH, O3 dose, NH3,\nalkalinity and temperature. The relationship of each of these variables to the output\nbromate concentration is then found experimentally by fixing all variables but one. The\nchange in bromate formation is then observed with the random variable. By carrying out\nMLR on the data (or log transformed data), the cumulative relationship and significance\nof each of the variables can be found. MLR was first applied to bromate formation by\nOzekin (1994) and, to date, most bromate formation models using MLR have been of\nthe form:\nlog Y = b0 + b1 log x1 + b2 log x2 + b3 log x3\u2026\u2026.+ bn log xn\nEquation [1]\nwhere Y is the dependent variable, xi is an independent variable and bi is the regression\ncoefficient. The following example shows the bromate formation regression model from\nSong et al. (1996):\n7log [BrO3-] = -6.11 + 0.880 log[Br-] \u2013 1.180 log[DOC] + 5.110 log[pH] + 1.420 log[O3]\n+ 0.270 log[t] \u2013 0.180 log[NH3-N] + 0.180 log[IC]\nEquation [2]\nA range of bromate formation models found in the literature of the form shown in (1)\nare included in Table 1. An alternative form of the equation has been developed by\nOzekin and Amy (1997), where not all the variables in the equation have been log\ntransformed:\nlog[BrO3-] = -3.361 + 1.136 log[Br-] \u2013 1.267 log[DOC] + 0.249 [pH] + 1.575 log[O3]\n+ 0.006 [t]\nEquation [3]\nNot all of the developed models include every one of the variables. For example,\nOzekin\u2019s original model incorporated bromide, DOC, pH, O3 dose and contact time\nwith alternative models for waters with and without ammonia addition. DOC has been\nreplaced with ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) in the model of Sohn et al.\n(2004). This was because there has been shown to be a strong correlation between the\norganic content of raw water and the UV254. Using UV254 is of advantage because UV254\nis regarded as being an easier measurement to make on-line A number of the regression\nmodels also include ammonia. This gives flexibility to water utilities depending on\nwhether they add ammonia as a bromate control measure or routinely measure ammonia\nas a water quality parameter (Ozekin and Amy, 1997).\nFor a number of the predictive regression models, bromate formation is limited in\napplication to water temperatures of 20 \u00b0C because the original experiments were\ncarried out at 20 \u00b0C (Ozekin, 1994; Song et al., 1996). Due to the reduced stability of\ndissolved ozone with increasing temperature, bromate formation increases as\ntemperature increases. Temperature is therefore of real concern for drinking water\nproduction at WTW where there is a risk of bromate formation. A survey of 47 small\nWTW in France found that 49 % of drinking water contained \u226510 \uf06dg\/L bromate in July\nin comparison to 7 % in December (Legube et al., 2002). In order for bromate formation\nmodels to be successfully applied at WTW, temperature must be factored into the model\ngiven that variations in water temperature received by a WTW can vary from season to\nseason by more than 20 \u00b0C in extreme climates (Serodes et al., 2003). Sohn et al. (2004)\nreport on a temperature correction factor for bromate formation (see Table 1) that was\ndeemed to satisfactorily adjust the bromate formation from that found at 20 \u00b0C to that at\ntemperatures between 2-24 \u00b0C. An alternative approach to this has been to incorporate\ntemperature into the regression model as an independent variable by carrying out\nbromate formation experiments at a range of temperatures (Galey et al., 1997 and\nLegube et al., 2004).\nThe relative importance of each of the variables that determine bromate formation can\nbe identified by comparison of the regression co-efficient (Song et al., 1996). A higher\npositive value gives an increased effect on bromate formation whilst an increasing\n8negative co-efficient value has a more reducing effect on bromate formation based on\nsimilar incremental contributions to the model from each variable. Analysis of the co-\nefficients presented in Table 1 shows that the parameters are of the following order of\nimportance:\nIncrease in bromate formation: pH > O3 dose > Br- > IC > time\nDecrease in bromate formation: DOC > NH3-N\nEvidently, the higher concentrations of OH- and BrO- ions at high pH are of more\nimportance than the other variables contributing to the regression equations. Because\ntemperature has only been considered in two models (Table 1), there is less certainty of\nthe overall impact that it has on bromate formation. The regression equation from\nSiddiqui et al. (1994) suggests that an increase in temperature has more of an impact on\nbromate formation than both bromide concentration and ozone dose. Work from Galey\net al. (1997) implies that it has less of a bearing than ozone dose, but more of an effect\nthan bromide concentration. However due to the increased bromate formation observed\nat WTW during summer, temperature should always be included in bromate formation\nmodels\nValidation of developed models\nIn order for bromate formation models to be considered for application at WTW, the\nmodels must be validated with real data. During most model development, the models\nhave been applied to the same type of water to those with which the models have been\ndeveloped. Although from a limited database, in these instances good correlation has\nbeen seen between the observed and predicted bromate concentrations. For example,\nSong et al. (1996) had an average R2 value of 0.93 for validation of bromate models on\nwater sources that were used to develop the model for predicted against measured\nbromate concentrations, with the regression line close to the y=x line that is indicative\nof a perfect model. Similarly good correlation was seen by Siddiqui et al. (1994) and\nOzekin and Amy (1997) with R2 values of 0.98 and 0.91 respectively. There is little\ninformation available in the literature for models applied to different waters from where\nthe model was developed. However, those that have carried out this type of \u2018external\nvalidation\u2019 have seen mixed results The data shown in Figure 2 shows the predicted\nbromate against the observed bromate from three studies (Siddiqui et al., 1994; Song et\nal., 1996; Ozekin and Amy, 1997). The authors have assessed the predicted bromate to\nthe actual bromate formation from a water that was different to that from which the\nmodel was developed. The model of Song et al. (1996) had data points very close to\ny=x, but there were only a few data points and only concentrations >20 \uf06dg\/L bromate\nhave been considered. At low concentrations, the model of Ozekin and Amy (1997) was\nnot very accurate with most bromate predictions significantly over the observed\nbromate.\nValidation of MLR models to a full scale WTWs\nThere are only a few examples in the literature of externally validating MLR models.\nFor this reason, further elucidation is required in order to assess the more widespread\n9applicability of these models at full scale. In the following section, a number of bromate\nMLR models have been applied to a common data set from a WTW in the UK.\nThe data available from the works consisted of 36 complete data sets taken over a one\nyear period for the following water and ozonation parameters: raw water bromide and\nDOC concentration, raw water UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254); ozonation pH,\ncontact time, transferred ozone dose, water temperature and final water bromate\nconcentration. Samples were taken by site scientists and sent to an accredited laboratory\nfor analysis of bromide, bromate, DOC concentration and UV254. Ozonation pH, ozone\ndose and contact time and temperature were taken from the WTWs on-line monitors and\nautomated control systems. For the model of Song et al. (1996) and Sohn et al. (2004)\nthe alkalinity of the water was estimated to be 100 mg\/L as CaCO3. This data was input\nin to the bromate formation models in Table 1 with the exception of the two ammonia\nmodels which were not assessed firstly because ammonia was not added as a bromate\nreduction strategy at the WTW and secondly the background ammonia concentration in\nthe water to be ozonated was very low (\u22640.04 mg\/L N). The output bromate\nconcentrations from the models were then plotted against the observed bromate\nconcentrations for each of the models. As can be seen from Figure 3, the predictive\nability varied from model to model.\nFrom this data, the models can be classified into three categories: models that tend to\nunder predict bromate formation (models of Siddiqui et al., 1994 and Song et al., 1996);\nmodels that tend to over predict (models of Ozekin, 1994 and Sohn et al., 2004) and\nmodels that are scattered around the observed=predicted curve (y=x) (models of Galey\net al., 1997 and Ozekin and Amy, 1997). This agrees with the validation efforts on\n\u2018real\u2019 waters that have been presented in Figure 2. The models of Galey et al. (1997)\nand Ozekin and Amy (1997) gave the most accurate predictions as the linear regression\nline through the data was close to the y=x line and the scatter around the regression line\nmuch less than that for the other two models. However, the correlation coefficients for\nthe \u2018good\u2019 models were low (R2 values of 0.34 for Galey et al. (1997) and 0.40 for\nOzekin and Amy (1997)).\nTaking the best two models in Figure 3, the models were able to follow the general\ntrend in bromate formation (as shown in Figure 4), however as shown in Figure 3, the\nmain disadvantage of the models being that individual estimates on bromate formation\ncould be very inaccurate, with some estimates approaching a difference of \u00b1100 %. The\ninaccuracy of the models was confirmed statistically using a chi-squared test to compare\nthe prediction of the models with the observed data. For both the models there was a\nvery significant difference between the modelled and actual bromate concentrations\n(Galey et al. model: \uf0632 = 70.4, p = 0.00036, Ozekin and Amy model: \uf0632 = 92.1, p =\n0.0000005) indicating that the model is a very poor fit to the data.\nWhilst the individual estimates were inaccurate even for the best fitting model, an\nindication of the model being able to assess more general trends rather than individual\n10\nestimates was given by considering how the models predict values over and under the\ncurrent EU drinking water standard for bromate (10 \uf06dg\/L) (regardless of the difference\nin individual estimates). During the actual experimental period the observed number of\nbromate values \u226510 \uf06dg\/L was 13\/36 (36.1 %). Both of the selected models were very\naccurate, with the model of Galey et al. (1997) exactly matching the observed number\nof bromate failures. The model of Ozekin and Amy (1997) was still very accurate with\nonly one extra bromate failure predicted.\nMLR summary\nThe assessment of different MLR models in this study showed that they were able to\nfollow the general trend in bromate formation well but individual estimates could be\nvery inaccurate when applied to different data sets. This tends to agree with previous\nconclusions that as the MLR models are applied to increasing numbers of raw waters,\nthe accuracy of the models decreases (Legube et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004). The\nreasons for this may be fourfold:\n1) Models have been derived from specific waters and reactor configurations.\nBromate formation has been shown to be highly influenced by NOM, not only in\nterms of its concentration, but also in its source and nature. Song et al. (1996) have\nadded NOM isolates to model waters and found that different source waters and\ndifferent MW organics produced different bromate formation models. However,\nthere was no consistent relationship for specific MW giving rise to\nincreased\/decreased bromate formation when compared from source to source. The\nfact that NOM is highly variable from site to site has lead to the conclusion that the\ntype of NOM is more important than its concentration for bromate formation (Song\net al., 1996; Ozekin and Amy, 1997). The available information on the relative\nreactivity of ozone with different types of organic compounds is limited. However,\nactivated aromatic moieties in organic pollutants have been shown to have low\ndirect reactivity with ozone (von Gunten, 2003a; Buffle and von Gunten, 2006).\nThis suggests that waters containing highly aromatic NOM may have increased\nbromate formation due to the reduced ozone consumption of these compounds.\nNOM is therefore likely to be a significant source of error in bromate formation\nmodels during more widespread application of the models. In addition, most MLR\nmodels have been developed from waters that have been spiked with bromine\n(Ozekin and Amy, 1997). Often the bromine concentrations added are unnaturally\nhigh and therefore bear little relationship to those found in the field. In light of the\nfact that permitted bromate concentrations in drinking water are heading towards 10\n\uf06dg\/L worldwide (if they are not already at this level), increased definition and\naccuracy of MLR models are required at these low concentrations which is not\ncurrently present.\n2) Boundary conditions of models may be exceeded\nEach of the MLR models was developed within a set of boundary conditions.\nOutside these ranges, the accuracy of the models has not been experimentally\nvalidated. Therefore, when the models have been applied to different data sets, there\ncan be no guarantee that the data lies within the required range. For example, in all\nof the models in Table 1, the lowest raw water bromide concentration boundary was\n11\n70 \uf06dg\/L, whilst for the utility data presented in Figure 3, the lowest bromide\nconcentration went as low as 43 \uf06dg\/L. This helps explain the inaccuracies of the\nmodels, but also highlights the need for future models to consider lower bromide\nconcentrations to improve their applicability at WTW. A further consideration must\nalso be given to WTW sites where a sidestream ozone dose is applied at high\nconcentration and then diluted in a contact tank. In these instances, the applied\nozone dose can be up to 20 mg\/L prior to dilution. The implications for bromate\nformation both in the sidestream and the contact tank have yet to have been\nanalysed, but it has been shown previously that MLR models do not accurately\npredict bromate for sidestream ozone dosing (Smith, 2002).\n3) Reactor configuration\nThe reactor configuration used in the model development tend to be different from\nstudy to study and to those utilised at WTW. In most instances, configurations have\nbeen true batch or semi-batch reactors (Siddiqui et al., 1994). In the true batch\nmode, ozone is administered into a sidestream and then introduced to the reactor for\na set period of time. In this way, all of the applied ozone is in the aqueous phase. In\nsemi-batch mode, the ozone is applied for a set amount of time directly into the\nreactor. Adopting these models for a WTW is therefore likely to lead to some error\nas ozonation is operated in the continuous mode; the scale is much greater and the\nefficiency of ozone transfer into the reactor may be different depending on diffuser\nconfiguration and operation. However, as only a small percentage of bromide is\nconverted to bromate, the reactor configuration is likely to be of less importance\nthan the previous two factors.\n4) Uncertainty in the measured variables\nIt must also be considered that there was some error associated with the actual\nmeasurements taken from the WTWs for variables that went in to the models and\nthe actual bromate measured exiting the site. This may result from natural drift of\non-line monitors, variations in flow through the WTWs, difficulties in measuring\nozone concentration and error in instruments. However, due to routine site quality\ncontrols and laboratory auditing it is unlikely that this had a significant impact on\nmodel accuracy.\nIn order to provide accurate bromate formation predictions, the empirically based\nmodels must therefore be derived experimentally for a specific water (or set of waters).\nAlternatively, given that the best selected models were able to show more general trends\nin bromate formation for a different water source to that used in the model development,\nthe models can be used as a more qualitative demonstration of the change in bromate\nformation when the input variables are changed (Ozekin and Amy, 1997; Galey et al.,\n2002). The example in Figure 5 shows the water utility data used previously, however\nhere the pH has been fixed at either pH 6, 7 or 8. This highlighted how a reduction of\npH from 8 to 6 could lead to significant reductions in bromate formation using the\nmodel of Galey et al. (1996). The decrease in bromate values >10 \uf06dg\/L was from 47 %\nat pH to 0 % at pH 6. The impact on bromate reduction was less when the ozone contact\ntime was changed from 20 to 5 minutes (Figure 6). Reducing the contact time from 20\n12\nto 5 minutes reduced the proportion of bromate failures above 10 \uf06dg\/L from 64 to 34 %.\nThis highlights the increased benefit of reducing pH over contact time as previously\nidentified from comparison of the co-efficients from the regression model. Using the\nmodels in this manner could prove to be an important tool for water treatment managers\nin order to prioritise bromate remediation strategies.\nKinetic and ozone decomposition rate modelling\nIt has been shown above that empirical modelling of bromate formation is highly\ndependent on the specific nature of the water (Kim et al., 2004). Mechanistic models\nincorporating the fundamental chemical reactions in the formation of bromate have been\ndeveloped in an attempt to overcome this problem (Westerhoff et al., 1998, Hassan et\nal., 2003; Sohn et al., 2004). Essentially, a kinetic approach models the reactions and\nrate constants (obtained experimentally or from the literature) involved in:\n1) the consumption of ozone and the conversion of ozone to radicals, and\n2) bromate formation from both direct and indirect oxidation.\nThe modelling of ozone consumption has taken a number of different approaches. A\nbasic model assumes that the hydroxyl radical alone is responsible for the conversion of\nbromide to bromate as it has been estimated that the hydroxyl radical contributes\nbetween 70-100 % of the total bromate formation (Mizuno et al., 2007). This\nrelationship is dependent on the conversion of ozone to hydroxyl radicals at different\npH:\nO3 \u2192 0.5OH\u2022 + O2\nEquation [4]\nAccurate bromate prediction has been simulated using this type of model for\nsynthetically prepared waters. However, this does not consider that other radical species\ncan form that may become available for bromate formation. A second approach\nincreases the complexity by considering all the known reactions of ozone in water at\nneutral pH, including those involving inorganic and organic carbon which consider all\noxidant radical formation (Westerhoff et al., 1998).\nThe ozone consumption models can then be combined with bromide oxidation reaction\nkinetics to predict bromate formation. During the modelling process, the reactions\ninvolved (both direct and indirect) during the bromate formation pathways and the rate\nconstants for the reaction must be identified. Increased accuracy has been achieved by\nconsidering as many possible reactions as possible that may influence bromate\nformation. Different modellers have previously used differing numbers of reactions. For\nexample Hassan et al. (2003) listed 72 separate reactions that may occur, Kim et al.\n(2004) listed 68 whilst Westerhoff et al. (1998) considered 46.\nwater\n13\nDifferential equations for each of the reactions and the associated reaction rate constants\nare then input into a computer programme along with the initial concentrations of the\nimportant chemical species involved in bromate formation. The programme then\nintegrates the differential equations together and gives solutions for the concentration of\neach species with time for ozone decay and bromate formation (von Gunten, 2003b).\nValidation of kinetic models\nThe validations of the kinetic model when NOM is absent have been shown to be\ncomparable to validations of MLR models. Westerhoff et al. (1998) compared two\nmodels: firstly, a basic model based on a single equation for the formation of hydroxyl\nradicals from ozone and secondly a more complex model involving 12 reactions for\nozone consumption and radical generation. For both models, 34 reactions were then\nsubsequently considered for bromate formation. Good fits were seen for both models\nwhen used on synthetic waters, with both having regression lines with an R2 \u2265 0.98 and\nslopes very near to a value of 1 and an intercept close to 0. However, once NOM\nisolates were added to the water, the accuracy of the models broke down with bromate\nconcentrations being over-predicted. This can be seen in Figure 7, where the predicted\nand observed bromate concentrations over time have been taken for the basic and\nsimple models. This was after the addition of three equations for NOM reacting with\nOH\u2022 radicals and hypobromite and hypobromous acid in the models.\nValidation of kinetic models on different water from that which the model has been\ndeveloped has been carried out for a synthetic water in the absence of organic material\n(Hassan et al., 2003). As can be seen in Figure 8, there was a general tendency for the\nmodel to over predict bromate formation when compared to actual values. Given that a\nsatisfactory prediction for kinetics models has currently been considered as \u00b1100 %\n(von Gunten, 2003; Hassan et al., 2004), there is still considerable work required in\norder to improve the accuracy of kinetic based models. Additionally, there is a paucity\nof detail available for low bromate concentrations that are critical for because they are\nlikely to be experienced at low concentrations at WTW.\nKinetics summary\nThe kinetics based model have shown similar or worse levels of performance to the\nMLR models giving high levels of accuracy for synthetic water in the absence of NOM.\nA more simple kinetic model has recently been developed that predicts bromate\nformation from the concentration of hydroxyl radical to dissolved ozone ratio (Mizuno\net al., 2007). Once NOM has been added to the water, the models have been ill-\nequipped to deal with the increased complexity of the systems (Westerhoff et al., 1998).\nGiven that all natural waters contain NOM, further research is required on quantifying\nthe reactions between NOM and the oxidising species present during ozonation before\nkinetic based models can be considered for application at WTW.\n14\nArtificial neural networks\nFinally, there has been one example in the literature of modelling bromate formation\nusing the relatively new modelling strategy of artificial neural networks (ANN) (Legube\net al., 2004). Whilst it is beyond the scope of this work to go into ANN with any great\ndetail, the following briefly summarises the basic steps involved in ANN modelling\n(from Lek et al., 1996). The modelling principle is based upon human neurone\noperation, with three types of neurone layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers\nand an output layer. Each neurone of the input layer is connected to the neurones of the\nhidden layer, which in turn are connected to the output neurone that corresponds to the\nvalue to be predicted. The initial input layer comprises as many neurones as there are\nvariables in the system (e.g. bromine, pH, ozone dose etc). Using computer modelling\nsoftware, the hidden and output neurones evaluate the stimulation from the previous\nneurones based on the weighting of the connections between neurones (defined by the\nmodeller). Through a series of algorithms and back-propagation, the network is trained\nuntil there is minimum error in the expected and observed values of the model. The\nmodel is then validated and tested using randomly selected data not used in the model\ndevelopment.\nANN models have the advantage of being able to consider complex input variables that\nmay not be independent of one another and where relationships between variables may\nnot be linear. Whilst there has been limited work on bromate formation using ANN,\nwork completed has shown that ANN increases the accuracy over MLR of predicting\nbromate formation for comparison of the same 20 data points by increasing the R2 co-\nefficient from 0.94 to 0.98 (Legube et al., 2004). Further work is therefore required for\nbromate formation using ANN as a useful predictive tool on real waters.\nSummary\nAs has been shown both kinetic and MLR models have limited applicability to\naccurately predict bromate formation when applied to waters that are different from\nwhere they have been developed due to the inherent variability in raw water quality\nfrom site to site. The real benefit in the general application of the models at present,\nparticularly for the MLR models, lies in a more qualitative demonstration of how\nchanging process variables such as ozone dose\/contact time, pH or ammonia addition\ncan impact on bromate formation. Rather than provide absolute bromate concentrations,\na more realistic outcome of using the models is to state that reducing a controllable\nparameter (e.g. pH, ozone contact time or dose) from x to y at a WTW will reduce the\nproportion of bromate failures (i.e. those above 10 \uf06dg\/L). However, before process\nvariables are changed, some caution is needed to ensure that the primary function of the\nozonation does not become compromised. For example, reducing ozone contact time\nmay impact on disinfection efficacy and pH changes could affect oxidation and\nprecipitation of iron and manganese.\nEach of the different bromate modelling techniques has advantages and disadvantages\nfor application to real waters at WTW (Table 2). The most accurate results to date have\n15\nbeen seen with MLR models, but this technique requires considerable time and effort\ninvestment in order to independently assess all of the variables of the model. An\nalternative approach in the development of an accurate site specific model may be to\nbuild a regression model directly from the full scale water treatment system. However,\nthe implication of not being able to control water quality variables and the limited scope\nfor changing ozonation parameters needs to be quantified using such an approach.\nKinetic models have struggled to meet the accuracy required when NOM has been\npresent in the raw water. The ANN model has shown promise, but large volumes of data\nare required to \u2018train\u2019 the model and remains an unexplored technique at present.\nConclusions\nNone of the models can be considered accurate for generically predicting bromate\nformation at WTW. Unless investment is made to develop empirical models for specific\nwaters, the current benefit of bromate formation models lie in their ability to show the\nlikely change in bromate formation when process variables are changed rather than\nprecise and highly accurate bromate predictions.\nReferences\n1.

Generic model\ninapplicable across all\ntypes of water.\n- Labour intensive to\ndevelop models\n- No evidence available\nsuggesting the technique\ncan be applied to high rate\nside stream ozone dosing\nand subsequent blending.\nKinetics - Accurate results achieved\nwhen applied to model\nwaters not containing NOM.\n- Complex understanding of\nthe reactions that occur\nduring ozonation required\n- Reactions of NOM can\ninterfere with predicted\nkinetic equations to an\nunknown degree due to the\ncomplexity of organics.\nANN - Does not assume a linear\nrelationship between input\nvariables (transformed or\notherwise)\n- Does not assume variables\nare independent of one\nanother\n- Relatively unexplored\ntechnique for bromate\nformation\n- Large amounts of data are\nrequired to \u2018train\u2019 the\nmodels.\n- Model is only as good as\nthe assumptions made by\nthe modeller.\n22\nFigure 1.
