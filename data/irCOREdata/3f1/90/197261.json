Procedures were developed for derivatising O6-MedG using unlabeled acetic anhydride. Using conventional liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) analysis, the limit of detection (LOD) for the major product, triacetylated O6-MedG, was 10\u2009fmol. On reaction of O6-MedG with 14C-acetic anhydride, using a specially designed enclosed system, the predominant product was 14C-di-acetyl O6-MedG. This change in reaction profile was due to a modification of the reaction procedure, introduced as a necessary safety precaution.
