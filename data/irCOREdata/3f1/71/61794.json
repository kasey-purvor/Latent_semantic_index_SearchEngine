Usually such 31\ndiel activity patterns are closely related to variations in the physical environment. For 32\nexample, a temperature-dependent shift in diel activity is supposed to be a consequence of 33\nhigher predation risk in cold water (Webb, 1978; Fraser et al., 1995). Changes in diel activity 34\npatterns have been related to the light intensity and duration corresponding with the daytime 35\n(Harvey & Nakamoto, 1999), season (David & Closs, 2003) or the moon phase (Hork\u00fd et al.,36\n2006). However, other environmental conditions, such as the influence of water turbidity 37\n(Benfield & Minello, 1996; Sweka & Hartman, 2003) and water flow conditions, may have an 38\neffect (Harvey & Nakamoto, 1999; Slav\u00edk et al., 2007).39\nIde, Leuciscus idus (L.), is a species of benthopelagic, riverine cyprinid inhabiting 40\ndeeper, slower flowing reaches of lowland middle-sized rivers east of the Rhine basin in 41\nEurope to Siberia (Maitland & Campbell, 1992). It achieves a maximum size of 53 cm total 42\nlength (LT), a body mass of 2.0 kg, and a recorded age of 14 years. Ide are visually oriented 43\nfeeders and predominantly consumes insects, although coarse fish or plant material might be 44\noccasionally consumed (Cala, 1970). Ide spawn in spring and belonging to the phyto-45\nlithophilic spawning group (Balon, 1975). Their migratory pattern has been described as 46\npotamodromous with a prevailing upstream migration (Cala, 1970; M\u00fcller, 1986). According 47\nto Winter & Fredrich (2003), who observed migrations of ide in the middle reaches of the 48\nRiver Elbe in Germany and the River Vecht in the Netherlands, ide is a flexible species 49\ncapable of adapting its movement pattern to different conditions of river systems. To 50\ninvestigate within catchment variation in the migratory patterns of ide we tracked the 51\n3movements of individuals in a low stream order, upstream section of the Elbe River, closer to 52\nthe source than previous investigations (Winter & Fredrich, 2003). To assess which 53\nenvironmental factors influence the migration and diurnal behaviour of ide, 17 specimens 54\nwere radio-tracked weekly from September 2003 to September 2004 in the Elbe River, Czech 55\nRepublic.56\n57\nMATERIALS AND METHODS58\n59\nSTUDY AREA60\nThe study was carried out on the upper part of the River Elbe, Czech Republic. The 61\nriver rises at 1383 m above sea level. It has a total length of 1091 km with a catchment area of 62\n148,268 km2. The Czech portion of the river is 368 km long and has a catchment area of 63\n51,394 km2. The primary river stretch studied was about 40 km long, from the weir at St\u0159ekov 64\n(distance from the source 320 km; 50\u00b038\u2032 N; 14\u00b003\u2032 E) to the frontier with Germany (Fig. 1). 65\nDuring spawning migrations, the stretch studied was extended as far as Meissen, Germany 66\n(distance from the source 410 km; 51\u00b0 81' N; 13\u00b0 28' E) as fish were followed. The river 67\nwidth in the area studied was 100 to 150 m, and the riverbanks have little aquatic vegetation 68\nand are reinforced with rocks and concrete. The water was up to 6 m deep and no submergent 69\nvegetation or floating plants were recorded. Across the whole study period, the average flow 70\nwas 293 m3 s-1, with the maximum in winter (748 m3 s-1) and the minimum in early autumn 71\n(79 m3 s-1).72\n73\nFISH CAPTURE AND TAGGING74\nFish were sampled by electrofishing (650 V, 4 A, pulsed D.C.) and seventeen 75\nindividuals were radio tagged. All fish were caught and released at 5 km long river stretch 76\n4(Fig. 1). The individuals were measured to the nearest mm (mean standard length 378 mm LS, 77\nranging from 285 to 450 mm) and weighed to the nearest g (mean fish body mass 755 g, 78\nranging from 450 to 1240 g). Fish were anaesthetized with 2-phenoxy-ethanol (0.2 ml l-1). 79\nRadio transmitters (MCFT 3B, 11 g in air, 14 x 43 mm, with an operational life estimated to 80\nbe 399 days; MCFT 3EM, 8.9 g in air, 11 x 49 mm, with an operational life estimated to be 81\n278 days; Lotek Engineering, Inc., Canada) were implanted into the body cavity through a 82\nmidventral incision that was closed by three separate stitches, using a sterile, braided, 83\nabsorbable suture (Ethicon Coated Vicryl). The mass of the transmitter never exceeded 2 % of 84\nthe fish body mass in the air (Winter, 1983). Fish were held until they had recovered their 85\nequilibrium and showed spontaneous swimming activity (c. 5 min. after surgery), then 86\nreleased close to the site of capture. The transmitters had external antennae and their potential 87\nrange was approximately 300 m depending on the gain of receiver and tracking conditions.88\n89\nSAMPLING PROCEDURES90\nAll fish were tracked from a boat weekly during the period from 11 September 2003 to 91\n21 September 2004. Once all the fish were positioned, one individual was randomly chosen 92\nfor a 24h tracking cycle. Fish positions were determined once in each three-hour period over a 93\ndiel cycle (0600 \u2013 0859, 0900 \u2013 1159, 1200 \u2013 1459, 1500 \u2013 1759, 1800 \u2013 2059, 2100 \u2013 2359, 94\n2400 \u2013 0259, 0300 \u2013 0559 hours) using a GPS receiver. The interval between measurements 95\nvaried slightly depending on the tracking conditions (3 hours \u00b1 20 min.). The fish were 96\nlocated using landmarks and positioned with the help of a GPS (GPS map 76S, Garmin Ltd., 97\nUSA) using two radio receivers (Lotek SRX_400 receiver firmware versions W5 and W31) 98\nand three-element Yagi antennas equipped with a compass. The fish direction was determined 99\nby the double lateral extinction technique (bearing on the bisecting line of the two extinction 100\naxes; Winter et al., 1978). A computer program was developed to obtain fish position 101\n5coordinates and plot them on the map using the biangulation method proposed by White & 102\nGarrot (1990).  103\n104\nHABITAT MEASUREMENT105\nWater temperature (\u00b0C), dissolved oxygen concentration (mg l-1), conductivity (\u03bcS), pH, and 106\nturbidity (NTU) were measured by microprocessors (Oxi 196; pH\/Cond 340i\/SET; TURB 107\n355 T; WTW, Germany). Light intensity (Ev) was measured by a SECONIC Super Zoom 108\nMaster L-68 (Seconic, Tokyo, Japan) at the expected locations of individuals during each 109\npositioning. Measurements of the atmospheric pressure and the moon phase were conducted 110\nwith help of the Remote Weather station BAR 928 H (Huger Electronics, Germany). The Elbe 111\nRiver Authority measured water flow daily at a gauging station located within the study 112\nstretch. 113\n114\nDATA ANALYSES115\nShort term movements were defined as the distance (m) between the fish positions determined 116\nin two subsequent three-hour intervals over a 24 hour cycle and are henceforth referred to as 117\n\u201cdiurnal movements\u201d. Although the fish were located every time, in several cases the signal 118\nwas so weak that triangulation could not be precise: These occasions were excluded from 119\nfurther analysis. Longer term movements were determined from the difference (m) between120\nthe locations of a fish in two successive week intervals and, henceforth, are referred to as 121\n\u201clongitudinal movements\u201d. Data on fish movements were analyzed using Map Source Version 122\n5.3 (Garmin Ltd., USA). The sizes of home ranges were determined using the Minimum 123\nConvex Polygon method (Mohr, 1947). Fish that were used for home range analyses were 124\nsuggested to occupy home range; i.e. fish could not move during two subsequent weeks in the 125\nlongitudinal direction more than its usual extent of diurnal movements across the twenty-four-126\n6hour cycle. Furthermore, fish that moved for the whole twenty-four-hour cycle in only one 127\ndirection (upstream or downstream) was suggested to exhibit a mobile or emigration phase of 128\na home range shift and was subsequently excluded from the analyses. Data concerning light 129\nintensity were first entered into the analysis as the absolute values of illumination (1 Ev \uf040 5 130\nlx; y = 0.6211e0\u00b76943x, where y = lx, x = Ev), referred to as \u2018intensity of illumination\u2019. 131\nFurthermore, three intervals with different light intensity were determined across the twenty-132\nfour-hour cycle: twilight (light intensity ranged between 1 \u2013 6 Ev), day (above 6 Ev), and 133\nnight (below 1 Ev); in further analysis, these categories will be referred to as \u2018light intervals\u2019. 134\n135\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES  136\nAssociations between the variables were tested using the Linear Mixed Model (LMM). 137\nSeparate models were applied for the following dependent variables: diurnal movements 138\n(LMM I), home range size (LMM II) and longitudinal movements (LMM III). All of the data 139\nwere square root transformed to achieve normality before analyses. To account for the 140\nrepeated measurements of the same individuals across the period of observation, analyses 141\nwere performed using mixed model analysis with individual fish and date nested within 142\nindividual fish (LMM I, II) and individual fish and date nested within individual fish (LMM 143\nIII) as a random factors, using PROC MIXED (SAS, version 9.1).144\nPROC MIXED is the way to cope with repeated-measures experiments with people or 145\nanimals as subjects, where subjects are declared random because they are selected from the 146\nlarger population to which you want to generalize (SAS Institute Inc., 2004). For the LMM I 147\nmodel, fixed effect used were the classes \u2018moon phase\u2019 (8 levels), \u2018season\u2019 (spring, summer, 148\nautumn, winter), and \u2018light interval\u2019 (day, night, twilight), and the continuous variables were 149\n\u2018turbidity\u2019 (range 5.5 \u2013 44 NTU), \u2018fish mass\u2019 (1293\u20133946 g), \u2018water temperature\u2019 (0\u201324 \u00baC), 150\n\u2018water flow\u2019 (79\u2013748 m3 s-1), \u2018atmospheric pressure\u2019 (992\u20131033 hPa), \u2018conductivity\u2019 (332\u2013151\n7425 \u03bcS), \u2018light intensity\u2019 (0 \u2013 15.1 Ev), and \u2018dissolved oxygen\u2019 (5.5\u201312.9 mg l\u20131). For the 152\nLMM II - III models, fixed effects used were the same as for the LMM I model except for the  153\n\u2018light interval\u2019 (day, night, twilight) and \u2018light intensity\u2019 (0 \u2013 15.1 Ev) that were excluded 154\nfrom the analyses. The significance of each fixed effect (including interactions) in the 155\nanalyses was assessed by the F-test, upon sequential dropping of the least significant effect, 156\nstarting with a full model. Fixed effects and their interactions that were not statistically 157\nsignificant are not discussed further. In unbalanced designs with more than one effect, the 158\narithmetic mean for a group may not accurately reflect the response for that group, since it 159\ndoes not take other effects into account. Therefore, the least-squares-means (LSMEANs) were 160\nused. LSMEANs (further referred to as \u2018adjusted means\u2019) are, in effect, within-group means 161\nappropriately adjusted for the other effects in the model. Adjusted means (Adj P) were 162\ncomputed for each class; differences between classes were tested by the t-test. For multiple 163\ncomparisons, we used the Tukey-Kramer adjustment. Associations between the dependent 164\nvariable and other continuous variables were estimated by fitting a random coefficient model 165\nusing PROC MIXED as described by Tao et al. (2002). With this random coefficient model, 166\nwe calculated predicted values for the dependent variable and plotted them against the 167\ncontinuous variable with predicted regression lines. The degrees of freedom were calculated 168\nusing the Kenward-Roger method (Kenward & Roger, 1997).169\n170\n171\nRESULTS172\n173\nFinal LMM models contained the fixed factors \u2018turbidity\u2019 for diurnal movements (LMM I), 174\n\u2018turbidity\u2019 and \u2018season\u2019 for home range area size (LMM II), and \u2018season\u2019 for longitudinal 175\nmovements (LMM III). Details of the models are shown in Table I. Descriptive data of the 176\n8extent of diurnal movements, longitudinal movements, total distance migrated during 177\nspawning and home range per individual are provided in Table II. The other environmental 178\nvariables tested (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, atmospheric 179\npressure, moon phase and light intensity) were not found to have a significant effect. 180\n181\nDIURNAL MOVEMENTS AND HOME RANGE SIZE OF IDE182\nDuring the whole study fish did not remain at one exact position, however they occupied 183\ndefined home ranges between which they relocated (e.g. during spring migration). Mean 184\nhome range size was 19,495.8 \u00b1 13,890.9 m2 (Table II), but both diurnal movement and home 185\nrange size appeared to vary in a consistent manner. Repeated measurements indicated that 186\nboth diurnal movement [Fig. 2(a)] and the home range size [Fig. 2(b)] of ide increased with 187\nincreasing turbidity. The relationship between flow and turbidity was not statistically 188\nsignificant; increased turbidity was a consequence of both surface run-off and phytoplankton 189\ngrowth. Home range size was significantly smaller (Tukey-Kramer Adj. P < 0.05) during 190\nwinter than other seasons [Fig. 3(a)]. 191\nFinal GLMM I model indicated the influence of the light interval nested within season on 192\nthe diurnal movements of ide (Table I); however, differences among classes were 193\ninsignificant, and hence the character of dependence was not possible to determine (Tukey-194\nKramer Adj. P > 0.05).195\n196\nLONGITUDINAL MOVEMENTS OF IDE 197\nLongitudinal movements of the ide were significantly larger (Tukey-Kramer Adj. P < 0.01) in 198\nthe spring, with non-significant differences among other seasons [Fig. 3(b)]. Almost all 199\nindividuals, with one exception, displayed downstream spring migrations, most of them 200\nremaining within Czech part of Elbe River (40 km long; Fig. 1). Six individuals moved to 201\n9near the confluence of the River B\u00edlina at \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem, including one individual that 202\nmoved 19 km upstream to reach this spot (the only upstream migrating individual). Four 203\nindividuals moved downstream to near the town of Mal\u00e9 B\u0159ezno and a further two to near the 204\nborder with Germany. Five individuals undertook longer migrations (68 \u2013 100 km) to reach 205\nspawning sites near Dresden and Meissen in the German part of River Elbe (Fig. 1). The 206\nindividuals that undertook longest migration started their run earliest, at the end of February. 207\nAll final destination of migration were shallower riffles with a gravel substrate. Later in the 208\nseason, ide displayed homing behaviour and returned to within 0.5 \u2013 2 km of the starting 209\nposition.210\n211\nDISCUSSION212\n213\nBehaviour of visually oriented animals is known to be affected by visibility, as they rely on 214\nvisual cues for orientation and feeding. In aquatic ecosystems, the visibility is determined not 215\nonly by the light intensity but also by the water turbidity (Benfield & Minello, 1996). 216\nTurbidity imposes a considerable environmental constraint with a potential to affect whole 217\nfish communities (Colby et al., 1972; Diehl, 1988). It may shape the habitat choice patterns 218\n(Miner & Stein, 1996), social interactions (Valdimarsson & Metcalfe, 2001) or reproductive 219\nbehaviour of the fish, in terms of reduced sexual selection (J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2004; 220\nHeubel & Schlupp, 2006). Increased turbidity influences visually-oriented fish by decreasing 221\ntheir visual range (Utne-Palm, 2001), typically affecting foraging efficiency by reducing the 222\ndistance at which a predator detects prey (Benfield & Minello, 1996; Sweka & Hartman, 223\n2003). Benfield & Minello (1996) evaluated the influence of turbidity on predation rates of 224\ngulf killifish, Fundulus grandis Baird and Girard, and that significantly fewer prey were 225\nconsumed in tanks containing turbid water. Brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis L., become 226\n10\nmore active in higher turbidity, thus increasing the chance of encountering potential prey by 227\nenlarging the total volume of water searched (Sweka & Hartman, 2001a). Hence, we suggest 228\nthat ide extend their diurnal movements and home range size as a result of the reduced 229\nforaging success in turbid water. 230\nIn riverine systems, increased turbidity is usually associated with increased flow 231\nduring hydrologic events (Sahoo et al., 2006). However, low discharge may have the opposite 232\neffect: increased water residence time during low water flow may allow the buildup of 233\nphytoplankton biomass (Lane et al., 2007). Here there was no significant relationship between 234\ndischarge and turbidity, suggesting both potential sources and that the behaviour of ide was 235\ninfluenced by the water turbidity per se. Home range size varied consistently with season and 236\nturbidity. The influence of turbidity is likely to due to its effect on visibility. Reduced diurnal 237\nmovement in winter may be due to lower food availability and\/or temperature related 238\nmetabolism. 239\nThe winter season is a period of reduced activity in cyprinid fish (Bauer & Schlott, 240\n2004). They tend to remain in areas with the most appropriate conditions for wintering, as 241\nwas shown for example in bream Abramis brama L. migrating into lentic refugia (Molls & 242\nNeumann, 1994). A restricted home range may be a direct consequence of a reduced 243\nmetabolic rate linked to low temperatures as well as a result of efficient energy conservation 244\nor the use of locally restricted refuge during harsh conditions (Brown & Mackay, 1995; 245\nHiscock et al., 2002).246\nMany freshwater fish species, including cyprinids, undertake long distance migrations 247\nduring the breeding season (Baras & Cherry 1990; Lucas 2000). Previous reports of ide 248\nindicated an upstream pre-spawning migration followed by downstream movement after 249\nspawning (Cala, 1970; M\u00fcller, 1986), including studies in the middle reaches of the River 250\nElbe (Winter & Fredrich, 2003). In contrast, we observed that ide undertook similar long 251\n11\ndistance migrations in spring but in the opposite direction, i.e. downstream during spring and 252\nreturning upstream towards formerly occupied areas later in the season. These findings are 253\npartly consistent with Cala (1970) from K\u00e4vlinge\u00e5n in Sweden, where ide also displayed large 254\ndownstream migration in spring. However, the latter case is more complicated as the fish 255\nmigrated downstream to coastal waters in the spring, where they remained for the consecutive 256\nsummer, only returning to the river in autumn (Cala op. cit.). Such inconsistency in the 257\ndirection of migration may indicate that the movements of fish are shaped by multiple factors 258\nthat vary even within river systems. An obvious constraint is the presence of lateral 259\nobstructions that hamper fish migration (Lucas & Frear, 1997; Hork\u00fd et al., 2007), although 260\nin our study no fish were observed to move to the vicinity of the weir at Strekov during spring 261\nmigration. The location of suitable spawning areas (Pollux et al., 2006) and channel 262\nmorphology (Lau et al., 2006) may also be essential.  263\nAlthough ide are declining in numbers, classified as vulnerable by IUCN Red List 264\ncriteria (2001) and protected as an endangered species (Lusk et al., 2004), few references 265\nregarding its behaviour exist (Cala 1970; Winter & Fredrich 2003). Our data demonstrate that 266\nthe turbidity may substantially influence the movement patterns of this species. As turbidity is 267\ninfluenced by both eutrophication and changes in land-use (Duchrow & Everhart, 1971), and 268\nincreased turbidity has a negative effect on foraging success and growth of fish (Sweka & 269\nHartman 2001a; Sweka & Hartman 2001b), eutrophication of the river catchment could be an 270\nimportant negative influence on ide abundance and distribution.271\nOur findings further indicate that their migratory behaviour is shaped by multiple factors that 272\nvary even within river systems. Whilst encouragingly this may indicate a degree of plasticity 273\nin the species, more work is needed to understand the factors influencing these migrations and 274\nhence direct conservation efforts to improve the breeding success of the remaining 275\npopulations.276\n12\n277\nAcknowledgements: 278\nThe authors wish to thank A.
