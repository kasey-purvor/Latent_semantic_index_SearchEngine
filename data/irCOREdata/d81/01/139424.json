In this paper, we describe a label-free\nnanobiosensor for bovine serum albumin (BSA). Nano-porous silicon produced in our\nlaboratory was functionalised prior to immobilisation of anti-BSA antibody on the\nsurface. Reaction with BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer resulted in an\nimpedance change which was inversely proportional to the concentration of the\nanalyte. The system PBS buffer\/antigen-antibody\/PS constitutes an\nelectrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure, thus furnishing an impedance EIS\nnanobiosensor. The linear range of the sensor was 0-0.27mg mL -1and the sensitivity\nwas less than 10\u03bcg mL-1.\nKeyword\uff1a nano-porous silicon; nanobiosensor; electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor;\nimpedance\n31. Introduction\nNano-porous silicon (PS) has received considerable recent attention for\nincorporation into biosensors due to its intrinsic optic and electrical properties and its\nlarge surface area, which can be readily functionalised (Zhang et al. 2007). Lin et al.\n(Lin et al. 1997) reported an optical interferometric biosensor based on porous silicon, which\nwas capable of detecting a wide range of analytes with low detection limits. A capacitive catalytic\nbiosensor has also been described with sensitivity for penicillin of around 0.25mM (Thust et al.\n1999). The authors highlighted the large amount of immobilised enzyme associated with the\nporous structures. Chan and co-workers designed a DNA sensor using a Bragg reflector. When a\nbiological molecule attached to the large internal surface of the porous silicon, a change in\nrefractive index was detected by the shift in the luminescence peaks (Chan et al. 2001). In 2007,\nwe reported a simple, label-free optical sensor for BSA. The detection principle was\nbased on the change in light intensity associated with the interaction of protein\nmolecules with the nano-PS surface (Zhang et al. 2007).\nSensors for biological analytes based on electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor\n(EIS) structures have been reported since the late 1990s (Brett et al. 2001; Berney et al.\n1999; Schoning et al. 2002; Bergveld et al. 2003; Schoning et al. 2005; Poghossian et al.\n2006). The EIS structure is similar to the metal-insulator- semiconductor (MIS), but\nthe metal contact on the insulator is replaced by an electrolyte contact, to which a\nvoltage is applied by means of a reference electrode. However, very few articles have\naddressed EIS biosensors using PS. Porous EIS structures of n-Si\/SiO2\/Si3N4 have\n4been realised for capacitive pH sensors. The average pH sensitivity of the porous pH\nsensor amounts to about 56 mV\/pH in the range between pH 4 and pH 8. The study\nalso utilised penicillinase as a model enzyme to prepare a porous EIS biosensor and\nthe sensitivity reported was around 0.25 mM (Schoning et al. 2000). Betty and\nco-workers (Betty et al. 2004; Betty et al. 2007) described the fabrication and\ncharacterisation of capacitive biosensors with EIS structures and conducted a time\nresponse study. They found that there was a rapid decrease in capacitance following\naddition of the analyte to the PS sensor.\nIn the present work, we describe an impedance immunosensor based on porous\nEIS technology comprising a PBS buffer\/antibody-antigen\/PS structure. The specific\nreaction of the antigen (BSA) to the immobilized antibody (antiserum of BSA) caused\na change in impedance that could be monitored on-line. The sensitivity of the\nelectro-PS biosensor was also investigated.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 PS preparation\nNano-porous silicon was obtained from p-type Si(100) with a specific\nresistance \u03c1=0.15-0.2 \u03a9.cm, using an electrochemical etching process at 220 mA\/cm2\nfor 20 minutes in 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. The PS chip was then treated\nwith H2O2 to oxidize the PS surface (Zhang et al. 2007).\n52.2 Antibody immobilisation\nThe Anti-BSA antibody (from Dingguo company) immobilisation was carried\nout by immersing 0.5cm2 PS chips into antibody solution for one hour at room\ntemperature. After thoroughly washing with PBS, the nonspecific sites were blocked\nwith 2mg\/ml Ovalbumin, then washed again with PBS thoroughly.\nThe antibody immobilisation on the porous silicon matrix was confirmed by\nJSPM-5200 atomic force microscopy from JEOL, Japan.\nThe activity of the immobilised antibody was visualized using BSA - colloidal\ngold .\nThe gold nanoparticles were produced by dissolving H[AuCl4], the solution was\nrapidly stirred while a reducing agent was added. This caused Au3+ ions to be reduced\nto neutral gold atoms, and the gold gradually starts to precipitate in the form of\nsub-nanometer particles. If the solution is stirred vigorously enough, the particles will\nbe fairly uniform in size.\nThe antigen colloidal gold labeling was taken by the electrostatic interaction\nbetween Au clusters and the protein amino group. The BSA- colloidal gold was\nprepared by mixing colloidal gold suspension with 0.1M BSA solution. After\nseparation, the BSA- colloidal gold was applied on the antibody-PS and on the free\nPS without antibody, but where the protein binding sites were blocked with\nOvalbumin. If the immobilised antibody was active, the BSA - colloidal gold bound to\nthe antibody-PS and presented a dark red color. In contrast, the colour of the free PS\nwas light.\n62.3 BSA determination using the impedance method\nThe impedance analysis was performed using an LK2005A electrochemical\nwork station (supplied by Lanlike Co Ltd, Tianjin, China). The system consisted of an\nAg\/AgCl reference electrode, the antibody-immobilised PS chip as the working\nelectrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The buffer was 0.015M PBS, pH 7.4.\nThe impedance was measured with the substrate bias voltage range of 0.15V to 0.29V.\nThe analysis commenced with 10ml of 0.015M PBS buffer and then serial\nconcentrations of BSA (0.01\uff0c0.02\uff0c0.04\uff0c0.08\uff0c0.1 mg\/ml) were added into the system.\nThe impedance versus BSA concentration was plotted.\nThe selectivity of the antibody-PS was also identified with ovalbumin (OVA). At\nthe same condition, the same concentration of ovalbumin (OVA) and the BSA were\nadded into the system to react with the antibody-PS, and then the changes of\nimpedance were collected.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1 Confirmation of the presence of immobilised antibody\nIn order to confirm the antibody was immobilised on the PS chip the\nantibody-immobilised PS and the free PS chips were scanned with a atomic force\nmicroscopy (figure 1). It shows that the antibody immobilised PS chip (figure 1b) is\nmore than triple thicker than the free chip (figure 1a). This reveals that the antibody\nhas been immobilised on the porous silicon matrix.\n7The activity of the antibody on the chip was determined by reacting the chips\nwith BSA-colloidal gold. As shown in figure 2, fig 2 a is darker than fig 2 b. This\nreveals that the BSA-colloidal gold had bound to the antibody-immobilised PS chip\nand the antibody activity was retained.\n3.2 Comparison of impedance changes with antibody- immobilised and free PS\nPlots of the impedance versus voltage, before and after the deposition of the\nantibody layer, are presented in Figure 3 a. The deposition of the antibody layer led to\na decrease in impedance. The decrease in impedance is thought to be due to a change\nin dielectric constant after antibodies were immobilised on the PS surface (Figure 3 b).\nThe electrolyte used for the measurements was 0.015M PBS.\n3.3 BSA determination\nThe selectivity of the antibody-PS was checked with OVA. When the\nBSA-antibody-PS reacted with the same concentration of BSA and OVA, the\nreduction of impedance with BSA is about 60% larger than with OVA (figure 4).\nTherefore, the biosensor has a significant and specific selectivity.\nFigure 5 shows the impedance versus voltage plots of the PS sensors after\nequilibration with different BSA concentrations for 1 minute, and the total impedance\nis decreased after adding BSA.\nBy fixing the applied potential during in the accumulation of protein at 0.29V, the\nimpedance varied inversely with the concentration of the analyte, BSA (Figure 6).\n8The detection limit is 10 mg\/ml. it equals 3 _ SD of zero calibrator. Furthermore,\nFigure 6 illustrates that the linear range of the sensor is between 0-0.27mg\/ml.\nThe material used in the literatures is mainly plain silicon. Our material is Nano-porous\nsilicon, it has many advantages, such as it possess of a large surface area with optical and\nelectrical signals. The novelty of the work is to combine the nano-porous silicon\nproperties with the biosensor technology to produce a label free nano-biosensor with a\nlinear range of 0.01-0.08mg\/ml. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 10\u03bcg\/ml.\n4. Conclusion\nNano-porous silicon multilayered microstructures have unique optical, electronic\nand morphological properties that can be exploited in chemical and biological sensing.\nThe large specific surface of nano-structured porous silicon can be chemically\nmodified to link different molecular probes, which recognise the target analytes. In\norder to enhance the sensitivity and simplicity of this as a sensor device, we have\nproduced and characterised several porous silicon-based structures (Zhang et al. 2007).\nIn this paper, we developed a label free nanobiosensor for bovine serum albumin\n(BSA) determination. Using functionalized PS with immobilised anti-BSA antibody\nwe showed that the impedance decreased on binding the complimentary antigen and\nthat the linear range of the sensor was between 0-0.27mg\/ml. The minimum\ndetectable amount of antigen was less than 10\u03bcg\/ml.\n9Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thanks the Ministry of Education, the Tianjin\nMunicipalScience and Technology Commission (09ZCZDSF04200 and\n09ZXCXGX17100), and Tianjin University of Science and Technology for supporting\nthis work.\nReferences\nBergveld, P. 2003.
