The finding that increased incomes do not lead to greater happiness is an average (non)effect\u2014and migrants might be exceptional in this regard, gaining happiness from increased incomes to a greater extent than most people. The analysis here, using data from the World Values Survey, finds that the association between income and happiness is indeed stronger for immigrants in the USA than for natives\u2014but even for immigrants that association is still relatively weak. The discussion then considers this finding in light of the fact that immigrants also report lower levels of happiness than natives after controlling for other variables","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/9517","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/9517\/1\/Income%2c%20migration%20and%20happiness%203.pdf","pdfHashValue":"8ea253e2e727c6c38fbc51ea59161cf5184ab12c","publisher":"Springer Verlag","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/9517<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2015-12-10T10:10:39Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_43<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9551<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_427<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nEconomic Migration and Happiness: Comparing Immigrants\u2019 and Natives\u2019 Happiness Gains From Income<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nBartram, David<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\nHappiness\/life satisfaction<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nInternational migration<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nIncome<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\nThis is the author's final draft of the paper published as Social Indicators Research, 2011, 103 (1), pp. 57-76.

This finding can be taken to imply that economic migration \nmight fail to result in increased happiness for the migrants: migration as a means of \nincreasing one\u2019s income might be no more effective in raising happiness than other \nmeans of increasing one\u2019s income.  This implication is counterintuitive: it suggests that \nmigrants are mistaken in believing that economic migration is a path to improving one\u2019s \nwell-being, at least to the extent that well-being means (or includes) happiness.  This \npaper considers a scenario in which it is less likely that migrants are simply mistaken in \nthis regard.  The finding that increased incomes do not lead to greater happiness is an \naverage (non)effect \u2013 and migrants might be exceptional in this regard, gaining \nhappiness from increased incomes to a greater extent than most people.  The analysis \nhere, using data from the World Values Survey, finds that the association between \nincome and happiness is indeed stronger for immigrants in the USA than for natives \u2013 \nbut even for immigrants that association is still relatively weak.  The discussion then \nconsiders this finding in light of the fact that immigrants also report lower levels of \nhappiness than natives after controlling for other variables.  \n \nKey words: happiness\/life satisfaction; international migration; income\n1 Introduction \nThere are good reasons to suspect that economic migrants \u2013 those who are motivated mainly \nby the prospect of higher incomes \u2013 might end up disappointed after gaining entry to a \nwealthy country.  Though perhaps counterintuitive, this possibility emerges quite plausibly \nfrom consideration of the more general relationship between happiness and income: income \nis indeed related to happiness, but only weakly, and in pursuing greater incomes via \nmigration migrants might unwittingly make sacrifices in relation to other factors that are \nmore important for happiness.  Even economic factors such as income might not work in \neconomic migrants\u2019 favor: while migrants to wealthy countries can typically gain higher \nincomes in absolute terms, their relative position is likely to be lower, particularly to the \nextent that migration leads to settlement and their \u201creference group\u201d comes to include \nothers in the destination country.  More generally, while people in wealthy countries are on \naverage happier than people in poorer countries, this cross-sectional fact does not by itself \nmean that migration to the former leads reliably to increased happiness for migrants. \n Even so, it is disconcerting to imagine that economic migrants are mistaken in their \nbeliefs about the benefits of migration, as the previous paragraph implies.  In some \nconventional perspectives \u2013 particularly the \u201crevealed preferences\u201d assumption of neo-\nclassical economics \u2013 the very fact that some people choose to engage in migration is \nsufficient evidence that they are indeed better off for having done so.  Happiness studies \nadopts a different approach to defining and measuring \u201cbetter off\u201d, rejecting revealed \npreferences.  But the fact that pessimistic implications about economic migration can be \nderived from happiness studies is likely to provoke substantial skepticism: surely those who \nseek a better life in the world\u2019s prosperous countries are not fundamentally misguided in \ndoing so?! \n Research on internal migration suggests that migrants within Thailand were indeed \nless satisfied with their lives after migration (De Jong et al. 2002; see Michalos 1996 on \ninternal migration more generally).  Direct empirical testing of the notion that international \neconomic migration leads to disappointment is not possible with existing data, however.  The \nappropriate form of analysis would require a panel dataset that collects data from migrants \n 2 \nbefore and after migration (and includes questions about happiness).  But large data \ncollection efforts (even coordinated surveys conducted in many countries) are still in the \nmain nationally-bounded enterprises that inhibit longitudinal analysis of international \nmigration almost by definition.  Immigrants can become part of, say, an American dataset \nafter arrival, but a typical American dataset will not contain data collected from immigrants \nprior to their leaving their country of origin.1\n In lieu of a more direct approach to the question, this paper therefore adopts an \nindirect approach that considers a more optimistic scenario in which it is less likely that \neconomic migrants are simply mistaken about the happiness consequences of migration to a \nwealthy country.  This scenario begins by revisiting the widespread perception in happiness \nstudies that income in an \u201cabsolute\u201d sense (as against relative income, on which more \nbelow) is only weakly related to happiness.  This core happiness studies finding emerged first \nin the \u201cEasterlin paradox\u201d (1974) and was the subject of a recent article by Ball and Chernova \n(2008) (with a great many intervening publications, summarized in Diener and Biswas-Diener \n2002 and Graham 2009).   \n  Likewise, emigration is one of the mechanisms \nthat lead panel members to disappear from the panel and become \u201cmissing\u201d.  An alternate \nstrategy \u2013 comparing \u201cstayers\u201d to emigrants in a cross-sectional analysis \u2013 would be possible \nin principle using coordinated international datasets such as the World Values Survey (WVS).  \nEven if one can use the WVS to compare the happiness of, say, Poles in the UK to that of \nPoles in Poland, however, a cross-sectional analysis of this type would fail to address \nquestions of selection and reverse causation, i.e., are happier people more inclined to \nemigrate vs. does migration lead to increases in happiness. \n The main hypothesis considered here is that this generally weak association between \nabsolute income and happiness is different \u2013 stronger \u2013 for those who choose to engage in \neconomic migration.  Ball and Chernova\u2019s finding of a weak relationship is an average \nassociation for the general population.  As with any average, different individuals \u2013 and \nperhaps different sub-groups as well \u2013 will have values dispersed around that average: in \n                                                 \n1 The Mexican Migration Project overcomes this type of limitation to a degree, though it does not \ncontain questions\/variables related to happiness.   \n 3 \ngeneral most people will not gain all that much happiness from an increase in absolute \nincome, but it is possible that small numbers of people do gain more happiness from an \nincrease in absolute income.  That possibility is particularly worth consideration in relation to \nmigrants because international migration is, in relative terms, quite rare: the vast majority of \nthe world\u2019s population does not engage in international migration (migrants in 2007 totaled \n200 million people, roughly three percent of global population, Castles and Miller 2009).  \nMigrants are known different from the general population in particular ways (for example, \nentrepreneurship, on which e.g. Light and Bonacich 1991).  The possibility to be considered \nhere is that they are different in the degree to which income and happiness are related as \nwell.  If that association is stronger among immigrants, then perhaps economic migration is \nmore beneficial to them than a more general reading of happiness studies would imply. \n \n2 Previous Research on Happiness, Income, and Migration \nThe Easterlin paradox is the touchstone for many discussions of income and happiness.  \nEasterlin (1974) determined that, while people in wealthier countries were on average \nhappier than people in poorer countries, that relationship was not strong \u2013 and at least for \nrelatively wealthy countries there was essentially no relationship between happiness and \nincome (growth) over time.  A particularly stark example of this point is Japan, where \neconomic output increased by several hundred percent during its long economic boom \nbeginning in the 1950s but average happiness did not rise (Easterlin 2005).  Happiness has \neven declined in recent decades in the USA; increasing difficulties with stability in \nmarriage\/relationships and employment are possible reasons, for which higher average \nincomes are insufficient compensation (Blanchflower and Oswald 2004). \n This reading of the data has not gone unchallenged.  Easterlin\u2019s argument rested in \npart on his finding that the relationship between income and happiness was weaker in \nwealthier countries than in poorer countries \u2013 suggesting a \u201cthreshold effect\u201d, i.e., above a \ncertain level, extra income does not add much (if anything) to happiness.  Stevenson and \nWolfers (2008), armed with more data (as well as more recent data), assert that that \nrelationship is equally strong in wealthy and poor countries.  They also consider a variety of \n 4 \nissues including question wording, question order, and variations in sampling strategies, and \nthey argue that the finding of no relationship between economic growth and happiness is \nunduly sensitive to researchers\u2019 decisions on these matters (cf. Graham 2009).  But they also \nacknowledge that \u201c[t]he time-series part of our analysis [demonstrating a positive \nlongitudinal relationship] is necessarily only suggestive\u2026\u201d (2008:29), and Easterlin and \nAngelescu (2009) in a direct response assert that a time-series analysis demonstrates that \nthere is indeed no relationship.   \nCrucially, economic growth does not result only in higher levels of income: one \nconsequence of growth is more \u201cgoods\u201d, but growth also creates qualitative changes in \npeople\u2019s lives.  To the extent that change itself is uncomfortable for some, we can think of \ngrowth as producing \u201cdislocations\u201d (Graham 2009).  Deaton (2008) found a negative \nassociation between economic growth and life satisfaction when income levels are \ncontrolled, though that association perhaps disappears if former Soviet-block countries, \nwhere data quality is arguable lower, are removed (cf. Diener et al. 1993).  There is currently \nno indication that happiness researchers have abandoned the view that economic growth \ncontributes little if anything to happiness (though some do reject it, to be sure). \n The Easterlin paradox is sometimes misconstrued as consisting of the claim that \nmoney is unimportant for happiness (cf. Diener 2008).  Phrased in those terms, the claim is \nobviously false and overlooks key distinctions.  The most important of these is the distinction \nbetween relative and absolute income for the individual.  The notion that economic growth \ndoes not increase average levels of happiness is consistent with the possibility that \nindividuals might experience changes in happiness in part as a result of changes in income.  \nWithin countries, wealthier people are on average happier than poorer people.  One main \nreason is that money is in part a positional good, a sign of status: if one can raise one\u2019s \nposition in the income distribution, an increase in happiness is likely to follow (though for \nothers it might decline \u2013 Boyce et al. 2010).  But economic growth cannot raise everyone\u2019s \nstatus, and if economies grow while individuals\u2019 positions remain unchanged, happiness is \nlikely to remain unchanged.  Income in a relative sense matters for happiness, but a key \nimplication of the Easterlin paradox is that income in an absolute sense does not. \n 5 \n A recent paper by Ball and Chernova (2008) demonstrates that even this strong \nconclusion about absolute income is overstated \u2013 slightly.  Using a very large multi-country \nsample, Ball and Chernova found statistically significant associations between absolute \nincome and happiness even after controlling for the effects of relative income (as well as \nother variables explaining variation in happiness).  But the strength of the association was \nvery weak.  Relative income showed a stronger association with happiness.  But other (non-\neconomic) factors matter much more \u2013 in particular, marriage (or having an intimate partner \neven if not married), employment and health.  Ball and Chernova quantify this point: \u201cFor a \nmedian individual who is single, getting married or finding a domestic partner would increase \nhappiness as much as an increase in absolute income of 767% \u2026 or 1948% [depending on the \nregression specification used]\u201d (2008: 523).  Even larger ratios follow from finding \nemployment and gaining improvements in health. The effect of relative income is roughly \nthree to four times larger than that of absolute income, but non-monetary factors are still \nmuch more important.2\n At the level of folk wisdom and popular culture, the notion that money contributes \nlittle to happiness comes as no surprise (cf. Gershwin: \u201cThe man who lives for only making \nmoney \/ lives a life that isn\u2019t necessarily sunny\u2026\u201d).  It clashes with a great deal of economic \ntheory, however \u2013 particularly the assumption of revealed preferences.  Many people act in \nways that provide apparent evidence of a real desire for more money (Lee 2006).  But Gilbert \n(2006) argues persuasively that some of our desires are dysfunctional in the sense that \nfulfilling them fails to bring satisfaction, and Kahneman et al. (2006) argue that a \u201cfocusing \nillusion\u201d leads to exaggerated expectations of happiness benefits from income in particular \nand thus to misallocation of time (and, one presumes, effort).   \n  \nHappiness researchers point to three related psychological processes to explain why \nlife choices based primarily on desire for money often result in some disappointment.  One is \nadaptation: any initial greater satisfaction from a higher income (or the purchases it \n                                                 \n2 As with many studies of this type, Ball and Chernova\u2019s analysis is based on cross-sectional data.  \nClark and Oswald (2002) assert that the structure of equations based on panel data is similar to those \nderived using cross-sectional data, suggesting that \u201comitted dispositions\u201d is not a problem for the \nlatter.   \n 6 \nfacilitates) erodes as we become accustomed to it (Frederick and Loewenstein 1999, \nEasterlin 2001; cf. Scitovsky 1992).  A second process is aspiration: as income increases, our \naspirations (i.e., for even greater income) increase as well (Easterlin 2001, Stutzer 2003, van \nPraag 1993).  What matters for happiness in this regard is the degree to which income \nmatches income aspirations, so that greater income is no guarantee of greater satisfaction.  \nThe third process is social comparison, and happiness researchers note a trend in which \npeople whose income rises alter their reference groups for comparison: instead of deriving \nsatisfaction from giving salience to one\u2019s improved position relative to a stable reference \ngroup, increased income leads people to compare themselves to a wealthier reference group \n(Clark et al. 2008), perhaps in excess of a tendency to weight upward comparisons more \nheavily (Boyce et al. 2010).  As indicated above, a common psychological dynamic concerning \nthe relative dimension of income undermines the potential for income increases to lead to \ngreater happiness. Consideration of these processes is consistent with the finding that those \nwho show evidence of a materialist orientation generally report lower levels of happiness \nthan those who give priority to other types of goals (Kasser 2003, Frank 1999). \nThat point suggests that a degree of skepticism might be appropriate in relation to \ninternational migration motivated primarily by economic considerations.  Migrants from \npoorer countries who gain entry to wealthy countries might not benefit much from the \nabsolute dimensions of an increased income, and in relation to relative income migration \nmight be disadvantageous insofar as one\u2019s relative position in the destination country is likely \nto be lower than it was in the sending country (Portes and Bach 1985).  Particularly if \nmigration leads to permanent settlement, one\u2019s reference group will likely come to include \npeople in the destination country, and difficulties with language and recognition of \nqualifications might mean that those who were middle-class in the sending country will \nencounter obstacles to finding middle-class jobs in the destination.  Happiness among \nimmigrants is particularly affected by discrepancies between prior expectations and realities \nafter migration, raising the possibility of unrealistic expectations (Vohra and Adair 2000; on \ndiscrepancies more generally, see Michalos 1985).  Happiness is determined in part by \npersonality\/temperament (Diener et al. 1999, Lykken and Tellegen 1996), and to the extent \n 7 \nthat migration was motivated by a sense of frustrated ambitions one might find that that \nfeeling persists after migration despite economic gains (cf. Graham 2009).  Economic \nmigrants typically make sacrifices in other areas of life (e.g. separation from family) for the \nsake of the increased income migration can bring (e.g. Dreby 2010) \u2013 but if the benefits of \nincreased income prove chimerical then the sacrifices might amount to pure loss.   \n The speculative tone of the previous paragraph recalls a point made in the \nintroduction: there is currently no empirical research enabling us to know whether migration \nleads to increased happiness.  Scott and Scott (1989) determined that most immigrants to \nAustralia reported being happier and more satisfied with their lives relative to five years \npreviously, a span that would capture the period prior to migration for some.  But most \npeople report, at any given point, that they are happier than they used to be (Hagerty 2003) , \nand Scott and Scott indeed found that immigrants were similar to native-born Australians in \nthis regard. \nWhile the absence of research means it would be unwise to claim that we can know \nthat migration does not lead to greater happiness, it seems equally unwise to claim that we \ncan be confident that it does lead to greater happiness.  We would likely be more confident \nabout happiness consequences if most economic migrants originated in the world\u2019s poorest \ncountries.  But migration requires resources, and the very poorest typically do not have the \nresources for migration.  To the extent that economic migration involves people whose basic \nsurvival is not threatened but who \u201cmerely\u201d want to raise their standard of living, happiness \nstudies leads us to the suggestion that an increased standard of living accomplished via \nmigration might not result in greater happiness.   \n Some migration researchers, not studying happiness directly, write about the \ndifficulties faced by immigrants in ways that resonate with the notion that migration might \nnot bring happiness. Parre\u00f1as (2001), for example, portrays the \u201cdislocations\u201d particularly of \nfemale migrants, and Sayad refers to the \u201csuffering of the immigrant\u201d and even the \u201c\u2019hell\u2019 of \nimmigration\u201d (2004:88)  There is evidence that immigrants in some wealthy countries report \nlower levels of life satisfaction than natives, controlling for other determinants (Safi 2009).  In \naddition, this divergence shows little sign of dissipating over time.  Even the notion that \n 8 \nmigration involves a sacrifice that one makes for the sake of one\u2019s children is not obviously \nborne out in the experience of the children: Safi found that the gap in happiness with respect \nto natives was no smaller for the second generation than for the immigrants themselves.3\n In lieu of a direct test of that question, then, this paper considers a possibility in \nwhich economic migrants might experience greater happiness following migration to a \nwealthier country.  When happiness researchers assert, on the basis of a coefficient in a \nmodel equation, that the effect of increased income is small, the correct interpretation of \nthat assertion is that the average effect is small, i.e., for most people.  As with any average, \none expects to find that the values for individuals are dispersed around that average, such \nthat a small number of individuals are likely to have values that are located quite some \ndistance from the average value.  Again, international migrants constitute a very small part of \nthe world\u2019s population; migrants are \u201cexceptional\u201d, likely to be different from the general \npopulation in a variety of ways, some of which lead them to choose migration (within a \nstructural context of opportunities, constraints, and ideas).  The main question addressed in \nthis paper, then, is whether migrants are exceptional with regard to the relationship \nbetween income and happiness.  If migrants gain more happiness from income than an \naverage individual, then perhaps economic migration is a more sensible choice than would \nappear from a straightforward reading of the research literature on happiness and income. \n  \nEven so, these findings do not mean that happiness for migrants was lower after migration \nthan before.  We simply can\u2019t answer that longitudinal question with the cross-sectional data \navailable.  \n \n3 Data and Methods \nData for this analysis are drawn from the World Values Survey, which includes questions on \nhappiness and life satisfaction as well as a number of other variables widely understood to \n                                                 \n3 Migrants might well believe that migration is a sacrifice worth making for the sake of their children \u2013 \nbut that belief might be inaccurate in relation to actual consequences for the second generation, \nparticularly if the children themselves show evidence of downward mobility as per the segmented \nassimilation thesis (Portes and Zhou 1993).  Beliefs about remittances might be similar in this respect: \nBorraz et al. (2007) found that emigrants\u2019 families back home were less happy than non-migrant \nfamilies despite the greater income brought by remittances. \n 9 \nbe important for analysis of happiness.  I use data from the 1995 (third) wave; analysis \nspecifically of immigrants using later waves is not possible because the question enabling the \ncomparison between immigrants and natives is no longer used.  The sample size is 1542, with \nan age range from 18 to 94.   \nIn certain respects the analysis here builds on that of Ball and Chernova, but I depart \nfrom them in a number of ways.  To begin, I limit my analysis to the USA, instead of \nattempting to cover a large number of countries.  Different countries attract different kinds \nof immigrants, with different motivations and with different contexts of opportunity.  It \nseemed unwise to include countries in the European Union, for example, given the \nopportunity for unrestricted movement internally and relatively greater closure to migrants \nfrom outside the EU.   \n The WVS question on life satisfaction (V65) was used by Ball and Chernova for their \nanalysis of the relationship between income and happiness.  Their decision to denote as \n\u201chappy\u201d a life satisfaction variable is slightly odd (particularly since the dataset contains a \nvariable addressing happiness directly, V10) though defensible: life satisfaction is typically \nviewed as the cognitive\/evaluative component of happiness (the latter also encompassing an \naffective dimension e.g. the prevalence of positive feelings).  Blanchflower and Oswald \nestablish (2004) that empirical models are not very different when using happiness versus life \nsatisfaction as the dependent variable; Schyns (1998) found that the correlation between the \ntwo variables was extremely high (e.g. 0.90).  In common with many researchers, I therefore \nuse the terms life satisfaction and happiness interchangeably here.  The question on life \nsatisfaction (\u201cAll things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these \ndays?\u201d) offers respondents a ten-point scale for response, with 1 labeled \u201cdissatisfied\u201d, 10 \nlabeled \u201csatisfied\u201d, and the intervening values unlabeled.  The fact that this variable derives \nfrom ten response options (as against four options for the variable asking specifically about \nhappiness, V10) offers some technical advantage, as will become clear below. \n One key independent variable of interest is income.  The WVS asks respondents \n(V227) to select from ten income brackets the range in which their household\u2019s income falls.  \nFollowing Ball and Chernova I convert this variable into data on actual (absolute) income \n 10 \nusing the midpoint of each income bracket to approximate respondents\u2019 household income, \nexpressed here in US$ thousands.  (The highest option contains only a minimum figure, and \nso I use 120% of this minimum to approximate the income of people in the highest range.) \n As noted above, a key finding of happiness studies is that income matters not only in \nan absolute sense but in a relative sense.  To capture the relative dimension of income, Ball \nand Chernova construct two measure.  One is the percentile in the overall income \ndistribution in which a respondent\u2019s household income falls (the percentage of respondents \nin the sample with incomes equal to or less than his or hers).  The second is the ratio of one\u2019s \nabsolute income to the sample median ($35,000 in the USA in 1995). \n The other primary independent variable is immigrant status.  The third wave of the \nWVS asks respondents whether they were born in the US \u2013 and, if not, they are then asked to \nreport region of birth (Latin America, Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia, other).  Using this \nquestion, I construct an \u201cimmigrant\u201d variable, 0 if an individual was born in the US and 1 \notherwise.  Variations on this scheme are explored further in the next section.   \n The analysis also uses a range of control variables commonly included in statistical \nmodels of happiness.  Marital status is indicated with three dummy variables (the reference \ncategory is single): \u201cpartner\u201d (for those who are married or living with a partner), \u201csplit\u201d (for \nthose who are divorced or separated), and \u201cwidowed\u201d.  Sex is indicated with zero for male \nand one for female.  \u201cAge\u201d is given in years; the square of age (divided by 100) is included to \ntake account of the curvilinear relationship between age and happiness (with declining \nhappiness in middle age, followed by an increase when other variables are controlled).  \nRespondents report their \u201chealth\u201d on a five-point scale, indicated here with one as very good \nand five as very poor.  A variable for number of children is recoded with two dummy \nvariables (reference category is no children): one for one child and another for two or more \nchildren.  Religiosity is captured by a variable that asks respondents to rate the importance of \n\u201cGod\u201d on a ten-point scale (one indicates least important).   \n A variable for employment status is also included as a control.   Ball and Chernova use \nsix dummy variables, to capture the separate effects of being a student, retired, employed \npart-time, etc., relative to being employed full-time.  For the analysis presented here, I adopt \n 11 \na different approach, constructing a single dummy variable for \u201cunemployed\u201d relative to all \nother employment statuses (not unemployed, thus including those who are retired, students, \netc.).  I adopted this simplification of Ball and Chernova\u2019s model after determining that for \nthis sample only unemployment indicated a significant association with life satisfaction; \nnothing was gained via separate analysis of the other employment statuses.   \n For assessing happiness among immigrants previous research suggests that additional \nvariables might be relevant \u2013 in particular, facility with the dominant language and time since \nimmigration (e.g. Ying 1996, Neto 1995, Amit 2010).  Time since migration is indicated with a \nvariable asking those born abroad how many years ago they came to the USA (with answers \ngiven in ranges, e.g. 6-10 years ago, 11-15 years ago, etc.).  Another variable indicates which \nlanguage respondents normally speak at home; this variable admittedly does not capture \nproblems with ability to speak English, as those who normally speak a different language at \nhome might nonetheless speak English well.   \n The values of these variables for natives and immigrants are summarized in Table 1.  \nThe analysis later introduces a distinction between immigrants from Europe and Canada on \none hand and immigrants from Africa, Latin America, Asia and \u201cother\u201d on the other hand, \nand the third and fourth columns of Table 1 provide separate values for respondents in those \ntwo groupings.   \n \n (Table 1 here) \n \n4 Analysis and Results \nThe dependent variable, deriving from a question on life satisfaction with ten options for \nresponse, is ordinal, and an appropriate form of analysis thus uses an ordered logit model \n(on which see O\u2019Connell 2006).  Strictly speaking, ordinary least-squares regression is \ninappropriate because the underlying variable is in principle continuous, with possible non-\ninteger values \u2013 but these are not captured via the integers offered to respondents on the \nquestionnaire.  Nor can one assume that the intervals between the integers are applied \n 12 \nequally by respondents throughout the range of the response options.  This issue is revisited \nbelow. \n Key variables of interest relate to respondents\u2019 household income.   As noted above, \nprevious research shows that happiness is associated with income in both an absolute sense \nand a relative sense.  In analysis here, for both approaches to relative income (as a \npercentile, and as a ratio to median income) the correlation between relative income and \nabsolute income was so high that the resulting collinearity made it impossible to include both \nmeasures in the model.  Given that the main question addressed in this paper relates to \nabsolute income, the relative income variables were therefore dropped from the analysis \n(with no notable consequences for other variables in the model apart from absolute income).  \nAbsolute income is strongly skewed to the right, and so consistent with previous research the \nmodel here uses the natural logarithm of absolute income.   \n Early attempts to fit an ordered logit model using Stata resulted in failure to satisfy \nthe assumption of parallel lines (equal effects of all independent variables at all levels of the \ndependent variable).  I therefore aggregated the sparsely populated lower ranges of life \nsatisfaction (one through four) and used \u201cgologit2\u201d (Williams 2006) to determine a partial \nproportional odds model, which enables estimation of a model in which coefficients for \nindependent variables are allowed to vary across different levels of the dependent variable if \nnecessary. \n The primary question raised in this paper is whether the relationship between \nhappiness and absolute income is different for immigrants, relative to that relationship for \nthe general population.  The fact that the coefficient for the interaction term in Table 2 is \nsignificant at conventional levels is consistent with the hypothesis that immigrants are \nindeed different in this association: a higher income raises the odds for higher levels of life \nsatisfaction to a greater extent for immigrants than it does for natives.   \n \n (Table 2 here) \n \n A second finding of interest in this model is the fact that being an immigrant in the US \nis associated with significantly lower odds of higher levels of life satisfaction relative to \n 13 \nnatives (in line with results reported for Europe by Safi, 2009; cf. B\u0103l\u0163\u0103tescu 2007).  The \ncoefficient is not just statistically significant but is large in absolute terms: immigrants have \nsignificantly higher odds, relative to natives, of reporting lower levels of life satisfaction when \nother variables are controlled.4\n Other variables in the model behave mostly as expected.  As in previous research, the \ncoefficient for logged absolute income is positive and statistically significant at conventional \nlevels.  Other results include higher odds of greater life satisfaction among people who are \nmarried or living with a partner and lower odds of higher life satisfaction among the \nunemployed.  The quadratic term age-squared indicates that life satisfaction starts rising in \nlater life if other variables are controlled (though in reality other variables aren\u2019t controlled, \ne.g. as health declines with age, cf. Ball and Chernova 2008).  Life satisfaction is higher for \nthose who are more religious.  Those with two or more children are less satisfied than those \nwith no children; there is no difference between the childless and those with one child, as in \nBall and Chernova\u2019s models.  The table does not report a coefficient for health because in the \npartial proportional odds model the impact of health was not consistent across the different \nlevels of life satisfaction.  It was however a significant variable:  the coefficients ranged from \n\u20130.933 to \u20130.418, with poorer health having stronger negative impacts at the lower levels of \nlife satisfaction (all coefficients highly significant at p<.001).  Coefficients for variables on age \nand sex showed the expected sign (e.g. life satisfaction declining with age), but they were not \nstatistically significant and were removed from the model for the sake of parsimony, with no \nconsequences for the values of other variables.\n  Interpretation of this association is revisited below.   \n5\n                                                 \n4 When one considers that particularly unhappy migrants might be more inclined to return to their \ncountry of origin (or to move on to another destination), the size of this negative coefficient might be \neven larger if migrants who had already left were included in the sample.  As noted above, national \nconstraints on data collection inhibit measurement of immigration-related processes like this. \n  The variables on language and time since \nimmigration also showed no significant association with the dependent variable and were \nnot retained.   \n5 The age variable was statistically significant in Ball and Chernova\u2019s models \u2013 presumably because \ntheir sample was much larger (>20,000).  Even with the larger sample, sex was not significant in their \nmodels. \n 14 \n It bears exploring further how the negative value of the coefficient for the \n\u201cimmigrant\u201d variable comes about.  Examination of bivariate associations in Table 1 showed \nthat in the absence of control variables immigrants do not report lower average levels of life \nsatisfaction (x\u02c9 = 7.5, vs. x\u02c9 = 7.7 for natives \u2013 not a statistically significant difference).  But \nimmigrants rate more highly than natives on many of the characteristics that are positively \nassociated with happiness: they show higher rates of marriage and lower rates of divorce, \nthey are younger, and they have fewer children.  Only on unemployment do immigrants fare \nworse than natives.  The fact that they nonetheless do not report higher levels of life \nsatisfaction (i.e., in a bivariate comparison, without controls) helps account, in part, for the \nnegative association between immigrant status and life satisfaction.   \n We thus see evidence consistent with two propositions here: being an immigrant is \nassociated with lower life satisfaction, and the positive effect of income on life satisfaction is \nstronger for immigrants than for natives.  To make greater sense of these two results, the \nanalysis turns now to a less well-specified model that has the virtue of facilitating more \naccessible interpretation.   Table 3 presents a model that departs from Table 2 in that it \nemploys ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression, proposing that the ten-item question on life \nsatisfaction provides a sufficient approximation of the underlying continuous variable to \nmeet the assumptions of OLS.  Again, strictly speaking OLS is not appropriate for ordinal data \n(though many researchers use it anyway).  But it is more plausible for an ordinal variable with \nten response categories than for an ordinal variable with only three or four categories, and \nBlanchflower and Oswald (2004) find that an OLS model of even a three-category response \nvariable on happiness gives results that are roughly equivalent to an ordered logit model.  \nUsing a cautious approach to interpretation, the point is to gain greater insight into the two \nmain findings of the ordered logit analysis.   \n \n (Table 3 here) \n \n The first observation regarding the model in Table 3 is that the effect of absolute \nincome is small.  The variable expresses (logged) US$1000s.  A coefficient of .198 for a logged \nincome variable suggests that doubling the median income of $35,000 would result in an \n 15 \nincrease of less than one-seventh of a point on that scale (ln 70 \u2013 ln 35 = .6935, and .198 * \n.6935 =.137).  This result is consistent with Ball and Chernova\u2019s main finding: the effect of \nabsolute income on happiness is very small.6\n Given the inclusion of interaction term between income and immigrant status in this \nmodel, the coefficient for income in the table (.198) applies to natives (for whom \n\u201cimmigrant\u201d = 0).  The coefficient for the interaction term, .563, suggests that the income \ncoefficient for immigrants is .761 instead of .198.  This is indeed a larger figure \u2013 but it is still \nsmall, insofar as it suggests that doubling the median income of $35,000 (while holding other \nvariables constant) would result in an increase in happiness for immigrants of just over half a \npoint on the ten-point scale.  (Given the presence of the interaction term, this calculation is \nmore complicated, requiring comparison of life satisfaction for two hypothetical individuals \nvia the regression equation \u2013 see the Appendix for calculation, which results in a \ndifference\/gain of .527).   Even for immigrants, then, the association between income and \nlife satisfaction is not large (though quite a bit larger than for natives), particularly when we \nconsider income increases that are likely to be achievable.   \n  It is worth emphasizing in this context that in \npractice very few people are capable of doubling their income: achievable increases in \nincome for most people likely have very small positive effects on their life satisfaction.  \n As in the ordered logit model, the coefficient for immigrant status is negative and \nstatistically significant.  The presence of the interaction term between immigrant status and \nincome induces a further requirement for caution in interpretation: one cannot interpret the \nimmigrant coefficient directly, as this would constitute a comparison between an immigrant \nand a non-immigrant with no income.  Instead, consider the difference between an \nimmigrant and a native both earning the median income, $35,000 (and holding identical \nvalues for the other variables): using the model we would predict that happiness for the \nimmigrant would be .189 lower than for the native (see the Appendix for calculation).  Other \nresults, for the various control variables, show similarity to the ordered logit specification. \n                                                 \n6 This statement assumes that the direction of causality, if any, runs from income to life satisfaction.  \nThe reverse is plausible, as often noted: more satisfied people might be able to earn higher incomes. \n 16 \n So far the analysis has turned on a straightforward comparison between natives and \nimmigrants.  This approach is not necessarily the best way to address the question posed in \nthe introduction, insofar as that question asks about the determinants of happiness among \neconomic migrants in particular.  The experience of immigrants from poorer countries is \ntherefore of particular interest.  The motivation for immigrants from wealthier countries \nmight also be \u201ceconomic\u201d in the sense that one is drawn by a job opportunity, but for \nimmigrants from poorer countries the prospect of greater income is particularly relevant, \nand in any event greater income is a key element of such immigrants\u2019 experience after \nmigration.  The analysis therefore turns now to a model that distinguishes between \nimmigrants from Europe and Canada on one hand and immigrants from Asia, Latin America, \nAfrica, and \u201cother\u201d on the other hand.7\n It appears that this distinction might indeed matter.  Table 4 presents the results of \nan OLS model: immigrants from Europe and Canada do not report significant differences in \nlife satisfaction (controlling for other factors), while the negative coefficient (statistically \nsignificant at conventional levels) for immigrants from (mainly) Asia, Latin America and Africa \nsuggests that they do experience lower levels of satisfaction.  (One could quibble about the \np-value of .053 for that coefficient \u2013 though doing so would fetishize the conventional cutoff \nof .05.)  The same conclusion is apparent for the different relationship between income and \nlife satisfaction: the interaction term with respect to immigrants from Asia, Latin America \nand Africa is statistically significant (using a one-tailed hypothesis test \u2013 appropriate to the \nextent that one would predict that economic migrants would benefit more, not less, than \nnatives from greater income), while for immigrants from Europe and Canada it is clearly not.  \nIt appears that immigrants to the US from poorer countries find greater satisfaction from \nhigher absolute incomes (in comparison to natives), while the same conclusion for \nimmigrants from wealthier countries cannot be drawn from these data.   \n \n \n                                                 \n7 There is, unavoidably, a degree of imprecision in designating (all) countries in Asia as poorer than \nthe US: that designation would not be correct for Japan, in particular.  In addition, \u201cother\u201d would \nlikely include Australia and New Zealand \u2013 though it would also include immigrants from the \nCaribbean. \n 17 \n (Table 4 here) \n \n A number of caveats are in order, particularly in relation to the previous paragraph.  \nIn making the distinction between two different types of immigrants, we run the risk of \nfailing to reject false null hypotheses purely because the subsamples are small.  In the sample \nanalyzed here, there are 35 immigrants from Europe and Canada as against 65 immigrants \nfrom Asia, Latin America, Africa and \u201cother\u201d.  The relevant coefficients for the \nEurope\/Canada group show signs consistent with results in previous tables: a lower level of \nlife satisfaction and a stronger relationship between absolute income and life satisfaction, \nrelative to natives. The small size of this group might be the major factor in failing to find that \nthe difference in life satisfaction is statistically significant \u2013 though the coefficient is smaller \nthan the coefficient for immigrants from poorer countries.  The same point might hold in \nrelation to the interaction term, though here as well the coefficient for the interaction term \npertaining to immigrants from Europe and Canada is smaller.   \n The issue of small subsamples raises a more general question: how well does this \nsample represent the population of immigrants in the USA?  Immigrants (the foreign-born) \nconstitute 8.3 percent of this sample \u2013 a figure that is not too far off the percentage of \nforeign-born in the US population: 8.8 percent in 1995 (SOPEMI 2000, using figures from the \nUS Census Bureau).  To the extent that the sample here fails to capture the full range of the \nimmigrant population, we would expect that it fails to fully represent undocumented \nimmigrants in particular.  Their probable under-representation is unfortunate insofar as \nundocumented immigrants are especially likely to fit the concept of economic migrants.  \nEven so, undocumented immigrants are in all likelihood more similar to those in the sample \nfrom Asia, Latin America and Africa than to those from Canada and Europe; many probably \noriginate from Latin America.  It therefore seems unlikely that their inclusion would \nundermine the associations found in the analysis presented above; if anything, their inclusion \nmight well reinforce those associations. \nThe finding of a negative association between immigrant status and life satisfaction \n(particularly for those from poorer countries) begs the question: how might we explain such \n 18 \nan association?8\nOne possibility for explaining that negative association arises from consideration of \ntheir satisfaction with their financial situation.  Financial satisfaction is measured in the WVS \nwith a variable similar to life satisfaction (on a 10-point scale).  Immigrants report \nsubstantially lower satisfaction with their household financial situation than natives: x\u02c9 = 5.9 \nvs. x\u02c9 = 6.6.  The difference is even larger for immigrants from Asia, Latin America and Africa, \nwhose average level of financial satisfaction is 5.5 \u2013 again, despite average earnings \nequivalent to those of natives.  If we add the financial satisfaction variable to the equation \nreported in Table 3 (results in Table 5, left-hand columns), the noteworthy consequence is \nthat the \u201cimmigrant\u201d variable is no longer statistically significant (p=0.134).  The same result \nfollows from adding the financial satisfaction variable to the equation in Table 4 (results in \nTable 5, right-hand columns): the coefficient for the variable denoting immigrants from the \npoorer countries is no longer significant (p=0.106).   \n  We cannot point to other variables included in the analysis, as the \ncoefficient for immigrant status is determined in part by controlling those other variables.  \nOne might suspect that income itself is responsible, but the effect of income is evidently \nsmall even for immigrants from poorer countries, and in any event immigrants in that group \nreport a mean household income that is not much smaller than the average income of \nnatives (roughly $37,200 vs. $39,200, not a statistically significant difference).  Even though \nmigrants from poorer countries succeed, on average, in earning incomes on par with natives \nand experience larger happiness benefits from income, that latter effect is not sufficient to \ncounteract whatever it is that results in the negative association between immigrant status \nand life satisfaction. \n \n(Table 5 here) \n \n                                                 \n8 One might wonder whether immigrants and natives would tend to answer the life satisfaction \nquestion differently perhaps for cultural reasons.  But data from this type of question are regularly \nused for international comparisons of happiness, and while there are indeed cultural differences (on \nwhich see Suh et al. 1998) there is no apparent reason to believe that any \u201cbias\u201d arising from cultural \nfactors would work solely in one direction, given that immigrants to the US come from a very wide \nrange of countries. \n 19 \nA highly plausible interpretation is that immigrants are less satisfied with their lives \nthan natives in part because they are less satisfied with their financial situation.  Perhaps, \nthen, economic migrants to the USA develop (or bring) exaggerated income aspirations \u2013 \nexactly as one might expect via extrapolation from previous research on income and \nhappiness (Easterlin 2001).  On average, even immigrants from poorer countries earn \nincomes in line with the incomes of natives \u2013 but it seems that in the course of achieving \nincomes higher than they would have earned in the country of origin these immigrants are \nalso developing income aspirations in excess of the income aspirations of natives.  It would \nthen make sense that average incomes go with below-average life satisfaction for immigrants \n(i.e., lower than would be anticipated given other characteristics).  \nA final scenario that might shed light on the negative \u201cimmigrant\u201d coefficient returns \nus to the fact that in determining the models presented above it was necessary to remove \nthe relative income variable.  As Ball and Chernova demonstrate (2008), when one controls \nfor relative income, the effect of absolute income is very small.  Insofar as the models \npresented above do not control for relative income, they are almost certainly overstating the \neffect of absolute income, in comparison to a model that does control for relative income.  \nThe suggestion that doubling the median income would result in an increase in life \nsatisfaction of .137 for natives and .527 for immigrants fails to consider that part of any \nincrease in life satisfaction resulting from increased income would be attributable to one\u2019s \nhigher position, i.e., one\u2019s status in an income hierarchy, not only from direct enjoyment of \nthe income per se or the acquisitions it would facilitate (\u201cabsolute\u201d income).  As noted \nearlier, Ball and Chernova find that the relative effect is larger than the absolute effect. \nWe can then consider plausible scenarios in relation to what immigrants from poorer \ncountries are likely to experience.  I suggested above that very few people are capable of \ndoubling their income \u2013 but a significant increase in income is exactly what economic \nmigrants by definition set out to do, and moving to a wealthier (high-wage) economy no \ndoubt enables some people from poorer countries to accomplish such a goal (though \nconsideration of the point raises an additional complication of purchasing power).  But many \neconomic migrants are likely to experience a decline in relative position in the process, as \n 20 \nnoted above (i.e., a lower relative position in the destination, as against a higher relative \nposition in the origin).  Economic migrants are said to be less concerned with local status \nhierarchies early in their migration histories, but if they become more or less permanent \nsettlers their status orientation (reference group) is likely to include natives to a greater \nextent (Piore 1979).  Perhaps, then, the small effect of an increase in absolute income is \noutweighed by a plausibly larger negative effect of a decline in relative position.  This is \nanother way we might make sense of the negative association between immigrant status and \nlife satisfaction when other variables are controlled.  There are of course a number of other \nfactors not included in the model presented above that could also be relevant to immigrants\u2019 \nhappiness \u2013 e.g. the simple fact of being a foreigner, of adapting to a different culture and \nperhaps a different language. \n \n5 Conclusion \nThe immediately preceding comments are quite speculative, and even if it were possible to \nindicate the likely dimensions of the various suggested associations (e.g. their relative \nweights), we would still lack the longitudinal data required to address the questions in a \nmore definitive manner.  It is therefore worth returning to what we can assert with a \nreasonable degree of confidence rooted in analysis of data. \nThe analysis presented above confirms for the USA what Safi (2009) found for \nimmigrants in Europe, i.e., that being an immigrant is associated with lower levels of life \nsatisfaction than natives.  The ordered logit model indicates that being an immigrant lowers \nthe odds of reporting higher life satisfaction scores, and coefficients from the OLS models \nsuggest that immigrants earning average incomes are approximately one-fifth of a point \nlower on the ten-point scale than similarly-placed natives (i.e., when other variables are \ncontrolled).  In distinguishing between the two broad groups of immigrants, it appears that \nthis association emerges particularly from the experience of immigrants from poorer \ncountries, as against immigrants from other wealthy countries.   \n Immigrants do appear to evince a stronger relationship between income and \nhappiness, in line with the hypothesis that motivated this paper.  Here as well the disparity is \n 21 \nstronger for immigrants from poorer countries (and possibly there is no difference in this \nregard between natives and immigrants from Europe and Canada, though the small sub-\nsample size might be the best explanation for that result).  But it bears emphasizing that, \neven though immigrants from poorer countries seem to gain more happiness from income \nthan natives, the effect is nonetheless small, particularly when we recall that the indicated \nvalues are almost certainly exaggerated quite substantially by the omission of a relative \nincome variable from the models.  Moreover, it appears that the extra happiness migrants \nget from the absolute dimension of their incomes is outweighed by the fact that they are less \nsatisfied than natives with the incomes they have achieved.  This is more a paradox than a \ncontradiction: it suggests that immigrants might indeed gain more happiness than natives \nfrom having even greater incomes, but they are also more frustrated than natives by not \nbeing able to achieve greater incomes than the ones they have in reality.   \n The analysis presented in this paper is consistent with two interpretations regarding \nwhether economic migration generally increases happiness for the migrants.  If one is \ninclined to believe that migrants generally make choices well grounded in an understanding \nof their own goals and the conditions they are likely to encounter in the destination, then \nupon finding that they experience lower life satisfaction in the destination relative to natives \none will probably conclude that their life satisfaction in the country of origin must have been \neven lower \u2013 i.e., migration is a path to improvement.  If, on the other hand, one is more \ninclined to believe that migrants (like most people) sometimes hold mistaken beliefs about \nwhether a particular choice will result in increased happiness, then the fact that migrants\u2019 life \nsatisfaction is lower than that of natives might suggest that economic migration is indeed \nsometimes a mistake in terms of its consequences for happiness. \nIt is not possible, with the survey data available, to adjudicate between these two \npossibilities.  The former, more optimistic scenario likely predominates among many \nmigration scholars, at least as an implicit assumption.  It is also a premise of many discussions \nof the ethics of migration control policies: the best reason for mounting an argument \nfavoring open borders is the belief that migrants would benefit from the opportunity for \n 22 \nmigration (Bartram 2010), and happiness is arguably a compelling way of specifying \u201cbenefit\u201d \n(Sumner 1996). \nIf the pessimistic (second) scenario is more accurate, then there is a deep irony.  In \ngeneral, happiness researchers find that wealthier countries are more conducive to higher \naverage levels of individual happiness than poor countries (in part because of political and \ninstitutional factors \u2013 e.g. wealthier countries generally embody a higher level of freedom, \nsee e.g. Frey and Stutzer 2002; Radcliffe 2002; Diener et al. 2009); such countries are said to \nbe more \u201clivable\u201d (Veenhoven and Ehrhardt 1995; cf. Veenhoven 1991). But it would be an \necological fallacy to conclude on that basis alone that one can achieve a higher level of \nhappiness via migration to a wealthy country.  Migration is a longitudinal process, and the \nEasterlin paradox can be taken to imply that migration as a means of raising one\u2019s income \nmight be no more effective at increasing happiness than other means of increasing one\u2019s \nincome.  Happiness for immigrants in wealthy countries might result from different \nprocesses, relative to natives in those countries, and even if it were established that income \nincreases do in general result in greater happiness, it does not necessarily follow that income \nincreases accomplished via migration bring greater happiness.  The consequences of \nincreased income are probably separable from the consequences of the means by which one \ngains increased income (Diener and Biswas-Diener 2002). \nImmigrants no doubt benefit in a number of ways from gaining access to a wealthy \ncountry.  Subjective well-being is hardly the only relevant issue, and an ethical position that \nsaw no problem when people are happy despite objective deprivation would be highly \nobjectionable (Sen 1999).  But it seems less likely that they benefit specifically from having \ngained access to higher incomes, relative to the incomes they earned in their country of \norigin.  It appears from the analysis above that they benefit more than natives from achieving \nhigher incomes \u2013 but the magnitude of that benefit is still small, especially considering that \nthe models presented here overstate the association with \u201cabsolute\u201d income.  Whether the \nother benefits of migration are generally outweighed by costs of various types \u2013 and indeed \nwhether migration generally brings an increase or a decrease in happiness (or no change) \u2013 is \nsurely a question worthy of further attention.   \n 23 \nAppendix \nThe presence of the interaction term in Table 3 means that the only way to determine the \ndifference in life satisfaction between two immigrants, one earning the median income of \n$35,000 and the other earning twice that, is to use the equation specified by the model.  I \nshow here the calculations that produce the result indicated above.  The values of the other \nvariables do not matter for this purpose as long as they remain constant for the comparison, \nbut they are required for the calculation: our individual is therefore married, with no \nchildren, not unemployed, 40 years old, in \u201cgood\u201d health (=2), and attributes a moderate \ndegree of importance of God in his life (=5).  (Recalling that income in this model is logged, \nthe first term after the constant below uses the natural logarithm of 35, thus 3.555.) \nFor an immigrant with these characteristics earning a median income, then, life \nsatisfaction is predicted by y = 6.843 + .198 (3.555) - 2.189 (1) + .563 (1*3.555) + .720 (1) - \n.320 (0) - .042 (0) - .314 (0) - .429 (0) + .019 (402\/100) - .466 (0) + .09 (5) - .608 (2) = 7.339.    \nFor an immigrant earning twice the median income, life satisfaction is predicted by y \n= 6.843 + .198 (4.2485) - 2.189 (1) + .563 (1*4.2485) + .720 (1) - .320 (0) - .042 (0) - .314 (0) - \n.429 (0) + .019 (402\/100) - .466 (0) + .09 (5) - .608 (2) = 7.866.  The difference between the \ntwo is .527.   \n In addition, the presence of an interaction term whose counterpart is income means \nthat the OLS coefficient for the \u201cimmigrant\u201d variable in model 2 cannot be interpreted \ndirectly.  A direct comparison between immigrants and non-immigrants using this coefficient \nwould be misleading insofar as it would describe individuals whose amount of income is zero.   \nThe following equation using the model in Table 2 predicts the life satisfaction of a US \nnative earning median income.  As before, the values of the other variables do not matter for \nthis purpose as long as they remain constant.   \nLife satisfaction, then, is predicted by y = 6.843 + .198 (3.555) - 2.189 (0) + .563 \n(0*3.555) + .720 (1) - .320 (0) - .042 (0) - .314 (0) - .429 (0) + .019 (402\/100) - .466 (0) + .09 (5) \n- .608 (2) = 7.528. \nFor an immigrant with the same characteristics earning a median income, life \nsatisfaction is, as before, 7.339.   The difference, then, is 0.189.  \n 24 \nReferences \nAmit, K. (2010). Determinants of Life Satisfaction Among Immigrants from Western Countries \nand from the FSU in Israel.
