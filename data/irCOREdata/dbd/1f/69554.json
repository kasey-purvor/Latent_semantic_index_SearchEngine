In this study, the relationship between auroral ab-\nsorption, electrojet currents, and ionospheric plasma convec-\ntion velocity is investigated using a series of new methods\nwhere temporal correlations are calculated and analysed for\ndifferent events and MLT sectors. We employ cosmic noise\nabsorption (CNA) observations obtained by the Imaging Ri-\nometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) system in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nFinland, plasma convection measurements by the European\nIncoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar, and estimates of the elec-\ntrojet currents derived from the Troms\u00f8 magnetometer data.\nThe IRIS absorption and EISCAT plasma convection mea-\nsurements are used as a proxy for the particle precipitation\ncomponent of the Hall conductance and ionospheric electric\nfield, respectively. It is shown that the electrojet currents are\naffected by both enhanced conductance and electric field but\nwith the relative importance of these two factors varying with\nmagnetic local time (MLT). The correlation between the cur-\nrent and electric field (absorption) is the highest at 12:00\u2013\n15:00 MLT (00:00\u201303:00 MLT). It is demonstrated that the\nelectric-field-dominant region is asymmetric with respect to\nmagnetic-noon-midnight meridian extending from 09:00 to\n21:00 MLT. This may be related to the recently reported ab-\nsence of mirror-symmetry between the effects of positive and\nnegative IMF By on the high-latitude plasma convection pat-\ntern. The conductivity-dominant region is somewhat wider\nthan previously thought extending from 21:00 to 09:00 MLT\nwith correlation slowly declining from midnight towards the\nmorning, which is interpreted as being in part due to high-\nenergy electron clouds gradually depleting and drifting from\nmidnight towards the morning sector. The conductivity-\ndominant region is further investigated using the extensive\nCorrespondence to: R. A. Makarevich\n(r.makarevich@latrobe.edu.au)\nIRIS riometer and Troms\u00f8 magnetometer datasets with re-\nsults showing a distinct seasonal dependence. The region\nof high current-absorption correlation extends from 21:00\nto 06:00 MLT near both equinoxes, however, it is narrower\nand rotated towards the morning (02:00\u201307:00 MLT) in sum-\nmer, while in winter the correlation shows much greater vari-\nability with MLT. During periods of high current-electric-\nfield correlation, the relationship between electric field and\nabsorption can be described as an inverse proportionality,\nwhich can be explained by limitation of the electrojet cur-\nrent by the magnetospheric generator. Possible cases of elec-\ntron heating absorption are also investigated with absorption\nshowing no obvious dependence on the ion velocity or elec-\ntron temperature.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents; Particle precipitation)\n1 Introduction\nEnergetic particle precipitation in the auroral ionosphere\nwith its spectacular auroral displays represents arguably the\nmost impressive aspect of Space Weather. Magnetospheric\nparticles in the 0.5\u201320 keV energy range precipitating in\nthe ionospheric E- and F-regions are mostly responsible\nfor the visual aurora, extensively studied with ground- and\nsatellite-based optical instruments. More energetic particles\n(>20 keV) enhance electron densities in the lower E- and D-\nregions (<100 km). The higher abundance of free electrons\nabsorb more extra-terrestrial (ET) radio waves in the lower\nVHF frequency range (30\u201350 MHz) resulting in less ET ra-\ndio wave intensity reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. This phe-\nnomenon is known as cosmic noise absorption or CNA. It\nis routinely measured by ground-based relative ionospheric\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n474 A. C. Kellerman et al.: Auroral absorption, currents and convection\nopacity meters (riometers), which are widely used to mon-\nitor and study high-energy particles and their precipitation\n(see, for example, reviews by Stauning, 1996a,b).\nThe enhanced electron densities in the lower ionosphere\nalso result in enhanced electrical conductances (height-\nintegrated conductivities) and, for constant electric fields, in-\ntensification of the auroral electrojet current. The changes in\nthe electrojet currents are monitored by magnetometers that\nmeasure perturbations in the local geomagnetic field (e.g.\nAmm, 2001). The ambient plasma, consisting of cold parti-\ncles with energies of <1 keV in the crossed electric E and\nmagnetic B fields, move with the E\u00d7B convection drift.\nMuch research effort has been devoted to studies of global\nionospheric plasma convection, as this information is criti-\ncal to our understanding of the magnetospheric-ionospheric\nsystem and the ionospheric response to changes or transitions\nfrom one IMF state to another (e.g. Ruohoniemi et al., 2002).\nUnderstanding the relationships between various auroral\nphenomena has been at the heart of space physics research\nfor the past 50 years (e.g. Meng et al., 1991). The magneto-\nsphere and solar wind are coupled to the auroral ionosphere\nand hence studies of relationships between auroral phenom-\nena are directly relevant to these coupling processes. De-\nspite significant progress, there is still considerable scope to\nincrease and refine the understanding of the links between\nplasma convection, conductances and current systems ob-\nserved at high altitudes, as discussed below.\nAuroral absorption and electrical conductances are closely\nrelated as both are height-integrated characteristics propor-\ntional to the plasma density and the electron collision fre-\nquency. This was confirmed experimentally by Walker and\nBhatnagar (1989) and, more recently, by Senior et al. (2007).\nThe Hall conductance 6H was shown to be more strongly\nrelated to CNA than Pedersen conductance 6P and the cor-\nrelation between 6H and CNA was shown to vary with mag-\nnetic local time or MLT (Senior et al., 2007). The correlation\nbetween 6H and CNA was found to be considerable in all\nMLT sectors except for 15:00\u201319:00 MLT.\nThe CNA measured by a riometer has also been shown\nto depend indirectly on the electric field. This occurs when\nstrong electric fields drive plasma waves that in turn inter-\nact with electrons increasing their temperatures and effective\ncollision frequencies (St.-Maurice et al., 1981; Schlegel and\nSt.-Maurice, 1981). The enhanced collision frequency may\nresult in an increased CNA and such events were indeed iden-\ntified in the polar cap, where the much stronger effects due\nto enhanced precipitation are not as pronounced as in the au-\nroral zone (Stauning, 1984). These events are known as elec-\ntron heating absorption or EHA events (Stauning, 1996a).\nThe electrojet current intensity has been shown to depend\non both the electric field and the plasma density\/conductivity,\nas expected from Ohm\u2019s law. Kamide and Vickrey (1983)\ndemonstrated that the westward electrojet is split into two re-\ngions: a conductivity-dominant region and an electric-field-\ndominant region. The location of the transition within the\nwestward electrojet has been found to vary with latitude, the\nhigher the latitude, the earlier in MLT it occurs (see their\nFig. 6). A similar latitude dependence has been found for the\npre-midnight transition between the eastward and westward\nelectrojets, coinciding with a transition from an electric-\nfield- to a conductivity-dominant regime (Kamide and Vick-\nrey, 1983; Davies and Lester, 1999). Kamide and Vickrey\n(1983) thus found that the electric field exerts a dominant\nrole in the evening and late morning sectors. More recently,\nSugino et al. (2002) showed that the conductivity-dominant\nregion can extend to 08:00 MLT just after the dawn termina-\ntor.\nPrevious studies of the current-conductance-E-field rela-\ntionship have mostly used the data collected using incoher-\nent scatter radars (ISRs) that provide plasma convection ve-\nlocity (electric field) data and information on conductivi-\nties in the limited range of altitudes (typically 90\u2013300 km).\nFrom this information the ionospheric currents are inferred\nusing Ohm\u2019s law (e.g. Davies and Lester, 1999; Sugino et al.,\n2002). In this approach all 3 parameters are provided by the\nsame instrument at the same resolution and all the measure-\nments are coincident and simultaneous. On the other hand,\nISR is an expensive instrument with which to observe pro-\ncesses in the upper atmosphere. As a result they typically\ndo not operate continuously for extended periods of time, i.e.\nmonths or years. Riometers and magnetometers, on the other\nhand, are passive instruments and are inexpensive to operate.\nAs a result they function nearly continuously, under all con-\nditions. They also provide observations integrated over the\nfull ionospheric height profile. In addition, in previous stud-\nies, the solar and particle components of conductances were\nnot considered separately as current depends on the total Hall\nand Pedersen conductances. Previous studies have also con-\ncentrated on nightside observations with the full MLT depen-\ndence including dayside sectors still less investigated.\nIn this study, we employ the CNA riometer measurements\nas a proxy for conductance in conjunction with the electric\nfield and current measurements by an incoherent radar and\nmagnetometer, respectively, to statistically investigate the re-\nlationships between the ionospheric electric fields, electrical\nconductances and current systems. A significant dataset is\nemployed in order (1) to assess the potential of riometers\nin studies involving conductance estimates and in particu-\nlar in studies of the relative importance of the electric field\nand conductance to ionospheric currents in all time sectors\nincluding the dayside and (2) to investigate the electric-field-\nabsorption relationship and to determine whether electron\nheating absorption events are observed in the auroral zone.\n2 Experimental data\nIn this study we used CNA measurements obtained by\nthe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) in\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E, 65.90\u25e6 MLAT).

Kellerman et al.: Auroral absorption, currents and convection 475\noperates at 38.2 MHz and uses a single phased array of 8\u00d78\ndipole antennae to form 50 beams: one wide beam and 49\nnarrow beams as shown in Fig. 1 (Browne et al., 1995). The\ntime resolution is 1 s although some post-integration is usu-\nally employed in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio\nwith a post-integration period of 1 min typically used. Sim-\nilar to numerous previous studies, the absorption measure-\nments in dB employed in this study were obtained from the\nIRIS raw power using methods and techniques implemented\nin the standard IRIS software (Marple and Honary, 2004).\nThe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) tri-static UHF\n(929.5 MHz) radar was also used in this study (Rishbeth\nand Williams, 1985). It consists of 3 parabolic dish anten-\nnas. The main antenna, located near Troms\u00f8 in Norway\n(69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E, 66.2\u25e6 MLAT, Fig. 1), combines both trans-\nmitting and receiving capabilities. The other two remote re-\nceivers are located in Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland (67.4\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E,\n63.6\u25e6 MLAT) and Kiruna, Sweden (67.9\u25e6 N, 20.5\u25e6 E, 64.5\u25e6\nMLAT). In the CP1 common program, the data from which\nwere used in this study, the UHF transmitter beam from\nTroms\u00f8 is aligned with the local F-region magnetic-field-line\ndirection at an elevation of about 77\u25e6 and azimuth of 182\u25e6.\nThe EISCAT radar measures the ion and electron tempera-\ntures, plasma density and line-of-sight ion velocity. The full\nion velocity vector is determined within the tri-static volume.\nIn the relatively collisionless regime of the F-region, the ions\nmove with the E\u00d7B velocity, and hence the ion velocity\nmeasurements by EISCAT are representative of the electric\nfield (e.g. Davies et al., 1999; Davies and Lester, 1999). Fig-\nure 1 displays the location of the tri-static volume and the re-\nceiver beam directions (in blue) in CP1-K mode of EISCAT.\nThe red (green) circle represents the location of the tri-static\n(projected tri-static) volume at 278-km (110-km) altitude. As\nthe electric field is approximately the same along the mag-\nnetic field line, the tri-static volume was projected down to\n110 km using the IGRF model. Figure 1 shows that in the E-\nand D-regions, it is the closest to the IRIS beam 16 and in\nthis study the data from this beam were employed.\nThe International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Ef-\nfects (IMAGE) Troms\u00f8 magnetometer measures local mag-\nnetic perturbations in three perpendicular directions (Lu\u00a8hr\net al., 1998). The position of the magnetometer is indicated\nby a red triangle in Fig. 1, which maps close to the pro-\njected tri-static volume. The 20-s resolution data were post-\nintegrated to give 1-min averages for this study. In order\nto obtain a Quiet Day Curve (QDC) for the magnetometer\ndata, 2\u20134 days were chosen that were as close to each se-\nlected event as possible and that exhibited minimal perturba-\ntions. The dataset was then averaged for these quiet days and\nFourier transformed. The number of harmonics was limited\nto 6 and then the inverse transform was taken to give the QDC\nfor the event. The total horizontal magnetic perturbations \u03b4H\nwere obtained from components using \u03b4H 2=\u03b4X2+\u03b4Y 2.\nThe events in this study were selected based on the avail-\nability of the tri-static ion drift velocity data from EISCAT.\n15 25\n70\nBeam 16\nTroms\u00f8\n20\n69\nKilpisjarvi\u00a8\nKiruna\nTri-static\nvolume\nSodankyla\u00a8\nFig. 1.

The \u22123 dB beams at the corners of the array are\nnot shown as the antenna side lobes are too large. The 3 blue lines\nshow the receiver beams from the EISCAT in the CP1-K common\nmode. The red circle shows the position of the tri-static volume at\nan altitude of 278 km. The green circle illustrates the position of the\ntri-static volume projected down the magnetic field line to 110 km\nin the E-region. At this height it is closest to beam 16 of the IRIS.\nThe orange triangle is the position of the Troms\u00f8 magnetometer,\nwhich maps close to the projected tri-static volume.\nThe data from the CP1-K common mode for 46 days in\n1995\u20131999 were analysed. An extended dataset compris-\ning all available IRIS and IMAGE Troms\u00f8 data in Febru-\nary 1995\u2013January 1999 was also used in one part of this\nstudy (Sect. 3.3). All EISCAT velocity measurements above\n2000 m\/s and all IRIS absorption measurements below 0 dB\nwere excluded. The effects of radio scintillations due to\nthe passage of Cassiopeia over the IRIS field-of-view (FoV)\nwere also removed from the IRIS data. The data from IRIS\nand IMAGE were then temporally matched with the EISCAT\ndata to form a dataset comprised of simultaneous measure-\nments.\nThe EISCAT conductivities were calculated from the elec-\ntron densities and ion and electron temperatures measured\nby EISCAT using a method described by Makarevitch et al.\n(2004). The height-integrated conductivities or conductances\nwere then computed using the height range of 90\u2013275 km.\nSimilar conductance estimates were employed by numerous\nprevious studies (e.g. Davies and Lester, 1999; Senior et al.,\n2007). To determine the particle component of conductances,\nthe solar effects were removed from each conductance\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 473\u2013486, 2009\n476 A. C.

The solar\ncomponent was calculated from the solar conductance model\nproposed by Robinson and Vondrak (1984).\n3 Observations\n3.1 Point-by-point comparisons and correlation\nanalysis\nIn this section the relationships between magnetic perturba-\ntions, CNA, and the field-perpendicular component of the ion\ndrift velocity are explored for both the entire dataset and for\ndifferent MLT sectors. The data have been matched spatially\nand temporally, comprising of data points with three values\nrepresenting the electrojet current strength, the Hall conduc-\ntance, and the ionospheric electric field, respectively. Two\nparameters are plotted against each other in a 2-D format\nwhile either the occurrence or the mean value for the third\nparameter is represented by the colour of the plot cell.\nThe comparisons over the entire dataset are displayed in\nFig. 2. Panels (a, b) to (e, f) display the 2-D plots of perturba-\ntion versus velocity, perturbation versus absorption, and ab-\nsorption versus velocity, respectively. The left-column pan-\nels show the percentage occurrence of points for each cell,\nwhile the right-column panels are colour-coded in absorp-\ntion, velocity, and perturbation, respectively, with the colour\nshowing the averaged value over all measurements inside a\ngiven plot cell. The white histogram is the bin-averaged pa-\nrameter variation. The linear Pearson correlation co-efficient\nfor the entire dataset is shown in the top-left corner of left-\ncolumn panels along with the total number of points. The\npanels from (a, b) to (e, f) contain 91%, 83% and 81%, re-\nspectively, of the total points available after the previously\ndefined restrictions were applied (Sect. 2).\nFigure 2a shows an overall increase of perturbation with\nion velocity, which is reflected in the overall positive corre-\nlation co-efficient of 0.47 and in the steady increase of the\nbin-averaged perturbation with ion velocity. There is some\nstructuring in the corresponding panel (b) due to absorption\nvariation which is evident in the colour coding. That is, the\nred and yellow cells tend to be in the top-left part of the di-\nagram with steady increase occurring in mean absorption as\n\u03b4H increases and velocity decreases. This suggests that con-\nductance also contributes to the electrojet current.\nAnother way of studying the perturbation-absorption\n(current-conductance) relationship is presented in panels\n(c,d) where a direct comparison is made between perturba-\ntion and absorption; the colour coding in panel (d) is now in\nthe EISCAT ion velocity. This panel reveals some increase in\nmagnetic perturbation with absorption. However, the corre-\nlation co-efficient is somewhat lower in panel (d) (0.32 ver-\nsus 0.47). The colour coding in velocity, on the other hand,\ndisplays obvious structuring indicating an increase in pertur-\nbation with velocity (red cells are higher and blue cells are\nlower), in agreement with the correlation between perturba-\ntion and ion velocity observed in panel (b). The analysis of\nthe entire dataset thus suggests that, on average, the electric\nfield control of current is stronger than that of conductance\nAnn.

Scatter plots of magnetic perturbation versus ion velocity for different MLT sectors. The correlation and total number of points are\nalso shown in the top-left corner of each panel.

The bin-averaged perturbation is shown by the red histogram.\nas the correlation was higher in panel (b) and structuring was\nmore pronounced in panel (d).\nThe comparisons between perturbation and ion velocity\n(absorption) have demonstrated positive correlation and ob-\nvious structuring in Fig. 2b (Fig. 2d). In panels (e, f) ab-\nsorption and velocity are compared directly with the colour\ncoding in panel (f) in the IMAGE magnetic perturbation.\nThis comparison reveals no significant correlation or anti-\ncorrelation between these parameters for the entire dataset.\nData does seem, however, to be spread along the both axes\nin panel (f) suggesting a possible inverse proportionality re-\nlationship, which is also evident in the 2-D occurrence plot\nof panel (e). This is emphasized in panel (f) by structuring\nof the cells according to colour with blue (red) cells gener-\nally closer to (farther from) the axes. Red cells (large mean\nperturbations) are observed in the top-right quadrant of the\ndiagram where both absorption and velocity are large.\nAlthough some correlation was found when analysing the\nthree parameters over the entire dataset, the temporal vari-\nation of this correlation was not investigated. In the latter\npart of this section we investigate the time variation of these\ncorrelations in three-hour MLT blocks (MLT=UT+2.7). This\nshould give an indication of how the conductance and electric\nfield control of electric current varies with MLT.\nIn Fig. 3 the data have been divided into 8 three-hour time\nsectors by MLT. For each time sector the perturbation is plot-\nted against the ion drift velocity. The correlation is shown,\nalong with the number of points in the top-left corner of each\npanel. The colour coding is in absorption and is the same\nfor all time sectors as displayed on the right of the figure.\nThe dark red pluses represent points without colour coding\ninformation that were nevertheless included in the correla-\ntion analysis. The figure shows that the correlation is high-\nest just after magnetic noon (0.90 at 12:00-15:00 MLT) and\nstays quite high until 21:00 MLT where it sharply decreases\nto 0.28. It is minimised in the midnight sector before ris-\ning again in the morning sector (03:00-06:00 MLT). The two\nfeatures of interest in the figure are the rapid increase in cor-\nrelation at 12:00 MLT and the sharp decrease at 21:00 MLT\nwith the colour coding in absorption also showing some in-\nteresting results. There is more data structuring near mid-\nnight (where red points are at the top and black points are at\nthe bottom) and less in the afternoon, possibly indicating a\nhigher correlation between absorption and perturbation near\nmidnight and less correlation near noon, which is explored\nnext.\nThe IMAGE perturbation and the IRIS absorption are\ncompared in Fig. 4, which has the same format as Fig. 3\nwith colour coding now in the EISCAT ion velocity. The\nresults clearly display the expected pattern: the data show a\ntemporal variation in correlation that is roughly opposite to\nthat observed in Fig. 3. Correlation is highest (lowest) in the\n21:00-06:00 MLT (09:00-21:00 MLT) sector. In other words,\nit is maximised in the post-midnight sector and minimised in\nthe afternoon sector. There is also a sharp increase in corre-\nlation across the 21:00 MLT border and a moderate decrease\nthrough the 03:00-09:00 MLT sector.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/ Ann.

The correlation is highest\nin the post-midnight\/early-morning sector 00:00\u201306:00 MLT\n(0.30) and very low for the other time sectors.

Figure 6a suggests that, overall, the\nelectric field exerted more dominance over the electrojet cur-\nrents than the conductance. Thus both the overall and maxi-\nmum correlations are higher for \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) than \u03c1(\u03b4H,A):\n0.47 and 0.90 versus 0.32 and 0.76. Also, roughly com-\nplementary trends\/relationships are observed in Fig. 6a, i.e.\nthe current-velocity correlation is substantial whenever the\ncurrent-absorption correlation is low and vice versa.\nWe have also performed a similar correlation analysis with\nthe actual Hall conductance rather than with its proxy. The\nmagnetic perturbation correlations with the total (with so-\nlar contribution) and particle component of Hall conduc-\ntance were determined for each 3-h MLT sector. The re-\nsults are presented in Fig. 6b. All three types of correla-\ntion shown in red in Fig. 6 show a very similar picture. Re-\ncalling that CNA is not representative of the Hall conduc-\ntance at 15:00\u201319:00 MLT (Senior et al., 2007), we observe\nthat the \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) and \u03c1(\u03b4H,6Part) correlations exhibit a\ngenerally good agreement outside of the 15:00\u201321:00 MLT\nsector. The \u03c1(\u03b4H,6Tot) and \u03c1(\u03b4H,6Part) are also quite\nclose with the differences most pronounced on the day-\nside, in particular at 09:00\u201312:00 and 15:00\u201318:00 MLT.\nThe only observation inconsistent with our simple paradigm\nsuggesting that absorption is a good proxy for particle\ncomponent of conductance is at 06:00\u201309:00 MLT when\n\u03c1(\u03b4H,A)<\u03c1(\u03b4H,6Part)\u223c=\u03c1(\u03b4H,6Tot), which may be due\nto a failure of the solar conductivity model to fully remove\nsolar effects for this particular subset of data.\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\n21\n00\n03\nVernal\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\nAll years\n(a)\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\n21\n00\n03\nSummer\n(b)\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\n21\n00\nMagnetic Local Time\n03\nAutumnal\n(c)\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\n21\n00\nMagnetic Local Time\n03\nWinter\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nCorrelation\n(d)\nFig. 7.

Our novel ap-\nproach involving simultaneous and coincident magnetometer\nand riometer measurements provides a unique opportunity\nto explore in more detail the statistical current-conductance\nrelationship (using CNA as a proxy). In this section, we\nemploy an extended Troms\u00f8 magnetometer\/IRIS riometer\ndataset collected over the 4 years February 1995\u2013January\n1999. This period is selected to include 81 days around\nequinoxes and solstices, that is why 4 calendar years 1995\u2013\n1998 are shifted by 1 month. Both datasets have 1-min time\nresolution so that up to 1440 data points are available for\neach day. The large amount of data also allowed us to im-\nprove drastically the time resolution of the correlation analy-\nsis. This has been done by calculating the boxcar correlation\nco-efficients for a 1-h period centered on every minute. The\nboxcar correlation dataset thus comprised 1440 values (for\neach min) with each of them calculated using up to 60 Nd\npoints, where Nd is the number of days in a considered pe-\nriod.\nFigure 7 includes 4 clock diagrams, similar to Fig. 6, con-\ntaining data restricted to 81 days centered on the equinoxes\nand solstices with panels (a) to (d) showing correlations for\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/ Ann.

The\nyear specified for each circular band in panel (a) is that at the\nstart of each 81-day period. The correlation co-efficients for\nall years combined are also shown in the innermost circular\nband (Nd=324). The correlation is represented by the colour\nas shown by the colour bar in the centre of the plot.\nFigure 7 shows a lot more detail in correlation as a func-\ntion of MLT than Fig. 6. For majority of the years, the re-\ngion of high correlation extends from 21:00 to 06:00 MLT\nduring the equinoctial periods, panels (a) and (c), which is\nalso reflected in all-years correlations. During the summer\nperiod, panel (b), it is shifted later into the morning and cov-\ners a smaller MLT range (02:00\u201307:00 MLT). There is also\nan \u201canomalous\u201d region of very high correlation near local\nnoon for summer 1996. The winter period, panel (d), dis-\nplays highly variable correlation with no clearly defined re-\ngion of high correlation consistent over the years. The cor-\nrelation on the dayside before 12:00 MLT, however, is no-\nticeably higher than in other seasons. One can conclude that\nthe current-absorption correlation exhibits a distinct seasonal\ndependence. One should bear in mind though that the corre-\nlation values at 15:00\u201319:00 MLT are not representative of\nthe current-conductance correlation (Senior et al., 2007).\n3.4 Hourly correlation analysis\nFigures 3\u20135 summarised in Fig. 6a revealed that the correla-\ntion between the 3 parameters varied throughout the day. The\ncorrelation co-efficients were calculated for each 3-h sector.\nIn Sect. 3.3 the correlation co-efficients were also computed\nusing 1-h boxcar periods. In both analyses the correlations\nwere calculated for all events combined together. In this sec-\ntion the correlation is further examined using a different anal-\nysis. The correlation co-efficients are calculated at hourly in-\ntervals for each event and then averaged over the 46 events\nfor each hourly period in MLT. We will refer to these val-\nues as \u201chourly\u201d correlations to distinguish from \u201c1-h\u201d box-\ncar correlations from Sect. 3.3 and \u201c3-h\u201d correlations from\nSects. 3.1\u20133.2. A similar hourly correlation analysis was em-\nployed earlier by Makarevitch and Honary (2005).\nThe correlation co-efficient for each hourly period was\nonly calculated and entered into the dataset if there were suf-\nficient number of points in the hourly period. This was de-\ntermined by comparing the data available for each hour to\nthe maximum number of data points that the instrument was\ncapable of collecting during the hour (typically 30 points for\nEISCAT and 60 points for IRIS and IMAGE). If this number\nwas greater than 60% then the number of points was deemed\nsufficient.\nIn order to compare the results from the hourly correlation\nanalysis with those presented in Figs. 3\u20136, the mean and me-\ndian hourly correlation co-efficients were calculated over the\nentire dataset for each of the 3 pairs of parameters. These are\npresented as a function of MLT in Fig. 8. The 3-h values from\nFigs. 3\u20135 are also shown for reference by the orange lines.\nThe extended IMAGE\/IRIS dataset of Sect. 3.3 was em-\nployed in panel (b) to compute 1-h boxcar correlations (light\nblue) over the entire 4-year dataset (Nd=365.25\u00d74=1461).\nThe 1-h boxcar correlations for the extended dataset show\nvery similar variation to 3-h values. Panel (a) clearly shows\nthe hourly correlation \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) starting low in the midnight\nto early morning sector, then rising quickly after 12:00 MLT\nand reaching a maximum just after the 12:00\u201315:00 MLT\nsector. It then drops off more smoothly through the after-\nnoon. An almost opposite pattern is observed between per-\nturbation and absorption \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) in panel (b). The correla-\ntion is highest just post-midnight between 02:00\u201303:00 MLT\nand smoothly drops off to reach a minimum during the\n12:00\u201315:00 MLT sector. It then rises again to higher values\npre-midnight. Panel (c) displays a low correlation \u03c1(A,Ui)\nthroughout the day with minimal variation, although a small\nanti-correlation is observed in the afternoon. All these results\nare consistent with those from the previous analysis as both\nthe mean and median trends behave in a similar fashion to the\nAnn.

The hourly correlations are smaller than ei-\nther 3-h or 1-h boxcar values, which is most likely indicative\nof some over-averaging occurring in this approach.\n3.5 Electron heating absorption\nThe two analyses presented in the previous sections (Figs. 3\nand 8) revealed that the data from the afternoon sector exhib-\nited enhanced correlation between magnetic perturbation and\nion velocity. This suggested that the electric field is a pre-\ndominant factor in determining the electrojet current strength\nin the afternoon. One can argue that the correlation between\nconductance and electric fields should be maximised during\nthe periods when the correlation between perturbation and\nion velocity is close to 1. In this situation, the electric field\naffects the current both directly (as current is proportional to\nthe electric field J\u221dE) and indirectly through conductance,\ncollision frequency, and temperature (J\u221d6\u221d\u03bde\u221dT 1\/2e ) with\nthe latter increasing with electric field. This should result in\nthe maximum correlation observed. To test this idea, 9 days\nexhibiting high hourly correlations between perturbation and\nion velocity were extracted from the dataset. On average, the\nperiod of maximum correlation for each interval was found\nto be close to the high correlation period of 12:00-15:00 MLT\nin Fig. 3 and this 3-h period was selected as the common\nperiod for all 9 days. The days selected, in \u201cyyyymmdd\u201d\nformat, were: 19950301, 19950302, 19950329, 19950928,\n19960214, 19960619, 19961211, 19970515 and 19990212.\nFigure 9 displays a comparison between absorption and\nion velocity for the high correlation period days. The dia-\ngram format is the same as for each panel in Fig. 5. However,\nin Fig. 9 the dataset is restricted to the 12:00\u201315:00 MLT sec-\ntor for the 9 selected days. An inverse proportionality is\napparent in the data, similar to that observed in the 09:00-\n15:00 MLT sectors in Fig. 5. The red line represents a curve\nof inverse proportionality defined by A=200\/Ui , where A is\nthe IRIS absorption and Ui is magnitude of the EISCAT ion\ndrift velocity. The choice of a constant in this simple model\nis rather arbitrary; for this study a value of 200 dB\/m\/s was\nselected to best represent the structuring of the data, in par-\nticular that the upper envelope of the data points follows the\ninverse proportionality curve. As will be argued later, this\nfeature is consistent with the notion of limiting of the current\nby the magnetospheric generator. No significant correlation\nbetween the ion velocity and absorption is found in this ap-\nproach though.\nThe electron heating effects are expected to exhibit a\nthreshold in the ion drift velocity as the two-stream instability\n(which is responsible for electron heating) is only operational\nwhen the drift velocity exceeds the ion acoustic speed. The\naccepted value for the threshold velocity is \u223c400 m\/s (e.g.\nFejer and Kelley, 1980, and references therein). However,\nFig. 9 showed little evidence of absorption increase with the\nion drift velocity (expected in the EHA mechanism) either at\nsmall or at large, above-the-threshold ion velocities.\n0 2 4 6 8\nVelocity, 100 m\/s\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nIR\nIS\n A\nbs\nor\npt\nio\nn,\n d\nB\nCorrelation: -0.374\nPoints: 629\nA = 200\/Ui\n \n \n \n \n \n     \nFig. 9.

The format is the same\nas for each panel in Fig. 5. The red curve represents an inverse\nproportionality trend described by the equation shown on the graph.\nAnother approach is to consider the absorption depen-\ndence on the electron temperature Te as this is expected to\nshow a more direct effect on absorption through collision\nfrequency: A\u221d\u03bde\u221dT 1\/2e . The electron temperature in the E-\nregion centre, in turn, is expected to show some dependence\non the drift velocity above the velocity threshold (e.g. Davies\nand Robinson, 1997). Consequently, in the following analy-\nsis only the Te data points at a height of 111 km and above\nthe certain temperature threshold were considered. Simi-\nlar to Davies and Robinson (1997), the electron temperature\ndata were obtained using the alternating code technique. The\nelectron and ion temperatures were derived from the separa-\ntion and sharpness of the two peaks in the ion acoustic spec-\ntra measured by EISCAT; no equality between them was as-\nsumed (Rishbeth and Williams, 1985).\nThe threshold values for temperature were determined for\ndifferent 3-h MLT sectors as follows. The electron temper-\natures were plotted versus the ion drift velocity (not shown\nhere). These plots showed a quadratic-like temperature in-\ncrease with velocity but with different rates of increase for\ndifferent MLT. This result was reminiscent of the similar\nquadratic dependence found to well represent the ion acous-\ntic speed Cs=A+BU2i with fitting co-efficients A and B de-\npendent on MLT (e.g. Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985; Makare-\nvich et al., 2007). In this study, we used a similar approach,\nin which a quadratic function of the form Te=C+DU2i was\nfitted to the data for each MLT sector. The threshold elec-\ntron temperature T \u2217e for each MLT sector was found by\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 473\u2013486, 2009\n482 A. C.

Above\nT \u2217e , the electron temperature should be affected by the heat-\ning associated with the unstable two-stream waves (see our\nSect. 1). Thus one can further explore the electron heating\neffects by restricting the absorption versus electron tempera-\nture data to above-the-threshold values.\nThe results of this analysis are displayed in Fig. 10 which\nshows absorption versus the electron temperature colour-\ncoded in MLT. Figure 10 shows that, overall, there appears\nto be no direct relationship between the two parameters ei-\nther near the threshold (300\u2013400 K) or well above it (e.g.\n>600 K). Interestingly, a possible inverse proportionality re-\nlationship can be recognized, similar to that in Fig. 9. One\ncan conclude thus that little evidence of electron heating ab-\nsorption was observed in this study.\n4 Discussion\nIn this paper, the magnetic perturbations, ion velocity, and\nabsorption were compared and the relationship between the\ncurrent, electric field, and conductance in the auroral region\nwas studied. Compared to previous studies, the MLT cov-\nerage was extended to all time sectors including the day-\nside and the height-integrated characteristic of absorption\nwas used as a proxy for the ionospheric conductance in-\nstead of the conductance estimates from incoherent radars.\nAlso, most of the previous statistical studies have drawn\ntheir conclusions from analysis and comparison of the aver-\naged\/median MLT variations of the electric fields, currents,\nand conductances. In this study, we used a somewhat dif-\nferent approach in which the measurements were compared\nand correlated within each MLT sector, Sects. 3.1\u20133.2. We\nalso employed a significantly larger dataset of simultaneous\nmagnetometer\/riometer observations collected over 4 years\nto statistically investigate the current-absorption relationship\nin Sect. 3.3. This approach was complemented by the hourly\ncorrelation analysis of Sect. 3.4.\n4.1 Electric field and conductance control of currents\nAn important thing to bear in mind while interpreting the re-\nsults of the current study is that riometer measurements pro-\nvide information on the particle component of conductance.\nOne can expect that on the dayside the correlation between\nthe current intensity and total conductance (due to both solar\nradiation and precipitation) would be larger. Figure 6b sup-\nports this assumption with most time sectors showing larger\ncorrelation with the total conductance. The fact that in one\ntime sector (15:00\u201318:00 MLT) the correlation was signifi-\ncantly smaller (0.25 vs. 0.37) suggests that this simple view\nis not necessarily always correct.\nFrom above, one should be careful when drawing con-\nclusions in relation to the relative importance of electric\nfield and conductance based on the \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) correlation\nonly. However, it is reasonable to expect that the solar con-\ntribution would not change the correlation so significantly\nso that it will exceed the \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) correlation in the sec-\ntors where \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) is low and \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) is high, i.e. at\n09:00\u201321:00 MLT. Again, this is strongly supported by Fig. 6\nthat shows that the enhanced correlation due to inclusion\nof the solar conductance \u03c1(\u03b4H,6Tot) still does not exceed\n\u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui). By the same token, if \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) is substantially\ngreater than \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) (at 21:00\u201309;00 MLT) and hence the\nparticle component conductivity dominates over the electric\nfield, this is likely to be the case for the total conductance as\nwell, which agrees well with Fig. 6.\nAnother possible complication is that magnetometers pro-\nvide information on the Hall current rather than the to-\ntal (Hall and Pedersen) current. However, as absorption\nis closely related to the Hall conductance, the comparisons\nperformed in this study involve the three parameters that\nare expected to be related via a simple proportionality rule:\nJH=6HUiB. One has to nevertheless bear in mind that in-\nterpreting the observations in terms of the total current may\nnot be so simple in some cases. One important case though\nwhen this is possible is when the Hall and Pedersen currents\nvary synchronously, which happens when they are both con-\ntrolled by the electric field. That is, one can assume that high\n\u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) values imply high total-current-electric-field cor-\nrelation. This means that our results and conclusions from\nthe dayside are unlikely to be affected, which is important\nas this was the region that was less investigated in the past.\nIn addition, the same approach involving the Hall current es-\ntimates from magnetometer measurements has been adopted\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 473\u2013486, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/\nA. C. Kellerman et al.: Auroral absorption, currents and convection 483\nby other researchers (e.g. Kamide and Vickrey, 1983), so that\ncomparisons with their results will provide a straightforward\nway of verifying our results and conclusions.\nKamide and Vickrey (1983) and Davies and Lester (1999)\ndemonstrated that on the nightside throughout the eastward\nconvection electrojet the electric field is the dominant fac-\ntor and that the Hall conductance tends to dominate in the\nwestward electrojet. So the transition from the eastward to\nwestward electrojets is commonly believed to coincide with a\ntransition from electric-field- to conductance-driven currents.\nIn our observations, the transition between MLT sectors with\nhigh and low \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) occurred at 21:00 MLT in Fig. 6a,\nwhich is consistent with pre-midnight location of transition\nfrom the eastward to westward electrojets.\nInterestingly, \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) values temporarily increased\nagain at 03:00\u201306:00 MLT. This feature may be related to\nthe transition between the conductivity- and electric-field-\ndominant regions reported by Kamide and Vickrey (1983) to\noccur in the late morning (near 03:00 MLT) within the west-\nward electrojet. Extending the same argument further to-\nwards the dayside, one can propose that a drop in \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui)\nat 06:00\u201309:00 MLT is due to relative weakening of the elec-\ntric field control in this time sector. Statistically, Sugino et al.\n(2002) showed that for all Kp conditions the electric field\norientation switched from southward to northward in the late\nmorning sector, just prior to 12:00 MLT, which is normally\na characteristic of a change from the westward to eastward\nconvection electrojets. The substantial increase in \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui)\nacross the 12:00 MLT boundary and considerable \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui)\ncorrelations at 09:00\u201321:00 MLT observed in this study thus\nsuggest that the entire eastward convection electrojet is dom-\ninated by the electric field including the dayside.\nThis is contrary to the situation in the westward electro-\njet that exhibited consistently large values of \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) al-\nthough variable \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) correlations. The former fea-\nture suggests that the westward electrojet is predominantly\nconductivity-driven. This result disagrees somewhat with\nthat by Kamide and Vickrey (1983) who demonstrated that\nthe westward electrojet in the late morning sector is electric-\nfield-dominant. However, this result is consistent with the\nstatistical study by Davies and Lester (1999) who also did\nnot observe the opposite transition within the westward elec-\ntrojet. An increase in \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) observed in our study at\n03:00\u201306:00 MLT was reminiscent of this opposite transi-\ntion, however the \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) value was still quite substantial\n(0.65) so that, overall, it is difficult to conclude whether the\nelectric-field-dominant region is observed within the west-\nward electrojet on a statistical basis using the EISCAT-\nrestricted events. One possible reason is that this feature\nmay only be seen during substorm intervals. However, the\nresults of Fig. 7 based on the extended dataset showed that\nconductivity-dominant region is 21:00\u201306:00 MLT near the\nequinoxes and only 02:00\u201307:00 MLT in summer. Thus the\nstatistical behaviour near the equinoxes is in agreement with\nKamide and Vickrey (1983).\nAn extension of the conductivity-driven region into the\nlate morning up to 09:00 MLT suggested by the present\nstudy is also in rough agreement with the conductivity-\ndominant interval of 20:00\u201308:00 MLT proposed by Sugino\net al. (2002). These authors observed two peaks of con-\nductivity dominance: one near midnight and one in the late\nmorning around 06:00 MLT. This result also agrees well with\nour observations that showed a significant drop in \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui)\nat 06:00\u201309:00 MLT. One should note that the positive dif-\nference between \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) and \u03c1(\u03b4H,Ui) in the 06:00\u2013\n09:00 MLT sector becomes even larger if solar contribu-\ntion to conductance is taken into account, Fig. 6b, so that\nthe above conclusion that the entire westward electrojet is\nconductivity-dominant is not affected.\nFigure 6a also shows that high \u03c1(\u03b4H,A) correlation starts\nabruptly at 21:00 MLT, continues through the midnight sec-\ntor, and stretches out into the morning sector where it slowly\ndeclines. We believe that this slow decline may be attributed\nto the slowly varying absorption (SVA) effect (Stauning,\n1996a) as described below. The energetic particle precipi-\ntation could easily ionise particles in the upper D- to lower\nE-regions to which the Hall conductivity and CNA are most\nsensitive. Satellite observations employed by Collis et al.\n(1984) showed that the spectrum of drifting electrons hard-\nens with increasing time up to 09:00 MLT, which for the\nsame particle flux would cause a larger detected CNA and\ncorrelation with the Hall current. The sharp fall in \u03c1(\u03b4H,A)\nacross the 09:00 MLT border is consistent with this idea. The\nsteady decrease in correlation through the morning sector to\n09:00 MLT seems to be inconsistent with Collis et al. (1984),\nas one would expect the correlation to increase with the hard-\nening electron spectrum. However, the decline in correlation\nwith increasing MLT may be related to the eventual deple-\ntion of the electron clouds drifting around the Earth east-\nward towards the dayside. This results in more energetic but\nless intense precipitation, which would contribute less to the\nconductance. Local substorms are also more likely to occur\nat 19:00\u201304:00 MLT, which would enhance the conductance\nand hence the current together with the CNA detected by the\nIRIS at these times. Substorms thus may account, in part, for\nthe larger correlation observed at earlier MLT.\nComing back to the seasonal dependence of current-\nabsorption correlation, Fig. 7 revealed that the high corre-\nlation region was wider in MLT near the equinoxes than in\nsummer. This may be simply due to the larger absorption\nvalues during equinoxes (Ranta et al., 1983), which is itself\npossibly one of the manifestations of the Russell-McPherron\neffect (Russell and McPherron, 1973). However, in this in-\nterpretation the correlations should be larger in winter than\nin summer as well, which is not seen in Fig. 7. Another in-\nteresting feature that is difficult to explain is that the corre-\nlations are lower near midnight 00:00 MLT and higher near\ndawn 06:00 MLT in summer than near equinoxes so that the\nhigh-correlation region is observed at 02:00\u201307:00 MLT. The\nsecond observation may be related to an increase in particle\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 473\u2013486, 2009\n484 A. C. Kellerman et al.: Auroral absorption, currents and convection\nnumber flux on the dayside and a corresponding increase in\nenergy flux in summer as compared to winter reported by\nLiou et al. (2001) (see their plates 3\u20135), while the first obser-\nvation appears not to have a direct counterpart in low-energy\n(<10 keV) particle observations. This suggests that absorp-\ntion signatures of the high-energy particles, in particular in\nthe context of their relationship with auroral currents, are sig-\nnificantly different from their low-energy counterparts.\nOur observations suggest that, on average, the\nconductance- (electric-field-) dominant region is centered at\n00:00\u201303:00 (12:00\u201315:00) MLT. This result is consistent\nwith previous statistical studies that found that the west-\nward electrojet centre was generally located post-midnight\n(Kamide, 1991). The post-midnight shift was explained by\nthe DP2 (DP1) current system contributing to the westward\nelectrojet at 00:00\u201306:00 MLT (21:00\u201303:00 MLT) so that\naveraging over all events shifts the westward electrojet\ncenter, and hence the conductivity-dominant region centre,\nfrom midnight to the early morning.\nIn Fig. 6a, a similar shift (towards later MLT) is also ob-\nserved in the current-velocity correlation which is substan-\ntial at 09:00\u201321:00 MLT. This overall rotation of the electric-\nfield-dominant region clockwise from the noon-midnight\nmeridian could be related to the properties of the plasma con-\nvection pattern as discussed below. The high-latitude plasma\nconvection pattern is known to depend strongly on the direc-\ntion and magnitude of the IMF By component (e.g. Heelis,\n1984). Statistically, Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (2005) and,\nmore recently, Haaland et al. (2007) demonstrated the lack\nof mirror-symmetry between the effects of positive and neg-\native IMF By . Similar results for several events during small\nBy conditions were also reported by Kustov et al. (1998).\nThe significant shift towards earlier MLT in location of the\n\u201cthroat\u201d region (where plasma flows into the polar cap) and\nthe resulting rotation in the convection cells only occurred for\npositive (negative) IMF By in the Northern (Southern) Hemi-\nsphere (Haaland et al., 2007). This implies that, on average,\nthe transition between the westward to eastward convection\nelectrojet occurs in the late morning sector. The results of\nthe current study are consistent with these findings, as in our\nobservations the transition from the conductance- to electric-\nfield-dominant region also occurred in the late morning, at\n09:00 MLT in Fig. 6a.\n4.2 Auroral absorption and electric field\nIn Figs. 2e and 2f absorption was compared with the ion\nvelocity over the entire dataset and a negligible correla-\ntion found. Although one expects no direct relationship\nbetween absorption (conductance) and plasma convection\nspeed (electric field), various indirect links have been pro-\nposed in the past including the electron heating mechanism\nin which absorption may exhibit an increase with the electric\nfield (see Sect. 1). No such increase was seen in Figs. 2e, 2f,\n5, 9. Thus these results indicate that no evidence of electron\nheating absorption is observed on a statistical basis in the au-\nroral zone. However, an interesting result was that in Fig. 8c\nsome anticorrelation was observed at 12:00\u201315:00 MLT and\nthat in Figs. 5 (09:00\u201315:00 MLT) and 9, an inverse propor-\ntionality was present.\nThe inverse proportionality between absorption and\nplasma velocity found in this study can be explained if a\nsimple model of the magnetospheric generator is used such\nas that proposed by Robinson (1984), based on the work\ndone by Reiff et al. (1981). In the magnetospheric gener-\nator model, the field-aligned currents are assumed to flow\nin large sheets that are connected in the ionosphere by Ped-\nersen currents. The field-aligned current integrated across\none sheet, J0, is fixed, but the magnetospheric convection\nand the electric field adjust themselves to ionospheric con-\nductance variations. Therefore the Pedersen currents, which\nclose the circuit in the ionosphere, are limited by J0, so that\n6PE=JP\u2264J0. The observed inverse proportionality rela-\ntionship between the conductance and electric field can thus\nbe attributed to this limit on the Pedersen current. If the cur-\nrent is limited then any further increase in the electric field\nmust be associated with a decrease in the Pedersen conduc-\ntance and vice versa. Later this limitation was described in\nterms of the magnetospheric current generator (or source) as\nopposed to the voltage generator in which the electric field\ndoes not change much regardless of conductance changes\n(Fujii and Iijima, 1987).\nThere are two potential problems with this interpretation\nthough. Firstly, the simple magnetospheric generator model\nsuggested by Robinson (1984) would not hold in perturbed\ncurrent systems such as that observed in the midnight sec-\ntor when precipitation is the main contributor to currents and\nDP1 systems are in action. Secondly, the magnetic pertur-\nbations are mostly representative of the Hall currents, while\nCNA correlates best with the Hall conductance (Senior et al.,\n2007). However, the time period 12:00\u201315:00 MLT is away\nfrom the midnight sector and provided that the Pedersen and\nHall currents varied more or less synchronously, the sim-\nple model of Robinson (1984) can be employed as a pos-\nsible explanation of our results. As mentioned, one can cer-\ntainly expect the two currents to vary synchronously during\nthe high correlation periods between the current and elec-\ntric field. The data collected in the 09:00\u201312:00 and 12:00\u2013\n15:00 MLT sectors in Fig. 5 for the entire dataset also showed\nsome evidence of inverse proportionality, which suggests that\nthe especially high correlation between electric fields and the\ncurrent may not be necessary. Rather, an electric field control\nduring the late morning and early afternoon in general, could\nbe indicative of the magnetospheric generator effect.\nPossible cases of electron heating absorption within the\ndataset were further investigated by considering the absorp-\ntion dependence on the EISCAT alternating code electron\ntemperature at 111 km above certain MLT-dependent thresh-\nold value, Fig. 10. Overall, there was no direct relationship\nfound between the two parameters either near the threshold\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 473\u2013486, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/473\/2009\/\nA. C. Kellerman et al.: Auroral absorption, currents and convection 485\nor well above it in any MLT sector. However, a possible in-\nverse proportionality relationship could be seen in the data,\nwhich was reminiscent of the relationship between the ab-\nsorption and the electric field.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nThe relationship between magnetic perturbations, absorp-\ntion, and ion drift velocity was studied, for the first time,\nusing a temporal correlation analysis technique for differ-\nent MLT sectors. This analysis method was augmented\nby an hourly correlation analysis for individual events\nwhich displayed a similar MLT variation of mean and me-\ndian hourly correlations. In addition, an extended per-\nturbation\/absorption dataset was considered with correla-\ntions showing a distinct seasonal dependence. This study\ndemonstrates the strong potential of riometers in studies of\nthe current-conductance-E-field relationship, particularly in\ncombination with magnetometers.\nThe current-electric-field correlation was generally higher\nthan the current-absorption correlation, which suggests that,\non average, the electric field is more dominant in the control\nof the current than conductance. The current-electric-field\ncorrelation was found to be higher on the dayside (09:00\u2013\n21:00 MLT). It was maximised in the 12:00\u201315:00 MLT sec-\ntor reaching 0.90, with a sharp increase across the 12:00 MLT\nborder. The current-absorption correlation was higher on the\nnightside (21:00\u201309;00 MLT) reaching its maximum of 0.76\nin the post-midnight sector (00:00\u201303:00 MLT). This sug-\ngests that the conductance is more dominant on the nightside.\nThe transition from an electric-field-dominant region to\na conductivity-dominant region in the pre-midnight sector\n(21:00 MLT) was associated in the past with a transition\nfrom eastward to westward electrojet currents. The results\nfrom the nightside showing predominantly conductivity-\ndriven current were generally consistent with previous sta-\ntistical studies, with some evidence of the opposite transition\nobserved in the late morning sector near 03:00 MLT, which\nwas previously observed only for individual events. An ex-\ntension of the conductivity-dominant region to 09:00 MLT\nwith a gradual decrease in the current-absorption correla-\ntion was also observed, which was explained as being in\npart due to energetic electrons drifting eastward around the\nEarth and gradually precipitating in the morning sector. The\nanalysis of the extended 4-year dataset discovered a dis-\ntinct seasonal dependence in the absorption-current rela-\ntionship. The region of high current-absorption correlation\nwas found to be at 21:00\u201306:00 MLT near the equinoxes,\nwhile in summer it was narrower and rotated towards dawn\n02:00\u201307:00 MLT. The significant asymmetry\/rotation of the\nelectric-field-dominant region with respect to the 00:00\u2013\n12:00 MLT meridian found in this study, may be related to\nthe lack of mirror symmetry between the effects of positive\nand negative IMF By on the plasma convection pattern.\nThere was no correlation found between absorption and\nelectric field for the entire dataset. Also, no significant cor-\nrelation was found for different MLT sectors, during peri-\nods of high correlation between electric fields and current, or\nfor drift velocities and electron temperatures above the two-\nstream instability threshold. Thus no substantial evidence of\nelectron heating absorption in the auroral zone was found.\nHowever, an inverse proportionality was found between the\nabsorption and electric field during the high current-E-field\ncorrelation periods and, generally, in the 09:00\u201315:00 MLT\nsector, which was attributed to a limit on the Pedersen cur-\nrent imposed by the magnetospheric generator during these\ntime intervals.\nAcknowledgements.
