The first decade, after the country\u2019s independence, was a \nperiod during which Regional Governments became involved directly in agricultural \nproduction in order to enhance the output of the private sector, peasant farmers and \nfishermen [1]. During this period, the main agricultural productions were mainly for \nexport crops, e.g. cocoa in the Western Region, groundnuts and cotton in the Northern \nRegion, as well as palm produce and rubber in the Eastern Region. Also national self-\nsufficiency in food production did not pose any problems worthy of public attention. \nHowever, after two decades of independence, despite the greater involvement of the \nGovernment, there was a rapid deterioration in the national and Rivers State\u2019s \nagricultural situation. Food shortages worsened as a result of the \u201cOil Boom\u201d which led \nto the migration of labour from the agricultural sector.  Before 1971, Rivers State \npractised both subsistence and cash-crop agriculture and relied solely on human beings as \nthe source of power. Among the major crops grown were rubber, oil palm, cassava, yam, \ncocoyam and pepper. However, their productivities were low, because, as Liljedahl et al \n[2] stated, human beings are limited to less than 0.1 kW continuous power output. To \novercome this limitation, the introduction of agricultural mechanization in the State \nstarted during the period of the first military administration (1967-1976) with the \nprocurement of the first batch of tractors and associated farm implements in 1971. The \nState established several farms and tractor-hiring programmes, as well as trained the \nrequisite manpower at the Agricultural Mechanization Training Centre in Oyo State in \n1971 to handle the machinery fleet. Thereafter, successive military and civilian \ngovernment administrations procured various tractors as the need arose.  \n \nIn Rivers State, the farm holdings are small, ranging from 0.25 to 5 ha. They are owned \nand operated by farmers and their households but often widely dispersed spatially [3, 4]. \nEach farmer and his household cultivated between 2 and 4 non-contiguous plots in a \nfarming season. During this period under review in Rivers State, the land-preparation \noperations, namely tillage and cultivation, break and stir up the soil in readiness for crop \nplanting [5] were predominantly manual operation actions using universally accepted \nimplements. \n \nAccording to Kepner et al [6], the increased production that has been achieved during the \npast century resulted from the growing of better crop varieties, the more effective use of \nfertilizers, improved cultural practices, and, more importantly, the increased utilization of \n(i) more appropriate non-human energy and (ii) employing functionally-appropriate  \nmachines and implements.  \n \nThus, the objective of this investigation was to collate information on the present \nacceptances of farm mechanization energy-utilization and TI in the Rivers State. This \n 3\nknowledge it is hoped will assist the government in encouraging Nigerian farmers to \nadopt the more profitable utilization of machine power.  \n \nTHE INFORMATION \n \n The main sources of evidence for this investigation were obtained from the State \nMinistry of Agriculture, through personal visits to the farms and discussions with record \nholders.  Field surveys were conducted in the 23 local-government areas of the State. \nFurther data were obtained from answers to a structured questionnaire concerning \nagricultural mechanization procedures; farm sizes, cultivation practices; use of tractors \nand implements; labour utilization and requirements; energy utilization; timeliness of \nagricultural operations, availability of credit facilities; farmers\u2019 social conditions, such as \neducation, knowledge of farm machines; availability of repair facilities; as well as make, \nmodel, number, capacity and year of purchase of each tractor. \n \nDATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING \n \nInformation collected for each of the 23 local-government areas, using both primary and \nsecondary sources, have been analysed. The primary data were obtained from the \nstructured questionnaire, personal contact and oral interviews. Some physical inspections \nwere also undertaken.  By a secondary method, relevant information was obtained from \nagricultural documents (such as bulletins), workshops and seminars. \n \nThe assessment of the degree of mechanization achieved was accomplished in two ways. \nThe first was the method whereby the current tractorization intensity (TI) in hp\/ha units \nin the State was computed using the definition proposed by Anazodo et al. [7], viz: \n    \nTI = \nC\nU\nA\nP                                            (1) \n \nThe second assessment was based on an energy analysis. Suitable energy equivalents for \nhuman and tractor powers were used to convert the man-hr and tractor-hr expenditures \ninto MJ of energy consumed [8] as kWh = 3.600 x 106J and 0.5hp\/ha = 0.373kW\/ha. \n \nFor the important crops grown in Rivers State, the energy utilized in the various \noperations namely land-clearing, ridging, mound making, planting, weeding and \nharvesting were analysed from the gathered information. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nAn appraisal of tractor acquisitions (1971\u21922004) revealed those that were available for \nfarming in Rivers State are shown in Table I: 17 different designs of tractors were used in \nthe State. Table 2 shows the percentage distribution of purchases according to models: a \ntotal of 10 different tractor makes were used. \n \n 4\nIn Table 3, tractor procurement, by the State government, has been grouped into three \ndecades, 1971\u21921980, 1981\u21921990, and 1991\u21922000 as the first, second and third \ndecades respectively because ten-year service life was expected of each tractor [9].  \nOverall, FIAT tractors were the most common in Rivers State, Nigeria.  \n \nThe appalling statistic revealed in Table 4, concerning actual tractor availability, could be \nattributed to the poor maintenance-programmes and repair facilities with respect to \nfarming Nigeria. \n \nTILLAGE AND CULTIVATION  \n \nTable 5, compares the field operation rates by farmers in Rivers State using either (i) \nhand-tools or (ii) machine power.  The total of mean manual and machine indicated field \nworks of 317.0 man-days\/ha and 1.04 machine-days\/ha, respectively, to achieve the same \ntask, are shown.  An analysis indicated that 32.6 man-days\/ha of manual labour were \nused for land preparation to achieve the same as 0.10 machine days\/ha when machine \npower was employed.  The ridging and cassava planting field work utilized 0.24 \nmachine-days\/ha or 43.8 man-days\/ha.  Mound making and yam planting used 57.8 man-\ndays\/ha or 0.18 machine-days\/ha to achieve the same end. The field work which \ninvolved, first, general weeding used 40.0 man-days\/ha or 0.14 machine\u2013days\/ha. After \nwhich root weeding consumed 36.7 man-days\/ha or 0.12 machine-days\/ha. Manual field \nwork is time-consuming and requires a large amount of human labour. This situation \nwidespread amongst Rivers State farmers, who were predominantly hand-tool farmers.  \n \n \nENERGY UTILIZATION IN HUMAN AND MACHINE POWERED \nAGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES \n \nMost traditional technologies practised in Rivers State are highly ineffective.  From Table \n5, it is clear that for the same cassava production per hectare, a total of 1468 MJ and 18 \nMJ of energy was expended for manual and machine power, respectively.  The \nproduction of yam per hectare utilized a total of about 1524 MJ and 18 MJ for manual \nand machine power, respectively. This makes an overwhelming case for the use of \ntractors, in these agricultural operations. \n \nFigures 1 and 2, showed that overall manual labour energy utilization for the same end-\nproduct was approximately 83 times the energy required when using the tractor.  Energy \nutilization for tillage and cultivation operations in regards to land preparation, weeding \nand harvesting was far greater when supplied by manual labour rather than by machine. \n \nStout et al [10], reported specific human energy consumption for bush clearing as \n1680MJ, and 19.4 man-days were required to prepare a hectare of land, whereas for the \nsame task, the machine required as 0.88MJ energy utilization and 0.019 machine-days \nper hectare. \n \n 5\nEnergy utilization for manual weeding was 1320MJ and 2.29 MJ for machine field \noperation: 32.6 man-day\/ha and 0.015 MJ machine effort were reported [10].  Energy-\nrelated data from a number of tropical cultivation systems and products for which cassava \nwas one of them have been averaged by Leach [11] as 0.749 MJ for manual labour and \n0.0487MJ when using machine power.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \n \nFarmers in the Rivers State employed only a low level of mechanization. The resulting \nlow productivities were due to: poverty; ignorance; lack of incentive to use of machinery \nin agricultural practices; and traditional tools being cheap, simple and readily available to \nthe poor farmer.  However, the latter was very time consuming. The total energy \nutilizations for the manual and machine operations per hectare for achieving the same \noutcome were 2738.9MJ and 33.5MJ.  The human energy utilization was so much for \nmanual methods that farmers are reduced to subsistence levels. The cultivations of yam \nand cassava crops require more energy expenditure per hectare of land for manual than \nmechanical operations in Nigeria.  \n \nTractorization intensity (T.I) decreased from 0.352hp\/ha in 1986 to 0.345hp\/ha in 2004 \nbecause agricultural activities in Rivers State were in decline.  The 0.345hp\/ha tractor-\npower utilization remained far below the 0.5hp\/ha, as recommended for effective \nagriculture operations [12].  Hence the much needed food self-sufficiency has continued \nto elude the State. A similar conclusion applies for the entire country. Planting and \nharvesting of all the major crops need to be mechanized and more land used for \nagriculture. \n \nA concerted effort towards achieving standardization of the components for tractors \nsuited for the peculiar agro-physical and climatic conditions is needed in Nigeria, as this \nwould ensure that tractors are more likely to function well throughout their service lives.  \n \nGovernment encouragement and incentives for farmers to use farm machinery is a \ndesirable challenge.  \n \n \nTABLE 1: TRACTORS PURCHASED BY THE RIVERS STATE GOVERNMENT \n(1971 \u2192 2004) \n \nYEAR TRACTOR \nMANUFACTURER \nMODEL POWER \n(kW) \nQUANTITY TOTAL NUMBER \nOF TRACTORS \nPURCHASED IN \nTHE SPECIFIED \nYEAR \n1971 MASSEY FERGUSON \nMASSEY FERGUSON \nFORD \n135 \n165 \n5000(D) \n48 \n60 \n48 \n20 \n3 \n2 \n25 \n1972 MASSEY FERGUSON 165 60 8 8 \n1976 JOHN DEERE \nDAVID BROWN \n- \n1990 \n60 \n53 \n12 \n7 \n19 \n 6\n1977 DAVID BROWN 1990 60 3 3 \n1978 FIAT \nFIAT \n80 (DT) \n640 (DT) \n- \n82 \n10 \n15 \n25 \n1984 STEYR \nSTEYR \n8120A \n8080A \n80 \n52 \n3 \n10 \n13 \n1985 STEYR \nSTEYR \nFIAT 666 \n768 \n52 \n52 \n5 \n15 \n20 \n1986 STEYR \nSTEYR \nSTEYR \nMARSHAL \/ LEYLAND \nMARSHAL \/ LEYLAND \nMARSHAL \/ LEYLAND \n768 \n8130 \n8075 \n- \n- \n- \n97 \n52 \n52 \n52 \n52 \n60 \n5 \n9 \n9 \n7 \n3 \n8 \n41 \n1989 STEYR 8075 52 50 50 \n1990 BELORUS - 60 50 50 \n1992 ZETOR 7745 60 21 21 \n1996 FIAT 8066 (DT) 60 20 20 \n1997 FIAT \nFIAT \n8066 \n70.56 \n52 \n52 \n14 \n10 \n24 \n2001 FIAT \n \n70.56 52 3 3 \n2002 NEW HOLLAND 70.56 52 10 10 \n2003 - - - - - \n2004 - - - - - \nTOTAL 332 \n \n \n \nTABLE 2: NUMBER OF TRACTORS (ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURER) \nPURCHASED BY RIVERS RIVERS STATE GOVERNMENT IN THE PERIOD \n1971\u21922004 \n \nTRACTOR  MANUFACTURER NUMBER  % OF TOTAL \nMASSEY FERGUSON  31 9.32 \nFORD 2 0.60 \nJOHN DEERE 2 3.61 \nDAVID BROWN 10 3.10 \nFIAT 77 23.18 \nSTEYR 101 30.40 \nMARSHALL \/ LEYLAND  18 5.41 \nBELORUS  50 15.05 \nZETOR  21 6.32 \nFIAT \/ NEW HOLLAND  10 3.01 \nTOTAL 332 100 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7\nTABLE 3: TRACTORS PURCHASED BY THE RIVERS STATE GOVERNMENT \nWITHIN SPECIFIED PERIODS \n \nYEARS TRACTOR MAKE NUMBER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL \nNUMBER PURCHASED \nWITHIN THE DECADE \n(%) \n1971 \u2192 1980 \n \nMASSEY FERGUSON \nFORD \nJOHN DEERE \nDAVID BROWN \nFIAT \n31 \n2 \n12 \n10 \n25 \n38.75 \n2.50 \n15.00 \n31.25 \n12.50 \nSUB TOTAL FOR THE 1ST DECADE 80 100 \n1981 \u2192 1990 \n \n \nSTEYR \nMARSHAL \/ LEYLAND \nFIAT \nBELORUS \n101 \n18 \n5 \n50 \n58.05 \n10.34 \n2.87 \n28.74 \nSUB TOTAL FOR THE 2ND DECADE 174 100 \n1991 \u21922000 \n \nZETOR \nFIAT \n21 \n44 \n32.30 \n67.70 \nSUB TOTAL FOR THE 3RD DECADE 65 100 \n2001 \u2192 2004 FIAT \nNEW HOLLAND \n \n3 \n10 \n23.08 \n76.92 \nSUB TOTAL FOR YEARS 2001 - 2004 13 100 \nGRAND TOTAL 332  \n \nTABLE 4: SOME FARMS IN RIVERS STATE AND THEIR LEVELS OF \nINVOLVEMENT IN MECHANIZATION \n \nName of Farm \n \nType of  \nmanagement \nsystem \nSize of farm \n(Hectares)  \nNumber \nof \ntractors \navailable  \nStaff \nStrength  \n \nNumber of \nTractors  \nin \noperational \ncondition  \nNumber of \nTractors in \nday-to-day \nuse \nSchool-to-land Authority Farm, \nIriebe, Obio\/Akpor L.G.A.  \n \nSGOMS \n \n150 \n \n6 \n \n>25 \n \n4 \n \n1 \nAgricultural Development \nProgramme Farm, Okoro-Odo, \nObio\/Akpor L.G.A.  \n \n \nSGOMS \n \n \n100 \n \n \n4 \n \n \n>25 \n \n \n2 \n \n \n1 \nNigeria Prosins Farm, Eleme, \nIkwerre L.G.A.   \nFGOMS 80 4 >25 1 1 \nZuru Farm, Rumuigbo,  \nOdo, Obio\/Akpor L.G.A. \n \nIOMS \n \n20 \n \n- \n \n<10 \n \n- \n \n- \nJoel Nwala Farm, Omuma, \nOmuma L.G.A. \n \nIOMS \n \n30 \n \n- \n \n<10 \n \n- \n \n- \nChief N.
