We used a multiple-choice task \nand manipulated whether the idioms were transparent or opaque, familiar or novel, and \npresented with or without a supportive story context.

The results broadly support the \nGlobal Elaboration Model of figurative competence (Levorato & Cacciari, 1995) with a \nnotable exception: even the youngest children were able to use semantic analysis to derive \nthe meanings of transparent idioms, as well as being sensitive to meaning in context. The \nfindings show that young children process language at both the small-grained phrasal-level as \nwell as the discourse-level to establish figurative meaning and demonstrate that the language \nprocessing skills that aid idiom comprehension, as well as idiom knowledge itself, are still \nnot fully developed in 11- to 12-year-olds. \n \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n3 \nThe development of idiom comprehension: an investigation of semantic and contextual \nprocessing skills \n \nAn idiom is a form of figurative language that can (usually) have both a literal and a \nfigurative meaning, depending on the context. For example, the sentence \u2018Chris spilled the \nbeans\u2019 might refer to someone tipping out the contents of a jar of beans (literal) or revealing a \nsecret (figurative). Comprehension of figurative language, such as idioms, can cause particular \ndifficulties for young children (Gibbs, 1987; Gibbs, 1991) and children with language \ndifficulties (Kerbel, 1998; Kerbel & Grunwell, 1998). The current research investigated the \ncontribution of two language processing skills to young children\u2019s understanding and \nacquisition of the meanings of idiomatic phrases: semantic analysis and inference from context. \nOur aim was to determine how these different language processes contribute to developmental \ndifferences in idiom comprehension. A unique feature of this work is our use of novel idioms. \nPrevious research has always used idioms that occur in the speakers\u2019 language, for which \nparticipants may have full or partial knowledge. Our use of novel idioms enabled us to assess \nidiom processing without the confound of prior knowledge, which may obviously be related to \nage.  \nSemantic analysis of an idiomatic phrase involves retrieving alternate meanings of \nkey words and computing a non-literal meaning of the phrase. Transparent idioms (also \nreferred to as decomposable or semantically analysable) have a clear overlap between the \nliteral and figurative meanings of the phrase. For example the term \u2018to speak your mind\u2019 can \nbe analysed to derive its meaning: \u2018to express your feelings or opinions frankly\u2019. Some \nidioms cannot be broken down word by word. These idioms are typically referred to as \nopaque idioms (also non-decomposable or semantically non-analysable). Their meanings \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n4 \ncannot be derived successfully by semantic analysis. For example, it is not possible to \ndetermine that \u2018to bite the dust\u2019 means \u2018to cease to exist\u2019 by analysing the component words \nin the phrase. \nNippold highlights the importance of semantic analysis in her metasemantic \nhypothesis of figurative language comprehension (Nippold, 1998; Nippold & Taylor, 1995). \nAccording to this hypothesis, the ability to analyse the internal semantics of the phrase aids \nidiom comprehension. Semantic analysis is thought to be particularly useful for \ncomprehending transparent idioms, because the literal meaning of a phrase may help to cue \nits figurative meaning (Caillies & Le Sourn-Bissaoui, 2006; Nippold & Duthie, 2003). Adults \nand adolescents are sensitive to differences in transparency and can reliably rate the \ncontribution of key words to the meanings of idiomatic expressions  (Titone & Connine, \n1999). Further, skilled language comprehenders perform some semantic analysis of the \nphrase when reading an idiom (Titone & Connine, 1994, 1999).  \nThere are conflicting findings about the age at which semantic analysis can be used \nby children to process an idiom\u2019s meaning. Several studies indicate that this is an early \ndeveloping skill. For example, Gibbs (1987, 1991) found that 5-year-olds were better at \nexplaining transparent idioms than opaque ones, although performance was fairly poor. Other \nwork suggests that semantic processing may develop later. For example, Nippold and \nRudzinski (1993) found a positive correlation between transparency and performance on an \nidiom explanation task for 14 and 17-year-olds, but not for 11-year-olds. Similar findings \nwere obtained by Nippold and Taylor (2002).  \nThe choice of tasks used to measure idiom comprehension may influence the \nlikelihood of detecting effects of transparency (Levorato & Cacciari, 1999). Younger children \nmay be disadvantaged on explanation tasks, because their expressive language skills and \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n5 \ncomprehension skills will be lower than those of older children. Using a multiple-choice task, \nLevorato and Cacciari (1999) found that 9-year-olds could take advantage of the transparency \nof an idiom to understand its meaning out of context, but 7-year-olds could not. Gibbs (1991) \nfound a similar difference between third graders (mean age 8:9) and first graders (mean age \n6:10). Levorato and Cacciari (1999) suggest that although semantic analysis can influence \nidiom comprehension from an early age, the importance and use of this processing skill \nincrease as children get older. Together with the findings of  Nippold and colleagues \n(Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993; Nippold & Taylor, 2002), this body of work suggests that \nsemantic analysis may enjoy an extended period of development. \nThe other language process used to derive the meanings of unfamiliar or unknown \nidioms that we consider in this paper is inference from context. The use of context for \nlanguage comprehension is evident from an early age. Physical, sentential and discourse \nenvironments constrain the possible referents of a new word for young children (Akhtar, \n2006). When reading, the text provides the context from which the comprehender can \nconstruct meaning (Garton & Pratt, 1998). Attention to the textual context might develop \nalongside reading. It enables the reader to work out the appropriate meanings of ambiguous \nwords, such as \u2018bank\u2019 and the correct pronunciations of homographs, such as \u2018bow\u2019. \nSimilarly, if the meaning of an idiom is not known, clues from the surrounding text or \ndiscourse may be used by the learner to infer an appropriate meaning. \nInference from context may be particularly useful for understanding opaque idioms, \nthe meaning of which is not cued by the words in the phrase. The use of inference from \ncontext is highlighted in an influential comprehensive model of the development of figurative \ncompetence, Cacciari and Levorato\u2019s Global Elaboration Model (GEM: e.g.,  Levorato & \nCacciari, 1992, 1999). The essence of this model is that comprehension of idioms (and other \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n6 \nforms of figurative language) is dependent on the same skills and strategies that underpin \nreading and listening comprehension, more generally. As children move from processing \nlanguage on a piecemeal or local basis to strive for coherence within and across sequences of \ntext, their developing inferential skills enable them to derive the meanings of idioms from the \npresentation context. In general, children and adolescents find idioms easier to interpret when \npresented in a supportive narrative context than when they are presented with no context \n(e.g., Gibbs, 1987; Levorato & Cacciari, 1992; Nippold & Martin, 1989). The facilitatory \neffect of context is apparent at a young age: even 5-year-olds are better able to explain the \nmeanings of idioms when presented in context (Gibbs, 1991).  \nLevorato and Cacciari (1995) propose that that the development of the skills and \nabilities used to process and acquire figurative language takes place between 7 and 11 years \nof age. To understand the relative importance of semantic analysis and inference from \ncontext at different stages in the development of figurative competence we need to consider \nstudies that manipulate both the transparency of the idiom and the presentation context in this \nage range. In Gibb\u2019s (1991) study, children between 5 and 9 years found it easier to explain \nthe meanings of normally decomposable (transparent) idioms than nondecomposable idioms \n(opaque) both in and out of context. All age groups benefited from the presence of context \nbut only 8- and -9-year-olds were able to use semantic analysis to aid comprehension of \n(transparent) idioms out of context with a significant degree of success: 37% correct for 8-\nyear-olds and 42% correct for 9-year-olds. Levorato and Cacciari (1999) report a similar \npattern of data using a multiple-choice task: 9-year-olds demonstrated higher levels of \ncomprehension for semantically analysable (transparent) idioms out of context than did 7-\nyear-olds. The younger children showed greater contextual gains in their comprehension of \nsemantically analysable idioms relative to opaque ones.  \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n7 \nAt first glance, these findings might appear contradictory because context should be \nparticularly important for opaque idioms, which are not amenable to semantic analysis. \nHowever, these findings are not contradictory if we consider examples of real-world \nlanguage processing such as conversations or reading: these situations involve processing \nlanguage in context and it is unlikely that both semantic analysis and inference from context \nwill operate entirely separately. Specifically in relation to idioms, it is possible that context \nacts as an additional check when deriving the meaning of transparent idioms: any meaning \nderived from analysis of the phrase can be checked and refined in relation to the meaning \nsuggested by the supporting context (e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1999). This explanation fits \nwith a broad definition of metasemantics as a higher-order semantic skill that includes \nawareness of the relations between words and their pragmatic context (Roth, Speece, Cooper, \n& de la Paz, 1996).  \nIn summary, semantic analysis and inference from context both support idiom \ncomprehension. The pattern of data from previous research broadly supports the proposal that \ninference from context develops early and semantic analysis develops later: children aged 7 \nyears and under benefit from transparency only when idioms are presented in context, whereas \n9-year-old children benefit from transparency when idioms are presented out of context as well. \nHowever, there are contradictory findings from studies of different age groups and tasks. As \nnoted by Levorato and Cacciari (1999) there is clearly a need for more work investigating the \nrole of semantic analysis skills during the period in which figurative language comprehension \nemerges.  \nWe report two experiments that compared 7- to 8-year-olds and 9- to 10-year-olds\u2019 \nability to interpret idiomatic expressions in relation to the semantic analysability of the idiom \n(transparent versus opaque) and the presence of context (absent versus present). Levorato and \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n8 \nCacciari (1995) have suggested that figurative competence develops between 7-11 years. We \nchose our two age groups to cover the age range studied in much of Levorato and Cacciari\u2019s \nwork and to represent key ages in the development of figurative competence (Cacciari & \nLevorato, 1989; Levorato & Cacciari, 1992, 1995, 1999). In order to determine the relative \nimportance of semantic analysis and inference from context in the acquisition of idiomatic \nmeaning we included novel idioms, which were translations of real European idioms, for which \nthere is no equivalent in British English (see Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2005). Previous \nresearch on the development of idiom comprehension has used idioms that occur in the \nspeakers\u2019 language. These studies cannot therefore rule out the possibility that developmental \ndifferences were influenced, in part, by older children\u2019s greater knowledge and exposure to \nthese expressions. Our use of novel idioms enabled us to investigate the contributions of \nsemantic analysis and inference from context withouth the confound of prior knowledge.  \nOur work extends previous research on the development of idiom comprehension by \naddressing four specific questions. First, are both age groups able to use contextual information \nto support idiom comprehension for expressions that are not familiar? Second, is semantic \nanalysis of idiomatic expressions an early or later emerging processing skill? Third, are \nsemantic analysis skills specifically related to the understanding of figurative language that is \namenable to phrase-level analysis? Fourth, is there evidence for an extended period of \ndevelopment of idiom processing skills?  \nThe first question was addressed by comparing the effects of context for the same \nchildren for the same idioms. Many investigations into the influence of context on idiom \ncomprehension have used a between-subjects design (Levorato & Cacciari, 1999) or different \nitems in different conditions (Nippold & Martin, 1989). By manipulating these variables within \nsubjects, we were able to calculate the facilitatory influence of context for the same children for \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n9 \nthe same idioms. The second question was investigated by comparing performance for the two \nage groups on the transparent novel idioms when the context is absent, for which knowledge \nand context could not influence performance. Clearly, when these expressions are presented in \ncontext there is the likelihood of an additional influence of the interaction between semantic \nanalysis and context, because these two sources of information provide clues to the idiom\u2019s \nmeaning. The third question was addressed by looking at the relation between performance on \nan independent measure of semantic analysis skills and performance on the different types of \nidiom (Experiment One). This task required children to produce (at least) two different \nmeanings for sentences with ambiguous words and grammatical structures and involves many \nof the same skills needed to interpret an idiomatic expression. To date, there are no published \nstudies comparing idiom comprehension to performance on an independent measure of \nsemantic analysis. We sought to determine whether semantic analysis was critically important \nin the processing of transparent idioms by relating to performance to novel transparent and \nnovel opaque idioms, separately. The fourth question was addressed by comparing the two \ngroups\u2019 comprehension of novel idioms with that of more skilled language users: adults \n(Experiment One) and 11- to 12-year-olds (Experiment Two). The use of novel idioms enables \nus to determine how any age differences are related to language skills rather than knowledge of \nspecific idioms. \nExperiment One \nThe aim of Experiment One was to investigate whether younger and older children \ndiffer in their use of semantic analysis and inference from context to understand idioms. To \ndo this, we manipulated the transparency of the idiom (transparent versus opaque) and the \npresence of context (absent versus present) and familiarity (familiar1 versus novel). To \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n10 \nfurther explore the contribution of semantic analysis skills, an independent measure of \nsemantic analysis of phrases was taken.  \nIdiom comprehension was assessed with a multiple-choice task. An alternative \nassessment in which children explain the meaning of each idiom would provide an insight \ninto the source of information used to interpret the idiom, by allowing analysis of correct and \nincorrect responses. However, explanation is a difficult task for young children who may \ndiffer from older children in their expressive language skills as well as their comprehension \nlevel (Spooner, Gathercole, & Baddeley, 2006). Multiple-choice tasks have been used \nsuccessfully to assess idiom comprehension (e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1995) and have been \nshown to be sensitive to the effects of transparency and context in children and adolescents \n(e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1999; Nippold & Taylor, 1995). This method has fewer language \nproduction demands than an explanation task and is likely to be a more sensitive measure for \ncomparing idiom comprehension in different age groups. \nBased on previous research we expected that, in general, older children would \nperform better than the younger children, transparent idioms would be easier to interpret than \nopaque idioms, and the presence of context would facilitate idiom comprehension. The \nfollowing outcomes relate to the four specific research questions. Children who are able to \nuse inference from context should show a contextual facilitation effect: comprehension of \nfamiliar and novel idioms should improve with the presence of context. Children who are \nable to use semantic analysis should perform above chance in the comprehension of both \nfamiliar and novel transparent idioms. Performance on the independent assessment of \nsemantic analysis (the ambiguous sentence task) should relate specifically to the \ncomprehension of transparent idioms when no context is provided. If idiom processing skills \nhave an extended period of development (as suggest by the work of Nippold and colleagues) \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n11 \nage differences between adults and children should be apparent in an analysis of performance \non novel idioms.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nForty children (23 girls, 17 boys) participated in this study. Twenty children were in \nYear 3 and aged 7-8 years (M = 7 years, 10 months; range: 7 years, 5 months \u2013 8 years, 5 \nmonths) and 20 were in Year 5 and aged 9-10 years (M = 9 years, 11 months; range 9 years 5 \nmonths \u2013 10 years, 0 months2). They attended two village schools in the north-west of \nEngland, serving mixed catchment areas. Children with a statement of special educational \nneeds were excluded from the study. All of the children spoke British English as their first \nlanguage and had parental permission to participate in this work. Twenty-five undergraduate \nstudents from Lancaster University completed the two idiom tasks. They all received course \ncredit for their participation. The data from six adults who did not speak British English as \ntheir first language were excluded from the analysis. The data from nineteen (12 females, 7 \nmales) are reported, the mean age of the adult sample was 19.4 years.  \nMaterials: construction and evaluation \nTwenty four idioms were used in this study: twelve were common British English \nidioms and twelve were translations of European idioms with no British equivalent and, \ntherefore, considered novel. There were six transparent and six opaque idioms for each set, \nwhich had been piloted and used in previous research. Full details of the selection of these \nidioms and ratings for their transparency can be found in Cain et al. (2005; see also Cain & \nTowse, in press). This previous research demonstrated that the novel opaque idioms could not \nbe interpreted without the context present. A full set of idioms is provided in Appendix One.  \nExperimental tasks and procedure \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n12 \nChildren\u2019s understanding of idioms was assessed using a multiple-choice task, in \nwhich they had to choose one from four interpretations of the idiom: a target idiomatic \ninterpretation of the phrase (idiomatic); a non-literal interpretation that was plausible within \nthe story context (contextually plausible); a non-literal interpretation that was not plausible \nwithin the story context (contextually implausible); and an interpretation that provided a \nliteral interpretation of (part of) the phrase (literal). Examples are provided in Table 1. Pilot \nwork with adults (N=34) established that, in context, the idiomatic interpretation was the \nmost common selection.  \n  \nTABLE 1 AROUND HERE \n \nIdioms: context absent. The younger age group were tested individually; the older \nchildren in groups of 4-5. Testing was conducted in a quiet room away from the classroom \nwith the children sitting apart from each other. The instructions for the task were printed on \nthe front cover of the test booklet and read out to the child: \u201cIn this booklet there are a \nnumber of short expressions or sayings, for example \u2018it\u2019s raining cats and dogs\u2019. After each \nsaying there are four possible meanings. Your job is to choose the right one.\u201d  An example \nwith four multiple-choice options followed, and this was completed by each child in his\/her \nbooklet with help from the experimenter and feedback as necessary. An example is provided \nin Table 1. Children were then told: \u201cDon't worry if you haven't heard some of these sayings \nbefore, a few of them have been made up. If you\u2019re not sure which one is the right answer, \njust choose the one that you think it might be.\u201d The children then worked through the \nbooklet, the experimenter read out each item and the four multiple-choice options for the \nyounger children. Adults were tested in small groups and completed the task independently: \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n13 \nfull instructions were printed on the cover of the response booklet and the examiner was \navailable to answer any queries.  \n Idioms: context present. The context present condition was administered a minimum \nof two weeks after the context absent condition, to minimise the effects of memory for the \nitems. The younger age group were tested individually; the older children in groups of 4-5 in \na quiet room away from the classroom with the children sitting apart from each other. The \nsame twenty-four idioms were used. Each was embedded in a supportive story. An example \nis provided in Table 1. The instructions were adapted to note the story context.  \nThe items were presented in the same order for each participant, distributed so that the \nsame type of idiom (familiar-transparent, familiar-opaque, novel-transparent, novel-opaque) \ndid not appear consecutively. A different order was used for the two presentation conditions: \ncontext absent vs present, ensuring that each alternative occurred in the same position (1-4) \nan equal number of times. The total number of each response option selected was calculated \n(maximum = 6, for each condition). Adults completed the task, as above.  \nSemantic analysis skills. Only children completed this task. They were tested \nindividually in a quiet room. The Ambiguous Sentences subtest from The Test of Language \nCompetence, Expanded Edition (TLC-Expanded: Wiig & Secord, 1989) was adapted. A total \nof 11 items were selected from Level 1 on the basis that they were common in British \nEnglish. Each item comprised a short phrase that could have multiple interpretations, such as \n\u201cIt is off the hook\u201d which could refer to a fish or a phone off the hook. The phrases were \npresented visually and read out by the experimenter. The child was asked \u201cCan you tell me \ntwo different things that this sentence could mean?\u201d and then required to select two out of \nfour pictures that matched different meanings of the phrase. For the example given, one \npicture showed a phone off the hook and one a fish off a hook. The other two pictures \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n14 \nshowed a kite stuck in a tree and a hammer on a shelf. A further eight items from Level 2 \nwere completed. These items comprised the phrase only. The selected items were common \nBritish English words. Items including key words that had been tested in the first 11 items \nwere excluded. The task for these items was to provide an interpretation of two meanings for \neach phrase. The items were scored according to the points system specified in the manual. \nFor all items 0 points were awarded for no correct interpretations, 1 point for one correct \ninterpretation and 3 points for two correct interpretations. For eleven items with pictures, 0 \npoints were awarded for one or no correct picture responses were made and one point where \nboth of the correct pictures were selected.  \nResults \nThe mean sum scores obtained for correct idiomatic choices made when context was \nabsent vs present are shown in Table 2. The distribution of each condition was checked and \nfound to be within acceptable limits. Four sets of analyses were carried out to determine the \nrelations between age, use of context, semantic analysis skills, and idiom comprehension. \nThe first set used one-sample t-tests to compare responding on the idiom comprehension task \nto chance. The second set used ANOVAs to determine whether the magnitude of correct \nresponding differed across ages and in relation to the presence of a supportive story context. \nA third set of analyses investigated the source of errors made on the idiom comprehension \ntask. The final fourth set investigated the relations between correct responding on the idiom \ncomprehension task and semantic analysis skills.  \n1. Idiom Responses: Comparisons with Chance Level of Responding \nIdiom choices: context absent. A series of one-sample t tests for each age group was \nconducted to determine the likelihood that each group was able to select the correct response \nby chance. The chance level of selecting the idiomatic response for each condition was 1.5 (6 \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n15 \ntrials with 4 options each). Because of the number of comparisons to be made (12), the alpha \nlevel was set at .004.  \nFor the adult participants, the scores obtained for familiar transparent, familiar \nopaque, and novel transparent idioms were significantly greater than 1.5 indicating either \nknowledge of the idiom or an ability to derive the meaning of the expression: familiar \ntransparent, t(18) = 38.19; familiar opaque, t(18) = 13.49; novel transparent, t(18) = 38.19 (all \nat p < .004). Scores for the correct interpretation of the novel opaque idioms did not differ \nsignificantly from chance, t(18) = 2.01, p > .05. The two younger age groups showed \nmarkedly different patterns of performance. The older children responded above chance level \non both types of transparent idiom: familiar, t(19) = 6.68, p < .004 and novel, t(19) = 6.94, p \n< .001. Their performance on both types of opaque idiom did not differ from chance, both ts \n< 1.0. In contrast, the younger children did not select the idiomatic response significantly \nmore often than chance for either type of transparent idiom nor for the novel opaque idioms, \nall ts < 2.1. Their performance on the opaque idioms indicated no knowledge for the familiar \nopaque idioms, for which they selected the idiomatic choice less frequently than chance, t(19) \n= 3.90, p = .001.  \nTABLE 2 AROUND HERE \n \nIdiom choices: context present. The mean sum scores obtained for correct idiomatic \nchoices are shown in Table 2. All age groups selected a greater number of idiomatic \nresponses when the context was present vs absent, indicating that context facilitated \nperformance. A series of one-sample t tests for each age group showed that the adults and \nolder children all scored significantly above chance (ps < .004). For the younger children, \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n16 \nperformance on the transparent idioms was significantly better than chance (ps < .004), but \nthe scores obtained for the opaque idioms did not reach our corrected level of significance.  \n2. Idiom Responses: Effects of Age and Context \n Main analysis. The total number of idiomatic choices made when context was absent vs \npresent for each type of idiom were treated as the dependent variables in a four-way analysis \nof variance. The adult participants performed near ceiling for familiar and transparent \nexpressions and, for that reason, their data are not included in the main analysis. The \nANOVA had the following factors: age (young, old) was a between-subjects factor, context \n(absent, present), familiarity (familiar, novel) and transparency (transparent, opaque) were \nwithin-subjects factors. Where appropriate, partial eta squared (\u03b7p2) is reported as the \nmeasure of effect size. This is an estimate of the proportion of total variance accounted for by \nthe independent variable.  \nThere were significant and sizeable main effects of age, F(1,38) = 41.31, p < .001, \u03b7p2  \n= .52, context, F(1,38) = 58.65, p < .001, \u03b7p2  = .61, and transparency, F(1,38) = 33.52, p < \n.001, \u03b7p2  = .47, and a small effect of familiarity, F(1,38) = 3.83, p < .05, \u03b7p2  = .10. There \nwere significant two-way interactions between age and transparency, F(1,38) = 5.32, p < .03, \n\u03b7p\n2 = .12, and context and transparency, F(1,38) = 8.21, p < .01, \u03b7p2 = .18, which were \nqualified by a significant three-way interaction between context, transparency, and age, \nF(1,38) = 8.92, p < .01, \u03b7p2 = .19. The interaction is depicted in Figure 1 and was explored by \nanalysing the performance of the two age groups separately (as recommended by Roberts & \nRusso, 1999).  \n \nFIGURE 1 AROUND HERE  \n \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n17 \nFor the younger age group, there were main effects of context, F(1,19) = 34.83, p < \n.001, \u03b7p2  = .65, and transparency, F(1,19) = 6.42, p < .05, \u03b7p2  = .25, but the interaction was \nnot significant, F< 1.0. As is clear from Figure 1, younger children\u2019s performance on both \ntypes of idiom was boosted by context. For the older age group, there were also main effects \nof context F(1,19) = 24.75, p < .001, \u03b7p2  = .57, and transparency, F(1,19) = 31.06, p < .001, \n\u03b7p\n2  = .60, which were qualified by a significant interaction, F(1,19) = 17.54, p < .001, \u03b7p2  = \n.48. The simple main effects demonstrated a significant effect of context for opaque idioms, \nwith higher scores when context was present vs absent, F(1, 19) = 37.23, p < .001, but no \neffect of context for transparent idioms, F(1, 19) = 2.21, p = .15. Further, there was a \nsignificant effect of idiom type for context absent, with higher scores obtained for transparent \nthan opaque idioms, F(1, 19) = 62.21, p < .001,  but the comparison did not reach \nsignificance for context present, F(1, 19) = 3.21, p = .09.   \n Analysis of novel idioms. An analysis of all age groups\u2019 performance on the novel \nitems only was conducted to determine the relative importance of inference from context and \nsemantic analysis in the acquisition of idiomatic meaning. The adults\u2019 data were included in \nthis analysis because they did not perform at ceiling for novel idioms.  \nThere were significant and substantial main effects of age, F(2,56) = 118.58, p < .001, \n\u03b7p\n2 = .81, transparency, F(1,56) = 89.47, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .62, and context, F(1,56) = 96.11, p < \n.001, \u03b7p2 = .63. Each of the two-way interactions was significant: context and age, F(2,56) = \n3.77, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .12; transparency and age, F(2,56) = 16.58, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .37; context \nand transparency, F(1,56) = 43.61, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .44. These were qualified by a three-way \ninteraction between age, context, and transparency: F(2,56) = 12.53, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .31. The \nmean values are reported in the final 4 columns of Table 2 and shown in Figure 2.  \n \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n18 \nFIGURE 2 AROUND HERE  \n \nTo explore the interaction, the performance of each age group was analysed \nseparately. For the adults and the older children, there were main effects of transparency and \ncontext, qualified by a significant two-way interaction: adults F(1,18) = 81.56, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = \n.82; older children, F(1,19) = 4.42, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .19. Looking at the simple main effects for \nthe adult data, there was a significant effect of context for opaque idioms, with higher scores \nwhen context was present vs absent, F(1, 18) = 308.17, p < .001, but no effect of context for \ntransparent idioms, F(1, 18) < 1.0. Further, there was a significant effect of idiom type for \ncontext absent, with higher scores obtained for transparent than opaque idioms, F(1, 18) = \n170.14, p < .001,  but not for context present, F(1, 18) < 1.0. For the 9 to 10-year-olds, simple \nmain effects revealed the same pattern of findings. There was a significant effect of context \nfor opaque idioms with higher scores when context was present vs absent, F(1, 19) = 37.23, p \n< .001, but no effect of context for transparent idioms, F(1, 19) =2.21, p > .15. Further, there \nwas a significant effect of idiom type for context absent, with higher scores obtained for \ntransparent than opaque idioms, F(1, 19) = 62.21, p < .001,  but not for context present, F(1, \n18) =3.21, p =.09. For the younger children, only the main effect of context reached \nsignificance, F(1,19) = 20.23, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .52.    \n3. Idiom Task: Analysis of Errors \nThree types of error were possible: selection of the contextually plausible, \ncontextually implausible, or the literal interpretation of the phrase. Only the children made a \nsignificant number of errors both when context was absent and present: the adults performed \nnear ceiling on all types with the exception of the novel opaque idioms presented with \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n19 \ncontext absent. The mean total numbers obtained for each choice, for the two younger age \ngroups, are shown in Table 3.  \n \nTABLE 3 AROUND HERE \n \nIdioms: context absent. To determine whether the younger children showed a literal \nprocessing tendency, the proportion of remaining responses that were literal interpretations \nwas entered as the dependent variable in a three-way ANOVA with age, transparency, and \nfamiliarity as factors. There were nineteen children in the older age group because one did \nnot make any errors in one condition. There was a significant main effect of age group, F(1, \n37) = 12.94, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .26, which arose because this response type was chosen more \nfrequently by younger than older children (Ms = .48 and .28). No other main effects or \ninteractions were significant.  \nIdioms: context present. To examine children\u2019s use of context, the proportion of \nremaining responses that were contextually plausible response options was entered as the \ndependent variable in a three-way ANOVA with age, transparency, and familiarity as factors. \nNone of the main effects and no interactions reached significance. \n4. Relations between Performance on the Semantic Analysis and Idiom Tasks \nThe older children obtained higher mean scores in the ambiguous sentences task than \nthe younger children: 37.90 (SD=7.51, range 23-59) and 26.7 (SD=8.91, range 19-50), \nrespectively. These scores differed significantly, t(38) = 4.30, p < .001, indicating that the \nolder children were more likely to come up with two alternate meanings for a greater number \nof items. Correlations were computed to explore the relation between semantic analysis skills \nand performance on the idiom task with context absent and present. Clearly there is confound \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n20 \nbetween age and semantic analysis skills, which must be borne in mind when interpreting \nthese data: older children have superior semantic analysis scores.  \nThe correlations revealed specific relations between semantic analysis scores and the \ncorrect selection of the idiomatic interpretation for transparent idioms. The correlations \nrepresented medium to large effects with context absent: familiar-transparent, r = .55, p < \n.001, and novel-transparent, r = .40, p = .01, and medium effects with context present: \nfamiliar-transparent, r = .32; and novel-transparent, r = .34, both ps < .05. There was also a \nsignificant correlation between semantic analysis skills and familiar-opaque idioms with \ncontext present, r = .42, p < .01. None of the other correlations with opaque items reached \nsignificance (context absent: familiar-opaque, r = .30; novel-opaque, r = .10; context present: \nnovel-opaque, r = .30, all ps > . 05.)  \nSummary of Results  \nWhen idioms were presented without a supportive context, developmental differences \nwere apparent. For transparent idioms, adults\u2019 and older children\u2019s selection of the idiomatic \nresponse was significantly above chance levels of responding; younger children\u2019s response \nrate was not. With context present, the adults and older children performed above chance \nlevels for all idiom types; the younger children only performed above chance for transparent \nitems. The main analysis of variance demonstrated that both groups of children benefited \nfrom the presence of context. For the younger children there was a general effect; for the \nolder children bigger gains were apparent for opaque idioms. These findings were supported \nby the analysis of novel items only. Additionally, the analysis of novel items demonstrated \nsuperior performance by the adults, in general. The independent measure of semantic analysis \nskills was significantly related with comprehension of transparent idioms in both presentation \nconditions (context present and absent). In addition, it was related to comprehension of \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n21 \nfamiliar opaque idioms when context was present. Crucially, semantic analysis skills did not \nsignificantly correlate with performance on novel opaque idioms.  \nDiscussion \nThe findings in relation to our four questions can be summarised as follows. First, \nboth groups of children were more likely to select the target interpretation when the idioms \nwere presented in context, indicating that the younger group can use context to work out the \nmeanings of the phrases. This effect was evident for familiar and novel idioms. Second, when \nnovel transparent idioms were presented without a supportive context, the adults and older \nchildren selected the idiomatic interpretation above chance levels of performance. The \nyounger children failed to do so. This finding suggests that the adults and older children were \nable to use semantic analysis to work out a sensible meaning for the transparent idioms. \nThird, performance on an independent measure of semantic analysis skills was related \nspecifically to comprehension of transparent idioms in the context absent condition indicating \nthe importance of semantic analysis in idiom comprehension (Nippold, 1998; Nippold & \nTaylor, 1995). Fourth, age differences found in the analysis of novel idioms demonstrate that \nthe language processing skills that aid idiom comprehension and acquisition are still not fully \ndeveloped in 9-10-year-olds. We discuss each of the main findings, in turn.  \nBoth groups of children benefited from the presence of context. This finding \ncomplements and extends those of Levorato and Cacciari (1999). We have demonstrated the \nfacilitatory effect of context using a within-subjects design. In addition, performance did not \napproach ceiling on the transparent items in the context absent condition, allowing for a \nrobust test of context effects on transparent idiom comprehension. There was evidence of \ndevelopmental change in the effective application of inference from context: the adults \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n22 \nshowed superior performance to both groups of children when idioms were presented in \ncontext.  \nOther research with this age group reports much higher levels of comprehension for \nidioms presented in context. In Levorato and Cacciari\u2019s (1999) study, 9-year-olds selected the \ncorrect response for 91.5% of transparent and 74.7% of opaque idioms; in our study the \ncorresponding values were 58% for familiar transparent and 48% for familiar opaque. \nDifferences in the items used and the number of response options (4 vs 3) are just two \nplausible reasons for the differences in apparent competence or task difficulty. Importantly, \nour study suggests that although 7- to 8-year-olds can use inference from context to support \nthe processing of idioms, this skill is still developing in 9- to 10-year-olds. This developing \nskill may aid the growth in idiom knowledge found beyond the primary school years \n(Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993; Nippold & Taylor, 1995).  \n In contrast to inference from context, a different pattern of developmental change was \nevident in the use of semantic analysis. The older children were able to analyse the \ncomponent words in the phrase to work out the meanings of idioms, although their \nperformance was not in line with adult levels. There was little evidence that 7- to 8-year-olds \ncould successfully use semantic analysis: the younger children did not perform significantly \nabove chance in understanding the novel transparent items. These findings support Levorato \nand Cacciari\u2019s (1999) conclusion that semantic analysis becomes increasingly important in \nthe later stages of the development of figurative competence.  \nAn alternative interpretation is that the younger children in our study attempted a \ncomponential analysis of the idioms, which led them to select the literal interpretation for \nsome expressions. The error analysis revealed a literal selection bias for idioms without \ncontext. It must be noted that the error analysis is not wholly independent from the analysis \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n23 \nof correct responses. However, the analysis of proportionate scores enabled us to determine \nwhether processing and response preferences were evident for either age group in the two \npresentation conditions. The tendency to select the literal response, rather than the \ncontextually plausible or implausible, suggests an analysis of component words took place.  \nIt is clear how a tendency toward a literal response might arise when we consider the \nconstruction of the four alternative answers. They were designed to focus on a literal \ninterpretation of one or two key words in each phrase, rather than a word-for-word literal \ninterpretation. Examination of our materials (see Table 1 for an example) indicates that a \nliteral response bias is consistent with the use of semantic analysis. For the idiom \u2018to be left \nout in the cold\u2019, the \u2018literal\u2019 response option \u2018to be sat by an open window\u2019 is related to a \nplausible interpretation of the consequences of sitting by an open window. Thus, the \ninclusion of the literal response option may have resulted in an underestimation of the 7- to 8-\nyear-olds\u2019 performance for transparent idioms. The younger age group may have used \nsemantic analysis to derive the meanings for the novel idioms and, in doing so, selected the \nliteral response option.   \n Other researchers have advised against including a literal option, albeit for different \nreasons, e.g.: \u201cliteral foils should be avoided because they may inadvertently make a task too \nsimple by allowing students to quickly eliminate obviously inappropriate choices\u201d  (Nippold \n& Taylor, 1995). In contrast, our data indicate that for the younger children, at least, the \nliteral option was plausible when no context was present.  \nSemantic analysis should aid comprehension of transparent idioms to a greater extent \nthan opaque idioms, because of the relation between component words and the figurative \nmeaning (e.g., Nippold, 1998; Nippold & Taylor, 1995). In support of this hypothesis, we \nfound that the independent measure of semantic analysis was related to correct idiom \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n24 \nselections for both novel and transparent idioms in the context absent condition. The effect \nsizes were medium to large (Cohen, 1988). Thus, the ability to come up with alternate \nmeanings for phrases containing ambiguous words and grammatical structures is related to \nthe ability to come up with appropriate meanings for transparent idioms. With context \npresent, performance was also correlated with correct responding on the familiar opaque \nitems as well. It is clear that the independent measure of semantic analysis skills taps broader \nlanguage skills. We explore this finding further in the General Discussion.  \nThe 9- to 10-year-olds did not perform at ceiling on any type of idiom with context \npresent: the adult participants\u2019 scores were substantially higher in this condition. The \ndifferences between the groups in performance on the novel idioms suggest that the language \nprocessing skills that aid idiom comprehension and acquisition are far from fully developed \nat 10 years. Our data suggest that these skills may develop over a longer period of time that \nthan proposed by Levorato and Cacciari (1995).  \nExperiment Two was designed to address two significant issues that arose from these \nfindings. First, we wanted to determine whether the youngest age groups\u2019 performance would \nimprove without the potentially misleading literal response option. Second, we wanted to \nstudy idiom comprehension in an older group of children. Levorato and Cacciari (1995) \nsuggest that the skills used to develop figurative language develop between 7-11 years. \nNippold\u2019s work (e.g., Nippold, 1998; Nippold & Taylor, 1995) demonstrates growth in idiom \ncomprehension during adolescence. However neither body of work has used novel idioms, \nmaking it hard to disentangle growth in idiom knowledge (which will be influenced by \ngreater experience with language) from growth in processing skills. We included a group of \nchildren aged 11-12 years to study the range of development in these skills, further.  \nExperiment Two \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n25 \nExperiment Two was conducted to explore the possibility that 7- to 8-year-olds can \nuse semantic analysis skills to derive non-literal meanings of idiomatic expressions. For the \nreasons outlined above, it seems possible that they were mislead in the first experiment by the \ninclusion of the \u2018literal\u2019 response options. We included a comparison group of children aged \n11-12 years to provide a more complete picture of the development of idiom processing skills \nfor the reasons presented above.   \nMethod \nParticipants \nWe report the complete data from sixty-two children: twenty in Year 3 aged 7-8 \nyears, 20 in Year 5 aged 9-10 years, and 22 in Year 7 aged 11-12 years3. The children \nattended two schools in the north-east of England, serving mixed catchment areas. Children \nwith a statement of special educational needs were excluded from the study. All of the \nchildren spoke British English as their first language and had parental permission to \nparticipate in this work.  \nExperimental Tasks and Procedure \nThe idioms and multiple-choice tasks were the same as those used in Experiment \nOne, with the exception that the literal foil was not included, making three options for each \nidiom. Testing for the two younger age groups was conducted in small groups in a quiet room \naway from the classroom; the older children were tested in their classroom4.  As before, the \nitems were presented in the same order for each child, distributed so that the same type of \nidiom did not appear consecutively and a different order was used for the context absent and \ncontext present conditions. The total number of each response option selected was calculated \n(maximum = 6, for each condition).  \nResults \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n26 \nThe mean sum scores obtained for correct idiomatic choices with context absent vs \npresent are shown in Table 5. Two sets of analyses were carried out. The first set used one-\nsample t-tests to compare responding on the idiom comprehension task to chance. The second \nset used ANOVAs to determine whether the magnitude of correct responding differed across \nages and in relation to the presence of a supportive story context.  \n1. Idiom Responses: Comparisons with Chance Level of Responding \nIdiom choices: context absent. A series of one-sample t tests for each age group was \nconducted to determine the likelihood that each group was able to select the correct response \nby chance. The chance level of selecting the idiomatic response for each condition was 2 (6 \ntrials with 3 options each). Because of the number of comparisons to be made, the alpha level \nwas set at .004.  \nFor the older children, the scores obtained for familiar transparent, familiar opaque, \nand novel transparent idioms were significantly greater than 1.5 indicating either knowledge \nof the idiom or an ability to derive the meaning of the expression: familiar transparent, t(21) \n= 12.05; familiar opaque, t(21) = 5.27; novel transparent, t(21) = 7.13 (all at p < .004). Scores \nfor the correct interpretation of the novel opaque idioms did not differ significantly from \nchance, t(18) = 1.62, p > .10. The two younger age groups showed a different pattern of \nperformance. The 9- to 10-year-olds responded above chance level on both types of \ntransparent idiom: familiar, t(19) = 3.86, and novel, t(19) = 4.77, (both ps < .004).  Their \nperformance on both types of opaque idiom did not differ from chance, both ts < 1.1. The \nyoungest children demonstrated the same pattern of performance. Their scores were above \nchance for both types of transparent idiom: familiar, t(19) = 4.41, and novel, t(19) = 6.14, \n(both ps < .004), and their performance on both types of opaque idiom did not differ from \nchance, both ts < 1.3.  \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n27 \n \nTABLE 4 AROUND HERE \n \nIdiom choices: context present. The mean sum scores obtained for correct idiomatic \nchoices are shown in Table 4. Each age group selected a greater number of idiomatic \nresponses when the context was present vs absent, indicating that context facilitated \nperformance. A series of one-sample t tests showed that all groups obtained scores that were \nsignificantly greater than chance (ps < .004) for all idioms.  \n2. Idiom Responses: Effects of Age and Context \nMain analysis. The total number of idiomatic choices made when context was absent \nvs present for each type of idiom were treated as the dependent variables in a four-way \nanalysis of variance. The ANOVA had the following factors: age (7-8, 9-10, 11-12 years) \nwas a between-subjects factor, context (absent, present,), familiarity (familiar, novel) and \ntransparency (transparent, opaque) were within-subjects factors. Where appropriate, partial \neta squared (\u03b7p2) is reported as the measure of effect size. This value estimates the proportion \nof total variance accounted for by the independent variable.  \nThere were significant and sizeable main effects of context, F(1,59) = 49.65, p < .001, \n\u03b7p\n2  = .46, and transparency, F(1,38) = 78.27, p < .001, \u03b7p2  = .57. There was a small effect of \nage, F(2,59) = 4.75, p < .02, \u03b7p2  = .14. The main effect of familiarity did not reach \nconventional levels of significance, F(1,59) = 3.25, p = .08.  \nThere were three significant two-way interactions. One was between age and \nfamiliarity, F(2,59) = 3.81, p < .03, \u03b7p2 = .12. Simple effects analysis revealed significant \ndifferences between familiar and novel idioms for the oldest age group, F(1, 59) = 11.35, p < \n.01, but not for the younger age groups, Fs < 1.0. There was a significant interaction between \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n28 \ncontext and transparency, F(1, 59) = 20.22, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .26. Looking at the simple main \neffects, there was a significant effect of context for transparent idioms, with higher scores \nwhen context was present vs absent, F(1, 61) = 7.74, p < .01, and a much stronger difference  \nfor opaque idioms when context was present vs absent, F(1, 61) = 55.84, p < .001. Further, \nthere was a significant effect of idiom type for context absent, with higher scores obtained for \ntransparent than opaque idioms, F(1, 61) = 78.81, p < .001,  and also for opaque idioms, F(1, \n61) = 11.62, p < .001.  \nThe final two-way interaction was between context and familiarity, F(1, 59) = 7.74, p \n< .01, \u03b7p2 = .12. Looking at the simple main effects, there was a significant effect of context \nfor familiar idioms, showing that scores were higher when context was present vs absent, \nF(1, 61) = 19.36, p < .001, and also for novel idioms with higher scores obtained in the \npresence of context, F(1, 61) = 46.57, p < .001. There was also a significant effect of idiom \ntype for context absent, with higher scores for familiar than for novel idioms, F(1, 61) = 8.49, \np < .01, but not for context present, F(1, 61) < 1.0.  \nNo other interactions reached significance: context X age, F(2, 59) = 2.76, p = .071; \nall other Fs < 1.85, ps > .17.  \nFIGURE 3 AROUND HERE \n \n Analysis of novel idioms. As before, an analysis of performance on the novel items \nonly was conducted. There were significant and substantial main effects of transparency, \nF(1,59) = 45.34, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .44, and context, F(1,59) = 54.48, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .48. There \nwas a significant interaction between context and transparency, F(1,59) = 18.95, p < .001, \u03b7p2 \n= .24. The three-way interaction between age, context, and transparency did not reach \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n29 \nconventional levels of significance: F(2,59) = 2.91, p = .062, \u03b7p2 = .09. No other main effects \nor interactions were significant, all Fs < 1.72, ps > .18.  \nSimple main effects analysis was used to explore the interaction between context and \ntransparency, which is depicted in Figure 3. The greatest difference was apparent between \nidiom types presented with context absent: the difference between transparent and opaque \nidioms in context was less. Simple main effects revealed the same pattern of significant \neffects as in the main analysis reported above: all Fs > 5.37, all ps < .025. \nSummary of Results \nThe oldest age group were significantly more likely than chance to select the \nidiomatic response for familiar transparent, novel transparent, and familiar opaque items; the \ntwo younger age groups performed above chance on familiar transparent and novel \ntransparent idioms, only. All groups performed above chance on all idiom types when \npresented in context. The analysis of variance revealed an interaction between age group and \nfamiliarity, which indicated that the older children had greater knowledge of the familiar \nidioms than the two younger age groups. There was also an interaction between context and \ntransparency, which arose because of enhanced performance across age groups for the \nopaque idioms with context present. Finally, there was a significant interaction between \ncontext and familiarity, because performance on the novel idioms was generally poor in the \nabsence of context.  \nDiscussion \nThe findings in relation to the development of inference from context and semantic \nprocessing skills can be summarised as follows. All age groups were able to use context to \nsupport their comprehension of both familiar and novel idioms. They selected a greater \nnumber of correct responses than chance when context was present and demonstrated a boost \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n30 \nfrom context in their performance on opaque idioms, in the analysis of variance. All age \ngroups were able to use semantic analysis to derive meanings for transparent idioms \npresented with context absent. We discuss these findings in relation to developmental \ndifferences in idiom knowledge, the processes involved in idiom acquisition and the findings \nof Experiment One.  \nThere was little evidence for developmental differences in the processing skills \nproposed to aid idiom acquisition and comprehension: semantic analysis and inference from \ncontext. All age groups performed above chance on novel transparent idioms with context \nabsent and benefited from the presence of context when processing opaque idioms. There \nwas not a significant effect of age in the analysis of novel idioms. This pattern of findings \ncontrasts with that of Experiment One, in which younger children did not perform above \nchance for transparent idioms with context absent and there was a sizeable effect of age in the \nmain analysis. In Experiment Two, we have support for the hypothesis that all three age \ngroups could use semantic analysis when presented with idioms with context absent. This \nsuggests that the performance of 7- to 8-year-olds may have been underestimated in \nExperiment One. As a result, the facilitatory effect of context was greatest for the novel \nopaque idioms, which could only be successfully interpreted in context.  \nDevelopmental differences in knowledge of idioms were evident: only the 11- to 12-\nyear-olds performed above chance on familiar opaque idioms with context absent. Indeed, the \npattern of performance of the older children was similar to that of the adults in Experiment \nOne: they obtained scores that were significantly above chance for both types of transparent \nidioms, and also for familiar opaque items. Unlike the adults in Experiment One,  the 11 to \n12-year-olds did not perform at ceiling, indicating that knowledge of idioms continues to \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n31 \ndevelop beyond the primary school years (see also, Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993; Nippold & \nTaylor, 1995).   \nGeneral Discussion \nThis research investigated developmental change in the processes used to comprehend \nidioms. There was evidence that children as young as 7 to 8 years can use both inference from \ncontext and semantic analysis to aid idiom comprehension. Two experiments demonstrated that \nall age groups benefited from the presence of a supportive story context to interpret idioms. In \nthe second experiment children between 7 and 11 years selected the target idiomatic \ninterpretation of idioms at above chance level when presented without a supportive story \ncontext (context absent). Further support for the contribution of semantic analysis was provided \nby the relation between an independent measure of semantic analysis and comprehension of \nfamiliar and novel transparent idioms in the context absent condition. A developmental change \nin the ability to use both semantic analysis and inference from context was apparent. \nThese findings broadly support the Global Elaboration Model of Levorato and \nCacciari (1995). They proposed that idioms are learned and understood using the language \nprocessing skills that are crucial to make sense of all forms of language: literal and figurative. \nLevorato and Cacciari (1999) concluded that the use of context is crucial to figurative \ncompetence and that learners become increasingly sensitive to the internal semantics of \nfigurative expressions, such as idioms. Further, they propose that these skills develop \nbetween 7 and 11 years. Our work suggests two important qualifications. First, semantic \nanalysis may contribute to idiom comprehension earlier in the development of figurative \ncompetence. We found that both context and semantic analysis were both related to idiom \nselection and that learners became increasingly able to use both skills to support their \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n32 \ninterpretation of unknown and\/or unfamiliar idioms. Second, the development of these \nprocessing skills continues beyond 11 years of age. \nAn early sensitivity to context in language learning and comprehension is well \ndocumented (e.g., Akhtar, 2006). Thus, it is not surprising to find that children aged 7 and \nabove understand idioms better when they are embedded in a supportive context. This is in \nline with previous investigations into idiom comprehension (e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1995, \n1999). There is less evidence that young children can use semantic analysis of the phrase to \nsupport idiom comprehension. We provide two strands of evidence to support an early ability \nto analyse the components of an idiomatic expression: comprehension of transparent idioms \nwhen no context was present and the relations between transparent idiom understanding and \nthe semantic analysis task.  \n The correlations between the semantic analysis task and both types of familiar idioms \nmay have arisen because children who know more than a single meaning of a homonym or \ncan compute different grammatical structures for the same word string are more likely to \nhave greater knowledge of real idioms. There may also be a relation between the familiarity \nof an idiom and its transparency (e.g., Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993). Thus, the contrast \nbetween the novel transparent and novel opaque idioms is of greatest interest here. That \nsuggests that semantic analysis skills, as tapped by our independent measure, do support the \nprocessing of transparent idioms. We would not argue that this skill alone is the only factor \ninvolved and, of course, the findings do not necessarily extend to everyday language \nprocessing: young children may not ignore a literal interpretation of an idiom presented in a \nconversation or story. However, semantic analysis appears to make a contribution to idiom \ncomprehension in line with Nippold\u2019s metasemantic hypothesis (Nippold, 1998; Nippold & \nTaylor, 1995).  \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n33 \n Our research indicates the capabilities of young children, but also demonstrates the \nextended period of development of these processing skills. The developmental differences in \nperformance on the familiar idioms indicate that knowledge of the meanings of familiar \nidioms is still being acquired in early adolescence (Nippold & Martin, 1989; Nippold & \nRudzinski, 1993; Nippold & Taylor, 1995). Our findings in relation to comprehension of the \nnovel expressions suggest that the language processing skills that aid the acquisition of \nidiomatic knowledge are not fully developed by 11 to 12 years. We found developmental \nimprovements in the use of context: adults were more likely than children to select the \nidiomatic response for novel opaque idioms presented in context. We also found evidence for \ndevelopmental improvements in semantic analysis: adults were more likely than children to \nselect the idiomatic response for novel transparent idioms presented without context.  \nThe children in our study were all young readers, whose experience with print may \nhave lead to greater attention to context and enhanced metalinguistic skills (Garton & Pratt, \n1998). Younger children understand figurative language, but there is a need for investigations \nof the processing skills that support their comprehension. Children aged between 4 and 6 \nyears demonstrate some knowledge of idioms assessed in forced-choice (Gibbs, 1987) and \nmultiple-choice (Caillies & Le Sourn-Bissaoui, 2006) tasks. Gibbs\u2019 (1987) data suggests an \nearly sensitivity to context: even the youngest children were poorer at selecting the correct \nresponse option in the context absent compared to context present condition. It is less clear \nwhether such young children can use semantic analysis when idioms are presented without a \nsupportive context. The kindergarteners (mean age 5 years, 8 months) in Gibbs\u2019 work did not \ndemonstrate sensitivity to the difference between the transparent and opaque items. Gibbs \nused real idioms, so it is possible that the meanings (or partial meanings) may have been \nknown to the children who succeeded on the task. Future work using novel idioms should \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n34 \ninvestigate whether children under 7 years can analyse the components of an idiomatic \nexpression to derive an appropriate meaning. Superior performance for transparent idioms, \nalbeit in context, suggests that they may be able to do so (e.g., (Caillies & Le Sourn-Bissaoui, \n2006); Gibbs 1987). \nWe did not investigate whether children made a deliberate choice to use either \ncontextual or semantic analysis. Further, it should be noted that we did not look at the \nspontaneous use of either processing skill to work out the meanings of idioms nor the age at \nwhich this will arise. The majority of work investigating idiom comprehension in young \nchildren has, like our own, used off-line tasks to measure performance, such as multiple \nchoice (Cacciari & Levorato, 1989; Levorato & Cacciari, 1989; Nippold & Taylor, 1995) or \nexplanation\/completion tasks (Gibbs, 1991; Levorato & Cacciari, 1995; Nippold & \nRudzinski, 1993). On-line tasks such as reading times and priming paradigms have been used \nsuccessfully to investigate the time-course of idiom meaning activation in adults for familiar \nidioms (Glucksberg, Newsome, & Goldvarg, 2001; Schweigert, 1986; Titone & Connine, \n1994). These procedures may prove useful to investigate the time course of figurative \nlanguage processing in younger populations, for whom idioms may be unfamiliar, to \nestablish whether the figurative meaning is derived or activated when the phrase is first \nencountered. This method would enable researchers to investigate an alternative explanation \nof the difference between Experiments One and Two: that the availability of the literal \nresponse option made it hard for the children in Experiment One to inhibit or suppress the \nliteral meaning in favour of a more figurative one.  \nComprehension of idioms requires sensitivity to context, but this is not the same as \nthe ability to derive an appropriate inference from context. Harris and colleagues looked at \nchildren\u2019s ability to detect inconsistencies in a text. Eleven-year-olds were more likely than \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n35 \n8-year-olds to show explicit recognition that a line did not make sense, but both age groups \nshowed implicit awareness of the inconsistency (measured by reading times) (Harris, \nKruithof, Terwogt, & Visser, 1981). The study by Harris and colleagues suggests a \nrefinement in our thinking about the development of children\u2019s language processing skills \nand increasing competence with idioms. All age groups in our research demonstrated \nawareness that the literal meaning of the phrase did not make sense in relation to the text. \nHowever, despite this sensitivity to context, they were best able to derive appropriate \nmeaning of the transparent idioms: performance for opaque idioms, for which context was \nthe sole source of information was poorer. This suggests that semantic analysis of the phrase \nmay help to refine or reinforce a meaning derived from context. Clearly, there may be an \nadditional interactive effect between inference from context and semantic analysis for idioms \npresented in context. It may be difficult to fully tease apart the influence of each in future \nwork, because it is not possible to study contextual processing without the involvement of \nsemantic processing, but this is an important issue for researchers to consider.  \nFinally, our work highlights the need to carefully consider the task used to measure \nperformance. We chose a multiple-choice task to minimise the cognitive demands of the task, \nwhich might unduly limit younger children\u2019s performance. This benefit comes with a cost: by \nusing this task, we cannot say for certain whether children were able to derive the meaning of \nphrases from semantic analysis or context; instead, they may have engaged an elimination \nand matching strategy. This has been a criticism of other previous studies of idiom \ncomprehension. We contend that the multiple-choice task does have its uses, for the reasons \noutlined in this paper, but that converging evidence from other measures, such as \nexplanation, is required. Clearly, the choice of distracter items should be made with care \n(Nippold & Taylor, 1995). In this study, the literal choice options available to children in \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n36 \nExperiment One may well have underestimated the performance of the younger children, \nbecause of the literal response bias.  \nIn summary, we have demonstrated the importance of both inference from context \nand semantic analysis to idiom processing. Both strategies can be used from a young age: 7- \nto 8-year-olds can use semantic analysis to process novel and unfamiliar idiomatic \nexpressions when they are amenable to semantic analysis, as well as being sensitive to \nmeaning in context. Our work suggests that young children are capable of processing \nfigurative language at both the small-grained phrase-level as well as the discourse-level to \nestablish meaning. Future work should address when these factors are used spontaneously in \nlanguage processing and the factors that influence their development.  \nprocessing skills and children\u2019s idiom comprehension \n37 \nReferences \nAkhtar, N.
