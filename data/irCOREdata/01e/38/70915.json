For any given statement of opinion, we need to ask whom the respondent thinks they are talking to, who they are talking as, why are they saying this just now, how this issue fits in the conversation. Traditional public opinion research tells us what the people say;  this line of research is equally interested in how they say it.  And in studying how they say it, this research leads us to questions about the way people think of themselves and present themselves to others. I will present three fragments of public opinion research on one heavily researched topic:  public attitudes to nuclear power and nuclear waste.  The topic is heavily researched because it matters both to the public, worried about safety and about energy supplies, and to the industries that build and operate nuclear plants, and need to find ways of persuading the reluctant public (see for instance, the Nuclear Energy Institute at www.nei.org).  My textual examples are from a national survey series (in the US, where there have been surveys asking the same questions over long periods), a single 5 Presser 2003; Bulmer 2004).  Some of the most interesting findings have been on cognitive processes studied through think-aloud protocols of respondents answering questions (DeMaio and Rothgeb 1996) or post-questionnaire debriefing (Belson 1981).","cites":null},{"id":16375489,"title":"Arguing and Thinking : A Rhetorical Approach to Social Psychology.

The results were used by Copeland Borough Council (the unit of local government for the area around the plant) in their submission to an inquiry on the proposed use of Sellafield as a nuclear waste site in addition to its other functions.

The problem is not just that we in applied linguistics lack a big crossover \nbestseller that tells the public what we do, like those of Stephen Pinker on language \nacquisition and psychology (Pinker 1995).  There are good writers of potentially popular \nbooks in our field (e.g., Agar 1994; Cameron 2000).  But the popular books by academics \nthat sell in airport bookshops and are talked about in radio programmes, the books with \nsubtitles beginning \u2018How . . .\u2019 or \u2018Why . . .\u2019, appeal by offering hidden and complete \nknowledge in an authoritative tone.   \nWhat we can offer is an appreciation of what is there on the surface, the intricate \nway people interact, and the difference these little intricacies make in social action and \nchange.  Such detailed studies of talk about opinions have shown ambivalences in \nattitudes to people with AIDS (Miller et al. 1998), shared anxieties about inner-city \ncommunity policing (Matoesian and Coldren 2002), evaluation of claims of experts \n(Myers 2004), and hope, guilt, and defensiveness about environmental sustainability \n(Hinchliffe 1996; Myers and Macnaghten 1998).  The ways people talk connect to the \nways they see their world and the ways they act in it and on it.  If there is a crisis in \npublic opinion research, it is not a technical problem of sampling, calculation, or \nprediction, it is that people no longer recognise their own talk and actions in the slogans \nand the numbers attached to them in surveys.  That is where we come in. \n \n \n25 \nDigest poll to predict the 1936 US Presidential election.  Gallup\u2019s technical innovation \nwas the use of a small but carefully designed representative sample (which enabled him \nto predict the 1936 election more or less accurately).  Gallup\u2019s method, systematising \nwhat had been left to unsystematic straw poll and crowd counts, quantifying it, and \ncommodifying it, fitted a model of modernity.  Readers of polls could recognise the man \nor woman with the clipboard, the reporting forms, the central calculation office, the \nstatistical results, as signs of a new and improved public opinion. \nPolls are now much better at predicting voting behaviour, within their stated \nlimits.  But often organisations and people are interested in something much more \ncomplicated than predicting an election, that is, understanding what people treat as an \nissue, what it means to them in their relations with others, what links they make between \nit and other issues, how much they care about it, how it relates to their daily round of \nwork, commuting, shopping, cooking, getting kids to school.  That is why clients who \nneed to know more about response to a policy or decision commission focus groups, \ncitizen juries, inquiries, and other qualitative techniques for researching public opinion \n(the Nirex study cited here is an example (Hunt and Simmons 2001)).  But if these rich \nqualitative studies are then framed in terms of clients\u2019 expectations, and reported back to \nthem in catch phrases, they are still not getting a sense of how people are talking.   \nWe may be able to show, as Gallup did, that there is a crisis in public opinion \nresearch;  we may have more trouble in showing that we have a solution.  Applied \nlinguists are unlikely to sign up hundreds of newspapers to carry their reports of public \nopinion, the way Gallup did.  Conversation analysis may provide insights but it does not \nprovide headlines;  there is no news in bringing out what everyone knows but no one \n24 \nwaste, GMOs, mobile phones, or even a proposal for speed bumps in a residential street \ncannot wait until we arrive at what would be an ideal design of a discussion.  There are \nalso issues of scale.  Even relatively small exercises in consultation and public opinion \nresearch, exercises perhaps smaller than they should be, take place on a grand scale, \nrequiring a large organisation.  There are many insights to be had from the kind of small-\nscale academic study that characterises my own work, but by definition public opinion is \nsomething broader. \nMaking a difference \n Despite the problems in adapting applied linguistics to this new area, public \nopinion is too important to leave to commercial polling organisations, academic public \nopinion specialists, newspapers and television networks.  These institutions claim to \nspeak for \u2018the people\u2019, and their results can be powerful, as they recirculate and define \nthe terms of political and practical possibility, on nuclear power, gun control, war, \ngenetically modified foods, vaccinations, trade agreements, or on issues that aren\u2019t even \nrecognised as issues because opinions are not surveyed and do not circulate in this way.  \nIf applied linguists who study language and interaction want to intervene, we might \nconsider how these institutions got to be so powerful (Herbst 1993; Schudson 1998).   \n George Gallup offered an origin myth for public opinion research when he traced \nthe success of his commercial polling organisation to the failure of a previously trusted \nway of packaging opinions, the provision of a superior technology, and the enlistment of \nmedia organisations, because his results were comprehensible to the public as news \n(Gallup and Rae 1940).  We too may be witnessing a failure of current institutions of \nopinion, even if it is not as spectacular as the case Gallup uses, the failure of the Literary \n23 \npsychologists who look at cognitive entities in terms of situated interactions (e.g., Billig \n1987; Middleton and Edwards 1990; Suchman and Jordan 1990; Edwards and Potter \n1992; Antaki and Rapley 1996; Edwards 1997).  \n3. Practitioners and academics may not conceptualise the \u2018real world problem\u2019 in \nthe same way.  Public opinion researchers conceive of opinions as measurable outputs \nrelated to real underlying cognitive entities, attitudes.  Discourse analysts and linguists \nmore generally are likely to see them as forms of interaction, tokens in our exchanges \nwith other people.  They develop ways of making their studies faster, more reliable, and \nmore easily represented, while we may be making their work slower, more difficult, and \nmore complicated.  It would not be surprising if they did not queue up to benefit from our \ninsights.   \n4. Practitioners and academics may not conceptualise \u2018language\u2019 in the same way, \neither.  For practitioners in this field, language seems to be an opaque screen between \nthem and their object, a potential source of distortion to be repaired by attention to \ngrammar and word choice (Payne 1951; Sudman and Bradburn 1982).  For discourse \nanalysts, language brings with it the historical conditions, cultural value systems, \nambivalences, interrelations of participants, and conceptions of the speech event.  We see \nlanguage use as constituting and shaping organisations, identities, social changes, and \nagency, not as providing a more or less transparent medium for the real entities.  \n5. As a practical matter, academic timescales are radically different from those of \nnonacademics.  Academics plan their projects over years, and since we are generally \npart-time researchers, even small projects spread out.  We tend to focus on aspects of \nproblems that can be studied intensively and in general terms.  Consultations on nuclear \n22 \nhave to reconsider our relation to practitioners, and be cautious about presenting \nourselves as experts. \n1.  Most of the studies of language in institutions of opinion are not by applied \nlinguists.  Public opinion researchers are, of course, already familiar with WH- questions, \npresuppositions, connotations, and polysemy, and their studies of question wording \nprovide empirical tests of interpretations that go beyond most of our work in semantics \nand pragmatics.  Focus group moderators know more than I do about group dynamics, \nand those who write reports on focus groups have an effective, if implicit, system for \nanalysing them.  There have indeed been important studies by linguists (Low 1996; Low \n1999 on questionnaires; Matoesian and Coldren 2002 on focus groups), but we are just as \nlikely to learn about language use from public opinion researchers who have accumulated \nyears of hard-won experience with ambiguity and interpretation.  This rather humbling \nsituation is a consequence of a definition of applied linguistics in terms of real world \nproblems \u2013 given a problem involving language, it is not necessarily the case that our \nrather small academic discipline will get there first, or that it will have all the necessary \ntools.   \n2.  We bring our own disciplinary biases to new areas.  I have criticized the view of \nopinions as cognitive entities located in individuals, to be elicited by survey questions \nand analysed statistically.  But large parts of applied linguistics take just such an \napproach to cognitive entities in language learning, as if they could be considered apart \nfrom the situated interactions in which they are elicited.  For instance, questionnaire \nstudies of attitudes towards language learning have the same basic problem of reifying \ncognitive entities.  I think we have a lot to learn from sociologists and social \n21 \nNiemeyer 2003).  Experiments initiated by government agencies, whether Oregon Health \nDecisions (see http:\/\/www.cpn.org\/topics\/health\/commoregon.html ) or the UK \ngovernment\u2019s debate on genetically modified organisms, GM Nation (see \nhttp:\/\/www.gmnation.org.uk\/), are useful exercises in broadening consultation, but \nremain uncritical about what constitutes opinion.  There have been some interesting \nprescriptions from counselors, political scientists, and activists, for instance from the \nPublic Conversations Project (http:\/\/www.publicconversations.org) (Becker et al. 1995), \nand the Deliberative Democracy Consortium (http:\/\/www.deliberative-democracy.net). \nWhat sorts of forums open out discussions to a wider range of participants and views, \nmore engagement between conflicting views, more commitment to and examination of \nwhat one says?  And one might reasonably ask, of such ideal debates, who would then \nparticipate, and why.  People enjoy polemics, slogans, repetition of what they already \nknow, playful abuse.  Rants, it seems, are entertaining.  If there was to be an open and \nrational discussion of nuclear waste on the television at 8 o\u2019clock tonight, with detailed \npresentation of all the arguments, would you turn it on?  Really? \nApplied linguists and \u2018the real world\u2019  \nI would like to draw from this particular case \u2013 industries of opinion \u2013 some more general \nobservations about how applied linguists approach real world problems, such as those we \nsee in other papers in this issue.  Such contacts may lead us to questions about our \ndiscipline, our framing of problems, our assumptions about language, the scope and scale \nof research, our own disciplinary biases, and our relation to wider audiences.  In all these \nissues, as in earlier applications to language learning, education, or lexicography, we \n20 \nDeliberation and discourse \nCritics of polling have long worried about a \u2018bandwagon effect\u2019 in which polls \nwould bias public opinion by leading people to join the most popular opinion;  polling \nresearchers have long argued that such an effect does not exist (Gallup and Rae 1940).  \nBut the omnipresence of institutions of opinion may have other, more subtle effects, \nreifying public opinion as something out there, already formed and ready to be elicited.  \nSome political theorists have argued that the sum of such individual opinions does not \nconstitute public opinion, whatever Gallup, MORI, USA Today and the Daily Mail might \nsay. They argue for \u2018deliberative democracy\u2019, and argue that truly public opinion begins \nto emerge when one individual opinion has to encounter another, and engage with it in \ndialogue (Dryzek 1990; Benhabib 1996; Elster 1998; Kim et al. 1999).  These theorists \nargue that decisions based on dialogue are not just more legitimate, they are better, \nbecause they have more experiences to draw on, and they are more likely to be accepted.  \nCritical discourse analysts have argued that there is a gap between the existing \npublic sphere and the ideal, and that gap is certainly there.  Fairclough (2000), for \ninstance, calls for democratic dialogue that \u2018is accessible to anyone . . .is sensitive to \ndifference . . . gives space for disagreement, dissent, and polemic . . . gives space for new \npositions . . . to emerge . . . [and] can lead to action\u2019 (182).  A typical poll, focus group, \nor radio phone-in does not begin to meet these criteria.   \nBut we need to ask what sort of forum could provide something like the ideal of \ndialogue. It is interesting that with all the ink spilled in the last two decades on \ndeliberative democracy (in political theory) and dialogicality (in discourse analysis), \nthere has been so little academic study of actual public dialogues (but see Goodin and \n19 \ncome) with scare quoted around them.  They do not just express an opinion, they are a \nway of talking about expressions of opinion as familiar, everyday conversational acts.  \nParticipants in focus groups may not just express the group norm;  they may report views \nof other people, not in the group, or take up devil\u2019s advocate positions.  Commonplaces \ncan be ways of opening and acknowledging dialogue. \n Commonplaces are at the heart of public opinion, but they are a problem for \ninstitutions of opinion if they mean people repeat back to researchers the same phrases \npeople have been offered as encapsulating public opinion.  This circularity is particularly \napparent in the web surveys provided for instance by \u2018QuickVote\u2122\u2019;  when one comes \nacross the page one reads a list of colloquial statements on an issue, clicks one, and then \nimmediately compares one\u2019s own \u2018vote\u2019 to those of others who have clicked on the site.  \nThese surveys usually have a disclaimer about the obviously biased sample:  \u2018This \nQuickVote is not scientific and reflects the opinions of only those Internet users who \nhave chosen to participate. The results cannot be assumed to represent the opinions of \nInternet users in general, nor the public as a whole\u2019.  But the problem is not just with the \nsample, but with the choices as well:  we are offered what we will think (on the basis of \nthe news on the rest of the page) is an issue on which we must have an opinion, and we \nare offered the sorts of words in which we might express this opinion.  And then, \ninstantly, these words are given back to us as an aggregate opinion.  Snapshot public \nopinion surveys work more slowly and with a more careful sample, but with the same \ncircularity.  \n18 \nskepticism.  In Example 3, M2\u2019s \u2018let\u2019s put it this way\u2019 signals that what follows is to be \ntaken as one phrasing, that there are alternative, perhaps more direct ways of saying this.  \nHe says \u2018it\u2019s . pushed under the carpet\u2019, bringing out the commonplace after a pause.  The \nuse of the commonplace conveys not just that any accidents there might have been have \nbeen concealed, but that they all recognise and share this suspicion of such organisations \nand the ways they might act.  The lack of knowledge and the suspicion are both offered \nas shared, not as just the opinion of this speaker:  \u2018we haven\u2019t been told anything . to the \ncontrary have we.\u2019  Or consider a phrase that comes up, not in this passage, but in many \nfocus groups:  people (or sheep) who live near nuclear installations are said to \u2018glow in \nthe dark\u2019 (or to have extra limbs).  The phrase usually raises a laugh, even when used by \npeople who live near a nuclear installation, but it also conveys vividly the sense of \nstigmatization that may underlie the answers in Example 2, the survey near Sellafield. \nCommonplaces are at the heart of legitimate public opinion \u2013 they are one way of \nreferring to shared experiences and points of view, and affirming or questioning what we, \nas this group here and now, take for granted.  There is a long history, from Plato to \nBourdieu, of critique of what people take for granted, of \u2018judgment without reflection\u2019 to \nuse Vico\u2019s phrase (for background on Vico, see Grassi 1990; for background on \nBourdieu, see Myles 2004).  What distinguishes commonplaces from the taken-for-\ngranted doxa is that they are by no means unchallengeable;  people use commonplaces as \ncommonplaces, and happily invoke a commonplace and its opposite for the same \nargument, or the same commonplace for opposite arguments (Billig 1987);  pro- and anti-\nnuclear lobbies can both appeal to the need to protect the environment.  Commonplaces \nsuch as \u2018Political correctness gone mad\u2019 or \u2018Think globally act locally\u2019 come (or should \n17 \nCommonplaces \n Circularity is built into public opinion research:  the big survey organizations ask \nquestions abut the issues that are news, and their results then become news (Bourdieu \n1990; Bourdieu 1993; Herbst 1993; Schudson 1998).  Surveys assume a shared repertoire \nof issues that people talk about;  that\u2019s why they can use standard questions (and why \nphone-in callers can name their topic in a word or two, and opinions can fit on a placard \nor bumper sticker).  They rely on commonplaces, (koinos topoi, loci communes).  This is \nthe rhetorician\u2019s term for short evocations of standard arguments that will work in many \nsituations (Myers and Macnaghten 1998). Though people who aren\u2019t rhetoricians \ntypically use the term \u2018commonplace\u2019 to demean a statement, John Shotter, following \nVico, argues that they are worth attention, that \u2018sensory topics\u2019 can carry the \u2018socially \nshared identities of feeling\u2019 of a community (Vico 1988 [1710]; Shotter 1993).  \nReferences to 9\/11, our children\u2019s future, the need to take care of one\u2019s own family or \nlocal group first, or the necessity of the daily drive to work could all be commonplaces;  \none doesn\u2019t need to spell out one\u2019s argument.  Ellen Barton looks at the use of formulaic \nphrases and commonplaces in a support group for parents of disabled children;  they draw \non an existing repertoire, while also signalling a solidarity and shared experience among \nmembers of the group (1999).   \nCommonplaces, pools of shared ways of arguing, are both an opportunity and a \nproblem for opinion research;  an opportunity because they are textual instances of shared \nidentities, and a problem because these instances are unstable in meaning.  When \nspeakers use commonplaces, they say something on the current topic, but they also \ninvoke a sense of shared experience and perspective, or ironic predictability, or \n16 \nthis anxiety.  (See Waterton and Wynne (1999) for discussion of laughter in focus group \ndiscussions of risk).  In a focus group, it is exactly the community sense of shared norms \nthat is at issue (Bloor et al. 2001), not the aggregation of individual levels of knowledge, \ntrust, or anxiety.   \n So far I have been praising focus groups because they are more accessible than \nsurveys for interpretation of interaction.  But focus groups are not a form of open \ndiscussion;  they have their own institutional form.  The obvious constraints are the \nmoderator\u2019s control and topic guide;  a more subtle constraint is the participants\u2019 \nemerging sense of what the group is for. As they look around the room and see who else \nis there, they may talk as locals, or farmers, or mothers, or retired people.  Kitzinger has \nnoted that the ongoing interaction makes some responses possible and closes off others \n(1994).  Claudia Puchta and Jonathan Potter have shown in a series of studies the way the \nmoderator provides slots for responses that will be easily detached and used in reports \n(1999; 2004).  Greg Matoesian and Chip Coldren have analysed part of an evaluation \ngroup discussion of community policing, and have argued that we miss the response of \nparticipants if we look only at their words, missing their full performance using gaze and \ngestures (2002).  My own research has looked at agreement and disagreement, topic \nshifts, and reported speech, and has considered different styles of moderation (Myers \n1998; Myers 1999; Myers and Macnaghten 1999; Macnaghten and Myers 2003; Myers \n2004).  For most public opinion researchers, these variations in the nature of interaction \nare trouble, because they make it impossible to abstract any underlying entity, much less \na quantity, for \u2018public opinion\u2019.   \n15 \nwith one\u2019s community (Wynne 1982; Zonabend 1993; Bolter 1996; Myers forthcoming).  \nThe reported feeling of safety is worth recording, but the utterances indicate particular \ninteractions, not necessarily an underlying attitude that exists independent of who is \ntalking to whom. \n I have already noted an aggregation of these \u2018around heres\u2019 is not a generalised \nresponse to the abstraction of the local, but a confused summation of many concrete \nlocalities.  And in each of these places, the assertion that one would feel safe with a plant \nnear here could be made with different meanings, as a way of displaying skepticism \nabout claims of environmentalists, or showing common sense in the face of pressure \ngroup campaigns, or comparing these dangers to others, or denying the implication that \none is a hypocritical NIMBY who accepts the need for nuclear power but says \u2018Not In \nMy Back Yard\u2019. Bronislaw Szerszynski has drawn on speech act theory to argue that \nstatements of trust are in part performative, that to say \u2018I trust you\u2019 is a commitment that \nis meant to make you more likely to be worthy of that trust (Szerszynski 1999).  In this \nperspective, when people say that a plant is safe, it could be that they are not describing a \nsituation, but trying to bring it about.   \n As we see in Example 3, a focus group transcript can suggest some (though not \nall) of the interaction going on in eliciting an opinion.  The joking about the iodine, for \ninstance, serves several functions:  showing knowledge of what preparations for an \naccident might involve, giving the sense that these preparations are inadequate, and that \n\u2018outsiders\u2019 would be excluded, and that bureaucratic procedures and inefficiency would \nundermine any procedure.  And the laughter suggests that this view of the situation is \nshared by some or all of the group, and that the group also shares a way of dealing with \n14 \n\u2018if we were told something you\u2019d worry\u2019, that \u2018if anything has happened it\u2019s pushed \nunder the carpet\u2019.  This response unpacks the formulation in a way that is not possible \nwith a questionnaire, drawing out the different contingencies that might affect an answer, \nand emphasizing the contradictory feelings between the need for the public to believe in \nthe plant management, and the unspoken doubts that remain.   \n Some of the other issues of wording, of \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019, and \u2018around here\u2019, also \ndepend on interaction, on who is talking to whom for what purpose.  In Example 2, the \nreport compares responses from people living close to Sellafield to responses from other \nlocations in the region, to make a point about the attitudes of those who should, \npresumably, know the plant best and have most cause to worry about it.  But it can be \nargued that the people living close to Sellafield were answering a different question. \nWaterton and Wynne (1999) point out some of the issues of recipient design here:  an \noutsider is asking about the area\u2019s largest employer, perhaps one\u2019s own employer, in \nquestions that assume one can simply agree or disagree.  There are also more subtle \ncultural issues in any response;  one might feel pride in one\u2019s work and that of one\u2019s \nwork colleagues, guilt about the risks some say nuclear workers bring to their families \n(even if one doubts the risks exist), fatalism about any possibility of changing the plant or \norganization, disgust at different kinds of pollution, isolation in living in a region that is \nout of sight for most people in the country (and therefore a possible site for nuclear \nplants), or anger at outsiders who know none of this and joke about Sellafield workers \nglowing in the dark.  If one lives in a community that is stigmatised as polluted and \ndangerous, and one is talking to someone from outside, one might assert agreement with \nthe safety of the plant, or disagreement with the implied criticism, as a form of solidarity \n13 \n7. M2   well let's put it this way . we haven't been \ntold anything . to the contrary have we \n8. M mm \n9. M2 if we were told something then you'd worry about \nit . but it's kept quiet . if anything has \nhappened it's . pushed under the carpet \n \nEven with 22 focus groups (in eleven sites), the study of which this transcript is a part \ncannot give us the scope of the surveys in Example 2, much less the huge scope over \nspace and time of the series in Example 1.  But focus groups can tell us about what \npeople do in expressing an opinion, and that can be particularly important in sensitive \nissues such as those around risk and local identities.   \nInteraction \nThe issues about multiple interpretations of wording that I raised with the survey \nquestions apply as well to the questions a focus group moderator might introduce into the \ndiscussion, but in a focus group we can also see which interpretations the participants are \ntaking this time, for their purposes.  In line 6 of Example 3, the Moderator formulates the \ndiscussion up to this point as saying that they are \u2018pretty confident\u2019 about the levels of \nregulation and control at the plant.  But the response is not a simple matter of agreeing or \ndisagreeing, or of placing a response on a scale from \u2018very confident\u2019 to \u2018very skeptical\u2019.   \nA participant begins (7) with a marker of a dispreferred turn, \u2018well\u2019, and \u2018let\u2019s put it this \nway\u2019, suggesting that his response is not going to confirm this formulation, and then he \ngives three different responses, that \u2018we haven\u2019t been told anything to the contrary\u2019, that \n12 \ngovernment to deal with nuclear waste.  It is worth noting that Nirex was conducting \nresearch on how best to open up preliminary public discussion of waste disposal sites \n(Hunt and Simmons 2001), that is, the client was interested in how people said things \n(and how they might say more) as well as what they said.  Traditional survey methods \nand official inquiries had failed to give any clear insight into what to do with nuclear \nwaste;  not surprisingly, people seem to want something done with it, but not near them.  \nThe following excerpt is from a group of people living near a conventional nuclear power \nplant now being decommissioned;  they are talking about the official procedures in case \nof an accident.  One participant has just said she thinks local officials are supposed to \nhave iodine ready. \n \n1. F1 I think there are plenty of . supplies for the \nlocals= \n2. F2        =for the locals ((laughter)) \n3. M1 probably need to get a prescription for it \nthough .  that\u2019s gonna take three weeks \n((laughter)) \n4.

Mod1 so . you seem to be saying you're you're pretty \nconfident about the levels of . regulation the \nlevels of control \n11 \nProfessionals in public opinion research might point out that all these issues are potential \nproblems, but not necessarily real problems for a given purpose.  The survey researcher \ncan test out different wordings, and use different wordings on different but related \nquestions; the problems will wash out over the whole survey, or the series over time, and \nthe results will be reliable.  So if there are ambiguities of interpretation of \u2018safe\u2019, they are \nthe same ambiguities year after year, and the series shows reliable changes even if the \npercentage responses on one year\u2019s results might be questioned.   \nBut the reliable result may still be the aggregation of very different interactions, \npeople presenting themselves in different ways for what they see as different purposes.  \nThese interactions are lost to us as readers of the report of public opinion.  They may \nmatter to us if we are just interested in predicting how people will vote (polls are \ndemonstrably effective at predicting that).  But they do matter to us if we are interested in \nthe tensions and contradictions within people\u2019s views, the ways they use opinions to \npresent themselves to others, and to relate to friends and family, the ways they use taken-\nfor-granted and familiar opinions, the ways opinions relate to other kinds of talk, and \ncrucially, the way talk about everyday practices such as shopping, travel, or taking the \nkids to school might relate to actions (Billig 1987; Shotter 1993; Billig 1995; Antaki et al. \n1996; Antaki 1997; Puchta and Potter 2002).  For insights into these aspects of opinion, \nwe might turn to less structured interviews, or to focus groups, where the interactions \naround key terms would be treated as interesting, rather than as problematic. \nExample 3: a focus group extract \nThe following extract is from one of a series of focus groups conducted by Jane Hunt and \nPeter Simmons, in a study commissioned by Nirex, the organisation created by the UK \n10 \nknowledge of its design, or trust (or lack of trust) in those who work there, or \none\u2019s sense of agency in doing something about any dangers.  In the context of \nother questions in the Roper Survey (Example 1), \u2018safety\u2019 is to be evaluated in \ncomparative terms, considering other dangers.  But comparison is also \nproblematic, requiring some uniform standard of measurement between risks that \npose different kinds of uncertainty, different levels of control, and different kinds \nof effects.  (For difficulties in evaluating public perception of risk, see Slovic \n(2001) and Lupton (1999);  for a study of risk in cultural terms see Douglas and \nWildavsky (1982)). \n\u2022 Someplace near here and near Sellafield:  \u2018Someplace near here\u2019 must be \ndeliberately vague, to fit all the possible local geographies of the respondents in a \nnational survey.  But \u2018here\u2019 has all sorts of meanings not only in geographical \nscope (five miles? The whole valley?  The whole county?), but also in \ngeographical meanings:   it could be \u2018in this area that already has toxic waste \ndumps\u2019 or \u2018here in Nevada that has had a disproportionate part of radiation risk\u2019 \nor \u2018here in Michigan where there is high unemployment\u2019 or \u2018here where I look out \non my view of the Pacific\u2019.  In Example 2 the researchers can be more specific \nthan in a national survey. But asking about living \u2018near Sellafield\u2019 is different \nfrom asking about living \u2018in West Cumbria\u2019, \u2018on the sea\u2019, \u2018near the Lake District\u2019, \nor \u2018far from cities\u2019, all of which are equally true descriptions of the place the \nsurvey was administered.  \u2018Near Sellafield\u2019 emphasizes that this plant defines the \nidentity of the place, that others think there is good reason not to feel safe there.   \n9 \nwording in Examples 1 and 2, even though the items were undoubtedly well designed for \ntheir purposes: \n\u2022 You and I:   Payne starts his list of problem words with \u2018you\u2019, because it can be \nboth singular and collective;  the \u2018you\u2019 in example 1 could mean \u2018you personally\u2019 \nor (less probably) \u2018you around here\u2019.  In Example 2 the researchers avoid this \nambiguity by phrasing the question as \u2018I think . . .\u2019 \u2013 though they may still have \nrespondents who answer for others around them rather than themselves.   \n\u2022 Think, believe, and feel:  Payne also warns against \u2018believe\u2019 as a questionnaire \nword.  For some respondents, \u2018I think\u2019 may imply knowledge and reflection, and \nbe stronger, while for others \u2018I believe\u2019 may imply deeper conviction.  So in \nExample 2, some could have taken the issue in statements 1 and 2 to be, not the \ndifference between \u2018safe living near Sellafield\u2019 and \u2018a safe industry\u2019, but the \ndifference between \u2018think\u2019 and \u2018believe\u2019.  In Example 1, some people \u2018say\u2019 one \nthing and some people \u2018say\u2019 another, but you are asked what you \u2018feel\u2019, a word \nthat is not always used with embedded propositions;  this use could imply \nstronger conviction than what people merely say, or less certainty than what \npeople think. \n\u2022 Safe and danger:  In both Example 1 and Example 2, we might look for instance \nat how people interpret \u2018safe\u2019 \u2013 as completely safe, safe enough, provided with \nappropriate protections, comparatively safe.  In Example 1, \u2018safe\u2019 contrasts with \n\u2018would present dangers\u2019, with the implication that only something without any \ndangers is safe.  People have more complex views of risk.  For instance, one could \nevaluate the safety of a plant in terms of statistics on possible failure, or \n8 \nExample 2:  a survey report \nWe can compare this national series to a smaller-scale study in the UK conducted in 1995 \nby North East Market Surveys on people living in West Cumbria, a beautiful and rather \nsparsely populated area of England in which the main employer is the largest nuclear \ninstallation in the UK, the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  The results were \nused by Copeland Borough Council (the unit of local government for the area around the \nplant) in their submission to an inquiry on the proposed use of Sellafield as a nuclear \nwaste site in addition to its other functions.  Respondents were asked to agree or disagree \nwith four statements, with the results given below: \n \n[Figure 2 here] \n \nThe report also noted that those who lived in Seascale (the nearest village to the plant) \nand those who worked in the plant were more likely to agree with the reassurances in the \nfirst two statements, and disagree with the criticisms in the third and fourth.  I am taking \nthis example from a paper by Waterton and Wynne (Waterton and Wynne 1999), who \nuse it to criticise some of the assumptions made in surveys on risk;  I will return to some \nof their comments.    \nWords and interpretations \nMost of the research and guidance on both surveys and focus groups is concerned with \nthe planning and wording;  for instance, Stanley Payne\u2019s classic The Art of Asking \nQuestions (1951) is a witty demonstration of some unexpected ambiguities and \nassociations in apparently straightforward questions.  We can find some issues of \n7 \nlocal survey (done in my region of the UK), and a focus group transcript (also in the UK, \nwere there have been extensive efforts at public consultation on the topic).  I will \nconsider possible questions about the words in these texts, the interactions, the role of \ncommonplaces, and the models of public discourse they suggest. \nExample 1:  a national survey series \nEugene Rosa and Riley E. Dunlap have reviewed three decades of polling on public \nattitudes towards nuclear power in the US, for the main US journal of public opinion \nresearch (1994).  One of the many items they consider is a question asked in October of \neach year by the Roper organization, concerning the safety of power plants. \n \n[Figure 1 here]  \n \nI should note that I have simplified the presentation and argument given by Rosa and \nDunlap;  they give the full series for each year 1973-1990, and compare the results to \nthose from other, more detailed questions, in which respondents compare the risks posed \nby various means of producing power, and estimate the risks associated with nuclear \nplants in comparisons to other risks they might face.  Their response to many of the \ncriticisms one might make of specific question items might be that they are pointing to \nthe change of opinion over time, not some essentialist snapshot, and that they are \nreferring to risk in relative terms, not asking respondents to arrive at absolute figures.  \nThe years I have chosen are those noted by Rosa and Dunlap to show shifts in opinion \nafter the accidents at Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl (1986). \n6 \nline of research that focuses on the encounter that produces the data, treating it as an \ninteraction, a conversation like other talk in institutions (Antaki and Rapley 1996; \nMaynard and Schaeffer 1997; Houtkoop-Steenstra 2000; Maynard and Schaeffer 2000; \nMaynard et al. 2002).  This line of critique can indeed be used to improve survey and \nfocus group techniques by making responses more reliable (see for instance the work of \nYuling Pan for the U. S. Bureau of the Census (Pan 2004)). \nBut even analyses aimed at improving existing techniques (such as Houtkoop-\nSteenstra 2000) pose a challenge to the whole idea of public opinion research, by seeing \nopinion not as a unitary entity inside an individual, to be elicited and aggregated, but as \nsomething two or more talkers produce in a particular situation.  For any given statement \nof opinion, we need to ask whom the respondent thinks they are talking to, who they are \ntalking as, why are they saying this just now, how this issue fits in the conversation. \nTraditional public opinion research tells us what the people say;  this line of research is \nequally interested in how they say it.  And in studying how they say it, this research leads \nus to questions about the way people think of themselves and present themselves to \nothers. \nI will present three fragments of public opinion research on one heavily \nresearched topic:  public attitudes to nuclear power and nuclear waste.  The topic is \nheavily researched because it matters both to the public, worried about safety and about \nenergy supplies, and to the industries that build and operate nuclear plants, and need to \nfind ways of persuading the reluctant public (see for instance, the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute at www.nei.org).  My textual examples are from a national survey series (in the \nUS, where there have been surveys asking the same questions over long periods), a single \n5 \nPresser 2003; Bulmer 2004).  Some of the most interesting findings have been on \ncognitive processes studied through think-aloud protocols of respondents answering \nquestions (DeMaio and Rothgeb 1996) or post-questionnaire debriefing (Belson 1981).  \nGraham Low has applied these methodologies to the kind of evaluation questionnaires \noften used in applied linguistics (Low 1996; Low 1999).   \nAs public opinion researchers have noted, people do talk about some public issues \n(though not all such issues) in pubs and at the dinner table and on the bus.  For the \nresearchers, the parallels between everyday conversation and professional survey validate \nthe opinions found, because people are just having the kind of talk that they usually have, \neven if institutional modifications are necessary to produce reliable results (Gallup and \nRae 1940; Schuman 1986).  Public opinion often present the interactional aspects of the \nprocess, such as audience design, multiplicity of interpretations, and indexical meanings, \nas technical problems to be dealt with by testing of the wording of questions and \nstandardisation of interviewer procedures, for instance by changing the order of \nquestions.   \nBut there is an alternative view of the talk involved in the elicitation of opinions.  \nSuchman and Jordan (1990) argue that \u2018interactional troubles\u2019 cannot be so easily \neliminated or set aside as the public opinion researchers would have it.  In the survey \ninterviews they videotaped, features of everyday conversation that are problematic for \nstandardisation of survey questions included: recipient design, signals of what kind of \nanswer is required, establishment of relevance, repair, and clarification of meaning.  \nSchaeffer and Maynard (1996) provide detailed transcripts of how questioners and \nrespondents work out problematic aspects of the questionnaire.  Their work is part of a \n4 \ninteraction involving talk, reading, or writing.  However much we dismiss reports of \nopinions as just opinions, as showing the superficiality and malleability of the public, or \nthe narrowing of public discourse, we are often eager to seize on them when they support \nour own views.  And it could be argued that we are right to seize on such evidence:  some \nsense of the will of the public underpins representative democracy.  The questions for us, \nas linguists and as citizens, are how the signs of opinion are elicited and packaged, and \nwhat differences these processes make. \n Opinion is big business, and it has attracted a great deal of academic and \ncommercial research in political science, sociology, and social policy studies.  Most of \nthis research assumes that opinion is something already out there to be measured, like the \naverage temperature in Antarctica or the number of owls in Oregon.  Academic public \nopinion research examines the instruments, the questionnaires and questions, and the \nways they are analysed, and asks how to make the procedures more reliable. But there is \nanother approach to these processes that does not take the act of giving an opinion for \ngranted, that starts with the interactions of questioners and respondents, and asks what \nopinions are, and how they are transformed between contexts;  it is in this approach that I \nthink linguists (and conversation analysts, rhetoricians, and social psychologists) have \nsomething to offer. \n It is only fair, when criticizing public opinion research, to acknowledge that these \ninstitutions have had some impressive successes in prediction (I will return to one of \nthese later).  It is also fair to note that academic researchers in this area have from the \nvery beginning pointed out possible limitations and distorting factors in surveys \n(Lazarsfeld 1944; Payne 1951; Schuman and Presser 1981; Schuman 1986; Schaeffer and \n3 \nIntroduction \nChristopher Brumfit has defined applied linguistics as \u2018the theoretical and empirical \ninvestigation of real-world problems in which language is a central issue\u2019 (Brumfit 2001: \n169).  In this definition, the scope of the field is much wider that would be suggested by \nthe already broad range of its traditional applications to language learning, education, \nlexicography, and language policy.  It is hard to think of any \u2018real-world\u2019 problems -- \nfrom global warming to refugees to genetic counseling to outsourced call centres to \nAIDS\/HIV to military intelligence \u2013 that do not have a crucial component of language \nuse.    \nOne important area of language practice in real-world problems that has led to an \nenormous amount of social science research activity, but has not attracted much \ninvolvement from linguists, is the work of the commercial, government, and academic \norganizations that I have called institutions of opinion (Myers 2004).  Measures of public \nopinion are used by politicians on one side or the other; constant polling fed back into the \n2004 US Presidential election, and the debates are followed instantly by focus groups \nassessing who won.  Phone-ins fill radio time, and many web pages (such as that of \nCNN) have a QuickVote\u2122 feature allowing anyone to express an opinion on the day\u2019s \ntopic.  The UK Labour Party held a \u2018Big Conversation\u2019 on the future of the country, and \nmy local government conducted a survey on whether the big new road should go to the \nnorth or the west of the city (though they did not follow its outcome).  It is important to \nbe able to challenge institutions that have such an influence on our political lives. \nInstitutions of opinion are based on language practices, because questionnaires, \ninterviews, focus groups, and even web page surveys all have at their basis some kind of \n2 \nApplied Linguists and Institutions of Opinion \n \nAbstract \nPublic opinion research is not an area that has received much attention from applied \nlinguists.  But language lies at the heart of the procedures used to define, elicit, and report \nopinions, whether through such methods as polling, interviews, and focus groups, or \nthrough the less obvious channels of vox pop interviews, letters to the editor, radio \nphone-ins, or public hearings.  In this paper I consider ways in which work in language \nstudies \u2013 by linguists, conversation analysts, and social psychologists \u2013 might help us \nunderstand, improve, or question these procedures, and also give a new perspective on \nwhat opinions are.  The relation of this new perspective to existing knowledge of \nacademic and professional practitioners in the field may have parallels in other \napplications where applied linguists encounter experienced professionals and large \norganisations.  Institutions of opinion feed back into political processes, so it is important \nthat we consider them, not only as researchers and professionals, but also as citizens.  \n1 \nApplied Linguistics special issue:  Applied Linguistic Responses to Real World Problems \n \nApplied Linguists and Institutions of Opinion \n \nGreg Myers \nLinguistics and Modern English Language \nLancaster University Lancaster LA1 4YT \n"}
