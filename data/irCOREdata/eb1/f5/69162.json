Introduction 34 \nSolute acquisition by glacial meltwaters takes place at the bed of glaciers during transit 35 \nthrough distributed and channelised drainage systems (eg. Raiswell, 1984; Tranter et al. 1993, 36 \n1996, 1997). The distributed system pertains to hydrological flowpaths conveying water 37 \nunder high pressure with long residence times and high rock\/water contact ratios. Channelised 38 \ndrainage networks however follow discrete flowpaths, represent low pressure hydrological 39 \nsystems and evacuate large volumes of water rapidly from beneath the glacier. The spatial and 40 \ntemporal evolution between the two systems depends upon the flux of meltwater to the glacier 41 \nbed, whereby high inputs of supraglacial meltwater raise the basal water pressure and 42 \nencourage a spatial re-organisation of the drainage system such that the channelised system 43 \nevolves at the expense of the distributed configuration (e.g. Richards et al. 1996; Nienow et 44 \nal. 1998). Such hydrological forcing of subglacial drainage evolution at predominantly cold, 45 \npolythermal glaciers can be rapid and closely coupled to the dynamics of glacier movement 46 \n(Copland et al. 2003; Nuttall and Hodgkins, 2005; Rippin et al., 2005; Bingham et al. 2006). 47 \nA concomitant change in the hydrochemistry of subglacial runoff accompanies this transition 48 \nand can be manifest as a rapid switch in the chemical properties of the melt water (Copland et 49 \nal. 2003; Wynn et al. 2006). Due to extensive rock\/water contact and weathering reactions, 50 \nhigh pressure distributed drainage configurations encourage high total dissolved ion loads and 51 \nlow concentrations of atmospheric gases in solution. However, during the hydrological 52 \nevolution of the subglacial drainage system, the development of channelised flow paths 53 \nconveying large volumes of meltwater subjected to only limited rock\/water contact means that 54 \nwaters are more dilute and dissolved gases in solution exceed the capacity of oxygen 55 \nconsuming reactions at the glacier bed (e.g. Tranter et al, 2002). However, since the presence 56 \nof microbiological activity within ice and subglacial sediments is now widely acknowledged 57 \n(Bhatia et al. 2006; Foght et al. 2004; Mader et al. 2006; Sharp et al. 1999, Skidmore et al. 58 \n2000; Tranter et al. 2005; Welker et al. 2002), researchers are increasingly aware that 59 \nacquisition of solute in sediments at distance from such channels may be effectively 60 \ndecoupled from inorganic controls of gas supply and rock\/water contact ratios. Atmospheric 61 \ngas supplies thus become depleted in the distributed drainage system, and so the use of 62 \nalternative oxidising agents by microbial populations is required to drive further solute 63 \nacquisition under anoxic conditions (Bottrell and Tranter, 2002; Wadham et al. 2004; Wynn 64 \net al. 2006). Despite this increased understanding, the degree to which such biotic solute 65 \nacquisition is governed by the evolution of the subglacial hydrological system remains largely 66 \nunknown (Tranter et al. 2005; Wynn et al. 2006; Hodson et al. In Press). 67 \n 68 \nThe NO3\n-\n ion represents one of the more readily available electron donors under reducing 69 \nconditions, and so should be highly sensitive to the redox evolution of the subglacial 70 \nhydrological system (Tranter et al. 1994; Wynn et al. 2006; Hodson et al. In Press). Thus, 71 \nduring the early stages of summer ablation, subglacial meltwater in the distributed drainage 72 \nconfiguration includes pockets of local anoxia that are characterised by nitrogen isotopic 73 \nvalues that are diagnostic of microbial denitrification (Wynn et al. 2006). However, later in 74 \nthe summer, when most meltwaters are conveyed through the aerated low pressure 75 \nchannelised system, concentrations of nitrate and NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios in the subglacial meltwaters 76 \nincrease significantly, implying the presence of an additional source of nitrate to the 77 \nsubglacial drainage system. Hodson et al. (2005a) and Hodson (2006), show that some form 78 \nof NO3\n-\n production must take place, because annual NO3\n- \nyields exceed inputs in a number of 79 \nglacial environments, (including Midtre Lov\u00e9nbreen).  Such \u201cexcess NO3\n-\n\u201d is also implicit in 80 \nmeltwater hydrochemical studies of temperate glacier basins in the European Alps (Tockner 81 \net al. 2002) and cold-based glaciers of the maritime Antarctic (Caulkett and Ellis-Evans, 82 \n1997; Hodson, 2006) although its precise source has yet to be identified. 83 \n  84 \nAn appreciation of the manner in which glaciers regulate the biogeochemical cycling of 85 \nnutrients and thereby impact upon the productivity of neighbouring freshwater and marine 86 \necosystems demands a better understanding of the non-conservative behaviour of nitrogen 87 \nand other nutrients in glacial environments on a sub-annual basis. Here, we build upon earlier 88 \nannual mass balance studies of nitrogen and trace the provenance and dynamics of \u2018excess\u2019 89 \nNO3\n-\n production in the subglacial environment of a high Arctic glacier at a seasonal time 90 \nscale. In so doing, major ion chemistry (NO3\n-\n, NH4\n+\n and Cl\n-\n) and environmental isotopes of 91 \n\u03b4\n15\nNNO3, \u03b4\n18\nONO3 and \u03b4\n15\nNNH4 in pre-melt snow, meltwater, organic matter and whole rock 92 \nsamples are presented from Midtre Lov\u00e9nbreen, Svalbard. 93 \n 94 \n2. Methodology 95 \n2.1. Field site and sampling 96 \nMidtre Lov\u00e9nbreen is a high Arctic polythermal glacier situated on the Br\u00f8ggerhalv\u00f8ya 97 \npeninsula in North West Spitsbergen (78.53\u00baN and 12.04\u00baE). The geology of the peninsula 98 \nincludes basement rocks belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper Proterozoic that are 99 \nsituated beneath the glacier and predominantly composed of phyllites and beds of quartzite 100 \n(Hjelle, 1993). To the south of the phyllites are more strongly metamorphosed rocks that 101 \ninclude mica schists and beds of marble beneath the accumulation area of the glacier (Hjelle, 102 \n1993).  103 \nThe glacier is up to 180m thick and two thirds of the ice is at the pressure melting point, 104 \nthereby supporting an extensive subglacial drainage system (Rippin et al. 2003). Bulk 105 \nmeltwater runoff is conveyed towards the adjacent fjord of Kongsfjorden via two main 106 \nproglacial melt channels draining the lateral margins of the glacier (Hodson et al. 2005b) 107 \n(Figure 1). Meltwater accesses the bed of the glacier via moulins in the accumulation area, 108 \nlater emerging as a pressurised subglacial upwelling (MLSG) at the terminus of the glacier 109 \n(Irvine-Fynn et al. 2005) (Figure 1), the dynamics of which are described by Rippin et al. 110 \n(2003) and Hodson et al. (2005a). Since subglacial meltwaters are characteristically sub-oxic 111 \nearly in the ablation season, but well aerated thereafter, we have separated our observation 112 \nperiods accordingly (see Wynn et al. 2006). Hereafter, early (sub-oxic) and later (oxic) 113 \nsubglacial runoff will be referred to as the \u201cinitial\u201d and \u201cprincipal\u201d runoff phases respectively, 114 \nreflecting the relative importance of the runoff fluxes associated with each period. During 115 \nsummer 2002, samples of subglacial runoff were collected directly from the upwelling, 116 \nalthough during summer 2003, the upwelling changed location during the melt season causing 117 \na small supraglacial stream to enter the subglacial runoff before sampling was possible, thus 118 \nconfounding direct geochemical characterisation (Figure 1 and Table 1). Major ion 119 \ncharacterisation and data sourced from gauging stations installed on the two major bulk 120 \nmeltwater channels draining the proglacial zone during 2002 (namely MLE and MLW, Table 121 \n1, Figure 1) are presented and discussed with regard to the impact subglacial processes may 122 \nhave on the total runoff and solute budgets from the entire catchment.  Meltwater samples 123 \nhave been collected at these stream sites for major ion characterisation as part of an ongoing 124 \nmonitoring programme that began in 1997 (Hodson et al. 2000; 2004; 2005a). On the glacier 125 \nsurface, snowpack samples were collected using a depth-integrating 0.5 litre PVC tube 126 \n(Hodson et al. 2005a). Lysimeters of a similar design to those described in Hodson (2006), 127 \nwere inserted into the base of the snowpack during summer 2003 to document the 128 \nhydrochemistry during snowpack ablation and major ion samples collected from one of the 129 \nmain supraglacial streams during 2003 (Figure 1) enabled solute characterisation of bulk 130 \nsupraglacial discharge.   131 \n 132 \nAll meltwater samples for major ion composition were filtered immediately in the field using 133 \na handheld Nalgene vacuum unit and 0.45\u00b5m cellulose nitrate filters to prevent further 134 \nreaction with suspended sediment. Filters were pre-rinsed in the field using aliquots of sample 135 \nwater and field blanks have failed to indicate any potential contamination. Samples were 136 \nstored airtight in pre-rinsed 60ml polyethylene Nalgene bottles (pre-rinsed with filtered 137 \nsample water) and refrigerated to await further analysis. Snow samples were treated in the 138 \nsame manner as runoff samples after being melted in a 25 \no\nC water bath (see Hodson et al. 139 \n2005a). 140 \n 141 \nDuring 2002 and 2003 our geochemical sampling campaign was augmented by the 142 \ndetermination of stable isotope ratios of \n15\nN\/\n14\nN and \n18\nO\/\n16\nO in NO3\n-\n and \n15\nN\/\n14\nN in NH4\n+\n. 143 \nFor the snowpack this involved collecting a c. 60 kg section of snow down to the glacier ice 144 \nsurface, in polyethylene bags, and for aqueous samples the collection of 20-40 L samples in 145 \npolyethylene jerry cans. Details of sample processing are reported elsewhere (Wynn, 2004; 146 \nHeaton et al. 2004; Wynn et al. 2006). The \n15\nN\/\n14\nN ratios of glacial till and fresh bedrock 147 \nwere determined on material from the glacier forefield. In the case of the glacial till, samples 148 \nwere collected from the immediate ice margin, representing young, former subglacial tills that 149 \nhave been exposed by the glacier\u2019s recent retreat. The rock samples included metamorphic 150 \nbasement rocks from the glacier\u2019s upper accumulation area (phyllite, schist, sandstones and 151 \nquartzite) and younger sequences (chert) outcropping in the proximal parts of the glacier 152 \nforefield. 153 \n 154 \nOrganic matter present within small melt pools known as cryoconite holes on the glacier 155 \nsurface was collected during summer 2002 and 2003 from three locations on the glacier 156 \nsurface and air-dried prior to analysis back in the UK. 157 \n 158 \n2.2. Laboratory analysis 159 \nAnions of chloride and nitrate were determined using a Dionex DX100 ion chromatograph 160 \nand soluble ammonium was analysed using a FOSS-Tecator FIAstar 5000 flow injection 161 \nanalyser. Based on repeat analysis of reference standard materials of comparable 162 \nconcentration to the samples being analysed, precision was calculated as 3.57, 1.16 and 2.54% 163 \nRSD (relative standard deviation) for chloride, nitrate and ammonium respectively. 164 \n 165 \nSnow, supraglacial and subglacial meltwaters collected for isotopic analysis were gravity-fed 166 \nthrough cation and anion exchange resins, with nitrate processed to silver nitrate (Chang et al. 167 \n1999; Hwang et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2000; Heaton et al. 2004) and ammonium processed to 168 \nammonium sulphate (Sigman et al. 1997; Heaton, 2001). 169 \n 170 \n2.3. Mass spectrometric analysis 171 \nProduct silver nitrate, ammonium sulphate and cryoconite organic matter was analysed using 172 \nThermoFinnigan elemental analysers linked to a Delta + XL continuous flow mass 173 \nspectrometer. Reductive pyrolysis of silver nitrate at 1400\u00b0C yielded CO and N2 for 174 \ndetermination of \n18\nO\/\n16\nO and N\/O ratios, and oxidative combustion of silver nitrate, 175 \nammonium sulphate or organic matter at 900\u00b0C yielded N2 and CO2 for determination of 176 \n15\nN\/\n14\nN and C\/N ratios. Yield of N2 from organic matter samples was determined by 177 \ncomparison of sample peak area with those from known weights of acetanilide. Ratios were 178 \nconverted to \u03b4\n18\nO values versus VSMOW: 179 \n 180 \n\u03b4\n18\nOsample, in \u2030 = {[(\n18\nO\/\n16\nO)sample \/ (\n18\nO\/\n16\nO)VSMOW)] \u20131} x 1000   1) 181 \n 182 \nand \u03b4\n15\nN values versus atmospheric N2: 183 \n 184 \n\u03b4\n15\nNsample, in \u2030 = {[(\n15\nN\/\n14\nN)sample \/ (\n15\nN\/\n14\nN)atmos)] \u20131} x 1000   2) 185 \n 186 \nby comparison with within-run laboratory standards calibrated against IAEA-N3 (\u03b4\n18\nO value 187 \n= +25.6 \u2030 versus VSMOW (IAEA, 2004)), or against IAEA-N1 (\u03b4\n15\nN value = +0.4 \u2030 188 \nversus atmos. N2 (IAEA, 2004)). Precision on replicates of within-run laboratory standards 189 \nwas typically better than \u00b10.7\u2030 for \u03b4\n18\nO and \u00b10.3\u2030 for \u03b4\n15\nN (1 SD). 190 \n 191 \n2.4. Correction of \u03b4\n18\nONO3 for organic matter 192 \nIf \u03b4\n15\nN and \u03b4\n18\nO values of nitrate are to be used as indicators of provenance, the silver nitrate 193 \nsamples must be pure, i.e. free from any potential N- or O-bearing contaminants (Kendal, 194 \n1998; Haberhauer and Blochberger, 1999; Heaton et al. 2004). We found this to be a major 195 \nproblem in the case of contamination derived from dissolved organics in low ionic strength 196 \nsamples from the glacier surface during the first field campaign (2002). The amount of 197 \ncontaminant organic matter in the final silver nitrate was reduced, but not eliminated by use of 198 \nISOLUTE\n\u00ae\n Env\n+\n resin during sample preparation. Analysis of this organic matter, eluted 199 \nfrom the Env\n+\n resins with methanol and dichloromethane, failed to detect significant amounts 200 \nof nitrogen, but indicated large proportions of oxygen with average \u03b4\n18\nO values of +22\u2030 (1 201 \nSD = 2.4, n = 16). During the 2003 field campaign, Amberlite\n\u00ae \nXAD-7 and ISOLUTE\n\u00ae\n Env\n+ \n202 \nresins were placed upstream of the cation and anion exchange resins during sample 203 \nconcentration, thereby screening the ion exchange resins from extensive organic matter 204 \ncontamination. 205 \nThe fractional contribution of organic contaminant oxygen to the total oxygen in an impure 206 \nsilver nitrate sample, forganic, may be calculated from the sample\u2019s measured atomic N\/O ratio 207 \n((N\/O)measured), assuming pure nitrate has a ratio of 0.33 and the organic contaminant a ratio of 208 \n0: 209 \n 210 \n forganic = 1 \u2013 [(N\/O)measured\/0.33]       3) 211 \n 212 \nIf forganic has a \u03b4\n18\nO value of +22 \u2030, then the isotopic composition of the pure nitrate, \u03b4\n18\nONO3, 213 \nmay be calculated from that of the measured impure silver nitrate sample, \u03b4\n18\nOmeasured, from: 214 \n 215 \n \u03b4\n18\nONO3 = (\u03b4\n18\nOmeasured - forganic\u00b722) \/ (1 - forganic)     4) 216 \n 217 \nAll \u03b4\n18\nO-nitrate signatures quoted in the remainder of this paper represent values corrected for 218 \norganic oxygen in the above manner. Obviously we cannot be totally certain that the \u03b4\n18\nO 219 \nvalue of the organic matter recovered from the Env\n+\n resin is identical to the value for the 220 \norganic matter contaminating the sample. However, the values we measured are within the 221 \ndefined range for organic oxygen and we believe that any differences which do occur will be 222 \nsmall enough not to have a significant effect on the correction procedure. 223 \n  224 \n2.5. Geologic nitrogen analysis 225 \nThe term \u2018geologic nitrogen\u2019 is taken to represent nitrogen located within the surrounding 226 \nbedrock (Holloway et al. 1998; 1999; Holloway and Dahlgren, 2002). In sedimentary rocks 227 \nsuch \u2018geologic nitrogen\u2019 is derived predominantly from decomposed organic matter which 228 \nthermally degrades during diagenesis and substitutes for potassium in minerals such as illite, 229 \nmuscovite, biotite, and feldspars, forming fixed ammonium in metamorphic and igneous 230 \nrocks (Mingram and Brauer, 1998). The total nitrogen content of whole rock samples was 231 \ntherefore determined using a Hydrofluoric acid \/ sulphuric acid digest (Honma and Itihara, 232 \n1981; Haendel et al. 1986). Precise experimental procedures followed were adapted from 233 \nBradley (1992) and resultant ammonium\/sulphuric acid solution was processed to ammonium 234 \nsulphate by ammonium diffusion (Sigman et al. 1997; Heaton, 2001) and analysed for \u03b4\n15\nN. 235 \nMeasurement precision based on replicates of standards was typically better than \u00b10.3\u2030 for 236 \n\u03b4\n15\nN (1 S.D) whilst experimental precision based on the repeat analysis of rock samples was 237 \n<2\u2030 (1 S.D). Yield of N2 was determined by comparison of sample peak area with those of 238 \nknown weights of acetanilide and blank contamination from the combined digest and 239 \nammonium diffusion procedure was calculated as 2.5\u00b5g N per analysis (n=12, 1 S.D = 0.75). 240 \n 241 \n3. Results 242 \nFigure 2 depicts the bulk hydrochemical outputs from the glacier catchment in major 243 \nproglacial streams (MLE and MLW) and the subglacial runoff (MLSG) during the 2002 244 \nobservation period. Time series of discharge, Cl\n-\n and NO3\n-\n show the typical early season 245 \ndevelopment of the hydrological system from a period dominated by snowmelt to one of 246 \nicemelt, supplemented by the release of subglacial water. Data from 2003 are not shown 247 \nbecause the position of the subglacial upwelling changed during the season, leading to 248 \ncomplex time series. 249 \n 250 \nTable 2 shows summary statistics of the ionic and isotopic composition of NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+ \nin 251 \npre-melt snow, snowmelt, supraglacial runoff and subglacial runoff during initial and 252 \nprincipal flow phases. The sharp boundary between the initial and principal flow phases 253 \noccurred just prior to sample collection on DOYs 184 and 193 during 2002 and 2003 254 \nrespectively and is described in detail by Wynn et al. (2006). 255 \n 256 \nDuring 2002, average NO3\n-\n concentrations in pre-melt snow, were 1.6\u00b5M. Concentrations of 257 \nNO3\n-\n in the subglacial waters of the principal runoff phase increased markedly to ca. 4 \u00b5M 258 \nand represent concentrations much greater than those observed during the initial runoff phase 259 \n(average 1.12 \u00b5M). During 2003, a strong elution phase produced very high average NO3\n- \n260 \nconcentrations in snowmelt relative to the pre-melt snowpack. However, concentrations of 261 \nNO3\n-\n were still greater in subglacial runoff of the principal runoff phase than the initial runoff 262 \nphase, although the effect was smaller than in 2002.  263 \n 264 \nAverage NH4\n+ \nconcentrations were greatest in the pre-melt snowpack and snowmelt, 265 \nespecially in 2003, (5.1 and 4.6 \u00b5M respectively), but lower in supraglacial streams (2.0 \u00b5M 266 \nin 2003), and subglacial runoff (0.17 \u00b5M at first, then 0.13 \u00b5M). In direct contrast to NO3\n-\n, 267 \naverage NH4\n+\n concentrations were lowest in subglacial runoff during the principal runoff 268 \nphase (Table 2). Table 2 also shows NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios for all sample types and mean \u03b4\n15\nN and 269 \n\u03b4\n18\nO values for NO3\n-\n in pre-melt snow, supraglacial runoff and subglacial meltwater. The 270 \nNO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios were 0.015 in the pre-melt snowpack during 2002, whilst subglacial waters 271 \nshowed average ratios that were lower during the initial flow phase (ca. 0.009), and markedly 272 \nhigher during the principal runoff phase (0.038). During 2003, NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios in the 273 \nsubglacial runoff during the initial runoff phase (NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n = 0.028) were similar to those 274 \nreported in supraglacial samples, although higher ratios did appear during the principal runoff 275 \nphase (NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n = 0.056). Therefore NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios in subglacial runoff show a clear tendency 276 \nto increase across the boundary of the initial and principal flow phases. 277 \n  278 \nThe isotope values in Table 2 and depicted in Figures 3 and 4 show significant differences 279 \nbetween sample types. Nitrate in pre-melt snow has low \u03b4\n15\nN values (-9.9 \u2030 and -9.8 \u2030 for 280 \nsummer 2002 and 2003 respectively) and high \u03b4\n18\nO values (+57 \u2030 to +72 \u2030); the subglacial 281 \nwaters of the principal runoff phase have higher \u03b4\n15\nN (-5.5 \u2030 to \u20134.5 \u2030) and lower \u03b4\n18\nO 282 \n(+20 \u2030), whilst subglacial waters during the initial flow phase have the highest \u03b4\n15\nN values 283 \n(+2.3 \u2030 to +4.0 \u2030) (Figures 3 and 4). For ammonium there was no clear distinction between 284 \ndifferent samples, with all \u03b4\n15\nN values in the range of \u20136 \u2030 to \u20132 \u2030. 285 \n 286 \nGeologic nitrogen concentrations and \u03b4\n15\nN signatures for rocks collected from the catchment 287 \nare given in Table 3. Concentrations of nitrogen were greatest in the phyllite, a major rock 288 \ntype in the subglacial system, and pyritic chert, which lies amongst the chert sequences 289 \nbeneath the lower ablation area of the glacier and its forefield. Phyllite and chert also 290 \ndemonstrated the highest organic carbon contents (0.11 to 0.29 %). With the exception of the 291 \nlow \u03b4\n15\nN value for the pyritic chert, which is a minor component of the chert, all other rock 292 \ntypes had \u03b4\n15\nN in the range +4.8 \u2030 to +7.7 \u2030. 293 \n  294 \nTable 4 shows the \u03b4\n15\nN signature, N content and C\/N ratio of the cryoconite organic matter 295 \nsampled during the two field campaigns. Nitrogen contents are at least an order of magnitude 296 \ngreater than those recovered in the rock samples owing to the abundance of micro-algae, 297 \nbacteria, viruses and a number of other microorganisms in these active microbial habitats 298 \n(S\u00e4wstr\u00f6m et al. 2002). 299 \n 300 \n4. Discussion 301 \n4.1. Hydrochemical regime 302 \nThe hydrochemical regime of Midtre Lov\u00e9nbreen during the 2002 summer melt season is 303 \ndepicted in Figure 2. A steady increase in discharge in both the bulk meltwater proglacial 304 \nstreams began when the glacier was completely snow covered on DOY 168. At MLE, 305 \ndischarge continued to rise after DOY 182 due to the subglacial outburst, whilst discharge 306 \ndriven principally by icemelt stabilised at MLW. By the end of the observation period shown 307 \nin Figure 2, icemelt was dominating runoff production across the entire glacier, although 308 \nsnowmelt continued to emerge from the subglacial upwelling due to runoff from the 309 \naccumulation area entering the subglacial drainage system through stable crevasses and 310 \nmoulins at approximately 400m altitude (Irvine-Fynn et al. 2005). The persistent input of 311 \nsnowmelt is indicated by the high Cl\n-\n in waters marked MLSG in Figure 2, whilst more dilute 312 \nCl\n-\n concentrations rapidly appear at MLE and MLW when icemelt dominates runoff delivery 313 \nto other flowpaths (i.e. supraglacial streams and lateral channels: cf Tranter et al. 1996). The 314 \ndecline in Cl\n-\n concentrations at MLE and MLW therefore reflects this dilution. However, they 315 \nalso reflect the elution mechanism that removes solute rapidly from the snowpack, which 316 \nexplains why Cl\n-\n concentrations also gradually decline in the subglacial runoff (Tranter et al. 317 \n1996; Wadham et al. 1998). This elution process also appears to have governed changes in 318 \nNO3\n-\n in the proglacial rivers, because these too show a significant decline prior to the 319 \nemergence of subglacial runoff. Concentrations of NO3\n-\n then increase disproportionately 320 \ncompared to Cl\n-\n in the MLE stream two days after the emergence of the subglacial runoff. 321 \nThe two day delay in increasing NO3\n-\n concentrations was likely caused by the displacement of 322 \n\u201cold\u201d subglacial water during the initial flow phase. This component of the subglacial runoff 323 \nwas depleted in both oxygen and NO3\n- \nprior to the transition to the principal runoff phase 324 \n(Wynn et al. 2006). 325 \n 326 \nLater in the principal runoff phase, the subglacial drainage system developed an efficient, 327 \nchannelised configuration that conveyed runoff with residence times of just 2-4 hours 328 \nfollowing descent into moulins in the uppermost part of the glacier (Irvine-Fynn et al. 2005). 329 \nDuring this phase, runoff via the subglacial upwelling increased to ca. 25 \u2013 33 % of the total 330 \ncatchment runoff (Hodson et al. 2005b). Intuitively, one would therefore expect the 331 \nproportion of atmospheric-derived NO3\n-\n (i.e. snow pack NO3\n-\n) transported by the subglacial 332 \nriver to dominate during this period. However, the following characteristics confound this 333 \ninterpretation and require an alternative explanation: 334 \n1) High NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios and NO3\n-\n concentrations develop in subglacial runoff relative to 335 \nall other streams flowing at the same time and to subglacial runoff during the initial 336 \nflow phase earlier in the summer (Figure 2, Table 3); 337 \n2) At the same time, the subglacial runoff nitrate displays higher \u03b4\n15\nN values and lower 338 \n\u03b4\n18\nO values than the snowpack and supraglacial streams. 339 \n 340 \nWaters from the initial flow phase, when subglacial runoff is dominated via delayed flow 341 \npathways, have lower NO3\n-\n concentrations and NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios due to denitrification (Wynn et 342 \nal. 2006). Thus their mixing with surface-derived meltwaters would reduce the NO3\n-\n levels of 343 \nsubglacial runoff relative to surface melt waters \u2013 which is opposite to the observed pattern 344 \n(Table 2). An alternative source of NO3\n-\n, with higher \u03b4\n15\nN and lower \u03b4\n18\nO values than those 345 \nof the surface runoff, must be added to these supraglacial meltwaters during their passage 346 \nthrough the glacier.  347 \n 348 \n4.2. Nitrification as a mechanism for additional NO3\n-\n production 349 \nNitrification has been invoked as a source of NO3\n-\n in a number of glacial and periglacial 350 \nenvironments without actually being observed directly. For example, very significant excess 351 \nNO3\n-\n production in two cold-based glacier basins has been proposed by Hodson et al. (2005a) 352 \nand Hodson (2006). Further, studies of talus waters within rock glaciers have identified high 353 \nNO3\n-\n waters that are also thought to betray bacterial activity and nitrification (Bieber et al. 354 \n1998). However, two studies have failed to stimulate nitrification in supraglacial snowpacks 355 \namended with NH4\n+\n (Williams et al. 1996; Wynn, Unpublished Data), suggesting that the 356 \nprocess takes place in alternative environments. The possibility that nitrification takes place at 357 \nthe bed of Midtre Lov\u00e9nbreen is therefore considered below using \u03b4\n18\nONO3- data from 2003.  358 \n 359 \nThe microbial nitrification of ammonia utilises both H2O and O2 as the source of oxygen 360 \nduring the production of NO3\n-\n. On the basis that two thirds of the oxygen molecules are 361 \nsourced from H2O and the remainder obtained from atmospheric O2 (Kumar et al. 1983; 362 \nAnderson and Hooper, 1983), it has been proposed that the expected \u03b4\n18\nO value for 363 \nmicrobially-produced nitrate can be calculated (Equation 5) (eg. Amberger and Schmidt, 364 \n1987; Kendall, 1998; Mayer et al. 2001). 365 \n 366 \n\u03b4\n18\nONO3 = (0.33 \u00d7 \u03b4\n18\nOAir) + (0.66 \u00d7 \u03b4\n18\nOwater)      (5) 367 \n 368 \nAs the average \u03b4\n18\nOwater value of the subglacial discharge during the principal flow phase was 369 \n-12.3\u2030 (Table 2), and assuming \u03b4\n18\nOAir = +23.7 \u2030 (value for atmospheric O2; Horibe, et al. 370 \n1973), the theoretically expected \u03b4\n18\nONO3 value for microbially produced nitrate is -0.3 \u2030. 371 \nTaking an average \u03b4\n18\nONO3 value for snow to be +64 \u2030, a mixture of 68 % microbial nitrate 372 \nplus 32 % snowmelt nitrate would produce the \u03b4\n18\nONO3 value of +20.3 \u2030, similar to the value 373 \nfor NO3\n-\n observed in the 2003 principal subglacial runoff phase (20.3 \u2030 \u00b1 6.1 \u2030 (1 S.D)). As 374 \nthere is no isotopic evidence for the presence of microbially mediated nitrate in the lysimeter 375 \nmelt waters and supraglacial streams (average \u03b4\n18\nONO3 = +63.8 \u2030), these data therefore imply 376 \nthat microbial nitrification must be occurring within or at the bed of the glacier, accounting 377 \nfor much of the nitrate present in subglacial runoff during the principal runoff phase. Using 378 \nthese same proportions for nitrate from snow and microbial sources, we can then estimate the 379 \n\u03b4\n15\nNNO3 value of the microbial nitrate. Thus, if the subglacial nitrate outflow during the 380 \nprincipal runoff phase, (\u03b4\n15\nNNO3 value = \u20135.5 \u2030 in 2003: Table 2) was made up of 32 % 381 \nsnowmelt nitrate with a \u03b4\n15\nNNO3 value between -9.8 \u2030 and \u20137.8 \u2030 (range for snow and 382 \nsupraglacial waters), then the 68 % of nitrate sourced from microbial activity in the 2003 383 \nsubglacial runoff would have had a \u03b4\n15\nNNO3 value of \u20134.4 \u2030 to \u20133.5 \u2030. 384 \n 385 \n4.3. Potential NH4\n+\n sources for nitrification 386 \nGiven the above, the following potential sources of nitrogen might be driving a nitrification 387 \nprocess:  388 \n1) NH4\n+\n from snowpack and glacier ice;  389 \n2) Rock-derived NH4\n+\n liberated following dissolution reactions; and  390 \n3) Biologically-derived NH4\n+\n produced following mineralisation of organic N.  391 \n 392 \nGiven that the NH4\n+\n abundance in this glacial environment is low (Table 2), a negligible 393 \nfractionation effect is likely during the nitrification process (Fogel and Ciffuentes, 1993; 394 \nKendall, 1998; Heaton, 1986). We would therefore expect the \u03b4\n15\nNNH4+ value of the 395 \nammonium to be very similar to the average product \u03b4\n15\nNNO3- of\n \nca. \u20134.4 \u2030 to \u20133.5 \u2030. 396 \nSnowpack NH4\n+ \nhas already been constrained by our measurements (\u03b4\n15\nNNH4+\n \nof -1.7 \u2030 + 1.6 397 \n\u2030 in 2002 to -2.8 \u2030 in 2003: Table 2) and appears slightly higher than what is required if the 398 \nNO3\n-\n were derived from nitrification of this source. Bulk snowmelt \u03b4\n15\nNNH4 values sampled 399 \nfrom the lysimeters were lower than the snowpack composition (\u03b4\n15\nNNH4+\n \nof -5.2 \u2030 during 400 \nsummer 2003) and thus closer to the principal phase subglacial runoff \u03b4\n15\nNNO3- and \u03b4\n15\nNNH4+ 401 \nvalues observed during summer 2003. The difference between the high parent snowpack 402 \n\u03b4\n15\nNNH4+ value and the low lysimeter and supraglacial stream runoff values is unclear. 403 \nHowever, it is also uncertain on account of just one snowpack sample being available for 404 \n2003. We therefore believe that the larger data sets used to constrain the isotopic composition 405 \nof snowmelt in the lysimeters (n = 8) and mixtures of snowmelt and supraglacial streams (n = 406 \n6) provide the best indication of surface inputs to the subglacial drainage system during the 407 \nprincipal runoff phase.  408 \n 409 \nIn contrast to the supraglacial samples described above, rock \u03b4\n15\nN values were far higher than 410 \nthe snowpack and stream samples, being +7.2 \u2030 for phyllite, the most dominant N-containing 411 \nrock type beneath the glacier, and +7.7 \u2030 for subglacial till. It therefore appears that the 412 \nnitrification of ammonia within crushed rock and glacial till beneath the glacier is unlikely to 413 \nfurnish a product \u03b4\n15\nNNO3- composition of\n \nca. \u20134.4 \u2030 to \u20133.5 \u2030 unless there are very 414 \nsignificant fractionation effects during the mineral dissolution process. Presently there are no 415 \ndata with which to assess the magnitude of such effects.    416 \n During the overall conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrate, mineralization represents the rate 417 \ndetermining step when the size of the ammonium substrate pool is small (Equation 6) 418 \n(Heaton, 1986).  419 \n 420 \nOrganic-N \u2192 NH4\n+ \n\u2192 NO2\n-\n \u2192 NO3\n- \n       6) 421 \nmineralisation nitrification \n422 \n 423 \nUnder these conditions, we would again expect the nitrate formed from the mineralization and 424 \nnitrification of organic N to have a \u03b4\n15\nN-value very similar to that of the source organic 425 \nmatter. Organic material lies upon the glacier surface in cryoconite holes, characterised by an 426 \norganic N content of 1 to 2 mg\/g and C\/N ratios (10.6 to 11.7) typical of microbial matter 427 \n(Takeuchi et al, 2002). Importantly, since cryoconite holes cover up to 6% of the glacier 428 \nsurface (Hodson et al. 2005a) they offer much potential for ammonia assimilation into the 429 \norganic phase and subsequent mineralisation. Further, the \n15\nN values observed for organic 430 \nmatter (-3 to -5 \u2030) (Table 4) lie closer to the inferred product \u03b4\n15\nNNO3- range of  \u20134.4 \u2030 to \u2013431 \n3.5 \u2030 than any of the other potential sources (ie other pathways of nitrification from surface 432 \nmelt and rocks).The mineralization of surface derived microbial organic matter transported to 433 \nthe glacier bed may thus provide a reliable source of NH4\n+\n for nitrification in addition to the 434 \nNH4\n+\n contained within snow melt and supraglacial runoff. However, since their isotopic 435 \ncompositions are very similar, no further distinctions can be made using isotopic data and we 436 \ninstead use time series of NO3\n-\n production inferred from our ionic data. 437 \n 438 \n4.4. Temporal dynamics of NO3\n-\n production and NH4\n+\n loss 439 \nOur observations suggest that nitrification of NH4\n+\n in the glacial catchment is significant 440 \nfollowing the onset of snowmelt, a finding that is commensurate with the ammonia loss 441 \nidentified in catchment-scale annual mass balances presented by Hodson et al. (2005a) and 442 \nWynn (2004). Here we use the 2002 major ion data set to establish the seasonal (sub-annual) 443 \ndynamics of NO3\n-\n production and NH4\n+\n loss in proglacial streamflow. The terms \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n 444 \nand \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n are defined in the following manner: 445 \n \n446 \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n = \ntotal\nNO3\n- \n- (0.021Cl\n-\n)        7) 447 \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n = \ntotal\nNH4\n+\n- (0.014Cl\n-\n)        8)448 \n       449 \nThe constants 0.021 and 0.014 represent the average NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n and NH4\n+\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios respectively 450 \n(in \u00b5M) in 2002 lysimeter melt waters, and thus enable removal of snowmelt NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+\n 451 \nunder the assumption that Cl\n-\n is a conservative tracer of snowmelt. We used the lysimeter 452 \ndata, rather than bulk snowpack data, because the number of pre-melt snow samples was too 453 \nsmall (see Table 2) and because the ratios could then be estimated using a wide range of 454 \nsolute concentrations similar to those observed in the streams. Our ratios were not influenced 455 \nby preferential elution effects, because time series of NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios in supraglacial streams 456 \ndo not indicate that the process occurs on the glacier surface. 457 \n 458 \nFigure 5 shows time series of the \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n and \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n at MLE, MLW and in the initial and 459 \nprincipal phases of subglacial runoff during 2002. Concentrations of dissolved Si are also 460 \nshown to indicate the presence of waters from high rock-water contact environments (no Si 461 \ncould be detected in snowmelt). Prior to DOY 173 streamflow was dominated by runoff from 462 \nthe glacier forefield and margins. During this time \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n was negative at MLW and 463 \ncoincident with high dissolved silica concentrations suggesting meltwater passage through 464 \nlow redox environments conducive to denitrification in the proglacial sediments. Subsequent 465 \nto DOY 173, \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n values remained remain close to zero for the remainder of the ablation 466 \nseason at MLW, thereby providing no evidence of NO3\n-\n production in the western parts of the 467 \nglacier, its margins and forefield during 2002. In contrast, significant \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n levels at MLE 468 \nwere co-incident with the emergence of subglacial meltwaters on DOY 184, indicating a 469 \nmajor input of NO3\n-\n that cannot be accounted for by the delayed release of concentrated 470 \nsnowpack waters. The first fractions of subglacial outflow during the initial flow phase 471 \ncarried a distinct signature of negative \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n associated with denitrification (see Wynn et 472 \nal. 2006). Maximum \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n occurred on DOY 187 and for the rest of the monitoring period 473 \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n concentrations remain stable, as do dissolved silica levels. Subglacial runoff is 474 \ntherefore responsible for all \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n in the stream at MLE, as \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n concentrations here 475 \nwere negligible prior to DOY 184. 476 \n 477 \nFigure 5 also shows that the \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n was greatest at the start of the ablation period, 478 \nimplying that catchment-wide loss of ammonium is greatest when the snowpack is isothermal 479 \nand begins to produce runoff. The \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n was identical at MLE and MLW prior to DOY 480 \n184, suggesting rates of ammonium loss might be uniform across the catchment during the 481 \nearly ablation period. However, the release of subglacial runoff on DOY 184 (the start of the 482 \nprincipal flow phase) coincided with the release of very NH4\n+\n-deficient runoff from beneath 483 \nthe glacier, suggesting snowpack-derived NH4\n+\n is very likely to  undergo nitrification within 484 \nthe subglacial environment. 485 \n 486 \nTable 5 shows estimates of Cl\n-\n, NH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n, \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n and\n deficit\nNH4\n+\n mass fluxes for the main 487 \nrivers shown in Figure 1. The fluxes have been estimated from the product of daily discharge 488 \nand concentration pairs, using linear interpolation to fill any gaps in the latter series. These 489 \ndata show that for subglacial runoff, NO3\n-\n production (i.e. the \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n flux) exceeded NH4\n+\n 490 \nloss (the \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n flux) during 2002. These mass balance calculations therefore suggest that 491 \nthe nitrification of snow and icemelt NH4\n+\n only explained 83 % of the excess NO3\n-\n, 492 \nsuggesting that an additional substrate for \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n production within the subglacial 493 \nenvironment must also exist. Isotope data suggest the mineralisation of surface-derived 494 \norganic matter is the most likely source. However, when all rivers are considered, the mass 495 \nbalance calculations show that  the \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n flux exceeds \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n at the catchment scale. 496 \nThus it is very likely that ammonia assimilation into organic matter (most likely within 497 \ncryoconite holes on the surface of the glacier) is important before streams enter the glacier 498 \nand undergo ammonia loss through processes of nitrification. 499 \n 500 \nThe processes responsible for \nexcess\nNO3\n- \nand \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n within the glacial system can thus be 501 \nsummarised as follows: 502 \n \n503 \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n = nitrification of ammonia + mineralization and nitrification of Organic N 504 \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n = nitrification of ammonia + assimilation into organic matter 505 \n 506 \nMass flux calculations in Table 5 show that the \nexcess\nNO3\n-\n flux in the principal subglacial 507 \nrunoff phase accounts for 100 % of its catchment-wide production and is equivalent to 25 % 508 \nof the entire NO3\n-\n exported by the proglacial rivers. However, the total \ndeficit\nNH4\n+\n is even more 509 \nstriking, implying an 82 % reduction in the total meltwater transport of NH4\n+\n prior to leaving 510 \nthe catchment. In this particular year, the net effect is for NH4\n+ \nassimilation into the organic 511 \nphase to reduce the export of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (i.e. DIN or NO3\n- \n+ NH4\n+\n) by 27 %. 512 \nThese figures therefore serve to demonstrate the significant reactivity of DIN in the glacial 513 \necosystem following the onset of melt. 514 \n 515 \n5. Conclusions 516 \nThe dissolved inorganic nitrogen content of glacial meltwaters, NO3\n-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios and \u03b4\n15\nN and 517 \n\u03b4\n18\nO isotopic ratios have been used to try to understand the capacity for glacial runoff to 518 \nexport NO3\n-\n fluxes that are in excess of those entering the catchment via atmospheric 519 \ndeposition. In so doing, we have been able to characterise significant rates of NO3\n-\n production 520 \nbeneath a high Arctic glacier in Svalbard, European High Arctic. Our data show that much of 521 \nthe NO3\n-\n present within the subglacial meltwaters has most likely been produced following 522 \nthe microbial nitrification of snowpack NH4\n+\n and mineralisation of organic nitrogen. 523 \nPresently, we are unable to identify the exact substrate(s) used, due to similar \u03b4\n15\nN end 524 \nmember compositions. Mass fluxes indicate that loss of NH4\n+\n is widespread across the entire 525 \nglacier basin and often exceeds the excess nitrate produced in the subglacial environment. 526 \nThis suggests there must be an additional sink for ammonia within the catchment and is likely 527 \nrepresented through the assimilation of ammonia into organic matter such as that contained 528 \nwithin cryoconite holes on the surface of the glacier. Overall, NO3\n-\n production, which is 529 \nresponsible for enhancing the NO3\n-\n fluxes leaving the catchment by 25%, was far outweighed 530 \nby NH4\n+\n assimilation occurring elsewhere and causing an 82% reduction in the NH4\n+\n content 531 \nof runoff.  532 \n 533 \nAcknowledgements 534 \nThis work was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council studentship to P. 535 \nWynn; CASE industrial partnership funding in association with the NERC Isotope 536 \nGeoscience Laboratory, British Geological Survey; and Royal Society 20\nth\n IGC funding to A. 537 \nHodson. 538 \n 539 \n 540 \n 541 \n 542 \n 543 \n 544 \n 545 \n 546 \n 547 \n 548 \n 549 \n 550 \nReferences 551 \nAmberger, A. and Schmidt, H.-L., 1987.
