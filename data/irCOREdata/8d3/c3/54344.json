As part of the new \nGeneral Medical Services contract it included other changes such as an opt-\nout from out-of-hours care and greater skill-mix.  \n \nThere are early indications that the QOF might be associated with better \nrecorded care, enhanced processes, improved intermediate outcomes,3 \nreductions in inequalities4 and provide value for money in some but not all its \nclinical domains.5 It has helped consolidate evidence based methods for \nimproving care by, among other things, increasing the use of computerisation, \ndecision support, provider prompts, patient reminders (and recalls), skill-mix \nand teamwork.6 Many of these features were introduced prior to the QOF but \ncontinue to be strengthened as a result of it.  \n \nDetractors argue that the QOF is based on flawed evidence; that it has not led \nto real improvements in care or outcomes; that it will lead to worse \nunincentivised care and widen inequalities; that unintended consequences of \ngaming, overtreatment and a focus on pharmaceutical rather than \npsychosocial care will result; that by emphasising \u2018vertical\u2019 disease \nmanagement rather than horizontally-integrated holistic care it is not patient \ncentred; that it de-professionalizes doctors; and finally, that it is not a good \nuse of resources.7, 8 We should examine each of these arguments in turn.  \n \nIs the QOF really based on flawed evidence? Indicators were developed from \nguidance or consensus and even critics acknowledge that many QOF \nindicators are based on sound evidence.8 However, where this is not the \ncase, or when evidence changes, it does need to be addressed and the \ninvolvement of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) \nshould support this.9 There will always be a fine judgement about timing, level \nof evidence required and whether to accept a consensus rather than evidence \nbased indicator. An argument for greater consistency of care should not \n\u00a9 A N Siriwardena (2010) This preprint article is the property of A N Siriwardena.

Commentators that care would have \ncontinued to improve along secular trends for long term conditions such as \nasthma, diabetes or cardiovascular disease but it may have been over-\noptimistic to expect the QOF to deliver significant improvements above pre-\nexisting trends, given the considerable investment already made through \nnationwide strategies such as National Service Frameworks; and yet, there \nhave even been modest improvements above the secular trend for care of \nasthma, diabetes10 hypertension and cholesterol 12 as well as considerable \nimprovements for epilepsy which became a focus since the QOF was \nintroduced.13  \n \nAlthough care of clinical conditions not included in the QOF has not improved \nthere has not been the worsening of unincentivised care that some have \nwarned of.14 The QOF was not designed to reduce health inequalities due to \nsocioeconomic disadvantage and it is unlikely to do so. Despite this, \ninequalities in care have shown narrowing between the most and least \ndeprived areas;4 although the reason for this is less clear,15 a possible \nexplanation is that the QOF encourages greater consistency of care \nirrespective of deprivation. \n \nGaming is a concern - it is known to be a feature of many systems including \nthose that are P4P driven. However, there has been little evidence of gaming \nin the QOF in spite of or perhaps due to a rigorous system of checks at \nvarious levels.16 On the contrary, it has been reported that practices could \nhave treated an eighth fewer patients without falling below upper QOF \nthresholds17 and levels of exception reporting continue to fall year on year.18 \nNevertheless, vigilance and systems to detect and prevent gaming are \nneeded.  \n \nFinally, is it really plausible that the QOF is turning GPs into unthinking \nautomatons pursuing money at the expense of good patient care? \nFortunately, most thinking GPs realise that high quality care is not \nsynonymous with either QOF achievement or practice profits; they are not \nmotivated solely by money but rather aim to provide the best care for their \npatients.19 The balance of fixed versus performance related funding may be \nwrong. In fact, there is evidence that the structural changes to practice \nsystems may have led to similar outcomes but with lower levels of incentive.19  \n \nMany GPs themselves are concerned about the unintended consequences; \nthat QOF might adversely affect care by reducing time for patients, failing to \naddress patients\u2019 concerns or impairing continuity of care.6 A background of \nspeciality training, years of experience and embedded ethical practice have \nled most GPs to try and integrate and normalise20 the complex organisational \ndemands of the QOF into their current work by investing in staff, developing \n\u00a9 A N Siriwardena (2010) This preprint article is the property of A N Siriwardena.

Indicators with poor evidence should be removed, some which \nhave reached a ceiling may need to be retired 25 and new indicators should be \nintroduced after piloting.26 A finessed approach at improving it rather than a \npremature attempt at abandonment is what is needed.  \n \nNiroshan Siriwardena \n \nAcknowledgement \nMy thanks to Martin Marshall for his insightful comments on the paper.  \n \nReferences \n \n 1.
