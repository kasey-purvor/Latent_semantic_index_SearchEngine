The selected clones, all \ncommercially and\/or scientifically important in eastern Africa, embrace a range of \nmorphological and physiological types.  The bushes were planted in August 1988 and \ndifferential drought treatments were imposed for 16 and 13 weeks towards the end of the \ndry seasons in 1990 and 1991 respectively.  The resulting soil water deficits were \nsuccessfully simulated using a water balance model.  Under well-watered conditions \nClone S15\/10 (from Kenya) gave the highest yield of dry tea reaching 5600 kg ha-1 in the \nfourth year after planting (1991\/92) compared to 3640-4420 kg ha-1 for the other five \nclones.  During the cool season Clone SFS150 (from Malawi) yielded more than Clones 1, \n207, 6\/8 and K35.  Although annual yields decreased curvi-linearly as the maximum soil \nwater deficit increased, single values for the drought sensitivity of each clone could be \nderived by using stress time as an index of drought.  On this basis Clones S15\/10 and 207 \nwere identified as being the most sensitive to drought; Clones SFS150 and 1 were drought \nresistant.  The reasons for these differences in yield responses and the importance of \ndetermining drought sensitivity over an appropriate time period are discussed. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe tea crop is normally harvested at intervals of one to three weeks when the tender \nshoots comprising two or three unfurled leaves and a terminal bud are removed.  The \nannual yield depends on the shoot population density, the duration of the shoot \nreplacement cycle, and the fresh mass and dry matter content of the harvested shoots.  In \nturn, these yield components are affected by the weather, specifically the soil water deficit \n(SWD), temperature and the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) of the air (Carr and Stephens, \n1992; Tanton, 1982). \n Although most new tea areas are planted with clones that have shown above average \nyield and\/or quality in field trials, the ranking of these clones in terms of yield can vary \nbetween individual locations because they respond differently to the environment \n                                                 \n2 Address for correspondence:: Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, MK43 0AL \n(P.Burgess@cranfield.ac.uk) \n2 \n \n(Wickramaratne, 1981).  Attempts are now being made to quantify these responses and \nthere is already clear evidence that the base temperature for shoot extension varies \nbetween cultivars (Stephens and Carr, 1990).  Clonal differences in responses to drought \nhave also been demonstrated by Carr (1977) and Othieno (1978) in Kenya, and by \nNyirenda (1988) in Malawi, but these have not always been quantified in relation to the \nsoil water deficit. \n  This paper, part of a series of three, reports the results from a clone x drought \nexperiment, established in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania.  The objectives of the \nexperiment were to quantify the yields of six contrasting clones to various levels of water \nstress and to identify and quantify those attributes which determine the yield potential of a \nclone and its responses to drought and temperature. \n  \nMETHODOLOGY \nSite and climate \n Ngwazi Tea Research Unit (8\u00b032'S, 35\u00b010'E, altitude 1840 m), in the Mufindi District \nof the Southern Highlands of Tanzania, lies 20 km north-west of a traditional tea growing \narea that follows the ridge of the Uzungwe escarpment.  The year can be divided into three \nmain seasons on the basis of rainfall and temperature.  Over 95% of the 800-1100 mm \nannual rainfall occurs during a warm-wet season from the end of November until May, \nwhen the monthly mean air temperature (Tmean) ranges from 16 to 19\u00b0C.  The remaining \ndry season can be split in half: a cool season from June to August when Tmean is 13-16\u00b0C, \nand a warm period from September to November when Tmean increases from 16 to 19\u00b0C.  \nDaily short-wave solar radiation is lowest between May and August (14-18 MJ m-2) and \nhighest in October (23 MJ m-2).  The evaporation rate increases during the dry season \nfrom approximately 3 mm d-1 between June and August to 5 mm d-1 in October.  The \nhighest mean monthly mid-afternoon VPD, which also occurs in October, is only 1.5 kPa.  \nBecause this is below the limit at which the shoot growth of well watered tea is reduced \n(Tanton, 1982; Carr et al., 1987), the yields of tea during the dry season in Mufindi are \ninfluenced principally by the soil water deficit. \n A gently sloping (< 3%) area previously used intermittently for maize production, \nadjacent to Lake Ngwazi and to an area of mature tea, was selected for the experimental \nsite.  The pH (in water) of the soil at a depth of 0.6 m was about 5.2 which is within the \nrange considered optimal for tea (Othieno, 1992).  The soil, a Xanthic ferralsol, has the \nparticle size distribution of a sandy clay to a depth of 0.15 m and that of a clay below.   \nDespite the high proportion of clay the soil is friable because of the low effective cation \nexchange capacity (< 16 mmol 100g-1 of clay).  The volumetric water content at a matric \npotential of -10 kPa increases from 250 mm m-1 in the top 0.15 m to 330 mm m-1 at a \ndepth of 1.8 m.   The available water content in the top 2 m of soil, held between this \nupper limit and the permanent wilting point corresponding to a matric potential of -1500 \nkPa, is in the range 110-122 mm m-1. \n \nChoice of clones \n Six clones were chosen for their commercial and\/or scientific importance in Kenya, \nMalawi and Tanzania, and because they showed contrasting morphological and \nphysiological traits.  The clones included those with small leaves, such as 1 and 207 \n(China-type), those of intermediate-leaf size such as 6\/8, and large-leaf cultivars like \nSFS150, S15\/10 and K35 (Assam-type).  \n Clones 1 and 207 were selected in Mufindi, Tanzania.  Although Clone 1 can produce \nhigh yields under experimental conditions due to a large shoot population density \n(Stephens and Carr, 1990), the small and fibrous shoots can be difficult to harvest by hand.  \n3 \n \nClone 1 has a high base temperature for shoot extension (Stephens and Carr, 1990) and is \nalso considered to be drought resistant (Carr, 1971).  Clone 207 is easier to harvest than \nClone 1, and has been widely planted in Southern Tanzania because it is easy to establish.  \n Clone 6\/8 is a high quality clone from Kenya, which is now grown throughout East \nAfrica.  In Kenya it is considered drought susceptible (Othieno, 1978) but this attribute has \nbeen less evident in Southern Tanzania (Stephens and Carr, 1991a, 1991b). \n Clone SFS150, originally selected by the Tea Research Foundation of Central Africa in \nMalawi, is considered to be drought resistant and recovers quickly from pruning (Nyirenda \nand Grice, 1989).  It has a low base temperature for shoot extension (Cannell et al. 1990), \nand in Malawi it is used as a control to compare the yield of new clones.  Clone S15\/10 \nwas selected by the African Highlands Produce Company Ltd in Kericho, Kenya, where it \nhas recently produced an annual commercial yield of made tea exceeding 10,000 kg ha-1 \n(Oyamo, 1992), which is claimed to be a world record.  Clone K35, which is widely \ngrown in Southern Tanzania, was originally identified in Kericho by Brooke Bond Kenya \nLtd. \n  \nExperimental design \n Each of the six clones was planted, as 12-18 month old transplants, at a spacing of 1.2 x \n0.8 m within a line-source design (Hanks et al., 1976) in August 1988.  The experiment \ncomprised four replicate blocks, two on each side of a centrally-placed sprinkler lateral, \ncontaining six 24 x 6.4 m plots (running perpendicular to the lateral) which were randomly \nallocated to each clone.  There was a single guard row around each plot.  These main plots \nwere then split into six contiguous drought treatment sub-plots (3.6 x 4.8 m with 18 plants) \nlabelled from I5 (full irrigation) closest to the lateral to I0 (most drought stressed) at the \nextreme sides of the experiment.  Possible effects of a fertility gradient across the \nexperiment were removed in the analysis of yield data by allowing for covariance with \ndistance across the experiment (Morgan and Carr, 1988).  Young plants which died were \nimmediately replaced with healthy transplants of the same clone. \n The experiment was mulched with Napier grass (Pennisetum pupureum) at planting and \nin April 1989, and with Guatemala grass (Tripsacum laxum) in October 1990.  In order to \nbring the tea into production as early as possible, young branches were 'pegged' \nhorizontally between April and October 1989.  At planting, nitrogen (N), phosphate \n(P2O5) and potash (K2O) were applied at rates of 33, 68 and 79 kg ha-1 respectively; this \nwas followed by another three applications during the first year (August 1988 to July \n1989) totalling 74, 26 and 26 kg ha-1.  In the second and third years (1989\/90; 1990\/91) \nthere were three applications (all as N:P2O5:K2O 20:10:10) totalling 135:67:67 kg ha-1 in \nyear two and 350:175:175 kg ha-1 in year three.  In the fourth year, a total of 300:150:150 \nkg ha-1 was applied in two applications (July and January) to the irrigated tea, or as a \nsingle application to the unirrigated tea after the start of the rains.  These rates were \nintended to minimise any nutrient deficiency and were based on the recommendations \nfrom the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya (TRFK, 1986) and the results of an adjacent \nfertiliser experiment (Stephens and Carr, 1991a). \n \nDrought treatments \n To minimise the number of plant deaths during the initial years of the experiment, \ndrought treatments were only applied from 9 October to 27 November 1989 (7 weeks), \nfrom 27 July to 18 November 1990 (16 weeks), and from 18 July to 20 October 1991 (13 \nweeks).  At all other times during the dry season, the experiment was irrigated uniformly. \n Irrigation was scheduled so that the soil profile in the fully irrigated (I5) sub-plots was \nrewetted to field capacity before the soil water deficit (SWD) exceeded a value likely to \n4 \n \nreduce yield.  The critical SWD for the dry season yield of mature Clone 6\/8 at Ngwazi is \nbetween 40 and 100 mm, corresponding to a depletion of about 12-30% of the \n\u2018extractable\u2019 water (330 mm) within a 5.5 m deep rooting zone (Stephens and Carr, 1990).  \nUsing this as a guide and taking into account the rooting depth of the young tea as well as \npractical constraints on the availability of equipment, during 1990 and 1991 irrigation was \napplied when the estimated SWD reached 45 mm. \n For the purposes of irrigation scheduling, the SWD on day i was calculated using a \nsimple soil water balance (Equation 1). \n SWDi = SWDi-1 - Ri - Ii  + Di + ETi (1)  \nwhere Ri is the rainfall, Ii is the irrigation, Di is the instantaneous drainage and ETi is the \ncrop evapotranspiration all calculated daily in mm.  A value of Ii for each watering \ntreatment was measured using catch-cans spaced symmetrically across the experiment.  \nAny rainfall or irrigation received when the soil profile was at field capacity (SWD = 0) \nwas assumed to drain instantly and movement of surface water between treatments was \nprevented by micro-catchments excavated between the bushes.  The value of ETi was \ntaken to equal the daily evaporation (Epan; mm) from a screened 1.85 m square x 0.6 m \ndeep evaporation pan which accurately models the water loss from tea with full crop cover \n(Stephens and Carr, 1991a).  Because the experiment was irrigated at frequent intervals, \nany overestimation of transpiration due to incomplete crop cover during 1990 was \nassumed to be offset by evaporation from the soil surface and by slow drainage. \n The differential watering treatments were imposed using 22 sprinklers spaced at 6 m \nintervals to provide uniform application rates parallel to the single central lateral.  Two \ntypes of sprinklers (Bauer B90Z, with 7 and 3.5 mm nozzles, and Wright Rain Lancer with \n5.1 and 3.2 mm nozzles) with different watering patterns were exchanged halfway through \neach irrigation in order to obtain the required distribution perpendicular to the lateral.  \nBoth sets were operated at a constant pressure of 340-380 kPa.  During the imposition of \nthe differential drought treatments, the irrigation sub-plots received between 0 and 481 \nmm in 1990, and 0 and 374 mm in 1991 (Table 1). \n \n \nTable 1.   Rainfall and irrigation water (mm) applied to each drought\/irrigation treatment \n(I5 to I0) during the periods of differential drought in 1990 and 1991. \n  Rainfall               Drought treatment   \n   I5 I4 I3 I2 I1 I0 \nSeason \n27 July - 18 Nov. 1990 11 481 401 256 70 9 0 \n18 July - 20 Oct. 1991 1 374 328 185 55 12 0 \n \n \nSoil water balance \n A water balance model, based on that used by Stephens and Carr (1991b), was used to \nestimate the daily SWD within each drought treatment during 1990 and 1991.  This model \nused the same values of rainfall and irrigation that were used for irrigation scheduling \n(Equation 1), but ETi was partitioned into transpiration, soil evaporation and slow \ndrainage.  At field capacity, the \u2018extractable\u2019 water available to a mature tea plant with \nroots extending to a depth of 5.5 m is about 330 mm at this site (Stephens and Carr, \n1991b).  The distribution of this water within the soil profile was then used to determine \nthe quantity of water available to young tea plants with different rooting depths.  In this \nway, the estimate of \u2018extractable\u2019 water increased from 114 mm, when the maximum root \n5 \n \ndepth was 1.5 m in November 1990 (Burgess and Carr, 1996a), to 157 mm to a depth of \n2.2 m in November 1991.  The daily transpiration rate was then assumed to equal Epan \nadjusted for crop cover (see below) until 18% of the \u2018extractable\u2019 water was removed \n(Stephens and Carr, 1991a), beyond which point the rate declined linearly to zero at 100% \ndepletion. \n The potential water lost by evaporation from the soil surface and slow percolation was \ndetermined from four uncultivated sites next to the experiment.  Using water release \ncurves and water content measurements, made with a Wallingford neutron probe (Didcot \nInstruments Ltd.) which was calibrated at a site adjacent to the experiment (Stephens and \nCarr, 1991b), a zero-flux plane was identified at 0.4 m.  Water losses above and below this \ndepth were therefore assumed to be caused by soil evaporation and slow drainage \nrespectively.  Soil evaporation declined from 1.0 mm d-1 at \u2018field capacity\u2019 to zero when \nthe SWD within the top 0.4 m reached about 40 mm.  Slow drainage was related to the \nSWD between 0.4 m and the maximum rooting depth, declining linearly from 2.4 mm d-1 \nwhen the soil was at \u2018field capacity\u2019 to zero when the SWD reached 83 mm.  These values \nfor evaporation and slow drainage were then adjusted for the proportion of the ground not \ncovered by the crop. \n The model was validated by using the neutron probe to measure the soil water content \naround 40 mm diameter access holes in selected treatments.  Although each hole was \naugered by hand to a depth of 2 m, a shortage of aluminium tubing meant that it was only \npossible to line the top 0.45 m of each hole.  Below this depth, soil which fell from the \nsides could block the hole and for this reason, readings from 16 holes in 1990 and 32 in \n1991 were excluded from subsequent data analysis.  The soil water content was measured \nat 0.15-0.20 m increments to depths of 1.7 (1990) or 1.9 m (1991) in four replicates of the \nfully irrigated (I5), partially irrigated (I2 and I3) and unirrigated (I0) sub-plots of Clones 1, \n6\/8, SFS150 and S15\/10 (a total of 64 holes), one to two days before and two to three days \nafter each irrigation.  The SWD within each treatment was then calculated as the \ndifference between the measured water content and a mean \u2018field capacity\u2019 water content \nwhich was measured before the start of the dry season. \n \nYield and crop cover measurements \n Shoots extending more than 0.45 m from ground level were removed in \nearly November 1989, 15 months after planting, to produce a level surface on each bush.  \nAll the shoots with two or more unfurled leaves above this surface were then harvested \none month later and subsequently at intervals varying from 13 days in the warm season to \n24 days during the cool season.  The total fresh mass of the shoots from each sub-plot was \nweighed at each harvest and the corresponding dry mass was estimated using a conversion \nfactor derived from a regression analysis of the dry matter content of leaf samples taken \nfrom each clone with the mean air temperature recorded over the preceding two months \n(Burgess, 1992).   \n Crop cover was measured using a 1.2 x 0.8 m frame, corresponding to the bush spacing \nand containing a grid of 96 squares measuring 0.1 x 0.1 m, which was supported \nimmediately above selected bushes.  The proportion of each square (0-25, 25-75 or 75-\n100%) which included leaf, when examined individually from overhead, was recorded to \nprovide an estimate of the proportion of the ground covered by the crop.  Two or three \nbushes were examined in each of the four replicates of selected drought treatments of each \nclone on a monthly basis. \n  \n  \n6 \n \nSensitivity to drought \n Drought sensitivity was first examined by relating annual yields to the maximum soil \nwater deficits calculated using the model.  However previous work has shown that if the \ndecline in yield as the SWD increases is curved, a linear relation can be obtained by \nrelating the yields to a stress time index (Stephens and Carr, 1989).  To derive a similar \nfunction, each drought treatment in this experiment was defined in terms of stress time \n(mm d); an accumulated measure of the time and the extent that the soil water deficit was \ngreater than a critical deficit beyond which yields declined.  Values of stress time for each \ndrought treatment and season were calculated using critical deficits ranging from 0 to 100 \nmm.  The most appropriate value for the critical deficit (\u00b1 5 mm) in each season was taken \nas that which resulted in the best linear relation between the mean yield of the six clones \nand the corresponding stress time. \n \n \nRESULTS \nSoil water deficit model \n During 1990 and 1991, the values of the SWD estimated with the model (SWDmodel) \nwere similar to those calculated from the neutron probe measurements (SWDNP) in the \nselected sub-plots (Figure 1; Equations 2 and 3).  It was therefore possible to use the \nmodel to estimate daily values of SWD within each of the treatments. \n1990 SWDmodel  =   0.99 (\u00b10.04) .SWDNP   \u2212   3 (\u00b12.7) (n=50, R2 = 0.92) (2) \n1991 SWDmodel  =   1.00 (\u00b10.06) .SWDNP   +   9 (\u00b13.9) (n=45, R2 = 0.86) (3) \n The neutron probe measurements were not sufficiently precise to identify possible  \ndifferences in the soil water deficit between clonal plots.  The model also indicated that \nsuch differences would be minimal because changes in transpiration were masked by \ncorresponding variations in soil evaporation and slow drainage.  A single maximum SWD \ncould therefore be calculated for each drought treatment in each season.  Thus in 1990, \nmaximum values of the SWD reached 45 and 117 mm within the fully irrigated (I5) and \nmost drought stressed (I0) treatments respectively (Figure 1).  In 1991 the corresponding \nvalues were 47 and 145 mm. \n \nYield development of fully irrigated tea \n The dry mass of tea harvested from fully irrigated Clone S15\/10 increased from 680 kg \nha-1 in the year ending 31 May 1990 (during which harvesting began), to 3590 kg ha-1 and \nthen 5650 kg ha-1 for the corresponding periods in 1990\/91 and 1991\/92 (Table 2).  During \neach of these years Clone S15\/10 yielded substantially more (28-75%) than the other five \nclones all of which gave similar yields except for Clones 6\/8 and K35 which yielded less \nthan Clone 207 in the year ending 31 May 1990 and Clone K35 which yielded less than \nClone 1 in 1991\/92. \n The yield development of fully irrigated Clone S15\/10 was associated with an increase \nin the crop cover from 19% in September 1989, 13 months after planting, to 51, 95 and \n96% in May 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively (Figure 2a).  There were also differences \nbetween clones in the rates of increase in crop cover, for example in November 1990 the \ncrop covers of Clones 1 and S15\/10 (74-77%) exceeded those of Clones 6\/8, 207 and K35 \n(50-58%).  This is despite the fact that all of the bushes were brought into bearing by \n\u2018pegging\u2019, a technique which is likely to minimise differences between the clones.  By \nApril 1992, 44 months after planting, the crop cover of each of the fully irrigated clones \nhad exceeded 90%. \n \n \n7 \n \n \nFigure 1. Predicted changes in the actual soil water deficit within each of four drought \ntreatments during the 1990 dry season using the soil water balance model: fully irrigated \nI5 :  \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 ,  partially irrigated I3 : \u2014 \u2014 \u2014  , I2 : - - - -, and unirrigated I0: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  The \nsymbols indicate the soil water deficit measured using a neutron probe moisture meter \nI5 : S , I3 :U, I2: \u0085 , I0: O. \n \nSeasonal yield distribution of fully irrigated tea \n Yields from all the clones were reduced during each cool season from June to August \nas rates of shoot growth and crop canopy development were constrained by low \ntemperatures, but there were differences between clones in crop yield distribution.  For \nexample Clone SFS150 yielded more than Clone 1 during the cool season in 1991, but less \nthan Clone 1 during the succeeding warm weather between December 1991 and May 1992 \n(Table 2; Figure 2b).  The seasonal yield distribution from Clone SFS150 was therefore \nmore uniform than that from Clone 1. \n \nTable 2.

Although the yields from Clone S15\/10 were substantially larger than those \nfrom the other clones under well watered conditions, they were similar to those from \nClones 1 and SFS150 within the most drought stressed treatments (Figures 3a and 3b).  \nBecause the relations between the annual yields and the maximum SWD appeared to be \ncurvi-linear, the yields in each year were also examined in relation to the stress time \nsummed above a derived value for the critical SWD during each of the two dry seasons.  \nUsing the mean annual yields for all six clones, these were estimated to be 70 mm in \n1990\/91 (R2=0.99) and 90 mm in 1991\/92 (R2=0.99).   The drought sensitivity of each \nclone (Kd: kg ha-1 mm-1 d-1) was then defined by the slope of the linear relation between \nthe annual yields of each clone and the corresponding stress time for each drought \ntreatment.  The ranking of the clones in terms of Kd was consistent between the two years: \nClones S15\/10 and 207 were the most sensitive to drought; Clones 1 and SFS150 were the \nleast sensitive (Table 3). \n \n \nTable 3. Sensitivity of annual yields to drought (kg ha-1 mm-1 d-1): the slope (Kd) of the \nlinear relation between the annual yields from 1 June to 31 May for each of six clones and \nthe corresponding drought stress time (mm d) summed above critical deficits of 70 mm in \n1990\/91 and 90 mm in 1991\/92. \n                     Sensitivity of annual yields to drought: Kd \n                                                        1990\/91                        1991\/92 \nClone  S15\/10 -0.68  -1.28  \n 207 -0.50  -0.95 \n 6\/8 -0.40  -0.88 \n K35 -0.39  -0.84  \n 1 - 0.36  -0.75  \n SFS150 -0.37  -0.67  \nsed (n=4)  0.048  0.093 \n \n \nThe apparent drought sensitivity of Clone 207 can be partly explained by the \nobservation that infection by the fungus Phomopsis theae (Petch) caused the defoliation \nand death of 19% of the unirrigated plants between November 1990 and May 1991.  By \ncontrast less than 6% of plants of the other clones were affected.  The drought resistance \nshown by unirrigated plants of  Clones 1 and SFS150, between June 1990 and May 1991, \nwas partly related to the capacity of these bushes to maintain a greater crop cover (47-\n48%) than corresponding plants of Clones 6\/8, 207 and K35 (21-25%) at the end of the dry \nseason in November 1990 (Table 4). \n \n \nDry season yields and drought \n There were also clonal differences in the effects of drought on yields during the dry \nseason.  For example whereas yields from Clone S15\/10 under well watered conditions \nwere substantially larger than those from the other five clones, under droughted conditions \nthey were similar to those from Clones 1, 207, 6\/8 and K35.  In the 1990 dry season, \nyields from unirrigated Clone S15\/10 were even below those from Clone SFS150 (Figures \n3c and 3d).   \n10 \n \n The dry season yields of each clone were also examined in relation to stress time and \nusing the mean yields of all six clones, the derived critical soil water deficits were 40 mm \nin 1990 (R2=0.98) and 50 mm in 1991 (R2=0.99).  These are less than those obtained from \nan examination of the annual yields.  Although Clone S15\/10 was again shown to be \nparticularly drought sensitive (Table 5), this analysis failed to confirm the drought \nsensitivity of Clone 207 or the drought resistance of Clone 1 that were apparent with the \nannual yields. \n \nTable 4.

The lines were drawn using the derived linear relations between the yields of each \nclone and stress time.    \n \n \n  \n12 \n \nDISCUSSION \n This study has highlighted the large annual yields that can be obtained from irrigated \ntea during the first four years after planting and the exceptional performance of Clone \nS15\/10.  There were also differences between clones in the seasonal yield distribution \nreflecting in part their relative sensitivities to low temperatures.  The clones also differed \nin their responses to drought, although care is needed to specify an appropriate time period \nfor the analysis.  Each of these issues is discussed with specific reference to clonal \nselection.  Firstly, though, the precision of the estimation of the actual soil water deficit is \nconsidered. \n \nSoil water deficit \n The soil water balance model provided a good description of the changes in SWD over \na range of crop covers (50-90%) and maximum rooting depths (1.5-2.2 m).  The model is \nalso known to provide a good description of changes in SWD for young tea during the first \nyear after planting (Burgess, 1992) and for mature tea with full crop cover and a maximum \nrooting depth of 5.5 m (Stephens and Carr, 1991b).  It can therefore be used with some \nconfidence to estimate the SWD for young and mature tea grown at this site with and \nwithout irrigation. \n Further refinement of the model is limited by the precision of the neutron probe \ncalibration, the repeatability of the field measurements and the definition of \u2018field \ncapacity\u2019.  The slope of the calibration curve relating the neutron probe readings to the \nvolumetric water content had a standard error equivalent to 11 mm for each 100 mm of \nwater extraction (n = 21).  This is similar to values of between 6 and 17 mm per 100 mm \n(n > 19) reported for clay soils in the United States (Amoozegar et al., 1989).  The \nstandard errors of the daily mean water content within each drought treatment ranged from \n8 to 18 mm (n = 16).  Such variations could be caused by differences in the chemical \ncomposition of the soil across the experiment or, more likely, by spatial differences in \ninfiltration within the sub-plots.  Differences in the gradual erosion of soil from the sides \nof the unlined holes could also have increased the variation in the calculated water content \nbetween replicates (Amoozegar et al., 1989).  For this reason the use of partially lined \nholes is not recommended.  Lastly the SWD depends upon the determination of the water \ncontent at \u2018field capacity\u2019.  In this experiment this was measured 24 hours after rain which \nhad fully saturated the soil, and mean values to a depth of 1.9 m ranged from 490 to 516 \nmm. \n \nAnnual yields from fully irrigated clones \n During the fourth year after planting (1991\/92) the yield of dried tea from one clone, \nlabelled S15\/10, reached 5650 kg ha-1 compared with a mean of 3890 kg ha-1 from the \nother five clones.  These values are greater than the 3000-3500 kg ha-1 currently obtained \non the best commercial estates in Southern Tanzania from partially irrigated mature \nseedling and clonal tea with full ground cover.  The large yields obtained in this \nexperiment at commercial plant densities were possible through rapid establishment of \ncrop cover by pegging, prevention of drought stress by irrigation and the removal of a high \nproportion of harvestable shoots by tightly controlled plucking.  The real possibility of \nachieving such high yields from young tea has important commercial implications which \nare currently being examined by tea growers in the region. \n One reason for the large initial yields from Clone S15\/10 was its capacity to establish \ncrop cover more quickly than four of the other clones.  However the yield advantage of \nClone S15\/10 continued into 1992 even as the other clones approached full crop cover.  In \nan accompanying paper, it is shown how the high yields of Clone S15\/10 are associated \n13 \n \nwith a greater partitioning of dry matter to leaves and less to large structural roots than the \nother five clones (Burgess and Carr, 1996a). \n \nSeasonal yield distribution \n There were also clonal differences in the seasonal distribution of yield.  Although fully \nirrigated Clone SFS150 yielded more than Clone 1 during the cool-dry season, the ranking \nwas reversed during the warm-wet season.  Such differences can be caused by clonal \ndifferences in the \u2018base temperature\u2019 and \u2018thermal extension rate\u2019 for shoot growth.  For \nexample subsequent analyses have shown that Clone SFS150, selected in the seasonal \nclimate of Southern Malawi, has a lower base temperature for shoot extension than Clones \n1, 207 and K35 (Burgess and Carr, 1996b).  This means that it is better able to maintain \nshoot growth during the winter months when the mean air temperature (13-15\u00b0C) is close \nto the base temperature for shoot extension.  It also means that Clone SFS150 should be \nsuitable for planting at high altitudes.   \n \nClonal selection \n By separating annual yield responses in terms of a) maximum yield and b) drought \nsensitivity, it is possible to identify those clones that give the highest yields for specified \nlevels of drought stress.  Where the crop was kept well watered, the yields from Clone \nS15\/10 were 28-62% greater than those from the other five clones during the first four \nyears after planting.  Although it was unable to maintain this yield advantage when \ndroughted, Clone S15\/10 still produced yields higher than, or similar to, those from other \nclones at each of the drought levels examined in this experiment.  Growers are therefore \nadvised to grow a clone like S15\/10, where partial irrigation can be provided or where the \nmaximum actual SWD remains below 120-145 mm during the third and fourth years after \nplanting.  If the drought stress is greater than this, then yields from drought resistant \nClones 1 and SFS150 could exceed those of Clone S15\/10.  However in practice Clone 1, \nalthough drought resistant, is of little commercial interest because the small fibrous shoots \nare difficult to harvest by hand and the quality of the processed tea is mediocre.  \nNevertheless it may be suitable as a root-stock for drought resistant composite plants.  By \ncontrast Clone SFS150 is of direct commercial interest (although of low inherent quality) \nand the results presented here suggest that it should be more widely grown by small-\nholders in Southern Tanzania who do not have the financial resources to provide \nirrigation.  Clone SFS150 also has the advantage of relatively large yields during the cool \nseason. \n \nComparison of annual and dry season responses \n In each year the critical SWD for annual yield was substantially larger than that for the \ndry season alone.  Although mild drought can reduce dry season yields by restricting the \ngrowth rate of shoots, these shoots can still contribute to yields in the subsequent wet \nseason.  Such compensation in growth and yields following the relief of drought stress has \nalso been observed by Carr (1974).  A grower must therefore balance the benefits obtained \nfrom a more even crop distribution by maintaining a small soil water deficit against the \ncosts incurred by applying more water during the dry season. \n The sensitivity to drought shown by the yields of Clone 207 on an annual basis was not \napparent from an analysis of dry season yields alone.  This is because the susceptibility of \nunirrigated Clone 207 to infection by the fungal disease Phomopsis theae, which is \naggravated by drought (Shanmuganathan and Rodrigo, 1967), was only observed after the \nalleviation of stress.  Similarly the benefits of the droughted plants of Clones 1 and \nSFS150 being able to maintain a greater crop cover than the other clones at the end of the \ndry season, only became fully apparent during the subsequent wet weather as increased \n14 \n \ninterception of solar radiation led to greater dry matter production and larger yields.  For \nthis reason Clones 1 and SFS150 appeared to be more drought resistant when assessed on \nan annual, rather than a dry season basis.  Both these examples highlight the importance of \nstudying differences in the yield sensitivity to drought of perennial crops, such as tea, over \nan appropriate time period. \n This experiment is continuing and the relations described above will be determined \nagain for the same clones when they are mature.  The quality and total value of the \nprocessed tea is also being measured. \n \nAcknowledgements.
