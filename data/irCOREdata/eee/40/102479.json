INTRODUCTION\nIT IS IMPORTANT to measure accurately and consistentlythe pulsewidths of pulsed nanosecond lasers such as ex-\ncimer lasers, the nitrogen laser, and the Q-switched Nd:YAG\nlaser. For example, in excimer laser keratectomy, the control\nof the laser duration is important in determining the amount\nof ablation of the cornea tissues [1]. Similarly, the temporal\ncharacteristics of the laser pulse are vital in applications such\nas shadowgraphy, schlieren photography, microlithography,\nand micromachining [2].\nIn the literature, most researchers have reported on the use\nof a combination of a fast photodiode coupled to a storage\noscilloscope (or a transient-event digitizer) for the measure-\nment of pulsewidths [3], [4]. Occasionally, an expensive streak\ncamera may be employed [5].\nGenerally speaking, the pulsewidth of a laser depends on\nthe pumping configuration and the resonator parameters. For\nexample, in the case of a nitrogen laser, the temporal pulse\nshape depends largely on the voltage of the discharge circuit\nand the pressure of the lasing gas. However, it is very difficult\nto obtain an accurate and consistent measurement of the pulse\nshape of a nanosecond laser pulse because of the following.\n1) The laser pulse is of a short duration, and the pulse\nprofile may vary from one shot to another. Therefore, to\ncapture the pulse shape accurately, a precision transient-\nevent digitizer or digital oscilloscope with very high\nsampling rate, in the range of gigasamples per second\nor higher, is required to capture the laser pulse shape\nreliably.\nManuscript received February 27, 1998; revised Decmber 21, 1998.\nS.-C.

Otherwise, the\ncarrier transit time will become very long and degrade\nthe temporal measurements [6].\n3) The spatial energy distribution of a nitrogen or excimer\nlaser beam is generally non-Gaussian and nonuniform.\nConsequently, for accurate and consistent measurement\nof the temporal pulse shape, the laser beam has to be\nfocused neatly onto the tiny photodiode to even out the\neffects of different parts of the beam. Proper alignment\nof the focused laser beam and the photodetector is, thus,\ncrucial.\nIn this paper, we report on a new technique for the consistent\nmeasurement of laser pulsewidths. The results are compared\nto those obtained using a few other methods.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL LAYOUT\nThe pulsed laser used in our experiment is a nitrogen laser\ndeveloped in our laboratory (Blumlein-circuit, transverse flow,\nelectrically excited, corona preionization, 2.8-mm electrode\ngap) [2]. As the radiative lifetime of nitrogen\u2019s transition from\nthe upper lasing state to the lower lasing state\nvaries from about 40 ns at a few mbars to about 2 ns at one\nbar [7], fast high-voltage electrical discharges are required to\nexcite the nitrogen molecules. Part of the kinetic energy of\nan electron is transferred to a nitrogen molecule by elastic\ncollision\n(1)\nFig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental\nlayout. Through numerical control, a PC is used to vary the\noperating voltage from 9.0 to 11.1 kV, and the gas operating\npressure from 250 to 1000 mbar. Laser emission at the\nwavelength of 337.1 nm is confirmed using an Oriel 77400\nspectrograph with 0.2-nm resolution.\nThe output beam from the laser is split into two paths for\nsimultaneous measurements of pulsewidth and pulse energy.\nThe uncoated wedge reflects about 4% of the laser beam to\nthe photodiode (MG13DAH001 with a detection area of 0.04\nmm and a rise time of 0.35 ns). A HP54720D transient-event\noscilloscope, sampling at 8 GSa\/s and having a rise time of\n0.175 ns, is used to record the laser pulses and, subsequently,\ndownload the data to the PC via the built-in HPIB interface.\nThe HP scope also provides an optional digital noise filter\nfor the incoming signals. The digital low-pass filter, called\nthe finite impulse-response (FIR) filter, will attenuate the\n0018\u20139456\/98$10.00 \uf8e9 1998 IEEE\n998 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, VOL. 47, NO. 4, AUGUST 1998\nFig. 1.

This effectively reduces both the noise floor in the\nscope and any noise spikes riding on the input signal, although\nthe effective signal bandwidth is narrowed from 2 GHz to 400\nMHz [8].\nIII. MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATIONS\nFig. 2 shows the setup for direct unaided measurement of\nthe laser pulse. The laser pulse is shone directly onto the\nphotodiode after passing through a neutral-density (ND) filter\nthat attenuates the intensity level of the signal to a suitable\nlevel for photodetection.\nFig. 3 shows an improved measurement setup that makes\nuse of an equiconvex focusing lens made of fused silica. It\nhas been found that the alignment of the photodetector with\nrespect to the focused beam is very critical.\nFig. 4 shows the measurement setup that makes use of a\n1-m-long multimode optical fiber as the beam homogenizer.\nIt can be observed that the ND filter is no longer required,\nas the beam intensity at the photodetector can be adjusted by\nvarying slightly the distance between the tip of the fiber and\nthe photodetector.\nFig. 5 shows the novel measurement setup that makes use\nof a focusing lens in conjunction with a tapered rod acting as a\nFig. 4.

Pulsewidth measurement with a tapered glass rod.\nTABLE I\nPULSEWIDTHS OBTAINED USING VARIOUS MEASUREMENT SETUPS\nbeam homogenizer and a light pipe. The tapered rod was pulled\nover a flame in the laboratory. The taper angle is roughly 5 .\nAgain, no ND filter is required, as the beam intensity at the\nphotodetector is adjusted by varying the distance between the\ntip of the tapered rod and the photodetector.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nTable I summarizes the results of pulsewidth measurement\nusing the various techniques: 1) the direct unaided method; 2)\nthe direct unaided method with digital noise filtering; 3) the\nfocusing lens method with digital noise filtering; 4) the optical\nfiber method with digital noise filtering; and 5) the tapered rod\nmethod with digital noise filtering. Twenty laser pulses were\nrecorded for each setup at a discharge voltage of 11.1 kV and\na nitrogen pressure of 1 bar. The mean, maximum deviation\n(defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum\nvalues normalized by the mean), and standard deviation are\ncalculated for each set of readings.\nIn the direct unaided method, the photodetector is sampling\nthe laser beam directly from the exit port of the nitrogen\nlaser. As shown in Table I, the average pulsewidth is 1.50 ns,\nthe maximum deviation is 24.5%, and the standard deviation\nis 7.6%. The average pulse energy, detected by a Molec-\ntron EM500 energy meter with a J-25 pyroelectric probe, is\nTAM et al.: MEASURING THE PULSEWIDTH OF NANOSECOND LASER PULSES 999\nFig. 6. Intensity profile of raw beam (discharge voltage = 11.1 kV, nitrogen\npressure = 1 bar).\ntypically 0.23 mJ. The divergence of the beam is estimated to\nbe 2 approximately.\nThe mode shape, i.e., the transverse intensity distribution\nof the laser beam, is assessed using a Spiricon LBA-100A\nbeam diagnostic system. The laser beam falls onto a Cohu\n4810 CCD camera, and the intensities captured are analyzed\nand displayed on the monitor. The intensity profile can also\nbe output in the form of a data file. Fig. 6 shows the intensity\ndistribution of a typical nitrogen laser pulse captured by the\nbeam profiler. It can be observed that the intensity distribution\nof the raw beam is nonuniform, but approximates a bivariate\nnormal distribution. Energy spikes exist mainly at the center of\nthe beam. Also, using the same apparatus, we have determined\nthat the pointing instability of the nitrogen laser output, i.e.,\nbeam jitter, is approximately 0.22 mrad (at 95% confidence\ninterval). Therefore, the shot-to-shot variation over a small\ndetector area of 0.04 mm becomes fairly substantial.\nThe digital noise filter improves pulsewidth measurement,\nwith the maximum deviation being reduced from 24.5% to\n14.1% and the standard deviation being reduced from 7.6%\nto 3.9%. The reason is that the high-frequency noise that may\nexist at the peak of the pulse is filtered. The pulsewidth at\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM) can then be determined\nmore accurately. However, it can be observed that the mean\npulsewidth is lengthened by 0.14 ns. This is mainly caused by\nan increase in the rise time of the instrument by reducing the\nbandwidth (BW) of the oscilloscope from 2 GHz to 400 MHz.\nThe rise time is related to the BW by [6]\n(2)\nTherefore, the theoretical rise time is increased from 0.175 ns\nfor GHz to 0.875 ns for MHz.\nA further experiment performed using this measurement\nsetup reviews that the average pulsewidths for 20 pulses taken\nat different parts of the beam may vary by 0.20 ns (at 95%\nconfidence interval) over a direct beam area of 3.5 mm 3.5\nFig. 7. Intensity profile of laser beam after exiting from optical fiber\n(discharge voltage = 11.1 kV, nitrogen pressure = 1 bar).\nmm. Hence, variation of the mean pulsewidth by as much as\n0.20 ns should not be considered as overly alarming.\nUsing a focusing lens with digital noise filtering improves\nthe consistency of the measurements, with the maximum\ndeviation being reduced to 9.8% and the standard deviation\nbeing reduced to 2.9%. The improvement results from a bigger\nportion of the beam being captured and measured by the tiny\nphotodetector.\nPutting one end of a 1-m-long optical fiber at the focus of\nthe converging lens allows the beam to be homogenized by\nmode propagation and multiple reflections in the multimode\nfiber. This results in the maximum deviation being reduced to\n7.6% and the standard deviation being reduced to 2.0%. Fig. 7\nshows the intensity distribution of the laser beam emerging\nfrom the tip of the optical fiber. A large portion of the beam\nis homogenized, but there exist sporadic energy peaks all over\nthe beam.\nSince the optical fiber has a core diameter of 50 m, a\nnumerical aperture of 0.25, and a refractive index of 1.46, it\nworks out that the modal dispersion (or the longest geometrical\npath difference for different ray angles in the fiber) will\naccount for about 0.07 ns of pulse dispersion. Therefore, the\nincrease in the mean pulsewidth is due to a combination of\nhaving temporal pulse dispersion in the fiber and having a\nlarger portion of the beam being sampled.\nIt should be noted that other commercial laser beam ho-\nmogenizers might be attempted to achieve better measurement\nconsistency. These devices include \u201cfly\u2019s eye\u201d lenses, light\nducts, and diffractive optical elements. However, such prod-\nucts are generally quite expensive.\nThe use of a tapered-end circular glass rod improves further\nthe consistency of pulsewidth measurements. The maximum\ndeviation and the standard deviation are reduced to 6.2% and\n1.4%, respectively. The glass rod acts as a beam homogenizer\nand light conduit, so that the effect of pointing instability is\nlargely eliminated. Fig. 8 shows the intensity profile of the\nlaser beam after emerging from the tapered end of the glass\nrod. The rays that enter the rod bounce off the sides of the glass\nwall for at least four times, thus homogenizing the beam to a\ncertain extent. In this setup, since the numerical aperture of the\ninput beam is about 0.18, the increase in average pulsewidth\ndue to beam propagation in the tapered glass rod is only about\n0.006 ns.\n1000 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, VOL. 47, NO. 4, AUGUST 1998\nFig. 8.

Pulsewidth measurement at various discharge voltages and nitrogen\npressures using the proposed tapered-rod method.\nFig. 9 shows the pulsewidth measurements using an un-\naided measurement setup for various nitrogen gas pressures\nat different discharge voltages. The same measurements were\nretaken using the proposed measurement method (focusing\nlens tapered glass rod digital noise filter), and the\nresults are plotted in Fig. 10. The improvement in data relia-\nbility and data interpretation is evident. Such improvement in\nmeasurement consistency is essential in designing hardware\nor software control schemes to stabilize the output of a\nnanosecond laser.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a novel, low-cost, simple, and prac-\ntical technique for measuring the pulsewidth of a nanosecond\npulsed laser beam. Compared with an unaided measurement\nsetup, the use of our proposed measurement configuration\n(focusing lens tapered rod digital noise filter) improves\nmarkedly the reliability of the data collected. In our experiment\nwith a nitrogen laser, the maximum deviation has been reduced\nfrom 24.5% to 6.2%, and the standard deviation from 7.4%\nto 1.4%. This is achieved by partial homogenization of the\nraw beam, and by elimination of the adverse effect of beam\njitter. The lengthening of the pulse due to modal dispersion\nis negligible.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G. H. Pettit, M. N. Ediger, and R. P. Weiblinger, \u201cExcimer laser ablation\nof the cornea,\u201d Opt.
