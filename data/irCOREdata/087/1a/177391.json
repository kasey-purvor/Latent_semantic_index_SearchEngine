One study\nhas suggested that the number of symptoms people experience may be an important predictor of mortality. This\nnovel and potentially important finding may have important implications but needs to be tested in other cohorts.\nMethods: 858 people aged around 58 years were interviewed by nurses in 1990\/1 as part of the West of Scotland\nTwenty-07 Study. They were asked about the presence of symptoms in the last month from a checklist of 33\nsymptoms. Measures of morbidity included symptom type (respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, mental\nhealth, neurological, systemic) and symptom summary measures looking at the number and impact of symptoms\n(total number; number participants tended to have; number participants did not tend to have; number which\nrestricted usual activities; number which led to GP consultation). Hazard ratios for thirteen-year all-cause\nmortality were calculated for symptom types, symptom summary measures, and self-assessed health with and\nwithout adjustment.\nResults: On unadjusted analysis, and after adjusting for gender, socio-economic status and smoking, mortality\nwas elevated in individuals reporting respiratory, systemic and mental health symptoms. After additional\nadjustment for chronic conditions and self-assessed health, only the association between mental health symptoms\nand mortality remained significant. On unadjusted analysis, and after adjusting for gender, socio-economic status\nand smoking, mortality was elevated in individuals with many (\u2265 6) symptoms in four of the symptom summary\nmeasures examined. These relationships were no longer significant after additional adjustment for chronic\nconditions and self-assessed health. A clear trend of increasing mortality as self-assessed health became poorer\nwas observed. This pattern remained statistically significant after adjustment for gender, socio-economic status,\nsmoking, chronic conditions and the total number of symptoms experienced.\nConclusion: Symptoms often thought of as minor may have important consequences later in life especially for\nthose reporting mental health-related symptoms or those experiencing many symptoms. In this study however,\nself-assessed health appeared to be a better predictor of mortality than the type or number of symptoms\nexperienced, even when the tendency to have and impact of the symptoms were taken into account.\nPublished: 11 December 2006\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:158 doi:10.1186\/1472-6963-6-158\nReceived: 08 August 2006\nAccepted: 11 December 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/158\n\u00a9 2006 Elliott et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:158 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/158Background\nThere has been growing interest in recent years in\nresearching symptoms in the community [1,2], particu-\nlarly since symptoms are drivers of health care utilisation\nand have been shown to be the principal reason for clinic\nvisits in about half of all outpatient encounters [2]. Previ-\nous population-based studies of a range of symptoms [3-\n10] have provided useful information on the prevalence\nof symptoms within different socio-demographic groups,\nexamined symptom burden and looked at the impact of\nsymptoms in terms of quality of life, reduced functioning\nand use of health services. While some of these studies\nhave examined the relationship between symptoms and\nthe presence of chronic disease or self-assessed health,\nnone of them have investigated the relationship with\nmortality.\nOnly one previous study has investigated the relationship\nbetween symptom burden and mortality [11]. Sha et al.\nfound that individuals with higher symptom scores were\nsignificantly more likely to die over the subsequent year\nthan individuals with no or few symptoms, even after\nadjustment for age, sex, race, chronic conditions, self-\nassessed health, depression and anxiety. This suggests that\nthe number of symptoms people experience may be an\nimportant predictor of mortality. This novel finding, if\nreplicated, may have important implications. Further evi-\ndence is needed however to see whether these findings\nexist in other studies. In addition, since a simple count of\nthe number of symptoms experienced by individuals is a\ncrude measure with limitations, further work is needed to\ninvestigate whether this relationship is stronger for more\ndetailed symptom measures.\nIn order to explore this we examined, in a UK cohort\nstudy, the associations between type and number of\nsymptoms and mortality. We were particularly interested\nin investigating the relationship between the burden of\nsymptoms with different impact and mortality. We\nhypothesised that summary measures of symptom experi-\nence, which take into account the number of symptoms\nexperienced, any tendency to have the symptoms and any\nimpact on functioning, would be better predictors of mor-\ntality than simple counts of symptoms. In addition, since\nself-assessed health has been found to be a strong predic-\ntor of morbidity and mortality in previous studies [12,13],\nwe also examined the relationship between self-assessed\nhealth and mortality to see if the relationship is mediated\nthrough symptoms.\nMethods\nParticipants and procedures\nThe data were from the Regional sample of the West of\nScotland Twenty-07 study, a longitudinal study of health\namongst three cohorts, aged 15, 35 and 55 when first\nstudied in 1987\/88 (see elsewhere for full details) [14-16].\nIn brief, in order to get a representative sample of people\nin each age group a two stage sampling strategy was used.\nThe sampling frame was the 1986 Voluntary Population\nSurvey, an enhanced electoral register with details of\nnames, sex and ages of all household members main-\ntained by Strathclyde Regional Council (SRC). For ethical\nreasons SRC required written consent from potential par-\nticipants to forward their names to the MRC for possible\ninclusion in the study. The University of Glasgow Ethics\nCommittee for non-clinical research approved the West of\nScotland Twenty-07 study.\nHere we use data on the 55 year old cohort as there are few\ndeaths to date in the younger cohort. For the 55 year old\ncohort 2155 people were approached by SRC and 1196\n(55%) gave written consent to have their name trans-\nferred. Of these, 1042 (87%) agreed to participate in the\nstudy when approached. The cohort was first followed up\nin 1991 when 858 (82%) of the original 1042 men and\nwomen were interviewed at around 58 years of age. This\ncontact included more detail on symptoms (such as\nwhether or not activities were limited by the symptom)\nthan the baseline survey.\nMeasures\nDuring a nurse-led interview conducted in participants'\nhomes, individuals were asked whether they had experi-\nenced any of 33 listed symptoms (including respiratory\/\nENT, musculo-skeletal, gastrointestinal, mental health,\nneurological, systemic (general) and other symptoms:\nTable 1). These symptoms were presented to participants\non cards listing up to six symptoms at a time. Participants\nwere asked whether they had experienced each symptom\nin the last month and whether it was a symptom they\ntended to have (i.e. one that they experienced often). For\neach symptom experienced in the last month participants\nwere also asked whether it had caused them to cut down\non their usual activities, and whether they had consulted\na general practitioner for this occurrence of that symptom.\nSelf-reports of longstanding chronic conditions were elic-\nited using an extended version of the question used in the\nUK General Household Survey [17,18]. Each condition\nwas coded to a condition group (International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases chapter heading) according to the British\nRoyal College of General Practitioners coding scheme\n[19]. Self-assessed health in the previous year was meas-\nured using the question: \"In the last year how would you\nrate your general health \u2013 excellent, good, fair or poor?\" A\nwide range of personal and social information was also\ncollected including gender; occupational social class\n(non-manual, manual); housing tenure (owned\/mort-\ngaged, rented from council\/housing association, privately\nrented and other); car ownership (no, yes); Carstairs dep-Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:158 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/158rivation category (1\u20132 (least deprived), 3\u20135, 6\u20137 (most\ndeprived))[20]; and smoking status (never, ex, current).\nDeath notifications\nParticipants in the West of Scotland Twenty-07 Study were\n'flagged' at the National Health Service central registries in\nScotland and England at the start of the study in 1987\/88.\nAt regular intervals the study is notified of the date and\ncause of any deaths occurring in the cohort.\nData analysis\nThe data were analysed using SPSS for Windows. Deaths\noccurring in the cohort up to the end of May 2004 were\nincluded in the analysis and used to calculate hazard\nratios for thirteen-year all cause mortality. In order to\nidentify which factors were unadjustedly associated with\nmortality, unadjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confi-\ndence intervals were calculated for: gender; occupational\nsocial class; housing tenure; car ownership; deprivation\ncategory; smoking status; presence of a musculoskeletal\ncondition; presence of a respiratory condition; presence of\na digestive condition; presence of a cardiovascular condi-\ntion; presence of a mental health condition; the total\nnumber of chronic conditions suffered and self-assessed\nhealth.\nIn order to examine the association between type of symp-\ntom (respiratory\/ENT, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal,\nmental health, neurological, and systemic) and mortality,\nunadjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence inter-\nvals were calculated for each symptom type, using absence\nof such symptoms as the referent group in each case. Cox\nregression was then used to adjust these hazard ratios for\npotential confounding from gender, socio-economic sta-\ntus, smoking, chronic conditions, and self-assessed\nhealth. We did not adjust for all of our measures of socio-\neconomic status, since these measures were highly corre-\nlated. We used housing tenure only as the measure of\nsocio-economic status in our adjustments.\nIn order to examine the association between number of\nsymptoms and mortality, symptoms were categorised into\nfive symptom summary measures: total number of symp-\ntoms experienced in the last month; number of symptoms\nexperienced in the last month which participants tended\nto have; number of symptoms experienced in the last\nmonth which participants did not tend to have; number\nof symptoms experienced in the last month which\nresulted in cutting down on usual activities; and number\nof symptoms experienced in the last month which\nresulted in consulting a general practitioner. Within each\nsummary measure, symptoms were aggregated so that\nindividuals were categorised as having at baseline (1991)\n0, 1, 2, 3\u20135, or \u2265 6 such symptoms (this division was made\nto ensure we had adequate numbers of individuals in each\ncategory). The exception to this approach occurred for the\nsymptom summary measure indicating the number of\nsymptoms experienced in the last month which partici-\npants did not tend to have, where individuals were aggre-\ngated as having at baseline 0, 1, 2, \u2265 3 such symptoms\nbecause of the small numbers of people with higher\nsymptom counts in this summary measure. Unadjusted\nhazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were cal-\nculated for different levels within each symptom sum-\nmary measure, using absence of such symptoms as the\nreferent group in each case. Cox regression was then used\nto adjust these hazard ratios for potential confounding.\nIn order to examine the association between self-assessed\nhealth and mortality, unadjusted hazard ratios were calcu-\nTable 1: List of 33 symptoms inquired about as part of the West \nof Scotland Twenty-07 study*\nRespiratory\/ENT symptoms\nColds or flu\nPersistent cough\nPalpitations or breathlessness\nSinus, catarrh or blocked nose\nSore throat\nWheezy chest\nMusculoskeletal symptoms\nSore or stiff back\nStiff or painful joints\nMuscle tightness or tension\nGastro-intestinal symptoms\nConstipation\nStomach pain or cramps\nDiarrhoea\nIndigestion\nPoor appetite\nSickness or nausea\nPiles or haemorrhoids\nMental health symptoms\nDifficulty sleeping\nNerves or tension\nDifficulty concentrating\nWorrying over every little thing\nFeeling depressed\nNeurological symptoms\nHeadaches\nTrembling hands\nFainting or dizziness\nSystemic (general) symptoms\nFeeling generally run down\nAlways feeling tired\nHot and sweating a lot\nCold sweats\nOther symptoms\nTrouble with ears\nTrouble with eyes\nSkin rash or skin problems\nTrouble with teeth or mouth\nKidney or bladder problems\n*Symptoms were not presented to participants in this order or in \nthese groupingsPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:158 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/158lated for poor, fair and good health, with excellent health\nas the referent group. Hazard ratios were then adjusted for\npotential confounding from gender, socio-economic sta-\ntus, smoking, chronic conditions, and total number of\nsymptoms in the last month.\nResults\nA total of 170 deaths (19.8 percent of the cohort) occurred\nin the cohort in the thirteen years between 1991 and\n2004. Most deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease\n(n = 62) or cancer (n = 56). Women were significantly less\nlikely to have died than men, and car owners were signif-\nicantly less likely to have died than those not owning a car\n(Table 2). Individuals in manual occupations, those who\nrented their house from the council or a housing associa-\ntion, those in higher deprivation categories and smokers\nwere all significantly more likely to have died than those\nin the referent group for each variable.\nIndividuals with cardiovascular and respiratory condi-\ntions were more likely to have died than people without\nthese conditions (Table 3). The presence of musculoskel-\netal, digestive or mental health conditions did not appear\nto affect mortality. There was a strong association between\nnumber of reported chronic conditions and mortality. A\nclear trend was seen between self-assessed health and\nmortality, with mortality increasing as self-assessed health\nbecame poorer (Table 3).\nThe most commonly reported symptoms in the last\nmonth were stiff or painful joints (38.8%), difficulty\nsleeping (29.7%), headaches (25.8%), back trouble\n(23.1%) and always feeling tired (21.9%). For further\ndetails on symptom prevalence see elsewhere [8]. Table 4\nshows the hazard ratios for thirteen-year all cause mortal-\nity by type of symptom. On unadjusted analysis partici-\npants with respiratory\/ENT, mental health or systemic\nsymptoms had a significantly higher mortality risk than\nthose not reporting such symptoms.

This find-\ning suggests that the presence of mental health symptoms\nhas important implications for subsequent health. On\nunadjusted analysis, and after adjusting for gender, socio-\neconomic status and smoking, mortality was elevated in\nindividuals reporting many (\u2265 6) symptoms for four of\nthe five symptom summary measures examined, suggest-\ning that the presence of many symptoms (of different fre-\nquency and severity) in late mid-life predicts subsequent\nmortality. The absence of any association among individ-\nuals reporting symptoms in the last month that they did\nnot tend to have highlights the importance of considering\nthe tendency to have and\/or impact of symptoms rather\nthan simple symptom counts. After additional adjustment\nfor chronic conditions and self-assessed health in the last\nyear none of the associations between symptom groups\nand mortality remained statistically significant.\nComparison with existing literature\nFew studies have examined the relationship between type\nof symptoms and mortality in community populations,\ntending, when done, to focus on respiratory and depres-\nsive symptoms. A significant relationship between respira-\ntory symptoms (such as breathlessness, wheeze and\ncough) and all-cause mortality has consistently been\nfound in previous population studies, even after adjust-\nment for confounding factors [21-25]. Our findings are\nbroadly in line with these previous studies, although our\nassociation with mortality was lost after adjustment for\nthe presence of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions\nand self-assessed health. Less consistent results have been\nfound in population studies assessing the relationship\nbetween mental health symptoms and mortality. Vogt et\nal. [26] reported no relationship.

However, after additional adjustments for\nsocio-economic status, lifestyle behaviours, functional\nlimitations and chronic health conditions the relation-\nship was eliminated. Wulsin et al. [28] found that all-\ncause mortality was directly associated with depressive\nsymptoms, with higher mortality risks as depressive symp-\ntom scores increased. Our findings support Wulsin et al.\nand highlight that mental health symptoms may be\nimportant independent predictors of subsequent mortal-\nity in late mid-life.\nOnly one previous study has investigated the reporting of\nsymptom burden in relation to mortality [11]. As part of\na multi-centre study in the USA looking at 12 physical\nsymptoms in 3498 adults aged 60 and over, Sha et al.\nfound that individuals with higher symptom scores were\nsignificantly more likely to have died over the subsequent\nyear than individuals with no or few symptoms. These\nresults remained significant even after adjustment for age,\nsex, race, chronic conditions, self-assessed health, depres-\nsion and anxiety. Our findings are broadly in line with\nSha et al's, showing a two- to three- fold increase in mor-\ntality with increasing number of total symptoms reported\nwhen examined unadjustedly or after adjustment for\nsocio-economic factors. Unlike Sha et al, however, our\nassociations were smaller and no longer statistically sig-\nnificant after adjustment for self-assessed health. We\nexamined a different, smaller population and different\nsymptoms over a longer time period. Sha et al examined a\nsmaller range of (physical only) symptoms, used simpler\nnumeric summaries and did not include any measure of\ntheir impact. On the other hand, some of the symptoms\nthey examined might be considered more serious (e.g.\nchest pain) than those examined in our study and this\nmay explain why Sha et al. found a stronger relationship\nbetween symptoms and mortality than we did. In addi-\ntion, they studied an older cohort of individuals (mean\nage at baseline 69 compared to 58 years in our study).\nSelf-reported symptoms can arise from a variety of causes,\nincluding the early stages of disease which has yet to be\ndetected, self-limiting minor illnesses which have no\nimportant long-term consequences, or from a known\nlong-standing condition. The underlying mix of causes is\nlikely to differ substantially with age; with older age\ngroups more likely to have a higher percentage of symp-\ntoms related to chronic, serious or undetected conditions.\nIn our study, self-assessed health was strongly associated\nwith mortality. This finding is in line with previous\nresearch, which has reported a two to seven fold increase\nin mortality among those with poor compared with excel-\nlent self-assessed health, after adjusting for clinical and\nmedical history measures [12,13]. Our findings suggest\nthat self-assessed health in the last year may be a better\npredictor of future mortality than the number of symp-\ntoms experienced, even when the tendency to have and\nimpact of these symptoms are taken into account. When\nassessing their own health individuals are likely to take\ninto account a range of factors such as medical health sta-\ntus, functional ability, physical fitness, experience of\nsymptoms, psycho-social well-being, lifestyle and health\nbehaviours [29,30]. A measure of symptom burden may\nbe a sub-component of self-assessed health and therefore\nless able to predict mortality.\nStrengths and limitations of this study\nStrengths of this study were its population-based design,\nthe large number and range of symptoms covered and the\ndetailed social information collected. The study was able\nto examine underlying morbidity in terms of self-reported\nsymptoms, chronic conditions and self-assessed health.\nAlthough we had a relatively small number of partici-\npants, we had a long period of follow-up, enabling us to\nlook at subsequent mortality over a 13-year period. This\nwas a longer follow-up than in previous research [11] and\nresulted in a larger number of deaths available for analy-\nsis, thereby increasing statistical power (although there\nwere insufficient data to permit cause-specific mortality\nanalyses). An important limitation was the fact that\nalthough we asked about a large number of symptoms\n(over 30), most were largely minor, self-limiting in\nnature. Different relationships may have been found if we\nhad included more serious symptoms (e.g. chest pain,\nweight loss etc). In addition, the analyses were based on\nself-reported data, which were not cross-checked with\nmedical records. The experience of symptoms however, is\nby definition subjective and many of the symptoms (and\nsome of the longstanding chronic conditions) will not\nhave been presented to general practice, hampering\nattempts to validate the self-reported symptoms against\nmedical records. Participants in the analyses were all aged\naround 58 years at the time of interview. As already high-\nlighted it is likely that different age groups will report dif-\nferent numbers of symptoms and chronic conditions. It is\nalso likely that their perceived self-assessed health will be\ndifferent, as indicated by previous studies [31-33].\nWhether symptom experience is related to mortality in\nother age groups, and whether self-assessed health would\nremain a stronger predictor of mortality than symptoms\nneeds to be tested in other studies. Finally, our measures\nof symptom experience and self-assessed health had dif-\nferent time reference points (last month and last year\nrespectively). It is noteworthy that self-assessed health\nover the last year appeared to be a stronger predictor of\nmortality than symptoms experienced in the previous\nmonth.\nConclusion\nThis study has shown that symptoms often thought of as\n'minor' or self-limiting may have important consequences\nlater in life, especially for those reporting mental-healthPage 8 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:158 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/158related symptoms or those experiencing many symptoms.\nFurther work is needed to ascertain how best to help\nhealth-care professionals differentiate between symptoms\nwhich have serious outcomes and those which do not.\nOur observation that a single question about self-assessed\nhealth is a better predictor of mortality than various com-\nbinations of symptom experience points towards more\nresearch into understanding the utility of this measure.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAME was involved in the conception and design of this\npiece of work, performed the statistical analysis, was\ninvolved in the interpretation of the work and drafted the\nmanuscript.
