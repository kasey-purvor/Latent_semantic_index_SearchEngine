An-\nswering this question could help us to better understand not only the trajectory of\nEuropean unification, but also the conditions and prospects of consensual political\nintegration in other regional contexts and territorial scales+ The main research tradi-\ntions in international relations theory suggest different explanations+ I examine the\nroles of relative power capabilities, foreign policy interests, Europeanized identities,\nand domestic multilevel governance in determining the preferences of the fifteen EU\nmember governments concerning the institutional depth of their foreign and security\npolicy cooperation+ I find that power capabilities and collective identities have a sig-\nnificant influence, but the effect of ideas about the nature and locus of sovereignty,\nas reflected in the domestic constitution of each country, is particularly remarkable+\nWhat can induce the governments of independent states to relinquish one of their\nmost cherished possessions, that is, the right and the ability to act on the inter-\nnational stage according to their own judgment and preferences? This question is\nparticularly pressing in a time when international interdependence is widely per-\nceived as expanding and intensifying+ As long as states remain central actors in\nworld affairs, the possibility of solving common problems and seizing mutually\nbeneficial opportunities depends crucially on their willingness to cooperate and\u2014in\nthe view of many\u2014to go beyond cooperation toward deeper forms of suprana-\ntional political integration+\nBlueprints for the creation of global political structures face the problem that,\nas things stand, transcending the present state-centric world would require the con-\nsent of the leaders of the states themselves+ Certainly this is one of the reasons\nA previous version of this article was presented at the 4th ECPR Pan-European International Rela-\ntions Conference, Canterbury, 8\u201310 September 2001+ For their valuable comments, I would like to\nthank Filippo Andreatta, Daniele Archibugi, Simone Borra, Nicola Dunbar, Fabio Franchino, Alkuin\nK\u00f6lliker, Leonardo Morlino, Angelo Panebianco, Eiko Thielemann, Ben Tonra, the editors of IO, and\nthree anonymous reviewers+ I am responsible for any mistakes+\nInternational Organization 58, Winter 2004, pp+ 137\u2013174\n\u00a9 2004 by The IO Foundation+ DOI: 10+10170S0020818304581055\nwhy the consensual merging of states has been such a rare phenomenon+ How-\never, even the greatest pessimists cannot deny that in history, there have been in-\nstances of unification among states that resulted from a voluntary agreement among\ntheir leaders: the United States is a prominent example+ This fact brings one back\nto the question mentioned at the beginning: why should governments of sovereign\nstates wish to limit their freedom of action to the point of merging with other\nstates within larger governmental structures?\nThis article aims to offer a contribution to this sweeping question by examin-\ning the preferences of specific governments on a specific issue in a specific histor-\nical moment+ The governments are those of European Union ~EU! member-states,\nthe issue is the creation of a supranational foreign and security policy, and the\nmoment is the 1990s+ Of course, given the vast differences between the EU and\nother settings, it is not part of my argument that the results of the following in-\nquiry can be easily generalized to other regional contexts or even to questions of\nglobal political integration+ However, it seems plausible to think that a realistic\nanalysis of international polity formation requires, as a preliminary step, a certain\nnumber of empirical investigations of analogous processes at the macroregional\nlevel+\nIn this article I assess various factors that might plausibly explain a govern-\nment\u2019s willingness to pool and delegate sovereignty+ Because the importance of\neach factor examined here is emphasized by a different school of international\nrelations theory, this article can also be seen as a contribution to the assessment of\nthe empirical accuracy of various contending or complementary perspectives within\nthe discipline+\nThe first section of this article specifies the terms and the relevance of the re-\nsearch question+ The second section presents a number of potential explanations\nof the willingness of

summarizes the findings and their\nimplications for current debates in international relations theory+\nEuropean Foreign Policy as a Contested Institution\nThe differences between European integration in the economic domain on the one\nhand and integration in security affairs on the other are often emphasized by pol-\nicymakers and scholars alike+ Market-building policies and some market-correcting\n138 International Organization\npolicies are governed according to what has become known as the \u201cCommunity\nmethod,\u201d that is, a complex set of institutional rules and practices that ensure a\nprominent role for supranational agencies and a high level of legalization+ In for-\neign and security policy, on the contrary, supranational institutions have little or\nno power, and the obligations laid upon governments are vague or frequently ig-\nnored+1 This seems to confirm the skepticism about functional spillovers that Stan-\nley Hoffmann voiced almost forty years ago: \u201cWhen the functions are concerned\nwith the ineffable and intangible issues of Grosspolitik, when grandeur and pres-\ntige, rank and security, domination and dependence are at stake, we are fully within\nthe realm of traditional interstate politics+\u201d2\nTo many international relations scholars, the relatively feeble state of foreign\npolicy integration is far from surprising+ Foreign and security policies are pivotal\nto state sovereignty, and for these authors, sovereignty\u2014understood as the sur-\nvival of the state as a distinct political entity in world affairs\u2014is a \u201cgood\u201d that\nstates value over all others+ According to John J+ Mearsheimer, \u201cthe most basic\nmotive driving states is survival+ States want to maintain their sovereignty+\u201d3 If\nstates are assumed to be \u201cunitary actors who, at a minimum, seek their own pres-\nervation and, at a maximum, drive for universal domination,\u201d4 then the absence of\nconsensual political and military integration in Western Europe is easily under-\nstandable+ Even if one allows political integration in exceptional circumstances,\nsuch as massive external threats or unique opportunities for territorial expansion,5\nit can be argued that in Western Europe the benefits of an integrated foreign and\nmilitary policy never outweighed the costs in terms of sovereignty+\nWhile this perspective has some empirical merit, it neglects a crucial aspect of\nthe Western European experience: there was, and still is, considerable variation in\nthe preferences of governments concerning foreign policy integration+ The opti-\nmal level of political unification in the EU is a matter of intense controversy not\nonly among its citizens, but also among its member governments+ In the light of\nthese controversies, any interpretation of foreign and security policy integration\nthat assumes a uniform concern for sovereignty and ignores differences between\ngovernment preferences is bound to remain inadequate+\nThe institutional trajectory of European integration is decided mainly during\nIntergovernmental Conferences ~IGCs!, which since the 1980s have taken place\napproximately every five years+ These conferences produce \u201cgrand bargains,\u201d whose\nterms are generally written into the basic treaties of the EU+ European govern-\nments have expressed divergent positions on the form and depth of foreign and\n1+ Until 1993 the institutional arrangements for foreign policy coordination among EU member-\nstates were known as European Political Cooperation ~EPC!+ Since the Maastricht Treaty, they have\nbeen called Common Foreign and Security Policy ~CFSP!+\n2+ Hoffmann 1965, 88+\n3+ Mearsheimer 1994095, 10+\n4+ Waltz

instance, during the IGC of 1996\u201397, which led to the Amster-\ndam Treaty, EU foreign ministers or their personal representatives met on more\nthan twenty different occasions to discuss possible revisions of the Maastricht Treaty\nprovisions pertaining to the Common Foreign and Security Policy ~CFSP! and the\ndefense policy of the Union+ In this time, dozens of position papers, nonpapers,\nand draft treaty articles on the CFSP were presented and discussed by ministers\nand officials+6 Moreover, the Amsterdam Treaty negotiations were relatively sim-\nple compared to those that generated the foreign and security provisions of the\nMaastricht Treaty in the 1990\u201391 IGC, which occurred in the uncertain inter-\nnational context that followed the end of the Cold War+7 Those fierce negotiations\non European treaty reform reflect the existence of significant disagreements among\ngovernments about the depth of integration in foreign and security policy, and\nmake clear that the CFSP is a \u201ccontested institution+\u201d8\nTable 1 offers a synoptic presentation of these disagreements, with reference to\nthe main treaty revisions on CFSP that were considered in the IGC of 1996\u201397+\nFor each revision, the table indicates the position expressed by each member-state\nduring the prenegotiation phase+ If implemented, these treaty revisions would have\nmeant a higher level of sovereignty pooling or sovereignty delegation in the insti-\ntutional structure of the EU+9 Sovereignty pooling occurs when states agree to take\ncollectively binding decisions without the possibility of national veto+ In the con-\ntext of the 1996\u201397 IGC, to pool sovereignty meant to allow qualified majority\nvoting ~QMV! in the Council of Ministers for all

scope\u201d\nof the EU, to use Lindberg and Scheingold\u2019s 1970 terminology+ During the 1990s, most of the coun-\ntries that demanded a supranational CFSP also wanted the inclusion of defense among the competen-\ncies of the EU, and vice versa+ However, the sets of countries supporting the two reforms ~increasing\nthe depth of integration and extending it to defense issues! do not coincide perfectly+ This is mainly\nbecause of France\u2019s position, which was and is strongly supportive of a European defense identity but\nis opposed to supranational decision making for defense as well as for the CFSP+ As remarked by a\nFrench member of the European Parliament, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, France wants a strong Europe, as\ndo the Germans, but with weak institutions, as do the British ~quoted in Agence Europe 6507, 23 June\n1995!+ Since 1998, the British government has no longer opposed a defense role for the EU, but\u2014as\nwith France\u2014the United Kingdom has retained its hostility toward supranational procedures, as op-\nposed to intergovernmental decision making+ The resulting convergence of the preferences of France\nand Britain has made possible the recent progress in creating a European Security and Defence Policy\non an intergovernmental basis+ Furthermore, during the 1990\u201391 IGC, the Netherlands had the oppo-\nsite combination of preferences as France: it supported a federal foreign policy but opposed the devel-\nopment of a European defense+ In sum, national positions on the two dimensions do not coincide\nperfectly, and this article examines only the issue of the institutional depth of CFSP+\n140 International Organization\nTABLE 1.

The next section reviews various possible answers to this puzzle+\nPossible Explanatory Factors: Interests, Capabilities,\nIdentities, and Constitutional Cultures\nThere are several research programs in international relations theory, and each of\nthem stresses one particular set of factors as especially useful for explaining for-\neign and security policies in general and supranational integration in particular+\nWhile it is often assumed that foreign policy decisions require multicausal expla-\nnations, there is little clarity about when the predictions of different theoretical\napproaches should be seen as complementary and when they are competing+ In\nthis article I consider a number of explanatory factors that have been highlighted\nby different theoretical traditions, without trying to determine ex ante how their\neffects might be combined in each particular case+\nBroadly speaking, international institution-building can be interpreted from two\nperspectives+ The first assumes that governments have a purely instrumental atti-\ntude toward international institutions+According to this instrumentalist approach,10\ninstitutions in general and specific aspects of institutional design are not valued\nper se, but only as means to attain exogenously defined goals+ Institutions not only\nset constraints to strategic action, but they are themselves the object and outcome\nof strategic action+ From the second perspective, the preferences of governments\nfor certain institutions are not based primarily on their anticipated capacity to pro-\nduce well-defined outcomes, but on their coherence with entrenched beliefs and\nnormative commitments+ In a sense, each of the two approaches stresses a distinct\nlogic of action: a logic of expected consequences or a logic of appropriateness+11\nIn this section I derive from these perspectives several more specific hypotheses\nconcerning the CFSP+\nIn the instrumentalist perspective, the fact that governments prefer different in-\nstitutional arrangements can be explained in reference to their varying interests or\ntheir varying resources+ This consideration forms the basis for selecting the first\n10+ Gourevitch 1999, 142+\n11+ March and Olsen 1998+\n142 International Organization\ntwo causal factors that will be considered in the examination of institution-building\nin CFSP+\nThe first causal factor to be considered is the congruence between the antici-\npated outcomes of a supranational foreign policy on the one hand, and each gov-\nernment\u2019s interests in world affairs on the other+ The importance of this factor is\nstressed by rational institutionalism,12 which distinguishes preferences regarding\nsubstantive policy issues ~or policy preferences! from preferences regarding insti-\ntutional forms ~or constitutional preferences! and explains the latter in terms of\nthe former+ Governments support or oppose the introduction of certain institu-\ntional and procedural rules depending on whether they believe that these rules\nwill produce outcomes corresponding to their exogenously determined interests or\nnot+13\nIn the context of CFSP, EU governments have preferences regarding a number\nof issues of world politics and can be expected to support those institutional forms\nthat make their preferred outcome more likely to happen+ According to rational\ninstitutionalism, the main determinant of a government\u2019s opposition to supra-\nnational institutions in CFSP should be its concern that, once they are intro-\nduced, the EU would make decisions that frequently run against the preferences\nof that government on particular international issues+ Specifically, with regard to\nsovereignty pooling, the concern is that the government might often be outvoted\nin the Council of Ministers+ With regard to sovereignty delegation, a government\nmight be concerned that on specific policy questions, the supranational agencies\nwould be more responsive to the preferences of a majority of member-states while\nthe government itself is in a minority position+\nSupranational integration implies the abolition of the national veto, and this might\nbe especially difficult to accept for governments whose preferences can be ex-\npected to often be at odds with the view of the majority\u2014that is, for preference\noutliers+ Rational institutionalism expects that ~1! the more a government fears to\nbe outvoted, the less likely it is to accept supranational integration, and ~2! the\nfear to be outvoted depends mainly on the extent to which its policy preferences\nconform to, or depart from, the expected policy preferences of a majority of gov-\nernments+ In this analysis, this aspect is called \u201cpolicy conformity+\u201d\nWhen choosing institutional rules, of course, governments cannot know for cer-\ntain what their policy preferences and those of the other governments will be once\nthe rules are operative+ However, it would be implausible to think that govern-\nments choose rules behind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d: because issues in world politics\ndisplay a certain degree of continuity, the governments\u2019 knowledge about past and\n12+ See Keohane 1984; Martin 1992; Moravcsik 1998, 67\u201377; and Br\u00e4uninger and K\u00f6nig 2000+\n13+ See Garrett and Tsebelis 1996; Gourevitch 1999; and Br\u00e4uninger et al+ 2001, 49+ Strictly speak-\ning, constitutional preferences depend on interests as well as beliefs about how institutions will affect\noutcomes\u2014\u201ctheories,\u201d in the terminology of Vanberg and Buchanan 1989+ This second aspect does\nnot receive separate consideration in this article, because it can plausibly be assumed that govern-\nments do not have different beliefs about the operation of existing or possible EU institutions+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 143\ncurrent preferences is sufficient to form reasonable expectations about future pol-\nicy preferences+ Hence the first hypothesis to be tested is the following:\nH1: Governments that expect to be outliers with respect to policy preferences will\nbe less supportive of supranational integration in the foreign and security field\nthan governments with a high level of expected policy conformity+\nThe second causal factor to be considered in this article is also connected to a\nconsequentialist approach to international politics, but this approach stresses dif-\nferences in resources rather than differences in interests+14 Realist scholars in in-\nternational relations are less interested in the specific content and variation of policy\npreferences than in the means states have to obtain what they want+ While realism\ncomes in many variants, all of them hold that the distribution of power capabili-\nties among states is a crucial determinant of their behavior+15 A corollary is that\ndifferences in the behavior of states can be explained mainly by looking at their\nrelative position in the state system+\nSome realist authors, as I have pointed out in the previous section, make as-\nsumptions about state goals that are incompatible with the demonstrated willing-\nness of various European governments to deepen their foreign and security policy\nintegration+ Other variants of realism, however, do not rule out the possibility of\nvoluntary integration, but seek to explain it by referring to the distribution of power\namong states+ In particular, Joseph Grieco has suggested a \u201cneorealist\u201d interpreta-\ntion of the EU\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union, according to which the institu-\ntional arrangement agreed upon at Maastricht reflects the interest of France and\nItaly in gaining \u201cvoice opportunities\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis Germany for determining mon-\netary policy in Europe+ Grieco\u2019s thesis is that, \u201cespecially for weaker but still sa-\nlient states, institutionalization might constitute an effective second-best solution\nto the problem of working with, but not being dominated by, a stronger partner in\nthe context of mutually beneficial joint action ~the first-best solution would be to\nbecome more powerful and thus be on more equal terms with the stronger partner,\nor perhaps even not to require cooperation!+\u201d16\nRealist theory leads to the expectation that the international distribution of power\naffects each government\u2019s interest in a common foreign and security policy in a\ndifferent way+ More specifically, governments whose power resources allow them\nto conduct an independent and effective foreign policy should see no need to re-\nlinquish their autonomy and have their hands tied by supranational institutions+\nWeaker countries, on the contrary, should be interested in an integrated foreign\n14+ Hasenclever et al+ 1997+\n15+ See Waltz 1979; and Legro and Moravcsik 1998+\n16+ Grieco 1996, 289+ A similar argument with regard to European defense cooperation is presented\nby Art 1996+\n144 International Organization\nand security policy for at least two reasons+ First, these countries can expect their\ninfluence on world affairs to increase when the EU acts as a unit+ The autonomy\nthey would lose would be offset by the collective power of the supranational pol-\nity of which they are a part+ Second, a tight institutional structure would be a way\nto constrain the stronger member-states, whose independent foreign policy might\nbecome a threat to the interests of the smaller countries in the future+ By this logic,\nsupranational integration enhances the security of smaller states by augmenting\ntheir external influence and by constraining potential sources of tension+\nThe hypothesis deriving from realism\u2019s emphasis on relative power resources is\nthus the following:\nH2: Governments with higher power capabilities will be less supportive of supra-\nnational integration in foreign and security matters than governments with lower\ncapabilities+\nBoth explanatory factors considered so far\u2014policy preferences and relative\ncapabilities\u2014suppose an instrumental and calculating attitude toward European\ninstitution-building in foreign and security matters+ The other two factors consid-\nered in this article reflect a logic of appropriateness rather than of consequences+\nIn international relations theory, this logic is generally emphasized by constructiv-\nism, which regards identities, culture, and norms as independent determinants of\nthe behavior of actors in the international system+ Some constructivists emphasize\nthe processes of identity formation and transformation that derive from inter-\nactions among states,17 while others point to how the identities, values, and cul-\ntural attitudes of domestic social groups affect the behavior of their governments+18\nThe constructivist hypotheses considered in the rest of this article belong to the\nlatter version of constructivism, which examines the domestic determinants of in-\nternational behavior and thus takes a \u201cbottom-up\u201d perspective+\nWhether constructivists stress the systemic or the domestic sources of state iden-\ntity formation, they all hold that \u201cvariation in state identity, or changes in state\nidentity, affect the national security interests or policies of states+\u201d19 Furthermore,\n\u201cchanges in the collective identity of societal actors transform the interests of rel-\nevant collective actors that constitute the @international# system+\u201d20 Constructiv-\nists have described the changes in collective identities and values that occurred in\nEurope since the Middle Ages, and have argued that these developments substan-\n17+ Alexander Wendt is one such systemic constructivist, who nonetheless acknowledges that \u201ccer-\ntainly a complete theory of state identity would have a substantial domestic component+\u201d Wendt 1999,\n28+\n18+ This approach has been called liberal constructivism\u2014see Risse-Kappen 1996\u2014or ideational\nliberalism\u2014see Moravcsik 1997+\n19+ Jepperson et al+ 1996, 52+\n20+ Hall 1999, 5 ~italics omitted!+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 145\ntially altered the way governments related to their external environment+21 For in-\nstance, Rodney Bruce Hall has argued that the nineteenth-century transition from\na legitimating principle based on territorial sovereignty to the principles of na-\ntional sovereignty and self-determination transformed the interests and practices\nof states+22\nMany think that since World War II, a further shift in collective identities has\noccurred in Europe, as nationalism has declined significantly among West Euro-\npean publics+23 According to some authors, this decline is part of a general trend\ntoward the endorsement of postmaterialist values+24 Many observers of European\naffairs hold that European integration \u201chas been accompanied by a weakening of\nexclusive nationalism and by what might be described as multiple identity, that is,\nthe coexistence of identities to local, regional, and supranational territorial com-\nmunities, alongside an identity with the nation+\u201d25\nAsserting that a common European identity is progressively developing in West-\nern Europe is not incompatible with the recognition of substantial differences among\ncountries in this dimension+ European identity formation can be promoted or hin-\ndered by a number of factors, both at the individual and collective level+ The latter\nmight include a diversity of historical experiences, especially those related to wars,\nand geographical features of countries, such as peripheral location or insularity+\nThese differences can affect the degree to which collective identities are\nEuropeanized+\nConstructivists argue that the attitude of national government vis-\u00e0-vis Euro-\npean integration is shaped by the way their populations or their elites relate them-\nselves to Europe+ A widespread perception of belonging to a European entity, in\naddition to\u2014or even as a substitute for\u2014national belonging, is considered a ma-\njor determinant of government policies on supranational integration+26 A strong\ndegree of European identity promotes the perception that authority is \u201cshared\u201d\nwith other Europeans rather than \u201clost\u201d to foreigners, and thus facilitates the trans-\nfer of competencies to the supranational level+\nGenerally speaking, collective identities might affect government policies to-\nward European treaty reform through two types of causal mechanism+ In the first,\nmembers of the political elite make choices on European political integration on\nthe basis of their identities+ In the second, members of the general public form\n21+ See Hall 1999; Reus-Smith 1999; Cronin 1999; and Philpott 2001+ According to Reus-Smith,\n\u201c@c#ulturally and historically contingent beliefs about what constitutes a \u2018civilized\u2019 state, and how such\nstates ought to solve cooperation problems, exert a far greater influence on basic institutional practices\nthan do material structural conditions, the strategic imperatives of particular cooperation problems, or\nthe stabilization of territorial property rights+\u201d Reus-Smith 1997, 583+\n22+ Hall 1999+\n23+ Dogan 1994+\n24+ Inglehart 1990, 408\u201314+\n25+ Hooghe and Marks 2001,

of their identities, and\npolitical elites engaged in political competition adjust their stance toward the EU\nto what they perceive are the preferences of their potential voters+ In the first case,\nidentities influence policy directly; in the second case, their influence on policy is\nmediated by instrumental interests+ In reality, it is plausible to assume that the two\ncausal mechanisms tend to operate simultaneously, generating various patterns of\ninteraction+ As Thomas Risse notes, \u201c@p#olitical elites ~including party elites! try\nto promote ideas ~including identity constructions! with an eye on gaining power\nor remaining in government+\u201d27 Political elites are constrained by public opinion,\nbut the latter is malleable to the discourses propagated by the former, as research\non public and elite support for European integration has shown+28\nThe hypothesis deriving from the constructivist emphasis on collective identi-\nties is the following:\nH3: Governments of countries with strong [mass\/elite] identification with \u201cEurope\u201d\nwill be more supportive of supranational integration in foreign and security pol-\nicy than governments of countries with less European identification+\nThe text in brackets indicates that two versions of the hypothesis should be tested:\none concerning the general public and the other concerning elite identities+\nThe balance between national and European identity may not be the only com-\nponent of political culture that affects the willingness to create supranational po-\nlitical structures+ Ideas about how the exercise of public authority is best organized\nmight also exert an influence+ Some scholars believe that \u201cwhere states have an\nopportunity, they will seek to create international rules and institutions that are\nconsistent with domestic principles of political order+\u201d29 For instance, Daniel Deud-\nney has hypothesized that, when polities with multiple centers of authority\u2014or\n\u201cPhiladelphian systems\u201d\u2014cannot avoid interacting with other polities, they find a\npolicy of \u201cbinding\u201d\u2014that is, a reciprocal limitation of autonomy by means of in-\nstitutional links\u2014more \u201ccongenial\u201d than balance-of-power practices+30 Similarly,\nAnne-Marie Burley has argued that post\u2013World War II multilateral institutions are\nprojections of the U+S+ New Deal regulatory state+31 Some proponents of the \u201cdem-\nocratic peace\u201d thesis argue that democratic states tend to \u201cexport\u201d the principle of\npeaceful conflict resolution when dealing with each other+32\nIn the context of the EU, it has been noted that adaptation to supranational in-\ntegration is easier for some countries than for others+ In particular, the institu-\ntional structures of the EU strongly resemble those of the Federal Republic of\n27+ Risse 2001, 202\u20133+\n28+ Wessels 1995+\n29+ Ikenberry 1998,

\u201ccongruence\u201d between the two constitutional\norders+33 It can plausibly be argued that this \u201cstrikingly good fit\u201d34 makes Euro-\npean political integration more welcome to the German political and administra-\ntive elites than to other Europeans, such as the British, whose domestic state\nstructures are considerably different from the EU+ Wolfgang Wagner has shown\nthat, during the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, the governments of coun-\ntries with entrenched parliamentary representation at the regional level wanted a\nstronger European Parliament, whereas the countries with no regional parliaments\nwere opposed+35\nBased on these considerations, the fourth causal factor examined in this article\nis the constitutional culture that prevails in a country, and specifically the legiti-\nmacy and practice of multilayered governance in the domestic context+ Two typi-\ncal constitutional cultures can be envisaged from this perspective+ One conceives\nsovereignty as a unitary and indivisible attribute of a polity+ With reference to\nFrance, Stanley Hoffmann has pointed to \u201cthe tendency to look at sovereignty not\nas a bundle of discrete powers and separable state functions, but rather as a talis-\nman, indivisible and inalienable yet eminently losable+\u201d36 Similarly, J+ C+ D+ Clark\nnotes that \u201cthe United Kingdom\u2019s dynastic unification, crucially combined with\nthe union of Church and State at the Reformation, endowed her with a unitary,\nabsolutist doctrine of sovereignty, + + + within which the concept of \u2018sharing sover-\neignty\u2019 became a contradiction in terms+\u201d37 This idea of a \u201csupreme, irresistible,\nabsolute, uncontrolled authority, in which + + + the rights of sovereignty, reside\u201d ~as\nSir William Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries formulated it! is still at the basis of the\nBritish legal system+38 This conception is generally hostile to the vertical division\nof powers, which is seen as a threat to the integrity of public authority+ According\nto a different type of constitutional culture, public power can be, and should be,\ndistributed among multiple territorial levels, in accordance with the principle of\nsubsidiarity or comparative efficiency+ In the first type, the exercise of sovereign\npower is concentrated and \u201cmonocentric;\u201d in the second type it is diffuse and\n\u201cpluricentric+\u201d\nThe fourth hypothesis considered in this article is thus:\nH4: Governments of countries where a monocentric conception of political author-\nity prevails will find it more difficult to accept a supranational transfer of powers\nin the CFSP than governments of countries where the pluricentric constitutional\nculture is stronger+\n33+ See Bulmer 1997; Schmidt 1999; and Buller and Jeffery 2000+\n34+ Bulmer 1997, 76+\n35+ Wagner 2002+\n36+ Hoffmann 1995, 254+\n37+ Clark 1991, 60+\n38+ Quoted by Goldsworthy 1999, 10+ On the central role of the sovereignty of Parliament in En-\nglish political culture and its implications for European integration, see Clark 1991 and Larsen 1997+\n148 International Organization\nIn other words, a constitutional culture that emphasizes multilayered governance\nwithin the boundaries of the state predisposes its leaders to accept and promote\nthe creation of an additional layer of governance, if this seems to increase policy\neffectiveness+ This predisposition facilitates institutional isomorphism+ The idea\nof indivisible sovereignty, on the contrary, creates a conceptual obstacle to supra-\nnational political integration+\nIt is important to note that the analyses below are not based on measures of\n\u201cculture,\u201d but on an index measuring domestic institutional structures+ In a later\nsection, I will argue that this index is suitable for assessing the hypothesis formu-\nlated above+ The validity of my conclusions about the impact of constitutional\nculture will depend crucially on the plausibility of that argument+\nIn this section I have identified four factors that might plausibly explain the\nvariance in government support for a supranational foreign and security policy+\nEach of these factors is stressed by a different \u201cschool\u201d in international relations\ntheory, but this does not exclude the idea that they can complement each other in\nexplaining governmental preferences concerning political integration+\nMost importantly, each causal factor is formulated in such a general way that,\ntaken together, they encompass a large number of more specific explanations ad-\nvanced in the literature+ For instance, national characteristics such as neutral sta-\ntus and a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States can be subsumed under\npreferences over policies; and factors such as the consequences of a peripheral or\ninsular location, of historical experiences and memories, and socialization effects\nderiving from EU membership can be subsumed under the question of European\nidentity+ An explanatory framework that focuses on the four variables discussed\nabove can hope to grasp many of the relevant differences between the member-\nstates+ Even so, the expectation is that the variables considered can explain a sub-\nstantial part of the variance\u2014not the total variance+\nExplanatory Strategies\nThe previous section has identified a number of possible influences on the willing-\nness of European governments to establish a supranational foreign and security\npolicy+ The hypotheses, however, have been formulated in such a general way as\nto leave unspecified the character of the causal links+ Before the hypotheses can\nbe tested empirically, this character must be made explicit+ This article considers\ntwo possible interpretations of the causal link concept+ According to the first in-\nterpretation, the causal factor increases the probability of the outcome ~net of the\neffect of other relevant causes!+ According to the second interpretation, the cause\n~by itself or in combination with other causes! represents a necessary and0or suf-\nficient condition for the outcome to occur+ The first understanding underpins most\nquantitative research+ The second understanding underpins, sometimes implicitly,\nmany qualitative comparative, \u201csmall-N\u201d investigations+39\n39+ See Ragin 2000, 313; and Mahoney 2000+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 149\nIn this article I posit that both approaches are legitimate for the study of the\nproblem at hand+40 Therefore, in the following I will ask two related questions\nwith regard to the four explanatory variables considered above: ~1! Do these vari-\nables affect the probability that a government is supportive of a supranational re-\nform of the CFSP, ceteris paribus? and ~2! Are any of these causal conditions\nnecessary and0or sufficient for supranationalism, by themselves or in combination\nwith other causal conditions?\nThis article aims to answer the first question using multivariate logistic regres-\nsion+ Correlational methods, however, might not be equally suited for answering\nquestions of the second kind, which are expressed in logical terms+ Sufficiency\nand necessity can be conceptualized as set-theoretic relationships, and for this rea-\nson I will examine the second research question using a novel method that has\nbeen developed by Charles Ragin and is based on fuzzy-set logic+41 Both explan-\natory strategies involve a comparison between the member-states of the EU, al-\nthough the logic of comparison is different+42 Moreover, both types of cross-\nnational comparative investigation are intended as a complement to, not as a\nsubstitute for, detailed case studies at the country level+43\nLogistic regression is used frequently in the analysis of social and political data\nand does not require an introduction+ Ragin\u2019s fuzzy-set method is less well known,\nand thus a brief description is appropriate+ The method is a formal tool for quali-\ntative comparisons that builds on a previous technique, Qualitative Comparative\nAnalysis ~QCA!,44 which is based on Boolean algebra and has been applied to\nvarious topics in political research, including international alliances, coercive di-\nplomacy, revolutionary movements, the breakdown of democratic regimes, and the\ndevelopment of welfare states+45 Similar to its predecessor, fuzzy-set analysis is\nspecifically designed to deal with situations in which the number of cases is mod-\nerate ~between about 5 and 50! and causality is multiple ~different causes can gen-\nerate the same outcome! and conjunctural ~the impact of a factor on the outcome\ndepends on its interaction with other factors\u2014that is, what matters are combina-\ntions of causes!+\nCompared to QCA, the main strength of fuzzy-set analysis is that it is not re-\nstricted to situations in which the outcome and the causes are either present or\nabsent; it can also be applied to observations displaying more or less of a certain\n40+ Mahoney 2001, 589 notes that it is \u201can open question whether relationships based on the logic\nof necessary and sufficient conditions or relationships derived from linear correlations will be found\nmore frequently by researchers+\u201d\n41+ Ragin 2000+\n42+ Another study that combines logistic regression analysis with Ragin\u2019s Qualitative Comparative\nAnalysis ~the precursor of his fuzzy-set method! is Kiser et al+ 1995+\n43+ The following collections include case studies on single countries: Hill 1996; Howorth and Me-\nnon 1997; and Manners and Whitman 2000+ The most satisfactory answer to the research questions of\nthe present article is likely to emerge from the dialogue between country-level case studies and the\nkind of comparative investigation conducted here+\n44+ See Ragin 1987; and Ragin et al+ 1996+\n45+ See, for instance,Amenta and Poulsen 1996; Berg-Schlosser and De Meur 1994; Chernoff 1995;\nGoodwin 2001; Harvey 1999; and Wickham-Crowley 1992+\n150 International Organization\nproperty+ This is because fuzzy sets embody both qualitative states ~full member-\nship and full nonmembership in a set! and variation by level ~degrees of member-\nship between 0 and 1!+ In addition, fuzzy-set analysis can incorporate a probabilistic\ninterpretation of causality and take into account statistical significance+46\nCompared to quantitative methods, fuzzy-set analysis is designed for the dis-\ncovery of patterns of causal necessity and sufficiency in intermediate-sized N\u2019s+ It\nis very sensitive to causal complexity, that is, multiple and conjunctural causation+\nThe use of interaction terms is subject to stringent limitations in most quantitative\nmethods, whereas fuzzy-set analysis starts by examining all possible combina-\ntions of causal conditions ~saturated interaction! and then simplifies the model in\na top-down manner+47\nIn a nutshell, researchers using fuzzy-set QCA do the following+ First, they use\nsubstantive and theoretical knowledge to assign fuzzy-set membership scores to\ncases in both the outcome and the causal conditions in which they are interested+\nSecond, they look for causal conditions with membership scores that are consis-\ntently greater than outcome membership scores+ If there is a causal condition in\nwhich this happens in all cases, then this condition passes the test of necessity+\nThird, to examine sufficiency they compare the membership scores of the out-\ncome with the score of all logically possible combinations of the causal condi-\ntions, and they look for combinations with membership scores that are consistently\nlower than outcome membership scores+ If there is a combination for which this\nhappens in all cases, then this condition passes the test of sufficiency+ Researchers\neliminate those expressions that pass the test of sufficiency but are logically re-\ndundant and obtain a logically parsimonious statement of causal sufficiency+ This\nstatement is then evaluated in terms of any simplifying assumption that it incor-\nporates ~simplifying assumptions are statements about the hypothetical outcome\nof combinations of causal conditions that do not occur in the population studied!+48\nOperationalization and Data\nIn this article, logistic regression and the fuzzy-set method are used to analyze\nevidence collected from all the states that were EU members in 1996+ This re-\nquires an operationalization of the causal factors that is sufficiently precise to al-\n46+ Probabilistic techniques for statistical significance testing in fuzzy-set QCA require a popula-\ntion with a relatively large number of cases+ Since the population considered in this article includes\nonly thirteen countries, I conduct what Ragin calls a \u201cveristic\u201d test of necessity and sufficiency+ In a\nveristic test, one single disconfirming case is considered enough to reject the hypothesis of sufficiency\nand necessity+ This criterion is common in small-N comparative studies+ Mahoney 2000+ It seems ad-\nequate in the context of the present study because its deterministic character is balanced by the prob-\nabilistic character of logistic regression analysis+\n47+ Ragin 2000, 72+\n48+ A paper describing the various steps in more detail is available at ^http:00personal+lse+ac+uk0\nkoenigar0fuzzy+htm&+ Accessed 8 September 2003+ For a full exposition, see Ragin 2000+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 151\nlow comparisons between fifteen countries and that takes into account the difficulty\nof collecting in-depth homogeneous data for such a range of countries+\nThe first task is to operationalize the outcome variable, that is, the preferences\nof governments concerning the degree of supranationalism in their foreign and\nsecurity policy cooperation+ In most areas of political research, to identify the pref-\nerences of actors is more difficult than to ascertain their behavior, which is gener-\nally visible+ To determine the preference ordering of collective actors such as\nnational governments is even more difficult, given their composite nature and the\npossibility of internal disagreements and even conflicts+ In this article, the prob-\nlem of determining preferences is solved by relying on the public statements that\nthe governments themselves issued to illustrate the position they intended to pro-\nmote at the Intergovernmental Conferences for the institutional reform of the EU+\nThe audiences for these statements were their parliaments and publics, as well as\nthe governments of other member-states+ The prenegotiation phase of the IGC held\nin 1996\u201397 seems a useful context to elicit these positions, as all fifteen govern-\nments prepared and publicized papers outlining their stance on a broad range of\nissues expected to be on the negotiating table+49 As noted above, the position of\neach member-state on the most important treaty revisions concerning CFSP is sum-\nmarized in Table 1+ The explanation of how the information contained in that table\nprovides the input ~outcome variable! for the analyses is given in the next section,\nas the two methods employed differ in this respect+\nThe assessment of the first explanatory variable, \u201cpolicy conformity,\u201d requires\na way to identify governments that tend to be preference outliers with respect to\nvarious international problems+ Here I use voting behavior in the UN General As-\nsembly as a proxy, because UN delegations vote on a number of issues of world\npolitics that might be the topic of CFSP decisions+ In fact, about 95 percent of\nroll-call votes in the period 1991\u201396 fell into four categories: disarmament, colo-\nnialism, the Middle East, and human and political rights ~including the conflict in\nformer Yugoslavia!+50 These issue areas either already belong to the CFSP\u2019s re-\nmit,51 or governments can reasonably expect them to be added to the EU\u2019s com-\npetencies in the future+52 I considered the five sessions held between the end of\nthe Cold War and the start of the IGC of 1996\u201397 ~Sessions 45th to 50th!+ During\nthis period, the General Assembly adopted 434 resolutions by recorded or roll-call\nvote, and in 176 cases the vote of EU member countries53 was not unanimous+ For\n49+ These documents are listed in the Appendix+ They are treated here not as indicators of the op-\ntimal level of integration preferred by each government in absolute terms, but as indications of their\nrelative location on the continuum from national sovereignty to supranational governance+\n50+ Voeten 2000, 209+\n51+ Conseil de l\u2019Union Europ\u00e9enne, 2003+\n52+ Voting behavior in the UN Assembly is an imperfect indicator of the \u201ctrue\u201d preferences of gov-\nernments, because there are several incentives for misrepresentation+ However, this indicator seems a\nuseful way to determine how often the position of each government differs from the position of most\nother EU governments, and thus its relative tendency to be a preference outlier+\n53+ 1996 membership status+\n152 International Organization\neach of these 176 \u201ccontentious\u201d resolutions, I determined how each EU member-\nstate voted ~three possibilities: \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or abstention! and how many other\nmember-states voted in the same way ~\u201cpartners\u201d henceforth!+54 Since in 1996 there\nwere fifteen EU members, this number can range from a minimum of zero ~the state\nis isolated! to a maximum of thirteen ~the state is part of a majority of fourteen\nagainst one dissenter!+55 Each country is given a conformity score, which equals\nthe average number of partners it had in the 176 resolutions+ A low average is an\nindication that the state is a preference outlier, while a high average indicates that\nits policy preferences generally coincide with those of a majority of EU member-\nstates+\nThe average number of partners, or \u201clikeminded\u201d states, determines the likeli-\nhood that a government would have its preferences overrun in hypothetical votes\nin the EU+ This proxy certainly has several limitations+ For instance, it can cap-\nture the risk, but not the cost, of being outvoted, because the latter depends on the\nrelative importance of the issues for the governments+ However, short of an in-\ndepth analysis of the foreign policy preferences of each EU government, this ap-\nproach would seem the best way to systematically compare the disadvantage of\nsupranationalism that each state has to bear because of disagreements about the\nbest way to respond to international problems+ This proxy, for instance, would\nindicate that a country such as Italy ~average number of partners: 9+9! can be al-\nmost certain to be part of either a majority or a blocking minority, while the United\nKingdom ~5+3! would be much more uncertain about its ability to thwart un-\ndesired decisions in case of a vote+\nTo measure the second causal factor\u2014power capabilities\u2014I rely on the Com-\nposite Index of Material Capabilities ~CIMC! developed by the Correlates of War\n~COW! Project, which is probably the most commonly used power index in the\ninternational relations literature+ The CIMC results from two demographic indica-\ntors ~total population and urban population!, two industrial indicators ~energy con-\nsumption and steel production!, and two military indicators ~military expenditures\nand armed forces size!+ For each of these indicators, the COW research team cal-\nculates the total score ~in people, tons, dollars, etc+! for the international system in\na given year, ascertains the percentage share held by each state, and calculates the\naverage of these percentage shares+56 In this article, however, I consider each state\u2019s\nshare of the EU total, because I am interested in the differences in power among\nmember-states only+ The CIMC used here is for 1992, the last year for which\ndata on EU countries are currently available in the National Material Capabilities\nData set+57\n54+ Data from UN ~various years!+\n55+ The maximum number of partners a government can have in a vote is thirteen because I do not\nconsider the resolutions voted unanimously by all fifteen EU member-states+\n56+ Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972+\n57+ Singer and Small 199001999+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 153\nIn comparison to other possible indicators of national power capabilities, the\nCIMC has the advantage of expressing economic power as well as military power,\nand potential military power ~expressed by the economic indicators! as well as\nactual power+ The inclusion of the economic dimension is useful because eco-\nnomic coercion and incentives are important tools of foreign and security policy\neven when the possibility of using military force remains essential+ Considering\npotential military power is important to do justice to the neorealist position ac-\ncording to which structural factors ultimately govern international politics: in this\nlogic, potential capabilities are crucial because states will sooner or later trans-\nform them into actual military capabilities as a result of the competitive nature of\nthe international environment ~a state that fails to do so is a clear anomaly from\nthe point of view of neorealism!+58 However, the results reported in the next sec-\ntion are robust alternative measurements of national capabilities+59\nConcerning my third causal factor, the study of national and supranational iden-\ntity is occasionally conducted by means of discourse analysis+60 However, the state\nof the art in EU studies does not yet allow the use of this sophisticated tool to\ncompare all EU member-states+ Another common way to operationalize European\nidentity is to rely on the results of opinion polls+ The standard source on public\nattitudes toward European integration is the Eurobarometer survey, which is con-\nducted periodically in all member-states on behalf of the European Commission+\nThe survey question that will be used in this article is the following: \u201cIn the near\nfuture do you see yourself as + + + ?\u201d where five answers are possible: ~1!

In every country, the European identity score of\nopinion leaders is positive ~that is, the number of respondents feeling European is\nlarger than the number of \u201cnationals only\u201d!, while in five out of fifteen countries\nthe score of the general population is negative ~that is, the respondents not feeling\nEuropean outnumber those who do!+ ~2! In every country, the opinion leaders score\nhigher than the general population ~the average difference is 23 points, with a\nminimum of 11+1 and a maximum of 33+8!+ This pattern clearly matches the re-\nsults of a number of studies on public support for European integration+64 ~3! Cross-\nnationally, the opinion leaders\u2019 scores and the mass scores are almost perfectly\ncorrelated ~Spearman\u2019s rho 5 +97!+ In other words, high levels of opinion leaders\u2019\nidentification with Europe correspond to high levels of mass identification, and\nvice versa+ Because of this high correlation, two different models have been esti-\nmated in the next section: one with the scores of opinion leaders and the other\nwith the scores of the general public+\nIn order to assess the fourth causal factor, it is necessary to estimate whether\nthe constitutional culture of a country is closer to the monocentric or to the pluri-\ncentric ideal type+ The actual institutional structure of the polity can be considered\na proxy of that culture, as it is plausible to assume a broad correspondence be-\ntween the predominant views on the legitimate distribution of public authority and\nthe rules concerning regional governance in each country+ Liesbet Hooghe and\nGary Marks have developed a twelve-point index of regional governance in EU\ncountries, based on the degree of constitutional federalism, the presence of special\nterritorial autonomy, the role of regions in central government, and the existence\nof regional elections+65 In the following analysis, I use the scores they assign to\neach EU member-state for 2000, with one modification: one of their dimensions,\nspecial territorial autonomy, is left out because it is often seen as an exceptional\nsolution to a specific political problem rather than the institutional consequence of\na distinctive way to conceive political authority+ Later in this article, I elaborate\non why constitutional culture is the most plausible causal mechanism linking sub-\n62+ On the construction of the opinion leadership index, see Reif and Marlier 1998c, 1089, or other\nversions of the Eurobarometer codebook+ In the four surveys used, 7,249 respondents out of a total of\n58,443 ~12+4 percent! received the highest score on that index+\n63+ Wessels 1995, 145+\n64+ Notably Inglehart 1977+\n65+ Hooghe and Marks 2001, 191\u2013212+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 155\nnational regional governance and supranational orientation in the case of CFSP\nreform+\nThis completes the description of the data that will be used in measuring the\nfive variables involved in the following analyses+ For the logistic regression analy-\nsis, no further manipulation of the data is necessary: they will be used as input as\nthey appear in the original data sets+66 The fuzzy-set analysis, however, requires\nthe transformation of the raw data into fuzzy-set membership scores+\nIn the following fuzzy-set analysis, the relevant population consists of thirteen\nmember-states of the EU that participated in the IGC of 1996\u201397+ Ireland and\nSweden have not been included because of too little information about their posi-\ntions+ On the basis of the data presented above, I have assigned to each EU member-\nstate a fuzzy-set score in the outcome and in the four causal conditions+ These\nscores are listed in Table 2+ With regard to the outcome, the governments that\nsupported all treaty revisions listed in Table 1 are considered fully in the \u201cset of\nsupranationalist governments\u201d and consequently are assigned a fuzzy-set score\n66+ The data set is available at ^http:00personal+lse+ac+uk0koenigar0data+htm&+ Accessed 8 Septem-\nber 2003+ Policy conformity ranges from 5+30 to 9+97 ~mean: 8+70!; material capabilities ranges from\n0+00 to 22+00 ~mean: 6+94!; European identity of the general public ranges from 223+00 to 49+10 ~mean:\n13+69!; European identity of opinion leaders ranges from 10+80 to 66+20 ~mean: 36+30!; and regional\ngovernance ranges from 0+00 to 10+00 ~mean: 3+41!+ The highest correlation coefficient among the\nindependent variables ~apart from the two identity scores! is 0+53+ Other statistics confirm that the\nanalysis below is not affected by multicolinearity problems ~the variance inflation factor values are all\nwell below 10, the average variance inflation factor is close to 1 and the tolerance statistics are all\nabove 0+40!+\nTABLE 2.

is\nassigned a fuzzy-set membership score of 0, the country with the highest value is\nassigned a fuzzy-set score of 1, and all other countries receive intermediate scores+67\nTwo comments on this procedure are necessary+\nThe first concerns the decision to retain all the variation to be found in the raw\ndata+ According to Ragin, one of the advantages of fuzzy sets over conventional\nratio or interval scale measures is the possibility of eliminating variation in the\ndata that is not meaningful from the point of view of the research question+ For\ninstance, if a researcher is interested in how democratic states conduct wars and\nhas identified a threshold beyond which states can be considered fully democratic,\nthen it can be advisable to ignore any further variation in levels of democracy\nbeyond that threshold+\nIn the case of the four causal conditions examined here, however, no variation\ncan be declared clearly irrelevant on the basis of prior information at the case\nlevel or theoretical considerations+ In such situations, any truncation of the origi-\nnal data runs the risk of being arbitrary and controversial+ The safest option is to\nretain all naturally occurring variation and invite readers to replicate the analysis\nwith different fuzzy-set scores if they believe that more appropriate breakpoints\ncan be identified+\nThe second comment concerns the countries that are classified as fully in or\nfully out of the set of countries with a relevant characteristic+ I maintain that the\ncountries that are assigned a score of 1 or 0 because they display the maximum or\nminimum value on the four variables correspond to the countries that can be con-\n67+ More specifically: ~1! the country with the most \u201cconformist\u201d preferences in the UN General\nAssembly receives a fuzzy-set score of 1, while the country that is more often a preference outlier has\na score of 0; ~2! the country with the highest material capabilities has a score of 1, while the weakest\ncountry has a score of 0; ~3! the country with the most developed layer of regional governance is\nassigned a fuzzy-set score of 1, while the most centralized one has a score of 0; ~4! the country with\nthe highest proportion of people feeling European in the Eurobarometer survey is assigned a fuzzy-set\nmembership score of 1, while the country with the lowest proportion receives a score of 0; and finally\n~5! the country with the highest proportion of opinion leaders feeling European in the Eurobarometer\nsurvey is assigned a fuzzy-set membership score of 1, while the country with the lowest proportion\nreceives a score of 0+ Scores are normalized to unit interval by applying the following equation:\nmi 5\nvi 2 min~v!\nmax~v!

Supranationalism, regional governance, and policy conformity\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 163\n3+ More Europeanized identities increase the probability that governments\nprefer a supranational foreign and security policy, ceteris paribus, although\nthe impact seems somewhat smaller than that of regional governance and\nmaterial capabilities+\n4+ Policy conformity does not significantly affect the probability of suprana-\ntionalism, but in combination with strong regional governance it becomes\nsufficient to generate supranationalism+\n5+ None of the four causal factors is a necessary condition for supranational-\nism+ In other words, governments that support a supranational CFSP are\nnot necessarily weak, federal, conformist, or Europeanized+ Indeed, among\nthe most vocal supporters of foreign policy integration, one finds a power-\nful state such as Germany, a government whose citizens declare little Euro-\npean identification such as Austria, a centralized state such as Luxemburg,\nand a moderate policy outlier such as Spain+ This negative finding high-\nlights an important point: none of the factors examined here represents an\ninsuperable obstacle to supranationalism\u2014that is, an adverse condition that\ncannot be overcome even when other, more favorable, characteristics are\npresent+\nA number of issues deserve closer attention+ The first concerns policy confor-\nmity, which has no statistically significant effect on the probability of supranation-\nalism according to regression analysis, but is sufficient for supranationalism if it\nis found together with a high degree of supranational governance according to\nfuzzy-set analysis+ As indicated above, the two analytical strategies have different\nexplanatory aims and, therefore, the fact that a causal factor is shown to be rele-\nvant by one of them and irrelevant by the other is not necessarily a problem+ How-\never, it is a finding that demands an explanation+ The most plausible interpretation\nis the following+ A pluricentric constitutional culture removes an important con-\nceptual obstacle\u2014the idea of national sovereignty as unitary and indivisible\u2014\nfrom the transfer of decisional powers to the European level+ The anticipation that\nmost decisions made in supranational fora would correspond to the government\u2019s\nsubstantive policy preferences adds to this permissive factor a positive incentive\nto support supranationalization, and it is the combination of permissive and posi-\ntive conditions that makes this particular conjuncture sufficient for the outcome+\nThis linkage deserves to be explored in further research, possibly by using in-\ndepth case studies+78\nThe second point concerns the impact of regional governance itself+ As indi-\ncated above, constitutional culture is measured indirectly, using the actual institu-\ntional structure of a country as a proxy+ While the assumption of a correspondence\nbetween ideas and institutions seems reasonable in this case, one should take into\n78+ In the logistic regression analysis, the coefficient of the interaction term between regional gov-\nernance and policy conformity is not statistically significant at conventional levels+\n164 International Organization\naccount that domestic structures\u2014and specifically institutions of regional gov-\nernance\u2014can affect national positions on supranational integration in ways that\ndo not necessarily reflect constitutional ideas and norms+79 In several policy do-\nmains, the transfer of policymaking competencies to European institutions can have\nthe effect of redistributing the political resources that confer influence in the do-\nmestic political arena+ Concerning specifically the distribution of power between\nregional and central governments, Tanja B\u00f6rzel has argued that \u201c@f#or regions of\nunitary and weakly decentralized states, Europeanization may offer additional op-\nportunities which could strengthen their autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the central state, al-\nthough less resourceful regions often lack the resources to fully exploit these\nopportunities+ In highly decentralized states, on the contrary, regions suffer a sig-\nnificant loss of their administrative competencies from Europeanization, which re-\nsults in an uneven distribution of \u2018say and pay\u2019 between the central state and the\nregions+\u201d80 The strategic interpretation suggests that the affected political actors\nanticipate the potential redistributive effect of Europeanization and develop pref-\nerences on further integration accordingly+\nThis argument, which points to the logic of expected consequences rather than\nthe logic of appropriateness,81 is useful for explaining the preferences of national\nand regional actors in a number of important policy areas+ But in the case of for-\neign and security policy, the link between domestic structures and government\npositions on supranationalism is much more likely to be due to cultural factors\nthan to strategic action+ This is attributable to the character of the policy domain\nthat is considered here+ The causal mechanism based on strategic calculation can\nbe expected to operate only when specific institutional interests are at stake+ How-\never, regional governments normally do not participate in the foreign and security\npolicymaking of their states+ Therefore, neither they nor the national governments\nshould expect a change in relative power as a result of Europeanization+ In other\nwords, the transfer is distributionally neutral, and as such it is unlikely to motivate\nstrategic moves and countermoves based on institutional self-interest+ On the con-\ntrary, the explanation based on the logic of appropriateness and constitutional cul-\nture refers to a general attitude toward the vertical division of powers, which is\nindependent of the specific issues being debated+ Thus the most plausible interpre-\ntation of the strong and significant relationship between regional governance and\nintegrationist preferences shown in the previous section points to the importance\nof differences in constitutional culture, as hypothesized in this article+\nThe third point that needs attention concerns the impact of European identity\nand the causal mechanisms that may link it to government support for suprana-\ntionalism+ The two possibilities discussed above are: first, that the identities of\npolitical elites affect government policies ~direct causal path!; and second, that\n79+ I am grateful to the editors of IO for bringing this important point to my attention+\n80+ B\u00f6rzel 2002, 32\u201333+\n81+ See March and Olsen 1998; and B\u00f6rzel and Risse 2000+\nInstitutional Change in EU Foreign and Security Policy 165\nmass identities affect government policies through the mediation of instrumental\ninterests of political leaders ~indirect causal path!+ The analysis conducted above\nshows that European identity matters, but is unable to indicate which causal mech-\nanism matters most or how they interact+ This is because the measures chosen to\nrepresent mass identities and opinion leaders\u2019 identities are almost perfectly cor-\nrelated ~although in every country, opinion leaders feel considerably more \u201cEuro-\npean\u201d than the general public!+ The clarification of the relative weight of the causal\nmechanisms and their interplay is an important topic for research, possibly through\ncase studies at the country level+82\nThe final point concerns the possibility of generalizing the findings beyond the\nEU+ For instance, it could be argued that federal domestic structures have a posi-\ntive influence on the propensity to join international governance structures, all else\nbeing equal+ The ceteris paribus clause must be stressed, as countries such as Swit-\nzerland and the United States show that this cannot be an overriding factor+ The\nstrong national identity of the Swiss and their strong preference for isolationism\nin security policy might counteract an integrative impetus stemming from their\nfederalism+ The United States is a model case of federalism, but it is also a global\nhegemonic power and this latter characteristic might be more influential in deter-\nmining its attitude toward transfers of sovereignty+ The presence of other, possibly\nstronger, factors does not imply, however, that a federalist constitutional culture\nhas no influence on foreign policy+83\nConclusion\nIn this article, I have tried to explore systematically the sources of the preferences\nof Western European governments concerning the institutional form of their for-\neign and security cooperation+ In contrast to the assumptions of certain theorists\nof international politics, I have stressed that the preservation of national sover-\neignty is not a goal shared equally by all governments, because some of them\nhave shown a willingness to promote strong forms of political integration in Eu-\nrope+ The desire to perpetuate the state as an autonomous actor in world politics is\na variable, not a constant+\n82+ Such as Marcussen et al+ 1999+\n83+ The fact that the United States is less willing to compromise its sovereignty than most of its\nWestern allies should not overshadow another crucial comparison: as argued by G+ John\nIkenberry, of all powers that won major wars in modern history, the United States has accepted the\nstrongest constraints on its power through international institutions+ \u201cAmerican power is not only un-\nprecedented in its preponderance but it is also unprecedented in the way it is manifest with and through\ninstitutions+\u201d See Ikenberry 2001, 258+ A counterfactual thought experiment might ask whether the\nsame level of self-binding would have been attained had the United States been a country with a cen-\ntralistic constitutional culture+ Similarly, a comparison with the foreign policy of Canada, which shares\nwith the United States various institutional and cultural characteristics but occupies a different rank in\nthe international distribution of power, might be useful in this context+\n166 International Organization\nThis article has considered a number of possible explanations for the diversity of\npreferences, which were drawn from research programs that emphasize instrumen-\ntal attitudes toward international institutions and from approaches that stress the logic\nof appropriateness in institutional choice+ Regression and fuzzy-set analyses show\nthat both approaches contribute important insights about the causes of national pref-\nerences+ Differences in power resources, stressed by the realist tradition in general\nand by the \u201cvoice opportunity\u201d thesis in particular, indeed explain part of the dif-\nference: all else being equal, governments of weaker countries are more likely to\nsupport supranational CFSP institutions than governments of stronger countries+\nIn addition, the constructivist research program provides important insights+ First,\nthe share of a country\u2019s population that feels \u201cEuropean\u201d affects the position of its\ngovernment with regard to constitutional change in EU foreign and security pol-\nicy+ The link between collective identity and government policy holds regardless\nof whether one looks at the identity of the general public or at that of \u201copinion\nleaders+\u201d Second, and more strikingly, this article has shown that the strength of\nregional governance in a country is strongly related to the preference of its gov-\nernment with regard to sovereignty pooling and delegation in foreign affairs+ This\nsuggests that attitudes toward supranational integration are shaped by distinct con-\nceptions of sovereignty and political authority that prevail in the political culture\nof the member-states+ Governments of countries whose domestic constitutions re-\nflect and reinforce a positive attitude toward a multilayered distribution of author-\nity tend to support further integration in foreign and security policy more than\ncountries where sovereignty is considered indivisible+\nIn contrast to material power capabilities, Europeanized identities, and domes-\ntic regional governance, the second factor derived from rationalist approaches\u2014\npolicy conformity ~that is, the tendency to have preferences on specific policy issues\nof world politics that are consistent with the preferences of most other EU member-\nstates!\u2014has no statistically significant effect on institutional choice, at least as\nthis variable is measured in this article+ However, even this factor may play a role,\nbecause fuzzy-set analysis reveals that in combination with regional governance,\nit constitutes a sufficient condition for supranationalism+\nThese results lend support to the argument that the relationships among the main\nresearch programs in international relations theory can be complementary as well\nas competitive+ While I have compared the explanatory power of hypotheses in-\nspired by different theoretical perspectives, I have avoided a \u201cgladiator\u201d style of\nanalysis, where \u201cone perspective goes forth and slays all others+\u201d84 A substantial\nnumber of scholars of international relations, while identifying themselves primar-\nily with one research tradition, do not expect their theories to fully explain the\nphenomena in which they are interested+85 This article has derived specific hypoth-\n84+ Checkel 2001, 243+\n85+ See, for instance, Grieco 1996, 282; Russett and Oneal 2001, 90; Legro and
