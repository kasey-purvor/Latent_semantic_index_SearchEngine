We aim here at understanding the morphogen-\nesis of these networks, and particularly what is proper to knowledge networks. This, in turn,\nwould be likely to provide a specific insight and perspective on several underlying social\nand cognitive processes, such as cultural epidemiology phenomena (Valente, 1995; Sperber,\n1996), consensus, relevance and authority judgments (Bourdieu, 1991; Lazega, 1992), or even\nthe emergence of various types of stratification (Cole and Cole, 1973; Freeman, 1989; Cohen-\ndet et al., 2003).\nIn this respect, interactions occurring in such socio-semantic complex systems are deter-\nmined, at least partially, by the structure of past interactions and by conceptual affinities.\nSimultaneously, new interactions shape and modify both the social network structure and\n\u2217CAMS (CNRS\/EHESS, France) & CRESS (U.

More precisely, taking into ac-\ncount semantic aspects in interactional processus becomes especially relevant when knowl-\nedge and relationships evolve at similar timescales \u2014 i.e., when semantic features are likely\nto coevolve with their social environment (Leenders, 1997).\nWe focus here on two particular kinds of knowledge networks: scientific collaboration\nnetworks and blogger citation networks, which are both settings where link creation between\nagents and use of semantic items are plausibly occurring jointly, at a similar pace. Our study\nwill be empirically based on moderately sizable and well-delimited networks: on one hand, a\ncommunity of several thousands of embryologists studying an animal model, the \u201czebrafish\u201d,\nand, on the other hand, a network of about a thousand webloggers posting articles regarding\nthe US presidential elections of 2008.\nBeyond the numerous behavioral studies devoted to processes of link formation in such\nknowledge networks (Latour and Woolgar, 1988; Katz and Martin, 1997; Cardon and Delaunay-\nTeterel, 2006), large-scale structural studies on this kind of communities have essentially fo-\ncused on citations (de Solla Price, 1965, 1976; McGlohon et al., 2007) and interactions (New-\nman, 2004; Ali-Hasan and Adamic, 2007). While the social structure has generally been the\ncornerstone of these previous works, its potential intertwinement with semantic features has\nmostly remained unaddressed (Pattison, 1994).\nThis paper aims at demonstrating that the dynamics of these knowledge communities\ncan be adequately described as the coevolution of a social and a socio-semantic network.\nMore precisely, we will first introduce a theoretical framework based on a social network\nand a socio-semantic network, i.e. an epistemic network featuring agents, concepts and links\nbetween agents and between agents and concepts (Sec. 2). Adopting a corresponding em-\npirical protocol (Sec. 3), we will then describe the coevolution of social and socio-semantic\nstructures, at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, emphasizing the remarkable stability\nof these macroscopic properties in spite of a vivid local, agent-based network dynamics. We\nwill in particular exhibit several relevant structural patterns and properties:\n(i) in terms of hierarchies (Sec. 4), a strong heterogeneity in the connectivity or usage,\nrespectively, of certain agents or concepts, along with significant dependencies between\nsocial and semantic aspects of these hierarchies;\n(ii) in terms of aggregates (Sec. 5), a strong social cohesion (transitivity), echoed by a socio-\nsemantic homogeneity, present at both the local level (conceptual resemblance within\nthe social neighborhood) and the global level (presence of large groups of agents ma-\nnipulating identical concepts, traditionally denoting \u201cepistemic communities\u201d).\nEventually, empirical estimations of the non-uniform link creation processes, including se-\nmantic homophily, will constitute plausible underpinnings of the observed structures and of\ntheir stability. The paper will essentially be organized in a dual manner, progressively intro-\nducing static and dynamic observables linked to social networks only (which are oftentimes\nclassical) altogether with their socio-semantic counterparts.\n2 Epistemic networks\nThe distinctiveness of epistemic networks. Although graph theory indifferently applies\n2\nto any kind of network \u2013social or not\u2013 it may appear debatable to consider that mechanisms\nproper to social networks can be likened to those operating in other classes of networks,\nbeyond some universal phenomena whose reach could seem relatively limited.1\nAn identical argument could be proposed in the case of knowledge networks: social and\nsemantic networks are often studied separately. Social network analysis indeed rarely fo-\ncuses, practically, on the relationships between social structures and semantic configurations\n(Emirbayer and Goodwin, 1994) while the structure of the social network constitutes, if not\nthe sole structure, at least the reference frame. Yet, knowledge networks feature interaction\nwhere semantic content is decisive, thus underlining the relevance of considering structural\npatterns or interaction mechanisms which are not strictly social (Callon, 2001), i.e. only based\non inter-agent relationships.\nWe therefore aim at providing a theoretical framework binding both networks, by sug-\ngesting that the analysis of knowledge communities and the underlying agent behaviors\n(notably relational behaviors) must take into account the reciprocal and joint influence of\nboth social and semantic features. The rationale behind this approach is double-minded:\nintroducing semantic aspects to the traditional social network ontology makes it possible to\nboth (i) precisely characterize the structure of knowledge communities and (ii) understand\nwhat defines and determines interactions depending on semantic objects, i.e. consider si-\nmultaneously phenomena of selection and influence (Leenders, 1997; Robins et al., 2001b,a)\nthrough the co-evolution of social and semantic configurations. This will also require, as we\nshall see, the introduction of descriptions proper to this object or, in other terms, propose\na class of \u201cepistemic\u201d patterns rather than just social patterns. In particular, we will for in-\nstance assume that the selection of similar agents \u2014homophily\u2014 plays a significant role in\nsocio-semantic pattern formations (McPherson et al., 2001). This argument has rarely been\ninvolved in a coevolving modeling framework. In our empirical setting, we will accordingly\nendeavor at understanding collaborations among scientists sharing similar concerns, or link\nformation between bloggers dealing with identical topics.\nFormal framework. We first distinguish the social network, whose nodes are agents and\nlinks indicate observed relationships. Relationships may a priori refer indifferently either\n(i) to interactions (for instance, a scientist collaborates with another scientist or an individual\ncomments a post on a blog) or (ii) to authority attributions (e.g. a scientist cites the works of\nanother scientist, a blogger cites a post of another blogger).\nIn any case, the social network is denoted by G = (S,RS) where S is the agent set and\nRS = R \u2282 S \u00d7 S \u00d7 N denotes the set of dated links: a link l = (s, s\u2032, t) \u2208 RS means that s is\nrelated to s\u2032 at t. Links can be directed (s cites s\u2032) or non-directed, as is the case in the scientific\ncollaboration network where, if s interacts with s\u2032, then s\u2032 interacts with s, indifferently (in\nwhich case (s, s\u2032, t) \u2208 RS \u21d4 (s\u2032, s, t) \u2208 RS).\nWe then introduce semantic objects which we call \u201cconcepts\u201d and which correspond here\nto terms or noun phrases considered as atomic units \u2014 C denotes the concept set. This en-\nables us to define a second network binding agents and concepts: the socio-semantic network\nGC, made of agents of S, concepts of C and links between these elements: RC thus denotes\n1This constrasts with a not infrequent opinion that network study may be universal across all disciplines\n(for a review, see Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003, inter alia) and underlining universal phenomena focused on\nthe global connectivity structure, which several authors have nevertheless demonstrated to be sensibly diverse\nacross both social and non-social networks (e.g. ?).\n3\nss'\ns''\nc\nc'\nc''\nFigure 1: Illustration of an epistemic network made of three agents S = {s, s\u2032, s\u2032\u2032}, three\nconcepts C = {c, c\u2032, c\u2032\u2032} and two kinds of links: between agents RS (straight lines), and\nbetween agents and conceptsRC (dashed lines).\nthe use of concepts by agents: an agent is linked to concepts he mentioned (in a paper, in a\npost). Thus,RC \u2282 S\u00d7C\u00d7 N, and a link lC = (s, c, t) \u2208 RC means that s used c at t.\nNote that both networks thus correspond to two distinct ontologies, because social re-\nlations and cognitive properties, in the broad sense, admittedly refer to two different kinds\nof settings, even if they are constructed from a common source (papers and posts). While\nthe social network is indeed appraised as a monopartite graph, as it is essentially a network\nof social relations between agents, the socio-semantic network is a bipartite graph, as it is es-\nsentially a straightforward representation of agent affiliations to attributes, as is obvious from\nFig. 1.\n3 Empirical protocol and methods\n3.1 Case description\nAn epistemic network is thus defined by these two networks \u2014 or, rather, these two kinds of\nnodes and two kinds of links \u2014 and will constitute the cornerstone of the representation of\nthe coevolution of agents & concepts. Without restraining the generality of this framework,\nwe empirically focus on one hand on an interaction network, made of research collabora-\ntions involving scientific concepts, and on the other hand on a citation network consisting of\nbloggers producing posts and citing other bloggers\u2019 posts.\nScientific networks: the zebrafish community\nWe first focus on a scientific network, which corresponds to embryologists working on the\nzebrafish, or \u201cbrachydanio rerio\u201d. The zebrafish is a small fish which has quickly become\na model animal due to its exceptional biological characteristics, including very rapid and\ntranslucid development (Bradbury, 2004). For this reason, the community has known an ex-\nponential growth during the last 20 years. Our dataset is more precisely built from papers\npublished from 1999 to the end of 2006 in one of the 20 000 journals indexed by the US Library\nof Congress \u2014 we therefore collected the data from the free and public bibliographic platform\nMedline provided by the US National Library of Medicine. Over the period, our database in-\ncludes 6, 641 papers featuring 15, 204 authors, increasing the number of overall authors and\n4\npublished articles in the field by about 5 times (from ca. 1, 500 papers to over 8, 000, and from\n3, 000 authors to about 18, 000).\nThe corresponding epistemic network is a collaboration network, where published pa-\npers are collaboration events. Authors are thus the actors of the social network, while con-\ncepts refer to topics used in papers. The bibliographic data mentions which agents collabo-\nrated on which topic at which time, therefore describing all dated social and socio-semantic\nlinks.\nBlogger networks: a portion of the US political blogosphere\nThe blog dataset is built upon the content of posts published by a selection of 1, 066 political\nblogs in the context of the US presidential elections of 2008. Data was collected from Novem-\nber 1, 2007 to February 29, 2008 by LINKFLUENCE2 and essentially consists of blog entries\nbasically made of a title, a full text content, associated with a list of hyperlinks.\nAs such, the corresponding epistemic network is fundamentally a citation network. We\nconsider that each hyperlink found in the content of an entry is deemed as a citation of the\nblog corresponding to this hyperlink. Similarly to the scientific network, post authors are\nthe nodes of the social network and a selected set of topics makes the concept set. Besides,\nalthough this network exhibits very high rates of links creation (see Fig. 2), most blogs from\nthe dataset are active from the start and over all periods, contrarily to the scientific network.\n3.2 Data processing\nAgents are uniquely identified from the data by their original name in the zebrafish case\nand by their unique blog URL in the blog network. The social network is thus easily created\nby taking into account joint collaborations between two scientists or citation of a blogger by\nanother blogger.\nDelineating concepts in the raw semantic data, which is made of abstracts for scientists\nand entries for blogs, is a more delicate process. Adopting a straightforward approach based\non the retrieval of keywords and tags specified by authors themselves could be questionable:\nfirst, this data is seldom available and, second, when it is, it depends on very subjective and\nindividual taxonomies. We regard the use of article contents as safer, following the hypothe-\nses of the distributional program in NLP (Jones and Kay, 1973) where the atomic semantic\nunit is a term or a noun phrase (such as \u201cbrain\u201d, \u201cspinal cord\u201d) \u2014 which is commonplace for\ninstance in scientometrics (Callon et al., 1986).\nWe therefore simply achieve a basic correspondence between lemmatized terms and con-\ncepts, i.e., we apply to both datasets the following simple linguistic processing. We first\ngather all terms and lemmatize them, i.e. we build classes of terms sharing the same base\nform, or lemma; thereby aggregating the various forms of an identical term in a single class.\nWe then exclude meaningless words (or \u201cstop-words\u201d) with respect to the context, such\nas \u201cconvincing\u201d, \u201cexample\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d, etc. With the help of external experts on each dataset,\nwe eventually consider a relatively small selection of discriminating and distinct concepts,\n2http:\/\/linkfluence.net \u2014 LINKFLUENCE is \u201ca research institute specializing in the conversations of the social\nweb\u201d. Originally, this data was being used to feed Presidential Watch \u201908 (http:\/\/presidentialwatch08.com), a\nmonitoring system for the blogosphere focused on the upcoming elections.\n5\namong the most frequent in the database. This first list of lemmas, later called \u201cconcepts\u201d, re-\nmains unchanged for the whole analysis (we concretely defined 65 concepts for the zebrafish\ncommunity and 80 for the political blogosphere). We finally create the socio-semantic net-\nwork by linking each agent to concepts s\/he previously used.\n3.3 Community boundaries\nThe boundaries of our epistemic networks, in the sense of Laumann et al. (1983), are princi-\npally defined in semantic terms rather than in a structural way (as is done, e.g., in Doreian\nand Woodard, 1994). In the zebrafish case, the network is made of all agents who mentioned\nthe term \u201czebrafish\u201d in at least one abstract, concepts are then later retrieved from these very\narticles. In the blog case, the set of bloggers has been created from a first pool of candidates\ndealing with the American presidential election of 2008, selected by experts of LINKFLU-\nENCE, then extended on structural grounds to neighbors who were also explicitly dealing\nwith the election \u2014 blogs not dealing with this topic were thus discarded.\nNetwork growth. Our epistemic networks are also growing networks: agents and links ap-\npear once and for all, since the starting date of our sample (i.e. 1999 for scientists, Nov 2007\nfor bloggers). This assumption makes sense for several reasons. It would first be method-\nologically difficult to talk about disconnection because, while it is possible to show the exact\ntime when a link is created as it corresponds directly to a positive event (a collaboration or\na citation), the data does not describe negative events (cessation of a link, withdrawal of an\nactor, etc.). Second, it is quantitatively sound: in the case of bloggers, it seems particulary\ndifficult to qualify the obsolescence of citation links or the loss of use of concepts over a rel-\natively short timespan of a few weeks; in the case of scientists, because of the exponential\ngrowth of the number of articles which accounts for a tremendous growth of the underlying\ncommunity, network activity is significantly smaller in the first years and, comparatively, it\nmay nonetheless plausibly be neglected in latter periods of a growing network.\nIn the remainder, the networks we consider at time t are thus formed of the aggregation of\nall links present until t: the dynamic social network at time t isGt = (S,RS\u2229S\u00d7S\u00d7{0, ..., t}),\nwhile the dynamic socio-semantic network is denoted by GCt = (S \u222a C,RC \u2229 S \u00d7 C \u00d7\n{0, ..., t}). When it does not result in an ambiguity, we omit the mention of time for the sake\nof clarity.\nObservation periods. Additionally, the temporal observation span for our datasets is of\n8 years for scientists and 4 months for bloggers, which both exhibit a considerable growth\nover the whole period. To observe the evolution of the networks, we define eight time points\nfor each dataset, equally spaced in time: for scientists, the time points are set at 1, 2, 3, etc.\nyears; for bloggers, they are 15, 30, 45, etc. days, subsequently defining observation periods.\nPut simply, in the remainder, measures labelled as e.g. \u201cperiod 4\u201d will refer to the state of the\nnetwork aggregated over the first 4 years in the case of scientists, or over the first 2 months\nin the case of bloggers.\nThis number of eight periods originally comes from the granularity of the bibliographical\ndatabase, which is of one year. For matters of comparison, we therefore also defined the\nsame number of periods for bloggers, corresponding in this case to two weeks. This choice\n6\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n104\n105\n106\nperiod\nnu\nm\nb\ner\nof\nli\nnk\ns\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n103\n104\n105\nperiod\nnu\nm\nb\ner\nof\nli\nnk\ns\nFigure 2: Total number of links in the social and socio-semantic networks (red triangles: social\nlinks, blue squares: socio-semantic links).\nis also relevant in that both networks grow in comparable proportion between the first and\nthe last period thus defined, where links increased by a factor 10 to 15 as shown on Fig. 2.\nIn other words, over 90% of the links of the final network were not present during the first\nperiod. As we shall see, such vigorous dynamics surprisingly lead to a noticeable stability\nof the structural characteristics of these communities.\n3.4 Qualitative description and quantitative estimation\nSNA matches formal structures with sociologically relevant descriptions. In particular, we\nbroadly elaborate upon role and position analysis (Faust and Wasserman, 1992) to exhibit\nconnections between individual configurations and global structures (Freeman, 1989), be-\ntween qualitative features and algebraic properties as \u201cpatterns\u201d or \u201cstylized facts\u201d charac-\nterizing the network (Pattison and Wasserman, 1995; Anderson et al., 1992). Instead of detail-\ning the specificities of every sub-community of the network, we will thus adopt a naturalist\nrather than ethnographic approach by endeavoring at exhibiting systematic and quantitative\nstructural and behavioral patterns (Callon, 2001). Therefore, as we will be mostly interested\nin the dynamical structure of these epistemic networks, we will not investigate thoroughly\nthe qualitative context of link creation (content of the collaboration, conditions of a citation,\nactual exchange of knowledge, etc.).\nWe will therefore describe, firstly, a series of simple stylized facts \u2014some appropriate to\nsocial networks in general, others specific to epistemic networks\u2014 which will notably inform\nus about the existence of hierarchies and aggregation phenomena. More generally, we will\nbe interested in characterizing heterogeneous or homogeneous features in each network, at\nthe macro and micro level, on both social (interactional) criteria and semantic, and both in\na static and dynamic setting. We will also endeavor at choosing stylized facts among the\nsimplest possible.\nAdopting a more micro-level perspective, focused on individual behaviors, we will sec-\nondly exhibit non-uniform interaction mechanisms \u2014again, some being generic, others be-\ning proper to epistemic networks\u2014 which are dynamically linked to the observed stylized\nfacts. In more details, when analyzing the role of agents we will systematically estimate\nto what extent the empirical behavior of link creation diverges from a uniformly random\n7\nsetting; because e.g. of homophilic behavior, structural constraints, etc. Since we will sys-\ntematically apply this approach throughout the paper, we technically present herebelow the\nvery toolbox which we will be using.\nMeasuring agent behavior through interaction propensities. There are indeed several tra-\nditional methods to estimate quantitatively interaction preferences, through regression mod-\nels aiming at statistically estimating structural and non-structural parameters which influ-\nence describe the diverse contributions of varied types of preferences; most notably, either:\n\u2022 by assuming that the probability of dyad formation directly depends on various pa-\nrameters proper to agents or to the network structure (Holland and Leinhardt, 1981;\nWasserman and Weaver, 1985; Lazega and van Duijn, 1997; Liben-Nowell and Klein-\nberg, 2003; Powell et al., 2005),\n\u2022 by using \u201cMarkov-chain\u201d-based models (Wasserman, 1980), for instance by assuming\nthat agents are maximizing an objective function depending on these very parameters\n(Snijders, 2001),\n\u2022 or, very simply, by computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards\nsome kind of agents, relatively to the proportion of these agents in the whole network\n(Barab\u00e1si et al., 2002); in other words, in fine, relatively to a uniformly random network\nevolution model (a la Snijders, 1981, for instance).\nWe conform here to the latter framework, which is the most basic method, our aim be-\ning mainly to describe in a simple manner behavioral disparities with respect to particular\nproperties, while being able to distinguish the disparities in function of the various values\nof these properties. Put simply, we wish to draw histograms of propensities for each value\nof the given property: we thus make no assumption on the shape of propensity functions\n(linear, quadratic, exponential, monotonous, etc.). On the other hand, this framework is too\nelementary to easily account for complex correlations between variables. In other words, our\napproach is not holistic since we ignore the simultaneous effect of parameters with respect\nto each other; contrarily to several above-mentioned methods such as (Snijders, 2001).\nTo sum up, we will simply focus on the ratio between (i) links which effectively appeared\nbetween some kinds of actors or dyads and (ii) links which could have appeared in a uni-\nformly random setting, ceteris paribus. We assume that the interaction propensity of actors\nwith respect to a given property m can be formally described by a function f of m: f(m)\nrepresents the conditional probability P (L|m) that an agent of type m receives a link L (resp.\nthat a dyad of type m appears). It is thus f(m)\/f(m\u2032) times more likely that an agent of\ntype m participates in an interaction than an agent of type m\u2032 (resp. that a dyad of type m\nrather than of type m\u2032 appears). It is possible to estimate simply this preferential propensity\nthrough f\u02c6 such that f\u02c6(m) = \u03bd(m)N(m) if N(m) > 0, 0 otherwise, where \u03bd(m) denotes the number\nof new link extremities which are pointing to agents of type m (resp. the number of dyads of\ntype m which are created) during a time period, and N(m) typically denotes the number of\nagents (resp. of dyads) of type m.\nThis will enable us to determine the interaction propensity in function of actor or dyad\nproperties. Because we assume that the network is growing, we only consider entirely new\nlinks, i.e. appearing between dyads which were not previously linked. Proceeding in this\n8\ndirection, it will in particular be possible to appraise the notion of homophily, which de-\nscribes the propensity of an agent to interact preferentially with another agent because s\/he\nis similar. Heterophily, on the other hand, describes the opposite phenomenon and, more\nbroadly, it is possible to formally apprehend these processes as the preferential interaction of\nsome kind of agent with some other kind of agent (Degenne, 2004).\n4 Hierarchies\n4.1 Heterogeneity of social & semantic capitals\nDegree centrality as \u201ccapital\u201d. Degree centrality, or \u201cdegree\u201d, is a simple measure of agent\nconnectivity (Freeman, 1978) and may in fine account for a more or less dominant position\nwithin a network. In an epistemic network, degree centrality may be interpreted diversely\ndepending on whether the social or the socio-semantic network is being observed. Similarly,\ndegree centrality bears distinct meanings in directed settings depending on whether links\nare received (in-bound) or given (out-bound).\nIn the social network, which is growing by definition here, we define the neighborhood\nof a node i with V(i)t = {j | \u2203t\u2032 \u2264 t, (j, i, t\u2032) \u2208 RS}, the social degree of i denoted by k(i)t is\n|V(i)t|: degree exactly corresponds to the total number of past interactors or referrals during\nthe whole observation period.\nIn this sense, degree may be apprehended as social capital in a very minimal manner, if it\nsimply accounts for a structural capital linked to past interactions in a collaboration network\nor to an indirect measure of authority in a citation context (Cole and Cole, 1973). In both\ncases, and at least partially, it thus provides information about a kind of social stratification\nat work within the community. More broadly, since our intention is not to carry a detailed\nstudy of the various aspects of social capital \u2013 including its management or representation\nby actors \u2014 we adopt a basic understanding of the term \u201ccapital\u201d, while keeping in mind its\neminently structural aspects: we therefore endeavor at measuring structural capital in that it\n\u201cfacilitates some forms of social capital\u201d (Coleman, 1988).\nEquivalently, degrees of agents in terms of socio-semantic relations may be loosely inter-\npreted as semantic capital: in other words, the number of concepts an actor has previously\nused is likely to render the variety of topics s\/he has dealt with in the epistemic network.\nThe socio-semantic degree of i at t therefore measures the number of concepts i used at t and\nis denoted by:\nkC(i)t = |V(i)Ct = {c such that \u2203t\u2032 \u2264 t, (i, c, t\u2032) \u2208 RC}|\nContrasting degree values across agents and notably exhibiting a hierarchical structure in\nthe macroscopic distribution of kC may thus inform us about the configuration of cultural\ncapital.\nHeterogeneity. The distribution of social degree centrality has benefited from a strong in-\nterest in the literature, especially in the very case of scientific networks; first, indirectly, by\nLotka (1926) through the distribution of the number of published papers and by de Solla Price\n(1965) through the number of cited paper (Subramanyam, 1983) \u2014 then, more recently, by\nBarab\u00e1si et al. (2002), Newman (2004) and Redner (2005). Hindman et al. (2003) and Adamic\nand Glance (2005) have carried similar studies in the case of political opinion websites.\n9\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n100 101 102\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nk\np\n(k\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n2\n4\n\u00b5\nperiod\n\u03c3\n100 101 102\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nk\np\n(k\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\u00b5\nperiod\n\u03c3\nFigure 3: Distributions of \u201csocial capital\u201d, i.e. degree centrality in the social network.

Continuous line: best log-normal fit.\nInset: evolution of \u00b5 and \u03c3 over 8 periods.\nThe study of semantic capital, on the other hand, has remained mostly overlooked. We\nnotice on Figs. 3 & 4 that semantic and social capital distributions are similar, in the sense\nthat they exhibit the same kind of heterogeneity: a small yet non-negligible number of agents\nhave used many concepts. Empirically, this kind of distribution is traditionally said to be\napproximated by a \u201cpower-law\u201d, or \u201cZipf law\u201d (or \u201cPareto law\u201d) even if, quite often, this fit\nonly accounts for the right part of the distribution (higher values). Frequently, distributions\nactually exhibit a roughly flat shape for lower values of the variable, followed by a sharp\ndecrease for higher values, which asymptotically appears to tend towards a straight line in\na log-log setting \u2014 in which case, a \u201clog-normal\u201d distribution appears to be much more\nadequate. On Figs. 3 & 4 empirical data is thus fitted using this reference distribution.\nWithout debating further which analytical probability distribution would be the most\nrelevant to describe the empirical data, it is worth noting that, in all generality, these distri-\nbutions are spread on several orders of magnitude, which is typical of a strong heterogeneity\nbetween agents. It is additionally mostly asymmetrical: there is a non-negligible number\nof agents with a high degree, while more and more agents have lower and lower degrees.\nThese two features confirm the hierarchical structure of both social and semantic capital in\nboth networks.\nHierarchical homogeneity. This stratification is, however, not deprived of various forms of\nhomogeneity. Scientists who already had a high number of collaborations are likely to have\nlinks with similarly \u201crich\u201d scientists, while agents with a lower social capital are here gener-\nally linked to equally \u201cpoor\u201d collaborators. As shown on Fig. 5, zebrafish embryologists are\nassortative, like other kinds of scientists (Newman, 2002). As such, connections among rich\nagents are homogeneous in the sense that similar agents flock together. On the other hand,\nno such trend is observable on bloggers: rich agents are equally likely of being cited by all\ntypes of agents, while they also cite rich agents no more often than poor agents (because of\nthe directedness of the network we distinguished these two cases). In this case, connections\nare indifferently homogeneous in the sense that all agents have similarly rich neighborhoods\n10\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n100 101 102\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nkc\np\n(k\nc\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n\u00b5\nperiod\n\u03c3\n100 101 102\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nkc\np\n(k\nc\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n2\n4\n\u00b5\nperiod\n\u03c3\nFigure 4: Distributions of semantic capital.

In the directed case of the blogosphere, at right, squares describe mean\nneighbor degrees of blogs cited by ego whereas triangles correspond to blogs citing ego.\n(both in- and out-bound).\nIn the two cases anyhow, the resemblance of the heterogeneity observed for both types\nof capital incites to look for some possible correlation between the two variables. Formally,\nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficient for scientists is 0.67, which traditionally renders a relatively\nsensible correlation, while it is 0.38 for bloggers, a much less significant value. These facts\nhave to be contrasted with the density map of the joint values of each capital (Fig. 6). This\nmap indeed confirms that there exists a wide range of possible combinations of joint values\nof semantic and social capital. For instance, while scientists with a small social capital are\nbound to have a limited semantic capital, this does not seem to be the case in the blogosphere\n\u2014 admittedly, rarely-cited bloggers may address a large range of topics, whereas weakly-\nlinked researchers are generally on narrow issues. On the other hand, it seems to be hardly\npossible for a blogger to have a large social degree without having a large semantic capital,\nto the contrary of scientists who may be socially rich but semantically focused.\n11\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0 \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nk\nk\nc\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0 \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nk\nk\nc\nFigure 6: Joint distributions of social and semantic capitals: circle diameters are proportional\nto the number of agents having a couple of degrees (k, kC).\nOn the whole, denser areas on these maps have very distinct positions in the two cases:\nmost scientists are spread in the bottom-left part of the diagram (where no striking corre-\nlation exists between social and semantic capitals), while bloggers are mostly located in an\nupper-left triangle (where it is impossible to correlate a high semantic capital with any partic-\nular level of social capital or, symmetrically, to correlate a low social capital with a particular\nvalue of semantic capital). Beyond the straightforward observation that both types of capital\nare not necessarily bound to match, this phenomenon suggests that processes underlying the\nappearance of social and socio-semantic links may obey distinct rationale. This supports the\nrelevance of a disjoint study of their dynamics, as will indeed be confirmed herebelow.\n4.2 Dynamic hierarchies\nAt a macroscopic level, the very hierarchical structure that is observed for higher degrees\nis stable during time: all degree distributions roughly exhibit the same trend for all periods,\nand the value of the \u03c3 parameter of the log-normal fit, which describes the tail, is indeed\nstable. This stability is generally surprising, since both networks are growing at a remarkable\npace, as mentioned in Sec. 3.3: most agents and\/or links present at the last period were not\ninitially active. As such, assuming a correspondence between centrality distributions and\nhierarchical structures, this process can be likened to \u201cspinning-top models\u201d (Lazega et al.,\n2006) where top position configurations are temporally stable, even when their members are\nreplaced at a sustained rate. Here, social and semantic hierarchies are thus dynamically stable.\nFurthermore, these hierarchies are obviously not typical of networks where links would\nform in an uniformly random manner (as is the case with the model of Erdo\u02dds and R\u00e9nyi, 1959,\noften considered as a null-model of social network morphogenesis). This supports a further\ninvestigation of the shape of interaction processes and preferences (as will also be carried\nthroughout the paper: see therefore \u00a75.1 & \u00a75.2.1). Put differently, is there a dynamic relation\nbetween relational and cultural wealth at a local level which underlies, or even echoes, these\nmacro-scale observations?\nTo briefly sum up, we principally notice two types of regularities and correlations re-\ngarding socially \u201crich\u201d agents, i.e. those who have received most links: (i) they are in a stable\n12\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nk\nf\u02c6\n(k\n)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nk\nf\n(k\n)\nFigure 7: Interaction propensity f\u02c6 with respect to social capital k.

Agent preferences in link creation could therefore\nrelevantly be appraised in order to determine whether a possible reinforcement of these sim-\nilarities is at work: is relational or semantic wealth a robust predictor of new collaborations\nor citations?\nUsing the methodology presented in \u00a73.4, we estimate interaction propensities f and\nfC with respect to social and semantic capitals k and kC, respectively. We approximately\nconfirm the assertion that propensities are roughly proportional to the degree (Figs. 7 & 8),\ni.e. social links preferentially go to agents having higher degrees both in the social and se-\nmantic dimensions. In the very case of social capital in scientific networks, this result also\npartially corroborates previous works by Jeong et al. (2003) (let us mention that an identical\nphenomenon has also been described in scientific citation networks by de Solla Price (1976);\nthese findings provide a quantitative sketch of capital accumulation dynamics in scientific\ncommunities in terms of both interactions and authority attributions). Yet, more interest-\ningly, comparing propensities between the two cases reveals that they are sensibly different:\nindeed, linking propensities are much flatter for bloggers, and poorer bloggers tend to be\nless disadvantaged in receiving links. This in turn echoes the relatively more pronounced\nunassortativeness of the blogger network, as said above.\nAdditionally, these increasing propensities can be interpreted indifferently (i) as a roughly\nincreasing preferential attachment to agents with higher degrees or, as well, (ii) as a stronger\nactivity from agents with higher capital: more active scientists participate in more authoring\nevents, thus creating\/receiving mechanically more links, whereas more active bloggers post\nmore, thus providing opportunities for being cited more, irrespective of their present degree.\nAt this point, these two interpretations are both consistent with observed propensities.\nYet, we could notice that the activity of scientists correlates almost perfectly with social and\nsemantic capitals, while the activity of bloggers is much less correlated with capitals \u2014 on\n13\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nkc\nf\n(k\nc\n)\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nkc\nf\n(k\nc\n)\nFigure 8: Interaction propensity f\u02c6C with respect to semantic capital kC.\nthe whole, activity graphs in both cases imitate propensity trends. This latter interpretation\nputs the focus on activity rather than attraction and diverges from what is usually proposed\nin studies dealing with the notion of \u201cpreferential attachment\u201d (see e.g. Barab\u00e1si and Al-\nbert, 1999, \u201c(...) a new actor is casted most likely in a supporting role, with more established, well-\nknown actors (...)\u201d). By contrast, it is more consistent with traditional sociological interpreta-\ntions where, for instance in scientific communities, the number of papers, thus collaboration\nevents, are simply proportional to research activity (Gordon, 1980). More broadly, these\nobservation cast doubt on usual assertions regarding increasing propensities as a universal\nphenomenon related to attractivity, rather than a context-dependent process correlated with\nactivity.\n5 Communities and neighborhoods\nBeyond the observation of hierarchical features it is possible to investigate cohesion between\nagents, in a broad sense. We start with a strictly social and somewhat usual point of view\n(\u00a75.1) to extend the formalism to a socio-semantic perspective, introducing both local and\nlarge-scale motifs (\u00a75.2).\n5.1 Social cohesiveness\nLocal cohesiveness may be appraised in a very basic manner through the population of tri-\nads (Holland and Leinhardt, 1976; Snijders and Stokman, 1987) which more precisely ex-\nhibits how and how much neighbors of an agent are also neighbors (or not). In particular,\nthis notion may refer to two different kinds of topological feature and underlying behaviors:\nclustering, or the proportion of neighbors of ego who are also direct neighbors, and transitiv-\nity, or the fact that a neighbor of a neighbor of ego becomes a neighbor of ego. Several kinds\nof triads have been found to be significantly frequent in many social networks (Watts and\nStrogatz, 1998; Milo et al., 2004) while this topological feature, along with degree centrality,\nhas also been the target of many recent models (Pattison et al., 2000; Jin et al., 2001).\nHere, beyond appraising the social cohesiveness of our epistemic networks, we are also\ninterested in the way the social and semantic capital of an agent may be correlated to its\n14\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n(undirected case) (directed case)\nclustering c3 transitivity t3\n?\ni\n(ego)\nj\nj'  \ni\n(ego)\n?\nj\nj'  \nclustering c3 transitivity t3\n?\ni\n(ego)\nj\nj'  \ni\n(ego)\n?\nj\nj'  \n0 5 10 15 20 25\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nc 3\n(k\n)\nk\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nt 3\n(k\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nperiod\nc 3\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nt 3\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nc 3\n(k\n)\nk\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nt 3\n(k\n)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nperiod\nc 3\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nt 3\nFigure 9: Clustering c3 (blue triangles) and transitivity t3 (red squares). Top: decriptions of\npatterns. Below: values with respect to social capital k (insets: evolution of average values).\ntendency to belong to closed triads. More precisely, we first define, indifferently for both\ndirected and undirected networks:\n\u2022 the clustering coefficient c3 of an agent i as the proportion of links between pairs of\nagents who cited or collaborated with i: c3(i) =\n|(j, j\u2032) \u2208 V(i)2 such that j\u2032 \u2208 V(j)|\nk(i) (k(i)\u2212 1)\n\u2022 the transitivity coefficient t3 of i as the proportion, among paths of length 2 to i (i.e.\nfrom neighbors of neighbors of i), of paths of length 1 (i.e. direct neighbors):\nt3(i) =\n|(j, j\u2032) \u2208 V(i)2 such that j\u2032 \u2208 V(j)|\n|(j, j\u2032) such that j \u2208 V(i) and j\u2032 \u2208 V(j)|\nThese patterns are schematized on Fig. 9, with the corresponding empirical results for\nboth networks. We plotted the clustering and transitivity coefficients against social capital at\nthe last period of our datasets as well as the evolution of the average over the whole network\nof these coefficients: c3 = \u3008c3(i)\u3009, t3 = \u3008t3(i)\u3009. To the contrary of several other results of this\npaper, we did not find any significant relationship between the semantic capital and social\ncohesiveness.\nWe found however two dimensions of constrast with respect to social capital: on one\nhand, c3 vs. t3, on the other hand, scientists vs. bloggers. In all cases, all values are well\nabove what would usually be expected in a network exhibiting the same density. We ver-\nified this through series of simulations on uniformly random networks (Erdo\u02dds and R\u00e9nyi,\n1959). The collaboration network feature very high c3 and t3 values, with respectively 2 and\n15\n3 orders of magnitude above the random case; the blog network is approximately one or-\nder of magnitude above this null model. First, c3 is related to the density of the immediate\nsurroundings of ego. It is decreasing with the social degree in both networks, indicating\nthat the most connected agents tend to have a less clustered neighborhood. This decreasing\nshape also corroborates previous studies and seems to be a classical bias of local clustering\nmeasurement (for an extensive discussion, see Soffer and V\u00e1zquez, 2005).\nThis is in stark contrast with the behavior of t3, almost constant in the scientific case, and\nsignificantly increasing for bloggers; t3 apparently does not suffer from the above-mentioned\nbias concerning c3. The trend of t3 in the blog case shows that agents with higher social\ncapital tend to have attracted comparatively more links originating from their neighbors of\nneighbors than lower social capital nodes. This effect does not seem to hold in the zebrafish\nnetwork, which is undirected \u2014 this property indeed induces some uncertainty in the inter-\npretation of the behavior of ego, as it is obviously impossible to tell from the data if ego is\nthe target or the initiator of a transitive triad, admittedly undirected.\nTransitive processes. Admittedly, both measures capture significantly different ego-centered\nproperties, as well as probably distinct underlying behaviors. Nonetheless, their average val-\nues seem pretty stable over time on both networks, as evidenced by insets on Fig. 9 which\ndescribe the evolution of averages of both clustering and transitivity coefficients, and even if,\nagain, a massive number of new links (for blogs and scientists) and new agents (for scientists\nonly) are added during time (Fig. 2).\nIn a dynamic setting, and with no ambition to fully decipher the underpinning of these\npeculiar triadic landscapes, we can partially investigate the shape of the behaviors of local\ntriad formation. We do this by measuring to what extent agents create links with neighbors\nof neighbors (i.e., how have neighbors of neighbors of an agent become direct neighbors?).\nWe achieve this by estimating the propensity of link formation with respect to the social\ndistance d, which is the smallest number of steps one has to navigate from an agent to a given\nagent. In a broader perspective, it is altogether possible to examine to what extent links are\nforming towards \u201clonger-distance neighbors\u201d, at distances larger than 2. Exceptionally, and\nwithout losing in generality, we also computed the propensity for link reiterations, that is,\nrepeated citations or interactions, which corresponds to d = 1. To reframe the corresponding\npropensities, we first show the global distribution of distances between all possible actor\npairs, for each network, on Fig. 10. As can be seen, there are many more couples of actors at\na higher distance.\nPropensity results are next gathered on Fig. 11 \u2014 note that we grouped all values for dis-\ntances strictly above 4 as they were roughly identical. When a link at distance two is formed,\na triad appears; and we can first notice that there is empirically a much higher propensity for\nthis kind of links to form. There is, comparatively, an exponentially lower likeliness to form\nlinks at a longer distance, i.e. with more remote neighbors. In short, most new interactions\nare of a triadic nature and tend to reinforce the existing cohesiveness; hence shedding light\non the particularly high empirical values of c3 and t3. Yet, we can also notice that interaction\nrepetition is an even more significant source of link creation, signalling that, on the whole,\nonly a small proportion of links are created between agents which were not previously con-\nnected. Although apparently unconnected to semantic issues, we will demonstrate below\nthat this phenomenon also helps clarifying the existence of a strong homophily.\n16\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n1 2 3 4 >4\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsocial distance d\np\n(d\n)\n1 2 3 4 >4\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsocial distance d\np\n(d\n)\nFigure 10: Distribution of actors at social distance d.\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n1 2 3 4 >4\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsocial distance d\nf\u02c6\nd\n1 2 3 4 >4\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsocial distance d\nf\u02c6\nd\nFigure 11: Interaction propensity f\u02c6d with respect to social distance d.\n17\nc?\nBipartite clustering\ni\n(ego)\nc'\nj\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n10\u22121\n100\nperiod\nc 4\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n10\u22121\n100\nperiod\nc 4\nFigure 12: Socio-semantic clustering c4: schema (left) and evolution of average values (right).\n5.2 Socio-semantic aggregates\n5.2.1 Local semantic cohesiveness\nCould there be a socio-semantic equivalent to these strictly social cohesiveness and transi-\ntiveness? More broadly, are there socio-semantic aggregation patterns and processes proper\nto these epistemic networks? For instance, we may first investigate whether two agents\nsharing one concept are likely to share more. To this end, we define a bipartite clustering\ncoefficient c4 (Robins and Alexander, 2004) for the socio-semantic network, as the ratio of\ndiamonds around an agent (i.e. the probability that pairs of concepts used by an agent are\njointly used by another agent), as sketched on Fig. 12. As such, it is the most basic equivalent\nto the above-mentioned strictly social cohesiveness coefficients. Put formally, for agent i, we\nhave:3\nc4(i) =\n\u2211\n{c,c\u2032}\u2286VC(i)\n[\u03ba(c, c\u2032)\u2212 1]\n\u2211\n{c,c\u2032}\u2286VC(i)\n[kC(c) + kC(c\u2032)\u2212 \u03ba(c, c\u2032)\u2212 1]\nwhere \u03ba(c, c\u2032) is the number of agents linked to same same pair of concepts (c, c\u2032), i.e. \u03ba(c, c\u2032) =\n|j \u2208 S such that {c, c\u2032} \u2286 VC(j)|.\nAverage values for both networks on all periods are shown on Fig. 12. This semantic\ncohesiveness is high (between about 15 to 75%), and again, much higher than in equivalent\nsocio-semantic networks having the same density (two to ten times higher). No dependency\nwas found, however, with respect to social nor semantic capital.\nProximity and neighborhoods. This high local overlap between pairs of agents and con-\ncepts leads us to examine more thoroughly whether social and semantic neighborhoods co-\nincide. In other words, to what extent are agents semantically close to each other, in the\nnetwork and, more specifically, in their social neighborhood? To this end, we first need to\n3Alternative definitions of bipartite clustering, as previously proposed (Robins and Alexander, 2004; Lind\net al., 2005; ?), may diverge quantitatively from this measure, because they e.g. describe the ratio of closed cycles\nof length 4 over open cycles of length 4 (Zhang et al., 2007), or compute the ratio of diamonds directly over the\nwhole network. We checked that our qualitative results hold with these various formulas.\n18\ndefine a notion of semantic distance \u03b4 between pairs of agents. This distance should be such\nthat it increases from 0 to 1 with a decreasing proportion of shared concepts. We choose\na cosine-based distance \u03b4 based on the classical tf.idf framework (Salton et al., 1975) which\nassigns to each agent a semantic profile based on usage weights (rarer terms weigh more).\nNote that distances based on the Jaccard coefficient (Batagelj and Bren, 1995) yield similar\nresults (?).\nDistributions of semantic distances in both networks as plotted on Fig. 13 reveal that\nthere are on the whole few semantically similar agents, especially scientists. We can how-\never notice that neighbors (blue squares) are at a much smaller semantic distance, especially\nscientists, again. As for scientists, this phenomenon should not be surprising per se, since\ncollaborations induce links towards the same concepts, which mechanically produces simi-\nlarity among ex-coauthors4 \u2014 yet, even in that case, the semantic proximity of neighbors is\nextremely strong when compared with the rest of the network (with a discrepancy of about\nthree orders of magnitude for the smallest distances).\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsemantic distance \u03b4\np(\n\u03b4)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsemantic distance \u03b4\np(\n\u03b4)\nFigure 13: Semantic distance in the neighborhood (blue squares) and in the whole network\n(red triangles).\nSemantic homophily. In this sensibly homophilic landscape, insofar as social and seman-\ntic capitals influence agent behavior, we ought to examine as well the effect of the (static)\nsemantic proximity context on future interactions. As agents prefer to establish relationships\nwith similar fellows (for a review, see McPherson et al., 2001), it is indeed quite probable that\nthe topology of interactions is also modified by semantic profiles. To what extent, quantita-\ntively, could semantic proximity predict, dynamically, the likelihood of coauthoring papers,\nor citing others? This comes to quantitatively determine homophilic processes (as in Fien-\nberg and Wasserman, 1981; Lazega and van Duijn, 1997, for instance), yet in a co-evolving\nframework: here, semantic features jointly evolve with the successive reconfigurations of the\nsocial structure and agent semantic profiles (Roth, 2005; Crandall et al., 2008).\nUsing the same methodology as in the previous sections, we appraise semantic affinity-\n4Hence, note that this effect derives in part from an artifact of the protocol, or, plausibly, from an artifact\nproper to this kind of community if we assume that this property of the empirical protocol accounts for a real\nphenomenon (which is equivalent to saying that all collaborators have effectively adopted all concepts involved\nin the interaction \u2014 without elaborating further on this latter interpretation).\n19\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsemantic distance \u03b4\ng\u02c6(\n\u03b4)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nsemantic distance \u03b4\ng\u02c6(\n\u03b4)\nFigure 14: Homophilic propensity g with respect to semantic distance \u03b4.\nbased interaction propensities g using the above-mentioned semantic distance \u03b4. The trend\nof both graphs of g\u02c6 on Fig. 14 renders an overall behavior massively favoring link creation\nbetween agents displaying similar semantic profiles (recall that we only consider new link\ncreations, between agents not previously linked). Yet, regarding scientific collaboration, there\nis a slight preference for dissimilarity; i.e., in a strongly homophilic landscape as it is for\nthe zebrafish, we observe a moderate heterophily. Scientists favor interaction with scientists\nworking on similar topics, but not too much, granting a bit of diversity \u2014 by contrast, bloggers\ndisplay a much simpler homophilic behavior: g\u02c6 is just decreasing.\nWhile Fig. 13 describes a static homophily, i.e. ex-post, Fig. 14 describes a dynamic ho-\nmophily, i.e. ex-ante (that is, before agents become neighbors in the social network). On\nthe whole, these results suggest that, while bloggers are more strictly homophilic when cit-\ning than scientists when collaborating, the absence of an occasion to explicitly share topics\ndoes not make them sensibly similar a posteriori \u2014 they are less homophilic ex post, which is\nlikely to induce a larger spread of semantic profiles over the network, even within the very\nneighborhood. On the contrary researchers, who are putting together concepts when col-\nlaborating, get therefore much closer in comparison with the rest of the scientific network.\nPut differently, even if scientists who start a collaboration are not necessarily extremely close\nsemantically beforehand, they tend to become much closer afterwards5 \u2014 especially given\nthe high rate of interaction repetition as demonstrated on Fig. 11.\n5.2.2 Epistemic communities\nExtending this perspective, it is possible to describe agent groups typical of knowledge net-\nworks, on a large-scale basis: in particular, the present formalism can cast light on the ex-\nistence and configuration of epistemic communities. The term of \u201cepistemic community\u201d\n(EC) traditionally refers to the collaboration of agents who work (i) within the same epis-\ntemic framework and (ii) towards common and collective goals of knowledge production or\ninformation validation (Haas, 1992). In a scientific context, ECs therefore classically describe\n5This admittedly happens partly by construction of the network, since writing papers implies concept shar-\ning. Nevertheless, it cannot be dismissed that the protocol also accounts for a realistic interaction process: after a\ncollaboration, all authors indeed supposedly become acquainted with all concepts mentioned in a paper abstract.\n20\ns1 s2 s3s0 s4\nc1 c2 c3c0\nFigure 15: An epistemic community as a biclique of the socio-semantic network :\n{(s1, s2, s3), (c1, c2, c3)}.\ngroups of researchers advancing a field while recognizing a common set of conceptual tools\nand shared representations (Kitcher, 1995), within a paradigm. By analogy, in the context of\nonline communities ECs may loosely refer to subgroups of individuals who are addressing\nidentical issues or refering to similar topics \u2014 such as bloggers interested in similar political\nmatters (Hindman et al., 2003).\nIn order to identify these communities in a concise manner and relate them to simple\nsocio-semantic patterns, we adopt a strictly descriptive approach aiming at inventorying sets\nof topics and their actors. More precisely, we do not explicitly pay attention to how agents\nbehave with respect to deference, authority, or even knowledge transfer matters, as is often\nthe case in more qualitative works (Bourdieu, 1991; Lazega, 1992). Rather, we adopt a fun-\ndamentally structural notion which corresponds to configurations where groups of agents\nshare common groups of concerns, within an identical conceptual framework Haas (1992).\nAs such and for instance, the present study considers the whole \u201czebrafish\u201d community and\nthe whole political blogosphere as ECs of reference. In this respect, while our understanding\nof the notion of \u201cepistemic community\u201d seems to be admittedly restricted, it already con-\nstitutes a primary step in characterizing the limits of actual ECs \u2013 ECs within which actors\nelaborate locally knowledge, relevance judgments, etc.\nBicliques and ECs. We thus formally define an EC as a pair of a set of agents and a set\nof concepts, such that all agents share all concepts (or, dually, such that all concepts are\nshared by all agents). This pair of sets is maximal: it is not possible to find more agents\nsharing the same concepts, or more concepts share by all these agents. This definition exactly\ncorresponds to a biclique in the socio-semantic network, as a maximal set of agents linked to\na maximal set of concepts \u2014 see Fig. 15. Bicliques may appear as a generalization of the\nabove-mentioned socio-semantic clustering (c4) and, more broadly, to a loose understanding\nof the notion of structural equivalence (Lorrain and White, 1971). The EC pattern also defines\ncommunities at various levels of generality, encompassing a variable number of agents and\ntopics, and such that agents, like concepts, may simultaneously belong to several, possibly\noverlapping epistemic communities (Roth and Bourgine, 2005).\nThe identification of this kind of dual structure in networks has been the focus of several\nqualitative and quantitative(Breiger, 1974; Wille, 1992; Freeman, 1996; White and Duquenne,\n1996; Falzon, 2000; Roth and Bourgine, 2005; Lehmann et al., 2008) studies within the frame-\nwork of bipartite graphs. Freeman and White (1993) have notably shown how to jointly\ngroup agents and events they participate in. On the whole however, qualitative approaches\n21\nZEBRAFISH BLOGS\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\u00c8EC\u00c8\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n104\nNH\u00c8EC\u00c8L\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nperiod\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n\u0391\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\u00c8EC\u00c8\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n104\nNH\u00c8EC\u00c8L\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nperiod\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n\u0391\nFigure 16: Distribution of EC populations (number of agents), from period 1 (bottom curve)\nto period 8 (top curve). The zebrafish dataset is outlined on period 7, and fitted by a power-\nlaw tail (dashed thick line), it is period 3 for blogs. Insets correspond to the evolution of the\nexponent of the power-law fit, i.e. the structure of the set of most populated ECs.\nin SNA focus on social aspects and, often, on relatively local aspects \u2014 leaders, peripheral\nmembers, cooperation process within and\/or between groups. Here, we use these epistemic\nstructures not necessarily to focus on the role of particular individuals but, rather, in order\nto appraise which semantic groupings are the most salient quantitatively, in terms of popu-\nlation size. In other words, we carry a demographic study of the bicliques and compare the\nrelative weight of each epistemic community (and corresponding topic groupings) within\nthe whole population. To sum up and more to the point, thanks to the distribution of pop-\nulations of the various ECs it is possible to have an overview of the global landscape the\ndissemination of topics over agents in the epistemic network.\nDemographics of ECs. Additionally, focusing on larger groups yields a better insight of\nthe large-scale epistemic structure of the network. Noticing indeed that more complex and\nlonger lists of concepts correspond to smaller agent groups, ECs gathering few agents are\nlikely to be very specific and specialized, sometimes typical of single agents. On one hand,\ngiven a threshold on population sizes, a hierarchically overlapping representation of these\nlarger ECs could then give us a quick and compact insight on which main topic groups can\nbe found in the whole epistemic network and, more importantly, on their relative importance\n\u2014 for more details on this taxonomical approach, we refer to Roth and Bourgine (2006); ?. On\nthe other hand, and beyond this global epistemological picture, two elements are of interest\nto us here:\n(i) There is a particular structure of populated ECs. A significant number of groups of top-\nics gathers a significant share of the whole community, as demonstrated on the right\nside of the demographic graphs on Fig. 16 (because of computational complexity is-\nsues, we carried computations on a limited random sample of 150 agents from each\nempirical dataset). In other words, a relatively small yet substantial number of associ-\nations of topics are especially popular, while many concept sets gather smaller groups.\nPut shortly, this structure is heterogeneous: it is spread on several orders of magnitude\n22\nand there are also significantly more small ECs than populated ECs. Additionally, the\ntail of the distribution has a similar shape in both epistemic networks, for zebrafish and\nblogs. This tail partly characterizes the structure of the set of most populated ECs.\n(ii) Focusing on these larger ECs, thus on the distribution tail, we moreover notice that it\nexhibits a stable shape, in spite of significant micro-level variations. Excepted the very\nfirst period(s), power-law fits indeed remain within the same range for all periods, as\nshown on the insets on Fig. 16.While out of scope of the present paper, an historical\nstudy of the underlying taxonomy, in terms of ECs and sub-ECs, would additionally\ndemonstrate that the main thematics of zebrafish embryologists globally gather a sta-\nble proportion of the whole (growing) population (Roth and Bourgine, 2006; ?), even if\nsome new topics emerge. In other words, despite the fact that distributed knowledge\nproduction relies on a significantly increasing number of new agents, its organization\nis only slightly modified \u2014 which indicates the functional stability in time of the com-\nmunity (Pattison, 1993).\nBesides, the main ECs attract proportionally more agents with time, as evidenced by the\ntop-right progression of EC distributions on Fig. 16. Yet, when estimating the propen-\nsity to choose concepts at the core of the largest ECs relatively to less used concepts, we\ncan eventually notice that there is indeed a marked tendency, in both networks, to make\nproportionally more socio-semantic links towards more popular topics. This low-level\nbehavior, in turn, is plausibly likely to underlie the temporal reinforcement of the main\nECs.\n6 Conclusion\nWe aimed at introducing epistemic networks as a framework wherein knowledge commu-\nnities could be studied in a dual manner: social structural aspects on one side, echoed by\nsocio-semantic features on the other side. In this respect, our purpose was to convert several\nstrictly social indicators \u2014 which might have appeared familiar to the reader \u2014 into simple\nsocio-semantic analogs (see Tab. 1 for a summary). We have thus more broadly designed\nstylized facts proper to knowledge networks and revealed interaction processes which de-\npend on the epistemic network as a whole.\nIndependently of the peculiarities of each dataset, this epistemic framework renders (i)\nheterogeneities in both social and semantic dimensions (ii) which support hierarchies be-\ntween agents and which, in turn, are diversely homogeneous; and (iii) social and semantic\ncohesiveness, attested at both a local and a more global scale. Further, we could describe\nthe behavioral (ego-centered) counterpart of each of these observations by exhibiting higher\npropensities of link creation towards richer and semantically similar agents, in both cases.\nIn a dynamic perspective, this approach enabled us to characterize the coevolution of so-\ncial structures and semantic features by exhibiting the joint and reciprocal dependence of\nsocial linkages on the socio-semantic network. Semantic homophily, for instance, as well as\nsocio-semantic bicliques, could hardly be reduced to the strict social network. Additionally,\nnoticing that the vigorous dynamics of the networks did not prevent the existence of tem-\nporally stable patterns, we suggested that some properties of the low-level behavior tended\nmoreover to foster and reinforce the above-mentioned patterns.\n23\nproperties ZEBRAFISH BLOGS\nsocial capital k\nheterogeneous distribution, temporally stable\nassortative slightly disassortative\nsemantic capital kc\nheterogeneous distribution, temporally stable\npositively correlated with k diversely correlated with k\npropensity f to social capital increasing slightly increasing\npropensity fC to semantic capital increasing slightly increasing\nclustering (c3)\nvery high high\ndecreasing with k\ntemporally stable\ntransitivity (t3)\nvery high high\nstable with k growing with k\ntemporally stable\nsocial distance distribution higher proportion of pairs at a long distance\nsemantic distance distribution neighbors semantically closer\npropensity fd to social distance strongly decreasing\npropensity g to semantic distance\nslightly increasing for small \u03b4\nstrongly decreasing\nbefore decreasing strongly\nsocio-semantic clustering (c4) high, temporally stable\nepistemic communities heterogeneous distribution, temporally stable\nTable 1: Qualitative summary of the measures.\nIt would plausibly be useful to extend this framework to other communities than blog-\ngers and scientists in order to check the presence of the same kind of epistemic patterns. Are\nthere, also, some regularities in the behavior of agents which could be generic of knowledge\nnetworks, or at least observed in other kinds of epistemic networks \u2014 in particular between\ninteraction and citation networks? Beyond these results, once a description of these networks\nis available at both the macro- and micro-levels, a broader aspiration would then later con-\nsist in reconstructing the observed epistemic structures by simulating a dynamic epistemic\nnetwork, using assumptions designed after actual empirical measurements of agent-based\nbehavior. This kind of exercise would be useful in showing that a co-evolutionary morpho-\ngenesis of epistemic networks constitutes a plausible explanation for the observed patterns,\nas shown in the case of zebrafish scientists by ?.\nComputations of ECs were achieved using galois, an open-source program freely download-\nable from http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/networks-tb\u2013galois\nAcknowledgments.
