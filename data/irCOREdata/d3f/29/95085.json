This research studies married men\u2019s\nand women\u2019s informal caring for parents and parents-in-law. Although\nsingle people have a higher propensity to become carers (Dautzenberg et al.\n2000; Henz 2006; Johnson and Lo Sasso 2000), married parent carers\n* Department of Sociology, London School of Economics, London, UK.\nAgeing & Society 29, 2009, 369\u2013395. f 2009 Cambridge University Press 369\ndoi:10.1017\/S0144686X08008155 Printed in the United Kingdom\noutnumber single parent carers (Dwyer and Coward 1991; Office for\nNational Statistics 2002; Stone, Cafferata and Sangl 1987). Whereas\nmarried women\u2019s contribution is frequently acknowledged, the role of\nmarried men in parent caring is often questioned: \u2018 If a married man\u2019s own\nparents require care his wife is likely to provide the bulk of it, and where\nmarried men do provide informal care to an elderly parent living else-\nwhere, they have the added support of a wife to assist in caring and\nto service their own domestic needs \u2019 (Arber and Ginn 1991: 137). Past\nresearch, most of it based on US studies, has elaborated the key role\nthat wives play in their husbands\u2019 caring. Horowitz (1985b) reported that\nwives more often provided care for their husband\u2019s parents than husbands\nprovided for their parents-in-law. Gerstel and Gallagher (2001) observed\nthat men were \u2018drawn into caring\u2019 by their wives; that is, men cared a lot if\ntheir wives cared a lot.\nOther research on care-giving by couples has shown that couples di-\nrected more help to the wife\u2019s parents than the husband\u2019s parents\n(Lee, Spitze and Logan 2003; Shuey and Hardy 2003). Married men\u2019s\ncare might, therefore, often be care as sons-in-law. According to past re-\nsearch, sons-in-law provided little of the day-to-day caring (Brody and\nSchoonover 1986) and were merely assisting their wives (Qureshi and\nWalker 1989). When comparing sons-in-laws\u2019 and daughters-in-laws\u2019\ncaring, Horowitz\u2019s (1985b) results suggest a larger contribution from\ndaughters-in-law whereas others found little difference between the\namount of help that men and women provided to their parents-in-law in\nstudies limited to co-resident care (Arber and Ginn 1995a) or to employed\ncarers (Ingersoll-Dayton, Starrels and Dowler 1996). Another body of re-\nsearch that is relevant for assessing men\u2019s contribution to informal parent\ncare has suggested that men\u2019s caring has been under-represented in many\nstudies because they captured only a narrow range of care activities.\nWhere research included a wide range of helping and caring activities,\nmen\u2019s contribution has been more visible (Lee, Dwyer and Coward\n1993; Soldo, Wolf and Agree 1990; Spitze and Logan 1990; Stoller 1983,\n1990). Traditional male tasks demonstrated a higher male involvement\nthan traditionally female tasks (Dwyer and Seccombe 1991). In addition,\nMatthews (1995, 1998) has reported cases where men downplay their own\ncontribution to parent care.\nThe purpose of this research is to study couples\u2019 informal caring for\ntheir parents from two perspectives. The first part examines how the\nprovision of different caring tasks varied with the gender of the care-giver\nand the care-recipient as well as with their kinship relation. The second\npart examines under which circumstances sons-in-law and daughters-\nin-law participated in caring. These questions are addressed by analysing\n370 Ursula Henz\nBritish General Household Survey (GHS) data on 2,214 couples that cared for\nat least one parent at the time of the interview.\nBackground\nPast studies have drawn a rather detailed picture of the caring behaviour\nof individuals (Arber and Ginn 1995a ; Hirst 2001; Parker 1990). However,\nthe type and amount of caring might differ depending on whether a single\nperson provides help or whether there is a care-giver team like a couple, a\npair of siblings, or even a wider care network (Keating et al. 2003; Scott\nand Wenger 1995). The framework of this study builds on past research\nabout the division of care-giving between siblings and between spouses.\nWithin couples one would expect a child-in-law to provide less care than a\nchild because children are influenced by consanguinity (Kivett 1985) and\nby long-term commitments based on past reciprocities (Litwak 1985).\nGender roles\nThe vital role of women in informal caring, and especially the more per-\nsonal and domestic caring activities, has long been acknowledged (Arber\nand Ginn 1995a ; Horowitz 1985a ; Office for National Statistics 1998).\nCaring is considered to be a crucial part of female gender identity, and\ngender roles play an important part in dividing caring tasks between rela-\ntives (Graham 1983; Hequembourg and Brallier 2005). This implies that\nwomen are more committed to caring and that they have fewer \u2018 legitimate\nexcuses \u2019 for not providing care (Finch 1989). The division of informal care\nbetween spouses should reflect these role differences. Because they can\nappeal to the traditional female role, it is easier for men to ask their wives\nfor support with care for their parents, whereas gender roles make it more\ndifficult for women to enlist their husbands in caring (Litwak 1985). This\nleads to the first hypothesis :\nH1 Daughters-in-law are more likely than sons-in-law to support their spouses in the\ncare of their parents.\nCare-receiver\u2019s preferences\nAmong the factors that influence care-receiver\u2019s preferences are emotional\ncloseness, similarity of attitudes (Pillemer and Suitor 2006) and the quality\nof the relationship between the care-recipient and the potential carer\n(Matthews 1998). In addition, family members, including older parents,\nadopt cultural assumptions about what constitutes gender-appropriate\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 371\nbehaviour (Matthews 1995). Especially for the more intimate types of\ncaring, care-recipients might prefer a carer of the same gender (Arber and\nGinn 1995a). Many studies have found evidence in support of such a\n\u2018cross-sex taboo\u2019 (Arber and Ginn 1995a ; Lee, Dwyer and Coward 1993;\nPillemer and Suitor 2006; Stoller 1983), whereas no gender difference\nshowed up in Horowitz\u2019s (1985b) research. Arber and Ginn found no\nsupport for their hypothesis that the cross-sex taboo might be weaker in\nrelation to women caring for dependent men than the other way round\n(Arber and Ginn 1995a). The cross-sex taboo can be contrasted with\ngeneral hierarchies of preferences for carers as suggested by, for example,\nDooghe (1992) or Qureshi and Walker (1989). In both hierarchies daugh-\nters and even daughters-in-law rank higher than sons, meaning that they\nare preferred to sons as carers. Based on these considerations one can\nformulate two competing hypotheses :\nH2a For the most intimate types of caring the carer is more likely to be a person of the\nsame gender.\nH2b For the most intimate types of caring the carer is more likely to be female.\nCouples as care-giver teams\nIf a couple provides care, they can arrange these tasks in different ways.\nThe \u2018principle of substitution\u2019 (Shanas 1979) would imply that the ma-\njority of eldercare is assumed by one individual with other family members\nperforming necessary tasks when the primary care-giver is not available\n(Shuey and Hardy 2003). This can be contrasted with the \u2018 task-specific\nmodel \u2019, in which different groups of relatives are preferred for different\ntasks, including gendered preferences. In the research by Spitze and\nLogan (1990), different models applied to different caring tasks.\nStudies of spouses as \u2018secondary helpers \u2019 have shown that they sup-\nplement rather than complement the role of the primary care-giver\n(Penrod et al. 1995; Tennstedt, McKinlay and Sullivan 1989), and that one\nspouse is usually the primary carer whereas the other spouse assists in\ncaring. These observations present a static view of care-giving. One could,\nhowever, argue that caring arrangements adapt flexibly to the care needs\nof the elderly person. Two scenarios are possible, leading to two compet-\ning hypotheses. When caring by a primary carer gets more demanding\nand interferes with other areas of life, the spouse may step up his or her\nefforts to support and relieve the primary carer. This means that the\nspouse increases her or his caring hours along with the hours provided by\nthe primary carer, and possibly even increases their share of caring hours.\nAn alternative scenario would be that both spouses provide light caring\n372 Ursula Henz\nduties together as part of their social lives, but when the care needs get\nheavier, one of them takes over the main burden. This would imply that\nthe number of care hours of the secondary helper would stabilise and that\nhis or her share of the total hours of care for the parent decreases. The two\ncompeting hypotheses can be summarised as follows:\nH3a The more care a couple provides the more one spouse specialises in caring.\nH3b The more care a couple provides the more equally they share the task.\nEmployment\nInformal caring affects men\u2019s and women\u2019s employment in different ways\n(Arber and Ginn 1995b). Even when carrying a rather heavy caring\nburden of at least 20 hours per week, men combined it more often than\nwomen with paid work, and among those who were in paid work, more\nmen than women were working full-time (Office for National Statistics\n1998, Table 25). It was also more common among women than men to\nleave the labour market in connection with caring (Henz 2004), supporting\nobservations that employment acts as a buffer that limits men\u2019s availability\nfor caring (Stoller 1983; Ungerson 1987) but not women\u2019s (Stoller 1983).\nIn practice, this might mean that men obtain a higher level of support\nfrom their spouses than female carers do (Horowitz 1985b). If a couple has\nalready been practising the traditional specialisation into market work and\nhousework, it could be perceived as natural that the woman takes on the\nadditional family-oriented task of caring. However, with the increasing\nrate of female labour-force participation, employment might become also\na \u2018 legitimate excuse\u2019 for women for not caring or for setting limits to their\ncaring. This might be more so for daughters-in-law than for daughters\nbecause the expectations about their caring tend to be lower than for\ndaughters. Women\u2019s increasing levels of employment might also put\nmore pressure on men to provide care especially for their own parents.\nThis could mean that men\u2019s full-time employment by itself ceases to be a\nlegitimate excuse for not caring, but that the joint employment pattern of\nthe couple needs to be considered.\nTime-budget considerations suggest that part-time workers provide\nmore informal care than full-time workers. Previous British studies have\nfound, however, that part-time working women had the same propensity\nof becoming a carer as full-time working women (Henz 2006), nor was\nthere a difference between part-time workers and full-time workers in\nleaving work when they started caring (Henz 2004, 2006). Part-time\nworkers changed their working hours more flexibly in response to their\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 373\ncaring commitments. These patterns might suggest that part-time work is\na legitimate excuse for not caring, but that once involved, part-time\nworkers provided more hours of care. These considerations can be sum-\nmarised in three hypotheses :\nH4a Full-time working children-in-law provide less care than children-in-law who are\nnot in the labour market.\nH4b Children-in-law provide more care if their spouses are working full-time.\nH4c Part-time working daughters-in-law are equally likely to be involved in caring\nas full-time working daughters-in-law, but on average they provide more hours\nof care.\nCo-residence\nOnly a small and declining proportion of elderly British men and women\nlive with their children (Falkingham and Grundy 2006), most of them with\ntheir daughters (Grundy 1992). As most personal care is provided within\nthe household (Office for National Statistics 1998; Pickard 2002), one\nwould expect couples to provide more intensive care to co-resident parents\nthan to other parents. Doty, Jackson and Crown (1998) reported that co-\nresidence of a female primary care-giver with the care-recipient increased\nthe likelihood of obtaining help from other sources. They hypothesised that\n\u2018 if a female primary care-giver \u2026 wants to obtain more supplemental in-\nformal help from her husband \u2026 she is most likely to obtain this help if she\ncan bring the care-recipient into her home\u2019 (p. 341). Similarly, Tennstedt,\nCrawford and McKinlay (1991) found that co-residence increased sons\u2019 or\nsons-in-law\u2019s involvement in caring. This leads to the final hypothesis :\nH5 Co-residence of the care-recipient is associated with higher levels of shared caring by\nthe couple.\nData and methods\nData\nThe research used data from the 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 waves of the\nBritish General Household Survey (GHS) (Office for National Statistics 2000;\nOffice of Population Censuses and Surveys 1985, 1990, 1995), each pro-\nviding a representative sample of the British adult population. In the\nfour selected years, all adult household members were asked about infor-\nmal caring at the time of the interview. Informal carers were identified\nas people who \u2018 look after or give special help to someone who is sick,\n374 Ursula Henz\nhandicapped or elderly \u2019. In 2000, the term \u2018disabled\u2019 was used instead\nof \u2018handicapped\u2019 and the qualification \u2018other than in a professional\ncapacity \u2019 was added. Informal carers who only provided financial help or\nwhose care-recipient lived in an institution have been excluded as well as,\nin the last two surveys, informal carers whose care-recipients had only\ntemporary care needs.\nThe combined data set includes 20,335 couples. After excluding 39 cases\nin 1990 and 322 cases in 1985 for not providing the total number of care-\nrecipients and an unclear case in 2000, 2,214 couples remained with at\nleast one spouse providing informal care for a parent or parent-in-law at\nthe time of the interview. Some further cases with missing values for the\nweekly hours of caring or the particular tasks performed were also ex-\ncluded.\nThe large sample of caring couples allows comparatively detailed\nanalyses of their caring patterns. It is possible to carry out separate\nanalyses by gender and kinship. Other advantages of the data set are that\nboth spouses reported their own caring, thus avoiding reporting bias from\na single informant; and the rather broad selection of caring tasks, where\ntraditionally male tasks were explicitly listed among the examples for\n\u2018helping with paperwork or financial matters \u2019 and \u2018other practical help\u2019,\ncountered the linkage of women to most chores. The weaknesses of the\nGHS are that there is no general information about the care needs of\nparents and that information is incomplete about other care-givers for the\nsame care-recipient.\nVariables\nTypes of help and care provided. For each care-recipient, all GHS waves asked\nabout eight types of help or care that the respondent \u2018usually \u2019 provided for\nthe care-recipient : personal care; physical help; help with paperwork or\nfinancial matters ; other practical help; keeping company; taking him\/her\nout ; giving medicines ; keeping an eye on him\/her to see he\/she is all\nright. Arguably some tasks are not caring but just helping, for example\n\u2018keeping him\/her company\u2019. To identify the different dimensions of car-\ning covered by the eight tasks, separate exploratory factor analyses for all\neight gender and kinship-specific parent-child dyads were estimated (re-\nsults not shown here). All factor analyses of his or her caring for a mother\nor a father identified two factors : intensive care (personal and physical\ncare and giving medicines) and other care (all other tasks). Most factor\nanalyses of his or her care for a mother-in-law or a father-in-law revealed\nthree dimensions: intensive care (as above), medium care (practical help,\npaperwork and taking out) and light care (keeping company, keeping an\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 375\neye on him\/her) except women\u2019s care for a father-in-law where the in-\ntensive and the medium factors were merged. The factor analyses suggest\nthat all eight tasks are part of the same construct of caring, and that there\nis a group of children-in-law who are only involved in the light forms of\ncaring.\nThe hours of caring. Each carer has reported the number of weekly hours of\ncaring separately for each care-recipient by choosing one of the following\npre-coded time intervals : zero to four hours, five to nine hours, 10 to\n19 hours, 20 to 34 hours, 35 to 49 hours, 50 to 99 hours, or 100 or more\nhours.1 The intervals were the same in all surveys with two exceptions :\nthe 1985 survey used the intervals 20 to 29 hours and 30 to 49 hours, and\nthe 2000 survey used zero to 19 hours, the remaining intervals being the\nsame as in the other surveys. For this analysis the hours of caring were\ncomputed as the mid-point of the chosen time interval, with one excep-\ntion, and as 110 hours for the highest category of 100 hours or more. The\nexception concerns the zero-to-19-hours interval in the 2000 survey that\nwas coded into 4.9 hours, which corresponds to the average caring hours\nfor first and second dependants in the 1995 survey if the reported caring\nwas between zero and 19 weekly hours.\nMeasures of care needs. The multivariate models included two indicators that\napproximate the care-recipient\u2019s needs: the number of different caring\ntasks that the parent received from the couple and the number of hours of\ncare that the natural child provided for the respective parent. The number\nof different caring tasks that the parent received from the couple is not\nconstrained by the way the couple arranged its care-giving; single carers\ncan provide as many tasks as the couple together. Both measures only\ncapture care needs as far as they were met by the couple. Table 4 shows\nhow the two measures varied with the way the couple divided the caring\ntasks.\nFurther variables\nThe multivariate models also control for calendar year with values from 0\n(year 1985) to 3 (year 2000) to capture long-term trends in children-in-law\u2019s\ncaring. The variables \u2018Wife\u2019s age\u2019 and \u2018Husband\u2019s age\u2019 give their ages\nin years. The dummy variable for marital status takes the value one\nfor married couples and zero otherwise. The 1985 survey did not collect\ninformation about non-marital cohabitation. Because the shares of\ncohabitants were low in the later years and had presumably been even\nlower in 1985, the possible mistake of either misclassifying some cohabiting\n376 Ursula Henz\ncouples as married or of excluding cohabiting couples in 1985 should\noccur infrequently. The models also take husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s employ-\nment status into account. For men, any form of employment \u2013 part-time,\nfull-time or self-employment \u2013 is compared to all other labour-market\nstatuses. For women, the models distinguish between full-time work (more\nthan 25 hours per week), part-time work (up to 25 hours per week) and not\nbeing employed or self-employed. Table 1 gives descriptive statistics for\nthe independent variables in the multivariate models.\nAnalyses\nTo examine caring patterns by kinship status one needs to compare a son\u2019s\ncare with that of a son-in-law for the same type of care-recipient, and to\ncarry out corresponding comparisons for female carers. Same-sex pre-\nferences can be identified from differences in care provision of a daughter\nfor a father and a mother or between her care for a mother-in-law and a\nfather-in-law, and by the corresponding comparisons for sons.\nThe multivariate analyses include logit models for whether a son-in-law\nor a daughter-in-law, respectively, got involved in the care for a parent.\nThe analyses for sons-in-law are based on all couples where at least one of\nher parents received any care from the couple, and correspondingly for\ndaughters-in-law. Finally, for those sons-in-law and daughters-in-law who\nprovided any care linear regressionmodels were estimated to examine their\nhours of care. As the wives always provided care for their fathers-in-law if\nthey lived in the same household and for almost all mothers-in-law if they\nlived in the same household, the corresponding variables were omitted\nfrom the logit model for women\u2019s caring.\nResults\nOverall care-giving pattern\nTable 2 lists the different kinds of help and care provided by the couple to\nits parents. The first line gives the overall frequencies of elderly mothers\nand fathers who received any care. The woman\u2019s mother was most likely\nto receive any help followed by the husband\u2019s mother, the women\u2019s father\nand the husband\u2019s father. The pattern corresponds to known patterns of\ncaring: mothers receive more care from children than fathers, mostly be-\ncause fathers are more often cared for by their wives (Arber and Ginn\n1991) ; other possible reasons include differences in filial obligation, health\nproblems, or assertiveness in expressing care needs (Ingersoll-Dayton et al.\n1996). Table 2 also shows that the wife\u2019s parents received more help and\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 377\ncare than the husband\u2019s parents, as has also been reported in US studies\n(Lee, Spitze and Logan 2003; Shuey and Hardy 2003).2\nThe wife will often be referred to as \u2018 she\u2019 hereafter and mutatis mutandis\nthe same convention is used for the husband. Turning to the shares of \u2018his \u2019\nand \u2018her\u2019 caring that are given in the second to fourth row of Table 2, one\ncan see that in the vast majority of cases the sons and daughters provided\nT A B L E 1.

For example, in about\n40 per cent of all cases where her mother or father received care from the\ncouple, both spouses were involved, compared to 47 per cent in the case of\nhis parents. If his parents received any help, only 42 per cent of the con-\ncerned sons were sole carers in the couple compared to 57 per cent of\nwomen who were sole carers for her parents. In a few couples, only the\nchild-in-law provided care for the parent.\nThe results show that when a couple cared for his parents, (100\u201342=) 58\nper cent of daughters-in-law were involved compared to (100\u201357=) 43 per\ncent of sons-in-law who were involved in the care for her parents. One\ncould, therefore, conclude that daughters-in-law provided more care than\nsons-in-law, but this might not be true because more couples provided\ncare for the wife\u2019s parents. Altogether, 702 sons-in-law provided care\ncompared to 630 daughters-in-law (no table). Most couples cared for only\none parent at the time of the interview: of the 2,214 couples, eight cared\nfor all four parents at the time of the interview, 47 for three, 388 for two\nand 1,771 for just one parent.\nCouples division of single caring tasks\nThe lower part of Table 2 reports the frequencies and the caring ar-\nrangements for the eight different tasks. For all parents and parents-in-law,\npersonal care was the least common type of care together with \u2018giving\nmedicines \u2019. More common was receiving physical care, help with paper-\nwork, being taken out, being kept company, being \u2018kept an eye on\u2019 and,\nmost frequently, receiving other practical help. The most striking devi-\nation from the general pattern of couples\u2019 caring was with personal care.\nFor this, joint caring was the least common among all the tasks and the\ngender-specific bias was strongest : among those elderly people who re-\nceived personal care, the majority got it from a woman; only for their own\nfathers were men the primary providers of personal care (in the couple).\nA relatively high share of sons-in-law provided personal care for their\nwives\u2019 fathers without any involvement from her. Altogether the figures\ndisplay a propensity for the daughter to provide personal care for her\nparents and a propensity towards same-sex provision of personal care for\nthe husband\u2019s parents.\nA pattern similar to personal care appears also for physical care except\nthat the men were more often than their wives involved in the physical\ncare of their parents, and that more couples carried out the task together.\nDelivery of help with paperwork was the most gender-neutral of all tasks ;\nin about two-thirds of the cases it was delivered by the son or daughter,\n380 Ursula Henz\nrespectively, with relatively little sharing between the couple. The four\nmost frequent types of help \u2013 other practical help, keeping company,\ntaking out and keeping an eye on the elderly person \u2013 were shared to a\nhigher extent ; the percentages were in the low to mid-thirties for her\nparents and in the low to mid-forties for his parents. Women were more\noften the sole provider of the tasks to their parents (around 60 per cent)\nthan were men were to their parents (40 per cent to 48 per cent). Women\noverwhelmingly had the sole responsibility for giving medicines to their\nparents whereas the provision was more mixed for the husband\u2019s parents.\nHusband\u2019s and wife\u2019s hours of caring\nWhen comparing husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s hours of caring for a specific\nparent, one can distinguish: couples where both cared for about the same\nnumber of hours ; couples where both spouses cared but one provided\nmore hours than the other; and couples where only one spouse looked\nafter the parent. Figure 1 shows that when both spouses provided care for\nthe same person, they typically either shared equally or the child put in\nmore hours. Table 3 presents the hours of care by a child-in-law in relation\nto the hours provided by the natural child. The first row gives the child-\nin-law\u2019s hours of care when the natural child did not provide any care for\nthe parent. On average this amounted to 14 hours of care by the son-\nin-law and 13 hours of care by the daughter-in-law. From these cases one\ncan see that women who were sole carers for their husbands\u2019 parents\nwere on average less involved in the labour market than wives in other\ncaring couples, and that women who left the care of their parents to their\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nHer\nmother\nHer\nfather\nHis\nmother\nHis\nfather\nCare-recipient\nPe\nr c\nen\nt Male sole carer\nMale cares more\nBoth same hours\nFemale cares more\nFemale sole carer\nNote : The classification of care sharing is based on comparisons of spouses\u2019 hours of care.\nFigure 1. Distribution of care sharing by type of parent.\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 381\nhusbands were often in poor health. The remaining rows of Table 3\nspecify children-in-law\u2019s contribution when their spouse also provided\ncare for the parent. Column 2 shows that husbands\u2019 hours of care for their\nparents-in-law increased along with their wives\u2019 hours of care. For ex-\nample, when the daughter cared 60 to 99 hours for her parents, the hus-\nband provided on average 15 hours of care. Similarly, according to\ncolumn 6, wives\u2019 hours of care for their parents-in-law increased according\nto their husbands\u2019 hours ; when the son provided 60 to 99 hours of care to\nhis parents, his wife provided on average 51 hours. As the example shows,\nsons-in-laws\u2019 contributions were more modest than those of daughters-in-\nlaw. The average hours of care in columns 2 and 6 depend both on the\nshare of children-in-law who provided any care and the hours of care by\nthose who were involved in caring. Columns 4 and 8 give the shares of\nhusbands and wives, respectively, who provided care for their parents-in-\nlaw. For both husbands and wives, the likelihood of their involvement\nincreased with the hours of care by the spouse; for sons-in-law from about\none-third to two thirds, and for daughters-in-law from about half to all.\nColumns 5 and 9 give the average hours by children-in-law who actually\nprovided care, both displaying considerably higher caring hours than\ncolumns 2 and 6. Most strikingly, daughters-in-law who provided care for\ntheir parents-in-law more or less matched their husbands\u2019 caring hours.\nT A B L E 3.

As seen earlier, the most common caring arrangement was car-\ning by the natural child without any contribution from the spouse. The\nnext most common arrangement was that the couple carried out all caring\ntasks together ; nearly every fifth couple that cared for one of the husband\u2019s\nparents and every seventh couple that cared for one of the wife\u2019s parents\nshared all tasks. Another seven to 10 per cent of couples shared all tasks but\none. A rather large group of couples that cared for his parents shared some\ntasks but each spouse had additional tasks that were not shared. This\narrangement was less common in caring for her parents, in which it was\nmore common that the couple shared some tasks and the wife carried out\nsome additional tasks, especially when caring for her mother. The only\ndifferences between caring arrangements for mothers and fathers was that\nwhen caring for fathers it was less likely that a couple shared some tasks\nand only the woman carried out further tasks.\nThe second and third sections of Table 4 show how the division of\ncaring tasks was related to the number of hours provided by the couple.\nOn average, sole carers provided fewer hours and tasks than when the\nspouse was involved except for women who cared for their mothers : these\nwomen performed on average as many tasks as when both spouses shared\nall tasks. One can also see that the woman\u2019s mother received more help\nthan other parents.3\nMultivariate analyses of child-in-laws\u2019 caring\nHaving explored the extent to which couples shared their parent care, one\nwould like to know what distinguished couples that jointly looked after a\nparent from sole-carer couples. Columns 2 and 3 of Tables 5 and 6 give\nthe results from logit models that compare couples where the child-in-law\nwas caring with those where only the natural child provided care. They\nindicate that older husbands were more likely to participate in the care for\ntheir parents-in-law, whereas there was no age effect for daughters-in-law.\nThe odds of the child-in-law providing care were twice as high amongst\nthe married as against the unmarried couples. Whether the child-in-law\nparticipated in caring did not depend on the gender of the parent. Having\na parent living in the same household strongly increased the sons-in-law\u2019s\nodds of being involved in their care. As virtually all daughters-in-law were\ninvolved in caring for their parents-in-law if they lived in the same\nhousehold, the corresponding variables were not included in the models.\nThe more types of help the parent received, the more likely it was that the\nchild-in-law contributed to the caring. In other words, the greater the care\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 383\nT A B L E 4.

The hours of caring by the natural\nchild had no additional influence on whether the child-in-law was in-\nvolved. Women provided care for their husband\u2019s parents irrespective of\ntheir own or their husband\u2019s employment status. This differs from men\nwho were more likely to be involved in caring for their parents-in-law if\ntheir wives worked full-time.\nThe last two columns in Tables 5 and 6 give the results of the linear\nregression models for the hours of care provided by the son-in-law and the\ndaughter-in-law, respectively, if they provided any care for a parent-\nin-law. There were no significant differences in the hours of care by cal-\nendar year, age, marital status, or the gender of the care-recipient. If the\nparent-in-law lived in the same household as the couple, the hours of care\nby the daughter-in-law increased on average by over 30 hours per week.\nAlso sons-in-law provided significantly more care for the wife\u2019s mother\nif she lived in the same household, but the increase was more modest\nthan the corresponding increase for daughters-in-law. The husband\u2019s\ncare hours for his father-in-law did not increase significantly if the father-\nin-law lived in the same household. Furthermore, the caring hours of\nT A B L E 5.

Children-in-law also\nincreased their caring hours in line with their spouses\u2019 hours of caring: for\nevery hour the daughter cared for her parent, the son-in-law increased his\ncaring by about 15 minutes,4 and for each hour the son cared for his\nparents, the daughter-in-law increased her caring on average by about\nhalf-an-hour.5\nThe person\u2019s labour-market status had a strong influence on a child-\nin-law\u2019s hours of caring. Both sons-in-law and daughters-in-law cared for\nsignificantly more hours if they were not employed; in both cases the\naverage hours of care increased by more than seven hours.

It has been shown that many couples shared the care for\ntheir parents, and even that many couples provided all the tasks together.\nSons and daughters provided care for their parents without support of the\nspouse, especially when the care needs were limited. The higher the care\nneeds of the parents, the more often children-in-law joined in and the more\nhours they provided. However, sons-in-laws\u2019 engagement remained lower\nthan that of daughters-in-law. Those daughters-in-law who provided care\non average matched the caring hours of their husbands. This confirms\nHorowitz\u2019s (1985b) observation that sons rely more than daughters on\ntheir spouses for parent care and extends her result to the British case.\nThe child-in-law\u2019s share of total care hours varied little between couples\nwho provided large or small amounts of care; on average, sons-in-law\nprovided 38 per cent of the couple\u2019s caring hours and daughters-in-law\n49 per cent whatever their total care hours. These findings support neither\nof the two patterns suggested in H3a and H3b. Ideally, one needs longi-\ntudinal data to test the hypotheses, as the stable ratio between husband\u2019s\nand wife\u2019s caring can result from a mixture of different patterns. If taken at\nface value, however, the stability of the child-in-law\u2019s share of care-giving\nsuggests a third pattern where couples agree a certain distribution of\ncaring between them to which they adhere even if their caring hours\nincrease.\nArber and Ginn\u2019s critical view of married men\u2019s caring that was referred\nto in the introduction does not reflect the care-giving for their parents\nof the majority of married men as most provided the larger part of the\ncare that the couple provided. A small but important exception were\nthe couples that provided personal care for the husband\u2019s mother. The\nrelatively low number that cared for the husband\u2019s parents suggests that\nmarried men leave a lot of care for their parents to other family members,\npresumably their sisters.\nThe study found an interesting difference between sons-in-laws\u2019 and\ndaughters-in-laws\u2019 hours of caring. The hours of a son-in-law depended\nonly on his wife\u2019s hours and not on the number of different tasks that the\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 387\ncouple provided, whereas the daughter-in-law\u2019s care depended both on\nher husband\u2019s hours and the parent\u2019s care needs. One could interpret this\ndifference in the following way: sons-in-law are motivated by the wives\u2019\ncontributions but not by the parents\u2019 needs whereas daughters-in-law take\nboth aspects into account. This supports Gerstel and Gallagher\u2019s (2001)\nnotion that men are \u2018drawn into caring\u2019 by their wives, and it suggests that\ndaughters-in-law often take a direct responsibility for the care of their\nparents-in-law in contrast to many sons-in-law. The findings about son-in-\nlaws\u2019 care-giving correspond to the description of spouses as secondary\nhelpers by Tennstedt, McKinlay and Sullivan (1989), but this, does not\nnecessarily apply to daughters-in-law. The research from Tennstedt\u2019s\nteam was based on the concept of the \u2018primary care-giver \u2019. If one defines\nthe primary care-giver as the carer who provided most hours of care, it\ncould be that, regarding his parents, neither husband nor wife was a pri-\nmary care-giver. If one of them was a primary carer, it was most likely the\nhusband because in the majority of cases he provided more hours of care\nfor his parents than did his wife. However, because daughters-in-law\nnearly matched their husband\u2019s hours of care, it does not seem appropri-\nate to describe their contribution as secondary help. It is possible that the\ncases of informal caring for husbands\u2019 parents did not emerge strongly in\nthe work of Tennstedt\u2019s team because they did not distinguish between\ncare-giving for the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s parents, so that caring pat-\nterns for her parents might have dominated their results.\nReasons for the division of parent care\nThe study has discussed four potential key factors that influence a couple\u2019s\ndivision of parent care: paid work, care-recipients\u2019 preferences, co-\nresidence with the parent, and gender roles. Past studies have identified\nmen\u2019s employment as a buffer that allows them to limit their caring. This\nstudy supports these findings for sons-in-law and also finds that full-time\nemployment is associated with lower levels of care-giving by daughters-\nin-law, supporting H4a. It is tempting to interpret the result for women as\na sign of changing gender roles where own employment becomes a legit-\nimate excuse for both men and women for not providing care, but this was\nnot entirely true \u2013 more women than men were not in the labour market\nand might have left the labour market in response to care demands (Henz\n2006). However, the study shows that women who combine work and\ncaring provided relatively low levels of care.\nWhen examining the interdependence of children-in-laws\u2019 caring and\ntheir spouses\u2019 hours of paid work, we find that sons-in-law were most likely\nto be involved in care-giving if their wives worked full-time. In terms of\n388 Ursula Henz\nhours, sons-in-law who were involved in caring provided more care if their\nwives were working for pay than otherwise. One can conclude that those\nwomen who combined full-time work and care-giving for their parents\ndid this with their husband\u2019s support. One can also take the findings as\nan indicator that men\u2019s employment alone was not a legitimate excuse if\ntheir wives were working full-time. Whereas these results support H4b,\ndaughters-in-law\u2019s involvement did not vary with their husband\u2019s employ-\nment. The difference between the caring of sons-in-law and daughters-\nin-law can be interpreted as further evidence for different approaches to\ncaring: whereas sons-in-laws\u2019 caring depended on their wives\u2019 behaviour,\ndaughters-in-law seemed to take more direct responsibility for the care of\ntheir parents-in-law.\nThe patterns associated with women\u2019s part-time work are ambiguous\nand can best be understood as resulting from two types of part-time\nworking women: those who would have liked to work full-time but could\nnot do so because of time restrictions, and those who enjoyed more leisure\ntime. The first group of part-time working women could be those who\nobtained the same support with caring from their spouses as full-time\nworking women and who made similarly low contributions to the care of\ntheir parents-in-law as full-time working women; the second group could\nbe those women who had less support from their spouses with the care of\ntheir parents.\nAnother factor that strongly affected the involvement of children-in-law\nin parent care was the parent\u2019s co-residence, which was associated with a\nhigher level of caring, supporting H5. Only for women\u2019s fathers was the\neffect not statistically significant. This resulted not only from the few cases\nfor there is some indication that the wives\u2019 co-resident fathers were in\nbetter health than other co-resident parents.6 It might be that these men\nlived with the couple not because of their frailty but because they were not\nable to run their own home after their wives\u2019 death. This argument is\nsupported by findings from Dale, Evandrou and Arber (1987) that elderly\nwidowed men were more likely to live with their married children than\nelderly widowed women.\nIn addition, the preferences of the care-recipient might have influenced\nthe couples\u2019 division of care. Because the data do not include any direct\nmeasures of preferences, the hypotheses could only be tested indirectly.\nDespite the gendered pattern of care-giving one cannot say that couples\u2019\ncaring predominantly followed gender lines because there was a strong\nconsanguinal pattern in parent care, with the child being more frequently\ninvolved and providing the same or longer hours of care than the child-in-\nlaw. An exception to the consanguinal pattern was personal care and, to a\nlesser extent, physical care. For these tasks, caring for the wife\u2019s parents\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 389\nfollowed a consanguinal pattern whereas caring for the husband\u2019s parents\ndisplayed a same-sex pattern. From this one can derive a hierarchy of\nparent carers, with daughters ranking first followed by same-sex patterns\ninvolving sons and daughters-in-law, thus refuting both H2a and H2b. For\nall other tasks, the parents of both sexes were treated similarly.\nFinally, we find different patterns of involvement in parent care by men\nand women even after controlling for a number of factors, emphasising\nhow informal caring varies with social norms and cultural contexts.\nGender roles are only one example of the normative and cultural framing\nof care-giving (Aboderin 2004) ; further differences might be found be-\ntween different ethnic groups (Peek, Coward and Peek 2000). Indeed, the\n52 couples in the sample with at least one spouse from an ethnic minority\ndisplayed a different overall pattern of care and care division: they pro-\nvided care to fathers less often, the husband cared less often by himself for\nhis parents ; and the wife cared more often by herself for her parents. The\ndifferences could result partly from structural differences and partly from\ndifferent family and gender norms.\nRegarding the question of whether sons-in-law or daughters-in-law\nprovided more care, the study shows that fewer daughters-in-law cared for\ntheir parents-in-law, but those who cared provided more hours of care\nthan did sons-in-law. The 630 care-giving wives in the sample provided a\ntotal of 7,289 hours of care for their parents-in-law compared to 6,434\nhours provided by the 702 caring sons-in-law. Therefore, daughters-in-law\nprovided more care, but the difference was not large.\nLimitations and outlook\nThe weaknesses of the study include the lack of information about parents\u2019\noverall care needs and about other sources of care for the parent including\nparents\u2019 spouses, other adult children or relatives, and formal care pro-\nviders. There is also no information about the quality of the relationship\nbetween care-receivers and their children-in-law, which Matthews (1998)\nhas identified as a crucial factor for children-in-laws\u2019 caring. In addition,\nthe study ignores other ways in which a couple can co-operate to accom-\nmodate caring for a parent, for example by relieving the carer from other\nhousehold duties. The analysis relies on self-reported caring activities.\nAlthough this has clear advantages compared to indirect reporting, it\nmight be open to different interpretations by the respondents, in a similar\nway to discrepancies about self-reported housework that have been ob-\nserved (Kamo 2000; Lee and Waite 2005; Marini and Shelton 1993).\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the analysis was based on cross-\nsectional data. The positive effects of the wife\u2019s full-time employment on\n390 Ursula Henz\nher husband\u2019s involvement in caring for her parents means that those\nwomen who managed to combine full-time employment with care-giving\nwere more likely to have the support of their husbands. Other full-time\nworking women who did not obtain this support might have lowered their\nworking hours or left the labour market (Henz 2004). The conflict between\npaid work and caring is likely to intensify in the future. Women\u2019s econ-\nomic activity rate is expected to rise further (Madouros 2006), which is\ncrucial to safeguard women\u2019s pensions in the future (Price 2006). Despite\nrising female labour-market participation rates, current levels of informal\ncare by married couples could be sustained if men increased their care-\ngiving to the same extent as women might reduce it, but paid work also\nlimits men\u2019s involvement in informal care. Both men and women should\nprofit from policy measures to support working carers (Arksey 2002;\nFredriksen-Goldsen and Scharlach 2001; Phillips 2002), but although such\npolicies might make huge differences to care-giver stress, their effects on\nthe overall care-giving capacity of paid workers might be small (Henz\n2006). If flexible working conditions are insufficient, the conflict between\ninformal-care and paid-work might lead to a change in the culture of care-\ngiving, with changes in perceptions of filial responsibility, and employed\ncarers limiting their amount of hands-on caring.\nNot just paid work but also cultural and demographic changes in fam-\nilies will affect the future care-giving of married children and their spouses.\nAccording to recent population projections, fewer people will be legally\nmarried, but in mid-age most of the reduction will be compensated by\nincreased cohabitation (Office for National Statistics 2005). This will lower\nthe care provided by children\u2019s spouses because the study has revealed\na lower level of involvement of cohabiting spouses in the care of their\nparents-in-law. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of\ndivorce for intergenerational relationships both as it affects elderly parents\n(Glaser et al. 2006; Kalmijn 2007) and affects children (Brody et al. 1995;\nDooghe 1992; Grundy 1995). There is a risk that divorce and remarriage\nwill lead to less caring by children-in-law, but it is up to future research to\ntest this presumption. Finally, if current trends in living arrangements\ncontinue, fewer married couples will be living with a parent (Grundy\n2000), which will entail a drop in the strong involvement of children-in-law\nin care-giving under such circumstances. A decline in co-resident intensive\ncare by children for their parents has already been observed (Pickard\n2002).\nProjections of future care needs predict a strong increase in the demand\nfor informal care provided by children over the next 20 years (Pickard et al.\n2007). Over this period, the share of older people with surviving children\nis expected to increase (Murphy and Grundy 2003). The anticipated\nCare for parents and parents-in-law 391\ntrends \u2013 women\u2019s increasing labour-force participation, less co-residence\nof parents with married children, increasing non-marital cohabitation,\nand possibly also higher levels of divorce and re-partnering \u2013 will weaken\ninformal caring by children-in-law. For lack of other caring resources it\nseems likely that in the future caring for parents will increasingly rely on a\nsuccessful co-operation of informal and formal care services.\nAcknowledgements\nThe General Household Surveys were carried out by the Social Survey Division\nof the Office for National Statistics, formerly the Office of Population Censuses\nand Surveys.

This resulted in only small\nchanges, most notably a slight increase of between one and three percentage points in\nthe proportion of couples who shared all tasks or all tasks but one.\n4 The precise effect is that for every 10 hours of his wife\u2019s care the husband increased his\ncare hours by 2.7 hours (162 minutes). This results in an effect of about a quarter of an\nhour per hour cared by the daughter.\n5 The precise effect is that for every 10 hours of care by the husband, the wife cared for\nabout five hours.\n6 The healthiest quarter of the husbands\u2019 co-resident mothers-in-law received on av-\nerage each about 25 hours of care per week from the couple whereas the healthiest\nquarter of the husbands\u2019 co-resident fathers-in-law received on average each only\nabout 10 hours of care from the couple. The corresponding hours for the healthiest\nquarters of the husband\u2019s co-resident parents are 30 hours of care received by fathers\nand 22.5 hours of care received by mothers.\nReferences\nAboderin, I. 2004.
