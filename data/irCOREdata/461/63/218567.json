The well-known \u201cgravity\u2019\u2019 \nrelationship between trade flows and distance, \nfor example, is driven almost exclusively by the \nextensive margin: while the number of firms \nand the number of traded products decline sig-\nnificantly with  distance, the intensive margin \nof average import or export value per firm-\nproduct, if anything, increases.3\nWe use detailed US trade statistics to provide \na broad overview of how the margins of trade \ncontribute to differences in imports and exports \nacross trading partners, types of trade (i.e., arm\u2019s-\nlength versus related-party), and both short and \nlong time horizons. We find that variation in \nimports and exports across trading partners is \nprimarily due to extensive margins, while varia-\ntion in trade across one-year intervals is domi-\nnated by the intensive margin. These seemingly \ndivergent results can be reconciled by consid-\nering the small size of new entrants relative \nto incumbents, and their subsequent relatively \nstrong growth conditional on survival. Across \nfive- and ten-year time horizons, we find that the \nrelative contribution of the extensive margins \nrises. Comparing arm\u2019s-length and related-party \ntrade, we find the intensive margin to be rela-\ntively more influential for related-party trade in \nboth the time series and the cross section.\nWe also investigate the behavior of US exports \nand imports around the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis. While there are substantial changes in \nextensive margins around the crisis, the intensive \nmargin accounts for the majority of the export \ndeclines and import increases. We find that \nrelated-party trade with Asia reacts quite differ-\nently to the crisis: both related-party exports and \nimports rise relative to arm\u2019s-length flows, due to \nstrong growth in the intensive margin. These out-\ncomes suggest multinational firms may respond \n3 See Bernard et al.

Data\nWe use the US Linked\/Longitudinal Firm \nTrade Transaction Database (LFTTD), which \nlinks individual US trade transactions to US \nfirms.4 For each export and import transac-\ntion, we observe the US firm engaging in the \ntransaction, the ten-digit Harmonized System (HS) classification of the product shipped, the (nominal) value shipped, the shipment date, the \ndestination or source country, and whether the \ntransaction takes place at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d (AL) or \nbetween \u201crelated parties\u201d (RP).5 Export (import) \npartners are \u201crelated\u201d if either party owns, \ndirectly or indirectly, 10 percent (6 percent) or \nmore of the other party.\nAs it is convenient for our analysis of the \nAsian crisis in Section III, which began in July \n1997, we define year t throughout the paper as \nencompassing July through December of calen-\ndar year t  and January through June of calendar \nyear t + 1.\nII. Cross-Sectional Variation in US Trade\nLarge cross-sectional variation in imports \nand exports across partner countries is a strik-\ning feature of international trade. In 2003, for \nexample, US exports to its largest trading partner \nwere nearly 1,700 times as large as its exports to \nthe trading partner at the twenty-fifth percen-\ntile. This section investigates the contribution of \nintensive and extensive margins to these cross-\nsectional differences.\nAggregate US trade with partner country c (xc) \ncan be decomposed into the unique number of \nfirms that trade with the country (  fc), the unique \nnumber of products traded with the country ( pc), \nand the average value of trade per firm-product, \n4 We match an average of 76 and 82 percent of the value \nof export and import transactions to firm identifiers, respec-\ntively, across the 1993 to 2003 horizon spanned by the data. \nThe current version of the dataset is missing import data for \nJuly 1993 and May 1995 and export data for June 1995. See \nBernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) for more details.\n5 HS categories are retired and created over the course \nof our sample. To eliminate spurious product adding and \ndropping due to these changes, we use a time-consistent \nset of HS codes developed by Justin R. Pierce and Schott \n(2009).\nxc\/( fc  pc). We include an additional term in our \ndecomposition to account for the \u201cdensity\u2019\u2019 \nof trade, i.e., the fraction of all possible firm-\nproduct combinations for country c for which \ntrade is positive. Total trade to country c is then \nthe product of the number of trading firms, the \nnumber of traded products, the density of trade (dc), and the average value of trade ( _ x c), where \ndc = oc\/( fc  pc), oc is the number of firm-product \nobservations for which trade with country c \nis above zero, and  \n_ x c = xc\/oc is the intensive \nmargin. Density ranges from min { 1\/ fc, 1\/pc} to \nunity as the number of observations approaches \nthe product of fc and pc. Since firms generally \nare active in only a small subset of the overall \nnumber of products traded, density is typically \nnegatively correlated with the numbers of trad-\ning firms and traded products.6\nThe identity xc = fc  pc dc  _ x c provides the basis \nfor a regression decomposition of US trade \nacross countries for a particular year. Separately \nfor both exports and imports, we regress the \nlogarithm of each margin of trade on the loga-\nrithm of total trade. Given that OLS is a linear \nestimator and its residuals have an expected \nvalue of zero, the coefficients for each set of \nregressions sum to unity, with each coefficient \nrepresenting the share of the overall variation in \ntrade explained by each margin.7 In the extreme, \nif firms were each to export a different single \nproduct, and if each firm were to export a con-\nstant value of that product across countries, the \ncoefficients on the extensive margins of firms \nand products would equal unity, the coefficient \non density would equal minus unity, and the \ncoefficient on the intensive margin would equal \nzero.\n6 As the number of firms and products grows across \ncountries, the number of possible firm-product observa-\ntions (  fc  pc) expands multiplicatively. If firms are active in a \nrelatively constant subset of products across countries, the \nactual number of firm-product observations with positive \ntrade will expand less than proportionately, causing den-\nsity to decline. In that case, countries with larger fc and pc \nwill have less dense trade, implying a negative correlation \nbetween density and the number of trading firms and traded \nproducts.\n7 The regression decomposition can be transformed to \nextract additional information about the margins of trade. \nFor example, the sum of the coefficients for density and the \nnumber of products yields the percentage contribution of \nthe number of products per firm that are traded in positive \namounts.\nVOL. 99 NO. 2 489ThE MARGINS Of US TRADE\nTable 1 reports the results of our regression \ndecomposition for 2003. Each cell corresponds \nto a separate regression, and the coefficients in \neach column sum to unity. Results for exports \nare reported in the first three columns. As indi-\ncated in the last row of the first column, the \nintensive margin explains an average of 22.6 \npercent of the variation in overall US exports \nacross destinations. Variation in the number \nof firms exporting (row 1) and the number of \nproducts exported (row 2), on the other hand, \naccount for 69.4 and 58.8 percent of the varia-\ntion, respectively. As discussed above, there is \na negative coefficient on density of \u22120.508 (row \n3) reflecting the fact that density is negatively \ncorrelated with the number of traded products, \nthe number of trading firms and the aggregate \nvalue of US trade. Nonetheless, the sum of the \nthree extensive margin terms still accounts for \nthe vast majority (77.4 percent) of the variation \nin overall exports.\nThe second and third columns of Table 1 \nreport results for AL and RP trade separately, \ni.e., each column reports the contribution of each \nmargin to variation in each type of exports. As \nshown in the table, the intensive margin is rela-\ntively more important for RP exports than AL \nexports (31.1 versus 21.1 percent). One potential \nexplanation for this finding relates to the aver-\nage US multinational being active in a wider \nrange of locations than the average AL firm. As \na result, the intensive margins may be relatively \nmore influential.\nThe second panel of Table 1 reports analo-\ngous results for US imports. The firms in these \ndecompositions refer to enterprises located in \nthe United States that import goods from abroad, \nand not foreign firms located abroad that export \nto the United States. Therefore, in principle, \nresults for US importers could be quite differ-\nent from those for US exporters. Nevertheless, \nwe find a strikingly similar pattern of results as \nfor US exports. The contribution of the inten-\nsive margin is somewhat higher for imports, \nperhaps reflecting the greater concentration of \ntrade across importers than across exporters (Bernard, Jensen, and Schott 2009). As with \nexports, however, we find that the intensive mar-\ngin is relatively more important for RP imports \nthan for AL imports.\nIII. Time-Series Variation in US Trade\nThe change in aggregate US trade between \nperiods can be decomposed into two exten-\nsive margins and one intensive margin. The \ntwo extensive margins are firm entry and exit \nand continuing firms\u2019 adding and dropping of \n country-products.8 The intensive margin is \ncontinuing firm-country-products\u2019 growth and \ndecline. We note that entry and exit are defined \nwith respect to trade participation and not \ndomestic production.\n8 The extensive margin of product-country adding can \nbe further decomposed into three, non\u2013mutually exclusive \nactivities: adding an entirely new product or country; add-\ning a new country for an existing product; and adding a new \nproduct for an existing country. Activities associated with \nproduct-country dropping are analogous.\nTable 1\u2014Cross-Sectional Decompositions, 2003\nExports Imports\nMargin Full sample RP AL Full sample RP AL\nFirms 0.694 0.591 0.711 0.580 0.475 0.619\n(0.016) (0.017) (0.017) (0.016) (0.015) (0.017)\nProducts 0.588 0.598 0.605 0.543 0.511 0.577\n(0.015) (0.017) (0.016) (0.016) (0.016) (0.018)\nDensity \u22120.508 \u22120.500 \u22120.527 \u22120.441 \u22120.398 \u22120.476\n(0.015) (0.016) (0.015) (0.013) (0.013) (0.015)\nIntensive 0.226 0.311 0.211 0.318 0.412 0.279\n(0.017) (0.018) (0.017) (0.018) (0.018) (0.020)\nCountries 231 207 231 227 214 224\nNotes: Table reports OLS decompositions of US exports and imports across trading partners along extensive and intensive \nmargins. Each cell reports the mean contribution and standard error from a different regression. Data are for 2003. First col-\numn is for the full sample; second and third columns are restricted to related-party and arm\u2019s-length trade, respectively.\nMAY 2009490 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS\nTable 2 uses these categories to decompose \nshort- and long-run nominal export growth in \nbillions of US dollars. The first eight columns \nreport annual changes from 1995 to 2003, while \nthe final column reports the ten-year change for \nthe full sample, 1993 to 2003. The first nine \nrows summarize the gross and net contributions \nof each margin in the order discussed above. \nThe overall growth of exports\u2014which is equal \nto the sums of each margin\u2019s net contribution\u2014\nis reported in row 10. Finally, rows 12 through \n14 report each margin\u2019s net contribution as a \npercent of the overall change in exports.\nShort-run changes in US exports are largely \naccounted for by the intensive margin. Over \nthe annual changes displayed in the table, the \nintensive margin accounted for an average 105 \npercent of the growth in exports, ranging from \na low of 46 percent for 1995 to 1996 to a high of \n294 percent for 2001 to 2002.\nOne reason for the relatively small contribu-\ntion of extensive margins over short time inter-\nvals is that entering and exiting exporters, as \nwell as recently added and about-to-be-dropped \nproduct-countries, are on average relatively \nsmall compared to continuing exporters and \n product-countries. Conversely, conditional on \nsurvival, entering exporters and recently added \nproduct-countries grow more rapidly than \nincumbent exporters and product-countries (Eaton et al. 2008). This interpretation is con-\nsistent with the results of the long-difference \ndecomposition in the last column of the table. \nThere, we find that the contribution of the inten-\nsive margin over the entire 1993 to 2003 sample \nperiod is 35 percent. As discussed in the longer \nversion of this paper (available on the AER Web \nsite), the contribution of the intensive margin \nover both short and long time-intervals is more \npronounced for related-party trade than for \narm\u2019s-length trade.\nAnother feature of the results is that the gross \ncontributions of each margin of trade are sub-\nstantially larger than their net contributions. \nThis finding is consistent with the self-selection \nemphasized by heterogeneous-firm trade mod-\nels. In those models, stochastic shocks to pro-\nductivity or demand that are positive for some \nfirms and negative for others imply that some \nfirms will enter export markets or expand even \nas others withdraw or contract.

Finally, as we find sub-\nstantial net entry and product adding by firms \nwithin existing product-country trading pairs, \nour findings suggest that measures of the wel-\nfare effects of increasing product variety based \non the number of product-country trading pairs \nlikely understate the true level of gains.\nAs discussed in the longer version of this \npaper, a time-series decomposition of imports \nyields results comparable to those for exports. \nOne reason for this similarity could be the per-\nvasiveness of firms that both export and import. \nFor these globally engaged firms, a common \nchange in the production process can affect the \nextensive margins of both exports and imports.\nIV. The Asian Crisis\nWe examine how the margins of US trade \nrespond to a particular macroeconomic shock, \nusing the 1997 Asian financial crisis as an event \nstudy. We adopt a \u201cdifference-in-differences\u201d \nspecification comparing the treatment group \nof crisis countries to a \u201ccontrol\u201d group of all \nother countries before and after July 1997. For \nthe purposes of this section, we define the cri-\nsis countries as Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, and Thailand.9 We refer to the crisis \ncountries as \u201cAsia\u201d and to the remaining, control-\ngroup countries as \u201crest-of-world\u201d or \u201cROW.\u201d\nThe first two scatterplots in Figure 1 display \nthe evolution of total, RP, and AL exports to \nAsia and ROW around the crisis years. Each \nseries is normalized to 100 in 1996. Overall \nUS exports to Asia declined 21 percent \nbetween 1996 and 1998, while exports to ROW \n9 Though these countries do differ from one another in \nsome respects, they exhibit broadly similar responses to the \ncrisis.\nincreased 3  percent. Within Asia, the decline \nin AL exports is substantially greater than the \ndrop in RP exports, 26 versus 4 percent. For \nexports to ROW, the experience of AL and RP \ntrade is similar.\nSubsequent scatterplots in the first two \ncolumns of Figure 1 separate the aggregate \nresponse in US exports into extensive and inten-\nsive margins using the cross-sectional decompo-\nsition discussed above. We display the results for \nthree margins, combining the density and prod-\nuct margins into average products per exporting \nfirm ( pc dc = oc\/fc) to conserve space. As indi-\ncated in the second and final rows of the figure, \nthe number of firms exporting to Asia, as well \nas their intensive margin, decline substantially \nmore than the respective margins for ROW (\u221216 versus \u22128 percent and \u22122 versus + 9 per-\ncent, respectively). In terms of value, however, \nthe intensive margin is much more influential, \naccounting for 66 and 41 percent of the decline \nin exports to Asia in 1997 and 1998, respec-\ntively. This dominance of the intensive margin \nin value terms\u2014documented further in the lon-\nger version of this paper\u2014is consistent with the \ntime-series decompositions discussed above.\nWithin Asia, the number of exporting firms \ndeclines more sharply for AL than RP trade, \u221216 \npercent versus \u22127 percent from 1996 to 1998. \nA comparison of the intensive margins is even \nstarker, \u22128 versus + 9 percent for AL and RP, \nrespectively. The shallower decline in the num-\nber of firms exporting to related parties, as well \nas this increase in the intensive margin, explains \nthe less severe impact of the Asian crisis on \noverall RP exports. By comparison, the average \nexport products per firm, displayed in the penul-\ntimate row of the figure, changes relatively little \nbetween 1996 and 1998 for either Asia or ROW.\nThe increase in US imports from Asia from \n1996 to 1998, reported in the third column of \nFigure 1, roughly mirrors the decline in exports \nin the first column. Import growth is slightly \nstronger for Asia than ROW (19 versus 17 per-\ncent), and, within Asia, is stronger for RP than \nAL trade (28 versus 11 percent). Here, too, AL \nand RP trade differ most in terms of the reac-\ntion of their intensive margins (+ 26 versus \u22121 percent). Indeed, the similar intensive-mar-\ngin reactions of RP exports and imports sug-\ngest that multinationals may have reallocated \nglobal  production or adjusted internal pricing in \nresponse to the crisis.\nMAY 2009492 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS\nV. Conclusions\nThe distinction between firms\u2019 extensive \nand intensive margins highlighted in recent \n theoretical research in international trade is cen-\ntral to our understanding of variation in trade \nacross countries, over time, and in response to \nmacroeconomic shocks.
