Those problems have been illus-\ntrated by several government reports, including Simon\n(1944) and more recently the Latham (1994) and\nEgan (1998) reports. The findings are familiar practice\nto the majority of the industry, which is still striving\ntowards improvements in a number of areas, but ap-\nparently with little success. There are three main areas\nfor consideration:\n1. development of a solution: including consultation\nwith the client and development of product specifi-\ncations and design;\n2. implementation of the solution: the construction or\nrefurbishment of the facility that will satisfy the\nclient needs and those of the project participants;\nand\n3. the project process: the roadmap or framework that\nis used for undertaking the project activities and\nthat delivers value to the supply chain parties.\nIt is, however, almost impossible to consider any of\nthe aforementioned areas in isolation as they are all\ninterdependent and suboptimization does not guaran-\ntee project success.\nThe Latham (1994) report reaffirmed the conclu-\nsions of all previous studies on the subject. The report\nfocused on the fragmented nature of the industry as a\nmajor contributing factor to the poor communication\nbetween all parties working on a construction project.\nThe main outcome and recommendation of the\nLatham report was its call for significant cost savings\nby the utilization and formulation of effective con-\nstruction processes, which will in turn lead to in-\ncreased performance. The recommendations of this\nreport were reaffirmed in a recent report by Egan\n(1998), which reported to the deputy Prime Minister\nJohn Prescott on the scope for improving the quality\nand efficiency of UK construction. This report iden-\ntified the following five key drivers of change that need\nto set the agenda for the construction industry at large:\n1. committed leadership;\n2. focus on the customer;\n3. integrated processes and teams;\n4. quality-driven agenda; and\n5. commitment to people.\nWithin the focus for integrated processes and teams,\nfour key elements were identified: product develop-\nment; project implementation; partnering the supply\nchain; and production of components. Furthermore,\nthe Egan (1998) report called for annual reductions of\n10% in construction cost and time and an annual\nreduction of 20% in project defects. This total perfor-\nmance improvement of 30% requires significant im-\nprovements in the way that the construction process is\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd\n141\n142 Kagioglou M. et al.\nenacted. It will require a significant reengineering of\nthe construction process and the subprocesses in-\nvolved in undertaking construction works.\nLEARNI NG FROM MANUFACTURING\nThe findings and recommendations of Latham and\nEgan relate to the state of the construction industry\nat the present time and offer some clues as to how\nsome of the problems might be overcome by transfer-\nring established practices from the manufacturing in-\ndustry. Indeed, this view has been expressed by a\nnumber of researchers and practitioners (Cooper et al.\n1998; Kagioglou et al. 1998a; Koskela 1992). How-\never, the authors believe that the transfer of knowl-\nedge and practices from manufacturing into the\nconstruction industry should be treated with caution\nfor a number of reasons. First, the level of maturity of\nboth processes and practices is quite different, with\nmanufacturing having the \u2018lead\u2019. Second, the struc-\nture of the industries and of the organization of pro-\nject personnel can be different, in that construction\nrelies heavily on Temporary Multi-organizations\n(TMOs) whereas manufacturing normally operates\nwithin long-term partnership arrangements. Finally,\ncomparison between the processes and the practices\nof both industries must be made by considering the\nlevels in which they exist, i.e. strategic, managerial\nand operational. Therefore, clarification of process\nlevels can have an important influence on the man-\nagement of those processes.\nThere are two main areas of manufacturing that\nconstruction can benefit from (Kagioglou et al.\n1998b): the project process or New Product Develop-\nment (NPD), as it is known; and the operational:pro-\nduction processes. The first relates very closely, both\nin terms of nature and content, to the design and\nconstruction process. As such, it considers the devel-\nopment of a solution (usually a tangible product)\nfrom a need identified in the market place or inter-\nnally within an organization to the implementation of\nthat solution and the eventual withdrawal of the\nproduct. This is achieved by organizing the activities\nthat need to take place in a number of phases, which\nare made distinct by the determination of review\npoints between the phases. This is very similar to the\nenactment of a construction project, the difference\nbeing that the distinction between the phases is usu-\nally determined by the entry of the different parties:\nfunctions, i.e. architects, contractors etc., to the\nprocess. The second area is related to the way in\nwhich the production of a product, including material\nflow, process design and resources planning, is under-\ntaken. Indeed, a number of very effective philosophies\nand practices such as Just in Time (JIT), lean pro-\nduction and others have a legacy of optimized pro-\nduction in the manufacturing sector. JIT aims to\nimprove production by utilizing the internal and ex-\nternal supply chains in terms of people and material\nflow. The similarities of JIT, for example, in the con-\nstruction sector can be illustrated by listing a number\nof the benefits, amongst many, that are offered by its\nsuccessful implementation:\n\u0093 reduced time-scales by optimizing material flow;\n\u0093 reduced waste of both materials and processing\ntime by optimizing the manufacturing processes;\nand\n\u0093 supply chain integration by utilizing effective\npartnerships.\nThe first two benefits can be realized in the con-\nstruction industry (see, for example, Koskela 1992)\nperhaps more readily than the third one, which re-\nquires a significant reorganization and mind-shift of\nthe litigation-driven industry.\nThis paper concentrates on the lessons that can be\nlearned from the NPD:project process of manufactur-\ning, and reference to it is made throughout the de-\nscription of the Generic Design and Construction\nProcess Protocol (GDCPP).\nTHE GENERIC DES IGN AND\nCONSTRUCTION PROCESS (GDCPP)\nPROTOCOL\nThis section presents a description of the research\nmethods and the main findings of an Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded\nproject under the Innovative Manufacturing Initiative\n(IMI) \u2018Construction as a Manufacturing Process\u2019 ini-\ntiative. The project brought together a number of\ncompanies, representing the construction supply\nchain, and the University of Salford\u2019s research exper-\ntise to produce the \u2018Generic Design and Construction\nProcess Protocol\u2019.\nThe main aims of the project were to:\n\u0093 develop an improved design and construction Pro-\ncess Protocol by analysing the current practices in\nthe construction industry and drawing comparisons\nwith similar practices in the manufacturing indus-\ntry; and\n\u0093 identify the Information Technology (IT) require-\nments needed to support the Process Protocol and\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n143The Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol in construction\ndevelop demonstrator models (the results of the IT\ninvestigation are presented elsewhere).\nThis project involved contractors, clients, IT spe-\ncialists and the supply chain coming together\nwith academia through a government-stimulated re-\nsearch programme to develop an improved design\nand construction process. This also enabled the\nproduction of a solution that is devised, owned and\nsatisfactory to all parties. The GDCPP project and\nthis paper relate most appropriately to the research\nprogramme under which it is funded (\u2018Construc-\ntion as a Manufacturing Process\u2019), and the nature of\nLatham\u2019s and Egan\u2019s philosophical approaches to\nachieving the resolution of client dissatisfaction, con-\nstruction industry dissatisfaction and supply chain\nproblems.\nConcept of Process Protocol\nThe concept of the Process Protocol was based on\na number of issues and deficiencies of current prac-\ntices in the construction industry. This enabled the\nidentification of areas for improvement by examining\nand comparing best practice in manufacturing project\nprocesses. To this end, a need was identified for\na model that is capable of representing the diverse\ninterests of all the parties involved in the construction\nprocess or that is able to provide a com-\nplete overview. In addition, the design and construc-\ntion operations need to form part of a common pro-\ncess (model) best controlled by an integrated system.\nThis has been achieved successfully in manufacturing\nand other industries through process modelling\nand the reengineering of those processes (Rosenau\n1996). In order for construction to utilize such\na model:process approach, there is a need for a co-\nherent and explicit set of process-related principles,\na new process paradigm, which can be managed and\nreviewed across the breadth and depth of the industry\nand which focuses on changing and systematizing\nthe strategic management of the potentially com-\nmon management processes in construction whilst\naccommodating the fragmentary production idiosyn-\ncrasies. In addition, it is appreciated that there will\nbe no best way for all circumstances; however, a\ngeneric and adaptable set of principles will allow the\nconsistent application of principles in a repeatable\nform. Finally, a philosophy of early entry into the\nprocess of the key functions needs to be incorporated,\nwith the emphasis of the effort on design and plan-\nning to minimize both error and reworking during\nconstruction.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThe research team endeavoured to use a methodology\nthat was sympathetic to the issues being investigated:\nin effect to \u2018\u2026 suit the method to the problem, and not\nthe problem to the method\u2019 (Linstone 1978). Further-\nmore, it was appreciated that different types of issues\nwould be encountered during the development of the\nProcess Protocol, and that these often disparate issues\nwould be best served by a variety of research methods.\nTo provide the necessary contingency-based, but inte-\ngrated, research methodology to accommodate these\ndiffering demands in a coherent and consistent way, an\noverall research model was developed, as shown in Fig.\n1.\nThe outer ring of Fig. 1 represents the unifying\nresearch philosophy, which guides and energizes the\ninner research approaches and research techniques.\nResearch approaches consist of the dominant theory\ngeneration and testing methods. Research techniques\ncomprise data collection tools.\nThe nesting of the model\u2019s elements generated a\nframework, which provided the research team with an\ninteractive portfolio of approaches and techniques that\nbenefited from meta-level direction and cohesion.\nEach of the model\u2019s elements will be briefly discussed.\nActor-based research philosophy\nThe overarching research philosophy used in the GD-\nCPP project was the preunderstanding\u2013understanding\nhermeneutic spiral (Odman 1985), grounded in actor\nFigure 1 Overall GDCPP research model.\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n144 Kagioglou M. et al.\nFigure 2 Hermeneutic learning spiral.\nAction research\nThe methodology was infused with an action research:\nlearning dimension, in as much as the workshops not\nonly facilitated the generation of new knowledge or\nunderstanding but also provided structured frameworks\nfor carrying out organizational change within the\nboundaries of the industrial partner research team\nmembers.\nThe action research strand was firmly anchored to\nthe following interactive assumptions:\n\u0093 the optimal way of learning about the design and\nconstruction process was through attempting to ini-\ntiate a generic Process Protocol-based change\nwithin it;\n\u0093 the industrial partners who would be affected by, or\ninstrumental in, these changes should as far as\npossible be involved in the workshops; and\n\u0093 workshop participation would encourage industrial\npartner members to generatively learn as they dis-\ncovered how to make sense of the Process Protocol\nin terms of their own language and organizational\nsetting.\nThe action research model shown in Fig. 3 was\nimplicit in the design and implementation of the work-\nshop stages. The model channels the action research\neffort through an optimal flow of stages\u2014starting with\nbringing the workshop team together in the centre and\nthen moving to agreeing the scope for action at the\ntop.\nresearch philosophy (see, for example, Berger & Luck-\nmann 1966; Sandywell 1975). The spiral, shown in\nFig. 2, depicts research as an iterative process whereby\nthe industrial partners\u2019 and the University of Salford\nresearch team\u2019s a priori knowledge, insights and experi-\nence form the preunderstanding, or common language,\nto inform the subsequent stage of understanding, which\nfurthers the development of the Process Protocol.\nThis understanding, in turn, is the basis for the\npreunderstanding of the next stage of development,\nand so on.\nThe main conduit for the translation and elevation\nof preunderstanding into understanding were work-\nshops, although crucial preunderstanding:understand-\ning was transferred and developed through an ongoing\ndialogue both prior to and between the workshops.\nThe workshops and intervening dialogue improved\nboth individual and collective learning throughout the\nproject team.\nResearch approaches\nCase studies\nA traditional case study approach was used, with Uni-\nversity of Salford researchers entering industrial part-\nners\u2019 organizations openly in the role of investigators,\nwith the express purpose of learning more about their\nactivities with respect to the design and construction\nprocesses being practised. Three case studies were\nundertaken\u2014one in a manufacturing organization and\ntwo projects undertaken by Alfred McAlpine\u2019s Special\nProjects Division.

The questionnaires collected predominantly\nqualitative data from the partners in the project.\nThe questionnaire surveys aimed to generate factual\nand attitudinal information and understanding (see, for\nexample, Ackroyd & Hughes 1983). The factual ele-\nments of the questionnaires sought to gain information\nfrom individuals within the industrial partners firms\nconcerning the material aspects of design and con-\nstruction processes: for example, project duration\ntime. The attitudinal aspects of the questionnaires\naimed to secure data on what individuals felt about a\ngiven issue: in this case, for example, what they felt\nabout the effectiveness of the prevailing performance\nreview process.\nWorkshops\nThe workshops carried out during the project were\ncentral to fruitful preunderstanding and understanding\nprogression. Each workshop had a specific task to\ninvestigate, which was set out and managed by a\nUniversity of Salford co-ordinator. The workshop\nconfiguration, in effect, created a boundary-spanning\nteam, which could tackle complex process issues by\nbringing together and harnessing a diverse range of\nexpertise in a structured way.\nThe Workshops were designed and implemented to:\n\u0093 Provide feedback such that the co-ordinator facilitated\nlearning by providing workshop members with feed-\nback about the consequences of issues being raised\nand decisions being taken.\n\u0093 Stimulate questioning: the co-ordinator facilitated\nlearning by asking questions that stimulated partici-\npants to think in new ways. For example, issues\nwere often reframed from a manufacturing perspec-\ntive and returned to the forum as a question.\n\u0093 Permit modelling and validation: the co-ordinator en-\ncouraged learning and understanding through pro-\ncess models that participants could either adopt,\nmodify or reject. For example, the Process Protocol\nmap itself underwent numerous changes as a direct\nresult of workshop debate.\n\u0093 Provide support: the co-ordinator facilitated learning\nby providing a psychologically supportive environ-\nment, thereby creating a climate where novel issues\nand questions could be raised. For example, ideas\nwere generated from a variety of construction per-\nspectives as well as an injection of diverse theoreti-\ncal views.\n\u0093 Structuring: the co-ordinator facilitated learning by\nstructuring the flow of work. For example, in one\nworkshop, a hypothetical construction case was de-\nveloped to explore process issues.\nInterviews\nInterviews were used throughout the research process.\nIn total, there were 30 interviews helping the develop-\nment of the Process Protocol and 30 interviews during\nthe case study investigations. They were generally\nsemi-structured in nature to allow it to have an overall\npurpose but be sufficiently flexible to explore issues as\nthey arose during the discussion. The contents of\ninterviews were validated by the sending of case study\nreports for comment to the relevant industrial\npartners.\nApproaches to modelling the process\nGiven the apparent lack of commonality in the con-\ntemporary understanding of the design and construc-\ntion process, an attempt was made to produce a model\nof the process that could be debated and subsequently\nrefined towards a generic representation.\nThe initial model was developed based on existing\ndescriptions of the design and construction process\n(inter alia Walker 1989; Hughes 1991), some case\nstudy data and reviews of other published models (inter\nalia RIBA 1980; Sanvido 1990; BAA Plc. 1995)\nThe Integration Definition language 0 for Function\nModelling (IDEF-0) process modelling technique was\nadopted, initially, as the most appropriate means of\nrepresenting this process. It is this technique that has\nbeen used to successfully represent processes such as\nSanvido\u2019s Integrated Building Process Model (Sanvido\n1990).\nIn developing a process model using the IDEF-0\ntechnique, an initial step is the establishment of the\nactivities that will comprise the model. These activities\nwere presented for discussion in preliminary workshop\nsessions with the project\u2019s industrial partners. How-\never, initial reactions to this were poor, principally\nbecause such an approach did not facilitate communi-\ncation of the process, either quickly or clearly.\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n146 Kagioglou M. et al.\nMoreover, it was found that the partners, at this\nstage, also preferred to concentrate on the general\nprinciples of the process (see later section) rather than\nthe detail of the activities involved.\nThis preference for principles was found to have a\ncertain congruence with other models of manufactur-\ning processes. Cooper\u2019s discussion of the evolution of\nthe \u2018stage gate\u2019 models in manufacturing (Cooper\n1994) and other (inter alia GPT, Fisons) industrial\nmodels demonstrate this. In such models, the graphi-\ncal representation of the process conveys its inherent\nprinciples.\nFurthermore, the IDEF-0 technique has been found\nto be effective when modelling \u2018as-is\u2019 processes; how-\never, it shows limitations when the modelling of an\nimproved \u2018will-be\u2019 process is attempted. In response to\nthis, the project team has adopted a scenario-building\ntechnique whereby the participants of workshops were\nasked to \u2018act\u2019 the roles of various functions in the\nindustry. In such, the current pitfalls of the design and\nconstruction process were identified and improve-\nments suggested. Those improvements were further\ndesigned in a diagrammatic illustration of the process\n(see Fig. 6), which was easy to understand and com-\nmunicate while at the same time offered a vision of the\nfuture.\nLiterature review\nA wide literature review of primary, secondary and\ntertiary sources was carried out.\nThe following literature reviews were undertaken.\nLiterature review of NPD in manufacturing\nNPD in manufacturing relates closely to the design\nand construction process. This literature review iden-\ntified the development of the stage gate approach\nthrough three generations and its use in the manufac-\nturing industry. It also identified the key principles\nunderlying stage gate methodologies, which could be\ntransferred to the construction sector.\nLiterature review of process in construction\nThis identified the various research groups conducting\nrelevant work. For example, Agile construction (Bath\nUniversity), Design Management (Loughborough\nUniversity), Construction Business Process Reengi-\nneering CORE (Southampton University), Sanvido\n(Pennsylvania University) and Lean Production (VTT\nFinland). The review also identified some construc-\ntion-related process maps such as BAA, RIBA plan of\nwork and British Property Federation (BPF).\nLiterature review of IT support for construction\nProjects such as Architecture, Methodology and Tools\nfor Computer-Integrated Large-Scale Engineering\n(ATLAS), COmputer Models for the Building INdus-\ntry in Europe (COMBINE), COnstruction Modelling\nand Methodologies for Intelligent information inTe-\ngration (COMMIT), Simultaneous Prototyping for An\nintegrated Construction Environment (SPACE), Infor-\nmation:integration for CONstruction (ICON), Open\nSystems for CONstruction (OSCON) were investi-\ngated as to their relevance to the project.\nThese literature reviews enabled the development of\nthe key principles underlying a process for design and\nconstruction. In conjunction with an assessment of\nprocess modelling techniques, the reviews contributed\nto a first model of the Process Protocol and the IT,\nwhich could support it.\nKEY PRINC IPLES OF THE PROCESS\nPROTOCOL\nAs a result of the initial review of the literature and the\nidentification of the industry\u2019s requirements through\nadditional interviews with practitioners, six key princi-\nples are considered to provide the basis for an im-\nproved process. They are drawn heavily from the\nmanufacturing sector, where process thinking and con-\ntinuous improvement has been focused on for some\n30 years. In addition, many of the principles relate to\nrecognized problem areas in construction, where sig-\nnificant improvements have been called for (inter alia\nBanwell 1964; Latham 1994). The six principles are as\nfollows.\nWhole project view\nIn the construction industry, the definition of a project\nhas traditionally been synonymous with actual con-\nstruction works. As such, the pre- and postconstruc-\ntion activities have been sidelined and often\naccelerated to reach the construction stage or to move\non to the \u2018new job\u2019. This has resulted in poor client\nrequirements identification and has delayed the expo-\nsure of any potential solutions to the need to any\ninternal and external specialists. Any contemporary\nattempt to either define or create a \u2018design and con-\nstruction process\u2019 will have to cover the whole \u2018life\u2019 of\na project from recognition of a need to the operation of\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n147The Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol in construction\nFigure 4 The \u2018stage gate\u2019 approach.\nthe finished facility and, finally, to its demolition. This\napproach ensures that all issues are considered from\nboth a business and a technical point of view. Further-\nmore, it recognizes and emphasizes the interdepen-\ndency of activities throughout the duration of a\nproject. It is also focused at the \u2018front end\u2019 activities,\nwhereby attention is paid to the identification, defini-\ntion and evaluation of client requirements in order to\nidentify suitable solutions.\nA consistent process\nDuring the review of existing models and descriptions\nof the design and construction process, it was quickly\nestablished that little consistency existed. In such an\nenvironment, the problems encountered by TMOs\nworking can be compounded. Luck & Newcombe\n(1996) supported this view, describing the \u2018role ambi-\nguity\u2019 commonly associated with construction projects.\nDevelopment of this generic Process Protocol provides\nthe potential to establish its consistent application.\nConsistency of use should reduce the scope for ambi-\nguity. This, together with the adoption of a standard\napproach to performance measurement, evaluation\nand control, should facilitate a process of continual\nimprovement in design and construction.\nProgressive design fixity\nThe \u2018stage gate\u2019 approach found in manufacturing\nprocesses (Cooper 1994) applies a consistent planning\nand review procedure throughout the process, as\nshown in Fig. 4.\nPhase reviews are conducted at the end of each\nphase with the aim of reviewing the work executed in\nthe phase, approving progress to the next phase, and\nplanning the resourcing and execution of the next one.\nCooper (1994), in his third generation process, saw\nthe need for \u2018conditional-go\u2019 decisions at phase gates,\nto accommodate aspects of concurrency. This philoso-\nphy is translated in the development of the protocol\u2019s\nphase gates. Phase gates are classed as either soft or\nhard, with the \u2018soft gates\u2019 allowing the potential for\nconcurrency in the process whilst ensuring that the key\ndecision points in the process are respected, as shown\nin Fig. 5.\nThe potential benefit of this approach is fundamen-\ntally the progressive fixing and:or approval of informa-\ntion throughout the process. As Cooper (1994) stated,\nthe discipline of the phase review activity improved the\nconventional chaotic, ad hoc approach of manufactur-\ning to which the construction industry of today could\nbe compared.\nCo-ordination\nCo-ordination is one area in which construction is\ntraditionally perceived to perform poorly. This percep-\ntion is supported by Banwell (1964) and Latham\n(1994), in addition to many other reviews of the\nindustry. The need for improved co-ordination was\nalso highlighted by the interviews with senior managers\nundertaken during the research project.\nIt is, therefore, proposed that co-ordination of the\nProcess Protocol is undertaken, principally, by the\nprocess:change management Activity Zones (see Fig.\n6). Appointed by the client, the process manager will\nbe delegated authority to plan and co-ordinate the\nparticipants and activities of each phase throughout\nthe process. The actions of the process manager are\nsupported by the change manager, through whom all\ninformation related to the project is passed. In this\nrole, the change manager acts as the official interface\nbetween both the Activity Zones in the process and,\nultimately, the legacy archive.\nStakeholder involvement and teamwork\nManufacturing industries have recognized that multi-\nfunction teams, established in a development process,\nreduce the likelihood of costly changes and production\ndifficulties later on in the process, by enabling design\nand manufacturing decisions earlier in the process.\nConventionally, many building projects comprise a\nteam of participants assembled specifically to facilitate\nthe development of that single project. Consequently,\na complete project team rarely works together on more\nthan one project and, as Sommerville & Stocks (1996)\nargued, this can negatively affect the assembled\n\u2018team\u2019s\u2019 performance. In addition, many key contribu-\ntors are identified and included too late in the process.\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n148 Kagioglou M. et al.\nProject success relies on the right people having the\nright information at the right time. Proactive re-\nsourcing of phases through the adoption of a \u2018stake-\nholder\u2019 view should ensure that appropriate\nparticipants (from each of the key functions) are con-\nsulted earlier in the process than is traditionally the\ncase. This, in itself, will not eliminate the problems\nassociated with TMO working. However, the active\ninvolvement of all participants, especially in the early\nphases of a project, may subsequently help to foster a\nteam environment and encourage appropriate and\ntimely communication and decision-making.\nFeedback\nIn addition to the direct teamwork problems associ-\nated with TMOs, the ability to learn from experience\nis also hampered by the continual formation and\nbreak-up of project teams. Both success and failure\ncan offer important lessons for the future; however, the\nfragmented and competitive nature of the construction\nindustry prevents the benefits of shared best practice\nbeing utilized. The phase review process facilitates a\nmeans by which project experiences can be recorded\nthroughout the process, thereby informing later phases\nand future projects. Competitive advantage will arise\nfrom how such experiences are acted upon. Shared\nknowledge may not automatically increase the compet-\nitiveness of companies working in construction. This\nProcess Protocol, therefore, proposes the creation,\nmaintenance and use of a legacy archive, which acts as\na central repository or information spine (Sheath et al.\n1996), for the information generated through each of\nthe phases of the process. The subsequent increase in\nawareness, project to project, has the potential for\nreducing risk and improving performance, which, over\ntime, may ultimately meet Latham\u2019s expectations.\nProcess Protocol elements\nThe Process Protocol model is presented in Fig. 6.\nEssentially, the model breaks down the design and\nconstruction process into 10 distinct phases. These are\ngrouped into four broad stages, namely preproject,\npreconstruction, construction and postconstruction.\nPreproject stage\nThe preproject phases relate to the strategic business\nconsiderations of any potential project that aims to\naddress a client\u2019s need. Throughout these phases, the\nclient\u2019s need is progressively defined and assessed with\nthe aim of:\n\u0093 determining the need for a construction project\nsolution; and\n\u0093 securing outline financial authority to proceed to\nthe preconstruction phases.\nIn currently acknowledged models of the design and\nconstruction process (inter alia RIBA 1980; British\nProperty Federation 1983; Hughes 1991 provides a\ncomprehensive review) and in recently published\nclient-focused guides (CIRIA 1995), this stage of a\nproject is given scant consideration, when compared\nwith the latter stages. However, the models assume\nthat clients have already established \u2018the need\u2019 when\napproaching the construction industry. Whilst there is\nlittle evidence to suggest that this is not the case, it\nwould seem reasonable to assume that the knowledge\npossessed by speculative building developers and con-\nsultants could assist any client in these early stages of\na project. The problems associated with the translation\nof this need through the conventional briefing stage of\ndesign (O\u2019Reilly 1987) have the potential for substan-\ntial elimination via such an approach.\nPreconstruction stage\nWith outline financial approval obtained, the process\nprogresses through to the preconstruction phases\nwhere the defined client\u2019s need is developed into an\nappropriate design solution. Like many conventional\nmodels of the design process, these phases develop the\ndesign through a logical sequence, with the aim of\ndelivering approved production information. The\nphase review process, however, adds the potential for\nthe progressive fixing of the design, together with its\nconcurrent development, within a formal, co-ordinated\nframework. Progressive fixity should not be confused\nwith \u2018design freeze\u2019 although, to some, this may be a\ndesired aspect of the process. The major benefit of the\nfixity of design is the potential for improved communi-\nFigure 5 The \u2018fuzzy gate\u2019 approach.\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n149The Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol in construction\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\nFi\ng\nu\nre\n6\nTh\ne\nG\nen\ner\nic\nD\nes\nig\nn\nan\nd\nC\non\nst\nru\nct\nio\nn\nP\nro\nce\nss\nP\nro\nto\nco\nl(\nG\nD\nC\nP\nP\n).\n150 Kagioglou M. et al.\ncation and co-ordination between the project\u2019s partici-\npants as they pass through each phase. Given the\ndynamic market conditions that influence many con-\nstruction client\u2019s decisions, the need for flexibility\nmust be addressed by the industry. At the end of these\nphases, the aim is to secure full financial authority to\nproceed. Only on such authority will the construction\nphase commence; this decision will be easier to make\nwhen the extent of the work and its associated risks\ncan be readily understood.\nConstruction stage\nThe construction phase is solely concerned with the\nproduction of the project solution. It is here that the\nfull benefits of the co-ordination and communication\nearlier in the process may be fully realized. Potentially,\nany changes in the client\u2019s requirements will be mini-\nmal, as the increased cost of change as the design\nprogresses should be fully understood by the time\non-site construction work begins.\nThe \u2018hard gate\u2019 that divides the preconstruction and\nconstruction phases should not prevent a \u2018work pack-\nage\u2019 approach to construction and the associated deliv-\nery time benefits that this brings. As with all activities\nin the process, where concurrency is possible it can be\naccommodated. The hard and soft gates that signify\nphase reviews merely require that approval is granted\nprior to such an activity being carried out.\nPostcompletion:construction stage\nUpon completion of the construction phase, the Pro-\ncess Protocol continues into the postconstruction\nphases, which aim to continually monitor and manage\nthe maintenance needs of the constructed facility.\nAgain, the full involvement of facilities management\nspecialists at the earlier stages of the process should\nmake the enactment of such activities less problematic.\nThe need for surveys of the completed property, for\nexample, should be avoided as all records of the devel-\nopment of the facility should have been recorded by\nthe project\u2019s legacy archive.\nThe subprocesses: \u2018activity zones\u2019\nThe earlier involvement of the project\u2019s participants\nthroughout the process is a significant development of\nthe conventional approach to building. Traditionally, a\nconstruction project\u2019s participants are referred to by\ntheir professional or expert status. Ball (1996) demon-\nstrated how this may be attributed to the inherent class\nrelations associated with each of the professions and\nexpert groups. As with all class distinctions, the effect\nthat this basis for organizational structure in design\nand construction has is division.\nA consequence of this traditional approach, by\nwhich even the more recent forms of contract procure-\nment (design and build, management contracting etc.)\nare included, is the poor communication and co-ordi-\nnation commonly associated with construction\nprojects.\nThe participants in the Process Protocol are referred\nto in terms of their primary responsibilities and are\nrepresented on the Y-axis of the process model. It is\nrecognized that traditionally, project to project, organi-\nzational roles and responsibilities change, resulting in\nambiguity and confusion (Luck & Newcombe 1996).\nBy basing the enactment of the process on the primary\nresponsibility required, the scope for confusion is po-\ntentially reduced and the potential for effective com-\nmunication and co-ordination increased. The Process\nProtocol groups the participants in any project into\n\u2018activity zones\u2019. These zones are not functional but\nrather they are multi-functional and represent struc-\ntured sets of tasks and processes that guide and sup-\nport the work towards a common objective (for\nexample, to create an appropriate design solution).\nA single person or firm can carry out an activity zone\nin small projects; however, in large and complex\nprojects, an activity zone may consist of a complex\nnetwork of people and between relevant functions\nand:or organizations. Because they are multi-func-\ntional, membership of the \u2018zones\u2019 is determined by the\nspecific project task and:or process. For example, de-\nsign management often has important input in the\nproduction management and facilities management ac-\ntivity zones amongst others and vice versa.\nOf the activity zones associated with the model, not\nall will be discussed here in detail. Most of the \u2018zones\u2019\nare self-explanatory. However, the role of the process:\nchange management and development management\nactivity zones will be described, as they present a\nsignificant departure from the conventional view of the\ndesign and construction process.\nProcess:change management\nThe process:change management activity zones are\nessentially the interface between the development\nmanagement and the other project participants. Pro-\ncess management has a role independent of all other\nactivity zones. A distinction must be made between\nthis conventional view of a project manager and the\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n151The Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol in construction\nprocess management role. Process management, as the\ntitle suggests, is concerned with the enactment of the\nprocess rather than the project. Key to the success of\neach phase in the process is the production of project\ndeliverables (reports and documentation associated\nwith each phase). In this respect, the process manage-\nment is responsible for facilitating and co-ordinating\nthe participants required to produce the necessary\ndeliverables. Acting as the development management\u2019s\n\u2018agent\u2019, it will ensure the enactment of each phase as\nplanned, culminating with the presentation of the de-\nliverables at each end of phase review.\nThe change management function is further distinct\nfrom the process management zone, as this role is\nsolely concerned with (as its name also suggests) the\nmanagement of change(s) that occur during the pro-\ncess. As the project becomes increasingly defined as\neach phase is enacted, changes (or rather updates) to\nthe information required for the development of the\nproject will be produced. These updates will be con-\ntained within the work required to develop the deliver-\nable documentation associated with each phase. With\nrespect to this, the change management activity zone\nfacilitates the holding, review and dissemination of all\nthis information as the project progresses.\nIt is within the change management function that IT\npotentially plays a fundamental role. Given the vast\namount of information generated throughout a\nproject\u2019s lifecycle (Aouad et al. 1994), and the need for\nits quick and effective dissemination, IT may offer a\ncapable solution. However, the need for judgement\nand discretion, especially in the earlier strategic phases\nof the process, will always involve the development\nmanagement\u2019s intervention and this alone is likely to\nprohibit the use of IT as a total solution. Aouad et al.\n(1998) further described the role of IT within the\nProcess Protocol.\nDeliverables\nEach gate of the Process Protocol represents a deci-\nsion-making point. The decisions are based primarily\non documented project and process information,\nwhich are called deliverables. They are primarily com-\npiled by project management to form the phase review\nreport. The report includes all the deliverables (see Fig.\n6) specific to the phase and as they are defined by the\nProcess Protocol for the specific project. This phase\nreview report forms the basis for the client body (i.e.\ndevelopment management) to make a decision con-\ncerning the future of the project.\nThe deliverables are \u2018live\u2019 documents, which change\nthroughout the majority of the process. They can be in\none of the following states:\n\u0093 initial: preliminary information is presented;\n\u0093 updated: current information is updated;\n\u0093 revised: major changes:decisions will significantly\nalter the content and context of the deliverable; and\n\u0093 finalized: the information presented is agreed and is\nunlikely to change throughout the duration of the\nproject.\nSummary and concluding remarks\nThe principles of the Process Protocol can, therefore,\nbe summarized as a framework model that is capable\nof representing the diverse interests of all the parties\ninvolved in the process, which is sufficiently repeatable\nand definable to allow IT to be devised to support this\nmanagement and information management. There-\nfore, a mechanism by which the systematic and consis-\ntent interfacing of the existing practices, professional\npractice and IT practice support tools can be facili-\ntated. The simplicity within the protocol allows its\ninterpretation and flexible application. This is achieved\nat a variety of strategic levels across a variety of scales\nof projects, using combinations of virtual teams and IT\nsystems; all are based within clarity in terms of what is\nrequired from whom, when and with whose co-opera-\ntion; for whom the requirements are to be delivered,\nfor what purposes and how they will be evaluated\n(through the phase review board). Other principles\nunderlying the Process Protocol were the standardiza-\ntion of deliverables and roles associated with achieving\nmanaging and reviewing the process and the product.\nThe Process Protocol is divided into a series of\nsubphases defined as preproject, preconstruction, con-\nstruction and postconstruction; within each of these\nmajor phases are subphases that can be operated con-\ncurrently or concatenate to make the process more\nefficient in smaller scale projects.\nNovelty arises within the Process Protocol in a num-\nber of areas, in particular: the extension of the\nboundaries of design and construction process into the\nrequirements capture phase of prebriefing client deci-\nsion-making; the extension of the boundary of the\nprocess beyond practicable completion to allow the\nmanagement of use and the learning from performance\nin use to improve the product and process for future\nprojects; the creation of an explicit process manage-\nment and change management role to co-ordinate the\nfunctionaries and deliverables associated with the pro-\n\u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 7 \f 2, 141\u2013153\n152 Kagioglou M. et al.\ncess, the information that supports the functional roles\nand is delivered via the creation and products, and a\nstable platform to allow innovations in process and in\nproducts and operations to be facilitated in a co-ordi-\nnated and repeatable manner.\nSubprocess development\nThe effective implementation of the Process Protocol\nwill greatly depend on its ability to effectively translate\nthe strategic to the operational level. To this end,\nfurther work (which has been initiated) is needed in\nexamining the subprocesses (activity zone) and to pro-\nduce generic maps for those subprocesses.\nIn such a way, the underlying principles and\nphilosophies of the Process Protocol will form the\nframework for company:project-based wide adoption\nand effective implementation. This is confirmed by the\nadoption of the Process Protocol by the CRISP Pro-\ncess Group with the comment that sublevel process\ndefinition needs to be defined. In addition, such devel-\nopment will address all of the issues identified in the\nConstruction Round Table (CRT) \u2018Agenda for\nChange\u2019. Furthermore, a number of companies such\nas Alfred McAlpine, BT, Tarmac, AMEC, BNFL,\nBAe, and institutions such as the International Al-\nliance for Interoperability (IAI) Client Briefing Do-\nmain have adopted the Process Protocol as a\nframework and process management mechanism.\nFurthermore, a generic (subprocess) process will\nalso contribute to cultural change in terms of improved\ncommunication and process management between the\nfragmented groups within the construction industry.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contribu-\ntions of John Hinks, Darryl Sheath, all of the partner\ncompanies and those companies and institutions who\nenabled the data collection. In addition, we are grate-\nful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (EPSRC) for their funding and support.\nREFERENCES\nAckroyd, S. & Hughes, J.
