Risk Factors for H1N1pdm Severity PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 11 July 2011 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1001053Editors\u2019 Summary Background. In April 2009, a new strain of influenza A H1N1 was first identified in Mexico and the United States and subsequently spread around the world. In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic alert phase 6, which continued until August 2010. Throughout the pandemic, WHO and member states gathered information to characterize the patterns of risk associated with the new influenza A H1N1 virus infection and to assess the clinical picture. Although risk factors for severe disease following seasonal influenza infection have been well documented in many countries (for example, pregnancy; chronic medical conditions such as pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neuromuscular, hematologic, and metabolic disorders; some cognitive conditions; and immunodeficiency), risk factors for severe disease following infection early in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were largely unknown. Why Was This Study Done? Many countries have recently reported data on the association between severe H1N1 influenza and a variety of underlying risk factors, but because these data are presented in different formats, making direct comparisons across countries is difficult, with no clear consensus for some conditions. Therefore, to assess the frequency and distribution of known and new potential risk factors for severe H1N1 infection, this study was conducted to collect data (from 1 April 2009 to 1 January 2010) from surveillance programs of the Ministries of Health or National Public Health Institutes in 19 countries_Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong (special administrative region), Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? As part of routine surveillance, countries were asked to provide risk factor data on laboratory-confirmed H1N1 in patients who were admitted to hospital, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), or had died because of their infection, using a standardized format. The researchers grouped potential risk conditions into four categories: age, chronic medical illnesses, pregnancy (by trimester), and other conditions that were not previously considered as risk conditions for severe influenza outcomes, such as obesity. For each risk factor (except pregnancy), the researchers calculated the percentage of each group of patients using the total number of cases reported in each severity category (hospitalization, admission to ICU, and death). To evaluate the risk associated with pregnancy, the researchers used the ratio of pregnant women to all women of childbearing age (age 15\u201349 years) at each level of severity to describe the differences between levels. The researchers were able to collect data on approximately 70,000 patients requiring hospitalization, 9,700 patients admitted to the ICU, and 2,500 patients who died from H1N1 infection. The proportion of patients with H1N1 with one or more reported chronic conditions increased with severity\u2014the median was 31.1% of hospitalized patients,","cites":null},{"id":17292422,"title":"Arizona\u2014Supplemental influenza summary","authors":[],"date":"2010","doi":null,"raw":"Arizona Department of Health Services (2010) Arizona\u2014Supplemental influenza summary MMWR Week 9 (2\/28\/10\u20133\/6\/10).

The median age of patients increased with severity of disease. The highest per capita risk of hospitalization was among patients <5 y and 5\u201314 y (relative risk [RR] = 3.3 and 3.2, respectively, compared to the general population), whereas the highest risk of death per capita was in the age groups 50\u201364 y and \u226565 y (RR = 1.5 and 1.6, respectively, compared to the general population). Similarly, the ratio of H1N1pdm deaths to hospitalizations increased with age and was the highest in the \u226565-y-old age group, indicating that while infection rates have been observed to be very low in the oldest age group, risk of death in those over the age of 64 y who became infected was higher than in younger groups. The proportion of H1N1pdm patients with one or more reported chronic conditions increased with severity (median = 31.1%, 52.3%, and 61.8% of hospitalized, ICU-admitted, and fatal H1N1pdm cases, respectively). With the exception of the risk factors asthma, pregnancy, and obesity, the proportion of patients with each risk factor increased with severity level.

The median age of patients increased with\nseverity of disease. The highest per capita risk of hospitalization was among patients,5 y and 5\u201314 y (relative risk [RR] = 3.3\nand 3.2, respectively, compared to the general population), whereas the highest risk of death per capita was in the age\ngroups 50\u201364 y and $65 y (RR = 1.5 and 1.6, respectively, compared to the general population). Similarly, the ratio of\nH1N1pdm deaths to hospitalizations increased with age and was the highest in the $65-y-old age group, indicating that\nwhile infection rates have been observed to be very low in the oldest age group, risk of death in those over the age of 64 y\nwho became infected was higher than in younger groups. The proportion of H1N1pdm patients with one or more reported\nchronic conditions increased with severity (median = 31.1%, 52.3%, and 61.8% of hospitalized, ICU-admitted, and fatal\nH1N1pdm cases, respectively). With the exception of the risk factors asthma, pregnancy, and obesity, the proportion of\npatients with each risk factor increased with severity level. For all levels of severity, pregnant women in their third trimester\nconsistently accounted for the majority of the total of pregnant women. Our findings suggest that morbid obesity might be\na risk factor for ICU admission and fatal outcome (RR = 36.3).\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate that risk factors for severe H1N1pdm infection are similar to those for seasonal\ninfluenza, with some notable differences, such as younger age groups and obesity, and reinforce the need to identify and\nprotect groups at highest risk of severe outcomes.\nPlease see later in the article for the Editors\u2019 Summary.\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 1 July 2011 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1001053\nCitation: Van Kerkhove MD, Vandemaele KAH, Shinde V, Jaramillo-Gutierrez G, Koukounari A, et al.

CG has been involved in the\nprocess of preparing and developing the National Pandemic Plan since 2002. During the pandemic CG was in charge of the coordination of the Executive\nCommittee for outbreaks and health emergencies in Chile. This committee was responsible for making decisions and implementing measures for prevention and\ncontrol. Also, until August 2010, CG participated in the implementation of IHR 2005 in Chile. During the pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)\nprovided funds to the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Public Health for studies and improvement of epidemiological surveillance. CG was not responsible\nfor managing these resources. PAHO also delivered primers and other supplies for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza (RT-PCR). They provided computers for\ninfluenza sentinel centers for improving the opportunity of reporting, which also included the development of a web application for online notification. CG was a\nmember of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) and on Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), 2009, between April\n2010 and April 2011. The result of the work of this committee was submitted to the World Health Assembly in May 2011. In December 2010 (29 November to 15\nDecember) CG was part of a mission to assess the health sector response to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico. This mission was requested by the Ministry of\nHealth of Mexico to PAHO. Other mission members were Dr. Jarbas Barbosa (Brazil), Dr. Hande Harmanci (WHO), Dr. Juan Pablo Sarmiento (Colombia), Dr. Ronald\nSt. John (Canada). For this work CG received airfare and per diem supplemented by the standards of PAHO. CG has been invited to present the Chilean experience\nduring the influenza pandemic 2009 in various national and international conferences. CG currently works at the Universidad del Desarrollo (Santiago, Chile) as a\nteacher and researcher; also at EPI-Sur Consultants, an institution dedicated to providing advisory services and consulting in the field of international health for\nagencies, governments, and NGOs. EPI-Sur Consultants have worked for PAHO in the field of infectious diseases (not on influenza). VJL has received unrelated\nresearch funding from GlaxoSmithKline.

This virus quickly\nspread globally, and on June 11, 2009, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) declared a pandemic alert phase 6,\nindicating that the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century\nhad begun [1\u20133]. Many Northern hemisphere temperate countries\nexperienced their first wave of infection during the spring and\nsummer months of 2009, followed by an early 2009 fall influenza\nseason. Southern hemisphere temperate countries experienced the\nfirst wave of infection during their winter of 2009, and at the time\nof writing are finishing their winter 2010 season. By the end of\n2009, the peak of the local influenza epidemic had passed in most\ncountries around the world [4].\nSince the start of the pandemic, WHO and member states have\nbeen gathering information to characterize the clinical picture and\npatterns of risk associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A\nH1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus infection to assist public health policy\nmakers in targeting of vaccination strategies, antiviral use, and\nother control measures. Risk factors for severe disease following\nseasonal influenza infection have been well documented in many\ncountries, and include chronic medical conditions such as\npulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neuromuscular, hema-\ntologic, and metabolic disorders, some cognitive conditions, and\nimmunodeficiency [5\u20137]. The risk associated with seasonal\ninfluenza during pregnancy is less well documented but in\nprevious pandemics, pregnant women were identified as being at\nincreased risk of adverse outcomes, and many countries include\nhealthy pregnant women among the seasonal influenza high risk\ngroups as well [8\u201311]. However, early in the 2009 H1N1\npandemic, risk factors for severe disease following infection were\nlargely unknown. Following a series of teleconferences organized\nby WHO with clinicians treating H1N1pdm patients around the\nworld, it appeared that the most common risk factors for severe\nH1N1pdm disease were similar to those for seasonal influenza\ninfection; however, several new factors (e.g., obesity and\ntuberculosis [TB]) were also observed with high frequency in\nsome countries. It was also noted that members of indigenous\/\naboriginal communities in some countries appeared to be\noverrepresented among severe cases [12].\nWhile many countries have recently reported data on the\nassociation between severe H1N1pdm influenza and the presence\nof a variety of underlying risk factors (e.g., [13\u201326]), these data are\npresented in different formats, making direct comparisons across\ncountries difficult, and no clear consensus has emerged for some\nconditions. This paper presents data from approximately 70,000\nlab-confirmed hospitalized and 2,500 fatal cases of H1N1pdm\ninfection in 19 countries or administrative regions\u2014Argentina,\nAustralia, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong\nSAR, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, the United\nStates, and the United Kingdom\u2014in order to characterize and\ncompare the distribution of underlying risk factors among\nH1N1pdm confirmed patients who were hospitalized, admitted\nto an intensive care unit (ICU), or died, and to assess the frequency\nand distribution of known and new potential risk factors for severe\nH1N1pdm infection.\nMethods\nThis study compares data primarily obtained from surveillance\nprograms of the Ministries of Health or National Public Health\nInstitutes of 19 countries or administrative regions covering the\nperiod 1 April 2009 to 1 January 2010. Countries were asked to\nprovide risk factor data on laboratory-confirmed cases using a\nstandardized format for this analysis. The data were collected in\nthe course of routine surveillance, methods of which varied from\ncountry to country [27\u201349], and were reported anonymously and\nas aggregate data; hence, no ethics approval was required. It\nshould be noted that considerable effort was put into negotiating\npermission for these data to be presented in these formats. As\nmany countries would not be willing to have their country-specific\ndata published in direct comparisons with others, we are taking the\napproach of publishing data from a wide range of countries and\nshowing the variability observed, so that results from specific\nstudies can be compared with the international results reported\nhere.\nPotential risk factors were grouped into four categories: age,\nchronic medical illnesses, pregnancy (by trimester), and \u2018\u2018other,\u2019\u2019\nwhich included conditions that were not previously considered as\nrisk factors for severe influenza outcomes, such as obesity,\nmembership in a vulnerable social or ethnic group, and TB.\nDetails of the standardized format and definitions of each of the\nconditions are provided in Text S1.\nRisk factor information was collected separately for three levels\nof severity of illness in laboratory-confirmed patients: hospitaliza-\ntions, admissions to ICU, and fatalities by country. Details of the\navailable data from countries by risk factor and severity level are\nprovided in Text S1. For each risk factor, except for pregnancy,\nthe percentage of patients who were hospitalized, were admitted to\nICU, and died was calculated using the total number of cases\nreported in each severity category. To evaluate the risk associated\nwith pregnancy, the ratio of pregnant women to all women of\nchildbearing age (age 15\u201349 y) in each level of severity was used to\ndescribe the differences between levels. The overall median and\ninterquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated for each risk factor\nusing all available data. In addition, where available, countries\nprovided baseline comparison data for prevalence of the risk factor\nin the general population (details and sources provided in Text\nS1). Data on age were provided by age groups (,5, 5\u201314, 15\u201324,\n25\u201349, 50\u201364, and $65 y).\nRisk of Severe Disease\nWhere data were available, we calculated the risk for severe\nH1N1pdm outcomes (hospitalization, admission to ICU, and\ndeath) compared to the prevalence of risk factors in the general\npopulation (relative risk [RR] of hospitalization [RRhosp], RR of\nICU admission [RRICU], and RR of death [RRdeath]) by country.\nSee Text S1 for more information and formulae.\nFor pregnancy, we first calculated the proportion of women of\nchildbearing age who were pregnant in each severity category by\ndividing the number of pregnant women in that category by the\nnumber of women of childbearing age in that category. As\nindividual case data were not available, we calculated the number\nof fertile women in each level of severity using the numbers of\npatients in each level of severity in the age range between 15 and\n49 y multiplied by the percentage for that severity level that was\nfemale. Unless provided by the country, the point prevalence of\npregnant women in the general population (the denominator of\nthe RR calculation) was calculated using crude birth rate and 2010\nUnited Nations population estimates [50] to derive the annual\nnumber of pregnancies, multiplied by 40\/52 and without adjusting\nfor seasonality of pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, early\ndeliveries, or multiple births. We also calculated the country-\nspecific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for\ndeath given hospitalization separately for each risk factor (i.e., the\nodds of death given hospitalization and a specific risk factor),\nthereby comparing the odds of death in one group (e.g., among\nRisk Factors for H1N1pdm Severity\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 3 July 2011 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1001053\nhospitalized patients with asthma) with the odds of death in all\nother hospitalized patients combined (e.g., among hospitalized\npatients without asthma) (individual country ORs not shown). We\nthen used the I2 statistic to quantify the percentage of variation\nacross countries that is due to true underlying heterogeneity in the\nORs rather than chance variability [51]. The I2 statistics for all\nexamined risk factors indicated that there was substantial true\nunderlying variation between ORs from different countries. We\nundertook meta-analyses with and without random effects in\nparallel to describe the distribution of the OR estimates across the\ncountries for which data were available for analysis. As expected,\ngiven the heterogeneity observed between countries, the random\neffects meta-analysis yielded wider CIs. We conservatively report\nthe pooled estimates from the random effects meta-analysis to\ndescribe the distribution of the OR estimates across the countries\nfor which data were available for analysis. Underlying the random\neffects approach is the assumption that, although the individual\ncountries give rise to different OR estimates, these estimates arise\nfrom a distribution with a central value, the estimate of which is\nreferred to as the \u2018\u2018pooled OR,\u2019\u2019 and normally distributed\nvariability around this value. However, because of the limited\nnumber of countries in each analysis, the number of random\neffects is too small for diagnostics such as quantile\u2013quantile plots to\ndemonstrate whether the assumption of a normal distribution is\nvalid.\nFinally, with a meta-analysis of data from such diverse countries\nas those included in this study, reasons for heterogeneity were\nsought through exploratory meta-regression analyses. However,\nbecause of the limited number of countries included in the meta-\nregression models, and with country being the unit of analysis, the\nmeta-regression results were not considered to be robust and so are\nnot presented or discussed further [52].\nAll meta-analyses and meta-regression techniques were per-\nformed using Stata version 10 (StataCorp).\nResults\nData were collected on approximately 70,000 patients requiring\nhospitalization, 9,700 patients admitted to ICU, and 2,500\nfatalities from 19 countries and administrative regions across the\nAmericas, Asia, Europe, and Africa.\nAge and Gender\nApproximately half of all patients included in this analysis in\neach level of severity were female (49.8%, 47.0%, and 44.7% of all\nhospitalized, ICU-admitted, and fatal H1N1pdm cases, respec-\ntively). This proportion did not vary significantly by country\n(Table 1). Age was associated with increased risk of poor outcome,\nas indicated by several different parameters. The median age of\npatients increased with increasing levels of severity (Table 1).\nAmong hospitalized patients, the median age within each country\nranged from 7 y in Japan to 38 y in Spain, with a median reported\nvalue among all countries that provided data (n = 14) of 19 y (IQR\n14.8\u201327.5); among patients admitted to ICU, the median age\nwithin each country ranged from 28 y in China to 49.5 y in Hong\nKong SAR, with a median value among all countries that\nprovided data (n = 9) of 42 y (IQR 35.0\u201345.0); and among fatal\ncases, median age within each country ranged from 30 y in China\nto 56 y in Hong Kong SAR, with a median value among all\ncountries that provided data (n = 13) of 46 y (IQR 37.0\u201342.0).\nWhen the age distribution of the proportion of patients in each\nlevel of severity was compared to the distribution in the general\npopulation, the RR was highest in the age groups ,5 y and\n5\u201314 y (RRhosp = 3.3 and 3.2, respectively) but the RR of death\nwas highest in the age groups 50\u201364 y and $65 y (RRdeath = 1.6\nand 1.7, respectively) (Figure 1). The ratio of H1N1pdm deaths to\nhospitalizations increased with age and was the highest in the\n$65-y-old age group in all countries for which data were available\n(Figure 2).\nChronic Illness\nThe proportion of H1N1pdm patients with at least one chronic\nmedical condition generally increased with severity (median\namong all countries that provided data was 31.1% [n = 14],\n52.3% [n = 10], and 61.8% [n = 16] of hospitalized, ICU-admitted,\nand fatal H1N1pdm cases, respectively (Table 1). This pattern was\nobserved for most countries (individual country data not shown).\nFor nearly every individual risk factor under study, the prevalence\nincreased significantly with severity level. Chronic respiratory\nconditions excluding asthma (median = 10.3%, 17.2%, and\n20.4%, respectively) and asthma (median = 17.6%, 9.8%, and\n5.3%, respectively) were the risk factors most often reported\namong severe cases, followed closely by diabetes (median = 9.0%,\n13.6%, and 14.4%, respectively) and chronic cardiac conditions\n(median = 7.1%, 10.9%, and 12.1%, respectively). The pooled OR\nfor death given hospitalization was significantly above one for each\nrisk factor listed, with the exception of asthma, and was highest for\nchronic liver disease and immunocompromised patients (Figure 3).\nThe risk of severe disease due to H1N1 infection, including\nhospitalization and death, was elevated for every chronic condition\nfor which data were available (Table 1). Notably, the RR for fatal\ndisease due to H1N1pdm infection was elevated for asthma\n(median RRdeath = 1.7 [IQR 1.5\u20132.1]) and not markedly different\nfrom the RR associated with hospitalizations (median RRhosp = 1.8\n[IQR 1.2\u20132.6]). Data on chronic illness rates in the general\npopulation were not available from enough countries to permit an\nassessment of the relative magnitude of risk associated with various\nconditions with certainty.\nPregnancy\nThe proportions of women of childbearing age who were\nhospitalized with H1N1 and were pregnant as part of all\nhospitalizations (median of all country data = 17.4% [IQR 13.5\u2013\n30.2]), who were admitted to ICU (median of all country\ndata = 15.0% [IQR 9.4\u201324.2]), and who died (median of all\ncountry data = 6.9% [0.0\u20139.1]) varied within each country.\nPregnant women in their third trimester consistently accounted\nfor more than half of all pregnant women among hospitalized,\nICU-admitted, and fatal cases. However, with the exception of\nChina, Thailand, and the US, the proportion of pregnant women\ndecreased with increasing level of severity, and the pooled OR for\ndeath given hospitalization during pregnancy was below 1 (pooled\nOR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.2\u20132.5).\nPregnant women with H1N1pdm infection were at higher risk\nof hospitalization than women of childbearing age in the general\npopulation without H1N1pdm infection, with an unadjusted RR\nof hospitalization ranging from 3.5 in Germany to 25.3 in France\n(median RRhosp = 6.8, n = 10 countries). The unadjusted RR of\ndeath, while elevated compared to non-pregnant women in more\nthan half of countries, was generally lower than that for\nhospitalization, with a median RRdeath of 1.9 (n = 11 countries).\nFour areas (Japan, the Netherlands, Hong Kong SAR, and\nSingapore) had a RRdeath of zero.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe proportion of patients with obesity (body mass index [BMI]\n$30 or clinically judged as obese) increased with increasing\ndisease severity and represented a median of 6%, 11.3%, and\nRisk Factors for H1N1pdm Severity\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 4 July 2011 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1001053\n12.0% of all hospitalized, ICU-admitted, and fatal H1N1pdm\ncases, respectively, and this pattern was also observed for morbid\nobesity (BMI .40), with 3.0%, 5.0%, and 15.2%, respectively\n(Table 1). However, this pattern was not consistently reported in\neach country. For example, France, Thailand, and China\nobserved similar proportions of obese patients among ICU-\nadmitted and fatal cases, while Hong Kong SAR reported a lower\nprevalence of obesity among fatal cases than among ICU\nadmissions. Using data from all countries, the pooled OR for\ndeath given hospitalization for obesity (BMI $30 or clinically\njudged as obese) was 2.9 (95% CI 1.3\u20136.6; Figure 3). Compared to\nthe general population in the two countries for which data were\navailable, the risk of death associated with morbid obesity was\nincreased (mean RRdeath = 36.3 [IQR 22.4\u201350.1], n = 2).\nCanada, Australia, and New Zealand reported significant\ndisparities in the burden of severe H1N1pdm disease across\ndifferent ethnic groups. In these three countries, indigenous\npopulation groups were overrepresented among severe H1N1pdm\ncases requiring hospitalization and among fatal cases. In contrast,\nin Thailand and Mexico, minority groups were underrepresented\namong severe H1N1pdm cases. Taken together, the unadjusted\nmedian RR of hospitalization for H1N1pdm patients among\nminority groups was 1.0 (IQR 0.2\u20133.7) and the median RR of\ndeath was 2.4 (IQR 1.2\u20133.8). TB data were reported from three\ncountries, and the incidence increased slightly with level of\nseverity. The disease was reported in a median of 1.7%, 1.3%, and\n2.6% of hospitalized, ICU-admitted, and fatal H1N1pdm cases,\nrespectively. We were not specifically able to evaluate HIV\nTable 1.

Consistent\nwith other published data, our results reaffirm that the age\ndistribution of severe H1N1pdm cases significantly differs from\nthat of seasonal influenza [53\u201356]. The highest rates of\nhospitalization per capita were in children ,15 y, but the highest\nrates of mortality per capita were in persons over 64 y. The low\napparent attack rate in the oldest age group, evidenced by low\nrates of hospitalization, and the high odds associated with age in\nthe fatal group compared to hospitalized cases seems to indicate\nthat although older adults may have a lower risk of infection, they\nhave a significantly higher risk of death if they are infected [54,57\u2013\n61]. It is likely that increasing prevalence of chronic risk conditions\nin the oldest age group contributes to this effect, but our data do\nnot allow for quantification of this association.\nOur results demonstrate that in a significant portion of severe\nand fatal cases, patients had preexisting chronic illness, and that\nthe presence of chronic illness increased the likelihood of death. It\nwas notable, however, that approximately 2\/3 of hospitalized\ncases and 40% of fatal cases did not have any identified preexisting\nchronic illness. It is unknown how many of these cases had other\nrisk factors, such as pregnancy, obesity, and substance abuse\n(including smoking and alcohol), for which we had insufficient\ninformation in this study. These figures are also dependent on the\ncompleteness of available data for recorded risk factors. As with\nseasonal influenza, the most common underlying chronic\nconditions among hospitalized patients were respiratory disease,\nasthma, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, we found that\nalthough asthma was frequently associated with both hospitaliza-\ntion and death in most countries, with an increased RR for both,\nthe OR for death given hospitalization suggested that a higher\nproportion of hospitalized cases survived compared to patients\nwith other conditions. This may represent the occurrence of\nmanageable influenza-induced exacerbations of asthma prompting\nadmission that do not progress to viral pneumonia or other fatal\ncomplications, and may also reflect the fact that asthma tends to\noccur in younger age groups [62].\nEarly data suggested that pregnancy might be an important risk\nfactor for severe disease with H1N1pdm [21,25,63,64]. Our\nanalysis is consistent with these reports and more recent studies\n[47,65], which found an overall trend that pregnant women,\nmainly in their third trimester, have a higher incidence of\nhospitalization than the general population. Several published\nstudies have also shown that pregnancy is associated with a higher\nrisk of ICU admission and fatal outcome [54,58,66,67]. In our\nanalysis, the risk associated with pregnancy was elevated for both\nhospitalization and fatality compared to women of childbearing\nage, though the latter association was not consistently observed in\nevery country. As with asthma, the proportion of pregnant women\nFigure 2. Ratio of confirmed H1N1pdm deaths to hospitalizations for selected countries.

The greater risk for hospitalization than for death\nwith H1N1pdm influenza infection during pregnancy may have\nresulted from a lower threshold for admitting infected pregnant\nwomen to hospital and\/or a more aggressive approach to antiviral\nor other treatment for pregnant women. In addition, the\noccurrence of non-respiratory complications of pregnancy, such\nas hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and premature labor, provoked by\nH1N1pdm infection may have increased the risk of hospitalization\nwhile not resulting in death [68]. This would be consistent with\npublished reports of case series of pregnant patients that list\ncomplications of pregnancy as a common cause of admission\n[63,69,70]. The dataset did not allow us to adjust for underlying\nconditions in pregnant women, and thus to distinguish between\nrisks for healthy pregnant women, and pregnant women with\nunderlying medical conditions; however, we believe that the results\nsupport an approach of early intervention with pregnant women\nwho develop influenza.\nEarly in the 2009 pandemic, clinicians from the US reported a\nsurprisingly high prevalence of morbid obesity, a risk factor not\npreviously associated with severe outcomes for seasonal influenza\ninfection, in patients with severe complications of H1N1pdm\ninfection [71]. Subsequent studies in several countries, including\nthe US, Mexico, Canada, Spain, Greece, France, Australia, and\nNew Zealand, reported high proportions of obesity among ICU\nadmissions and fatal cases [13,20,58,64,72\u201377]. Our results\nprovide supportive evidence that obesity may be a risk factor for\nsevere disease, as seen in the increasing proportion of morbidly\nobese patients with severity level and the associated elevated OR.\nOur findings also suggest that morbidly obese patients with\nH1N1pdm are more likely to die if hospitalized; however, the\nresults in our analysis were not consistent across all countries. The\nassociation between obesity (or morbid obesity) and severe\noutcomes may reflect direct causation (e.g., due to greater\nrespiratory strain of infection on obese individuals), causation\nthrough other known risk factors (e.g., obesity causes diabetes and\nheart disease, which pose an increased risk for severe outcome\n[36]), or a noncausal association, if some other factor (e.g., genetic\nor dietary) caused both morbid obesity and increased risk of severe\noutcome. Unfortunately, our dataset did not allow us to distinguish\namong these nonexclusive alternatives.\nIndigenous populations and ethnic minorities have been\nreported to experience a disproportionately high burden of severe\nH1N1pdm infection, particularly in the Americas [14,21,23,36,\n64,75,78\u201380] and the Australasia-Pacific region [43,80\u201382],\nsimilar to reports during the 1918 influenza pandemic [83\u201385].\nOur analysis of Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian data\nconcur with these published reports, and while compelling, were\nnot universal. Neither Thailand nor Mexico observed a signifi-\ncantly increased burden of severe H1N1pdm disease among\nindigenous or minority populations. Our data are not sufficient to\nexplain the observed differences in the reported risk of severe\ndisease among minority groups, but several hypotheses have been\nproposed, including a higher prevalence of chronic medical\nconditions known to increase risk of severe influenza, delayed or\nreduced access to healthcare, cultural differences in healthcare-\nseeking behavior and approaches to health, potential differences in\nFigure 3. Pooled odds ratio and 95% CIs of risk of death given hospitalization for selected countries.

More\nresearch is needed to better understand and quantify the increased\nrisk of severe H1N1pdm disease among these groups. However, an\nimperfect understanding of the mechanisms of health disparities\nrelated to severe H1N1pdm disease should not impede the public\nhealth community in undertaking actions to mitigate this risk by\ndisseminating appropriate public information, targeting outreach\nand prevention programs, and involving at-risk population groups\nin pandemic planning.\nOur analysis has a number of limitations, not least of which is the\nwide differences in surveillance systems, case management policies,\nand antiviral use in the countries studied. The criteria and\nindications for hospital and ICU admission for certain conditions\n(e.g., pregnancy and asthma) and by age (e.g., pediatric patients)\nvaried significantly by country, and may have been somewhat\ndependent on capacity for admission, which likely varied over time.\nRisk factors are also dependent on the completeness and quality of\ndata on risk factors reported and classification of death in the\nabsence of complete testing. These variables could lead to a bias in\nthe estimate of these conditions among severe cases and could make\ndirect comparisons across countries difficult. Second, our data do\nnot consider multiple risk factors for individual H1N1pdm patients.\nA lack of individual-level data on underlying medical conditions of\nH1N1pdm patients precludes our ability to sufficiently control for\nconfounding and therefore identify the independent contribution of\nindividual risk factors for severe disease and death. The differences\nobserved in risk factors for hospitalization and death among\nH1N1pdm patients compared to among seasonal influenza patients,\nand the wide range of RR values between countries may be\nexplained by differences in age structure in the general population.\nSeveral studies have identified important differences in the\nproportions of underlying conditions by age among hospitalized\nand fatal cases, including, but not limited to, the UK [15,53], the\nUS [36], Canada [47], and Singapore [39,86].\nA third limitation is related to our imperfect calculation of the\npoint prevalence of pregnancy among women of childbearing age in\nthe general population. However, we believe that our findings of the\nrange of RR values for hospitalization and death is valid, but may be\nvery slightly inflated because of undercounting in the denominator.\nThe inflationary effect of undercounting is likely greatest for\npregnant women in the first trimester, as we didn\u2019t adjust for\ncommon first trimester events such as miscarriages or abortions, and\nin this group there is likely substantial undercounting in the\nnumerator as well because of women not knowing they are pregnant\nin that period. Fourth, the data used in our analysis relied on\nhospital records, which were not standardized, and were likely to be\nincomplete or vary in quality between hospitals or countries. This\nposes a problem in the direct comparativeness between settings.\nDespite these limitations, this analysis is the first to our\nknowledge to compare risk factors across a variety of countries\nusing data from a very large number of patients, and we found a\ngreat deal of consistency for much of the data. Clearly, cardiac\ndisease, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes are important\nrisk factors for severe disease that will be especially relevant for\ncountries with high rates of these illnesses. We provide evidence to\nsupport the concern regarding obesity, particularly morbid\nobesity, as a risk factor, though this needs more study. We found\nlarge between-country variations for some important risk factors,\nmost notably pregnancy, and the reasons for these differences need\nmore study. There is evidence to suggest that the differences\nobserved for pregnancy might represent differences in case\nmanagement practices, and we believe that the available evidence\nsupports vaccination and early intervention for pregnant women.\nOur study reinforces the need to identify and target high-risk\ngroups for interventions, such as immunization, information, early\nmedical advice, and use of antiviral medications. Experience with\nthe 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the differences observed between\ncountries have highlighted the need for country-specific surveil-\nlance data and global standardization of case definitions and data\ncollection, and the usefulness of data sharing to aid policy makers\nin critical decision making for global influenza epidemics.\nSupporting Information\nText S1 Supplemental data and analysis.\n(PDF)\nAcknowledgments\nAll the listed authors are members of the WHO Working Group for Risk\nFactors for Severe H1N1pdm Infection.

In April 2009, a new strain of influenza A\nH1N1 was first identified in Mexico and the United States and\nsubsequently spread around the world. In June 2009, the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic alert\nphase 6, which continued until August 2010. Throughout the\npandemic, WHO and member states gathered information to\ncharacterize the patterns of risk associated with the new\ninfluenza A H1N1 virus infection and to assess the clinical\npicture. Although risk factors for severe disease following\nseasonal influenza infection have been well documented in\nmany countries (for example, pregnancy; chronic medical\nconditions such as pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,\nneuromuscular, hematologic, and metabolic disorders; some\ncognitive conditions; and immunodeficiency), risk factors for\nsevere disease following infection early in the 2009 H1N1\npandemic were largely unknown.\nWhy Was This Study Done? Many countries have recently\nreported data on the association between severe H1N1\ninfluenza and a variety of underlying risk factors, but because\nthese data are presented in different formats, making direct\ncomparisons across countries is difficult, with no clear\nconsensus for some conditions. Therefore, to assess the\nfrequency and distribution of known and new potential risk\nfactors for severe H1N1 infection, this study was conducted\nto collect data (from 1 April 2009 to 1 January 2010) from\nsurveillance programs of the Ministries of Health or National\nPublic Health Institutes in 19 countries_Argentina, Australia,\nCanada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong (special\nadministrative region), Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain,\nThailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find? As part of\nroutine surveillance, countries were asked to provide risk\nfactor data on laboratory-confirmed H1N1 in patients who\nwere admitted to hospital, admitted to the intensive care\nunit (ICU), or had died because of their infection, using a\nstandardized format. The researchers grouped potential risk\nconditions into four categories: age, chronic medical\nillnesses, pregnancy (by trimester), and other conditions\nthat were not previously considered as risk conditions for\nsevere influenza outcomes, such as obesity. For each risk\nfactor (except pregnancy), the researchers calculated the\npercentage of each group of patients using the total number\nof cases reported in each severity category (hospitalization,\nadmission to ICU, and death). To evaluate the risk associated\nwith pregnancy, the researchers used the ratio of pregnant\nwomen to all women of childbearing age (age 15\u201349 years)\nat each level of severity to describe the differences between\nlevels.\nThe researchers were able to collect data on approximately\n70,000 patients requiring hospitalization, 9,700 patients\nadmitted to the ICU, and 2,500 patients who died from\nH1N1 infection. The proportion of patients with H1N1 with\none or more reported chronic conditions increased with\nseverity\u2014the median was 31.1% of hospitalized patients,\n52.3% of patients admitted to the ICU, and 61.8% of patients\nwho died. For all levels of severity, pregnant women in their\nthird trimester consistently accounted for the majority of the\ntotal of pregnant women. The proportion of patients with\nobesity increased with increasing disease severity\u2014median\nof 6% of hospitalized patients, 11.3% of patients admitted to\nthe ICU, and 12.0% of all deaths from H1N1.\nWhat Do These Findings Mean? These findings show\nthat risk factors for severe H1N1 infection are similar to those\nfor seasonal influenza, with some notable differences: a\nsubstantial proportion of people with severe and fatal cases\nof H1N1 had pre-existing chronic illness, which indicates that\nthe presence of chronic illness increases the likelihood of\ndeath. Cardiac disease, chronic respiratory disease, and\ndiabetes are important risk factors for severe disease that\nwill be especially relevant for countries with high rates of\nthese illnesses. Approximately 2\/3 of hospitalized people and\n40% of people who died from H1N1 infection did not have\nany identified pre-existing chronic illness, but this study was\nnot able to comprehensively assess how many of these cases\nhad other risk factors, such as pregnancy, obesity, smoking,\nand alcohol misuse. Because of large differences between\ncountries, the role of risk factors such as obesity and\npregnancy need further study\u2014although there is sufficient\nevidence to support vaccination and early intervention for\npregnant women. Overall, the findings of this study reinforce\nthe need to identify and target high-risk groups for\ninterventions such as immunization, early medical advice,\nand use of antiviral medications.\nAdditional Information.
