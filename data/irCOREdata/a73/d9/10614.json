The outer nuclear membrane (ONM) is continuous with \nthe ER (Callan et al., 1949) and seamlessly flows into the inner \nnuclear membrane (INM) where nuclear pore complexes \n(NPCs) are inserted (Prunuske and Ullman, 2006). At these \nsites, the NE bends into a unique structure with both convex and \nconcave curvature called the pore membrane. Many NE trans-\nmembrane proteins (NETs), after their synthesis in the ER, \nspend most of their lifetime bound within the INM to the poly-\nmer of intermediate filament lamins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; \nSchirmer and Foisner, 2007). Thus, NETs must dynamically ex-\nchange between several distinct populations located in the ER, \nthe ONM, and free and tethered fractions in the INM.\nThe exchange step between ONM and INM is not fully \nunderstood, although it is generally accepted that it occurs where \nNPCs are inserted in the membrane. NPCs are symmetrical \n>40-MDa structures built from >30 distinct proteins called \nnucleoporins or Nups (Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003). Trans-\nport of soluble molecules through the NPC central channel is \nwell documented, requiring transport receptors (importins\/\nkaryopherins) that interact with Nups carrying phenylalanine- \nglycine (FG) repeats (Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003). Trans-\nport of integral proteins is less certain; however, between the \nNPC and the membrane are less-characterized \ue07a100-\u00c5 periph-\neral channels (Reichelt et al., 1990; Hinshaw et al., 1992) that \ncould allow transmembrane proteins to transit bidirectionally \nbetween the ONM and the INM by lateral diffusion.\nEarly studies supported use of the peripheral channels be-\ncause increasing the nucleoplasmic mass of INM proteins above \nthe 60-kD threshold predicted by the size of the channels \nblocked their INM accumulation (Soullam and Worman, 1995). \nThese studies proposed that INM proteins freely exchanged be-\ntween the ER and INM, but were retained in the INM by lamin \nThe nuclear envelope contains >100 transmembrane proteins that continuously exchange with the endo\u00adplasmic reticulum and move within the nuclear \nmembranes. To better understand the organization and \ndynamics of this system, we compared the trafficking \nof 15 integral nuclear envelope proteins using FRAP. \nA surprising 30\u00adfold range of mobilities was observed. \nThe dynamic behavior of several of these proteins was \nalso analyzed after depletion of ATP and\/or Ran, two \nfunctions implicated in endoplasmic reticulum\u2013inner nu\u00ad\nclear membrane translocation. This revealed that ATP\u00ad and \nRan\u00addependent translocation mechanisms are distinct and \nnot used by all inner nuclear membrane proteins. The \nRan\u00addependent mechanism requires the phenylalanine\u00ad \nglycine (FG)\u00adnucleoporin Nup35, which is consistent with \nuse of the nuclear pore complex peripheral channels. \nIntriguingly, the addition of FGs to membrane proteins \nreduces FRAP recovery times, and this also depends on \nNup35.

To obtain a more systematic perspective, a \ncollection of 15 confirmed INM NETs (Senior and Gerace, \n1988; Worman et al., 1988; Foisner and Gerace, 1993; Smith \nand Blobel, 1994; Squarzoni et al., 1998; Hodzic et al., 2004; \nMalik et al., 2010) was tested by FRAP in HeLa cells using \nidentical photobleaching conditions, e.g., laser intensity, bleach \nspot size, and measurement parameters. Nine of these were \nnovel NETs identified by proteomics (Schirmer et al., 2003), \nwhile six were well-characterized NETs including two splice \nvariants of lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1). Most of \nthe characterized NETs had been analyzed by FRAP in differ-\nent studies, though in some cases truncated proteins or different \nsplice variants were used (Ellenberg et al., 1997; Ostlund et al., \n1999; Rolls et al., 1999; Shimi et al., 2004; Goodchild and \nDauer, 2005; detailed in Materials and methods). All proteins, \nexcept for SUN2, were fused to GFP at their C termini. The \nNETs had a wide range of physical characteristics such as size, \nisoelectric points, and numbers of membrane spans (Table I).\nThe t1\/2 merely indicates the time for 50% recovery of fluores-\ncence after photobleaching and is used here as a relative measure \nof the protein mobility. The t1\/2s presented are means from at least \neight individual experiments using multiple transfections (Fig. 1, \nbinding (Powell and Burke, 1990; Soullam and Worman, 1993). \nRecent studies have suggested that this exchange\/translocation \nis more complex than free diffusion, with one finding an energy \nrequirement (Ohba et al., 2004), others showing involvement of \ncomponents used for NPC transport of soluble proteins (King \net al., 2006; Theerthagiri et al., 2010; Turgay et al., 2010), and yet \nanother supporting a signal sequence\u2013mediated event initiated \nin the ER (Saksena et al., 2004, 2006; Braunagel et al., 2007).\nTo better understand NE dynamics, we directly compared \nseveral INM proteins using a combination of FRAP and photo-\nactivation (PA) experiments in both the ER and the NE. These \ndata indicated that for many NETs, binding in the INM is so \nstable that recovery after photobleaching depended more on ex-\nchange of proteins between the ER and INM than on mobility \nwithin the INM. Indeed, modeling of the data for three NETs \nthat appear to translocate by free diffusion was consistent with \nthe significant exchange between the ER and INM, whereas the \ndifferences in the observed FRAP half-lives of these proteins \nwere shown to be largely dependent on their binding affinities in \nthe INM. Testing the effects of blocking various proposed trans-\nlocation mechanisms on the FRAP mobilities of several INM \nproteins suggests the existence of at least four distinct mecha-\nnisms: (1) one requiring ATP but not Ran, (2) one requiring Ran \nGTPase function but not ATP, (3) one requiring neither Ran nor \nATP, and (iv) one that is facilitated by addition of FGs but that \nis not Ran dependent. Finally, two of these mechanisms de-\npended on the NPC protein Nup35 (Nup53p in yeast) that faces \nthe peripheral channels in yeast (Alber et al., 2007), which is \nconsistent with previous studies arguing for translocation \nthrough these channels (Soullam and Worman, 1993, 1995; \nOhba et al., 2004).\nTable I.

We observed a 30-fold range of t1\/2s among \nthe new NETs tested here, whereas emerin and LAP2 t1\/2s were \nroughly similar to one another as described previously (Ostlund \net al., 1999; Wu et al., 2002; Shimi et al., 2004). It is notable that \nsome earlier studies differed in reported t1\/2s and mobile fractions \nfor emerin, SUN2, and lamin B receptor (LBR; Ellenberg et al., \n1997; Ostlund et al., 1999; Rolls et al., 1999), and we also observe \nminor differences from these earlier studies. These differences are \nprobably caused by differences in the cell lines, constructs, and \nphotobleach parameters used. This, however, could not account \nfor the relative differences we observed across the wide range of \nNETs tested here, where all these parameters are constant. These \ndifferences also could not be caused by GFP photophysics because \nno recovery was observed in fixed samples (not depicted).\nFigure 1. FRAP of NETs reveals a wide range of \nmobilities.

Nonetheless, ER mobilities, though generally simi-\nlar, were not all identical, which suggests that some NETs may \nhave separate binding partners in the ER or an initial licensing \nstep, as has been indicated for LBR (Braunagel et al., 2007). \nAll NE and ER recovery curves as well as mobile fractions are \ngiven in Figs.

A GFP fusion of the ER protein Sec61\ue062 served as a con-\ntrol. Any nuclear rim accumulation for Sec61\ue062 should derive \nfrom the ONM, which is continuous with the ER, because it is \nknown to not accumulate in the INM; therefore, NE FRAP for \nSec61\ue062 should roughly match ER FRAP, and this was observed \n(Fig. 1 B, inset). In contrast, FRAP t1\/2s measured for NETs \nwere systematically and statistically significantly smaller in the \nER than in the NE. If NETs with slow NE recovery (large t1\/2s) \nwere also slow to recover in the ER, their large t1\/2s might re-\nflect aggregation of the fusion protein; however, there was no \ncorrelation between NE and ER t1\/2s (Fig. 1 B).

The accu-\nmulation of fluorescence in the NE was also calculated for \nNETs photoactivated in the ER to roughly determine the rate of \nmovement from the ER to the NE. In all cases, the PA measure-\nments for ER to NE movement were much smaller (i.e., faster) \nthan those for movement within the NE (Fig. 2 C and Table II). \nThus, much of the fluorescence recovery in the NE FRAP ex-\nperiments likely comes from the protein exchanging between \nthe ER and NE, whereas the dynamics of the measured fluores-\ncence in the NE PA reflects both its redistribution within the NE \nand its loss to the ER.\nNonetheless, the relative contributions of the different \npopulations to measured mobilities cannot be readily distin-\nguished, and so we sought to model the exchange of protein be-\ntween the populations. Another experimental measure needed \nfor this is the mean relative abundance of each NET within the \nINM and ONM, as some of the measured FRAP recovery may \noccur in the ONM. Though all NETs analyzed here target to the \nINM (Senior and Gerace, 1988; Worman et al., 1988; Foisner \nand Gerace, 1993; Smith and Blobel, 1994; Squarzoni et al., \n1998; Hodzic et al., 2004; Malik et al., 2010), their exogenous \nexpression might saturate INM binding sites. Thus, most NET\u2013\nGFP fusions were sampled by immunoelectron microscopy \nusing antibodies to GFP. Though similarly overexpressed, the \nSec61\ue062\u2013GFP fusion protein was almost entirely found in the \nONM and the ER, whereas all NETs preferentially accumulated \nin the INM (Fig. 3).\nAs the majority of each NET accumulated in the INM and \nmost recovery curves reached >80% of the prebleach levels, \nit would be impossible to achieve the measured fluorescence \nrecoveries solely by recovery in the ONM. Therefore, some re-\ncovery must derive from protein newly translocated from the \nER. The significant contribution of the translocation step to \nNET kinetics impacts on our ability to model these data. Because \nof the high complexity of this system, effective modeling could \nonly be attempted on NETs that likely move by free diffusion \nas opposed to those using previously suggested ATP- and \nRan-dependent translocation mechanisms (Ohba et al., 2004; \nKing et al., 2006). Thus, we tested six NETs to determine how \ntheir mobility was affected by depletion of ATP or Ran.\nEmerin and SUN2 mobility requires ATP\nThough ATP and Ran were previously found to be important for \ntranslocation, neither study distinguished if these were separate \nrequirements for different NETs or part of the same complex \ntranslocation mechanism (Ohba et al., 2004; King et al., 2006). \nTo avoid pleiotropic effects of ATP depletion, cells were ana-\nlyzed between 10 and 40 min after the depletion initiation. \nWithin this short time window, no adverse affects of ATP deple-\ntion could be observed. Neither the measured t1\/2s nor the mo-\nbile fraction percentages of NET51, NET55, LAP2, or LBR \nwere affected by ATP depletion (Fig. 4). In contrast, the emerin \nt1\/2 increased from 20.3 to 46.2 s, and its mobile fraction per-\ncentage decreased from 84 to 33% (Fig. 4 A). SUN2 was also \naffected by ATP depletion, with its mobile fraction percentage \nfor NE FRAP dropping to <20%, making the t1\/2 unmeasurable. \nThus, the previously described energy requirement (Ohba et al., \n2004) only applies to a subset of INM proteins.\nTo test if the ATP requirement was caused by charac-\nteristics of the nucleoplasmic\/cytoplasmic domain of emerin, \nthis region (aa 1\u2013224) was moved to the N terminus of NET51 \nand LBR. In both cases, the t1\/2 was increased after ATP deple-\ntion, similar to what was observed for wild-type (WT) emerin \n(Fig. 4 B). Thus, sequences required for the ATP-dependent \nstep are in this region.\nEmerin also has cytoplasmic partners (Cartegni et al., \n1997; Lattanzi et al., 2000; Salpingidou et al., 2007), so its ER \nmobility was also retested with ATP depletion. Indeed, the ER \nmobility was also slower with ATP depletion (Fig. 4 C). Thus, \nthe energy requirement may not pertain to the actual transloca-\ntion step, but instead to a licensing step in the ER.\nLBR requires Ran GTPase for translocation\nThe central channel nuclear transport factor Ran GTPase is \nalso required for transport of two INM proteins in yeast (King \net al., 2006). To test if Ran function is generally required for \nINM proteins, we used the Ran mutant Q69L that cannot hy-\ndrolyze GTP and dominant-negatively inhibits Ran function \nin vivo (Dickmanns et al., 1996; Sillj\u00e9 et al., 2006). Cells were \ncotransfected with NET\u2013GFP constructs and a second plasmid \nencoding both untagged RanQ69L and an RFP reporter driven \nby separate promoters so that cells expressing the Ran mutant \ncould be identified.

Thus, the two \npathways are separate and are not likely to function redundantly \nfor the NETs that were unaffected by either alone.\nFor yeast NETs dependent on Ran, mutation of the single \npredicted NLSs blocked INM accumulation (King et al., 2006). \nSuch an approach was impractical for human LBR because four \nseparate NLSs were predicted using PSORTII (Nakai and Horton, \n1999) so that their combined mutation would likely notably \nby an increase in Ran levels both by immunoblotting and by \nimmunofluorescence staining of matched cultures (Fig. 5 A). \nCells were analyzed 24 h after transfection, at which point they \nwere still healthy as assessed by morphology and membrane \nrefraction, whereas by 2 d, deleterious secondary effects of Ran \nfunctional inhibition were evident. Of the six NETs tested, only \nLBR was affected by coexpression of the Ran mutant, nearly \ndoubling its fluorescence recovery t1\/2 (Fig. 5 B). To test the \npossibility that NETs lacking a Ran effect use both Ran-dependent \nand ATP-dependent pathways redundantly, they were retested \nFigure 3.

Strikingly, LBR \nhas six FG pairs. This amino acid pairing is not common \n(only 1.5% of all human proteins have six or more FGs). \nFGs occur on both Nups and some transport receptors (e.g., \nimportin\/karyopherin-\ue062 with four FGs), and FGreceptor\u2013FGnup \ninteractions have been proposed to facilitate translocation \nthrough the central channel of the NPC (Rexach and Blobel, \n1995), although this has not been experimentally verified. \nMutating all six FGs in LBR would likely disrupt structure, \nso to test a role for FGs, a short sequence of four FGs (under-\nlined) \u201cMFGHTFGFGQSVFG\u201d was fused to the N-terminus \nof NET51 and NET55.

Thus, instead, the first 128 residues of \nLBR that include the three strongest predicted NLSs or the clas-\nsical SV40 NLS (Goldfarb et al., 1986; Wychowski et al., 1986) \nwere fused to three NETs with weak NLSs that had previously \nshown no Ran dependence: emerin, NET51, and NET55. This \nincreased their NLS prediction scores, respectively, from 0.02, \n\ue0320.22, and \ue0320.47 to 1.44, 1.20, and 0.94 for the LBR NLSs \nand 1.76, 1.52, and 1.27 for the SV40 NLS (compared with 1.19 \nfor WT LBR); however, it did not confer Ran dependence in any \ncase (Fig. 5 C).\nAs it was possible that the NET\u2013NLS fusions failed to \nbecome dependent on Ran because they have alternate mecha-\nnisms for INM translocation, an ER-resident protein Sec61\ue062 \nwas also fused to the SV40 NLS. This resulted in its concen-\ntration at the NE and INM (Fig. 5 D) but failed to confer Ran \ndependence for the photobleach recovery as measured by t1\/2  \n(Fig. 5 E). Interestingly, the INM\/ONM ratios of both NLS-\nSec61\ue062 and LBR were not significantly altered by the Ran mu-\ntant (Fig. 5 F). The failure of RanQ69L to accumulate LBR in \nthe ONM despite its doubling of the t1\/2 is likely caused by a \nhigh binding affinity for LBR in the INM (Worman et al., 1988; \nYe and Worman, 1996) and the presence of alternate transloca-\ntion pathways.

As Nup35 depletion in \nvertebrate cells yields no loss in cell viability (Hawryluk-Gara \net al., 2005), NETs were retested in cells depleted for Nup35 \nby siRNA to determine if it contributes to INM translocation \n(Fig. 8 A). Nup35 protein levels were significantly reduced \n(Fig. 8 B), but no significant difference in NET translocation \nwas observed between WT and Nup35-depleted cells except in \nthe case of LBR (P < 0.0003). The fact that most NETs were \nunaffected by Nup35 depletion indicates that the effect on LBR \nis specific and does not result from NPC structural changes that \ncreate a steric block to translocation.\nTo test if the LBR Ran effect is synergistic with the LBR \nNup35 effect, the Nup35 knockdown was tested in combina-\ntion with RanQ69L (Fig. 8 C). Loss of Nup35 increased the t1\/2 \nfor LBR to levels similar to those observed with the RanQ69L \nmutant. The effect on LBR from the combination of Nup35 \ndepletion and Ran inhibition was similar to either alone. Thus, \nthe Ran functional-depletion effect on LBR requires a positive \nfunction of Nup35.\nSeparately, the FG-NET51 was compared with WT NET51 \nin the presence or absence of Nup35 depletion. (FG-NET55 was \nnot tested because NET55 has four FGs without the added \nsequence and so cannot effectively serve as a negative control.) \nThe t1\/2 for WT NET51 was not affected by Nup35 depletion, \nbut the t1\/2 for FG-NET51 was increased significantly (Fig. 8 D). \nThus, Nup35 appears to play separate roles in Ran-mediated \nand FG-mediated INM protein translocation.\nA simple biophysical model for the \ndynamics of NETs\nTo gain more quantitative insight into the relative contribution \nof various processes affecting the mobility of NETs, we sought \nto interpret our experimental data using a simple biophysical \nmodel for NETs that translocate by unaided diffusion (see \nMaterials and methods for details). LAP2, LAP1-L, and NET55 \nwere analyzed because they exhibit a broad range of FRAP \nt1\/2s and appear to be independent of active transport mecha-\nnisms (Table III). An average HeLa nucleus has a volume of \n\ue07a1,000 \u00b5m3, with a corresponding surface area of \ue07a500 \u00b5m2. \nEstimating 2,770 NPCs\/nucleus (Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2001; \nThis finding is particularly intriguing in light of the sig-\nnificant enrichment of FGs in NETs compared with other pro-\nteins. A set of 199 total predicted NETs from a rat liver NE \nproteomics dataset (Schirmer et al., 2003) were compared with \nthe total predicted transmembrane proteins encoded in the rat \ngenome. Because some FGs might be embedded in the lipid \nbilayer, the predicted membrane spans were removed from the \namino acid sequences. The number of remaining FGs was \nthen calculated for each protein and plotted as a percentage of \nthe total proteins in each dataset with the number of FGs \u2265 n \n(Fig. 7 A). As the number of FGs per protein increased on the \nx axis, the enrichment of FGs in NETs compared with general \ntransmembrane proteins increased. When considering trans-\nmembrane proteins with 14 or more FGs, the percentage among \nNETs was >40-fold higher than in the set of transmembrane \nproteins from the whole genome. When comparing NETs to just \nmitochondrial transmembrane proteins (extracted from Mootha \net al., 2003), the NET enrichment in FGs had a P-value of \n4.77 \u00d7 10\ue0325 (Fig. 7 B).\nThe enrichment for FGs is the more striking in its contrast \nwith the lack of predicted NLSs. Nearly 80% of the liver NETs \nhad NLS prediction scores below zero. The median NLS predic-\ntion score among NETs was well below that of the soluble pro-\nteins found in the same liver NE proteomics datasets (Fig. 7 C).\nFinally, analysis of this set of liver NETs supports the hy-\npothesis that INM proteins translocate through the peripheral \nchannels of the NPCs because the size distribution for nucleo-\nplasmic\/cytoplasmic and lumenal amino acid residues revealed \na striking limitation on nucleoplasmic mass below the 60-kD \ncutoff for peripheral channel translocation (Fig. 7 D). In con-\ntrast, lumenal mass covered a wide range with \ue07a25% of NETS \nexceeding the exclusion limit. The few outliers for nucleoplasmic\/ \ncytoplasmic mass are likely ONM proteins or result from \nmispredicted topologies. In contrast to this NET dataset, mito-\nchondrial transmembrane proteins (Mootha et al., 2003) had \nvery similar median values for cytoplasmic\/inner and lumenal\/\nouter mass (Fig. 7 E).\nNup35 facilitates Ran-mediated  \nINM translocation\nThe ability of FGs to decrease FRAP t1\/2s suggested the possi-\nbility that the NETs interact with FG-Nups during translocation. \nFigure 6.

Stringent analysis of ER diffusion is a complex com-\nputational problem because of the 3D structure of cisterns and \ncurved tubes (Sbalzarini et al., 2005, 2006). Nevertheless, its \nspatial ubiquity and compactness enables its simplified treat-\nment as a continuous 2D sheet with no more than twofold \nunderestimation of the true diffusion coefficients (Sbalzarini \net al., 2006). All NET ER diffusion coefficients were found in the \nrange of 0.01\u20130.1 \u00b5m2\/s (see Table III). We next analyzed the \nNE FRAP data. Although model complexity was reduced to \nthe absolute minimum with only four kinetic parameters (NPC \ntranslocation rate, retention trap concentration, and on and off \nbinding rates) in addition to the protein diffusion coefficient, \nwe could fit different sets of parameters when considering just \nMaeshima et al., 2010), the NPCs should be situated \ue07a425 nm \napart. Thus, a freely diffusing protein with the diffusion co-\nefficient \ue07a0.1 \u00b5m2\/s should reach an NPC in <1 s in either the \nONM or INM. Given this negligible time, the model approxi-\nmates NPC translocation as a spatially homogeneous reversible \nfirst-order reaction with identical rates for both directions. As \nLAP1 and LAP2 and many other NETs bind lamins (Senior and \nGerace, 1988; Worman et al., 1988; Foisner and Gerace, 1993; \nClements et al., 2000; Sakaki et al., 2001; Mattout-Drubezki \nand Gruenbaum, 2003; Hodzic et al., 2004; Schirmer and \nFoisner, 2007), we further assumed the existence of immotile bind-\ning sites in the INM that effectively trap the NETs. Under these \nassumptions, a NET can be associated with one of the three NE \npools: (1) free protein in the ONM and ER, (2) free protein in \nthe INM, and (3) protein bound to immobile sites in the INM.\nFigure 7. FGs are enriched in NETs. Analysis of a dataset of 199 predicted NETs identified by proteomics of liver NEs revealed shared characteristics con-\nsistent with the findings described here. A list of mitochondrial proteins separately identified by proteomics served as a control. In all cases, the hypothesis \nthat two sets were different was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to generate listed P-values. These are also given along with D-values in Table S2. \n(A) To determine FG sequences that could potentially interact with Nups, NET sequences minus their predicted transmembrane-spanning segments were \ncompared with all predicted transmembrane proteins coded by the rat genome similarly modified.

The difference in the FRAP dynamics be-\ntween LAP2 and LAP1-L can be accounted for by the different \neffective concentration of binding sites in the INM rather than \nfrom different off-rates. Although we cannot reliably calculate \nthe absolute concentrations of binding sites (they are defined \nin relation to the unknown steady-state concentration of the free \nprotein), this result is consistent with our EM data and earlier \npublished data on the ONM\/INM distribution of LAP1-L (Senior \nand Gerace, 1988) that together indicate a higher preference for \nLAP1-L rather than LAP2 for the INM. Cumulatively, the re-\nsults of our modeling suggest that the observed wide spread of \nFRAP t1\/2s between the proteins unaffected by Ran or ATP de-\npletion can be explained by their different modes of interaction \nin the INM rather than by varied times necessary to traverse the \nNPC, which is consistent with free diffusion.\nthe measured FRAP kinetics. However, combining FRAP and \nPA data allowed us to reliably constrain the two most important \ncharacteristics: the half-lives corresponding to the NPC trans-\nlocation and retention traps. Re-measuring FRAP dynamics \nover longer times provided reliable estimates for the binding \noff-rates (half-life \ue07a0.7\/off-rate). Using these values, the NPC \ntranslocation half-lives were computed from the corresponding \nPA curves. The best fit to the FRAP and PA data were achieved \nwith the NET diffusion coefficients slightly higher than values \ninferred from the ER FRAP data (Table III), which is consistent \nwith previous results (Sbalzarini et al., 2006).\nThis model-based analysis indicated that, despite their \nwidely divergent FRAP t1\/2s, all three NETs possessed similar \nONM\u2013INM translocation times of \ue07a1 min, which is consistent \nwith the existence of an efficient translocation mechanism asso-\nciated with free diffusion through the NPC peripheral channels. \nApart from NET55 that showed only a moderate preference for \nFigure 8.

This is consistent \nwith our results that SUN2 mobility was unaffected by Ran \nfunctional depletion.\nThe striking size limitation observed in larger datasets and \nthe finding that both Ran-dependent and FG-facilitated mecha-\nnisms are affected by Nup35 depletion support the involvement \nof the NPC peripheral channels. Though NPC reconstruction \nsupports a position for yeast Nup35 (Nup53p) internally within \nthe peripheral channels (Alber et al., 2007) while another study \nargues that, in vertebrates, Nup35 binds lamins toward the \nnucleoplasmic face (Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2005), both studies \nare consistent with Nup35 being associated with the peripheral \nrather than central channels. The earlier finding that yeast Nup35 \n(Nup53p) interacts with the import receptor kap121p (Marelli \net al., 1998) is consistent with Nup35 involvement in the Ran-\ndependent mechanism. Although it remains unclear whether FGs \non some transport receptors actually interact with FGs on Nups \nduring translocation, our finding that adding FGs to NET51 \naffected its FRAP mobility in a Nup35-dependent manner is \nconsistent with this hypothesis (Rexach and Blobel, 1995). \nIn this case, FGs on NETs might act as their own transport recep-\ntors. This model is the more attractive because NETs that ap-\nproach the \ue07a60-kD diffusion limit of the peripheral channels \ncould not afford the added mass from a transport receptor, and \nthus such proteins would benefit from being able to directly \ninteract with FG-Nups.\nMaterials and methods\nPlasmid construction\nHuman NETs (or rat LAP1\/2) were cloned into the pEGFP-N vector series \n(Takara Bio Inc.) except for SUN2 in pEGFP-C3 (a gift of D. Hodzic, Wash-\nington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO; Hodzic et al., 2004), \nyielding linkers ranging from 7 to 23 amino acids. Notably, earlier studies \non LBR used a fragment (Ellenberg et al., 1997; Rolls et al., 1999) where \nwe used the entire protein. Also, the two rat splice variants of LAP1 we \ntested (Martin et al., 1995) both differ from the mouse one previously \ntested by FRAP (Goodchild and Dauer, 2005). Sec61\ue062\u2013GFP was a gift of \nT. Rapoport (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, \nBoston, MA). As this study was initiated before we became aware of the \nspecific monomeric GFP, LAP2, NET51, and NET55 were retested using \nthe specific monomeric GFP, yielding no significant differences in results. \nFor photoactivatable constructs, NETs were inserted into pPA-GFP-C1, leav-\ning a linker of 6 aa in all cases (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002). \nPrimers encoding the SV40 NLS \u201cMGTAGTPPKKKRKVEDPG\u201d or the added \nFGs (underlined) \u201cMFGHTFGFGQSVFG\u201d were inserted at the 5\ue039 end of \nfull-length NET51, NET55, and\/or emerin cDNAs in pEGFP-N2.\nTransfection and cell culture\nHeLa cells were grown in DME supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, \n100 U\/ml penicillin, and 100 mg\/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto \n25-mm coverslips in 35-mm dishes and transfected at 20% confluency with \n0.5 \u00b5g of reporter using Fugene HD (Roche).\nPA experiments\nA confocal system (SP5; Leica) equipped with a 60\u00d7 1.4 NA objective lens \nand 405 nm UV laser were used for GFP PA. Cells were cotransfected with \nNET20 fused to mRFP so that the NE and ER could be viewed to determine \nthe region for PA. NET20 was used because it was extractible with Triton \nX-100 and thus unlikely to interact with other NETs or lamina components. \nCells were first placed in a heated chamber in complete DME medium at \n37\u00b0C. Then a region was selected based on the NET20-mRFP, the selected \nregion was photoactivated at 8% laser power, and recovery of fluorescence \nDiscussion\nAlthough existing technologies are insufficient to perfectly re-\nsolve each step in a NET\u2019s journey from its synthesis in the \nER to accumulation in the INM, our systematic analysis of a \nrepresentative panel of NETs has revealed many crucial steps \nand requirements. First, different subsets of NETs have distinct \nrequirements for energy and classical transport proteins (Ohba \net al., 2004; King et al., 2006; Saksena et al., 2006), which are \nindependent of one another. Second, the finding that FGs can \nspeed the half-times of recovery suggests a novel mechanism \nto facilitate the translocation step. Third, the effect of Nup35 \nknockdown on NET mobility and size limitation within the \nlarger set of NETs strengthens earlier studies (Powell and \nBurke, 1990; Soullam and Worman, 1993, 1995) arguing for \ntranslocation through the NPC peripheral channels. Fourth, ex-\npanding on the original lateral diffusion\u2013retention hypothesis, \nNET tethering in the INM is a major contributor to the differ-\nences observed between NET FRAP half-times. The combina-\ntion of FRAP and PA approaches supported by model-based \nanalysis of the resulting data has yielded significant progress in \nresolving the various steps in NET translocation and mobility.\nThe absence of Ran inhibition or ATP depletion effects on \nhalf of the NETs tested here suggests that many NETs translo-\ncate by unregulated lateral diffusion. The rapid NE accumula-\ntion in our ER PA studies and modeling is also consistent with \nthis, as the ONM\u2013INM exchange step had similar kinetics for \nall three NETs. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility \nof additional regulated translocation mechanisms involving dif-\nferent NPC components for other NETs. In yeast, Nup170 was \nrequired for INM accumulation of Heh2 (King et al., 2006), \nwhereas it was not required for INM accumulation of Doa10 \n(Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006). In frogs, a role was found for \nNup188 (Theerthagiri et al., 2010), whereas in human cells, \nantibodies to gp210 blocked NET translocation (Ohba et al., \n2004), and we found that knockdown of Nup35 slowed NET \nmobility. The finding of so many Nups with effects on NET \ntranslocation would be surprising if a specific role for each \nNup was required. More likely it indicates differences in the \nstructure of the NPC between the organisms used or that effects \nare caused by the general disruption of the NPC structure.\nThe dependence of LBR mobility\/translocation on func-\ntional Ran GTPase is consistent with two previous studies indi-\ncating LBR interactions with classical NPC components and a \npossible licensing step (Braunagel et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2007). \nHowever, in contrast to the yeast system, where mutating the \nNET NLSs blocked translocation (King et al., 2006), we find \nthat addition of SV40 or LBR NLSs to other NETs failed to \nconfer Ran dependence. Moreover, several NETs had NLSs \n(Table I) but exhibited no Ran dependence. As many INM pro-\nteins bind chromatin and have basic isoelectric points (Ulbert \net al., 2006), it is possible that these characteristics result in \nerroneous predictions of classical basic NLSs. This tendency \ntoward higher isoelectric points is confirmed from our larger \ncollection of putative and confirmed NETs identified by pro-\nteomics. Another possibility is that the NLSs are redundant \nwith other exchange mechanisms. SUN2 was recently reported \n o\nn\n M\nay 4, 2011\njcb.rupress.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPublished March 28, 2011\n121Transport dynamics of nuclear membrane proteins \u2022 Zuleger et al.\nproteins were extracted from a proteomic study of mouse mitochondria \n(Mootha et al., 2003). Transmembrane segments were removed from NETs \nand the nucleoplasmic and luminal sequences were separated based on \nTMHMM v2.0 predictions of membrane topology (Krogh et al., 2001). \nThe number of amino acid residues and isoelectric points were calculated \nfor these sequences and plotted against one another using open source \nEMBOSS tools (Rice et al., 2000). For counting FGs, the lumenal and \nnucleoplasmic sequences were joined after removing transmembrane seg-\nments because NET FGs could also interact with many FG repeats on the \ntransmembrane Nup gp210 that occurs in the NE lumen. NLS prediction \nscores were generated using PSORTII (Nakai and Horton, 1999).\nComputational modeling of FRAP and PA experiments\nPrevious modeling of diffusion for a mobile cargo in an ER fragment used \na particle-based simulation on a 3D reconstruction of the ER from multiple \nEM sections (Sbalzarini et al., 2005, 2006). Because we had to consider \nthe entire cellular NE and ER, a similar level of detail could not be feasibly \nachieved. Thus, we simplified the model by representing the ER as a continu-\nous sheet in 2D cross-section, with dimensions deduced from our HeLa cell \nimages that were consistent with other measurements (Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, \n2001; Maeshima et al., 2010). This approximation is reasonably accurate \nfor the interpretation of FRAP data, generally resulting in no more than a \ntwofold underestimation of the diffusion coefficient for an integral ER protein \n(Sbalzarini et al., 2006). As this is on par with the typical levels of noise \npresent in experimental data, we considered this approximation sufficient. \nElectron microscopy indicates many points of fusion between the ER and \nONM, thus the kinetics of their protein exchange can be adequately repre-\nsented by 2D diffusion. Considering spatial closeness of the ubiquitous NPCs \n(\ue07a425 nm apart) and the characteristic value of NET diffusion coefficients \n(\ue07a0.1 \u00b5m2\/s), we approximated the kinetics of ONM\u2013INM exchange by \na first-order reaction with kinetic rate k1 independent of translocation direc-\ntion. This assumption allowed us to reduce the double-membrane system to \na single membrane in which freely diffusing proteins (not bound to immo-\nbile binding sites) are given by two distinct species with concentrations PO \nand PI, which stand for the ONM- and INM-localized proteins, respectively. \nFinally, to enable efficient numeric simulation, we represented cellular cross \nsections by a rectangular 2D domain as shown in Fig. S5. In this layout, two \nopposing boundaries with no-flux boundary conditions represent the double \nNE membrane and the plasma membrane, respectively, while the two other \nboundaries with periodic boundary conditions permit free diffusion around \nthe nucleus. The y linear dimension of the domain was selected equal to the \ncircumference of an average HeLa nucleus projection (\ue07a59 \u00b5m) while the \nx dimension was adjusted so that the area of the domain S = x \u00d7 y was equal \nto the area of an average HeLa cell projection (minus the area of the nucleus \nprojection) as estimated from our microscopy data (\ue07a841 \u00b5m2). The slight \nspatial distortion introduced by this transformation can be neglected because \nthe capacity of the ER (represented by the domain area) is preserved. To \ntest the validity of this assumption, we also performed simulations using the \npublic domain modeling platform Virtual Cell (Moraru et al., 2008), which \nallows simulation of diffusion on domains of arbitrary shape. Comparison \nof the FRAP and PA curves computed using the two different computational \nrealizations of the model demonstrated virtually no differences, which sup-\nports the validity of our last assumption.\nTo model dynamics in the INM, we assumed the existence of a single \ntype of immobile binding site (trap) with total concentration T0. Thus, in ad-\ndition to the PO and PI freely diffusing pools, there is the PT-bound pool. The \nspatio-temporal dynamics of the system can then be described by four \nreaction\u2013diffusion equations based on the mass-action rate law as follows:\n\t\n\u00b6 \u00b6 = - + \u00b6 \u00b6\n\u00b6 \u00b6 = - + - + \u00b6 \u00b6-\nP t k P k P D P r\nP t k P k P k P k P T D P\nO I O O\nI O I T I I\n1 1\n2 2\n1 1 2 2\n2 r\nP t k P T k P\nT t k P k P T\nT I T\nT I\n2\n2 2\n2 2\n\u00b6 \u00b6 = -\n\u00b6 \u00b6 = -\n-\n- ,\n\t\nwhere T is the concentration of unoccupied binding sites, k1 is the NPC \ntranslocation rate, k2 and k-2 are the on- and off-rates of binding to the im-\nmobile binding sites, and D is the protein diffusion coefficient. Before \nbleaching or PA, the system is in the steady-state, therefore concentrations \nof the freely diffusing protein fractions are equilibrated across the ER, \nONM, and INM; i.e., PER = PI = PO. At the same time:\n\t P k k P T\nT P T\nT I\nT\n=\n+ =\n-2 2\n0.\n\t\nwas measured by scanning the whole cell at low power every 10 s. Experi-\nments for calculating diffusion coefficients were performed using similarly \nsized regions for the activation in the ER. For activation in the NE, a region \nrepresenting 30\u201350% of the circumference of the nuclear rim was carefully \nmarked so as to minimize any coactivation in the ER. Data were collected \nusing the SP5 FRAP application suite (Leica). Data were then processed \nwith Image-Pro Plus Analyzer 7 (Media Cybernetics).\nFRAP experiments\nAll FRAP experiments for regular EGFP constructs were performed on a \nwide-field DeltaVision microscope (Applied Precision; IX70 microscope \n[Olympus] and CoolSNAP HQ camera [Photometrics]) with an attached \n488 nm laser using a 60\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat oil 1.4 NA objective lens. \nHeLa cells were analyzed at 15\u201320 h after transfection unless otherwise \nstated using a 37\u00b0C heated chamber with complete DME medium contain-\ning 25 mM Hepes-KOH. Five prebleach images were taken followed by \nbleaching a spot of 5.7 \u00b5m2 for 1 s at full laser intensity so that between \n20 and 40% fluorescence intensity was retained. Fluorescence recovery \nwas measured every 3.5 s. Data were collected using the SoftWoRx soft-\nware v. 3.5 and processed with Image-Pro Plus Analyzer 6 (Media Cyber-\nnetics). Intensity measurements and t1\/2 calculations were made using a \nmacro written in Visual Basic within Image Pro according to Phair and \nMisteli (2001). In brief, a region of interest was applied to the whole cell, \nthe bleach area, and the background. The region of interest was applied \nto each frame in the FRAP sequence, automatically correcting for photo-\nbleaching compared with five prebleach images. Movement of the bleach \narea because of cell movement was corrected by applying any change in \nthe center xy position of the whole cell to the position of the bleach area. \nAny cell exhibiting rotational changes of position was discarded or mea-\nsured manually. The t1\/2s were calculated using normalized fluorescence \nvalues, setting the immediate postbleach value to zero and the mean of the \nlast 10 points of the recovery curves to 100.\nImmunoelectron microscopy\nImmunoelectron microscopy was performed on HeLa cells transiently trans-\nfected with different NETs fused to GFP. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformal-\ndehyde, pelleted, and infiltrated with 2.3 M sucrose, then frozen by plunging \ninto liquid nitrogen. Frozen pellets were sectioned on a cryo-ultramicrotome \n(UC6 with FC6 cryo-attachment; Leica). Cryosections were thawed, rinsed \nin PBS with 1% glycine, incubated in PBS with 1% BSA, incubated with \nrabbit anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) at 1:400 dilution, and rinsed in PBS, \nthen incubated with the secondary anti\u2013rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to \n5 nm colloidal gold (Agar Scientific). Grids were then rinsed in PBS, trans-\nferred to 1% glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific) in PBS, washed in water, and \nembedded in 2% methyl cellulose containing 0.4% uranyl acetate (Agar \nScientific). Images were taken on an electron microscope (H7600; Hitachi) \nat 100 kV and at a magnification of 80,000\u2013100,000.\nNup35 knockdown with siRNA\nKnockdown of Nup35 was effected using an oligo (Eurogentec) designed to \ntarget 5\ue039-UGCCCAGUUCUUACCUGGA-3\ue039 of the human Nup35 mRNA. \nCells were used for experiments 48\u201360 h after nucleofection of 7 \u00b5g of the \noligo per million cells using kit R (Lonza). Polyclonal antibodies to detect \nNup35 protein were obtained from Tebu-bio (157H00129401-B01).\nATP depletion experiments\nATP depletion experiments were performed as in Ohba et al. (2004). \nIn brief, 10 min before FRAP analysis, the medium was changed to glucose-\nfree medium containing 10 mM sodium azide, 6 mM 2-deoxyglucose, \n25 mM Hepes-KOH, and 10% FBS. Cells were discarded after 40 min \nto reduce the possibility of secondary effects of ATP depletion influencing \nFRAP results.\nRan depletion experiments\nTo inhibit Ran function, a plasmid was constructed carrying the untagged \nhuman Ran gene containing the Q69L mutation behind the cytomegalovi-\nrus (CMV) promoter and separately expressing monomeric RFP (Campbell \net al., 2002) driven by a separate CMV promoter. This construct was co-\ntransfected with NET\u2013GFP fusions and cells were analyzed after 24 h. The \nincrease in Ran levels was confirmed with purified mouse monoclonal anti\u2013\nhuman Ran antibody 610341 (BD).\nBioinformatic analysis\nPredicted NETs and soluble proteins were extracted from rodent liver NE \nproteomic datasets (Schirmer et al., 2003). The NET dataset included 199 \nnovel and previously characterized transmembrane proteins.

Assuming that the value of \ue061 is given, the total \nconcentration of traps, T0, can then be expressed from the last two equa-\ntions as a function of the parameter K2 and the steady-state concentration \nP0 as simply:\n\t T K P\nK\nO\n0\n2\n2\n1 1= - \u00d7 +a\na\n. \t\nNote that because both FRAP and PA data are expressed in non-\ndimensional relative units, the unknown absolute value P0 is irrelevant and \ncan be chosen to be any arbitrary value suitable for numeric simulations \n(e.g., 10 \u00b5M in our simulations). Therefore, with the value of \ue061 fixed, the \ntotal number of free model parameters to be found from fitting to the experi-\nmental data are reduced to only four, namely, the diffusion coefficient D \nand the three reaction rates k1, k2, and k\ue0322.\nTo model FRAP and PA, we introduced variables representing \nbleached\/activated counterparts of PO, PI, and PT. Initial conditions were \nchosen to match the spatial masks in the FRAP\/PA experiments, and the \nspatio-temporal evolution of the system was calculated numerically using a \nstandard finite difference method implemented as a custom C code. Com-\nputed FRAP and PA curves were then fitted to the experimental data using \nthe standard least mean squares procedure. We found that even after gross \nsimplifications of the model introduced in this study, the available data did \nnot fully constrain all the parameters. Thus, in the case of strong trapping, \nthe on-rate of binding is essentially irrelevant as far as K2 1\ue03f  and, there-\nfore, cannot be inferred from the available data. This parameter, however, \nis not significant, as it does not affect the observed system dynamics. In-\nstead, we chose to concentrate on the parameters k1 and k\ue0322, which are \ninversely proportional to the characteristic half-life times of the NPC trans-\nlocation and trapping by binding in the INM, respectively. As these param-\neters determine the long-term kinetics of FRAP and PA, we were able to \nestimate them with the accuracy commensurate with that of our experimen-\ntal measurements.\nOnline supplemental material\nFig. S1 shows NE and ER FRAP for all NETs Fig. S2 shows the relation-\nship between t1\/2s and mobile fractions.
