Introduction \n Microfluidic systems have gained increasing interest in the past few years, especially in \nchemical and biomedical applications, because these systems have potential as easy-to-use, cost-\nefficient devices that can perform complex tasks. The market volume of microfluidic systems is \nforecast to grow from approximately US$600 million in 2006 to US$1.9 billion by 2012 [1]. \nConsiderable developments have been made in the manufacture of miniaturized microfluidic \ndevices ranging from simple microfluidic chips up to multifunctional integrated systems, such as \nlab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, also known as micro-Total Analysis Systems (\u03bcTAS). \n Integrated microfluidic devices have been tested for a wide range of applications and have \nshowed high potential for applications such as point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, where rapid \nclinical tests can be performed with relatively easy handling of samples and minimum volumes of \nreagents. Relatively simple microfluidic systems are currently being produced on a commercial \nscale using micromoulding techniques. ThinXXS [2], Micralyne [3], Bartels Microtechnik [4], \nAbbott [5] and Microfluidic ChipShop [6] are a few examples, and their products are mostly used \nfor biomedical and POC applications. Integrated and relatively complex microfluidic systems, \nhowever, are not yet commercially used on a large scale, because the relatively high fabrication \ncosts do not allow for an economical mass-production process. In addition, the complexity of some \nsystems prevents them from being developed beyond lab-based prototyping to the stage where \nthey become suitable for commercial use, especially by non-experts [7]. \n This review paper presents integration solutions proposed in the literature for microfluidic \ndevices manufactured by high-volume polymer replication processes, namely micro-injection \nmoulding and hot-embossing. The paper focuses on mass-production replication technologies, \nbecause they provide a potential for low-cost manufacturing solutions necessary for wider \ncommercialization of integrated microfluidics. This would particularly help in producing low-cost \ndisposable systems usually required in, for example, home health care, developing-country health \ncare  and medical analysis microfluidics in general, where cross-contamination should be avoided \n[8-10]. Thermoplastics offer a great potential for producing integrated microfluidics. They are \nalready being processed commercially at low-cost and fewer manufacturing steps, relative to glass \nand silicon [11-17]. In addition, the large number of thermoplastics currently available offer a \nwide range of properties for different microfluidic applications [8,9,14,17,18]. Also, a number of \n 2 \nintegration techniques have been successfully tested for replication processes at the micro scale \nincluding for example, overmoulding and insert moulding [19,20]. \n The structure of the paper is made to highlight the relation between the function of the \nintegrated elements and the available integration\/manufacturing techniques. The paper aims firstly \nto review the currently used device elements, categorized into a taxonomy based on their \nfunctions. Secondly, the paper aims to identify current potential challenges in developing \nintegrated microfluidics, produced by cost-efficient processes that are directly transferable to \nindustry. \n This review concludes with an evaluation of the progress made in integrated microfluidic \ndevices produced by polymer replication techniques in the light of the literature covered within \nthis review. Possible research gaps and potential research areas will be highlighted. \n Reviews of several areas, complimentary to the subject of this review paper, can be found \nin the literature. Gravesen et. al, presented an introductory review of the early stages of \nmicrofluidic developments with some examples of basic operations, such as microvalves and \nmicro-pumps [21]. At this stage, integration and mass-production were still presented as potential \ndevelopments. By the year 2000, polymers had shown great potential for microfluidics, and since \nthen several reviews have covered the relation between polymer properties and microfluidic \nfunctions [17,22]. Microfabrication of polymers has also gained special interest in several reviews \n[23-25] including the microfabrication of polymeric microfluidics by micro-injection moulding \n[26]. More focus has also been directed towards integrated systems, such as lab-on-a-chip and \nmicro Total Analysis Systems [24,27,28] and comparing different materials and production \ntechniques [29,30]. In addition, the disposability of microfluidic devices has also been reviewed \n[31] with focus on minimally instrumented diagnostic devices [10]. Regarding applications of \nmicrofluidic devices, some reviews are available which discuss applications from a general \nperspective [32], whereas other reviews focus on specific applications of microfluidic devices, \nsuch as DNA analysis [33] and amplification [34]. \n1.1. Integrated microfluidic devices \nMicrofluidic devices can be identified as having one or more channels with at least one dimension \nless than 1 mm [11]. The flow conditions are mostly laminar and rarely turbulent [35]. Integrated \nmicrofluidic chips are often referred to as \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d (LOC) devices or micro Total Analysis \n 3 \nSystem (\u00b5TAS), because they are designed to perform integrated functions of typical analysis labs. \nThey usually perform standard operations, such as sample preparation, flow control, \nreaction\/mixing, separation and detection [22]. The fluids used depend on the application, but they \nare usually related to biotechnological applications and hence examples include whole blood or \nblood components, bacterial cell suspensions and protein or antibody solutions. \n A considerable number of microfluidic devices have been discussed in the literature in \nterms of design, fabrication and testing. However, the majority of such devices are simple in \nstructure, i.e. containing single functions, and used for laboratory prototyping. There is an \nincreasing need for more complex and integrated systems for a set of reasons: \n1) To be able to perform a series of laboratory processes such as sample preparation, fluid \nhandling, reaction, analysis and detection on a single device [36]. \n2) To achieve automation and high processing speed [8,12,37,38]. \n3)  To be able to use the new technology within the physical limits of the existing lab \nequipment, for example standard holding frames and fluid-delivery systems [39]. \n4) To produce easy-to-use cost-efficient devices that can perform complex laboratory \nanalyses. This is especially important for, for example, point-of-care applications, lab-on-a-\nchip and \u03bcTAS systems. Integration allows for rapid clinical diagnosis tests, easy usage \nwithout complex fluid handling, fewer costly reagents, smaller sample volumes, and shorter \nassay turnaround systems. In addition, such systems eliminate the often slow, complex and \ncostly preparation techniques of conventional clinical laboratories, such as centrifugal \ntechniques and membrane filtration [8,13,37,38,40-45]. \n5) To give the microfluidic device the ability to interact with electronic, magnetic, optic and \nchemical methods to have a chip with broad capabilities [41]. \n6) To connect microfluidic devices to the outer world by using micro-to-macro interfaces such \nthat an efficient system is obtained [41]. \n7) To allow for the production of disposable and portable miniaturized devices with \npotentially low manufacturing costs [12,38,45]. \n Considerable progress has been achieved in mass-producing relatively simple \nmicrofluidic devices. However, similar progress has not yet been achieved for integrated systems, \ni.e. microfluidic systems that are a combination of the basic, fluid-handling elements of \nmicrofluidic chips with other functional units to perform more complex analytical tasks [41]. A \n 4 \nnumber of reasons have been suggested for this lag in mass-production options for integration. For \nexample, microfluidic devices are often made only for prototyping purposes; so many projects \nwere intended solely for research, not taking into consideration the potentially high costs of \ncommercializing the developed systems. [46,47]. In addition, there are relatively high additional \ncosts for the currently established techniques of insertion of required functional elements and of \ndevice encapsulation [18,46]. It has also taken a longer time than estimated for new technologies \nto successfully compete with an existing, well-established, macro-scale technology [39]. \n1.2. Review methodology \n This paper aims to review the literature from the perspective of progress achieved towards \nthe manufacture of high volume, integrated microfluidic devices via cost-efficient processes. In \nthis regard, micro-injection moulding and hot-embossing were chosen as the replication processes \ncovered in this review. This is because they are commonly used, high-volume, cost-efficient \nprocesses. They both have relatively short cycle times, although it should be noted that the cycle \ntime for hot embossing (few minutes to 10 minutes) is generally longer than that for micro-\ninjection moulding (between seconds and minutes). In addition, both processes are similar in terms \nof polymeric materials used. \n Within the context of manufacture by these potential high volume production routes, the \nreview discusses the integration of elements of a microfluidic device.  For the purposes of this \nreview, these elements are classified according to their functions, where the selected definition of a \n\u201cfunction\u201d is any mechanism of transformation from one basic \u201econstituent,\u201f to another, in \nresponse to environmental stimuli [48]. The three basic \u201econstituents\u201f are defined as, mass (M), \nenergy (E), or information (I). In this definition, a function is neither the designed purpose of an \nelement, nor the affect of the element on the environment.  Instead it is a transformation \nmechanism [49]. The aim of using this classification system is allow comparison of the state of the \nart of integration at a fundamental level.  This definition results in a set of 9 functions based on the \ntype of input and output constituents as shown in Table 1: \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n Outputs \nM E I \nIn\np\nu\nts\n \nM \nTo move: \ne.g. motion of one \ngear causes \nanother gear to \nmove. \nTo power: \ne.g. burning fuel \ngives off energy. \nTo activate: \ne.g. closing a \nswitch sends a \nsignal. \nE \nTo energize: \ne.g. the volume of \na heated fluid \nincreases. \nTo convert: \ne.g. a wire \ncarrying a current \nradiates heat \nTo detect: \ne.g. a photocell \nresponds to light \nwith a signal. \nI \nTo actuate: \ne.g. controller \nsignal a robot to \nmove. \nTo regulate: \ne.g. amplifier \noutput is \ncontrolled by \nreceived signal. \nTo transfer: \ne.g. digital to \nanalog conversion. \nTable 1: Types of transformation functions [48] \n \n For the purposes of this review, some of these classifications were considered too broad.  \nFor example, the \u201cmass to mass\u201d transformation function is described in Table 1 as a motion \nfunction \u201cto move\u201d, whereas mass-to-mass functions can take different forms such as \u201cto store\u201d, \n\u201cto regulate\u201d, \u201cto mix\u201d, etc. These forms are referred to here as \u201cfunction descriptors\u201d and are used \nas classifiers in the review. \n As a second classification, functional elements in micro-fluidic devices are also classified \nin this review into integrated or non-integrated elements. Integrated elements are defined as \nelements manufactured as a part of the microfluidic chip, regardless of whether they are fabricated \nwithin the micromoulding process itself or added afterwards in a post-moulding process. Non-\nintegrated elements are those external to the microfluidic chip, and therefore generally are those \nwhich are, in practise, non-disposable and high in cost. \n The complete classification scheme adopted in the review is tabulated in Table 2. The \nfirst four columns detail the classification scheme, showing transformation function, input, output \nand \u201cfunction descriptor.\u201d The fifth column lists categories of microfluidic functional elements \nwhich have a particular transformation function. Columns six and seven describe the techniques, \nnoted in the literature, by which these device elements can be integrated into microfluidic devices, \neither by micromoulding or hot embossing (column 6) or by post-processing (column 7).  Columns \n8 and 9 describe the techniques by which transformation functions are achieved by functional \nelements as yet not integrated onto microfluidic chips. Column 8 is allocated for elements \n 6 \nassociated with the input functions to the chip (e.g. fluid delivery), whereas column 9 is allocated \nfor output functions (e.g. detection and analysis). \n The remainder of this review follows the structure of Table 2.  Techniques for achieving \nintegrated transformation functions are reviewed in Section II.  Section III reviews the literature \nfor non-integrated transformation functions of micromoulded devices. \n \n 7 \nTrans-\nformation \nFunctions \nInput Output \nFunction \nDescriptor \nElements \nHow element are integrated Non-integrated \nMicromoulded \n(Injection or embossing) \nPost-processed \nChip-input \nelements \nChip-output \nelements \nM \u2192 M fluid fluid \nto connect\/ \ndeliver \n\uf09f Fluid connection \nelements \nInterconnects are moulded with \nthe chip (2.1.1.1): \n- Moulded ports. \n- Capillary features are replicated to \ndeliver the fluid to the chip. \nInterconnects are added in post-\nmoulding steps (2.1.1.2): \nE.g. commercial ports, drilled holes \nwith glued tubes, removable silicon \nadapters, etc. \n- - \nto move, to \nstore, to mix \nto divide, to \nregulate, \netc. \n\uf09f Fluid \nmanipulation \nelements \nFeatures are machined in the \nmould and replicated directly on \na single chip (2.1.2.1): \n- E.g. channels, reservoirs, mixers, \ndispensers, passive\/capillary valves, \netc. \nPost-processing is needed after \nreplication (2.1.2.2): \nE.g. stacked and bonded, fixed as a \nmodule on a standard frame,, etc. \n- - \nto contain \uf09f Sealing elements \nSealing takes place during \nmoulding (2.1.3.1): \n- E.g. \u201cin-line\u201d sealing. \nSealing is done after moulding \n(2.1.3.2): \nE.g. bonding, adhesives, etc. \n- - \nM \u2192 E - - - - - - - - \nM \u2192 I - - - - - - - - \nE \u2192 M \nEnergy\/ \nforce \nfluid to move \n\uf09f Fluid delivery \nelements. \n- A miniaturized source of energy \nis added to the moulded chip \n(2.2.1): \n- E.g.

Integrating Functional Elements in Micromoulded 1 \nMicrofluidics 2 \n Integration in polymer processing represents the ability to combine different functional 3 \nelements on a polymer chip. This can directly be done during the fabrication of the chip, such as in 4 \nthe case of ducts and passive valves. Integration can also be carried out after the production of the 5 \nplastic chip, particularly if it is difficult to achieve integration in-process, owing to limitations in 6 \nthe replication process. In this case, post processes, sometimes called back-end processes [35], are 7 \napplied. 8 \n This section reviews the current situation of integrated elements for polymer-based, 9 \nreplicated microfluidic devices. Sections 2.1 to 2.4 present integrated elements currently reported 10 \nin the literature. Following the sequence shown in the first column of Table 2, each section 11 \ndiscusses one category of transformation function. For each functional category, sub-sections will 12 \ncompare integration by micromoulding or hot embossing to integration by post-processing. For 13 \nease of reference, in Table 2 the different categories of transformation function are marked with 14 \nthe corresponding section numbers of the review. 15 \n2.1. Integrated elements involving mass-to-mass transformation 16 \nfunctions 17 \n Section 2.1 presents the main microfluidic components that perform mass-to-mass 18 \nfunctions. They include fluid delivery and fluid manipulation elements, in addition to sealing. 19 \n2.1.1. Fluid connection elements 20 \n Delivering fluids to a microfluidic chip (or taking them out after processing) requires an 21 \ninterconnection system that allows for a secure and easy-to-plug input and output system. The 22 \ninteraction between the micro and macro world affects the efficiency of the microfluidic systems 23 \n[41]. In fact, one of the main obstacles that prevents microfluidics from spreading further 24 \ncommercially is the lack of standard interconnects for interfacing the macro-scale environment 25 \nwith the microfluidic channels within the chip [50]. 26 \n Some requirements for an ideal interconnection system have been mentioned in the 27 \nliterature such as being leak-proof for fluids and gases, possessing minimal dead volume, ease of 28 \n9 \nuse, standard geometry to facilitate interfacing with commercially available devices, reversibility, 1 \nreliability, lack of contamination and ease of fabrication [36,50]. 2 \n As an alternative to conventional interconnection, capillary systems are also used in some 3 \napplications to deliver the fluid sample to the device. The physical phenomena on which they 4 \ndepend are governed by a relationship between surface tension, fluid density, contact angle and the 5 \nchannel size.  Therefore, they require the design of the inlet channels to the optimum dimensions 6 \nin order to deliver the fluid inside the microfluidic chip. Examples are reviewed in the next 7 \nsection. 8 \n2.1.1.1. Fluid connection elements produced by micromoulding 9 \n Mounting interconnections by post-processing (discussed in the next section) is the 10 \ncommonly used method for most prototypes. There is, nevertheless, an increasing trend towards 11 \nproducing interconnection systems as an integrated part of the moulded chip. An example of 12 \nmicromoulded interconnections has been reported, where a micro-injection moulded chip was 13 \nsealed by a plastic lid in which connection ports were integrated as one part [50]. The ports are 14 \nmade of a hollow boss with ANSI standard internal 6-32 threads located at each fluid entry point. 15 \nThe use of micro-injection moulding makes the cycle time almost independent of the number of 16 \nports. Tube fittings were fitted in a later stage. 17 \n Moulded ports were also produced by injection moulding using moving mould-inserts 18 \nthat are shaped like pillars and can be adjusted in length to determine the final depth of the 19 \nmoulded connection port [51]. 20 \n As mentioned earlier, capillary actions can be used as an alternative fluid-delivery system 21 \nfor interconnects. In an injection-moulded device for monitoring DNA migration, capillary action 22 \nmade the polymer fluid spread in the system, and the subsequent gentle centrifugation flushed the 23 \nchannels [52]. In a similar experiment, a hot-embossed microfluidic device for analysing human 24 \nsweat applied a propulsion system in which the device was set to collect 600 \u00b5l of sweat from 25 \nhuman body using capillary action. Afterwards, centrifugation was used to spin the sample out into 26 \nan analytical container. The sample was finally collected by centrifugation in a standard bench-top 27 \nswing-bucket centrifuge modified to accommodate the device [44]. 28 \n2.1.1.2. Fluid connection elements produced by post-processing 29 \n Several post-processing connection techniques were mentioned in the literature. For 30 \nexample, access ports were used to connect modular chips together within a frame [41] (more 31 \n10 \ndetails about modular designs in section 2.1.2.2). For connecting the chips to the outer world, Luer 1 \nand Luer-Lok fittings were used, which have gluing edges allowing them to adhere on to the lid 2 \nsurface [39]. Nanoports produced by Upchurch Scientific are commercial examples [53]. 3 \n In another modular device, where chips were laminated together, a special layer dedicated 4 \nto connecting the system to the outside world was used. It had a standard format irrespective of the 5 \nother layers, possessing interface connectors to liquids and electrical\/electronics. It also formed the 6 \nmechanical basis for alignment of the subsequent layers [41]. Self-aligning microfluidic 7 \ninterconnects were also designed and tested for polymer microfluidics that are produced by micro-8 \ninjection moulding or hot-embossing [54]. 9 \n For some microfluidic devices, holes are manually drilled in the lid to fit the connection 10 \ntubes, which are typically connected with glue [40,50,55,56]. In other devices, Luer-Lock syringes 11 \nwere used both as a fluid propulsion system and connection system [57]. Since most devices are 12 \nproduced for prototyping purposes, fluid delivery is usually achieved by manual delivery with 13 \nsyringes or pipettes or with syringe-pumps when flow-rate is an important consideration (section 14 \n3.1 for non-integrated methods). Removable silicon adapters were used to connect standard pipette 15 \ntips into an injection moulded microfluidic chip [58]. 16 \n Overmoulding was recently tested as a mass-production technique for both packaging and 17 \nfluidic interconnection [19,59]. The method was applied as a generic interconnection system for 18 \nmicrofluidic devices and also for post-packaging of a specific commercial pressure sensor module. 19 \nThis technique provides leak-proof connection between the chip and the fluid-delivery system. 20 \nHowever, it requires an extra manufacturing steps in which a chip, with features already produced 21 \nby a prior process step, is inserted in a special mould and overmoulded by the selected polymer. 22 \n2.1.2. Fluid manipulation elements 23 \n In medical diagnostics, as a common example for microfluidic applications, complex 24 \nbodily fluids (e.g. blood) need to undergo a set of preparation steps before being suitable for 25 \nanalysis. Most of the currently demonstrated microfluidic device components pursue single 26 \nfunctionality and use, for example, purified DNA as an input sample. Therefore, in the majority of 27 \nthe cases, sample preparation is still performed off-chip [43]. If real samples of bodily fluids are to 28 \nbe inserted directly to the device, e.g. in POC applications, the device has to perform several steps 29 \nin a single integrated microfluidic system. 30 \n11 \n2.1.2.1. Micromoulded fluid manipulation elements 1 \n Mass-production of integrated subsystems by replication has the advantages of 2 \nminimizing the cycle time, avoiding post-processing assembly, eliminating opportunities for fluid 3 \nleakage between different microfluidic stages and reducing fabrication costs. Nevertheless, this 4 \nmethod does not have the flexibility of changing the microfluidic feature-shapes or sequences after 5 \nmanufacturing, because this requires the fabrication of a whole new insert. In addition, it is 6 \ncurrently limited mostly to \u201cflat\u201d, 2\u00bdD geometries in order to facilitate part demouldability. 7 \n An example for fully integrated circuits is a microfluidic device used for blood typing 8 \n[60]. The disposable chip, which was micro-injection moulded of COC, comprised a number of 9 \nfluid-manipulation steps, including flow splitting microchannels, chaotic micromixers, reaction 10 \nmicrochambers and detection microfilters. The flow splitter divided the blood sample into four 11 \nequal amounts, so that several agglutination tests could be performed in parallel, whereas the 12 \nserpentine laminating micromixer was used to promote efficiency of reactions. The large reaction 13 \nchambers were introduced to hold the reactant during the reaction time before filtering. Finally, the 14 \nmicrofilters are used to effectively filter the reacted agglutinated red blood cells. 15 \n Another attempt to integrate several circuits on a single plastic chip was presented in the 16 \nform of a PMMA CD-like platform [18,61]. Functions integrated included flow sequencing, 17 \ncascade micro-mixing, and capillary metering. 18 \n In another example, an integrated microfluidic device was fabricated by hot-embossing 19 \npolycyclic olefin. The device was for bacterial detection, and it integrated PCR, valving and 20 \nelectrophoresis on a single plastic chip [45]. Also, a microfluidic device containing a cross-21 \njunction channel was used to produce micro-sized beads of Calcium Alginate [55]. The CD-like 22 \ndevice was produced by injection moulding PC, and by changing the flow rates of the inputs, the 23 \ncross-junction was used to produce beads of 20-50 \u00b5m in diameter with narrow size distribution 24 \n(<10% variation in diameter). Micro-injection moulding was also used to produce an integrated 25 \ndisposable microfluidic device for detection of agglutination. The device which was moulded of 26 \nCOC included micro-wells, passive micro-valves and a serpentine micro-mixer [62]. All features 27 \nwere replicated from a nickel mould insert and the device layers were thermally bonded. 28 \n Flow control elements, such as valves and dispensers, are usually an essential fluid 29 \nmanipulation element in microfluidic systems. Two main fluid control systems are usually 30 \navailable for microfluidic applications: passive and active. Passive valves operate without the need 31 \n12 \nfor physical actuation, by utilizing energy from the flow and are typically used as check valves 1 \n[63,64]. Active valves require more sophisticated control systems involving, for example, 2 \nactuation, which means that multiple inputs, namely mass and information\/energy, are involved 3 \n[63,64]. 4 \n More attention has been recently directed towards passive fluid control systems, such as 5 \npassive valves, mixers, diffusion-based extractors, passive filters and membranes. Passive systems 6 \nhave several advantages, including the need for no external power requirement (mass-to-mass 7 \nfunction), ease of integration, continuity in substrate material, low cost and, by definition, 8 \npossibility of use without active control. Nevertheless, some challenges still face passive systems. 9 \nThey are usually application specific and cannot be easily reconfigured. They are strongly 10 \ndependent on variances in the fabrication process (as will be shown next section) and not suitable 11 \nfor several fluidic mediums [42]. 12 \n Several types of passive vales have been fabricated and tested. Mechanical valves, such as 13 \nflap or membrane check valves, and non-mechanical valves, such as capillary valves, have been 14 \nused for microfluidic devices [65]. 15 \n The advantages of the passive control systems make them a preferable system for flow 16 \ncontrol, especially for plastic chips produced by replication techniques, because no back-end 17 \nprocesses are needed. For example, in the microfluidic CD platform presented earlier, which was 18 \nproduced by both injection-moulding and hot-embossing [61], a passive capillary-valve that relies 19 \non the capillary force to stop the flow in micro-channels, was used [18]. The principle of operation 20 \nwas based on a \u201cpressure barrier\u201d that develops when the cross-section of the capillary expands 21 \nabruptly. The fluid moves through this valve when the capillary forces are overcome by the 22 \ncentrifugation forces. 23 \n Passive valving was also applied in a microfluidic device for point-of-care clinical 24 \ndiagnostics [42]. In this device, a special sequence of flow was required in the microchannels, so 25 \nthe flow was controlled using a so-called \u201cstructurally programmable\u201d microfluidic system 26 \n(sPROMs). sPROMs technology allows fluids to move through a set of valves in designed stages 27 \nwith only an on-chip pressure source. It consists of passive valves and flow conduits, which have 28 \ndifferent pressure drops depending on the structure and surface properties of the fluidic path [66].  29 \n Other types of passive systems can also be found in a variety of fluid handling 30 \napplications. Capillary metering, for example, is used for delivering precisely metered fluids from 31 \n13 \none reservoir to another in a controlled sequence. Bubble snap-off is one technique that has been 1 \npresented in the literature for sample metering [18]. Here, a gas bubble in the liquid-gas flow 2 \npasses through a constriction and breaks up into a number of equally-spaced small bubbles. 3 \nAlthough metering is not a valving technique, it is still a passive flow-manipulation technique that 4 \nis dependent on the same principles of geometry change and fluid-surface interaction. 5 \n This mechanism can be used in sample metering of microfluidic systems, because a fixed 6 \namount of liquid is trapped between two bubbles that are snapped off. 7 \n Other fluid control elements have been also tested, such as micro-dispensers in which 8 \nsample fluid volumes were loaded into a fixed volume micro-dispenser, which in turn dispensed 9 \nan exact volume of liquid for further biochemical analysis. This was done by designing the 10 \ngeometry of the chamber to contain a specific volume of the liquid between inlet and outlet valves. 11 \nWhen the pressure source is released, the metered volume is pushed through the outlet passive 12 \nvalve [42]. 13 \n As shown in the previous examples, passive fluid-control systems, including valves and 14 \ndispensers, are a promising technique for fluid manipulation in microfluidic devices. Considering 15 \nthat such systems do not need external actuation or feedback, and that they are readily 16 \nmanufactured as an integrated feature of the substrate, this makes them practical solutions for on-17 \nline fluid control systems. The operation principles of the systems are similar, in that they depend 18 \non the geometry of the valve (hydrodynamic radius), the fluid properties (viscosity) and the 19 \ninteraction between the fluid and the surface (contact angle and surface tension). Their relative 20 \nsimplicity of principles of operation makes them easy to integrate into devices produced by high-21 \nvolume replication techniques, as their operation depends primarily on the existence of abrupt 22 \nchange in the geometry of a channel. As the market demand increases for cost-efficient complex 23 \nsystems, more attention is expected to be directed towards passive control systems. 24 \n A recently introduced concept of passive fluid control systems is the so-called \"lotus 25 \nsurfaces\", where sub-\u03bcm structures were directly replicated into microfluidic surfaces by hot-26 \nembossing [67]. The replicated surfaces had structural gradient that generated driving forces to 27 \nmove liquids in microfluidic channels. 28 \n2.1.2.2. Post-processed fluid-manipulation elements 29 \n Connecting separate subsystems has been widely used in prototyping microfluidic 30 \ndevices. This is due to the flexibility this allows for modifying of the overall device design. 31 \n14 \nFurthermore, separate chips can be integrated in standard laboratory equipment, or they allow, by 1 \nstacking 2.5D chips for example, for 3D designs to be realized. 2 \n Several connection techniques have been described in the literature. Stacking, for 3 \nexample, is one well-known technique. In a published experiment, a modular design concept with 4 \nstandard interfaces between each functional module was introduced to present a 5 \nchemiluminescence experiment [41]. Each module was a discrete microfluidic chip fabricated by 6 \nhot-embossing for dedicated tasks such as sample preparation, mixing, analysis, etc. Consequently, 7 \nany new microfluidic design could be incorporated into the system for a specific function as long 8 \nas some fundamental design rules were adhered to. Elastic averaging, which involves the 9 \nconstraints of the layers using dowel pins, was used to align the different chips together. 10 \n The elastic properties of the material and the constraint structure cause deformations in 11 \neach individual contact feature to average out over the sum of contact features throughout the solid 12 \nbody. The alignment offset measured was between 10 to 20 \u00b5m. Better accuracy (10 \u00b5m or less) 13 \nwas required for this method [41]. 14 \n A second example of post-processed integrated subsystems connected from separate chips 15 \nwas a lab-on-a-chip for POC clinical diagnostics, namely a micro biosensor [42,68]. The device 16 \nwas designed for detecting and identifying three metabolic parameters: Partial pressure of oxygen, 17 \nlactate concentration, and glucose concentration in human blood. The chips were produced by 18 \ninjection moulding using a replaceable insert with micro-features [69], and they were stacked and 19 \nlaminated together using thermal fusion. The same lamination approach was used to integrate 20 \ninjection moulded layers of an integrated microfluidic device for magnetic immunoassay [70]. 21 \n The integrated functions included chambers and buffer reservoirs, multiplexing channels 22 \nand a dispenser. Valves and other functional elements were also integrated, and they will be 23 \nmentioned in more details in the corresponding sections. Stacking was also used to fabricate a 24 \npneumatically actuated microfluidic device for bio-analytical applications [71]. 25 \n Modular structures have been proposed as an alternative method for stacking as a method 26 \nfor both integration and standardization. A microfluidic construction kit was presented, based on 27 \nmodern plastic production technology such as micro-injection moulding and hot-embossing [36]. 28 \nChips of different microfluidic functions could be fabricated to the size of a standard microscope 29 \nslide and connected in a standard frame, used for e.g. POC diagnostics. Modular designs with 30 \nintegrated interconnects were also produced by micro-moulding for continuous PCR [72]. 31 \n15 \n LOC devices integrated modularly can join several laboratory processes, such as sample 1 \npreparation, fluid handling, reaction, analysis and detection. Since miniaturized systems are likely 2 \nto be used in parallel with standard laboratory equipment, a modular standard kit has been 3 \nproduced as a method for standardizing microfluidic chips with laboratory equipment [39]. 4 \n A microfluidic system for DNA sequencing was also reported in the literature in which a 5 \nset of functional circuits was integrated with micro-fabricated connects. The functional chips were 6 \nmanufactured by hot-embossing PMMA and PC chips. They performed the following functions: 7 \nPCR amplification of DNA, purification of the PCR products, cycle sequencing using dye-8 \nterminator chemistry, purification of sequencing products, solid-phase reversible immobilization 9 \nand DNA electrophoresis [37]. COC was also injection moulded to produce a laminate-type 10 \nmicrofluidic device for PCR application [73]. 11 \n Both micro-injection moulding and hot-embossing were used to produce an integrated 12 \nchip for protein analysis [74]. Micro-injection moulding was used to fabricate the COC substrate 13 \nwith micro-channels, while hot-embossing was used to fabricate a polymeric piezoelectric micro-14 \ndiaphragm. The two parts were bonded together using UV adhesive bonding in a subsequent step. 15 \n When it comes to valving, some integrated solutions were presented for micromoulding. 16 \nPinch valves, for example, have been recently used as disposable on-chip fluid control elements. A 17 \nnumber of designs have been successfully tested for micromoulded integrated chips applied for 18 \npoint-of-care testing of metabolic parameters [75] and PCR analysis [73]. 19 \n2.1.3. Sealing elements for microfluidic devices 20 \n Due to the constraints imposed by the replication processes on the geometrical design of 21 \nthe part, microfluidic devices are replicated as open channels that need to be closed to prevent 22 \nleakage. From a functional point of view, sealing can be considered as a mass-to-mass function, 23 \nwhere the functional descriptor would be to \u201ccontain\u201d the fluid. Sealing takes place, either, during 24 \nfabrication as an integrated step in the processing, or, by post-processing sealing techniques. 25 \nSection 2.1.3.1 reviews sealing by micromoulding, whereas post-processing sealing techniques 26 \nwill be presented in section 2.1.3.2. 27 \n2.1.3.1. Sealing by micromoulding 28 \n In the literature covered within this review, a single experiment was reported in which 29 \nsealing took place as an integrated fabrication step [35]. In this experiment the covering step was 30 \n16 \nintegrated as part of the injection moulding process known as in-line covering. Both the substrate 1 \nand the cover are injected at the same time with the same material, such that the cover part is 2 \nattached to the nozzle side of the mould, while the micro-structured substrate is attached to the 3 \nejector side. The index plate carrying the cover rotates 180\u00b0 causing the two parts to be aligned, 4 \nand the surfaces of the two parts are warmed up, and after renewed closing of the mould the 5 \ncovering process follows. When the mould is opened, the covered part falls finished from the 6 \nmachine after 40 seconds. 7 \n2.1.3.2. Sealing by post-processing 8 \n Bonding lids to microfluidic substrates is the commonly used post-processing method to 9 \nclose microfluidic channels. The major challenges for bonding are to join the lid to the substrate 10 \nwithout clogging the channels, changing their physical parameters or altering their dimensions 11 \n[17,76]. Several techniques have been developed to seal polymeric microfluidic devices, and they 12 \ncan be grouped into three major categories: Sealing with the use of intermediate material, sealing 13 \nwith the use of energy and mechanical sealing. 14 \n Sealing with the use of intermediate material is commonly used for post-processing 15 \nmicromoulded microfluidic systems. Adhesives, for example, have been reported in the literature 16 \nas intermediate sealing agents for micromoulded microfluidic systems, such as conventional glues 17 \n[8,17], UV-curable adhesives [13], thermally activated adhesives [38] and copolymer adhesives 18 \n[12]. In addition to adhesives, polymeric foils, such as PET, have also been tested as intermediate 19 \nmaterials to laminate microfluidic substrates together [17]. Solvent-assisted bonding is another 20 \ntechnique where microfluidic substrates are wetted with, for example, mixed organic solvents [15] 21 \nor acetyl acetone [77] and joined permanently under pressure [57,78]. 22 \n Sealing with energy is based on using one or more types of energy to join the 23 \nmicromoulded devices without the use of an intermediate material. The literature reports a few 24 \nexamples of micromoulded microfluidic devices that were bonded using energy, such as induction 25 \nheating [76], laser welding [17,76] and thermal-diffusion bonding [8,14,16,50,57,73]. Ultrasonic 26 \nwelding and UV-bonding are other available energy-based techniques for bonding polymers, but 27 \nvery little is mentioned in the literature about using them for microfluidics. 28 \n Mechanical sealing is commonly used as a sealing technique, especially for prototyping 29 \npurposes. A number of examples were mentioned in the literature, where screws [40,52,55] or 30 \nsnap-fit systems [44] were used to seal polymeric microfluidic devices. A 31 \n17 \npolyethylene\/thermoplastic elastomers (PE\/TPA) film was used to seal and injection moulded CE 1 \nchip made of PMMA and PC [51]. 2 \n Selecting an appropriate packaging technique for polymeric microfluidic devices depends 3 \non a number of factors, such as the substrate material, the temperatures involved, compatibility 4 \nwith fluids used and channel size. In addition, the cost of the process is significant to the feasibility 5 \nof the process for mass-production. A more detailed comparison between packaging techniques for 6 \ndisposable microfluidics is available in the literature [71,79]. A recent review has also been 7 \npublished addressing bonding of thermoplastic polymer microfluidics [80]. 8 \n2.2. Integrated elements involving energy-to-mass transformation 9 \nfunctions 10 \n A propulsion force, such as mechanical pressure or centrifugal force is needed to pump 11 \nfluids throughout the microfluidic channels. Generating forces is usually done by interaction 12 \nbetween on-chip elements, e.g. pressure reservoir or capillary channels, and off-chip elements, 13 \nsuch as a motor for rotation or a pressure pump. Fluid propulsion systems can, therefore, be 14 \nconsidered as \u201cinterfacial\u201d integration tools, in the sense that they connect on-chip micro-15 \ncomponents to off-chip macro-components. 16 \n The amount of energy needed to pump liquids in microfluidic channels vary depending on 17 \napplication. For example, a microfluidic device for chemical analysis was made in which 18 \ndeionised water was pumped at a rate of 730 nl\/min with a fixed power of 500 mW [81]. In 19 \nanother application, a microfluidic chip was designed to have a power supply from a commercially 20 \navailable 12V-type MN21 battery [82]. The power consumed for transferring a liquid across the 21 \nchip ranged between 145 mW initially down to 71 mW after 40 cycles of operation, because the 22 \nbattery was unable to maintain the supply voltage above 75% of the initial output. The experiment 23 \nrevealed, however, that only 8% of the power consumed was consumed in the chip, while the rest 24 \nwas consumed by the electric converter and control circuitry. 25 \n Several techniques have been developed for fluid propulsion. In the literature, three main 26 \npropulsion methods were discussed: mechanical, electrical and thermal [18]. 27 \n For mechanical propulsion systems, a mechanical pump is often used to provide the 28 \ndriving pressure. It can be as simple as a roller in the blister pouch design, or as complicated as a 29 \nminiaturized syringe or acoustic pump [18]. 30 \n18 \n For electrically-driven systems, electro-kinetic techniques such as electro-osmosis or 1 \nelectrophoresis, electrodynamics and electrowetting have the advantage that they scale favourably 2 \nfor miniaturization. In electro-osmosis or electrophoresis, the driving forces for flow are generated 3 \nby the interaction of applied electric fields with ionic species in the fluids. In electrodynamics, the 4 \nflow is generated by the interaction of electric fields with induced electric charges in the fluids. 5 \nElectrowetting is based on the principle that the contact angle between a liquid and a solid surface 6 \ncan be changed through the application of an electrical potential. This change may result in 7 \ncapillary forces that provide a driving pressure in small flow channel. 8 \n For thermally driven propulsion, it is possible to manipulate the contact angle between a 9 \nliquid and a solid surface by changing the local fluid temperature. The resulting capillary force is 10 \nused to drive the fluid as in electro-wetting [18]. 11 \n2.2.1. Post-processed fluid propulsion elements 12 \n The recent trend towards further integration has resulted in the development of techniques 13 \nin which the off-chip assistance is minimized. One example is a microinjection moulded device 14 \nused for medical diagnostics applications, which had an integrated air-bursting detonator as a 15 \nfluid-driving source. This eliminated costly, non-disposable, active microfluidic pumps. As soon 16 \nas the membrane is broken, the pressurized gas is released pushing the fluid samples into the 17 \nmicrochannel through the ruptured membrane [42,68]. The detonator was powered by a 40 mW 18 \npulse to power the microheater for 700 ms, which resulted in the release of 650 \u03bcJ of stored 19 \npneumatic energy to drive a 500 nl sample through microchannels [83]. This technique allows for 20 \na relatively higher degree of integrity, since the pressure pump is a cheap and disposable part of 21 \nthe microfluidic device. 22 \n On-chip propulsion was also achieved using a chemical propellant, where 23 \nazobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was used as an actuator that releases N2 gas. The gas pressure can 24 \nthen be controlled to accurately control the fluid flow [75]. In another application, a microfluidic 25 \nsystem was designed for medical diagnosis, and fluid propulsion takes place using a hydrogen-26 \noxygen gas mixture generated by a sodium polyacrylate-based hydrogel. The gas is created by 27 \napplying an electric voltage to the water in the hydrogel stored on the chip [84]. 28 \n Developing integrated energy-to-mass elements will greatly affect the production of 29 \nintegrated microfluidic devices. They have the advantages of mass-to-mass delivery systems in the 30 \n19 \nsense that they are integrated as on-chip, power-source elements. At the same time they have the 1 \npotential of supplying relatively large amounts of power comparable to what is offered by non-2 \nintegrated elements, such as syringe pumps and pipettes. 3 \n2.3. Integrated elements involving energy-to-energy transformation 4 \nfunctions 5 \n Several applications of energy conversion have been used in microfluidic devices, such as 6 \nmicroheaters and electromagnets. Electrically conducting structures such as wires and electrodes 7 \nare the most commonly used elements, especially for applications such as resistive or capacitive 8 \nsensing, electrophoresis, integrated heaters and electro-hydrodynamic pumping [85]. Magnetic, 9 \noptical or thermal elements may also be used depending on the application. 10 \n The majority of devices with elements performing energy-to-energy transformation 11 \nfunctions reported in the literature have external elements that are added by post-processing by, for 12 \nexample, ink-printing or sputtering. Very few devices have been reported having functional 13 \nelements integrated within the same micromoulding process of the plastic substrate, because 14 \nintegrating such elements requires an additional step of placing them in the mould or the insert. 15 \nThis additional step elongates the cycle time unless a design modification is made in the machine 16 \nor the mould to integrate and automate the process. 17 \n The following sections review integrated elements fabricated by micromoulding and post-18 \nprocessing. 19 \n2.3.1. Energy-conversion functional elements fabricated by micromoulding 20 \n One of the advantages of micromoulding is the possibility of embedding elements into the 21 \nplastic during moulding [86]. Conduction paths have been integrated into device structures by hot-22 \nembossing a composite polymer\/metal material. Paths were first applied to the unstructured 23 \nsubstrate and then pressed into the polymer layer during hot embossing so that embedded 24 \nconduction paths are obtained following the embossed topology [14]. A hybrid structure was also 25 \nmanufactured by integrating a metal insert inside a polymer matrix by hot embossing [20]. In a 26 \nrecent application, conductive polymer electrodes coated with metal were integrated by micro-27 \ninjection moulding into a polystyrene substrate using over moulding [86]. A similar technique was 28 \nused to directly emboss a gold nanoelectrode ensemble film into a PMMA based microchip for CE 29 \n[87]. Hot-embossing was also used to fabricate electro-fluidic polymer microchips [85]. In this 30 \n20 \napplication, electrical wires were integrated by a single-step method into an embossed polymeric 1 \nmicrofluidic chip. Using this method, wires could be placed in contact with the flowing fluid or 2 \nembedded in close proximity to the fluid channels. 3 \n For micro-injection moulding, a developing approach for integrating energy-to-energy 4 \nelements is micro-assembly injection moulding. This process is suitable for producing hybrid 5 \nmicro-structures by injection moulding, such as movable joints, hollow structures and 6 \novermoulding wires and optical fibres [88-92]. In this process, electronic connections or optical 7 \nfibres can be overmoulded within the injection moulding cycle. 8 \n In order not to affect the cycle time, the micro-structured cavity is allowed to be 9 \nexchanged during the machine cycle such that the process steps of demoulding, positioning of 10 \ninsert and heating the cavity for Variothermal processing can be done at an external station. In 11 \nother words, an external cycle is allowed to take place parallel to the main cycle of the machine. 12 \n In order to ensure dimensional stability, the behaviour of different materials for both the 13 \ninsert and the polymer in the injection process should be considered. Additionally, the influence of 14 \nthe flow direction of the polymer is also significant for dimensional stability. 15 \n2.3.2. Energy-conversion functional elements fabricated by post-16 \nprocessing 17 \n2.3.2.1. Electrodes 18 \n Electrodes are commonly used in microfluidic applications, either for electrical 19 \nmeasurements or for voltage application. They are particularly important for microfluidic 20 \napplications that use electroosmotic flow or electrochemical detection [64]. Electrodes are 21 \nclassified as energy-to-energy elements, since they are used to generate voltages in applications 22 \nsuch as electrophoresis. 23 \n Several post-processing techniques have been used for integrating electrodes onto 24 \nreplicated polymer-based microfluidic devices. Conventional deposition methods such as 25 \nsputtering and thermal or electron beam evaporation can be used [93]. However, there is limitation 26 \non the electrode dimension due to the shadow mask used, which restricts the electrode width to 40 27 \n\u00b5m and above. Alternatively, laser ablated microchannels can be filled with a conducting ink and 28 \nact as electrodes [17,45,94,95]. It should be noted that not all metals are equally easily applied to 29 \n21 \npolymer materials, as some problems might appear such as formation of metal clusters instead of 1 \nuniform films and formation of micro-cracks in the metal film [64]. 2 \n For an injection-moulded device used for insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP), 3 \nplatinum-wire electrodes were inserted directly into the syringes used for fluid delivery. A 4 \nprogrammable high-voltage sequencer was used to apply voltage [96]. In another micro-injection 5 \nmoulded device for monitoring DNA migration, four holes were drilled in the lid, and platinum 6 \nelectrodes were inserted in the chambers afterwards and fixed in narrow slits [52]. Sputtering by 7 \nusing adapted shadow masks was used to generate electric thin-film electrodes of gold in an 8 \ninjection-moulded electrophoresis separation device [78]. Furthermore, in an injection-moulded 9 \ndevice for DNA separation, electrodes of 76-\u03bcm-diameter wire were routed to each of the four 10 \nreservoirs available and terminated at one edge of the chip with a four-prong 2.54-mm-pitch 11 \nelectric header [38]. Gold electrodes were also patterned over a hot-embossed polymeric 12 \ndiaphragm as a part of an integrated microfluidic device for protein analysis [74]. 13 \n An example for the use of conductive ink printing is a hot-embossed microfluidic device 14 \nfor bacteria detection. Electrodes, with contact pads, function as capillary-electrophoresis driving 15 \nelectrodes. They were integrated by connecting them to high voltage via \u201cpogo\u201d pins. They were 16 \nmanufactured by screen-printing silver\/graphite inks onto the polycyclic olefin support film. After 17 \nbeing cured at 95\u00b0C for 2 hours, the ink pattern on its supporting film was aligned and thermally 18 \nlaminated onto the cover film of the device [45]. 19 \n2.3.2.2. Microheaters 20 \n A common application for energy conversion is microheaters, where localized elevated 21 \ntemperatures are needed in specific places on the microfluidic chip, such as in the case of 22 \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) devices. In these devices, thermal cycles consist typically of two 23 \nsteps: a \u201cdenaturing\u201d step at 95\u02daC and an \u201canneal\/extend\u201d step at 60\u02daC [94]. 24 \n Installing a microheater on a microfluidic chip is currently done by post processing 25 \ntechniques, since it is technically difficult to integrate microheaters into micromoulding processes. 26 \nThis is because insert-moulding a microheater requires accurate alignment in each cycle, and there 27 \nis possibility of malfunction in the microheater due to the high pressures associated with 28 \nmicromoulding. 29 \n22 \n Two examples were reported in the literature. The first example is the microheater used in 1 \nthe air-bursting detonator discussed in the previous section, where electric pulses were applied to 2 \nheat the thermoplastic membrane causing it to melt and release pressurized gas [42]. 3 \n The second example for using microheaters is PCR devices, where integrating thermal 4 \nelements is essential for the function of the device. Heaters were integrated in PCR microfluidic 5 \ndevices produced by hot embossing by mounting electrical resistance heaters to the chip. [56,97]. 6 \n2.3.2.3. Electromagnets and optical fibres 7 \n Examples of integrating functional elements other than electrical parts also appear in the 8 \nliterature. For example, in a magnetic bead-separation device, an external electromagnet was 9 \nintegrated to produce the magnetic fields required for separation. The magnetic forces acting on 10 \nthe beads were different depending on the bead size. For example, for a bead diameter in the order 11 \nof tens of microns, the magnetic forces were in the order of thousands of pico-Newtons. Magnetic 12 \nbeads in the size of 2-9 \u00b5m could be separated from an aqueous solution at the flow rate of 3-7 13 \n\u00b5l\/min [98]. 14 \n Post-processed elements may also include optical fibres used for fluorescence excitation 15 \nlight. The optical fibre inserted was coupled to a laser fibre that was connected to a diode laser. 16 \nThe laser produced approximately 2.5 mW of power at a wave length of 750 nm. Integrating 17 \ndetection fibres was used for a hot-embossed DNA separation device, where a dual fibre detector 18 \nwas inserted into the assembled device. The fibres were etched and sealed with epoxy [12]. Optical 19 \nfibres were also integrated into a hot embossed microfluidic device for CE [99,100]. 20 \n2.4. Integrated elements involving energy-to-information 21 \ntransformation functions 22 \n Few examples for integrated detection and measurement systems are presented in the 23 \nliterature. Thermocouples, for example, can be used to monitor the temperature variation on the 24 \nmicrofluidic chip for PCR applications [56,97]. Micro-ammeters, of resolution down to 0.1 \u03bcA, 25 \nwere also reported to be used for current monitoring in micro-injection moulded devices for DNA 26 \nseparation [38]. However, the complexity of the detection process requires interaction between on-27 \nchip sensing elements, e.g. a thermocouple, and external, non-integrated, devices for recording and 28 \nanalysis. Therefore, energy-to-information elements should probably by identified as \u201cinterfacial\u201d 29 \n23 \nelements between what can be integrated on-chip and what is external to the system. More about 1 \nnon-integrated elements is discussed in the following section. 2 \n3. Non-integrated Functional Elements 3 \n This part of the review is concerned with presenting functional elements that are 4 \ncommonly used with microfluidic devices, yet not integrated on the chip. Non-integrated elements, 5 \noften expensive and non-disposable, are connected to microfluidic chips to perform relatively 6 \ncomplex functions. Such functions are usually related to the input or output elements of the 7 \nmicrofluidic system. Input elements, in turn, are usually associated with delivering the fluidic 8 \nsample to the chip, and include inlet tubes and relevant connections.  These input elements are 9 \ntabulated in column 8 of Table 2. Output elements are associated with the outcome of the 10 \nmicrofluidic system, such as detection and data analysis. These input elements are tabulated in 11 \ncolumn 9 of Table 2. A few non-integrated elements are used for both inputs and outputs, such as a 12 \npower supply. 13 \n These types of elements are usually a source of the high costs often currently associated 14 \nwith microfluidic applications, a fact that limits many microfluidic devices to lab prototyping 15 \nexperiments rather than high-volume commercial purposes. The following sections present some 16 \nof the commonly used elements. 17 \n3.1. Non-integrated elements involving energy-to-mass 18 \ntransformation functions 19 \n These elements are usually used for fluid propulsion systems, especially when energy is 20 \nrequired for the fluid to either be able to balance capillary forces or to flow into different chambers 21 \nin a specific sequence. 22 \n Several integrated devices covered within this literature review depend on external 23 \nmechanical pumping equipment, e.g. syringes or pipettes. For example, a hot-embossed 24 \nmicrofluidic device for magnetic bead separation was equipped with a syringe pump to deliver the 25 \nbeads in the form of an aqueous solution containing magnetic beads of three different sizes [98]. 26 \nThe same system was applied for an injection-moulded integrated microfluidic device for blood-27 \ntyping, where the blood and the serum streams were pumped with two separate syringe-pumps to 28 \nallow for different flow rates [60]. 29 \n24 \n In an injection-moulded device, syringe pumps were also used to control flow inlets in a 1 \nmicrofluidic cross-junction to produce beads [55]. Computer-controlled syringe pumps were also 2 \nused to control the flow of the sample in a micromoulded chip for monitoring of microarray 3 \nhybridizations [58]. 4 \n Vacuum pumping was also pointed out in the literature as a possible mechanical fluid 5 \npropulsion system, where a vacuum-driven system was used in a modularly integrated hot-6 \nembossed device [41]. In another hot-embossed device for bacteria detection, vacuum was used to 7 \nmove the sample throughout the device [45]. In addition, vacuum pumping was used for moving 8 \nblood cells across micro-channels in a micro-injection moulded device used for monitoring DNA 9 \nfragments [52].  10 \n Centrifugation is a developing method for fluid propulsion, where reagents are preloaded 11 \nin the chip, and centrifugal forces are used to trigger the fluid flow throughout the channels. In 12 \ncentrifugal pumping, fluid propulsion is achieved through rotationally induced hydrostatic 13 \npressure. It uses a single low-cost motor, and is capable of fine flow control through proper design 14 \nof the location, dimensions and geometry of channels and reservoirs based on fluid properties. A 15 \ndevice works by spinning a CD-format chip such that the centrifugal forces overcome the capillary 16 \nforces and the fluid is pumped throughout the channels [18]. However, it should be noted that 17 \ncentrifugation is not only dependent on energy, because the design of the channels themselves play 18 \na role in the propulsion of the fluid. The usually-radial configuration of the channels in addition to 19 \nthe sizes of the different channels\/reservoirs determines how the fluid will proceed. 20 \n An electric field has been applied through integrated electrodes in order to control voltage 21 \nchanges leading to particle separation by electrophoresis [13,101] or electro-osmotic flow [37]. 22 \n3.2. Non-integrated elements involving energy-to-energy 23 \ntransformation functions 24 \n Power supply sources are commonly used to deliver electrical power to different 25 \nfunctional elements on the chip. As mentioned previously, with integrated elements for energy-to-26 \nenergy transformation (section 2.3), an external power source is needed to supply high voltages or 27 \nto operate heaters. Electrophoresis microfluidic devices reviewed in this paper needed a source of 28 \nhigh voltage either from lab-scale power supplies [9,12,15,38,45,52,102] or a voltage-control unit 29 \n25 \nadjusted by an accompanying software [16]. Electric field values can be in the order of few tens up 1 \nto few hundreds of volts depending on the application [103,104]. 2 \n Power supply is also associated with temperature control, where microfluidic systems are 3 \nrequired to operate under constant temperature. This can be done by a Peltier controller, for 4 \nexample [58]. 5 \n3.3. Non-integrated elements involving energy-to-information 6 \ntransformation functions 7 \n Device elements performing energy-to-information transformation functions are usually 8 \nassociated with detection and inspection. As an example of a relatively advanced detection 9 \nelement, a detection system was designed in which a circuit converted the output signal from the 10 \nbiosensors to a voltage signal, which in turn was amplified, and the peak value detected and 11 \ndisplayed [42]. 12 \n Inspection is essential for the majority of microfluidic applications, because it is usually 13 \nrequired to observe the micro-scale motion of the fluid or to count specific particles. 14 \n Conventional microscopes are used to optically observe specific processes inside the 15 \nmicrochannels. They can be used, for example, for monitoring cell movements [52]. CCD cameras 16 \nwere also used for monitoring sample movement in channels [15]. 17 \n In other applications, especially in DNA separation processes, fluorescence is the most 18 \npopular optical detection method for microfluidics due to its excellent sensitivity down to 19 \nmeasuring single molecules [64]. A sensitive technique is often required because of the small 20 \nsample volumes involved [31,44]. Off-chip fluorescence detection is typically accomplished 21 \nthrough the use of lasers for the excitation of fluorescent molecules and CCD cameras or 22 \nphotomultiplier tubes for detection of the emitted fluorescent light [31]. Usually confocal 23 \nmicroscopes are used for this purpose [9,52,56,102]. Laser induced confocal microscopes have 24 \nbeen used in several microfluidic experiments mentioned in the literature [13,15,16,45,105]. 25 \nContactless conductivity detection was also proposed as a detection technique that overcomes 26 \nsome of florescence limitations. It was used within an injection-moulded system for measuring 27 \nsmall ions in foodstuff [93]. 28 \n 29 \n 30 \n  31 \n26 \n4. Discussion 1 \n4.1. An overview of the current state of integrated micro-moulded 2 \nmicrofluidics: 3 \n In this review paper, the current state of research was presented for integrated polymeric 4 \nmicrofluidic devices produced by two micro-moulding techniques, namely micro-injection 5 \nmoulding and hot-embossing.  6 \n The classification system used in this review was intended to link the functional aspects 7 \nof microfluidic devices together with the degree of integration allowed by current device 8 \nfabrication techniques. It allowed the review of integrated microfluidic devices from a 9 \ntaxonomical perspective, by combining a physical functional perspective, represented in the nine 10 \ntypes of \u201ctransformation functions\u201d, with a manufacturing perspective, represented in integration 11 \ntechnologies. This approach was summarised in Table 2. 12 \n The approach used in this paper gave an indication of the level of difficulty involved in 13 \nintegrating each of these generic components and the relationship of this to the elements' 14 \ntransformation function. For example, Table 2 showed that elements of relatively \u201csimple\u201d 15 \ntransformation function, e.g. mass-to-mass, are likely to be directly micro-mouldable (column 6), 16 \nwhereas other transformation functions appear to be currently not-integrated (columns 8 and 9). 17 \nMost of the elements used for moving or storing masses of liquids, essentially the fluidic 18 \nsubsystem, are able to be incorporated into the chip as part of the operation of micro-moulding, 19 \nthough manifold designs for connection of the devices to the outer world still generally require 20 \noff-chip integration. 21 \n It can be noticed that the majority of non-integrated elements are associated with energy-22 \ndriven elements (fluid propulsion, for example) and with data collection and analysis. When 23 \nenergy or information are involved as inputs or outputs, the system becomes more complex in 24 \nstructure, because the current level of technology does not easily allow elements involving energy 25 \nor information transformations to be incorporated into polymer-based chips. Therefore, non-26 \nintegrated, non-disposable elements are usually needed to ensure the successful overall 27 \nperformance of the chip, with consequences in higher manufacturing complexity and higher costs. 28 \nThis is one of the major reasons why much of the current state of art of microfluidic chips is 29 \nmainly confined to prototypes that are not easily mass-manufacturable. 30 \n27 \n Table 2 offered an overall summary of the current state of integrated, replicated, 1 \nmicrofluidic devices based on thermoplastic high-volume processes. Hence, the blanks in Table 2 2 \nrepresent examples of one of two possibilities: either research gaps, or applications that are not yet 3 \nneeded. It is possible to separate the two by noting whether the application is currently achieved 4 \nby non-integrated means. An example of the former is the mass-production of a fluid-propulsion 5 \nsystem (energy-to-mass) that is fully integrated in a microfluidic system. This requirement is 6 \ncurrently met only by non-integrated syringe pumps and centrifugal forces. An example of the 7 \nlatter is the mass-production of a mass-to-energy system, where there is no indication in the 8 \nliterature of a non-integrated system having been developed.  9 \n In this regard, several transformation functions were not discussed in the review as no 10 \nintegrated or non-integrated examples were found in the literature.  These are highlighted by the 11 \nblank rows in Table 2. These were mass-to-energy (as noted above), mass-to-information, 12 \ninformation-to-mass, information-to-energy and information-to-information.  13 \n The classification method was limited to the transformation from one basic element to 14 \nanother. Therefore, elements that have multiple inputs or outputs were not presented in Table 2. 15 \nVery few examples of multiple input and output functions exist in the literature. However, those 16 \nthat do exist are worth highlighting, because of their relatively level of sophistication. The main 17 \nexample is that of active micro-valves.  18 \n The classification method, represented in Table 2, was mainly directed to the viewpoint of 19 \na \u201cdesigner\u201d wishing to design a microfluidic system consisting of a set of integrated functions, 20 \nwhich, at the same time, would be producible by high-volume polymer replication processes. 21 \nHowever, for a manufacturer, the focus might be mainly on the integration technique, i.e. how to 22 \nintegrate an external element by high-volume processes.  23 \n To attempt to satisfy such a requirement, Table 3 tabulates the literature using integration 24 \ntechniques rather than integrated functions as the basis of tabulation. (It therefore, does not include 25 \nthe literature on non-integrated techniques.)  26 \n If the volume of literature references can be taken as a guide, then post-processing 27 \nappears to dominate integration techniques. On-machine assembly is relatively common, followed 28 \nby direct integration, with modular integration represented by a small portion of the literature. 29 \n However, it should also be noted that some of the integration methods that are used as 30 \nestablished techniques for conventional injection moulding have not yet been developed for micro-31 \n28 \nmoulding. Three-component moulding, for example, is used on the conventional scale to integrate 1 \na number of elements in a single moulding cycle using a special mould system fitted with a robotic 2 \nsystem [106]. 3 \nIntegration Technique Applications Ref. \n\uf09f Direct integration of fluid-\nmanipulation functions within \nthe mould design \nIntegrating microfluidic systems, CD-\nlike designs, passive valves and \nmoulded interconnections. \n[18,42,45,60,61] \nPassive valves [18,42] \nMoulded interconnects [50] \n\uf09f Modular integration Integrating microfluidic systems by \nlamination or modular kits \n[36,41,42,71] \n\uf09f On-the-machine assembly [20]: \n- Micro-assembly \ninjection moulding \nIntegrating movable joints, hollow \nstructures \n[88-90] \n- In-line sealing Sealing the microfluidic system \ndirectly during micro-moulding \n[35] \n- Micro-overmoulding Integrating fibres and wires or \nintegrating interconnects. \n[19,20,59,86,90] \n\uf09f Post processing Sealing the microfluidic device [8,12,15,17,38,55,76,\n78] \nInterconnections by ports or drilled \nholes \n[39,41,53,55-57] \nAdding external functional elements, \nsuch as electrodes, micro-heaters, \nmagnets and optical fibres. \n[12,38,45,52,56,78,96\n-98] \nTable 3: An example of a classification method based on integration technique 4 \n4.2. Potential developments from a low cost, mass manufacturing 5 \nviewpoint: 6 \n As has been shown in this review, micro-moulding techniques have gained increasing 7 \ninterest as low cost manufacturing solutions for integrated microfluidics. Figure 1 shows a 8 \nschematic diagram of the degree of integration in micromoulded microfluidics based on the 9 \nreviewed literature. The figure, which presents Table 2 from another viewpoint, shows that 10 \nmicromoulding technologies are still far from realizing fully integrated microfluidic systems 11 \ncapable of covering the required range of transformation functions. This is due to a number of 12 \nchallenges that are discussed below. 13 \n 14 \n 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n29 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \nFigure 1: A schematic diagram showing current state of technology regarding the production of 11 \nintegrated elements within micromoulded microfluidic devices. 12 \n4.2.1. Geometrical constraints for microfluidic subsystems 13 \n Micromoulding has become an established technique for producing microfluidic chips 14 \nwith generally passive integrated functions, such as channels, passive valves and dispensers.  15 \nHowever, it is noted from the reported examples discussed in this review that almost all the 16 \ndevices are based on a 2\u00bd-D design, which is the simplest geometry producible by injection 17 \nmoulding or hot embossing. This is due to the conventional parallel-movement design of the two 18 \nplatens typical for net-shape manufacturing techniques, which limits the complexity of the 19 \nmanufacturable geometry. In order to produce true three-dimensional geometries with cavities or 20 \nundercuts, modular lamination is the currently used method. Despite of the number of advantages 21 \nthat such \u201cmodular\u201d designs might offer, such systems require additional fabrication steps for 22 \nbonding or connection. Accurate alignment of different stacked layers can also be challenging. In 23 \naddition, there is an added cost arising from using frame systems and inter-layer connections.  24 \n4.2.2. Energy-conversion functional elements 25 \n Post-processing is currently the dominant technique for integrating such elements, but this 26 \nis time consuming and a considerable bottleneck in mass-production. In addition, they are main 27 \nsources of raised manufacturing costs, knowing that back-end processing steps can make up to 28 \n80% of the device manufacturing cost [25]. In order for microfluidic devices to perform more 29 \nsophisticated processes, more functional elements will need to be integrated in an efficient 30 \nMicrofluidic Chip \nProduced by Micromoulding \n \n(Fully integrated functions, e.g. \nfluid manipulation, valving, \nsealing, energy-conversion \nelements, etc.) \nIn-line \nIntegration \nPost-processing \nIntegration \nInterface \nElements \n(e.g. fluid \ndelivery\/ \ninterconnection) \nInterface \nElements \n(e.g. fluid \ndelivery\/ \ninterconnection) \nInput Elements \n \n(non-integrated \nfunctions) \n(e.g. fluid \npumping, power \nsource, etc.) \nOutput Elements \n \n(non-integrated \nfunctions) \n(e.g. detection, \nanalysis, power \nsource, etc.) \n30 \nmanufacturing process. Micro-overmoulding and micro- insert-moulding are solutions currently 1 \nunder investigation. However, these techniques would require considerable automation to place, 2 \naccurately, the inserted element in the mould each cycle. 3 \n4.2.3. Sealing micro-fluidic devices 4 \n Sealing is usually attempted by face-to-face bonding or by adhesives. Several techniques 5 \nare being established for connecting polymers to similar or dissimilar polymers or to other 6 \nmaterials. Nevertheless, sealing is also a process bottleneck from an industrial perspective, 7 \nbecause of the time consumed in sealing individual devices and the difficulty encountered in 8 \nbonding polymers. 9 \n In-line sealing has been described, very briefly, within the literature for micro-injection 10 \nmoulding, and remains a challenge for further research. The main advantage of this technique is 11 \nthat it integrates the sealing process in the fabrication cycle making the manufacturing cycle time 12 \nof the whole device acceptable. The automation of the process can result in accurate alignment and 13 \ncontrol over bonding parameters such as time and force. In addition the process eliminates the use 14 \nof external adhesives or back-end processes. 15 \n Nevertheless, this technique uses special machine designs and setups in order to 16 \nundertake the covering process. Furthermore, in cases where it is desired to have the substrate and 17 \nthe lid from different materials, the process will be more complex: two different injection units 18 \nwill be required. This is perhaps the reason why this technology has not yet seen wider adoption. 19 \n4.2.4. Fluid delivery to the device 20 \n Most of the available interconnection solutions are either not suitable for mass-21 \nproduction, for example drilling and gluing, or too expensive, for example self-adhesive ports. 22 \nFluid delivery can be improved by designing a fitting system that can be moulded together with 23 \nthe device substrate (or lid) to allow standard tubes to be attached more easily and securely. 24 \nHowever, it is relatively challenging to replicate ports with internal or external threads via plastic 25 \nreplication techniques because of geometrical complexity associated with undercuts and because 26 \nof the elongated cycle time. Overmoulding is currently being tested as an interconnection 27 \ntechnology, and it has the potential of producing a microfluidic substrate where tubes are inserted 28 \nin the mould and the polymer is injected over them, sealing in place by overmoulding. 29 \n31 \n4.2.5. Fluid propulsion 1 \n Fluid pumping is generally still performed by off-chip sources or at least with the 2 \ninteraction of external elements, because energy-to-mass functions currently require external 3 \nsources of energy. Pre-installing the required reagents and using capillary motion are suggested 4 \nalternatives, unless a continuous-flow system is required for specific applications. In mass-5 \nproduction environment, a fluid propulsion element could be manufactured externally, such as air-6 \npressure pumps, and then integrated as an insert within a moulding process. 7 \n4.2.6. Fluid control 8 \n With regard to fluid regulation, many valving options have been developed for fluid 9 \ncontrol in microfluidic devices. Active valves form the majority of types and mechanisms, but 10 \nvery little is available in the literature about using active valves within micro-injection moulding 11 \nor hot-embossing techniques. Passive valves are more promising in terms of manufacturing 12 \nintegration and cost, since several types of them can readily be produced by micromoulding. 13 \nPassive valves, nevertheless, are not suitable for all applications, and they need further 14 \ndevelopment for applications where more complex flow patterns are required. 15 \n4.2.7. Data collection and analysis 16 \n Some innovations have been achieved in detection techniques for POC applications [107]. 17 \nHowever, detection and analysis systems are likely to remain as non-disposable elements, for the 18 \nnear future, because of the cost and manufacturing complexity associated with them within the 19 \ncurrently available technology. 20 \n A current trend to overcome this limitation is to integrate relatively-cheap disposable 21 \nchips with non-disposable, but portable, analysis elements. Several research groups are currently 22 \ntesting the use of a \u201ccartridge\u201d approach, where a disposable chip, either micromoulded or glass-23 \netched, is inserted and operated within a non-disposable, but portable, analysis system [42,108].  24 \n The \u201cwristwatch\u201d example is a step forward in this direction. In this system, a disposable 25 \nchip is inserted and accessed by a portable watch-like analysis device. The disposable chip is 26 \ndesigned to be inserted into the analyser unit where the microfluidic sequencing is initiated by a 27 \ntrigger signal from the electronic controller. The electrochemical detection circuitry on the 28 \nanalyser is used to determine the concentration of different analytes [42]. The same principle has 29 \n32 \nbeen recently developed for testing metabolic parameters in human blood with a micromoulded 1 \ndisposable chip and a portable analyser [75]. 2 \n This approach to integration, despite being a practical solution within the currently 3 \navailable technology, has some limitations. It makes use of the disposability and low-cost offered 4 \nby micromoulding, but it still requires the availability of relatively costly equipment to analyse the 5 \ncollected data. Moreover, very precise positioning and alignment is required between the chip and 6 \nthe analyser system in order to ensure robust contact between their interactive elements, such as 7 \nelectrical components and valves. As suggested in the literature, having the microfluidic chip as 8 \njust a small part of system in which sample introduction and detection are much more complicated 9 \nthan the chip\u201fs operation may be appropriate in some circumstances, but does detract from the 10 \npotential advantages of microfluidic devices [7]. 11 \n4.2.8. Power Sources 12 \n Some examples of power source solutions were presented in sections 2.2 and 3.2. The 13 \nmajority of the review literature presented conventional sources of power, either main power-14 \nsupply or batteries. Some examples have been shown where air-pressure or chemical reaction can 15 \nbe used as powers source for fluid propulsion, but even these systems require the existence of an 16 \nexternal power source, like a battery, to trigger the release of air or chemical reagents. Power 17 \ngeneration is, therefore, likely to remain a non-integrated functional element until more convenient 18 \nintegrable solutions are developed. 19 \n20 \n33 \n5. Conclusion 1 \n This paper aimed to critically review the state-of-the-art of technology for producing 2 \nintegrated polymeric microfluidic chips by high-volume micromoulding techniques. In this regard, 3 \nmicro-injection moulding and hot-embossing were chosen as the replication processes covered in 4 \nthis review. 5 \n The current state-of-the-art of integration of functional elements into moulded polymer 6 \nmicrofluidic devices was assessed. Levels of integration were classified by two methods. Firstly, 7 \nby \u201ctransformation function\u201d of the element, i.e. transformations between mass, energy and 8 \ninformation.  Secondly, by the current level of integration of these elements into microfluidic 9 \ndevices, whether integrated via moulding, by post-processing or, as yet, not integrated. The review 10 \ngave detailed examples of elements used to perform the transformation functions and their current 11 \nlevel of integration.  12 \n The review showed considerable differences between the level of integration of elements, 13 \ndependant on the elements\u201f transformation function. In particular, non-integration was found for 14 \nelements with either energy-driven, or data collection and analysis transformation functions. At the 15 \npresent time, analysis systems with disposable microfluidic cartridges, represent the state of the art 16 \nfor the latter. Certain transformation functions, for example mass-to-energy showed no elements 17 \ncurrently under development. 18 \n The review also assessed the options for integration of elements by such high volume 19 \nprocesses.  Post-processing appeared relatively common, followed by on-machine assembly, direct 20 \nintegration and then modular integration. 21 \n Potential developments in several key areas were assessed. Overmoulding, insert-22 \nmoulding and in-line sealing all have potential for improving the direct integration of elements. 23 \nReferences 24 \n[1] Becker H (2008) Microfluidics: a technology coming of age.
