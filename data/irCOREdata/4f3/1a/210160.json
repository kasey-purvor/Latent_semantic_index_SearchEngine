Hobson and George Lawson \n \n \n2 \nHistory and International Relations1  \n \nTo some extent, history has always been a core feature of the international imagination. On \nboth sides of the Atlantic, leading figures in the discipline such as E.H. Carr, Hans \nMorgenthau, Martin Wight, Hedley Bull and Stanley Hoffman have all employed history as a \nmeans of illuminating their research. Indeed, Wight made searching the desiderata of \ninternational history the sine qua non of international theory, the best that could be hoped for \nin a discipline without a core problematique of its own.2 Although often considered to have \nbeen banished by the scientific turn in International Relations (IR) during the Cold War, at \nleast in the United States, history never really went away as a tool of IR theory. And in recent \nyears, the (re)turn of history has been one of the most striking features of the various \nopenings in IR theory ushered in by the end of the Cold War.  \nAs such, this forum is extremely timely, posing a series of important questions about \nthe relationship between history and International Relations, and questioning the status of \nIR\u2019s recent historical (re)turn. The general issue is a pressing one because Fred Northedge\u2019s \noriginal goal in setting up Millennium was to provide a (British) counterweight to the \n\u2018ahistorical positivist project\u2019 that had engulfed mainstream American IR. Thus by bringing \nhistory back in, albeit in a critical way, Northedge\u2019s thinking reflected a now commonly held \nassumption: that there is a trans-Atlantic divide that separates a historically informed British \nIR against a history-less U.S. mainstream. And in turn, these perceptions form the basis of the \ncurrent forum.  \nBut in certain key respects, we want to argue that these perceptions \u2013 common as they \nare \u2013 are misrepresentations, reflecting a series of widely-held antinomies that are falsely \nassumed to underpin the discipline. The juxtaposition of history-less\/ahistorical U.S. IR \nversus British historical IR is misleading because history is important to mainstream U.S. IR \n(as we explain in the first section). Moreover, we also find problematic the type of binary \nengendered by Robert Cox\u2019s distinction between critical (historical) theory and history-\nless\/ahistorical problem-solving theory. The problem with this formulation is that it occludes \na deeper, more fundamental issue, one which is rarely overtly discussed: the question of \n                                                 \n1 We would particularly like to thank Justin Rosenberg for his pertinent advice though, of \ncourse, we take final responsibility. \n2 Martin Wight, \u2018Why is there no international theory?\u2019 In Diplomatic Investigations: Essays \nin the Theory of International Politics, eds. Herbert Butterfield and Martin Wight (London: \nAllen & Unwin, 1966), 17-34. \n \n3 \nwhether there is a single mode of historical research in IR. 3 In this article we unravel this \nclaim by posing the question: \u2018what is history in IR?\u2019 In the process, the second section of the \npiece outlines four modes of history in IR, all of which can be situated along a continuum \nranging from macro- to micro-analysis, all of which provide different visions of history, and \nall of which deploy history in different ways. This move means searching above and beyond \nthe binaries posed by this forum, whether considered as positivism vs. post-positivism, or as \nan apparently unbridgeable trans-Atlantic divide. In fact, our contention is that the central \nissue when it comes to understanding the relationship between history and IR is not one of \n\u2018British historical IR vs. American non-historical IR\u2019, nor one of post-positivist \u2018pure history\u2019 \nvs. traditional ahistorical positivism. Rather, our portrayal of four ideal-typical modes of \nhistorical research presents quite different points of departure for considering the history-\ntheory relationship, which in turn has potentially important ramifications for the way that we \n\u2018do\u2019 IR theory. And equally importantly, once we set-up this heuristic, we find that the \nprincipal camps in the so-called \u2018history wars\u2019 \u2013 namely traditional (positivist) historians and \ncritical (poststructuralist-inspired) historiographers \u2013 turn out to occupy a space surprisingly \nclose together.  \nAsking the question \u2018what is history\u2019, therefore, leads us to a deeper understanding of \nthe relationship between history and IR. Although representatives of these various historical \nmodes of explanation often engage in forms of one-upmanship over what constitutes \u2018true\u2019 or \n\u2018proper\u2019 historical analysis, our central claim is that all four approaches can be seen as \nlegitimate modes of historical analysis. In short, we need to recognise that no-one \u2018owns\u2019 \nhistory. As such, our advocacy of one of these modes of analysis \u2013 historicist historical \nsociology \u2013 is made not on the basis that it delivers a truer form of historical analysis. Rather, \nwe claim that the main benefit of historical sociology lies in its capacity to conduct research \nwhich is both rich historically and fertile theoretically. Justifying this claim, and laying out \nthe core wagers \u2013 both theoretical and empirical \u2013 of historical sociology in IR, is the subject \n                                                 \n3 Notable exceptions include: Nick Vaughan-Williams, \u2018International Relations and the \n\u201cProblem of History\u201d\u2019, Millennium 34, no. 1 (2005): 115-136; Chris Hill, \u2018History and \nInternational Relations\u2019 in Steve Smith (ed.), International Relations: British and American \nExperiences (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985); Ian Clark, \u2018Divided by a common language\u2019, \nGovernment and Opposition 37, no. 2 (2002), 271-279; Caroline Kennedy-Pipe, \n\u2018International History and International Relations, International Affairs 76, no. 4 (2000): 741-\n754; and Zara Steiner, \u2018On writing international history\u2019, International Affairs 73, no. 3 \n(1997): 531-546.

In the conclusion we briefly outline the consequences of \nsuch a move \u2013 most notably a shift towards seeing historical sociology at the centre of IR as a \ndiscipline.  \n \n \nThe eternal transatlantic divide? \n \nWhile most scholars have tended to treat neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism as the \nrepresentatives of mainstream U.S. IR, we would now surely have to include constructivism \nas the third prong in what can now be considered a triumvirate.4 This immediately blurs the \nclaim that mainstream U.S. IR is ahistorical. For while there are clearly many varieties of \nconstructivist IR, all versions reject a neo-neo instrumentalist rational actor model in which \nactors\u2019 interests are pre-determined and universal through time and place. As such, \nconstructivism is propelled towards accounts of time and place specificity, context and \nchange, rendering it necessarily historical and sociological in orientation. Indeed, it fits \nunproblematically into the mode of historicist historical sociology in IR. However, although \nconstructivists occupy an important place on the history-IR spectrum, it is not the case that \nneo-neo approaches lie outside of it.5 Even the apparently archetypal version of ahistoricist \nIR \u2013Waltzian neorealism \u2013 has been historically \u2018filled-in\u2019 by theorists such as Robert Gilpin, \nJohn Mearsheimer, and Colin and Miriam Elman.6 Robert Keohane, Lisa Martin and others \nhave applied historical analysis to a rational choice neo-liberal institutionalist research \n                                                 \n4 Indeed, this point is becoming increasingly accepted. See, for example, Robert Gilpin, \nGlobal Political Economy (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001). Legro and \nMoravcsik invite constructivists into a \u2018meta-paradigm\u2019 that acts as an umbrella within which \nmainstream approaches can operate; see Jeffrey W. Legro and Andrew Moravcsik, \u2018Is \nAnybody Still a Realist?\u2019 International Security 24, no. 2 (1999), 5-55.

Norton, \n2003); Colin Elman and Miriam Elman (eds.), Bridges and Boundaries (Cambridge, MA: \nMIT Press, 2001). \n \n5 \nagenda.7 And historical research is germane to the work of neo-classical realists such as \nRandall Schweller (as much as it was to Hans Morgenthau and E.H. Carr before them).8  \nOf course, because many readers will question this claim, particularly in relation to \nneorealism, it is worth dwelling on this point for a moment. For while many would accept \nthat neorealism deploys historical analysis, nevertheless the theory is seen as problematic \nbecause it is unable to explain international change \u2013 especially systems change \u2013 through \nhistorical time. This claim was first made in some of the key critical works of the early \n1980s, most notably those of John Ruggie, Richard Ashley and Robert Cox. Since then it has \nbecome an axiom of critical theory that neorealism \u2018contains only a reproductive logic, but no \ntransformational logic\u2019;9 that neorealism is a \u2018historicism of stasis; [one that] freezes the \npolitical institutions of the current world order\u2019;10 or that \u2018[p]roblem-solving [neorealist] \ntheory is non-historical or ahistorical, since it, in effect, posits a continuing present\u2019.11  \nThe immediate problem with this position is that neorealism can explain systems \nchange. Thus, for example, Robert Gilpin has argued that changes in the international system \n\u2013 caused by states\u2019 responses to the escalations of military costs experienced during the \nEuropean Military Revolution (1550-1660) \u2013 induced the transformation of feudal \nChristendom into the modern sovereign state system.12 No less importantly, this argument \ncould be made within a pure Waltzian framework, albeit one which has largely been \ndeveloped outside the discipline.13 Even so, Gilpin\u2019s account holds closely to the Waltzian \n                                                 \n7 Robert O.

Despite the claims made by numerous critical \nscholars, it would be fairer to say that Waltz sought not to banish history or historical analysis \nfrom IR but historicist conceptions of the international from the discipline (a point we return \nto in the next section).19 And more generally, the return of classical liberalism, the rise of \nneoclassical realism and constructivism, and the reconvening of approaches like the English \nSchool marks less the emergence of a historical turn in IR, but more an acceleration and \ndeepening of trends already present in the discipline; trends which, it should be noted, can be \n                                                 \n14 See Hobson, State and International Relations, ch. 2. \n15 For the former see Gilpin, War and Change; Gautam Sen, The Military Origins of \nIndustrialisation and International Trade Rivalry (London: Pinter, 1984); and for the latter \nsee Randall Collins, Weberian Sociological Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n1986), ch. 2; Jean Baechler, The Origins of Capitalism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1975); Charles \nTilly, Coercion, Capital and European States, AD. 990-1990 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990). \n16 On this see, William Wohlforth, \u2018Realism and the End of the Cold War\u2019, International \nSecurity 19, no. 3 (Winter 1994\/5): 91-129.  \n17 Collins, Weberian Sociological Theory, ch. 8. \n18 Kenneth N.

On this specific criticism, see Barry Buzan, Charles Jones, and \nRichard Little, The Logic of Anarchy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993).  \n19 See especially, Kenneth N.

Given this, it may be that the standard claim needs to be turned on its \nhead. Rather than marginal historical voices facing an ahistorical mainstream, perhaps we are \nall, and have always been, historians after all. And if this is the case, we need to ask whether \nNorthedge\u2019s original rationale for setting up Millennium still stands up, or indeed if it ever \ndid. Moreover, if it is the case that we are \u2018all historians in IR\u2019, this begs an important \nquestion: what is it we are talking about when we talk about history? \n \n \nFour modes of \u2018History in IR\u2019 \n \nFundamental to our argument is the claim that there is no single mode of historical research \nin IR. Rather we see there as being four principal modes of historical enquiry, the excavation \nof which enables us to move beyond the current confusion that surrounds the way in which \nhistory is used in the discipline. We label these four ideal-typical modes: \u2018history without \nhistoricism\u2019, \u2018historicist historical sociology\u2019, \u2018radical historicism\u2019, and \u2018traditional history\u2019 \n(as represented in Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1: Four modes of history in IR \n \nINSERT FIG 1 HERE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 On this see especially, Brian C. Schmidt, The Political Discourse of Anarchy (New York: \nSUNY Press, 1998). \n \n8 \n \nThe immediate point to note is that these four ideal-types are situated along a continuum \nranging from the macro to the micro. Thus, while neorealist historical analysis occupies the \nhighest level of generality, radical historicism represents its converse. Our own preferred \napproach is that of historicist historical sociology, which overlaps with the other three modes. \nSignificantly, for all the heat of the \u2018history wars\u2019 that have taken place between critical \nhistoriographers and traditional historians, we see these two modes as having much in \ncommon, hence their overlapping representation in Figure 1. Our argument is that, answers to \nthe question \u2018what is history in IR\u2019 will necessarily vary according to where the researcher \nsits on this continuum. Until we recognise this point, we shall be talking at cross-purposes, \nindeed speaking different \u2018historical\u2019 languages. In turn, this induces misunderstandings at \nthe heart of the discipline and confusion over fundamental questions surrounding the nature \nof IR theory and how we \u2018do\u2019 historically informed research. In what follows, we take the \ntwo extremes that are situated at the poles of Figure 1 before proceeding to discuss traditional \nhistory and culminating in our preferred mode of analysis \u2013 historicist historical sociology.   \n \nHistory without historicism \nThus far we have noted that neorealism not only utilises and explores history but can also \nexplain international systems change through time. Accordingly, this marks neorealist \nhistoriography as a legitimate mode of history in IR. By the same token, neoliberal \ninstitutionalism would also feature as an example of this kind of history. However, a common \nHighest level \nof generality\n(Mega-macro)\nLowest level \nof generality\n(Micro)\nMid-point\n(Meso)\nHistory without \nHistoricism\n(Constructionism)\nTraditional \nHistory\n(Particularism)\n  Radical   \n   Historicism   \n  (Deconstructionism)\nHistoricist Historical Sociology\n(Constructionism, Particularism,\nDeconstructionism\/Reconstructionism)\n \n9 \nclaim (often made by constructivists) asserts that neoliberal institutionalism and neorealism \nare ahistorical and asociological on account of their assumption that actors are imbued with \ntimeless essential properties that are pre-social.21 But the immediate problem here can be \ndiscussed through an analogous consideration of rational choice theorists working in the \ndiscipline of historical sociology. If the common IR perception is correct, then we would be \nforced to denounce prominent (rational choice) historical sociologists such as Douglass \nNorth, Margaret Levi and Edgar Kiser as ahistorical and asociological.22 And by implication \nit would mean that the many historical sociologists who use either implicit neorealist \nanalytical or rational choice theoretical lenses are not, after all, historical sociologists; the \nend-point of which is to render the very term \u2018historical sociology\u2019 a misnomer.  \n Interestingly, debates on history\/historical sociology within the discipline of historical \nsociology provide a mirror for the debates on history which we discuss in this article.23 In \nparticular, Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter have advocated a form of rational choice \u2018grand \nnarrative\u2019 historical-sociology, one which marries well with the kind of approach used by \nneorealists and neoliberal institutionalists.24 Kiser and Hechter invoke a mode of historical \nenquiry that operationalises the highest abstract \u2018scope conditions\u2019. As they put it, \n\u2018[h]istorically defined scope conditions are based on particular spatial and temporal \nparameters (e.g., a given argument may only apply to 17th century France). In contrast, \nabstract scope conditions merely contain general specifications of conditions that could exist \nin many times and places\u2019.25 In particular, they object to the arguments of Quadagno and \nKnapp who, in effect, argue for an historicist approach that rejects transhistorical categories \n                                                 \n21 E.g., Chris Reus-Smit, \u2018The Idea of History and History with Ideas\u2019, in Historical \nSociology of International Relations, eds.

Accordingly, the use of the term \u2018historically defined scope conditions\u2019 might be \nbetter expressed as \u2018historicist\u2019 scope conditions. For in our conception, \u2018historicism\u2019 \u2013 \ncontra the ways in which it is frequently used, eg., from Karl Popper to Dipesh Chakrabarty26 \n\u2013 is a mode of historical enquiry that recognises the specificity of events within their \ntemporal and spatial contexts and rejects transhistorical categories that render history as \nexhibiting isomorphic properties. Accordingly, we term this mode \u2018history without \nhistoricism\u2019.   \n This mode of enquiry, Kiser and Hechter argue, has the virtue of establishing \ngeneral\/universalist propositions that can be applied across time and place. That is, they seek \nto construct not just a narrative but a grand narrative that has universal application. In turn, \nthis means that their theoretical arguments are amenable to testing, thereby conforming to \nwhat they would consider to be strict social scientific criteria. And it also means that their \napproach is geared at predicting events either as they unfold or as they might unfold in the \nfuture. In support of this argument, one might even go so far as to ask rhetorically that if \nhistory provides no lessons for the present or the future then what utility does it have and, by \nimplication, what is the purpose of studying it? Moreover, Kiser and Hechter note, \u2018[w]e \nthink that science progresses by testing clear general propositions and by attempting to \nresolve the anomalies that this testing process invariably reveals\u2019.27 And, not surprisingly, \nthis leads them to argue that such an historical mode of research is important because it \nallows the fulfilment of coherent research programs.  \n The summary produced by Kiser and Hechter reproduces the essence of \u2018history \nwithout historicism\u2019; a mode of history that underpins neorealism and neoliberal \ninstitutionalism within IR. Indeed all the criteria that they stipulate concerning an adequate \nhistorical sociology conform precisely to those laid down by neorealists (including Kenneth \nWaltz). And inverting the point made earlier, if Kiser and Hechter\u2019s approach is a legitimate \nmode of historical sociology then by implication one might label neorealism and neoliberal \ninstitutionalism as representing a legitimate mode of historical enquiry.  \nIn this mode of historical analysis in an IR context, history takes on the role of \n\u2018scripture\u2019 \u2013 as the application of \u2018lessons\u2019 and inviolate rules that can be used to inform \ncurrent policy and support research hypotheses. So, for example, the \u2018lessons of Nazi \n                                                 \n26 Karl Popper, The Poverty of Historicism (London: Routledge, 2002); Dipesh Chakrabarty, \nProvincializing Europe (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000).  \n27 Kiser and Hechter, \u2018Debate on Historical Sociology\u2019, 788. \n \n11 \nappeasement\u2019 become a shorthand for the necessity of confronting dictatorial regimes across \ntime and place; the U.S. retreat from Vietnam is invoked to halt talk of withdrawal in Iraq; \nand the Reagan years are employed to support the idea that ultimate victory in the \u2018war on \nterror\u2019 rests on the deployment of overwhelming U.S. military superiority married to the \npromotion \u2013 by force if necessary \u2013 of democratic ideals around the world.28 All in all, \nhistory without historicism provides a potentially rich stream of data, producing lessons and \nacting as test-cases for deductively derived hypothesis. \n \nRadical Historicism \nMoving to the other extreme (situated on the right hand side of Figure 1) we encounter \nradical historicism. This mode of research first emerged within the field of literary criticism. \nIt is based on the premise that a literary work can only be considered as a product of a \nparticular time and place. That is, no text serves as the autonomous product of an author \nunderstood as an isolated creation, but is reflective of a unique cultural and intellectual \nmilieu.29 This is a kind of deep contextualism, one which finds its clearest expression in the \nwork of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. In a recent example of radical historicism in \nIR, Nick Vaughan-Williams argues that the historical turn in IR needs to be deconstructed. \nFor Vaughan-Williams, the idea of history deployed by most scholars of the historical turn in \nIR is ahistorical even to the point of being anti-historical. This new historicism marries up \nwith the poststructuralist conception of IR theory, which subscribes to the radical \nindeterminacy of history. Thus Richard Ashley characterises the prevailing historical \napproaches in IR as akin to \u2018a [form] of representation that arrests ambiguity and controls the \nproliferation of meaning by imposing a standard and a standpoint of interpretation that is \ntaken to be fixed and independent of the time it represents\u2019.30 This tendency, Vaughan-\nWilliams argues, is essentially ahistorical in the first instance because it \n \nimplies the necessity (and possibility) of a stance outside of both history and \npolitics from which it is possible to arrive at a singular understanding of what is \noften referred to as historicity\u2026 Such a stance is of course fantastical. More \nspecifically still [such] an imposition has particularly important implications for IR \n                                                 \n28 See also Markus Kornprobst, \u2018Comparing Apples and Oranges? Leading and Misleading \nUses of Historical Analogies\u2019, Millennium 36, no. 2 (2007): 29-49. \n29 This was first discussed in Stephen Greenblatt, The Power of Forms in the English \nRenaissance (Norman, Oklahoma: Pilgrim Books, 1982). \n30 Richard K. Ashley, \u2018Living on Borderlines: Man, Post-Structuralism, and War\u2019, in \nInternational\/Intertextual Relations, eds. James Der Derian and Michael J. Shapiro (New \nYork: Lexington Books, 1989), 263. \n \n12 \nsince any attempt to stifle the \u2018equivocity of history\u2019 constitutes a violent \ndehistoricisation, which, in turn, may have significant political ramifications.31 \n \nThis reading holds that the truth is not out there simply awaiting discovery. In place of \nthe truth that does not exist, there are many truths \u2013 indeed an undecidable infinity of possible \ntruths. Ultimately this position embraces a view of history as an infinite problem that can \nnever be mastered;32 to attempt to do so is merely to fall back into another totalising grand \nnarrative. And so, for radical historicists, the historically-minded IR scholar (or any historian \nfor that matter) can never arrive at the terminus of historical closure and is, therefore, \nnecessarily stranded on a train journey-without-end. To disembark the train for firmer, stable \nground is to sacrifice the history-ness of history that deconstructionism embraces \u2018in favour \nof an ahistorical \u2013 even anti-historical \u2013 search for certainty, security, and surety in \ninterpretive closure\u2019,33 thereby placing firm historical meaning perpetually out of reach. \nWhat kind of history, then, does radical historicism produce? First and foremost, the \napproach rejects the construction of grand-narratives, thereby placing it at odds with the kind \nof macro-history that neorealist and neoliberal institutionalist IR theory produces. As implied \nabove, reading history either through a theoretical lens or via the construction of a broader \nnarrative is to fall into the trap of \u2018mastering history\u2019 so that it conforms to particular political \nand ideological ends. As such, the point of \u2018doing history\u2019 is to resist an attempt at \u2018mastery\u2019. \nRather, deconstruction \u2013 either of the events themselves or of the histories that are \nconstructed by historians\/social scientists \u2013 reveals merely the doxa of power-political \npositions that lie beneath. \nTypical examples of this kind of thinking can be found in the postmodern wing of \npostcolonial studies and postcolonial International Relations. Following Edward Said,34 all \nmodernist histories of the rise and development of the modern world or the modern \ninternational system are to be deconstructed to reveal the underlying Eurocentric\/Orientalist \nmetanarrative that informs them.35 In the process, such analyses reveal how major theories \nunwittingly reflect the hegemonic aspirations of the West. Moreover, these theories do not \nmerely reflect, but also provide a sanctioning, legitimating function that constitutes Western \nthinking as imperialist-hegemonic. Likewise, such an approach seeks to reveal how Western \n                                                 \n31 Vaughan-Williams, \u2018Problem of History\u2019, 117-118. \n32 See Jacques Derrida, The Gift of Death (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995). \n33 Vaughan-Williams, \u2018Problem of History\u2019, 131. \n34 Edward W. Said, Orientalism (London: Penguin, 1978). \n35 E.g. Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe. \n \n13 \nactions ultimately reflect a Eurocentric\/Orientalist posture towards the non-West.36 And in \nstrong contrast to the constructionist-narrative approach of mega-macro history, this mode \ninsists on \u2018deconstruction without reconstruction\u2019 since reconstruction merely leads back into \nthe cul-de-sac of a totalising grand narrative. Moreover, many go so far as to argue that \nbecause all attempts at writing history must conform to power-knowledge nexuses, \nreconstructing historical narratives should be avoided since this would act merely to replace \none form of domination (Eurocentrism\/Orientalism) with another (eg., Occidentalism).37 \nAccordingly, radical historicism provides the antithesis of the grand-scale constructionism of \nthe mega-macro approach.  \n \nTraditional History \nThus far we have differentiated between the two extremes represented in Figure 1 \u2013 \nconstructionist \u2018history without historicism\u2019 and deconstructionist \u2018radical historicism\u2019. At \none level, this might appear curious in that, as anyone familiar with the \u2018history wars\u2019 will \nknow, the main combatants are traditional historians and critical historiographers. In our \nrepresentation, rather than being diametrically opposed, these positions have much in \ncommon, so much so that they are represented as overlapping categories in Figure 1. As such, \nit makes sense to begin by briefly considering the issues that underlie the history wars before \nproceeding to consider the important similarities between traditional history and radical \nhistoricism. \nThe main issue at stake in the history wars revolves around the difference between \npositivist research and deconstructionism.38 Radical historicists reject the test as to what \n                                                 \n36 E.g.

Paolini, Navigating Modernity (London: Lynne Rienner, 1999); Pal \nAhluwalia, Politics and Post-Colonial Theory (London: Routledge, 2001); Naeem \nInayatullah and David L.

Evans, In Defence of History (London: Granta, \n2001). For the critical historiographical position, see Hayden White, The Content of the Form \n(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987); Hayden White, Metahistory (Baltimore: \nJohns Hopkins University Press, 1974); and Keith Jenkins, Re-thinking History (London: \nRoutledge, 1991). For a pertinent summary within an IR context see Vaughan-Williams \n \n14 \nconstitutes \u2018proper history\u2019, at least in the way that this is deployed by traditional historians. \nIn the traditionalist conception, \u2018proper history\u2019 is based on a Rankerean positivist \nmethodology in that the fact-value distinction enables the historian to generate a form of \ntruth, at least as far as this is accessible via appropriate training, archival research and \nimmersion in primary documents. Traditional historians are comfortable with the view that \nthere is a world \u2018out there\u2019 which can be explained via considered, learned historical analysis. \nA rigorous \u2018objective\/a-theoretical\u2019 approach to relics (archives\/primary documents) is vital \nto this process. Ultimately though, a causal analysis of any event is attainable such that \ncritical deconstructionism is seen as making non-sense of history, thereby leading to the \nfamiliar accusations of nihilism and anti-historical posturing. Moreover, traditional historians \ncomplain that radical historicists essentially mock history. As one prominent positivist \nhistorian writes: \u2018Auschwitz was not a discourse. It trivialises mass murder to see it as a text. \nThe gas chambers were not a piece of rhetoric. Auschwitz was indeed inherently a tragedy \nand cannot be seen as either a comedy or a farce\u2019.39  \nTraditional historians reject the application of aprioristic theoretical templates to the \nstudy of history, thereby differentiating themselves from those modes of history that are \nsituated on the left-hand side of Figure 1 (i.e. mega-macro history and historicist historical \nsociology). Viewing history through theoretical lenses is seen as futile. Indeed, theoretically-\ninformed approaches are denounced not just for their theoretical apriorism but also for their \nreliance on secondary sources. This, in turn, leads to the claim that such approaches are either \ngrand-syntheses or simply \u2018make-believe\u2019 versions of the \u2018true\u2019 historical record, in which \ntheoretically-informed scholars select the \u2018facts\u2019 in advance without holding them to \nobjective scrutiny. Overall, traditional historians dismiss theoretically-informed historical \napproaches for simply \u2018making up history\u2019 in pursuit of a theoretical vision and compressing \nor forcing the complexities of history into facile pigeon-holes.40  \nHowever, it could be argued that, with the exception of the sacrosanct status accorded \nto \u2018facts\u2019 and relics, these objections are not really so different to the denouncements made by \nradical historicists of theoretically-informed historical narratives. Both of these apparently \n                                                                                                                                                        \n\u2018\u201cProblem of History\u2019\u201d, 119-125. And for an equally pertinent summary of the traditional and \nnew critical variants of International History see Finney, \u2018Still \u201cMarking Time\u201d\u2019, 291-309. \n39 Evans, Defence of History, 124. \n40 It is noteworthy that one traditional historian was said to have claimed in a private \nconversation that he revelled in undertaking historical research into the problems of Northern \nIreland because in the process he had managed to undermine every general theory that has \never been applied to this case.  \n \n15 \nantithetical modes of analysis exhibit incredulity to grand narratives. Both see such visions as \nunhistorical and presentist. Both fetishise the particular in order to resist the pitfalls of a \ngrand narrative; indeed their immediate shared instinct is to particularise. Both modes trace \nhow one-thing-followed-another in an unfolding of events that is deemed to be so contingent \nas to be unreplicable. Both agree that such approaches impose dangerous ideological visions \non world history. Thus where traditional historians see such visions as \u2018bad historical \npolemic\u2019, radical historicists see them as \u2018ahistorical totalising projects\u2019. And, of course, both \ntend to deride transhistorical attempts to present universalist pictures of causation that range \nacross time and place. In this sense both approaches in effect place broad theoretical findings \nout of reach. Indeed, both traditional historians and radical historicists deconstruct grand \nnarratives while refusing, albeit for different reasons, to reconstruct an alternative.  \nThus despite their epistemological differences (which have captured all the \nheadlines), traditional historians and radical historicists converge around a tendency to \nparticularism and in a shared resistance to theoretically-inspired narratives. As such, both \napproaches are far more alike then they would care to think, at least about the make-up of the \nsocial world and the possibility of historical theorisation. Thus although the history wars \nevidenced a tremendous amount of heat, this appears inversely proportional to the amount of \nlight that the debate emits. For behind the fire and brimstone lies a far less melodramatic, but \nmuch more important, set of shared assumptions, assumptions that are unacknowledged. \n  \nHistoricist Historical sociology  \nThe fourth mode of historical analysis \u2013 historicist historical sociology \u2013 occupies a central \nplace on our diagram. As such, it overlaps with the other three modes of analysis and, \nimportantly, contains many self-defined historical sociologists and potentially other historians \nwho might consider their primary identity as situated outside of the traditional conception of \nhistory. Indeed, it could be argued that one of the major figures associated with the view of \nhistory employed by historicist historical sociologists is E.H. Carr. In his now classic \nTrevelyan lectures, Carr delved behind some of the most prominent myths about both history \nand theory to ask an apparently simple, yet also disarmingly difficult, question: what is \nhistory?41  \nCarr\u2019s work helps point up the cues that differentiate historicist historical sociology \nfrom the other modes that we have outlined here. In essence, the mega-macro, positivist \n                                                 \n41 E.H. Carr, What is History? (London: Pelican, 1964). \n \n16 \ntheory-builders envisage history as \u2018abstracted scripture\u2019, while radical historicists and \ntraditional historians view it as akin to a random series of isolated movements, or as  \n\u2018contingent butterfly\u2019. Thus where one fetishises general abstractions, the others fetishise the \nparticular. The mega-macro conception relates history in which all discontinuities are ironed \nout through creating isomorphic transhistorical categories. Traditional history and radical \nhistoricism obscure the sense in which history is a social process, one in which contingent \nhistorical events, dramas and processes are part of broader interrelations, sequences, plots and \nconcatenations which provide a shape \u2013 however difficult to discern \u2013 within historical \ndevelopment. For Carr, not unlike radical historicists but in clear contrast to the practice of \ntraditional historians, the first step in studying history is to study both the historian and the \nbroader context (the historical, social, political, economic environment) within which (s)he \ncarries out research and within which historical facts are accumulated. Thus the fact that \nhistorical relics never speak for themselves but are embedded within broader social matrices \nmeans that there can be no absolute truth about the past in the way promoted by traditional \nhistorians. This means that historicism is closely linked to the idea of contextualism that was \ndeveloped by the likes of Quentin Skinner in the \u2018Cambridge School\u2019.42 \nCarr as well as Skinner are not the only historians who contribute to historicist \nhistorical sociology. For example, Carl Becker famously questioned the status of historical \nfacts, seeing them as symbolic, contextual constellations made up from a thousand or more \ndiscarded events which both surrounded and sustained them.43 R.G. Collingwood argued that \nhistory revealed the mind of the historian, promoting a form of neo-Hegelian \u2018historical \nimagination\u2019 in which history became little more than the history of ideas and historical \nresearch the re-enactment of past.44 And Carr himself argued that history was a \u2018selective \nsystem\u2019, an inherently social process best considered as a dialogue between past and present \nsocieties. For Carr, historical explanations are inherently approximate. This does not mean \nthe end of adequate historical explanation. Rather, the conversation between past, present and \nfuture contained within Carr\u2019s vision of historical method means that the historian\u2019s task \nbecomes that of differentiating between significant and accidental causes, providing \n                                                 \n42 Quentin Skinner, Visions of Politics: Regarding Method (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2002). For a discussion of this in an IR-context see, Duncan Bell, \u2018Political \ntheory and the functions of intellectual history\u2019, Review of International Studies 29, no. 1 \n(2003): 151-60. \n43 Carl Becker, \u2018What are historical facts?\u2019, The Western Political Quarterly 8, no. 3 (1955): \n327-40. On contextual constellations, see Leonard Seabrooke, \u2018Why Political Economy \nNeeds Historical Sociology\u2019, International Politics 44, no. 4 (2007): 390-413. \n44 R.G. Collingwood, The Idea of History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994). \n \n17 \nintelligible meaning in a world of incessant change and contestation, and remaining open to \nnew facts, interpretations and explanations of a subject.45 Such an understanding of history \nlies at the heart of historicist historical sociology.  \nBut in the process historicist historical sociology also draws in many ways from \nvarious aspects of the other three modes. Epistemologically, historicist historical sociology \nstands between the constructionist mega-macro approach at one extreme and the micro \napproaches of deconstructionist radical historicism and traditional history at the other. Contra \nradical historicists, historicist historical sociologists accept that history is knowable but, pace \ntraditional historians, they insist that traditional historians cannot claim to be speaking an \nobjective truth insofar as history is produced within a certain time and place and subject to \nthe interpretations of its practitioners. Moreover, further echoing radical historicists, some of \nthese historical sociologists aim to deconstruct historical narratives on the grounds, for \nexample, of their implicit Eurocentrism. But contra the new historicists, these historical \nsociologists then seek to reconstruct history along non-Eurocentric lines.46 Echoing the \nmega-macro approach, historicist historical sociology seeks out general patterns of causation \nand development. But echoing traditional history, it also places emphasis on historical \ndiscontinuities and rejects transhistoricism. In short, this approach recognises the role of \naccident, contingency, agency, contextuality and particularity alongside that played by \nstructure and continuity. Thus, if traditional historians and new historicists reify contingency, \ndiscontinuity and particularity while macro approaches reify structural continuities, this \nmiddle-ground historicism seeks to grasp all of these categories. As such, historicist historical \nsociology claims to be able to \u2018do it all\u2019.  \nThe upshot of this claim is that the assumption of diametrically opposed modes of \nhistory obscures the point that historicist historical sociology can reconcile some, though by \nno means all, of the differences. And resolving differences where possible seems a more \nproductive way to move forward than to insist on preserving differences through gatekeeping \nexercises or the policing of borders. \n \n \n                                                 \n45 Of course, this is a task Carr performed himself, not least in his definitive accounts of the \nRussian revolution and its aftermath.   \n46 See for example: Janet L. Abu-Lughod, Before European Hegemony (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1989); Andre Gunder Frank, ReOrient (Berkeley: University of California \nPress, 1998); J.M. Hobson, The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation (Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press, 2004).  \n \n18 \nThe three waves of Historical Sociology in IR? \n \nBecause elsewhere we have presented overviews of the development of historical sociology \nin IR (HSIR from henceforth),47 we shall provide only a potted summary here. It is possible \nto discern two waves of HSIR, with a third-wave now in the offing. The first emerged \nthrough the writings of figures such as Michael Mann, Theda Skocpol, Anthony Giddens and \nCharles Tilly. However, since the mid-1990s, a second wave has emerged which takes issue \nwith neorealism (as well as the implicit neorealism that underpins the conception of the \ninternational contained in the first wave).48 \nOne theme that underpins the second wave concerns the objective of overcoming \n\u2018tempocentrism\u2019; something which pervades neorealist historiography. Tempocentric history \ntakes a reified present and extrapolates this back in time to render all history amenable to \ntranshistorical, universalist analysis.49 Neorealists, for example, take the \u2018fact\u2019 of \ncontemporary \u2018anarchy\u2019 and effectively extrapolate this back in time, removing the ruptures \nthat punctuate the world-historical longue dur\u00e9e. As such, neorealist \u2018history without \nhistoricism\u2019 is a form of inverted path-dependency in which all actors and, indeed, the \ninternational system itself, are presented as homologous or isomorphic. Thus we are told that \nthe superpower contest between the United States and the Soviet Union finds its historical \nequivalent in the conflict between Athens and Sparta; that ancient imperialism is equivalent \nto that found in Europe between 1492 through to the twentieth century;50 or that European \nfeudal heteronomy is equivalent in its modus operandi to that of the modern international \n                                                 \n47 E.g., J.M. Hobson, \u2018What\u2019s at Stake in \u201cBringing Historical Sociology Back into \nInternational Relations\u201d? Transcending \u201cChronofetishism\u201d and Tempocentrism\u201d in \nInternational Relations\u2019, in Historical Sociology of International Relations, eds. Hobden and \nHobson, 3-41; J.M. Hobson, \u2018Historical Sociology\u2019, in Routledge Encyclopedia of \nInternational Relations and Global Politics, ed.

On this point, see: Hobden, International Relations; \nHobson, State and International Relations, ch. 6. See also the discussions by George Lawson, \nJohn Hobson and Fred Halliday in the forum on Michael Mann in Millennium 34, no. 2 \n(2006): 476-550. \n49 Hobson, \u2018What\u2019s at Stake?\u2019, 9-15. \n50 See especially Waltz, Theory, ch. 2. \n \n19 \nsystem.51 Likewise, this approach induces tempocentric statements such as the \u2018classic \nhistory of Thucydides is as meaningful a guide to the behavior of states today as when it was \nwritten in the fifth century BC\u2019;52 or that \u2018balance of power politics in much the form that we \nknow it has been practiced over the millennia by many different types of political units, from \nancient China and India, to the Greek and Italian city states, and unto our own day\u2019.53 Thus \nterms such as sovereignty, balance of power and anarchy are employed without due regard \nfor time and place specificity; instead they take on a stable, fixed transhistorical meaning.54  \nThe antidote that second-wave HSIR scholars provide is not so much a reversion to \nextreme particularity (as in traditional history) but an historicist approach which is able to \nconstruct a narrative while simultaneously being open to issues of contingency, unintended \nconsequences, particularity and contextuality. And a further key difference between this \nsecond-wave HSIR and neorealist \u2018history without historicism\u2019 concerns the former\u2019s \nemphasis on social structure. Utilising this approach, second-wave scholars have looked to \ntranscend the tempocentrism of neorealist historiography and first wave HSIR by seeking to \nreveal the differing social contexts that inform the conduct and constitution of international \nrelations.55 In the process they are able to show how contemporary world politics is \nhistorically double-edged; having one foot in the past but also being in certain respects \nunique. And they are able to reveal how international systems and international actors change \ntheir identities and forms over time according to differing social contexts. For the most part \nthe various ways in which this has taken place differ along ontological lines, with \nepistemological issues taking a secondary role within HSIR.56  \n                                                 \n51 Markus Fischer, \u2018Feudal Europe, 800-1300: Communal Discourses and Conflictual \nPractices\u2019, International Organization 46, no. 2 (1992): 427-466.

See, \nfor example, Stuart Kaufman, Richard Little and William Wohlforth (eds.), Balance of Power \nin World History (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2007). \n55 In addition to the contributions to the edited volume, Historical Sociology of International \nRelations, second-wave HSIR has also been showcased in various journal fora: Review of \nInternational Political Economy 5, no. 2 (1998): 284-361 comprising John Hobson, Hendrik \nSpruyt, Sandra Halperin and Martin Shaw; International Politics 44, no. 4 (2007): 341-449, \ncomprising George Lawson, Roland Dannreuther and James Kennedy, Leonard Seabrooke, John \nHobson, and Bryan Mabee. \n56 And for a postmodernist critique of this emphasis see Steve Smith, \u2018Historical Sociology \nand International Relations Theory\u2019, in Historical Sociology of International Relations, eds. \nHobden and Hobson, 223-43. \n \n20 \nSecond wavers come from a variety of theoretical schools. Marxists have explored \nhow class relations generate diverse forms of international relations across time and place, \nand how these have engendered the rise of important institutions.57 Constructivist and critical \ntheorists have not only problematised the sovereign state,58 but have also revealed how the \nchanging moral purpose of the state generates distinct international institutional \nenvironments,59 discrete forms of national identity,60 and different relations between states \nmore generally.61 English School writers have focussed on the changing social norms that \nunderpin international society,62 as well as on the ways in which international systems shift \nalong a continuum between hierarchy and anarchy.63 Neo-Weberians have demonstrated how \nvarying state-society relations have promoted different international financial systems,64 and \nhave studied the ways in which forms of radical change have both constituted, and been \nconstituted by, their broader relationship with the international realm.65 In this vein, cognate \nwork is being undertaken in \u2018relational HSIR\u2019.66 And, last but not least, HSIR is increasingly \ncontributing to the \u2018civilisational turn\u2019 in IR.67  \n                                                 \n57 Cf.

Although proponents shared an understanding of the importance of \ndiscontinuity, contingency and particularity in international processes, these approaches also \nshared a concern for examining how social structures \u2013 in the form of relatively fixed \nconfigurations of social relations \u2013 shaped international events. As such, historical sociology \noffered a double punch: not just a focus on the historical details of particular dimensions of \ninternational relations, but also an emphasis on causal explanations wherever these were \nlocated, specifying how patterns, configurations and sets of social relations combined in \nparticular contexts to determine certain outcomes. As such, second-wave historical \nsociologists do not just provide historical analysis, but they also generate powerful theoretical \nexplanations.  \nHowever, in recent years, a further move has begun, one with its origins in two \nconcerns. The first is the broadness of second-wave historical sociology and, in particular, \nover whether its \u2018catholicism\u2019 has produced a dilution in the underlying approach.68 This call \nfor heightened specificity is matched by a second concern over the extent to which \u2018the \ninternational\u2019 itself has, as yet, failed to become a core feature of historical sociological \nexplanations, both in IR and further afield. As such, some historical sociologists working in \nIR are beginning to develop a more focussed approach towards illuminating the social logic \nof \u2018the international\u2019. Justin Rosenberg, for example, has argued that the international can be \ntheorised by virtue of the simultaneous existence of plural, but connected, forms of economic, \npolitical and social organisation.69 Indeed, the dialectical relationship between unevenness \nand interactivity sees historical development itself as, if not following a path of \npredetermined linearity, nevertheless exhibiting certain regularities \u2013 for example the \n\u2018privilege of historical backwardness\u2019 which allows societies to learn from others and leap \nahead via \u2018innovative fusions\u2019 of existing technologies.

Given that this is something that is \nsurprisingly lacking within the discipline of IR, we believe that by tackling this issue head-on \nso HSIR can speak directly to the core issues of IR, thereby helping to promote a much \nstronger convergence of, and direct conversation between, these literatures than has been \nachieved hitherto.71  \n \n \nConclusion: Re-imagining IR  \n \nThe question \u2018what is history in IR\u2019 is not one of importance just to historical sociologists in \nIR. Rather, it is one with major ramifications for the discipline as a whole. As this article has \ndemonstrated, history does not belong to a single theoretical approach: history comes in \nplural modes rather than in singular form. Indeed, history is, in many ways, the lowest \ncommon denominator of the various paradigms within the discipline. Given this, it becomes \nparticularly important to establish precisely what we mean by \u2018history in IR\u2019. In the process, \nwe find that there is not one but four different ways of \u2018doing\u2019 history in IR. And the \nscholar\u2019s choice of a particular mode of history becomes constitutive of the way in which \n(s)he theorises and understands international relations (as much as vice versa).  \nAccordingly, if we are all historians now, we are differentiated not simply by our \nchoice of theory but also by our selection of a particular historical mode of explanation. \nRevealing these four modes of history in IR provides a hitherto obscured organising \ndimension of the discipline. Beyond simple binaries such as \u2018critical theory vs. problem-\nsolving theory\u2019, \u2018British vs. American IR\u2019, or \u2018mainstream vs. non-mainstream theories\u2019 lies a \ncomplex network of promiscuous linkages, interactions and synergies, as well as some sharp \ndifferences, that underpin \u2018histories in IR\u2019. Taking such a view necessarily complicates our \n                                                 \n70 Michael Mann, The Sources of Social Power, I (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n1986); Ernest Gellner, Thought and Change (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1964); \nAnthony Giddens, The Nation-State and Violence (Cambridge: Polity, 1985); William \nSewell, Logics of History (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2005). \n71 See J.M.

In short, therefore, recognising a more complex picture of \nhistory in IR could allow both for more fruitful dialogue between IR scholars and enable the \ndiscipline to be re-imagined beyond some of its more obfuscatory constructs. In this way, it \nbecomes possible both to see, and to potentially transcend, some of the current limits of the \ninternational imagination. \n"}
