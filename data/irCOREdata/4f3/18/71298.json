After London, the north-\nwest of England is the most densely populated of all regions in England and Wales, with\nthe population of Liverpool standing at around 450,000. LE itself is said to have developed\nin the middle of the 19th century, after rapid immigration from Ireland during the Irish\npotato famines of 1845\u20131847 (see Knowles 1973). Arguably as a result of this immigration,\nas we will see, there are some similarities between LE\u2019s phonological system and those of\nIrish Englishes. Of course, as we might expect, the phonological system of LE maintains its\nconnection with other northern Englishes, too.\nThere is a greater amount of previous work on LE than on many other accents of British\nEnglish, particularly other varieties of the north-west of the country. The earliest systematic\nstudy of LE, Knowles (1973), remains the seminal work and is where the widest range\nof phonological features is considered. Later work, including De Lyon (1981), Honeybone\n(2001), Sangster (2001) and Watson (2006, 2007), has tended to restrict its focus to a smaller\nnumber of variables which are amongst the variety\u2019s most characteristic features. This article\nbases most of its descriptive detail on data gathered during fieldwork carried out by the\nauthor (see Watson 2007), but at times information is gleaned from elsewhere (most notably\nKnowles\u2019 early work) to provide comparison.\nThe transcription of the reading passage is based on the speech of a 21-year-old working-\nclass female speaker who was born in the district of Netherton, in the north of Liverpool,\nand has always lived there. She self-identifies as having a \u2018broad\u2019 Liverpool accent, although\nthe difficulty in remaining objective about such labels should be acknowledged. There is\nconsiderable phonetic variation in LE according to age, gender and socioeconomic class,\nalthough this is an area where modern research is lacking. In what follows, where the speaker\nproduces some phonetic feature which is known to be atypical of LE or where a feature varies\naccording to some sociolinguistic parameter, this will be pointed out.\nConsonants\nWhilst the consonant system of LE is phonologically identical to most other varieties of\nEnglish English, there is much allophonic variability. Of course, this is to be expected in\nevery variety, but as we will see, the realisational potential of certain LE phonemes is much\ngreater than elsewhere.\nJournal of the International Phonetic Association (2007) 37\/3 C\u00a9 International Phonetic Association\ndoi:10.1017\/S0025100307003180 Printed in the United Kingdom\n352 Journal of the International Phonetic Association: Illustrations of the IPA\nBilabial\nLabio-\ndental Dental Alveolar\nPost-\nalveolar Palatal Velar Glottal\nPlosive p b t d k g\nAffricate tS dZ\nNasal m n N\nFricative f v T D s z S Z h\nApproximant r j w\nLateral\napproximant\nl\nDental fricatives \/T, D\/ are often realised as dental stops [t 1, d1] both word-initially, medially\nand finally, although dental fricatives are also found. This is arguably a feature which has been\ninnovated into LE from varieties of Irish (Honeybone 2004). It has recently been suggested\nthat TH-fronting, the process by which \/T, D\/ are realised as labiodental fricatives [f, v]\nand which is frequent in many other British varieties (e.g. Milton Keynes, Reading, Hull\n(Williams & Kerswill 1999), Newcastle (Watt & Milroy 1999)), is infrequent in LE (Watson\n2005). The speaker can be heard using both standard fricative variants ([T] in north, [D] in\nother) and the more localised dental stop ([d1] in then). She does not use a labiodental variant.\nPost-vocalic \/r\/ is absent in LE, so that words like car, farm, park are r-less. In pre-\nvocalic and intervocalic positions, \/r\/ is typically realised as [\u00ae] or [|]. The tap is common\nin intervocalic position (e.g. mi[|]or, ve[|]y) but can also occur when \/r\/ follows an onset\nobstruent (e.g. st[|]ip, b[|]eath, f[|]ee). The speaker\u2019s variety is somewhat atypical of basilectal\nLiverpool English in this respect, as she uses the standard variant [\u00ae] in all positions (e.g.\nag[\u00ae]eed, a[\u00ae]ound, st[\u00ae]onger). The tapped realisation of \/r\/ is not categorically absent from\nher repertoire, however, as she uses [|] as the linking \/r\/ in stronger[|] of the two. The\nlabiodental variant, [\u221a], is not a feature of LE, despite it spreading in other accents of British\nEnglish (Foulkes & Docherty 2000).\nLE is similar to other accents in the north of England in that the \/g\/ in \u3008ng\u3009 clusters\nis maintained. For example, the speaker realises along as [\u00b4l\u00c5Ng]. In the \u3008-ing\u3009 morpheme,\nforms with the velar nasal and plosive are found, as in singing [sINgINg], but a realisation of\n[\u00b4n] is also likely (e.g. sing[\u00b4n], walk[\u00b4n]). The speaker uses [\u00b4n] for the \u3008-ing\u3009 of making.\nAnother similarity between LE and elsewhere is the dropping of \/h\/, most often in high\nfrequency grammatical words (e.g. the speaker\u2019s realisation of him, who, his). H-dropping is\nnot categorical, however, as the speaker\u2019s maintenance of [h] in more he blew testifies. \/h\/ is\nfrequently maintained in lexical words (e.g. as it is in the speaker\u2019s hard).\nIt is in the system of plosives where the widest range of phonetic variation is attested. As\nin other varieties of English, voiceless plosives \/p, t, k\/ are aspirated in word-initial position,\nexcept when following syllable initial \/s\/. \/p, t, k\/ can also be aspirated in word-final and\nutterance-final positions (Knowles 1973, Watson 2007). The voiceless stops are frequently\nrealised with noticeable preaspiration utterance-finally, which might manifest itself either as\na period of glottal noise or as oral frication which is produced homorganically to the stop.\nAs is the case in Newcastle (see e.g. Docherty & Foulkes 1999), preaspiration in Liverpool\nEnglish is primarily the domain of female speakers (Watson 2007).\nAs well as these aspirated and preaspirated variants, there is an additional range of plosive\nrealisations which are more or less unique to Liverpool. Most of these realisations can be\ndescribed as processes of LENITION \u2013 a term frequently used to group together a series of\nphonological weakenings which turn underlying plosives into affricates and fricatives (see\ne.g. Lass 1984; Harris 1990, 1994; Honeybone 2002). Indeed, plosive lenition is arguably one\nof the most characteristic features of Liverpool English, and one which forms a major part of\nthe variety\u2019s stereotype.\nKevin Watson: Liverpool English 353\nFor \/t\/, affrication is common word-initially, whilst spirantisation is common in\nintervocalic and word-final positions. The speaker uses an affricated \/t\/ in word-initial\nposition in two (see figure 1). She spirantises \/t\/ as well, but there are a limited number\nof potential candidates in the reading passage due to phonological environment restrictions.\nThe presence of sibilant fricatives for \/t\/ does not lead to the loss of phonological contrast\nwith \/s\/. Honeybone (2001) transcribes lenited \/t\/ as [D] which, following Pandeli et al.\n(1997), implies a fricative with a flat cross-sectional tongue shape (signaled by [T]) at a\nprecisely alveolar place of articulation (signaled by the double-underscore diacritic which\nis adapted from the \u2018extended IPA\u2019 used in the transcription of disordered speech). There\nare durational differences, too, with a longer phonetic fricative for \/s\/ than for \/t\/ (Sangster\n2001). Recent work has suggested that there is a wide range of possibilities of \u2018stopless\n\/t\/\u2019, which can all be described as fricatives, but which are all articulated with varying\ndegrees of approximation (Watson 2007). Rather than these realisations being the result\nof articulatory undershoot, there is evidence that fine-grained phonetic differences provide\nindexical information in LE, as they have been found to do elsewhere (see e.g. Docherty\n& Foulkes 1999 for Newcastle, and Jones & Llamas 2003 for Middlesbrough). Thus, these\nrealisations represent the learned articulatory behaviour of the speakers (Docherty & Foulkes\n2000, Foulkes & Docherty 2006). For example, LE \/t\/ for male speakers is often realised as\nthe [T] described above, but for female \/t\/ the relationship between the oral and glottal gesture\nis more variable, so that realisations such as [hsh] are common. An example of a preaspirated,\npostaspirated fricative \/t\/ is provided in figure 2. Space restrictions inhibit detailed discussion\nof these realisations in this illustration, but see Watson (forthcoming) for a more detailed\nexamination.\nAs well as realising \/t\/ as an oral fricative, it can also be debuccalised to [h]. In older\nspeakers, this occurs only in pre-pausal position in a small set of high frequency monosyllabic\n(pseudo)function words with short vowels (e.g. it [Ih], what [w\u00c5h], not [n\u00c5h], that [d1ah], lot\n[l\u00c5h]). For younger speakers, the realisation of \/t\/ as [h] can also occur in polysyllabic\nwords which end in an unstressed syllable (e.g. market [ma\u2026xIh], maggot [magIh], aggregate\n[ag|IgIh]). As the debuccalisation of \/t\/ does not occur in any other variety of north-western\nEnglish, it has been suggested that the extension of the process to polysyllabic words is an\ninnovation which represents phonological divergence from supralocal norms (Watson 2006,\n2007). Because pre-pausality is a conditioning environment for the realisation of \/t\/ as [h],\nthere are no potential candidates in the reading passage. Connected to the realisation of \/t\/\nas [h], in terms of the environments in which it occurs, is the realisation of \/t\/ as a rhotic\n(typically [\u00ae] but also [|]). \/t\/ \u2192 [\u00ae] and \/t\/ \u2192 [h] can occur in a similar sets of monosyllabic\nwords, but whereas pre-pausality is necessary for the realisation as [h], the conditioning factor\nfor [\u00ae] is the presence of a following vowel (e.g. get off [gE\u00ae\u00c5f], that apple [d1a\u00aeap\u00b4l], lot of\n[l\u00c5\u00ae\u00b4v]). The realisation of \/t\/ as [\u00ae] is not unique to Liverpool English, but can be found in\na range of northern English varieties (see e.g. Wells 1982). Like for \/t\/ \u2192 [h], the tightly\nconstrained phonological environment in which \/t\/ \u2192 [\u00ae] occurs means it is not produced\nby the speaker in the passage. The final realisation of \/t\/ is one which is very frequent in\njust about all varieties of British English; the realisation of \/t\/ as [\/]. Early accounts of LE\nnoted that the glottal stop was rare (Knowles 1973), and more recent work has corroborated\nthis (Watson 2005, 2006, 2007). Knowles (1973) does comment, however, that [\/] is possible\npreceding \/l\/ or other syllabic consonants. The speaker can be heard using [\/] in disputing\n[dIspju\u2026\/n`] and immediately [Imi\u2026di\u00b4\/li\u2026].\nIt is also common for speakers to realise \/k\/ as an affricate or a fricative, too, as the\nspeaker\u2019s various tokens of cloak testify. The exact place of articulation of the fricative is\nmostly conditioned by assimilation to the preceding vowel. That is, palatal fricatives can be\nfound following the close front monophthong [i\u2026] and closing diphthongs [ei, ai] (e.g. week\n[wi\u2026\u00e7], like [lai\u00e7]), and more dorsal fricatives are attested following low and back vowels (e.g.\nback [bax], dock [d\u00c5X]). These dorsal fricatives can be velar or uvular. Fricativisation of \/p\/\nalso occurs, typically to [F], but this is much less frequent than that of \/t\/ or \/k\/.\n354 Journal of the International Phonetic Association: Illustrations of the IPA\nFigure 1 An affricated \/t\/ (circled) in word-initial position in the speaker\u2019s production of the word \u2018two\u2019.\nKevin Watson: Liverpool English 355\nFigure 2 A preaspirated, postaspirated sibilant fricative (circled) for \/t\/ in pre-pausal out.

Because final-devoicing is common in LE, as\nit is in other varieties of English, the fricative realisations of \/b, d, g\/ are rarely voiced in\nfinal position. As with the lenited variant of \/t\/ described above, that of \/d\/ does not result in\nneutralisation with \/z\/. Instead, the fricative is articulated with a flat cross-sectional tongue\nshape which is not unlike the fricative variant of \/t\/ described above. The speaker does not\naffricate or fricativise \/b\/ or \/g\/, but \/d\/ is realised as a fricative in could (see figure 3). In the\ntranscription that follows, taking Pandeli et al.\u2019s (1997) lead, I transcribe the fricative variant\nof \/d\/ as [D], with the caveat that it is frequently devoiced.\nVowels\nFigure 4 Vowel trapeziums of monophthongs and diphthongs in Liverpool English.\ni\u2026 heed eI hay\nI hid aI high\ne\u2026 heard (also hair, her) OI boy\nE head E0 hoe\na had aU how\nA\u2026 hard ([a\u2026] also used) iE beer\n\u00c5 hod\nO\u2026 hoard\n0\u2026 who\u2019d (also book)\nU hood\n\u00b4 about\nThe similarities between the vowels of Liverpool English and those of other northern English\nvarieties are numerous. The distinction between [\u00d8] and [U] that is found in accents of southern\nEngland (and elsewhere, e.g. in varieties of English outside the British Isles) is not found in LE.\nThus, words such as foot, put, butcher, bus and putt all have [U]. Similarly like other accents\nin the north, LE has the short [a] in words such as bath, dance, and grass, where southern\nEnglish varieties have the longer [A\u2026]. As might be expected, there is complex sociolinguistic\npatterning here. According to Knowles (1973, 1978), the lack of distinction between \/\u00d8, U\/\nand the use of the short [a] in bath words is most robust in working-class speakers, with some\nmiddle-class speakers modifying towards higher prestige RP-like norms. Knowles (1978:\n358 Journal of the International Phonetic Association: Illustrations of the IPA\n86) suggests that this differentiation often leads to hypercorrection, with speakers sometimes\nproducing utterances such as good luck [g\u00d8d lUk] and black castle [blA\u2026k k\u0153sl]. Some middle-\nclass speakers may have a [\u00d8]\u223c[U] type contrast by using a more centralised, schwa-like\nvariant for one of the pair of vowels (e.g. good luck [gUd l\u00b4k]). Although the long [A\u2026] is not\nused for bath words, it is used in words such as start and palm, as it is elsewhere England. In\nLiverpool, however, for some speakers the quality of the vowel is often more front, resembling\n[a\u2026] (e.g. start [sta\u2026T], shark [Sa\u2026x]). Recent work has suggested that this fronter variant is\nused mostly by male speakers, with female speakers preferring the back variant [A\u2026] (Watson\n2005). The speaker follows this pattern, using [A\u2026] in hard.\nFor many speakers of LE, there is a lack of contrast between the vowel in words like\nsquare, hair, and that in words like nurse, her. Typically, both sets have a front variant such\nas [e\u2026] or [E\u2026], or even [I\u2026]. De Lyon (1981) establishes no less than 18 different realisations\nfor the vowel in square words, ranging from [E\u00b4] to [\u2030 \u2122] to [\u2030\u2026], and lists 15 different forms\nof the vowel for nurse words, including [\u2030], [\u00b4E] and [{]. It is not clear from de Lyon\n(1981), however, whether these variants pattern in sociolinguistically structured ways, as their\ndistribution is not successfully quantified. It could be, for example, that the variation is more\na result of phonological environment than any sociolinguistic patterning, but more research\nis required to investigate this further. According to Knowles (1973), middle class speakers\nare more likely to have an RP-like distinction between nurse and square words, using [\u2030\u2026] and\nsomething like [E\u2026] respectively. In the passage, the speaker uses a close front variant [I\u2026] in\nfirst.\nAs with other accents in the north of England, words such as book, cook and look typically\nhave a long vowel in Liverpool rather than the short [U] found elsewhere. The long vowel\nis typically produced in an advanced position, most frequently as a central [0] but also\nas a fully front [y]. This results in minimal pairs such as look [l0\u2026k]\/luck [lUk], and book\n[b0\u2026k]\/buck [bUk]. The use of [0\u2026] in look words occurs more often in the working class than\nthe middle class for Knowles\u2019 (1973) speakers, but recent work has suggested that this feature\nis recessive, occurring less frequently in younger people (Watson 2005). The vowel in e.g.\ngoose and hoop, is also typically articulated in an advanced position. The speaker produces\nan advanced variant in blew and two.\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Liverpool English vowels and those of many other\nnorthern English varieties is that Liverpool English has diphthongs in words like face [feIs]\nand goat [gE0t]. Diphthongs are also used in choice [tSOIs], price [p\u00aeaIs] and mouth [maUT], as\nthey are elsewhere. For some speakers the vowel in price can monophthongise before certain\nconsonants (e.g. time [ta\u2026m], five [fa\u2026v]) but this has not yet been systematically investigated.\nThere is also variation in the vowel of goat, which most typically has a fronted onset and\noffset (e.g. E0) but can also be realised as [eU, EU, \u00b40, e0] or the more standard [\u00b4U].\nStress and intonation\nPrevious work on LE intonation is minimal. Only Knowles (1973) has provided a systematic\nauditory investigation of prosodic issues, although more recent acoustic work is underway\n(Grabe 2004, Grabe, Kochanski & Coleman 2005). Knowles (1973) argues that LE pitch range\nis narrower than other varieties of English, and that this makes the distinction of tones difficult\nto detect. However, LE is known to have intonational similarities to other northern English\naccents, and also to share features with varieties of Irish English. For example, Knowles\n(1973: 188) refers to a tone which he calls the step, in which a high level tone follows the\ninitial rise. This is comparable to the RISE-PLATEAU which is one of the most common tones\nin Belfast English (Grabe et al. 2005). More systematic investigation is required if we are\nto understand the relationship between the prosodic system of LE and that of other English\nvarieties.\nKevin Watson: Liverpool English 359\nTranscription of recorded passage\nTwo transcriptions are provided.
