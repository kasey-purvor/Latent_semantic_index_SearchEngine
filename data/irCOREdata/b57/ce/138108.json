It is a complex, highly \ncompetitive market and it is not unusual to find some retailers with a product range in \nexcess of 20,000 items, while many manufacturers now have logistical webs covering \nevery European country. In this complex and competitive environment most FMCG \nmanufacturers and retailers consider a modest level of stock loss, often euphemistically \ntermed \u2018shrinkage\u20193, as an accepted part of doing business. \nResearch in the US, UK and elsewhere has begun to identify the broader extent of the \nstock loss problem4. These studies have served to raise awareness of the overall scale of \nstock loss and shown it to be an important issue for organisations to consider. However, \nto date such studies have been country-specific or have a narrow perspective such as a \nfocus on a particular retail market segment or the more crime-oriented aspects of \nshrinkage such as customer and staff theft.  \nIn order to establish a more definitive account of the extent and nature of the problem of \nstock loss in the FMCG sector a programme of research was conducted across retailers \nand manufacturers in this sector, through fifteen European countries. This research was \ndesigned to provide a wide geographical coverage and to consider the entire span of the \nsupply chain from manufacture, through distribution and to retail outlets. This paper \npresents the results from this research and discusses the implications of these findings. \nShrinkage in Europe \n 2\nDEFINING SHRINKAGE AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN \nIn order to frame this research, it was important to first define the term \u2018shrinkage\u2019 and \ncontextualise it with respect to the functions of supply chains. Throughout the supply \nchain, from the first delivery of raw materials to a manufacturer, to the point at which a \nconsumer takes a finished product out of a store and beyond, there are a number of \nopportunities for products to be either lost, broken, stolen, consumed, under priced or go \nout of date. Some of these events are due to the unintended outcomes of processes used \nwithin companies such as methods of pricing, stock counting or errors in deliveries. \nOther events are malicious in nature; suppliers deliberately under delivering, customers \ntaking goods from stores, staff helping themselves to the stock or the cash in the tills.  \nMost commentators define shrinkage narrowly as \u2018unexplained loss of physical \ninventory\u20195, although this excludes those losses that can be explained, such as items \ngoing beyond their sell by date and the theft of cash. For the purposes of this study, a \nbroader definition was used encompassing four main types of stock loss: supplier fraud, \nprocess failures, internal theft and external theft. Supplier fraud is defined here as those \nlosses due to suppliers, or their agents, deliberately delivering fewer goods than \ncompanies are eventually charged for, which included vendor and contractor fraud, and \nalso referred to losses due to discrepancies in the goods supplied by third parties (but \nnot from companies\u2019 own distribution centres, DCs). Process failures were considered \nas losses due to the operating procedures within the organisation, including products \nthat have gone out of date, or have been reduced in price; incorrect stock counting; \nproducts that have been damaged; scanning errors and errors in deliveries to stores, for \nexample, short deliveries due to errors in picking and dispatch from distribution \ncentres6. Internal theft was defined as being, the unauthorised taking of goods or cash \nShrinkage in Europe \n 3\nfrom premises at any time of the day or night by staff employed by the company; this \nincluded contract staff, for instance third party security staff or maintenance workers. \nInternal theft also included staff theft, collusion between customers and staff, employees \neating stock, till shortages and the deliberate manipulation of prices for personal gain. \nExternal theft was defined as, the unauthorised taking of goods or cash from any of the \ncompanies\u2019 premises (or vehicles, in the case of manufacturers) at any time of the day \nor night by customers or other non-company employees. This included incidents of \nshoplifting, fraudulent return of goods, till snatches and burglary.  \nGiven this definition, it is important to locate shrinkage within a broader picture of \nbusiness operations and the supply chain. In theory retailing is a simple business, with \nthe ultimate goal being to move products from point of production, through distribution \nand warehousing, on to the retail store and ultimately to the point of sale, where the \ncontended consumer takes it home. However, throughout this perceptively simple flow \nof products is a plethora of possibilities for stock and cash to be lost and become \ndefined as \u2018shrinkage\u2019.  \nInsert Figure 1 about here \nBut, in any organisation a filter or barrier exists that stands between either stock \nremaining in the supply chain or becoming redefined as shrinkage. The barrier, is the \npolicies, procedures and practices adopted by an organisation to manage its entire \nbusiness, including stock loss, and is often termed \u2018operations management\u2019. For \nexample, how goods are loaded on to a pallet and then on to a vehicle. How goods are \nreceived at a warehouse, then counted, collated and dispatched onwards along the \nsupply chain. How audit departments monitor and check the movements of goods \nShrinkage in Europe \n 4\nthrough the business. How store staff restock the shelves, operate the tills and move \nbetween different parts of the store. How security operatives respond to electronic \narticle surveillance alarms or check the lockers used by staff. It is a long and complex \nlist encapsulating every activity that is carried out by the business. But, the efficiency, \nquality, rigorousness and focus of operations management ultimately defines the extent \nto which products are diverted away from their intended journey along the supply chain \nto the customer. For the purposes of this research, the supply chain was limited to the \npoint at which the completed goods left the manufacturers\u2019 factory to the point at which \ncustomers paid for the goods at the till in the retail store. Several key stepping points \nalong this process were identified and respondents were asked to provide information on \nstock loss at these nodes. These were manufacturer distribution centres, retail \ndistribution centres and the retail stores themselves. \nMETHODOLOGY \nCarrying out research that attempts to collect comparable data from different countries \nis notoriously difficult \u2013 besides the obvious problems of language, difficulties can \nemerge with meaning and terminology7. This study is the first of its kind to try and \ngather detailed information on the extent of shrinkage across Europe and the approaches \nadopted by retailers and their suppliers to deal with the problem. One of the difficulties \nthat emerged at the start of the study was the lack of an agreed pan-European definition \nfor shrinkage. It is an \u2018elastic\u2019 term encompassing many different components of loss \ndepending upon the type of company, range of products and location within Europe. It \nwas therefore important to develop a workable definition that would enable not only \ncompanies to complete the questionnaire as fully as possible, but also enable \u2018like with \nlike\u2019 comparisons to be made by the research team (See earlier). The research was \nShrinkage in Europe \n 5\nfunded by ECR Europe8 and received the active support of 15 major European retailers \nand manufacturers9 through their participation on a steering group for this study.  \nThe research made use of two questionnaires: one for grocery retailers and one for \nFMCG manufacturers. The principal difference between the two questionnaires \nconcerned the wording used, which reflected the differing business contexts of the two \ngroups of respondents. Both questionnaires asked for information on five areas: \ncompany information; extent, nature and impact of stock loss within the company; \nmethods for recording stock loss; company responses to stock loss and the nature of \ncollaborative efforts to tackle stock loss. To try and encourage as high a response rate as \npossible, the questionnaire for retailers was translated into 7 languages (Danish, French, \nGerman, Greek, Italian, Polish and Spanish). The questionnaires were sent to named \nsenior members of security departments, audit departments, or senior members of staff \nwith responsibility for loss prevention. Where necessary, a follow-up letter and a further \ncopy of the questionnaire was sent to companies that had yet to respond. In addition, \nwhere possible, electronic versions of the questionnaire were also sent out to \nrespondents. \nThe retailer questionnaires were sent to 173 companies in 20 European countries. The \nsample was selected based upon targeting companies that had the largest share of the \nmarket within their own country, with the aim being to gain responses from retailers \nthat controlled at least 30 per cent of the market in each territory. The study received 38 \nresponses from retailers, a response rate of 22 per cent10. These respondents had a \ncombined turnover of \u20ac121.9 billion or 14.78 per cent of the total European market \nshare. The rate of response varied considerably between countries although sufficient \nShrinkage in Europe \n 6\ninformation was received to enable meaningful analysis to take place on companies \nfrom 15 different countries. \nThe sample of manufacturers was limited to companies with a \u2018pan-European\u2019 presence \nthat supply a wide portfolio of branded products to retailers. Companies possessing \nthese characteristics operated in a number of sectors, including alcoholic beverages, \ncleaning products, cosmetics, cooked foods, toys and electrical goods. In total, 29 \ncompanies were sent a questionnaire. Responses were received from 14 companies, a \nresponse rate of 48 per cent, who had a combined turnover of \u20ac61.7 billion. Under \nrepresented in the sample are companies that provide fresh produce such as meat, fish \nand vegetables. \nThroughout this article, all values are stated in euros, although the original research \ninstrument requested company figures in the local currency. These were then converted \nusing the average currency exchange rate for 2000. In order to overcome the problem of \nvarying start dates for financial years in different countries, the survey opted to ask \nrespondents to comment on their \u2018last full financial year\u2019, together with the previous full \nfinancial year.  \nPan-European estimates of the cost of stock loss were derived from three sources of \ninformation. First, estimates of the value of stock loss in retailers were obtained from \nthe question, \u2018\u2026what was the total value of stock loss at retail value (including taxes) as \na percentage of total sales\u2019, while manufacturers were asked, \u2018\u2026 what was the total \nvalue of stock loss at net sales value as a percentage of total sales\u2019. Secondly, all \nrespondents were asked to state their company turnover11. Thirdly, published figures on \nthe total size of the FMCG sector in each country were used. From these data, it was \nShrinkage in Europe \n 7\npossible to extrapolate to generate firstly, a countrywide figure for stock loss and \nsecondly, a pan-European figure.  \nFew companies, either retailer or manufacturer, were able to provide data for every \nquestion in the surveys and some of the questions asked respondents to comment on \nknown and unknown loss. This clearly relied upon them using their knowledge and \nexperience to estimate what the requested breakdown might be. It is also important to \nrecognise that given the sampling methodology adopted (targeting those companies with \nthe largest percentage of the market), small-scale retailers are completely excluded from \nthe process. It is also important to emphasise that the data represents only those \ncompanies operating in the FMCG sector and so excludes a significant proportion of the \nretail sector, such as specialist outlets selling only clothing, electrical, pharmaceutical or \nhardware12. However, despite the complexity of the project and the difficulty of \ncollecting data on the sensitive and often hidden topic of shrinkage, it is felt that \nsufficient data was collected to allow the first robust assessment of the extent of the \nproblem of stock loss in the FMCG sector in a European setting. \nSHRINKAGE IN THE FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS SECTOR \nThe research on retailers and manufacturers was intended to provide information for the \nfirst time on the cost of shrinkage to the FMCG sector across Europe. It was also \ninterested in finding out where in the supply chain losses occurred, how much of \nshrinkage was known and unknown to business, what were perceived as the key causes \nof stock loss, to what extent organisations collaborated both internally and externally, \nand what impact if any the use of specialist teams had on dealing with the problem. \nShrinkage in Europe \n 8\nSize of the Problem \nThe total cost of shrinkage for the FMCG sector in 2000 was calculated at \u20ac18 billion. \nThis amounted to \u20ac13.4 billion for retailers and \u20ac4.6 billion for manufacturers. Put \nanother way, this is equivalent to \u20ac50 million a day or the annual gross domestic \nproduct of Luxembourg. In terms of a percentage of turnover, it was calculated that \nshrinkage accounted for 2.31 per cent \u2013 1.75 per cent for retailers and 0.56 per cent for \nmanufacturers. Given that the average profit margin for European food retailing is \napproximately 3 per cent, then stock loss is equivalent to 50 per cent of total profit13. \nInsert Table 1 somewhere here \nWhile comparisons with other studies are fraught with methodological difficulties, these \nestimates of the European-wide percentage of stock loss are comparable with a similar \nstudy carried out by the University of Florida in 1997, which found that supermarkets \nand retailers in the USA lost, on average, 1.69 per cent of total retail sales14.  \nLocation of Stock Loss \nIdentifying where stock loss occurs within the FMCG supply chain was an important \nobjective of the research. To date most studies on stock loss in the retail sector have \nfocused on the store as the primary node of analysis, with little work being conducted \non the vulnerability of the rest of the supply chain to loss15. From the data obtained from \nmanufacturers and retailers, it was possible to look at three points along the supply \nchain: the manufacturer distribution centre, the retail distribution centre and the retail \nstore16. \nInsert Table 2 about here. \nShrinkage in Europe \n 9\nThe results show that significant losses occur at each point in the supply chain process, \nalthough the retail stores are seen to be the place where two-thirds of all shrinkage takes \nplace (66%). In many respects this is not surprising \u2013 it is the point at which \u2018customers\u2019 \nenter the stock loss equation; mainly to browse and buy, but sometimes also to steal, eat \nand damage stock. It is also the point at which perishable goods usually meet their \u2018sell \nby dates\u2019, at best triggering price reductions and at worse causing stock to be destroyed. \nHowever it is clear that other stages in the supply chain are responsible for significant \nlosses as well and can critically affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the sector. \nSome \u20ac6.1 billion disappears at distribution centres or while goods are in transit \u2013 \u20ac4.6 \nbillion going missing while goods are in manufacturer distribution centres or on the \nmove to customers, and a further \u20ac1.5 billion lost while stock is held in retail \ndistribution centres or in transit to the stores. This data certainly highlights the \nimportance of seeing shrinkage as something that needs to be addressed at all points of \nthe supply chain and not simply considered as a retail store problem. \nKnown and Unknown Stock Loss \u2013 The Shrinkage Iceberg \nThe surveys asked retailers and manufacturers what percentage of loss within their \norganisation was known and unknown. This is a critical question underpinning any \nattempts at explaining the causes of stock loss and at the same time undermining efforts \ndesigned to respond to the problem. The term \u2018unknown\u2019 is used to describe shrinkage \nwhere the company has no records of when, what or where the loss took place. \nInsert Table 3 about here. \nFor retailers, the majority of stock loss was unknown (59%) accounting for \u20ac7.9 billion \nof losses. For manufacturers, it was a slightly better picture, with the majority of losses \nShrinkage in Europe \n 10\nbeing known to the company (59%). However, even they could not account for nearly \ntwo-fifths of all their stock loss, equating to \u20ac1.9 billion. Taken together, the FMCG \nsector could not account for the majority of their losses \u2013 almost \u20ac10 billion or \u20ac192 \nmillion per week. The difference between the two parts of the sector is readily \nexplicable. Retailers have the added factor of direct interaction with customers who add \nthe not inconsiderable risk of external theft to the equation17. They also have \nsignificantly more product lines to manage through the supply chain (sometimes in \nexcess of 20,000), often delivered by a multitude of third-party providers and suppliers, \nwhich adds appreciably to the complexity of the business and the opportunities for stock \nloss not to be either noticed or recorded. \nWhen asked about the methods adopted to record shrinkage, it was found that a \nsignificant number of companies either had no system in place or used a paper-based \nsystem for recording all forms of shrinkage. Some 12 per cent stated that no record was \nkept at all of process failures, with 50 per cent of companies indicating that records of \nthis type of loss where simply recorded on paper files within the store. Both internal and \nexternal theft was prioritised much less by companies \u2013 between 14 and 21 per cent of \nrespondents kept no records at all, and only between one-fifth and one-quarter \nmaintained a computerised system for recording such incidents. \nIt is difficult to get strictly comparative data from other sources on the extent of known \nand unknown losses. A number of UK produced reports, which have looked only at the \nproblems of crime against all retailers, tend to suggest that only between 20 and 30 per \ncent of loss is known to retailers18. The higher figures of known loss presented here can \nbe partly explained by the fact that this study includes stock losses through process \nfailures, which are more routinely and systematically recorded by retailers and are \nShrinkage in Europe \n 11\ntherefore more easily identified within the overall losses due to shrinkage than crime-\nrelated incidents such as theft. \nSuch an information deficit has been highlighted elsewhere, and is often the \nconsequence of poorly designed and maintained stock loss databases or the methods \nadopted to carry out audits, particularly within retail stores19, and is also partly due to a \nlack of prioritisation of the problem within the business. This has significant \nimplications for organisations and the way they respond to their stock loss problem: \ncertainly without access to reliable, timely and complete data, any response is likely to \nbe poorly informed, partial, inappropriate and ineffective20.  \nCauses of Shrinkage \nCountless studies have been carried out, particularly in the retail sector21, trying to \nidentify the main causes of stock loss. In some respects it is the holy grail of stock loss \ncontrol, as a reliable, accurate and up-to-date breakdown of the causes of shrinkage can \neffectively guide the strategies organisations adopt to tackle the problem. Unfortunately, \nthe data presented above on the extent of stock loss that is unknown, effectively \nundermines any attempts to understand the true picture of the proportions each type of \nshrinkage makes up of the whole. Therefore, any estimates rely upon the perceptions of \nthose providing the data, which are based upon their own prejudices and priorities. A \nsimilar approach was adopted with this research although the interest was more in the \nperceived differences between manufacturers and retailers than in the absolute \nbreakdowns offered by respondents. Detailed below in Figures 2 and 3 are the estimates \nprovided by retailer and manufacturer respondents broken down into four areas: supply \nfraud, process failures, internal and external theft. \nShrinkage in Europe \n 12\nInsert figures 2 and 3 about here. \nFor retail respondents, external theft was perceived as the main cause of stock loss \n(37%), followed by process failures (27%), internal theft (24%) and finally supplier \nfraud, which was thought to make up 12 per cent of all shrinkage losses. Taken together, \ntheft was considered to account for nearly two thirds of all losses (61%) or \u20ac8 billion. In \ncontrast, manufacturers identified process failures as the biggest culprit \u2013 78 per cent of \nall losses. Both internal and external theft were thought to equally account for the \nremaining 22 per cent (11% each), although this still equates to \u20ac1 billion of losses due \nto malicious activities. \nWhile such data needs to be interpreted with some caution, there are two interesting \npoints it raises. First, retailers do not see any one cause as dominating their thinking \u2013 \nall four factors receive between 12 and 37 per cent of the total. This highlights the \nimportance of recognising that retail stock loss practitioners face a myriad of threats and \nthat any ameliorative actions need to take account of this. Secondly, manufacturers have \na much clearer perception of the single most important threat to their business \u2013 that of \nprocess failures. This directs attention more towards the policies, procedures and \npractices they adopt to store, move and monitor their merchandise rather than the \nexplicit threat posed by thieves. \nCompany Collaboration \nThe problem of shrinkage transcends departmental and company boundaries \u2013 it is a \ncommon problem requiring shared solutions. The research was interested in gauging the \nextent to which organisations currently co-operated both internally, for example \nbetween departments, and externally, for example between retailers, third party logistics \nShrinkage in Europe \n 13\nsuppliers and manufacturers, to develop shared strategies for dealing with the common \nproblem of shrinkage. In order to quantify levels of collaboration both retailer and \nmanufacturer respondents were asked to rate the extent to which a range of \norganisational departments were involved with stock loss within their organisation. The \nresults of this are presented in Figure 4, below. \nInsert Figure 4 about here. \nIn terms of retailers, 83 per cent stated that store management were regularly or highly \ninvolved in dealing with the prevention of stock loss. Similarly, a significant proportion \nof respondents (60%) also felt that their human resources\/personnel department were \ninvolved to an equivalent level. Both of these groups featuring highly is perhaps not \nsurprising; store management teams are on the \u2018front line\u2019 in terms of trying to tackle \nshrinkage problems, while personnel departments will have involvement in integrity \nchecks and disciplinary action against dishonest members of staff22. Of note, less than \none-half of companies indicated that their finance and auditing, and supply chain \nmanagement teams were regularly or highly involved in loss prevention. Both these \ngroups have a potential role in responding to the problem of stock loss. For instance, the \naudit team could help by providing more accurate data on the level and extent of loss, \nwhich should be viewed as a critical first step in tackling any problem, while the supply \nchain management team could help to look at the problems relating to delivery errors \nand damage to stock, questioning whether the appropriate systems are in place for \nreceiving goods and whether staff follow company policies and procedures23. \nThose deemed to be the least involved within the retail sector were the buying, \nmarketing, IT and legal departments, with only a small proportion of respondents stating \nthat they were regularly involved. Once again, each of these departments could play a \nShrinkage in Europe \n 14\nrole in dealing with shrinkage. For instance, company buyers could benefit from \nawareness of the potential problems new products may pose both in terms of risk from \nprocess failures and from theft. Similarly, the marketing department could consider risk \nof stock loss when making decisions on the manner with which products are displayed \nstores, including the implications of promotional displays on existing security \nequipment (for instance, will proposed signage obscure CCTV cameras or lines of sight \nfor members of staff?24). Likewise, IT departments could look at their existing systems \nand see whether different types of process failure could be \u2018designed out\u2019. Finally, the \nlegal department could become involved in a number of different ways, including \nlooking at how the existing legislative framework could be used to protect the company, \nfor example against persistent shoplifters25.  \nWithin the manufacturing sector, finance and auditing were revealed as the team \nconsidered the most involved in stock loss reduction, with 85 per cent of respondents \nrating them as regularly or highly involved. The next most involved team was thought \nto be those responsible for managing the factories and distribution centres (69% thought \nthey were regularly or highly involved). These two departments were seen to be much \nmore involved than any of the other teams listed, and were then followed by a group of \nthree teams who could be described as being involved with shrinkage control at an \nintermediate level: factory and DC planning and design; the security\/loss prevention \ndepartment; and the board of directors. The low ranking of security\/loss prevention \ndepartments in the control of stock loss may seem surprising, but this is probably \nexplained by the perceived predominance of process failure as the primary area of loss \nand the general absence of this department within a large proportion of companies \ntaking part in this survey. In addition, where there is a security\/loss prevention \nShrinkage in Europe \n 15\ndepartment, it may be seen as being responsible primarily for the physical security of \nsites and dealing with the risk of theft \u2013 not ranked highly as major concerns within the \nissue of shrinkage. The final group of teams were considered very much at the periphery \nof helping to deal with the problem of shrinkage. They were: research and development; \nthe IT department; and human resources. This is somewhat surprising given the \npotential role each of these departments could have in dealing with shrinkage. Certainly \nthe relationship between product and package design and the potential for goods to be \ndamaged would seem clear, as would the role of the IT department in developing \nmanagement systems which may cut down problems caused by delivery or picking \nerrors. Similarly, the human resources team could become more involved, for example \nin looking at the human aspects of why company staff do make picking or delivery \nerrors and how staff interface with the management systems currently in place. \nInter-company collaboration, for retailers, was characterised by an emphasis on rather \nreactive activities with security providers and the police; installing security hardware or \ncharging shop thieves. Relatively few pointed to work with individual manufacturers or \ntheir representative organisations. Manufacturers were even more isolated with less than \n1 in 3 indicating that they had ever worked with an individual retailer on issues of stock \nloss and most focused their rather sparse co-operative efforts on working with third \nparty logistics service providers. \nUse of Specialist Teams \nMore encouragingly, the research found that companies employing dedicated \nsecurity\/loss prevention departments and audit departments suffered much lower losses \ndue to shrinkage. \nShrinkage in Europe \n 16\nInsert Table 4 about here. \nFor those retailers with a security\/loss prevention department, the level of stock loss was \n27 per cent lower, with those with this function achieving a rate of 1.37 per cent \ncompared with those without such a department suffering losses at 1.86 per cent. \nSimilarly, manufacturers with such a specialist department also reported significantly \nlower levels of loss \u2013 nearly 50 per cent lower levels of stock loss as expressed as a \npercentage of turnover. \nIn addition, those retail companies with a dedicated audit department had losses 39 per \ncent lower than those companies without such a function. This picture was mirrored in \nthe data from manufacturers where the difference was even more profound. For both \nspecialist teams and in both FMCG settings, the opportunity to report directly to the \nBoard of Directors appeared to improve performance, with levels of loss significantly \nlower for those that were able to do this. Whilst further research would be required to \nidentify a clear causal link between having such functions and achieving lower levels of \nrecorded shrinkage, this data does direct attention to the potential specialist teams may \nhave to improve company performance and the need to give them access to senior \ndecision-makers. \nDISCUSSION \nThe purpose of this research was to better understand the extent, nature and control of \nshrinkage across the European \u2018Fast Moving Consumer Goods\u2019, FMCG sector. This \nrequired research along the supply chain process, from the point of production to the \npoint of sale. This proved to be an ambitious objective given the complexity and scale \nof the sector (\u20ac824 billion), but was fundamental if genuine progress is to be made in \nShrinkage in Europe \n 17\nreducing the impact shrinkage has on retailers and manufacturers alike. Of critical \nimportance was understanding how different groups co-operated, or not on tackling this \nissue both internally and externally and whether the use of specialist teams had an \nimpact on levels of loss. \nRecognising the Need to Change  \nMeasuring the cost of shrinkage was an important part of this project since for the most \npart those working in the sector have largely ignored the problem. The cost of shrinkage \nis enormous, with an annual price tag of \u20ac18 billion, excluding expenditure on trying to \nrespond to the problem. This is equivalent to \u20ac50 million a day and accounts for 2.31% \nof market turnover. In addition, significant losses were found to occur at each point in \nthe supply chain process, although retail stores were the place where nearly two-thirds \nof all shrinkage took place. In many respects this is not surprising \u2013 it is the point at \nwhich \u2018customers\u2019 enter the stock loss equation; mainly to browse and buy, but \npotentially also to steal, eat and damage stock. It is also the point at which perishable \ngoods usually meet their \u2018sell by dates\u2019; at best triggering price reductions, and at worse \ncausing stock to be destroyed. But other stages in the \u2018chain\u2019 are responsible for \nsignificant losses as well and critically affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nsector. \nDeciding how stock is lost is a perennial question for those trying to manage and \nmonitor shrinkage \u2013 is it the staff, the customers, the suppliers or simply a consequence \nof company processes? Because most retailers do not know where and how the majority \nof their stock loss occurs, answering this question accurately remains impossible. \nCertainly theft is bound to be more of a problem for retailers than manufacturers due to \nShrinkage in Europe \n 18\nthe nature of their business, but there is a danger that too much emphasis is placed on a \nsingle explanatory factor when all companies are vulnerable to a range of stock loss \nproblems.  \nMeasuring the Problem \nThe research found that most retailers cannot tell where or how most loss takes place; \nonly 41% is known. Manufacturers claim to be slightly more knowledgeable, but even \nthey can account for only 59% of their loss. Much of the shrinkage iceberg remains \nsubmerged, shrouded by poor company practices. Without good quality data that is up-\nto-date and timely, loss prevention strategies will always be based upon the shifting \nsands of hearsay, guess work and perception. The surveys found that reporting \nprocedures varied considerably not only between manufacturers and retailers but also \nbetween the different types of stock loss. A significant proportion of respondents \nidentified process failures as an area that was reasonably well recorded, but internal and \nexternal theft were not seen as a priority for computerised database systems, with most \neither not recording incidents at all or simply keeping a paper record. This was \nparticularly the case for manufacturers.  \nThis raises two points. First, \u2018data reinforcement\u2019 can take place whereby only those \nproblems that are recorded are seen as a problem and hence little effort is then made to \nrecord other data. In effect a problem becomes self-selecting and self-prioritising and a \nperpetual loop of justification is produced. Secondly, paper-based systems offer little \nmore than an auditable record of events and are bereft of virtually any analytical \ncapabilities. It is only through the use of computerised databases that trends can be \nShrinkage in Europe \n 19\nidentified and a more information-led strategic approach can be adopted to deal with all \nthe elements that account for shrinkage.  \nThe Use of Security and Audit Personnel  \nIt was found that retailers and manufacturers with security and audit departments had \nsignificantly lower levels of shrinkage compared with those companies that did employ \nsuch specialist functions. For retailers this amounted to a difference of 26 per cent for \nthose with a security department and 39 per cent lower for those with an audit \ndepartment. In addition, having access to the higher levels of decision-making also \nseemed to improve the performance of these teams, with those able to report directly to \nthe Board of Directors having more of an impact on stock loss. While further research is \nrequired to show clear causality, investing in teams designed to specifically address this \nproblem would seem to be a good strategy, and giving them sufficient power through \naccess to senior decision-makers even more so. \nLack of Collaboration  \nShrinkage is a problem that transcends departmental and company boundaries, and it is \nsomething that requires genuine partnership and co-operation if it is to be managed \nefficiently and effectively. For many retailers stock loss is the exclusive responsibility \nof the security\/loss prevention and audit department and for manufacturers, very often \nthe logistics team. However, virtually all parts of an organisation can play a role in \nreducing stock loss; from the buyers, IT department, the distribution management team, \nright through to the legal department and buildings planners. Indeed, the role of \ndepartments like security should be as much about co-ordinating inter-departmental \nefforts to reduce shrinkage as it is about provision of \u2018security solutions\u2019 such as \nShrinkage in Europe \n 20\ninstalling CCTV or employing security guards. In addition, co-operation between \ncompanies operating within the supply chain is equally important. Without cross-\ncompany collaboration, any shrinkage solutions will be partial, piecemeal and \nproblematic, and will not contribute to overall supply chain efficiency. \nTo date very little has been done to try and co-ordinate stock loss reduction efforts \nacross the different aspects of the entire supply chain process. This research has shown \nthat much more could be done both by retailers and manufacturers to collaborate on \nproblems of shrinkage and to work together to seek common solutions to shared \nproblems. There is plenty of evidence that points to a significant amount of \ncommonality in problems suffered, particularly with respect to process failures. It is \ndifficult to see the disadvantages of improving the scale and extent of links between \nthose who produce and those who sell. But it is plain to see the possible impact of self- \ninterest and a lack of sector-wide co-operation \u2013 a continuing bill for stock loss of \u20ac18 \nbillion a year. \n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 21\nAccompanying Tables \nTable 1 Cost of shrinkage \nGroup Percentage  \nstock loss \nValue \n(\u20ac billions) \nRetailers 1.75 13.4 \nManufacturers 0.56 4.6 \nTotal 2.31 18.0 \n \n \n \nTable 2 Location of loss within the supply chain \nLocation Percentage  \nof loss \nValue \n(\u20ac billions) \nManufacturer Distribution Centre 26 4.6 \nRetail Distribution Centre 8 1.5 \nRetail Store 66 12.0 \nTotal 100 18.0 \n \n \n \n \nTable 3 Per cent and value of stock loss that is known and  \nunknown by retailers and manufacturers  \nLosses Retailers  Manufacturers Both \n Per cent Value  \n(\u20ac billions) \nPer cent Value  \n(\u20ac billions) \nTotal Value \n(\u20ac billions) \nKnown 41 5.5 59 2.7 8.2 \nUnknown 59 7.9 41 1.9 9.8 \nTotal 100 13.4 100 4.6 18.0 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1  Shrinkage in the Supply Chain \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOperations Management \nSHRINKAGE Supplier Fraud \n \n \n \nProcess \nFailures \n \n \n \nInternal \nTheft \n \n \n \nExternal \nTheft \n \n \n \nPoint of Production In Transit Warehousing Store Till \nProducts and Cash \n \n \n \nLoss \n \n \n \nLoss\n \n \n \nLoss\n \n \n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 22\n \n \n \nFigure 2 Perceived causes of stock loss in the retail sector \nSupplier fraud\n12%\nExternal theft\n(37%)\nInternal theft \n(24%)\nProcess failures \n(27%)\n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 23\nFigure 3 Perceived causes of stock loss in the manufacturing sector \nExternal theft\n(11%)\nInternal theft \n(11%)\nProcess failures \n(78%)\n \n \nFigure 4 Extent of intra company co-operation for retailers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5 Extent of intra company co-operation for manufacturers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 24\n \nTable 4 Level of stock loss and use of a security\/audit departments  \nby retailers and manufacturers \nFunction Retailer Manufacturer \n Percentage of Stock Loss \nSecurity\/Loss Prevention Department   \n  Yes 1.37 0.38 \n  No 1.86 0.75 \n Report to Board of Directors    \n  Yes  1.27 0.04 \n  No 1.47 0.64 \nAudit Department   \n  Yes 1.64 0.42 \n  No 2.69 0.92 \nReport to Board of Directors    \n  Yes  1.59 0.39 \n  No 2.10 0.52 \n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 25\nFigures \nFigure 4 Extent of intra company co-operation for retailers \n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nPer cent involved\nStore Mangt\nHuman Resources\nSupply Chain Mangt\nFinance and Auditing\nNew Store Planning\nLogistics\nBoard of Directors\nBuying\/Trading\nIT Dept\nMarketing\nLegal Dept\nHighly involved Regulary involved Hardly involved\n \nFigure 5 Extent of intra company co-operation for manufacturers \n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nPer cent involved\nFinance and Auditing\nFactory and DC Planning\nBoard of Directors\nSales\nLegal Dept\nIT Dept\nHighly involved Regulary involved Hardly involved\n \nShrinkage in Europe \n 26\nNotes \n \n1  The term Fast Moving Consumer Goods Sector is used here to mean those retailers and their suppliers who provide a range of \ngoods sold primarily through supermarkets, and hypermarkets.
