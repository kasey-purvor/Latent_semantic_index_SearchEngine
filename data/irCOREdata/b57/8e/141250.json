Introduction8\n9\nIn contemporary farm management significantly large amounts of electronic data are available10\nfor decision making. Smooth and efficient streaming and management of this data has a key11\nrole in effective utilisation. The insufficiency of user (farmer) friendliness has been the reason12\nfor slow and non-uptake of precision agriculture technologies for years (Dobermann et al.13\n2004; Kitchen 2008; Lamb et al. 2008). The features of the information-to-action decision14\nprocess have to be the following according to Kitchen (2008): (1) in situ sensor-based; (2)15\nautomated for real-time or near real-time computer processing into decisions; (3) packaged so16\nthat sensing and processing of information are part of the equipment used to accomplish the17\nrequired management action; and (4) transparent to the operator\/manager for decision18\nconfirmation. Nash et al. 2011 have pointed out that the lack of availability of required data in19\ndigital form is an impediment to realise the potential of automated compliance assessment20\nwith common agricultural management standards.S\u00f8rensen et al. (2010) have derived a21\nconceptual model for the farm management information system (FMIS) which contains an22\nautomated monitoring system of data collection and processing. The concept of service23\noriented architecture has been employed in several researches (Murakami et al., 2007; Nash et24\nal., 2009; Wolfert et al., 2010) for data management in precision agriculture. Describing25\n3within field variability, including spatial and temporal is the most important requirement for1\nsuccessful implementation of precision agriculture (Srinivasan, 2006). Conventional2\ndescription of within field spatial variability usually involves manual sampling, sample pre-3\ntreatment, laboratory chemical and physical analyses and mapping. This procedure is very4\nexpensive, time consuming and provides only few scattered number of readings (e.g. 1 sample5\nper ha for soil analysis) (Kitchen 2008). Therefore, fast, cost effective and environment6\nfriendly methods for the collection of data on within field variability are required, which can7\nbe achieved with on-the-go sensors of soil and crops.8\n9\nOn-the-go sensors refer to those sensing technologies used to collect data while moving10\nacross a landscape. An on-the-go sensor to measure key soil properties based on visible and11\nnear infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy is an example (Mouazen et al., 2007). A key benefit of12\nsuch on-the-go sensors is mapping the spatial variation in soil and crop at field\/subfield scale13\nas a valuable input for decision support. Whilst on-the-go instruments now exist to measure14\nessential parameters on soil (Adamchuk et al., 2004) and crops (Lee et al., 2010), challenges15\nremain in integrating these data into the FIMS in an efficient manner. These challenges stem16\nfrom the fact that on-the-go collected data are with different formats e.g. images, spreadsheet17\nxls, xlsx, proprietary binary, csv, etc. The potential benefit of a fully integrated FMIS18\ncontaining updated and accurate soil data allows a farmer to improve the planning of their19\nactivities and inputs to achieve management aims. This may decrease the overall20\nenvironmental impact by achieving lower inputs of energy, fertiliser, seed etc or enhancing21\nprofitability by increasing yield, gross margin, etc. It also allows direct reporting of the22\ncurrent state of a vital national or regional resource (soil) without introducing excessive23\nadministrative burden on the farmers and growers at the root of the information chain.24\n25\n41\nThis paper aims to discuss methods and procedures to automatically collect and manage data2\n(soil is taken as an example) on farms with respect to the FMIS. It will consider how sensors3\nfully integrated with a workflow based on ISO 11783 may be used alongside more technically4\ndirect systems not linked to any specific standard.5\n6\n2. Market survey7\nTechnical systems must be seen as relevant to the market so they are bought and used in8\npractice. The market uptake of on-farm automated recording systems has been investigated by9\nGasparin (2009) by conducting face-to-face semi structured interviews with 27 arable10\nfarmers. Although the specific objective of this investigation was related to agrochemical11\ntraceability subject-matter, many of the points analysed are generic to on-farm recording12\nsystems, data storage and management, and automation of these tasks. The results of Gasparin13\n(2009) particularly relevant to the current subject were as follows:14\n\uf0a7 Main benefits of an automated recording system were: saving time in the office for15\ndata management, improved accuracy of field operations, improvement of stock16\ncontrol of input products, and avoidance of human errors.17\n\uf0a7 Concerns were about time spent on the field where the total time spent on the usage of18\nautomated recording system should not be more than that spent on conventional19\nmethods.20\n\uf0a7 Full integration with the existing farm software, enabling the farmers to work in their21\naccustomed software environment.22\n\uf0a7 Sensitivity of data disclosure, i.e. giving out raw information to those who are not23\nfamiliar with the context of the data (distinctive features of the agricultural task) which24\ncould lead to misinterpretation.25\n5\uf0a7 Due to sensitivity of data disclosure the marketing of automated recording systems1\nshould be directed towards the farmers benefits, and not as a tool, which helps to2\nprovide compliance with legislation.3\n4\nA key practical concern of users, as highlighted by Gasparin (2009) is the potential for on-the-5\ngo data gathering to increase task time through administrative overhead. To set this in context,6\nthe data flow on-farm can be considered a sequential process:7\n1. Gathering data8\n2. Data analysis \u2013 from data to information9\n3. Decision making from information10\nThe current perception of distribution of effort through this process was gauged using a11\nsimple survey of farmers participating in the EU FP7 FutureFarm programme. Seven12\ncommercial operators of a range of farm size from three countries (UK, Denmark and Czech13\nRepublic) responded, and their perceived breakdown of time is shown in Figure 1. The14\nindividuals are generally interested in technology but were not selected on this basis.15\n16\nThis survey shows that farmers believe they already spend more time on gathering17\ninformation (mean = 49%) than on data analysis (mean = 16%) or specific decision making18\n(mean =35%). The data gathering phase is therefore a critical phase and any data transfer19\nfrom on-the-go sensors must not increase time and effort. If possible, automation and20\nstandards should reduce the time required. Any improvement here may be highly visible (and21\ndesirable to drive adoption) by the users. Achieving reduction while handling overall higher22\ndata volume requires effective, robust standards which allow direct interoperability between23\nall sensor systems, vehicle systems and FMIS. The point is supported by a market24\nrequirement analysis (Gasparin 2009 and Peets 2009), which recommended that:25\n6\uf0b7 There should be one central database to hold detailed field records.1\n\uf0b7 There is a need for a common data exchange standard.2\n\uf0b7 Detailed field records have to be accessible by the customers in the food chain if3\nrequired.4\n\uf0b7 A series of stakeholder consultations in that study established that the records may be5\nallowed to be edited later to correct both technical and human mistakes.6\n\uf0b7 There is also an issue that raw field data (e.g. headlands, interruptions) may be7\nmisinterpreted when out of context.8\nThese issues mean that the authorisation, responsibility, extent, and procedure of edits have to9\nbe identified and well defined. The underlying technology must support these requirements.10\n11\n3. Concepts of data collection and management12\n3.1. Outline13\n14\nThe purpose of on-the-go data collection is to populate the FMIS with high quality15\ninformation at minimal cost to the user. The FMIS must then derive value from the records it16\nstores. User costs are primarily related to the time taken to operate the process and handle any17\ngenerated exceptions (retries, correction of errors etc). Therefore once functional operation is18\nachieved the key focus of any system should be on robustness to operate reliably every time19\nwithout manual intervention and recover automatically or work around should errors occur.20\nWith the current level of adoption, a realistic implementation of on-the-go sensing includes21\ndata recorded using systems compliant with ISO 11783 and other systems not fully integrated22\nwith the standard methods of operation. Data processing functions may be performed at a23\nlocal level (handheld PC, in-cab terminal, FMIS) or via the use of remotely accessed network24\n7services. Generally, we believe the focus should be on the function that is required prior to the1\nselection of the optimum location for the processing system.2\n3\n3.2. Specification of on-the-go sensor data4\n5\nOn-the-go collected data includes information about crop yield (Maertens et al., 2004), crop6\ncover and NDVI (Reyniers et al., 2004), soil chemical and physical properties including7\nmoisture content, total nitrogen, organic carbon, pH (Mouazen et al., 2005; Mouazen et al,8\n2007). Data can be distinguished by the form of transfer into FMIS as conventional, ISO9\n11783 XML data, and non-ISO 11783 data. Conventional methods of transferring field data10\ninto an electronic FMIS can be classified as paper records taken in the field, human memory,11\ncollective memory, and physical records and deduction. Paper records can be designed to be12\nvery simple and quick, and if carefully filled complete. Human memory is quicker but prone13\nto errors and much less predictable. Next worse is using collective memory \u2013 asking others14\nassociated with a task if it is not directly being entered by the operator. That is much slower15\nand links in with a second person memory process to update then to transfer the data onto the16\nsystem. Finally, the slowest and least desirable, but not unusual is the use of physical records17\nand logical deduction (e.g. the number of empty spray cans and locating them) to work out18\nafterwards what was done.19\nPaper records are usually transferred into FMIS by manual data entry through an on screen20\ndata input form, entering into spreadsheet or as scanned images of paper records (e.g. jpeg,21\ntiff, pdf), possibly combined with optical character recognition processes.22\n23\nCurrent data communication standard for tractors and machinery in agriculture is ISO 11783,24\nwhich is rather well established and has gained market acceptance and has been adopted by25\n8many agricultural machinery manufacturers (e.g. AGCO, John Deere, Claas, Kverneland).1\nCompatibility with ISO 11783:10 XML data transfer standard allows achieving full benefits.2\nThe identifiers for the data elements that are used in the process data message are specified in3\nthe Data Dictionary (ISO 11783:11 online data base, http:\/\/www.isobus.net\/isobus_E\/). The4\ndatabase is open for requests of new data elements.5\n6\nMost of the on-the-go sensors are non-ISO 11783. Data from these sensors are available in a7\nvariety of formats (e.g. general XML, spreadsheet xls, xlsx etc, proprietary binary, csv)8\ndepending on the manufacturer. The manufacturers provide software to gather and analyse the9\ndata in FMIS. The data can be transferred from the field sensors also to brand specific10\ndatabase such as WebTrack by Patchwork, Fieldclimate by Pessl Instruments and11\nAGCOMMAND by AGCO.12\n13\n3.3. ISO 11783 task management14\nData transfer from an on-the-go-sensor must be located within the overall framework of15\nmanagement of in-field tasks. Task management, communication between task controller and16\nelectronic control units, and data transfer between FMIS and mobile implement control17\nsystem (MICS) are defined in ISO 11783:10 (ISO 2009). FMIS is the information processing18\ninfrastructure comprising of hardware and management software. MICS refers to devices that19\nare coupled by ISO 11783 network. A task controller is the primary electronic control unit20\n(ECU) on the MICS responsible for sending, receiving and logging of process data. It has21\nlinks with FMIS and electronic control units of implements. The central atomic data22\nmanagement unit that comprises the agricultural resources, products and operations is called23\ntask. Tasks can be generated on the FMIS and MICS. In ISO 11783-1 (ISO 2007) task is24\ndefined as an execution of work on one field for one farm. A maximum of one task can be25\n9active concurrently on a single task controller. The main objectives of the task management1\nare the management of farm resources and field activities (ISO 11783-10:2009). Data transfer2\nbetween FMIS and MICS is bidirectional: planned task is sent to the MICS and resulting3\nlogged data back to the FMIS (Figure 2). The planning data is converted into a standard XML4\nformat and transferred to task controller on a tractor through wireless link or on a memory5\ncard. Task controller sends messages to implements according to the planned task file and logs6\ndata values recorded from a particular processing operation. The collected data is sent back to7\nthe farm computer and converted into an appropriate format. Finally the completed task data is8\nconverted into desired format for further usage or storage.9\n10\nThe ISO 11783 task file is based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) where the11\nelements represent the real world objects. The main task file contains the root element12\nISO_11783_TaskData, coding data, and a number of tasks. Inside the main file, there can be13\nreferences to sub task files, which may each contain a single XML element. During the14\nexecution of tasks the files are modified and binary data appended by MICS.15\n16\nCommunication between FMIS and MICS is based on standardised XML data transfer files,17\nFigure 3. The task controller interface driver is responsible for sending task data to the task18\ncontroller in proprietary or XML format. The task controller converts data from the19\ntransferred task file into process data messages, which contain commands and values to20\ncontrol the relevant implement ECUs on ISO 11783 network.21\n22\n3.4. ISO 11783 sensor data23\n24\n10\nA prototype implementation of agricultural process-data service has been proposed by1\nSteinberger et al. (2009). It is based on data recording in ISO11783 environment, transfer of2\nISO 11783 XML data to the web-server for analysis and storage, and aggregation of3\nAgroXML data to the jobs at FMIS. However, the solution proposed by Iftikhar and Pedersen4\n(2011) for the exchange of sensor data with FMIS was adopted. The main features of this5\napproach are: asynchronous bi-directional data exchange, high-level specification without the6\nneed of hand-coding, user-friendly graphical user interface, standardisation and open source7\ntechnologies. They use platform independent tool RelaXML (Knudsen & Thomsen, 2004) to8\ntransfer data between relational database and XML. The work by Iftikhar and Pedersen (2011)9\nis part of the Danish LandIT project (data integration of farming devices and farming10\nsystems). Following the methodology of Iftikhar and Pedersen (2011) the solution works in11\nthe following way (Figure 4). The database is an integrated database able to store low level12\nsensor readings. It\u2019s structure is based on the ISO 11783:10 standard For example, for13\ndatalogging the following four tables are required: task as the core element, time (includes14\nposition), ProcessDataVariable and DataLogValue. Data export and import is carried out by15\nRelaXML tool, which uses options, concept and structure definition files to perform XML-16\nbased export and import of data (Knudsen and Thomsen, 2006). An options XML file used for17\nspecifying user and site specific settings is needed for both export and import. A concept18\nXML file defining what data to export by creating relations between parent and child19\nelements is needed for export. Additionally, a structure definition file defining the structure of20\nthe generated XML file is needed for export.21\n22\n4. Non-ISO 11783 data collection and management23\n4.1. Non-ISO 11783 sensor data24\n25\n11\nNon-ISO data is likely to be recorded in many formats, and this has been one key challenge in1\nthe adoption of technology in agriculture for many years. Ultimately, all FMIS and other2\nprocessing systems are being designed to use agroXML, as an interchange standard.\u20133\nagroXML is foreseeably going to become widely adopted in agricultural sector (Bareth &4\nDoluschitz, 2010). Therefore, our aim is to complete relevant records in this format from the5\noriginal data. This import process must combine the contents of the data file with other6\nmetadata not present in all formats. It may also include a distillation phase where meaningful7\ndata is separated from irrelevant machine specific data (e.g. combination of multiple8\nindividual load cells into a single specific soil resistance or processing raw TIFF images into9\nNDVI values). The import process is best performed as close to the generation of that record10\nas possible, in real-time or near real-time as suggested by Kitchen (2008), (Figure 5). This11\nmaximises availability of metadata, which is increasingly lost the longer the data is held in12\nincompatible formats. Specifically, in order of preference:13\n1. Where possible, any producer of a third party file should be upgraded to include14\nagroXML output directly.15\n2. A second choice is to provide a format exporter which is incorporated in the workflow16\nto be used by the original operator \u2013integrated with the end of day or data transfer17\nprocess.18\n3. A next choice is to include the function as an import filter at the time data is taken into19\na farm-office system.20\n4. Last choice is that the data is encapsulated in a raw format and incorporated later.21\n22\nAutomated unification will take place through a common data dictionary (semantics), an23\nontology based approach, as demonstrated by Nash et al. (2011 & 2010a). It should also be24\npossible to provide each translator with a manual interface to allow definition of the sematic25\n12\nmapping for the first import between systems. This mapping should be storable in the1\ndestination device to allow future translations to be entirely automated. Although a large2\nnumber of potential sources of data exist, the single target format of agroXML reduces the3\nnumber of translation maps which must be made.4\nThe experience of other industries suggests such mappings can be productively shared in a5\ncommunity (e.g. CDDB for mapping CD tracks to catalogue data). This type of collaborative6\nsharing of community developed input mappings is most effectively performed where systems7\nare connected to the wider internet. The location of such functions is discussed further below.8\nFMIS providers may offer a curatorial service, combining user provided import filters into a9\ncentrally validated update package which is distributed to their users. Alternatively entirely10\nonline services may be provided. As currently found in the industry, it is suggested that11\nimport processes are likely to remain to some extent manufacturer specific or based on de-12\nfacto industry standards. There is however the opportunity for third parties to produce13\ntranslation layers for incorporation in machine controllers or FMIS PC environments where14\noriginal manufacturers are unwilling or unable to provide a solution.15\n16\n4.2. System Structure17\n18\nEntities of the system, shown in Figure 5 are sensors, tractor, MICS, TC, FMIS, central store19\n(e.g. national level servers) and clients (farmers). Data processing may be undertaken at each20\nentity, either locally or with the aid of network (internet) connected centralised systems or21\nservers. Any farm-office system, if it is a single piece of hardware or a more complex local-22\narea-network of servers and clients is considered as a conceptual FMIS. Independent server23\nprocessing has advantages and disadvantages. From an information perspective particular24\nadvantages are:25\n13\n\uf0a7 Combination \/ aggregation of data with other sources not available at a local level,1\neither because of technical limitations (e.g. large maps on handhelds) or administrative2\n\/ license restrictions (e.g. access to national non-farm data).3\n\uf0a7 Provision of independent third party function \u2013 certification to a standard or4\ncertification of holding a record at a particular time (e.g. solicitor registered letters).5\n\uf0a7 Tracking of processes \u2013 generation of non-compliance data.6\n\uf0a7 Multiple access of single data store \u2013 public or limited user group.7\n\uf0a7 Operation of community supplied import routines, where FMIS suppliers are unable or8\nunwilling to provide software update packages, import and translation can be9\nsupported as a community developed function where data is submitted, translated on-10\nserver and immediately returned as agroXML for import to the FMIS. Such processes11\ndo introduce data integrity\/process assurance issues which must be addressed.12\n13\nFrom a technical perspective the advantages are:14\n\uf0a7 Centrally maintained hardware\/software (high and managed availability)15\n\uf0a7 Ensure a common process (code path) applied to all data entered in subsequent16\nsystems.17\n\uf0a7 Unattended, therefore cost per transaction is many orders lower than any process that18\ninvolves a human operator.19\n\uf0a7 Potentially much greater processing power or storage available than on local systems.20\n\uf0a7 Access to wide community input at low cost \u2013 following a wiki model of widely21\nsourced collaboration.22\n23\nWith current technology, server processing may be invoked at any stage of the system, from24\nfield operation onwards. The cost of accessing networks is however usually considerably25\n14\nreduced at the stage of the FMIS, which is office based and has access to relatively low cost1\nhigher bandwidth links compared with earlier parts of the chain. It is acknowledged that rural2\naccess to broadband remains difficult in some areas, however the absolute quantity of data3\nexchange required is low compared to consumer data (video, music) and highly suitable for4\nunattended batch transfer over slow links from the FMIS (overnight etc).5\n6\n4.3. Data from sensors7\n8\nRaw sensor data is not usually taken as an input to this system, as some level of processing9\nand storage is required, even if only to calibrated engineering units. Where smart-sensors are10\nused they should ideally be collected according to ISO 11783:10, however if this is not the11\ncase they should be considered as a general import as per the machine controllers described12\nbelow. An important function in management of sensor systems is in holding and tracking13\ncalibration and setup data to verify data from source. This is likely to be performed at a higher14\nlevel e.g. FMIS, although it requires item tracking identification to machine or sensor level.15\nSuch source identifiers must be passed with data.16\n17\n4.4. MICS18\n19\nMachine controllers usually have significant processing, display and user interface20\ncapabilities. Their software can often be updated and such activities can form part of existing21\nmachine regular maintenance. By this route existing systems may be upgraded to produce22\nagroXML directly as per the order of preference above. Where technical limitations exist (e.g.23\nmemory or display sizes), it may be possible to introduce required additional data fields to24\nbinary formats at the MICS level for later extraction.25\n15\n1\n4.5. FMIS2\n3\nFMIS accepts ISO 11783:10 XML, agroXML and proprietary formats. The FMIS may be4\nuseful to make use of server processing for particular functions (such as wide area5\ngeographical or statistical data), but retains the essential local database requirement. The6\nproposed workflow of utilising the soil data for rules checking is shown in Figures 6 & 7, as7\nfound in literature.8\nThere is a tendency for all data import and translation functions to be focussed at the9\nbeginning of the FMIS. This is technically logical (access to PC computing power, network10\nresources, and office environment for data entry), however, time spent here is highly visible to11\nthe user and to farm management. New import functions to generate agroXML for example12\nwill be perceived as additional time consuming work. Every effort must be made to integrate13\nimport processes and provide user-appropriate interfaces (e.g. selection of a machinery14\nmanufacturer rather than controller manufacturer). The use of community contributed import15\nfunctions should be on a \u201cspecify once, use automatically without further prompting\u201d basis as16\ndiscussed above.17\n4.6. Central services18\nAs well as specific processing functions called as required from the FMIS (e.g. map images,19\nimport functions) central services can provide data storage and backup for a FMIS. Any20\nstorage should be divided into two parts: farmer centric and customer centric. Both would be21\nbased on input and output of agroXM, irrespective of any internal database format.22\nSplitting the database addresses the privacy concerns farmers may have when exposing raw23\ndata. Generally the farmer centric data is kept private to the farm, whereas customer centric24\ndata is \u201creported\u201d to the wider industry. This may be linked to the physical export of product25\n16\nfrom a farm triggering the production of a data record in the customer centric side from the1\nfarm centric side. Then the functionalities of these two stores can be developed independently2\ndepending on the requirements of farmers and customers respectively.3\n4\n4.7. Clients\/farmers5\n6\nSite specific tasks under clients are site specific tillage, fertilisation including NPK and7\norganic fertilisation, lime application, manure injection, irrigation and agrochemical8\napplication. A case study of variable rate fertilisation was discussed in detail in Peets, et al.9\n(2011), as part of deliverable 7.6 of FutureFarm EU FP7 project.10\n11\n5. Case study of variable rate fertilisation12\nA specific example of how the concepts presented above can be used in practice relates to the13\ncollection of on-the-go soil data and how this can be incorporated and interpreted within the14\nFMIS into a real VR application. This case study will consider such a process, specifically as15\napplied to variable rate fertilisation (VRF), which has been chosen as an example. This choice16\nstems from the fact that the vis-NIR on-line sensor has the potential to provide direct benefits17\nto the farmers when adopted for VRF, although limited data is available so far. This is in-line18\nwith the assertion in section 2 about the marketing of automated recording systems. A recent19\nstudy reported a successful sensor-based VRA of P2O5 based on on-the-go measurement of20\nextractable P, achieving an increase in kernel maize yield of 334 kg\/ha due to VRA, as21\ncompared to uniform application of P2O5 (Maleki et al., 2008). In this study, it was found22\nthat the average phosphate applied on plots was 28.75 kg\/ha, which was 1.25 kg\/ha less than23\nthe uniform rate fertilisation (30 kg\/ha), recommended according to the standard soil test (124\nsample per ha). The overall profit was about \u20ac30 per ha, by only applying variable rate P2O5..25\n17\n1\nDifferent European countries obey different rules for VRF, which need to be unified in one2\nset of rules across the continent. Therefore, we will focus, in this case study, on the German3\nfertilisation rules only. These rules have to be integrated into the FMIS as shown in Fig. (8).4\nThey are set for the determination of available soil nutrient amounts in soil, which is a5\nrequirement before application of significant nutrient amounts. Among others the following6\nmost relevant rules are considered (http:\/\/ test.futurefarm.eu):7\n8\n\uf0a7 Rule 3.1. Determination of fertilisation need by crop is required before application of9\nsignificant nutrient amounts. Requirements for conservation of site-specific soil10\nfertility have to be considered additionally. The determination of fertilisation need has11\nto guarantee a balance between foreseeable nutrient demand and nutrient supply.12\n\uf0a7 Rule 3.2: This rule concretizes how the determination of fertilisation need has to be13\ndone. For every field or production unit the farmer should consider site-specific14\nnutrient demand (earning, quality), soil fertility (nutrients from previous crop and15\norganic fertilisers, soil lime content (pH) and organic matter content, other nutrient16\nsupplies (irrigation) and cultivation conditions.17\n\uf0a7 Rule 3.3: Determination of available soil nutrient amounts is required before18\napplication of significant nutrient amounts. The vis-NIR on-line sensor is used to19\ncollect the required data.20\n\uf0a7 Rule 3.4: Fertiliser application time and amount have to be chosen so that available21\nnutrients correspond to crops nutrient need.22\n\uf0a7 Rule 4.3: The maximum allowable amount of nitrogen from farm fertilisers of animal23\nsource is 170 kg per hectare and year (average of all used agricultural areas of the24\nfarm).25\n18\n\uf0a7 Rule 4.4: This is a exception from German Duengeverordnung rule 4.3. The1\nmaximum amount of nitrogen from farm fertilisers of animal source is 230 kg per2\nhectare and year on grassland and field grass (average of grassland and field grass3\nareas of the farm).4\n\uf0a7 Rule 8.1: Applied mineral fertilisers must comply to German Duengemittelverordnung5\nor Regulation No. 2003\/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council regarding a6\ntype of fertiliser. Applied farm fertilisers, soil helper, culture substrates and plant7\nhelpers must comply to German Duengemittelverordnung regarding the composition8\nand declaration of ingredients.9\n10\nFigure 8 shows the process of VRF, considering the German rules of fertilisation as an11\nexample. The on-the-go vis-NIR sensor (Mouazen, 2006) will provide most of the required12\ndata on soil, namely, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), moisture content, P (Maleki13\net al., 2008) and pH (Mouazen et al., 2007). The high resolution data of about 2000 readings14\nper ha obtained with the on-the-go sensor will enable carrying out both map-based and15\nsensor-based VRF. However, fertilisation recommendations are strongly dependent on soil,16\nclimate, crop and environmental conditions and, not surprisingly, methods to achieve this are17\ncalled \u201cphilosophies\u201d (Build-Up and Maintenance; Basic Cation Saturation, Percent18\nSufficiency Concept; Hydroponics). However, map-based VRA can build in errors through19\nthe use of a positioning system during data acquisition and in the interpolation between20\ndiscrete observations during creation of application maps (Morgan and Ess, 1997). The21\nsensor-based variable rate application is based only on data collected automatically by on-the-22\ngo sensors and models that transfer sensor output into application. The sensor-based VRA are23\nonly possible when on-the-go sensors for measurement of soil properties provide accurate24\n19\ndata on a specific soil property to enable real time VRA, without the need for data on crop and1\nother ancillary data.2\n3\nAfter on-the-go data collection, the non-ISOBUS data will be imported into the FMIS by4\nmeans of an Import service (Figure 5). The German rules of VRF should be incorporated into5\nFMIS, so that decisions on VRF are made by an external expert or by a future decision6\nsupport system, taking into consideration these rules. Since available nitrogen is needed for7\nVRF of nitrogen, map-based VRF will be the preference possibility.. The map-based will8\nassist obeying to the German rules of fertilisation mentioned above and fit with the sensor9\noutput, which provides measurement of total nitrogen that has to be transformed into available10\nN by accounting for the nitrogen mineralisation rate and using advanced modelling11\ntechniques. The data collected on soil (N, C, pH and P) will then be integrated into FMIS as12\ninternal sensor data, as shown in Figure 9 (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2009).13\n14\nHowever, with sensor-based variable rate application all steps adopted during the map-based15\nVRF have to be executed on-the-go, while the fertiliser equipment is running in the field. In16\nthis case, farmers will comply with the most German rules of fertilisation available in FMIS17\n(e.g. rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 8.1). However some of these rules (e.g 4.3 and 4.4.) should be18\nconsidered during the on-the-go VRF. Therefore, a modelling scheme should be considered in19\norder to transfer the on-the-go collected data into fertilisation recommendation dosage (Figure20\n9). Wireless data communication will allow for this application to be fulfilled. In the21\nmodelling stage a threshold of maximum application of N should be considered. This22\nmaximum dosage should not exceed the maximum allowable N fertilisation of 170 and 23023\nkg\/ha according to the rules 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. The other German rules listed above are24\ncomplied prior to the field VRF in case of sensor-based application.25\n20\n1\nConclusions2\n3\nThe paper discussed the potential and has introduced general procedures for on-the-go data4\nacquisition of soil sensors. The methods and procedures were used to manage data with5\nrespect to farm management information system (FMIS). The following conclusions can be6\ndrawn:7\n\uf0a7 The preferred route for automated collection of on-the-go sensor data is the integration8\nof sensors with ISO 11783 data network. This facilitates the adoption of the common9\nagricultural data exchange standard. A relational database with the structure based on10\nISO 11783:10 task file is suitable for storage of acquired data. RelaXML tool provides11\nuser friendly data export and import between database and TC.12\n\uf0a7 Non-ISO 11783 compliant sensor data is proposed to be transferred into the FMIS13\nultimately as agroXML by using an import service based on local or public sharing of14\nsemantic mapping. The performance of the import service is the key challenge in15\nmanagement of sensor data.16\n\uf0a7 There is a significant potential benefit in time-saving from the adoption of standards to17\nensure robust transfer of in-field data. This may be directly accepted by farmers who18\nalready perceive information gathering to be the most time consuming element of field19\nmanagement.20\n21\nA further work is needed to develop or upgrade the current procedures considered for the22\nintegration of on-the-go data, collected with wireless technologies into FMIS.23\n24\nAcknowledgements25\n21\nThis project was part of the collaborative research project FutureFarm.
