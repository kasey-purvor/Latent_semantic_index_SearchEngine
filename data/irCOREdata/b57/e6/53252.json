These include environmental filtering (i.e., tolerance of the abiotic environment, Weiher 7 \nand Keddy 1999), interspecific competition for resources (Tilman 1982), enemy-mediated negative 8 \ndensity dependence (Janzen 1970, Connell 1971), and limited dispersal coupled with demographic 9 \nstochasticity (Hubbell 2001). The outcome of these processes may be reflected in the phylogenetic 10 \nstructure and distribution of functional traits in a community (Webb et al. 2002, Cavender-Bares et al. 11 \n2004).  12 \nInterpretation of these patterns depends on the spatial scale of analyses and the degree of 13 \nfunctional trait conservatism (Webb et al. 2002). When functional traits are phylogenetically 14 \nconserved, environmental filtering at the community scale from a regional pool of species should 15 \nlead to a clustered (i.e., more related than expected) phylogenetic community structure while competitive 16 \ninteractions between co-existing species should result in the opposite (i.e., overdispersed) pattern, albeit 17 \nat a neighbourhood (<100 m) scale. On the other hand, environmental filtering can generate 18 \nphylogenetic overdispersion when traits from distantly related taxa have converged in response to similar 19 \nniche use. In reality, simple interpretations of phylogenetic overdispersion and clustering patterns gloss 20 \nover much of the complexity inherent in community assembly processes (Vamosi et al. 2009).  21 \nMost empirical studies that have simultaneously investigated phylogenetic and functional 22 \ncommunity structure as a means to provide insights into community assembly processes have done so by 23 \ncomparing static community patterns at various spatial scales (e.g., Swenson and Enquist 2009). The 24 \nimplicit assumption of this research is that phylogenetic or functional community structure reflects the 25 \nPage 4 \n \ninfluence of antecedent processes, such as environmental filtering or competitive interactions, on 1 \ndemographic rates. A number of studies have also investigated how the nature and spatial scale of 2 \nphylogenetic community structure changes with life history stage or tree size (e.g., Swenson et al. 2007), 3 \nas well as the relationship between demographic rates and functional characteristics of species (e.g,, 4 \nPoorter et al. 2008). Despite these advances, no empirical studies have simultaneously quantified and 5 \ncompared the relative importance of functional similarity and shared ancestry in shaping spatial 6 \ninteractions among tree species, the effects that these interactions have on demographic rates, and the 7 \nobserved phylogenetic and functional structure at the neighborhood spatial scale at which these processes 8 \ntake place.  9 \nUnderstanding the relative importance of phylogenetic and functional traits in predicting the 10 \neffect of interactions among species on tree demography will provide important insights into community 11 \nassembly processes. Given that key functional traits are robust indicators of plant performance and 12 \ncompetitive strategies (Grime 1977; Reich et al. 1997; Weiher et al. 1999; Westoby et al. 2002), a 13 \nsuperior predictive performance of functional traits relative to phylogeny in shaping spatial interactions 14 \nbetween neighboring trees might suggest that niche differentiation in resource capture is more important 15 \nin shaping community assembly at this scale than phylogenetic relatedness. On the other hand, if 16 \nphylogenetic relatedness better predicts the demographic effect of neighborhood (<20 m) spatial 17 \ninteractions between tree species, phylogenetically conserved species characteristics different from 18 \ncommonly measured functional traits, such as defensive compounds against shared enemies, may be 19 \nimportant for community assembly (Gilbert and Webb 2007).  20 \nOur goal in this paper is to use spatially-explicit, neighborhood models of tree growth and 21 \nsurvival for 19 tree species, together with a highly-resolved DNA barcode molecular phylogeny and 22 \ninformation on eight functional traits, to examine the relative importance of phylogeny and functional 23 \ntrait values in structuring neighborhood interactions between tree species. The detection of a phylogenetic 24 \nsignal for biotic interactions may be more easily detected at small (< 100 m2) spatial scales (Webb et al. 25 \n2002). By focusing our analyses at the neighborhood scale, we expect to simultaneously quantify the 26 \nPage 5 \n \neffect of individual interactions that lead to competitive exclusion and the degree to which 1 \nenvironmental filtering operates at this scale. We employ tree growth and survival data collected in 2 \nthe successional communities in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), in Puerto Rico.  3 \nOur analyses address three fundamental questions for species coexistence.  First, we ask whether 4 \nthe strength of neighborhood interactions between species is proportional to relative distance in mean trait 5 \nvalues. The rationale for this hypothesis is that species with higher mean trait values (e.g., leaf N) would 6 \ncompete more strongly for resources (e.g., N) than species with lower values. Support for this premise 7 \nwould suggest that competitive interactions for limiting resources among trees may have contributed to 8 \ncommunity assembly. Second, we ask whether greater phylogenetic relatedness results in stronger 9 \nnegative neighborhood interactions between tree species. Interpretation of these patterns depends on the 10 \ndegree of phylogenetic trait conservatism (Webb et al. 2002). Third, we ask whether the answers to 11 \nquestions 1 and 2 can be interpreted in light of observed changes in the phylogenetic and functional trait 12 \ncomposition of tree neighborhoods over time. To do so, we compared the composition of phylogenetic 13 \nand functional traits in the neighborhoods (including all trees) of dead and live focal trees for each focal 14 \nspecies. We expect that if functional traits modulate the demographic effects of neighborhood interactions 15 \n(i.e., that focal tree survival and growth are lower in the neighborhood of functionally similar species) the 16 \ntrait structure of tree neighborhoods will reflect the relative strength of environmental filtering versus 17 \nspecies interactions at the local spatial scale.  Prevalence of trait-mediated competitive interactions may 18 \nresult in greater trait similarity in the neighborhoods of dead trees relative to those of live trees while 19 \npredominance of local-scale environmental filtering should result in the opposite pattern (Table 1).  This 20 \nbelief stems from the assumption that there are environmental factors (e.g., soil moisture) that influence 21 \ndemographic rates at this scale independently from spatial interactions between neighbors. The same 22 \npredictions hold when neighborhood interactions are affected by phylogenetic relatedness. 23 \nBecause they reflect community assembly in action, successional tropical forests provide an ideal 24 \nnatural laboratory for testing the power of an integrated functional trait and phylogenetic approach to 25 \nPage 6 \n \ncommunity assembly. High leaf nitrogen content and low wood density, functional traits associated with 1 \nfast growth, are characteristic of early successional species (Bazzaz and Pickett 1980). In contrast, later in 2 \nsuccession, biotic filters associated with Janzen-Connell effects may play a more important role in species 3 \ndynamics and therefore species with functional traits related to defense (e.g., leaf toughness) should be 4 \nfavored; these effects may also extend to closely related species (Uriarte et al. 2004b). 5 \nMETHODS 6 \nStudy site and field surveys 7 \nThe Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) is a 16-ha permanent forest plot (SW corner 18\u00b0 20\u2019 N, 65\u00b0 8 \n49\u2019 W) located in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. The forest is classified as subtropical wet in the 9 \nHoldridge life zone system (Ewel and Whitmore 1973). Rainfall averages 3,500 mm per year. Elevation 10 \nranges from 333 to 428 m a.s.l. The LFDP was established in 1990. Censuses are carried out every five 11 \nyears. All free- standing woody stems \u22651 cm diameter at 130 cm from the ground (dbh) in the LFDP are 12 \ntagged, identified to species, mapped, and measured (Thompson et al. 2002).  13 \nSpecies selection -- The LFDP contains on average 89 species of trees with stems \u2265 10 cm dbh 14 \ndistributed over 72 genera and 38 families. Our research and modeling focus on 19 species that display a 15 \nwide variation of life history characteristics (Table 2) (Zimmerman et al. 1994, Uriarte et al. 2004a), had 16 \nmore than 400 individuals \u2265 1cm dbh of which at least 70 died between the 1990 and 1995 censuses. 17 \nThese criteria ensured that we could obtain robust parameter estimates. Together these species account for 18 \napproximately 85% of stems \u226510 cm dbh in the plot. 19 \nHurricane damage--Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck the LFDP in 1989 causing significant 20 \ndamage (Zimmerman et al. 1994). The first census started in 1990, the year after Hurricane Hugo. This 21 \ncensus included an initial categorical estimate of damage for all stems \u226510 cm dbh to prevent loss of data 22 \ndue to decomposition of trees killed or damaged by Hurricane Hugo. Damage observations were 23 \nclassified into three categories: (1) no or light damage (< 25% of crown volume removed by the storm), 24 \nPage 7 \n \n(2) medium damage (25 \u2013 75% of crown volume lost), or (3) heavy or complete (> 75% of the crown lost, 1 \nstem snapped, root break, or tip-up). 2 \nTrait and phylogeny data-- Trait data for all woody species present in the LFDP were derived 3 \nfrom vegetation samples collected using standardized protocols (Cornelissen et al. 2003). Samples were 4 \ncollected to calculate species mean leaf traits (25 samples) and wood specific gravity (10 samples). We 5 \nselected eight functional traits that are believed to represent fundamental functional trade-offs in life-6 \nhistory differentiation among tree species (Wright et al. 2007). These include leaf area (cm2), specific leaf 7 \narea (cm2\/g), leaf nitrogen content (%N), leaf phosphorus content (%P), leaf succulence (g H2O\/cm2 leaf 8 \narea), wood specific gravity (g\/cm3), maximum tree height (m), and seed mass (g). Details on phylogeny 9 \nconstruction and results are provided in Kress et al. (In press). 10 \n 11 \nSpatially-explicit models of tree growth and survival 12 \nWe used data from the 1990 and 1995 censuses of the LFDP to develop neighborhood models of tree 13 \ngrowth and survival for 19 of the common tree species (Table 2).  The difference in dbh between the first 14 \nand second census together with the time difference between censuses were used to calculate average 15 \nannual growth rate for each tree. Annual mortality estimates were obtained from mortality records from 16 \nthe second census and time between censuses for each individual tree. Although the palm Prestoea 17 \nacuminata is the most abundant species at the site, we did not analyze it as a focal species in our growth 18 \nmodel because diameter measurements do not reflect growth for this species. We considered all species in 19 \nthe plot as potential neighbors. 20 \nOur modelling approach relies on traditional distance-dependent analyses of competition, in which 21 \ntree growth is analysed as a function of the sizes and distances to neighbouring trees (see references in 22 \nUriarte et al. 2004b). We assume that each individual has a species-specific maximum potential growth 23 \nrate, which is adjusted to account for the size of the focal tree, the structure and composition of its 24 \nneighborhood, and previous hurricane damage to both the focal tree and its neighbors (Uriarte et al. 25 \n2004a). A similar approach was used to estimate survival. Our models take the form: 26 \nPage 8 \n \ng = gm \u03d5  \u03b4 \u03bd         [Eqn. 1]  1 \nwhere g is predicted growth, gm is an estimated species-specific maximum potential growth, \u03d5  is the 2 \nhurricane effect, \u03b4 is the size effect and \u03bd is the neighborhood effect. A similar approach was taken for 3 \nsurvival analyses. 4 \nHurricane Effects.-- Hurricane damage affects potential maximum growth rate and probability of 5 \nsurvival of the focal tree species (\u03d5, in Eqns. 1a & b). Damage also alters the crowding effects of 6 \nneighbors (see Neighborhood Effects). 7 \nSize Effects on Growth.-- Potential radial growth is assumed to vary with the dbh of the focal tree. 8 \nWe use a lognormal function for the shape of this effect, because it is flexible, and supported by both 9 \ntheoretical and empirical evidence (Uriarte et al. 2004a): 10 \n2\n2\n1 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2212\n= bm\nX\n)X\/DBHln(\nexp*gg     [Eqn. 2] 11 \nwhere gm is the maximum potential radial growth (cm\/yr)  in the absence of neighbors (i.e. at the peak of 12 \nthe lognormal shape), X0 is the dbh at which gm occurs, and Xb determines the breadth of the function.  13 \nNeighborhood Effects-- The net effect of a neighboring tree on the growth of a focal tree of a 14 \ngiven species is assumed to vary as a function of the size of the neighbor, and inversely with distance to 15 \nthe neighbor. The effect of an individual neighbor is multiplied by a species-specific scalar \u03bbs [0 \u20131] 16 \nwhich allows for differences among species in their competitive effect on a focal tree. The neighborhood 17 \ncrowding index for individual focal of species k is: 18 \n \n \nNCI focal,k  =    \n \nDBH focal,k\n\u03b3\n \n\u03bbik\nj=1\nni\n\u2211\ni=1\nS\n\u2211 DBH j\na k\nDistance j\n\u03b2 k\n                                [Eqn. 3] 19 \nwhere\n \nDBH focal,k\n\u03b3  is the DBH of that focal individual, weighted by an exponent \n \n\u03b3  that characterizes the 20 \nsize sensitivity of individuals the focal species k to neighborhood effects.  The double sum is over S 21 \nspecies and the \n \nni neighbors of each species i in the focal individual\u2019s neighborhood of estimated 22 \nmaximum radius R.  The parameter \n \n\u03bbik  is a pairwise competition coefficient, and it estimates the per-23 \nPage 9 \n \ncapita effect of species i on species k. Parameters \n \n\u03b1kand \n \n\u03b2k allow non-linear scaling of the effects of 1 \nneighbor size and distance on focal species k.  The parameter \u03b7 is drawn from a vector with three possible 2 \nvalues that correspond to the three levels of hurricane damage to a neighboring tree. Neighborhood effects 3 \n(v) are translated into actual effect on growth or survival by using a negative exponential function of NCI. 4 \nD\niCNCIexpv \u2212=          [Eqn. 4] 5 \nwhere C and D are species-specific estimated parameters, and NCIi is the neighborhood competition 6 \nindex for focal tree i. To avoid edge effects, we excluded from the analyses all focal trees that were within 7 \n20 m of the edge of the plot. 8 \nOur motivation for this study was to explore the degree to which species functional traits and 9 \nphylogenetic relatedness can explain the effects of spatial interactions between species on tree 10 \ndemography. To this end, we compared 13 models that make different assumptions about the nature of 11 \nthese interactions (i.e., values of \u03bb in Eqn. 3). The simplest \u201ccontrol\u201d model assumed that only tree size 12 \ninfluenced focal tree growth and survival.  The second model assumed that all neighbors had equivalent 13 \neffects on the focal tree regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity. The third model 14 \ndifferentiated between conspecific and heterospecific neighbors. In a fourth set of models, we assigned a 15 \nfixed \u03bb to each competitor scaled to the maximum phylogenetic distance calculated using the DNA 16 \nbarcode phylogeny. Values of \u03bb for conspecifics for this model were assumed to be 1 (no distance) and 17 \neffects of neighbors were scaled from 0-1 according to phylogenetic distance to the focal species. Finally, 18 \nwe evaluated a set of 9 trait-based models (Models #5-12) by assigning \u03bb values based on the difference 19 \nin mean trait values among species. For each of the 8 traits considered, competition coefficients were 20 \nscaled to the maximum observed values in the community with 1 being the effect of a neighbor from the 21 \nspecies with the highest mean value for that trait (e.g., highest wood specific gravity). Leaf area and seed 22 \nweight were log-transformed prior to scaling. As many of the traits are correlated, a PCA was conducted 23 \nto reduce the dimensionality of the data. The first three axes of the PCA were used in a hierarchical 24 \nclustering algorithm that produced a trait distance matrix (Appendix II). Using this matrix, we considered 25 \nPage 10 \n \nan additional trait-based model (Model #13) that scaled \u03bb values based on composite trait distance. Note 1 \nthat this formulation of competitive effects based on trait data assumes that the strongest competitive 2 \neffect accrues to the species with the highest trait value. For instance, if species A has the maximum trait 3 \nvalue of 1, sp. B of 0.5, and species C of 0.1, our formulation scales the relative trait dissimilarity 4 \nbetween species B and species C to 0.4 and but that between species A and C to 0.9.  As such, it provides 5 \nan index of niche differentiation (i.e., trait dissimilarity) among species. 6 \nModel parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood. Initial parameter values are 7 \nsummarized in Appendix III. We calculated asymptotic 95% support limits for each of the parameters. 8 \nThe 13 models were compared using Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) and Akaike weights with the 9 \nbest candidate model having the lowest AIC and highest weightm (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We 10 \nassessed the goodness of fit of our growth models using traditional regression statistics (R2) and the slope 11 \nof the regression of observed radial growth on predicted radial growth was used to measure bias. For 12 \nmortality analyses, we used compared the percentage of trees in a given predicted survival bin (0-10%, 13 \n10.01-20%, etc) (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). 14 \n 15 \nComparison of neighborhood models of tree demography with phylogenetic and functional trait 16 \nstructure  17 \nTo assess the congruence of our models with static phylogenetic and trait structure patterns, we calculated 18 \nabundance weighted neighborhood (20 m) phylogenetic relatedness indices (NRI) and functional trait 19 \nsimilarity (TSI) for live and dead trees in census 2 for all focal species. Live trees recruited between the 20 \n1990 and 1995 censuses were excluded from all calculations because they did not enter into the 21 \nneighborhood models. We considered all the species in the LFDP as the community pool. The trait 22 \ndistance matrix was used as input to calculate TSI using the same procedure as for NRI.  23 \nInterpretation of our results regarding the importance of niche differentiation versus 24 \nenvironmental filtering in structuring the phylogenetic structure of neighborhoods depends on the degree 25 \nof phylogenetic trait conservatism. We employed trait data and the LFDP phylogeny to test whether 26 \nPage 11 \n \nfunctional traits were phylogenetically using Blomberg's K statistic (Blomberg et al. 2003). Where 1 \nnecessary, trait values were normalized using log transformations. All analyses were conducted using R 2 \nstatistical software (R Development Team 2008). 3 \nRESULTS 4 \nLikelihood and Goodness of Fit of Growth and Survival Models 5 \nWe estimated maximum likelihood parameter values for 13 growth and survival models for 19 selected 6 \nfocal species with the goal of quantifying the importance of phylogenetic distance and trait similarity in 7 \nstructuring neighborhood interactions (Table 3, Appendix IV). The percent of variance in individual 8 \ngrowth rates explained by the most parsimonious models ranged from 2% for Trichilia pallida to 23% for 9 \nSchefflera morototoni while the fit of the survival model ranged from 29% for Myrcia deflexa to 99% for 10 \nseveral species (Table 3).. 11 \nNeighborhood effects on growth and survival 12 \nGrowth.-- For the growth analyses, 12 of the 18 species examined (i.e., excluding Prestoea acuminata) 13 \nprovided support for a model for which differences among species in mean trait values structured 14 \nneighborhood interactions (Table 3, Appendix IV). Of these 12 species, six supported a model that scaled 15 \nneighborhood interactions according to differences in wood specific gravity, two in species leaf 16 \nsucculence, and two in maximum tree height. The final two species in this group of 12 exhibited support 17 \nfor more than one growth model: Tabebuia heterophylla had similar Akaike weights for the wood specific 18 \ngravity and leaf succulence models, and Drypetes glauca supported the maximum tree height and 19 \nequivalent competitor model. The six species in the growth analyses that did not support a trait-based 20 \nmodel were distributed among the size only model (2 species), the equivalent competitors model (2 21 \nspecies), and the model that differentiated between conspecifics and heterospecific neighbors (2 species) 22 \n(Table 3). None of the 18 species included in the growth analyses displayed any support for the 23 \nphylogenetic distance neighborhood model as evidenced by extremely low Akaike weights for this set of 24 \nmodels (Appendix IV). 25 \nPage 12 \n \nSurvival.--In general, the relative strength of evidence in support of any one particular model at 1 \nthe community level was weaker for survival than growth (Appendix IV). Three species, Cecropia 2 \nschreberiana, Casearia sylvestris, and Inga laurina, supported the phylogenetic distance model although 3 \nonly C. schreberiana exhibited strong support of this model. For five of the focal species, Alchornea 4 \nlatifolia, Casearia arborea, Ocotea leucoxylon, Schefflera morototoni and Trichilia pallida, a simplified 5 \nmodel that distinguished between conspecific and heterospecific neighbors was the most parsimonious 6 \n(Table 3). Only size influenced the probability of survival for Cordia borinquensis and Myrcia deflexa.  7 \nFor the remaining nine species, models that distinguished between neighbors on the basis of mean 8 \nfunctional trait values provided a significantly better fit to the data. Nevertheless, there were no clear 9 \npatterns in the success of any one trait in predicting neighborhood effects on survival. Interestingly, none 10 \nof the 19 species supported the equivalent competitor model for survival, in contrast to the results for the 11 \ngrowth models. 12 \nComparison of Model Results and Neighborhood Structure 13 \nTo assess the congruence of the results of the neighborhood analyses with phylogenetic and 14 \nfunctional neighborhood structure, we compared phylogenetic distance (NRI) and trait similarity (TSI) of 15 \nall trees (live and dead) in a 20 m radius surrounding live or dead trees for the 19 focal species. Overall, 16 \nthe NRI and TSI of neighbors surrounding live trees was greater than around dead trees, indicating greater 17 \nphylogenetic and trait dispersion in neighborhoods of dead focal trees (Mean NRI Dead = -0.43 \u00b10.04 18 \nS.E, mean NRI Alive = -0.26\u00b1 0.04 S.E.; ANOVA, F=9.65, d.f.= 1, 38, p=0.003, mean TSI dead= -0.10  19 \n\u00b10.08 S.E, mean TSI Alive= 0.32 \u00b10.10 S.E, ANOVA, F= 13.14, d.f. = 1, 38, p<0.0001, Fig. 2, Table 4). 20 \nAll species that supported trait-mediated, neighborhood survival models had greater trait similarity in the 21 \nneighborhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees (Table 4). In contrast, for two out of the three 22 \nspecies that supported the phylogenetic distance survival model, Casearia sylvestris and Cecropia 23 \nschreberiana, phylogenetic relatedness was greater in the neighborhood of live relative to dead trees 24 \nPage 13 \n \n(Tables 3 & 4). For the third species, Inga laurina, the NRI for neighborhoods of live trees was greater 1 \nthan for dead trees. 2 \nWe also detected an effect of successional status on the phylogenetic structure of neighborhoods. 3 \nSpecifically, neighborhoods (dead and live trees combined) of late-successional species were more 4 \nphylogenetically clustered than those of pioneer species (ANOVA, F = 4.19, d.f. = 2, 37, p=0.02, Fig. 2a). 5 \nFunctional trait similarity varied in a similar manner across successional groups; neighborhoods of late 6 \nsuccessional species had greater functional similarity than those of pioneer and secondary forest species 7 \n(ANOVA, F= 7.15, d.f. = 2,37, p=0.002, Fig. 2b).  8 \nResults from our analyses must be interpreted in light of the degree of phylogenetic trait 9 \nconservatism found for this community. Contrary to previous analyses (Swenson et al. 2007), we relied 10 \non a more resolved phylogeny with trait data collected at the site, rather than taken from the literature. We 11 \nfound a significant phylogenetic signal for only three of the nine traits tested: leaf % phosphorus, leaf 12 \narea, and seed mass (Appendix VI). For those three traits, values were more phylogenetically conserved 13 \nthan would be predicted by a random association between phylogeny and traits. 14 \n  DISCUSSION 15 \nEffects of Phylogenetic Distance and Trait Similarity on Neighborhood Interactions 16 \nOnly three of the 19 species included in these analyses support a model that assumes that phylogenetic 17 \nproximity augments the strength of neighborhood interactions between species. In contrast, over 60% of 18 \nthe 19 species supported models in which the effects of spatial neighborhood interactions on tree growth 19 \nand survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values. Consequently, for the majority 20 \nof abundant tree species in the LFDP, shared ancestry, at least beyond the conspecific\/heterospecific 21 \ndichotomy, does not mediate the effects of neighborhood interactions on tree growth and survival. Rather, 22 \ndifferences in trait values that reflect plant performance and functional competitive strategies moderate 23 \nnegative competitive interactions among species at this stage (Grime 1977, Reich et al. 1997, Westoby et 24 \nal. 2002). These results suggest that stronger negative density dependent effects among conspecifics 25 \nrelative to interactions with heterospecifics found in previous studies may simply reflect greater similarity 26 \nPage 14 \n \nin resource requirements. Strong effects of shared ancestry on seedling recruitment may still be important 1 \n(Webb. et al. 2006, G\u00f3nzalez et al. 2010) but they do not appear to extend into the sapling and adult life 2 \nhistory stages for most species in this study. Moreover, the large amount of unexplained variation in 3 \ngrowth may be the result of heterogeneity in underlying environmental gradients that influences 4 \ndemographic rates independently from neighborhood interactions (Canham et al. 2006), or legacies of 5 \nhistorical negative competitive interactions between seedlings.  6 \nThe lack of a strong phylogenetic signal in neighborhood interactions may reflect the relatively 7 \nlow number of species in this tropical forest (e.g., 140 woody species in the LFDP relative to 300 in BCI, 8 \nPanama). In a study in the BCI plot, Uriarte et al. (2004b) found that con-familiar neighbors had greater 9 \neffects on focal tree growth than non-confamilials, possibly the result of shared enemies. However, that 10 \nsort of study is not possible in the LFDP because of the low numbers of congeners and confamilials for 11 \nmost species. In addition, previous studies using less well-resolved phylogenies to assess trait 12 \nconservatism found that some traits included in this analysis were phylogenetically conserved (Chazdon 13 \net al. 2003, Chave et al. 2006, Swenson et al. 2007). Together these results suggest that phylogenetic 14 \nrelationships may be important in mediating species interactions at the generic or familial level but 15 \nfunctional trait may be more informative as at finer resolutions. Previous analyses at this site using 16 \nPhylomatic found phylogenetic signal in trait data (Swenson et al. 2007), in contrast to the present study 17 \nwhich relied on a molecular phylogeny. The K statistic used here is quite sensitive to branch lengths. 18 \nAlthough Phylomatic community phylogenies have crudely estimated node ages and branch lengths, it is 19 \nlikely that the contrasting levels of phylogenetic signal between the two studies are the result of 20 \ndifferences in estimated branch lengths for the two trees. Refining hypotheses about the effects of shared 21 \nancestry on community assembly processes may require a better understanding of tree diversity, 22 \nresolution, and topology on these metrics (Vamosi et al. 2009, Cavender-Bares et al. 2009).  23 \nThere were no clear patterns in the groupings of species that supported different models. 24 \nMembership in a family, genus, or functional group was not a good predictor of the response of species to 25 \nthe structure of the neighborhood interactions. For instance, species that supported the wood specific 26 \nPage 15 \n \ngravity growth models ranged from pioneer (Schefflera morototoni) to late successional (Manilkara 1 \nbidentata). Similarly, there were no clear patterns along taxonomic lines. The congeners Casearia 2 \narborea and Casearia sylvestris supported different growth and survival models. Despite this variation, 3 \nthere are several conclusions we can draw from the analyses. First, the strong showing of wood specific 4 \ngravity in the growth models corroborates results from other studies that found a strong link between 5 \ngrowth and wood specific gravity, presumably because diameter growth is directly related to the 6 \nconstruction costs of wood (Poorter et al. 2008). Similarly, leaf succulence plays an important role in the 7 \nmaintenance of green foliage during drought, a critical requirement for sustained growth in forests subject 8 \nto dry spells (Cornelissen et al. 1997). Maximum tree height, which found some support in both survival 9 \nand growth models, is a good predictor of crown exposure and hence, competition for light (Kohyama 10 \n1993). Second, effects of traits that were phylogenetically conserved (leaf % P, leaf area, and seed mass) 11 \nhad very weak support in the neighborhood models of growth and survival. This finding suggests that 12 \nevolutionary lability (i.e., the absence of trait conservatism) may facilitate species coexistence 13 \n(Silvertown et al. 2006, but see Ackerly et al. 2006). Third, growth of focal species was more sensitive to 14 \nfiner gradations in the identity of neighbors than survival. This may simply reflect the fact that the 15 \nmajority of mortality occurred in small size classes whereas growth was estimated across the whole range 16 \nof sizes therefore incorporated a greater range of responses to crowding. Alternatively, relatively low 17 \nnumbers of dead trees or lack of variation in the composition of tree neighborhoods for some species may 18 \nhave hindered our ability to detect distinct responses to the identity of neighbors.  19 \nComparison of Model Results and Neighborhood Structure 20 \nTo assess the congruence of model results with static community patterns, we evaluated the phylogenetic 21 \nand functional trait structure in the neighborhoods of dead and live trees for each focal species. The 22 \nabsence of phylogenetic signal for most of the traits supported by the neighborhood models allows us to 23 \ninterpret trait and phylogenetic patterns largely independently. Overall, we observed greater functional 24 \ntrait similarity in the neighborhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees. Together with strong 25 \nPage 16 \n \nsupport for trait-mediated neighborhood models, these results suggest that environmental filtering is the 1 \nmajor force structuring this community at the neighborhood scale while competitive interactions play a 2 \nrelatively minor role. This is not surprising given that environmental filters can have strong effects on 3 \ndemographic rates (Weiher and Keddy 1995, Cavender-Bares et al. 2004). In contrast to the majority of 4 \nspecies that supported trait-based models, we found greater phylogenetic relatedness in the neighborhood 5 \nof dead trees relative to those of live trees for two out of the three species that supported the phylogenetic 6 \ndistance model. These outcomes are consistent with a predominance of negative competitive interaction 7 \nbetween closely related species relative to environmental filtering. High rates of tree mortality and intense 8 \nthinning of individuals of early- and mid- successional species as the hurricane damaged canopy closed 9 \nmay have increased the likelihood of detecting effects of competitive interactions on demographic 10 \nprocesses for these two species. Nevertheless, we failed to find this pattern for other early succesional 11 \nspecies (e.g., S. morototoni) suggesting that environmental filtering is more important in driving 12 \nneighborhood structure for these species. One potential reason for this pattern is that mortality may be 13 \nless spatially clustered in these species (e.g., recruited into smaller gaps after the hurricane) allowing for 14 \nless taxonomic variation around dead trees. 15 \nPhylogenetic and functional trait structure of tree neighborhoods differed considerably between 16 \nsuccessional groups. Both trait and phylogenetic similarity were greater for live late successional species 17 \nthan for other groups. Late successional species share certain traits such as greater wood specific gravity, 18 \nlower leaf % N and P, larger seed weights, and low specific leaf area and may be present in areas with 19 \nrelatively little disturbance leading to greater trait similarity in the neighborhood of these species (Bazzaz 20 \nand Pickett 1980). Coupled with the outcomes of the neighborhood models, these results are consistent 21 \nwith an increasing importance of environmental filtering relative to competitive interactions during 22 \nsuccession, at least at this neighborhood scale. This was a surprising result given that pathogen-mediated 23 \nneighborhood interactions on seedling mortality are expected to intensify during succession (Comita et al. 24 \n2009), and may extend to closely related species (Webb et al. 2006, Gilbert and Webb 2007). The only 25 \nother study to examine shifts in phylogenetic relatedness through succession found increased 26 \nPage 17 \n \noverdispersion in older relative to younger sites in a chronosequence (Letcher 2009). However, these 1 \nfindings were the result of recruitment of species present in the regional pool representing different 2 \nlineages as succession proceeded (Norden et al. 2009), a factor not included in this study.  3 \nDespite considerable efforts to understand the processes that generate variation in functional traits 4 \nand phylogenetic structure across spatial scales (e.g., Silvertown et al. 2006, Swenson et al. 2007), 5 \ntemporal comparison in communities undergoing succession remains rare (but see Letcher 2009). Yet, 6 \nsuch comparisons can provide important insights into community assembly processes. Our analyses 7 \nillustrate the dynamic nature of community assembly processes through succession. It also calls attention 8 \nto the importance of coupling an understanding of demographic processes with analyses of phylogenetic 9 \nand functional community structure. 10 \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 12 \nWe thank the founders of the LFDP, E.M.

Phylogeny construction 1 \nLeaf tissue samples were field collected from tagged individuals within the LFDP by NGS and 2 \npreserved using silica gel. Approximately 50 mg of each sample of leaf material was placed 3 \nwithin a well of a 2-mL polypropylene 96-well matrix screen-mate plate (Matrix Technologies) 4 \nand transferred to the Laboratories of Analytical Biology at the Smithsonian Institution for DNA 5 \nextraction and sequencing. The community phylogeny for the LFDP was generated using a 6 \nmulti-locus barcode library of three markers (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA). Details of sequence 7 \nediting, alignment, and assembly are provided in Kress et al. (2009). Briefly, a data matrix was 8 \nconstructed for 144 species with sequences from three DNA barcode regions.  The matrix 9 \nincluded rbcLa sequences for 144 species (trees and shrubs found in the LFDP), matK for 100 10 \nspecies and trnH-psbA for 123 species. The trnH-psbA spacer was aligned such that only 11 \nmembers of the same family were compared with each other and when only one species per 12 \nfamily or per order was present, those sequences were not included in the sequence matrix (see 13 \nKress et al. 2009 for details on nested super-matrix design). The sequence matrix was then 14 \nanalyzed by parsimony implemented in PAUP (Swofford 2000); the one difference from Kress et 15 \nal. (2009) was the use of an ordinal constraint tree, which specified that all trees be congruent 16 \nwith APG III (2009) in their ordinal topology. The phylogenetic reconstruction was done in two 17 \nsteps: 1) a short search for each of 200 independent random addition phylogenetic trees with two 18 \ntrees saved at each random addition sequence, which was followed by 2) an exhaustive heuristic 19 \nsearch using the phylogenetic trees compiled from the 200 random additions resulting in 360,000 20 \nequally parsimonious trees. One of the 360,000 equally parsimonious trees was then selected for 21 \nuse in this study. The consensus tree produced from compilation of the 360,000 trees exhibited 22 \nvery strong topological support (Kress et al., In press) suggesting that the evolutionary 23 \nPage 33 \n \nhypothesis represented by the phylogeny closely approximates true historical relationships (Fig. 1 \n1). 2 \nReferences 3 \nSwofford , D.L. 2000.
