In-\ndeed, TMR devices such as these show a great deal of po-\ntential in the field of magnetic read heads found in hard disk\ndrives and magnetic random access memory.2\nMTJs are routinely fabricated with an Al2O3 barrier,\nthrough the plasma oxidation of an initially deposited Al\nlayer. The barrier properties play a key role in the magne-\ntotransport behavior3\u20135 and so, to date, much attention has\nbeen paid to the study of these properties and their evolution\nthroughout the fabrication process. The barriers are known to\ncontain defects, some natural6 and others of artificial\norigin.7,8 Factors such as the barrier roughness9 and chemical\nhomogeneity10 have been investigated as well as the specifics\nof barrier oxidation.11,12\nIt is important in the optimization of TMR to understand\nthe oxidation process and in particular how to oxidize the\nentire Al layer and none of the ferromagnet.13,14 We have\nmeasured the thickness of the insulating Al2O3 barriers, with\nvarying oxidation times, using grazing incidence x-ray tech-\nniques and compared results gained from fitting current\ndensity\u2013voltage (I \u2013 V) curves to an electron tunneling\nmodel. It has already been noted that the \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018characteristic\u2019\u2019 thickness found with this approach differs\ngreatly from more direct structural characteristic methods\nsuch as high-resolution electron microscopy.12,15 However,\ndue to the limiting field of view, it is difficult to accurately\ndetermine the averaged thickness and roughness over the\nsample. In this letter, we quantitatively compare the barrier\nthickness determined by structural and electrical methods.\nThe MTJs were deposited by dc sputtering of successive\nlayers of cobalt, aluminum, and permalloy (Ni81Fe19)\nthrough shadow masks onto a silicon ~100! substrate previ-\nously coated with rf sputtered aluminum oxide. The initial\nbase pressure was 131027 Torr and the sputtering was con-\nducted in an argon atmosphere of 5 mTorr.\nA Dektak profilometer was used to calibrate the Al depo-\nsition rate; a rate of 6.7(60.1)\u00c5\/s was established. A stan-\ndard Al layer thickness of 14 \u00c5 was used in all samples by\nexposing the sample to the Al source for 2.1 s via a timed\nshutter. Immediately after the Al layer was deposited, 100\nmTorr of oxygen was introduced into the chamber and the\nsample was exposed to a localized dc glow discharge for 1 to\n5 min ~an additional unoxidized control sample was also\nmade!. The chamber was then pumped out to regain base\npressure before the Ni81Fe19 layer was deposited. The nomi-\nnal uncalibrated structure for each sample was Si~100!\/250 \u00c5\nAl2O3\/90 \u00c5 Co\/14 \u00c5 Al barrier\/110 \u00c5 NiFe.\nA quartz crystal oscillator system continuously recorded\nthe deposition rate revealing that the Ni81Fe19 and Co layers\nin all samples were the same within 65%. The crystal moni-\ntors were insufficiently sensitive to determine the thickness\nand errors of the Al layers, but the reproducible results for\nthe Co and Ni81Fe19 gave confidence that the Al layers were\nthe same thickness within 65% for all the samples. The\nstandard deposited Al layer was 14(60.7)\u00c5.\nA four-point dc measurement technique was used to de-\ntermine both the magnetoresistance ~MR! response and the\nI \u2013 V characteristics. The height and width of the insulating\nbarrier was determined by fitting the I \u2013 V curve to a model\nbased on the work of Simmons16\u201318 as modified by\nHartman.19 The model uses the Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin\napproximation, which assumes a slowly varying potential\ncompared with the electron wavelength. The model takes\ninto account the trapezoidal barrier shape caused by the dif-\nfering work functions of the two metals, the effect of the\nimage charge potential and is extended for use at room tem-\nperature.\nGrazing incidence x-ray reflectivity ~GIXR! measure-\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nj.d.r.buchanan@durham.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 81, NUMBER 4 22 JULY 2002\n7510003-6951\/2002\/81(4)\/751\/3\/$19.00 \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

The true specular profile provided in-\nplane averaged structural information as a function of depth,\nsuch as layer thickness and interface width. This technique is\nideally suited to the characterization of Al2O3 barriers in\nMTJ due to the large difference in scattering factors between\nthe barrier and the surrounding ferromagnetic layers. How-\never, simulations of model reflectivity profiles show that this\ntechnique can not be used to distinguish between Al and\nAl2O3 in MTJs, and so it is impossible to determine directly\nthe degree of Al oxidation using GIXR.\nAn initial series of 21 MTJs with a nominal preoxidized\nAl thickness of 14 \u00c5 were grown in order to explore the\nrelationship between MR and oxidation time. The results are\nshown in Fig. 1; a peak in the MR coincides with a three min\noxidation period, indicating this to be the optimum oxida-\ntion. A smaller oxidation period leads to samples with lower\nMR, probably due to portions of the Al barrier being unoxi-\ndized, resulting in pinhole formation and the presence of\nother high conductivity regions. The lower MR with greater\noxidation times is explained through the partial oxidation of\nthe lower magnetic Co layer.\nThe barrier widths were determined through fits to the\nI \u2013 V data taken in a bias voltage range of 6700 mV as\nshown in the Fig. 2 inset ~bias destruction tests revealed a\nmean breakdown voltage of 1.1 V!. As a direct comparison,\nsamples oxidized for 1, 3, and 5 min have been characterized\nusing GIXR. An example of the specular reflectivity profile\nwith the corresponding fit to a model structure has been\nshown in Fig. 2. The specular data have been corrected for\nthe effect of forward diffuse scatter ~also shown! by subtrac-\ntion of the intensity measured in a similar u\/2u scan but with\nthe specimen offset by 20.1\u00b0 from the specular condition.\nData fitting having been performed using the BEDE MERCURY\ncode.20 This program uses a genetic algorithm to achieve a\nbest fit between the data and that simulated for a model\nstructure under the distorted wave born approximation. The\nstructural parameters used in modeling the fit in Fig. 2 can be\nseen in Table I.\nThe metallic layer thickness and roughness values were\nfound to be similar for all samples, demonstrating consis-\ntency and good control throughout the sputtering process.\nValues for the interface width between the Co and the Al2O3\nbarrier ~4.5 \u00c5! make an interesting comparison to the inter-\nface between the Al and the Co in the nonoxidized sample.\nThis sample, as well as others21,22 show a larger interface\nwidth of 861 \u00c5. This suggests the oxidation process results\nin the migration of the Al out of the Co layer. Both GIXR\nand I \u2013 V modeling show a monotonic increase in barrier\nwidth with oxidation time, see Fig. 3 and Table II.\nThe most dramatic observation noted from the GIXR\nresults is that the oxide barrier thickness is, in all cases,\nFIG. 1.

The result is not an artifact of\nthe GIXR modeling process as measurement of the Al layer\nthickness of the unoxidized control sample yielded a value of\n16.1(61)\u00c5, in excellent agreement with the Dektak profilo-\nmeter calibration. ~The sensitivity is such that changing the\nbarrier thickness by 5 \u00c5 results in a dramatically different\nreflectivity profile.!\nIncreased barrier width with oxidation has been reported\npreviously by other groups12,15 using physical characteriza-\ntion techniques, with the values obtained from the Simmons\nmodel being close to the nominal thickness expected from\nthe preoxidized Al thickness. However, Schuller et al.23,24\nhave shown that I \u2013 V modeling is unreliable for evaluation\nof the barrier quality.\nThe present results show definitively that the effective or\ncharacteristic thickness obtained from the tunneling model\ndoes not correspond to the average thickness determined\nfrom GIXR. The absence of Kiessig fringes in the longitudi-\nnal offspecular diffuse scatter in Fig. 2 shows that there is\nalmost zero conformality between the roughness of the top\nand bottom surfaces. The absence of fringes of the appropri-\nate period implies that the roughness is thus nonconformal\nacross the barrier layers. Transverse diffuse scans were taken\nwith soft x rays at 780 eV to determine the in-plane correla-\ntion length from the half width of the diffuse scatter. There is\nonly a small variation in correlation length; j5330620 \u00c5\nfor the unoxidized and 5 min oxidized sample, with the 1 and\n3 min oxidized samples indicating a lower correlation length\nof less than 300 \u00c5. This analysis thus indicates considerable\nlocal variation in the barrier thickness due to roughness, the\ndiscrepancy between effective (I \u2013 V) and average ~GIXR!\nbarrier thickness being explained by localized tunneling at\nareas in which the barrier thickness is near a minimum. If\nthis is the case, I \u2013 V modeling will always measure the lower\nthickness values for barriers compared to the average values\nobtained from GIXR.\nDa Costa et al.9 used an atomic force microscope\nequipped with a conducting tip to compare topographical\ninformation with current flow. Their results showed large lo-\ncal variations in the tunneling current which were attributed\nto small changes in barrier thickness and barrier potential,\nand so confirm that total conductance is dominated by con-\ntributions from localized sites.\nIn summary, we have found an oxidation time of 3 min\nproduces sputtered MTJs with the highest MR values. The\nbarrier thickness measured by fitting I \u2013 V curves to the Sim-\nmons electron-tunneling model and by GIXR has been ob-\nserved to increase monotonically as a function of oxidation\ntime. GIXR results yield an average thickness much greater\nthan that inferred from fitting the I \u2013 V data and show a lack\nof conformality in the roughness. We understand that the\ndiscrepancy in thickness measured by the two techniques is\nsupported by independent evidence.25 These data quantify\nearlier indications that tunneling is localized to specific re-\ngions across the barrier where the barrier thickness is at a\nminimum.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support\nfrom EPSRC, partially through the ~G&T!MR Network.
