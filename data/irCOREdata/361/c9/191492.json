Overall, the questionnaire is a valuable \ninstrument for community-based research on respiratory symptoms in one to two-year old children.  \n \n \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \nIn epidemiological surveys the prevalence of asthma and other wheezing disorders is usually \nassessed by questionnaires. Because objective tests are difficult to perform, especially in young \nchildren, and their sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of asthma are questionable,[1] the \ndesign of appropriate questionnaires is crucial. Basically, a new instrument needs to demonstrate \nrepeatability and validity. This paper focuses on test-retest repeatability, a measure of the \nconsistency of the performance of a questionnaire when used under similar circumstances.  \nStandard respiratory questionnaires for schoolchildren have shown good or satisfactory \nrepeatability,[2-6] but may not be appropriate for infants and preschool children, where symptoms \nmay differ due to developmental changes and rely exclusively on proxy reports. For instance, \nlimitation of speech with severe wheeze and exercise-induced symptoms cannot be assessed in \ninfants unable to talk and run. Moreover, different clinical phenotypes are thought to co-exist within \nthe large group of preschool children suffering from wheeze.[7-9] To distinguish these phenotypes, \nsymptoms must be assessed in detail. Therefore standard questionnaires developed for \nschoolchildren cannot be applied automatically for very young children. Few targeted questionnaires \nexist. Their repeatability has been tested in small numbers of children recruited in neonatal units or \noutpatient clinics [10] or excluding ethnic minority groups.[11] They are therefore not necessarily \ngeneralisable. \nWe developed a new postal questionnaire for use in a large population-based cohort study of \nrespiratory symptoms in preschool children in Leicestershire.[12-16] This paper describes the short-\nterm repeatability of this questionnaire when it was reapplied to parents of one-year old children after \na three-month interval.  \n 3\nMETHODS \nSetting and study population \nIn 1998, we used the Leicestershire Child Health Database, which includes the birth notification with \nmother\u2019s self-reported ethnic origin, religion, country of birth and language, to select a random \nsample of 3500 white (mother self-identified as British Isles or European) and 800 south Asian \n(mother self-identified as Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi) children aged 1 year (i.e. in their second \nyear of life at recruitment) with complete birth records. South Asians, the largest ethnic minority \ngroup, accounted for 14% of one-year old children resident in the county at that time.  \nQuestionnaire and mailings \nWe developed a short four-page questionnaire that could be posted to families with young children, \nfor self-administration by parents (questionnaire available at: \nhttp:\/\/adc.bmjjournals.com\/supplemental). It contained sections on upper and lower respiratory \nsymptoms and diagnoses, healthcare utilisation and treatments for wheeze, environmental exposures \nincluding indoor air pollutants, breastfeeding, pets, nursery care, number of siblings and other \nhousehold members, parental history of atopic diseases and ethnicity, language and social \nconditions. Some questions were derived from an earlier questionnaire used locally [11] or from the \nInternational Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC).[6] Others were newly developed. \nThe sources of the different questions are summarised in the online Table 1 (see: \nhttp:\/\/adc.bmjjournals.com\/supplemental). All questionnaires were printed in English, with an \naccompanying letter translated into the four main local south Asian languages offering translation \nservices. We sent this questionnaire to all 4300 families, with a reminder letter to non-responders six \nweeks later (first mailing in April, reminder in May, baseline survey). Within 3 months, 3194 (74%) \nquestionnaires had been returned. To a random sample of responders stratified by ethnic group (600 \nwhites and 200 south Asians) an identical questionnaire with an explanatory letter was then sent \nexactly three months later (in July, repeat survey).  \nData analyses \nStatistical analyses were performed with Stata, version 8.2 (Stata corporation, Austin, Texas). \nSymptom prevalence at baseline was calculated separately for participants and non-participants of \nthe repeat survey, and comparison between these groups was assessed by Chi square tests \n(dichotomous variables) and tests for trend (categorical variables). To assess repeatability, Cohen\u2019s \nkappa coefficients were calculated.[17] Kappa compares the observed agreement between two \nassessments made on two different occasions, with the agreement that would be expected simply by \nchance. Because the kappa coefficient is sensitive to the population prevalence of responses and \nalso to asymmetrical imbalance in marginal totals, we also present the percentage of observed total \nagreement (number of positive and negative answers to both questionnaires divided by the total), and \nthe separate proportions of positive and negative agreement (number of answers in positive \nagreement divided by the average number of positive answers; number of answers in negative \nagreement divided by the average number of negative answers). These values help in understanding \nindividual results.[18, 19] For ordinal and quantitative variables, agreement was assessed as \nIntraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). Landis and Koch [20] have suggested that kappa \ncoefficients \u22640.4 indicate poor agreement, values of 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 good \nagreement and >0.8 excellent agreement. To examine which factors might influence agreement, we \nstratified analyses by household language (English, other), ethnicity (white, south Asian), the \nTownsend local area deprivation score (low, medium, high), interval between baseline and repeat \nsurvey (<3 months, \u22653 months), domicile (urban, rural), and respondent (same respondent, different \nrespondent to repeat questionnaire, and mother vs. father). The equality of subgroup agreement \nmeasurements was tested using the methods of Donner et al.[21, 22] Missing values were coded as \n\u201cno\u201d because sensitivity analyses showed no difference in results. \nEthic committee approval \nThe Leicestershire Health Authority Research Ethics Committee approved the study. \n 4\nRESULTS \nResponse rates \nThe response rates were 74% (3194\/4300) in the baseline survey and 58% (460\/800) in the repeat \nsurvey, and higher for white (n=368\/600, 61%) than for south Asian children (n=92\/200, 46%, \np<0.001). Most baseline questionnaires were completed in April or May (n=2691\/3194, 84%), repeat \nquestionnaires were mostly completed in July and August (n=451\/460, 98%). Median (interquartile \nrange) age of the children was 17.7 (14.8-20.7) months at baseline survey and 20.5 (17.7-23.2) \nmonths at the repeat survey. For test-retest analyses we included the 413 children with the same \nrespondent (mother or father) in both occasions, as conventional.[2] However, results were very \nsimilar in a sensitivity analysis including all 460 questionnaires.  \nPrevalence of respiratory symptoms  \nThe 413 study participants who replied to the repeat questionnaire had a lower prevalence of \nwheeze, shortness of breath and cough in the baseline survey than the children who failed to respond \n(Table 1). Among 413 participants in the repeat survey, the overall prevalence of respiratory \nsymptoms was similar on the two occasions.  \n \nTable 1 - Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, in respondents and non-respondents to the \nrepeatability study. \n Non-respondents (n=340) Respondents (n=413) \n Baseline survey Baseline survey Repeat survey \n n % (95 CI) n % (95 CI) n % (95 CI) \np  \nWheeze           \nWheeze ever 138 40.6 (35.3-45.8) 116 28.1 (23.7-32.4) 120 29.1 (24.7-33.5) <0.001\nWheeze last 12 months 121 35.6 (30.5-40.7) 110 26.6 (22.3-30.9) 105 25.4 (21.2-29.6) 0.008 \nWheeze without colds 42 12.4 (8.8-15.9) 34 8.2 (5.6-10.9) 35 8.5 (5.8-11.2) 0.062 \nShortness of breath 73 21.5 (17.1-25.9) 57 13.8 (10.5-17.1) 60 14.5 (11.1-18.0) 0.006 \nCough           \nCough without colds 150 44.1 (38.8-49.4) 130 31.5 (27.0-36.0) 138 33.4 (28.8-38.0) <0.001\nCough at night 83 24.4 (19.8-29.0) 86 20.8 (16.9-24.8) 81 19.6 (15.8-23.5) 0.240 \nDiagnoses           \nDiagnosis of asthma 43 12.6 (9.1-16.2) 39 9.4 (6.6-12.3) 42 10.2 (7.2-13.1) 0.160 \nEczema last 12 months 122 35.9 (30.8-41.0) 148 35.8 (31.2-40.5) 153 37.1 (32.4-41.7) 0.989 \nEars, nose, throat           \nChronic rhinitis 103 30.3 (25.4-35.2) 124 30.0 (25.6-34.5) 105 25.4 (21.2-29.6) 0.936 \nSnoring 179 52.6 (47.3-58.0) 230 55.7 (50.9-60.5) 215 52.1 (47.2-56.9) 0.404 \nChronic otitis 146 42.9 (37.7-48.2) 157 38.0 (33.3-42.7) 160 38.7 (34.0-43.5) 0.170 \np: significance of difference in baseline symptom prevalence between respondents to the repeat survey and \nnon-respondents; for the respondents there were no significant differences in symptom prevalence between the \nbaseline and repeat surveys. \nRepeatability \nThe repeatability of the most important symptoms are shown in Table 2 (see also Online Tables 2 \nand 3 on ADC website: http:\/\/adc.bmjjournals.com\/supplemental which give detailed results for all \nsymptoms, family history and environmental exposures). In general, agreement was excellent (kappa \n>0.8) for family history of atopic diseases and environmental exposures (smoking, breastfeeding, \npets, cooking fuel). Questions on the frequency and severity of wheeze, asthma diagnosis, inhaler \ntreatment and healthcare utilisation had good repeatability (kappa 0.61 - 0.80). Repeatability was \nmoderate for questions on triggers of wheeze and cough (kappa 0.49 - 0.72). In contrast, agreement \nfor questions on chronic cough, upper respiratory symptoms and skin problems were (with the \nexception of a diagnosis of eczema) only moderate (kappa 0.39 - 0.68). Stratified analyses did not \nshow any significant differences in agreement between subgroups, with one exception: repeatability \nof several questions was poorer when both questionnaires had been completed by the fathers \n(N=39), compared to mothers (N=374). This was significant for questions on night cough (with a \nkappa of 0.10 vs. 0.44 for fathers and mothers respectively, p=0.003) and cough apart from colds \n(kappa 0.28 vs. 0.56, p=0.09), snoring (kappa 0.51 vs. 0.67, p=0.08), eczema (kappa 0.22 vs. 0.70, \n 5\np=0.003), paternal smoking (kappa 0.53 vs. 0.88, p=0.001), number of physician visits (ICC 0.55 vs. \n0.76, p=0.02), posseting (ICC 0.36 vs. 0.70, p=0.002) and duration of breastfeeding (ICC 0.85 vs. \n0.96, p<0.001).\n \nTable 2 - Agreement between answers to repeat questionnaires at 3-month intervals by parents of \n413 one-year olds.  \n ++ +- -+ -- PO Ppos Pneg \u03ba (95CI) \nWheeze          \nWheeze ever* 95 21 25 272 88.9 80.5 92.2 0.73 (0.65-0.80) \nWheeze last 12 months* 83 27 22 281 88.1 77.2 92.0 0.69 (0.61-0.77) \nWheeze without cold 25 9 10 369 95.4 72.5 97.5 0.70 (0.57-0.83) \nShortness of breath 39 18 21 335 90.6 66.7 94.5 0.61 (0.50-0.72) \nCough          \nCough without cold 92 38 46 237 79.7 68.7 84.9 0.54 (0.45-0.62) \nCough at night last 12 months* 43 43 38 289 80.4 51.5 87.7 0.39 (0.28-0.50) \nDiagnoses          \nDiagnosis of asthma 31 8 11 363 95.4 76.5 97.4 0.74 (0.63-0.85) \nEczema last 12 months* 120 28 33 232 85.2 79.7 88.4 0.68 (0.61-0.76) \nEars, nose and throat          \nChronic rhinitis* 66 58 39 250 76.5 57.6 83.8 0.42 (0.32-0.51) \nSnoring 176 54 39 144 77.5 79.1 75.6 0.55 (0.47-0.63) \nChronic otitis 125 32 35 221 83.8 78.9 86.8 0.66 (0.58-0.73) \nTreatment          \nInhaled bronchodilators 43 8 15 347 94.4 78.9 96.8 0.76 (0.66-0.85) \nInhaled corticosteroids 19 1 8 385 97.8 80.9 98.8 0.80 (0.67-0.93) \nFamily history          \nPaternal wheeze\/asthma 69 12 6 326 95.6 88.5 97.3 0.86 (0.79-0.92) \nMaternal wheeze\/asthma 61 13 9 330 94.7 84.7 96.8 0.82 (0.74-0.89) \nHousehold and environment          \nMaternal smoking  79 5 6 323 97.3 93.5 98.3 0.92 (0.87-0.97) \nOther smoking 79 5 16 313 94.9 88.3 96.8 0.85 (0.79-0.91) \nMaternal smoking during pregnancy 61 2 4 346 98.5 95.3 99.1 0.95 (0.90-0.99) \nCooking with gas 299 7 8 99 96.4 97.6 93.0 0.91 (0.86-0.95) \nCentral heating  388 2 8 15 97.6 98.7 75.0 0.74 (0.58-0.89) \nPets 169 7 7 230 96.6 96.0 97.0 0.93 (0.90-0.97) \nAttended nursery 95 20 20 278 90.3 82.6 93.3 0.76 (0.69-0.83) \nBreastfed 264 3 4 142 98.3 98.7 97.6 0.96 (0.94-0.99) \n++ positive on baseline and repeat questionnaires, +- positive on baseline questionnaire only, -+ positive on \nrepeat questionnaire only, -- negative on baseline and repeat questionnaires. \nPO proportion of observed total agreement; Ppos proportion of observed positive agreement; Pneg proportion of \nobserved negative agreement; \u03ba kappa; 95CI 95% confidence interval of kappa. \nLevel of agreement indicated by kappa: \u22640.4 poor, 0.41-0.60 moderate, 0.61-0.80 good, >0.8 excellent. \n* Questions from ISAAC core questionnaire [6] \n 6\nDISCUSSION \nThis paper presents the repeatability of a short respiratory questionnaire designed for self-completion \nby parents of one-year old children. Repeatability was excellent for sections on family history and \nenvironmental exposures, good for questions on wheeze, asthma, treatment and healthcare \nutilisation over the past 12 months, and moderate for upper respiratory symptoms and cough.  \nOne strength of our study compared to most others is the relatively large sample size, providing \nincreased precision (reasonable confidence intervals around kappa coefficients). We had a well \ndefined population-based study group, including British south Asians, the main local ethnic minority \ngroup in a proportion similar to that of the general population (14%). The only other published \nrepeatability studies for preschool questionnaires of which we are aware included few and\/or selected \nchildren: 72 hospital-based children [10] and <100 (exact number not quoted) children of white \nethnicity.[11] The response rate in the repeat survey (58%) compares well with response rates of 47-\n50% in other repeatability studies (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Published studies on repeatability (\u03ba) of a self-reported questionnaire in preschool and \nschoolchildren. \nAuthors Strippoli Powell[10] Luyt[11] Haby[24] Brunekreef[2] Clifford[5] Salome[4] \nN (response rate) 413 (58%) 114 (47%) 100?

No detailed informations about the response rate. \n \nAs in other surveys,[2] respondents in the repeatability study were less symptomatic than non-\nrespondents. Kappa depends on the marginal observed prevalence.[18] With a fixed agreement rate, \nkappa is maximal for a prevalence of 0.5 and decreases if the prevalence approaches 0 or 1.[23] In \nour study, the prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months in the participants of the repeatability study \nwas 25%, with a resulting kappa of 0.69 and an agreement rate (Po) of 88%. For a prevalence of \n35%, as in the total study population, kappa would have been 0.74 (assuming the same agreement \nrate). Thus we may have underestimated kappa values. On the other hand, respondents may be \nmore reliable than non-respondents, leading to an overestimation of kappa. Overall, the resulting bias \nis likely to be small. Other characteristics of the study, such as the age of the children, time period \nover which the questionnaire extends, respondent to the questionnaire and the interval between \nrepeat surveys will have a bigger impact on kappa values.[23] These differences in methodology \nhave to be taken into account when comparing different studies (Table 3). For instance short \nintervals between the two measurements [4, 10, 24] give the parents less time to forget previous \nanswers and the children less opportunity to change their true symptom status. Also, we need to be \ncautious when extrapolating our results from one-year old children to older toddlers. For instance, \nrepeatability of the question on duration of breastfeeding is likely to be poorer if the question is asked \nat an older age.  \nIt is reassuring that repeatability did not differ much between subgroups defined by language, \nethnicity or social class, although power for these comparisons was limited. Where fathers \nresponded, significantly lower repeatability was found for questions on current symptoms and infant \ncare confirming clinical observations. In most families, mothers spend more time at home with young \nchildren than fathers and are more likely to take time off work when the children are ill. Therefore, \nmothers usually provide more accurate reports on children\u2019s health status. The relatively poor \nrepeatability we found for the questionnaires completed by fathers might, however, not have a large \nimpact for the interpretation of questionnaire surveys, because most questionnaires are usually \ncompleted by mothers.  \n 7\nAlthough the absence of objective measurements of atopy and environmental exposures such as \nparental smoking in epidemiological studies is often criticised, the high repeatability of parental \nanswers gives confidence in these questionnaires. When interpreting the results for symptoms over \nthe past 12 months, it has to be kept in mind that perfect repeatability can never be obtained because \nthe time windows do not completely overlap. We sent the second questionnaire 3 months after the \nfirst one, so that some of the children will have developed new symptoms and others remitted.  \nThis is not the only cause for imperfect agreement, as shown for the symptom \u2018wheeze ever\u2019 which, \nillogically, was reported in the first but not the repeat questionnaire by about 5% of parents (as also in \n[2]) (Table 2). Poorer repeatability for cough and upper respiratory symptoms compared to wheeze \nhas also been noted in other studies. It may be partly explained by high short-term variability in these \nsymptoms, making it likely that symptoms are reported if they have occurred recently, but not if the \nlast episode happened many months previously. As all questionnaires were sent at the same time of \nthe year, we could not compare repeatability between different seasons of the year. In contrast, \nwheeze, shortness and breath and inhaler use might be recalled more consistently because parents \nare more concerned. For skin problems, repeatability was significantly better for the question on \ndiagnosis (\u2018eczema\u2019) than for ISAAC questions on symptoms (\u2018itchy rash\u2019) (Table 2 and Online Table \n2). \nFinally, we want to stress that having shown a good repeatability does not allow to conclude that our \nquestionnaire has also a good validity. While repeatability refers to the reproducibility of a \nmeasurement, validity refers to whether the questionnaire measures what it intends to measure. The \nbest way to assess validity is to compare answers to the questionnaire with objective measurements. \nThese might include repeated respiratory sound recordings to validate reports of wheeze and cough, \ncomparison with hospitalisation or GP records to validate health care utilisation and inhaler use, or \nmeasurement of urinary cotinine to validate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We did not \nhave the possibility to do this. \nIn conclusion, this short postal respiratory questionnaire developed for cross-sectional and \nlongitudinal studies of preschool wheeze and other respiratory symptoms has a repeatability, in one-\nyear old children, similar to standard respiratory questionnaires for older children, and could therefore \nbe recommended for further use in community-based studies in this age-group.  \n 8\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe thank the parents of Leicestershire children for completing the questionnaires, and Tony Davis, \nBusiness Manager, Children\u2019s Directorate, Leicester City West Primary Care Trust, for his assistance.  \n \nCOMPETING INTERESTS \nThere are no competing interests. \n \nFUNDING \nThe work presented in this paper was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (PROSPER \ngrant 3233-069348 and 3200-069349, and SNF grant 823B - 046481) and the UK Department of \nHealth (grant # 0020014).
