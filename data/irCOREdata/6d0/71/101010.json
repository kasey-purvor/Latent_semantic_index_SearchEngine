INTRODUCTION\nThe structure of nuclei in the Yb-Hf-W-Os (Z570\u201376)\nregion is characterized by the presence of high-angular-\nmomentum intrinsic, i.e., noncollective states. Such states\nare favored over collective excitations because the proton\nand neutron Fermi levels are among quasiparticle orbitals\nwith large angular-momentum projections (V) on the sym-\nmetry axis, allowing states with large values of K5SV to be\nformed. These states may be long lived, with half-lives rang-\ning from a few nanoseconds to several years, one of the most\nfamous being the Kp5161, 31 yr isomer in 178Hf @1#.\nThere are several predictions concerning high-K isomers\nin the A\u2019180 region @2\u20135#, and some of these isomers are\npossibly very long lived. In 178W Jain et al. @3# predicted\namong others a low-lying eight-quasiparticle isomer with\nKp5301 which may decay to members of the Kp5231 or\nKp5251 rotational bands. Due to a possible high multipo-\nlarity of its decay radiation, this state might be very long\nlived @6#. In 180Ta several isomers in the spin region of\n20\u201328 are predicted, although the highest spin identified\nmultiquasiparticle state has a spin parity of 19(2) @4,7#. A\n222 six-quasiparticle state may be expected to decay via an\nM3 transition to a 192 state, resulting in a possible very\nlong-lived isomer @4#. The situation is very similar in 177Ta.\nThe highest spin known multiquasiparticle state has spin par-\nity of 49\/22 @8,9#. Among the predicted higher spin isomeric\nstates @8# there is one with a spin-parity of 67\/22, which may\nbe expected to decay by an E3 transition of ;0.5 MeV,\nleading to a long lifetime. However, it is extremely difficult\nto predict lifetimes accurately, since they strongly depend on\nthe deexcitation multipolarities, K-value changes and ener-\ngies, and therefore on the fine details of the level schemes.\nThe goal of the present work is to search for high-spin\nisomers with half-lives longer than 1 h in the W-Ta-Hf nu-\nclei. Since high angular momenta are needed the nuclei\nshould ideally be populated in heavy-ion fusion-evaporation\nreactions, but to gain access to the most favored nuclei, such0556-2813\/2000\/62~3!\/034303~10!\/$15.00 62 0343as those considered above, neutron-rich targets and beams\nare needed. One suitable combination of stable beams and\ntargets is 20\n48Ca and each of the xenon isotopes: 54\n134Xe and\n54\n136Xe. In contrast to in-beam measurements, where rate limi-\ntations apply due to intense prompt radiations, increased sen-\nsitivity to long-lived isomers can be achieved by performing\nbombardments with high beam intensities followed by peri-\nods of off-line g-ray counting.\nThe background to the motivation for such a study is that\nthe discovery of new isomers may be used to test a number\nof nuclear structure phenomena such us configuration depen-\ndent pairing effects, Coriolis effects, shape coexistence, tri-\naxiality, etc. @5#. For example, it is well known that the\nnuclear pairing force is responsible for the reduction of the\nmoment of inertia well below that of a rigid body. In a\nK-isomeric state, the orbitals contributing to its configuration\nare blocked, therefore an increased moment of inertia is ex-\npected. The study of the several already identified high-K\nisomers confirms the increase of the moment of inertia, but\nalso suggest that its maximum value is \u201930% lower than\nthat of a rigid body @10\u201312#. This value is reached in some\n178W eight-quasiparticle states @6,11# but more experimental\ndata are needed.\nThis work is part of a wider research program to study\nhigh-K isomers, with a range of lifetimes in the A\u2019180 re-\ngion, using reactions with different population mechanisms,\ne.g., incomplete fusion @13#, deep-inelastic @14#, and frag-\nmentation @15# reactions.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS\nIsotopically enriched ~80%\u201390%! 48Ca-oxide targets of\nthickness .10 mg\/cm2 have been bombarded with \u201910\nparticle-nA beams of 134Xe and 136Xe. The beams were de-\nlivered by the 88-In. Cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory. The incident beam energy was 535\nMeV in the case of 134Xe, and 535 MeV and 550 MeV in the\ncase of 136Xe. The target consisted of 48Ca oxide pressed\ninto a tantalum mesh. The use of this chemical compound is\u00a92000 The American Physical Society03-1\nZs. PODOLYA\u00b4 K et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 62 034303justified by previous experience which showed that calcium\noxide can withstand intense beams. The Coulomb barrier is\nat a higher laboratory energy for oxygen than for 48Ca, so\nthat the reaction cross sections for xenon on oxygen are rela-\ntively small at the beam energies chosen. The irradiations\nwere performed in a separate high-intensity beam line to\navoid contamination of the measurement area.\nThe reaction conditions populate mainly 1772181W iso-\ntopes, after the evaporation from the compound nuclei of\n3\u20135 neutrons, while 1772181Ta and 1752178Hf isotopes are\nalso reached, with considerably lower cross sections, in pxn\nand axn channels, respectively. After irradiation, the target\nwas mounted in the center of the 8p g-ray detector array\n@16# consisting of 20 Compton-suppressed germanium detec-\ntors and a 70-element bismuth-germanate calorimeter.\nEvents were written to tape when at least one Compton-\nsuppressed Ge detector and one BGO detector fired in coin-\ncidence ~which improves the discrimination against back-\nground!. Another measurement setup was also utilized,\nwhere spectra were taken with one well-shielded unsup-\npressed Ge detector in a low-background environment. In\naddition, for reference purposes an in-beam measurement of\n3 h was also performed using a 535-MeV 134Xe beam, with\nthe 48Ca-oxide target in the center of the 8p detector array.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS\nThere are only few examples of K isomers decaying\nthrough b decay in the A\u2019180 region @17#, and all of them\nhave spin less than 12. In the quantitative analysis of the\nnuclei studied in the present work we assume that any new\nisomer populated would decay through g-ray transitions.\nEven if the first step of a high-K isomer\u2019s decay were by b\nemission, this would be followed by g-ray emission. We\nhave found no evidence for new b-decaying isomers and in\nthis work it is the g-ray emission that we quantify.\nThe number of counts from a g-ray transition deexciting\n~directly or indirectly! an isomeric level populated in a beam\nirradiation is described by\nAg5t~12e2T irrad \/t!~e2t1 \/t2e2t2 \/t!\nsNtIe f exBR\n~11a! , ~1!\nwhere t is the mean life of the isomer; T irrad is the irradiation\ntime; t1 is the time between the end of the irradiation and\nstart of the measurement; t2 is the time between the end of\nthe irradiation and end of the measurement; a is the electron\nconversion coefficient; BR is the branching ratio of the tran-\nsition; e is the g-ray efficiency; I is the beam intensity; s is\nthe total production cross section of the nucleus; Nt is the\nnumber of target nuclei per unit area; and f ex is the cross\nsection of the isomer compared with the total cross section of\nthe nucleus, multiplied with the percentage of the isomer\ndeexcitation passing through the level decaying by the tran-\nsition under analysis. In the case where a g-ray transition\ndirectly deexcites an isomer, f ex is simply the fraction of the\nproduction cross section of the isomeric state compared to\nthe total. ~All the quantities listed in the equation have to be\ngiven in International System units.!03430Since there are large uncertainties in Nt , s , I, and abso-\nlute e , it is better to compare g-ray line intensities to refer-\nence transitions deexciting b-unstable nuclei or known iso-\nmers for which production is specific to the target ~and not to\nthe beam!. The function F(t) is defined as\nF~t!5t~12e2T irrad \/t!~e2t1 \/t2e2t2 \/t! ~2!\nand it gives the sensitivity of the measurement as a function\nof the mean life of the isomeric decay. In the case when the\ng-ray transition which deexcites an isomer is not observed,\nthen one can say Ag,NA2\u0095background, where\nA2\u0095background is the standard deviation of the area for an\nunobserved peak and N is the number of standard deviations.\nLimits for the lifetime can be deduced using the formula\nderived from Eqs. ~1! and ~2!\nF~t!,\nNA2\u0095background~11a!\ne f exBR S e f exBRAg~11a! D ref\ns ref\ns\nF~t!ref .\n~3!\nThe strongest b decays observed were from nuclei popu-\nlated in the particle-transfer channels. Consequently, the\ng-ray spectra are dominated, in addition to the W-Ta-Hf de-\ncay transitions, by the transitions following the b decay of\nthe nuclei close in N and Z to 134,136Xe and 48Ca. The 489\nand 808 keV g-ray transitions that follow the b decay of\n47Ca, T1\/254.536 d @17# were chosen as reference lines.\nThe intensities of these transitions are related to the quantity\nof 48Ca in the target. The 47Ca is produced from 48Ca in\none-neutron knockout reactions and from the decay of 47K,\nthis latter produced from 48Ca by knocking out one proton.\nSince the half life of 47K, T1\/2517 s, is very short compared\nwith the time between the end of an irradiation and the start\nof a measurement, it can be considered that the chosen ref-\nerence g rays have the 4.5 d lifetime of 47Ca. The consis-\ntency of the results obtained was checked by using additional\nreference g-ray transitions, following the b decay of\n48Sc (T1\/2543.67 h), 177W (T1\/252.25 h) @17#, and\n177Hf (T1\/2551 min, K537\/2 isomer! @18#. It should be\nnoted that decays with g-ray multiplicity of one cannot be\nused from the data collected with the 8p spectrometer, due\nto the coincidence requirement imposed.\nIV. RESULTS\nThe main characteristics of the measurements performed\nare listed in Table I. It should be noted that target 3 received\nthe highest beam intensity for the longest period. Compared\nwith target 2, however, we found that the reference lines are\nweaker, probably because target 3 was partially damaged by\nthe higher beam. Spectrum numbers 1 and 5 are shown in\nFig. 1.\nIn order to place limits on the lifetimes of the possible\nisomers, it is necessary to know the relative production cross\nsections of the nuclei @see Eq. ~3!#. These have been calcu-\nlated using two different programs: PACE @19# and CASCADE\n@20#. The differences in the results obtained with the two\ncodes can be large, and as previous experience also shows,3-2\nSEARCH FOR VERY LONG-LIVED ISOMERS IN THE . . .

Due to this, cross\nsections determined from the present experiment were used\nwhere possible, and where it was not possible, the assump-\ntions used will be discussed for the individual nuclei.\nBy determining the intensity of the g rays and using Eq.\n~1!, relative cross sections can be determined for some cases.\nFrom the in-beam measurement of the 48Ca1134Xe reaction\nat 535 MeV, the relative production cross sections obtained\nwere s(177W)rel545(13), s(178W)rel5100, and s(179W)rel\n539(5) for the tungsten isotopes. Analysis of the b and\nK-isomer decay spectra gave cross-section ratios of\ns(177W)\/s(178Ta)585(15), s(177W)\/s(48Sc)575(11),\ns(177W)\/s(47Ca147K)51.35(15) from the 134Xe irradiated\ntargets; and s(47Ca147K)\/s(177Hf,K537\/2)5130(16),\ns(47Ca147K)\/s(48Sc)562(7) from the 136Xe irradiated tar-\ngets. The yield of 178Ta refers to the population of the 72\nground state ~i.e., the population of the 11 isomer, close to\nthe ground state but at unknown energy, is not included! and\n177Hf refers to the population of the K537\/2, T1\/2551 m\nstate @18#. In all the other cases the ground-state population\nis the reference. The s(47Ca147K)\/s(48Sc) value is the03430same for both the 134Xe and 136Xe beams and for the two\nbeam energies (136Xe), at least within the quoted uncertain-\nties. The relative cross sections of other nuclei could not be\ndetermined from the off-beam experiment for different rea-\nsons: either the nucleus is stable, the lifetime is too short, the\ng-ray multiplicity is unity, or the nucleus is also produced in\nthe decay of other nuclei. The relative cross-section values\nused are listed in Table II. These values will be discussed in\nconjunction with the individual nuclei.\nThe observation of the known 51 m, K537\/2 isomer in\n177Hf @18# is of particular note. The 51 m half life is at the\nlower end of the range of sensitivity of the present search.\nWith its high-K value of 37\/2, and the requirement of an\na-particle evaporation for its formation, this isomer serves as\na sensitive test for the validity of the present measurements.\nIn Fig. 1 ~lower part! the g-ray transitions at 278, 295, 311,\nand 326 keV are clear evidence for its formation. It is also\nnotable that the 178Ta 72 ground state can only be popu-\nlated through the proton-evaporation channel ~and not from\nthe b decay of 178W) so that the intensity of its decay ~by the\n213 and 326 keV transitions seen in the upper part of Fig. 1!FIG. 1.

For this reason the presence of g-ray transi-\ntions from the decay of known isomers was also checked.\nTable III gives the limits of the deduced F(t) values and\nthe corresponding mean-life limits for transitions which were\nconsidered to be significant. The lack of a limit for certain\nspectra is due to contaminant lines. The low-energy transi-\ntions have the difficulty of low intensity because of high\nelectron conversion coefficients, and low detector efficiency\nin the measurements with the 8p spectrometer due to the use\nof absorbers.

In order to obtain reliable limits, we used\nN55 for the number of standard deviations. This high value\ncorresponds to the probability of .99% that there is no iso-\nmer with a lifetime within the excluded region, even in the\ncase of an unlikely error of 50% in the cross-section assump-\ntion.\nIf one were to take an isomer population different from\n1% ( f ex50.01) relative to a tungsten ground state ~or 10%\nfor tantalum and hafnium! the new F(t) limit would be cal-\nculated as F(t)5(F(t)) tab.3 \/(100* f ex) for tungsten, and\nF(t)5(F(t)) tab.3 \/(10* f ex) for tantalum and hafnium. The\ncorresponding mean-life limits can be obtained using Figs. 2\nand 3.\nIn the following sections we discuss the nuclei studied\nindividually, starting with those populated in the 134Xe in-\nduced reaction and following with the nuclei populated in the\n136Xe induced reaction. In some cases, the lower lifetime\nlimit is already excluded by in-beam measurements ~inde-\npendent of the present work! and it is the upper limits on\nlifetimes that are of principal interest.\nA. 178W\nThe nucleus 178W is the main product in the 134Xe\n148Ca reaction. The relative cross section has been deter-\nmined from the experiment. From Table III one can establish\nthat if an isomer had been populated with an intensity of 1%\nof the total population of the nucleus, and it decayed through\nthe 106 keV, 21\u219201 transition, its mean life would have to\nbe less than 1.3 h or more than 1200 h ~50 d!. If such an\nisomer had decayed into the yrast band at the 61 state or\nhigher, its mean life cannot be between 0.5 h and 350 d. If it\ndecays into other bands which depopulate through the 22\n\u219221 939-keV transition, the isomer mean life cannot be\nbetween 6 h and 200 d. Assuming a population of only 0.1%,\nthe mean life of an isomer which decays to the higher part of\nthe yrast band could not be between 2 h and 30 d. In contrast,\nconsidering such an isomer with a population of 10%, the\nmean life cannot be between 15 min and 97 yr.\nFIG. 3. F(t) as a function of the mean life for spectrum num-\nbers 5\u20139.

For 177W no isomer with a mean life between 3 h\nand 41 d can be present under our assumptions. The relative\ncross sections are from the experiment.\nC. 179W\nThe relative cross sections are from the experiment. No\nisomer with mean life between 6 h and 19 d can be in 179W.\nAs can be seen from Table III, the half-life limits are in the\nsame range for 177W, 178W, and 179W, since the cross sec-\ntions are similar.\nAccording to the calculations, 179W was also populated in\nthe 136Xe induced reaction with a similar cross section.\nHowever, since there is not an experimentally determined\ncross section for this case and the calculated values have\nlarge uncertainties, half-life limits have not been evaluated.\nD. 177Ta\nThe tantalum nuclei were populated after the evaporation\nof one proton ~and some neutrons!, so their cross sections are\nmuch lower than those leading to the tungsten nuclei. For\n177Ta experimental cross sections could not be obtained, so it\nwas assumed that s(177W)\/s(177Ta)5s(178W)\/s(178Ta).\nThis assumption seems to be reasonable, but since the ex-\ntracted lifetime limits are very sensitive to the cross sections,\nthe results obtained have to be treated with caution.\nIn the 177Ta nucleus, a low-lying K521\/2 isomer is\nknown @8# with a level energy of 1355 keV. In Table III only\nthe g-ray transitions depopulating this isomer are listed.\nHowever, lifetime limits for higher lying isomers cannot be\ngiven with the present assumptions. Considering a higher f ex\nvalue, i.e., stronger isomer population, useful results can\nnevertheless be obtained based on the listed F(t) limits. For\nexample, the mean life of an isomer in 177Ta populated at the\nlevel of f ex50.3, cannot be between 11 h and 16 d, otherwise\nit would have been detected.03430E. 178Ta\nThe production cross section was determined from the\nexperiment: s(178Ta)5s(178W)\/183(32), without taking\ninto account the population of the 11 isomer in 178Ta. Due\nto the fact that 178Ta is the tantalum nucleus with the highest\npopulation, the obtained lifetime limits cover a higher range\ncompared to the 177,179Ta isotopes.\nF. 179Ta\nThe 179Ta nucleus, like 179W, is populated in both 134Xe\nand 136Xe irradiations. According to the calculations, the\ncross sections are very close to each other in the two reac-\ntions. Since the results from the 134Xe beam are more reli-\nable, only these are given in Table III.\nThe case of the 179Ta isotope is very similar to that of\n177Ta. Only the transitions depopulating the low-lying\nK521\/2 isomer @21# at 1252 keV are listed in Table III. It\nwas assumed that s(179W)\/s(179Ta)5s(178W)\/s(178Ta).\nG. 175Hf\nAn a particle has to be emitted by the compound nucleus\nto lead to the hafnium isotopes. The emission probability of\nan a particle is usually somewhat higher than that of a pro-\nton. Hence, based on the cross-section calculations, an\na\/proton emission ratio of 2 was adopted. Since the cross\nsection of 177Hf ~K537\/2! was determined experimentally,\nthe above assumption can be checked and it was found to be\nreasonable ~see Sec. IV M!.\nIt has to be noted that some transitions from the lower\nlevel of the 175Hf nucleus are present in the spectra due to\nthe b decay of 175Ta (T1\/2510.5 h) probably produced as a\nconsequence of the presence of 44Ca and 46Ca isotopes in the\ntarget. For this reason the lowest lying 81 keV g-ray transi-\ntion is not listed in Table III.\nH. 176Hf\nThe same cross-section assumption was adopted as for the\n175Hf nucleus. The lowest lying 88 and 202 keV g rays are\nnot listed in Table III, since they can originate from the b\ndecay of 176Ta (T1\/258.1 h), produced in the reaction on\nthe 44Ca- and 46Ca-contaminating isotopes in the target.3-7\nZs. PODOLYA\u00b4 K et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 62 034303I. 180W\nThe 180W nucleus is the main product of the 136Xe\n148Ca reaction and according to the calculations its cross\nsection is similar to that of 178W in the 134Xe induced reac-\ntion. Based on these calculations it was assumed that\ns (180W) \/ s (47Ca) 136Xe-beam 5 s (178W) \/ s (47Ca) 134Xe-beam .\nThe lifetime limits determined are in the same range as the\nvalues obtained for the other tungsten isotopes.\nJ. 181W\nIt was assumed that the production cross section is equal\nto that of the production of 179W with the 134Xe beam. The\nobtained lifetime limits are in the same range as for all the\nother tungsten isotopes.\nK. 180Ta\nThe cross-section ratio of s(180Ta)\/s(47Ca) 136Xe-beam\n5s(178Ta)\/s(47Ca) 134Xe-beam was considered.\nL. 181Ta\nIt was assumed that s(181Ta)\/s(47Ca) 136Xe-beam\n5s(179Ta)\/s(47Ca) 134Xe-beam . The 152- and 136-keV transi-\ntions of 181Ta are present in the spectra which are sensitive\nto the long half-lives, due to the b decay of 181W which has\na half-life of 121 d.\nM. 177Hf\nAs stated in Sec. IV G we assumed, taking the mean value\nfrom the calculations, that the emission of an a particle is\ntwo times more probable than the emission of a proton. Since\nthe cross section of the K537\/2, T1\/2551 min state in 177Hf\nhas been determined relative to 47Ca147K, this forms a\ncheck regarding the cross-section assumptions. From the ex-\nperiment s(47Ca)\/(s(177Hf,K537\/2)\u2019130. According to\nour adopted assumptions, i.e., the population of the (HI,4n)\nchannel is similar for the two beams, and the ratio of the\na\/proton evaporation probability is 2, the ratio\ns(47Ca)\/(s(177Hf,K537\/2) should be 165 if the isomer\npopulation were 30% of the population of the whole nucleus.\nThe good agreement provides some support for the validity\nof the assumptions.\nAlthough several g-ray transitions have been checked for\nevidence of new isomers in 177Hf, only those populating the\n51 min isomer @13# are listed in the table. It is worth men-\ntioning that the spectra contain some low-lying 177Hf transi-\ntions, coming from the b decay of 177Ta.\nN. 178Hf\nIn the case of 178Hf, both the low-lying bands and that\nbuilt on the 31 yr isomer @32# have been checked. The re-\ncorded spectra contain some low-lying 178Hf transitions,\noriginating from the b decay of 178Ta.\nV. DISCUSSION\nIn our reactions, the nucleus 178W is one of the most\nstrongly populated, and it is of particular interest with regard03430to possible long-lived isomers. Predictions for new high-K\nstates near the yrast line have been made by Jain et al. @3#. In\na recent work by Purry et al. @6# many of the predicted iso-\nmeric levels were found, with half-lives up to 220 ns. How-\never, the experiment was not sensitive to very long-lived\nisomers, and indeed several of the predicted high-K isomers\nwere not found. These levels are predicted to have K526\u201330\nand the bandheads are thought to have excitation energies\nbetween 7 and 8 MeV. According to CASCADE calculations\nthe states with spin higher than 30 should take about 50% of\nthe total cross section. Since these isomers are predicted to\nbe close to the yrast line, they would be expected to be\npopulated in the present experiment. Assuming that only 1%\nof the intensity in this spin region passes through such iso-\nmeric levels: F(t)5(F(t)) tab.3 \/(10030.530.01), one can\nconclude that the mean life of these isomers, if they exist,\nmust be less than 0.7 h or more than 170 d. A recent in-beam\nmeasurement @11# has identified K529, 30, and 34 band-\nheads, all with lifetimes less than 1 ns.\nSimilar considerations could apply to the other tungsten\nisotopes. However, the nuclei populated after the evaporation\nof charged particles, namely the tantalum and hafnium nu-\nclei, have much smaller cross sections, and usually their val-\nues are not known accurately. For these reasons, half-life\nlimits usually can be obtained only if we assume f ex.0.1.\nIn 180Ta a long-lived Kp5222 isomer was predicted but\nnot observed @4#. A parallel work by Saitoh et al. @7# also\nmissed the identification of this state either because of the\nlow spin input of the 11B induced reaction or the long life-\ntime. However, in our heavy-ion induced reaction the cross\nsection for states with spin >22 is around 65% compared to\nthe total production cross section of the nucleus. Assuming\nthat 50% of the intensity in this spin region passes through\nthe predicted isomeric level: F(t)5(F(t)) tab.3 \/(1030.65\n30.5), one can conclude that the mean life of this isomer\nmust be less than 1.2 h or more than 11 d. We note that\nK522 and 24 isomers have since been discovered by Whel-\ndon et al. @33#, with microsecond half-lives.\nIn 177Ta a long-lived Kp567\/22 isomer is predicted @8#.\nThe calculations indicate a cross section of about 20% for\nthis spin. However, it is difficult to give an accurate estimate\nsince this high spin is relatively close to the highest spin\ninput. Using the calculated value we conclude that the mean\nlife of the predicted 67\/22 nine-quasiparticle state cannot be\nbetween 1 and 9 d. The identification of this state remains an\nexperimental challenge.\nThe lower limits of the lifetime are summarized in Table\nIV. In each case it was assumed that any new isomer formed\nwould decay through the already known isomeric states or\nthe upper part of the corresponding yrast band, and that the\nisomer population cross section compared with the total one\nof the nucleus is either 1%, 10%, or 30%.\nThe nonobservation of an isomer does not necessarily\nmean that the searched-for multiquasiparticle state is not iso-\nmeric. It indicates only that the respective multiquasiparticle\nstate does not have a lifetime in the range of the sensitivity\nof the experiment and\/or it was not populated with sufficient\ncross section.3-8\nSEARCH FOR VERY LONG-LIVED ISOMERS IN THE . . .
