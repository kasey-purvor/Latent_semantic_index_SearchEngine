INTRODUCTION\nNuclei have been traditionally described relative to the\nstandard benchmarks of nuclear structure: the harmonic\nvibrator [1], the symmetrically deformed rotor [2], and the\ndeformed \u03b3 -soft model [3]. \u201cNewer\u201d benchmarks of structure\nfor describing nuclei transitional between these structures\nhave recently been proposed [4,5] with particular focus on the\ncritical point of spherical to deformed transitions. The X(5)\ncritical point model [5] describes nuclei at the critical point of\nthe transition from spherical to axially symmetric deformed\nwithin the framework of the Bohr Hamiltonian. The nuclear\npotential is approximated as an infinite square well with respect\nto the \u03b2 degree of freedom and a harmonic oscillator with\nrespect to the \u03b3 degree of freedom. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 degrees of\nfreedom are decoupled and allow for parameter-free (except\nfor scale) analytic predictions for excitation energies and\nelectromagnetic transition strengths.\nEmpirical realizations of the X(5) critical point model were\nsubsequently identified, with a concentration of examples\nobserved in the N = 90 rare earth nuclei. Despite the\napproximations involved in the decoupling of the \u03b2 and\n\u03b3 degrees of freedom [6], the model works very well. In terms\nof both energies and electromagnetic transition strengths,\n150Nd [7], 152Sm [8], 154Gd [9], and 156Dy [10] have been\nshown to exhibit properties similar to the X(5) predictions.\nThe success of the X(5) model in describing the properties\nof these nuclei has led to tremendous interest in phase\ntransitional behavior. For example, since the development of\nX(5), numerous modifications (see, for example Refs. [11\u201313])\nhave been proposed and investigations into phase transitional\nbehavior in this mass region (see, for example Refs. [14,15])\nhave been performed.\nThe identification of additional nuclei exhibiting an X(5)-\nlike structure with N \u0001= 90 will test whether this concept\nof critical point nuclei is of wider scope or unique to the\nN = 90 isotones. Classification of a nucleus in terms of\nX(5) requires an extensive comparison of excitation energies\nand electromagnetic transition strengths. For example, 104Mo\nwas first interpreted in terms of an X(5) structure [16] based\non excitation energies and branching ratios. An ensuing\nmeasurement of yrast B(E2) values in 104Mo [17] found a\ndiscrepancy with the X(5) model. A similar inconsistency\nis observed in the nuclei 162Yb (N = 92) and 166Hf (N =\n94). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the yrast energies [18,19] of\nboth of these nuclei are very close to the X(5) predictions.\nRecent experiments [20,21] on these nuclei have established\nthat the low-spin, non-yrast states also resemble the X(5)\npredictions. However, an interpretation in terms of the X(5)\nmodel becomes difficult, if not fails, when considering the\npreviously known electromagnetic transition probabilities of\nthe yrast sequence, as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). In 162Yb,\ntwo separate experiments [22,23] give lifetimes which show\nsome discrepancies, particularly for the 6+1 level. In both\nmeasurements, the yrast B(E2) values lie either close to or\nbelow the rotor predictions for spin 6+1 and higher. In 166Hf,\nlifetimes were measured in a single experiment [24], and an\nX(5) structure cannot be excluded, but the error bars are far\ntoo large to allow for a useful comparison.\nThe purpose of this work is to report on the new\nmeasurement of yrast level lifetimes in 162Yb and 166Hf.\nPrevious measurements [22\u201324] of yrast level lifetimes in these\nnuclei were determined using the recoil distance Doppler shift\n(RDDS) method in singles mode. The present work makes\nuse of the RDDS method in coincidence mode, eliminating\nproblems caused by both unobserved and observed level\nsidefeeding. Furthermore, application of the differential decay\ncurve method (DDCM) in the analysis allows for the detection\nof systematic errors, resulting in an improved measurement\nof level lifetimes. Besides the measurement of the lifetimes\nthemselves, a key aspect of this study is the significant\nreduction (often a factor of 3 or more) in the uncertainties. This\nis crucial to providing an adequate test of X(5).

The X(5), rotor, and vibrator predictions are\nincluded for comparison.\npredictions differ by 20%\u201330%, which is comparable to the\nuncertainties in the existing measurements. These lifetime\nmeasurements will provide a more stringent test of descriptions\nof these nuclei.\nII. EXPERIMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS\nLifetimes of excited states in 162Yb and 166Hf were\nmeasured using the RDDS method in coincidence mode. States\nin 162Yb were populated via the 116Cd(50Ti, 4n) reaction\nand states in 166Hf were populated via the 122Sn(48Ti, 4n)\nreaction. Each experiment was performed with a 200 MeV\nTi beam delivered by the ESTU tandem accelerator at the\nWright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University. The\n162Yb experiment was performed with a \u223c0.3 pnA 50Ti beam,\nwhile the 166Hf experiment used a 1\u20132 pnA 48Ti beam. Both\nexperiments used a 1.0 mg\/cm2 self-supporting target foil, and\nrecoiling nuclei were stopped in a 10 mg\/cm2 thick Au foil.\nThe target and stopper foil were mounted in the new Yale\nplunger device (NYPD) [25], which is based on the design of\nthe Cologne plunger [26].\nThe recoiling nuclei exited the target with a mean velocity\nof v = 0.022(1) c for 166Hf and v = 0.020(1) c for 162Yb.\nData were collected for 15 target-to-stopper distances ranging\nfrom 5 to 500 \u00b5m for 4 to 12 h each, with the longer runs\ncorresponding to the shorter distances in order to be sensitive\nto shorter lifetimes. In order to correct for thermal drifts in\nthe foils resulting from beam heating, the plunger system\nuses an automatic feedback system. The capacitance between\nthe target and stopper foils was continuously monitored and\ncorrections for any fluctuations were made. The accuracy of\nthe measurement of the relative target-to-stopper distances\nwas better than 0.2 \u00b5m in the range from electrical contact\nto 20 \u00b5m and \u223c2% of the target-to-stopper separation in the\nrange 20\u2013200 \u00b5m.\n\u03b3 rays were detected with the SPEEDY array [27], con-\nsisting of eight Compton-suppressed HPGe clover detectors.\nThe detectors were evenly distributed between two rings at\nangles of 41.5\u25e6 and 138.5\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis.\nFor each target-to-stopper distance, data were sorted into four\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 matrices corresponding to all combinations of the two\nrings. Spectra for different target-to-stopper distances were\nnormalized by setting gates on the shifted and unshifted\npeaks of the 4+1 \u2192 2+1 and 6+1 \u2192 4+1 \u03b3 -ray transitions and\nrequiring that the sum of the shifted and unshifted components\nof higher lying \u03b3 -ray transitions remained constant for all\ndistances. The sum of the total number of events in each\ncoincidence matrix was used as a consistency check of the\nnormalization procedure. The quality of the gated spectra for\neach experiment is illustrated in Fig. 2. Gates are placed on\nthe shifted component of the 6+1 \u2192 4+1 transitions in 162Yb\nand 166Hf and show the decay of the 4+1 state at three different\ntarget-to-stopper distances.\nLevel lifetimes were determined with the differential decay\ncurve method (DDCM) [28,29] applied in coincidence mode.\nA gate was placed on the shifted component of a feeding\n\u03b3 -ray transition, and the intensities of the Doppler shifted\nand unshifted components of the \u03b3 -ray transition depopulating\nthe level of interest were measured for each target-to-stopper\ndistance. By placing a gate on feeding transitions, a particular\ndecay path was selected and any contributions from known\nor unknown sidefeedings were eliminated. For a level of\ninterest populated directly (indirectly) by transition B (C) and\ndepopulated by transition A, the lifetime \u03c4 (x) was obtained\nby [28,29]\n\u03c4 (x) = I\nCA\nsu (x) \u2212 \u03b1ICBsu (x)\nv d\ndx\nICAss (x)\n(1)\nwhere v is the recoil velocity, x is the target-to-stopper distance,\nand the factor \u03b1 is given by\n\u03b1 = I\nCA\nsu (x) + ICAss (x)\nICBsu (x) + ICBss (x)\n.

Sample \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence spectra for 162Yb and 166Hf. Gates are placed on the 6+1 \u2192 4+1 transition in each nucleus showing the\nshifted and unshifted components of the 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition at three different target-to-stopper distances. Spectra are from the detectors at\nbackward angles (138.5\u25e6).\nThe intensities ICAss , ICAsu are the number of coincidences\nbetween the shifted (s) component of an indirect feeding\ntransition C and the shifted (s) or unshifted (u) component\nof the depopulating transition A of the level of interest,\nrespectively. The numerator is calculated directly for each\ntarget-to-stopper distance. The denominator is determined\nby fitting piecewise continuously differentiable second-order\npolynomials to the measured intensities of ICAss . When gates\nare set on a directly populating \u03b3 -ray transition B, Eq. (1)\nreduces to\n\u03c4 (x) = I\nBA\nsu (x)\nv d\ndx\nIBAss (x)\n. (3)\nIn the ideal case, the calculated values of \u03c4 (x) for each\ndistance are the same. The ability to obtain several independent\nlifetime values for a given level provides a consistency check\nof the results and allows for the identification of systematic\nerrors in the measurement or analysis. A detailed description\nof this method is given in Refs. [28,29].\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn the present work, the lifetimes of excited states in 166Hf\nand 162Yb were obtained. When possible, independent lifetime\nvalues were obtained for each angular grouping of detectors.\nThe following discussion concentrates on the analysis of the\n4+1 , 6\n+\n1 , and 8\n+\n1 levels in 166Hf and 162Yb. For reference, Fig. 3\ngives partial level schemes for 166Hf and 162Yb relevant to the\ndiscussion. Selected results from the analysis are illustrated\nin Figs. 4\u20137. Additional lifetimes for a few higher lying\nstates in both 166Hf and 162Yb were also measured. The\ncomplete results of the DDCM analysis are summarized in\nTable I.\nA. 166Hf\nThe 4+1 level is populated by a 426.6 keV transition and\ndepopulated by a 311.8 keV transition.

The range of\ndistances used for evaluating the mean \u03c4 is limited to the\nsensitive region of the measurement, where the numerator\nand denominator of Eq. (3) are not close to zero. The\nlifetime curves obtained for both forward and backward angles\n(Fig. 4), show consistent agreement. The present lifetime value\nof 23.5(9) ps is consistent within error with the previous\nmeasurement [24] of 24.2(14) ps.\nIn evaluating the lifetime of the 6+1 level, a direct gate on\nthe 509.5 keV feeding transition was not possible, because the\n510 keV transition is coincident with the 418 keV, 11\u22121 \u2192 9\u22121\ntransition, contaminating the shifted 427 keV peak at backward\nangles and the unshifted 427 keV peak at forward angles.\nTherefore, it was necessary to gate on other transitions in the\nband, noncoincident with the 418 keV transition. The analysis\ngiven in Fig. 5 (left) is a result of gating indirectly on the\n565.5 keV, 10+1 \u2192 8+1 transition and applying Eq. (1). The\nresulting lifetime of 4.6(3) ps is consistent within error with\nthe previous measurement [24] and provides a factor of 2\nreduction in the uncertainty.\nThe lifetime of the 8+1 level was obtained through a direct\ngate on the 565.5 keV, 10+1 \u2192 8+1 transition. Statistics in the\nbackward gated spectra were limited because of the presence of\nthe strong 560 keV, 18+1 \u2192 16+1 transition which restricted the\nwidth of the gate on the populating transition. Figure 5 (right)\nillustrates the \u03c4 curve obtained by gating on forward-shifted\ncomponents of the feeding transition. The resulting lifetime\nof 1.50 (15) ps is consistent within error with the previous\nmeasurement [24] and provides nearly a factor of 5 reduction\nin the uncertainty.\n034303-5\nE. A.

(3)].\nB. 162Yb\nThe 4+1 state is populated by a 436.7 keV transition\nand depopulated by a 320.6 keV transition. Difficulties in\ndetermining this lifetime arise from the presence of two\nstrong contaminant lines: a 439.1 keV, 10+2 \u2192 8+2 transition\nand a 320.6 keV, 14+1 \u2192 12+2 transition. The former makes\na direct gate on the feeding transition difficult, while the\nlatter contaminates the shifted and unshifted components\nof the depopulating transition. It was found that a clean\ngate could be obtained by placing an indirect gate on the\n578 keV, 10+1 \u2192 8+1 transition. The result of the \u03c4 analysis\nis given in Fig. 6 (left). The lifetime obtained (\u03c4 = 20.5(9)\nps) is consistent within error with the previous two mea-\nsurements [22,23] and gives a factor of 3 reduction in the\nuncertainty.\nThe 6+1 state is populated by a 521.3 keV transition and\ndepopulated by a 436.7 keV transition. A direct gate on\nthe 521 keV transition yields a lifetime of 5.1 (4) ps, as\nshown in Fig. 7 (left). Gates were only placed on forward-\nshifted components since the backward-shifted ones were\ncontaminated by the 511 keV annihilation line. The direct\ngate on the 8+1 \u2192 6+1 transition is weakly coincident with\nthe 439.1 keV, 10+2 \u2192 8+2 transition. To confirm that this\ndoes not affect the resulting lifetime, an indirect gate on\nthe 578.4 keV, 10+1 \u2192 8+1 transition was also performed. The\nresult of the \u03c4 analysis is given in Fig. 7 (right). Both the\ndirect gate and the indirect gate yield a consistent lifetime of\n5.0(3) ps. The present result favors the lower of the previous\ntwo measurements [23] and gives a factor of 3 reduction in the\nuncertainty [Table I].\nThe lifetime of the 8+1 level was obtained through a direct\ngate on the 578 keV, 10+1 \u2192 8+1 transition. The presence of\na strong 570 keV, 18+1 \u2192 16+1 transition prevented placing a\ngate on the backward-shifted component of the direct feeding\ntransition. Figure 6 (right) gives the \u03c4 curve obtained by gating\non the forward-shifted components of the feeding transition.\nThe resulting lifetime of 1.2(3) ps is less than the previous\nmeasurements, yet it still agrees within error with the result\nof Ref.

B(E2) values derived in the present\nwork for 162Yb (a) and 166Hf (b), normalized\nto the experimental B(E2; 2+1 \u2192 0+1 ) value in\neach nucleus. The X(5), IBA, rotor, and vibrator\npredictions are included for comparison.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe nuclei 162Yb and 166Hf lie close to a region where\nX(5)-like structures have been well established. Investigating\nthe extent of X(5) behavior in rare-earth nuclei should lead to\na better understanding of critical point nuclei. In this section,\nthe new lifetime measurements obtained in this work are used\nto compare the revised decay properties of yrast states in 162Yb\nand 166Hf to the X(5) predictions [5] as well as the predictions\nof the interacting boson approximation (IBA) model [30].\nThe nuclei 162Yb and 166Hf exhibit energy spectra very\nsimilar to the predictions of the X(5) critical point model. An\nextensive comparison of the energy spectrum of 162Yb and\n166Hf with X(5) was shown previously [20,21]. To summarize,\nthe key energy predictions of X(5) involve the ratios R4\/2 \u2261\nE(4+1 )\/E(2+1 ) = 2.90 and R0\/2 \u2261 E(0+2 )\/E(2+1 ) = 5.67. Sim-\nilar ratios are observed experimentally in 162Yb and 166Hf\nwith R4\/2 = 2.93, 2.97 and R0\/2 = 6.0, 6.7, respectively.\nAs mentioned previously, however, electromagnetic transition\nprobabilities provide a more rigorous test of the structure of a\nnucleus and its interpretation in terms of X(5) character.\nThe new lifetime measurements of yrast levels in 162Yb\nand 166Hf, particularly the resulting large reduction in un-\ncertainties, provides much improved information on yrast\nB(E2) strengths in these nuclei. From the newly measured\nlifetimes, the resulting B(E2) values for the transitions were\ndetermined. Conversion coefficients used in the calculation of\nB(E2) strengths were taken from Refs. [18,19]. All results are\nsummarized in Table. I. The yrast electromagnetic transition\nprobabilities obtained in this work are also shown in Fig. 8,\nalong with the predictions of X(5), the vibrator, and the\nsymmetric rotor. In Fig. 8, all values are normalized to\nthe experimental B(E2; 2+1 \u2192 0+1 ) value. Note that with this\nnormalization, the X(5) predictions involve no free parameters.\nIn 162Yb, the experimental B(E2; 4+1 \u2192 2+1 ) value agrees\nvery well with the X(5) prediction. However, the experimental\nB(E2; 6+1 \u2192 4+1 ) value shows little agreement with the X(5)\nmodel. It lies significantly below the X(5) predictions and\neven below the rotor predictions. It is interesting to note\nthat similar behavior in the 6+1 \u2192 4+1 transition is observed\nin the X(5) candidate nucleus, 156Dy [31]. Continuing higher\nin spin, the experimental B(E2; 8+1 \u2192 6+1 ) value is again in\ngood agreement with the X(5) prediction.\nIn 166Hf, the experimental B(E2; 4+1 \u2192 2+1 ) value shows\ngood agreement with the X(5) prediction. The experimental\nB(E2; 6+1 \u2192 4+1 ) value lies intermediate between the X(5)\nand rotor values, just outside of the X(5) prediction when\nconsidering the error. A similar dip in the B(E2; 6+1 \u2192 4+1 )\nvalue is observed in the N = 90 isotones of Nd, Sm, and\nGd. Similar to the result of 162Yb, the experimental B(E2;\n8+1 \u2192 6+1 ) value is in good agreement with the X(5) prediction.\nThese comparisons are possible because of the reduction in\nuncertainty in the lifetimes obtained in the present work.\nSince the X(5) model is a parameter-free prediction utilizing\nan approximate nuclear potential, it is not surprising that\nperfect agreement with the experimental data is not obtained.\nImproved agreement should be possible with a more flexible\ntheoretical model. In the framework of the interacting boson\napproximation model, fits to the Yb and Hf isotopic chains\nwere performed in Ref. [32] using the extended consistent\nQ Hamiltonian [33] involving two free parameters. From the\nparameters obtained in those fits, the predictions of the IBA for\nthe yrast B(E2) values in 162Yb and 166Hf are given in Table I.\nThe IBA calculations are also included in Fig. 8. Despite two\nadditional parameters, the agreement for yrast B(E2) values\ndoes not improve, with the IBA generally underpredicting\nthe values. However, the contrast between these two models\nis interesting. In both nuclei, X(5) fails for the 6+1 \u2192 4+1\ntransitions, where the aforementioned dip occurs, and is in\ngood agreement with the data for the 8+1 \u2192 6+1 transitions. In\ncontrast, the IBA reproduces the B(E2; 6+1 \u2192 4+1 ) values well\nbut fails for the 8+1 \u2192 6+1 transitions.\nNote that the reason for the difference between X(5) and the\nIBA in this regard stems from a fundamental difference in the\nphilosophy of the two models. In X(5), the yrast B(E2) values\nincrease monotonically, approaching a constant value, similar\nto the geometric rotor. In the IBA, the finite boson number\nresults in a parabolic behavior of these B(E2) values with\nspin. For these nuclei, the B(E2) values maximize at about\nJ = 10+ or 12+ and already show significant finite number\neffects (\u223c50% reductions) at spin 8+. The discrepancy for the\nIBA at higher spins measured here may reflect the difficulties\nwith its applicability in this spin regime where finite particle\nnumber effects occur or may have other origins (e.g., other\nintrinsic degrees of freedom absent from the IBA). This is an\nimportant ancillary topic of considerable interest that could be\ninvestigated with a systematic study of yrast band lifetimes in\ndeformed nuclei with plunger techniques.\nFrom the above comparisons, it appears that the low-lying\nstates of 162Yb and 166Hf are well described using a collective\n034303-8\nLIFETIME MEASUREMENTS OF YRAST STATES IN . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 034303 (2006)\nmodel with a \u03b2-soft, \u03b3 -rigid potential given by the X(5) critical\npoint model. The parameter-free X(5) model provides a better\ndescription of the yrast band B(E2) strengths in 166Hf than\nthe two-parameter IBA calculations. In 162Yb, the structure\nis somewhat more ambiguous, with some transitions agreeing\nwith the X(5) predictions and others supporting more the IBA\npredictions or the predictions of a deformed symmetric rotor.\nOverall, however, the comparison of the available data on\n162Yb and 166Hf suggests that they exhibit a similar level of\nagreement with the X(5) predictions as has been shown for the\nN = 90 isotones of Nd-Dy. These results provide evidence that\nnuclei manifesting an X(5)-like structure are not constrained\nto N = 90, and a reasonable level of agreement with the X(5)\npredictions is seen in nuclei in this mass region with N = 92\nand N = 94.\nV. CONCLUSION\nRDDS lifetime measurements were performed on yrast\nstates in 162Yb and 166Hf. The present results were found\nto be consistent within error with most of the previous\nmeasurements and yielded a significant reduction in the\nuncertainties of yrast band level lifetimes. The derived B(E2)\nvalues show good agreement with the X(5) critical point\nmodel, with the exception of the B(E2; 6+1 \u2192 4+1 ) value, which\nlies below the X(5) predictions in both nuclei. These results\nsuggest that the X(5) model provides a good description of\nnuclei with N = 92 (162Yb) and N = 94 (166Hf ) in the rare-earth\nregion. Two-parameter IBA calculations were found to provide\na less satisfactory description of the yrast B(E2) strengths\nabove spin 6+, possibly linked to a finite boson number effect.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nValuable discussions with F.
