This theory asserts that it is transactional\nrather than physical distance which is of greatest significance in any educational trans-\naction (Moore & Kearsley, 1996). Transactional distance is measured on a contin-\nuum of structure and dialogue. The more structure, the less dialogue and vice versa\n(Figure 1). A highly structured course will give little opportunity to challenge\nconcepts and explore congruent or tangential paths, while dialogue will inevitably\nlead to departures from planned outcomes and result in new, unanticipated learning\noutcomes.\nRelationship between dialogue and structure\n*Corresponding author.

Dron et al.\n   Moore does not suggest that either structure or dialogue is an inherently good\nthing. Each may be appropriate in different circumstances and a typical educational\nevent such as a conventional lecture will, at a micro-level, move constantly between\nthe two. However, the reciprocal relationship between them at any given point is\nimmutable. A third dimension of the theory suggests that more autonomous learners,\nbeing self-directed, are better able to cope with more structure while less autonomous\nlearners benefit more from greater dialogue. Moore equates less autonomy with more\nteacher control. Experimental evidence (Saba & Shearer, 1994) based on predictions\nof a system dynamics model correlated with discourse analysis, appears to confirm\nthat the theory is substantially correct. However, there may be some grounds for\nbelieving that there are rare exceptions (Dron, 2004) and there is a fuzziness in his\nformulation that allows for different interpretations depending on whether transac-\ntional distance is considered as a two by two matrix, a single continuum or distinct\nclusters (Garrison, 2000). In this paper we interpret structure and dialogue as broadly\ncharacterising two extremes of a single continuum with a reciprocal relationship\nbetween the two.\nBeginnings\nIn 2000, HEFCE (the Higher Education Funding Council for England) announced\nthat it would fund a number of pilot projects to create Foundation Degrees. Founda-\ntion Degrees are strongly work-based or work-related, designed and managed in\ncollaboration with employers and delivered mainly by Further Education (FE)\ncolleges. Equating to the first two years of an honours degree, they target students\nwho might otherwise be excluded from higher education, notably those with uncon-\nventional qualifications and\/or in work. Their focus tends to be more practical than\nacademic.\nLed by the University of Brighton, a consortium consisting of two universities, four\nFE colleges and various employers submitted a successful bid for HEFCE funding\nwhich led, in 2001, to the development of the eSystems Design & Technology degree.\nThe course was designed as an Internet Computing degree, to be delivered solely as\na part-time, four-year course. For strategic reasons the plan was to deliver at least\nsome of the course electronically, though the exact amount of and mechanism for this\ndelivery was not made explicit.\nA Course Development Team (CDT), consisting of representatives from each\ncollege and a University-based development leader, was appointed and given\nFigure 1. Relationship between dialogue and structure\n Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\n \n165\n   responsibility for course development, with quality control provided by the Univer-\nsity. A course leader from the University was appointed with a research back-\nground in and practical experience of online collaborative learning. However,\nthough playing a significant part in strategic planning, other commitments\nprevented the appointee (the first author of this paper) from playing more than a\nstrategic role in course development.\nDefining the course ethos\nDecisions about the form of the course were made, grounded in theory and pragmatic\nchoice. Pragmatically, the Internet was proposed as the main delivery mechanism so\nthat students could access course materials from their workplace or from home. This\nwas also seen as an effective means of monitoring and controlling the content and\nquality of the course across multiple colleges.\nLack of time and resources militated against the development of highly struc-\ntured course materials. As the course was aiming to attract learners who were\nunwilling or unable to enter conventional higher education, there was a need to\ncater for a rich variety of prior knowledge and learning styles. Wedermeyer (1971)\nnoted that independent study of the early 1970s typically offered little freedom in\ngoal determination and activity selection, an issue that has arisen frequently since\nthen despite the ubiquity of computer-mediated forms of distance education. The\nneed to cater for multiple learning styles implied alternative perspectives on the\nresources, multiple resources catering for different needs or an adaptive hyperme-\ndia approach (Brusilovsky, 2001). Furthermore, to cater sufficiently for a variety of\nlearning styles it was felt important to make use of rich media which, as Laurillard\nobserves are generally too expensive to be produced by individuals (Laurillard,\n1993, p. 182). However, with little time to develop such resources, these\napproaches were not deemed possible.\nApplying transactional distance theory, it was decided to define an ethos based on\nlearning through dialogue. A dialogue-based approach would require a lower\ncommitment of development time, albeit at the expense of time spent maintaining\ndialogue when the course was running (Figure 2). Most discussions would be facili-\ntated through online asynchronous forums. Synchronous approaches were felt to\nprovide insufficient flexibility for students in full time work, as well as posing some\ntechnical obstacles.\nRelationship of delivery to development time for structured\/dialogic delivery modesThe course was designed to be delivered in a blended mode. Seely Brown and\nDuguid observe that \u2018digital technologies are adept at maintaining communities\nalready formed. They are less good at making them\u2019. (Seely Brown & Duguid, 2000,\np. 206). For this reason, online discussions would be supplemented by occasional\nface-to-face meetings. They would also support the few parts of the course that\nrequired specialised laboratory facilities, which were kept to a minimum by basing\npractical work primarily on free and open source software.\nUsing computer mediated communication is a potentially hazardous approach as\nmediated communication is in some ways a pale shadow of face-to-face discussion\n 166\n \nJ. Dron et al.\n           and is not a simple replication of such discourse (Peters, 2000). Given the need to\ndevelop a learning community, course developers were urged to employ Salmon\u2019s five\nstep model (Salmon, 2000) and were given training in the approach. Salmon outlines\nthe five stages through which she believes an online learning community must pass in\norder to reach the stage at which learners are constructing knowledge through inter-\naction\u2014access & motivation, online socialization, information exchange, knowledge\nconstruction and finally, development. The model was adopted to provide teachers new\nto delivering distance learning with a reassuring and effective framework to assist\nthem in coming to terms with this unfamiliar mode of teaching.\nWith an explicit social constructivist ethos (Vygotsky, 1978), it was hoped that,\nwith time and suitable models of good practice, much of the learning might be facil-\nitated by the students themselves. Because students would come from relevant work\nbackgrounds and (by virtue of enrolling on such a course) were expected to be\nmature, motivated learners, it was hoped that they might have much to offer in terms\nof experience and knowledge and form an effective community of practice. As\nWenger puts it, \u2018The value of an institutionalized setting for learning often resides as\nmuch in its community-building potential as in the pedagogical intentions of its\ncurriculum\u2019 (Wenger, 1998, p. 208).\nMany authors have emphasized the importance of performance evaluation in\neducation (Bruner, 1966; Gagne, 1985; Laurillard, 1993). Summative and forma-\ntive assessment would be embedded throughout the course with a wide variety of\napproaches including portfolios, programming exercises, online tests, examinations,\nvivas, reports and problem-based assignments, in the belief that this would help\nFigure 2. Relationship of delivery to development time for structured\/dialogic delivery modes\n Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\n \n167\n    maintain focus and motivation. The result of this was that students would seldom\nspend more than three weeks without the need to submit some form of assessed\nwork. Although efforts were made to make much of this assessment as authentic as\npossible, in particular by relating it to the students\u2019 workplace, the course leader had\nsome misgivings about the reliance on assessment to provide extrinsic motivation\n(Whitehead, 1929; Illich, 1971; Holt, 1977).\nPreparing for delivery\nThe CDT met face-to-face approximately monthly, using an asynchronous discus-\nsion forum to facilitate the shared development of module specifications between\nmeetings. This small group were able to engender a strong sense of shared responsi-\nbility and identity, which it was hoped would be replicated amongst student groups\nonce the course was running.\nOnce the course outline had been approved and module specifications agreed,\ntutors from each of the four participating FE colleges were appointed to develop and\nto deliver the course. Only two of the 20 or so tutors involved in preparation of the\nfirst year\u2019s modules had any experience of distance learning, let alone online delivery,\nand only a handful had been involved in course development prior to this. Most were\nexcited by the challenge though a small but significant minority expressed scepticism\nabout the wisdom of choosing this method of delivery, preferring a traditional face-\nto-face approach. All tutors were required to attend an online tutor training (OTT)\ncourse created by one of the more experienced online tutors, based heavily on\nSalmon\u2019s five step model of e-moderating (Salmon, 2000).\nAn e-learning expert was employed to facilitate workshops in which module\noutlines were prepared and development work shared amongst the teaching team.\nThis helped to encourage a strong sense of ownership of the modules by their devel-\nopment teams. These sessions had a strong emphasis on developing module struc-\ntures and associated static materials, with, perhaps, insufficient emphasis on dialogue.\nFor many tutors this was their first encounter with the course and its approach, so\nthese workshops influenced them strongly.\nThe CDT believed that they had anticipated some of the potential pitfalls of online\neducation, but it soon became evident that this was not so. The huge change in teach-\ning approach required and the cascade of systemic dependencies that it would set in\nmotion is the main topic for the rest of this paper.\nThe first two years\nTwenty-eight students enrolled at the start of the first year. To compound this disap-\npointing start, one college recruited only three students, one of whom dropped out\nalmost immediately followed by a second a few months later. Within a couple of\nmonths of starting, two of the colleges had amalgamated, with consequent upheavals\nand uncertainties for staff and students alike.\n 168\n \nJ. Dron et al.\n     In the rush to prepare for the start of the course, it went almost unnoticed that a\nsmall number of tutors had failed to attend the OTT course and that, of those who\nhad, only about half had successfully completed it by the time the course began. The\nmain reason given was the lack of time, but the consequent lack of experience of\ndialogue-based learning proved problematic later.\nA poor student retention rate was matched by a high turnover rate for staff.\nAlthough another instance of the OTT course was run, this failed to keep pace with\nthe rapid staff turnover which in turn meant that the already over-stretched staff were\neven less prepared for the processes of online teaching. To make matters worse, new\ntutors lacked the sense of ownership of the process that motivated the founding team.\nRunning the course: the tutor experience\nIt became apparent early in the first year of the course that most tutors were relying\non familiar teaching methods and using the discussion boards only as an occasional\nmeans of communication with the students. Despite extensive online and offline\nencouragement this reliance on structure rather than dialogue did not improve\nthroughout the first two years of the course.\nFE college tutors\u2019 very full timetables contained discrete blocks of time when teach-\ning was supposed to occur for this course (typically a single block of three hours each\nweek, a mere thirteen percent of an average FE lecturer\u2019s teaching time), militating\nheavily against its asynchronous delivery\nGiven that virtually all the students on the course are working, by far the majority\nof their study and communication occurred in the evenings or at weekends. Although\nmost tutors adapted to this pattern of working, it fitted very uneasily with the rest of\ntheir over-filled timetables and their expectations that evenings and weekends should\nbe free from the demands of student contact.\nTutors found that dialogue-led delivery often took much longer than they had\nanticipated. To save time it was often simpler to rely on more traditional methods\nincluding a tendency to put off solving students\u2019 problems until the scheduled face-\nto-face session. This was exacerbated by the fact that many of the early course\nmodules involved the acquisition of specific skills and information (programming,\ndatabase design, simple Internet technologies and concepts). These topics were often\nperceived as lending themselves more readily to a structured one-way mode of deliv-\nery. Communication was confined to clarifying misconceptions and discussing good\npractice, tending to be directive rather than discursive.\nRunning the course: the student experience\nThe reason most often given for dropping out was and is students\u2019 inability to cope\nwith the demands of their work and the course. However, it soon became clear that\nsome of their preconceptions about the course and their own learning processes were\nat odds with the course ethos. Only a few were regular contributors to discussions,\nwith many content to simply log in, do the set reading\/tasks and log out again without\n Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\n \n169\n    any dialogue. The large amount of assessment spread throughout the course was\nover-demanding and demoralizing for many students. Those hard-pressed for time\ngot on with the essential reading and the assignments, and omitted the unassessed,\nand therefore apparently unnecessary dialogue.\nAlthough some students were willing to help each other out with corrections to\ncoding, good explanations and resource sharing, others saw helping each other as a\ndiversion from their own studies, failing to appreciate the benefits that can ensue from\nteamwork and dialogue. Some students lacked confidence, and so avoided posting\nquestions or problems to the discussion forums, for fear of ridicule.\nPerhaps because of their perceptions of education, combined with the demands of\ntheir employers, many students valued the acquisition of skills and factual informa-\ntion more highly than the surrounding processes of learning that can turn it into\nuseful knowledge.\nLack of timely feedback discouraged students from using the medium. One student\nsummed it up well: \nWe do need more feedback to discussions and problems posted to the teamroom. Some\ntutors are very good at this but others seem only to drop in once a week\u2014and a week is a\nlong time on this course! Several students feel that, whatever the value of the classroom\ncontact, it should be possible to do the course entirely remotely.\nThe compound effect of all these factors was that in most modules, only staccato\ndiscourse occurred, rarely stepping higher than Salmon\u2019s third stage of Information\nExchange (Salmon, 2000).\nA vicious circle\nOne tutor complained, \u2018I have tried without much success to get students to have\ndiscussions in the teamroom. One or two students may join in, but no one else does\u2014\nyou can end up having a discussion with yourself.\u2019 A student expressed the view,\n\u2018teamroom activity breeds teamroom activity, and lethargy breeds lethargy.\u2019\nA vicious circle developed. A predominance of skills-based learning combined with\ntutors\u2019 reticence to encourage dialogue online meant that the discussion areas were\nunder-utilized. The fewer expectations placed on the students, the less they felt the\nneed to contribute.\nAt this point, Moore\u2019s theory of transactional distance became very apparent. As\ndialogue diminished, structure came to dominate. Students, insufficiently supported\nby a learning community, came to rely increasingly on course notes. The more struc-\ntured the course became, the fewer the opportunities for dialogue arose. The effects\nof this on less autonomous learners were devastating.\nFew of the students had acquired the skill to be autonomous learners in an\nacademic setting. The fact that most had responsible jobs in \u2018white water\u2019 environ-\nments (Vaill, 1996, p. 4), where change is the norm and learning must be a way of life\nwas not considered. For better or worse the course was built around a traditional\nacademic framework, so students needed help and guidance to explore issues and\n 170\n \nJ. Dron et al.\n     clarify concepts. In the absence of an effective discussion forum, the brief face-to-face\nmeetings, originally intended mainly to provide social cohesion, increasingly became\nthe main occasions for learning on the course. One student noted: \nLessons are great, covering points missed and checking everything is as it should be, but\nas everyone seems to realize team room could be used more for discussion and covering\npoints.\nTorn between the demands of work and the need to participate in these contact\nsessions, with inadequate structured resources and no community to turn to in\nbetween, many students became disillusioned, and demotivated. By the end of the\nfirst year, half of the students had left the course and the college with a single remain-\ning student left the programme.\nWith only two FE colleges now involved in delivery, the second year began.\nAlthough recruitment was a little lower than that of the first year, slightly better reten-\ntion rates reflected refinements in delivery and design, especially a slight reduction in\nthe assessment load. However, it was apparent that the course was still plagued by\nsystemic problems, driven both by the tutors and the students.\nAway from structure, returning to dialogue\nSenge argues that, in any system, structure is a key determinant of behaviour (Senge,\n1993, pp. 40\u201341). The central problems of the course have been observed to be struc-\ntural in nature, leading to systemic behaviours which hinged around a number of\ninter-related issues. These in turn led to a cycle of ever-decreasing returns, excessive\nworkloads and a relative paucity of rich interactions in the virtual space. It was felt\nnecessary to break that cycle. It was not possible to radically improve the allocation\nof time to tutors, and it was impractical to consider a major change in the surrounding\neducational environment and timetabling. There was still no time to develop effective\nstructured learning materials. However, increasing dialogue seemed an achievable\ntarget.\nIn collaboration with tutors, a simple \u2018chunk and talk\u2019 strategy was developed.\nStudents would be presented with a discussion forum as the entry point to each\nmodule, in which the tutor would outline the tasks for the week (or chunk of several\nweeks) and initiate a dialogue. By starting with a discussion, it was hoped that\nstudents would focus much more on process rather than absorption of content, and\nthat there would be more of an emphasis on the learning community, reducing isola-\ntion for the learners.\nChunking topics into logical units provided students with more control over their\nown work patterns, although this was counterbalanced somewhat by the demands of\ndialogue, participation in which required continual attention.\nTo help build a more dynamic learning community (and also because of the declin-\ning group sizes), the online teaching for both colleges was amalgamated, with a single\ntutor responsible for leading the online discussion for each chunk of learning. Face-\nto-face meetings would, however, still be led at each college by the local staff member.\n Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\n \n171\n  It was hoped that this would engender more collaboration amongst the teaching\nteam, and that as staff gained a greater understanding of the importance of online\ncommunication and collaboration, they would find it easier to facilitate the develop-\nment of this sense of partnership amongst the student community.\nTo help assist tutors lost within an unfamiliar online environment, strong advice\nwas given to module designers to follow a pedagogy based on Kolb\u2019s experiential\nlearning cycle (Kolb, 1984). This cycle of abstract conceptualization, reflective obser-\nvation, active experimentation and concrete experience, with its focus on situated\nlearning, was seen to fit neatly with the work-related\/work-based nature of the course\nas well as providing a simple framework and easy-to-follow formula.\nSummative assessment would be significantly reduced and what was left would be\nembedded further into the practice of the course. Specifically, some assignments\nrequired participation in online discussions, for example in designing the solution to\na problem or exploring recent technological developments\nSome early results\nThe new approach has been implemented for one semester to the current cohort of\n10\u201312 students per year group. Modules that are running for the first time have been\ndeveloped on the basis of this approach, while existing modules have been adapted to\na greater or lesser extent.\nThe results have not all been encouraging. Staff changes and the limitations\nimposed in the hard-pressed FE sector have again resulted in insufficient time being\nallowed to do the approach full justice and not all staff have taken the advice to use\nthe Kolb cycle as a framework. Similarly, although there is general recognition of the\nneed for discussion, several tutors continue to use forums to ask simple, answerable\nquestions rather than exploring the problems and issues that allow learners to explore\nconcepts and engage in dialogue.\nJust over 60% of all accesses to the system over the past semester were in the\ncommunication areas. Analysis suggests a roughly similar proportion in previous\nyears (60% discussion for the first year the course ran, 57% for the second) which,\ngiven potential inaccuracies and the fact that the systems in use are not directly\ncomparable, is disappointing. However, the use of communication areas varies with\nyear group, with rates of 64% for first year students, 61% for second year students\nand 57% for third year students.\nThere are still very few deep conversations going on, with the majority of messages\nconcerned with either problem solving or the process, such as giving assignment dates\nand schedules. Worse, although it is difficult to draw direct comparisons due to the\ndifferent organization of the sites, there seems little difference in the actual number\nof messages posted when compared with previous years.\nOne positive outcome has been observed. This year, the most active students have\nposted around three times as many messages as the least active, whereas last year the\nratio was greater than eighteen to one. This broadening of participation in dialogue\n 172\n \nJ. Dron et al.\n     will lead to a greater awareness of the presence of others, hence reducing the loneli-\nness and isolation that less active participants experienced before.\nRetention rates have improved when compared with the same period in previous\nyears. Discussion forums are not the only reason for this: contributory factors\ninclude a more thorough and honest interview process, a reduction in assessment\nload, greater experience of tutors, a more reliable online environment, more\ndiverse discussion groups, better pedagogy and reduced dependence on tutor-\nprepared materials.\nThe move to a more discussion-oriented process has not been universally popular\nwith our first cohort of students, now in their third year. It is directly responsible for\nthe loss of one student from this group who commented: \nI\u2019ll be back next year when, hopefully, the course will not discriminate against students\nwho cannot make timely contributions to discussions (or the University pays my mortgage\nso I can give it priority over my employer!)\nI\u2019m off now to read a few books over the coming months just to prove to myself, at least,\nthat it is possible to learn without discussion.\nMost students who joined in the first year of the course are of necessity autonomous\nlearners, as any who were not have already left. For such learners it may seem an\nunnecessary imposition to require them to be involved in a collaborative learning\nprocess. It is also possible that insufficient attention has been paid to the significant\nbenefits of peripheral involvement or \u2018lurking\u2019, which might still enable learners to\nenjoy the benefits of internalized dialogue. Preece suggests that this kind of involve-\nment may be highly immersive, leading to strong senses of belonging to the commu-\nnity despite lack of direct interaction (Preece, 2000, pp. 87\u201390).\nConclusion\nThe evolution of this course continues and this paper is just a snapshot capturing its\nprogress so far from the authors\u2019 highly situated perspective. There are few immuta-\nble conclusions to be drawn from the experiences presented here, but several issues\nseem worth emphasizing.\nFirstly, the struggle for predominance between dialogue and structure has shifted\nthroughout the course\u2019s short life and shows no signs of abating, despite well-inten-\ntioned efforts to force it in a particular direction. This lends credence to Moore\u2019s\ntheory of transactional distance: as structure increases, dialogue decreases and vice\nversa.\nSecondly, it is difficult to implement something new when surrounded by self-\norganizing forces that tend towards equilibrium and reinforcement of the status\nquo.\nThough by no means original, the following conclusions also bear repeating.\nFirstly, the transition from face-to-face teaching to online learning requires a real-\nistic (and large) allocation of resources. High structure requires a lot of up-front\ninvestment (Laurillard, 1993), whereas high dialogue needs this to be ongoing.\n Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\n \n173\n          Secondly, transforming teaching practice in the radical way required to implement\na successful online course requires a thorough but sensitive approach to educating\ntutors as well as students.\nThirdly, in the absence of tacit social cues, weaknesses in pedagogy are accentuated\nin an online environment. Those social cues are significant: \u2018Efficient communication\nrelies not on how much can be said, but on how much can be unsaid\u2019 (Seely Brown\n& Duguid, 2000). To help overcome this, the authors believe that pedagogic theories\nshould be explicitly applied as part of the strategic underpinning of a course.\nFinally, maintaining regular face-to-face contact throughout the module encour-\nages avoidance of online discussion. An alternative approach, using concentrated\nface-to-face periods at greater intervals, is currently being considered.\nDespite the setbacks, the authors still believe in the importance of the principal\nstrategy of building a successful learning community. If our aim is to produce inde-\npendent, thinking and questioning graduates, we must be prepared to cultivate and\nnurture a collaborative online community in which geographical distance becomes\nless relevant as transactional distance shrinks.\nThis paper has largely dwelt on the things that have gone wrong. It has made little\nmention of the fact that those students who remain are highly effective learners,\nachieving high commendations from internal and external examiners alike. It has said\nlittle of the tutors\u2019 extraordinary dedication and care for students, nor of their high\nlevels of skill and expertise that have been brought to bear on the course, nor the\nclose-knit teams that make it all possible.\nThe complex system that we recognize as a course is made of the interactions of its\nown parts and with other systems, including those of which it is a constituent. Like\nmany complex systems, it learns and develops with an internal dynamic very different\nfrom the sum of its components, not always in the ways that its leaders expect or\nintend. The movement from structure to dialogue and back again is one that can be\nstrongly influenced, but seldom fully controlled. That control arises at least in part\nfrom the systemic interactions within the system itself.\nDespite the inadequate recruitment, the high student drop-out rate, the rapid staff\nturnover, the unplanned disasters and the unintentional consequences of intentional\nchange, the eSystems course is in many ways a successful system. It has strong inter-\nnal cohesion, yet it is fuelled by diversity. In adversity it has displayed an adaptive\ndynamic and continues to evolve, despite as much as because of those who try to\ncontrol it.\nReferences\nBruner, J.S.
