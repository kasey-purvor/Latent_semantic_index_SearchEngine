A radio wave correlation experiment using a Mills\nCross technique can be used to observe the cosmic noise in-\ntensity from the ground for the purpose of determining the\nabsorption in the ionosphere. To ensure a time resolution of\n10 to 20 s of the absorption observations, it is necessary that\nthe autocorrelation function of the signal received within a\nwanted spatial resolution and in a given receiver is >8% of\nthe total signal amplitude incident on that receiver.\nKey words. Radio Science (Instruments and techniques; In-\nterferometry; Ionospheric physics)\n1 Introduction\nIn riometer experiments the variations of the mean value of\nthe cosmic noise received on the surface of the Earth is used\nto determine the absorption of radio waves in the ionosphere.\nSince the cosmic signal is a noise signal, its mean value can\nbe determined only approximately. The larger the bandwidth\nof the receiver and the longer the time over which the signal\nis integrated, the more accurately the mean value is deter-\nmined. The fluctuation of the mean value can be written as\ndA = 10log\n(\nPo\nP\n)\n,\nwhere Po is the ideal mean value and P is the current esti-\nmate. Let Po=P+dP , where dP is the deviation of the actual\nmean value from Po. Considering this deviation as noise on\nthe measurements of P , one can define the Signal-to-Noise\nvalue of the measurements as SNR=P\/dP . Thus, the ob-\nserved fluctuations of the cosmic noise intensity is expressed\nin dB in terms of the Signal-to-Noise of the measurements,\ndA = 10log\n(\n1+ 1\nSNR\n)\n.\nCorrespondence to: E. Nielsen\n(nielsen@linmpi.mpg.de)\nIf a dA<0.1 dB is required, then the observations of the cos-\nmic noise intensity must be made with a SNR > 40.\nRiometer systems employ a single antenna or a group of\nantennas to detect the cosmic noise. In the case of a group\nof antennas the signals from each antenna are usually added\ntogether with an appropriate phase to provide the noise inten-\nsity in the antenna beam formed by the antenna group (see,\nfor example, Detrick and Rosenberg, 1990). More recently,\nit was suggested to use a correlator experiment (Mills Cross\ntechnique) to form the antenna beams (Nielsen and Hagfors,\n1997; hereafter NH97). The rationale behind this sugges-\ntion was to use a significant smaller number of antennas to\nachieve the same, or an improved, antenna beam width than\nwould be required in an additive system. In this paper it is\npointed out, that for a given accuracy, the integration time\naimed at in NH97 may be overly optimistic (1 s). Consider-\ning that the correlation technique relies on extracting a small\nsignal from within a very large signal, a realistic integration\ntime may well be in excess of tens of seconds.\n2 Additive antenna arrays\nUsing an antenna with an antenna lobe of some shape the\nfluctuations of the SNR of the cosmic noise received with\nthat antenna is determined by the bandwidth, B, of the re-\nceiver used to detect the signal and by the integration time, \u03c4\nSNR = \u221a\u03c4 \u00d7 B.\nThe fluctuations on the absorption measurements one can\nobtain with this system is given by\ndA = 10log\n(\n1+ 1\u221a\n\u03c4 \u00d7 B\n)\n.\n1688 E. Nielsen et al.: Time resolution of cosmic noise observations\n3 Correlation system\nA correlation system using a Mills Cross technique consists\nof two horizontal rows of antennas oriented perpendicular to\neach other. The antennas in each row are connected together\nwith a linear phase progression along the row, to form a fan\nantenna lobe oriented perpendicular to the direction of the\nrow and making an angle with the vertical that corresponds\nto the magnitude of the phase progression. Where two fan\nlobes (one for each row) intersect, a pencil antenna lobe is\nformed, and the intensity in the pencil lobe is determined by\ncross-correlating the signals received in the two fan lobes.\nThomson et al. (1991) determined the Signal-to-Noise ra-\ntio of the correlator output to be\nSNR = \u03c1\u221a2\u00d7 \u03c4 \u00d7 B,\nwhere \u03c1(\u001c 1) is the cross-correlation coefficient associated\nwith the correlating signals in the pencil lobe. The factor \u201c2\u201d\narises from a sampling rate that is twice the bandwidth.\nIt is assumed that the antenna gain in each fan is approx-\nimately constant as a function of direction inside the fan.\nThe case is now considered in which each fan is subdivided\ninto N equally narrow angular intervals, each interval corre-\nsponding to one of the pencil lobes in which intensities are\nto be determined. Since all the cosmic noise intensity arriv-\ning within a particular antenna fan is detected on the receiver\nconnected to this antenna fan lobe, only a fraction 1\/N of\nthe total receiver signal is received within each of the smaller\nsubdivisions corresponding to directional intensities. Out-\nside the particular subdivision a fraction (N\u22121)\/N of the to-\ntal signal is received. The signal received outside a particular\nsubdivision is a signal for other subdivisions, but is consid-\nered noise for the particular subdivision. Thus, the fraction\nof the total signal received in any one fan lobe that is relevant\nto a particular subdivision can be approximated as\nfraction =\n1\nN\nN\u22121\nN\n= 1\nN \u2212 1 .\nLet \u201cfraction\u201d be an approximation of the relative ampli-\ntude of the signal received from a particular subdivision, or\npencil antenna lobe, in comparison to the signal received in\nthe whole fan. Then the cross-correlation value of the signal\nreceived in the pencil lobe is \u03c1\u223c1\/(N\u22121)2.\nThe SNR of cosmic noise signal intensities received in a\ncorrelation system can now be written as\nSNR =\n\u221a\n2\u00d7 \u03c4 \u00d7 B\n(N \u2212 1)2 .\nand the fluctuation on absorption measurements is, in dB,\ndA = 10log\n(\n1+ (N \u2212 1)\n2\n\u221a\n2\u00d7 \u03c4 \u00d7 B\n)\n.\nCompared with the case for additive antenna lobe forma-\ntion, the fluctuating term in dA has increased by \u223c(N\u22121)2,\nwhere N is the number of pencil lobes formed within each\nfan antenna lobe.\nFor a bandwidth of 1 MHz and for SNR >40 we find a\nlower limit on the required integration time,\n\u03c4 > 8\u00d710\u22124\u00d7(N\u22121)4.\nFor SNR \u223c40 and variable N, we find: for N\u226412, \u03c4\u226412 s,\nand for N\u226414, \u03c4\u226423 s. Thus, for a required accuracy on the\nabsorption measurements of about 0.1 dB, and an integration\ntime in the range between 10 and 20 s, a fan lobe should be\nsubdivided into no more than about 12 pencil antenna lobes.\nThis means that the power received in a pencil lobe should\nexceed \u223c8% of the total power received in the fan lobe. Re-\ncent measurements with a correlation array tend to confirm\nthese arguments (Grill et al., 2003).\nNote that the performance of a Mills Cross antenna system\nis in accordance with theoretical predictions (see NH97), in-\ndependent of the integration time. However, it is also clear\nthat the antenna system may be designed to improve (reduce)\nthe integration time for a given required accuracy.\nIn the following section some different configurations of\nantenna arrays are discussed with a view to improve the time\nresolution of the absorption measurements obtained with a\nMills Cross technique.\n4 Antenna arrays\nThe previous sections makes it clear that it is not the actual\nsize of the antenna beams which determines the minimum\nusable integration time, but it is rather the size of the narrow\nbeams relative to the width of the fan beam that is impor-\ntant. The narrow beam should be >8% of the width of the\nfan beam. Thus, the slimmer the fan beam \u2013 the smaller the\nfield of view \u2013 the narrower the narrow beams can be. The\nnature of the correlation technique when used to observe cos-\nmic noise is such, that the better the spatial resolution, the\nsmaller the field of view.\nNielsen (2001) described an antenna with 32 dipoles in\neach Mills Cross antenna row, separated by half a wave-\nlength, and connected to a 32-element Butler matrix (see\nalso NH97). Using linear tapering of the current amplitudes\non the dipoles a radiation diagram for the correlation system\nwas produced, with a side lobe performance equal to that of\na 16\u00d716=256 element square antenna array.\nA comparable result could be achieved (without actually\nusing tapering of the antenna currents) by combining the But-\nler matrix outputs pair wise into 16 outputs from the 32 ele-\nment Butler matrix. The reason is that the combined outputs\ncorrespond to a cosine-tapering of the current amplitudes on\nthe dipoles (Muenzer, 1972). It is to be evaluated what is\ntechnically easier: to taper the antenna signals, or to com-\nbine the Butler matrix outputs pair wise.\nIf we only consider lobes with a zenith angle less than 60\ndegrees, then for these cases we may use N\u223c14. In order to\nfurther decrease N, one would have to narrow the width of\nthe fan beams, i.e. narrow the antenna beams in the direction\nE. Nielsen et al.: Time resolution of cosmic noise observations 1689\nperpendicular to the direction of the array arms. This implies\nthat the antennas in the arms should have more narrow an-\ntenna diagrams than corresponds to a dipole. For example,\none might use yagis instead of dipoles, or use two dipoles\n(separated by, say, 0.5 wavelength) instead of one, in effect\nwidening the antenna arms.\nUsing antenna arms with 32-double dipoles connected in\nphase and the 32-antenna signals connected to a 32-element\nButler matrix, and with the Butler matrix outputs connected\npair wise, would constitute a system in which effectively\n12\u00d712 antenna lobes could be formed each lobe with a\nlobe-width of 7.6 degrees (corresponding to 12-km hori-\nzontal resolution in the ionosphere), and the largest zenith\nangle \u223c45 degrees (corresponding to a spatial coverage of\n180\u00d7180 km). The new system can achieve the same spatial\nresolution as a 16 by 16 additive field array antenna system,\nbut with a reduced number of antennas which is a clear im-\nprovement.\nAcknowledgements.
