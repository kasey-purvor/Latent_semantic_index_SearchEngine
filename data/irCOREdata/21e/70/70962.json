Gastrointestinal\nnematodes are perhaps the most important parasites\nof domestic sheep world-wide, and Teladorsagia\n(formerly Ostertagia) circumcinta is the major para-\nsite of sheep in temperate areas, causing significant\nmorbidity and loss of production. Gastrointestinal\nnematode infections can be treated by anthelmintic\nchemotherapy; however, treatment is costly and\ndrug resistance has evolved in all major parasite\nspecies (Prichard, 1994; Roos, 1997). For these\nreasons, selection for parasite resistance in domestic\nsheep has been undertaken in many countries (Beh &\nMaddox, 1996). The next logical stage is to identify\ncandidate genes or genetic markers for QTL for\nresistance to gain a more thorough understanding of\n* Corresponding author: Department of Animal and Plant\nSciences, Alfred Denny Building, University of Sheffield,\nSheffield S10 2TN, UK.\nE-mail : d.coltman!sheffield.ac.uk\nthe genetic mechanisms underlying resistance\n(Schwaiger et al. 1995; Beh & Maddox, 1996;\nWoolaston & Baker, 1996; Crawford et al. 1997;\nPaterson, Wilson & Pemberton, 1998).\nResearchers at AgResearch, New Zealand, and\nCSIRO, Australia, have carried out independent full\ngenome scans of half-sib pedigrees bred from sires\nderived from crosses of divergent lines selected over\nseveral generations for high and low resistance to\nnematode parasites (predominantly Haemonchus\ncontortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis). At the\n26th International Conference on Animal Genetics\nin 1998 (Auckland, N.Z.) both groups reported\nfinding 3\u20136 chromosomal regions showing evidence\nof segregation of QTL influencing resistance (K.\nBeh and A. Crawford, personal communications). In\ncommon to both of these studies are putative QTL\nof large effect on the q arm of chromosome 3. The\nmost likely known candidate gene in this region is\ninterferon gamma ((IFN)-c) which has been mapped\nto 3q23 by in situ hybridization (Goldammer et al.\n1996). Subsequent to finding the chromosome 3\nQTL, Crawford and others performed a more\ndetailed scan of the q arm of chromosome 3 using\nmarkers spaced at approximately 4 cM intervals\n(Crawford & McEwen, 1998). Four markers located\nParasitologyParasitology (2001), 122, 571\u2013582.

Coltman and others 572\nwithin 2 cM of the IFN gene, including a diallelic\nmicrosatellite located in the first intron described by\nSchmidt et al. (1996), showed the strongest asso-\nciation with resistance. Crawford & McEwen (1998)\nalso found a significant difference between the\nfrequencies of the \u2018resistant\u2019 and \u2018susceptible \u2019 alleles\nat the (IFN)-c microsatellite locus between the\noriginal selection lines. In addition to the micro-\nsatellite marker, Crawford & McEwen (1998)\nidentified 36 single nucleotide substitutions and\ninsertion}deletions of 1 and 8 nucleotides in their\nanalysis of DNA sequences of the complete gene\n(4842 bp) from resistant and susceptible individuals.\nThese polymorphisms, most but not all of which\noccur in untranslated regions, defined only 2 distinct\nhaplotypes associated with either resistance or sus-\nceptibility in their selection lines.\nWhile it is not yet clear if a functional poly-\nmorphism in a coding region of the (IFN)-c gene or\nin a regulatory sequence is the actual source of the\nQTL effect, (IFN)-c is a cytokine that plays an\nimportant role in the regulation of the immune\nresponse to parasitic infection (Wakelin, 1996),\nmaking it a highly suggestive functional and\npositional candidate gene. (IFN)-c is secreted by T\nand NK cells, resulting in the activation of macro-\nphages and general up-regulation of the cell-\nmediated immune response via potentiation of Th\n\"\ncell responses, while it down-regulates the pro-\nduction of the Th\n#\ncell subset (Wakelin, 1996). Th\n#\ncells are associated with resistance to infection from\nextracellular parasites such as gastrointestinal\nnematodes, while the Th\n\"\nresponse is relatively\nbeneficial to the survival of the nematode parasite\nand detrimental to host resistance (Else et al. 1994;\nGrencis, 1997). Any type of polymorphism leading\nto differential expression or receptor-binding affinity\nof (IFN)-c could thus conceivably lead to an effect\non resistance to extracellular parasites.\nThe work of Crawford & McEwen (1998) suggests\nthat the (IFN)-c locus is associated with variation in\nparasite resistance in domestic sheep. The purpose\nof this study is to determine if microsatellite\npolymorphism at the o(IFN)-c locus (Schmidt et al.\n1996) is associated with parasite resistance in a free-\nliving population of naturally-parasitized Soay sheep\n(Ovis aries) on the island of Hirta, St Kilda.\nGastrointestinal nematodes, primarily Teladorsagia\ncircumcincta, are an important selective force in this\npopulation as they are strongly implicated in over-\nwinter mortality (Gulland, 1992; Gulland & Fox,\n1992; Gulland et al. 1993; Illius et al. 1995).\nFurthermore, there is clearly a genetic component to\nresistance in this population, as FEC is heritable\n(Smith et al. 1999), is affected by inbreeding\n(Coltman et al. 1999b) and shows associations with a\nprotein marker (Gulland et al. 1993) and MHC-\nlinked microsatellites (Paterson, Wilson & Pem-\nberton, 1998).\nIn this study, we analyse the associations between\nalleles at the o(IFN)-c microsatellite locus and at\n2 flanking microsatellite loci on FEC measured in\nSoay sheep at 4 and 16 months of age. In addition,\nwe examine variation in parasite-specific IgA titre.\nIgA is an immunoglobulin which is produced in\nresponse to foreign peptides, including nematode\nderived molecules (Wakelin, 1996). Variation in T.\ncircumcincta faecal egg output in domestic lambs is\nassociated with variation in the IgA response to\nfourth stage larvae (Stear et al. 1995; Stear, Park &\nBishop, 1996; Stear, Strain & Bishop, 1999b).\nFinally, we investigate whether polymorphism at\no(IFN)-c is associated with over-winter survival.\nWe hypothesize that if a major QTL for parasite\nresistance located near the (IFN)-c gene was seg-\nregating in Soay sheep then alleles at the o(IFN)-c\nlocus which show the strongest favourable associa-\ntions with FEC and IgA might also show an\nassociation with improved over-winter survival.\nmaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe study population is located on the island of\nHirta (638 hectares), in the St Kilda archipelago\nlocated approximately 50 miles west of the Outer\nHebrides, Scotland (57\u00b0 49 \u00ab N, 08\u00b0 34 \u00ab W). The\nHirta population was founded in 1932 following the\nevacuation of the human population when 107 sheep\n(20 rams, 44 ewes, 21 ewe lambs and 22 castrated\nram lambs) were introduced from the adjacent island\nof Soay. Since 1932 the Soay sheep have existed in an\nunmanaged state on Hirta.\nThe dynamics of the Soay sheep on Hirta are\ncharacterized by periodic over-winter crashes oc-\ncurring in years of high population density coupled\nwith harsh winter weather conditions in which up to\n70% of the population may die (Clutton-Brock et al.\n1991, 1992; Grenfell et al. 1992, 1998). Since 1932,\nthe Hirta population has therefore fluctuated be-\ntween 600 and 2000 individuals. Mortality during\ncrashes is proximately caused by starvation; how-\never, it is exacerbated by protein and nutrient\ndeficiency caused by strongyle nematodes, primarily\nT. circumcincta (Gulland, 1992; Gulland & Fox,\n1992). Over-winter survival probability is negatively\nassociated with FEC measured in the previous\nAugust (Illius et al. 1995; Coltman et al. 1999b) and\nanimals that have been experimentally relieved of\ntheir nematode burdens show significantly improved\nsurvival during population crashes (Gulland, 1992;\nGulland et al. 1993).\nMonitoring of survival and parasitism\nSince 1985, over 95% of the sheep born in the\nVillage Bay study area (comprising approximately\n30% of the total island flock) have been individually\nIFN gamma and parasite resistance in Soay sheep 573\nmarked, sampled for genetic analyses and monitored\nthroughout their lives. Survival is monitored in 10 or\nmore censuses of the study area conducted during\nspring, summer and autumn. In addition, systematic\nsearches of the study area are conducted each spring.\nIndividuals are considered to have survived the\nwinter if they are known to be alive in May of the\nfollowing year. Since 1988, approximately 50% of\nthe Village Bay population was caught each August\nand weighed and sampled for blood and faeces.\nStrongyle eggs in faeces are determined to the\nnearest 100 per gram using a modification of the\nMcMaster technique (MAFF, 1971). Counts are\npredominantly made up of T. circumcincta ; however,\nTeladorsagia davtiana, Ostertagia trifurcata, Tricho-\nstrongylus axei, and Trichostrongylus vitrinus are also\npresent (Gulland & Fox, 1992). Gulland and Fox\n(1992) found that 78% of all gastrointestinal worms\nidentified in post-mortem examinations of Soay\nsheep were of the genus Teladorsagia, and of these\n85% were T. circumcincta. Faecal egg count (FEC) is\nused in this paper as a measure of nematode parasite\nresistance and offers the advantages that (i) it is non-\ndestructive, (ii) it is repeatable within individuals\nover short time-intervals, and (iii) it is determined\nby the number, size and fecundity of worms present\nin the gut. In this study we focus on individuals that\nhad FEC measured as lambs (at approximately\n4 months of age) or as yearlings (at approximately\n16 months of age). Individuals that had previously\nbeen treated with either anthelmintics (Gulland,\n1992) or hormones (Stevenson & Bancroft, 1995) in\nother experimental studies were excluded from this\nstudy.\nIgA activity\nThe activity of plasma IgA against a somatic extract\nof 4th-stage larvae from T. circumcincta was\nmeasured by indirect ELISA. Fourth-stage larvae\nwere harvested 4 days after infecting helminth-na\u0131$ve\nlambs with 150000 infective larvae. The abomasum\nwas washed with tap water and cut into strips. These\nstrips were suspended in Baermann funnels con-\ntaining PBS (pH 7\u20134) at 37 \u00b0C. The larvae were then\nplaced onto surgical swabs and the migrating larvae\nrecovered in PBS. The recovered larvae were washed\n5\u2039 in PBS, once in PBS containing 100 i.u.\npenicillin}ml, 0\u20131 mg streptomicin}ml, 2\u20135 lg am-\nphotericin B}ml, and 0\u201305 mg gentamycin}ml and\nonce in Tris\u2013inhibitor solution (10 mm Tris con-\ntaining 1 mm EDTA (disodium ethylene diamine\ntetraacetic acid), 1 mm EGTA (ethylene glycol bis\n(2-amino ethyl ether)-N,N,N \u00abN \u00ab-tetraacetic acid),\n1 mm NEM (N-ethylmaleimide), 0\u20131 lm pepstatin,\n1 mm PMSF (phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride)\nand 0\u20131 mm TPCK (N-tosylamide-l-phenylalanine\nchloromethyl ketone)). After centrifugation, the\npellet was resuspended in 1% (v}v) sodium de-\noxycholate in Tris\u2013inhibitor solution and stored at\nfi20 \u00b0C. After thawing, the sample was homogenized\non ice with a hand-held electric homogenizer (Janke\n& Kunkel IKA Labortechnik). The supernatant was\nfiltered through a 0\u20132 lm filter and aliquots stored at\nfi80 \u00b0C. The protein concentration was estimated\nwith bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) and adjusted to\n5 lg}ml in 0\u201306 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 9\u20136) before\nuse.\nThe wells on a flat-bottomed microtitre plate\n(Nunc) were coated with 100 ll of parasite solution\nand left overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The plate was washed\n5 times in PBS\u2013Tween (0\u20131% (v}v) Tween 20 in\nPBS), incubated for 2 h with 200 ll of blocking\nbuffer (4% skimmed milk powder in PBS\u2013Tween),\nthen again washed 5\u2039 in PBS\u2013Tween. Then 100 ll\nof plasma sample diluted in blocking buffer were\nadded to each of 3 wells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for\n30 min. After another 5 washes in PBS\u2013Tween,\n100 ll of a rat monoclonal anti-sheep IgA at a\ndilution of 1:50 in blocking buffer were added and\nincubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After 5 further washes\nin PBS\u2013Tween, 100 ll of goat anti-rat IgG conju-\ngated to alkaline phosphatase at 1:1000 in blocking\nbuffer were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C.\nAfter 5 final washes in PBS\u2013Tween, 100 ll of BCIP\n(KPL) were added and incubated for a further\n30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The reaction was then read on\na microplate reader at 635nm. The mean of\n3 replicates from a pooled sample of helminth-na\u0131$ve\ndomestic lambs was subtracted from the sample\nmean and this adjusted mean was divided by the\nmean of 3 replicates from a pool of high-responder\ndomestic lambs after subtracting the mean of the\nhelminth na\u0131$ve domestic lambs (Sinski et al. 1995).\nThree replicates from the na\u0131$ve and high responder\npools were included on each plate. The pool of high\nresponder lambs was created by combining equal\nquantities of plasma from 6 domestic lambs that gave\nstrong IgA responses following natural infection.\nThe value for each sample was therefore expressed as\na proportion of a positive control.\nGenetic analyses\nAll individuals that had been sampled for FEC at age\n4 and}or 16 months were typed at the o(IFN)-c\nmicrosatellite locus (Schmidt et al. 1996) and 2\nflanking microsatellites which serve as controls, BL4\n(Smith et al. 1997) and VH34 (Pierson et al. 1993)\nusing procedures described previously (Bancroft,\nPemberton & King, 1995). o(IFN)-c is a tetra-\nnucleotide repeat, which is diallelic in domestic\nsheep, located within intron 1 of the ovine interferon\ngamma gene (Schmidt et al. 1996). The ovine\ninterferon gamma gene has been cytologically\nmapped to 3q23\u201324 (Goldammer et al. 1996).\nPreliminary screening indicated that BL4 (chromo-\nsome 3, 208 cM) and VH34 (chromosome 3, 217 cM)\nD.

This\napproach enabled us to take into account the specific\nerror structure of each response variable, and to\nincorporate other known sources of variation sim-\nultaneously. Models were constructed separately for\nlambs and yearlings for 4 reasons. First, sources of\nvariation in survival and FEC of Soay sheep are\nknown to differ between age classes (Coltman et al.\n1999b ; Paterson et al. 1998). Second, the degree of\naggregation in FEC differs between lambs and\nyearlings (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Third, 10\u201315% of\nthe individuals considered in this study were\nmeasured for FEC and IgA both as lambs and\nyearlings, therefore models including both age\nclasses would suffer from pseudoreplication. Finally,\ngenetic effects on parasite resistance might be\nexpected to change with age. For example, Bishop et\nal. (1996) reported that genetic variation for acquired\nresistance to strongyles increases with age from birth\nto 6 months in Scottish Blackface sheep within an\nanthelmintic regime.\nFor each trait and age-class, a single model was\nconstructed in the following manner. First, non-\ngenetic sources of variation were fitted as main\neffects. In all models, sex (factor: male versus\nfemale), year (factor) and weight (continuous) were\nentered. Age (continuous: days since birth) and twin\nstatus (factor: twin versus singleton) were also fitted\nto models for lambs. The significance of each\npredictor variable was then tested by comparing the\ndeviance explained by the full model to a model not\ncontaining the term in question (Crawley, 1993).\nThe non-genetic full model was reduced by re-\nmoving each non-significant term, starting with the\nterm having the highest P value. Following re-\nduction, the resultant model consists of only\nsignificant terms (the non-genetic minimal model).\nIn order to determine which locus showed the\nstrongest statistical association with resistance, gen-\netic terms for all 3 loci were then fitted to the\nminimal non-genetic model simultaneously, and the\nD.

Locus terms were fitted under\nan allelic substitution model in which the count of\neach allele present at each locus is fitted as a\ncontinuous variable (e.g. Paterson et al. 1998).\nAlleles with frequency less than 0\u201305 were pooled\nwith their nearest neighbouring size class to ensure\nadequate sample sizes. Due to linkage dis-\nequilibrium, the effects of any 1 locus are expected to\nbe aliased with another locus to a certain extent;\ntherefore each locus was also tested alone in the\nminimal non-genetic model to determine if each\nlocus would have explained significant variation in\nthe absence of other genetic information.\nEffects of maternal genotype\nConfounding maternal genetic effects on IgA and\nFEC could arise if there was significant maternally\nderived antibody circulating in lambs at the time of\nsampling, and there was a relationship between the\nmaternal genotype and maternal IgA production. In\norder to assess whether the genetic effects observed\nin the analyses of IgA and FEC were confounded by\nthe effects of the maternal genotype, we also fitted\nthe maternal o(IFN)-c genotype to models where\nsignificant genetic effects were found.\nresults\nA total of 1076 individuals had FEC measured as\nlambs (Nfl904) and}or yearlings (Nfl325, Table\n1). A total of 153 individuals was sampled at both\nages. Arithmetic mean FEC was approximately\n2-fold higher in lambs than in yearlings (Table 1),\nwhereas the mean IgA index was more than twice as\nhigh in yearlings than in lambs (Table 1). Frequency\ndistributions of both variables in each age class are\nshown in Fig. 1. Distributions of both FEC and IgA\ntended to exhibit greater skew in lambs than in\nyearlings (skewnessfl2\u20131 versus 0\u20134 for IgA, and 3\u20130\nversus 2\u20130 for FEC for lambs and yearlings, re-\nspectively). In lambs, FEC was negatively associated\nwith IgA and body weight, but not significantly\nassociated with age in days since birth (Table 2).\nHowever, both IgA and weight increased signifi-\ncantly with age in days since birth. The correlation\nbetween IgA and FEC in lambs aged 4 months\nremained negative after correcting IgA for age in\ndays since birth (partial correlationflfi0\u2013125, Pfl\n0\u2013018). FEC, IgA and weight were not correlated in\nsheep measured at 16 months of age.

At both\nages, the 126 allele at the o(IFN)-c locus was\nsignificantly associated with reduced FEC. This\neffect is illustrated in Fig. 3 and is more strongly\nevident in yearlings. In lambs, 126}126 homozygotes\nhave on average 9\u20134% lower FEC than 130}130\nhomozygotes; in yearlings the difference is 31\u20132%\n(Fig. 3). Alleles at the 2 flanking loci did not show\nsignificant association with FEC at either age (Table\n5). The maternal o(IFN)-c genotype did not explain\nsignificant variation in FEC at either age when\nfitted in either reduced model containing the off-\nspring genetic term (4 months: Nfl620, Pfl0\u201363;\n16 months: Nfl214, Pfl0\u201314).\nIgA titre was modelled assuming a normal error\nstructure following logarithmic transformation. At\n4 months of age IgA varied between years and was\npositively related to age in days since birth (Table\n6A). Twins also had significantly higher IgA titre\nthan singletons at 4 months. At 4 months of age, IgA\ntitre was significantly associated with alleles at\no(IFN)-c, with the 126 allele in positive association\nwith IgA titre (Fig. 4). At 16 months of age only year\nexplained significant variation in IgA (Table 6B);\nhowever, there was a trend for IgA to increase with\nthe number of 126 alleles at o(IFN)-c (Fig. 4). The\nmaternal o(IFN)-c genotype did not explain signifi-\ncant variation in IgA measured in lambs when fitted\neither as a main effect (Nfl304, Pfl0\u201393) or as an\ninteraction with lamb age (Pfl0\u201373).\nOver-winter survival was modelled assuming a\nbinomial error structure. Mean over-winter survival\naveraged over all cohorts was 58\u20139% for the first\nwinter and 81\u20134% for the second. Variation in\nsurvival was affected by year and weight over both\nintervals (Table 7). First winter survival was reduced\nin twins, and females were more likely to survive\ntheir second winter. Survival was clearly not\nassociated with alleles at any of the three loci\nconsidered (P\"0\u20135 for each locus).\ndiscussion\nFEC was significantly associated with alleles at the\no(IFN)-c microsatellite locus, and not with alleles at\nflanking markers, suggesting there to be a QTL\nassociated with reduced FEC segregating near the\n(IFN)-c gene in Soay sheep. This result inde-\npendently verifies the Crawford & McEwen\u2019s (1998)\nfindings in an unmanaged, naturally-parasitized\npopulation. Furthermore, our results indicate that\nthe o(IFN)-c\n\"#\u2019\nallele associated with reduced FEC\nis also significantly associated with increased titre of\nTeladorsagia-specific IgA in lambs independent of\nthe maternal genotype, and suggest an association at\n16 months. Clearly, more IgA data need to be\ncollected in order to resolve the association in older\nsheep further as the sample taken at 16 months of age\nwas small (Nfl101 individuals typed at all 3 loci)\nand probably lacked the statistical power to detect an\nassociation with IgA if one existed. However, it is\nD. W. Coltman and others 580\nalso possible that resistance to gastrointestinal para-\nsites is mediated by other mechanisms in older sheep\n(Stear, Strain & Bishop, 1999b).\nThe results from sheep aged 4 months merit\nspeculation that there may be a direct link between\ninterferon gamma expression, IgA production and\nresistance to nematode infection in young sheep.\nWhen FEC data were analysed in a GLM including\nboth IgA and o(IFN)-c\n\"#\u2019\nalleles, IgA titre explained\nsignificant variation (P!0\u20130001, accounting for\n3\u20131% of the total variance) when fitted before\no(IFN)-c\n\"#\u2019\n, which became non-significant (Pfl\n0\u2013077). This indicates that the effects of o(IFN)-c\nand IgA on FEC were not independent, and suggests\nthat the (IFN)-c effect on FEC may be mediated by\nIgA. Stear and coworkers (Stear, Strain & Bishop,\n1999a, b) have found that genetic variation in egg\noutput in lambs subjected to natural T. circumcincta\ninfection is caused by variation in worm length,\nwhich is controlled by the strength and molecular\nspecificity of the local IgA response against 4th-stage\nlarvae.\nExperimental evidence from other mammalian\nsystems illustrates the key role played by (IFN)-c in\nregulating the antibody response including IgA. In\nrat and mouse models, the Th\n#\ncell subset is\nprimarily responsible for orchestrating antibody\nresponses to helminth infection, and the activity of\nthis subset, which is down-regulated by the pro-\nduction of interferon gamma, dramatically increases\nduring the response to infection in resistant lines\n(Else & Finkelman, 1998; Ishikawa et al. 1998;\nStewart et al. 1999). However, susceptible strains of\nmice that fail to expel worms following deliberate\ninfection have a Th\n\"\ndominant subset as evidenced\nby a cytokine expression profile dominated by\n(IFN)-c (Else et al. 1994). In vivo depletion of\n(IFN)-c in the genetically susceptible lines then led\nto the expulsion of worms (Else et al. 1994).\nWe were surprised to find there to be no\nassociation between the putative resistance allele\no(IFN)-c\n\"#\u2019\nand over-winter survival probability in\neither age class. Our data set was of sufficient size to\ndetect such an effect (Nfl630 and 226) with\nreasonable power, and in the past we have found that\ngenetic factors associated with resistance were also\nassociated with increased survival using similar\nmethods (Coltman et al. 1999b ; Gulland et al. 1993;\nPaterson et al. 1998). We can speculate on 2 possible\nexplanations for this result. First, the (IFN)-c QTL\nmay affect worm fecundity without appreciably\ninfluencing the cost of the parasites to host survival.\nWhile Stear and coworkers (Stear et al. 1995, 1996,\n1997, 1999b) have shown that in domestic lambs\ngenetic variation for FEC is manifest as reduced\nadult female worm length, from our data it is not\npossible to determine whether the (IFN)-c QTL\nconfers reduced total parasite burden or cost.\nNonetheless, if the QTL were associated with a\nreduction in egg output, this is a still very desirable\ntrait from the epidemiological perspective as egg\noutput is the primary determinant of larval abun-\ndance in the pasture.\nAlternately, the QTL may provide a survival\nadvantage with respect to resistance to parasitic\nnematodes, yet also incur costs in other ways such as\nincreased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens.\nFor example, if the resistance QTL resulted from\nsuppressed (IFN)-c expression and enhanced Th\n#\nresponse, the same individual would be at greater\nrisk from infection by bacteria, fungi and viruses due\nto suppression of the Th\n\"\npathway, and could\nexperience type 1-like hypersensitivity (Pritchard,\nHewitt & Moqbel, 1997). In this case, if the fitness\nadvantage of an enhanced Th\n#\nresponse with respect\nto resistance to nematode was balanced by the cost of\nincreased susceptibility to microbial infection, then\nthe polymorphism could be maintained in the\npopulation by balancing selection or antagonistic\npleiotropy.\nWhile it is tempting to speculate that a functional\npolymorphism at the (IFN)-c gene leading to\ndifferential expression or sensitivity may be the\nsource of the QTL effect, we have no direct evidence\nto support this idea from this study. Future research\naimed at determining whether the marker allele is\nassociated with immunological parameters, such\ncytokine production in vivo (Finkelman & Morris,\n1999), is warranted. It is also possible that the effect\nmay be caused by another as yet uncharacterized\ngene in the vicinity of (IFN)-c. Finally, a frequent\ncriticism of association studies such as this one is that\nassociations between marker alleles and traits can\narise due to population structure or admixture. For\nexample, if family groups or clusters of related\nindividuals with different frequencies of marker\nalleles tended to graze pastures differing in the\nabundance of infective larvae, then an association\nbetween marker alleles and parasitism could arise\nwithout any immunogenetic basis. In this circum-\nstance we would expect associations to arise with the\nflanking marker loci equally frequently, or perhaps\nmore frequently due to their greater polymorphism.\nThis was not the case in this study for FEC, as only\no(IFN)-c showed significant associations. However,\nthe transmission disequilibrium (TD) test for quan-\ntitative traits offers a more powerful statistical\nprocedure that is resistant to confounding due to\npopulation structure (Allison, 1997; Rabinowitz,\n1997). TD tests require full pedigree knowledge and\nthe knowledge of the parental marker genotypes,\nhowever. We are currently expanding our o(IFN)-c\ntyping efforts to include both parents where known,\nas we have knowledge of many paternal links in the\npopulation through molecular paternity inference\n(Pemberton et al. 1999).\nThe findings of this study independently verify\nCrawford & McEwen\u2019s (1998) discovery of a QTL\nIFN gamma and parasite resistance in Soay sheep 581\nconferring resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes\nlocated near the (IFN)-c gene in domestic sheep.\nGiven the long separation time between the primitive\nSoay and the breeds in which the QTL was originally\ndetected (Romney and Merino), it is likely to be\nwidely spread among domestic sheep. While it is\npossible that the QTL is caused by a genetic\npolymorphism resulting in differential expression of\n(IFN)-c and subsequent modulation of the Th\n\"\n}Th\n#\nresponse, more data are needed to ascertain the\nimmunological basis of resistance associated with\nthis polymorphism.\nWe thank Alan Crawford for sharing his QTL findings\nwith us, and for encouraging the investigation of the\ninterferon gamma gene in our study system.
