The base of the Ediacaran Period is defined by the\ntermination of a globally extensive Marinoan glaciation, and its top by the base of the\nCambrian demarked by the first occurrence of Treptichnus pedum. The boundary is\nbroadly coincident with an extinction event and a distinctive negative \u000213C excursion\n(Amthor and others, 2003; Knoll and others, 2004). This interval of time contains a\nrecord of global biological and geochemical events, beginning with the origin and\ndiversification of the enigmatic Ediacaran soft-bodied biota (for example Narbonne,\n2005) and ending with the development and extinction of the first weakly calcified\nmetazoans (Germs, 1972; Grotzinger and others, 1995; Amthor and others, 2003).\nDuring the later part of the Ediacaran Period (approximately 578 \u2013 542 Ma) macro-\nscopic metazoan fossils appear in the rock record, which broadly coincides with one of\nthe most profound shifts of the carbon isotopic composition of seawater in Earth\nhistory (Burns and Matter, 1993; Workman and others, 2002; Condon and others,\n2005; Fike and others, 2006). Determining a detailed history of the Neoproterozoic is\ncrucial for understanding global-scale interactions between life and environment.\nThe Huqf Supergroup in the Sultanate of Oman captures a record of the middle\nto late Neoproterozoic, but until now has lacked detailed chronostratigraphic context.\nIt is well exposed in the Oman Mountains, Huqf and Mirbat areas (fig. 1) (McCarron,\nms, 2000; Leather and others, 2002; Cozzi and others, 2004a; Le Guerroue and others,\n2005) and also occurs in the subsurface where numerous boreholes penetrate Ediaca-\nran to Cambrian age strata (see for example Mattes and Conway Morris, 1990; Amthor\nand others, 2003). The Huqf Supergroup contains distinctive Neoproterozoic glacial\ndeposits and associated cap carbonate(s), which are overlain by thick siliciclastic and\ncarbonate shelf strata. These carbonates contain a dramatic carbon isotopic (\u000213C)\nexcursion of \u00016 permil, and are in turn overlain by evaporites and carbonates that\ncontain the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. Fossils include acritarchs preserved in the\nlower and middle Huqf (Butterfield, 2001) and the late Ediacaran index fossils\nCloudina and Namacalathus (Amthor and others, 2003), as well as biomarker evidence\nfor sponges in rocks inferred to be pre-Marinoan (Love and others, 2005).\nHuqf Supergroup strata also include zircon-bearing volcanic rocks, some of which\nwere dated previously (Brasier and others, 2000; Amthor and others, 2003). This\ncontribution is focused on providing high-precision temporal constraints on the\nNeoproterozoic of Oman by presenting new age data from its key stratigraphic levels,\nas well as revised and more precise ages for previously dated ash beds. In addition,\ndetrital zircon dates from siliciclastic lithologies provide maximum depositional age\nlimits for enclosing strata and help characterizing provenance. Considered collec-\ntively, the results bear significant implications on the timing of pre-Ediacaran glacia-\ntion cycles, as well as Ediacaran global biogeochemical and tectonic events.\ngeologic setting\nEarly Neoproterozoic (\u00031.0 Ga) crystalline basement of Oman is unconformably\noverlain by approximately 800 Ma, low-grade, rhyolitic volcanic and associated clastic\nrocks and strata of the Neoproterozoic to earliest Cambrian Huqf Supergroup (fig. 2)\n(Gorin and others, 1982; Clarke, 1988; Burns and Matter, 1993; Loosveld and others,\n1996; Brasier and others, 2000; Amthor and others, 2003).

The Huqf Supergroup\nis subdivided into three groups (fig. 2), which in ascending order are: the Abu Mahara\nGroup (glacial clastics); the Nafun Group, which is subdivided into the Hadash\n(cap-carbonate), Masirah Bay (shelf clastics), Khufai (peritidal cyclic carbonates), the\nShuram (storm-dominated shelf clastics and carbonates) and Buah (storm-dominated\nFig. 2. Lithostratigraphy of Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian rocks in Oman for each of the\ngeographic regions studied (see fig. 1) along with horizons represented by geochronology samples. The\nSOSB stratigraphic column is a composite of several wells with significant overlap (see figs. 8 and 10, and\nAmthor and others 2003).\n1100 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nshelf dolostones and limestones) formations; and the Ara Group (several carbonate\nplatforms interlayered with evaporites) (Gorin and others, 1982; Mattes and Conway\nMorris, 1990; Wright and others, 1990; Schroeder and others, 2005). In general, the\noutcrops constrain the Abu Mahara and Nafun groups, whereas cores, well logs, and\nseismic data provide constraints on the thickness and distribution of the Ara Group. In\noutcrops of the Oman Mountains the volcaniclastic Fara Formation overlies the Buah\nFormation and is generally considered time equivalent to the Ara Group. Strata of\npossible Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary age are known only from subsurface data\n(Amthor and others, 2003; Schroeder and others, 2005). In a few key wells on\nstructural highs both the Abu Mahara and Nafun groups were intercepted, thus\nproviding ties between the surface exposures and the subsurface (Mattes and Conway\nMorris, 1990; Cozzi and others, 2004a). The Huqf Supergroup preserves several\ndistinct stages of basin development, probably associated with different subsidence\nmechanisms. The Abu Mahara Group was deposited within localized fault bounded\nbasins, whereas the overlying Nafun Group is laterally extensive reflecting broad,\nregional subsidence. The Nafun Group-Ara Group boundary marks a shift from this\nregional subsidence to a tectonic style marked by uplift of large basement blocks that\nsegmented the broader basin into several fault-bounded sub-basins (Immerz and\nothers, 2000).\nThe Ara Group depositional patterns reflect segmentation of the Nafun basin into\nthree smaller-scale basins within the interior of Oman. This segmentation began at\nabout 550 to 548 Ma, and was accompanied by a shift to a more arid climate and\naccumulation of salts and carbonates. These basins include the South Oman Salt Basin\n(SOSB), the Ghaba Salt Basin, and the Fahud Salt Basin (fig. 1). Seismic data indicate\nthat the western margins of these basins are delineated by structurally complex\ntranspressional deformation fronts (Loosveld and others, 1996) of Ara age (late\nEdiacaran to earliest Cambrian). An upper age limit for deformation is provided by\nsediments that contain late Cambrian trilobites, derived from uplift and erosion of the\nwestern margin. A significant clastic wedge, represented by the Nimr Group, is derived\nfrom unroofing of the western margin (\u201cWestern Deformation Front\u201d, see fig. 1).\nClastic sediments of the uppermost Ara Group signal the onset of this event. In\ncontrast, the eastern margins of the salt basins are characterized by onlap and thinning\nof basin strata onto a structural high located close to the modern-day east coast of\nOman. Within the three salt basins, further segmentation occurred, with localized\nsubsidence related to basement-involved block faulting. Within the SOSB the uplifted\nblocks became sites of carbonate deposition, and down-faulted blocks were overlain\nwith black shale and silicilyte (Amthor and others, 2005). Evaporites blanketed both\nbasins and uplifted blocks. Interlayered carbonates and evaporites of the Ara Group\naccumulated within these sub-basins creating an ideal geologic setting for the genera-\ntion, trapping and long-term preservation of hydrocarbons (Al-Siyabi, 2005). The\nSOSB has long been recognized as a major hydrocarbon province (Morton, 1959),\nalthough it was not clear until the mid-1970\u2019s that the dominant source rock is of\nterminal Proterozoic age. Subsequent work demonstrated that this source rock charged\nnot only Proterozoic reservoirs, but also Paleozoic and Mesozoic reservoirs (Al-Marjeby\nand Nash, 1986).\nSeveral models have been invoked to explain the history of basin evolution and\nsubsidence recorded by the Huqf Supergroup. There is general agreement that the\nAbu Mahara (bimodal volcanic and clastic sedimentary rocks) accumulated within\naerially restricted basins related to regional extension (rifting), however interpretation\nof the Nafun and Ara groups is less certain. It has been suggested that the aerially\nextensive Nafun Group deposits reflect subsidence related to post-rift thermal contrac-\ntion of the lithosphere and creation of a passive continental margin (Allen and\nKapellos and others, 1992; Leather, 2006). Grotzinger and others (2002) interpret Abu\n1101chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nMahara subsidence to relate to regional extension but suggests that the broad, regional\nsubsidence represented by the Nafun Group is related to dynamic depression of the\nlithosphere associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the Arabian\nplate. Subduction is inferred to have occurred along the northeastern margin of\nGondwanaland (eastern Oman) where an Andean margin developed. Although\nsubsidence of the younger Ara Group is generally attributed to regional strike slip\nfaulting associated with Najd tectonism (Al-Husseini and Al-Husseini, 1990), in the\nsubduction model the Ara Group was deposited in troughs created by basement-\ninvolved uplift, analogous to the Laramide orogeny of the western U.S., or the Bolivian\nsegment of the Andes where flat slab subduction occurred. Retro-arc uplift and\ndesiccation may have helped produce the Ara evaporite deposits, and the numerous\nash beds of the Ara Group are likely airfall equivalents of contemporaneous arc\nmagmatism. Thick sequences of felsic volcanic rocks such as those represented by the\nFara Formation (Oman Mountains) and in the subsurface (Ghaba Salt Basin) are all\nbroadly consistent with subduction-related melting of the crust in a retroarc setting\n(Grotzinger and others, 2002). Given the structurally segmented nature of the basin\nand the increase in volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (relative to the underlying Nafun\nGroup), it is unlikely that the Ara Group records simple passive margin subsidence.\nAll tectonic models for the region are hampered by lack of exposures combined\nwith an incomplete understanding of the temporal evolution of the Huqf Supergroup.\nThe models outlined above make predictions concerning the stratigraphic continuity\nof certain units and the chronostratigraphic framework developed in this paper\nprovides a means to begin to assess such models. Determining the age and temporal\ndistribution of each of these units is the key to establishing a viable chronostratigraphic\nframework for the Huqf Supergroup.\nu-pb analytical procedures\nSamples collected for geochronological analyses were crushed using a combina-\ntion of jaw crusher and disc mill followed by washing in water to remove the bulk of the\nlow-density material. Heavy minerals were separated using standard heavy liquid and\nmagnetic techniques. Zircon grains were hand-selected for analysis from the least\nmagnetic fraction based on the absence of cracks, inclusions, and surface contamina-\ntion. In order to minimize the effects of Pb loss, the grains were subjected to either\nconventional mechanical air-abrasion (Krogh, 1982) or a version of the thermal\nannealing and acid leaching (also known as chemical abrasion or CA-TIMS) technique\nof Mattinson (2005) prior to isotope dilution thermal ionization mass-spectrometry\n(ID-TIMS) analyses using a mixed 205Pb-233U-235U tracer solution (spike). Details of\nzircon pre-treatment, dissolution and U and Pb chemical extraction procedures are\ndescribed in Ramezani and others (2007).\nU and Pb isotopic measurements were performed on a VG Sector-54 multi-\ncollector thermal ionization mass spectrometer at MIT. Pb and U were loaded together\non a single Re filament in a silica-gel\/phosphoric acid mixture (Gerstenberger and\nHaase, 1997). Pb isotopes were measured by peak-hopping using a single Daly\nphotomultiplier detector and U isotopic measurements were made in static mode\nusing multiple Faraday collectors. Mass fractionation for Daly measurements was\ndetermined to be 0.25 \u0004 0.04%\/amu over a wide temperature range based on\nlong-term measurements of the NBS-981 Pb standard. U mass fractionation was\ncalculated in real-time using a double spike. All common Pb was attributed to\nprocedural blank. A sensitivity test shows that the composition of the common Pb has\nno discernable effect on any of the calculated dates reported in this paper. U blanks\nwere \u00030.1 pg. Data reduction, age calculation, and the generation of concordia plots\nwere carried out using the algorithms of Ludwig (1980), and the statistical reduction\nand plotting program ISOPLOT (Ludwig, 1991).\n1102 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nThe data presented in this paper was accumulated over a period of about five years\nduring which our analytical protocols have been continuously improving. Most notably\nwe have adopted the chemical abrasion (CA-TIMS) technique (Mattinson, 2005), have\nparticipated in the initial stages of a community-based assessment of interlaboratory\nstandards as part of the EARTHTIME project (Condon, 2005), and have refined our\nU-Pb tracer calibration (Schoene and others, 2006). In cases where the highest\npossible precision is crucial and where we had sufficient sample material, older data\nwere supplemented with new analyses using the latest techniques.\nIn the past few years it has become evident that zircon which yields high-precision,\nstatistically equivalent data sets often exhibit slight age discordance (207Pb\/206Pb dates\nare a minimum of 0.2% older than the U-Pb dates), likely due to imprecision in one or\nboth of the U decay constants (Mattinson, 2000; see also a recent review in Schoene\nand others, 2006). In many previous studies of lower Paleozoic zircons plagued with Pb\nloss that is inferred to have occurred in geologically recent times, 207Pb\/206Pb dates\nhave been considered the best estimate for the age of a discordant population. In this\ncase, uncertainties in the decay constants could be ignored if the dates are not\ncompared with dates calculated using other chronometers. However, it now appears\nthat discordance related to radiation damage and Pb loss can very often be effectively\neliminated through the CA-TIMS technique (Mundil and others, 2004; Mattinson,\n2005; Schoene and others, 2006). A data set for a single population of zircons for which\nPb loss has been eliminated is manifested by a coherent cluster of data (equivalent in\nthe terminology of Ludwig, 1998), in which all the scatter can be accounted for by\nanalytical uncertainty. In these cases the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date is generally\nthe most precise and accurate and thus preferred for the purpose of fine-scale\nstratigraphic correlation, as well as calculating rates and\/or durations of sediment\naccumulation. For some samples, equivalent data sets were not obtained and we\ninstead rely on either the 207Pb\/206Pb or the upper concordia intercept date as the best\nestimate of age. Errors for U-Pb dates are reported in the following format:\u0004X(Y)[Z],\nwhere X is the internal or analytical uncertainty in the absence of all systematic error\n(tracer calibration and decay constants), Y includes the tracer calibration error (using\na conservative estimate of the 2\u0005 standard deviation of 0.05% for the Pb\/U ratio in the\ntracer), and Z includes the additional decay constant errors of Jaffey and others\n(1971). For 207Pb\/206Pb dates, tracer calibration errors are negligible and Y is not\nreported (so it reads \u0004 X[Z]). The MSWD (mean square of the weighted deviates:\nYork, 1967, 1969) of the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date is calculated prior to the\naddition of systematic uncertainties. All data are presented in Appendix 1, concordia\nplots for selected samples are shown in figures 3 and 4, and calculated dates and\nassociated uncertainties for critical samples are summarized in table 1. When consider-\ning relative ages of different samples (for example when determining sediment\naccumulation rates) it is crucial to use dates calculated using a single decay scheme, in\nwhich case decay constant uncertainties can be effectively ignored. Alternatively, the\ndecay constant uncertainties must be taken into account for each of the dates being\ncompared.\nIn this study we present a large number of U-Pb dates for single detrital zircons\nseparated from a number of lithologies. Some were collected as possible volcanic\nashes, whereas others were intentionally sampled to examine provenance. The detrital\ndates provide maximum age constraints on the depositional age, in addition to\nproviding information on the age of the source terrains supplying detritus. Although\npre-treatment techniques (air abrasion and CA-TIMS) were employed to minimize the\neffects of Pb loss, detailed studies of certain samples (such as WM 54, see below)\ndemonstrate the difficulty in completely eliminating it for certain zircons. Thus, for\ndetrital zircons the 207Pb\/206Pb date provides the best estimate for the age of the\nzircon and avoids the potential problem of underestimation (by potentially many tens\n1103chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nof millions of years) when utilizing the 206Pb\/238U age for zircons that have suffered Pb\nloss. While potentially confusing to the non-geochronologist, the main point of this\ndiscussion is that one needs to know the type of U-Pb date being reported before it can\nbe compared with either other U-Pb dates or dates derived from other chronometers.\nSomewhat paradoxically, this state-of-affairs is a direct result of our ability to make\nincreasingly more precise analyses; as recent as five years ago this level of resolution was\nnot possible.\nTwo other analytical techniques are often employed for detrital zircon geochronol-\nogy, laser-ablation ICPMS and ion microprobe (SIMS). While these techniques are\nable to produce a large amount of data in relatively short periods of time, they do so\nwith much less precision than ID-TIMS. However, these techniques are particularly\nuseful for establishing a spectrum of detrital dates in order to fingerprint provenance.\nFig. 3.

Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nEven the most precise 206Pb\/238U LA-ICPMS and ion-microprobe dates are often\ncharacterized by one-sigma errors of 1 to 2 percent making the detection of Pb loss and\nsubtle inheritance difficult at best. In general, for Neoproterozoic age rocks, these\nin-situ techniques rely on the highest precision 206Pb\/238U dates as the best estimate of\nthe age of the grain. It is therefore worth noting that between relative imprecision and\nthe inability to detect subtle Pb loss, it is possible that dates are often younger than the\ntrue zircon crystallization age (see for example Zhang and others, 2005).\nlithostratigraphic and geochronologic constraints\nIn the following section we present new U-Pb zircon geochronologic data from the\nigneous\/metamorphic basement, the overlying Abu Mahara Group, Nafun Group and\nAra Group of Oman. These data are used to constrain depositional ages, as well as to\ncharacterize source regions for detrital zircons.\nBasement Rocks\nThere are three outcrop areas in Oman where crystalline basement and overlying\nNeoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are exposed. The two most prominent localities are\nAl Jobah in the Huqf-Haushi outcrop belt of east-central Oman and in the Mirbat area\nof southern Oman near Salalah (fig. 1). At Al Jobah approximately 35 meters of felsic\nvolcanic and shallow marine sedimentary rocks of the Halfayn Formation (Dubreuilh\nand others, 1992) overlie penetratively deformed granodioritic rocks. The felsic\nvolcanic rocks have been correlated with the Ghadir Manquil Formation of the Oman\nMountains (Bell, 1993; Pilcher and Buckley, 1995), as well as with trachytic volcanic\nrocks recovered from a core in the Khufai Dome of the Huqf outcrop belt. Previous\ngeochronologic data including a K-Ar date of 654 \u0004 12 Ma on the trachytic volcanic\nrocks (Gorin and others, 1982) and a Rb-Sr whole-rock date of 562 \u0004 42 Ma\n(Dubreuilh and others, 1992) on samples of rhyolite from the Halfayn Formation\nimplied that the overlying sedimentary rocks were much younger. Our U-Pb zircon\nresults show a limited range for dates from both granodioritic basement and the\noverlying felsic volcanic rocks and indicate that both are considerably older than\nearlier estimates.\nZircon from five samples from the Al Jobah area, including two of the underlying\ngranodioritic basement (AJD2 and ADJ5), two of felsic volcanic rocks (AJD1 and AJD3)\nin the Halfyayn Formation, and a sedimentary breccia (AJD4), were analyzed. Samples\nof the Al Jobah granodiorite (AJD2 and ADJ5) yielded large, euhedral zircons that\nscatter near the concordia curve (Appendix table 1). The data are consistent with\nminor amounts of inheritance of slightly older zircon combined with Pb loss. The\nyoungest grains have 207Pb\/206Pb dates at approximately 824 Ma which we interpret as\nthe best estimate of the age of the intrusion. Four zircons were analyzed from sample\nAJD1, a light-green rhyolitic ignimbrite with well-preserved primary volcanic textures.\n207Pb\/206Pb dates range from about 823 to 850 Ma indicating the predominance of\nxenocrystic grains in the sampled population. Zircons from this sample are indistin-\nguishable from the underlying basement, but given the combined effects of Pb loss and\ninheritance it is difficult to precisely estimate the eruptive age. Four zircons were\nanalyzed from a sample of a red rhyolitic ash-flow tuff (AJD3) stratigraphically below\nAJD1 and, like AJD1, there is evidence for inheritance of older zircons from the\nbasement. AJD4 is a sample of light-gray volcaniclastic and calcareous breccia and\nconglomerate stratigraphically above AJD1. The four zircons analyzed in AJD4 yielded\n207Pb\/206Pb dates that range in age from 827 Ma to 840 Ma, older than the underlying\nrhyolites. All samples have variably complex U-Pb systematics that preclude precise age\ndetermination, however the data strongly suggests that these non-deformed, low-grade\nrocks are approximately 823 Ma and slightly older.\nPrevious geochronological investigations of basement in the Mirbat region re-\nsulted in a Rb-Sr \u2018isochron\u2019 age of 554 \u0004 10 Ma from a combination of samples from\n1107chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nboth granodioritic dikes and an unfoliated alkaline (Leger) granite cutting 800\u0006 Ma\nold basement (Platel and others, 1992). This \u2018isochron\u2019 age led to the inference that\nthe overlying Mirbat Formation was younger than roughly 550 Ma. However, between\nthe fact that unrelated samples were combined to calculate an isochron and consider-\nation of the emerging Neoproterozoic chronostratigraphic framework, this young age\nwas thought anomalous and these rocks were targeted for U-Pb geochronology.\nA sample of a pegmatitic granitic vein (P69) was collected at Mirbat where the Ayn\nMember of the Mirbat formation rests unconformably on deformed, foliated gneissic\nbasement. This foliated gneiss has been dated at approximately 815 Ma (Mercolli and\nothers, 2006). Sample P69 occurs about 3 meters below the contact, where sub-vertical\nlight pink pegmatite veins, striking E-W, cross-cut an older foliated gneissic unit and\nare in turn truncated by the sub-Ayn unconformity. Five zircons were analyzed and\nyield a weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 811.3 \u0004 0.6[1.7] Ma (MSWD \u0007 0.17),\nsimilar in age to basement samples dated in the north, indicating a magmatic link\nbetween the basement exposures in the north and Mirbat.\nThe Leger granite is a non-foliated granite that cross-cuts the older basement and\nis unconformably overlain by Cretaceous carbonates. It is inferred to have also been\ntruncated by the Mirbat Formation, which pinches out before reaching the Leger\ngranite (Wuersten and others, 1991). Nine single grains of zircon were analyzed (five\nair-abraded and four CA-TIMS) from a sample of the Leger granite (Salalah 13) and\nyield a weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 730.2\u0004 1.0[2.0] Ma (n\u0007 7, MSWD\u0007 1.2),\nwith the four most concordant analyses (all CA-TIMS) yielding a weighted mean\n206Pb\/238U age of 726.1 \u0004 0.4(0.5)[1.3] Ma (MSWD \u0007 0.79) (Appendix table 1 and\ntable 1). We interpret these data as the crystallization age of the granite. Since the\nMirbat Formation glacial deposits have no observable contact with this granite, it is not\nclear whether it is a stratigraphic or intrusive relationship. Therefore, this age cannot\nbe used to constrain the age of the Ayn glacials.\nThese samples give us a glimpse into the age of the low-grade arc basement to the\nHuqf Supergroup in this region which is based on the age of the granodiorite, volcanic\nand inherited zircons in the rhyolites, and the detrital zircons in the volcaniclastic\nsedimentary rocks. As is discussed below, clasts of felsic porphyries from diamictites\nnear Mirbat, as well as detrital zircons from clastic rocks throughout the sections yield\nabundant zircons in this age range, again suggesting widespread distribution of these\nfelsic volcanic rocks.\nAbu Mahara Group and Correlatives\nThe glaciogenic Abu Mahara Group is known principally from the Oman Moun-\ntains in north Oman (fig. 1). It also has been intercepted in several subsurface wells in\ncentral Oman. In south Oman the Abu Mahara Group is thought to correlate with the\nMirbat Formation.\nMirbat Formation.\u2014Glacial diamictites are found in south Oman in the Mirbat\nregion east of Salalah (fig. 1), where they form part of a \u00031 km-thick succession\noverlying a complex igneous and metamorphic basement (Lees, 1928; Kellerhals and\nMatter, 2003). The glacially influenced Mirbat Formation has been correlated with the\nAbu Mahara Group in the Huqf and Jabal Akhdar regions (Loosveld and others, 1996).\nThe Mirbat Formation consists of three members known as Ayn (Lower, \u0001400 m\nthick), Arkahawl (Middle, \u0001300 m thick) and Marsham (Upper, \u0003300m thick).\nGlaciogenic lithologies are found principally in the Lower (Ayn) Member (Kellerhals\nand Matter, 2003), where they dominate the stratigraphy. Clasts in the Ayn diamictite\nare composed of felsic porphry, granite, and rhyolite, but dominated by rhyolites with\ncentimeter-sized feldspar phenocrysts, similar to the Halfyn volcanic rocks in the Huqf\narea. The glaciogenic Ayn Member is locally overlain by a very thin (\u000330 cm),\nclastic-textured, silty limestone, or by a \u00031 m-thick, stromatolitic limestone character-\nized by light carbon isotopic composition (-4\u2030), interpreted to represent a poorly\n1108 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\ndeveloped \u2018cap\u2019 carbonate (Kellerhals and Matter, 2003). In other locations, the\ncarbonate is entirely missing.\nIn an attempt to constrain the maximum age of the basal Ayn Member, sample\nP70 was collected about 2 meters above the unconformity, where the Ayn Member\nconsists of coarse, cross-bedded sandstone with intercalated finer-grained silty lenses.\nSample P72 represents some of this finer-grained silty material. Two zircon grains from\nsample P70 are nearly concordant with 207Pb\/206Pb dates of 747 \u0004 2 Ma and 749 \u0004 2\nMa; the rest of the zircons range from 777 Ma to 832 Ma again consistent with\nderivation from the basement rocks. Sample P72 has two grains at 828 and 844 Ma. The\ndetrital zircon suite from P70 and P72 are consistent with local derivation, however the\ntwo youngest grains indicate that sediment accumulation did not begin until after\nabout 747 Ma and provide a maximum for the age of the overlying glacial deposits.\nRieu and others (2006) refer to unpublished U-Pb data from detrital zircons near\nthe base of the lower member of the Ayn Formation as indicating a maximum\ndepositional age of 722\u0004 12 Ma, although no analytical details are presented. Figure 2\nof Rieu and others (2006) indicate that the detrital zircon dates are from within the\nlowermost diamictites. This is at least circumstantial evidence that the diamictites of\nthe lower Ayn Formation are best correlated with the Ghubrah. Two rhyolite clasts\nwere sampled from the diamictites of the upper part of the Ayn Member near Mirbat\n(sample OM-01-05 and Salalah 11). The diamictite is dominated by unfoliated clasts of\nrhyolite porphyry from a stratigraphic level about 20 meters below the possible cap\ncarbonate. Three zircons were analyzed; the systematics are complex but similar to the\nsamples from the Huqf Area where granites and rhyolites from the basement yield\nsimilar results. Two of the analyzed zircons (z1 and z2) from sample OM-01-05 overlap\nwithin uncertainties and indicate a 207Pb\/206Pb date of 810 \u0004 2 Ma. Salalah 11 is a\nsample of a non-deformed, rhyolite porphyry clast (5 cm in diameter) that was\ncollected from the lower part of the diamictite. We have dated 3 zircons from this\nsample and although they have some scatter as a result of inheritance, they indicate a\n207Pb\/206Pb date of about 800 Ma, essentially the same as OM-01-05. In addition, the\ndates and discordance patterns are similar to those obtained from granites and\nrhyolites from the Huqf (Al Jobah) area. It should be noted that these dated clasts are\nidentical to ones used in Rb-Sr studies that were interpreted to indicate a much\nyounger age (approximately 560 Ma) for this sequence of rocks (A. Matter, personal\ncommunication).\nGhubrah Formation.\u2014The Abu Mahara Group is exposed in the Jabal Akhdar\nregion (fig. 1) and comprises three distinct lithostratigraphic units: the glaciogenic\nGhubrah Formation, which is unconformably overlain by the volcanogenic Saqlah\nFormation, which itself is overlain by the glaciogenic Fiq Formation (Rabu, 1993; Le\nGuerroue and others, 2005) (fig. 2). The presence of an angular unconformity\nbetween the Ghubrah Formation and overlying Saqlah Formation suggests a hiatus\nbetween the earlier glaciation (Ghubrah Formation) and subsequent volcanism (Saqlah\nFormation) and glaciation (Fiq Formation).\nOutcrops of the Ghubrah Formation are limited to the Jabal Akhdar region in the\nOman Mountains (Leather and others, 2002). A tuffaceous sandstone from the\nGhubrah Formation, approximately 200 m below the Saqlah Member in Wadi Mistal,\nyielded a U-Pb zircon upper intercept age of 723 \u000616\/-10 Ma (Brasier and others,\n2000). Resampling (sample WM 54) and analysis of zircons from the same bed was\nundertaken in order to increase the precision of the published date and to evaluate the\nnature of the zircon population. The rock yielded a zircon population of uniform color\nand size with well-developed crystal forms indicating little or no evidence for mixing\nand reworking (Brasier and others, 2000). Nevertheless, even though this unit is a\ndistinctive, uniform layer within the diamictite, we stress that it is a clastic rock and\ncould contain a still younger population of zircons. A total of twenty-four single grain\n1109chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nzircons were analyzed following the analytical procedures outlined above. A subset of\ntwenty-one zircons from this sample define a discordia with an upper intercept of\n714.2 \u0004 0.6[5.0] Ma and a lower intercept of 46 \u0004 15 Ma (MSWD \u0007 1.04) (fig. 3). A\nsubset of five analyses defines a cluster of equivalent points at the upper end of the\ndiscordia array. These five analyses yield a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 711.52\u0004\n0.20(0.31)[1.09] Ma (MSWD \u0007 0.18). The 206Pb\/238U date is about 0.4 percent\nyounger than the 207Pb\/206Pb date, consistent with the results from Schoene and\nothers (2006) for the difference in the two U decay schemes (that is, the discordance is\nnot an artefact of Pb loss), indicating that chemical abrasion has effectively eliminated\nPb loss. The remaining three analyses are variably discordant with older 207Pb\/206Pb\nages indicating a small xenocrystic component. Although the upper intercept age of\n714.2 \u0004 0.6 Ma is younger than the previously attained upper intercept date of 723\n\u000616\/-10 Ma, there is an overlap when the uncertainties are considered. We suggest\nthat the most concordant zircon analysis reported in Brasier and others (2000) most\nlikely reflects a minor xenocrystic component combined with Pb loss and thus biased\nthe upper intercept date. Our data set of twenty four single-crystal analyses indicates a\nminor component (about 15%) of older crystals. However, given the uniform nature of\nboth the age (discounting the effect of post-depositional Pb loss) and morphology of\nthe crystals we believe this to represent a population of volcanic zircons and that the\nU-Pb dates are the best estimate for the depositional age of the tuffaceous graywacke.\nThis interpretation can be evaluated by dating zircons obtained from adjacent\nstrata composed of obviously detrital facies. A sample of a sandstone clast in the\ndiamictite (WM.01.02) immediately above the tuffaceous graywacke and a sample of\ndiamictite matrix (WM.01.03) were collected to examine the detrital population and\nto see if they were significantly different from the tuffaceous graywacke. Five zircon\ngrains were analyzed for the sandstone clast and range in age from 815 to 828 Ma\nconsistent with derivation from the basement and distinctly different from the 713 Ma\ngrains from the volcaniclastic rock (WM 54). The sandstone matrix yielded a popula-\ntion (n \u0007 4) with 207Pb\/206Pb dates at 756 Ma. Interestingly, these grains are younger\nthan exposed and dated basement rocks, and therefore could be derived from\nrift-related magmatic rocks.\nIn summary, although there are limited exposures of \u201cbasement\u201d in Oman, they\nprovide important constraints on the maximum age of the overlying Huqf Supergroup\nand point to a major gap in the record perhaps related to unroofing and erosion some\ntime between approximately 800 and 713 Ma. Detrital zircon suites show prominent\npeaks at about 800 Ma consistent with derivation from the volcano-plutonic complex\nexposed in northern Oman. The age of the Ayn glacial deposit must be younger than\napproximately 750 Ma and perhaps younger than 722 \u0004 11 Ma (Rieu and others,\n2006), and the Ghubrah Formation is constrained at about 713 Ma although the\nduration of diamictite accumulation remains unconstrained. As the relationship\nbetween the Leger Granite and the Ayn Member cannot be directly observed its age\ncannot be used as a constraint on the timing of glacial sediment accumulation.\nImportantly, these results (ages of diamictite clasts and Leger granite) indicate the\nroughly 550 Ma Rb-Sr \u201cisochron\u201d constructed from a mixture of samples from the\nLeger granite diamictite clasts represents a mixing line with no geochronological\nsignificance.\nSaqlah, Fiq and Hadash Formations.\u2014The Saqlah Formation comprises mafic volca-\nnics and volcaniclastic sandstones with local accumulations of pillow basalts (Le\nGuerroue and others, 2005). The overlying Fiq Formation consists of a heterolithic\nsuite of glaciomarine sediments (Leather and others, 2002; Allen and others, 2004)\nthat are in turn overlain by the transgressive cap carbonate Hadash Formation.\nNegative \u000213C values (\u0001-6 to -2\u2030) from the Hadash Formation (Leather and others,\n2002), combined with the occurrence of pseudo-tepee structures, are characteristic of\n1110 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nother Marinoan-type cap carbonates (Kennedy and others, 1998; Hoffman and Schrag,\n2002; Allen and Hoffman, 2005; Halverson and others, 2005).\nDetrital zircons were analyzed in an attempt to better constrain the age of the\nSaqlah (SQ01) and Fiq Formations (FIQ2). Sample SQ01, was collected at Wadi Mistal\n(Oman Mountains, fig. 1), from approximately 20 meters above the base of the Saqlah\ndirectly below a basalt interval. Sample FIQ2 was a siliciclastic lithology collected from\nthe overlying Fiq Formation. Seven zircons were analyzed from SQ01, three grains\nyield 207Pb\/206Pb dates of about 750 Ma, the remaining four grains at approximately\n800 to 830 Ma (Appendix table 1, fig. 5). Twelve single grains were analyzed from\nsample FIQ2 and the 207Pb\/206Pb dates obtained were: one grain at about 920 Ma, ten\nFig. 5. Probability distribution function (PDF) plots of detrital zircon analyses.\n1111chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\ngrains were in the range 810 to 860 Ma and one grain yielded an approximately 664 Ma\nage (Appendix table 1, fig. 5).\nTwo samples of possible volcanic ash (WM.01.05 and WM.01.06) were collected\nfrom the Saqlah Formation and zircons analyzed. Three grains were analyzed from\nsample WM.01.05 (approximately 782 Ma, 786 Ma, and 826 Ma) whereas six grains\nwere analyzed from sample WM.01.06 (approximately 750 Ma, 752 Ma, 756 Ma, 792\nMa, 800 Ma and 818 Ma). These zircons have ages similar to that of the underlying\ndiamictite indicating that they most likely reflect reworking and inheritance of\nmaterial during deposition.\nGlacial deposits of the Lahan-1 well.\u2014The Lahan-1 well was drilled in 2003 along the\nsouthwest margin of the SOSB (fig. 1) to a depth of 6032 m (fig. 6). At 3910 m depth\nFig. 6. Lithostratigraphy and carbon isotopic variability of cored intervals along the Lahan-1 well.\nDepths are meters along hole below derrick floor.\n1112 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\n(along hole below derrick floor) the well intercepted a seismically defined regionally\nextensive angular unconformity at the base of the Haima Supergroup, composed of\nMiddle Cambrian to Silurian siliciclastic facies (Fortey, 1994; Millson and others,\n1996). Strata intercepted beneath the unconformity belong to the late Neoproterozoic\nNafun and Abu Mahara groups, comprising a large anticline detached at a depth of\n5760 m above flat-lying evaporites and fossiliferous carbonates of the Ara Group.\nThrust faulting is constrained to be Early Cambrian in age, most likely associated\nwith convergence along the western margin of the basin (Immerz and others, 2000;\nGrotzinger and others, 2002). Abu Mahara strata may be imbricated as suggested by\nthe fault at 5204 m depth, revealed through the analysis of borehole dip meter\ndata. However, above this level, dip meter data provide no evidence for structural\nrepetition.\nDuring drilling of the well, one 10 cm diameter core and two 7.5 cm diameter\ncores were obtained ranging in length from 6 to 27 m. The deepest core (5830 to\n5848 m; fig. 6) intercepted fractured and dolomitized platform carbonates of the Ara\nGroup containing both Cloudina and Namacalathus. These fossils are known only from\nstrata of approximately 548 to 542 Ma in age (Grant, 1990; Grotzinger, 2000; Amthor\nand others, 2003). These strata, in addition to overlying anhydrites, are interpreted as\nthe autochthonous footwall. Above the detachment, shales alternate with thick inter-\nvals of diamictite as shown by high-resolution borehole image data. A second core was\nobtained near the base of the thickest of these diamictites at a depth of 5123 to 5129 m\n(fig. 6). This core reveals a continuous interval of massive, matrix-supported diamictite\n(fig. 7A). The broad range of grain size, poor sorting, matrix-supported texture, and\ncommon occurrence of fractured or angular clasts is consistent with a glaciogenic\norigin.\nThe shallowest core is the longest (4271 \u2013 4298 m; fig. 6) and straddles the facies\nboundary at 4276.2 m between dropstone-bearing, fine-grained dominantly siliciclastic\nfacies and abruptly overlying cap dolostone facies. The siliciclastic facies (22 m\npreserved in core) include shales, laminated siltstones, pebbly shales and siltstones,\nlonestone-bearing laminated siltstones (fig. 7B), rare m-thick laminated dolostone\nbeds, and several thin green colored volcanic ash and siltstone layers (fig. 7C). The\ncarbonate facies (5 m preserved in core) include basal fine dolostones with scattered\nbarite laths and pervasive framboidal pyrite, which pass upward into crudely laminated\nfine dolostones. The lower few meters of the carbonate unit exhibit an early diagenetic\noverprint of spar-filled sheet cracks; this overprint diminishes upward so that overlying\ncarbonates are unbrecciated. The carbonates were sampled every 20 cm for their\ncarbon isotopic content, which reveals a set of moderately negative values of \u20132 to \u20134.5\npermil. The facies, diagenetic textures and isotopic content of these dolostones are all\ncompatible with the unique attributes of other carbonates that cap Marinoan-type\nNeoproterozoic glacial successions globally (Kennedy, 1996; Hoffman and others,\n1998; Hoffman and Schrag, 2002). These carbonates are correlated with the Hadash\ncap carbonate in the Jabal Akhdar area.\nThin (3 to 5 mm thick), fine-grained, green colored volcanic ash or siltstone layers\n(fig. 7C) occur at a depth of 4285 m to 4284.18 m, just 9 m below the cap dolostone,\nwithin the succession of shales and siltstones containing dropstones. U-Pb dating of\nzircons separated from one of these horizons yield a range of dates from approximately\n718 Ma to 645 Ma, however there is significant scatter within this population (Appen-\ndix table 1). The earliest analyses (z1, z7 and z4) have relatively low radiogenic\/\ncommon Pb ratios in part because of the very small size they were not abraded prior\nto analysis. Subsequent analyses utilizing the CA-TIMS approach are more precise,\nnonetheless all of the analyses indicate groupings at 715 to 718 Ma, one at 675 Ma\nand another at about 645 Ma. Although these thin horizons were sampled as\npotential volcanic ash beds, the scatter in the dataset and small number of \u2018young\u2019\n1113chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\ngrains (n \u0007 5) means that assigning a depositional age to this interval is not\nstraightforward: if they are primary volcanic zircons the approximately 645 Ma\npopulation represents the depositional age. Alternatively, even the youngest zir-\ncons could be detrital or xenocrystic, providing a maximum age constraint of about\n645 Ma. At present we consider the 645 Ma age as a maximum age for the Lahan-1\nglacial unit at this stratigraphic level.\nWhen the geochronological data from Lahan-1 is combined with the youngest age\nof detrital zircons in the Fiq Formation in the Jabal Akhdar region (664 Ma), it strongly\nFig. 7.

Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nsuggests that the Fiq glacial deposits were widespread across Oman, and that the age of\nglacial deposition is 645 Ma or younger and consistent with a Marinoan assignment. In\nthe subsurface, several other wells (Ghadir Manquil-1, Miqrat-1, Thamoud-6) intercept\ndiamictites, overlain by thin capping carbonates, which in turn are overlain by\ncharacteristic Nafun Group units (see below). These new results suggest that these\nglacial deposits are also of Fiq age, and that numerous extensional basins were filled\nwith glaciogenic strata.\nNafun Group\nNo volcanic lithologies suitable for dating have been observed in the Nafun Group\nrocks despite extensive examination of outcrops and material from the sub-surface. In\norder to better constrain the age of the Shuram Formation, detrital zircons were\nanalyzed (sample WB.01.8) with the objective of identifying the youngest grains, which\nwould constrain the maximum age of the horizon sampled. Nine single grains were\nanalyzed from siltstones collected from a shale-rich horizon about 5 meters above the\nbase of the Shuram Formation in the Jabal Akhdar. One grain yielded a date of\napproximately 2 Ga, six grains ranged between 830 and 860 Ma and two grains yielded\ndates of about 620 Ma (fig. 5). The two youngest grains provide a maximum age\nconstraint for the Shuram Formation at the horizon sampled. In addition, four zircons\nwere analyzed from a sample of the Buah Formation (sample WB.01.6), two of which\nyielded ages of about 780 Ma, the other two about 1.6 Ga.\nAra Group\nThe Ara Group represents at least six (A1-A6) 3rd-order cycles of carbonate\/\nevaporite sedimentation in a tectonically active basin (Mattes and Conway Morris,\n1990) in addition to a basal, pre-evaporitic carbonate (A0). The Precambrian-\nCambrian boundary is interpreted to occur within the A4 cycle, at the base of the A4\ncarbonate unit. Carbonates occupy positions within the basin center (in addition to\nflanks) and vary in thickness from 50 to 200 m. They formed during relative highstands\nin sea level characterized by mostly unrestricted conditions, exemplified by biohermal\nfacies containing Cloudina and Namacalathus body fossils. Carbonate platforms were\nformed during transgressive to highstand accommodation conditions, superimposed\nupon a progressive, long-term accommodation increase that forced platforms within\neach cycle to occupy progressively less area (Grotzinger and Amthor, 2002; Schroeder\nand others, 2005). Platform facies include microbial boundstones, intraclast-peloid-\nooid grainstone-packstone, and mudstone. These pass laterally into thrombolite sheet\nand mound facies, which pass downslope into turbiditic mudstones that interfinger\nwith deep-water microbial laminites in the most distal settings (Schroeder and others,\n2005). Deposition of overlying thick and laterally extensive basin-center evaporites\noccurred during drawdown and low stands in sea level. Ara evaporites include 10 to\n20 m thick anhydrites, and 100\u2019s of meters thick halite and potash salts (Mattes and\nConway Morris, 1990). Toward the eastern flank of the Ara salt basin, the basin-center\nevaporites pinch out. The Ara evaporites do not occur as basin-filling wedges onlap-\nping basin margin carbonates, but blanket the isolated carbonate platforms. This\nrequires that evaporite deposition occurred during strong tectonic subsidence, creat-\ning enough accommodation space so that low stand evaporites could overlap earlier\nhigh stand carbonates (Grotzinger and Amthor, 2002).\nIn an attempt to further refine and expand upon the ages of the Ara Group\nvolcanic ash beds (upper A3C and lower A4C) published in Amthor and others (2003)\nwe applied the CA-TIMS technique to additional zircons recovered from samples\nMKZ-11B (upper A3C) and BB-5 (lower A4C). In addition, we collected ash beds from\ntwo stratigraphic levels lower in the Ara Group; Minha-1A in the lower part of the A3\ncarbonate, and Asala-1c21 in the middle of the lowermost A0 unit (fig. 8).\n1115chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nFig. 8.

Carbon isotope data are from Amthor and others (2003)\nand represent a composite of data from three wells: A0C to A3C, Sabsab-1; A4C, Birba-5; A5C, Birba North-1.\nThe sharp negative \u000213C anomaly (base of A4C) is interpreted as being correlative with the Ediacaran-\nCambrian boundary.\n1116 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nTwelve single zircons were analyzed from sample Asala-1c21 the lowermost unit of\nthe Ara Group. The sample was collected from the middle of the A0 unit, which is\napproximately 60 to 70 meters thick and consists of shaly and tuffaceous carbonates,\nand unconformably overlies the Buah Formation. Eight new analyses employing the\nCA-TIMS technique resulted in a well defined cluster of equivalent analyses with a\nweighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 546.72 \u0004 0.21(0.29)[0.89] Ma (n \u0007 8, MSWD \u0007\n0.92) and a weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 548.90 \u0004 0.98[1.7] Ma (n \u0007 10,\nMSWD \u0007 0.63) (fig. 4 and table 1). This ash occurs within the A0 unit and therefore\nclosely constrains the age of the basal Ara Group. The age of Asala-1c21 provides a\nconstraint on the age of the \u0001\u00064\u2030 \u000213C peak reached following the Shuram\nexcursion (fig. 8), and occurs just above the zero crossing following the end of the\u00064\npermil excursion (fig. 9). An ash bed with a similar chemostratigraphic context occurs\nwithin the Nama Group (sample 94-N-10B: Grotzinger and others, 1995); however it\noccurs within the falling limb of the \u00064 permil excursion and therefore we would\nexpect it be slightly older than Asala-1c21. In order to test the correlation of the \u000213C\nisotopic excursion between Oman and Namibia, we analyzed additional zircons from\n94-N-10B (Lower Hoogland Member, Nama Group) using the CA-TIMS method in\norder to improve upon the precision. Eight single zircon crystals define a cluster of\nequivalent analyses with a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 547.36\u0004 0.23(0.31)[0.91]\nMa (n \u0007 8, MSWD \u0007 1.4). A slightly larger group of analyses yield a weighted mean\n207Pb\/206Pb date of 549.3 \u0004 0.8[1.6] Ma (n \u0007 12, MSWD \u0007 2.2) (fig. 4). Grotzinger\nand others (1995) reported a weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 548.8 \u0004 0.3 Ma\n(MSWD \u0007 0.08) using a combination of discordant multi- and single-grain analyses\nfrom the same mineral separate. The consistency of the geochronological results for\nAsala-1c21 and 94-N-10B in terms of their predicted relative stratigraphic positions and\nchemostratigraphic context indicates that these Late Neoproterozoic \u000213C fluctuations\nreflect globally synchronous variations in seawater chemistry (fig. 9) and that the drop\nfrom\u00064 to 0 permil occurred in less than 1 million years.\nSample Minha-1A was collected 3 meters above the base of the A3 carbonate unit\nwhich itself is approximately 100 to 125 meters thick. Seventeen single zircons (all\nCA-TIMS analyses) were analyzed from this sample, three were distinctly xenocrystic,\nbut the remaining fourteen yielded a207Pb\/206Pb weighted mean date of 544.4 \u0004\n0.5[1.2] Ma (n \u0007 14, MSWD \u0007 0.37), a subset of which are equivalent with a weighted\nmean 206Pb\/238U date of 542.90\u0004 0.12(0.20)[0.80] Ma (n\u0007 8, MSWD\u0007 0.62).\nAmthor and others (2003) presented geochronological constraints on two samples\nfrom the Ara Group, sample MKZ-11B which occurs 9 meters below the top of the A3\ncarbonate unit, and sample BB-5 from 1 meter above the base of the overlying A4\ncarbonate. Additional zircons from both of the samples were analyzed using the\nCA-TIMS methods to improve precision. Zircons from sample MKZ-11B with equiva-\nlent U\/Pb dates have yielded a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 542.33 \u0004\n0.11(0.19)[0.79] Ma (n \u0007 8, MSWD \u0007 0.50) and weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of\n544.10 \u0004 0.4[1.2] Ma (n \u0007 12, MSWD \u0007 0.31). Zircons from sample BB-5 yield a\nweighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 541.00 \u0004 0.13(0.21)[0.81] Ma (n \u0007 8, MSWD \u0007\n1.0) and weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 542.68\u0004 0.46[1.2] Ma (n\u0007 15, MSWD\u0007\n0.58). Dates for these Ara Group samples are summarized in table 1, with most\nconcordant analyses plotted in figure 4. The Ediacaran\/Cambrian boundary in Oman\nis interpreted to closely coincide with the BB-5 ash bed (Amthor and others, 2003);\nthese new results suggest the boundary, therefore, may be closer to 541 Ma (in\n206Pb\/238U years) than the 542 Ma estimate reported by Amthor and others (2003).\nFara Formation\nThe Fara Formation consists of three lithologies (McCarron, ms, 2000): a lower\nunit (\u0001140 m thick) composed of black, finely-laminated siliceous shale and chert with\nsome interbedded carbonate breccias; a middle unit composed of volcaniclastic\n1117chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nFi\ng.\n9.\nC\nor\nre\nla\nti\non\nof\nN\neo\npr\not\ner\noz\noi\nc\nca\nrb\non\nis\not\nop\ne\nda\nta\nfr\nom\nN\naf\nun\nan\nd\nA\nra\nG\nro\nup\ns\n(O\nm\nan\n:B\nur\nn\ns\nan\nd\nM\nat\nte\nr,\n19\n93\n;A\nm\nth\nor\nan\nd\not\nh\ner\ns,\n20\n03\n),\nN\nam\na\nG\nro\nup\n(N\nam\nib\nia\n:G\nro\ntz\nin\nge\nr\nan\nd\not\nh\ner\ns,\n19\n95\n),\nD\nou\nsh\nan\ntu\no\/\nD\nen\ngy\nin\ng\nFo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\ns\n(C\nh\nin\na:\nC\non\ndo\nn\nan\nd\not\nh\ner\ns,\n20\n05\n)\nan\nd\nW\non\nok\na\nFo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n(A\nus\ntr\nal\nia\n:C\nal\nve\nr,\n20\n00\n)\nco\nm\nbi\nn\ned\nw\nit\nh\n2\n0\n6\nPb\n\/2\n3\n8\nU\nzi\nrc\non\nda\nte\ns\nfr\nom\nas\nh\nbe\nds\n.\n1118 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\ntuffaceous litharenites; and an upper unit of interbedded volcaniclastic sediments and\nvolcanic ignimbrites featuring welded tuffs with black fiamme. Our own observations\nof this unit include evidence for slumping, as represented by syn-sedimentary small-\nscale folds, and other downslope transport is indicated by graded, coarse sedimentary\nbreccias. However, the presence of intercalated feldspathic-lithic hummocky cross-\nstratified sandstones indicates reworking and deposition above storm wave base.\nPrior to the current study, Brasier and others (2000) obtained a U-Pb (zircon,\nID-TIMS) upper intercept age of 544.5 \u0004 3.3 Ma on an ignimbrite sample from 200\nmeters above the base of the Formation. In order to further improve the precision of\nthis age and correlation with the Ara Group (see above) two samples were collected:\nWB.01.1 from the top of the Fara Formation, and WB.01.2, a recollection of the\nignimbrite sample(s) analyzed by Brasier and others (2000) that occurs 200 meters\nabove the base of the Formation. Zircons from both samples display varying degrees of\nPb loss, which was minimized with the application of CA-TIMS. Ten zircons from\nWB.01.1 were analyzed, one of which was older and discordant. However, the remaining\npoints yield a weighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb of 545.94\u0004 0.68[1.4] Ma (n\u0007 7, MSWD\u0007 0.83)\nwith four concordant (see above) analyses yielding a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of\n542.54 \u0004 0.45(0.53)[1.1] Ma (n \u0007 4, MSWD \u0007 2.6) (fig. 4). Seventeen zircon analyses\nfrom WB.01.2, six of which were distinctly older (approximately 800 \u2013 900 Ma), yield a\nweighted mean 207Pb\/206Pb date of 548.3\u0004 0.8[1.6] Ma (n\u0007 9, MSWD\u0007 0.44), with eight\nconcordant analyses yielding a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 547.23\u00040.28(0.36)[0.96]\nMa (n\u0007 8, MSWD\u0007 1.3) (fig. 4 and table 1).\nPreviously, the Fara Formation had been considered to be equivalent to the Athel\nSilicilyte in the SOSB, which is in turn regarded as a possible equivalent to the A4\ncarbonate\/evaporite cycle. However, the results obtained here indicate that the Fara\nFormation is chronologically equivalent to much of the Ara. Indeed, the age of the\nlower ignimbrites (WB.01.2) of the Fara Formation predates by approximately 0.5 m.y.\nthe age of the A0 carbonates (see Asala-1c21 above), which are known to contain\nabundant felsic tuffs. The Fara age of about 548 Ma could coincide exactly with the\ntransition between the Nafun and Ara groups, which is marked by a regional unconfor-\nmity and onset of volcanism and fault-related subsidence.\nDetrital Zircons, Western Deformation Front and Southern Oman\nDetrital zircons from four siliciclastic samples of uncertain lithostratigraphic\naffinity were analyzed in order to determine maximum depositional age and provide\ninformation of the age of the source terrains supplying the clastic sediment. In general,\nthese samples consist of detritus that may have been derived from erosion of the\nuplifting Western Deformation Front (see fig. 1 for location), which forms the western\nmargin of the Ara salt basins.\nSample OM-01-4 was collected from deformed and mildly metamorphosed sand-\nstone turbidites exposed at the base of the escarpment at Ain Sarit (fig. 1). Five single\ngrains were analyzed yielding ages of approximately 1.43 Ga, 2.43 Ga, 2.45 Ga, 2.47 Ga\nand 3.0 Ga. Sample Tharwah-1 consists of shale sampled from a depth of 3390.0 meters\ndepth (Tharwah-1 well; fig. 1) at the A0 stratigraphic level. Three single zircon grains\nwere analyzed each giving ages of about 2.58 Ga. Sample Ranadah-2 consists of fine,\nfluvial sandstones in the upper Ara Group, and was collected from a depth of 3201.00\nmeters (Ranadah-2 well; fig. 1). Four single zircons were analyzed yielding ages of\napproximately 650 Ma (one grain), 940 Ma (two grains) and 980 Ma (one grain). In\nthe context of the constraints outlined above, the youngest zircon at about 650 Ma\nconstrains this sample to being equivalent to Saqlah Formation or younger. Sample\nGhudun-1 was recovered from TD cuttings at the base of the Ghudun-1 well (depth of\n2509.8 to 2659.4 meters). Fourteen single zircon grains were analyzed from this sample\nand record a wide range of ages: approximately 620 Ma (two grains), 640 Ma (one\ngrain), 720 Ma (one grain), 760 Ma (one grain), 970 Ma (two grains), 1.02-1.06 Ma\n1119chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\n(two grains), 1.75 Ga (two grains), 2.09 Ga (one grain), 2.39 Ga (one grain) and 2.52\nGa (one grain). Again, in the context of the constraints outlined above, the approxi-\nmately 620 Ma grain confines this interval to be either Nafun equivalent or younger.\nThese results are summarized in figure 5.\ndiscussion\nThe data presented in this study provide the basis for the first comprehensive\nchronostratigraphic framework for the Neoproterozoic of Oman. This framework is\nrequired for understanding the relationships between tectonic, climatic and paleobio-\nlogic events recorded in these rocks and their relationship to other similar global data\nsets for this interval.\nBasement Terrains\nThe age of the crystalline basement exposed in Oman is important in understand-\ning the tectonic history and source region for detrital zircons in younger stratigraphy.\nAlthough basement exposures in Oman are restricted to the Huqf and Mirbat areas,\ntheir geological history is broadly consistent with that inferred from western Saudi\nArabia. The geochronology and isotope systematics of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and\nSomalia have been discussed by several authors (Windley and others, 1996; White-\nhouse and others, 2001; Mercolli and others, 2006). The older crystalline basement in\nYemen is characterized by seven major domains separated by N-NE trending bound-\naries (Whitehouse and others, 2001). In general there are fragments of Archean crust\nwithin a collage of early to mid-Neoproterozoic arc terranes of the Arabian-Nubian\nshield. From a combination of U-Pb zircon and Pb and Nd isotope systematics, there is\nevidence for Archean crust in Yemen that ranges in age from about 2.6 to\b3.0 Ga.\nThe history of arc and microcontinent accretion in Saudi Arabia spans from\napproximately 820 Ma to 750 Ma followed by collisional assembly of a collage of\ncontinental fragments including parts of Sri Lanka, Seychelles, and India to form the\nEast African orogen from approximately 750 to 640 Ma (Meert and Van Der Voo, 1997;\nMeert, 2003). Subsequently, the region was affected by post-assembly extension along\nan approximately N-S axis (Meert, 2003). The Huqf Supergroup of Oman spans the\ntime of early assembly and regional extension (approximately 750 \u2013 630 Ma). Although\nthe record is sparse in Oman, it would appear that following the amalgamation at\nabout 800 Ma (recorded by igneous activity reflecting an active magmatic arc: Mercolli\nand others, 2006), there is little preserved record until\u0003750 to about 713 Ma (Gubrah\nFormation) and most is younger (Saqlah-Fiq Formations, Nafun and Ara Groups).\nConstraints on Neoproterozoic Glaciations\nThe Huqf Supergroup contains evidence for two distinct Neoproterozoic glacia-\ntions. Based upon the data of Brasier and others (2000) the Ghubrah Formation has\npreviously been considered to reflect a \u2018Sturtian\u2019 age glaciation. Other examples of\nSturtian-type glaciations occur in Australia (Sturt Formation), Congo Craton (Chuos\nFormation), Western Laurentia (Rapitan Formation) and are commonly associated\nwith ironstones and \u000213C-depleted cap-carbonates (see Evans, 2000, for an exhaustive\nreview). In Namibia the Chuos Formation (Congo Craton) overlies Naauwpoort\nvolcanics that have yielded a U-Pb (zircon, ID-TIMS) age of 746\u0004 2 Ma (Hoffman and\nothers, 1996). Clasts from the Rapitan Formation of Canadian Cordillera and Pocatello\nFormation of southeastern Idaho (Western Laurentia) have yielded U-Pb zircon ages\nof 755 \u0004 18 Ma (ID-TIMS, Ross and Villeneuve, 1997) and 717 \u0004 9 Ma (ion-\nmicroprobe, Fanning and Link, 2004), respectively, both providing maximum age\nconstraints for Sturtian-type glacial deposits. Minimum age constraints on Sturtian-\ntype deposits come from units in China where the Tiesiao Formation, interpreted as a\nglaciogenic diamictite, is overlain by a volcanic tuff bed dated by the U-Pb (ID-TIMS)\nmethod at 663 \u0004 4 Ma (Zhou and others, 2004) and in Australia where black shales\n1120 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\noverlying glacial deposits yield Re-Os dates of 643 and 657 Ma (Kendall and others,\n2006). Our approximately 713 Ma age from the Ghubrah Formation represents the\nfirst direct high precision constraint for a \u2018Sturtian\u2019 age Neoproterozoic glacial\ndeposit. However it should be noted that it remains unclear whether deposition of the\nGhubrah Formation was associated with ironstones or dark, organic-rich cap-carbonate\nthat are considered hallmarks of Sturtian-type deposits (Kennedy and others, 1998).\nFurthermore, given the current data set, it remains unclear whether the Sturtian-type\nglacials represent a single, globally synchronous glacial epoch. Kendall and others\n(2006) suggest that the Sturtian ice age was diachronous and\/or there were multiple\nglaciations from about 650 to\b700 Ma.\nThe ages of Marinoan-type glacial deposits, as characterized by their overlying\nlight-colored dolostone cap carbonates with distinctive physical attributes (Hoffman\nand Schrag, 2002), have been constrained in China, Namibia and Canada. In China an\nage of 663\u0004 4 Ma (U-Pb ID-TIMS zircon) has been obtained on an ash that occurs well\nbelow the Nantuo tillite (Zhou and others, 2004) and an age of 635 \u0004 1 Ma (U-Pb\nID-TIMS zircon) has been obtained on an ash within the cap carbonate (Lower\nDolomite Member) of the Doushantuo Formation (Condon and others, 2005). In\ncentral Namibia the Ghuab Formation, considered an archetypal example of a\nMarinoan-type deposit (Halverson and others, 2005), has yielded an age of 635\u0004 1 Ma\n(U-Pb ID-TIMS zircon) from within its dropstone-bearing lithology (Hoffmann and\nothers, 2004). In western Canada the Icebrook Formation has been constrained to be\nolder than a 608 \u0004 5 Ma Re-Os isochron age (MSWD \u0007 1.2) derived from overlying\nblack shales (Kendall and others, 2004). In Australia where the type-Marinoan and\nbase Ediacaran GSSP occur, the emerging picture is more complex (Schaefer and\nBurgess, 2003; Calver and others, 2004; Kendall and others, 2004, 2006). A third,\nyounger, Neoproterozoic glaciation is preserved in successions from Avalonia, Lauren-\ntia, Baltica and possibly western Australia and China. These include the Sqauntum\nTillite of southern New England (Thompson and Bowring, 2000), Gaskiers Formation\nof Newfoundland (Bowring and others, 2003), Lower Southern Highland Group of\nnorthern Ireland (Condon and Prave, 2000; McCay and others, 2006), Moelv Tillite of\nsoutheast Norway (Bingen and others, 2005), Egan Formation of western Australia\n(Grey and Corkeron, 1998), and Quruqtagh Group of eastern Tianshan (Xiao and\nothers, 2004). Geochronological constraints from this \u201cGaskiers glaciation\u201d are limited\nto the Gaskiers Formation itself, which yields an age for glaciation of about 582 Ma\n(Bowring and others, 2003; unpublished data).\nMaximum age constraints of approximately 660 Ma and 645 Ma have been\ndetermined for the glaciomarine Fiq Formation and Lahan-1 dropstone-bearing\nsiltstones, respectively. Both glacial units are overlain by tan-colored, dolomitic, cap\ncarbonates that record negative \u000213C values characteristic of other Neoproterozoic\npost-glacial cap carbonates world-wide (Kennedy and others, 1998; Hoffman and\nSchrag, 2002). Within the context of our present understanding of the chronology of\nNeoproterozoic glaciations (for example, Bowring and others, 2003) there are two\npossible interpretations of the Fiq\/Lahan-1 glacial(s): they represent a Marinoan age\nglaciation which terminated at about 635 Ma, or they reflect a younger Ediacaran\nPeriod glaciation and are broadly correlative to the approximately 582 Ma Gaskiers\nFormation. Given the nature of the cap carbonate and its similarities to other\nMarinoan-type cap carbonates most workers interpret the Fiq Formation as reflecting a\nMarinoan-type glaciation (Leather and others, 2002; Le Guerroue and others, 2005).\nIn the context of the present geochronologic constraints, we feel this is the most\nstraightforward interpretation. Thus, the simplest working hypothesis for the Abu\nMahara Group is that the older, Ghubrah glacial deposits correspond, based upon\ndirect age constraints, to the Sturtian event and that the younger, Fiq Formation glacial\ndeposit represents the Marinoan event. Inference on the latter is based largely upon\n1121chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nmaximum age constraints combined with the nature of the respective cap carbonate.\nHowever the exact age of onset, and therefore duration, of the event remains\nunconstrained.\nCalibrating Terminal Ediacaran History\nGeochronological calibration of the Ara Group, when combined with published\ndata from the Nama Group (Southern Namibia) and Doushantuo Formation (China)\npermit refined evaluation of terminal Ediacaran history (551 \u2013 542 Ma). Chemostrati-\ngraphic data from Oman, Australia, Namibia and China indicate a globally extensive\ncarbon isotope excursion of \u000116 permil (the \u201cShuram excursion\u201d). The top of this\nexcursion is constrained at about 551 Ma (Condon and others, 2005) in China where\nan ash bed has been dated just below the cross-over to positive \u000213C values. It must be\nnoted, however, that this excursion involves crossing a substantial facies boundary\nwhich could possibly coincide with a sequence boundary, as well. Subsequent to this\nexcursion \u000213C values increase to \u00064 permil before decreasing to \u00062 permil where\nthey remain invariant until the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary ( Grotzinger and\nothers, 1995; Amthor and others, 2003). This decrease from \u00064 to \u00062 permil is\nconstrained by interstratified ash beds in both the Ara and Nama Groups; the ashes\nhave yielded 206Pb\/238U dates indicating that the variations in \u000213C reflect globally\nsynchronous and correlated changes in seawater composition. Weakly calcified metazo-\nans (Cloudina, Namacalathus, and Namapoikia) occur just below the\u00064 permil zenith in\nthe Nama Group and are prevalent throughout the \u00062 permil \u2018plateau\u2019 characterized\nby reefs inhabited by Cloudina and Namacalathus in the Nama Group, Ara Group and\nDengying Formation (fig. 9). In China, macroscopic algae (Miaohe Biota) occur\nwithin the top of the Doushantuo Formation contemporaneous with the upper part of\nthe excursion.\nAmthor and others (2003) reported U-Pb dates on an Ara ash bed (sample BB-5)\nthat occurs within carbonate strata (A4C) marked by a distinctive negative excursion in\ncarbon isotopes and considered to mark the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in Oman.\nAdditional analyses for this A4C ash bed, and a second, subjacent ash-bed (sample\nMKZ-11B) within the upper A3C, were undertaken as part of this study in order to\nrefine their ages (fig. 4 and table 1). The new analyses reflect use of the CA-TIMS\nmethod as well as our new and improved calibration of the U-Pb tracer used for isotope\ndilution analysis. The best estimates for the age of the BB-5 ash bed are the new\nweighted mean 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/206Pb dates of 541.00 \u0004 0.13 and 542.68 \u0004 0.46\nMa, respectively, which supersede the U-Pb Concordia age of 542.0\u0004 0.3 Ma reported\nin Amthor and others (2003) (fig. 4). Similarly, the best estimates for the age of the\nMKZ-11B ash bed are now the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/206Pb dates of\n542.33 \u0004 0.11 Ma and 544.10 \u0004 0.40 Ma, respectively, which supersede the previously\nreported U-Pb Concordia age of 542.6\u0004 0.3 (fig. 4).\nDuration of Ara Group Carbonate-Evaporite Cycles\nIn addition to the ages reported above for the base of the A4C and the top of the\nA3C units, we have also obtained an age for an ash bed (Minha-1A) at the base of the\nA3C unit (see above and fig. 8). The three Ara Group ages (BB-5, MKZ-11B, and\nMinha-1A) allow estimation of the sediment accumulation rates for the A3C carbonate\nunit and the overlying A4 evaporite unit. Furthermore, an additional ash bed (Asala-\n1c21) is located in the middle of the A0 unit (see above and fig. 8), which allows us to\nconstrain the duration of three and a half carbonate-evaporite cycles. The combination\nof the four ages from the Ara allows an estimate of the average duration of each\ncarbonate-evaporite cycle, in addition to directly constraining the accumulation rates\nof the A3 carbonate unit and the A4 evaporite unit.\nFor the purposes of calculating durations, the same calculated date must be\ncompared between samples. Utilizing the more precise 206Pb\/238U dates, the differ-\n1122 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nence between the Asala-1c21 age (middle of A0) and the MKZ-11B age (top of A3) is\n4.1 to 4.7 m.y., which is taken as the time represented by the upper half of the A0 unit\nand all of the overlying A1, A2, and A3 units. This yields an average of 1.2 to 1.3 m.y.\nper carbonate-evaporite cycle. The age difference between BB5 and MKZ-11B con-\nstrains the duration of the A4 evaporite half cycle to 1.1 to 1.6 m.y. In contrast, the\nunderlying A3 carbonate half cycle has a calculated duration of 0.3 to 0.8 m.y.\n(difference between Minha-1A and MKZ-11B) (fig. 8).\nPartitioning of Time in the Nafun Group\nDeposition of the Abu Mahara Group appears to have occurred in aerially\nrestricted basins, probably associated with regional extension (Loosveld and others,\n1996; Le Guerroue and others, 2005). In contrast, stratigraphic and sedimentologic\nstudies of the overlying Nafun Group show facies and thickness distributions consistent\nwith deposition across a broadly subsiding region. The mapped limits of these strata do\nnot show evidence of thinning, or a transition to shoreline or fluvial facies, which\nindicates that the original basin limits may once have extended well beyond the\ncurrently known margins (unpublished data, Petroleum Development Oman). Out-\ncrop and subsurface data indicate that the Nafun Group extends from the Mirbat area\nin the south of Oman, to the Huqf area in central Oman, and farther north to the\nOman Mountains (McCarron, ms, 2000).\nThe Nafun Group consists, in ascending order, the Hadash Formation (cap-\ncarbonate), Masirah Bay Formation (shelf clastics), the Khufai Formation (shelf\ncarbonates), the Shuram Formation (mixed shelf clastics and carbonates), and the\nBuah Formation (shelf carbonates) (fig. 2). The Masirah Bay Formation overlies the\nHadash Formation in the Oman Mountains, and in turns passes upwards with a\ngradational contact into the overlying Khufai Formation. The transition from the\nHadash Formation into the Masirah Bay is marked by several parasequences in which\ncarbonates progressively thin and siliciclastic shales and siltstones progressively thicken\nindicating a gradational\/conformable transition. These clastics then form several\nshoaling-upward sequences, capped by tidal sandstones (Huqf area) or deeper water,\nstorm-deposits (Jabal Akhdar) (Allen and Leather, 2006). The Masirah Bay-Khufai\nFormation transition reflects a deepening (upper Masirah Bay Formation) followed by\na prograding, shallowing-upward carbonate ramp succession capped by ooid grain-\nstone shoal and evaporitic peritidal deposits (McCarron, ms, 2000). The Khufai is\noverlain by the Shuram Formation, which consists of aggradationally-stacked parase-\nquence sets; individual parasequences contain basal wave-rippled siltstone and shales\nthat grade upward into isolated and amalgamated hummocky cross-stratified sand-\nstone beds, often associated with oolitic and intraclastic carbonates. The Shuram\nFormation grades upward, through increasing carbonate content and decreasing\nsandstone content, into the Buah formation, which represents a prograding carbonate\nramp succession (McCarron, ms, 2000; Cozzi and others, 2004a). In the Buah ramp\nmodel, deeper water edgewise conglomerates and mudstones pass upward into ooid-\npeloid tide-dominated packstone-grainstone facies, with interbedded stromatolite\nbioherms. In the Jabal Akhdar, the Buah preserves a ramp margin transition, where\nshallow-water facies pass laterally into deepwater allodapic breccias and associated\nmudstones. The Buah-Ara contact is everywhere regarded as a regional unconformity,\nalthough in the Oman Mountains the Buah may be conformably overlain by the\nAra-equivalent Fara Formation (Cozzi and others, 2004a).\nThe stratigraphy of the Nafun Group provides strong evidence for conformable\ntransitions between the Hadash cap carbonate and the Masirah Bay Formation;\nbetween the Masirah Bay Formation and Khufai Formation; and between the Shuram\nFormation and the Buah Formation. However, the contacts between the Khufai\nFormation and Shuram Formation, and the Buah Formation and Ara Group, may both\nrepresent unconformities (McCarron, ms, 2000; Cozzi and others, 2004a). In addition,\n1123chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nunpublished seismic and well-log data from Petroleum Development Oman (PDO)\nindicate gentle truncation along these surfaces, providing further evidence for uncon-\nformable relations.\nThe duration of the Buah-Ara unconformity may be short, on the order of 1 m.y.\nor less, constrained by the inferred age of the top-Buah positive C-isotope excursion\nwhich is thought to correlate to Namibia (Cozzi and others, 2004a) where it has been\ndated at approximately 547 Ma (see above), and the age reported here for the middle\nof the A0 unit of about 547 Ma (see table 1). In contrast, there are no direct constraints\non the amount of time represented by the Khufai-Shuram contact. The base of the\nShuram Formation is constrained to being younger than approximately 620 Ma, the\nyoungest detrital zircon data from sample WB.01.6, which is from the base of the\nShurham Formation. Detrital zircon data obtained by ion microprobe (SHRIMP II)\nfrom a sample below the Shuram-Khufai boundary yielded detrital zircons that have a\nrange of 206Pb\/238U dates between 900 Ma and 600 Ma (one-sigma errors of about 10\nMa), with a youngest zircon component whose weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date was\nderived by mathematical deconvolution from a mixed age population to be 609\u0004 7 Ma\n(2\u0005) (Le Guerroue and others, 2006). Given the problem of detecting Pb loss in\ndetrital zircon suites analyzed by in-situ methods, caution is urged in accepting 609\u0004 7\nMa as a firm maximum constraint until further analyses are carried out. These data are\ninterpreted by the authors to indicate that the \u201cKhufai-Shuram boundary cannot be\nmuch older than 600 Ma\u201d. This statement is misleading as the detrital zircon dates only\nprovide a maximum constraint; the boundary must be younger than the youngest\ndetrital zircon in the Khufai. In contrast to our speculations on the age of the Shuram,\nLe Guerroue and others (2006) used the age of detrital zircons and subsidence\nmodelling to infer an age for the base of the Shuram of 600 Ma and a duration of the\nlarge negative carbon isotope excursion of 50 m.y.\nCritical to understanding the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Arabian shield\nduring this interval (Ediacaran to Early Cambrian) is to know how time is partitioned\nin the Nafun Group and inferentially the subsidence mechanism responsible for\ngeneration of accommodation space. In the absence of geochronologic constraints\nthroughout the Nafun the duration of the Shuram-Buah succession can be estimated\nbased on interpolation and downward extrapolation of calibrated tie points on the\nC-isotope curve. Figure 10 shows a significant reference section for the Huqf Super-\ngroup, provided by the Miqrat-1 well. This well is representative of the Nafun Group\nand was selected because of its important role in constraining major events in the\nhistory of the basin (Burns and Matter, 1993). Its thickness is also representative of the\nmore complete sections in the basin. The carbon-isotopic variability for carbonate\nsediments in the Miqrat-1 well has been determined by Burns and Matter (1993) and,\nby correlation, ages can be inferred for four stratigraphic points. In order to minimize\nthe uncertainties associated with the geochronological constraints, we utilize the\nprecision of the 206Pb\/238U ages. As we are primarily interested in the differences\nbetween various dated levels, external sources of uncertainty are not considered. The\nfirst, at 546.72\u0004 0.21 Ma, is provided by the age of the ash bed located in the middle of\nthe A0 in the Asala-1c21 well; in the Miqrat-1 well this age is assigned to a depth of\n3165 m (fig. 10). The second age point, at 547.36\u0004 0.23 Ma, is provided by correlation\n(fig. 9) of the positive carbon isotope anomaly at the top of the Buah (Cozzi and\nothers, 2004b) to the positive carbon isotopic anomaly in the Nama Group (see above).\nIn detail, the Nama ash bed occurs just above the most positive values for this anomaly,\nwhere the values are declining rapidly back to the baseline of \u0006 2 permil; in the\nMiqrat-1 well, this point is assigned to a depth of 3200 m, which corresponds to the\nBuah-Ara boundary (fig. 10). A third age can be inferred based on correlation to China\nwhere Condon and others (2005) obtained an age of 550.5 \u0004 1.0 Ma (recalculated\nusing the same tracer calibration values for Asala-1c21 and 94-N-10B) for an ash bed in\n1124 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nFig. 10. Wire-line, lithological data (PDO, unpublished) and chemostratigraphy (Burns and Matter, 1993) of the\nMiqrat-1 well (see fig. 1 for location). This well is used by PDO and outside workers as a reference section for Huqf\nstratigraphy owing to its substantial thickness and relatively complete stratigraphy. It was also one of the first to be\nstudied for its chemical stratigraphic attributes (Burns and Matter, 1993). Ash bed U-Pb dates on the right are inferred\nbased upon chemostratigraphic correlation: (1) at \u20133\u2030 based upon correlation with China (Condon and others,\n2005); (2) at directly above\u00064\u2030 peak based upon correlation with Nama Group, Namibia (Grotzinger and others,\n1995) and (3) within middle of A0 carbonate in the Asala-1 well (this paper). These ages along with their stratigraphic\npositions are used to estimate sediment accumulation rates by way of linear interpolation. Farther downward\nextrapolation will then allow inference as to the duration of the Shuram \u000213C excursion.\n1125chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nthe uppermost Doushantuo Formation just below its contact with the overlying\nDengying Formation (fig. 9). At this stratigraphic position, the corresponding carbon\nisotope curve shows an upward shift from strongly negative values on the order of -8\npermil to positive values of up to\u00065 permil. The ash occurs just below carbonates with\n\u20133 permil values that increase upwards to slightly positive values and is correlated to the\nlower Buah Formation in Oman (Condon and others, 2005); in the Miqrat-1 well, this\npoint is assigned to a depth of 3370 m (fig. 10).\nWhen considered in the context of the Miqrat-1 well, these three constraints\npermit the calculation of sediment accumulation rates for the intervening strata via\nlinear interpolation of thickness between the dated horizons. This analysis is subject to\nthe assumption of depositional continuity both within the upper Nafun Group as well\nas the sections in Namibia and China which provide time constraints. A first constraint\nis based upon the thickness of \u0001 35 meters (assuming no significant erosion at the\nAra-Buah boundary) between 546.7\u0004 0.2 Ma and 547.4\u0004 0.2 Ma points yielding rates\nof approximately 30 to \u0001 100 m\/m.y. A second constraint is provided by the interval\nbetween the 550.5 \u0004 1.0 Ma point (3370 m) and the 547.4 \u0004 0.2 Ma point (3200 m),\n170 meters in 1.9 to 4.4 m.y. (considering maximum and minimum differences within\nconfines of analytical uncertainties) yields rates in the order of 40 to 90 m\/m.y.\nApplying these rates to the thickness of the Buah and Shuram Formations (from\n3200 m to 3800 m, a thickness of 600 m) yields an inferred duration of approximately 7\nto 15 m.y. Using an age of about 547 Ma for the Buah-Ara contact predicts an age for\nbasal Shuram strata of approximately 554 to 562 Ma. Additionally, these rates can be\nused to estimate the duration of the negative carbon isotope excursion represented by\nthe Shuram and lower Buah formations: picking the zero-crossing points (3800 m to\n3370 m; fig. 10) and using the above sediment accumulation rates gives a duration of\napproximately 5 to 11 m.y. These estimates contrast to those of (Le Guerroue and\nothers, 2006) who derived a 50 m.y. duration for the Shuram excursion based on\npassive margin thermal subsidence modelling. Our calculations are based upon\nnecessarily simple assumptions such as linear interpolation and extrapolation, however\ngiven the absence of geochronologic constraints for the interval of interest (basal part\nof the Shuram excursion) we feel that these age estimates provide a good first\napproximation for duration and age of the Shuram excursion.\nLe Guerroue and others (2006) assume that the subsidence that provided\naccommodation space for the Nafun group was driven by post-rift thermal subsidence.\nFor the purposes of their model, they assume that the Shuram\/Khufai boundary\ncannot be much older than 600 Ma, based on a single detrital grain from the upper\nKhufai with a 206Pb\/238U date of 600 \u0004 20 (2\u0005). In fact, there are no firm constraints\nfor the age of the basal Shuram or subsidence history, which is why we choose to base\nour estimates for the age and duration of the Shuram anomaly from younger rocks.\nOur estimates for the duration of the Shuram are obtained by extrapolating downward\nfrom the Ara, which provides us with reliable subsidence rates from 547 to 550 Ma. An\nalternative to a passive margin subsidence model is subsidence induced by tectonic\nloading and development of a foreland basin. In this model accommodation space\nwould increase with time, not decrease as predicted in a post-rift thermal subsidence\nmodel consistent with the record of the Ara Formation. The predicted age of 554 to\n562 Ma in our model for the basal Shuram anomaly also explains the apparent absence\nof any carbon isotopic excursion associated with the older 582 Ma Gaskiers glaciation\nevent in this sequence. In any case, until more direct temporal constraints become\navailable, use of the carbon isotopic record in the Shuram as a global chemostrato-\ngraphic reference invites caution.\nconclusions\nThe new chronostratigraphic data presented here permit the Huqf Supergroup of\nOman to be integrated into the developing global database for the Late Neoprotero-\n1126 Samuel A. Bowring and others\u2014Geochronologic constraints on the\nFig. 11. Interpreted chronostratigraphy of Neoproterozoic rocks in Oman based upon the constraints discussed\nin this paper. Four major sequences are identified (numbers on the right column): (1) Intraplate magmatism from\nabout 830 to 700 Ma with the main phase occurring approximately 830 to 780 Ma and with minor intrusions being\nemplaced until about 700 Ma (Mercolli and others, 2006; this paper); (2) The unconformably overlying Abu Mahara\nGroup deposited in aerially restricted basins from \b713 Ma to 635 Ma with two phases of glacially influenced\nsedimentation at roughly 713 Ma (Ghubrah Formation) and 635 (Fiq Formation); (3) Conformable transition into the\noverlying laterally extensive Nafun Group. An unconformity is recognized within the Nafun Group at the level of\nKhufai-Shuram interface. The unconformity is recognized in subsurface by seismic reflector truncation (PDO data)\nand in the outcrop by a karst surface (see McCarron, ms, 2000). The magnitude of the Khufai-Shuram unconformity is\nuncertain, the age of the lower Shuram Formation being inferred based on the downward extrapolation discussed in\nthe text; (4) Unconformable boundary between the Nafun and Ara Groups is marked by low angle truncations\nobserved in PDO subsurface seismic data, but is constrained to be on the order of 1 m.y. or less (fig. 9). The Nafun-Ara\nboundary marks a shift from regional subsidence to a tectonic style characterized by uplift of large basement blocks\nwhich segmented the broader basin into several fault-bounded sub-basins (Immerz and others, 2000).\n1127chronostratigraphic framework of the Neoproterozoic Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman\nzoic Era, including the Ediacaran Period. Evidence for two glacial episodes and the\nsimilarities in age and character between the rocks in Oman, Namibia, Australia, and\nChina validate the global and synchronous nature of a large fluctuation in the carbon\nisotopic composition of seawater at about 560 to 550 Ma used for correlations and\ninferences with respect to relationships between biology and ocean chemistry.\nThe evolution of the pre-Huqf Supergroup basement in Oman has a complex\nhistory, involving Archean crust in tectonic processes such as the uplift of the western\ndeformation front. Previously, Archean crust has been noted in outcrop at the\nsouthern end of the Arabian Peninsula, and these new data suggest the northern\nextension of these Archean terrains beneath eastern Saudi Arabia and Oman. The\nyounger history of the Oman crystalline basement involves a widespread period of\nfelsic magmatism that spanned at least from 830 to 800 Ma. These rocks may represent\ndevelopment of a continental magmatic arc. Crustal extension, rift-basin development,\nand limited magmatism was coincident with the development of the Abu Mahara\nGroup between\b713 and 635 Ma (fig. 11).\nWithin the Abu Mahara Group two distinct episodes of glacial deposition oc-\ncurred at approximately 713 and \u0003645 Ma as constrained by the ages of ash beds\nintercalated within the Ghubrah and overlying Fiq formations. The younger, Fiq\nglacial deposit may be widespread in Oman as shown by strata of similar age in the\nLahan-1 well (SOSB) and in the Oman Mountains of north Oman. When considered\nin the context of emerging temporal framework for the Neoproterozoic (for example,\nCondon and others, 2005; Halverson and others, 2005), these appear to be consistent\nwith the globally recognized Sturtian and Marinoan glacial episodes, the latter of\nwhich terminates at approximately 635 Ma and defines the lower bound of the\nEdiacaran Period.\nThe dramatic carbon isotope excursion of \u000115 permil recorded within the\nShuram Formation has a maximum age of 600 Ma. Parts of the \u201cShuram excursion\u201d\ncan be correlated with the Wonoka anomaly in Australia (Calver, 2000), the Doushan-\ntuo Formation of southern China (Condon and others, 2005), and the Omkyk\nMember (Nama Group) in Namibia (Grotzinger and others, 1995; Workman and\nothers, 2002). Downward extrapolation of new U-Pb data from Oman constrained by\nlocal and global correlations suggest this excursion starts at roughly 560 Ma, terminat-\ning at about 551 Ma, with an inferred duration of approximately 5 to 11 m.y. There is\nno evidence that this massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle is related to\nglaciation but is most likely related to progressive oxygenation of the oceans (Rothman\nand others, 2003; Condon and others, 2005; Fike and others, 2006). Following the\nlarge perturbation of the carbon cycle, the carbon isotopic composition of seawater\nincrease to values of near \u00064 permil before decreasing to \u00062 permil where it remains\ninvariant from about 547 Ma to the end of the Ediacaran Period at approximately 542\nMa (Grotzinger and others, 1995; Amthor and others, 2003). It is noteworthy that this\ninterval is characterized by widespread carbonate reefs occupied by the first weakly\ncalcified metazoans (547 Ma onwards), a diverse and complex assemblage of Ediacaran\nFauna, and increase in occurrence of trace fossils indicating organisms with the ability\nto burrow laterally and graze (555 Ma onwards, Martin and others, 2000). These\ncalcified metazoans and the Ediacaran Fauna disappear from the record coincident\nwith a negative excursion in the carbon isotopic composition of seawater at the\nPrecambrian-Cambrian boundary (Amthor and others, 2003).\nThe Fara Formation, exposed in the Oman Mountains, contains ignimbrites and\nfelsic volcaniclastic sediments, yielding ages of approximately 547 Ma at its base to 542\nMa at the top. This confirms that the Fara Formation and Ara Group (SOSB) are\nbroadly contemporaneous (fig. 11). The base Fara Formation\/Ara Group marks a\nchange from broad regional subsidence (Nafun Group) to deposition within aerially\nrestricted, fault-bounded basins coincident with the onset of felsic magmatism.\n1128 Samuel A.
