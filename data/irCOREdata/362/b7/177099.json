If left untreated, FTMH usually leads to severe\nvisual impairment, with over a third of patients experienc-\ning a drop in vision to levels of 20\/200 or worse [1].\nFTMH are common. The incidence has not been reported\nin the UK but it is estimated to be around 3\/10,000\/year\nbased on reported incidence in a similar population in the\nUSA [2]. Macular hole surgery represents one of the most\ncommon procedures performed by vitreo-retinal surgeons\n[3].\nFour stages (1\u20134) of FTMH have been described, often\nwith increasing severity of visual loss as the stage of the\nhole progresses [4]. Around 40% of cases are likely to\nprogress beyond stage 1 [5,6]. Up to 20% of affected peo-\nple will develop a FTMH in both eyes [7].\nRandomised controlled clinical trials conducted in the\n1990s showed that surgery was effective for stage 2, 3 and\n4 FTMH [8,9]. Several observational studies have sug-\ngested that peeling the internal limiting membrane (ILM)\nof the retina may improve the visual and anatomical suc-\ncess of the surgery (reviewed by Abdelkader and Lois)\n[10,11]. However, it is difficult to interpret the results of\nthese studies and compare them with those from other\nseries in which the ILM was not peeled since parameters\nwhich are likely to influence anatomical and visual out-\ncomes, including stage of the hole, pre-operative vision,\nduration of symptoms, size of the macular hole, presence\nof cataract, and extent of ILM peeling varied among study\npopulations.\nRecently, data from two randomised controlled trials\n(RCT) evaluating the effect of ILM peeling in macular hole\nsurgery have become available [12] (La Cour M, Personal\ncommunication, Combined meeting of the Club Jules\nGonin and the Retina Society, Cape Town, October 15\u2013\n20, 2006). Kwok and collaborators reported statistically\nsignificantly higher rates of macular hole closure and vis-\nual acuity improvement following ILM peeling compared\nwith a no-peeling technique in an RCT involving 49 par-\nticipants (51 eyes) with stage 2, 3 and 4 FTMH [12]. A\nhigh proportion of patients in this RCT had FTMH on\nstage 4 (50% and 32% in the ILM peel and no ILM peel\ngroup, respectively) and few had FTMH on stage 2 (15.4%\nand 12% in the ILM peel and no ILM-peel groups, respec-\ntively). The timing of final outcome assessment was vari-\nable, ranging from 6\u201323 months. La Cour and associates\n(La Cour M, Personal communication, Combined meet-\ning of the Club Jules Gonin and the Retina Society, Cape\nTown, October 15\u201320, 2006) also found a higher rate of\nmacular hole closure following ILM peeling in an interim\nanalysis of an RCT when only 22 patients were enrolled.\nBased on these results, further recruitment for this RCT\nhas been halted. Another RCT evaluating the effect of ILM\npeeling in macular hole surgery in patients with large idi-\nopathic macular holes (>400 microns) is currently under-\nway http:\/\/clinicaltrial.gov\/ct\/gui, with a recruitment\ntarget of 80 patients.\nPeeling the ILM is a surgical technique that can be techni-\ncally challenging, even for experienced vitreo-retinal sur-\ngeons, unless a dye is used to stain the ILM. Indocyanine\ngreen has been used for several years to facilitate the visu-\nalisation and removal of the ILM during macular hole sur-\ngery. However, recent research suggests that Indocyanine\ngreen may be toxic to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)\nand ganglion cells, and concerns now exist regarding its\nused for this purpose (revised by Abdelkader and Lois)\n[10,13]. New dyes have been introduced, including Infra-\ncyanine Green [14] Trypan blue [15]. Although long-term\ndata is still needed, these latter dyes seem to be safe and\nappear to be a good alternative to Indocyanine Green\n[10].\nSome concerns have been raised with regards to the possi-\nble damaging effect of ILM peeling in the nerve fibre layer\nof the retina, which potentially could have adverse effects\non central vision [16,17]. There is uncertainty in the liter-\nature and among vitreo-retinal surgeons about the bal-\nance of potential benefits and adverse effects of ILM\npeeling in FTMH surgery for stage 2\u20133 holes. Some sur-\ngeons prefer to perform ILM peeling in all cases, whereas\nothers reserve ILM peeling to treat large and\/or long-\nstanding macular holes. An Ophthalmology Technology\nAssessment reviewed the efficacy and safety of macular\nhole surgery [18] concluded that further research was\nneeded to address whether ILM peeling offered surgical\nand functional benefit to patients with FTMH.\nThe hypothesis tested in FILMS is that ILM peeling is supe-\nrior to the non-peeling procedure with regards to improv-\ning vision and quality of life, achieving macular hole\nclosure and that is cost effective.\nMethods and design\n1. Trial recruitment\nParticipants will be identified in general and specialised\nophthalmic clinics of all eight hospitals participating in\nthis trial: Aberdeen and Dundee (Scotland); Bristol, Sun-\nderland, Oxford, Liverpool, (England); Dublin and\nWaterford (Ireland).\n1.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nEligible participants are those with idiopathic FTMH in\nstages 2\u20133, of less or equal than 18 months duration\n(based on symptoms reported by the patient) and with a\nvisual acuity equal to or worse than 20\/40 in the studyPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:61 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/61eye. If bilateral idiopathic FTMH are present, the eye with\nmost recent onset of visual loss will be randomised for the\nstudy. Individuals with FTMH in stages 1 and 4, those\nwith idiopathic FTMH stages 2\u20133 but longer than 18\nmonths duration or with other causes of decreased vision\n(e.g. corneal scarring, age-related macular degeneration,\ndiabetic retinopathy, glaucoma if central and\/or paracen-\ntral absolute visual field defects are present) and those\nwith FTMH related to high myopia (> 6 dioptres) or\ntrauma will be excluded from the study. Individuals that\ndo not understand English and those unable to give\ninformed consent will not be included.\n1.2. Informing potential participants about the trial\nThe local clinical investigator (consultant vitreo-retinal\nsurgeon or a doctor\/nurse\/optometrist working with the\nconsultant) will describe the study face-to-face to poten-\ntially eligible participants. Verbal information will be sup-\nported by a patient information leaflet containing\ninformation about macular holes and current surgical\ntreatments.\n1.3. Consent to participate\nOnce eligibility has been confirmed, the local clinical\ninvestigator will ask if the potential participant is inter-\nested in joining the trial. If so, the participant will be given\na consent form. After checking with the participant that\nthe consent form is understood, the consultant vitreo-ret-\ninal surgeon will invite the participant to sign the form\nand will countersign it. One copy of the consent form will\nbe given to the patient, another will be filed in the hospi-\ntal case notes, and the third will be kept at the Trial Office\n(Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT),\nHealth Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen,\nScotland).\n1.4 Information collected at trial entry\nOnce a participant agrees to join the trial, research optom-\netrists and vitreo-retinal surgeons at each centre will\nrecord baseline data on FILMS case report forms (CRF)\nincluding full name, address and telephone number, date\nof birth, gender, hospital number and general practi-\ntioner's contact details, and check that eligibility criteria\nare met prior to enrolment on the study. CRFs are con-\ntained in booklets (one booklet per participant recruited),\nwith triplicates of each visit CRF (one to keep in the book-\nlet, one to file in the patient's medical records and one to\nbe sent to the Trial Office) with the exception of the surgi-\ncal CRF (see below) for which there are only two copies\n(one for the surgeon and one to be sent by the surgeon to\nthe Trial Office to maintain masking of the participant\nand optometrist) in each booklet. Some demographic\ndata (gender), the date of attempted recruitment, the cen-\ntre, and the grounds for non-inclusion will be collected\nalso on ineligible and unwilling participants as well as on\nparticipants not recruited for other reasons.\nWithin 2 weeks (\u00b1 2 weeks) prior to the date scheduled for\nthe surgery baseline data on primary and secondary out-\ncomes studied (Table 1) will be collected and recorded on\nthe appropriate CRF for each participant. In addition,\ninformation on duration of symptoms related to the mac-\nular hole and lens status (phakic, pseudophakic or apha-\nkic) and lens grading in phakic eyes, based on the Age\nRelated Eye Disease Study (AREDS) classification, will be\nalso collected [19].\n2. Trial interventions\nAll surgeries will be performed by a consultant vitreo-ret-\ninal surgeon or by an experienced vitreo-retinal fellow,\nsupervised by the consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon. All\nphakic participants will undergo cataract extraction by\nmeans of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens\nimplantation at the time of the macular hole surgery.\nParticipants will be randomised to receive macular hole\nsurgery either with ILM peeling or without ILM peeling. In\nparticipants not receiving ILM peeling, a pars plana vitrec-\ntomy will be performed, including detachment and\nremoval of the posterior hyaloid, followed by a fluid-air\nexchange and air-gas (12% C3F8) exchange. In partici-\npants undergoing ILM peeling, a pars plana vitrectomy,\nincluding detachment and removal of the posterior\nhyaloid, will be similarly performed but, in addition, fol-\nlowing ILM staining with Trypan blue (Membrane Blue,\nDORC) the ILM will be peeled off the retina, in an area of\naround 1\u20132 disc diameters around the hole. If staining of\nthe ILM is considered inadequate, re-staining is permitted.\nThe surgery will be completed by a fluid-air exchange and\nan air-gas (12% C3F8) exchange. Details of the surgery will\nbe recorded in the appropriate case report form. To assure\nmasking of the optometrists and participants (see below)\nto the allocated treatment, once the CRF for the surgery is\nfilled one copy will be removed from the CRF booklet and\nkept locked by the vitreo-retinal surgeon and the other\nwill be sent immediately to the Trials Office.\nThe surgical CRF contains information on date of admis-\nsion; grade of the surgeon, assistant surgeon and anaes-\nthetist [consultant, staff grade or associate specialist (non-\ntraining posts) or registrar or senior house officer (train-\ning posts)]; type of anaesthesia; performance or lack of\nperformance of ILM peeling around the hole and the\ndegree of completeness of this manoeuvre (peel complete\nor incomplete); confirmation that the vitreous was\nattached at the time of the surgery and any complications\noccurring intraoperatively. In addition, the time at which\nthe participant enters the anaesthetic room, the \"operat-\ning time\", defined as the time between starting the casePage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:61 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/61(getting the operating microscope over the participants'\neye, ready for the surgery) and completing the case (mov-\ning the microscope away from the participant's eye at the\nend of the procedure), and the time at which the partici-\npant leaves the theatre (or the recovery room when appro-\npriate) will be recorded. The date of discharge from the\nhospital will also be recorded.\nAll participants will be instructed to posture face down as\nsoon as possible after the surgery for 45 minutes every\nhour for a period of 5\u20137 days. Each participant will be\ngiven a posturing chart to record the time postured during\nthese 5\u20137 days, which will be sent, once filled, to the cen-\ntral Trials office in Aberdeen. In addition, at the 1 month\nfollow-up visit the participant will be asked how many\ndays in total did they posture following surgery (in case\nthey have not completed and returned the posturing\nchart).\n3. Treatment allocation\nThe existing central randomisation service (fully auto-\nmated telephone randomisation) in the Centre for\nHealthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services\nResearch Unit at the University of Aberdeen, will be used\nto randomise participants. A minimisation algorithm\n(according to Taves, with p = 1)20, considering trial centre,\ndistance visual acuity in the study eye and in the fellow\neye (20\/40\u201320\/160; 20\/200\u201320\/500; <20\/500), duration\nof the macular hole (= 1 year; > 1 year), lens status (pha-\nkic;aphakic;pseudophakic) and stage of the hole (Grade 2;\nGrade 3), as classified by the vitreo-retinal surgeon will be\nused.\n4. Masking of intervention and outcome assessment\nPatients, optometrists obtaining data on visual function,\nphotographers and the observer at the University of Aber-\ndeen responsible for analysing the size and status of the\nhole will be masked with regards to the type of procedure\nperformed to the participant and will remain masked\nthroughout the study.

The surgeons will know which type\nof procedure they have performed but they will not reveal\nthis to participants. The only scenario in which the partic-\nipant will be unmasked is if the macular hole is not closed\nfollowing surgery. In this situation, the participant will be\noffered further surgery and the nature of this surgery will\nbe discussed with the participant.\n5. Subsequent arrangements\n5. 1. Informing the general practitioner\nFollowing formal trial entry, the sites will contact the gen-\neral practitioner through the post to let him\/her know\nabout the participant's involvement in the trial. The letter\nsent to the general practitioner includes a brief description\nof the trial together with a request to notify the Trial Office\nif any events that may lead to their patient failing to attend\nany of the follow-up visits.\n5. 2. Follow-up\nParticipants will be followed at 1, 3, 6 and 24 months post\nsurgery. Visits will take place within 2 weeks from the\nscheduled date. All data will be recorded at each visit in\nthe appropriate CRF. Table 1 summarises the data col-\nlected at each of the follow-up visits. Post-operative com-\nplications will also be recorded at each visit.\n6. Data processing\nData from the various sources outlined above will be sent\nto the Trial Office in Aberdeen for processing. A random\n10% sample of that data will be double checked for accu-\nracy. Staff in Aberdeen will work closely with investigators\nat all participating sites to ensure complete and accurate\ndata recording. Extensive range checks will be conducted\nto further enhance the quality of the data.\n7. Outcome assessment\nThe primary outcome of the study is the mean difference\nbetween treatment groups in the Early Treatment Diabetic\nRetinopathy Study (ETDRS) distance visual acuity score at\n6 months.\nSecondary outcomes include ETDRS distance visual acuity\nat 3 and 24 months, near visual acuity at 3, 6 and 24\nmonths, contrast sensitivity at 6 months, reading speed at\n6 months, anatomical closure of the macular hole at each\ntime point (1, 3, 6 and 24 months), health related quality\nof life (HRQOL) at 6 months, costs to the health service\nand the participant, incremental costs per QALY and\nadverse events.\nA summary of the outcome measures studied and the\ntools used for their assessment at baseline and at each fol-\nlow-up visit is provided in Table 1.\n8. Analysis of the data\n8.1. Statistical analysis\nThe principal analysis will take place when six month data\ncollection is complete. A subsequent analysis will be con-\nducted once 24 months data is available. The statistical\nanalysis will be based on all patients as randomised, irre-\nspective of subsequent treatment received and, thus, will\nfollow the intention to treat principle. Additionally, the\nprimary analysis will be based upon available case data\nwith no imputation of missing values. Sensitivity analy-\nses, which impute extreme values will be performed for\nthe primary outcome (visual acuity at 6 months) and for\nother visual function and quality of life secondary out-\ncomes as appropriate. Statistical significance for the pri-\nmary and secondary outcomes will be based on two-sided\ntests with 2P \u2264 0.05 taken as the criterion for statistical sig-\nnificance. The primary outcome of ETDRS visual acuity\nscore at 6 months will be compared between the two\ngroups (ILM peel and no ILM peel) using a generalised\nlinear model to calculate the mean difference adjusted for\nthe baseline score and minimisation covariates. The pri-\nmary outcome will additionally be analysed according to\nthe pre-specified subgroups (see Treatment Allocation sec-\ntion, minimisation criteria, above) by including corre-\nsponding interaction term(s) in the regression model. For\nthese subgroup analyses, stricter criteria for statistical sig-\nnificance (2P \u2264 0.01) will be applied. Secondary out-\ncomes, adverse events and re-operation rates will be\nanalysed using generalised linear model with adjustment\nfor minimisation covariates as appropriate. Analyses of\nhealth related quality of life measures (EQ-5D and VFQ-\n25) and secondary measures of visual function (contrast\nsensitivity, MN Reading speed and distance and near vis-\nual acuity) will be adjusted for the corresponding baseline\nscore in addition to the minimisation variables.\n8.4 Economic analysis\n8.4.1 Estimation of costs\nCosts that fall on both the participant and the health serv-\nice will be elicited. Participant costs will comprise three\nmain elements: self purchased healthcare; travel costs for\nmaking return visit(s) to NHS health care; and time costs\nof travelling and attending NHS health care.\nSelf-purchased health care will include items such as pre-\nscription costs and over the counter medications. Infor-\nmation about these will be collected in the Participant\nUnit Cost questionnaire, which will be sent by post to\neach participant prior to the 6-month visit, and which will\nbe returned, once filled by the participant, to the central\noffice in Aberdeen. Estimation of travel costs requiresPage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:61 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/61information from participants about the number of visits\nto their general practitioner, ophthalmologist or optome-\ntrists and the unit cost of making a return journey to each\ntype of health care provider. The cost of participant time\nwill be estimated in a similar manner. The participant will\nbe asked, in the Participant Unit Cost Questionnaire, how\nlong they spent travelling to and attending their last visit\nto each type of health care provider. Participants will be\nasked also what activity they would have been undertak-\ning (e.g. paid work, leisure, housework) had they not\nattended the health care provider. These data will be pre-\nsented in their natural units, e.g. hours, and also costed\nusing standard economic conventions, e.g. the Depart-\nment of Transport estimates for the value of leisure time.\nThese unit time costs, measured in terms of their natural\nand monetary terms, will then be combined with esti-\nmates of number of health care contacts derived from the\nhealth care utilisation questions.\nHealth service costs of surgery will be recorded prospec-\ntively for every participant in the study. Main areas of costs\nare operation costs include staff, consumables, capital and\noverheads.\nUse of secondary care services following the operation\nwill be collected on the 3, 6 and 24 month CRFs. Informa-\ntion on non-protocol (protocol visits are those scheduled\nfor the purposes of data collection) eye-related visit(s) to\nthe outpatients\/casualty department or hospital admis-\nsion(s) and need for further surgery(ies) will be also col-\nlected.\nUse of primary care services such as prescription medica-\ntions, contacts with primary care practitioners e.g. general\npractitioners, practice nurses, optometrists and ophthal-\nmologists will be collected via the Health Care Unit Cost\nquestionnaire administered at 6 months follow-up.\n8.4.2 Estimation of effectiveness\nIn the economic analysis effectiveness at 6 and 24 months\nwill be measured in terms of quality adjusted life years\n(QALYs). QALYs will be estimated by the participants'\nresponses to the EQ-5D questionnaire (administered at\nbaseline, 6 and 24 months). The estimation of QALYs will\ntake account of the mortality of study participants. Partic-\nipants who die within the study follow-up will be\nassigned a zero utility weight from their death until the\nend of the study follow up. QALYs before death will be\nestimated using linear extrapolation between the QALY\nscores at baseline and all available EQ-5D scores up to\ndeath or the end of the study follow-up. The method of\neliciting QALYs described is one commonly adopted in\neconomic evaluation [21].\n8.4.3 Estimation of cost-effectiveness\nThe primary analysis will be based on six-month follow-\nup of the trial for the incremental cost per QALY. A second\nanalysis will be conducted for a 24-month time horizon\nusing the same methods as outlined in this manuscript.\nThe results will be presented as point estimates of mean\nincremental costs, QALYs, and incremental cost per\nQALY. Measures of variance for these outcomes are likely\nto involve bootstrapping estimates of costs, QALYs, and\nincremental cost per QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness\ndata will be presented in terms of cost-effectiveness\nacceptability curves (CEACs).\nOther forms of uncertainty, e.g. concerning the unit cost\nof a resource from the different centres, will be addressed\nusing standard deterministic sensitivity analysis. Where\nfeasible the results of the sensitivity analyses will also be\npresented as CEACs.\nA secondary economic analysis will be presented. In this\nanalysis the costs and consequences measured in terms of\nvisual function and adverse events will be presented as a\ncost-consequence analysis. Where appropriate uncertainty\nwill be explored using similar approaches to those out-\nlines above.\n9. Sample size\nIt was estimated that sixty-four participants will be\nrequired in each group, assuming a common standard\ndeviation of 12 ETDRS points in these two randomised\ngroups, to detect a 6 ETDRS score difference (an effect size\nof 0.5) using a two sample two sided t-test at a 5% level of\nsignificance and 80% power (128 patients). This calcula-\ntion was based on estimated mean post treatment EDTRS\nvisual acuity scores and the corresponding SDs for each\nintervention arm from published studies of alternative\ninterventions for macular hole surgery [22,23]. To allow\nfor a loss to follow up of 10% we aim to recruit a total of\n140 participants into the trial.\nFor the subgroup analysis of stage, if 70% of the partici-\npants are recruited with the more severe stage 3 macular\nholes, the study will have 80% power to detect an effect\nsize of 0.6. If a common standard deviation of 12 points\nis assumed, there will be sufficient power to detect a mean\ndifference of 7 EDTRS letters between the randomised\ngroups.\n10. Organisation\n10.1 Local organisation\nEach collaborating centre will identify a clinical co-ordina-\ntor. The responsibilities of this person will be to 1) estab-\nlish the trial locally, 2) take responsibility for clinical\naspects of the trial locally (for example, if any particular\nconcerns emerge), 3) notify the Trial Office of any sus-Page 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:61 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/61pected unexpected serious adverse event which might be\nrelated to trial participation, 4) ensure masking of the\noptometrist and participant to the allocated surgery.\nEach participating centre will appoint a study optometrist\nto co-ordinate the day-to-day aspects of the trial. The\nresponsibilities of this person are 1) to conduct visual\nassessment of the participants involved in the trial, 2) tel-\nephone the Trial Office to obtain randomisation and allo-\ncate treatment for participants enrolled in the study, and\nto let the vitreo-retinal surgeon know about it before the\nsurgery, 3) arrange follow-up appointments, 4) keep reg-\nular contact with the local clinical co-ordinator, with noti-\nfication of any problem or unexpected development, 5)\nmaintain regular contact with the Trial Office, 6) provide\ninformation about the trial to the participants, 7) ensure\nCRFs are completed and sent to the Trial Office, 8) ensure\nthat enrolled participants will undergo macular hole sur-\ngery within 2 weeks from the baseline assessment, 9) be\nmasked to the allocated treatment, and 10) clarify the sit-\nuation when the Trial Office fails to make a contact with a\nlocal participant, getting in touch by phone or a visit, if\nnecessary.\n10. 2 Trial co-ordination\n10. 2. 1. The Trial Office\nThe Trial Office at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised\nTrials (CHaRT), at the Health Services Research Unit, Uni-\nversity of Aberdeen, will provide the day-to-day support to\nthe clinical centres. CHaRT will be responsible for collec-\ntion of data (in collaboration with the local study optom-\netrists), data processing and analysis. It will be responsible\nfor randomisation, distribution and collation of CRFs and\nquestionnaires.\n10. 2. 2. The Project Management Group\nThe day to day running of the trial will be co-ordinated by\nits Project Management Group. This consists of the chief\ninvestigator Noemi Lois, together with Jennifer Burr, John\nNorrie, Luke Vale, Jonathan Cook, Alison McDonald, Gla-\ndys McPherson, Charles Boachie and Laura Ternent.\n10.3 Data and safety monitoring\n10. 3. 1. The Data Monitoring Committee\nThe data monitoring committee (DMC) will comprise of\na statistician, Prof. Gordon Murray (chair) and by two vit-\nreo-retinal surgeons, Mr William Aylward and Mr Tom\nWilliamson.\n10. 3. 2. Other safety concerns\nCollaborators and participants can contact the trial office\nor the chief investigator about any worries they may have\nabout the trial.\nFILMS will be conducted according to the MRC Good\nClinical Practice Guidelines (1998) and the Data Protec-\ntion Act (1998). Approval of The Multicentre Research\nEthics Committee, the Local Ethics Committees and local\nhospital trusts of each participating centre has been\nobtained.\nPublication\nThe success of the trial depends entirely on the collabora-\ntion of a large number of participants, and a group of Vit-\nreo-Retinal surgeons and optometrists. For this reason,\nchief credit for the trial will be given, not to the commit-\ntees or central organisers, but to all those who have collab-\norated in the trial (the FILMS Study Group). The trial's\npublication policy is described in detail in the Site File and\nfollows the rules of the International Committee of Med-\nical Journal Editors. The results of the trial will be reported\nfirst to trial collaborators. The main report will be drafted\nby the Project Management Group, and circulated to all\nclinical co-ordinators and members of the DMC for com-\nments. The final version will be agreed by all before sub-\nmission for publication, on behalf of the collaboration.\nTo safeguard the integrity of the main trial, reports of\nexplanatory or satellite studies would not be submitted\nfor publication without prior discussion with the Project\nManagement Group.\nOnce the main report has been published, a summary will\nbe sent to the GP of participants involved in the trial and\nto individual participants' or relatives' who had indicated\nthey would wish to receive one.\nAbbreviations Used\nFTMH: Full-thickness macular hole; RCT: Randomised\ncontrolled trials; ILM: Internal limiting membrane;\nFILMS: Full-thickness macular hole and Internal Limiting\nMembrane peeling Study; UK: United Kingdom; HRQOL:\nHealth related quality of life; QALY: Quality adjusted life\nyear; RPE: Retinal pigment epithelium; CHaRT: Centre for\nHealthcare Randomised Trials; CRF: Case report forms;\nAREDS: Age-related eye disease study; CEACs: Cost-effec-\ntiveness acceptability curves.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nNL conceived the study, participated in its design and\ncoordination and drafted this manuscript.
