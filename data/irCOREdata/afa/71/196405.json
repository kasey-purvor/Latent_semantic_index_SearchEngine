These depot-specific effects appear to include\nthe relatively understudied epicardial AT depot. This site has\nalso been linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) because clinical studies have noted a strong correlation\nbetween epicardial AT fat mass, central abdominal fat, and\nthe associated risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes\nmellitus (T2DM) (4\u20136).\nIn understanding the biology of epicardial AT, studies by\nMazurek et al. (7) compared the expressionof pathogenic factors\nbetween epicardial AT and sc fat derived from the thigh of cor-\nonary artery disease (CAD) patients undergoing coronary artery\nbypass grafting (CABG). These studies highlighted the potential\nimportance of the inflammatory response of epicardial tissue,\nwhich may therefore represent a negative influence on car-\ndiovascular function; this finding is affirmed by our previous\nstudies, which highlighted a similar adipocytokine profile in\nepicardial and omental AT, the latter of which is closely linked\nto CVD (7, 8).\nIn addressing the mechanisms of inflammation, our previous\nstudies demonstrated that human isolated abdominal sc adipo-\ncytes possess many of the key components of the nuclear fac-\ntor-\u0001B (NF\u0001B) inflammatory pathway (9, 10). This is supported\nfurther by both human (11) and murine studies (12, 13).\nInnate immunity represents one of the potential pathways for\nproinflammatory cytokine release, and subsequent increase in\nCVD risk, with increasing adiposity (14). Innate immunity can\nbe activated via the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize\nantigens such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viral CpG-rich DNA,\nandzymosan,allowingarapidreactionto infection(15).Activation\nof TLRs leads to translocation of NF\u0001B into the nucleus to initiate\nthe transcription of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-\u0004 (16) and the release of\nIL-6, TNF-\u0004, and resistin, as noted in human adipocyte studies (9,\n10). These findings indicate increased activation of the innate im-\nmune pathway in response to LPS (endotoxin) in vitro; however,\nthis inflammatory responsemayalsooccur in vivo, through stim-\nulation of the TLRs by gut-derived LPS. Such in vivo observa-\ntions have previously been reported in CVD and T2DM subjects\nas well as subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, In which\nsoluble CD-14 (sCD-14), amonocyticmarker for LPS activity, is\nup-regulated (1, 9, 17).\nAs such, the interaction between fat mass, inflammatory re-\nsponse, and endotoxin has clear implications for the immune\nsystem. In addition, endotoxemia may aggravate hyperinsulin-\nemia\/ insulin resistance because studies have shown a direct link\nbetween increasing systemic LPS and the secretion of insulin as\nwell as association studies between LPS and insulin (9, 18). This\nmay therefore form a positive feed-forward mechanism leading\nto insulin resistance, the oversecretion of insulin, and subsequent\ninflammation.\nTo shed light on the function of epicardial fat in CAD and\nnon-CAD patients and the signaling pathways that may lead to\nan inflammatory response, we sought here to: 1) investigate sys-\ntemic LPS levels in preoperative CABG patients compared with\nage and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls, 2) examine\nthe protein expression of key inflammatory signaling molecules\nsuch as NF\u0001B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in epicardial\nATcomparedwithpaired sc thighAT, and3) investigate the gene\nexpression of TLR-2 and -4 and determine any correlations with\nmarkers of inflammation, such as TNF-\u0004, and markers of\nmacrophages.\nSubjects and Methods\nTissue collection\nPaired human epicardial and thigh AT biopsies were taken from a\nsubgroupof theCADpatientsundergoingCABG(age63.9\u00029.2yr;BMI\n27.1\u00023.5kg\/m2, n\u000116). Epicardial biopsieswere taken approximately\n1 h after anesthetic. Thigh AT biopsies were taken when the section of\nsaphenous veinwasobtained, 30\u201345minafter anesthesia. For non-CAD\npatients nonpaired epicardial and thigh biopsies were taken from dif-\nferent patients. Epicardial biopsies were taken approximately 1 h after\nanesthetic from patients with no history of CVD disease who were un-\ndergoing valve replacement. Subcutaneous thigh tissue was taken from\nnon-CAD patients undergoing elective surgery. All tissues were flash\nfrozen immediately. All studies were performed with the approval of the\nlocal ethics committee with informed consent being obtained from all\nsubjects before enrollment. Patients were on a range of medications as\noutlined in Table 1. Diabetic patients were excluded from this study.\nSerum collection\nFasted blood samples (n\u0001 72) were taken before surgery, and serum\nlevels were analyzed for a panel of proteins [C-reactive protein (CRP),\nCD-14, adiponectin, and insulin] and compared with non-CAD and\nnondiabetic control subjects, which were age, gender, and BMImatched\nwith no previous history of CVD (Table 2).\nProtein determination and Western blot analysis\nHuman ATwas homogenized and resuspended in radioimmunopre-\ncipitation assay buffer, as previously detailed (19). Protein concentra-\ntions were determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay kit\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) (20). Western blot analysis was\nperformed using a method previously described (21). In brief, 10\u201330 \u0005g\nof protein were loaded on to a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (10\u201312%;\nGeneFlow, Leicestershire, UK). Protein expression ofNF\u0001B (1:250, TCS\nCellworks, Buckingham,UK), inhibitory-\u0001Bkinase (IKK)-\u00df (1:500; TCS\nCellworks), and IKK\u0004 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was assessed\nusing mouse monoclonal antibodies. A polyclonal, phosphospecific,\nanti-JNK-1 and -2 antibody was also used (1:1750; BioSource Inter-\nnational, Camarillo, CA). Equal protein loading was confirmed by ex-\namining \u0004-tubulin protein expression (1:5000; The Binding Site,\nBirmingham, UK). No statistical difference was observed in \u0004-tubulin\nexpression for all samples analyzed. For CAD patients (n\u0001 4), paired sc\nand epicardial AT was used. Epicardial from a further four non-CAD\npatients were used as controls. A chemiluminescent detection system,\nECL\/ECL\u0004 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK), en-\nabled visualization of bands, whereas intensity was determined using\ndensitometry (Genesnap; Syngene, Cambridge, UK).\nAssessment of NF\u0001B activity\nNF\u0001B activity was assessed with Trans-AM NF\u0001B p65 transcription\nfactorassaykit (ActiveMotif,Rixensart,Belgium;detection limit\u000340ngof\nwhole cell extract). In brief, a 96-well plate coated with an oligonucle-\notide for the NF\u0001B consensus binding site was incubated with 1.5 \u0005g of\nAT extract for 1 h. The NF\u0001B complex bound to the oligonucleotide is\ndetected by binding of the NF\u0001B p65 antibody. A secondary antibody\nconjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added. Activity was deter-\nmined by luminescence (22).\nRNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR\nRNA was extracted from samples using RNeasy lipid tissue kit\n(QIAGEN, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n262 Baker et al. Inflammation in Epicardial Adipose Tissue J Clin Endocrinol Metab, January 2009, 94(1):261\u2013267\nExtraction was followed by a DNase digestion step to remove any con-\ntaminating genomic DNA. RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop\nND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech, International, East Sussex, UK),\nand 1 \u0005g of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using Su-\nperscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and random\nhexamers, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time PCR\nwas performed in a reaction mix containing TaqMan universal PCR\nmaster mix (AmpErase UNG, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),\n100\u2013200 nM TaqMan probe, 900 nM primers, and 25 ng cDNA for all\nPCRs. All reactions were multiplexed with the housekeeping gene 18S,\nprovidedas apreoptimized control probe (AppliedBiosystems), enabling\ndata to be expressed as \u0006-threshold cycle (CT) values (where \u0005CT\u0001 CT\nof 18S subtracted from CT of gene of interest). Measurements were\ncarried out on at least three occasions for each sample. Reactions were\nas follows: 50 C for 2 min, 95 C for 10 min; then 40 cycles of 95 C for\n15 sec and 60 C for 1min. Adiponectin and CD-45mRNAwere assayed\nusing probes of previously described sequences (8). All other gene ex-\npression was assessed using predesigned gene expression assay-on-de-\nmand kits (Applera).\nSerum sample analysis\nSerum samples were analyzed for the determination of insulin (Linco\nResearch, St. Charles, MO), CRP (Life Diagnostics Inc., West Chester,\nPA), sCD-14 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), adiponectin (Linco Re-\nsearch). Insulin, CRP, sCD-14, and adiponectin levels were analyzed\nby a solid-phase ELISA [insulin: coefficient of variation (CV) intraassay\n5.96%, interassay 10.3 \u0002 0.9%; CRP: intraassay CV 4.4%, interassay\nCV 3.3%; sCD-14: intraassay 5.4%, interassay 6.3%; adiponectin: in-\ntraassay CV 3.4%, interassay CV 5.7%]. For these studies, anthropo-\nmetric data were collected and are detailed in Table 2. Fasting glucose\nwas analyzed using a glucose oxidase method (YSL 200 STAT plus;\nYellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH).\nMeasurement of circulating endotoxin levels\nSerum endotoxin was assayed using a chromogenic limulus amebo-\ncyte lysate (LAL) test, which is a quantitative test for Gram-negative\nbacterial endotoxin (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Gram-negative bac-\nterial endotoxin catalyzes the activation of a proenzyme in the LAL. The\ninitial rate of activation is directly determined by the concentration of\nendotoxin. The activated enzyme catalyzes the splitting of p-nitroaniline\nfrom the colorless substrate Ac-lle-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA. The p-nitroani-\nline released was measured photometrically at 405\u2013410 nm after termi-\nnation of the reaction. The correlation between the absorbance and the\nendotoxin concentration is linear in the 0.1\u20131.0 EU\/ml range (intraassay\nCV 3.9\u0002 0.46%, interassay CV 9.6\u0002 0.75%). For the purposes of this\nstudy, all samples were run in duplicate within the same plate; therefore,\nno interassay variabilitywas observed in this study.Our previous studies\nassessed specificity of the assay as well as cross-reactivity (9). In brief, to\nassess recovery of endotoxin within the assay, known concentrations of\nendotoxin (Escherichia coli origin) (0.25 and 1.00 EU\/ml) were added to\ndiluted, pooled plasma to determinewhether the expected concentration\ncorrelated closely with the actual observed value and whether there was\nany interference from plasma contents. Lyophilized endotoxin (E. coli\norigin) was used to generate a standard curve in accordance with the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. In plasma, the recovery of spiked endo-\ntoxin was 82.0 \u0002 3.3% efficient. Plate-to-plate variability within the\nsame experiment was 7.4 \u0002 0.9%. These findings were similar to\nthose observed from assessment by Cambrex. Experiments were also\nperformed to assess cross-reactivity between glucose, mixed triglyc-\nerides (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), and LPS in the LAL test kit.\nSaline (endotoxin level\u0003 0.1 EU\/ml; Sigma Aldrich) was spiked with\n5 and 20 mM glucose, 1 and 5 mM lipid, and a combination of both.\nNo interference was observed for any of the tested concentrations of\nlipid and\/or glucose.\nStatistical analysis\nDetermination of correlations in gene expression analysis was per-\nformed using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, whereas due to the non-\nnormal distribution of serum LPS, a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coef-\nficient was used to determine any correlations involving these data (SPSS\n14.0 for Windows; SPSS UK Ltd., Surrey, UK). Significance in protein\nexpressiondata andactivitywasdeterminedbypairedandunpaired t test\nas appropriate and in serumanalysis byunpaired student t test (SPSS14.0\nfor Windows; SPSS UK Ltd., Surrey, UK).\nTABLE 1.

The higher levels are\nstatistically significant for all proteins examined when assessed\nby Student\u2019s t test (Fig. 2).\nmRNA expression of TLRs, TNF-\u0006, and CD-68 in\nepicardial and thigh AT taken from CAD subjects\nTNF\u0004 and adiponectin mRNA levels were compared be-\ntween epicardial and thigh AT from CAD patients. TNF\u0004\nmRNA levels were similar between depots (\u0005Ct 19.72 and\n19.76 for epicardial and thigh depots, respectively). Adi-\nponectin was determined to be expressed in epicardial fat at\n58% of the level in thigh fat, but this trend did not attain\nstatistical significance (P \u0003 0.09).\nToascertain the importanceof themacrophage cell type in the\ninflammatory process within the AT sites, we used CD-68 and\nCD-45 as markers for macrophage presence. Assessment of\nCD-68 mRNA expression highlighted a strong positive correla-\ntion with both TLR-2 and -4 in the epicardial AT (TLR-2: r \u0001\n0.94, P \u0003 0.001; TLR-4: r \u0001 0.95, P \u0003 0.001, Fig. 3A). These\npositive correlationswere also observed in thigh tissue, although\nthe correlations were less pronounced (TLR-2: r \u0001 0.75, P \u0003\n0.001; TLR-4: r \u0001 0.65, P \u0003 0.01; Fig. 3B).

Due to the lack of fascia\nbetween the adipocyte and myocardial layers (8), this inflam-\nmation may have implications for cardiac function. Adipokines\nsecreted by epicardial adipocytes could readily interact with the\nadjacent cardiomyocytes,whichmay influencemyocardial func-\ntion, as shown in previous rodent studies (23\u201325). Additionally\nthese studies determined that mRNA expression of TLR-2,\nTLR-4, and TNF-\u0004 correlated closely with the levels of CD-68\nmRNA in bothAT depots taken fromCAD subjects, implicating\nthe macrophage as the protagonist in this increased inflamma-\ntory activation. Furthermore, our data indicated that increased\nsystemic LPS levels in CAD vs. non-CAD subjects may represent\nan initiator of such inflammation.\nThese studies indicate that in an inflammatory state, as rep-\nresented byCAD, the differences between theATdepots remain,\nthus demonstrating the intrinsic differences in the depots\u2019 re-\nsponse to the disease state. In this study the sc thigh tissue ex-\npressed consistently lower levels of the inflammatory mediators\nthan epicardial AT, suggesting that it remains relatively benign in\ncomparison with abdominal and, specifically, epicardial AT. The\nhigh levels of both NF\u0001B and JNK pathway components in the\nepicardial depot and the increasedNF\u0001Bactivation, in comparison\nwith the paired sc tissue, indicated that itmaywell be the activation\nof these pathways that is responsible for driving the inflammatory\nprofile of gene expression that has been observed previously (7, 8).\nFurthermore, we addressed the influence of macrophages\nin this inflammatory process via gene expression studies, and\nthese identified that TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression is closely\nlinked to the presence of activated macrophages, with partic-\nularly strong correlations noted in epicardial AT. In conjunc-\ntion with other studies (7), our previous findings (8) suggest\nthat the epicardial depot exhibits a particularly high level of\nmacrophage infiltration, thus supporting the concept that the\nmacrophage plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response\nin epicardial AT.\nThe serum studies further confirmed previous observations\n(8) that the CAD patients were in a state of low-grade inflam-\n12\n12.5\n13\n13.5\n14\n14.5\n15\n9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12\nTLR-2 r =0.29, P=0.25\nTLR-4 r =0.48, P<0.05\nn=18\n14\n14.5\n15\n15.5\n16\n16.5\n17\n17.5\n18\n18.5\n19\n9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12\nr =0.64\nP<0.01\nn =18\n16\n16.5\n17\n17.5\n18\n18.5\n19\n19.5\n20\n8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\n12\n12.5\n13\n13.5\n14\n14.5\n15\n15.5\n16\n8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\nr =0.42\nP=0.09\nn =17\nTLR-2 r =0.83, P<0.01\nTLR-4 r =0.69, P<0.01\nn=17\nA B\nC D\n\u0394CT(CD-68)\n\u0394CT(CD-68)\n\u0394CT(CD-68)\n\u0394CT(CD-68)\n\u0394C\nT\n(T\nLR\n)\n\u0394C\nT\n(T\nLR\n)\n\u0394C\nT(\nTN\nF-\n\u03b1)\n\u0394C\nT(\nTN\nF-\n\u03b1)\nFIG. 4.

In addition, the CAD patients were observed to\nhave significantly higher levels of both sCD-14 and LPS when\ncompared with healthy, matched controls. Recent studies have\nshown serum LPS levels to be elevated in diabetic subjects (9),\nsuggesting that LPSmaybe involved in the chronic inflammation\nobserved in T2DM. Creely and colleagues (9, 10) demonstrated\nan up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in AT after LPS\nstimulation,which appears to bemediated viaNF\u0001Bactivity.On\nthis basis, the raised LPS levels observed in the CAD patient\ncohortmaydrive an inflammatory phenotype in the epicardial as\nwell as other AT depots. Further studies in mice have linked\nhyperendotoxinemia with an increase in gut permeability result-\ning from obesity (26). Whereas the patient and control cohorts\nin this studywere BMImatched, the possibility of a link between\nthe raised levels of LPS in the CAD cohort and the chronic in-\nflammation associatedwithCVD remains an intriguing one. To-\ngether these results suggest that the epicardial ATmay represent\na further site for therapeutic action in CAD. This is reinforced\ndue to the current findings highlighting increased expression of\nboth JNK and NF\u0001B, with a clear association between macro-\nphage and inflammation in epicardial fat. Therefore, it seems\napparent that the use of antiinflammatory therapeutics, which\nhave been shown to down-regulate these inflammatory path-\nways such as salicylates and statins (27), may exert additional\nbeneficial effects on the local metabolism of AT around and\nwithin the heart to further reduce detrimental effects on cardiac\nfunction in patients with CAD. However, further studies are\nrequired to explore this line of research.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the operating staff at University Hospital Birmingham for the\ncollectionof the tissues.Wealso thankDunhillMedicalTrust for their grant\nsupport as well as the British Medical Association, Overweight and Heart\nDisease Research Trust, Arden Medical Research Fund, British Medical\nAssociation: Lansdell and Lawson, and the British Heart Foundation.\nAddress all correspondence and requests for reprints to: Dr. P.
