In this study the electron energy\ndeposition derived from thermospheric nitric oxide (NO) measurements is compared with\nthe electron energy deposition derived from X-ray bremsstrahlung measurements. The\nelectron energy deposition is derived from nitric oxide densities by use of a photochemical\nmodel for nitric oxide and is referred to as the modeled energy deposition. The\ncomparisons are made for the beginning of five geomagnetic storms in 1998: 21 March, 2\nMay, 14 June, 26 June, and 16 July. By using these quite different methods to derive the\ntotal electron energy deposition (4\u2013100 keV), the results show that we have a generally\ngood understanding of the physics and chemistry of the energy transfer from electron\nprecipitation in the lower thermosphere. The comparisons also show some discrepancies.\nThe modeled energy deposition is typically larger than the energy deposition derived\nfromX-ray bremsstrahlung in the beginning of the stormperiod,whereas later on in the storm\nthe energy deposition derived from X-ray measurements is largest. The cases where the\nmodeled energy deposition is largest is probably due to production of NO occurring before\nthe bremsstrahlung measurements. The systematic underestimate of the calculated energy\ndeposition could be due to uncertainties in the reaction rates or in the characteristic electron\nenergy used in the photochemical model. The effects from horizontal neutral wind on theNO\ngas from the production on the nightside to the observations on the dayside can also be a\nsource of discrepancy.\nCitation: S\u00e6tre, C., C. A.

The\nground state nitrogen (N(4S)) will also cause destruction\nof NO; thus the increase in NO in the lower thermosphere is\nrelated to the relative amount of excited nitrogen atoms to\nground state nitrogen (N(2D)\/N(4S)) [Barth, 1992]. Ener-\ngetic photoelectrons and precipitating electrons cause exci-\ntation and ionization in the upper atmosphere. The main\nsources of N(2D) are the results of dissociation of N2 by\nenergetic electrons, recombination of NO+ and reaction of\nN2\n+ ions with atomic oxygen. It has been shown that the\nlarger amounts of NO at higher latitudes are well correlated\nwith the intensity of the auroral electron precipitation [e.g.,\nSiskind et al., 1989a; Baker et al., 2001; Petrinec et al.,\n2003; S\u00e6tre et al., 2004].\n[3] Owing to the rather long lifetime of NO (about 1 day\nat \u0001105 km altitude), the amounts produced during the\nnight by auroral electrons will have time to rotate with the\nEarth toward the dayside without experiencing strong decay\neffects. The lower thermospheric neutral gas will be subject\nto neutral winds, and previous studies have shown evidence\nof an equatorward drift of the NO gas from the nightside to\nthe dayside [Barth et al., 2003; S\u00e6tre et al., 2004].\n[4] Baker et al.

They also\ncompared the daily NO density with the hemispherical\npower index (HPI) derived from NOAA (National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration) measurements. The HPI\nis an estimate of the total incoming power into the upper\natmosphere and is normally dominated by electrons with\nenergy 1\u201310 keV. These comparisons gave a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.629.\n[5] The statistical analysis of Petrinec et al. [2003]\ncompared three years (March 1998 through March 2001)\nof NO observations made by SNOE\/UVS, with the daily\naveraged fluxes of X-ray bremsstrahlung measured by\nPIXIE (Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment) on\nboard the Polar spacecraft. When the NO data from SNOE\/\nUVS were delayed 1 day with respect to the PIXIE data, the\ncorrelation coefficients at the altitudes of maximum NO\ndensity (106\u2013110 km) also were \u00010.6.\n[6] In a more detailed analysis, S\u00e6tre et al. [2004]\ncompared the electron energy deposition derived from\ntime-integrated X-ray fluxes measured by PIXIE and the\nNO density measured by SNOE\/UVS for the beginning of a\ngeomagnetic storm on 2 May 1998. The NO density\nobserved by SNOE\/UVS on the dayside was produced by\nelectron precipitation the preceding night. The PIXIE meas-\nurements were integrated in geographical boxes for consec-\nutively longer intervals of time, tracking all the energy\ninput, from night to day, into the geographic areas beneath\nthe separate SNOE orbits. The linear relationship between\nthe NO density and the time-integrated energy deposition at\n106 km altitude had a correlation coefficient of 0.91.\n[7] Cleary [1986] compared NO densities as a function of\naltitude (105\u2013125 km), measured by a rocket-borne spec-\ntrometer on 10 August 1982 launched at 0335 LT, with NO\ncalculated from a one-dimensional photochemical model.\nThe model was a prior version of the one used in this study.\nIt included vertical diffusion of NO and N(4S) and calcu-\nlated the photoelectron flux from the photoelectron model\nof Strickland and Meier [1982]. The branching ratios of\nN(4S) and N(2D) from the dissociation of N2 from\nenergetic electrons were 0.4 and 0.6, respectively [Strickland\nand Meier, 1982]. The photodissociation frequency of NO\nwas 5.7\u0002 10\u00036 s\u00031 [Nicolet and Cieslik, 1980]. The compar-\nisons showed a good fit to themeasured NO density, when the\nsimulated aurora had a characteristic energy of 10 keV and\ncontinuous energy flux of 0.5 ergs cm\u00032 s\u00031. The latitude,\nsolar zenith angle, and local time used in the model were the\nsame as those during the time of the rocket launch.\n[8] Siskind et al. [1989a] calculated the NO density using\na previous version of the time-dependent, one-dimensional\nphotochemical model used here [Bailey et al., 2002]. The\nHPI derived from NOAA 6 and 7 particle measurements\nspecified the time history of the electron precipitation, with\nflux and characteristic electron energies updated every hour.\nThe auroral particle precipitation pattern was derived from a\nstatistical model. The calculated NO density was compared\nwith NO measurements from SME (Solar Mesosphere\nExplorer), for the areas along the SME orbital track at\nhigher latitudes. The comparisons were made for the auroral\nstorm of 19 September 1984. The NCAR thermospheric\ngeneral circulation model (TGCM) was used to calculate the\nresponse of the background neutral atmosphere. They saw\nan increase in both the modeled and the observed NO\ndensity due to the storm. However, the magnitude and the\namplitude of the storm increase of the modeled NO density,\nsignificantly exceeded the observed NO density. The over-\nestimate was thought to be due to the yield of N(2D) of 60\u2013\n70% from the dissociation of N2 by energetic electrons\nbeing too large. Another explanation for the overestimate\nwas that the vertical advection, which was not accounted for\nin the model, could be a significant loss mechanism of NO.\n[9] Bailey et al. [2002] made a new version of the time-\ndependent, one-dimensional photochemical model for nitric\noxide. The model calculates the NO density produced by\nphotoelectrons and auroral electron precipitation. It includes\ncalculations of the energetic electron energy deposition at\neach time step. The model assumes a continuous electron\nprecipitation in the local time sector between 2100 and\n2400, with a Maxwellian energy distribution with a char-\nacteristic energy of 4 keV. The electron energy flux is\nadjusted until the calculated NO density at 110 km altitude\nequals the NO-density measured by SNOE\/UVS [Solomon\net al., 1996]. The model includes turbulent and diffusive\ntransport of the NO gas but does not include horizontal\ntransport of the neutral gas.\n[10] In this study the electron energy deposition is derived\nfrom SNOE\/UVS nitric oxide measurements by use of this\nphotochemical model. This energy deposition is referred to\nas the modeled energy deposition. The electron energy\ndeposition is also derived from X-ray bremsstrahlung meas-\nurements [\u00d8stgaard et al., 2000] provided by the PIXIE\ncamera on the Polar spacecraft [Imhof et al., 1995]. This\nstudy compares the electron energy deposition derived from\nthese two separate methods. The comparisons are made for\nthe beginning of five geomagnetic storm time events in\n1998 when Polar was at apogee approximately 9 RE above\nthe Northern Hemisphere. PIXIE had a global view of the\nnorthern auroral oval for \u000110 hours for each apogee pass.\n[11] Four of the five events in this study have rather quiet\ngeomagnetic conditions prior to the storm onset. When the\nresults of the comparisons are interpreted, we use the AE\nindex from the SuperMAG database [Gjerloev et al., 2004]\nto consider the possible contribution from electron precip-\nitation prior to the PIXIE observations.\n2. Model Calculations and SNOE\/UVS\nMeasurements of NO\n[12] The model used in this study is an improved version\nof a photochemical model [Cleary, 1986; Siskind et al.,\n1989a, 1989b, 1990, 1995; Barth, 1992], with updated\nreaction rate coefficients and photoelectron flux calculations\n[Bailey et al., 2002]. It is a time-dependent, one-dimension-\nal model of nitric oxide that includes energetic electron\ntransport, both for photoelectrons and auroral electrons. The\nmodel uses photochemical equilibrium to calculate the\nvertical profiles of NO, N(4S,2D), and the ions NO+, O2\n+,\nN2\n+, O+, and O+(2D). The photochemical model includes the\nvertical transport of NO and N(4S). The extreme ultraviolet\nsolar flux (20\u2013103 nm) is calculated using the model of\nHinteregger et al. [1981], with the 10.7 cm solar radio flux\nas input parameter. The solar soft X-ray irradiance used in\nthe model is measured directly by sensors on board the\nSNOE spacecraft [Bailey et al., 2000]. The flux of the\nphotoelectrons is calculated using the \u2018\u2018glow\u2019\u2019 model of\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n2 of 10\nA04302\nSolomon et al. [1988], where the electron transport algo-\nrithm is a two-stream code of Banks and Nagy [1970]. The\nmodel atmosphere used for the neutral constituents and for\nthe temperature is the NRLMSISE-00 model [Picone et al.,\n2002], where hourly values of the 10.7 cm flux and the Ap\ngeomagnetic index are used as inputs.\n[13] We use NO observations from SNOE\/UVS as input to\nthe model [Barth et al., 2003]. SNOE had a Sun-synchronous\norbit at 556 km altitude with the ascending node at 1030 LT.\nThe nitric oxide density, as a function of altitude, was\nmeasured by limb observations of the fluorescence of NO\nmolecules by solar radiation. Thus the observations were\nmade only on the dayside of the orbit. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of the NO densitymeasured by SNOE 26 June 1998,\n1251 UT (at 55\u0001N), as a function of latitude and of altitude.\nThe maximum NO density is at auroral latitudes and most\noften at 106\u2013110 km altitude. The larger amounts of NO at\nhigher latitudes have been produced by auroral electron\nprecipitation during the night and then the NO gas rotated\nwith the Earth over to the dayside where it was observed by\nSNOE\/UVS. In the model, the areas beneath the SNOE orbit\nare assumed to have experienced 3 hours of precipitation in\nthe local time sector from 2100 to 2400 LT during the\npreceding night. The precipitating electrons are set to a\nMaxwellian energy distribution with a 4 keV characteristic\nenergy. The initial condition for the electron flux is 1mWm\u00032\nbetween 2100 and 2400 LT. The model results are compared\nwith the nitric oxide density for each SNOE orbit at 110 km\naltitude, for 5\u0001 latitude bins between 50\u0001N and 70\u0001N. The\nratio between the observed and the calculated NO densities is\nused in a new estimate of the electron flux, and the model\ncalculation is repeated until the electron flux gives a result that\nis consistent with the SNOE\/UVS observations [Barth et al.,\n2004]. The electron flux is multiplied with the 3 hours of\nprecipitation time so that we have the total electron energy\ndeposition per unit area independent of the actual length of the\nprecipitation event. The calculations include the different loss\nprocesses of NO, some of which transform NO into other odd\nnitrogen species. Photodissociation of NO by solar far ultra-\nviolet radiation gives the product of ground state nitrogen\nwhich will react with another NO molecule and produce\nmolecular nitrogen and atomic oxygen. The effective lifetime\nof this reduction of NO is 19.6 hours [Minschwaner and\nSiskind, 1993; Murray, 1994; Siskind, 2000]. The photodis-\nsociation frequency at altitudes where the solar UV radiation\nis unattenuated is 7.34 \u0002 10\u00036 s\u00031. Two nitric oxide mole-\ncules are destroyed as a result of each photodissociation. This\napplies to solar-illuminated NOwhen there are no production\nprocesses or when NO is in equilibrium with production and\nloss mechanisms. At the equator, with daylight of 12 hours,\nthe excess nitric oxide amount decreases to 54% of its initial\nvalue during a 24-hour period [Barth and Bailey, 2004]. The\n35 reaction equations for the model are listed in Table 1 in the\nwork of Barth [1992] and the updated reaction rates are listed\nin the appendix of Bailey et al. [2002] and also in the work of\nBarth et al. [1999]. The model does not include calculations\nof the horizontal transport of the NO gas due to neutral winds.\nIn this study the latitude profiles of the total electron energy\ndeposition are also compared so that possible meridional drift\nof the NO gas can be considered.\n3. Electron Energy From X-Ray Bremsstrahlung\nMeasurements\n[14] The X-ray camera PIXIE on board the Polar satellite\ndetects X-rays in the energy range of \u00012\u201322 keV. When\nprecipitating electrons are slowed down in the atmosphere by\nmolecules and atoms, X-ray photons are emitted. The energies\nof the emitted X-rays are dependent on the energy of the\nprecipitating electrons. The X-rays detected by PIXIE are\ndivided into six energy bins to improve the statistics. Thus we\nfind the energy spectrum of the X-ray bremsstrahlung. There\nis a known relation between the X-ray energy spectrum and\nthe precipitating electron energy spectrum [Berger and Seltzer,\n1972]. To obtain the electron energy spectrum from the PIXIE\nX-ray data, we use a look-up table based on an electron-\nphoton transport code (developed from a neutron transport\ncode [Lorence, 1992]). This look-up table gives values of the\nX-ray fluxes emitted at different zenith angles for different\nexponential electron energy spectra. This method determines\nthe electron spectrum from 4 keV to 100 keV which yields an\nX-ray spectrum that best fits the observed photon spectrum.\nThe electron energy flux can then be calculated by integrating\nthe electrons from 4 to 100 keV. The same is done for the\nspectra from the photochemical model. The lower electron\nenergy is set to 4 keV as PIXIE measures X-rays down to\n\u00012 keV. The electron energy spectra from the PIXIE data are\nrepresented by single or double exponentials, depending\non what best fits the measured X-rays. This method was\ndescribed in more detail by \u00d8stgaard et al. [2000, 2001].\nFigure 1. Nitric oxide density measured by SNOE 26 June\n1998, 1251UT (at 55\u0001N); (top) NO density at 110 km\naltitude as a function of geographic latitude and (bottom)\nNO density at 55\u0001N as a function of altitude.\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n3 of 10\nA04302\n[15] In 1998 the Polar satellite had an apogee above the\nnorthern auroral oval at \u00019 RE. The PIXIE camera had a\nglobal view of the oval for almost 10 hours for each apogee\npass. The PIXIE data have been organized in geographical\nboxes and the electron energy fluxes derived from these\nmeasurements have been integrated over time so that we get\nthe total electron energy deposition over specific areas.\nThese areas are the same as the ones beneath the SNOE\norbits where the photochemical model calculates the neces-\nsary amount of electron energy deposition to produce the\nobserved NO-density on the dayside.\n4. Comparisons\n[16] The five events compared in this study are at the\nbeginning of geomagnetic storms for which the geomag-\nnetic conditions have been rather quiet the preceding day.\nWe tried to select events where the PIXIE measurements\nstarted before the onset of the storm. The AE, AL, and AU\nindices for the five events, and for the day prior to the\nstorm, are plotted in Figure 2. The dashed lines show the\ntime interval where PIXIE was making measurements. For\n21 March there is evidence for some substorm activity the\nprevious day, and there was strong activity starting \u00014 hours\nbefore the PIXIEmeasurements. TheNOdensity observed by\nSNOE may in part have been produced by electron precipi-\ntation in that time range. Thus the modeled energy deposition\nwill tend to be larger than what we are able to derive from the\nPIXIEmeasurements for this day. The 2May event had rather\nquiet conditions prior to the PIXIE measurements. For this\ncase, wewould expect the energy deposition derived from the\nbremsstrahlung spectra to be equal to the modeled energy\ndeposition. For the July and June events there was some\nactivity before the PIXIE measurements, however not as\nsevere as for the March event. Thus we expect the modeled\nenergy deposition to be rather similar to the energy deposition\nderived from PIXIE.\n[17] Figure 3 shows the time-integrated X-ray brems-\nstrahlung intensity (2\u20139 keV) measured by PIXIE (white\nglobe) and the NO density measured by SNOE\/UVS (blue\nglobe). The images are in geographic coordinates. The time\nintervals for the PIXIE measurements, and the times for the\nSNOE observations on the dayside are indicated under each\nplot. The PIXIE images are made from global images and\nshow the accumulated X-ray intensity from the entire time\ninterval. The NO images are made from several SNOE\norbits since SNOE\/UVS did not have a global view. If one\nmoves clockwise from the dark blue sector into the colored\nsector, one first sees the NO density observed in the\nbeginning of the time interval indicated under the plot. This\nNO density will correspond to the time-integrated X-rays\nfor the same areas. When one continues to move clockwise,\none comes to areas where the NO observations were made\nlater in the SNOE time interval. The latest SNOE orbits may\ninclude NO density produced by electron precipitation that\noccurred after the PIXIE measurements. Thus the NO\ndensity from the latest SNOE orbits will correspond to\nmore intense time-integrated X-ray bremsstrahlung than\nwe are able to get from the time-limited PIXIE measure-\nments. However, the images clearly show that both PIXIE\nand SNOE\/UVS observed the results of energetic particle\nprecipitation over the same large-scale areas. Whereas\nPIXIE observed the effects immediately, SNOE observed\nthe increase of the long-lived NO density later on when\nthe precipitation areas had rotated with the Earth over to the\ndayside. In the images for 2 May 1998 we see that the\nmaximum NO-density is south of the maximum time-\nintegrated X-ray bremsstrahlung intensity. This could be\ndue to horizontal transport of NO by neutral winds.\n[18] The total electron energy deposition as a function of\nlatitude (and longitude) is plotted in Figures 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d\nfor the 2 May, 14 June, 26 June, and 16 July 1998, respec-\ntively. The dashed line is the energy derived from nitric oxide\nobservations and the solid line is the energy derived from the\nPIXIE bremsstrahlung measurements. The lower x-axis\nshows the geographic latitude of the area for which we are\ncomparing, and the upper x-axis displays the longitude. The\ntotal energy deposition is given in keV\/cm2. The time written\nin each plot is the time of the SNOE observations (at 70\u0001N).\nExcept for the last two plots of 2May and 26 June and the last\nplot of 16 July, this time is also the end of the interval for\nwhich the PIXIE data have been integrated. For these five\nparticular cases, we assume that the production occurring on\nthe morningside for the current areas after PIXIE stopped\nmeasuring is negligible compared to the previous nightside\nproduction. Thus we include these five orbits in our compar-\nisons for better statistics. There is a generally good corre-\nspondence between the two data sets. However, at higher\nlatitudes the modeled energy deposition sometimes tends to\nbe very low compared to the energy deposition derived from\nPIXIE, whereas at lower latitudes it can even be larger than\nthe PIXIE-derived energy deposition. This is quite often the\ncase for the 21 March 1998 event (not shown), where there\nwas activity prior to the PIXIE measurements. For 2 May,\nwhere the geomagnetic conditions were rather quiet before\nthe PIXIE observations, the energy deposition derived from\nPIXIEwas always larger than themodeled energy deposition.\nFor the other three events, there could be electron precipita-\ntion before the PIXIE measurements, but not as severe as for\nthe 21 March event. The modeled energy depositions for the\nJune events and the 16 July event are sometimes a bit larger\nbut the overall tendency is that the PIXIE derived energy\ndeposition is largest.\n[19] Figure 5 shows the total electron energy deposition,\nmodeled and that derived from PIXIE, beneath the SNOE\norbits for each of the five events. The energy deposition has\nbeen averaged over the latitude interval covered by the\nmeasurements. This comparison would not be as influenced\nby possible meridional wind effects. As time goes on, the\namount of integrated energy deposition increases. In the\nbeginning of the events the modeled energy deposition is\ntypically larger than the energy deposition derived from\nPIXIE. This indicates that the SNOE NO observations\ninclude the energy deposited before PIXIE started measur-\ning. As time goes on, the PIXIE derived energy deposition\nis larger by almost a factor of 2, except for the 21 March\nevent. The total energy deposition derived from PIXIE gives\nthe lower limit of the electron energy input due to the time\nlimitations of the bremsstrahlung observations.\n5. Discussion\n[20] Our results show a generally good correspondence\nbetween the estimates of energy deposition in the Earth\u2019s\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n4 of 10\nA04302\nauroral regions using two completely different methods.\nGiven the success of such comparisons, this work gives us\nconfidence that we have a good basic understanding of the\nphysics and chemistry of electron precipitation and subse-\nquent vertical transport in the lower thermosphere.\n[21] Given the overall agreement, the comparisons none-\ntheless show evidence for a too low electron energy\ndeposition derived from the nitric oxide measurements.\nOne possible reason for this is that the assumption in the\nphotochemical model of a Maxwellian characteristic energy\nof 4 keV, and hence the maximum NO density at 110 km\naltitude, is not always correct. The NO density can have its\nmaximum at other altitudes, and in such cases, the NO\ndensity calculated from the photochemical model will be\ncompared with an observed NO density at 110 km altitude\nwhich is lower than the maximum NO density. Thus the\nelectron energy deposition necessary to produce the calcu-\nlated NO density will be lower than actually was the case.\nFigure 2. AU, AL, and AE index, from SuperMAG, for the five events investigated in this study and\nfor the previous day. The dashed lines indicate the time interval of the PIXIE measurements.\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n5 of 10\nA04302\nTwo altitude profiles of the NO density for the 26 June 1998\nevent, measured by SNOE\/UVS, are shown in Figure 6. The\nratios between the maximum NO density and the density at\n110 km altitude are also given for the two altitude profiles.\nSometimes this ratio can be quite large, as for 55\u0001N (see\nalso Figure 4c, middle right). However, this effect can not\nexplain all the cases where the modeled electron energy is\nvery low compared to the PIXIE-derived energy deposition\n(e.g., the 60\u0001N case, see Figure 4c bottom right). Consid-\nering the fact that SNOE\/UVS would also measure NO\ndensities produced before the beginning of the PIXIE\nmeasurements, the modeled electron energy should not be\nlower than that derived from the X-ray bremsstrahlung\nmeasured for a limited time interval.\n[22] The uncertainty in the nitric oxide density deter-\nmined from SNOE\/UVS observations is discussed by Barth\nand Bailey [2004]. The uncertainty in the instrument cali-\nbration is 14%, the uncertainty in the solar flux at 237 nm is\n7%, and the uncertainty in the molecular parameters used to\ndetermine the nitric oxide fluorescence is 10%, giving a\ncombined uncertainty of about 20%. The uncertainty in the\nX-ray bremsstrahlung determined from PIXIE measure-\nments is low in this study. Since we accumulate the photon\nintensity over long time intervals, the number of counts are\nquite high, and thus the PIXIE measurement uncertainties\nare considered to be negligible compared to the uncertainty\nin deriving the energy spectra. The look up table based on\nthe Lorence code gives the X-ray flux versus zenith angle\nfor different electron spectra. In the very beginning of the\nevents PIXIE had a more slant viewing, and the uncertainty\nin the X-ray flux derived from the look up table is \u000110%.\nFurther on in the observation period the zenith angles are\nnot so large (<40\u0001 \u00b1 7\u0001), and the uncertainty in the X-ray\nflux from the table is less than 5%. This uncertainty should\nnot result in significant systematic errors. The actual fitting\nof the energy spectra to the PIXIE measurements is the main\nuncertainty when deriving the energy deposition from the\nX-ray bremsstrahlung. Considering that we use several\nspectra when deriving the energy deposition and the fact\nthat we integrate only over energies where PIXIE gives\nFigure 3. Time-integrated X-ray bremsstrahlung (\u00012\u20139 keV) from PIXIE measurements (white globe)\nin photons\/(sr cm2), and nitric oxide density at 110 km altitude measured by SNOE\/UVS (blue globe) in\nmolecules\/cm2. The images are in geographic coordinates. The time range for developing each plot is\nwritten beneath each image. If one moves from the dark blue sector into the colored sector, the first part\nof the SNOE image will correspond to the PIXIE observations for the same areas, whereas the last part\nmight contain NO densities produced after PIXIE stopped measuring.\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n6 of 10\nA04302\nreliable information (4\u2013100 keV), the uncertainty of the\nfitting of the spectra is less than 25%. The uncertainties in\nthemethod of deriving electron energy deposition fromX-ray\nbremsstrahlungmeasurements are far from a factor of two and\nare not systematic.\nFigure 4a. Total electron energy deposition for 2 May\n1998 derived from SNOE nitric oxide observations (dashed\nline) and derived from PIXIE measurements (solid line).\nThe latitude and longitude for the areas we are comparing\nare written on the lower and upper x-axis.\nFigure 4b. Same as for Figure 4a but for 14 June 1998.\nFigure 4c. Same as for Figure 4a but for 26 June 1998.\nFigure 4d. Same as for Figure 4a but for 16 July 1998.\nA04302 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: ELECTRON ENERGY DEPOSITION\u2014COMPARISONS\n7 of 10\nA04302\n[23] Another source of discrepancy may be the effects of\nhorizontal transport of the NO gas from north to south. For\nsome of the cases, i.e., the last two plots in Figure 4c, the\nmodeled profile seems to be displaced equatorward relative\nto the PIXIE energy profile. This could be the effect of\nhorizontal neutral winds. When modeling the energy input\ninto the atmosphere from particle precipitation by use of\nphotochemistry, the inclusion of neutral wind parameters\nwould be helpful if only just to clarify the extent to which\nthe discrepancies are due to meridional transport of NO.\n[24] Another possible source of error may be that the\ncalculations of NO density from electron precipitation are\nstrongly dependent on the branching ratios for N(4S) and\nN(2D), especially from the dissociative recombination of\nionized nitric oxide [Barth et al., 1999]. The branching ratio\nfor this reaction has been measured very precisely in the\nlaboratory [Vejby-Christensen et al., 1998] and found to be\n0.85 for N(2D) with an uncertainty of 7%. A sensitivity test\nwas conducted with the nitric oxide photochemical model\nusing the extremes of branching ratio measurement. The\nresult was a variation of 20% in the nitric oxide density\ncalculated by the model.\n[25] A last source of error could result from the loss of\nNO due to photodissociation from sunrise to the SNOE\nmeasurements at \u00011030 LT. The ultraviolet solar flux\ninvolved in the photodissociation of nitric oxide has an\nuncertainty of 7% and the uncertainty in the molecular\nparameters is estimated to be 14%, giving a combined\nuncertainty for the photodissociation rate of 16%. A sensi-\ntivity test was performed for a photodissociation rate 16%\nlarger and 16% smaller than 7.34 \u0004 10\u00036 s\u00031. The result was\nthat the nitric oxide density had a decrease of 11% for the\nlarger value and an increase of 16% for the smaller value.\n[26] The combined uncertainty of the energy deposition\nderived from the SNOE observations is \u000130%. This\nincludes the observation uncertainties (\u000120%), the variation\nof NO (20%) from branching ratio uncertainty in the\nrecombination of NO+, and the variation of NO (\u000516%)\nfrom the uncertainty in the photodissociation rate of NO.\nThe combined uncertainty of the energy deposition derived\nfrom the PIXIE measurements is 25\u201330%. This includes a\nmaximum uncertainty in the X-ray flux from the Lorence\u2019s\ncode (10%), the uncertainty of the fitting of the energy\nspectra (25%), and the uncertainty of the X-ray measure-\nments (\u00055%).\n[27] At latitudes below 60\u0001N many of the discrepancies\ncould be explained by the combined effects of these\nuncertainties. In the cases where the discrepancies are\nlargest, most often at the highest latitudes, the combined\nuncertainties (25\u201330% for PIXIE and \u000130% for SNOE) are\nnot sufficient to explain the lower-energy deposition mod-\neled from the NO measurements. It is difficult to say at this\npoint whether possible meridional transport of NO could\nexplain these differences at the highest latitudes. We do not\nbelieve it is likely that the energy deposition derived from\nthe PIXIE measurements is systematically overestimated. In\nsome cases the modeled energy deposition is underestimated\nwhen the maximum NO density is not located at 110 km\naltitude, as assumed. However, at this point we are not able to\nexplain most of the discrepancies at the latitudes over 60\u0001N.\nFor the cases where the energy deposition derived from\nSNOE is larger than that derived from PIXIE, the uncertainty\nFigure 5.

Summary and Conclusion\n[28] In this study we have compared the total electron\nenergy deposition derived from nitric oxide measurements\nwith use of a photochemical model and derived from X-ray\nbremsstrahlung measurements. The comparisons are made\nfor the beginning of five geomagnetic storms in 1998 where\nthe activity was rather low the preceding day. In the photo-\nchemical model calculations, the electron energy was\nadjusted until the calculated NO density equaled the density\nmeasured by SNOE\/UVS on the dayside. Thus the modeled\nelectron energy deposition represents the total energy neces-\nsary to produce the excess amounts of NO in the lower\nthermosphere. The energy deposition derived from the PIXIE\nX-ray data is naturally limited to the time interval in which\nPIXIE was measuring. If there is precipitation before the\nPIXIE observations, this will be included in the modeled\nenergy deposition but not in the PIXIE data. The total electron\nenergy deposition derived from PIXIE observations can be\nconsidered as a lower limit.We found that themodeled energy\ndeposition is systematically underestimated compared to the\nenergy derived from the PIXIE measurements at the highest\nlatitudes (typically \u000660\u0001N) and that the PIXIE and SNOE\nenergy depositions are comparable within the range of the\nuncertainties at the lower latitudes (<60\u0001N). The differences\ncan in part be due to a possible southward drift of the NO gas\nand thus a displacement of the energy profiles. In some of the\ncases the assumptions made in the model calculations, with a\ncharacteristic Maxwellian energy of 4 keV and a maximum\nNO density at 110 km altitude, were not correct. The NO\nmeasurements would then have a maximum at a different\naltitude, and the electron energy deposition would be under-\nestimated. The chemical reaction rates used in the photo-\nchemical model may also cause a systematic underestimate of\nthe energy deposition.\n[29] The results of this study give us nonetheless confi-\ndence that we have a good basic understanding of the\nphysics and chemistry of the electron energy deposition\nand transport in the lower thermosphere. We believe that the\nminor adjustments that are necessary for improving the\nphotochemical model can be done using the results of these\ncomparisons with the PIXIE X-ray measurements.\n[30] Acknowledgments.
