His \nfirst day at work signifies his \u2018initiation\u2019 into the secretive conspiratorial \nsolidarity of working men\u2026 (Tolson 1987:  47-48) \nThe process through which boys learn their gender identities has recently been the \nsubject of a great deal of research and is an area supported by an ever increasing body \nof literature (for example see Harris 1995; Connell 1995; Edley and Wetherell 1996; \nMac an Ghaill 1996; Nilan 2000; Haywood and Mac an Ghaill 2003), and it has been \nargued that paid employment is linked with the very nature of men\u2019s identity \n(Collinson and Hearn 1994, 1996; Roper, 1994; Goodwin 2001, 1999a, 1999b; \nMcEachern 1999). There is also now an emerging literature on how young men are \nsocialised into work (Dennehy and Mortimer 1993; Goodwin 1999; Lloyd 1999) or \nhow men experience the transition from school to work as a gendered process \n(McDowell 2001). Discussions of how men experience the transition from school to \nwork may not appear to be new aspects of social enquiry and, indeed, it has been \nargued that many of the earlier studies on the transition from school to work focused \nalmost exclusively on the experiences of young males (Roberts 1984; O\u2019Connor and \nGoodwin 2002). Yet closer inspection of the literature on youth transitions reveals \nthat the actual experiences of the boys remain hidden within broader class or \neducation narratives. For example, in studies such as Carter 1962) and Ashton and \nField (1976), the authors tended to over concentrate on structural issues at the \nexpense of exploring the individually complex and gendered transitional experiences \nof the young men involved (Goodwin and O\u2019Connor 2003a). As such, it has not \nusually been the transitional experiences of young males per se that were of interest, \nbut the experiences of young males as members of certain class or educational \ngroups. Where gender as an issue is specifically raised (for example Roberts 1984: \n26) gender is used as \u2018shorthand\u2019 to describe the experiences of girls rather than to \nproblematise the boys experiences in terms of their gender. In many respects this \nreflects the practice in social science research at the time of interpreting \u2018gender \n 2 \n \nstudies\u2019 to mean the study of women (Brod 1987; Goodwin 1999). Perhaps an \nobvious exception to this is Willis (1977) who examined the transition process by \ndocumenting and exploring the actual transitional experiences of the boys in his \nsample. However, it would also be true to suggest that a class narrative underpins \neven this significant contribution.  \nYet the recent discovery of a \u2018lost\u2019 school to work transition study from the 1960s \naffords us the opportunity to examine the gendered nature of school to work \ntransitions for a group of young people in Leicester. Having presented the experiences \nof the girls elsewhere (O\u2019Connor and Goodwin 2004) this paper seeks to contribute to \nthe debates on the gendered nature of transition by using the data explore how young \nmales experienced the transition from school to work. In doing so we place emphasis \non their actual lived experiences of the transition process as opposed to exploring \ntheir experiences in the context of an explicit class or education debate. The lost \nschool to work transition study is Norbert Elias\u2019s \u2018Adjustment of Young Workers to \nWork Situations and Adult Roles\u2019 project and although the data from this project is \nhistorical, secondary analysis of the 854 interview schedules reveals this a unique \npicture of the transitional experiences of one generation of young people in what was \none of the English Midlands foremost manufacturing centres. \nFollowing the introduction the paper is divided into three main sections. In the next \nsection of the paper an outline of the theoretical models that have informed this \nresearch is provided. In this discussion we draw upon the work of Norbert Elias and \nRobert Connell in an attempt to further understand how central the transition from \nschool to work is in constructing hegemomic masculinity around paid employment. A \nsecondary analysis of the 1960s data is then offered which reveals how the young \nmale workers experienced the transition process in terms of reflections on school, \nthinking about work, finding and adjusting work, and thinking about the future. \nFinally the paper concludes by \n \nThe Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles Project \nApproaching what he thought was to be his final year at the University of Leicester, \nNorbert Elias was successful in applying for a grant \u00a315,000 from the Department of \nScientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) to explore the adjustment of young workers \nto work and adulthood. From the archived material associated with the Adjustment of \nYoung Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles project, it is clear that Elias had \ndeveloped the whole research agenda around an interest in examining the extent to \n 3 \n \nwhich young school leavers experienced difficulties in making the required \nadjustments to work and adult roles. Elias suggested that is project was \n\u2026concerned with the problems which young male and female workers \nencounter during their adjustment to their work situation and their entry into \nthe world of adults. When they go to work, or begin to train for work, young \nworkers have to make a wider adjustment to a situation and to roles which are \nnew to them, whose implications are often imperfectly understood by them \nand by the adults concerned, and for which they are in many cases not too \nwell prepared. The project will differ from other studies in investigating this \nwider adjustment which young workers have to make in their relationships \nwith older workers and supervisors in the factory or workshop; to the \nproblems and to their role as workers; and to their roles as money earners in \nhome relations and in their leisure time. (Young Worker Project 1962: 2) \nData for the project was collected between 1962 and 1964 via semi-structured \ninterviews with a sample of young people drawn from the Youth Employment Office \nindex of all Leicester school leavers from the summer and Christmas of 1960 and the \nsummer and Christmas of 1962. The sample was divided up into five sub-groups and \na target sample of 1150 young people was identified. From the 1150 individuals, the \nresearch team were successful in contacting 987, of whom 105 refused to be \ninterviewed and 882 interviews were eventually completed. However, with the \nexception of Ashton and Field (1976) who used a sample of the cases, the bulk of the \ndata has never been fully analysed or published (see Goodwin and O\u2019Connor 2003). \nIndeed, it was only the recent rediscovery of 854 interview schedules that Elias\u2019s \ninterest in the transition from school to work has emerged and the data has become \navailable for secondary analysis. \nA range of background work related data for the 577 boys in the sample is presented \nin Table 1. The data suggests that the vast majority of the boys were aged either 16 \n(35.2 per cent) or 18 (36.7 per cent) but with nearly 15 per cent being aged 17 at the \ntime of the interview. Around 8 per cent of the sample were aged 19 or over whilst 5 \nper cent were aged 15 or under. In terms of education, the vast majority of the boys \n(77.2 per cent) had received less than one years further education and left school at \nthe very first opportunity. The data presented in Table 1 indicates that over 45 per \ncent of the boys worked in skilled manual occupations, with a further 33 per cent \nworking in either partly skilled or unskilled occupations. However, 15.8 per cent were \nworking in skilled non-manual occupations and just over 5 per cent were working in \nintermediate occupations. In relation to standard occupation classification data, 45.4 \nper cent were working in craft and related occupations. Table 1 also suggests that \n15.4 per cent of the boys were working as plant and machine operatives, 14.2 per cent \nwere working in clerical and secretarial occupations and a further 11.4 per sent were \n 4 \n \nworking in sales occupations. There were also small clusters of boys working in \nassociate professional, professional and personal and protective service occupations. \n \nTable 1  Age, Number Jobs, Social Class, Standard Occupational Classification and \nEducation. \n \n            \nVariable         Number   Percentage  \n \n \nAge \n14             2      0.3      \n15             27      4.7       \n16             203      35.2  \n17             86      14.9     \n18             212      36.7 \n19             37      6.4 \n20             2      0.3 \n21             1      0.2 \nMissing             7      1.2 \n \nNumber of Jobs \n1             363      62.9 \n2             128      22.2 \n3             53      9.2 \n4             16      2.8 \n5+             17      2.9 \n \nSocial Class in First Job \nProfessional occupations       -    -   \nIntermediate occupations       31    5.4    \nSkilled occupations (non manual)    91    15.8 \nSkilled occupations (manual)      263    45.6  \nPartly skilled occupations       93    16.1 \nUnskilled occupations        97    16.8   \nArmed forces          2    0.3  \n \nMain Standard Occupation Classification \nManagers and administrators      -    -  \nProfessional occupations       2    0.3   \nAssociate professional occupations    29    5.0 \nClerical and secretarial occupations    82    14.2 \nCraft and related occupations      262    45.4 \nPersonal and protective service occupations  22    3.8  \nSales occupations         66    11.4 \nPlant and machine operatives      89    15.4 \nOther occupations        25    4.3   \n \nEducation \nMore than one years Further Education   130      22.5 \nLess than one years Further Education   445      77.2 \nMissing              2      0.3 \n               \nN              577      \n          \n \n 5 \n \nThe Context of Boys\u2019 Transitions to Work in 1960s Leicester \nAs we have reported elsewhere (see O\u2019Connor and Goodwin 2004) Leicester\u2019s \neconomy in the 1960s was dominated by engineering, textiles and clothing and \nfootwear manufacture. Engineering was Leicester\u2019s leading employer, employing \n67,960 employees in 1967, followed by textiles and clothing and footwear \nmanufacture, employing 55,970 and 16,500 respectively. However, it would be \nincorrect to view these industries separately as the manufacturing concerns of these \nthree industries were closely connected. For example, the British United Shoe \nMachine Company was concerned with producing machinery and tool parts for the \nCity\u2019s footwear manufacturers. The buoyancy of these industries meant that Leicester \nin the 1960s was characterised by high levels of employment, prosperity and \nopportunity. As Books and Singh (1978) report Leicester\u2019s economy of the 1960s was \ncharacterised by high employment and the availability of relatively well-paid \nmanufacturing jobs meant that unemployment remained at around 1 per cent. Despite \nthe domination of Leicester\u2019s economy by three main industries, it is interesting to \nnote that many of the city\u2019s firms in the 1960s were actually smaller than one hundred \nemployees. For example, Keil et al (1963) report that over 30 per cent of the total \nnumbers of those employed worked in firms with less than one hundred people, and \nthese small organisations attracted 44 per cent of the total numbers of school leavers \nduring the period 1960 to 1962. Keil et al suggest that  \nthe fact that so many young entrants to industry get their initial experience in \nfirms of under 100 employee affects both their attitudes to work, and the \nquality of their industrial training\u2026 (Keil et al 1963: 411) \nLike most of the towns and cities in the Britain, whose local economies were \ndominated by such manufacturing industries, Leicester has witnessed a massive \ndecline in the traditional industries that provided employment for the local \ncommunity. Although a relatively small amount of hosiery and textile manufacture \nstill takes place within the city, many of the large companies associated with these \nindustries, such as Corhas, British United Shoe Machine Company and Byfords, have \nlong since disappeared. \n \n \n \n \n 6 \n \nIn terms of education 1960s Leicester had a mixture of secondary modern schools, \ntechnical schools and grammar schools catering for around 80,000 school children. \nFrom the mid 1960s to the early 1970s it is reported that the percentage of pupils \nattending secondary modern and grammar schools reminded fairly constant at 73 per \ncent and 27 per cent respectively (Brooks and Singh 1977). According to Ashton and \nField (1976), those young people unable to obtain a place at a grammar school were \nunlikely to leave school with any qualifications and would leave as soon as possible \nat age 15. In 1960, there were 1750 school leavers who left school aged 15 and with \nno qualifications and by 1962 this figure had increased to 2053. \n \nLloyd\u2019s (1999) found that most felt that school failed to prepare them for work. They \nalso regretted not working harder at school, not realising the consequences of this \nuntil it was too late. \n \nBoys\u2019 Transitions to Work \n 7 \n \n 8 \n \n  \n \nReflections on School \nThe young workers were asked if they wished if they had stayed longer at school. Of \nthose who answered the question, 66 per cent said no, 24 per cent said yes and 7 per \ncent said that the sometimes wished that they had stayed longer at school. \nBreadwinner ideology over one quarter of the boys survey specifically mentioned that \ngoing out and earning money was the main reason that they wanted to leave school. \nWanted to leave so could get out and earn own money. (Joiner Improver 1964, \nA126) \nLooking forward to it very much, I always wanted to go to work and to earn my \nown money. (Apprentice Printer 1964, A459) \nI wanted to leave school. I grew fed up - the attraction of earning my own money \nalso helped. (Articled Clerk 1963, B162) \nThe thought of looking into the future and thinking about earning money and being \nbetter off was exciting. (Motor Mechanic 1963, C84) \nCouldn\u2019t wait \u2013 126 of the boys said that they were glad to leave and a good \nproportion of these said that they couldn\u2019t wait to leave school \nCouldn\u2019t wait - that\u2019s just how I felt - because I could get some money for a weeks \nwork. [do you think it would have been worth giving up the money and staying \nlonger now?] Yes, now (how long did it take you before you started thinking that?) \nabout 6 months [Any of your friends feel the same?] Yes, the ones I go out with \n[what sort of reasons do they give?] They say its easier to go to school than it is to \ngo to work, say if they were paid to go to school they\u2019d go to school instead of \ngoing to work. (Labourer 1963, A71)  \nWell, I were pleased you know, I mean at the time I were glad I were leaving. Well \nI\u2019ve not regretted it now really. I was pleased when I was leaving, so there! \n(Delivery Boy 1964, C232) \nI were glad. I felt big. (Welder\u2019s Mate 1963, A743) \nHoping for the day to come and glad of it. (Trainee Heating Engineer 1964, A929) \nRegrets \nI wanted to get away and earn the money. I suppose everyone does. Once I\u2019d left \nand been at work a couple of years I started thinking - we didn\u2019t really take \nadvantages of it. (Sewing Machine Mechanic 1963, C365) \nMixed feelings really - sort of happy in a way - sorry to leave it because I knew \nwhat I was leaving - because I\u2019d been around with these blokes and knew what I \n 9 \n \nwas in for - but had the money to think of. Thought marvellous when had \u00a32-10-0 \nfor first wages but not a lot better off after paying M. Used to get out a lot but go \nout a lot now. (Apprentice Toolmaker 1964, C66) \nGlad to leave but wish I hadn\u2019t now- [pause] thought I could have better time at \nwork [pause] got on to you at school a bit and thought it would be better. (Trainee \nJoiner 1964, A218) \nI didn\u2019t want to leave, I would have liked to go to school still as part time, I think it \nought to be compulsory to go to school for perhaps two days a week and to work \nfor the rest of the time for a while, it\u2019s too big a step straight of school to work. \n(Baker\u2019s Mate 1964, A304) \nOddly enough it didn\u2019t hit me till the day. The headmaster\u2019s speech showed the \nfinality of it you know. I suddenly realised your whole life was going to be changed \ncompletely. As soon as you walk out of the gates you are no longer leading the \nschool life which is very different to the working life. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead \nof you and you think it\u2019s quite a frightening thought for a second or so. (Trainee \nCommercial Artist 1963, C661) \nSeemed great 2-3 months before but on the day felt funny not coming back here \nagain. Don\u2019t know about sentimental but in a way sorry and in a way glad. On the \nway to being an adult and hoping I get the right job. Most of us felt pleased we \nwere leaving, probably, didn\u2019t show that we would have liked to have gone back, \nfelt pleased mostly. (Police Cadet 1963, B290) \nA few of the boys also indicated that they were anxious or even frightened of leaving \nschool going to work for the first time \nI was anxious, confused, worried. I think we\u2019re all like that on leaving school. \n(Trainee Knitter 1963, C601) \nI suppose I was a little bit frightened of leaving school [Prompt: Why?] It would be \nthe first major step I took. (Cable Jointer 1964, A352) \nI was frightened. It was a big change. At school you have nothing to bother about, \nbut at work you may get the sack.

Because been with \ndad and seen it and it appealed. It seemed to suit me down to the ground and I \ndidn\u2019t find out about anything else. (Apprentice Plumber 1963, C747) \nShoe factory.

(Sheet Metal Worker 1964, C726) \nJust made my mind up I weren't going into a factory that\u2019s all. Just didn't fancy it \nthat\u2019s al. Seemed a bit of a hard life as you got older. [F] My influence drove you \non. Having a father been on the factory floor it influences you against it , in a way, \nI doctrined him against the bench work. What I've seen of the factory life always \nbeneficial to be on the salaried side of things. (Trainee Cost Clerk 1964, A666) \nFactory. I didn\u2019t want to stay indoors. (Boot and Shoe Worker 1964, A836) \nFactory. I couldn\u2019t be closed up. I would get fed up with it - the same monotonous \nnoise. I couldn\u2019t do the same job day after day at a machine.

(Hosiery \nWorker 1964, C502)  \n29 boys identified that they did not want to work in a shop \n \nShop. There\u2019s no trade behind it. (Apprentice Bricklayer 1963, A357) \nShops. I\u2019ve nothing to gain from it. If I left a shop I could only go to another shop - \nyou have nothing to know you\u2019ve lived to know something - you\u2019ve sold something \nthat\u2019s all. (Clerk 1963, A473) \nShop. I couldn\u2019t stand it. It would be monotonous - working at the same place all \nday. If an awkward customer came in I could not keep my temper. (Apprentice \nPlasterer 1964, C355) \nShop - that\u2019s what I hated.

(Hosiery Worker 1964, A814) \n \nFuture aspirations appear to be medicated by education. Of those with less than one \nyears further education, 30 per cent suggested that they would be still working in the \nsame job or in the same firm in ten years time. Eighteen per cent suggested that they \ndid not know what they would be doing in ten years time. This compares to only 17 \nper cent of those with more that one years further education suggesting that they \nwould be in the same job or firm and only 11 per cent suggested that they did not \nknow what they would be doing in ten years time. There also appears to be slight age \ndifferences when one compares 16 and 18 year old respondents. Slightly fewer (26 \nper cent) of the 16 year olds reported that they would be in the same job in ten years \ntime as compared to the 18 year old respondents (30 per cent). However on 14 per \ncent of those aged 18 suggested that they did not know what they would be doing in \nten years time compared to 20 per cent of those aged 16. Of those in unskilled \noccupations 25 per cent indicated that they did not know what they would be doing in \nten years time as compared to only 1 per cent of those in intermediate occupations. \n \nWork A and C tend to have supervisory or managerial aspirations of want to own \ntheir own business. \n \nIt seems to be either staying where they are or starting a new firm\u2026or moving on \nwithin the same type of work \n \nWouldn\u2019t really know, if I'm still there reckon I'll be on the bending- if I don\u2019t get \nthe stack, which I don\u2019t think I will have- I'll be on the bending, I'll be all right \n(Trainee Cutler 1964, A132) \nI think I will be a foreman.
