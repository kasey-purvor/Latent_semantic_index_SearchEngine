Efficient charge transport could\nbe realized by electrons and holes moving in individual path-\nways along an interpenetrating network to the appropriate\nelectrodes, resulting in an external photocurrent density. As a\nresult, the photocurrent does not solely depend on the char-\nacteristics of the photogenerated charge carriers, but also de-\npends on the interface between the active layer and elec-\ntrodes. Generally, to obtain good interfacial properties\nbetween the active layer and anode, anode interfacial layers\nsuch as poly\u00013,4-ethylenedioxythiophene\u0002:poly\u0001styrene-\nsulfonate\u0002 \u0001PEDOT:PSS\u0002 are commonly used in OPV to en-\nhance hole extraction and increase open-circuit voltage \u0001Voc\u0002,\nas well as enhance the large area electrical uniformity.\nEven though PEDOT:PSS exhibits many advantageous\nproperties such as good thermal stability5 in its oxidized state\n\u0001doped form\u0002, high electrical conductivity,6 and excellent\nfilm formability,7 nevertheless, PEDOT:PSS applied as an\ninhomogeneous aqueous dispersion to OPV anodes \u0003e.g., in-\ndium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002\u0004 is highly acidic \u0001pH\u00051\u0002. Therefore, it\nis known to corrode the ITO, in particular, at elevated tem-\nperatures. Furthermore, typical spin-cast PEDOT:PSS films\nhave large microstructural and electrical inhomogeneities,\nwith morphology and conductivity varying by orders of mag-\nnitude over different film regions.8,9 These effects doubtless\nlead to inhomogeneous charge extraction with enhanced con-\nductivity in some locations and \u201cdead spots\u201d in others.8\nThese issues illustrate the need for an anode interfacial layer\nthat has greater charge-blocking characteristics, has strong\nadhesion to the anode surface, and allows for subsequent\nactive layers to be spin coated with greater thermal stability\nfor the rapid commercialization of OPVs.\nIn this study, we report on using fluoropolymer based\nmaterial called polytetrafluoroethylene \u0001PTFE\u0002, which is bet-\nter known as Teflon, as the ITO buffer layer for OPV appli-\ncations. The great advantage of PTFE is its low chemical\nreactivity,10 thermal stability \u0001up to 420\u00b0C\u0002,11 moisture resis-\ntance, flexible, light weight, and low cost. The effect of the\nPTFE layer thickness upon the device efficiency has been\ninvestigated.\nThe device consists of ITO-coated glass substrate, PTFE\nlayer, poly\u00013-hexylthiophene\u0002:phenyl-C61-butyric acid me-\nthyl ester \u0001P3HT:PCBM\u0002, and Al cathode.

The typical film\nthickness of P3HT: PCBM is about \u0005210\u2013230 nm. Five\ntypes of OPVs are prepared with a PTFE layer varied be-\ntween 0.5 and 5.0 nm. Both PTFE and Al films are deposited\nat a base pressure of 2\u000110\u22125 Torr. All the measurements\nare carried out in ambient atmosphere at room temperature.\nTo study the consistency of the device performance, a mini-\nmum of five samples for each individual structure of the\ndevices are tested.\nFigure 1 shows the energy levels of the single compo-\nnents of the photovoltaic cell with a simple schematic of the\nITO\/PTFE interface. The fluorine component aligns on top of\nthe ITO surface as shown in Fig. 1, creating a dipole surface\nwith the dipole moment directed inward the ITO. This re-\nduces the energy barrier between the ITO and organic\ninterface.12\nIn Fig. 2, the Jsc of the OPV devices are plotted as a\nfunction of the PTFE thicknesses. Compared to the device\nwithout the PTFE buffer layer, all the devices with PTFE\nbuffer layer showed a significant improvement by showing\nhigher Jsc. The high Jsc in OPV devices with the PTFE layer\nare mainly due to the reduction in the barrier height between\nITO and organic matrix and subsequently improve the hole\nextraction process. In general, for organic electronic material\nsystems \u0001e.g., P3HT\/PCBM\u0002, the hole mobility is a few mag-\nnitudes higher than the measured electron mobility.13 Hence,\nhole accumulation occurs in the device and the photocurrent\nis under space-charge limited conditions,14 which result in\nnonuniformity in the applied field within the active area or\nbulk of the device structure. By utilizing the PTFE buffer\nlayer, efficient hole extraction can reduce the hole accumu-\nlation at the ITO\/organic interface and as a result, the short-\ncircuit current Jsc is improved. Since PTFE is an insulating\nmaterial, with an extremely high resistivity of 1018 \u0002 \/cm\nfor its bulk properties and a large value for its ionization\npotential of 9.8 eV,15 it is reasonable to expect that the short-\ncircuit current densities of OPVs decrease with increasing\nthickness of the PTFE layer.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the Voc of the devices is strongly\ndependent on the PTFE thicknesses. For the reference de-\nvices with the structure of ITO\/P3HT:PCBM\/Al and ITO\/\nPEDOT\/P3HT: PCBM, the typical Voc was found to be 0.35\nand 0.44 V, respectively \u0001Table I\u0002. However, the Voc is found\nto be improved up to 0.55 V for the device with 5 nm of\nPTFE buffer layer. The work function of the ITO surface\ntypically varies from 3.90 to 4.80 eV depending on the sur-\nface treatment.16,17 After inserting the PTFE layer, the Voc is\nimproved from 0.35 to 0.56 V because of the strong dipole\nlayer created by the negatively charged fluorine rich PTFE\nlayer that has modified the surface and increased the effec-\ntive work function of the ITO.\nThe improvement of Jsc and Voc of the devices with the\nPTFE is mirrored in power conversion efficiency of the de-\nvice shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the PTFE film thick-\nness. As shown in Table I, the devices with PTFE buffer\nlayer exhibited at least a 40% increase in terms of power\nconversion efficiency compared to the reference devices.\nAmong the device with PTFE, a device with a 2 nm PTFE\nbuffer layer exhibited the best performance with a power\nconversion efficiency \u0001PCE\u0002 of 2.2%, which is attributed to\nthe good coverage of 2 nm PTFE layer on the ITO to modify\nthe ITO surface without an increase in the surface resistivity\nof ITO\/PTFE anode. This is assumed to be associated with\nthe enhanced tunneling of charge carriers across the PTFE,\nhelp by the strong dipole layer.\nTABLE I.

The performance im-\nprovement is attributed to the reduction in hole extraction\nbarrier. This fluoromaterial also offers a significant advan-\ntage in that the film can be simply prepared by thermal\nevaporation. Thus, it can be prepared at low substrate tem-\nperatures, which are compatible to flexible polymer sub-\nstrates for OPV applications. In the future, low cost fluo-\nropolymer \u0001PTFE\u0002 may be used as an alternative replacement\nmaterial for PEDOT:PSS.\nThe authors are grateful to funding from the EPSRC in\nthe form of a Portfolio Partnership Award and China Schol-\narship Council.\n1W.
