The point of this\nnumerical experiment is to show that a simulation of a real event must have the high time\nresolution electric field input files in order to produce the seed population for the radiation\nbelts, which are often observed to increase in the days following a magnetic storm.\nSpecifically, a cadence of the global electric field pattern of 5 min or less produces inner\nmagnetospheric fluxes that are larger (by up to several orders of magnitude) than fluxes\nproduced with a longer cadence. Differences were particularly large relative to simulation\nresults with a 3-hour time cadence, analogous to a Kp-driven electric field\nmodel.

Introduction\n[2] One of the largest uncertainties associated with mod-\neling the injection of the ring current is the description of\nthe large-scale electric field. Created by a day-night pressure\ndifference in the magnetic flux in the magnetosphere (from\nan imbalance in reconnection rates), this field convects\ncharged particles from the magnetotail into the inner mag-\nnetosphere. Its dynamical configuration near the Earth is\nstill a subject of debate.\n[3] Until recently, our understanding of the inner magne-\ntospheric electric field was limited to our interpretation of in\nsitu measurements. Several empirical electric field models\nwere created, such as those by Nishida [1966] and Brice\n[1967], Volland [1973] and Stern [1975], and McIlwain\n[1974, 1986]. Satellites such as CRRES have also probed\nthe inner magnetospheric electric field, yielding statistical\ncompilations counter to the empirical models [Rowland and\nWygant, 1998]. That is, rather than being dominated by the\nshielding effect with little or no electric field near the Earth,\nthe fields are highly variable (up to 6 mV\/m) in the near-\nEarth nightside (at 2 < L < 6) for large Kp [Wygant et al.,\n1998]. Ionospheric observations such as those made by the\nDMSP satellite [e.g., Burke et al., 1998; Anderson et al.,\n2001] and ground-based radars [e.g., Foster et al., 1986;\nFejer et al., 1990; Yeh et al., 1991, Foster and Vo, 2002]\nalso show high variability in the subauroral nightside during\nactive times. Only recently (from the IMAGE satellite) have\nglobal snapshots of the plasma morphology in the inner\nmagnetosphere been obtained with a quality suitable for\ndetailed, quantitative analysis [Burch et al., 2001], and\nprogress in extracting the electric field from these images\nis slow [e.g., Goldstein et al., 2003].\n[4] Because the field lines of the inner magnetosphere\npass through the midlatitude ionosphere, the convection\npatterns here are often useful to help explain the dynamics\nat the higher altitudes. For instance, Jordanova et al.\n[2001] showed that the statistical model of Weimer\n[1996] produces better comparisons of simulated ion flux\nagainst in situ data than do results using the classic\nVolland-Stern electric field model. Another ionospheric\nconvection description is the assimilative mapping of\nionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) technique [Richmond\nand Kamide, 1988]. This approach uses any available\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, A05209, doi:10.1029\/2003JA010186, 2004\n1National Space Science and Technology Center, NASA Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, USA.\n2Space Physics Research Laboratory, University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, Michigan, USA.\n3Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics, NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n4Computer Science Department, University of Alabama in Huntsville,\nHuntsville, Alabama, USA.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JA010186$09.00\nA05209 1 of 17\nionospheric data for a given time to produce an instanta-\nneous convection pattern. Boonsiriseth et al. [2001] dis-\ncussed a semiempirical method of mapping these\nconvection patterns out from the ionosphere into the inner\nmagnetosphere, finding that the resulting field was more\nrealistic than the Volland-Stern field. Chen et al. [2003]\nshowed that the AMIE-derived equipotentials concentrate\nin the evening sector during the main phases of storms,\nmoving plasma sheet ions into L \u0001 3\u20134 (even L \u0001 2 for\nextremely large events) in less than 30 min.\n[5] In a study by Khazanov et al. [2004], several\nelectric field models were used in conjunction with a ring\ncurrent electron and ion transport model to examine the\ndifferences in the net acceleration to the particles. It was\nshown that narrow channels of high electric field are an\neffective mechanism for injecting plasma into the inner\nmagnetosphere. Analytical expressions for the electric\nfield cannot produce these channels of intense plasma\nflow and thus result in less entry and energization of the\nplasma sheet into near-Earth space. For the ions, omission\nof these channels leads to an underprediction of the\nstrength of the stormtime ring current and therefore an\nunderestimation of the geoeffectiveness of the storm event.\nFor the electrons, omission of these channels leads to the\ninability to create a seed population deep in the inner\nmagnetosphere. These electrons can eventually be acceler-\nated into MeV radiation belt particles due to the different\ntype of acceleration mechanisms [e.g., Li et al., 1993;\nHudson et al., 1996; Summers and Ma, 2000; Albert,\n2001; Fok et al., 2001].\n[6] In this study, simulations are conducted to investigate\nthe influence of rapid electric field fluctuations on electron\nenergization in the inner magnetosphere based on the AMIE\ntechnique. Simulations for four different magnetic storms\nwere run, namely those that occurred on 15 May 1997,\n4 May 1998, 25 September 1998, and 19 October 1998.\nSpecifically, we examine the formation of high-energy (10\u2013\n1000 keV) electrons in the inner magnetosphere during\nthese storm events with our relativistic radiation belt trans-\nport code that we have been developing over the past year\n[Khazanov et al., 2004].\n2.

If one assumes that the\nelectric potential is like that used by Liemohn et al. [2001],\nthen the convection drift terms reduce to those given in\nequation (11) of that paper.\n[9] The bounce-averaged distribution function in equa-\ntion (1), Q(t, R0, j, m0, E), is associated with the number of\nparticles with kinetic energy and cosine of equatorial pitch\nangle between E + and E + dE, and m0 and m0 + dm0, whose\ngyrocenters are distributed on a given magnetic field line on\nthe interval sm < s < sm0 at time t as\ndn \u00bc 8pcm2hg\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ng2 \u0003 1\np\nQdEm0dm0djR\n2\n0dR0\nA05209 KHAZANOV ET AL.: PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN AMIE POTENTIALS\n2 of 17\nA05209\nNote that equation (1) is written in relativistic form, where\ng \u00bc 1\u00fe E\nmc2\nand all of the coefficients in equation (1) are converted\naccordingly.

On the left-hand side,\nthe bracketed terms are the drifts speeds in configuration\nand velocity speed that include all electric and magnetic\ndrifts. These velocities, one for each independent variable\nin the calculation, will be determined from a number of\nelectric field descriptions, to be discussed below. The f(m0)\ncoefficient is a bounce-averaging term that ranges from\n0.74 to 1.38 [Ejiri, 1978]. On the right-hand side, the first\nterm represents precipitation of particles into the atmo-\nsphere (assumed lost at 800 km altitude along each field\nline). For the electrons, pitch angle diffusion into the loss\ncone resulting from interactions with whistler mode waves\nin the plasmasphere is taken into account via the\nattenuation factors tw in equation (1) based on the Lyons\net al. [1972] study. The last term on the right-hand side of\nequation (1) includes losses from Coulomb collisions\n(pitch angle scattering and energy degradation terms). The\nenergy range of the simulations extends from 10 eV to\n5 MeV. For further details about the numerical solution\nof the kinetic equation (1), please see Jordanova et al.\n[1996, 1997], Khazanov et al. [1998, 1999], and Liemohn\net al. [2001].\n[10] It should be stressed that the classical radial diffusion\nprocess [Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974] is omitted from\nequation (1). The diffusion process is a fairly slow one\nand does not explain the rapid (\u0001hours) rise in the electron\nflux. Instead, we take into account electric field fluctuations\non a timescale comparable with or less than the drift period\nFigure 1. Geophysical quantities during the 1\u20137 May 1998 magnetic storm.

The 1\u20137 May 1998 Storm Results\n[11] To investigate the influence of rapid electric field\nfluctuations on electron energization in the inner magneto-\nsphere, we have selected the 1\u20137 May 1998 storm and used\nfive different time resolutions of the AMIE electric field\nmodel. The interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)\nthat hit the magnetosphere on 4 May 1998 was a large\nmagnetic cloud with a trailing high-speed stream, and\ndetails of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field\ncan be found in numerous studies [e.g., Gloeckler et al.,\n1999; Skoug et al., 1999; Farrugia et al., 2002]. It is\nactually the high-speed stream that hits early on 4 May\n1998, after the cloud had passed by the Earth on 2\u20133 May\n1998. Figure 1 shows an overview of the geophysical\nresponse to this activity during the 1\u20137 May 1998 interval.\nFigures 1a and 1b show the solar wind density and velocity,\nrespectively, from the ACE spacecraft. The Dst index\nshown in Figure 1c is an hourly value of the globally\naveraged midlatitude magnetic perturbation in the north-\nsouth direction. In Figure 1d, Kp is a 3-hour cadence global\nactivity index related to the amount of fluctuation in auroral-\nzone groundbased magnetometer records. Figure 1e shows\nthe total cross-tail potential difference for the AMIE model.\nIt is seen that the AMIE potential difference spikes up to\naround 250 kV during the main phase injection early on\n4 May 1998.\n[12] All of the electron transport code simulations use\nkappa distributions applied at the outer simulation boundary\n(at 6.6 RE equatorial distance) for the source populations of\nelectrons [e.g., Ma and Summers, 1999]\nj r;E\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc n r\u00f0 \u00de G k\u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de\npk\u00f0 \u00de3=2G k\u0003 1=2\u00f0 \u00de\n1\n2moEo\n\u0003 \u00041=2\nE\nEo\n1\u00fe E\nkEo\n\u0003 \u0004\u0003k\u00031\n;\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere the differential number flux j is related to the\ndistribution function by j = 2EQ\/m2. In order to isolate the\neffects of the electric field configuration, all five simulations\nare run with exactly the same initial and boundary\nconditions for the inner magnetospheric plasma populations.\nEquation (2) is used with k = 3 and the parameters n and E0\nspecified by the upstream solar wind\nn t\u00f0 \u00de cm\u00033\u00bd \f \u00bc 0:025Nsw t \u0003 3h\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 0:395\nE0 t\u00f0 \u00de keV\u00bd \f \u00bc 0:02Vsw t \u0003 3h\u00f0 \u00de \u0003 3:0\n\u00f03\u00de\nas determined from data [Borovsky et al., 1998; Ebihara\nand Ejiri, 2000]. The variations of these boundary condition\nquantities follow the solar wind density and velocity time\nseries as shown in Figures 1a and 1b, respectively. We use\nthe results of the NASA AE-8 model as the initial condition\nfor each run.\n[13] The only difference between the numerical experi-\nments was in the convection electric field description. They\nall use electric potential values from the AMIE technique,\nwhich ingests ground-based and satellite measurements to\nobtain a best-fit potential pattern for a given instant but with\ndifferent time resolutions. The first run used AMIE patterns\nwith a 1-min cadence. The magnetometer data, which\ndominates the AMIE assimilation (especially at subauroral\nlatitudes where there is no radar data), has a 1-min cadence.\nThe radar data (2-min resolution) and satellite data (\u000120 min\nper polar passage) are weighted in time to spread their\ninfluence over the window of observation. Furthermore,\nRidley et al. [1998, 1999] discussed the validity of this time\nresolution of AMIE potential patterns, finding that 1-min\ncadence patterns contain real magnetospheric variations.\nThe second through fifth runs used AMIE patterns with\ncadences of 5, 10, 20, and 180 min, respectively. The\nelectric field patterns for runs 2 through 5 were obtained\nsimply by taking an average of the 1-min values. For each\ntime step in the simulation (which are less than 1 min,\ntypically 5\u201310 s), the potential pattern for that moment is\ninterpolated between the closest two patterns. Therefore\nwhile the electric potential pattern (and therefore the con-\nvection electric field) is changing every time step, the global\ndynamics of the pattern are shifting on 1-min, 5-min,\n10-min, 20-min, or 3-hour timescales for the five simula-\ntions, respectively.\n[14] Results from this experiment are shown in Figures 2\nthrough 4. Each of these figures shows the result at a given\nuniversal time during the storm event. Hour 78 (Figure 2) is\n0600 UT on 4 May 1998, hour 84 (Figure 3) is 1200 UT on\n4 May 1998, and hour 90 (Figure 4) is 1800 UT on 4 May\n1998. Each subplot is a view of the inner magnetosphere\nfrom over the North Pole, so noon is to the left and dawn is\nto the top. Each column of each figure is a comparison of\nFigure 5.

A flux ratio\nabove +2.0 is colored yellow-red when the flux of the\nshorter time cadence E-field update simulation is larger\nthan the flux of the simulation with the longer time cadence\nbetween E-field updates. A value below-2.0 is colored blue-\npurple when the flux of the longer time cadence run is larger\nthan the flux of the shorter time cadence run. That is, color\nappears in the dial plots only when one of the simulations\nproduced fluxes at least twice as large as those from the\nother simulation. Note that the colorscale ranges are slightly\ndifferent in the two directions (twice as big for positive\nvalues). Absolute values of the flux intensities are not\nshown here because we have previously shown them in\nearlier studies [e.g., Khazanov et al., 2002, 2004]. In\naddition the basic structure of the flux intensities is very\nsimilar to those shown in the next section. We refer the\nreader to these other figures for the details of the inner\nmagnetospheric electron energy spectra.\n[15] The time chosen for Figure 2 is when the Dst index\nreached its deepest minimum during the 1\u20137 May 1998\nperiod (see Figure 1). Figures 3 and 4 represent times during\nthe recovery phase of the storm, when injection of fresh\nelectrons from the plasma sheet has essentially ceased.\nTherefore differences in the flux levels between the simu-\nlations are due to electric field differences in the inner\nmagnetosphere and not particularly from the injection of\nnew material through the outer boundary of the simulation\ndomain.\n[16] The plots become dominated by reds and yellows as\ntime progresses. This means that the electrons are being\naccelerated through resonant interaction of their drift tra-\njectories with the electric field fluctuations. In the main\nphase (Figure 2), the largest differences are seen in the 100\nand 170 keV energy channels. The increases are localized,\noften appearing as patches of red throughout the dial plots.\nThe largest increases are seen inside of L = 4 on the\nnightside and beyond L = 4 on the dayside. This is due to\ntiming differences in how the plasma sheet electrons are\ninjected and trapped in the inner magnetosphere. The blue\nring near L = 2 in some of the 500 keV plots is due to the\nfaster E-field updates removing more of the initial condition\nelectrons than the slower E-field updates.\n[17] During the recovery phase (Figures 3 and 4), the\ndifferences become clearer. For energies less than 100 keV,\nthere can be large differences throughout the simulation\ndomain in the data where the AMIE model has been\naveraged into 3-hour bins (relative to the other simulations).\nThis choice of an averaging timescale is to approximate a\nKp-driven simulation, which has a 3-hour time cadence.\nHowever, there are often little differences between the 1, 5,\n10, and 20-min update results (the flux ratios have very little\ncolor in this case). Going to the high-energy range, the 170\nand 300 keV energy channels show the largest differences,\nespecially between the 3-hour cadence results and the\nshorter time cadence results. Of particularly interest for this\nstudy is that the 300 and 500 keV channels show noticeable\ndifferences in the flux ratios for all time cadences, except\nFigure 6.

While there is some\npatchiness to the flux differences in the dial plots at these\nenergies, the main feature is a yellow-to-red ring near L =\n3 \u0003 5.

This suggests that a time\ncadence for updates of the global electric field pattern of\n5 min or less is required to accurately reproduce the real\nelectric field pattern in the inner magnetosphere.\n[19] The details of the electron distribution function for\nthe 1-min AMIE potential pattern results were shown in the\nwork of Khazanov et al.

GEM Campaign Selected Storms Electron\nEnergization\n[20] The storms that occurred on 15 May 1997, 25 Sep-\ntember 1998, and 19 October 1998 have been selected for\ncommunity-wide examination by the National Science\nFoundation\u2019s Geospace Environment Modeling Campaign.\nThe present study examines the formation of relativistic\nelectrons in the inner magnetosphere during these storm\nevents with the radiation belt transport code described\nabove. In this section a different set of boundary conditions\nand a different electric potential description are used in\norder to examine the dependence of the energization on\npotential distribution and boundary condition.\n[21] For boundary conditions (that is, particle source\nterms), the simulations use the observed electron fluxes at\ngeosynchronous orbit (6.6 RE altitude) from the various\nLANL geosynchronous spacecraft. Particle data from these\nsatellites are available from the space science group at Los\nAlamos National Laboratory. In these simulations we use\nthe electron moments (density, perpendicular temperature,\nand parallel temperature) from the magnetospheric plasma\nanalyzer (MPA) instrument on the spacecraft. These numb-\ners are applied to a bi-kappa distribution for all energies and\npitch angles [Thorne and Summers, 1991],\nf E; m\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc n Tk\nT?\nm\n2p k\u0003 1:5\u00f0 \u00deTk\n\u0003 \u00043=2 G k\u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de\nG k\u0003 :5\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u000f 1\u00fe\nE m2 \u00fe Tk\nT?\n1\u0003 m2\t \n\n\u0003 \u0004\nk\u0003 1:5\u00f0 \u00deTk\n0\nBB@\n1\nCCA\n\u0003k\u00031\n:\nLike the simulations for the May 1998 storm, kappa is set to\n3. The time cadence of the LANL MPA measurements is\n\u000190 s, offering a rapidly varying boundary condition for the\nsimulations. However, only observations on the nightside\nare used for the simulation boundary conditions, and\ntherefore gaps of several hours exist. When there is an\ninterval with no LANL satellites on the nightside, then the\nboundary condition is found by linearly interpolating\nbetween the previous and next valid observations. The\ndatasets have also been culled for times when the satellite\nwas on the nightside but was not observing a fresh injection\nof plasma sheet electrons. That is, the satellites are\nsometimes in the magnetotail lobes, particularly during\nFigure 11. Pitch-angle averaged energy spectra at 8 MLT times around the Earth at L = 4.5 during the\nSeptember 1998 storm. The three lines are at three times during the event: (red) prestorm, (green) main\nphase, and (blue) recovery phase.\nA05209 KHAZANOV ET AL.: PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN AMIE POTENTIALS\n12 of 17\nA05209\nhighly stretched field configurations, and thus the measure-\nments are not of the plasma sheet particles which are being\ninjected. When more than one satellite is on the nightside\nand providing usable data, the observation with the larger\ndensity is used as the boundary condition. The boundary\ncondition has no variation in MLT; the fluxes are assumed\nto be uniform across the nightside. That is, because there are\nonly a few LANL spacecraft operating, assumptions must\nbe made to extend the data to all local times and all\nuniversal times. In the present study, spatial variation has\nbeen neglected in order to achieve high temporal resolution\nof the boundary condition electron fluxes. Note that the\nsimulations for the May 1998 storm also used a spatially\nuniform, high-time-resolution outer boundary condition for\nthe electron fluxes.\n[22] These particle fluxes are convected into the simula-\ntion domain according to the time-varying electric potential\ndescription described by Liemohn et al. [2001]. Here, a two-\ncell convection formula is used that depends on Kp for the\nshielding parameter and on the cross polar cap potential\n(CPCP) for the convection strength. This analytical field\nmodel is a combination of the McIlwain [1986] E5D field\nmodel but modified for a better description of the stormtime\npotential variations by changing the activity dependence\naway from Kp to CPCP. This simple description reproduces\nthe shape of many of the observed drift boundaries of the\nring current ions (see Liemohn et al. [2001] for further\ndetails). Compared with the AMIE potential patterns, for\ninstance, this model also produces strong convection on the\nnightside, which is needed to get good agreement with ion\ndata [Khazanov et al., 2004]. In the simulations presented\nbelow, the CPCP values are from the AMIE technique. The\ntime cadence of the AMIE CPCP values is 5 min. As found\nin the previous section, this time cadence provides an\nadequate level of variability to the electric field to inject\nthe particles deep into the inner magnetosphere. By using a\ndifferent electric field model, the dependence of this ener-\ngization on the electric potential description will be\nassessed.\n[23] The CPCP values used in the simulations are shown\nin Figure 5. The electron densities from the LANL MPA\ndata set used as a boundary condition for these simulations\nare shown in Figure 6. Gaps in the boundary condition\ndata set appear as straight lines between points. For\nreference, the observed Dst index values are shown in\nFigure 7. This index is provided here to show the relative\nmagnitudes of the three storms and the timing of the\nvarious phases of the events. Shown in each subplot as\nblack dots along the Dst curve are the times selected for\nthe following figures. In general, the six times are as\nfollows: prestorm, main phase, Dst minimum, and three\nrecovery phase times.\n[24] Figure 8 shows energy versus L shell spectrograms at\nmidnight (MLT = 0) at the six times (the six rows) during\nFigure 12. Same as Figure 11 except the results are at L = 3.00.\nA05209 KHAZANOV ET AL.: PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN AMIE POTENTIALS\n13 of 17\nA05209\neach event (the three columns). The color scale has been\nchosen to highlight the high-energy end of the spectrum,\nand so the low-energy peak of the electron fluxes is often\nappear saturated. The injection of the electrons into the\ninner magnetosphere is seen to progress throughout each\nevent, with a dramatic increase in injection during the main\nphase of the storm. Figure 9 is a similar plot but for noon\n(MLT = 12). In comparing Figures 8 and 9, it is seen that the\nelectrons enter on the nightside and drift eastward toward\nthe dayside, where the enhancement occurs at a later time.\nAs convection enhances during the storm, these particles are\ninjected deeper into the inner magnetosphere (that is, closer\nto the Earth) and are adiabatically energized in the process.\nThis energization is clearly seen in the results. Because the\neastward gradient-curvature drift of the electrons is energy-\ndependent, the higher-energy electrons do not penetrate as\nfar in toward the Earth as the lower-energy particles. This is\nillustrated as the creation of a \u2018\u2018nose\u2019\u2019 in the spectrograms.\nBecause of the continuously fluctuating electric field, the\nelectrons are also randomly diffused in radial distance. This\nresults in a net acceleration of the electrons (because the\nsource term is at large L values). This process is especially\nnoticeable in the high-energy tail of the distribution. By\ncomparing the prestorm and poststorm figures, it is seen that\nmany electrons have been injected into the inner magneto-\nsphere and a significant seed population for the radiation\nbelts has been formed.\n[25] Figure 10 is a similar plot format except that it shows\nresults for the September 1998 event only, plotted every\n2 hours of simulation time at MLT = 00 from the start of the\nrun up through the minimum in Dst. This plot shows the\ntime evolution of the distribution in the inner magneto-\nsphere and clearly shows that the injection timescales are\nmuch faster than the diffusion timescales. That is, most of\nthe injection is due to convective forces pushing the\nelectrons into the inner magnetosphere.\n[26] To quantify the magnitude of this increase, Figures 11\nand 12 show line plots of the pitch-angle averaged energy\nspectra at two L values (4.5 and 3.0 for Figures 11 and 12,\nrespectively) at three times during the September 1998 event\n(prestorm, main phase, and late recovery; the red, green, and\nblue lines, respectively). The 8 line plots are shown every\n3 hours of MLT in their respective positions around the Earth\n(drawn in the center of each figure). The increases in flux are\ndramatic, with many orders of magnitude more electrons in\nthe simulation domain than before the magnetic storms. The\nresults at L = 3.0 show this increase especially well. It is\ninteresting to note how bumpy the energy spectra appear in\nFigures 11 and 12. This is due to the time variability of both\nthe boundary conditions and the electric field strength, as\nFigure 13. The same energy spectra format as Figure 11, except that the two lines in each plot are for\nthe two time-cadence options run for the September 1998 storm. The results are for L = 4.5 near the peak\nof the storm.\nA05209 KHAZANOV ET AL.: PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN AMIE POTENTIALS\n14 of 17\nA05209\nseen in Figures 5 and 6. The convolution of these parameters\n(along with the variance in Tk and T?) leads to a\ncomplicated structure in the electron distribution function\nin the inner magnetosphere. Certain particles will be in drift\nresonance with the fluctuations in the electric field and will\nbe injected faster and deeper than the electrons at other\nenergies. Conversely, an interval of low density at the\nnightside boundary accompanied by high convection will\nresult in a net loss of electrons from the inner magneto-\nsphere (flow out the dayside boundary).\n[27] It is interesting to note that the three events have very\ndifferent Dst minima and time sequences and also quite\ndifferent peak and integrated CPCP values. However, all\nthree events resulted in substantially enhanced electrons in\nthe inner magnetosphere. This is because the electric field\nwas allowed to fluctuate with a fast cadence, and the\nparticles were able to convect and diffuse in toward the\nEarth throughout the event.\n[28] To investigate this dependence, the September 1998\nsimulation was rerun with a different set of boundary\nconditions. Specifically, the CPCP and LANL electron\nmoments were averaged over 3 hour bins. As in section 3,\nthis choice of an averaging timescale is to approximate a\nKp-driven simulation, which has a 3-hour time cadence.\nThe CPCP and electron boundary conditions still change\nevery time step in the new simulation, but the values are\nnow interpolated from these 3-hour averages, rather than\nfrom the high time resolution input files. A comparison of\nthe results from the two simulations is given in Figures 13\nand 14. These two plots are similar to Figures 11 and 12,\nexcept the two lines drawn in each subplot are for the two\nsimulations and all results are shown for main (Figure 13)\nand recovery (Figure 14) phases of the storm. It is seen that\nthe fluxes are up to three orders of magnitude higher in the\nhigh-time-cadence simulation results, especially at the high-\nenergy (10\u20131000 keV) end of the spectrum. This is due to\nthe fluctuations in the electric field resonating with the drift\nperiods of these electrons, preferentially accelerating them\nvia a net inward radial drift. This enhancement is seen\nclearly in the 100s of keV energy range at this radial\ndistance (L = 4.5), which is exactly where a seed population\nis needed for the production of outer zone radiation belt\nrelativistic electrons.\n[29] The point of this numerical experiment is to show\nthat a simulation of a real event with measured particle\ninputs must have a high time resolution E-field update in\norder to produce a seed population for the radiation belts,\nwhich are often observed to increase in the days following a\nmagnetic storm. It should be pointed out, however, that the\nflux differences vary from one storm to another and are a\nfunction of not only the intensity of the particular magnetic\nstorm but also the previous history of Dst development. A\ncomparison of the results presented in this section and the\nprevious section imply that the energization depends more\non the variability of the inner magnetospheric electric fields\nthan on the specific choice of the electric potential descrip-\nFigure 14. Same as Figure 13 except that the chosen time is in the recovery phase of the storm.\nA05209 KHAZANOV ET AL.: PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN AMIE POTENTIALS\n15 of 17\nA05209\ntion employed in the simulation. Large particle flux\nincreases in the 10\u20131000 keV range were generated with\nboth electric field models (the AMIE potentials and the\nMcIlwain potentials), as long as the time cadence of the\nvariation was 5 min or less.\n5. Conclusions\n[30] Four storms were examined to quantify the influence\nof electric field fluctuations on the development of the\nelectron distribution function in the inner magnetosphere.\nIt was found that the global electric field pattern should be\nupdated with a cadence of 5 min or less in order to properly\nsimulate the enhancement of the 100\u2013500 keV electrons in\nthe L = 3\u20135 range. This is the energy range and spatial\nregion for the seed population of the MeV electrons in the\nouter zone radiation belt. This study showed that E-field\nfluctuations are critical to the formation of this seed popu-\nlation during magnetic storms. These electrons have drift\nperiods close to the fluctuation period of the global potential\npattern, and therefore they experience energization. A\nmodel that does not take into account these rapid fluctua-\ntions of the inner magnetospheric electric field will under-\nestimate the fluxes of these electrons. Differences were\nparticularly large (up to several orders of magnitude)\nrelative to simulation results with a 3-hour time cadence,\nanalogous to a Kp-driven electric field model.\n[31] This study shows that by varying the global structure\nof the electric field at a high time cadence, specifically 5 min\nor less between potential pattern updates, a stochastic motion\nof the particle drift paths occurs. These random changes\nresult in radial diffusion, and because the particle source is at\nthe outer simulation boundary, the net effect is an inward\npropagation of particles and thus an energization. As was\nstressed in section 2, we did not employ the classic radial\ndiffusion process [Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974] in equation\n(1). These diffusion coefficients are small and cannot explain\nthe rapid rise in the electron flux [e.g., Chen et al., 1993,\n1994; Sheldon, 1994; Beutier and Boscher, 1995; Bourdarie\net al., 1996, 1997]. Instead, we took into account electric field\nfluctuations on a timescale comaparable with or less than the\ndrift period of radiation belt electrons from the realistic\npotential distributions provided by the AMIE model. Radial\ndiffusion by nature is a stochastic process that is driven by\nelectric and magnetic field fluctuations that are included in\nthe model through electric and magnetic drifts. This study\nsimply shows that stochastic transport and energization can\nbe obtained if the simulation includes a rapidly fluctuating,\nrealistic electric field description. It also quantifies the\nrapidness with which it much change in order to accurately\nreplicate this diffusion process.\n[32] Acknowledgments.
