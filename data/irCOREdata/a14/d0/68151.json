INTRODUCTION \nSignal Propagation on long resistive interconnect lines \nis a function of the product of the line resistance and \ncapacitance, commonly known as the RC delay. Since \nboth the resistance and capacitance show a linear increase \nR \nwith length, the delay increases quadratically with length. \nBecause the prophecy of Moore\u2019s law in VLSI circuits has \nheld true over the years, interconnections have become \nsmaller in cross-section and longer in length with each \nsucceeding generation of CMOS technology. Hence there \nhas been a lot of investigation into the problem of repeater \ninsertion in long interconnect. Bakoglu [ 11 presented an \nanalysis based on characterizing the repeater with an input \ncapacitance and an output resistance which was one of the \npioneering works in this area. Wu and Shiau in [2]  \nimprove on the repeater model and use a linearised form \nof the Schichmann-Hodges equations while Adler and \nFriedman in [3] use Sakurai\u2019s alpha power model to \ninclude the effect of velocity saturation in short channel \ndevices. Ismail and Friedman in [4] present an analysis \nwhich models inductance in the interconnect for the first \ntime. Some other work on repeater insertion is given in [5] \nand [ 61. \nIn the future generation of VLSI circuits when the fea- \nture size shrinks to a fraction of a micro meter, and more \nand more transistors are placed on a single chip, cross talk \nwill pose a serious challenge in designing VLSI systems. \nIn closely coupled interconnects such as in long parallel \nbuses, cross talk can result in speeding up of the signal or \ncause considerable additional delay- depending on the \ncorrelation between the data on the different lines. We \npresent in this paper an analysis for repeater insertion to \nminimise delay in parallel coupled interconnects with \n0-7695-0831-6\/00 $10.00 0 2000 IEEE \n~~ \n- - \nFigure 1.

The \nequations we derive reduce to Bakoglu's equations when \nthe coupling capacitance term is set to zero, and are suita- \nble in a-priori signalling estimates. \n1000 \n2. DELAY MODEL FOR COUPLED \nINTERCONNECTS \n100 100 97920 98000 -0.08% \nThe first step in analysing the effect of cross talk on \nrepeater insertion is to have an accurate delay estimate for \nthe step response. From now on, whenever delay is men- \ntioned we are always talking about the 50% delay, since \nthis corresponds to the delay of the output to the switching \nthreshold of an inverter. We consider a line with coupling \non two sides and derive a model for the step response with \nworst case coupling: that is both aggressor lines switch in \na direction opposite that of the victim line. The configura- \ntion for this analysis is shown in Fig. 1 .  \nV d K  \n7 \n- \n- - \nFigure 2. Lumped model with cross talk \nThe .reasoning behind the derivation of the model \nrequires a short diversion into previous work. The delay of \na lumped RC circuit is analytically solvable and is \nThe step response of a distributed RC circuit has no \nclosed form time domain solution. However a closed form \nfrequency domain solution exists, and it is possible to \nmake an approximation for b>RC and t<<RC and use \nthese equations to separately calculate the low frequency \nand high frequency portions of the output waveform (Ref. \n[I]). This leads to the following delay model for the step \nresponse to a distributed RC line: \n' 0 . 5 ,  disrr = 0.4RC ( 2 )  \nNow the step response for a a lumped RC circuit with \ncoupling as shown in Fig. 2 is given by: \nI f \n(3) \nJust as the delay for the distributed line can be approxi- \nmated by To,5 = h * RC where RC is the time constant in \nthe lumped model, and h a constant, We have approxi- \nmated the delay for the distributed lline with cross talk by a \nmodel given by: To.s = h, * RC,r + hb * R(2C,+C,r) where \nRC, and R(2C,+C,r) are the two time constants present in \nthe lumped model. If there is an additional line acting as \nthe aggressor, the coupling capacitance term doubles. For \na distributed line with two aggressor nets as shown in Fig. \n1, this reduces to the following equation:. \n'OS, disrr, wirhCT = 0.4RCs + 0.58 R C c  (4) \nTable 1.

It is seen that there is good agreement for a wide \nrange of R, C, and C, parameters, and that the correlation \nis weakest when C, > lOOC,, which is an unrealistic sce- \nnario in an actual situation. For all practical purposes, this \nmodel is as accurate as the very commonly used approxi- \nmation for a distributed line as given in Eq. (2), which is \nreported to exhibit an accuracy of within 4% for a wide \nrange. This delay model is used in the next section to \nobtain equations for repeater numbering and sizing for \nminimum delay. \nR (ohm) Cs (fF) \n1000 1000 \n3.

Let the number of repeaters including the \noriginal driver be k, and the size of each repeater be h \ntimes a minimum sized inverter. The output impedance of \na minimum sized inverter for the particular technology is \nR ,  and the output capacitance C,, Then the output \nimpedance of an h sized driver becomes R,@, and the \noutput capacitance h *e, This configuration is sketched \nout in Fig. 3, where the symbol refers to a capaci- \ntively coupled interconnect as shown in Fig. 1.

Both lines are 0.7 pm wide and 0.5 pm thick with a \nspacing between the lines of 0.7 pm and a dielectric thick- \nness of 0.5 pm. The resistive and capacitive parasitics \nwere obtained from typical per unit length values. The \nbuffers were numbered and sized according to Bakoglu\u2019s \nequations (k ,  and h,) and according to the cross-talk analy- \nsis model (k,  and h,) with k being rounded to the nearest \ninteger.

SUMMARY \nWe have presented a worst case delay model for parallel \ncoupled interconnects and shown that it is accurate to \nwithin 95% over a wide range of parameters. We have \nused this model to study the impact of cross talk on buffer \nsizing for delay minimisation in long nets, and derived a \nnew set of equations that give the: number and optimum \nsize of the repeaters. The delay equation for a single sec- \ntion of the line was verified with simulations and found to \nTable 4.

There is a representative value for different regions so \nto speak, defined by the R, C, and C, coordinates. Typical \nvalues for a wide range of buses in VLSI circuits are thus- \nrepresented. \nEven in modem synthesis programs, the capability of \nthe routing tool to take into account effects such as cross \ntalk is very limited. This results in poor layout and \nrepeated iterations of the design cycle. The availability of \nclosed form equations to predict the timing behaviour in \nthe face of cross talk would hence potentially be very use- \nful. \n5. REFERENCES \n[ 11 Bakoglu H.
