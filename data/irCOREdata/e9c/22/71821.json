These \ninclude both preformed defences, ranging from structural features to stores of toxic \nsecondary metabolites, and inducible defences, which are activated only after an attack is \ndetected. It is well known that plant defences against pests and pathogens are commonly \naffected by environmental conditions, but the mechanisms by which responses to the \nbiotic and abiotic environments interact are only poorly understood. In this review, we \nconsider the impact of light on plant defence, both in terms of plant life histories and \nrapid scale molecular responses to biotic attack. We bring together evidence that \nillustrates that light not only modulates defence responses via its influence on \nbiochemistry and plant development, but in some cases, is essential for the development \nof resistance. We suggest that the interaction between the light environment and plant \ndefence is multifaceted, and extends across different temporal and biological scales. \n \nKey words: \nLight, defence, resistance, tolerance, pathogen, herbivore. \n \nAbbreviations: \nCBDC \u2013 carbon-based defensive chemicals; CHS \u2013 chalcone synthase; CNB \u2013 carbon nutrient \nbalance; GDB \u2013 growth differentiation balance; HR \u2013 hypersensitive response; PAL \u2013 \nphenylalanine ammonia lyase; PAR \u2013 photosynthetically active radiation; PET \u2013 photosytnthetic \nelectron transport; PR \u2013 pathogenesis-related; ROS \u2013 reactive oxygen species.\n3 \nI. Introduction \nLight is fundamental to the existence of plants. It affects all aspects of growth and \ndevelopment, since a primary requirement for plant fitness is to optimise light harvesting \nfor photoautotrophic growth. Hence, photoreceptors such as phytochromes and \ncryptochromes sense quantitative and qualitative features of the light environment and, \nvia associated signal transduction pathways, regulate plant physiology and development. \nLight, through photosynthesis, also controls much of the biochemical activity within plant \ntissues, something that is reflected by the fact that a wide array of genes are \ntranscriptionally regulated by the circadian clock in Arabidopsis thaliana (Harmer et al., \n2000). By sensing day length, plants also use light as a seasonal indicator which controls \nthe transition to reproductive growth in many plant species. Although essential, light can \nalso pose problems for plants. Increased doses of UV light can cause damage at the \nmolecular level, and even simple changes in ambient sunlight can over-load \nphotosynthetic electron transport (PET), causing damaging reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) to accumulate. Plants have evolved many systems to minimise the impacts of such \ndeleterious effects of light, including the production of photoprotective pigments, \nbiochemical systems to rapidly modulate chloroplast electron transport, physiological \nresponses such as the ability to re-orient chloroplasts, and photomorphogenic responses \nthat optimise the interaction of the leaves with light over longer time scales. \n \nAs well as direct effects on plant metabolism, growth and development, light inevitably \ninfluences many other plant responses to the environment. These include defences against \npests and pathogens. There is a wide range of information in the scientific literature on \n4 \nthe effects of light on defence responses, ranging from ecological to molecular scale \ninvestigations of both short and long term responses. Our aim here is to draw some \ngeneral conclusions on the impact of light on plant defence, and to attempt to suggest \nconceptual models that explain the observations in terms of both the molecular and \necophysiological responses to light and biotic attack. \n \nII. Light as an environmental variable \nLight is an extremely dynamic component of the terrestrial environment. Changes are \nboth quantitative (including variation in instantaneous irradiance, dose accumulated over \ntime, and day length) and qualitative (in terms of light spectral balance). Plants and their \nassociated herbivores and pathogens may respond to each of these different components \nof variation. \n \n1. Variation in the quantity of light.  \nThe quantity of light falling on a surface at a given moment, usually referred to as \u201clight \nintensity,\u201d is formally defined in terms of either energy per unit area (= irradiance) or \nquanta per unit area (= photon flux: see Bjorn, 2002). Some elements of the variation in \nirradiance are predictable, for example variation with time of day, season and latitude are \nall functions of the elevation of the sun in the sky (the higher the solar elevation, the \nhigher the irradiance). As a result, irradiance reaches a maximum near the equator, at \nmid-day, and, at mid-high latitudes, in mid-summer. Superimposed on these systematic \ngeographical and seasonal variations in irradiance are variations due to factors like cloud \ncover, aspect on a sloping site, or shade from nearby structures or plant canopies (Fitter & \n5 \nHay, 2002). Some of these factors affect all wavelengths of light more or less equally, \nothers are much more wavelength specific (see below). \n \nMany biological responses to light can be described as simple functions of irradiance. \nThe rate of photosynthesis in plants is a typical example. Although photosynthesis is a \nfunction of irradiance, growth is determined by the sum of photosynthetic carbon fixation \nover time which is, in turn, a function of the amount of light received by the plant over \nthat period. Thus, growth and yield, and many other long-term effects of light, are best \ndescribed by the accumulated dose of photosynthetic radiation, for example by daily light \nintegral (Kitaya et al., 1998; Korczynski et al., 2002; Dielen et al., 2004). Light damage \nis also often a function of accumulated dose, as with many whole-plant responses to UV \nradiation (Gonzalez et al., 1998; de la Rosa et al., 2001).  \n \n2. Variation in the quality of light \nLight quality is the balance between different wavelengths. Different organisms perceive \ndifferent wavelengths in different ways. The three primary colours of human vision \ndefine \u201cvisible\u201d light (approx. 400-700 nm), but other animals, including many \ninvertebrate and some vertebrate herbivores, may perceive different wavebands, notably \nin the ultraviolet region (primarily UV-A: 315-400 nm). Thus, what is actually perceived \nas \u201cvisible light\u201d varies substantially between species. Photosynthetically active radiation \n(PAR) is usually defined as 400-700 nm, but plants also detect and utilise different \nwavelengths as environmental cues. Responses to red and far red (detected by \nphytochromes), blue and UV-A (detected by cryptochromes, phototropins and related \n6 \nphotoreceptors) are well defined (Gyula et al., 2003; Spalding & Folta, 2005). The \nmechanistic basis for responses to UV-B (290-315m) remains poorly defined: some may \nbe a function of damage to DNA and other biological molecules, but there is also \nevidence for a specific UV-B photoreceptor (Jenkins et al., 2001). \n \nThe spectral balance of sunlight in the field is influenced by a range of factors. Temporal \nchanges in the ratio of UV to longer wavelengths are largely driven by the increase in the \nratio at high solar elevations. At temperate and high latitudes sunlight is relatively \nenriched in UV, especially UV-B, in summer compared with winter. Similarly, the ratio \nof UV to PAR is highest near noon. There is some enrichment of far-red relative to red at \ntwilight (Salisbury, 1981). Spatially, UV:PAR ratios are typically higher at low latitudes. \nCloud typically reduces all wavelengths of sunlight but shorter wavelength UV less than \nPAR, resulting in some increase in UV:PAR ratio under cloud conditions (Calbo et al., \n2005). Shade from plant canopies has major effects on spectral balance, notably in terms \nof R:FR (Ballare, 1999; Gyula et al., 2003; Vandenbussche et al., 2005), but also the ratio \nof UV:PAR (Grant & Heisler, 2001; Heisler et al., 2003; Grant et al., 2005). \n \nIII. Long term effects of light on plant-herbivore or plant-pathogen interactions \nStudies of the effects of both shade and diurnal variation in light on plant interactions \nwith their natural enemies deal mostly with herbivores; effects on disease remain \nrelatively poorly known. Studies of herbivory (Table 1) have mostly been in the context \nof variation in the light environment due to plant canopies, such as the effect of position \nrelative to neighbours, including gaps in woodland canopies, or woodland edge \n7 \n(individuals within gaps or at the forest edge receiving more sunlight than those within). \nStudies of woody plants have also considered the influence of vertical position in the \ncanopy (foliage at or near the top of the canopy receiving greater insolation than that low \ndown in the canopy), and the direction in which foliage faces (in the northern \nhemisphere, south facing foliage receives higher irradiances than north-facing). \nExperiments have either used these natural variations in light environment (for example \ntaking foliage from, or placing plants in, different locations) or artificially manipulated \nlight using shade cloth etc. (Table 1).  In some cases, the latter experiments have related \nto the use of shading as a tool in crop production. Of course, shading results in complex \nchanges in the light environment, both quantitative and qualitative, which can differ \ndepending on the source of shade. Thus, although some studies implicitly assume that \nshade influences plant-herbivore interactions through changes in photosynthesis driven \nsimply by the reduction in PAR, there may be independent effects of altered spectral \nbalance in shade (R:FR or UV:PAR see above). Artificial shade treatments do not \nnecessarily reproduce these spectral changes.  \n \nIn the field, shade will also influence overall radiation balance with possible \nconsequences for the abiotic environment of the host, the herbivore and potentially other \norganisms such as parasitoids or predators of the herbivore. Temperatures of the air and \nof organisms are typically lower in the shade, with direct effects on a wide range of \nprocesses, and indirect effects such as altered water balance, which may result in reduced \nplant water deficits compared with full sunlight. Equally, \u201cshade\u201d in the field, may alter \nthe biotic environment through mechanisms unrelated to any effect on solar radiation. For \n8 \nexample, there is a substantial literature on the role of tree canopies in determining the \nnumber and species richness of the community of insectivorous birds that can have a \nmajor influence on herbivory (Marquis & Whelan, 1994; Strong et al., 2000; Van Bael & \nBrawn, 2005). Certainly the effects of tree canopies on herbivory in crops such as coffee \ncan be interpreted in relation to the greater predation by birds, not changes in the light \nenvironment (Perfecto et al., 2004). Such effects highlight the complexity of shade as an \nenvironmental variable. Clearly, many of the same arguments can be made in relation to \ncomparisons between day and night, which differ in far more than simply the light \nenvironment. While these broader mechanisms are largely beyond the scope of this \nreview, they provide an important context for any assessment of light-mediated changes.  \n \n1. Light and herbivory \nDay \/ night \nDiurnal variation in herbivory has been viewed primarily as a function of the biology of \nthe herbivore rather than the host. The general expectation is that most invertebrate \nherbivores are less active during the day than at night, at least partly because the risk of \npredation or parasitism is greater during the day (Hassell & Southwood, 1978). However, \nthere are many exceptions to this pattern (Springate & Basset, 1996; VanLaerhoven et al., \n2003). For example, Novotny et al., 1999) reported a three times greater risk of predation \nduring day compared with night, yet herbivores were more abundant during daylight. \nSome insect herbivores feed almost exclusively during the day (Kreuger & Potter, 2001), \nwith the temperature dependence of behaviour perhaps being a key driver. One host \ncharacteristic that shows diurnal variation and which might influence both herbivores and \n9 \nhigher trophic levels is the emission of volatiles. There are quantitative and qualitative \ndifferences in wound-induced volatiles between day and night (De Moraes et al., 2001; \nGouinguene & Turlings, 2002; Martin et al., 2003, and see Section V). Herbivores, and \ntheir parasites and predators, are able to detect and respond to such changes, and diurnal \nvariation in the volatile signal may result in differential effects on different herbivores \n(De Moraes et al., 2001) as well as on higher trophic levels (Maeda et al., 2000). On the \nother hand, some predators appear capable of isolating key information against this \nhighly variable volatile signal (Meiners et al., 2003).  \n \nShade  \nThe general hypothesis that herbivory would be suppressed in plants grown in full sun \ncompared with those in shade has been shown to be correct in many systems, especially, \nbut not exclusively, with leaf chewing insects (Table 1a). This is true at least in the sense \nthat when consumed, leaf tissue from plants grown in shade is more favourable to \nherbivore growth and\/or development. However, plants grown in full sunlight may suffer \nan increase in the leaf area consumed compared with shade-grown plants (Table 1a). This \nincreased consumption may be a function of reduced food quality in full light, since \ninsects often compensate for low food quality by increasing intake (Slansky & Wheeler, \n1992). However, this mechanism may not fully explain increased consumption of high-\nlight tissue, since preferences can persist even when extracts of sun or shade-grown \nleaves are incorporated into artificial diets (Panzuto et al., 2001). These plant-mediated \nchanges interact with herbivore responses. For example, adults of some insect herbivores \nmay prefer high-light locations, including, for example, for egg laying (Alonso, 1997). \n10 \nThere are clear examples where such direct herbivore responses outweigh greater host \nquality of shade-grown plants (Sipura & Tahvanainen, 2000). Interestingly, an example \nwhere herbivore damage is more severe in plants grown at higher light is one of the few \nexamples where light-dependent variation in herbivory has been proven to have \nsignificant effects on host population dynamics (Louda & Rodman, 1996). In that study, \nthe native crucifer Cardamine cordifolia suffered significantly greater herbivory when \nnatural shade was removed. Some components of host resistance were reduced in full \nsun, but many were increased, and some of these changes appeared to be related to the \nmild water deficits that occurred in plants growing in full sun. Insects were also more \nabundant in the sun. Overall, changes in herbivory were attributed to the combined \neffects of changes in host defence (with responses perhaps being partly to light and partly \nto water deficits) and herbivore abundance (Louda & Rodman, 1996).  \n \nAlthough canopy shade may have slightly different effects on PAR and UV wavelengths \n(Grant & Heisler, 2001; Heisler et al., 2003; Grant et al., 2005), in broad terms the two \nare highly correlated across natural gradients between sun and shade. Thus, the great \nmajority of research into the effects of shade on herbivory will have manipulated both \nPAR and UV, even though the possible role of the UV-component of sunlight is generally \nignored in interpreting results. The growing literature on the specific effects of UV \nwavelengths on plant-herbivore interactions demonstrates that variation in UV, or at least \nUV-B, can be significant in many systems (Table 2). Indeed, it has been suggested that \ncyclical variation in the population of both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores may be \ndriven by the effects of natural variation in solar UV-B on host defensive chemistry \n11 \n(Selas et al., 2004). The experimental manipulation of UV-B alone results in changes in \nplant-herbivore interactions that show many parallels with those seen with broad-\nspectrum shading. In most studies, foliage from reduced UV-B environments is generally \nfound to be a higher quality resource for herbivores than foliage from unfiltered sunlight \nin terms of herbivore mortality, growth rates or the efficiency of food utilisation (Table \n2). In the field, defoliation due to herbivory is often increased when ambient solar UV-B \nis reduced using wavelength-specific filters (Table 2). However, as with \u201ctotal shade\u201d \ntreatments, both laboratory and field studies show that these UV effects vary between \nhost species, and perhaps genotype, and also between herbivores (Table 2). The \nmechanisms by which exposure to UV could directly affect insect herbivores remain \nrather unclear, although the visual systems of many insects perceive longer wavelength \nUV. The consequent disruption of foraging and dispersal in UV-deficient conditions can \nbe significant in both experimental studies (Mazza et al., 1999) and in the use of UV-\nopaque plastics for the control of horticultural pests such as thrips and whiteflies \n(reviewed by Raviv & Antignus, 2004). In the field, UV might also influence herbivore \npopulations through the suppression of entomopathogens, whether nematodes (Fujiie & \nYokoyama, 1998), fungi (Braga et al., 2001; Braga et al., 2002), bacteria (Myasnik et al., \n2001) or viruses (Shapiro & Domek, 2002).  \n \nThe extent to which reductions in solar UV contribute to the overall effects of shade on \nplant-herbivore interactions remains unclear. So far as we are aware, the only study to \nexplicitly consider the effects of both UV and shade is that of (Rousseaux et al., 2004) \nwho studied herbivory of Nothofagus antarctica. Both the number of sites attacked and \n12 \nthe area of leaf removed by insect herbivores were reduced on the sun-exposed side of the \ncanopy. This response occurred even when UV-opaque filters removed the UV-B \ncomponent of sunlight. However, removing UV-B significantly reduced leaf area \nremoved on both sun-exposed and shaded sites. This data suggests that the effects of UV-\nB and those of other components of natural shade can act independently, a contention that \nis supported by chemical changes induced (see below). \n \n2 Light and disease \nDay \/ night \nWhilst defoliation by many herbivores is sufficiently rapid to differentiate damage \noccurring during day from that at night, disease is a longer term process. Thus, it is not \nsurprising that, so far as we are aware, investigations of diurnal changes in plant-\npathogen interactions have dealt with specific aspects, such as sporulation, spore \ndispersal or infection. The concentration of air-borne spores in and around plant canopies \nis far higher at night than during the day in a wide range of fungi (Schmale & Bergstrom, \n2004; Gilbert, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). However, in other fungal pathogens spore \nconcentrations peak during the day (Gadoury et al., 1998; Su et al., 2000) or show more \ncomplex diurnal patterns (Hock et al., 1995). These processes in plant-pathogen \ninteractions may be influenced by the lower temperature, higher humidity or the presence \nof leaf surface water from dew occurring at night and, as with herbivory, it is not always \nclear what role is played by direct effects of light. However, there is clear evidence that \nspore release is initiated by light in some systems (Gadoury et al., 1998; Su et al., 2000). \nLight also directly inhibits spore germination and or germ tube growth in many plant \n13 \npathogenic fungi (Elison et al., 1992; Joseph & Hering, 1997; Tapsoba & Wilson, 1997; \nMueller & Buck, 2003; Beyer et al., 2004), and this is certainly the case for UV (Paul, \n2000). Overall, it is probably the case that plants are subject to greater challenge by many \npathogens at night than during the day, but this is certainly not the case for all pathogens.  \n \nShade  \nThe influence of shade on plant-pathogen interactions has been much less studied than \ncomparable effects on plant-herbivore interactions. However, a number of studies of non-\ncrop systems have shown that shade increases infection by a range of pathogens (Table \n1b). As with herbivory, there are exceptions to the usual expectation that disease is more \nsevere in the shade, as seen with coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix) (Soto-Pinto et al., 2002), \nanthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) of Euonymus fortunei (Ningen et al., 2005) \nand powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides) on oak (Quercus petraea: Kelly, 2002). \nFor the most part, the mechanisms by which shade influences plant-pathogen interactions \nremain poorly understood, although plant pathologists have often attributed the effects of \nshade to factors such as humidity or leaf surface wetness, which are clearly central to the \nbiology of many plant pathogens (Jarosz & Levy, 1988; Meijer & Leuchtmann, 2000; \nKoh et al., 2003). However, a number of studies have shown that infection by a range of \npathogens can be affected by the light environment of the host prior to inoculation. While \nwheat seedlings exposed to low light intensity were more susceptible to subsequent \ninoculation by Puccinia striiformis than dark-grown seedlings (de Vallavieille-Pope et \nal., 2002), in other cases infection is inversely proportional to pre-inoculation irradiances \n(Zhang et al., 1995; Shafia et al., 2001). This indicates direct effects of light on host \n14 \nresistance. Furthermore, Pennypacker, 2000), showed that reduced light led to increased \ninfection by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in soya bean, and Verticillium albo-atrum but not \nFusarium oxysporum in alfalfa. This was linked to host resistance mechanisms since the \neffects of shade in both crops only occurred in resistant genotypes where resistance was \nquantitative (requiring a large investment of resources) rather than qualitative (based on \nthe hypersensitive response, requiring a smaller investment of energy (Pennypacker, \n2000). These conclusions parallel much thinking concerning herbivore resistance (see \nbelow).  \n \nLight quality as well as light quantity can affect disease. Red light suppressed powdery \nmildew of cucumber, and the effect appeared to be reversed by far-red (Schuerger & \nBrown, 1997). There are also indications that host resistance may be induced by pre-\ninoculation exposure to red light (Islam et al., 1998; Rahman et al., 2002; Khanam et al., \n2005). Pathogenic fungi may respond directly to spectral balance, and this is exploited by \nthe use of plastic films which modify spectral balance as a component of disease control \nin horticulture. Films which transmit more blue light than longer or shorter wavelengths \ncan be used to suppress sporulation in downy mildews and Botrytis cinerea (Reuveni & \nRaviv, 1992, , 1997). Similarly, many plant pathogens use UV radiation as a cue to \nregulate sporulation, and films opaque to UV radiation can be used to reduce a wide \nrange of crop diseases (reviewed by Raviv & Antignus, 2004). However, manipulating \nUV has complex effects on pathosystems. While UV-A may stimulate sporulation, \nexposed fungal tissues can be vulnerable to UV-B radiation, and solar UV-B is a major \nconstraint on the spore survival of many pathogens (Paul, 2000). The effects of reduced \n15 \nUV-B may be sufficient to explain the overall increase in disease in shade (Gunasekera et \nal., 1997) or variation in cloud cover (Paul, 2000; Wu et al., 2000). Equally, prior \nexposure to UV can affect various components of host resistance. Exposure of the host \nbefore inoculation reduced subsequent infection in a range of pathosystems, but there are \nexceptions (reviewed by Gunasekera et al., 1997; Paul et al., 2000). Increases in infection \nwith increased UV-B have been sometimes attributed to host injury providing sites for \ncolonisation by necrotrophic pathogens (Manning & von Tiedemann, 1995), but it is now \nrecognised that this mechanism is probably confined to UV doses well above the ambient \nrange (Paul, 2000). Contrasting responses between pathosystems are certainly not \nexplained simply on the basis of biotrophic and necrotophic pathogens. Powdery mildews \n(Erysiphales) are biotrophic pathogens that grow on leaf surfaces exposed to incident \nradiation. There are several reports that UV-B exposure reduces powdery mildew \ninfections, both in the laboratory (Willocquet et al., 1996; Paul, 1997), and in the field \n(Keller et al., 2003). However, exposure to increased UV-B led to increased powdery \nmildew (Microsphaera alphitoides) in oak (Newsham et al., 2000), which is consistent \nwith the greater occurrence of this disease in open sites (Kelly, 2002). Overall, the \ncontribution of UV to shade effects on plant-pathogen interactions is likely to be a \nfunction of interactions between the relative effects of UV-A and UV-B on direct damage \nand spore induction in the pathogen, and host resistance mechanisms.  \n \nIV. Mechanisms of responses to the light environment: the whole plant perspective.  \nAs discussed above, the literature on the whole plant biology or ecology of the influence \nof light on plant-herbivore or plant-pathogen interactions is diverse. Responses are \n16 \nattributed to a wide range of possible underlying mechanisms not only in the host plant, \nbut also light effects on the herbivore or pathogen, or higher trophic levels. Responses \nmay also be associated with other environmental factors correlated with the light \nenvironment, rather than light per se. With this broad view of underlying mechanisms of \nresponse, light-mediated changes in the host plant are viewed as just one component of \nmany. Furthermore, agronomists, and especially ecologists, consider a wide range of host \ncharacteristics as being significant in determining the overall effects of light on herbivory \nor disease.  Chemical traits influencing herbivory include tissue nitrogen chemistry (e.g. \ntotal N concentration, C:N ratio, protein or amino acid concentration), carbohydrate \ncomposition (total carbohydrates or components such as the soluble fraction), or water \ncontent.  Aspects of morphology and physical properties such as leaf thickness, toughness \nand the possession of thorns or spines can also be significant for plant-herbivore \ninteractions.  In addition, the increase in specific leaf area with increasing shade that is \ncommonly observed across a range of species (e.g. Crotser et al., 2003; Curt et al., 2005; \nPoorter et al., 2006) not only influences leaf physical properties but may also change how \nherbivores respond to chemical defence by changing the relationship between chemical \ncontents and leaf area or biomass.  Changes in host resistance, whether constitutive or \ninduced by attack, certainly play an important role in coupling herbivory or disease to the \nlight environment, but this is certainly not the only significant mechanism. \n \n1. Host quality as a food resource for herbivores or pathogens \nIn a meta-analysis of studies of the effects of abiotic factors on leaf chemistry (Koricheva \net al., 1998), shade appeared to have little consistent effect on total leaf nitrogen \n17 \nconcentration or free amino acid concentration across a wide range of woody plant \nsystems. That analysis was explicitly limited to experimental manipulations of shading, \nand subsequent studies of this type have shown that shade increases total nitrogen and\/or \namino acid concentrations in some systems (Crone & Jones, 1999; Hemming & Lindroth, \n1999; Moon et al., 2000; Dormann, 2003; Henriksson et al., 2003; Baraza et al., 2004; \nMoran & Showler, 2005) although not in all (Louda & Rodman, 1996; Rowe & Potter, \n2000). Koricheva et al., 1998) did not consider responses to natural variation in light \nenvironment, due to position in canopy for example. Such studies frequently show \nsignificant decreases in leaf nitrogen under shade (e.g. Fortin & Mauffette, 2001, , 2002; \nYamasaki & Kikuzawa, 2003).  Research into canopy photosynthesis also shows that the \ndistribution of nitrogen in the canopy is in proportion to the distribution of absorbed light, \nwith the result that leaves in high light have high nitrogen concentration and contribute \nthe bulk of canopy carbon fixation (Leuning et al., 1995; dePury & Farquhar, 1997). \nExposure to UV-B often increases foliage nitrogen concentration (Hatcher & Paul, 1994; \nMcCloud & Berenbaum, 1999; Lindroth et al., 2000; Warren et al., 2002; Keller et al., \n2003; Milchunas et al., 2004) but has no effect in some systems (Salt et al., 1998; de la \nRosa et al., 2001; Zavala et al., 2001; Veteli et al., 2003; Zaller et al., 2003) and in others \ncauses decreased foliar nitrogen (Robson et al., 2003).  \n \nKoricheva et al., 1998) showed that shading of woody species had highly significant \neffects on the foliar concentrations of total carbohydrates, non-structural carbohydrates, \nstarch and, to a lesser extent, sugars. This analysis is corroborated by more recent \nresearch (Wainhouse et al., 1998; Hemming & Lindroth, 1999; Rowe & Potter, 2000; \n18 \nFortin & Mauffette, 2001; Henriksson et al., 2003) and the same response also occurs in \nherbaceous species (Moran & Showler, 2005). Shade also increases leaf water content \n(Louda & Rodman, 1996; Henriksson et al., 2003; Moran & Showler, 2005), which may \nhave a major influence on herbivore performance (Henriksson et al., 2003).  \n \n2. Mechanical defence: spines, thorns and leaf toughness.  \nLeaves grown under high light have greater mechanical toughness in a wide range of \nspecies (Sagers, 1992; Dudt & Shure, 1994; Bergvinson et al., 1995; Louda & Rodman, \n1996; Rowe & Potter, 1996; Henriksson et al., 2003; Martinez-Garza & Howe, 2005), \nalthough this is not always the case (Rowe & Potter, 2000). Leaf trichomes typically \ndecrease with shading (Franca & Tingey, 1994; Liakoura et al., 1997; Bentz, 2003) and \nin tomato, more mites were trapped in the trichomes of leaves grown under high light \nconditions (Nihoul, 1993). The effect of shade on spines, thorns and prickles is less clear. \nFisher et al., 2002) showed that reductions in the density of thorns in the tropical liana, \nArtabotrys hexapetalus growing in shaded sites was due to reduced irradiance rather than \nspectral quality. Bazely et al., 1991) also showed reduced physical defence (prickles) in \nRubus fruticosus in shaded sites, though this could not be attributed to light per se. \nChanges in the overall morphology and habit of woody plants under shade, rather than \nany specific physical defence, appear to be a key factor influencing some vertebrate \nherbivores (Iason et al., 1996; Hartley et al., 1997).  \n \n3. Defensive chemistry \n19 \nMany ecological studies of the mechanisms by which light influences herbivory (there is \nlittle comparable research on pathogens) have been conducted in the context of \nalternative theories of plant defence, such as the resource availability hypothesis (Coley \net al., 1985), growth differentiation balance hypothesis (GDB: Herms & Mattson, 1992) \nand carbon nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB: Bryant et al., 1983). These hypotheses \nshare in common the principle that plant allocation to defence is a function of \ncompetition between end-points (growth, storage, defence) for limited resources, such as \nphotosynthate. A meta-analysis of almost 150 published experimental tests of CNB in \nwoody species (Koricheva et al., 1998) revealed that the basic prediction of the \nhypothesis that shading would reduce concentrations of \u201ccarbon-based defensive \nchemicals\u201d (CBDCs) was broadly correct. Indeed, shading appeared to have a far \nstronger influence on such compounds than nitrogen supply, which CNB predicts will be \ninversely related to defence (Koricheva et al., 1998). When CBDCs were divided into \nthree subgroups, phenylpropanoids, hydrolysable tannins and terpenoids, all three were \nreduced by shading, with phenylpropanoids showing the greatest response (Koricheva et \nal., 1998). More recent research confirms that shading reduces concentrations of CBDCs, \nin herbaceous as well as woody species (Jansen & Stamp, 1997; Crone & Jones, 1999; \nHemming & Lindroth, 1999; Rowe & Potter, 2000; Tattini et al., 2000; Briskin & \nGawienowski, 2001; Henriksson et al., 2003). In addition, it is now clear that shading \nmay reduce concentrations of a wide range of secondary metabolites, not only of CBDCs, \nwhich have been the primary focus of studies associated with testing the CNB hypothesis. \nShade reduced cyanogenic glycosides but not CBDCs in Eucalyptus cladocalyx (Burns et \nal., 2002), while in Prunus turneriana, shade resulted in a change in the distribution of \n20 \ncyanogenic glycosides between older and younger leaves (Miller et al., 2004). However, \nshading did not affect the concentration of defensive amides in Piper cenocladum (Dyer \net al., 2004). Exposure to UV-B increased cyanogenic alkaloids in some genotypes of \nTrifolium repens (Lindroth et al., 2000) and the effects of UV-B on plant phenolics are \nnow very well established, and are not related to the ideas of resource limitation inherent \nin the CNB hypothesis. In general, increased exposure to UV-B results in increased \nconcentrations of total phenolics (Bassman, 2004), although there are exceptions \n(Rousseaux et al., 1998; Salt et al., 1998; Levizou & Manetas, 2001). Specific phenolic \ncompounds may show contrasting responses to UV-B, with flavonoids showing \nparticularly consistent increases (Lavola et al., 1998; Tegelberg & Julkunen-Tiitto, 2001; \nWarren et al., 2002; Lavola et al., 2003; Tegelberg et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2003; \nRousseaux et al., 2004), with well established dose responses in some cases (de la Rosa \net al., 2001).  \n \nOf course, it is certainly not the case that low light reduces the concentration of defensive \nchemicals in all plants (Burns et al., 2002), and a fundamental point is that not all \ncompounds decline in concentration under low light. This specificity in the effect of \nshading, and its relationship to the responses of herbivores to putative defensive \ncompounds has been the subject of intense discussion in the context of alternative \ndefence theories (Lerdau et al., 1994; Berenbaum, 1995; Hamilton et al., 2001; Close & \nMcArthur, 2002; Koricheva, 2002; Nitao et al., 2002). Specificity is best characterised \nfor phenolic compounds in woody species. For example, in Populus tremuloides, low \nlight reduced proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) but had less effect on phenolic \n21 \nglycosides, which were the main factor influencing herbivory (Hemming & Lindroth, \n1999). In Betula pubescens, total phenolics and soluble proanthocyanidins were reduced \nby shade netting treatments, but gallotannins (hydrolysable tannins), cell-wall-bound \nproanthocyanidins and flavonoids (including kaempferols and quercetins) were not \naffected (Henriksson et al., 2003). The phenolic composition of another birch species \n(Betula pendula) is influenced by light spectral quality. Tegelberg et al., 2004) concluded \nthat increasing R:FR shifted the balance of phenolics from chlorogenic acids to \nflavonoids, and that this effect was distinct from those of increasing UV-B, which \nincreased concentrations of many flavonoids (kaempferols and quercetins) and \nchlorogenic acids. Spectral modification had no effect on proanthocyanidins in Betula \npendula (Tegelberg et al., 2004), unlike shading treatment in Betula pubescens \n(Henriksson et al., 2003). Increased R:FR increased total phenolics in seedlings of \nImpatiens capensis (Weinig et al., 2004), although both these authors and Tegelberg et \nal., 2004) linked changes in phenolics with the reduced growth observed at higher R:FR. \nIn Nothofagus antarctica, removal of solar UV-B radiation increased the concentration of \nhydrolysable tannins (gallic acid and its derivatives) but decreased the concentration of a \nflavonoid aglycone (Rousseaux et al., 2004). Flavonoid aglycone was also increased on \nthe sun-exposed side of the canopy, as was quercetin-3-arabinopyranoside (Rousseaux et \nal., 2004).  \n \nThe responses of herbivore to shade-induced change in host chemistry are less well \nexplained by bulk chemistry (total phenolics for example), than concentrations of specific \ncompounds (Crone & Jones, 1999; Ossipov et al., 2001; Henriksson et al., 2003; \n22 \nLahtinen et al., 2004; Rousseaux et al., 2004). Overall, it is increasingly clear from the \necophysiological literature that the responses of defence-related chemicals to shade are \nfar more subtle that can be explained by the bulk diversion of carbon into secondary \nmetabolism that is predicted by the CNB hypothesis. The molecular and cellular literature \nis now beginning to shed light on some of the underlying mechanisms through which this \nfine-tuning of plant secondary metabolism is controlled (see Section VII). \n \nV. Short-term responses to the light environment \u2013 induced defences \nIn addition to the constitutive defences produced by plants that can be influenced by light, \nevidence is accumulating that induced defences may also be affected. Induced defences \nare those which involve rapid changes in biochemistry and gene expression in response to \nherbivore attack or pathogen infection. In the case of pathogen infection, such responses \nusually require molecular recognition events, such as classic gene-for-gene based \nresistance. Physical damage can also be sufficient to activate some responses, especially \nin the case of herbivore defence, although several elicitors of specific responses have \nbeen isolated from herbivore oral secretions. The term \u201cinduced resistance\u201d broadly \nrefers to plant responses such as the hypersensitive response (HR), the biosynthesis of \ndefensive secondary metabolites (e.g. phytoalexins), and the up-regulation of expression \nof defence genes (such as those encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and protease \ninhibitors). \n23 \n1. Pathogens \nThere is anecdotal evidence that the development of plant resistance to microbial \npathogens can often require illumination during the infection process. The scientific \nliterature contains a number of reports confirming this idea. For example, light is \nnecessary for development of resistance responses to Pseudomonas solanacearum in \ntobacco (Lozano & Sequeira, 1970), Xanthomonas oryzae in rice (Guo et al., 1993), and \nP. syringae and Peronospora parasitica in Arabidopsis (Mateo et al., 2004; Zeier et al., \n2004). Furthermore, red light treatments were able to induce resistance to Botrytis \ncinerea and Alternaria tenuissima in broad bean (Islam et al., 1998; Rahman et al., \n2003). As well as these studies on interactions between plants and pathogens, there are \nalso several examples of plant responses to isolated pathogenic elicitors that are also \nlight-dependent. For example, leaf necrosis in tomato in response to an avirulence elicitor \nfrom Cladosporium fulvum is substantially reduced in the dark (Peever & Higgins, 1989), \nand cell death induced by the fungal toxins AAL from Alternaria alternata (Moussatos et \nal., 1993) and fumonisin B1 (Asai et al., 2000; Stone et al., 2000) requires light, as does \nthe fumonisin B1-induced expression of the SAR marker gene, PR1 (Asai et al., 2000). In \naddition, necrotic lesion formation activated by over-expression of the tomato Pto disease \nresistance gene also requires light, although the same authors found that HR mediated by \nthe endogenous Pto gene in plants inoculated with an incompatible strain of P. syringae \nwas light-independent (Tang et al., 1999). This contrasts with the light-dependence of \nresistance to the same pathogen in Arabidopsis conferred through a different resistance-\navirulence gene interaction (Zeier et al., 2004). Interestingly, programmed cell death \ncaused by UV-C treatment also requires illumination with white light following a lethal \n24 \nUV-C dose in Arabidopsis (Danon et al., 2004). It is important to note, however, that in \naddition to these examples, there are many inducible defence responses that are clearly \nnot light-dependent. Indeed, responses to the same stimuli can involve light-dependent \nand independent elements. For example, whereas cell death in response to C. fulvum \nelicitor in tomato was light-dependent, lipoxygenase enzyme activation was not (Peever \n& Higgins, 1989). Finally, it should be noted that these findings tend to be rather ad hoc \nand based on light\/dark differences \u2013 very few studies have considered the qualitative or \nquantitative effects of light on resistance. \n \nIn green tissues, chloroplasts are an obvious target that can respond to changes in the \nlight environment, although chloroplasts might not be considered an obvious part of a \ndefence response. However, links between chloroplast function and disease resistance \nhave been identified in several systems. For example, silencing of the 33K subunit of the \noxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (Abbink et al., 2002), or over-expression of \nthe DS9 chloroplast metalloprotease (Seo et al., 2000), both increase susceptibility of \ntobacco plants to TMV infection. White leaves of the variegated albostrians barley \nmutant support increased growth of the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sch\u00e4fer et \nal., 2004) and fail to produce SA in response to powdery mildew infection (Jain et al., \n2004). In Arabidopsis, the presence of functional chloroplasts is also required for HR in \nleaves infected with an incompatible strain of P. syringae (Genoud et al., 2002). Thus, \nresistance in a number of different plant-pathogen interactions requires chloroplast \nfunction, though this does not necessarily mean that it requires light. \n \n25 \n2. Herbivores \nIn contrast to pathogen defence, there are relatively few specific studies on the influence \nof light on induced resistance against herbivores or responses to wounding. One \nexception to this is the class of so-called indirect defences. These involve the generation \nof complex mixtures of volatile compounds that are used by predators and insect \nparasitoids, such as parasitic wasps, as cues to locate their prey or hosts respectively \n(Par\u00e9 & Tumlinson, 1999). As noted above, many investigations of herbivore-induced \nvolatile production have shown that this response is largely light-dependent (e.g. \nLoughrin et al., 1994; Halitschke et al., 2000; Maeda et al., 2000; Gouinguene and \nTurlings, 2002). In general, volatile emission induced by herbivore feeding or by \napplication of methyl jasmonate appears to follow a diurnal cycle, with emission being \nmuch stronger during the light period than the dark. However, other defence-related \nvolatiles are also produced during the night (e.g. De Moraes et al., 2001). \n \nThe plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) plays a central role in controlling responses to \nwounding and herbivore attack and to infection by some pathogens, especially \nnecrotrophic fungi. The early steps of JA biosynthesis occur in the chloroplasts of \nwounded leaves (Turner et al., 2002), but JA synthesis is not necessarily light-dependent. \nWound-induced JA biosynthesis was observed in soybean hypocotyls in the dark \n(Creelman et al., 1992) and also occurs in non-photosynthetic tissues such as potato \ntubers (Koda & Kikuta, 1994). Furthermore, Zeier et al. (2004), observed that pathogen-\ninduced JA levels in Arabidopsis were higher in the dark than in the light. This suggests \nthat induced responses to wounding might be largely light-independent, though it is \n26 \nimportant to note that in the vast majority of studies, no direct comparison has been made \nbetween the wound-induced accumulation of JA under different light conditions, nor, \nimportantly, in the responses to wounding or JA. Where such comparisons have been \nmade, there is evidence in some cases that wound and JA-induced responses can in fact \nbe light-dependent. Most notable amongst these are the indirect defences, but direct \ndefence responses can also be light-dependent. For example, in a series of reports on the \nexpression of stress-inducible genes from rice, several were identified which in general, \nrequired light for their induction by wounding and by exogenous JA application (Agrawal \net al., 2002a,b,c, 2003). In Arabidopsis, the ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) gene, \nis also wound-induced, but by a JA-independent pathway. Instead, it appears to be \nregulated by changes in photosynthetic electron transport (PET) in wounded leaves, \nwhich results in increased levels of ROS (Chang et al., 2004). Interestingly, most of the \nlight-dependent wound-induced genes from rice are also responsive to applied H2O2 and \ncopper (a ROS generator), even in the dark (Agrawal et al., 2002b,c, 2003). These data \nsuggest that light-driven generation of ROS in chloroplasts around sites of wounding \nmight be responsible for the expression of a sub-set of wound-induced genes. \n \nVI. Mechanisms for light-dependent induced defences. \nWhilst there has been a large body of research defining the physiological basis for the \nlight-dependence of constitutive defences, the basis behind the affect of light on induced \nresistance is less well understood. There are two general mechanisms by which light \ncould regulate defence responses in plants. The first of these is based on the energetic \nstatus of light-driven chemical reactions (dependent on the ability of PET to generate \n27 \nATP and reducing power), and the second, the direct perception of light and downstream \nlight-responsive signalling pathways. \n \n1. Photosynthesis and ROS \nPhotosynthesis uses light energy to drive electrons through complex electron transport \nchains in the thylakoid membranes, which harvest the energy from activated carriers to \nultimately generate ATP and reducing power in the form of NADPH. These key \nmetabolites are then used in carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle, as well as in various \nother metabolic reactions that take place in the chloroplasts, such as fatty acid \nbiosynthesis and assimilation of nitrogen into amino acids. There are two ways in which \nthese light-dependent processes in chloroplasts could impact on short term, induced \ndefence responses. First, major changes in gene expression, protein synthesis and defence \nmetabolism could potentially be affected by the loss in the dark of substrates synthesized \nin chloroplasts. Interestingly, at least part of the biosynthetic pathways for three major \ndefence-related hormones, JA, SA and ABA are also located in plastids. Second, as \nindicated above, chloroplasts can be a significant source of ROS during stress conditions. \nPlant leaves acclimate to average ambient light intensities during their growth, such that \nthe levels of light harvesting complexes and Calvin cycle enzymes are optimised to make \nmost efficient use of the available light. However, when light intensities transiently \nincrease, or when carbon fixation is prevented, PET generates more electrons than can be \naccepted by the available electron acceptor NADP+. In these situations, free electrons \nfrom the electron transport chain can be transferred directly to oxygen to form ROS. \nSecondly, increased excitation energy can be dissipated via photorespiration, which \n28 \nultimately results in the generation of H2O2 in the peroxisomes. Normally, a range of \nbiochemical and physiological systems to minimise over-reduction of the electron \ntransport chain and to scavenge those ROS that are produced. However, under severe \nacute stress, ROS can accumulate to levels that exceed the chloroplast\u2019s array of \nantioxidant systems (Apel & Hirt, 2004). Additionally, damage to the chloroplasts or \ndisruption of chlorophyll biosynthesis can result in the accumulation of photosensitive \npigments that can directly generate ROS in the light. Since ROS are well known as \nimportant regulators of several defence responses (Apel & Hirt, 2004), significant \nperturbations in redox balance in the chloroplasts may contribute to ROS-regulated \ndefence. \n \nThe implications of the requirement for light for chloroplast-derived ROS may extend \nbeyond the direct signalling roles of ROS. For example, one consequence of ROS \nproduction under stress conditions is lipid peroxidation. Many of the products of lipid \nperoxidation reactions that occur following wounding or pathogen attack, are also \nreactive electrophile species - molecules with reactive (electrophilic) carbonyl groups \n(Vollenweider et al., 2000). Many of these electrophiles are now known to act as \nimportant signalling molecules, eliciting a range of defence responses ranging from cell \ndeath to defence gene expression (Vollenweider et al., 2000; Alm\u00e9ras et al., 2003; Thoma \net al., 2003; Cacas et al., 2005). Electrophiles produced as a consequence of stress may \neither be derived from direct attack of ROS on membrane lipids, or from the activity of \nlipoxygenase enzymes. Light is therefore likely to directly influence the generation of \nROS-derived electrophiles (and downstream responses), but not those generated by \n29 \nlipoxygenase activity. Interestingly, such effects have been noted in several interactions \nbetween plants and pathogens or their elicitors. For example, Montillet et al., (2005) \nfound that in response to the elicitor, cryptogein, cell death was mediated by light-\ndependent ROS in the light, but in the dark, cell death was independent of ROS and \ncorrelated with the activity of a specific lipoxygenase activity. Hence, different \nmechanisms for the production of bioactive electrophiles may be required to operate \nunder different light environments. \n \n2. Photosensitive pigments and ROS \nDuring pathogen resistance responses, the primary source of ROS is not the chloroplast, \nbut an enzyme found in the plasma membrane known as NADPH oxidase, or respiratory \nburst oxidase (Apel & Hirt, 2004). One might therefore assume that light-dependent, \nchloroplast-derived ROS are not likely to be important in pathogen defence. However, \nthe situation is not necessarily clear-cut, since the importance of the NADPH oxidase \ndoes not preclude an additional role for chloroplast ROS. Many researchers have isolated \nmutants from various species, collectively termed lesion mimic mutants, that display \nspontaneous formation of necrotic lesions on their leaves (Lorrain et al., 2003). These \nlesions are similar to those formed during the hypersensitive response (a key component \nof disease resistance responses) and are generally accompanied by the increased \nexpression of PR genes and increased resistance to infection. Generally, lesion mimic \nmutants were isolated and characterised as part of an effort to understand the mechanisms \nof disease resistance signalling. However, it is likely that in many cases, these mutants in \nfact highlight a more general link between chloroplast ROS and plant stress responses, \n30 \nincluding pathogen resistance. This idea is discussed in detail elsewhere by Mullineaux \nand colleagues (Karpinski et al., 2003; Bechtold et al., 2005), but is based on two \nfindings. First is the observation that lesion formation in many of these mutants is light-\ndependent (e.g. Johal et al., 1995; Genoud et al., 1998; Brodersen et al., 2002). Second, \ncloning of several of the genes defined by these mutations has identified a number of \ngenes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis or degradation (e.g. Hu et al., 1998; Ishikawa \net al., 2001; Mach et al., 2001; Pru\u017einska et al., 2003). In addition, manipulation of the \nexpression of several other genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis also results in \nlight-dependent lesion mimic phenotypes and increased disease resistance (e.g. Kruse et \nal., 1995; Mock & Grimm, 1997; Mock et al., 1999; Molina et al., 1999). The most likely \nexplanation for these observations is that reactive oxygen species are produced by the \naction of light on chlorophyll intermediates that act as photosensitizers \u2013 that is, they \nabsorb light energy which excites electrons that are subsequently transferred to molecular \noxygen to form ROS. These ROS then act as signals to initiate plant defence responses, \nincluding pathogen resistance. \n \nClearly then, the light-dependent generation of ROS from free photosensitive pigments or \nthose present in the photosynthetic light harvesting complexes can impact on defence in \nmutants and transgenic plants with altered chloroplast biology. The question, then, is \nwhether they do so under normal circumstances. At present, it is not possible to answer \nthis question, but it is likely that plants have evolved mechanisms to deal with the \nproblems of light-dependent ROS generation in tissues under attack from pests and \npathogens. For example, the Arabidopsis CHLOROPHYLLASE 1 (AtCHL1) gene is \n31 \ninvolved in chlorophyll degradation, and is required to remove photosensitive porphyrin \nring intermediates. AtCHL1 is induced by wounding and infection with necrotrophic \npathogens (Benedetti et al., 1998; Kariola et al., 2005), at which time it functions to \nprevent accumulation of ROS generated from breakdown products of chlorophyll \nreleased from damaged chloroplasts. Plants with reduced AtCHL1 gene expression show \nincreased resistance to Erwinia carotovora, a necrotrphic bacterial pathogen, but \nincreased susceptibility to Alternaria brassicicola, a fungal necrotroph (Kariola et al., \n2005). Resistance to E. carotovora is conferred by an SA-dependent pathway, whilst \nresistance to A. brassicicola is normally regulated via JA-dependent signalling. Since \nROS can potentiate SA-dependent defences which in turn can antagonise JA-dependent \nresistance, it appears that AtCHL1 might modulate the balance between SA- and JA-\ndependent resistance pathways by controlling ROS generation from chlorophyll \nmetabolites. Interestingly, over-expression of the ACD2 red chlorophyll catabolite \nreductase gene in Arabidopsis, which would be expected to reduce the accumulation of \nphotosensitizers, generated increased tolerance to a virulent strain of P. syringae (Mach \net al., 2001). In these plants, bacterial growth was not affected, but cell death symptoms \nwere reduced. \n \nWhilst beyond the scope of this review, it is also notable that many plant species \nsynthesize photosensitizers that are thought to act as direct defences. In the presence of \nUV-B or white light, these so-called phototoxins generate ROS that function to directly \ninhibit herbivore or pathogen function (Downum, 1992). Conversley, several genera of \nfungal pathogens also produce photosensitive toxins, such as cercosporin, that result in \n32 \nplant cell necrosis (Daub & Ehrenshaft, 2000). \n \n3. Light signalling \nThe second major mechanism suggested above by which light may regulate defence is via \ndirect light-responsive signalling pathways. Evidence for this type of regulation has been \nrecently uncovered in Arabidopsis. Genoud et al. (1998) identified an Arabidopsis light \nsignalling mutant, psi2, that in addition to effects on light-dependent expression of \nphotosynthetic genes, displayed light-dependent development of spontaneous necrotic \nlesions and increased PR1 gene expression. Further characterisation of these phenotypes \nshowed that light regulated the resistance responses at multiple levels. First, PSI2 is a \nregulator of phytochrome-mediated responses, and PhyA and PhyB are also required for \nlight-dependent HR lesion formation and PR gene expression (Genoud et al., 2002). \nConsequently, resistance to P. syringae is reduced in phytochrome mutants and increased \nin the psi2 mutant. This illustrates an example of light acting in a direct signalling role to \nmodulate induced resistance. How and why phytochrome signalling might impact on \ndisease resistance is unclear, though it might represent a sensitive mechanism by which \ncytosolic and nuclear responses are matched with changes in chloroplast activity caused \nby variations in light intensity. Perhaps significantly, in these experiments, HR (although \nnot PR gene expression) also required the presence of functional chloroplasts, since cell \ndeath was not observed in white sectors of variegated leaves. Hence, both metabolic and \nsignalling roles for light may combine to co-ordinate a full resistance response. \n \n33 \nIn terms of induced defences, therefore, we can identify a range of different levels of \ninteraction between light and responses to biotic attack. These include a range of effects \non ROS generation, as well as direct signalling roles for light via phytochrome signalling, \nand are summarised in Figure 1. \n \nVII. Interpreting interactions between light and defence responses.  \nIn assessing the range of experimental systems discussed above, a general conclusion is \nthat where light has been found to modulate plant defence against herbivores or disease, \nthen its effect is usually to increase defence. A key question, therefore, is whether we can \nidentify mechanistic explanations for this observation. As is often the case, ecologists and \nmolecular biologists have taken very different approaches to the question of interactions \nbetween light and defence. Given that this is a complex interaction with different \ncomponents, it is not surprising that such different approaches are possible. Clearly, the \nfundamental importance of light for plant growth and development means that there is no \nsingle explanation that can unite observations across widely different scales of \norganisation. However, one way forward is to place the whole range of evidence, from \nmolecular to ecophysiological, within the framework of optimal defence theory \n(Hamilton et al., 2001). Is a greater investment in defence in high light consistent with \noptimal defence theory, and, if so, does the molecular and cellular data provide insights \ninto the mechanisms through which optimal defence is achieved? This relates to a second \nimportant point which is the precise terminology used to describe defence. The semantics \nof defence in plant pathogen or plant herbivore interactions, which has been widely \ndebated by ecologists and ecophysiologists (Clarke, 1986; Stowe et al., 2000), but less so \n34 \nby cell and molecular biologists, forms a pertinent background to these questions. \nDefence is defined as any mechanism that protects the plant from reductions in fitness in \nthe presence of herbivores or pathogens and has two components. The first component is \nresistance, which reduces the severity of attack by inhibiting the activity or performance \nof the herbivore or pathogen. The second component is tolerance, which reduces the \nnegative consequences of attack on host fitness. In our view the clear differentiation \nbetween resistance and tolerance is essential to understanding mechanisms of interactions \nbetween light and defence.  \n \nThe first requirement of optimal defence theory, that tissues which have the greatest \nvalue to the plant should be most defended, is clearly satisfied. Models of canopy \nphotosynthesis are consistent in showing that leaves exposed to high light contribute most \nphotosynthate (Leuning et al., 1995; dePury & Farquhar, 1997). Secondly, defence \nshould be in proportion to the probability of attack. There are clearly many systems in \nwhich herbivores are more abundant and\/or more active in high-light environments, for \nexample due to higher temperatures (see section III). Arguably, the higher nitrogen \nconcentration of high light tissues may increase their potential palatability for herbivores, \nand so increase the risk of attack. There are certainly examples where exposed tissues \nsuffer more herbivory even though they are better defended (e.g. Louda & Rodman, \n1996; Sipura & Tahvanainen, 2000). These arguments are harder to apply for pathogens, \nand if anything, it might be expected that the probability of infection might be lower \nunder high light conditions due partly to direct light effects (see Section II) and partly to \nthe correlated lower humidity and leaf surface water. The third requirement of optimal \n35 \ndefence theory is that defence is a function of the balance between its benefits and its \ncosts. The \u201cbroad-brush\u201d prediction of the CNB hypothesis, that defence is less costly \nunder high light conditions because substrates are more freely availability, fails to explain \nthe specificity in the responses of individual metabolites to the light environment. \nNonetheless, there are a number of other mechanisms that could result in altered costs of \ndefence under different light conditions.  \n \nOne element of changed costs of defence may relate to the induction of shade-avoidance \nmechanisms under low light conditions. The possible trade-offs between defence and \nshade avoidance responses at low light as they relate to competitive ability has recently \nbeen reviewed by Cipollini, 2004), who argued that shade avoidance responses could \nconstrain defence via a number of mechanisms. Firstly, the shift in allocation to extension \ngrowth under shade might directly compete with allocation to defence, although not \nnecessarily by competition for resources. There may be direct interference between the \nsignalling mechanisms controlling acclimation to the light environment and those \nregulating defence. Increased stem elongation in the shade response is under the control \nof auxins and gibberellins (Vandenbussche & Van Der Straeten, 2004). Auxin may \ninteract with defence via cross-talk between IAA and defence signalling, such that IAA \nreduces JA-induced production of defence compounds (Kernan & Thornburg, 1989; \nBaldwin et al., 1997). Conversely, the levels of active auxins and the expression of auxin \nresponse genes are reduced by wounding (Thornburg & Li, 1991; Cheong et al., 2002; \nSchmelz et al., 2003) and herbivory (Schmelz et al., 2003). Cipollini, 2004) also \nsuggested that cell wall stiffening might be a mechanism for antagonism between shade \n36 \navoidance and defence, with the gibberellin\u2013mediated cell wall loosening leading to \nincreased cell expansion in the shade being incompatible with the cell-wall stiffening that \ncan be a significant component of defence.  \n \nCipollini (2004) described the interference between the shade-response and defence as an \nopportunity cost but equally, there may be a range of \u201copportunity benefits\u201d that reduce \nthe cost of defence in high light, because processes induced for photoprotection also \nconfer protection against biotic attack. High light stress, including UV-B irradiation, \nactivates molecular responses that have much in common with pathogen and herbivore \nresponses (Mackerness et al., 1999; Rossel et al., 2002; Kimura et al., 2003; Izaguirre et \nal., 2003; Stratmann, 2003). In fact, the increasing documentation of the kinds of \nresponses induced by various biotic and abiotic stresses makes it clear that there are many \noverlaps in these responses. To try to understand the significance of these overlapping \nresponses, it is useful to consider what the functions of induced responses to these \ndifferent environmental factors might be. For example, many stress responses include \nincreases in the accumulation of antioxidants and the expression of protective chaperone \nproteins (such as heat shock proteins and osmoprotective proteins). Many forms of \nenvironmental insult will disrupt biochemistry leading to increased ROS generation for \nexample, requiring increased antioxidant production to counteract their cytotoxic effects. \nWhile there may be many mechanisms for \u201copportunity benefits\u201d, in our view, many may \nbe based on the involvement of ROS in responses to light, herbivory and disease. \nUnderstanding these potential mechanisms requires careful differentiation between \nresistance and tolerance.  \n37 \n \nLight and the resistance components of defence against herbivore or pathogen \nattack \nLight-driven generation of ROS in damaged plants may be central to interactions between \nlight and the resistance components of defence against pathogens or herbivores. \nPhotosensitive chlorophyll degradation intermediates formed as a result of cellular \ndamage caused by herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens can contribute to ROS \ngeneration and defence signalling (Kariola et al., 2005), as does excess hydrogen \nperoxide derived from photorespiration (e.g. Champognol et al., 1998; Mateo et al., \n2004). Several studies described in Section V also indicate a requirement for functional \nchloroplasts to activate the HR during pathogen resistance, which might also suggest a \nfunctional relationship between light-driven reactive oxygen chemistry and defence. \nNADPH oxidase is clearly an important source of ROS for defence signalling, but is \nmetabolically costly (in terms of NADPH consumption). It is possible that in some \nsystems, ROS generation is supplemented by the action of light on photosensitive \npigments such as chlorophyll. Potentially, ROS provides a basis for a \u201csupply side\u201d \nhypothesis very different from CNB. Resistance is facilitated in (high) light tissue \nbecause ROS for signalling can be supplied at less cost via light-driven reactions than \nthose occurring in the dark. Interestingly, there is evidence that elevated UV-B can \nenhance wound-induced defensive chemicals (Levizou & Manetas, 2001).  \n \nThere are also specific examples of proteins involved in both resistance and responses to \nlight that may be directly involved in signalling cross-talk. The zinc finger transcriptional \n38 \nregulator, LSD1 is an Arabidopsis protein first identified through a genetic mutation \nwhich conferred a runaway cell death phenotype (Jabs et al., 1996). The LSD1 gene has \nbeen studied mainly with regard to its role as a negative regulator of pathogen-induced \nhypersensitive cell death. More recently, however, it has also been shown that LSD1 is \nalso involved in acclimation to high light stress (Mateo et al., 2004). Interestingly, the \nsame authors showed that the effects of LSD1 on pathogen-induced cell death are \nmediated by ROS generated during light-dependent photorespiration. NPR1\/NIM1 is \nanother signalling protein identified as a key regulator of multiple pathogen resistance \npathways. Over-expression of a rice NPR1 gene leads not only to elevated disease \nresistance, but also to hypersensitivity to light (Chern et al., 2005). \n \nLight and the tolerance components of defence against herbivore or pathogen attack \nAs noted above, both biotic attack and light stress are sources of oxidative stress in plant \ntissues. Furthermore, light and biotic attack may also act synergistically to increase \noxidative stress. Biotic stress can result in uncoupling of the light and dark reactions of \nphotosynthesis, meaning that \u201cnormal\u201d ambient light levels cause ROS generation from \nphotosynthesis (Bechtold et al., 2005). One common feature of many stress responses is \nthe down-regulation of genes encoding many components of the photosynthetic \nmachinery (e.g. Izaguirre et al., 2003; Kimura et al., 2003). This may serve as a negative \nfeedback loop to reduce ROS generation, but also to shift metabolism into areas that \ncompete with photosynthesis, such as the oxidative pentose phosphate and shikimic acid \npathways (Scharte et al., 2005). Plant mechanisms involved in protection against \noxidative stress or repairing the damage it causes are known to be activated by both light \n39 \nand herbivore or pathogen attack (e.g. Rossel et al., 2002; Kimura et al., 2003; Apel & \nHirt, 2004). A key point is that these are tolerance mechanisms not resistance. Clear \ndifferentiation between such mechanisms and resistance (i.e. mechanisms that inhibit the \nherbivore or pathogen) is central to understanding interactions between light and defence, \nnot least the widely discussed role of phenolic compounds in such interactions. \n \nPlant phenolics are a highly diverse group of chemicals that fulfil a range of functions. \nSome phenolics have demonstrable roles in plant interactions with herbivores or \npathogens, either as components of resistance (see above) or as attractants for herbivores \n(e.g. Roininen et al., 1999; Ikonen et al., 2002). Other phenolics function as action as \n\u201csunscreens\u201d or antioxidants, and some authors have argued that photoprotection is the \nprimary role of many plant phenolics (Close & McArthur, 2002). In considering \ninteractions between light and defence, key points are (i) that plants in high light \nconditions are potentially confronted with the risk of increased herbivory (see above) and \nthe concurrent need for photoprotection and (ii) that both light and attack can induce \noxidative stress. Under such conditions phenolic compounds might fulfil at least three \nfunctions: (a) sun-screens reducing light penetration to vulnerable tissues (not selected for \nby herbivory or disease), (b) antioxidants involved in reducing the damage caused by \nROS (selected for by biotic attack as well as light) and (c) resistance compounds \ninhibiting the activity of herbivore or pathogen (not selected for by light).  \nThese multiple functions would be expected to result in the compound-specific changes \nin the concentration of phenolics evident in the recent ecophysiological literature (see \nSection IV). They would also be expected to lead to different trade-offs in the production \n40 \nof phenolics. In terms of tolerance, the production of phenolic antioxidants in high light \ntissue might be seen as an opportunity benefit for defence against biotic attack. \nConversely, the synthesis of phenolics conferring resistance (sensuo stricto) against \nherbivory or disease may represent an opportunity cost on the production of phenolics \nacting as sun-screens, and vice versa. \n \nThe different trade-offs discussed above might be expected to be reflected in enzyme \nactivity and gene expression. From this perspective the three functions of phenolics noted \nabove, while distinct, might all be expected to be associated with an elevated basal flux \nthrough the phenylpropanoid pathway. This may explain some of the parallels in terms of \nglobal gene expression between herbivory and light stress (e.g. Izaguirre et al., 2003; \nGachon et al., 2005). Most commonly, it is the genes encoding the enzymes controlling \nentry of substrates into the phenylpropanoid pathway, such as phenylalanine ammonia \nlyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) that are noted as responsive to multiple \nstresses. However, such induction of PAL or CHS is clearly only one element in the \nregulation of the phenylpropanoid pathways and there are examples of competition \nbetween elements of phenylpropanoid metabolism delivering compounds with different \nfunctions. In Sorghum bicolor there is competition between the accumulation of \nanthocyanin in response to light and the synthesis of phytoalexins in response to \nchallenge by the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Lo & Nicholson, 1998). This was \nattributed to the down-regulation of genes specific to anthocyanin biosynthesis and the \ncorresponding up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in phytoalexin \nsynthesis (Lo & Nicholson, 1998). Similarly, in grapes, there appears to be competition \n41 \nbetween the production of anthocyanins of photoprotection and phytoalexins (resveratrol) \nfor defence against pathogens (Jeandet et al., 1995).  \n \nThese results show that the plant is able to \u201cfine-tune\u201d phenolic metabolism as the \nbalance of costs and benefits shift in the face of competing end-points. Recent detailed \nanalyses are revealing the details of the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. In \nthe field, exposure of Vaccinium myrtillus to full sunlight up-regulates a whole series of \nphenylpropanoid pathway enzymes but changes in PAL and CHS are much smaller than \nchanges in \u201cdownstream\u201d enzymes involved in the synthesis of specific photoprotective \ncompounds (Jaakola et al., 2004). It is clear that sets of several phenylpropanoid pathway \ngenes, for example those involved in flavanol or monolignol biosynthesis, are co-\nregulated during both development and stress responses (Gachon et al., 2005). In the case \nof light-responsive expression of flavanol biosynthesis, one mechanism for this co-\nregulation was demonstrated to stem from the possession of common transcription factor \nbinding sites in the promoters of co-regulated genes (Hartmann et al., 2005). However, \nwhile there is clearly co-regulation of major elements of the phenylpropanoid pathway, \nnot all enzymes are represented in these gene expression clusters (Gachon et al., 2005). \nFurthermore, many key downstream enzymes exist in different isoforms with different \nsubstrates and products, fulfilling different functions (Kumar & Ellis, 2003). Thus, up-\nregulation of a single enzyme, or even a cluster of co-regulated elements of a pathway \nunder high light or biotic attack may reveal little without understanding the behaviour of \nthose enzymes controlling pathway endpoints.  \n \n42 \nIn our view, there is no single answer to the question of how light alters the cost of \ndefence against herbivory or pathogen attack. However, on the balance of the evidence, it \nseems likely that costs will often become lower with increasing light. This, taken with the \ngreater value of high light tissues and the greater risk of attack, at least by herbivores, \nsuggests that the greater defence is consistent with the predictions of optimal defence \ntheory. The argument that plants have fine control of defence metabolism, which is a \nmajor contrast to \u201csupply-side\u201d theories such as CNB, is well-established (e.g. \nBerenbaum, 1995), and molecular studies are increasingly revealing the nature of such \nfine control. Research at the scale of the transcriptome and metabolome have begun to \nprovide information on the mechanisms by which optimum defence is achieved. \nHowever, it is clear that proper understanding of optimum defence cannot be gained \nthrough quantification of bulk changes at the whole plant or whole organ level, whether \nin global gene expression, or in bulk measures of defensive chemistry, such as total \nphenolics. What is required is more detailed temporal and spatial resolution of the \nresponses of specific genes or compounds in the context of their function in the plant \nunder biotic attack and different light conditions. \n \nWhilst ecologists and molecular biologists have mostly taken different approaches to the \nquestion of interactions between light and defence, we feel that these approaches can \nprovide an interface which can deliver benefits to both sets of disciplines. Work across \nthese scales can be extremely effective in linking molecular responses with \u2018real life\u2019 \necological outcomes to stress (see, for example, work from the group of Ian Baldwin), \n43 \nand we strongly encourage efforts to integrate molecular and ecological studies in all \nareas of biology. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWork on this topic in the authors laboratories was supported by a Royal Society \nUniversity Research Fellowship (MRR) and research grants from DEFRA (CSA6138) \nand the UK Horticultural Research Council (CP19) to NDP.

These studies specifically manipulated ultraviolet \nradiation using lamps or wavelength-selective filters. Unless otherwise stated only UV-B (290-320nm) has been experimentally \nmanipulated.  \nHost \/ herbivore Experimental conditions Effect of UV manipulation Source \nIpomoea batata\/ Bemisia tabaci, \nFrankliniella occidentalis, or Aphis gossypii.  \nPolythene tunnels with ambient \nor attenuated total solar UV Substantial reductions in attack by all three insects 1 \nZea mays \/ Ostrinia nubilalis  + or \u2013 UV in the glasshouse Larvae preferred leaves grown without UV-B 2 \nOryza sativa \/ Helicoverpa armigera Artificial UV-B irradiation \nExtracts of irradiated leaves had antifeedant, growth-inhibitory \nand antibiotic properties against larvae, and effects persisted \ninto adults, which laid fewer, less viable eggs.  \n3 \nBemisia argentifolii and Frankliniella \noccidentalis  \nPolythene tunnels with ambient \nor attenuated total solar UV \nInsects dispersed preferentially into ambient UV \nenvironments, but UV had no effect on flight ability. 4 \nPisum sativum \/ Autographa gamma CE room with a range of UV-B doses \nIncreased UV-B increased leaf nitrogen and when foliage was \nfed to larvae this was correlated with an increase in larval \ngrowth rate and a reduction in the amount of plant material \nconsumed.  \n5 \nTrifolium repens \/ Spodoptera litura or \nGraphania mutans  \nCE room with and without UV-\nB \n36% reduction in weight of S. litura on foliage grown at high \nUV, but this depended on host genotype. G. mutans showed \nlittle response  \n6 \nGlycine max \/ Caliothrips phaseoli Ambient or near zero UV-B in the field \nUV-B reduced thrip herbivory: insects preferred leaves from \nreduced UV-B and avoided solar UV.  7 \nCaliothrips phaseoli Ambient or near zero UV-B in the field Insects preferred low UV-B environment 8 \nLolium perenne and Festuca spp. \/ \nSchistocerca gregaria  \nAmbient and elevated UVA or \nUV-B in the field \nNo herbivore responses to excised leaves from different UV-B \ntreatments except in F. pratensis where responses varied with \nUV treatment and\/or endophyte infection of the host \n9 \nPlantago lanceolata \/ Precis coenia or \nTrichoplusia ni  \nCE room at high ambient or \nabove.  \nGrowth of T. ni larvae was faster when fed excised leaves \nfrom elevated UV-B. Direct exposure of larvae to the UV \ntreatments increased mortality of T. ni. UV had no significant \neffects on P. coenia.  \n10 \nTrialeurodes vaporariorum Polythene tunnels with ambient \nor attenuated total solar UV \nAttenuation of UV reduced whitefly dispersion, resulting in \nreduced populations in low UV tunnels 11 \nQuercus robur \/ natural herbivore \ncommunity \nAmbient and elevated UVA or \nUV-B in the field \nPlants under elevated UV-B or UV-A suffered greater \nherbivory 12 \nGunnera magellanica and natural herbivore \ncommunity \nAmbient or near zero UV-B in \nthe field Leaf area damaged increased under reduced UV-B. 13 \nGunnera magellanica and natural herbivore \ncommunity \nAmbient or near zero UV-B in \nthe field Leaf area consumed increased 25-75% under attenuated UV-B 14 \n68 \nNothofagus antarctica and natural herbivore \ncommunity \nAmbient or near zero UV-B in \nthe field, and sun-exposed and \nshaded branches \nSolar UV-B reduced insect damage by at least 30%, and this \noccurred with foliage in both sunny and shaded positions.  15 \nCalluna vulgaris \/ Strophingia ericae \n(Homoptera) \nAmbient and elevated UV-B in \nthe field \nIncreased UV-B reduced herbivore population density over \ntwo seasons  16 \nSalix myrsinifolia and S. phylicifolia \/ \nPhratora vitellinae or natural herbivore \ncommunity \nAmbient and elevated UV-B in \nthe field \nHerbivores more abundant under elevated UV-B but host did \nnot suffer greater herbivore damage. Excised leaves of S. \nphylicifolia, from elevated UV-B reduced growth of P. \nvitellinae larvae compared with control leaves, but there was \nno comparable effect with leaves of S. myrsinifolia.  \n17 \nPopulus trichocarpa \/ Chrysomela scripta Zero, ambient and 2x ambient Leaves from highest UV-B significantly reduced larval \nconsumption efficiency  18 \n6 plant species and Deroceras reticulatum \n(Mollusca) \nAmbient or near zero UV-B in \nthe field \nSignificant effects in two of the six species. In Nothofagus \nantarctica, leaf area consumed reduced by 2\/3rds in foliage \nfrom under near-ambient UV-B. In Carex decidua twice as \nmuch as leaf area was consumed in reduced UV-B radiation. \n19 \nGlycine max \/ Anticarsia emmatalis or \nnatural herbivore community \nAmbient or near zero UV-B in \nthe field \nLeaves from reduced UV-B were more attractive to larvae, \nsupported higher growth rates and lower mortality. No direct \neffect of UV exposure on larval mortality. Attentuation of UV \nincreased natural herbivore damage by 2-fold. \n20 \nMorus nigra \/ Bombyx mori Artificial UV irradiation in CE \nrooms  \nUV treatments reduced consumption of foliage by larvae. 21 \n \nLiterature cited in Table 2.  \n1, Antignus et al., 1996; 2, Bergvinson et al., 1995; 3, Caasi-Lit, 2005; 4, Costa & Robb, 1999; 5, Hatcher & Paul, 1994; 6, Lindroth et al., 2000; 7, \nMazza et al., 1999; 8, Mazza et al., 2002; 9, McLeod et al., 2001; 10, McCloud & Berenbaum, 1999; 11, Mutwiwa et al., 2005; 12, Newsham et al., \n1999; 13, Rousseaux et al., 1998; 14, Rousseaux et al., 2001; 15, Rousseaux et al., 2004; 16, Salt et al., 1998; 17, Veteli et al., 2003; 18, Warren et al., \n2002; 19, Zaller et al., 2003; 20, Zavala et al., 2001; 21, Yazawa et al., 1992.  \n \n \n69 \nFigure Legends: \nFigure 1. Impacts of light on plant resistance against pests and pathogens. \nDifferent forms of biotic attack (top row) activate different major routes to resistance \n(second row), as well as repair and healing mechanisms. Light can act positively (solid \narrows) or negatively (barred lines), via a number of distinct pathways. Many of these \naffect the generation of reactive oxygen species, which appears to be a key node for the \ninteractions between light and defence. \n \n \n"}
