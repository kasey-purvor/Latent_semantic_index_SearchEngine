A comprehensive understanding of the solar wind\ninteraction with Earth\u2019s coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem requires an ability to observe the charged particle en-\nvironment and auroral activity from the same platform, gen-\nerating particle and photon image data which are matched\nin time and location. While unambiguous identification of\nthe particles giving rise to the aurora requires a Low Earth\nOrbit satellite, obtaining adequate spatial coverage of auro-\nrae with the relatively limited field of view of current space\nbourne auroral imaging systems requires much higher orbits.\nA goal for future satellite missions, therefore, is the develop-\nment of compact, wide field-of-view optics permitting high\nspatial and temporal resolution ultraviolet imaging of the au-\nrora from small spacecraft in low polar orbit. Microchannel\nplate optics offer a method of achieving the required perfor-\nmance. We describe a new, compact instrument design which\ncan observe a wide field-of-view with the required spatial\nresolution. We report the focusing of 121.6 nm radiation us-\ning a spherically-slumped, square-pore microchannel plate\nwith a focal length of 32 mm and an F number of 0.7.

Bannister\n(npb@star.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nObservations of the aurora (representing magnetic field-\nmapped images of magnetospheric plasma populations), in\ncombination with ionospheric flow monitoring from the\nground and space, provide unique information on magneto-\nspheric dynamics and are thus a powerful diagnostic for the\nway in which the solar wind influences auroral activity (Doe\net al., 1997). Beginning with the Dynamics Explorer 1 satel-\nlite (Frank et al., 1981), several missions have obtained ultra-\nviolet images of the auroral oval (as opposed to non-imaging\nmeasurements made on earlier missions). These observations\ncan be combined with measurements from particle and field\ndetectors and with ground-based radar data to derive a com-\nprehensive understanding of the solar wind interaction with\nEarth\u2019s coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system (e.g. Mi-\nlan et al., 2003).\nAuroral imaging missions typically occupy highly ellip-\ntical, high-altitude near-polar orbits to ensure efficient cov-\nerage of high latitudes. For example, the IMAGE space-\ncraft had an initial apogee of \u223c45 000 km over the Northern\nHemisphere (Mende et al., 2000), and a perigee of 1000 km.\nHowever, in-situ monitoring of the charged particles re-\nsponsible for the production of auroral displays requires in-\nstrumentation in low Earth orbit (LEO); for example, the\nFast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST) was launched into\na 351\u00d74175 km polar orbit (Carlson et al., 1998), while\nsatellites of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\n(DMSP) are in 830 km circular near-polar orbits (see for ex-\nample Rich et al., 1985).\nThe different orbits of particle detector and auroral imager\nspacecraft preclude complete correlation of data. Further-\nmore, current auroral imagers are unable to provide a simul-\ntaneous match to the coverage and spatial resolution of mod-\nern ground-based radar systems such as the Super Dual Au-\nroral Radar Network \u201cSuperDARN\u201d (Greenwald et al., 1995)\nfrom LEO. Wide-field coverage requires the use of high al-\ntitudes, while high spatial resolution can only be achieved\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n520 N. P.

Imaging the entire auro-\nral oval requires a field of view (FOV) of\u223c136\u25e6 at an altitude\nof 800 km above the pole (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998),\nand conventional optics fall significantly short of these re-\nquirements. For example, the Wideband Imaging Camera\n(WIC) onboard IMAGE has a 17\u25e6\u00d717\u25e6 FOV and a spatial\nresolution of 52\u00d752 km per pixel at apogee, or 1.2\u00d71.2 km\nat perigee (Mende et al., 2000; Frey et al., 2001), while the\nultraviolet imager on Freja (with a 600\u00d71700 km orbit) had a\nFOV of 22.4\u25e6\u00d730\u25e6 and a spatial resolution of 5 km at apogee\n(Murphree et al., 1994). Figure 1 shows the coverage of the\naccessible hemisphere of the Earth as a function of geocen-\ntric radial distance for FOV values between 1\u25e6 and 20\u25e6. It is\nclear that acceptable auroral coverage is only achievable, us-\ning conventional optics, from geocentric orbital radii greater\nthan about \u223c3.5RE , at the expense of spatial resolution (and\nfeasibility, given that the majority of mission opportunities\nare likely to be in LEO).\nThe goal of synoptic auroral imaging requires an innova-\ntive step in optical design. In this paper we describe a novel\ndesign for a wide FOV far ultraviolet (FUV) auroral imager\nbased on microchannel plate (MCP) optics technology. The\nWide Field Auroral Imager (WFAI), shown in Fig. 2, consists\nof several subsystems. Microchannel plate (MCP) optics fo-\ncus a wide field, high resolution image of the aurora onto a\ndetector consisting of a curved (\u201cslumped\u201d) MCP electron\nmultiplier and resistive anode readout, which records the po-\nsition and arrival time of photons, allowing the scanning mo-\ntion of the orbital platform to be removed from the image.\nAlthough the detector has negligible energy resolution, the\nuse of appropriate filters allows quantitative observations in\nparticular wavelength regions of interest. In the following\n 30\n \nFig. 1. Percentage coverage of a hemisphere of the Earth versus orbital radius for FOV values \nbetween 1\u00ba and 20\u00ba.

In Sect. 4 we describe the\nperformance of a prototype MCP optic of 3 cm focal length,\nand in Sect. 5 we consider an MCP detector of pronounced\nconvex curvature which is suitable for use in the instrument.\nSection 6 contains a brief consideration of module and in-\nstrument design, followed in Sect. 7 by a discussion of the\nresults from the current programme and prospects for future\ninstrument development. The next stages of our WFAI de-\nvelopment programme are summarised in Sect. 8.\n2 Instrument requirements\n2.1 Science requirements\nThe instrument design drivers are given in Table 1. Optical\ndesign and spacecraft orbital parameters should combine to\nmake possible the instantaneous viewing of most of the auro-\nral oval, while spatial resolution must be sufficient to resolve\nstructure on scales better than 25 km, providing adequate cor-\nrelation with ionospheric flow measurements. Bright auro-\nral features can exhibit horizontal velocities of up to several\nkm s\u22121; temporal resolution is therefore also an important\nfactor. Conventional detectors, such as the intensified CCDs\nof the VIS instrument on Polar (Frank et al., 1995) are inte-\ngrating devices, and thus provide no information about pho-\nton arrival time within a given frame time. In such a detector,\nthe maximum integration time before blurring occurs is given\nby the ratio of instrument spatial resolution to spacecraft ve-\nlocity, which, in polar LEO, is \u223c7.5 km s\u22121. For a resolution\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/\nN. P. Bannister et al.: WFAI for low Earth orbit missions 521\nTable 1. Performance requirements of a wide field FUV auroral imager in polar LEO.\nParameter Requirement\nSpatial resolution Less than 25 km\u00d725 km footprint\nField of view for complete coverage From 800 km LEO: 130\u25e6\u00d7130\u25e6\nFrom 1RE altitude (6378 km): 42\u25e6\u00d742\u25e6\nTemporal resolution Better than 3 s\nBandpass 140\u2013180 nm band which contains the molecular N2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH)\nemissions (140\u2013160 nm for the LBH short, and 160\u2013180 nm for LBH long ranges)\nCount rate <2.3 MHz for 1 kR feature (see Sect. 3.2)\nof 25 km, the maximum integration time is therefore\u223c3 s. In\ncontrast, with the photon counting MCP detector described in\nSect. 4 the arrival times of individual photons can be recorded\nwith a precision which is better than 1 ms (e.g. Siegmund et\nal., 1997). Since the velocity vector of the spacecraft is well\nknown, the instantaneous arrival position of the photon in\nthe moving imager frame can be mapped back onto the Earth\nframe with an uncertainty given by the spacecraft velocity\nVsc multiplied by the instrument time resolution, \u03c4 , which\nin this case is less than 7.5 m. The effective limit on obser-\nvation time for a stationary auroral feature is determined by\nhow long that feature stays in the field of view of the imager.\nThe required angular resolution (1\u03b8) is determined from\nthe minimum cell length (L) on the Earth\u2019s surface for a\ngiven separation between spacecraft and object, h:\nL = h tan (1\u03b8) . (1)\nThe distance along a line of sight to the aurora (h) increases\nwith the angle between the nadir and that line of sight. We\ncan place limits on the angular resolution required by con-\nsidering the extreme case of imaging the entire auroral oval\nfrom a position above the pole. This requires a FOV of 136\u25e6\nand an angular resolution of 0.47\u25e6 for a cell of 25 km from\nan altitude of 800 km, assuming the auroral emission occurs\nat 110 km altitude above the surface of the Earth. To image\na 25 km auroral cell at nadir, the angular resolution required\nis 2.08\u25e6. As we discuss below, these performance specifica-\ntions are achievable with MCP optics.\n2.2 Bandpass filters\nThe primary goal of the WFAI is to provide high spatial and\ntemporal resolution imaging in a global context (i.e. images\nof the entire auroral oval) at perigee in LEO. Although high\nspectral resolution is unnecessary to meet these goals, the\naddition of energy resolution increases the science which can\nbe performed with the instrument. Since MCP detectors have\nnegligible intrinsic energy resolution, adding this capability\nrequires the introduction of filters to define specific band-\npasses.\nIt has been shown with previous imagers that the ability\nto determine the ratio of one wavelength band to another (for\ninstance between the \u201clong\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d bands of the Lyman-\nBirge-Hopfield (LBH) N2 lines) can provide information on\nthe depth of penetration of the particles giving rise to the au-\nrora (e.g. Torr et al., 1995). This in turn provides an estimate\nof the energy spectrum of the particles, allowing the parti-\ncle source region to be identified. To date, the most effective\nFUV filters for auroral imaging (in terms of their ability to\nprovide narrow bandwidth and effective out-of-band block-\ning) are those produced for the FUV imager on board the\nPolar Mission. These sophisticated filters, described by Zu-\nkic et al. (1993), allow the isolation of specific wavebands of\ninterest. Narrowband filters designed for observation of OI\nlines have a bandwidth of <5 nm, and a peak transmittance\nof 23.9% and 38.3% for filters with central wavelengths of\n130.4 and 135.0 nm, respectively, allowing quantitative mea-\nsurements of the 130.4 and 135.6 nm lines of OI. Broadband\nfilters for the FUV imager allow quantitative measurements\nof the LBH-s (140\u2013160 nm) and LBH-l (160\u2013180 nm) bands:\none filter provides a bandpass centred at 150 nm with a band-\nwidth of 10 nm, serving the LBH-s region; the other, with a\ncentral wavelength of 170 nm and a bandwidth of 11 nm, is\nwell matched to the LBH-l region. These highly selective\nfilters allow the measurement of precipitating particle en-\nergies and interaction altitudes. A well-established method\nof determining these parameters involves the comparison of\ntwo emission lines, one of which is absorbed by the oxy-\ngen Schumann-Runge absorption continuum, as a function\nof altitude (e.g. Germany et al., 1998). For example, more\nenergetic electrons penetrate deeper into the atmosphere be-\nfore producing aurorae; photons emitted in the LBH-s are\nabsorbed by O in the atmosphere, while photons in the LBH-\nl band are not. Hence the strength of the LBH-l emission can\nbe used to indicate the power input to the system, while the\nratio of the LBH-s to the LBH-l emission provides informa-\ntion on the altitude and energy of the auroral activity.\nAlthough filters for the Polar-FUV imager are ideally\nmatched to the diagnostic methods described above, they\nare reflection devices (multi-layer 5-stacks), used at a 45\u25e6\nangle of incidence, in order to produce these highly spe-\ncific wavebands. Reflection filters are incompatible with the\nvery compact WFAI design, and are unsuitable for wide-field\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007\n522 N. P.

Filters for the WFAI must\nbe used in transmission, and must be compatible with the\nwide field and large focal plane of the imaging device. Zu-\nkic et al. (1993) review the development of filters for FUV\napplications, and find that previous designs used in transmis-\nsion resulted in low throughput, and provided wavebands too\nlarge for the selectivity required to perform the diagnostics\ndescribed above. In addition, some filters (e.g. those based on\nthe Fabry-Pe\u00b4rot design) suffer from pass windows at longer\nwavelengths. This is particularly undesirable in the context\nof the WFAI, where global imaging of auroral emission re-\nquires observations in both the night-time and daylit hemi-\nspheres; in the latter case, long wavelength leakage will ad-\nmit significant quantities of visible photons which will mask\nthe FUV emission.\nThe lack of narrow bandwidth transmission filters with\ncomprehensive out-of-band blocking characteristics pre-\ncludes certain studies, such as measurement of precipitating\nparticle energies and interaction altitudes described above.\nHowever, transmission devices are available which provide\nuseful wavelength selectivity and which have a proven space\nheritage. Frank et al. (1981) describe filters used on the\nDynamics Explorer Mission. These devices comprise both\nnarrow-band interference filters and BaF2, CaF2 and MgF2\nwindows. Aluminium flashing is applied to the windows to\nsuppress long wavelength transmission, allowing auroral ob-\nservations in the sunlit ionosphere. Table 2 includes specifi-\ncations for three DE-1 filters which are of particular interest\nin the context of the WFAI instrument, along with count rate\nestimates for each filter in the WFAI context (these estimates\nare discussed in Sect. 3.2). The design of these filters appears\nto be compatible with the requirements of the WFAI in that\nthey are used in transmission, and can be produced in formats\nwhich are large enough to cover the WFAI focal plane.\nThe filters cover the LBH band, and are sufficiently\nopaque to Lyman \u03b1 wavelengths so that, when combined\nwith a window material such as CaF2, auroral emissions in\nthe LBH band can be imaged in both the dark and sunlit iono-\nspheres. By restricting the WFAI to a single, broad band-\npass covering the LBH emissions, the ability to measure the\nprecipitating electron energies and distributions from direct\nmeasurements of the long- and short- LBH measurements is\nlost. However, quantitative measurements of electron impact\nexcitation of N2 in dark and sunlit ionospheres becomes pos-\nsible, and missions such as DE-1 and IMAGE have shown\nthat such broadband measurements can produce valuable sci-\nence (see e.g. Rairden et al., 1986; Frey et al., 2003).\n3 Microchannel plate optics\n3.1 Overview\nTo determine whether the proposed instrument can meet the\nscientific goals, we consider previous MCP optic results from\nLeicester and elsewhere, and the auroral imager performance\nwhich could be obtained with these MCPs. We describe the\nresults of Monte Carlo ray trace simulations used to specify\nthe MCP geometry (radius of curvature, channel width etc)\nfor optimum FUV imaging in terms of effective area and an-\ngular resolution. We then estimate the sensitivity and maxi-\nmum count rate expected from an MCP-based auroral imager\nin LEO.\nAn MCP optic consists of a spherically curved glass plate\ncontaining a very large number of channels of square cross\nsection, mutually aligned with good regularity. The plate cur-\nvature is not introduced by grinding methods (as employed\nfor conventional telescope mirrors and lenses) but is pro-\nduced by bending or \u201cslumping\u201d the initially planar MCP\nonto a polished metal mandrel. This produces a different\nchannel geometry to grinding: in the ground MCP, the pore\naxes are parallel, while in the slumped MCP the long axes of\nall the channels intersect at a distance RMCP (the MCP radius\nof curvature) along the optical axis. A metallic layer (e.g. Ni)\nis deposited on the channel walls to enhance the reflectivity\nof the optic at X-ray energies. Recent studies have investi-\ngated alternative coating materials (e.g. Ir, Ru, Pt) (Nussey,\n2005), and work on identifying the optimum coating for use\nin a wide field auroral imager (WFAI) such as that described\nhere is ongoing.\nParallel beams of radiation are focused to a point by or-\nthogonal reflections from the walls of the channels. The fo-\ncal length of an MCP optic is f =RMCP\/2 (for a source at\ninfinity) and the point spread function (PSF) is cruciform in\nnature (Fraser et al., 1993a), consisting of a central focus pro-\nduced by odd numbers of reflections off orthogonal faces, ac-\ncompanied by intersecting line foci which arise from single\nreflections. MCP optics have no \u201cpreferred axis\u201d, permit-\nting much larger fields of view than those possible with con-\nventional optical designs. MCP optics are the key technol-\nogy for the Lobster imaging all-sky X-ray telescope (Fraser\net al., 2002); here, they allow us to realise a compact, low\nmass instrument which meets the requirements of Table 1.

The best angular reso-\nlution demonstrated in previous X-ray work (7\u2032 full width at\nhalf maximum, or FWHM) is a factor of four better than the\nvalue required to provide a match to radar data, from LEO\n(see Sect. 2).\nThe bandpass over which a given MCP optic can focus\nis determined by its aspect ratio (channel length L divided\nby channel width, D). Fraser et al. (1993a) describe the\nfocusing of parallel beams of 0.1\u20132 keV X-rays, while re-\nsults for hard X-ray focusing (50\u201365 keV) are presented by\nPrice et al. (2002). The present paper is concerned with\nthe performance of MCP optics in the FUV waveband de-\nfined by the bandpass filters discussed above. Since angu-\nlar resolution 1\u03b8 is an important consideration, the MCP\nchannel size D must be chosen such that diffraction effects,\nwhich scale as \u03bb\/D, are negligible. For the D=84\u00b5m chan-\nnels of the prototype optic (Sect. 4), the diffraction contri-\nbution is only 4.9 arcsec FWHM at 121.6 nm, which is in-\nsignificant compared to (a) the intrinsic geometrical reso-\nlution D\/f =5.8 arcminutes, and (b) the target resolution of\n2.08\u25e6 for 25 km cells at nadir from 800 km altitude.\n3.2 WFAI optic design and detector requirements\nA Monte-Carlo ray tracing model (Brunton et al., 1997) has\nbeen used to establish the optimal design parameters in terms\nof maximising optic effective area. In the model, a square-\npore MCP optic with slump radius RMCP=100 mm focuses\nlight onto a spherically slumped MCP detector of the same\nradius. Although the ideal detector radius of curvature is\nhalf that of the optic, slumping a microchannel plate electron\nmultiplier to only 50 mm radius is likely to present significant\nmanufacturing difficulty. Adopting the larger radius of cur-\nvature will increase the FWHM of the point spread function\nby approximately 20% at the extreme edge of the field. The\nresults of this modelling are presented in Table 4. In this sec-\ntion we estimate the detector requirements of an instrument\nbased on this ideal MCP optic, beginning with an estimation\nTable 4.

The count rate generated in\nthe instrument is dependent on the electron barrier, bandpass\nfilter (these two roles being combined into a single element),\nand any QE-enhancing detector photocathode, as well as the\noptic itself. Filters and any photocathodes should be chosen\nsuch that the detected count rate does not exceed the count\nrate capacity of the detector when imaging a typical bright\naurora.\nThe maximum achievable count rate in an MCP detector\nis limited by the charge replenishment time of the channels,\nwhich is related to the ratio of MCP output pulse current Ip\nto strip current Is (i.e. the MCP conductance current flowing\nin the high resistivity surface conducting glass of the MCP\nstructure). These quantities can be expressed as\nIp = G\u00afN, (2)\nand\nIs = V0\nRch\n, (3)\nwhere G\u00af is the average charge gain of the detector, N is the\ncount rate per channel, V0 is the bias voltage of the MCP\nand Rch is the effective resistance of a single microchannel\n(Fraser et al., 1991). Fraser et al. (1993b) model the op-\neration of MCP detectors at high count rates, and provide\ndata for the variation in limiting pulse current to strip cur-\nrent ratio (Fig. 1 in that work), as a function of the num-\nber of channels illuminated, for MCP detectors with chan-\nnel sizes similar to those proposed for the WFAI. In the case\nof the MCP detector discussed here, the 12.5\u00b5m diameter\nchannels are arranged in a hexagonal close pack structure\nwith a pitch of 15\u00b5m, and thus the channel number den-\nsity is approximately 5.1\u00d7109 m\u22122. The illuminated area of\nthe detector has a diameter of 40 mm, so that there are ap-\nproximately 6.4\u00d7106 illuminated channels. From Fig. 1 of\nFraser et al.

(4)\nWe now make some conservative assumptions for the perfor-\nmance of the MCP to be used in the WFAI detector, adopting\nV0=1500 V, G\u00af=1 pC andRmcp=40 M. Treating the MCP as\n6.4\u00d7106 resistors in parallel, the resistance of an individual\nchannel is Rch=2.6\u00d71014 . Then from Eq. (4), the limiting\ncount rate per channel is N=0.6 cts s\u22121. Hence, for full field\nillumination we find a maximum count rate of approximately\n4\u00d7106 counts s\u22121 can be sustained by the multiplier.\nAuroral intensity (expressed in Rayleighs, where 1\nRayleigh corresponds to 106 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122, emitting\ninto 4pi sr), is conventionally quoted as the intensity of the\nstrongest emission line within the spectrum (the 130.5 nm OI\nline). However, in the case of the WFAI, it is the integrated\nntensity ov r the range of wav lengths d fined by the band-\npass filter, which is of interest. Torr et al. (1995) provide data\non the spectrum of the aurora (Fig. 2.4.1b and Table 2.6.1 in\nthat work), and find that in the 140\u2013170 nm band, the inte-\ngrated intensity of the aurora is typically between 600\u20131200\nRayleighs, with the dayglow emission being of a similar in-\ntensity; in addition, there are strong lines of OI at 130.4 and\n135.6 nm which fall within the bandpass of the filters con-\nsidered here. We have estimated typical count rates which\nwould be observed by an MCP optic-based auroral imager,\nassuming a total emission of 2400 Rayleighs in the observed\nwaveband (dayglow and aurora), plus contributions from the\nOI lines at the maximum level quoted by Torr et al.

The count rate R in a detector with quantum ef-\nficiency (QE) Q at the focus of an MCP optic with effective\narea A in cm2 is (based on Eq. (3), Torr et al., 1995),\nR = 10\n6\n4pi\nAtwtfQI, (5)\nwhere  is the solid angle subtended by the instrument field\nof view, tw, is the transmission of the window (used to seal\nthe detector against electrons \u2013 see Sect. 6.2), tf , the trans-\nmission of the bandpass filter, and the brightness of the emis-\nsion integrated over the wavelength range of interest is I\nRayleighs.\nTo estimate R we adopt the wavelength-independent optic\neffective area of 1.64 cm2 determined from the Monte Carlo\nstudies of a mechanically perfect optic with L:D=10:1 (see\nTable 4). We consider the response of the instrument for\nthe three filters listed in Table 2, and in each case adopt the\nwavelength-dependent CaF2 window transmission shown in\nFig. 3. We have considered the response of the instrument\nbased on a detector with (a) bare glass MCPs, and (b) a con-\nfiguration in which the input face of the front MCP has a CsI\nphotocathode (KBr photocathodes suffer from a minimum in\nthe secondary electron yield at 170 nm and are therefore not\nconsidered). Simons et al. (1987) provide information on the\nQE of bare glass and CsI photocathode-equipped MCPs as\na function of wavelength in the FUV region, and we assume\nthese data here (efficiencies at these wavelengths are low \u2013\ne.g. at 160 nm, Qbare=0.05% and QCsI=4%). We find that\nif the source fills the entire field of view of a single mod-\nule of the design described in Sect. 6 (i.e. a module consist-\ning of 4 MCPs to generate a 45.8\u00d745.8\u25e6 (0.622 steradian)\nfield of view satisfying the requirements outlined in Table 1),\nthe resulting count rates range from Rglass=1.62\u00d7106 counts\ns\u22121 for the first filter listed in Table 2, to a maximum of\nRCsI=1.06\u00d7108 counts s\u22121 in the case of the second filter.\nThese rates are upper limits since the auroral intensity will\nnot be uniformly bright in the field of view. Count rates are\napproximately halved for observations of the night-side iono-\nsphere. The results are summarised in columns 4 and 5 of\nTable 2.\nDetecting changes n the size of the \u201cdim\u201d region inside\nthe auroral oval can give quantitative measurements of the\nmagnetic reconnection rates at the dayside and in the mag-\nnetotail. This diagnostic is discussed by Milan et al. (2003).\nFrom Fig. 2 in that work we assume a factor of 40 differ-\nence between the brightest and faintest auroral emission to\nbe imaged and hence the count rate for the dim region on the\nnight-side, assuming a bare glass MCP and the first filter in\nTable 2, isRglass=2\u00d7104 counts s\u22121. This compares to an in-\ntrinsic noise level of 0.1 counts cm\u22122 s\u22121 for a typical MCP\ndetector, i.e. <2 counts s\u22121 for the sensitive area considered\nhere.\nWhile the processing of such large signals is not consid-\nered in this paper, it is apparent that bare glass MCP elec-\ntron multipliers are capable of operation at the count rates\nAnn.

The MCP (shown in Fig. 4)\nwas produced for a study into slumping procedures, and is\nnot optimised for the current work. In particular, the L\/D\nvalue of 49:1 results in a lower effective area compared to\nthe ideal L\/D discussed in Sect. 3. The MCP prototype is\nspecified in Table 5.\nThe geometrical figure was characterised by two orthogo-\nnal scans of a Talysurf profilometer, and is shown in Fig. 5.\nTable 5. Prototype MCP parameters.\nParameter Value\nOuter diameter 46.0\u00b10.5 mm\nChannel size D 84\u00b12\u00b5m\nChannel length L 4.2\u00b10.1 mm\nChannel pitch P 103\u00b12\u00b5m\nRadius of curvature RMCP 64.6\u00b10.2 mm\nSaggital depth 4.5\u00b10.2 mm\nTheoretical open area fraction 0.66\u00b10.04\nCoating None\nThe MCP diameter was 46 mm, and each traverse was lim-\nited by the deflection of the profilometer stylus, beginning\nand ending within 6 mm of the plate edge and passing within\n\u00b10.5 mm of the centre. The best fit to the measured profile\nwas a sphere with a 64.6\u00b10.2 mm radius of curvature. Opti-\ncal microscopy revealed significant distortion in the channel\ncross section and packing structures over approximately 5%\nof the MCP area. Figure 6 shows one such area (the black\ndots in the image are produced by particulate material in the\nmicroscope optics).\nThe optic was tested using the intense Lyman alpha UV\nemission at 121.6 nm. Imaging tests were performed in the\n27 m long optic test facility at Leicester (Price et al., 2002).\nUV light was generated using a deuterium lamp with a MgF2\nwindow, producing an output continuum covering the range\n112\u2013400 nm. Selection of the Ly-\u03b1 line was achieved using\na concave grating monochromator. The optic was mounted\non a two-axis carriage located 20 m from the source, with\nits centre on the optical axis. The imaging detector (a\n93\u00d793 mm2 active area, two-stage MCP detector with pla-\nnar resistive anode readout) was initially placed 32.3 mm be-\nhind the optic, predicted to be the position of the optimum\nfocus as determined by the MCP lens equation (Brunton et\nal., 1995),\n1\nls\n\u2212 1\nli\n= 1\nf\n, (6)\nwhere ls is the distance from the source to the centre of the\noptic, andli is the distance from the optic centre to the im-\nage (note that for an object at infinity, f=RMCP\/2). Due to\nthe construction of the MCP support fixture, only the central\n40 mm diameter of the optic was illuminated, with the outer\nrim being masked by the clamping assembly. Non-linearities\nin the resistive anode images were corrected in software.\nImages generated with the Monte Carlo model were used\nto simulate the experimental results. Distortions in the chan-\nnel wall and packing structure were incorporated into the\nmodel by multiplying a perfect optic structure with a matrix\ncontaining a Gaussian distribution of deviations in channel\nalignment of 1.47\u25e6 and 1.70\u25e6 about the nominal channel bias\nin x- and y-axes, respectively.

Truncation of the \u201cwest\u201d and \u201csouth\u201d cross-arms\nin the laboratory image is caused by deformation within the\noptic, specifically a twisting of the channels which is par-\nticularly evident in one quadrant of the MCP. The channel\norientation in this section appears to be subject to random de-\nviations from nominal alignment, resulting in the deformed\ncross-arms.\nDespite differences between the quality of focus in the\nsimulated and experimental images, good agreement is found\nbetween the predicted and measured focal lengths. The opti-\nmum focal distance (defined by a minimum in the FWHM\nof the central point spread function) occurs at an optic-\ndetector separation of 38\u00b11.5 mm, compared to the theo-\nretical FWHM minimum position of 32.3 mm. The angular\nFWHM at best focus was measured to be 2.8\u25e6\u00b10.1\u25e6, where\nthe error is due to uncertainty in the detector-to-optic dis-\ntance.\nWith the optic-detector separation set to 37\u00b11 mm and\nthe optic tilted about a vertical axis, images were taken at\noff-axis angles \u03b1 covering the range \u00b111.16\u25e6 in 2.23\u25e6 steps\n(Fig. 8). Since the focused light was known to pass through\nan angle of 2\u03b1, the shift in position of the focal spot could\nbe calculated. Over the total change in angle of 22.3\u25e6, the\nfocus moved a distance of 32.3\u00b11.4 mm (compared with a\npredicted distance of 28.9\u00b11.7 mm). These images confirm\nthat the MCP optic focuses over a very wide FOV.\n5 Performance of a prototype imaging detector\n5.1 Detector design\nThe prototype detector consists of two 36 mm diameter\nMCPs with 12.5\u00b5m diameter pores, and a thickness of\n 33\n \n \n \nFig. 7.

The MCPs are mounted one above the other in a\n\u201cstack\u201d such that the output charge pulse from the front MCP\nacts as the input pulse for the rear plate. To approximate the\ncurved focal plane of an MCP optic, the plates in the detec-\ntor are spherically slumped by the manufacturer (Photonis,\nBrive, France) to a radius of curvature of 100 mm. Curved\nMCP detectors have a considerable space heritage. For ex-\nample, a detector with 70 mm convex radius of curvature\nwas used in the XUV telescopes for the ALEXIS satellite\n(Siegmund et al., 1990), and 165 mm concave MCPs were\nused for the ROSAT Wide Field Camera (Barstow and San-\nsom, 1990). However, the curved figures of these channel\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/\nN. P. Bannister et al.: WFAI for low Earth orbit missions 527\nplates were produced by grinding the surface figure prior to\nchannel etching. All the microchannels, therefore, were par-\nallel in the ALEXIS and ROSAT missions. The slumping\nmethod adopted here is novel for such a small radius of cur-\nvature, having been used previously only for devices with\nmuch larger RMCP values \u2013 826 mm in the case of the Cos-\nmic Origins Spectrograph for the Hubble Space Telescope\n(McPhate et al., 2000; Vallerga et al., 2002), and 875 mm for\nthe Far Ultraviolet Spectrographic Explorer (FUSE) detec-\ntors (Siegmund et al., 1997).\nIn the present detector, the charge output from the rear\nMCP is imaged by a planar 52 mm\u00d752 mm uniform resis-\ntive anode. The centre of curvature of the MCP lies behind\nthe readout plane; the MCP-anode spacing is 5.9 mm and\n3.6 mm at the MCP centre and edge respectively. The chan-\nnels in one of the MCPs have axes which are perpendicular\nto the MCP surface \u2013 referred to as a \u201c0\u25e6 bias angle\u201d plate.\nThe other MCP contains channels which are inclined at 13\u25e6\nwith respect to the surface normal.\nAlthough the MCP-anode distance varies because of the\nuse of a slumped MCP, the readout system records the po-\nsition of the centroid of each charge cloud, and in this re-\nspect the varying anode-MCP distance does not affect the\n\u201cfocus\u201d of the detector. The variation in MCP-anode spacing\naffects the electric field at the rear of the detector, introducing\nnonlinearities in the resulting image. However, these distor-\ntions can be corrected by first quantifying nonlinearities in\nthe image using a \u201cpinhole mask\u201d \u2013 a grid of small, regu-\nlarly spaced holes in a sheet of material placed over the front\nMCP. The difference between measured and known pinhole\nlocation in the unprocessed image can then be used to correct\nfor nonlinearities in the science frames, using processing in\nsoftware. As well as performing this linearisation, variations\nin detector gain, pulse height distribution and quantum effi-\nciency as a function of position were measured to identify\nthe influence of the pore bias geometry.\nThe detector used in this work has been used to verify\nthat the required detection efficiency and spatial resolution\ncan be achieved. However, it should be noted that more so-\nphisticated anode technology will be required for the WFAI\ninstrument to accommodate the high count rates expected,\nwhile minimising the power requirements. The science re-\nquirements of a WFAI translate to a detector performance of\n512\u00d7512 pixels at a global count rate of order \u223c106 count\/s.\nThe high count rate places several constraints on readout op-\neration. Firstly, it is desirable to lower the gain of the MCP to\nreduce the \u201cpore paralysis\u201d time, which is a significant count\nrate limiting factor caused by the finite time taken to replen-\nish electrons ejected into the channel during the avalanche\nprocess. The signal to noise ratio is reduced not only by\nthe lower MCP gain, but by the shorter signal deadtime and\nfaster shaping time required at these higher count rates. Sec-\nondly, the larger signal currents due to higher count rates can\ncause increased image instability in some traditional read-\nouts such as the wedge and strip anode, an effect caused by\n 34\n \nFig. 8.

These de-\nvices utilize orthogonal strip electrodes with centroiding to\nachieve high spatial resolution, and high speed ASIC-based\nmultichannel electronics to provide the improved signal to\nnoise ratio necessary for operation at lower MCP gain. They\nare also designed to operate in the Image Charge mode, a\ntechnique in which signals are capacitively coupled to the\nelectrodes, resulting in zero net DC signal current, eliminat-\ning DC offset voltages and providing excellent image stabil-\nity.\n5.2 Results\nThe detector was tested in two orientations, with the 13\u25e6 bias\nMCP at the input, 0\u25e6 bias MCP at the output in both instances\nto eliminate the effects of any intrinsic performance variation\nbetween the two MCPs. In the first instance the detector was\ntilted at 13\u25e6 with respect to the source direction, followed by\nan identical test at 0\u25e6 tilt. Figure 9 shows the uniformity of\ngain (the amount of charge produced at the readout by an in-\ncident photon) in both orientations. In the first case (13\u25e6 tilt)\nthe pore axes at the centre of the MCP were parallel to the\nsource direction, thus approximating the geometry of a 0\u25e6\nbias front MCP. Figure 9 (left) shows that the gain at the cen-\ntre of the image was lower than in the surrounding area, since\nphotons arriving close to the centre of the detector interact at\ngreater depth in the pores due to their small grazing angles.\nThe mean MCP gain over the whole image is 4.06\u00b10.4 pico-\nCoulombs (pC) in this configuration. Figure 9 (right) shows\nthe same detector at 0\u25e6 tilt, such that the channel axes made\nan angle of 13\u25e6 with respect to the source direction. In this\ncase, the mean gain is at 4.20\u00b10.2 pC, and the uniformity of\ngain over the active area is improved. These results show that\na detector for the WFAI should be fitted with a non-zero bias\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007\n528 N. P.

Analysis of this data indicates\na resolution of \u223c31\u00b5m after deconvolution of the pinhole\nsize and linearization of image distortions. When coupled to\nthe optics specified in Table 4, this figure would correspond\nto a resolution of better than 0.5 km for nadir-directed obser-\nvations of the aurora from 800 km LEO. It is therefore evi-\ndent that the detector design described here is well matched\nto the optical design in terms of dynamic range, absolute sen-\nsitivity and image resolution, although as noted above, an\nalternative MCP geometry and readout technology would be\nchosen for a flight instrument to accommodate the high count\nrate requirements of the mission.\n6 Module design\n6.1 Optical arrangement\nA single MCP optic of the type specified in Table 4 for the\nWFAI has a core FOV of 22.9\u25e6. Increasing the size of indi-\nvidual MCPs is not a feasible method of increasing the FOV,\nsince a single large MCP optic cannot be slumped without in-\ntroducing significant channel distortions. However, a wider\nFOV can be built up by tiling four MCPs in a 2\u00d72 arrange-\nment to approximate a spherically figured surface of the re-\nquired size.\nIn the WFAI design proposed here, each module consists\nof a spherically figured surface made up of four smaller MCP\noptics, a bandpass filter, an electron barrier window, and a\nsingle slumped MCP detector. This arrangement, shown in\nFig. 2, increases the FOV to 45.8\u25e6, and it is this configura-\nTable 6. Maximum imaging time per feature as a result for three\nmodular configurations.

Note that each module in such arrangements\nwill carry an MCP detector, so that the expected count rates\nfrom each detector will remain within the limits discussed\nin Sect. 3. Although \u201csquare\u201d arrangements (e.g. 2\u00d72 or\n3\u00d73 modules) provide a larger instantaneous field of view\nfor three-axis stabilised platforms, a 1\u00d73 module instrument\ncould be used to reduce mass, cost and complexity (Fig. 10)\nfor operation on a scanning platform. The two alternative\npointing schemes for this WFAI spacecraft are illustrated in\nFig. 11.\nTable 6 also summarises the length of time that various\nWFAI configurations view a point in the auroral zone, assum-\ning that the spacecraft vector is directed through the centre of\na 5374 km diameter auroral oval, with the instrument fixed\npointing to nadir such that it scans across the oval (the ver-\ntical distance from the aurora to the spacecraft was assumed\nto be 690 km). While a single module with a 45.8\u25e6 FOV can\nobserve a particular position for 100 s per orbit, significantly\nlonger observations are possible by adding further modules\nto synthesise a wider field of view. With observation periods\nof several hundred seconds per orbit possible at time reso-\nlutions ranging from 3 s to tenths of seconds or better, the\nWFAI design will permit detailed studies of the dynamics of\nthe aurora at very small spatial scales.\n6.2 Electron shielding\nA nadir-pointing auroral imager has to contend with a large\nupward-moving electron flux which must be effectively sup-\npressed to minimise imager background. There are three in-\nbuilt electron attenuation mechanisms in the WFAI design:\n(a) the low transmission of the MCP optics to a particle flux;\n(b) the conventional operation of the MCP detector with a\nhigh negative input potential (\u223c\u22124 kV) which renders the de-\ntector insensitive to electrons with energies below 4 keV, and\n(c) the stopping power of the CaF2 filter substrate which acts\nas a barrier to electrons and the intense Lyman-\u03b1 (121.6 nm)\nemission. Rees (1989) provides data for upward-moving\nelectron intensities as a function of altitude (Fig. 3.2.4 in that\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/\nN. P.

The\nextrapolated range R (mg cm\u22122) of an electron of energy E\n(MeV) in a solid is independent of atomic number and given\nby\nR = 412E1.265\u22120.0954 lnE(0.01 < E < 3), (7)\n(Zombeck, 1989). The density of CaF2 is 3.19 g cm\u22123. We\nobtain a range of only 2.13\u00b5m for 20 keV electrons, and\n42\u00b5m for 100 keV electrons. These ranges should be com-\npared with a likely CaF2 filter substrate thickness of at least\n0.5 mm (as assumed in the sensitivity calculations above).\nThus, total attenuation of the upward moving electron flux\nis achieved by the CaF2 alone. There is no requirement for\neither a magnetic or electrostatic particle diverter. Careful\ndesign of the detector housing will be required to ensure that\nthere is no leak path for electrons around the filter, and to pre-\nvent the admission of photons generated by electron impact\nalong the instrument optical path. In the latter case, the de-\nsign of the optics (with channels 1 mm in length) minimises\nthe surface area over which electrons can interact, and thus\nminimises the electron-generated photon flux.\n6.3 Detector resource requirements\nThe power requirements of lower specification MCP detec-\ntors based on existing charge division readout technologies\nwith flight qualified components, are typically 6.5 W (Lap-\nington et al., 2003), representing the total power consump-\ntion of the detector system including the MCP high volt-\nage supply, signal preamplifiers, shaping amplifiers, ADCs,\nFPGA-based digital processing and digital interfacing to the\nspacecraft bus. Power requirements for the generic technol-\nogy discussed in Sect. 5.1, with its miniaturized, low power\nASIC front-end electronics and integrated digital processing\non FPGA, is expected to be similar.

As a consequence of its compact\nlow mass design, the WFAI is expected to be compatible with\na wide range of future mission opportunities.\nDue to the high intrinsic brightness of the auroral emission\nand the high resolution of the image, the data rate is likely to\nbe high (approximately 80 Mbit s\u22121, including 10 bit digiti-\nsation each for X and Y positions, 6 bits for charge, and 8 bit\nfor time encoding). On-board data compression schemes will\ntherefore be an important element of the instrument design,\nand will be the subject of a future study.\n7 Discussion\nDespite obvious imperfections in the prototype which lead\nto distortions in the cross arms and a broadening of the fo-\ncal spot, the FWHM of the true focus is 2.8\u25e6\u00b10.1\u25e6, corre-\nsponding to a 39\u00d739 km (\u00b16.4 km) footprint from an 800 km\norbit. This figure places a lower limit on the performance\npossible from an MCP optic based imager, since the proto-\ntype optic was manufactured purely to illustrate the feasibil-\nity of slumping MCP optics to radii of only a few cm.

We have recently received a batch of MCP optics\nproduced for the WFAI development programme using the\nupgraded manufacturing facilities at Photonis. Early results\nsuggest significant improvements in performance. Optical\nmicroscopy shows that the channel regularity in these MCPs\nis much improved compared to the prototype (see Fig. 12).\nX-ray point-to-point focusing with a flat MCP from the new\nbatch indicates that the line foci have a FWHM of 5.0\u00b10.3\narcminutes, corresponding to a resolution of 1 km for auroral\nemission imaged at nadir from an altitude of 800 km. Al-\nthough errors in the figure introduced during the slumping\nprocess can be expected to degrade the FWHM value, the\ngoal of 25\u00d725 km spatial resolution from 800 km is clearly\nachievable. We have also shown that slumped MCP, planar\nreadout detector technology is capable of satisfying the sen-\nsitivity, dynamic range, focal plane curvature and spatial res-\nolution requirements of the WFAI instrument.\nThis paper has been concerned with the performance of an\nauroral imager in polar LEO. Other mission concepts make\nuse of highly elliptical orbits, with apogee in excess of 6RE ,\nfrom which the Earth\u2019s auroral oval subtends an angle of 3\u25e6.\nIt is interesting to consider the potential of MCP optics at\nsuch altitudes, in the context of terrestrial missions and in-\nstruments deployed to Jupiter or Saturn, where high altitudes\nare required to image the extent of the auroral zones. The\nspatial resolution of our prototype optic corresponds to a cell\nsize of 1670 km at 6RE \u2013 clearly insufficient to provide use-\nful data for the studies outlined above. However, as we have\nnoted, this prototype is not representative of the \u201cstate of the\nart\u201d in MCP optic production. For the MCP defined in Ta-\nble 4, the resolution limit is 0.1\u25e6, corresponding to a cell size\nof 67 km at 6RE , and the 5 arcminute resolution of the new\nflat MCP discussed briefly above corresponds to a cell size of\napproximately 56 km at the same distance. Further improve-\nments are possible, since the theoretical limit to the spatial\nresolution of an MCP optic is determined by the angle sub-\ntended by a channel as viewed from the focal plane, or D\/f ,\nwhere f is the focal length of the optic. By reducing the pore\nsize to 35\u00b5m, cell sizes of 27 km may be resolved from the\nsame altitude. As noted in Table 3, MCP optics with channel\ndiameters significantly smaller than this have been demon-\nstrated in laboratory tests, so that high resolution imaging\nfrom considerable altitudes becomes possible with this tech-\nnology. This optical performance, combined with the com-\npact size and low mass of the instrument, provides, for the\nfirst time, the capability to perform high resolution wide field\nauroral imaging in both low and high altitude Earth orbits,\nand opens the way to practical, compact instruments which\ncan be deployed on deep space missions to the outer planets.\n8 Future work\nIn separate experiments, we have demonstrated the focusing\nof parallel beams of FUV radiation with a spatial resolution\nthat satisfies the requirements of high resolution, wide field\nimaging in Low Earth Orbit (summarised in Table 1), and we\nhave shown that an MCP detector can meet the goals of the\nWFAI concept in terms of dynamic range, absolute sensitiv-\nity and image resolution. We identify three key goals for the\nnext phase of our development programme:\n1. End-to-end testing of an MCP optic and WFAI-type de-\ntector. In the current work, data for FUV focusing were\nobtained using a standard laboratory detector. In the\nnext phase of this work, an MCP optic will be coupled\nwith the WFAI-type detector described in Sect. 5 to ver-\nify the results of our current work, showing that the end-\nto-end performance of the instrument meets the goals of\nthe WFAI concept.\n2. Practical demonstration of MCP optic alignment. To\ngenerate the required field of view, a WFAI instrument\nwill comprise four MCP optics tiled to form a single\nspherical surface as described in Sect. 6. These optical\nelements must be precisely aligned to ensure that the\nspatial resolution of the assembly preserves that of the\nindividual elements (i.e. that the assembly performs as\na larger, single MCP optic).\n3. Demonstration of wide-band filter performance. The\nconstruction and performance (transmission, out-of-\nband blocking and response for wide angles of accep-\ntance) of DE-1 type bandpass filters discussed in Sect. 2\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 519\u2013532, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/519\/2007\/\nN. P. Bannister et al.: WFAI for low Earth orbit missions 531\nwill be verified by introducing appropriate filter ele-\nments into the end-to-end demonstrator produced for\ntask (1).\nThese tasks require the modification of our MCP detector and\nMCP optic laboratory facilities. This upgrading is currently\nin progress, and the results of the work packages summarised\nabove will be presented in a future paper.\n9 Summary\nMicrochannel plate optics offer a practical method for meet-\ning the wide field of view and high spatial resolution re-\nquirements of future auroral imaging missions from LEO in\na highly compact, low mass package. We have demonstrated\nthe focussing of a parallel beam of Lyman-alpha UV light\nby a prototype MCP optic, and a preliminary design for a\nmodular auroral imager based on this technology has been\npresented. The design of the instrument can be tailored to\nthe nature of the spacecraft stabilisation method. In the case\nof a 3-axis stabilised platform, a number of modules are re-\nquired to synthesise the entire field of view instantaneously.\nIn the case of a spin-stabilised platform, a 1\u00d73 module de-\nsign can be used in combination with the scanning motion of\nthe platform to achieve the required field.\nAn auroral imaging instrument based on this design is cur-\nrently under consideration for the Chinese KuaFu-B space-\ncraft (Donovan et al., 20071; Tu et al., 2007).\nAcknowledgements.
