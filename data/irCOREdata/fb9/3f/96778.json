Introduction. Cancer is believed to be responsible for one of every five deaths\nin Western countries and therefore is among the major killers in the developed world.\nThe set of diseases categorized under this heading are characterized by major dis-\nruptions in the control mechanisms regulating growth and homeostasis in normal\ntissue [6]. In spite of the huge amount of resources that have been devoted to can-\ncer research, many aspects remain obscure for experimentalists and clinicians, and\nmany of the currently used therapeutic strategies are not entirely effective. The more\nsystematic approach of mathematical modeling, used as a guide to biologists and\nclinicians, might help to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of cancer progression\nand either to improve the therapeutic techniques currently used or to stimulate the\ndevelopment of new strategies.\nIn fact, modeling cancer has become one of the most active areas within the\nmathematical and theoretical biology communities. Many models have been pro-\nposed focusing on different aspects. Broadly speaking, we can divide these into two\napproaches: continuum models, mathematically formulated in terms of partial differ-\nential equations (PDEs), and cellular automaton (CA) models.\nTypically, tumor growth is divided into three stages: avascular growth, angio-\ngenesis, and vascular growth. In the earliest stage, the avascular stage, the tumor\ndevelops in the absence of blood supply (hence the name). In this first stage typically\nthe tumor grows up to a maximum size, since its growth is limited by the amount of\nnutrients the tumor can obtain through its surface [22]. In the second stage, some of\nthe cells of this avascular tumor mass produce and release substances called tumor\nangiogenic factors (TAFs). TAF diffuses through the surrounding tissue, and, upon\n\u2217Received by the editors February 3, 2004; accepted for publication (in revised form) June 17,\n2004; published electronically February 9, 2005.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/mms\/3-2\/60376.html\n\u2020Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Computer Science, University College London, Gower Street,\nLondon WC1E 6BT, UK (t.alarcon@cs.ucl.ac.uk).

Once vascularization is completed,\nthe tumor enters the vascular stage. In this stage, the tumor has access to virtually\nunlimited resources, so it can grow beyond its limited \u201cavascular\u201d size, and, also,\nit acquires a means of transport for cells that intravasate into the vasculature and\nform metastases in any part of the host organism. Thus, whereas in the avascular\nphase tumors are basically harmless, once they become vascular they are potentially\nfatal.\nAmong the continuum models, Greenspan proposed some of the earliest mathe-\nmatical models of tumor growth [33, 34]. His models of avascular tumor growth were\nformulated as moving boundary problems, in which the solid tumor grows in sus-\npension. The models do not allow for cellular heterogeneity within the tumor mass,\nand the treatment of the mechanical properties of the tissue is rather simplistic. For\nextensions of Greenspan\u2019s moving boundary formulation see [1, 2, 12, 47].\nSignificant progress was made with the introduction of multiphase models. These\nmodels extend the moving boundary approach to incorporate cellular heterogeneity\nand the use of more complex mechanical laws to describe the response of the tis-\nsue to external forces. Multiphase models have now been used to model avascular\ngrowth [13, 54, 71, 72], vascular growth [10], ductal carcinoma in situ [23], and tumor\nencapsulation [38].\nThe approaches described above draw upon methods from fluid and continuum\nmechanics. Models based on different approaches have been successful in describ-\ning other aspects of tumor growth. One approach involves using reaction-diffusion\ntheory as a modeling framework. Such models have been used to describe invasion\nand different aspects of tumor-induced angiogenesis [15, 45, 46, 51]. An alternative\napproach which has been used to model interactions between tumor growth and the\nimmune system is based on kinetic theory and Boltzmann-like equations [9]. For a\nmore extensive review of continuum modeling of tumor growth see [57].\nWhereas continuum models describe cell populations by means of continuous\nfields, cellular automata (CAs) deal with the dynamics of discrete elements.1 These\nelements take their state from a discrete (finite) space of states and evolve in discrete\nspace and time. The dynamics of the elements is given in terms of local rules (either\ndeterministic or probabilistic). Some of the models we describe below incorporate\nmodifications to the classical definition of a CA. In particular, some of them introduce\ndiffusive substances (such as nutrients or signaling cues) which are described by means\nof continuum fields. These models are categorized as hybrid CAs and are the basis for\nthe development of the multiple scale models we discuss in this paper. CA models have\nbeen proposed to describe four aspects of tumor growth, namely, avascular growth,\nvascular growth, invasion, and angiogenesis.\nThe model proposed in [20] is formulated as a two-dimensional hybrid CA (or,\nmore precisely, a lattice-gas model [63]) and reproduces many of the features of avas-\ncular tumors in vitro, as, for example, their layer structure.\nIn [52], a hybrid CA model of tumor growth in the presence of native vasculature\nis proposed2 to analyze the role of host vascular density and tumor metabolism on\ntumor growth. Tumor cells seem to use the glycolytic metabolism pathway rather\n1In the biological context these elements might be either individual cells or (small) clusters of\ncells.\n2Neither interaction between colony development and vasculature nor angiogenesis is taken into\naccount.\n442 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K. MAINI\nthan the aerobic metabolism, as normal cells do. One by-product of glycolisis is\nthe increase of acidity. Since tumor cells are more resistant to acidity than their\nnormal counterparts, it appears that cancer uses the glycolytic phenotype in order to\nincrease its invasiveness [29]. Several results regarding the interplay between vessel\ndensity, increased acidity, and tumor progression are obtained. Probably the most\nsignificant results are the presence of a sharp transition between states of initial tumor\nconfinement and efficient invasiveness when H+ production passes through a critical\nvalue. This has been observed in experiments [29].\nIn [68] malignant invasion using the extended Potts model [32] is studied. The\nauthors investigate how malignant cell phenotypes, in particular increased adhesion,\naffect cancer invasiveness. Their extended Potts model is based on the minimization\nof an energy function by a Monte Carlo method. The model can be simulated to in-\nvestigate how the maximum depth of invasion changes as different parameters relating\nto cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion and haptotaxis are varied.\nA CA model for angiogenesis based on endothelial cell migration in response to\ngradients of TAF (chemotaxis) and fibronectin3 (haptotaxis) is proposed in [7]. In this\nmodel vessel tip migration is modeled by a biased random walk derived from finite-\ndifference discretizations of macroscopic level PDEs. Additional rules are provided\nfor branching and anastomosis.4 The results can reproduce experimental observations\non solid tumor implants in the cornea of animals [7].\nFor more extensive reviews of CA modeling of biological systems in general and\ntumor growth in particular see [5] and [48], respectively.\nIn spite of all this effort, much work remains to be done in order to produce\nclinically relevant and predictive models. One obstacle that must be overcome is the\nintrinsic multiple scale nature of tumor growth. It involves processes occurring over a\nvariety of time and length scales: from the tissue scale (for example, vascular remod-\neling) to intracellular processes (for example, progression through the cell-cycle). The\nstructure of a solid, vascularized tumor is very dynamic and heterogeneous. Within\na solid tumor a given region may, at some point, become hypoxic. This situation\ntriggers biochemical pathways within the cancer cells involved in a number of intra-\ncellular responses to hypoxia (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion\nand release, transition to quiescence, etc.). VEGF release by starving cells triggers\nangiogenesis (i.e., recruitment of new vasculature from the existing one), which re-\nsults in the supply of oxygen to the hypoxic regions. Upon successful angiogenesis,\ncells do not lack oxygen anymore and emerge from quiescence into the proliferating\nstate. However, tumor vessels are less stable than their normal counterparts and when\ncoopted by the growing cancerous tissue they undergo a dematuration process. As a\nconsequence, these newly formed vessels collapse very easily, and the whole process\nstarts all over again. This is just an illustrative example of how processes occurring\nat very different time and length scales (TLSs) are coupled.\nMost of the models described so far, with the exception of those presented in\n[20] and [52], focus on one scale. While they may provide valuable insight into pro-\ncesses occurring at that scale, they do not address the fundamental problem of how\nphenomena at different scales are coupled. In this article, we aim to describe a frame-\nwork for formulating a multiple scale model of tumor growth capable of integrating a\nhierarchy of processes occurring at different scales.\n3Fibronectin is a molecule that enhances cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. It is a com-\nponent of the extracellular matrix and is also expressed by the endothelial cells.\n4Anastomosis is the formation of a loop by fusion of two capillaries.\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 443\nmolecular events\n(ion channel gating)\n10   m-3\nTissueProtein\n10   m-9\nAtom\n-1210      m 10   m-6\nCell\n10   s -3\ndiffusion\ncell signalling\n -610   s 10  s0 10   s 3\nmitosis\nFig. 1. TLSs involved in our model [36].\nOur aim in this work is to extend our previously developed modeling framework [3]\nto include phenomena occurring on a wide range of TLSs and the coupling between\nthem (see Figure 1).\nSimilar modeling approaches that integrate different TLSs have been proposed to\ndescribe other biological processes. For example, in physiology, integrative modeling\nof the heart is a particularly active area of research [55, 66, 37]. In developmental biol-\nogy, the formation of the skeletal pattern in the avian limb bud has been simulated by\nmeans of a scheme aimed to integrate cell-to-cell interactions, intracellular processes,\nand domain-level reaction-diffusion models of genetic regulation [16]. Physiologically\nstructured models to describe predator-prey systems under a distribution of nutrients\nhave been proposed [41]. In the particular area of tumor growth a model combin-\ning progression through the cell-cycle and cell migration has been recently proposed\nin [53].\nThis article is structured as follows. In section 2, we present a general descrip-\ntion of the model, focusing on its general structure and explaining how the different\nelements (corresponding to different TLSs) are coupled together. The next three\nsections are devoted to introducing the different elements we include in our model:\nthe blood flow, the dynamics for the vascular structural adaptation, and the oxygen\ntransport into the tissue (section 3), the competition between cancer and normal cells\n(section 4), and the dynamics of the intracellular processes (cell division, apoptosis,\nVEGF secretion) (section 5). Section 6 contains the rules of our lattice model and\nincorporates all the elements detailed in sections 3, 4, and 5. In section 7, we discuss\nthe growth and invasion patterns our model yields in different conditions and some\npredictions that may be of interest from the point of view of therapy. In section 8,\nwe give an account of the growth laws that our model predicts in different situations.\nFinally, in section 9, we summarize our results and discuss the limitations of the model\ntogether with future research directions.\n2. General structure of the model. The model we present in this article\nintegrates phenomena occurring on very different TLSs (see Figure 1). These features\ninclude blood flow and structural adaptation of the vascular network, transport into\nthe tissue of bloodborne oxygen, competition between cancer and normal cells, cell\ndivision, apoptosis, VEGF release, and the coupling between them. Its structure,\ntherefore, is quite complex. For this reason, before presenting the submodels we use\nto describe the different phenomena, we devote this section to explaining the overall\nstructure of the modeling framework.\nThe modeling framework we use is an extension of the hybrid cellular automaton,\n444 T.

Diagrammatic representation of the layer structure of our model.\nwhich has been used to model several aspects of tumor development (see [52, 20,\n3]). Here we extend this concept to account not only for the presence of a diffusive\nsubstance (such as oxygen or glucose) as in previous works but also for intracellular\nand tissue-scale phenomena and the coupling between them. To this end, we have\norganized our model in three layers: the vascular, the cellular, and the intracellular\nlayers, which correspond to the tissue, cellular, and intracellular TLSs, respectively\n(see Figure 2).\nIn the top layer, we deal with the structure of the vascular network and blood flow\n(see section 3 and [3] for more details). We consider a hexagonal vascular network\n(similar to the one observed in liver; see [44]). Each individual vessel is assumed to\nundergo structural adaptation (i.e., changes in radius) in response to different stimuli\nuntil the network reaches a stationary state. Through this structural adaptation\nprocess we compute the blood flow rate, the pressure drop, and the haematocrit (i.e.,\nrelative volume of red blood cells) in each vessel, thus providing the distribution of\nhaematocrit over the vascular network. Between the vascular layer and the cellular\nlayer, i.e., coupling the dynamics at the cellular level to blood flow and vascular\nadaptation, we have the transport of bloodborne oxygen into the tissue. This process\nis modeled by means of a reaction-diffusion equation. The distribution of haematocrit\nis the source of oxygen, whereas the distribution of cells (provided by the cellular\nlayer) gives us the (spatially distributed) sink of oxygen. We give a full account of\nthe modeling in the vascular layer in section 3.\nIn the intermediate layer, we focus on cell-cell interactions (competition) and spa-\ntial distribution of cells. We consider two types of cells: normal and cancer cells, which\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 445\nare modeled as individuals (see section 4 for more details). These two populations\ncompete for space and resources. Cancerous phenotypes are usually better competi-\ntors, which result in the cancer population taking over. One of the aims of this paper\nis to identify the key model parameters which may allow this situation to be reversed.\nIn section 7, we propose one such mechanism. Competition between the two types\nof cells is introduced by a very simple rule, which, in turn, couples this middle layer\nwith the intracellular layer. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is controlled by the\nexpression of p53 (whose dynamics is dealt with in the intracellular layer): when the\nlevel of p53 in a cell exceeds some threshold the cell undergoes apoptosis. However,\nthis threshold is fixed according to the local spatial distribution of cells, which links\nthe spatial distribution (cellular layer) with the apoptotic process (intracellular layer).\nMore details of all the rules involved in the cellular dynamics, in particular how these\nthresholds are fixed, are given in section 4.\nIn the bottom layer, we focus on intracellular processes, in particular cell division,\napoptosis, and VEGF secretion. In this layer, we use ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) to model the relevant biochemistry. One issue we focus on is how the external\nconditions modulate the dynamics of these intracellular phenomena and, in particu-\nlar, how the level of extracellular oxygen affects the division rate or the expression\nof p53 (which regulates apoptosis) and the production of VEGF. Since the spatial\ndistribution of oxygen depends on both the spatial distribution of cells (cellular layer)\nand on the distribution of haematocrit (vascular layer), these processes at the intra-\ncellular level are linked to the behavior of the other two layers: cell proliferation and\napoptosis alter the spatial distribution of the cells (see Figure 2); the cellular and the\nintracellular layers modulate the process of vascular structural adaptation through\nanother transport process: diffusion of VEGF into the tissue and its absorption by\nthe endothelial cells lining the vessels (see section 3). A full account of the ODE\nmodels used is given in section 5.\nFrom a more formal point of view, the introduction of the intracellular layer means\nthat our model actually fails to fall into the category of a CA model. The definition of\na CA implies a discrete-time description of the dynamics of the system [48], whereas\nthe inclusion of the ODE models for cell division and other intracellular processes\nyields a continuous-time description. So, rather than a CA model, our model might\nbe better categorized as a physiologically structured lattice model.\n3. Vascular structural adaptation and blood flow. In this section we give\ndetails of the elements we have included in our blood flow simulations. As in [3],\nwe take into account three major factors, namely, vascular structural adaptation,\ncomplex blood rheology, and the red blood cell distribution at bifurcations. However,\nhere we incorporate a new element: the coupling between the metabolic needs of the\ntissue and the vascular structural adaptation mechanism.\nFigure 3 shows a schematic representation of the vascular network we use for\nour simulations. We consider a vascular hexagonal network, similar to those usually\nfound, for example, in the liver [44]. Although the particular geometry of the vascu-\nlar network might have an effect on the pattern of growth predicted by our model, a\nthorough investigation of the effect of different vascular geometries on growth is be-\nyond the scope of this paper. We have chosen this particular geometry because it has\nbeen observed in real systems, and hence it enables us to show that even in a highly\nregular geometry, the complexities of blood flow and vascular dynamics may give rise\nto complex behavior. In Figure 3(a) we see that our hexagonal vascular network is\nsuperimposed on a rectangular grid, G \u2282 Z2. A point in this grid is denoted by the\n446 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K.

Diagrammatic representation of the layer structure of our vasculature network model.\npair (\u00b5, \u03bd); \u00b5, \u03bd \u2208 Z. On this grid we define the quantity N(\u00b5, \u03bd) by\nN(\u00b5, \u03bd) =\n{\n1 if (\u00b5, \u03bd) is a vertex of the vascular network,\n0 otherwise.\n(3.1)\nWe assume that the flow in each vessel may be characterized by Poiseuille\u2019s law\n[24]. Since Poiseuille\u2019s law implies that the pressure drop in each vessel is proportional\nto the flow rate, we can use Kirchoff\u2019s laws to compute the flow rate, Q\u02d9, the pressure\ndrop, \u2206P , the pressure, P , the wall shear stress, \u03c4w, and the haematocrit, H, in each\nvessel of our network [3].\nWe label each vessel using the numbering scheme shown in Figure 3(b). If, for\nexample, we want to refer to the radii of some of the vessels meeting at a point of G\nat time t, we use the notation Ri(\u00b5, \u03bd; t); i = 1, 2, 3. Of course, N(\u00b5, \u03bd) = 1 at such a\npoint. Similar notation is used for the other hydrodynamic quantities.\nThe initial condition for the vascular adaptation algorithm is a configuration in\nwhich all the vessels have the same radius R0 so that\nRi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t = 0) = R0 \u2200\u00b5, \u03bd, i.(3.2)\nThe remaining hydrodynamic quantities are initially set to zero. As shown in Figure\n3(a), a pressure drop \u2206PT = PH \u2212 PL is imposed between the two top corners of the\nnetwork. No flux conditions are imposed elsewhere on the boundary. \u2206PT is kept\nconstant throughout the simulation. Given this initial configuration, we use Kirchoff\u2019s\nlaws to calculate the hydrodynamic quantities in each vessel. This then provides us\nwith initial conditions for the structural adaptation algorithm [3].\nThe vascular system is continually influenced by the flow and the demands of\nthe surrounding tissue and remodels itself accordingly. Pries et al. formulated an\nadaptation mechanism which describes how the lumen radius, Ri(\u00b5, \u03bd; t), is modified\nby three such stimuli [60]. The first stimulus that they considered was mechanical.\nIn particular, Pries et al. proposed that vascular networks adapt themselves in order\nto maintain a fixed relationship between transmural pressure and wall shear stress\n(hydrodynamic stimulus) [59] (see (3.4)). Structural adaptation of vascular beds also\noccurs in response to the metabolic demands of the surrounding tissue. Consequently,\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 447\nif the flow in some vessels drops and the tissue becomes poorly supplied with oxygen or\nother metabolites, then the vasculature will be stimulated to grow. The third stimulus\nis the so-called shrinking tendency, which accounts for the tendency of the radii of\nthe vessels to decrease in the absence of growth factors that maintain or increase the\nsize of a given vessel.5 In [60] Pries et al. modeled the effect that these stimuli have\non the vessel radii by using the following equation:\nRi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t+\u2206t) = Ri(\u00b5, \u03bd; t) +Ri(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)\u2206t\n(\nlog\n(\n\u03c4wi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)\n\u03c4(Pi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t))\n)\n+ km(Vi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)) log\n(\nQ\u02d9ref\nQ\u02d9i(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)Hi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)\n+ 1\n)\n\u2212 ks\n)\n.(3.3)\nIn (3.3) \u2206t is the time step, Q\u02d9ref is the minimum flow rate required to maintain\ntissue homeostasis, and Km and ks are constants accounting for the intensity of the\nmetabolic stimulus and shrinking tendency, respectively [60]. For Poiseuille flow,\n\u03c4w = 4\u00b5Q\u02d9\/\u03c0R\n3. The first, second, and third terms on the right-hand side of (3.3)\ncorrespond to the hydrodynamic, metabolic, and shrinking tendency stimuli, respec-\ntively. \u03c4(Pi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)) is the wall shear stress-pressure relationship that the vascular\nsystem attempts to maintain. The expression for \u03c4(Pi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)) that we use was ob-\ntained in [60] by fitting to data from the rat mesentery and is given by\n\u03c4(Pi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)) = 100\u2212 86 [exp (\u22125000 log(logPi(\u00b5, \u03bd; t)))]5.4 .(3.4)\nWe have introduced a modification in the original formulation of the structural\nadaptation mechanism. In the third term on the right-hand side of (3.3) we have\nintroduced a function km(V ). In the original formulation km was a constant. Here\nwe have introduced a dependence of this parameter on the concentration of VEGF V .\nVEGF is produced by many types of cells, including tumor cells, as a response to hy-\npoxia. VEGF stimulates proliferation of the endothelial cells lining the vessels. Thus\nby assuming km = km(V ) we model directly the interaction between the surrounding\ntissue and the vasculature, rather than the effective interaction introduced in [60].\nWhen the tissue is oxygen-starved, VEGF is produced and released. This changes the\nstructure of the vascular network and the oxygen distribution, which may, in turn,\nreduce the rate of production of VEGF. In sections 4 and 5, we explain how our\nmodel cells produce and release VEGF and how it diffuses through the tissue.\nA more realistic way of modeling the interaction between the tissue and vascu-\nlature would be to introduce angiogenesis, i.e., recruitment of new blood vessels in\nresponse to the angiogenic stimulus (i.e., VEGF). Rather than explicitly introducing\nnew vessels that sprout from the existing vasculature, we simply increase the radius\nof the existing vessels. Basically we are replacing a complex network of vessels by\na single effective cylindrical vessel of an appropriate radius. This approximation is\nused extensively in plant sciences to model nutrient uptake: the complex tree-like\nroot structure is modeled by a single cylinder of an equivalent radius [8, 50, 62]. The\nangiogenic response in our model, therefore, leads to an increase in the radii of the\nvessels. In particular, we assume that the intensity of the metabolic stimulus in (3.3)\nis modulated by the local concentration of VEGF. The particular expression we use\n5In [60] other stimuli were considered. We have considered only these three, since they provide\nthe simplest stable adaptation mechanism.\n448 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K. MAINI\nto implement this interaction is\nkm(V ) = k\n0\nm\n(\n1 +\nV\nV0 + V\n)\n.(3.5)\nAnother factor we consider is blood rheology. Blood is not a simple fluid with\nconstant viscosity: it is a complex suspension of cells and molecules of a wide range\nof sizes. Thus, modeling blood as a Newtonian fluid is a crude approximation. On\nthe other hand, trying to tackle the problem of blood rheology in all its complexity\nwould be an overwhelming task. Hence, as in [3], we focus only on the effect of the\nred blood cells (RBCs), as they seem to play a major role in blood flow [24].\nDue to the presence of RBCs the blood viscosity depends on the haematocrit (H)\nand on the radius (R). For a given H, the viscosity depends nonmonotonically on R,\nand three different flow regimes may be identified. If R is much greater than the\ntypical size of a RBC,6 the viscosity is independent of R. As R decreases, the viscosity\nalso decreases (the Fahraeus\u2013Lindqvist effect). This behavior persists until the vessel\nradius is of the order of 15\u201320 \u00b5m. The viscosity then reaches a minimum and,\nthereafter, increases if R is similar in magnitude to the radius of a RBC [58]. Pries\net al. have fitted the following explicit expression for the viscosity as a function of\nR and H to detailed experimental data [58]:\n\u00b5blood = \u00b5plasma \u00b7 \u00b5rel,\n\u00b5rel =\n[\n1 + (\u00b5\u22170.45 \u2212 1)\n(1\u2212H)C \u2212 1\n(1\u2212 0.45)C \u2212 1\n(\n2R\n2R\u2212 1.1\n)2](\n2R\n2R\u2212 1.1\n)2\n,\n\u00b5\u22170.45 = 6e\n\u22120.17R + 3.2\u2212 2.44e\u22120.06(2R)0.645 ,\nC =\n(\n0.8 + e\u22120.15R\n)(\u22121 + 1\n1 + 10\u221211(2R)12\n)\n+\n1\n1 + 10\u221211(2R)12\n,(3.6)\nwhere \u00b5rel is the blood viscosity scaled by the viscosity of the plasma.\nSince \u00b5rel depends on H, the haematocrit distribution is an important factor\nwhen determining the hydrodynamic state of the network. The simplest way to pro-\nceed is to assume that at each bifurcation the distribution of H depends on the flow\nvelocity in each of the daughter vessels [24]. Roughly speaking, a larger proportion of\nthe haematocrit from the parent vessel is transported along the faster branch. Addi-\ntionally, it has been observed in model experiments with rubber, RBC-shaped pellets\nthat at bifurcations where the ratio between the velocities of the branches exceeds a\ncertain threshold, all of the haematocrit enters the faster branch. Combining these\nresults we assume that, at a bifurcation, the haematocrit is distributed as follows:\nHp = H1 +H2;\nH1\nH2\n= \u03b1\nv1\nv2\n, if\nv1\nv2\n< THR;\nH1 = Hp, if\nv1\nv2\n> THR,(3.7)\nwhere Hp is the haematocrit in the parent vessel, H1 and H2 are the haematocrits\nin the daughter vessels, vi (i = 1, 2) are the average flow velocities on a section\northogonal to the axis of the daughter vessels and are defined by vi \u2261 Q\u02d9i\/\u03c0R2i , \u03b1 is a\n6The average RBC diameter in humans is 7\u20138 \u00b5m.\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 449\n(a) (b)\nFig. 4.

In these\nfigures the greyscale corresponds to the concentration of haematocrit: lighter grey corresponds to\nhigher haematocrit levels.\nphenomenological parameter which accounts for the strength of the asymmetry of the\nhaematocrit distribution at bifurcations, and THR is the value of the ratio between\nthe velocities of the branches above, where all of the haematocrit goes to the faster\nbranch.\nThe features displayed by the viscosity and the behavior of RBCs at bifurcations\ngive rise to a highly complex, nonlinear problem, in which the viscosity depends on\nthe dynamical state of the entire vascular network, including the vessel radii. The\nvessel radii, in turn, depend on the hydrodynamic quantities through the adaptation\nmechanism [3].\nFigure 4 shows results of our blood flow simulations, in particular of the distribu-\ntion of haematocrit. Figure 4(a) corresponds to the case analyzed in [3], in which the\nevolution of the vasculature is independent of the tissue. Figure 4(b) shows the result\nfor a case in which there is tissue-vasculature interaction through the aforementioned\ndependence of the metabolic stimulus on the VEGF concentration (see section 7.1 for\ndetails). We can see that the distribution of haematocrit is sparser in the second case,\ndue to this interaction.\nThe process leading to this tissue-dependent vascular remodeling can be under-\nstood by looking at Figure 5. The three panels in the top row show the spatial\ndistribution of cells (Figure 5(a)), the distribution of oxygen (Figure 5(b)), and the\ndistribution of VEGF (Figure 5(c)), for an early stage of colony development. Figures\n5(d), (e), and (f) (middle row) show the same quantities for an intermediate stage of\ncolony growth. Figures 5(g), (h), and (i) (bottom row) show the stationary distribu-\ntions of these three quantities. Initially, oxygen (which corresponds to the distribution\nof haematocrit shown in Figure 4(a)) is concentrated in a localized region. Cells at\na distance from this region are starved of oxygen and respond by producing VEGF\n(Figures 5(b) and (c)). In response to VEGF, the vasculature remodels itself, allowing\nmore oxygen to reach those regions and allowing further growth of the colony (Figures\n5(d) and (e)). As a consequence of growth, oxygen is used up, and more cells become\n450 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K.

This VEGF promotes further remodeling\nof the vascular network.

In this section we discuss the discrete dynamics used\nto model the cells. After providing the basic definitions and notation, we will give\nan account of how our cells interact with each other and how we formulate the dif-\nferent boundary value problems used to determine the distribution of oxygen and\nextracellular VEGF within the tissue domain.\nWe consider a square lattice, L = Z2, consisting of a set of elements (nodes)\nlabeled by their positions r \u2208 L, with r = (i, j) i, j \u2208 Z (see Figure 6). With each\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 451\nFig. 6. Schematic representation of the lattice used in our simulations.\nnode of the lattice we associate a neighborhood. For our square lattice the nearest\nneighbors neighborhood is given by\nN (r) = {r+ ck; k = 1, . . . , b},\nc1 = (1, 0),\nc2 = (0, 1),\nc3 = (\u22121, 0),\nc4 = (0,\u22121).(4.1)\nThe constant b is the coordination number of the lattice. In our case, b = 4. The\nnearest neighbors neighborhood is basically determined by the geometry of the lattice.\nEach element is characterized by a state s(r):\ns(r) : r \u2208 L \u2212\u2192 E ,(4.2)\nwhere E = Z2 \u00d7 R11 is our state space, which in the present case is 13-dimensional.\nThe first component s1(r) corresponds to the type of cell occupying the element r: it\ntakes value 0 if it is empty, 1 if it is a cancer cell, 2 if it is a normal cell, and 3 if it\nis a vessel. The second component stores the number of divisions that the cell has\nundergone (see section 5). This is set to zero for an empty element or an element\noccupied by a vessel. Components 3 and 4 are for the local concentration of oxygen\nand extracellular VEGF. Components 5\u20139 store the concentration of the substances\ncontrolling the cell-cycle (see section 5.1). The last three components are occupied\nby the cell phase (see section 5.1), the local expression of p53, and the intracellular\nconcentration of VEGF (see section 5.2).\nWe have incorporated the vessels (black elements) by mapping the vascular grid G\nonto L. Starting with an empty lattice (i.e., s1(r) = 0 for all r) we have performed\nthe following operation:\ns1(4(\u00b5\u2212 1) + 1, 4(\u03bd \u2212 1) + 1) = 3 \u2200(\u00b5, \u03bd) \u2208 G such that N(\u00b5, \u03bd) = 1.(4.3)\nThis operation maps the vertices of the vascular network onto L. The next step is\nto fill the elements connecting the vertices by a straight line with vessel elements\n(s1(r) = 3). Likewise, we assign the values of the hydrodynamic and vascular quan-\ntities, in particular the haematocrit, which are associated with the corresponding\nvessel.\n452 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K. MAINI\nOnce we have mapped the distribution of haematocrit onto L, we can solve the\nboundary value problem (BVP) for the oxygen as in [3]. Assuming that the relaxation\ntime for the oxygen distribution is much shorter than the characteristic time scale for\nthe evolution of the cells, we can write\nDP\u22072P \u2212 kP (r)P = 0.(4.4)\nThe function k(r), which is updated on each iteration of our automaton, depends\non the cell distribution and is defined by\nkP (r) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\nkPN if there is a normal cell at r,\nkPC if there is a cancer cell at r,\n0 otherwise.\n(4.5)\nIt remains to prescribe appropriate boundary conditions for (4.4), which couple\nthe dynamics of the tissue with the distribution of haematocrit in the vascular net-\nwork. Oxygen enters the system by crossing the walls of the vessels, the flux being\ngiven by \u0005J = \u2212DP\u2207P . Thus we impose the following mixed boundary conditions at\nthe walls of the vessels:\n\u2212DPnw \u00b7 \u2207P = P(Pb \u2212 P ),(4.6)\nwhere nw is the unit outward vector, orthogonal to the vessel wall, P is the perme-\nability of the vessel, and Pb is the oxygen level inside the vessel, which is essentially\ndetermined by the haematocrit. Physically, this means that we are assuming that the\nrate of leakage of oxygen through the walls of the vessels is equal to its rate of diffu-\nsion, meaning that the transport process is in steady state. We also impose no-flux\nboundary conditions along the edges of our domain, \u2126:\nn|\u2202\u2126 \u00b7 \u2207P = 0,(4.7)\nwhere n|\u2202\u2126 is the unit outward vector, orthogonal to the boundary of the domain.\nP is assigned to the state vector as s3(r) = P (r).\nAnother quantity for which we have to solve a BVP is the distribution of extra-\ncellular VEGF. VEGF is secreted by hypoxic cells and released into the extracellular\nmedium when the intracellular concentration reaches a threshold (see sections 5.2\nand 6). We make the same adiabatic approximation for VEGF that we have made\nfor oxygen. Hence, the equation we have to solve is\nDQ\u22072Q+ kQ(r)Q = 0,(4.8)\nwhere Q is the extracellular VEGF concentration. In this case, we have a source term\ngiven by\nkQ(\u0005x) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\nkQN if there is a normal hypoxic cell at r,\nkQC if there is a cancer hypoxic cell at r,\n0 otherwise,\n(4.9)\nwhere kQN and k\nQ\nC are constants. For how we determine when a cell becomes hypoxic\nwe refer the reader to section 6. Q is assigned to the state vector as s4(r) = Q(r).\nDetails of the numerical procedure used to solve the above BVPs are given in\nAppendix A of [3].\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 453\nN\nN\nC N NC\nC\nN\nBIGGER THRESHOLD SMALLER THRESHOLD\nFig. 7. Two examples showing how thresholds are assigned.\nThe last issue we deal with here is cell-to-cell interaction. In the present model\nthe only cell-to-cell interaction we consider is competition between the two popula-\ntions of cells. It is known that under certain circumstances cancer cells modify their\nenvironment, providing these cells with a competitive advantage over normal cells, for\nexample by increasing acidity [28, 29]. Tumor cells show greater resistance to acidic\nenvironments than their normal counterparts. Consequently, they are able (by us-\ning glycolytic metabolism rather than aerobic metabolism) to increase the acidity in\ntheir microenvironment, thus providing neighboring cancer cells with a competitive\nadvantage over their normal counterparts. In our model, certain critical decisions\n(apoptosis, VEGF release, etc.) will be taken when the intracellular concentration\nof a particular chemical (see section 5) reaches a critical threshold. The way we\nincorporate such competition is by fixing these thresholds appropriately [3].\nThe threshold for a cell located at r to undergo a particular transition (say, for\nexample, apoptosis, which, as detailed in section 5, in our model is controlled by\nthe level of expression of p53) is determined by sampling its neighborhood. If the\nneighborhood contains more (or the same number of) cells of the same type as the\none at r, then the threshold is fixed at a value larger than the value we assign if the\nneighborhood contains fewer cells of the same type as the one at r. An example is given\nin Figure 7. Here, in order to decide whether a normal cell will undergo apoptosis, its\np53 concentration is compared to a threshold value. If the p53 concentration exceeds\nthe threshold, then the cell will undergo apoptosis. However, to fix the threshold, we\nconsider the neighborhood of the cell under consideration. If, as is the case in the left\nplot of Figure 7, the neighborhood of our normal cell contains more normal cells than\ncancer cells, then the threshold value will be fixed to a value higher than that for the\nsituation shown on the right plot of Figure 7, where the neighborhood contains more\ncancer cells than normal cells. As a result, a normal cell is more resistant to apoptosis\nwhen it is surrounded by more normal cells than cancer cells since the amount of p53\nthat the cell must accumulate in order to undergo apoptosis is larger.\n5. Cell division dynamics, apoptosis, and VEGF production. In this\nsection we give details of the internal dynamics of the elements that are occupied by\na cell. To those sites, where either s1(r) = 1 or s1(r) = 2, we attach a set of ODEs\ngoverning cell division, apoptosis, and VEGF production. These ODEs model the\nevolution of the chemicals controlling those processes at the intracellular level, which\ndetermine the \u201cmicroscopic state\u201d of each element.\n454 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K. MAINI\n5.1. Cell-cycle: Effects of hypoxia. The dynamics of the cell division cycle\ncan be affected by the extracellular conditions, in particular by the level of extra-\ncellular oxygen: low oxygen concentration (hypoxia) yields alterations in the normal\nprogression of the cell through its division cycle [14].\nThe cell-cycle is the set of events which, eventually, leads to cell division. During\nthe cell-cycle a cell duplicates each of its components, most importantly its chromo-\nsomes. The cell-cycle is usually divided into four phases (G1, S, G2, and M). The\ncell goes through two irreversible transitions during its division process. The first\nof these transitions occurs at the end of G1: \u201cStart.\u201d During G1 the cell monitors\nits environment and its own size [6, 69]. When the external conditions and the size\nof the cell are suitable, the cell commits itself to the process. The second of these\ntransitions, \u201cFinish,\u201d7 occurs when DNA replication is completed. Once the cell has\nchecked that the DNA replication process has taken place without error and that\nchromatide alignment has been successful, this transition is triggered, and the cell\nfinally undergoes division into two daughter cells.\nDuring G1, activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is low because the rele-\nvant cyclin partners are missing: their production is inhibited, and they are rapidly\ndegraded. At \u201cStart\u201d cyclin synthesis is promoted, and hence the CDKs are activated.\nCDK activity remains high during S, G2, and M, since it is necessary for DNA repli-\ncation and other processes occurring during the final stages of the cycle. At \u201cFinish\u201d\na protein complex, the anaphase protein complex, is activated and marks specific tar-\nget proteins (such as cyclins) for degradation by the proteolytic machinery of the cell.\nThis protein complex is composed of a dozen polypeptides and two auxiliary proteins:\nCdc20 and Cdh1. When active, these two proteins present the target proteins to\nthe core of the complex for labeling. Together, they label cyclins for destruction at\nthe end of the cycle, allowing the control system to return to G1. Cdc20 and Cdh1\nactivity is also controlled by cyclin-CDK complexes. However, cyclin-CDKs control\neach protein differently: while cyclin-CDK activates Cdc20, it inhibits Cdh1.\nDespite the great number of differences between the cell-cycle of cancerous and\nnormal cells [25], some mechanisms are common to both types of cell. In particular,\nregulation of the transition through the check points is accomplished by the CDK\nnetwork in both cases.\nIn normal cells hypoxia simply slows down (arrests) the division process, whereas\nin cancer cells it stimulates both arrest and quiescence; i.e., cells go into a latent state\nin which most of their functions, including proliferation, are suspended. The ability\nof cancer cells to go into a quiescent state provides them with a remarkable resistance\nto hypoxia [64].\nBuilding on a previous model [69] and experimental information on the effects of\nhypoxia on the cell-cycle [27], we have formulated a model which accounts for arrest\nof the transition through the restriction point under hypoxic stress and (some of) the\ndifferences in the response to hypoxia of cancer and normal cells (see [4]). To model\nthe effect of hypoxia on the cell-cycle we have to consider a new element in the CDK\nnetwork [25, 27], the protein p27, which inhibits the activity of the complex Cyc-CDK,\nthus inhibiting DNA synthesis. It has been shown that p27 production is stimulated\nby hypoxia, thus mediating hypoxia-induced arrest of the G1\/S transition. In [27] the\nauthors were able to gather experimental evidence to construct the picture of hypoxia-\ninduced G1 arrest: hypoxia causes an overexpression of p27, which downregulates the\nactivity of the cyclin-CDK complexes, which, in turn, prevents normal progress of the\n7We have adopted the nomenclature used by [69].\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 455\ncell through the \u201cStart\u201d transition (see [27] and [4] for a complete account). Note\nthat the model that Tyson and Novak presented in [69] was originally formulated for\nyeast. However, yeast has been extensively used as an experimental model system for\nthe study of the cell-cycle in eukariotic cells, since the basic regulatory mechanisms\nare believed to be the same for all eukariotic cells, including mammalian cells [6].\nThus, we have used the model reported in [69], although the actual CDK regulatory\nnetwork is more complex in mammalian cells. The experiments reported in [27] on\nthe effects of hypoxia on the cell-cycle were carried out using fibroblasts.\nBased on these observations, the model that we propose (full details given in [4])\nis\ndx(r)\ndt\n=\n(k\u20323 + k\n\u2032\u2032\n3u(r))(1\u2212 x(r))\nJ3 + 1\u2212 x(r) \u2212\nk4m(r)y(r)x(r)\nJ4 + x(r)\n,(5.1)\ndy(r)\ndt\n= k1 \u2212 (k\u20322 + k\u2032\u20322x(r) + k\u2032\u2032\u20322 z(r))y(r),(5.2)\ndm(r)\ndt\n= \u00b5\n(\ny(r)\ny(r) + y0\n)\nm(r)\n(\n1\u2212 m(r)\nm\u2217\n)\n,(5.3)\ndz(r)\ndt\n= \u03c7(m, r)\u2212 k\u20325\nP (r)\nB + P (r)\nz(r),(5.4)\ndu(r)\ndt\n= k\u20326 \u2212 (k\u20326 + k6y(r))u(r),(5.5)\nv = 1\u2212 u,(5.6)\nwhere x is the concentration of Cdh1, an antagonist of cyc-CDK, y is the concentration\nof cyc-CDK complexes, m is the mass of the cell, z is the concentration of p27,\nu is the concentration of nonphosphorylated (RB), and v is the concentration of\nphosphorylated RB (RBP). The dependence on r reminds us that this is a local,\ninternal dynamics.\nIn (5.4) the production rate for p27, \u03c7(m, r), depends on the type of cell at r:\n\u03c7(m, r) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\nk5 if s1(r) = 1 (i.e., if there is a cancer cell at r),\nk5\n(\n1\u2212 m(r)m\u2217\n)\nif s1(r) = 2 (i.e., if there is a normal cell at r),\n0 otherwise.\n(5.7)\nWe have assumed that p27 production is modulated by cell growth in normal cells,\nwhereas no such control has been assumed to act on p27 production in cancer cells. We\nrefer the reader to [4] for a detailed discussion of the experimental evidence supporting\nthis assumption.\nWe have introduced here a new element with respect to the model presented in [4],\nnamely, a dependence of the growth rate of the mass of the cell on the concentration\nof cyc-CDK complexes (see (5.3)). In general, cell growth is not independent of the\nexternal conditions nor of its own state of development. The dependence of m on y\nin (5.3) is intended to account for this. For example, if the level of oxygen is low, the\ncell will arrest in G1, and the concentration of cyc-CDK complexes will be kept low\nlonger. This, according to (5.3), will slow down cell growth and is consistent with the\nfact that low levels of oxygen yield a smaller growth rate. However, this modification\nchanges neither the basic results obtained in [4] nor their mechanisms.\nIn addition, if s(r) = 1, 2, we define a phase, \u03c6(r), which gives the position of the\n456 T.

Its dynamics is given by\nd\u03c6(r)\ndt\n= \u03b7(x(r), y(r))\u2212 sin(\u03c6(r)\u2212 \u03c60),(5.8)\nwhere\n\u03b7(x(r), y(r)) =\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\n0 if y(r) < THR1,\n0.5 if y(r) > THR1 and y(r) < THR2,\n1.5 if y(r) > THR2 and x(r) < THR3\n(5.9)\nwith THR1 < THR2. Equation (5.8) is such that when \u03b7(x(r), y(r)) = 0 there is\na stable fixed point \u03c6\u221e = \u03c60. Since \u03b7 = 0 when y(r) is very low, this fixed point\ncorresponds to the cell being in G1. If 0 < \u03b7(x(r), y(r)) < 1, then (5.8) has an unstable\nfixed point and a stable fixed point \u03c6\u221e > \u03c60. Since this is the situation when y(r)\nis bigger than some threshold, this fixed point corresponds to a cell in S-G2-M. If\n\u03b7(x(r), y(r)) > 1, there are no fixed points of (5.8), which means that the cell has\ngone through all the check points and is committed to finishing the cell-cycle. When\n\u03c6(r) = 2\u03c0 the cell divides and the control systems of both the new and old cells are\n(re)set to the initial state: x(r) = 0.9, y(r) = 0.001, m(r) = 5, z(r) = 0, u(r) = 0,\n\u03c6(r) = 0.\nWe can count the number of divisions a given cell has undergone, n(r), using \u03c6(r):\nn(r) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03b4\u03c6(r,t),2\u03c0 dt.(5.10)\nIn our lattice element, n is assigned to the state vector as s2(r) = n(r), and\nthe substances controlling the cell-cycle are stored as s5(r) = x(r), s6(r) = y(r),\ns7(r) = m(r), s8(r) = z(r), s9(r) = u(r), s10(r) = v(r), and s11(r) = \u03c6(r).\nWe now summarize the most significant results of our cell-cycle models of normal\nand cancer cells (see [4] for a full analysis). Both models produce hypoxia-induced ar-\nrest of the G1\/S transition, which yields longer division times (see Figure 8). However,\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 457\nif we look at Figure 8(b), where we have shown how the division times for cancer cells\nvary with the oxygen tension, P , we observe a vertical asymptote for a given value of\nthe oxygen tension. Such behavior is not observed in normal cells (see Figure 8(a)).\nThe origin of this behavior is that the cancer cell model exhibits (hypoxia-induced)\nquiescence, i.e., the ability of halting the cell-cycle, rather than merely delaying or\narresting it. Such a behavior is actually observed in cancer cells [4]. In fact, the\nability of cancer cells to enter a quiescent state under hypoxic stress is one of the\nmain reasons why cancer cells are so remarkably resistant to hypoxia [64]. There\nis experimental evidence that quiescent cells are much less susceptible to apoptosis\nthan proliferating cells [18, 49]. On the other hand, since transition to quiescence is\nreversible, cancer cells might wait in the quiescence state (where they are \u201cprotected\u201d\nfrom apoptosis) while normal cells are starving and dying. This allows them to wait\nuntil the total (normal+cancer) cell density has diminished and there is more oxygen\navailable, so they can come back to the proliferative state.\nAnother feature that emerges from our cancer cell model concerns the behavior\nof the concentration of p27 averaged over a period of division:\n\u3008z\u3009 = 1\nTD\n\u222b TD\n0\nz(t) dt,(5.11)\nand its dependence on k5 and k\n\u2032\n5 regulate the production and decay rates of p27 (see\n(5.4)). This quantity increases as the ratio k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 increases. On the other hand, the\ndivision time also increases with k5\/k\n\u2032\n5. From this result we can predict that there is\na correlation between the proliferation rate of the cancer cells and \u3008z\u3009 [4]: the latter\ndecreases when the former increases. This agrees with a recent clinical trial in which\nlow levels of p27 appear to be a poor prognostic factor [43]. We will return to this in\nsection 7.2.\n5.2. Other responses to hypoxia: Apoptosis and VEGF production.\nIn this section we account for the intracellular dynamics of the other two hypoxia-\ninduced cellular responses that we consider, namely, apoptosis and VEGF production.\nWe formulate models for the levels of expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53\nand the intracellular concentration of VEGF.\nThe p53 gene plays a fundamental role in many biological processes, including\ntumor growth [64, 26] and hypoxia-induced cellular responses. In particular, the\nwild-type p53 gene mediates apoptosis (programmed cell death) in various situations,\nsuch as DNA damage, hypoxia, the presence of certain cytokines, and metabolic\nchanges [42]. It has been shown in several studies [64, 31, 65] that cells which have\nlost p53 expression (null cells) or have acquired a mutation in the p53 gene (mutant\ncells) can survive under hypoxia for longer periods than their wild-type counterparts\ndue to the decrease in apoptosis caused by abnormal functioning of the p53 gene.\nMoreover, it has been shown that tumor cells expressing mutant p53 have an adaptive\nadvantage over tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 [26].\nIn addition to cell-cycle arrest, hypoxia induces other cellular responses (see Fig-\nure 9). As shown in Figure 9(a), in both normal and cancer cells, hypoxia stimulates\nVEGF production, p53 expression, and apoptosis. In normal cells, p53 expression\nstimulates apoptosis and may also inhibit VEGF production [64]. In many cases,\nmutations in p53 in cancer cells may lead to a scenario in which p53 apparently up-\nregulates VEGF production and stops triggering apoptosis [64]. This last scenario\nis the one we consider in our model. Figure 9(b) shows the corresponding hypoxia-\ninduced response in (mutant) cancer cells. In this case, hypoxia also induces VEGF\n458 T.

See [64].\nproduction, p53 expression, and apoptosis. However, the role of the p53 gene is differ-\nent: we assume that p53 does not seem to alter the rate of hypoxia-induced apoptosis\nand, in contrast to what happens in normal cells, it inhibits VEGF production.\nThe model we propose to account for levels of expression of p53 is the same for\nnormal and cancer cells. We assume that the background production rate is constant\nand that the decay rate is modulated by the local level of extracellular oxygen:\ndp(r)\ndt\n= k7 \u2212 k\u20327\nP (r)\nC + P (r)\np(r),(5.12)\nwhere p represents the concentration of p53 within a given cell.\nWhen considering intracellular VEGF, we distinguish between normal and cancer\ncells:\ndq(r)\ndt\n= \u03be(p, q, r)\u2212 k\u20328\nP (r)\nD + P (r)\nq(r),(5.13)\nwhere q represents the concentration of VEGF and\n\u03be(p, q, r) =\n{\nk8 + k\n\u2032\u2032\n8\npq\nJ5+q\nif s1(r) = 1 (cancer cell),\nk8 \u2212 k\u2032\u20328 pqJ5+q if s1(r) = 2 (normal cell).\n(5.14)\nIn (5.13) the dependence on the extracellular level of oxygen accounts for the fact\nthat VEGF expression is stimulated by hypoxia. Equation (5.14) accounts for the\ndifferent regulation of p53 expression in normal and cancer cells (see Figure 9). We\nhave assumed Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics for the inhibition (activation) of VEGF by\np53 in normal (cancer) cells.\nThe intracellular concentration of VEGF is assigned to the automaton state vector\nas s12(r) = q(r) and the level of expression of p53 as s13(r) = p(r).\nTo solve numerically the systems of ODEs we use a four-stage Runge\u2013Kutta\nmethod [56] with an extended stability region [70].\n6. Rules for the evolution of our physiologically structured model. The\nrules governing the evolution of the automaton elements are as follows.\n1. An element that is empty or occupied by a vessel does not evolve directly.\nHowever, an empty element can change its state (to an occupied element)\nwhen cell division takes place in a neighboring element that is occupied by a\ncell.\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 459\n2. The distribution of oxygen is calculated by solving an appropriate boundary\nvalue problem, as described in section 4.\n3. We determine the type of cell in an occupied element from the first component\nof its state vector. At each time step we solve the ODEs determining the\ninternal (cell-cycle, VEGF production, and p53 expression) dynamics of the\ncell. The internal dynamics are modulated by the extracellular oxygen, as\nexplained in section 5.\n4. Cells (either normal or cancerous) attempt division when the local phase\n\u03c6(r) = 2\u03c0.\n5. When a cell attempts division, we sample in a region of radius R around the\nelement.8 If there is only one empty space, then the cell divides, and the new\ncell occupies this empty space. If there is more than one empty space, the\nnew cell goes to the free element with the largest oxygen concentration [52].\nIf there is no empty space, the cell fails to divide and dies [40].\n6. When the oxygen concentration is low, normal cells become sources of VEGF.\nThis process is controlled in turn by the local intracellular concentration of\nVEGF (which is controlled by the concentration of extracellular oxygen and\nthe level of expression of p53 (section 5.2)). If q(r) is above a threshold value,\nqTHR, the cell releases VEGF into the extracellular medium. We determine\nthe threshold value by sampling the occupation state of its nearest neighbors,\nas explained in section 4.\n7. Under sustained hypoxia, normal cells die. This process is controlled by the\nlocal level of p53 (which is controlled by the concentration of extracellular\noxygen (section 5.2)). If p(r) is above a threshold value, pTHR, the cell dies.\nWe determine the threshold value by sampling the occupation state of its\nnearest neighbors, as explained in section 4.\n8. Cancer cells whose local oxygen concentration is very low enter a quiescent\nor latent state, during which most of the cell functions are suspended, in-\ncluding proliferation (section 5.1). On entering this state, a clock is started.\nThe clock is incremented by one unit for each iteration the cell remains in\nthe quiescent state, i.e., while the oxygen level remains below threshold. If\nthe clock reaches a given value the cell dies. However, if at some time the\noxygen level goes above threshold the cell returns to the proliferating state\nand its clock is reset to zero. Cancer cells in the quiescent state become\nsources of VEGF. The transition from the \u201cproliferative\u201d to the quiescent\nstate is triggered by the local concentration of p27: when z(r) is above a\nthreshold, zTHR, the cell enters the quiescent state. In this case the thresh-\nold is fixed by the internal dynamics, and no sampling of the environment is\ndone.\n9. Elements occupied by normal and cancer cells are sinks of oxygen.\n10. Extracellular VEGF diffuses through the tissue according to the BVP formu-\nlated in section 4. VEGF eventually reaches the vasculature and interacts\nwith it through the vascular adaptation mechanism, (3.3). This changes the\nstructure of the network and therefore the distribution of haematocrit (sec-\ntion 3), thereby yielding a new oxygen distribution.\nThe internal state of each one of the (occupied) elements of the lattice is updated\nsynchronously. These rules are summarized in the flow chart in Figure 10.\nThe values of parameters used in our simulations are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n8In the simulations below, R = 1 in element units.\n460 T.

As in [3], we have performed two types of simulated\nexperiments: the growth of a colony (either a two- or one-species colony) occupying\nempty space and the invasion of a healthy tissue by a malignant colony.\nIn this section we use our model to study how growth and invasion occur in three\ndifferent situations, namely, in a homogeneous environment (uniform distribution of\noxygen), in an inhomogeneous environment with vasculature decoupled from the tis-\nsue, and, finally, in the most complex situation in which the vasculature and tissue\nare coupled. To see the differences between the patterns of growth in the different\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 461\nTable 1\nParameter values used for our numerical computations.

We observe (Figure 11(a)) that in the\ncase of a homogeneous environment, as in [3], the colony grows in a regular fashion\nuntil it occupies all the space available. In fact, Figure 12 shows how in this case the\ncolony grows in a symmetric way. By contrast, when the same colony is grown under\nan inhomogeneous distribution of haematocrit (see Figure 4), the colony grows to a\nsaturation size (Figure 11(b)) and follows a pattern of spreading that is much more\nheterogeneous (Figures 12(d), (e), and (f)). A similar phenomenon is observed when\nwe couple vascular structural adaptation and colony development: the colony does not\ntake over all the space available, and the pattern of spreading is rather heterogeneous\n(see Figure 11(c) and Figures 12(g), (h), and (i)). However, one difference is observed:\nthe colony grows to a significantly larger saturation size. These results are consistent\n462 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K.

In the second\nscenario, invasion, an initial colony of cancer cells is placed in a \u201ctissue\u201d composed\nof normal cells, empty spaces, and vasculature. The aim is to determine conditions\nunder which cancer cells can take over the tissue. In both cases we assume that the\nvasculature and tissue are coupled.\nThe results for a two-species colony are shown in Figures 13 and 14.

Therefore, the cancer cells are better competitors\nthan normal cells.\nThe results shown in Figures 15 and 16 correspond to invasion of a healthy tissue\nby a malignant colony. Due to the better competitive character of the cancer cells,\nthe initial small colony (Figure 16(a)) spreads over a significant part of the tissue\n464 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K.

As mentioned in section 5.1, a recent clinical\ntrial has concluded that low levels of p27 in high-grade astrocytomas constitute a\npoor prognostic indicator [43]. The authors of this study attribute this feature to\ntwo factors: increased proliferative activity and decreased apoptosis produced by low\nlevels of p27.\nIn section 5.1, we have shown that our model of the cell-cycle reproduces the first\nof these characteristics: low levels of p27 correlate with smaller division times [4]. In\nour model this is achieved by changing the ratio k5\/k\n\u2032\n5: when this ratio increases,\nboth the concentration of p27 and the division time increase.\nWe have carried out model simulations introducing into the cell-cycle model for\nthe cancer cells different values of the ratio k5\/k\n\u2032\n5. We have measured the quantity:\nz =\n1\nNc\n\u2211\nr\u2208I\nz(r)\u03b4s1(r),1,(7.1)\nwhich is the spatial average of p27 protein expressed by the cancer cells. In (7.1) Nc is\nthe total number of cancer cells. Our results show that z increases with k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 (see\nTable 3).\nOn the other hand, if we look at the evolution of the colonies of normal and\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 465\n(a) (b)\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n(c) (d)\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFig. 14.

This corresponds to the lower level of p27 in Table 3.\nWhen k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.6 (Figure 17(b)), the stationary state is coexistence between the two\nspecies. If k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.7 we observe that cancer cells disappear and normal cells take\nover. This latter case is the one in which a higher z is obtained.\nFigures 17(d), (e), and (f) show the spatial distribution of p27 in cancer cells for\nk5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.2, k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.6, and k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.7, respectively. We see from these plots\nthat the concentration of p27 is lower for small values of k5\/k\n\u2032\n5. Figures 18(a) and (b)\nshow the number of divisions undergone by each cell for k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.2 and k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 = 0.6,\nrespectively. This can be interpreted as a map of the mitotic activity of the system.9\nIf we compare Figures 17(d) and (e) to Figures 18(a) and (b), respectively, we can see\nthat regions where the mitotic activity is higher correlate with regions where levels of\np27 are lower. We can also see by comparing Figures 18(a) to 18(b) that the mitotic\nactivity is higher in the first case (smaller k5\/k\n\u2032\n5, i.e., smaller z, according to Table 3).\n9Recall that the number of divisions a given cell has undergone is given by (5.10) and is stored\nas the component s2(r) of the state vector.\n466 T.

Time evolution populations of normal and cancer cells in the simulation of invasion.\nThe dashed line corresponds to normal cells, whereas the solid line corresponds to cancer cells.\nk5\/k\u20325 = 0.2.\nHence, we can see that the change of behavior of our model brought about by\nincreased k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 is, at least in part, related to a reduced proliferative capacity of\nthe cancer cells when this parameter ratio is increased. While this agrees with the\nobservations made in [43], it is not entirely due to a reduced proliferative capacity. If\nwe compare Figures 8(a) and (b), we see that when k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 increases from 0.2 to 0.7\nthe proliferation rate of the cancer cells becomes comparable to that of the normal\ncells but not much bigger. However, in [4] we have shown that increasing k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 also\nincreases the tendency to quiescence. On the one hand, this decreases the number\nof proliferating cancer cells. On the other hand, some of these quiescent cells will\nrevert to the proliferative state if the external conditions change appropriately, while\nothers will eventually die. As a result, the apoptosis rate of cancer cells is increased\nby overexpression of p27. This is also in agreement with the results of [43].\n8. Growth laws. We now investigate the growth laws exhibited by our model.\nThis is important since growth laws are used for determining the clinical course of\na malignancy and designing more efficient treatment protocols [19]. In this section\nwe show that the usual laws deduced from standard population dynamics models\n(e.g., logistic or Gompertz), which have been already shown to be not completely\naccurate [35], do not reproduce the behavior observed in cancer colonies evolving\naccording to our model. However, the dynamics of colonies of normal cells fits quite\nwell with the Gompertz law.\nThe Gompertz law arises from a population dynamics model in which the growth\nrate is proportional to the population size and the decay rate depends exponentially\non it. The solution for such a model is given by\nNG(t) = K exp(\u2212\u03bbe\u2212 rtlnK ),(8.1)\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 467\n(a) (b)\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n(c) (d)\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFig. 16.

(d) shows the corresponding distribution of\noxygen. In (d) the greyscale corresponds to the concentration of oxygen: lighter grey corresponds to\nhigher oxygen levels.\nwhere K is the carrying capacity, r is the growth rate, \u03bb = ln N0K , and N0 is the initial\npopulation size.

We use LG as a reference to determine whether a population\nis growing according to the Gompertz law.\n8.1. One-species colonies. We have carried out simulations for colonies con-\ntaining only one species, either normal or cancer cells, and plotted the corresponding\nLG. Figure 19(a) shows the quantity LG for a colony of cancer cells. We can see that\nLG does not depend linearly on time as we would expect for a population evolving\naccording to the Gompertz law. On the other hand, Figure 19(b) shows that the\nbehavior of a colony of normal cells may be well approximated by the Gompertz law.\n8.2. Two-species colonies. With two-species colonies we have different situ-\nations to consider. First we consider values of k5\/k\n\u2032\n5 for which the cancer cells take\nover.

Solid lines correspond to cancer cells and dashed lines\nto normal cells. (d), (e), and (f) show the corresponding pattern of concentration of p27 in cancer\ncells.

Once again, the\ncancer cells do not behave as predicted by the Gompertz law (Figure 19(d)).

Solid lines correspond to the fitted curve and\ndashed lines to the results of our simulations.\nFigures 20(a) and 20(c) show that the growth of the colony (in both cases) is approx-\nimately exponential at early times. Figures 20(b) and 20(d) show that at late times\nthe growth of the colonies can be described by an algebraic law. Our estimates of\nr and \u03b4, which give an indication of how fast the growth is, are smaller in the case of\nthe two-species colony due to competition (see the caption of Figure 20).\nThese results are in qualitative agreement with experimental [11] and simula-\ntion [21] results for avascular tumors. The off-lattice simulations reported in [21] are\ncarried out using a Monte Carlo method. In these simulations cell-to-cell (mechanical)\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 471\ninteractions are accounted for by a model potential energy. Cells are supposed to be\nperfect spheres at the beginning of the cell cycle and deform into a dumbbell shape\nas cells enter mitosis. This deformation modifies the total energy of the system, and\nthe neighboring cells respond by changing their position or orientation in order to\nminimize the total energy. Neither in the experiments nor in the simulations were\nnutrient levels and its spatial distribution taken into account. In these two papers\nalgebraic growth is reported for tumor cells growing in vitro. The exponents obtained\nin [11, 21] (\u03b4 \u223c 3) are different from the ones we obtain from our model. Better\nquantitative agreement is obtained with the results of the study presented in [35].\nIn [35] the authors analyzed the growth law of primary breast cancer from mammog-\nraphy screening data, obtaining an algebraic growth law, rather than a Gompertz-like\ngrowth as is usually assumed, with an exponent \u03b4 \u223c 0.5.\nSince both normal and cancer cells evolve in a qualitatively similar environment,\nand the rules for cell-to-cell interaction are the same in both cases, the reasons for\ntheir different temporal behavior must be found in the intracellular dynamics and, in\nparticular, their cell-cycle dynamics. From this point of view, there are two major\ndifferences between normal and cancer cells: cancer cells divide at a higher rate than\nnormal cells and cancer cells may become quiescent, whereas normal cells may not.\nHowever, for the situation shown in Figure 17(b), the proliferation rates of the normal\nand cancer cells are similar, as we can see from Figure 8. Therefore, the different\nbehavior of the cancer cells must be due to their ability to delay death by starvation\nby entering a quiescent state.\n9. Discussion. In this paper we have proposed a multiple scale model for vascu-\nlar tumor growth in which we have integrated phenomena at the tissue scale (vascular\nstructural, adaptation, and blood flow), cellular scale (cell-to-cell interaction), and\nthe intracellular scale (cell-cycle, VEGF production, and apoptosis). To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first example of such a model for tumor development.\nOur integrative approach allows us to analyze the effect on the population of\nchanges in the intracellular processes of its components. The results produced by\nour model are in agreement with clinical studies highlighting the p27 protein as a\nprognostic indicator. Furthermore, our model suggests that the p27 protein may be\nconsidered a therapeutic target. Guided by the results of section 7.2, we conclude\nthat p27 expression could be used to reduce the competitive advantage of the tumor\ncells over the normal cells. This could be achieved by altering the normal pattern of\nregulation of p27. However, in our model the dynamics of the p27 protein have been\nmodeled simply. A more accurate model would be required to test our hypothesis.\nAnother issue we have addressed is to which growth laws our model gives rise.\nWe have shown that the population of normal cells evolve according to a Gompertz\nlaw. This is an emergent property of our model: we have studied the evolution of a\ncolony of cells under given environmental conditions and internal division dynamics.\nWe have nowhere imposed that the death depends exponentially on the size of the\ncolony. On the other hand, we have shown that the Gompertz law fails to reproduce\nthe behavior of the cancer cells. Instead, the colonies of cancer cells go through three\ndifferent regimes: exponential growth, algebraic growth, and, finally, saturation. This\ndifference between the two populations is due to the ability of the cancer cells to\nenter a quiescent state before dying.10 Further mathematical analysis of populations\n10In fact, we have recently become aware of results obtained from continuous models which yield\nthe same behavior: normal cell growth fits the Gompertz law, whereas cancer cells (which are assumed\nto enter quiescence upon starvation) do not [67].\n472 T. ALARCO\u00b4N, H. M. BYRNE, AND P. K. MAINI\nundergoing quiescence before dying is needed to confirm this point.\nA weakness of our model is that the dynamics of p53 and intracellular VEGF\nare very simplistic. A more detailed model for their pattern of expression would be\nneeded in order to produce more reliable results. Also, for our model of the effect of\nhypoxia on the cell-cycle we have built up on a model originally proposed for yeast.\nThis model also needs further refinement.\nAnother area in which our model could be improved is angiogenesis. Although\nwe have included tissue-vasculature coupling, we have not introduced new vessel for-\nmation, although it might be argued that this is not so important in naturally well-\nvascularized tissues, for example the liver. Concerning our treatment of the vascula-\nture and blood flow, there are two points in which our model needs further refinement:\nthe use of the Poiseuille law for blood flow, which is not valid in very small capillaries,\nand the assumption that the vessels are rigid rather than compliant tubes. However,\nour model takes into account some properties of real vascular networks and blood\nflow that allow us to assess the effects of blood flow heterogeneity. This is particu-\nlarly important when trying to model drug delivery and evaluate treatment protocols\n(see [61] for a particular example).\nThere are, of course, many other factors that should be included in a more accu-\nrate description of the carcinogenic process. For example, we have assumed that can-\ncer cells do not migrate, whereas, in practice, cancer cells usually acquire a metastatic\nphenotype which enables them to migrate and metastasize to other tissues close to\nthe primary tumor. Another important factor that should be explored concerns in-\nteractions between the tumor and the immune system: in the early stages of tumor\ndevelopment, when cancer cells have not yet condensed to form a solid tumor, (in-\ndividual) malignant cells may be recognized by the immune system and removed [9].\nKnowledge of the mechanisms by which the immune response is activated by the pres-\nence of tumor cells and, especially, the reasons for the failure of immune surveillance\nare issues that might prove important in the development of new treatments.\nAnother (rather technical) shortcoming of our model concerns its application to a\nmore developed stage of tumor growth, where the tumor is likely to comprise millions\nof cells rather than thousands of cells, as has been considered in the present study.\nIn such a case we would need to resort to parallel computing techniques. Although\nthis certainly implies some degree of complication from the computational point of\nview, the present model should not be too difficult to implement in parallel, as the\nintracellular dynamics, which is the most time-consuming part, is completely local\n(the intracellular dynamics of different elements are only coupled \u201cindirectly\u201d by the\nglobal fields (oxygen, VEGF), with no direct interaction between them). A three-\ndimensional version of this model is another issue that would involve the use of more\nrefined numerical and computational techniques. The major problem would be solv-\ning the reaction-diffusion equations for the global fields (e.g., oxygen or VEGF) in\nthree dimensions. A possible solution might be to formulate these reaction-diffusion\nphenomena in terms of a lattice gas (as in [20]) and using parallel computing tech-\nniques.\nMany other issues, such as different boundary conditions for the diffusion of oxy-\ngen and VEGF and different boundary conditions for the vascular network, could\nhave been explored. However, in the present article our main aim was to develop our\nmodeling framework and present some examples of biologically and clinically relevant\nissues that can be addressed using this framework.\nMost of these limitations will be dealt with in future research.\nFinally, our model might also give some insight into the controversy surrounding\nMULTISCALE MODELING OF TUMOR GROWTH 473\nFolkman\u2019s model for tumor therapy: disrupting angiogenesis yields a starving tumor\nwhich eventually dies. In our model, disruption of angiogenesis (by the introduction\nof some VEGF-specific antibody), would eliminate the coupling between the growing\ntumor and the vasculature. This would not eliminate the tumor (see Figures 12(d),\n(e), and (f) and Figures 12(g), (h), and (i)), although it would reduce its size. This\nresult suggests that combination with other therapies will be necessary for a successful\ntreatment of vascular tumors.\nAcknowledgment.
