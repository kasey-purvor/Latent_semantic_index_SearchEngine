INTRODUCTION\nI T is well established that resonant converter-based suppliesare advantageous in-terms of size and efficiency [1], [2]\ncompared to hard-switched counterparts. One of the main\nimpediments to their use, however, is the lack of simple but\nrobust control techniques. This is primarily due to the highly\nnon-linear dynamic characteristics that are normally associ-\nated with such systems. A novel control strategy (based on a\nvariant of linearized phase-control) is therefore proposed that\napproximately linearizes the behavior of the converter such\nthat well-known control techniques can be readily applied.\nAlthough other methods have been previously reported [3], [4]\nthat aim to linearize the converter\u2019s behavior, the mechanism\npresented here provides a convenient and cohesive framework\nthat is widely applicable. To focus the development of the\nunderlying principles, an LCC current-output converter variant,\nshown in Fig. 1, is used as an example.\nThe proposed techniques therefore constitute an advance-\nment to commonly used phase-control methods, and maintains\nall the associated advantages over traditional frequency control\nmethods. In [5], it is shown that self-oscillating phase-control\nprovides self-tuning relative to the resonant tank frequency\n(advantageous in that the same phase-controller can be directly\nManuscript received August 24, 2007; revised February 6, 2008.

To obtain the overall\nsystem dynamics when using the presented control method-\nology, similar analysis techniques are employed to those used\nin [6] for the frequency control of resonant-converters.\nII. EQUIVALENCE OF POWER-FACTOR\nAND SUPPLY VOLTAGE CONTROL\nDuring normal operation, the resonant tank is excited above\nthe resonant frequency by an applied square-wave voltage,\n, that results in an approximately sinusoidal series inductor\ncurrent, , see Fig. 2(a). The fundamental component of the\nsquare-wave is also shown in Fig. 2(a), and can be sub-divided\ninto two components, one in phase with the resonant current,\n, and one in quadrature, Fig. 2(b).\nThe following identity can be used to derive the magnitude of\nthe switching voltage component that is in-phase with the series\ninductor current:\n(1)\nThe switching voltage can be approximated by its funda-\nmental component as follows:\n(2)\nwith the series inductor current assumed to be a sinusoid\n(3)\nwhere \u201c \u201d denates the peak value, and is used generically\nthroughout the following analysis.\nUsing (1) the fundamental component of the excitation\nvoltage can be expressed as\n(4)\nTo maintain the real power flow into the converter, assuming a\nsquare-wave switching voltage in-phase with the series inductor\ncurrent, the \u201cequivalent\u201d square-wave voltage is approximated\nto\n(5)\nwhere the electrical power-factor PF\n0885-8993\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\n1974 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 1. LCC current-output resonant converter.\nFig. 2. (a) Excitation voltage and resonant tank current and (b) phase compo-\nnents of switching voltage wrt. resonant tank current.\nIt can now be seen that varying the instantaneous power-\nfactor is equivalent to varying the instantaneous\nsupply-voltage, from a fundamental mode approximation\n(FMA) perspective. When deriving a small-signal model, this\nallows the converter to be considered as being excited at the\nresonant frequency while varying the power factor\u2014in this\ncase, power-factor can be included in the model as an effective\nsupply-voltage scaling factor, and therefore does not alter the\nstructure of the model.\nIII. PHASOR-TRANSFORM MODEL\nTo enable a small-signal model of the self-oscillating\npower-factor controlled converter to be derived, a large-signal\nphasor-transformed model is initially considered when operating\nthe converter about the resonant frequency. In a similar manner\nto the use of the \u2013 axis transformation when modelling and\nanalysing three-phasemachines, a \u201cphasor-transform\u201d technique\ncan be used for single-phase systems based on the assumption\nthat the signals are sinusoidal in nature but vary in amplitude,\nfrequencyandphase [7]\u2013[10].These featuresarecharacteristicof\nresonant converters operating near resonance with sufficiently\nhigh quality factor, as is commonly encountered.\nThe formulation is based upon the principle that a generic\nform of sine waveform (voltages or currents in this case) can\nbe approximated by a sinusoid whose frequency and amplitude\nvary with time [8], [9]\n(6)\nwhere is the complex envelope of and is the\nswitching frequency. Considering the differential equation\ngoverning the behavior of an ideal inductor\n(7)\nand substituting (6) into (7) for both current and voltage gives\nthe generic expression\n(8)\nSimplifying gives\n(9)\nIn a similar manner, capacitors and resistors are described by\n(10a)\n(10b)\nMore generally, therefore, a signal envelope can be ex-\npanded into its constituent real and imaginary components, de-\nnoted by \u201c \u201d and \u201c \u201d subscripts, respectively\n(11)\nGILBERT et al.: SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROL METHODS 1975\nFig. 3. FMA model of LCC resonant tank.\nFor the inductor, substituting (11) into (9) and separating the\nreal and imaginary terms gives\n(12a)\n(12b)\nand similarly for the capacitor and resistor\n(13a)\n(13b)\n(14a)\n(14b)\nThe rectifier in Fig. 1 is not readily modelled using the phasor-\ntransform technique, and requires the resonant tank and output\nfilter to be considered separately, and then combined. This is\njustified since the output filter bandwidth is much lower than that\nof the tank resonant frequency, and, as a result of the rectifier\naction, the filter effectively reacts only to the envelope of the\nresonant tank waveforms. From basic FMA, the resonant tank\nis therefore modelled as in Fig. 3 [2].\nFor use in network simulators (such as SPICE or SABER),\nthe complex components can be eliminated through use of two\ncoupled equivalent circuits, describing separately, the real and\nimaginary characteristics [10]. After phasor-transforming the\ncomponents in Fig. 3, the coupled networks shown in Fig. 4 are\nobtained.\nA state space representation of Fig. 4 is obtained for both\nthe real and imaginary circuits, which are then combined to\ngive (15)\n(15)\nFig. 4. Phasor transformed LCC resonant tank model: (a) real circuit and (b)\nimaginary circuit.\nFig. 5. Modelling output filter by a time varying load.\nand the waveform envelopes are extracted using the output\nequation\n(16)\nFinally, the output filter is described in state-variable form by\n(17)\nThe voltages of the phasor-transformed tank model and\noutput filter are coupled by noting that the average voltage\npresented to the output filter, via the rectifier, is given by (18),\nsince is assumed sinusoidal\n(18)\nCoupling of the currents is achieved by replacing the current\nsource in Fig. 3 by a time varying resistor, Fig. 5, with the imag-\ninary and real components of given by\n(19)\n1976 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nSince the transformer primary current is a squarewave, and\nthe fundamental is used in the phasor-transformed model, the\npeak of the squarewave current is scaled by 4 :\n(20)\nThe time-varying load resistance is now calculated from\n(21)\nFrom (19), (20) and (21) the transformer primary phasor cur-\nrents are found algebraically\n(22)\nThe complete model is therefore described by (15)\u2013(18) and\n(22).\nIV. SMALL-SIGNAL ANALYSIS\nA small-signal model of the converter, while under self-oscil-\nlating power-factor control, can be obtained by modifying (15)\n(the large signal phasor-transform model) such that power factor\nbecomes an input. In Section II it has been shown that varying\nthe power-factor is equivalent in terms of real power flow to lin-\nearly scaling the supply voltage while switching the converter\nat resonance, hence\n(23)\n[Note: When varying the power factor, the switching fre-\nquency naturally varies, and from an analysis perspective,\neither the supply voltage can be considered constant and the\nfrequency varied, or, as in the case presented here, the supply\nvoltage varied while the switching frequency remains constant]\nThe equations underpinning the phasor-transformed model\n(15)\u2013(18), (22) are linearized about the resonant frequency, and\n(18) is re-expressed as follows:\n(24)\nFor a generic variable , the steady-state and small-signal\ncomponents are separated as follows:\n(25)\nwhere and are the steady-state and small-signal compo-\nnents, respectively\u2014and (24) is re-written as\n(26)\nLinearizing about a steady-state operating point gives\n(27)\nThe transformer primary currents (22) are also modified ac-\ncordingly\n(28)\nand linearizing (28) about the steady-state operating point gives\n(29a)\n(29b)\nTo develop the small-signal model, expressions for the\nsteady-state components , and need to be\nderived. Using (24), the steady-state output inductor current is\nsimply written\n(30)\nwith the transformer primary current components, from (22) and\n(30), becoming\n(31)\nGILBERT et al.: SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROL METHODS 1977\nSteady-state conditions are obtained by equating the time\nderivatives in (23) to zero. Equation (31) is used to replace the\ncomponents, thereby giving\n(32a)\n(32b)\n(32c)\n(32d)\n(32e)\n(32f)\nAs previously shown, the power factor, in steady-state, does\nnot alter the small-signal analysis. Consequently, it can be as-\nsumed that 1 (i.e., operation at resonance) to simplify\nthe analysis. At resonance, therefore, 0, since all the\nseries-inductor current is real. From (32e) this also implies that\n0. Substituting 0 and 0 into (32a)\nallows for the calculation of\n(33)\nFrom the account given in [11], design equations for the LCC\ncurrent-output resonant converter, based on FMA, can be uti-\nlized to simplify the analysis. Specifically, in [11], it is shown\nthat, at resonance, the output voltage of the converter is given\nby:\n(34)\nwhere is the voltage gain of the resonant tank and is\ntransformer turns ratio (when expressed as ), and the\nsteady-state output-filter current is given by\n(35)\nEquating (30) and (35), eliminating via use of (33), and\nsolving for then gives\n(36)\nNote that two solutions exist for (36), having opposing\npolarities. The solution presented in (36) is selected\nsuch that the phase of w.r.t , is negative, i.e.,\n0. In [11] it is also shown that,\nfrom a given converter specification, the resonant tank compo-\nnents can be chosen as follows:\n(37a)\n(37b)\n(37c)\nwhere , and is the resonant frequency.\nThese equations will be used to simplify the remaining anal-\nysis. Substituting (33) and (36), into (32c), and eliminating\nin (32c) via (37a) gives\n(38)\nEliminating in (32b) via (37b), substituting in (38) and\nsolving for then gives\n(39)\nSince the steady-state conditions are all now known (at PF\n1) the small-signal equations expressed in (27), (29) can be\ndetermined\n(40)\n(41a)\n(41b)\nThe resulting state-space small-signal model can now be\nwritten from (17), (23), (40) and (41) giving (42), shown at the\nbottom of the next page.\nTo use the model, (42), the converter tank gain and resonant\nfrequency must be determined.

REALIZATION OF SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROLLER\nA key factor to provide good self-oscillating control of the\npower factor is determining when changes of polarity of the se-\nries-inductor current occur\u2014for simplicity, the series-inductor\nvoltage is measured, integrated (through use of low-pass filter\nwith relatively low break frequency), and fed into low-offset\ncomparator with an appropriate reference. The time-constant of\nthe low-pass filter is chosen such that at the lowest switching\nfrequency, the phase shift, , is approximately and that\nthe filter gain is sufficiently small such that the voltage ap-\nplied across the comparator is within specification at all times\n(43)\n1978 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 6. FPGA delay methodology.\nHaving obtained the current polarity, an FPGA is used to\ngenerate the required switching signals based on the demanded\npower-factor. Fig. 6 shows the required functionality of the\nFPGA delay mechanism. A background process on the FPGA\nmeasures the period of the current waveform. At time\na rising edge on sgn is detected, and, after a delay time\n, at , the FPGA forces a falling-edge on the switching\nvoltage.\nUsing the methodology outlined above, the FPGA ensures\nthe phase-shift is as desired on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The re-\nsulting large-signal model approximation relating power-factor\nto output-voltage is described in (42).\nDelaying the \u201cedges\u201d in the proposed manner reduces the de-\nlays necessary by the FPGA and, secondly, ensures that the duty\ncycle of the current-waveform is maintained.\nFig. 7. FPGA based power-factor controller: (a) block diagram and (b) proto-\ntype controller.\nThe required delay-time is calculated from the power-\nfactor and the period as follows:\n(44)\nTo ensure self-oscillation start-up, when no series-inductor\ncurrent sign change is detected within 100 s, the FPGA\nswitches the converter at a fixed 500 kHz. For the prototype\npresented in Section VI, this start-up strategy results in the\n(42)\nGILBERT et al.: SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROL METHODS 1979\nFig. 8. Steady-state output voltage across various loads when using (a) phase-angle control and (b) power-factor control.\nconverter being switched at 500 kHz for approximately 10 s\nbefore the series-inductor current is sufficient to start self-os-\ncillation. The technique additionally results in reduced inrush\ncurrents.\nAn overview of the power factor controller, and photo of the\nFPGA with interface board, is provided in Fig. 7.\nThe delay-reduce feature provides compensation for any\npropagation delay in current sensing, processing, and gate\ndriving. It should be noted that from a commercial perspective,\na fully embedded closed-loop output-regulation control strategy\nsuitable for low-cost and robust resonant-converter control,\nwould be implemented on a low cost ASIC.\nVI. STEADY-STATE BEHAVIOR OF THE\nPOWER-FACTOR CONTROLLER\nFor a 1-A current-source when switched at the resonant fre-\nquency [12] with converter parameters specified by: 18,\n13.6 H, 220 nF, 130 nF, 1,\n24 H, 220 F, Fig. 8 provides a comparison between\nexperimental measurements of steady-state output voltage for\nboth the proposed self-oscillating power-factor control method-\nology and the more traditional self-oscillating phase-angle con-\ntrol methodology, as the load is varied from 10 to 20 in 2\nincrements.\nFrom Fig. 8 it can clearly be seen that, at steady-state, the\npower-factor control methodology provides an almost linear\ncontrol to output relationship, compared to the more traditional\nphase-angle controller characteristic.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THE SMALL\nSIGNAL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY\nFig. 9 shows experimental measurements of the small-signal\nfrequency response of the converter along with those from the\nproposed analysis (42). The power factor is perturbed around\n0.75 ( 157 kHz, 161 kHz with 10 ,\n20 , respectively) through use of the self-oscillating\npower-factor controller considered previously. In order to ap-\npropriately consider the results a note about scaling is in order.\nWhen 10 , the converter gain at resonance is 0.674,\nhence, with the specified input voltage, 12.1 V, implying\na steady-state gain of 21.7 dB at 0 Hz between PF and .\nSimilarly when , the converter gain at resonance is\n1.26, hence, with the specified input voltage, 22.7 V,\ngiving a steady-state gain of 27.1 dB at 0 Hz between PF\nand . It can be seen that, in general, very good agreement\nbetween the results is seen to exist. Moreover, from Fig. 10 it\ncan be seen that both the simulated and experimental output\nvoltage dynamics closely follow a scaled version of the input\npower factor, thereby further demonstrating the controller\u2019s\nlinear behavior, and, although the underlying state-variable\nmodel is eighth-order, the system is dominantly third-order.\nFurthermore, since the small-signal response is found to be\nconstant across the full steady-state power-factor range, the\nsmall-signal response can also be considered to provide a good\napproximation of the large-signal behavior.\nThe model is shown to be experimentally validated up to\n2 kHz, which is more than sufficient for the robust design of\nan outer output-voltage\/current regulation controller. Typically,\nthe output-regulation control bandwidth for resonant converters\nis designed to be smaller than that of the converter output-filter\n(3.4 kHz in the prototype converter), which, by necessity, has a\nmuch lower bandwidth than the switching frequency. Neverthe-\nless, for completeness, results from detailed time-domain non-\nlinear circuit simulations are also included at higher frequencies\nto further show the validity of the model.\nVIII. SUPPLY-VOLTAGE DISTURBANCE REJECTION\nTo demonstrate the supply voltage disturbance rejection prop-\nerties, the converter (detailed in Section VII) is initially excited\nsuch that the power factor is controlled to be PF 0.8. Then, in-\ntermittently, the product PF is controlled to be maintained at\nPF 14.2 through use of feed-forward action. With a con-\nstant dc supply voltage of 18 V both strategies provide\n9 V output when applied across a 10 load. Fig. 11 shows\nthe ability of the latter method to provide improved regulation\ncharacteristics when 18 2 2 100 -the choice of\n1980 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 9. Small-signal frequency response comparison between proposed analysis and experimental results for 10 \n load (a\u2013b) and 20 \n load (c\u2013d).\nFig. 10. Comparison between experimental and small-signal model response\nfor R = 10 \n during a perturbed step change in power factor from PF =\n0.8 to 0.3. Note that a third-order numerically reduced model is utilized for\nthe small-signal response. The power factor is scaled by 12.1 V since when\nthe power-factor is unity the theoretical ideal output-voltage of the converter is\n12.1 V.\n100 Hz disturbance reflects the use of a full-bridge mains recti-\nfier at the input to the converter, since the effects of higher fre-\nquency perturbations are attenuated due to the presence of the\noutput filter and tank. In particular, it can be seen that during\nconstant power-factor operation, the peak-peak output voltage\nripple (1.66 V) is much larger than that obtained when utilizing\nfeed-forward control action (0.26 V), thereby demonstrating the\npotential for improving regulation performance (see Fig. 12).\nIX. CLOSED-LOOP OUTPUT VOLTAGE REGULATION\nWhen power factor control is combined with the described\nfeed-forward action (giving the equivalence of input voltage\ncontrol) the approximate large-signal model (42) requires minor\nmodification. Specifically, the supply voltage in (42) is removed\nfrom the matrix and included in the input , giving\n(45)\nGILBERT et al.: SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROL METHODS 1981\nFig. 11. Supply-voltage rejection with and without feed-forward action.\nFig. 12. Closed loop output voltage regulation with additional feed forward\ncontrol.\nTABLE I\nCONTROLLER GAINS AND ASSOCIATED 100-\n LOAD GAIN\/PHASE MARGINS\nFor output voltage control, the overall system will take a form\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 12.\nFor stability, the loop-gain must never exceed unity magni-\ntude when the phase shift crosses , for all possible load\nconditions. The loop-gain is found from\n(46)\nwhere is the third-order reduced model of the converter\nand is the controller model. The converter is to regulate\nthe output voltage across a load ranging from 10\u2019s to 100 .\nFor robustness, the controller gains are selected such that the\nconverter remains stable with a phase margin , with an\napplied load of 100 .\nImplementing the control gains in Table I on the prototype\nconverter, and stepping the load between 10 and 20 , at\n20 Hz, with an electronic load, while regulating the output-\nvoltage at 9 V gives the responses presented in Figs. 13 and 14,\nfor the two cases, respectively.\nFig. 13. Closed loop output-voltage regulation waveforms (a) K = 2K =\n1 \u0002 10 and (b) K = 2 K = 10 \u0002 10 .\nFig. 14. Closed loop output-voltage regulation waveforms (a)K = 10K =\n1\u0002 10 and (b) K = 10 K = 10 \u0002 10 .\nIt can be seen that the output-voltage regulation is being ob-\ntained in each case in response to a relatively aggressive dis-\nturbance stimuli. The converter can also be operated as a con-\nstant current-source by feeding back a measurement of output\ncurrent instead of the output voltage. By way of example, for a\ndemand current of 0.75 A, the resulting closed loop responses\nshown in Fig. 15 are obtained. Controller gains of 15\n1982 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 15. Closed loop output current control (a)K = 15K = 2.5\u0002 10 and\n(b) K = 1 K = 2.5 \u0002 10 .\n2.5 10 and 1 2.5 10 are used, respec-\ntively, in Fig. 15(a) and (b). Again, it can be seen that regulation\nis clearly evident in response to the aggressive stimuli. However,\nnotably, significant overshoot is present. This is a common fea-\nture of such systems and is a consequence of the power flow\nto the output filter being unidirectional\u2014the controller does not\nhave the capability to remove stored energy, and relies on the\nload depleting the charge on the filter capacitor.\nX. ALTERNATIVE SWITCHING TECHNIQUES\nTwo alternative switching techniques are shown in Fig. 16,\neach having the advantage that a switching event occurs on\na zero-current crossing point, thereby facilitating reduced\nswitching losses. When employing the fixed falling-edge\nmethod, shown in Fig. 16(a), the magnitude of the fundamental\nof the voltage, normalized to that for a duty-cycle of 50% is\n(47)\nwhere is the phase-angle between the rising-edge of the\nswitching voltage and the rising zero-crossing of the sinusoidal\ncurrent. (i.e., when 0 and , the switching-waveform\nis, respectively, square wave and dc). The fundamental of the\nswitching-voltage is, in general, out of phase with the sinu-\nsoidal current. The fraction of switching voltage fundamental\ncomponent that can be considered as being in-phase with the\ncurrent-waveform, is\n(48)\nFig. 16.

Closed loop output voltage regulation: (a) 10\n load and (b) 50\n load.\nThe reference voltage is stepped between 8 V and 10 V at 100 Hz.\nThe overall switching-voltage component that is in-phase\nwith the sinusoidal current-waveform, normalized to the condi-\ntion when the converter is switched with a 50% duty cycle, at\nresonance, is\n(49)\nFig. 20. Closed loop output voltage regulation (a) 10-\n load and (b) 50-\n load.\nThe reference voltage is stepped between 8 and 10 V at 100 Hz with a 1-kHz\n0.5-V amplitude perturbation.\nThe time is therefore calculated as follows:\n(50)\nFrom Fig. 16 it can be seen that the current waveforms are\nasymmetric about the positive and negative half-cycles, and are\ntherefore not sinusoidal, which was an underlying assumption\nfor the analysis. Simulation studies have shown that, generally,\n(50) does not provide a sufficiently accurate linearization mech-\nanism for the falling-edge switching strategy, similarly when an\nequivalent methodology is applied to the rising-edge technique,\nthe resulting behavior is found to be alike.\nThe fixed rising-edge strategy is therefore tested without the\nuse of any linearization equation, thereby eliminating the need\nfor a lookup table within the FPGA, and the delay time is\ngiven simply by\n(51)\ni.e when 1, the delay time is a half-period, giving a\nsquare-wave switching voltage in phase with the current wave-\nform. When 0, no switching occurs and the input voltage is\n1984 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 21.

Fig. 16 provides a comparison of the converter\noutput voltage for various loads, as the control input is varied,\nduring power-factor and fixed rising-edge control.\nFrom Fig. 17 it can be seen that the fixed-edge methodology\nprovides approximately linear behavior. The large-signal model\nfor power-factor self-oscillating control, approximated by the\nsmall-signal model presented in Section IV, may therefore be\nconsidered to provide a reasonable large-signal model for the\nfixed rising-edge control scheme.\nFig. 18 compares the converter output-voltage and con-\ntrol-input for both power-factor control and fixed-edge control.\nBoth methods result in similar control signal to output-voltage\ncharacteristics, and, for control purposes the power-factor\nlarge-signal model may be sufficient.\nGILBERT et al.: SELF-OSCILLATING CONTROL METHODS 1985\nFig. 22. Efficiency comparison between power-factor and fixed rising-edge (no\nlookup table) control when output current is regulated at 1 A across a wide load\nrange.\nClosing the loop with and 1 10 , and\ncomparing the converter output voltage for both methodologies\nas the output-voltage reference is varied gives the transient re-\nsponses shown in Fig. 19.\nComparing Fig. 19(a) with Fig. 19(b) it can be seen that the\noutput-voltage fall-time, for the case of the 50 load, is much\nslower than that applied across the 10- load, demonstrating\nthe load dependent control dynamics discussed previously. Con-\nversely, the output-voltage rise-time for the 50- load case is\nmuch faster. This is a consequence of the controller demanding\na transiently higher voltage than the desired 10 V, with the con-\nverter capable of developing approximately 50 V at resonance\nwith a 50- load in this case.\nA similar effect can be seen in Fig. 20(a). The demand and\noutput-voltages are very similar when the demand is less than\n9 V, and less so when higher voltages are demanded.\nOf note, is the use of the \u2018fixed rising-edge methodology\u2019\nprovides the qualities of a much smaller RMS series-inductor\ncurrent, and a reduced switching bandwidth\u2014both of which act\nto improve efficiency. This is demonstrated in Fig. 21 where\nthe RMS series-inductor current and switching frequency, are\nshown for both control methodologies [Note: the term \u201cSquare-\nwave\u201d in Figs. 21 and 22 is used to represent any control tech-\nnique providing a square-wave excitation voltage to the\ninput of the resonant tank (as in the case of power-factor con-\ntrol, or the traditional variable frequency control)].\nWhen regulating the output-current at 0.5 A, into a load\nvarying between 50 , the switching bandwidth\nrequired for \u2018square-wave\u2019 excitation-voltage techniques is\n170 kHz 190 kHz, a substantially greater range than the\n156 kHz 160 kHz required when utilizing the \u201cfixed-edge\u201d\ntechnique.\nFig. 22 compares the prototype\u2019s (without synchronous rec-\ntification) closed-loop converter efficiency as the output current\nis regulated at 1 A over a range of applied loads, utilizing both\nthe power-factor (\u201csquare wave\u201d) and fixed rising-edge control\nmethodologies. From the results it can be seen that utilization of\nthe \u201cfixed edge\u201d scheme provides a higher efficiency solution\nas a consequence of switching events occurring at a zero-cur-\nrent crossing, reduced RMS series-inductor current (as a result\nof the reduced excitation waveform duty-cycle), and switching\nclose to resonance across the entire output-voltage range (since\nthe system is forced to commutate in phase with the resonant\ncurrent).\nXI. CONCLUSION\nA control strategy is provided for the LCC current-output\nresonant converter that is ultimately, more widely applicable\nto other resonant converter topologies. The methodology is\nadvantageous in that it initially linearizes the steady-state\ninput-to-output conversion ratio and, secondly, the large-signal\nconverter dynamics become predominantly third-order. At\npresent, no other reported control methodologies exhibit such\nsimple linear behavior. Through the well-defined behavior of\nthe power-factor controlled converter, the design of an addi-\ntional controller to obtain closed-loop output-voltage\/current\nregulation is greatly simplified, allowing robust and\/or well\ndocumented adaptive control methods to be applied. This,\ntherefore, addresses one of the main drawbacks for the use of\nresonant converters viz. the lack of literature on robust control\nof such systems. A further switching scheme is also proposed\nwith reduced switching bandwidth, RMS series-inductor cur-\nrent, and approximately similar large signal dynamics to that of\na power-factor controller converter.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
