INTRODUCTION\nANUMBER of approaches have been developed in the pastfor the design of control strategies for motorway networks\nthat involve control measures such as route recommendation\nwith the use of variable message signs (VMS) or equipped ve-\nhicles, ramp metering, motorway-to-motorway (mtm) control,\netc. In this paper, the optimal control approach (discrete-time\nformulation) is applied to the design of large-scale optimal co-\nordinated ramp metering control strategies.\nEarly applications of nonlinear constrained optimal con-\ntrol to coordinated ramp metering were reported in [1], [2],\nand [3]. In [4] and [5], a similar approach was applied to\nthe Boulevard Peripherique in Paris. In [6]\u2013[8] and [9], the\nproblem of ramp metering as an optimal control problem was\nconsidered. In [10] and [11], results related to the integrated\ncontrol of motorway networks, considering both route recom-\nmendation and ramp metering, were reported for a hypothetical\nnetwork based on the approach described in this paper and\nthe control software tool advanced motorway optimal control\n(AMOC). AMOC determines optimal control trajectories for\nManuscript received January 14, 2003; revised October 14, 2003. Manuscript\nreceived in final form March 16, 2004.

AMOC considers\nall the available control measures simultaneously so as to\nmaximize their synergistic effect thereby avoiding conflicting\ncontrol actions. Results for coordinated ramp metering based\non AMOC are reported in [12]. A control strategy based on an\noptimal control problem formulation integrating ramp metering\nand variable speed limits was reported in [13]. For a more\ndetailed and systematic overview of ramp metering control\nstrategies see [14].\nThis paper first provides a thorough description of the op-\ntimal control approach to coordinated ramp metering along with\na suitable numerical solution algorithm. Based on application of\nthe proposed methodology to the Amsterdam ring road, previ-\nously obtained results are enhanced and extended with regard\nto the computational efficiency, which is a prerequisite for the\nreal-time application of the method, as well as with regard to the\noperational performance (efficiency versus equity) and related\ntradeoffs. Both issues (computational effort and operational per-\nformance) are of major importance for the practical deployment\nof the proposed methodology.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II\nbriefly presents the macroscopic traffic flow model which\nis used for the design of the control strategy. Section III\nformulates the problem of coordinated ramp metering as a\nconstrained nonlinear discrete-time optimal control problem.\nSection IV presents the numerical solution algorithm for the\nformulated problem. Section V presents the application results\nfor the Amsterdam ring road. The main conclusions and future\nwork are reported in Section VI.\nII. MACROSCOPIC TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL\nA validated second-order traffic flow model is used for the\ndescription of traffic flow on motorway networks to provide the\nmodeling part of the optimal control problem formulation. Since\ntraffic assignment (routing) aspects of the traffic process are not\nnecessary when the only type of control measure applied is ramp\nmetering, the traffic assignment modeling part will not be pre-\nsented (see [15], for details).\nThe network is represented by a directed graph whereby the\nlinks of the graph represent motorway stretches. Each motorway\nstretch has uniform characteristics, i.e., no on-\/off-ramps and no\nmajor changes in geometry. The nodes of the graph are placed\nat locations where a major change in road geometry occurs, as\nwell as at junctions, on-ramps, and off-ramps.\nThe time and space arguments are discretised. The dis-\ncrete-time step is denoted by (typically \u2013 s). A\n1063-6536\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 921\nFig. 1. Origin-link queue model.\nmotorway link is divided into segments of equal-length\n(typically m). In principle, such a link may be\ndivided into unequal segments as long as the stability condition\nholds, where is the free-flow speed\nof link corresponding to the speed at close to zero-density\ntraffic conditions. This condition ensures that no vehicle\ntravelling with its free speed will pass through a segment\nduring one simulation time step. However, an uneven spatial\ndiscretization scheme does not provide any advantage over\nthe equal length division. It is for our convenience that we use\nequal segment lengths for each motorway link. Each segment\nof link at time , is macroscopically\ncharacterized via the following variables: The traffic density\n(veh\/lane-km) is the number of vehicles in segment\nof link at time divided by and by the number of\nlanes ; the mean speed (km\/h) is the mean speed\nof the vehicles included in segment of link at time ;\nand the traffic volume or flow (veh\/h) is the number of\nvehicles leaving segment of link during the time period\n, divided by . For each segment of link at\neach time step we have the following:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nwhere denotes the critical density per lane of link (the\ndensity where the maximum flow in the link occurs), and is a\nparameter of the fundamental diagram (4) of link ; the funda-\nmental diagram expresses a nonlinear relationship between the\nmean speed and the traffic density in link which is needed in\nthe second term of the right-hand side of (3). Furthermore, ,\na time constant, , an anticipation constant, and , are constant\nparameters, which are equal for all network links. This is due\nto the fact that the traffic model has relatively low sensitivity\nto these parameters, see [16] and [17]. Additionally, the mean\nspeed resulting from (3) is limited from below by the minimum\nspeed in the network in order to avoid unrealistically low\nflows during congestion.\nTwo additional terms are added to (3) in order to consider the\nspeed decrease caused by merging phenomena at a junction and\nby lanes drops, respectively, see [16] for details.\nFor origin links, i.e., links that receive traffic demand and for-\nward it into the motorway network, a simple queue model is\nused (Fig. 1). The outflow of an origin link depends on\nthe traffic conditions of the corresponding mainstream segment\nand the existence of ramp metering control measures.\nIf ramp metering is applied, then the outflow that is al-\nlowed to leave origin during period , is a portion of the\nmaximum outflow that would leave and enter the main-\nstream in absence of ramp metering. Thus,\nis the metering rate for the origin link , i.e., a control vari-\nable, where is a minimum admissible value; typically,\nis chosen so as to avoid ramp closure. If ,\nno ramp metering is applied, else . The queueing\nmodel is described by the following:\n(5)\nwhere is the queue length (veh) in origin at time ,\nand is the demand (veh\/h) at at the same period. The\noutflow is determined as follows:\n(6)\nwith\n(7)\nand\n(8)\n(9)\nwhere is the on-ramp\u2019s capacity (veh\/h), i.e., the on-ramp\u2019s\nmaximum possible outflow under free-flow traffic conditions in\nthe mainstream; and (veh\/lane-km) is the maximum den-\nsity in the network segments. Thus, the maximum outflow\nis determined by the current origin demand if [see\n(7), (8)], or by the geometrical ramp capacity if the main-\nstream density is undercritical, i.e., [see (9)], or\nby the reduced capacity due to congestion of the mainstream, if\n[see (9)]. Thus, (9) models the reduction of the\norigin link\u2019s capacity due to mainstream congestion (Fig. 2).\n922 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\nFig. 2. Reduction of origin link capacity due to mainstream congestion.\nA model similar to (5)\u2013(9) applies to motorway-to-motorway\ninterchanges.\nMotorway bifurcations and junctions (including on-ramps\nand off-ramps) are represented by nodes.

When a node has more\nthan one entering links, then the downstream influence of speed\nis taken into account by appropriately calculating required\nin (3) for . For more details see [15].\nIt should be noted here that the investigations reported in\nthis paper were based on turning rate information instead of\nOD information. Since it is very rare for neighboring on-ramps\nto have significantly different OD rates, something that would\nseriously affect the controller\u2019s performance, the use of turning\nrates instead does not pose any problem. AMOC can deal with\nOD information (see also [10] and [11]) but at the expense\nof the required computation effort due to the more detailed\ndescription of the traffic process, see also [15].\nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nThe coordinated ramp metering control problem is formu-\nlated as a dynamic optimal control problem with constrained\ncontrol variables which can be solved numerically over a given\ntime horizon. The motorway traffic flow is considered as a\nprocess under control via the various ramp meters installed at\nthe network entrances. The state of the process is described\nby the state vector and its evolution depends on the\nsystem dynamics and the input variables. The input variables\nare distinguished into control variables and the\nuncontrollable external disturbances . In the following,\nwe will introduce a general problem formulation whereby the\nvalue of each control measure may change less frequently than\nat each model sample time . Assume that the different\ncontrol measures have distinct control sample times which\nare assumed to be multiples of the model sample time , i.e.,\n. Let\nand let denote the number of control\nmeasures that have sample time and are organized in the\nvector . Then . The general\ndiscrete-time formulation of the optimal control problem reads\nMinimize\n(12)\nsubject to\n(13)\nand (14)\nwhere is the considered time horizon, and are arbitrary,\ntwice differentiable, nonlinear cost functions.\nBased on the previous section, it may be seen that by\nsubstituting (2), (10), and (11) into (1); (4) into (3); and (6)\u2013(9)\ninto (15), the traffic flow model equations take the form of\n(13). In this case, the state vector consists of the densities\n, the mean speeds of every segment of every link\n, and the queues of every origin . The control vector\nconsists of the ramp metering rates of every on-ramp\nunder control, with according to (14).\nWe assume here that all ramp meters have the same sample\ntime . Finally, the disturbance vector consists of\nthe demands at every origin of the network, and all the\nturning rates at the network\u2019s bifurcations. The disturbance\ntrajectories are assumed known over the time horizon .\nFor practical applications, these values may be predicted with\nsufficient accuracy based on historical data and, if necessary,\non real-time estimations, see, for example, [18].\nThe chosen cost criterion aims at minimizing the total time\nspent (TTS) of all vehicles in the network (including the waiting\ntime experienced inside the network queues). It can be proved\nthat the minimization of the TTS is equivalent to the maximiza-\ntion of the time weighted network outflow, see [3] and [14]. The\nminimization of the TTS is a natural objective for the traffic sys-\ntems considered here, since it represents the total time that all\nusers spent in the network. Furthermore, there is a widespread\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 923\nuse of the TTS as an evaluation criterion of control strategies\nthat do not explicitely aim at its minimization, such as feedback\nstrategies. More precisely, the cost criterion is as follows:\n(15)\nwith\n(16)\nwhere are weighting factors. The first two terms of (15)\ncorrespond exactly to the TTS. The term with weight is in-\ncluded in the cost criterion to suppress high-frequency oscilla-\ntions of the control trajectories. The last penalty term is included\nin the cost criterion in order to enable the control strategy to limit\nthe queue lengths at the origins if and to the level desired. The\nparameters are predetermined constants that express the\nmaximum permissible number of vehicles at any time period\nin origin \u2019s queue. The weights and were adjusted via\ntrial-and-error striking a balance between acceptable time-vari-\nations in the optimal control trajectories and queue constraint\nviolations on one hand and efficiency and fast convergence to\nthe optimum on the other.\nIV. NUMERICAL SOLUTION ALGORITHM\nDefine the quantities\nif mod\ninteger otherwise\n(17)\nFor a given admissible trajectory , the\nstate trajectory can be found by solving (13) starting\nwith the known initial state and, hence, the cost criterion\ncan be regarded as depending on the control variables only, i.e.,\n. The gradient of with respect to on the\nequality constraints surface for the time period is given by\n(18)\nwhere the costate vector satisfies\n(19)\nand\n(20)\nA projected gradient is defined to have its components\nequal to if none of the corresponding bounds\n(14) is active, and else. Furthermore we define a\nsaturation vector function with components\nif\nif\nelse\nwhere and are the upper and lower bounds, respec-\ntively, of the variable .\nThe necessary conditions of optimality are given by (13),\n(14), (19), (20), and . A well known so-\nlution algorithm based on feasible directions can be described\nas follows:\nStep 1) select an admissible initial control trajectory\n; set the iteration index\n;\nStep 2) using , solve (13) from\nknown initial condition to obtain ;\nusing and solve (19) from ter-\nminal condition (20) to obtain ;\nStep 3) using , and\n, calculate the gradients and\n;\nStep 4) specify a search direction (see below);\nStep 5) apply an one-dimensional search routine along the\n-direction to obtain a new, improved admissible\ncontrol trajectory , i.e.,\nwhere is the scalar step length, and\nStep 6) if, for a given scalar , the condition\nis satisfied, stop; otherwise set\nand go back to Step 2.\nSeveral techniques for specifying a search direction in\nStep 4 of the algorithm can be applied, including steepest de-\nscent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric, see [19] and [20].\nWhichever of these seach methods is used, a periodic restart of\nthe search algorithm takes place, i.e., after a certain number of it-\nerations, the search direction is set equal to the steepest-descent\ndirection so as to accelerate the algorithm\u2019s speed of conver-\ngence to a minimum. For more details on the overall numerical\nsolution algorithm, see [21] and [20].\nAs an alternative solution algorithm, Step 4 may be omitted\nwhile Step 5 may be replaced by the derivative backpropagation\nmethod RPROP (resilient backPROPagation) proposed in [22]\nfor neural network training. RPROP does not require the line-\nsearch routine used in the above algorithm, since it calculates\nthe necessary changes of the control variables at each iteration\nbased only on the signs of the gradient components . To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the RPROP\nmethod is used for large-scale nonlinear optimization.\n924 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\nWhen the RPROP method is used (slightly modified as com-\npared to its original form in [22]), Steps 4 and 5 of the above\nalgorithm are replaced by the following calculations:\nwhere the control variable increments are calculated\nbased on the sign of the gradient and the increment\nof the previous iteration, as shown in the equation\nat the bottom of the page, where . Thus,\nif no change of sign of occured between iterations\nand , the corresponding increment is increased\nas compared to by a factor (typically\n). If a sign change of occured, then the algorithm has\nstepped over a minimum in the corresponding direction, hence,\nthe new increment is opposite in sign and reduced in\nsize (typically ) as compared to . The al-\ngorithm starts with ; the calculated at\neach iteration may be restricted to lie in a prespecified interval\n.\nThe RPROP method preserves feasibility of the overall algo-\nrithm but cannot guarantee a decrease of the objective function\nvalue at each iteration.\nThe previously described numerical optimization algorithm\ndoes not guarantee convergence to a global minimum. Previous\nexperiences, indicate that a physically satisfactory minimum is\nalways achieved. In some cases, when the algorithm was started\nwith different initial control trajectories, convergence to dif-\nferent local minima occurred. The corresponding difference in\nthe cost criterion\u2019s value, however, was insignificant.\nV. APPLICATION EXAMPLE\nA. Site Description\nThe previously described approach to network-wide optimal\nramp metering has been applied to the Amsterdam ring road\nwith the use of AMOC.\nThe Amsterdam orbital motorway (A10) is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe A10 simultaneously serves local, regional, and inter-re-\ngional traffic and acts as a hub for traffic entering and exiting\nNorth Holland. There are four main connections with other mo-\ntorways, the A8 at the north, the A4 at the southwest, the A2 at\nthe south, and the A1 at the southeast. The A10 contains two tun-\nnels, the Coen Tunnel at the northwest and the Zeeburg Tunnel\nat the east.\nFor the purposes of our study, only the counterclockwise di-\nrection of the A10, which is about 32 km long, is considered.\nThere are 21 on-ramps on this motorway, including the connec-\ntions with the A8, A4, A2, and A1 motorways, and 20 off-ramps,\nincluding the junctions with A4, A2, A1, and A8. The topolog-\nical network model may be seen in Fig. 4. It is assumed that\nramp metering may be performed at each of the on-ramps.\nThe model parameters for this network were determined\nfrom validation of the network traffic flow model against real\nFig. 3. Amsterdam ring road.\nFig. 4. Amsterdam ring road model.\ndata taken from the motorways. The validation was conducted\nin two phases. The first phase was the quantitative validation\nwhere several motorway stretches from the ring road were se-\nlected and a rigorous optimization-based validation procedure\nwas carried out for each of them estimating the model parame-\nters , and , and for every\nlink . The second phase of the validation involved the manual\ntuning of other parameters, such as certain turning rates, that\nenabled the model to capture the network-wide dynamics. In\nfact, the network considered here is only a part of the whole\nnetwork considered in [23] and [24] where the detailed results\nof the modeling and validation of the Amsterdam network are\nreported.\nThe ring road was divided in 76 segments with average length\n421 m. This means that the state vector is 173-dimensional (in-\ncluding the 21 on-ramp queues). If ramp metering is applied to\nall on-ramps, the control vector is 21-dimensional, while the dis-\nturbance vector is 41-dimensional. With a time step s\nwe have, for a horizon of 4 h, . This means that for\na control sample time of 1 min and all on-ramps metered, there\nare 254, 160 variables included in the resulting nonlinear opti-\nmization problem.\nif\nelse\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 925\nFig. 5.

Scenario 0 corresponds to the\nno-control case, i.e., when no ramp metering control measures\nare applied. During the four hour period in this scenario, which\ncorresponds to the evening rush hours, the whole spectrum of\ntraffic conditions (free, critical, and congested) appears on the\nring road. Starting from initially uncongested conditions, the\nbuild up of congestion inside the motorway and the build up\nof queues at the network\u2019s on-ramps may be observed, and we\ncan follow their evolution until they are resolved. This way, the\nno-control case provides a sound base-case, based on which the\ncontrol strategy performance is evaluated under different sce-\nnarios. In Scenario 1, the maximum permissible storage\nin (16) is set to 40 vehicles for the urban on-ramps and 100 vehi-\ncles for the motorway-to-motorway ramps; in Scenario 2 these\nstorage capacities are equal to 80 and 120 vehicles, respectively,\nwhile in Scenario 3 no maximum queue constraints are consid-\nered, i.e., in (15).\nB. Optimal Results\nWhen no control measures are applied, the excessive demand\ncoupled with the uncontrolled entrance of drivers in the main-\nstream causes congestion from the beginning of the time horizon\n[Fig. 5(a)]. This congestion originates at the junction of A2 with\nA10 and propagates upstream blocking the A4 and a large part\nof the A10-West. By the time this congestion begins to dissolve,\na new one appears at the junction of A10 with A1 which be-\ngins to propagate upstream until it reaches the first congestion\nwhose trend of resolving is reversed and both are united into a\nsingle more severe congestion. This strong congestion keeps the\nA4 entrance to the A10 blocked, something which results in the\naccumulation of many vehicles in the motorway-to-motorway\n(mtm) on-ramp of A4 (i.e., a spillback of the congestion from\nA10 onto the A4 motorway) and in the surrounding on-ramps\n[Fig. 5(b)]. As a result the TTS becomes 13 226 veh h.\nWhen optimal control is applied to the network under Sce-\nnario 1, the TTS becomes 9 032 veh h, a 31.7% improvement.\n926 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\nFig. 6. Scenario 1: (a) density, (b) on-ramp queues, and (c) optimal ramp metering rates.\nThis improvement is evident in Fig. 6 which depicts the density\nand queue evolution profiles as well as the optimal ramp me-\ntering rates for Scenario 1. The large ramp queues that occur\nin the no-control case are not present any more, but queues are\nspread to many on-ramps so as to counteract the formation of\ncongestion. It can be seen that the control strategy manages to\ncomply with the queue constraints imposed and at the same time\nreduce the cost criterion, by distributing the queues spatially and\ntemporally almost in the same pattern as the density\u2019s propaga-\ntion in Scenario 0 [Fig. 5(a)].\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 927\nFig. 7. Scenario 2: (a) density, (b) on-ramp queues, and (c) optimal ramp metering rates.\nScenario 2 assumes that there is more ramp storage capacity\nat the strategy\u2019s disposal (80 vehicles for urban on-ramps and\n120 vehicles for mtm on-ramps). When optimal control is ap-\nplied under these conditions, the TTS becomes 8 230 veh h,\na 37.8% improvement over the no-control case. This larger im-\nprovement is evident in Fig. 7(a) where the density profile is\nseen to be much flatter than that of Scenario 1 [Fig. 6(a)]. Be-\ncause larger storage space is available to the strategy, larger\nqueues are formed, but less on-ramps are used for storage pur-\nposes, see Fig. 7(b). Once the strategy has dealt with the primary\n928 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\ncause of congestion effectively, due to the increased storage\ncapacity available, keeping the demand of the A10-West me-\ntered would only increase the delays without any benefit to the\noverall cost criterion, hence, ramp metering is released. The\ncontrol strategy is intelligent enough to create queues only when\nand only to the extent they may contribute to the reduction of the\nTTS under the imposed queue constraints, as can also be seen\nfrom the optimal ramp metering rates in Fig. 7(c).\nIn the case of Scenario 3, the absence of any queue constraints\nleads to a TTS equal to 7 466 veh h, an improvement of 43.5%\nover the no-control case. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), the den-\nsity evolution profile is completely flat in this case, indicating\nthe fact that there is no congestion present in the ring road. The\ncontrol strategy achieves this impressive amelioration of traffic\nconditions by creating large queues at the on-ramps that are lo-\ncated in the critical bottleneck area where congestion originates,\nsee Fig. 8(b). The queues created, when the optimal ramp me-\ntering rates depicted in Fig. 8(c) are applied, prevent the exces-\nsive demand from entering into the motorway and degrading\nthe network\u2019s capacity. Since there is no limit to the queues that\nare allowed to occur, the queues created in the bottleneck area\nof A10-South are quite large. No queues are required for the\non-ramps further upstream since the primary cause of conges-\ntion is dealt with locally. The optimal results for each scenario\nare summarized in Table I.\nThe amount of TTS reduction depends on the on-ramp\nstorage capacity available to the control strategy. The behavior\nexhibited by optimal control application in the three scenarios\nindicates that the most efficient way to deal with bottlenecks\nand potential congestion is to perform ramp metering at the\non-ramps immediately upstream of the primary bottleneck\nlocation, as was the case in Scenario 3. The unlimited storage\ncapacity assumed in this scenario made the optimal control\nindifferent to the creation of large queues in the vicinity of\nthe bottleneck. However, once the storage capacity becomes\nlimited, as in the cases of Scenarios 1 and 2, queues are created\nfurther upstream from the bottleneck location, and at the same\ntime some congestion appears in the mainstream whose extent\ndepends on the storage capacity assumed available by each\nscenario. Despite the fact that further storage is available\nat the on-ramps far upstream from the bottleneck, e.g., in\nA10-North and East (and in the case of Scenario 2 in A10-West\nas well), congestion is tolerated because large queues in these\non-ramps would impose delays to drivers exiting the network\nbefore reaching the bottleneck. In essence, the control strategy\naims at establishing an optimal tradeoff between the delay\nreduction due to the decrease of the congestion extent, and the\ndelay increase due to the metering of vehicles that exit before\nreaching the bottleneck.\nC. Equity\nLet us now examine the queues formed when the control\nstrategy is applied for the three scenarios considered. Figs. 6(b),\n7(b), and 8(b) differ in the size and location of the queues formed\nwhich is natural because different storage capacities are at the\nstrategy\u2019s disposal in each case. In Scenario 1, the short queues\nare spread over the network, and they endure for a large part\nof the time horizon. In Scenario 2, the queues are longer and\nTABLE I\nTTS FOR EACH SCENARIO\nless spread; they are concentrated around the critical area, and\nthey endure for less time than in Scenario 1. In Scenario 3, long\nqueues occur at selected on-ramps where excessive demand ul-\ntimately creates the congestion problem, and their duration is\nshorter. The reason for these different behaviors is the queue\nconstraints.\nThe control strategy distributes the metering burden for\nreducing the TTS among the on-ramps subject to the maximum-\nqueue constraints. When no such constraints are imposed,\nthe burden of improving the traffic conditions is assigned to\nthe on-ramps that ultimately create the problem because all\ncorresponding users will cross the bottleneck location, hence,\nnobody is delayed unnecessarily. Thus, imposing maximum\nqueue constraints can be seen as a way of distributing the delays\nexperienced by drivers while waiting in the controlled on-ramps.\nThis way the cost of ameliorating the traffic conditions in the\noverall network is shared more or less fairly among the drivers\nthat enter the motorway from various on-ramps, depending\non how strict the constraints are. This equity aspect, however,\nis achieved at the expense of a lower improvement of the\ntraffic conditions, hence, equity and efficiency are partially\ncompeting properties of the control strategy. For a discussion\non the equity properties of ramp metering strategy, see also\n[25] and [26].\nFig. 9 depicts the average (over the time horizon) travel times\nat each on-ramp, needed for ramp-queueing and travelling a\n6.5 km mainstream distance. For each on-ramp the average\ntravel time is calculated according to\n(21)\nwhere is the index number of the link downstream of , and\nis the link index number where the considered mainstream\ndistance of 6.5 km ends, and .\nIt can be seen that, in absence of control measures, the\non-ramps of A10-West are the most disadvantaged ones be-\ncause the congestion occuring at the A10-South creates queues\nand severe density waves traveling upstream [Fig. 5(a)]. Since\nthe ring road from the A1 up to the A8 (counterclockwise) is\nnot congested, the average travel time for the corresponding\non-ramps is small.\nThe smallest average travel times are achieved in Scenario 3,\nwhere no maximum queue constraints exist. However, in this\nscenario, larger travel times occur at the specific on-ramps be-\ntween A1 and A4 where ramp metering is applied [Fig. 8(b)].\nBy focusing in this area, the control strategy clearly induces a\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 929\nFig. 8. Scenario 3: (a) density, (b) on-ramp queues, and (c) optimal ramp metering rates.\ndisadvantage to the drivers that enter the motorway from the\nspecific on-ramps, over the drivers that enter the ring road from\nthe rest on-ramps. By doing so, however, it achieves the smallest\nTTS compared with Scenarios 1 and 2.\nThe effects of queue constraints in Scenarios 1 and 2 may\nbe seen in Fig. 9. The average travel times become larger as the\nmaximum queue constraints become smaller, but this increase is\ndistributed more evenly to other on-ramps also, not only to those\n930 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\nFig. 9. Average travel times \u0016t at each on-ramp o.\nin the bottleneck area that are extensively metered in Scenario\n3, thus, making the control strategy to behave more fairly.\nAs a further equity index, the spatial variance of the travel\ntimes at every discrete time step is calculated according to\n(22)\nwhere and is the number of origins.\nThe average variance is given by .\nIn the no-control case, the variance of the travel times follows\nthe pattern of the congestion formation (Fig. 10) illustrating the\nlarge travel times experienced by the drivers that enter the main-\nstream from on-ramps directly affected by the congestion, and\nthe average variance is 0.0183 h . In the cases of Scenarios 1, 2,\nand 3, the variance of the travel times becomes much smaller as a\nresult of the applied ramp metering, while the total variance be-\ncomes 0.0022 h , 0.0020 h , and 0.0030 h , respectively. Com-\nparing the three control scenarios, Scenario 3 has the greatest\naverage variance, and, in the beginning of the time horizon, it\nhas even greater variance than the no-control case. This result is\ndue to the increased delays incurred by the large queues formed\nat the beginning of the time horizon. The variance of travel times\nfor the other two scenarios is more or less at the same level, with\nScenario 1 having slightly larger average variance than Scenario\n2. This result is due to the fact that a larger congestion is allowed\nto occur in the mainstream under Scenario 1 than under Scenario\n2. The delays caused by this congestion result in higher vari-\nance of the travel times due to longer mainstream travel times\nfor ramps affected by the congestion.\nUnder these terms, Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate also the partially\ncompetitive nature of equity and efficiency. Compared to no\ncontrol, all control scenarios are substantially more efficient and\nfair. Among the control scenarios, however, Scenario 3 is the\nmost efficient achieving a 43.5% improvement of the TTS, but\nalso the most unfair; scenario 1 is the most fair from the con-\nsidered scenarios but at the cost of achieving a \u201cmere\u201d 31.7%\nreduction of the TTS; finally, Scenario 2 is in the middle of Sce-\nnarios 1 and 3 concerning efficiency and equity.\nIt should be noted that these results were not obtained from\nthe explicit optimization of the travel time variance (22). From\n(21) and (22) it can be seen that the variance is a function of\nthe problem\u2019s state variables, hence, this equity index could be\noptimized explicitly by including it as an additional weighted\nfactor in the cost criterion (15).\nD. Computational Effort\nThe computation time required to obtain the optimal solu-\ntions is moderate and depends upon the search method used\nand the specific parameters of each algorithm. It was found\nthat for the search methods that use line optimization, a restart\nhad to take place every four iterations for best convergence,\nwhile for RPROP the parameters used where\n, and . Fig. 11 depicts the cost\ncriterion against the CPU time for various solution methods for\nScenario 3. It can be seen that RPROP is much faster than the\nsearch direction methods which use line optimization. It may be\nseen that with RPROP, particularly near the optimum, the cost\ncriterion value does not necessarily decrease monotonically, but\nthe major part of the cost criterion improvement is typically\nachieved very fast. The computation time for the 4-h horizon\nis 20 min for the bulk of the 43.5% improvement (more than\n40.5%) on a Sun Ultra5 with a Sparc IIi-360 MHz processor\nworkstation. Furthermore, the inclusion of queue penalty terms\ndoes not have any significant effect on the RPROP algorithm\u2019s\nKOTSIALOS AND PAPAGEORGIOU: NONLINEAR OPTIMAL CONTROL 931\nFig. 10. Variance of travel times Var (k).\nFig. 11. Cost criterion versus CPU time.\nconvergence, although the convergence speed becomes some-\nwhat slower. The queue penalty terms have a more important\neffect on the search methods that use line optimization by re-\nducing their speed of convergence.\nFinally, for different initial feasible trajectories, relatively dif-\nferent optimal control trajectories have been observed in some\ncases, but the differences of the corresponding optimal traffic\nstates was negligible, which means that there are local minima,\n932 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 12, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2004\nbut they do not constitute a serius handicap for the practical\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS\nThe reported results demonstrate that the uncontrolled uti-\nlization of the motorway infrastructure strongly degrades the\navailable infrastructure. An impressive amelioration of traffic\nconditions in motorway networks (including the ramps and\nmotorway intersections) is possible with the use of optimal\nramp metering by increasing the network throughput. The\nhighest efficiency is achieved if only the on-ramps closest to\nthe bottlenecks are strongly metered, which however creates\nlong queues and disbenefits the corresponding users for the\nsake of the general efficiency. There is a tradeoff of efficiency\nversus equity which the optimal control strategy addresses im-\nplicitly via consideration of the available ramp storage space,\nsomething which may be used as a tool to establish a desired\npolicy.\nThe formulation of the problem of coordinated ramp me-\ntering control as a discrete-time optimal control problem, allows\nthe application of well known concepts from automatic control\ntheory, and allows the consideration of other control measures as\nwell. Further control measures such as speed control and route\nguidance may be readily integrated cooperatively due to the\nflexible nature of the problem formulation, see [13], [27] and\n[11], [28], respectively. The control trajectories obtained may\nbe used as strategic decision in the sense of providing optimal\nand fair set values over a long time horizon (e.g., 4 h) for subor-\ndinate reactive ramp metering, using, e.g., local ramp metering\ncontrol strategies such as ALINEA (see [29]). This strategic role\ncan be further enhanced by use of a rolling horizon framework\nwhereby the optimal control problem is solved repeatedly in real\ntime, with updated initial state, demand predictions, and turning\nrates, as well as with inclusion of possible incidents.\nFinally, it has been demonstrated that the RPROP search di-\nrection method is superior to the search methods that use line\noptimization for this particular problem.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to note that the content of this paper is\nunder the sole responsibility of them, and in no way represents\nthe views of the European Commission.
