Making criminological studies written in German accessible to \nthe wider European community, we first document how insecurities about crime have \nbeen conceptualised and measured in these three countries, and then review the various \ntheoretical positions that have been empirically assessed. We consider the distinctiveness \nof the German-speaking research on insecurities about crime. We highlight \ncommonalities and differences in the German- and English-language literatures on the \ntopic in a way that makes the review relevant to criminologists from all European \ncountries. Our goal is to help stimulate a truly comparative research agenda on \ninsecurities about crime across the European continent. \n \n \nKey words: Fear of crime; social transformation; Germany; Austria; Switzerland \n \n 1\nThis paper reviews the research literature on insecurities about crime in Germany, \nAustria and Switzerland. The exchange of ideas is central to the criminological enterprise \nbut language barriers are often an impediment. If European criminologists are to develop \na cohesive and comparative literature, theory and research must be accessible to all. With \nthis goal in mind, our review enables scholars from across Europe to compare their own \nliteratures to that emerging from the German-speaking world. \nOverview \n \nOur review falls into two sections. We first document how insecurities about \ncrime (or fear of crime \u2013 we use the phrases interchangeably) has been conceptualised \nand measured in these three countries, before reviewing the theoretical positions that \nhave been empirically assessed. Along the way we address the various historical and \npolitical backdrops to the work \u2013 in particular the re-unification of East and West \nGermany \u2013 and we highlight parallels and departures in the German- and English-\nlanguage literatures (since German-speaking research has been heavily influenced by \nAnglo-Saxon criminology). In contrast to US and UK research, however, the work we \nreview here places special emphasis on the idea that insecurities about crime are just one \nelement of a broader array of social insecurities. We therefore conclude with the \nargument that future research in other European countries might explore the extent to \nwhich insecurities about crime are rooted in public perceptions of neighbourhood \nbreakdown (as in the UK) or in more abstract insecurities about society and social change \n(as in Germany and Austria). \nOrigins of Research into Fear of Crime \n \nIt was the 1970s before German academics began to express an interest in the topic \nof fear of crime. First came the argument that people\u2019s feelings of insecurity about crime \naffect their quality of life, and that the state should therefore protect people from both real \nand supposed threats (Schwind et al., 1978). But it was only after the political upheavals \nin 1989 (Boers, 2003b)2 that sustained attention was paid to fear of crime, as scholars saw \nthis as an opportunity to study a society undergoing rapid social change. The years \nfollowing reunification and the fall of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d saw the new federal states (from \nthe former German Democratic Republic, GDR) experience an increase in perceptions of \ninsecurity (Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium \nf\u00fcr Justiz, 2006). Since then, fear levels have been higher in the East than in the West \n(Bilsky 1996; Bilsky et al., 1995; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium \nf\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Boers 2003a; Dittmann, 2005; Ewald, 2000; Kury et al., 1992; Reuband, \n1996; Forschungsgruppe \u2018Kommunale Kriminalpr\u00e4vention in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019, \n1998), although the mid-1990\u2019s witnessed decreasing public anxieties in both the East and \nWest, producing what has been a gradual alignment of the old and the new federal states \nin levels of fear of crime (Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr \nJustiz, 2006; Dittmann, 2005; D\u00f6rrmann and Remmers, 2000).  \nResearch in Switzerland and Austria followed a few years after Germany. Neither \ncountry experienced reunification, so they lacked such a stimulus to research the topic. In \naddition, the criminological infrastructure is more developed in Germany. Levels of fear \nof crime in Austria have remained relatively low over the last fifteen years, according to \nthe security barometer of the Ministry of the Interior (Giller, 2007). Swiss researchers can \ndraw on several waves of the Swiss Crime Survey, beginning in 1984, showing a \ntrajectory of decreasing levels of fear between mid-1980s and mid-1990s and a steadily \nincrease in levels of fear since then (Killias et al., 2007). \n \n 2\n1. The meaning and measurement of public insecurities about crime \nGerman-speaking criminologists have long distinguished between social attitudes to \ncrime and personal attitudes towards crime (Boers, 1991, 1993, 2003a, 2003b; Boers and \nKurz, 1997, 2001; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, \n2006; Dittmann, 2005; Frevel 1998). Social attitudes refer to the degree to which crime is \nseen as rife and a threat to society (e.g., national crime rates, the evaluation of the police, \nand attitudes towards punishment). Personal attitudes refer to judgments of one\u2019s own \npersonal risk of victimisation. Personal attitudes towards crime are further divided into the \naffective, the cognitive, and the conative (Bals, 2004; Boers, 1991, 1993, 2003a, 2003b; \nBoers and Kurz, 1997, 2001; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr \nJustiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998; Greve et al., 1996; Hirtenlehner, 2006b, 2008; \nSchwarzenegger, 1992; Schwind et al., 2001). Affective relates to the emotional reaction \nto crime, while cognitive refers to personal risk assessment. Conative is concerned with \nprotective and avoidance behaviour. Feelings, thoughts and behaviours are also assumed \nto interact. For example, someone may assess a situation as dangerous (cognitive aspect) \nwhen coping skills are judged as inadequate, they may then experience an emotion of fear \nregarding the situation (affective aspect), and they may then react in a defensive manner \n(conative aspect) (see Boers and Kurz, 1997).  \n \nEmotional dimensions to the fear of crime \nWhile the affective aspect typically refers to the emotional reaction to crime events (Boers \n1991, 1993, 2003a; Frevel 1998), the German-speaking literature imported indicators \nfrom the US and UK that include: \u2018How safe do you feel walking alone in your local area \nafter dark?\u2019 (\u00b4very safe\u00b4, \u00b4quite safe\u00b4, \u00b4a little unsafe\u00b4, \u00b4very unsafe\u00b4)3 (Boers and Kurz, \n1997; Boers, 1991, 2003a, 2003b; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium \nf\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; L\u00fcdemann, 2006; Reuband, 2000a) or \u00b4Is there an area around here \u2013 \nthat is, within a kilometre - where you would not like to go by yourself at night?\u00b44 \n(Reuband, 1992, 2000a; Arnold, 1991; Schwarzenegger, 1992). The use of such measures \nis declining in part due to methodological criticism by Boers and Kurz (1997), Boers \n(2003a, 2003b) and others.5   \nBetter measures differentiate between specific criminal offences (cf. Greve et al., \n1996; Hirtenlehner, 2006b, 2008; Janssen and Schollmeyer, 2001; Reuband, 2000a, 2006). \nSuch indicators often refer to levels (intensity) of worry, e.g.: \u2018How much do you worry, \nout alone in your neighbourhood after dark, about being threatened or verbally abused, \nbeaten up, robbed or mugged, murdered, sexually molested, assaulted, raped?\u2019 (\u00b4Not at \nall worried\u00b4, \u00b4Somewhat worried\u00b4, \u00b4Quite worried\u00b4, \u00b4Very worried\u2019).6 It remains unclear \nwhat people mean when they say they are (for example) fairly worried about being \nburgled. How often do they worry? When they worry is it always at the same intensity? \nTo what extent do these worries stimulate precaution or erode psychological well-being?7 \nFuture research might examine the everyday experience of anxieties, worries and fears \nabout personal safety and victimisation threat, and rounds 3 and 4 of the European Social \nSurvey provide data on the everyday impact of worry about crime. \n \nCognitive dimensions of fear of crime  \nNumerous studies have distinguished between cognitive and emotional components of \nattitudes towards crime (Bals, 2004; Boers, 1991, 1993, 2003a; Hirtenlehner 2006b, 2008; \nL\u00fcdemann, 2006; Schwarzenegger, 1992). Two distinct factors emerge via exploratory \nfactor analysis, suggesting that risk assessment and emotional reactions are conceptually \nrelated but empirically separable dimensions (Reuband, 2000a; Forschungsgruppe \n\u2018Kommunale Kriminalpr\u00e4vention in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019, 1998; Kury and Obergfell-\n 3\nFuchs, 1998; Obergfell-Fuchs and Kury, 1996). Normally measured in terms of personal \nrisk assessments of falling victim (Boers 1991; Boers and Kurz, 1997, 2001; Hirtenlehner, \n2006b, 2008; Schwind et al., 2001; Schwarzenegger, 1992; Bals, 2004; L\u00fcdemann, 2006), \ncognitive aspects of fear of crime refer to perceptions of the personal likelihood of \nvictimisation. For example, Boers and Kurz (1997) asked individuals: \u00b4How likely do you \nthink it is, that in your local area you could be molested, get beaten up, be assaulted and \nrobbed, killed, sexually harassed, attacked or raped?\u00b4 (\u00b4Not at all likely\u00b4, \u00b4Somewhat \nlikely\u00b4, \u00b4Quite likely\u00b4, \u00b4Very likely\u00b4).8 In many cases the reference period is limited to the \nnext twelve months (e.g. Bals, 2004; Hirtenlehner, 2006b, 2008; Kr\u00e4upl and Ludwig, \n1993; L\u00fcdemann 2006; Kury et al., 1992; Reuband 2000a, 2001; Schwarzenegger, 1992; \nD\u00f6rmann and Remmers, 2000).  \nThe narrow focus on perceived likelihood of victimisation echoes a dominant but \nlimited conception of perceived risk that is also evident in US and UK research. Future \nstudies might explore the utility of expanding risk perception to include not just perceived \nlikelihood, but also perceived control and consequence (Warr, 1987; Tulloch, 2003; \nJackson, 2005, 2009). One of the first steps in this direction began in Switzerland. In a \ntheoretical paper, Killias (1990: 98) suggests that there are three dimensions to perceived \nsusceptibility to crime: exposure to risk; the anticipation of serious consequences; and the \nloss of control. According to Killias, each dimension is associated with physical, social \nand situational aspects of vulnerability. For example, more serious consequences are \nexpected to occur amongst women, the elderly, and people in bad health (physical \nfactors), amongst victims without networks of social support (social factors), and in \nisolated areas where no help is available (situational factors).  \nConative (behavioural) dimensions to the fear of crime \nBehaviours (protective and avoidance behaviour) are thought to be both brought about by \n\u2013 as well as being constitutive of \u2013 fear of crime (Bals, 2004; Boers 1991, 2003a; Boers \nand Kurz, 1997; Frevel, 1998; Greve et al., 1996). Avoidance behaviour is usually \nmeasured by asking people about the ways they behave \u2018simply as a result of crime\u2019 or \ntheir behavioural responses when they feel threatened by crime. These include the \navoidance of specific modes of transportation, places (streets, parks) and groups of people \n(young people, immigrants). But they can also include actions that people take to protect \nthemselves or their property (Boers, 1991, 2003a, 2003b; Boers and Kurz, 1997; \nBundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Greve et al., \n1996; Schwind et al., 2001). One way of asking this is \u00b4Do you avoid certain streets or \nparks when you walk alone at nights in your local area, to prevent something happening \nto you?\u00b49 (Kury et al., 1992). Other questions ask about behaviours over the last twelve \nmonths (see for example, L\u00fcdemann, 2006).  \nHowever, despite the importance of asking people what they do in relation to the \nthreat of crime, in comparison to affective and cognitive dimensions, the conative \n(behavioural) aspect receives less attention in empirical research in Germany, Austria and \nSwitzerland. This is also true in the US and UK, although there is early UK evidence that \nworry can actually motivate people to take precautions that in turn reduce risk and \nfeelings of insecurity (Jackson & Gray, 2009). Future research across Europe might \nexplore how people manage their sense of risk through their own crime preventive \nbehaviours. \nMethodological research \nThere has been a good deal of debate over how best to measure fear of crime (Obergfell-\nFuchs et al., 2003), in part fuelled by empirical evidence that different methods can yield \ndifferent results. Kreuter (2002) argues that attitudes towards crime are in fact akin to \nnon-attitudes, triggered by the question rather than recollection of actual experience. Kury \n 4\net al., (2004) argue that answers to questions such as \u2018How safe do you feel walking alone \nin this area after dark?\u2019 might simply reflect insecurity in ambiguous situations rather \nthan concrete emotions regarding perceived threat of crime. Such an argument posits that \nmuch of what has been termed \u2018fear of crime\u2019 might more accurately be referred to as \nunease about disorder and incivility, as grievances on the communal and political level, as \nwell as calls by citizens for interventions by local authorities. For example, a Viennese \nstudy (Stangl, 1996) used narrative interviews to highlight how problematic experiences \nin public spaces were mainly concerned with irritations associated with disorder \u2013 threats \nof crime were of minor importance in people\u2019s daily lives.   \n \n2. Explanations of public insecurities about crime \nThree main perspectives to explain fear of crime can be found in the German-speaking \nliterature (Boers, 1991, 2003a; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr \nJustiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998). Each operates at one of three levels of explanation: the \nvictimisation thesis operates at the personal level; the social control perspective operates \nat the social meso-level; and the social problem perspective operates at the social macro-\nlevel. Drawing together some of the principal arguments of the three perspectives is the \ntask of the interactive model of Klaus Boers (1991, 1993, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997, \n2001). \n \nPersonal level: Victimisation perspective \nAccording to the victimisation perspective, fear of crime should be largely the result of \npersonal experience of crime. In line with this view, people who have been victims of an \noffence \u2013 especially if the offence was violent or sexual \u2013 will be more afraid of becoming \na victim in the future (Boers 1991, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des \nInnern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998) than people who have not \nbeen victimised. Contrary to expectations, however, fear of crime does not seem to be \nstrongly related to area-level crime levels (Boers, 1991; Boers and Kurz, 1997; \nL\u00fcdemann, 2006; Schwind et al., 2001). Indeed, the high fear of crime in Eastern \nGermany after re-unification cannot be explained by high victimisation rates, since crime \nrates were never higher in the East than in the West of Germany (Boers, 1996; Boers and \nKurz, 1997). \nSome effect of victimisation has been found on affective aspects of fear, but as \nwith the Anglo-Saxon literature these effects are rather weak (Bilsky et al., 1995; Boers \nand Kurz, 1997; Janssen and Schollmeyer, 2001; Killias at al., 2007; Kury et al., 1992; \nKury and Obergfell-Fuchs, 1998; L\u00fcdemann, 2006; Schwarzenegger, 1992). At the same \ntime, victimisation does seem to have a stronger impact on cognitive dimensions of fear of \ncrime compared to emotional dimensions (Boers, 2003b; Gabriel und Greve, 2003; Frevel, \n1998), with experiences of victimisation often more closely connected with perceived risk \nthan with emotional fear (Boers, 1991, 2003b; Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium \ndes Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998; Schwarzenegger 1992). \nInterestingly, the statistical significance of the effect of victimisation on fear disappears \nafter controlling either for socio-demographic variables or perceived risk (Arnold, 1991; \nBoers, 2003a; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006), \nsuggesting that some social groups experience higher levels of victimisation than other \nsocial groups, and that victimisation raises subjective perceptions of risk which in turn \nincrease emotional fear.  \nIf fear of crime is strongly related to victimization, then we might also expect that \ngroups with higher victimisation rates should be the most fearful ones. Yet women and \nolder people \u2013 who have the lowest victimisation rates \u2013 seem to fear victimisation more \n 5\nthan men and young people do (the \u2018fear of crime-victimisation paradox\u2019, see Boers and \nKurz, 1997; Boers, 1991, 2003a; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium \nf\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Reuband, 1992), especially when it comes to sexual assault, harassment \nand rape (Killias et al., 2007; Reuband, 1992; Kury et al., 1992; Kury and Obergfell-\nFuchs, 1998; Arnold, 1991; Forschungsgruppe \u2018Kommunale Kriminalpr\u00e4vention in \nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019, 1998; L\u00fcdemann, 2006; Boers, 1991, 1993; Feistritzer and Stangl, \n2006; Schwarzenegger, 1992). But the fact that women have higher fear levels regarding \nother types of offences suggests that women\u2019s fear goes beyond the fear of sexual \noffences (Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Boers, \n2003a; Frevel, 1998).  \nFindings concerning the age-fear relationship are mixed. In some studies older \npeople tend to report higher levels of fear of crime (Killias et al., 2007; L\u00fcdemann, 2006; \nOberwittler, 2008; Boers, 1991, 1993; Hohage, 2004) while other work finds curvilinear \nrelationships (Feistritzer and Stangl, 2006; Kury et al., 1992; Schwarzenegger, 1992). \nMoreover, the age-fear relationship is sometimes slightly different for men and for \nwomen: for women some studies indicate that younger people are more afraid than are \nolder people, but for men fear of crime tends to increase with age (Kury and Obergfell-\nFuchs, 1998; Forschungsgruppe \u2018Kommunale Kriminalpr\u00e4vention in Baden-\nW\u00fcrttemberg\u2019, 1998). In other research no significant age differences are found (Bals, \n2004; Greve et al., 1996; Hirtenlehner, 2006b).  \nSome explanations have been advanced for the fear of crime and victimisation \nparadox. Bilsky and Wetzels (1994) argue that if victimisation is measured using a drop-\noff and sealed-envelope survey, women actually report higher victimisation rates than \nmen. Higher correlations between fear of crime and victimisations can also be found if a \nnarrower definition of non-victims is used, and if the asymmetry of distribution is \nconsidered (see also Bilsky et al., 1995). Moreover, Kury\u2019s (1994) research suggests that \nlower levels of fear of crime are reported partly because of increased social desirability \neffects among males. \nIndeed, indirect victimisation experiences and the experiences of others known by \nthe respondent may also be important. In their report on crime and crime control in \nGermany, the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Ministry of Justice \n(Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006) considered the \nrole of interpersonal communications (such as conversations about the victimisation of \nknown others). Ewald (2000) argues that the rise in fear of crime in Eastern Germany after \nreunification can be partially explained in terms of more communication about crime, \nmeasured by increasing proportions of respondents reporting that they know people who \nhad experienced crime. However, only moderate relationships between indirect \nvictimisation and fear of crime have been observed (see for example, Arnold, 1991; \nBoers, 1991; L\u00fcdemann, 2006; Schwarzenegger, 1992). Some studies could not find \nevidence for a fear-enhancing effect of vicarious victimisation (Bals, 2004; Boers and \nKurz, 1997). Vicarious victimisation seems to affect perceived risk more than affective \nfeelings of security (Bals, 2004; Boers, 2003a; Schwarzenegger, 1992). \n \nSocial meso level: Informal social control perspective \nOverall, there is little evidence that fear of crime is simply (or solely) the result of \nvictimisation. The informal social control approach, by contrast, seeks to explain fear of \ncrime in terms of features in the neighbourhood that people associate with crime (Boers \n1991, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des Innern und \nBundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998; Hirtenlehner, 2008; Hohage, 2004). \nIndividuals perceive certain characteristics in the immediate environment as signs of \n 6\nsocial disorganisation and instability (such as dirt and garbage, and groups of juveniles \nhanging out on the streets), indicating that there is something wrong with the \nneighbourhood and that the community\u2019s capacity to regulate people\u2019s behaviour is \nimpaired.  \nNumerous studies have found a close connection between perceived incivilities \nand crime-related feelings of insecurity (Bals, 2004; Boers and Kurz, 1997; H\u00e4fele and \nL\u00fcdemann, 2006; Hirtenlehner, 2006a, 2008; Hohage, 2004; Janssen and Schollmeyer, \n2001). For example, Austrian studies have shown that low levels of disorder in public \nspaces have been a protective factor against fear in Vienna (Hanak et al., 2004, 2007; \nHanak, Karazman-Morawetz and Krajewski, 2007). And while the effect of perceptions of \ndisorder on fear of crime is generally found to be mediated by risk assessment, some \nstudies have found a significant effect even after controlling for the perception of risk \n(Bals, 2004; Hirtenlehner, 2006b, 2008).  \nResearch on public perceptions of neighbourhood breakdown and stability mirrors \nsome US and UK research (Hale, 1996), which suggests that people draw from signs of \nneighbourhood breakdown and information about crime and risk (Ferraro, 1995). But it \nalso suggests that fear of crime expresses public beliefs that there are signs of crime \npresent in their neighbourhood. The perceptual processes that underpin such beliefs may \nreflect a series of inferences, stereotypes and evaluations about social and moral \nboundaries and the things viewed as hostile to settled community and shared trust (Farrall \net al., 2009). \n \nSocial macro level: Social problem perspective \nThere are two main approaches to the effect of macro level explanations of fear of crime. \nWhile they are often categorised in the German-speaking literature as part of the same \napproach (Boers 1991, 2003a), sometimes they are decoupled (Hirtenlehner 2006a, 2009; \nHirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, 2004a, 2004b). Given their different foci they will \nbe discussed separately here. \nThe first approach understands fear of crime as a social phenomenon shaped by \nthe dramatisation and exploitation of crime in the arenas of politics and mass media (Bals, \n2004; Boers 1991, 1993, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des Innern \nund Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006; Frevel, 1998; Hirtenlehner, 2006a). While the \nmass media may be especially important (Frevel, 1998), only a few studies in the German-\nspeaking countries investigate the relationship between media reporting and fear of crime \n(Boers, 1991; Pfeiffer et al., 2004, 2005; Reuband, 1998; Schwarzenegger, 1992). What \nexists has found only weak (Reuband, 1998) or very weak (Boers, 1991; Schwarzenegger, \n1992) associations between fear of crime and media crime reports. Reuband (1998) \nsuggested that the effect of media crime reporting on fear of crime was mediated by \nperceived risk, while Boers (1991) and Schwarzenegger (1992) showed weak correlations \nbetween media consumption and emotional fear even after controlling for risk appraisal. \nCrime coverage on TV may be more influential than crime coverage in newspapers \n(Boers, 1991; Schwarzenegger, 1992), with Reuband (1998) finding a robust statistical \neffect between television viewing and fear of crime.  \nBoers and Kurz (1997) and Kury et al. (1992), argue that the role of the mass \nmedia may be of particular importance in the case of East Germany, since after \nreunification people started to have access to media from the West. Observing events \nabout which they previously had no information may have created for East Germans a \nfeeling of soaring crime rates (Janssen and Schollmeyer, 2001; Reuband, 2000b). \nMeasuring the content of news articles in Dresden and D\u00fcsseldorf before and after \nreunification, Reuband (2001) found that the average daily number of articles about crime \n 7\nin East Germany increased significantly, eventually reaching similar numbers to those \nfound in the West. Yet, while he assumes that the increase in media coverage of crime \nexplains the increase in fear of crime after reunification, there are no data to support this \nclaim (Boers and Kurz, 1997). \nA second approach understands fear of crime in the context of general anxieties \nand uncertainties in times of social change (Ewald, 2000; Herrmann et al., 2003; \nHirtenlehner, 2006a, 2009; Hirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, 2004a, 2004b; Kunz, \n1983; Sessar, 2008). This approach is sometimes referred to as the generalisation thesis \n(Hirtenlehner 2006a, 2009; Hirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, 2004a, 2004b), and \nhere again there are parallels with the UK literature (Taylor and Jamieson, 1998; Girling \net al., 2000; Jackson, 2004, 2006; Farrall et al., 2009).  \nDrawing on theorists of \u2018the risk society\u2019, the argument is that fear of crime is part \nof a generalised and diffuse anxiety brought about by late modernity (Ewald, 2000; \nHerrmann et al., 2003; Hirtenlehner, 2006a, 2009; Hirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, \n2004a, 2004b; Kunz, 1983; Sessar, 2008). More particularly, diffuse anxieties are \nprojected by citizens onto crime and criminals and fear is thus transfered to a more \nidentifiable problem (Hirtenlehner, 2006a, 2009; Herrmann et al., 2003). Fear of crime \nmay thus be best understood as a symbol of global and social changes, rather than the \nproduct of objective concerns about crime. \nEmpirical research concerning the so-called generalisation thesis is predominantly \nconducted in Austria. Analysing data from a survey set in Vienna, Hirtenlehner and \nKarazman-Morawetz (2004a, 2004b) argue that global, social and crime-related feelings \nof insecurity (as well as irritation with regard to \u201cincivility\u201d in the neighbourhood) may in \nfact form a monolithic syndrome of insecurity. Hirtenlehner (2006a) analysed data from a \nLinz sample and claim that abstract insecurities may explain the joint distribution of four \nsubdimensions of generalised anxiety (fear of crime, social fears, life fears and disorders). \nThere is other evidence for the generalisation thesis. First of all, research has shown that \neconomically and socially vulnerable people tend to show higher levels of fear of crime \n(Boers, 1991). Second, fear of crime has been found to be related to high levels of anomie \n(Obergfell-Fuchs and Kury, 1996) and to general social problems in Vienna, such as fears \nof global threats and signs of social destabilisation (Hirtenlehner and Karazman-\nMorawetz, 2004a, 2004b). \nEqually, research in Vienna suggests that the favourable assessment of the local \nsecurity situation is not as much related to close-knitted social networks or a stable \nintegration into the neighbourhood, but rather to a general trust in the state and its \ninstitutions (Hanak et al., 2004, 2007; Hanak et al., 2007). The continuity of the Fordist \nwelfare state sets the foundations for immunity to crime-related insecurity feelings, with \nAustria\u2019s trust in national and local institutions and authorities protecting citizens from the \nrisks of late modernity (Hirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, 2004a, 2004b). This \nexplanation fits the trajectory of fear of crime in Germany especially well, in that the \nincrease in fear of crime in East Germany after the social upheavals and reunification in \n1989\/90 can be explained in terms of the insecurity caused by the social changes that took \nplace (Boers and Kurz, 1997; Forschungsgruppe \u2018Kommunale Kriminalpr\u00e4vention in \nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019, 1998; Ewald, 2000; Reuband, 1996). Meanwhile, the subsequent \ndecline in the rates of fear of crime after 1995 can be understood as part of an adaptation \nprocess (Boers and Kurz, 1997; Reuband, 2001; Ewald, 2000). The more that people get \nused to the new system, its structures and rules, the less diffuse insecurities are projected \nonto crime. \n \nInteractive Model \n 8\nPowerful explanations of fear of crime are likely to draw upon a number of different \nlevels of analysis \u2013 this much we know from decades of social scientific research. So \nKlaus Boers\u2019 (1991, 1993, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997, 2001) interactive model, which \nintegrates the different components into one framework, is of special interest. The model \ndistinguishes between social attitudes towards crime on the one hand and personal \nattitudes towards crime on the other. It stresses how they interact and are shaped by the \ncloser and wider social environment. According to this model, experiences of \nvictimisation, media reports and signs of social disorganisation affect the perception of \nrisk, while perceived risk leads to increased fear of crime when accompanied by a lack of \ncoping resources (Boers, 2003a).  \nPeople\u2019s coping abilities in the relationship between risk appraisal and fear of \ncrime are important to the framework. Coping abilities can be understood as the personal \nappraisal of the ability to deal with dangerous, crime-related situations. They are expected \nto moderate the effect of perceived risk on fear of crime. Little confidence in one\u2019s \nchances to master a situation successfully will allow an increased awareness of risk to \nincrease the fear of crime. Boers and Kurz (1997) approach vulnerability through the \nconcept of social milieus. This approach considers horizontal differences, shaped mainly \nby people\u2019s cultural and normative preferences, with social milieus measured in terms of \nsocial position (e.g. education, income) and cultural-normative orientation (capturing \nopenness to new experiences, importance of education, and so forth). People in social \nmilieus with higher levels of social, psychical, physical or economic vulnerability are \nexpected to have lower coping abilities and therefore higher levels of fear of crime.  \nTesting this relationship Boers and Kurz (1997; 2001) found that in West Germany \npeople in social milieus with low social, economic and normative resourses were more \nworried about crime than people in other settings. However, in East Germany fear was \nfound to be more associated with age and gender than to the social milieu of the \nrespondent. Boers and Kurz (1997) argue that the observed association in the East can be \ninterpreted as a special case due to the social upheavals of the 1990s.  \nThe explanatory power of the interactive model has only been rudimentarily \nexamined. Several studies document a connection between levels of fear and the \nassessment of risk or the above mentioned socio-demographic variables (e.g. Boers, 1991, \n1993; Janssen and Schollmeyer, 2001; Kury and Obergfell-Fuchs, 1998; Schwarzenegger, \n1992). But the subjective assessment of personal coping abilities has generally been \nneglected. Furthermore, risk assessment and social variables are mostly introduced \nsimultaneously in regression models without allowing for their interaction (Bals, 2004; \nBoers, 1991, 1993; Janssen and Schollmeyer, 2001; Schwarzenegger, 1992). This permits \nthe isolation of the main effects of these variables, but it does not permit testing of an \ninteraction effect between risk appraisal and coping indicators. The few studies in which \ndata on personal coping skills are collected directly often show the expected relationship \nbetween coping abilities and fear of crime, but in many cases ignore risk appraisal (e.g. \nKillias and Clerici, 2000; Killias et al., 2007).  \nOnly one study has tested the interactive model as a whole, namely Hirtenlehner\u2019s \n(2006b) study with Austrian data. The core thesis of the interactive constitution of fear of \ncrime in terms of risk perception and negative assessment of coping abilities could not be \nconfirmed. No significant interaction between risk assessment and coping abilities was \nfound. Even though fear of crime was increased as a direct consequence of the \nanticipation of risk, coping resources did not play a moderating role. \n \n3. Summary \n 9\nOur final goal is to consider more broadly the distinctiveness of the research on \ninsecurities about crime conducted in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. We highlight \nsome similarities and some differences with the Anglo-Saxon literature. And we identify \nfuture opportunities for exchange, not just with UK and US researchers, but also with \ncriminologists from across Europe. \nThe systematic interest in public perceptions of security in Germany came only in \nthe context of reunification and the fall of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d (Obergfell-Fuchs and Kury, \n2003). In Germany, but also in Austria and Switzerland, belated attention to the issue \nmeant that research was from the beginning heavily influenced by the Anglo-Saxon \nresearch. Explanatory models, empirical tools and policy discussions have developed and \nsometimes been uncritically adopted. But perhaps there are two main areas of special \ninterest for the broader European criminological community. First, German-speaking \ncriminology has been concerned with the systematisation of diverse and multi-faceted \nfindings. Klaus Boers\u2019 interactive model is the core of this systematisation process (1991, \n1993, 2003a; Boers and Kurz, 1997, 2001), and is widely accepted in the German-\nspeaking countries; nearly all studies at least implicitly refer to it. Its merit lies in two \ndifferent aspects. First, it carefully differentiates the various components of public \nattitudes towards crime. Second, it is a coherent integration of the major explanatory \napproaches found in the international literature. Crucially, this model has potential for \nfurther research at the international level, indeed such a comprehensive and detailed \nincorporation of the vulnerability theory can still not be found in the Anglo-Saxon \ncontext.  \nSecond, studies on the social control perspective often show a close correlation \nbetween perceptions of incivility and fear of crime. But contrary to Anglo-Saxon work, \nauthors from Austria (Hirtenlehner, 2008) and Germany (L\u00fcdemann, 2006) attribute the \ninsignificance of local informal social control to the strong role of the state in these \ncountries. Indeed, the breeding ground of the autonomous contributions of German-\nspeaking criminology can be found in the radical changes of the former GDR and the \nmarked welfare state tradition. This context led German-speaking criminologists to \nconsider fear of crime to be embedded in wider social anxieties and uncertainties. The \ncollapse of the GDR and its reunification with the former Federal Republic of Germany \nwas used by German criminologists as a \u2018natural experiment\u2019 to study the effects of rapid \nsocial transformation processes on crime and perceptions of insecurity (Boers et al., \n1997). A special emphasis was placed on the development of perceptions of insecurity in \nthose new federal states in the East of Germany most affected by the social upheaval. This \nunique opportunity led from the beginning to a consideration of fear of crime in the \ncontext of social, economic and existential uncertainties. \nThe marked regulation and welfare state tradition of the German-speaking \ncountries, and the central role played by the state in managing the upheaval, resulted in \nGerman-speaking countries being less concerned with the strengthening of the community \n(social capital and informal social control) and more with the institutional protection of \nexistential risks (Hirtenlehner, 2009; Hirtenlehner and Karazman-Morawetz, 2004a, \n2004b; Kunz, 1983). In particular, Austrian research has highlighted the role of the \nwelfare state and its institutions in the stabilisation of high perceptions of security (Giller, \n2007; Hanak et al., 2007; Hirtenlehner 2006a, 2009). The generalisation thesis \n(Hirtenlehner, 2006a, 2009) understands fear of crime as a projection of diffuse social and \nexistential anxieties, fed by social transformation processes. Compared to the Anglo-\nSaxon perspective, there is more emphasis placed on the role of these global and national \nconcerns in the fear of crime. While the British and American literature emphasises the \n 10\nrole of the neighbourhood and the community, the German research is more concerned \nwith the impact of global and \u2018remote\u2019 uncertainties on citizen\u2019s well-being.  \nResearch from other European countries may shed some important light here. How \ndo different communal and societal characteristics interact with cultural and institutional \nconditions in shaping people\u2019s insecurities about crime? To what extent does the socio-\ncultural, institutional and political context influence scientific reflections on fear of crime? \nIn some countries, public perceptions of crime may operate against the backdrop of \nbroader anxieties about long-term social change, but crucially these anxieties translate into \nfears of crime through mediating perceptions of community and neighbourhood (as found \nin the UK research of Girling et al., 2000; Jackson, 2004; Farrall et al., 2009). In other \ncountries, fear of crime may be just one facet of this broader set of insecurities (as found \nin some Austrian and German research, Sessar; Hirtenlehner, 2006). These issues focus \nour attention upon the contextual factors that affect the discourse on social anxieties about \ncrime. An increased exchange between European scholars may help clarify some of these \nquestions, and this paper has attempted to promote such scholarly interaction. \n 11\nReferences \nArnold, H. (1991).

(1978). \n3 From the original: \u00b4Wie sicher f\u00fchlen Sie sich, wenn Sie abends im Dunkeln alleine durch die Strassen \nIhres Stadtteils\/Dorfes gehen?\u00b4 (\u00b4sehr sicher\u00b4, ziemlich sicher\u00b4, \u2018etwas unsicher\u00b4, \u00b4sehr unsicher\u00b4). \n4 From the original: \u00b4Gibt es eigentlich hier in der unmittelbaren N\u00e4he \u2013 ich meine im Umkreis von einem \nKilometer \u2013 irgendeine Gegend, wo Sie nachts nicht alleine hingehen m\u00f6chten?\u00b4. \n5 This is largely a function of critiques of the measures themselves. First, it may be difficult to capture a \nconstruct as complex as fear of crime with one single question (Kury et al., 1992; Bilsky and Wetzels, \n1994). Second, some of the items do not mention crime as the reason for feeling insecure. They may thus \ncapture a variety of other insecurities that are not related to crime in a narrow sense, like fear of being alone, \nfear of the dark or fear of being outside (Reuband 2000a). Third, some of them refer to anticipated fictitious \nor hypothetical events many people will never encounter (Bilsky and Wetzels, 1994; Bundesministerium des \nInnern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006). Fourth, they do not differentiate between different types of \noffences (Boers, 1991, 2003b). And fifth, some vague measures of fear of crime may be used as a tool to \nexpress unease with living conditions and social circumstances in the immediate environment (Hanak, \nKarazman-Morawetz and Stangl, 2007, Hirtenlehner, 2009). Because of all this, the standard items may be \ntapping into different types of fear or even a diffuse fear of ambivalent situations (Boers, 1991, 2003a, \n2003b; Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006). \nFurthermore, the situational context\u2014places and times\u2014may also have an effect on the results obtained \n(Boers and Kurz, 1997; Bundesministerium des Innern und Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz, 2006). The \nformulation of such measures may lead to an overestimation of the real levels of fear of crime. \n6 From the original: \u2018Inwieweit beunruhigt es Sie, abends im Dunkeln in Ihrem Stadtteil\/Dorf angep\u00f6belt, \nzusammengeschlagen, \u00fcberfallen und beraubt, get\u00f6tet, sexuell bel\u00e4stigt, angegriffen oder vergewaltigt zu \nwerden?
