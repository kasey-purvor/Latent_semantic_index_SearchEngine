INTRODUCTION \n \nUnder dynamic compressive loading, brittle materials generally deform inelastically. \nThe inelastic response of the these brittle materials is usually attributed to the \nnucleation, growth and coalescence of microcracks. Early work [1] has shown that \nfailure of polycrystalline alumina is controlled by microplasticity, i.e. twinning and \npossibly slip, which nucleate grain boundary cracks. The nucleation, growth and \ncoalescence of these cracks causes extensive stiffness loss and strength degradation \nwithin the material [2].  \n \nVarious models have been suggested for modelling the response of ceramics under \ndynamic loading. Ravichandran and Subhash [3] and Deng and Nemat-Nasser [4] \nused a sliding crack model [5] as a basis for modelling the failure of brittle materials \nunder dynamic compressive loading. Addesio and Johnson [6] presented a \nmicrophysical model to describe the complex behaviour of ceramics under dynamic \nloading. Both crack opening due to tension and crack sliding due to compression were \nmodelled. Rajendran [7] has successfully modelled the inelastic response of alumina \nusing a \u201ccalibrated\u201d approach where the physical parameters were matched with low \nvelocity plate impact results. All of these authors have presented adequate verification \nof their approaches to modelling the impact of brittle materials. \n \nAUTODYN [8] is a finite difference, non-linear explicit hydrocode which is capable \nof modelling a wide variety of dynamic situations. It includes a cumulative damage \nmaterial model that degrades the material strength and stiffness as a function of \n\u2018damage\u2019. This damage parameter is related to effective plastic strain in the material. \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 3\nSuch a model does not relate closely to the physical crack softening mechanisms \ndescribed above. Through the modification and implementation of a coded user-\nsubroutine, a user can create models which simulate failure of a material loaded \ndynamically.  \n \nThere is, therefore, a requirement for detailed crack softening models to be developed \nand implemented in hydrocodes such as AUTODYN. It is the authors\u2019 intention to \npresent and discuss a physically based crack softening model which can be \nimplemented within a hydrocode. Using the laws of fracture mechanics, equations are \npresented which are implemented within the coded user-subroutine in AUTODYN \nand validated under three different dynamic situations. \n \nII. CRACK SOFTENING DAMAGE MODEL \n \nA. Dynamic failure in compression \n \nMost brittle solids contain inhomogeneities such as small holes, cracks or phases \nwhich have different moduli or strengths from those of the matrix. When a brittle \nmaterial is subjected to a large confining stress, any of these inhomogeneities can act \nas nuclei for new cracks. These microcracks eventually coalesce to cause axial \nsplitting.  \n \nFor a straight slanted flaw that is loaded under biaxial compression, where \u03c31>\u03c32, \ntensile cracks nucleate from the tips of the flaw and grow in the direction of \nmaximum compression [9,10] as shown in Figure 1a: \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 4\n \nFIG. 1.  \n \nThe tension cracks (or \u2018winglets\u2019) are assumed to grow so as to maximise the mode I \nstress intensity factor KI. The growing \u2018winglets\u2019 are approximated by straight cracks \nbecause the sigmoidal cracks grow to several times the initial flaw length (Figure 1b) \n[3,11]. Under compression, the failure depends on the relative magnitude of the \nprincipal stresses, and for the case above, it is assumed that \u03c31 is the largest principal \nstress. The kinked tension cracks are approximated by a single large crack of length 2l \nwhich grows in the direction of maximum compression (Figure 1c). The analogy can \nalso be applied to a crack emanating from a circular pore [12]. \n \nFor an inclined crack (Figure 1c) subjected by compressive stresses \u03c31 and \u03c32, the \ncrack is subjected to a co-linear opening load T. We can calculate T by taking the \ncontribution by the driving shear stresses on the inclined crack thus: \n \nT a= 2 \u03c4\u03b8                                                            (1) \n \nResolving the compressive stresses \u03c31 and \u03c32 and taking into account the resistive \nfrictional stress \u03c4F , we can calculate the driving shear stress \u03c4\u03b8 of a sliding crack. \n \n\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03b8 \u03c4\u03b8 = \u2212 \u221212 21 2( ) sin F          (2) \nin which \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 5\n\u03c4 \u03b7 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03b8F = + + \u221212 21 2 1 2[( ) ( ) cos ]          (3) \n \nThis frictional shear stress (\u03c4F ), resists the shear load acting on the crack faces which \nprovide the driving force for tensile crack propagation. \u03b7 is the coefficient of friction \nwhich is assumed to be uniform across the face of the crack. \n \nThe mode I and mode II stress intensity factors KI and KII at the tip of each of the \ntension cracks shown in Figure 1 and under biaxial compressive loading are given by \n \nKI\nA = T\nl\ncos\u03b8\n\u03c0  and KII\nA = T\nl\nsin\u03b8\n\u03c0                                         (4a,b) \n \nwhere Tcos\u03b8 and Tsin\u03b8 are the crack opening and sliding loads respectively. \n \nThese results give good estimates of the stress intensity when l is large but it becomes \nunstable when the length l becomes vanishingly small. To overcome errors in the \ncalculation of KI and KII  when the length of the tension cracks are extremely small  \nwe have added a constant (l*) to produce an \u2018effective\u2019 crack length (l+l*) which is \ndependant on the initial flaw size [11]. l* has been estimated [13] to be 0.27a. \n \nMoreover, the far field confining stress \u03c32 contributes to the mode I stress intensity \nfactor acting on the wing cracks to close the crack when \u03c32 is compressive thus: \n \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 6\nKI\nB = \u2212\u03c3 \u03c02 l                                                               (5) \n \nSumming the contributions of A and B to the mode I stress intensity we finally have \n \n KI = + \u2212\nT\nl l\nl\ncos\n[ ( )]\n( )\n*\n\u03b8\n\u03c0 \u03c3 \u03c02  and KII =\n\u2212\n+\nT\nl l\nsin\n[ ( )]*\n\u03b8\n\u03c0            (6a,b) \n \nIn this instance, the compressive stresses are assumed to be positive.  \n \nB. Dynamic failure in tension \n \nA large amount of failure observed in a brittle material subjected by a dynamic load is \ntensile. Hoop stresses induced by the radial movement of the material due to \npenetration is sufficient to nucleate tensile flaws which eventually coalesce and cause \nfailure. Moreover, tensile spall planes are generated by tensile waves reflected off free \nsurfaces which are able to interact with inhomogeneities and nucleate flaws. \n \nWhen a tensile pulse passes a microcrack within a brittle material the mode I and \nmode II stress intensities depend on the time of duration and the speed of the pulse.  \n \nFIG. 2. \nAssuming that the tensile pulse arrives uniformly at the crack tip, the stress intensity \nfactors can be described [14] by \n \nJ.

Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 7\n K t C c tI I d( ) = \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b8 2  and K t C c tII II d( ) = \u03c4 \u03c0\u03b8 2                      (7a,b) \n \nwhere \u03c3\u03b8 and \u03c4\u03b8 are the resolved normal and shear stresses acting on the microcrack, \ncd and cs are the dilational and shear wave velocities and t is time.

Crack Distribution \n \nIt is assumed that there is a uniformly distributed number of microcracks of even \nlength distributed through the target material. For simplicity, it is assumed that there \nis one orientated microcrack per cell, evenly distributed as shown in Figure 3. \nHowever, it is simple to apply a random Weibull Distribution function to the crack \nposition and to vary the length in a random fashion. It is assumed that residual \nstresses within the material are minimal. \n \n \nFIG. 3. \n \nAlthough the orientations of microflaws are generally random, failure may occur from \ncracks which nucleate from microflaws of some suitable angle. The angle which is \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 8\nchosen here is as suggested by Nemat-Nasser and Deng [15], namely \u03b8 = \u03c0\/5. The \nlength of the initial microflaw is taken to be the average size of a microflaw within the \nmaterial. \n \nD. Crack initiation \n \nIn the conventional static Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, the condition for the \nonset of crack growth is often expressed as \n \n K Kc=      (9) \n \nwhere Kc is called the critical stress intensity factor (often called the static fracture \ntoughness). In elastodynamic fracture there are two counterparts to the equation. First \nfor the onset of growth of a rapidly loaded stationary crack we have \n \n K t Kd( , ) ( &)0 = \u03c3                                                  (10) \n \nwhere Kd is the dynamic initiation toughness which may also depend on the \ntemperature. \n \nSecond, for dynamically propagating cracks it has been suggested that \n \n K t l K lD( , &) ( &)=                                                 (11) \n \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 9\nwhere KD is the dynamic propagation toughness for propagating cracks and &l  \nrepresents the rate of crack growth. \n \nIt has been shown experimentally [16] that \n \nK\nK\nd\nc\n= \u03b1             (12) \n \nwhere \u03b1 is a constant. At initiation, \u03b1 varies between 1.25 - 1.40 for ceramics [17]. \nAccording to the criterion given above, a propagating crack will be arrested when the \nstress intensity factor becomes smaller than or equal to a critical value.  \n \nThis can be expressed as \n \n K K KD Ia\ndyn\u2264 \u2261( )0                                                  (13) \n \nwhere KIa\ndyn  denotes the dynamic crack arrest toughness. \n \n \nShockey, Kalthoff and Erlick [18] reported a substantial reduction of the crack \ninitiation toughness in brittle epoxy due to dynamic loading. The estimate for the \nfracture toughness under dynamic loading conditions imposed was about KId = \n0.72MPa m  compared to the slow moving fracture toughness of KIc = 1.1MPa m . \nFor ceramics however, the opposite seems to occur. Yang and Kobayashi [19] noted \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 10\nan increase in initiation toughness under dynamic loading conditions. Unlike metals \nand polymers, they observed that the dynamic crack arrest toughness did not exist i.e. \nonce crack growth was initiated, stable crack growth was observed even when the \nstress intensity was lowered. \n \nThe virtual energy release rate for a stationary microcrack affected by a static and \ntransient load (plane strain) is given [14] by \n \n( )G E K KI II= \u2212 +1\n2\n2 2\u03bd          (14) \n \nwhere E represents the Young\u2019s modulus of the material. \n \nTo calculate the virtual energy release rate of the crack, for both compression and \ntension, the respective mode I and mode II stress intensity factors are substituted into \n(14). This then is checked against a critical virtual energy release rate Gc. \n \nBecause the mode I and mode II stress intensities in compression are calculated from \nLinear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, we must consider the effect of loading the \nspecimen dynamically. We do this by introducing the relationship:   \n \nG\nG\nhdyn =                   (15) \n \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 11\nwhere Gdyn is the dynamic virtual energy release rate, G is the static virtual energy \nrelease rate calculated from Equation 14 and h is a constant to be calculated from \nexperimental data. Both the dynamic and static critical energy release rate (plane \nstrain) for tensile crack initiation can be calculated using the relationship: \n \nG\nE\nKc Ic= \u2212( )1\n2\u03bd\n                                                             (16) \n \nTable 1 shows the comparison of the static and the dynamic fracture toughness and \ntheir corresponding critical energy release rates for two grades of alumina, Coors \nAD995 and AD998. The average value of h from the three references for the two \ngrades of alumina is 1.69. No data is currently available for Sintox-FA. \n \nThe modified value of the virtual energy release rate is compared with the critical \nenergy release rate for crack initiation: \n \nG Gdyn c=                                                                     (17) \n \nTable I. \n \nIn tension however, the mode I and mode II stress intensity factors are calculated \nfrom the laws of elastodynamic fracture mechanics and a simple initiation law can \ntherefore be used: \n \nG Gc=                                                         (18) \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 12\n \nE. Crack propagation velocity \n \nOnce a crack has initiated, it will propagate at a velocity dependent on the applied \nstress intensity [20]. Under compression, the crack will propagate in a stable manner; \nunder tension the crack will propagate catastrophically at a velocity ( )&l  fast \napproaching the Rayleigh wave speed (cR) of the material. Failure in compression and \nin tension is described by  \n \n&l c K\nKR\nd\nI\n= \u2212\u239b\u239d\u239c\n\u239e\n\u23a0\u239f1      (19) \n \nAlthough Kd is a function of the rate of applied stress for most materials little \nevidence exists to support this for ceramics [17,19,21]. In this instance, Kd is assumed \nconstant and can be calculated by substituting a value of the critical stress intensity \nfactor for ceramic (4MPa\u221am) and the values of \u03b1 in Table 1 into Equation (12). \n \nIII. AUTODYN MODEL AND VERIFICATION \n \nAUTODYN is a finite difference hydrocode with the option of using Lagrangian, \nEulerian, Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (ALE) and Shell processors. For this paper, the \nLagrangian processor was used. AUTODYN can be linked with a user supplied \nsubroutine to modify the existing program and to implement a new equation of state, \nstrength or damage model. A linear equation of state is used along with a Mohr-\nCoulomb strength model to represent the undamaged ceramic. \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 13\n \nA. Code implementation \n \nFor each cycle, the mode I and mode II stress intensity factors (Equations 6 and 7) are \ncalculated for a single pre-existing flaw, the size of which was taken to be the average \ngrain size of the material (2a in Figure 1 and Table 2). From these, the strain energy \nrelease rate is calculated (Equation 14) and compared with the critical value \n(Equations 17 and 18). If this critical value is exceeded, the crack will grow at a \ncalculated velocity (Equation 19). The cracks will grow when under compression or \ntension. It is assumed that the cell is unable to carry load when the crack has \npropagated through the entire cell and coalesces with a neighbouring microcrack. \nEach crack is able to propagate past the cell boundaries by simply adding the length \nexceeding the cell dimension to the neighbouring crack. A scalar damage parameter \nvarying between 0 and 1 is defined in accordance with crack growth, where 0 \nrepresents no crack growth and 1 represents complete coalescence and failure of the \nLagrangian cell. This damage parameter is used to linearly degrade the elastic moduli \nand the yield strength depending on the pressure within the cell [8]. Alternative \nmechanisms of strength and moduli degradation due to microcracking are available \n[22,23]. \n \nThis new crack softening model was used in three simulations and the results \ncompared with those from experimental investigation. The material data used is \nsummarised in Table 2. \n \nTable II. \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 14\n \nTwo completely different plate impact experiments were compared with the \nmicrocrack model to validate the material response. Firstly, Song, Bless, Brar, Simha \nand Jang [24] impacted a high purity alumina plate at a velocity of 735m\/s against an \nalumina target backed by steel (Model Run A1). Secondly, Dandekar and Bartowski \n[25] again impacted alumina on alumina, but backed by polymethylmethacrylate \n(PMMA) (Model Run A2). The impact velocity in this case was 83 m\/s. In both \nexperiments the axial stress was measured at the target - backing interface. The results \nof the plate impact experiments and the microcrack model predictions are compared \nin Figures 4 and 5: \n \nFIG. 4.  \n \nFIG. 5. \n \nB. Simulation of sphere impact \n \nThe model was used to investigate the impact of steel spheres against thick blocks of \nalumina (Model Run A3). Experiments were conducted in which spheres were \nmounted in plastic sabots and fired from a 7.62mm rifle barrel using a standard \n7.62mm cartridge case filled with Hercules Blue Dot propellant. Three EN31 6.35mm \nsteel spheres were fired at high velocity against free standing 100\u00d7100\u00d750mm \nalumina (Sintox FA) targets and the results were compared to AUTODYN predictions \nusing the crack softening damage model. The depth of penetration and the size of the \nJ. Appl. Phys. 82, 1088 (1997); doi:10.1063\/1.365875 (5 pages) \n 15\ncomminuted material (the \u201cMescall zone\u201d [26]) next to the projectile nose were \nexamined and plotted in Figures 6 and 7: \n \nFIG. 6.  \n \nFIG. 7. \n \nThe results show strong correlation between the experiment and the model. It is quite \nclear that the strength of the damaged material plays an important role in the \npenetration of the projectile. Over estimation of the strength of the comminuted \nmaterial will reduce the depth of penetration, underestimation will increase \npenetration. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS \n \nA new crack softening damage model based on the laws of dynamic fracture \nmechanics has been presented. Comparison with two different flyer plate experiments \nhave shown that the model closely follows experimental data. The model has been \nused to analyse sphere impact experiments at varying velocities and has proven \neffective in quantifying depth of penetration and damage. \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nJ.
