INTRODUCTION\nTHERE is a growing interest in the development and uti-lization of fault-current limiters in electrical distribution\nnetworks. This arises from the need to deal with the ever-in-\ncreasing short-circuit level in power systems and to constrain the\nstresses on the transformers, circuit breakers, feeder cables, and\nembedded generators during short-circuit faults. This can also\nbe attributed to the concern over power quality as fault current\nlimiters can be used to mitigate voltage sags caused by faults\n[1]. Fault-current limiters are needed to provide a limited, but\nsustained short-circuit current through the fault for a sufficient\ntime (for example, 1 s) to enable proper coordination of protec-\nManuscript received February 3, 2005.

In some cases, they may also be used to maintain\nsustained short-circuit current through a cable that has devel-\noped an intermittent fault to enable fault location.\nSeveral devices to limit the fault current have been developed\nincluding electronically controlled fuses, tuned LC circuits,\nthyristor-controlled series reactors, solid-state fault-current\nlimiters based on resistors\/inductors switched by gate turn-off\nthyristors (GTOs), and superconducting fault-current limiters\n[1]\u2013[6]. Some of these devices, such as the electronically\ncontrolled fuses, are of a single shot design. Following an\noperation, the supply to the load is lost until the device is\nreplaced. Other devices such as tuned LC circuits and those\nwhich limit the fault current by inserting a fixed impedance\nin the circuit are usually sensitive to the network condition\n(e.g., the short-circuit level) and fault location [2]\u2013[6]. Fast\ncurrent interrupting devices, such as fuses or solid-state circuit\nbreakers, are only useful for certain applications, such as the\nbus-tie location or for the protection of single loads. These\ndevices can interrupt the current almost instantaneously, but\nare not able to sustain its flow for a sufficient time [7] which is\nrequired for protection coordination with relays in the overall\nprotection scheme [8]. Superconducting fault-current limiters\noften have a slow recovery time, which makes them difficult to\nuse if the protected power circuit requires autoreclosure [9].\nDespite the successes of previous devices in many targeted\napplications, there is still the need for new devices of better us-\nability and controllability while remaining affordable. A single\ndevice that integrates the two functions of fault-current limiting\nand interrupting would be desirable in order to reduce the overall\nswitchgear cost [6].\nThe practical success of a fault-current limiter relies on its de-\nsign with respect to the intended application. In general, a fault-\ncurrent limiter is desired to have the following performance\ncharacteristics:\n\u2022 low or zero impedance during normal operation;\n\u2022 high and controllable impedance during faults;\n\u2022 fast transition from normal conducting to current-limiting\nmodes without causing excessive voltage spikes;\n\u2022 fast recovery after fault interruption (necessary for appli-\ncations that require autoreclosure);\n\u2022 no adverse effects on the selectivity of the overall protec-\ntion scheme (allow protection coordination);\n\u2022 high reliability and fail-safe operation;\n\u2022 low cost with minimum maintenance requirements;\n\u2022 capability to tolerate and ride through currents associated\nwith normal overload, transformer inrush current, motor\nstarting and energizing a capacitor bank.\n0885-8977\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\n1998 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 21, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2006\nThis paper presents the development of a new device which\ncombines the two functions of limiting and interrupting the\nshort-circuit current. This device is thus called a fault-current\nlimiting and interrupting device (FCLID). The device is ex-\npected to limit the short-circuit current and maintain it for a\nconsiderable period of time which is necessary for protection\ncoordination. The current may be eventually interrupted by the\ndevice itself if other protective relays in the system fail to clear\nthe fault. For the reasons to become clearer later in this paper,\nthis presents serious challenges, particularly on the energy\nhandling capability of the main components used and the\nprotection of the FCLID itself. Such issues are analyzed in this\nstudy and solutions are suggested to satisfy the requirements. A\nprototype FCLID is developed using the knowledge obtained.\nThe study serves as a stepping stone for developing FCLIDs of\nhigher voltage and current ratings.\nIn the project, the authors have generically investigated\nseveral aspects including the switch topologies [10], the energy\nhandling capability of the varistors used [11], as well as the\ntransient harmonic requirements of the distribution network\n[12]. This paper aims to describe the overall design of the\nFCLID prototype including the component selection, control\nparameters, and the protection of its devices. Section II reviews\nthe operating principles and characteristics of the proposed\nFCLID. Section III analyzes the factors affecting the thermal\nstress on the main components of the FCLID. The control\nparameters and component ratings of the FCLID are then\ndetermined in Section IV. Section V presents a protection\nscheme for the FCLID when used in practical applications\nwhere uncertainty of the distribution network is inevitable. Ex-\nperimental test results of the prototyped FCLID are presented\nin Section VI.\nII. FAULT CURRENT LIMITING AND INTERRUPTING DEVICE\nThe configuration of the FCLID incorporated in a single-\nphase distribution network is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a\nfast acting, bidirectional switch realized using power semicon-\nductor devices [insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and\ndiodes as shown in the figure], a varistor (nonlinear resistor),\nand a snubber circuit, all connected in parallel.\nThere are alternative ways to construct the switch [7], [13].\nThe topology shown in Fig. 1 was chosen after considering the\nconduction and switching losses and transients associated with\nthe reverse recovery current of the diodes.\nDuring normal operation of the power network, the IGBTs\nin the synthesized switch are always gated on. Since the IGBTs\nconduct permanently during this steady-state period, there will\nbe an associated onstate power loss which accounts for about 1%\nof the rated load power. In order to reduce this loss, the FCLID\nmay be bypassed using, for example, a vacuum circuit breaker\n(VCB), as shown in the dashed lines in Fig. 1. The VCB opens\non detecting a short-circuit fault in the downstream power net-\nwork. The VCB controller may be designed such that it ensures\nthat before opening, the fault level is within the FCLID capa-\nbility. Otherwise, the VCB remains closed and the fault is dealt\nwith by upstream protective devices\u2014for example, a fuse.\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the FCLID.\nThe semiconductor device (IGBT) initially conducts the fault\ncurrent until it reaches a preset value at which instant it\nis turned off. The fault current is thus diverted to the snubber\ncircuit and varistor. The snubber circuit helps to damp the high\ndv\/dt that appears during the initial stage of the IGBT turn-off\nprocess. During this stage, the snubber capacitor is charged\n(and, hence, becomes inactive) and the varistor current starts\nto build up rapidly. The clamping voltage of the varistor is set\nhigher than the peak supply voltage. Therefore, the current in\nthe circuit will start to decrease when this voltage is reached,\nfollowing an decay (1) as the source voltage can be\nconsidered constant in the relatively short interval within a\nswitching cycle. The semiconductor switch is turned on again\nto re-establish the current when it reduces to a preset low value\n. The current will again follow the trajectory of an\ncircuit, as given by (2). The current response in the circuit when\nthe switch is turned on and turned off is shown in Fig. 2. The\nvaristor voltage is almost constant when the varistor is in the\nclamping state\n(1)\n(2)\nIn the above equations, and are the total series resistance\nand inductance in the circuit, and is the varistor clamping\nvoltage.

The latter case is\nconsidered in this work, where the limited fault current is inter-\nrupted when the switch in the FCLID is permanently gated off\nat s, as shown in Fig. 2. The fault can then be isolated\nusing an isolator which does not need to have a high breaking\nduty.\nAHMED et al.: DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE FAULT CURRENT LIMITING DEVICE 1999\nFig. 2. Current response of the FCLID.\nFig. 3. FCLID installed in a typical distribution network.\nFig. 3 shows a possible way of installing the FCLID in a typ-\nical low-voltage (230\/400 V) three-phase distribution feeder.\nBusbar A is the point of common coupling (PCC) with other\ncable feeders. Without the fault current limiter, the prospective\npeak short-circuit current at the PCC is typically about 25 kA\nand the maximum load current is about 400 A in total. The fault\ncurrent reduces along the feeder length with the lowest value\n(which depends on the feeder impedance) being at the far end\nof the feeder. As the purpose of this project is to prove the con-\ncept of the FCLID, a single-phase prototype with reduced cur-\nrent ratings was developed. Without the FCLID, the prospec-\ntive peak short-circuit currents at Load 1, Load 2, Load 3, and\nLoad 4 were assumed as 3, 2.5, 1.7, and 1 kA, respectively. The\nnormal load current is assumed to be less than 50 A. Thus, the\nvalue of of the prototype FCLID is set at 120 A which is\nsufficiently higher than the peak value of the rated load current\nA. This means that the maximum limited short-circuit\ncurrent in the feeder is 120 A. The supply X\/R ratio is set to 5,\nA and intended current limiting time s.\nA feature of the developed FCLID is that, disregarding the lo-\ncation of the fault or supply system condition, the general profile\nof the limited current is determined by and . Further-\nmore, and can be adjusted in a subcycle time scale to\ncontrol the harmonic content of the current [14].\nIn addition to the controllability over the profile of the lim-\nited short-circuit current, the following features of the developed\nFCLID can also be expected based on the above description of\nits operating principles.\n1) The device inherently integrates the two functions of fault-\ncurrent limiting and interrupting.\n2) The current limiting function is achieved via the insertion\nof a varistor. The varistor needs to absorb the stored en-\nergy associated with the inductive current in the circuit.\nThe power dissipation in the varistor needs to be carefully\nconsidered so that the FCLID can operate for the targeted\nperiod of time.\n3) During the operation of the FCLID, the rate of change\nof current is determined by the total series inductance in\nthe circuit, which depends on the supply system condition\nand fault location. Therefore, these factors will affect the\nswitching frequency of the FCLID and, hence, switching\npower losses in the semiconductor devices.\n4) The varistor presents its clamping voltage to the rest of\nthe circuit when conducting but the supply source voltage\nis time variant. Therefore, the switching frequency is not\nconstant even within a half fundamental cycle, which will\nfurther affect the power loss profile.\nIn some damp and\/or contaminated environments (such as\ncostal areas), intermittent faults in distribution networks\u2019 ca-\nbles can occur quite frequently [15]. One planned application\nof the developed FCLID is to provide a sustained current in\nsuch cables for a period long enough to \u201cburn\u201d the intermittent\nfault into a permanent one and, hence, assist in identifying the\nfault location. It is expected that this will reduce the number\nof call-outs that the network operator will receive. This high-\nlights the importance of the FCLID in providing a limited but\nsustained short-circuit current.\nIII. EFFECTS OF OPERATING CONDITIONS\nAND CONTROL PARAMETERS\nAnalytical calculations and numerical simulations in the time\ndomain are used to guide the design of the FCLID. Internal\nvariables of the device have been examined under different op-\nerating conditions. To simplify the calculations, the analytical\nmethod is based on approximations, such as those made in de-\nriving (1) and (2). The results of analytical calculation provide\nvaluable insight to help identify the important factors that af-\nfect the design choices. Numerical simulation is based on more\ndetailed representation of the system conditions and component\ncharacteristics. The results from the simulation are used to de-\ntermine the required ratings of the components.\nFig. 4 shows the relationship between the energy to be ab-\nsorbed by the varistor per 20 ms (based on a constant rate) during\ncurrent limiting operation and the short-circuit current level of\nthe supply system as measured at the fault location. The results\nof Fig. 4 show that the energy dissipation rate of the varistor is\nnearly constant irrespective of the short-circuit level. More de-\ntails about the mechanism giving rise to the power dissipation\nin the varistor are given in [11].\nThe effect of the system short-circuit current level on the av-\nerage switching frequency of the FCLID is shown in Fig. 5. As\nthe short-circuit level increases, the semiconductor switching\nfrequency and, hence, the switching losses increase proportion-\nally. Therefore, the FCLID controller need to be designed such\nthat it inhibits the FCLID operation whenever the short-circuit\nlevel is above its rating.\nIt can be deduced from the result shown in Fig. 2 that as\nincreases, the shape of the current waveform improves and\n2000 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 21, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2006\nFig. 4. Varistor energy dissipation as affected by the short-circuit level.\nFig. 5. Relationship between switching frequency and short-circuit level.\nbetter resembles a sine wave [12]. This reduces the low-order\nharmonic content in the system current at the expense of in-\ncreasing the high-frequency components which are generally\neasier to deal with. However, both the switching losses and the\nvaristor energy dissipation will increase, as shown in Figs. 6 and\n7. Fig. 6 shows the varistor energy dissipation (per 20 ms) as af-\nfected by when is fixed at 120 A. As increases to\nreduce the current tolerance band, the average varistor current\nincreases and so does its energy dissipation. Fig. 7 shows that\nthe average switching frequency of the FCLID also increases\ndramatically with as implied by (1) and (2). Therefore, in\npractice, is to be set adequately low (relative to ) in\norder to avoid excessive stresses on the semiconductor switch\nand the varistor.\nIV. DESIGN OF THE PROTOTYPE FCLID\nThe objective of this project is to design and build a single-\nphase 230-V FCLID prototype with specifications as described\nin Section II. These specifications have been determined just\nfor this study, as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d to demonstrate the prin-\nciples of the FCLID. As explained in Section II, the presence\nof the VCB shown in Fig. 2 is not essential for the operation of\nthe FCLID. The VCB may be added if it becomes necessary to\nFig. 6. Relationship between varistor energy dissipation and I .\nFig. 7. Relationship between switching frequency and I .\navoid the IGBT onstate power loss during system normal oper-\nation. Therefore, to simplify the design of the prototype, it was\nassumed that the FCLID is not bypassed by a VCB and that the\nbidirectional switch in the FCLID is constantly gated on before\nfault occurrence.\nIn the design of the FCLID prototype, the following major\naspects are the main considerations.\nA. Interruption Time\nThe interruption time is the time from the moment when the\ninstantaneous value of the network current exceeds a threshold\npreset value (after fault occurrence) to the first interruption of\nthe fault current by the semiconductor switch in the FCLID. This\ntime consists of the detection time, switch triggering time, and\nswitch turn-off time. If the interruption time is too long, due\nto, for instance, a slow response of the measuring and control\ncomponents, then the actual current (at the moment of interrup-\ntion) may be more than that which the semiconductor switch can\nsafely interrupt. For the short-circuit levels and dc offset antic-\nipated in practice, it has been determined in this study that the\ninterruption time should be no more than 10 s to prevent mal-\nfunction of or damage to the FCLID [10]. The response time of\na Hall effect current transducer is less than 500 ns and the IGBT\nAHMED et al.: DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE FAULT CURRENT LIMITING DEVICE 2001\nturn-on and turn-off times are normally less than 1 s. There-\nfore, the total interruption time can be practically kept within\n2 s including all controller delays.\nIf the FCLID is initially bypassed by a VCB, the interruption\ntime is extended correspondingly to include the response time\nof the VCB. Thus, the FCLID operation starts after the VCB\noperation and subsequent extinction of the arc.\nB. Selection of the Switching Element\nThe bidirectional semiconductor switch must satisfy a set of\nrequirements and there are several alternative components avail-\nable which could deliver the desired performance. The technical\naspects to be considered are\n\u2022 rated voltage;\n\u2022 maximum controllable current (the maximum pulsating\ncurrent for the switch);\n\u2022 turn on and turn off times;\n\u2022 switching frequency and switching losses;\n\u2022 maximum acceptable junction temperature;\n\u2022 gate driver circuit.\nFor high-voltage and current applications, the GTO has been\nthe dominant choice for a fully controllable semiconductor\nswitch due to its large current and offstate voltage capabili-\nties. However, it has a limited switching frequency and high\nswitching losses and requires a complex gate drive circuit.\nCompared with the GTO, the integrated gate-commutated\nthyristor (IGCT) has the advantages of lower losses per rated\nkilovolt-amperes, faster switching, and higher reliability. The\nIGCT is not used in this work because the developed proto-\ntype is designed for low-voltage applications. IGBTs have\nbecome popular in low- and medium-voltage applications.\nWith the introduction of the high-voltage IGBT and IGCT,\nthey present a challenge to the dominance of the aging GTO.\nA 1200-V, 300-A (pulsating current) IGBT has been chosen\nfor developing the FCLID in this study because it better meets\nthe requirements listed above. Voltage and current margins\nare provided. The varistor inherently prevents any transient\novervoltages from developing across the IGBT. Without the\nvaristor, transient overvoltages can appear across the IGBT\nduring current interruption as a result of the energy stored in\nthe network inductance . It should be noted that\nduring the short-circuit period, the network is normally highly\ninductive.\nIn order to define the maximum operation time of the FCLID,\nthe junction temperature of the selected IGBT has been evalu-\nated for the operating conditions anticipated in practice. Fig. 8\nshows the junction temperature of the IGBT with different\nsystem short-circuit current levels . It is assumed that\nthe FCLID starts to limit the current from s and the\ncontrol strategy is the same as stated before,\nA and A. The initial junction temperature of the\nIGBT is assumed to be 40 C and the rated maximum junction\ntemperature is 125 C. The transient thermal impedance [16]\nof the selected IGBT stabilizes after about 0.2 s, after which\ntime, the increase in the junction temperature is not significant.\nFurther calculations confirmed that the IGBT, of appropriate\ncurrent rating, could work safely for a period of up to 2 s even\nwith 10 kA.\nFig. 8. IGBT junction temperature.\nC. Selection of the Varistor\nMetal\u2013oxide varistors (MOV) are normally -type\nZnO-based ceramic semiconductor devices. They show a\nhighly nonlinear current-voltage (I\u2013V) characteristic similar to\nthat of a back-to-back Zener diode pair (ignoring the forward\nconduction). Selection of the varistor for the FCLID is a three\nstep process.\nStep 1) defining the necessary steady-state voltage profile\nduring the FCLID operation;\nStep 2) selecting a type of varistor to provide the required\nvoltage clamping characteristic;\nStep 3) evaluating the energy absorption requirement of the\nvaristor during the FCLID operation.\nThe most critical aspect required for the correct specification\nof the varistor in the FCLID is the energy to be absorbed by the\ndevice. The energy handling capability of the varistor is defined\nas the amount of energy that the varistor is required to absorb\nwithout any failure or damage. In order for the varistor to operate\nsafely, it should be able to absorb this energy before its tempera-\nture rises to a damaging level as this would cause a short circuit\nthrough the varistor. The energy rating of a varistor is usually\nspecified in a manufacturer\u2019s data sheet for a single shot oper-\nation. However, these data do not specify whether the varistor\nis suitable for repetitive energy absorption, as is the case during\nthe FCLID operation. Therefore, an experimental study on the\nenergy handling capability was performed which revealed that\nwhen the varistor is subjected to continuous repetitive pulses, it\ncan handle a total energy about 50% higher than the rating for\na single pulse (specified in the manufacturer\u2019s data sheet) [11].\nThe total energy can be calculated from the rate (per 20 ms)\nshown in Fig. 4 and the time of operation. This gives energy\ndissipation in each varistor used in the proposed prototype of\nabout 1200 J for a 0.8-s period of the FCLID operation. The\nenergy per pulse rating, as specified in the data sheet of the se-\nlected varistor, is 880 J [17].\nThe energy rating required by the FCLID can be, as in the\npresent case, higher than that provided by a single varistor.\nIn order to achieve the required energy absorption, this study\nproposes to operate multiple varistors in parallel. However,\n2002 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 21, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2006\nFig. 9. Varistor unequal current sharing.\nFig. 10. Varistor equalized current sharing.\nthe matching of varistor characteristics is extremely difficult\ndue to the nonlinearity of the I\u2013V relationship [17]. One of\nthe paralleled varistors would tend to conduct the majority\nof the current leading to failure of that device and then cas-\ncaded failure of the other MOVs. To prevent the failure, the\nauthors employed a method to equalize the current sharing. In\nthis method, each varistor is connected in series with a small\nresistor which adds to the onstate dynamic resistance of the\nvaristor, but has little effect on the offstate resistance. Fig. 9\nshows the currents measured in two directly paralleled varistors\nin an experimental setup, featuring unequal sharing. Fig. 10\nshows the equalized current sharing with 5- series resistance\nfor each varistor. Tests were carried out to illustrate the effects\nof the series resistance. Table I shows the effect on the peak\ncurrent sharing between two varistors, while Table II shows the\neffect on the peak voltage across the designed FCLID during\nvaristor clamping when the semiconductor switch is turned\noff. It is clear that the higher the resistance is, the better the\ncurrent sharing will be. It is also clear that the peak voltage\nacross the FCLID increases with the resistance. When the series\nresistance is below 5 , the voltage increase is less than 10%\nof the nominal clamping voltage (600 V). This has little effect\non the voltage rating of the semiconductor switch.\nTABLE I\nEFFECT OF THE SERIES RESISTANCE ON THE CURRENT SHARING\nTABLE II\nEFFECT OF THE SERIES RESISTANCE ON THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE FCLID\nFig. 11. Temperature prediction of the IGBT.\nIn the present study, eight standard varistors, each with a se-\nries resistor of 5 , have been connected in parallel to achieve\nthe required energy rating for the prototype FCLID. Data of the\nvaristors are given in Section VI. Due to the equalized current\nsharing, the energy handling capability of the parallel combina-\ntion could be significantly improved compared to unequal cur-\nrent sharing.\nV. PROTECTION OF THE FCLID\nAs described in Section IV-C, the energy absorption capa-\nbility of the varistors can be increased with equalized current\nsharing. Also, as explained in Section IV-B, the FCLID may be\ndesigned such that the junction temperature of the controlled\nIGBT switch is kept within the limits specified by a manufac-\nturer\u2019s data sheets. Despite this, the FCLID will no doubt ex-\nperience uncertain operating conditions in practice, including\nuncertainties in the system short-circuit level, ambient tempera-\nture, and required operating time. This is further complicated by\nthe fact that the characteristics of the components are temper-\nature dependent. For instance, the switching time of an IGBT\nis significantly increased as the junction temperature rises, in-\ncreasing the switching losses [18]. It is therefore important to\ndevise a real-time protection scheme for the FCLID. In this\nwork, a method to predict the junction temperature of the IGBT\nin transient conditions has been developed. The instantaneous\nvalues of the device current and voltage were used to calcu-\nlate the power losses in the semiconductor switching devices. A\ncomputer model is employed to predict the instantaneous junc-\ntion temperature of the component based on the transient\nthermal impedance model [16] and the measured case tempera-\nture as shown in Fig. 11.\nFig. 12 shows the predicted junction temperature, using mea-\nsured IGBT current i(t) and voltage v(t) of the FCLID prototype\nin a test that lasted for 1 s. The accuracy of the method is depen-\ndent on the accuracy of the voltage, current, and case tempera-\nture measurements in addition to the accuracy of the synthesized\ntransient thermal impedance model of the IGBT. Transducers\nAHMED et al.: DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE FAULT CURRENT LIMITING DEVICE 2003\nFig. 12. Prediction of the IGBT junction temperature.\nTABLE III\nFCLID SPECIFICATIONS AND COMPONENT PARAMETERS\nwith wide frequency bandwidth are essential to capture the fast\nswitching edges. The method to predict the junction tempera-\nture was verified in a destructive test.\nThe same concept of temperature prediction may also be ap-\nplied to the prediction of the varistor temperature since the re-\nlationship between the input energy to the varistor and its tem-\nperature is linear, within the thermal stability region [11].\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nThe analytical and simulation results described in the pre-\nceding sections were used to develop a single-phase FCLID\nprototype, based on the specifications presented in Section II.\nThe parameters of the selected components are summarized in\nTable III. The solid-state switch is comprised of two IGBTs with\nbuilt in inverse-parallel diodes, which gives it the ability to block\nhigh voltage in both directions. In addition, a simple RC snubber\ncircuit was connected across the switch to protect the device\nfrom the high dv\/dt effect during the initial part of the turnoff\nprocess. Eight varistors were connected in parallel to share the\ncurrent when the solid-state switch is turned off and clamp the\nvoltage to a safe limit.\nFig. 13 shows a photograph of the developed FCLID pro-\ntotype. The VCB was not included in the design in order to\nFig. 13. Photograph of the prototyped FCLID.\nFig. 14. Current waveform.\nsimplify the development of the prototype, as explained in\nSection IV. To test the prototype, it was connected as shown in\nFig. 1 and its performance was evaluated for short-circuit faults\non the load side (initiated by closing the switch across the load).\nFig. 14 shows the waveform of the short-circuit current being\nlimited to approximately 120 A (peak) for a period of 0.8 s. The\nload current before the fault occurrence was set to 18 A rms and\nthe prospective short-circuit current was measured to be 3 kA\nrms. The fault was initiated at = 40 ms and the FCLID started\nto operate immediately afterward where the IGBT began to\nswitch on and off in order to keep the current between\nand . The fault was cleared at a preset time ms by\nkeeping the IGBTs gated off. The small current that flows after\nthis time is the leakage current through the varistor, which can\nbe completely interrupted by an isolator (Fig. 1) if required.\nIt can be noted that the first peak of the short-circuit current,\nshown in Fig. 2 as , is not present in Fig. 14. This is because\nthe VCB was not implemented in the prototype. Also, was\nset to approximately 120 A and to nearly 0 A in this test.\nNote that the current shown in Fig. 14 was externally measured\nand contained some noise caused by radio-frequency interfer-\nence (RFI) from fast current switching of the FCLID. A mag-\nnified section of the current waveform (for a fundamental cycle\nwhen the noise level is low) is shown in Fig. 15, with a redefined\ntime scale.\n2004 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 21, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2006\nFig. 15. Magnified section of the current waveform.\nThe current waveform shown in Fig. 15 is similar to the sim-\nulated one shown in Fig. 2; the switching frequency is different\ndue to different system parameters. As the laboratory experi-\nment was carried out without the bypassing VCB, the FCLID\nin the experiment was activated by a slightly different mecha-\nnism to that illustrated in Fig. 2. In the experiment, the IGBTs in\nthe FCLID were initially gated on and were first gated off upon\ndetecting the line current reaching 120 A which activated the\nFCLID ON\/OFF operation. As explained in Section IV-A, the cur-\nrent will further increase during the controller interruption time,\nbut this increase is relatively small (about 2.6 A in 2 s) when\nthe IGBT would actually turn off. A further increase of the cur-\nrent can be estimated according to where is the\ncircuit inductance. Obviously the longer the delay is following\nactivation, the higher would be the current increase which the\nIGBT must be able to safely turn off. Reference [10] reported a\nstudy which shows, for typical applications in a 230\/400-V dis-\ntribution network, a maximum delay of up to 10 s is possible\nwhich gives a current rise of about 13.3 A. This current rise is\nrelatively small and may be easily taken care of by careful se-\nlecting the IGBT current rating.\nIn the experimental tests conducted, once the FCLID was ac-\ntivated, it remained in the current limiting mode until it was\nexternally stopped and the fault current was permanently inter-\nrupted. In practice, certain indicators may be used to decide how\nlong the FCLID should stay in the current limiting mode. This\ncould be a preset signal determined by the operator (based on\nsystem conditions) or a signal from the real-time thermal pro-\ntection scheme described in Section V. If the fault is cleared by a\ndownstream protective device, the FCLID can automatically re-\nturn to the full conduction mode since the current will no longer\nreach and the IGBTs will remain in the on state.\nThe possibility of scaling up the voltage and current ratings\nof the FCLID is important when dealing with high-power ap-\nplications. The proposed architecture of the FCLID assists in\nconnecting series\/parallel devices to achieve high-voltage\/cur-\nrent ratings.\nIGBTs have a positive temperature coefficient and, therefore,\nit is relatively easy to operate them in parallel to obtain high\nFig. 16. Series connection of switches.\ncurrent ratings [16]. Therefore, the current capability of the\nFCLID can be increased by increasing the number of varistors\nand IGBTs connected in parallel.\nA known difficulty for the high-voltage applications is to\nconnect IGBTs in series to achieve the required voltage rating.\nWhile active gate drive could be utilized to improve voltage\nsharing among series-connected IGBTs [19], the proposed\nFCLID implement varistors in its structure which (due to their\nnonlinear characteristics) can assist in equalizing the voltage\nsharing. In line with the circuit topology and control scheme\nof this study, Fig. 16 shows an envisaged scheme in which the\nvaristors used within the FCLID can be used to assist the IGBT\nvoltage sharing.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe development of a 120-A solid-state FCLID is presented\nin this paper. Based on the analysis, simulation, and experi-\nmental tests, the following can be concluded.\n1) The FCLID can inherently perform two integrated func-\ntions: limiting and interrupting the short-circuit current. A\nswitching strategy is proposed to control the limited cur-\nrent when the network condition and fault location vary.\n2) This FCLID is able to limit a prospective short-circuit cur-\nrent of 3 kA (rms) to 120 A (peak). The FCLID can respond\nquickly after the fault occurrence.\n3) Based on the FCLID requirement and characteristics of the\navailable switching devices, IGBTs were chosen for this\napplication.\n4) An effective method for improving the current sharing be-\ntween parallel varistors has been implemented and the re-\nquired energy rating of the varistors for the FCLID appli-\ncation has been achieved.\n5) The developed prototype FCLID is capable of limiting the\nfault current for up to 0.8 s, which is sufficient to enable\nseveral types of practical applications.\n6) Prediction of the junction temperature of the IGBT and\nvaristor leads to fully protected and fail-safe operation of\nthe FCLID.\nThe technology used in this high-speed, multifunction, and\nmultishot system provides useful experience for developing\nhigher-current FCLIDs for 11-kV distribution networks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis paper describes part of a development work which is\ncovered by Patent GB2375902 [14].\nAHMED et al.: DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE FAULT CURRENT LIMITING DEVICE 2005\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
