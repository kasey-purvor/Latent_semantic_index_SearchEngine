In a\nrecent compilation @2#, more than 700 isomers were recorded\nas having half-lives greater than one millisecond. In the vast\nmajority of these cases, the isomerism is a result of angular-\nmomentum selection rules for the decay radiations, with high\nmultipolarity radiations having low transition rates. In only\none case is the transition rate so low that the isomer survives\nin nature: 180Ta has an I59\\ , 75 keV excitation with a\nhalf-life in excess of 1015 yr for, potentially, multipolarity-\neight ~256-pole! electromagnetic decay to the I51\\ ground\nstate.\nThe region of prolate-deformed nuclei around 180Ta (Z\n573, N5107) is well known to contain some long-lived,\nhighly excited (.1 MeV! isomers, with the hafnium (Z\n572) isotopes being of particular note @1,3#. For example,\nthere is a 31-yr, Ip5161 isomer at 2.4 MeV in 178Hf, which\nhas a stable ground state, and new isomers have recently\nbeen discovered in neutron-rich hafnium isotopes @4#. How-\never, the angular-momentum and excitation-energy limits to\nthe formation of such isomers remain to be determined, both\nas a result of the difficulty in obtaining appropriate experi-\nmental information, and due to the lack of a suitable, realistic\ntheoretical framework. It is the latter aspect that is addressed\nin the present work. At the same time, significant experimen-\ntal advances are being made with the use of deep-inelastic\n@4# and fragmentation @5# reactions.\nIn the general understanding, the formation of highly ex-\ncited isomers in the prolate-deformed mass-180 region of\nnuclei is, to a large extent, due to the conservation of the\nangular-momentum projection quantum number K, associ-\nated with an axially symmetric shape, and long-lived isomers\nusually have low excitation energies compared to collective\nexcitations of the same angular momentum @1#. The 178Hf\n31-yr isomer, for example, is yrast, i.e., the Ip5Kp5161\nisomer, at 2.4 MeV, is the lowest-energy I516\\ state in that\nnucleus.

In contrast, Hilton and Mang @8# focused on\nthe collective rotation of the 180Hf nucleus ~without discuss-\ning multiquasiparticle states! and predicted, remarkably, that\nwell-deformed oblate collective rotation coexists and be-\ncomes lower in energy than the prolate collective rotation in\nthe high-spin region of I.26\\ . Hence, the question arises as\nto whether the prolate noncollective isomers compete with\nthe oblate collective rotation.

Calculated total Routhian surfaces at \\v50.2 MeV ~left!, \\v50.3 MeV ~center!, and \\v50.4 MeV ~right! for 182Hf, with 200\nkeV contours. For the first two panels, there are three potential-energy minima, corresponding to prolate-collective rotation (g50\u00b0, top!,\noblate-collective rotation (g5260\u00b0, middle!, and prolate noncollective rotation (g52120\u00b0, bottom!. The absolute minimum in each panel\nis represented by a dot. For the third panel, the prolate-collective minimum disappears, and a highly deformed near-prolate state (b2\n\u20190.38, I>45\\) appears but its energy is far from yrast. Note that each potential-energy minimum has, in general, a different angular-\nmomentum value; and the quantitative evaluation of the prolate noncollective mode requires a configuration-constrained approach where the\npotential-energy minimum is represented at g;0\u00b0 @9#. See also Table I.The total energy of a configuration consists of a macro-\nscopic part which is obtained from the stardard liquid-drop\nmodel @14# and a microscopic part resulting from the Strutin-\nsky shell correction @15#, dEshell5ELN2E\u02dc Strut . Calculations\nare performed in the lattice of quadrupole (b2 ,g) deforma-\ntions with hexadecapole (b4) variation. We have investi-\ngated low-lying high-K states for the even hafnium isotopes.\nResults show that all the studied multiquasiparticle states\nhave well-deformed prolate shapes. The axially symmetric\nshape is one of the important conditions for the existence of\nK isomers. The calculated excitation energies agree with the\ndata for the observed isomers. For example, for the 178Hf\n31-yr isomer, the calculated energy of 2470 keV agrees well\nwith the experimental value of 2447 keV @2#. Additional\ncomparisons are given in Ref. @9#.\nIn order to predict isomers, we also need to see whether\nthe multiquasiparticle states are yrast. Therefore, for the\ncompeting collective rotational states we have performed\npairing-deformation self-consistent total Routhian surface\n~TRS! calculations, i.e., for a given rotational frequency,\npairing is treated self-consistently by solving the cranked LN\nequation at any given point of the deformation lattice\n(b2 ,g ,b4) and then the equilibrium deformation is deter-\nmined by minimizing the obtained TRS ~for details, see, e.g.,\n@16,17#!. Quadrupole pairing in doubly stretched coordinate\nspace @18# has a negligible effect on energies, but it is in-\ncluded ~with the strength determined by restoring the local\nGalilean invariance! because it has an important influence on\ncollective angular momenta @17#.\nCalculations for the mass-180 region show that oblate or01430approximately oblate rotational states exist at high spin. The\nosmium (Z576) and platinum (Z578) isotopes have ap-\nproximately oblate rotations with small deformations of b2\n,0.20 and become triaxial with increasing spin, which is\nconsistent with the results of previous work @19#. The Z\n572 hafnium isotopes, however, have axially symmetric col-\nlective rotational bands. In the low-spin region, well-\ndeformed prolate rotation is favored. However, at I;20\\\n~depending on the neutron number! well-deformed (b2\n.0.20) oblate collective minima appear and become ener-\ngetically lower than the prolate collective minima for heavy\nhafnium isotopes. As shown below for 182Hf, the prolate and\noblate minima are, in general, well separated in the b22g\nquadrupole-deformation space. Therefore, our results are in-\nsensitive to shape-mixing effects ~cf. Valor et al. @20#!.\nThe appearance of energetically favored, oblate collective\nminima is in agreement with the previous Hartree-Fock-\nBogiliubov results of Hilton and Mang @8# for 180Hf. We find\nthat, for a range of isotopes covering at least 178Hf to 186Hf,\nthe oblate rotation mode has a stable shape up to very high\nspins. The oblate rotation has a large kinematic moment of\ninertia of ;100\\2 MeV21, due to nucleon alignments ~see\nlater!, which lead to the moment of inertia being slightly\nlarger than the corresponding classical oblate rigid-body\nvalue of ;80\\2 MeV21. Figure 1 shows the calculated\nTRS\u2019s for the neutron-rich isotope, 182Hf. For this isotope,\nthe calculated TRS displays a clear oblate minimum at \\v\n50.20 MeV ~see the left panel of Fig. 1!. This minimum gets\ndeeper with increasing rotational frequency and becomes the\nenergetically favored collective state at \\v\u20190.30 MeV ~see1-2\nLIMIT TO HIGH-SPIN ISOMERISM IN HAFNIUM ISOTOPES PHYSICAL REVIEW C 62 014301the central panel of Fig. 1!.

The\nprolate collective mode terminates at \\v;0.4 MeV (I\n;26\\), i.e., where the potential energy minimum disappears\n~see the right panel of Fig. 1!. A similar effect was previ-\nously noted in 186Os TRS calculations @21#.\nComparison can now be made with configuration-\nconstrained calculations. Figure 2 shows the energies of\nprolate-collective, oblate-collective, and multiquasiparticle\nexcitations. We can see that at low spins prolate rotation is\nenergetically favored, but at higher spins multiquasiparticle\nexcitations become yrast. With increasing neutron number,\nthe prolate-collective deformations (b2) decrease slightly,\nresulting in decreased moments of inertia and hence in-\ncreased rotational excitation energies. In contrast, with in-\ncreasing neutron number ~i.e., raising the Fermi level!\nhigher-V orbitals will condense around the Fermi level\n~where V is the individual nucleon contribution to K) which\nimplies that multiquasiparticle states can gain more angular\nmomentum at a given excitation energy. The above two facts\nlead to high-K excitations being progressively more favored\nTABLE I.

The\nvery low excitation energies, combined with axially symmet-\nric shapes, suggests high-multipolarity decays and long half-\nlives, though the slightly smaller b2 values for the more\nneutron-rich isotopes may lead to significantly increased K\nmixing. Only after reaching I>35\\ does the yrast status of\nthe multiquasiparticle excitations become limited by oblate-\ncollective rotation, for isotopes with 104<N<110 ~see\n182Hf in Fig. 2! and even this limitation does not appear to\napply to the more neutron-rich isotopes ~see 186Hf in Fig. 2!.\nAlthough the calculated oblate bands become lower in en-\nergy with increasing neutron number, the multiquasiparticle\nexcitations become lower still ~comparing 186Hf with 182Hf\nin Fig. 2!. In the present work, we restrict ourselves to the\ncalculation of high-K configurations with seniority up to 10\n~corresponding to I;40\\) which appear to be within experi-\nmental reach. For angular momenta approaching 40\\ , some\nof the multiquasiparticle configurations can become slightly\ng deformed ~see Table I!. The g deformations may limit the\nhalf-lives of the isomers, due to the consequent K-mixing\neffects, but this also opens up interesting perspectives for\nstimulated deexcitations @1,6#.\nThe appearance of deep oblate-collective minima is due to\nboth neutron and proton rotational alignments. These rein-\nforcing alignment effects lead to the special favoring of the\noblate mode in the neutron-rich hafnium isotopes. In 182Hf,\nfor example, two i13\/2 neutrons align at \\v\u20190.2 MeV, two\nh11\/2 protons align at \\v\u20190.25 MeV, and at \\v\u20190.3 MeV\na second pair of i13\/2 neutrons align. With increasing neutron\nnumber the i13\/2 neutrons align earlier, which results in ear-\nlier crossings between prolate and oblate collective bands\n~comparing, for example, 186Hf with 182Hf in Fig. 2!. It can\nbe seen that both the multiquasiparticle and the oblate-\ncollective states in 186Hf have significantly lower energies\nthan those in 182Hf. Thus, 186Hf may provide the best case\nFIG. 2.

WYSS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 62 014301for experimental investigation of very long-lived isomers and\nthe oblate-rotation mode.\nAt prolate deformations, when valence nucleons lie in the\nbottom part ~low-V region! of a high-j subshell, usually one\npair of low-V nucleons will align at I;14\\ due to strong\nCoriolis interactions, and the rotation-aligned bands ~S\nbands! become yrast @22#. However, when nucleon numbers\nare increased and the upper orbitals ~with high V) are filled,\nthe prolate alignments will no longer be favored. In contrast,\nat oblate deformations it is the upper orbitals that have low-\nV values, and consequently oblate rotational alignments be-\ncome favored. For the neutron-rich hafnium isotopes, the\nneutron Fermi level lies in the upper part of the i13\/2 subshell\n~the N582\u2013 126 shell is about 70% filled! and, at the same\ntime, the proton Fermi level lies in the upper part of the h11\/2\nsubshell ~the Z550\u2013 82 shell is also about 70% filled!.\nHence, both neutrons and protons favor oblate rotational\nalignments. It is no accident that the very same shell fillings\nthat lead to very-high-K yrast configurations also lead to\ncompeting oblate rotation-aligned states.\nThe reinforcing effect of neutron and proton shell fillings\non nuclear shapes has been well documented in the mass-80\nregion @23#. For comparison with the mass-180 region, we\nperformed calculations for the 88Ru nucleus, where a strong01430reinforcing effect of the proton g9\/2 and neutron g9\/2 subshell\nfillings is expected, with the respective valence shells each\napproximately 70% filled ~i.e., corresponding to the situation\nfor 186Hf). Similar oblate rotation is predicted. However, it is\ncalculated to be far from yrast, and is therefore unlikely to be\nobserved experimentally. Symmetric ~proton and neutron!\n;70% shell filling appears not to be within experimental\nreach in any other region of medium-mass or heavy nuclei.\nTherefore, the neutron-rich hafnium isotopes constitute the\nmost favorable candidates for the experimental verification\nof the predicted exotic mode of rigidlike oblate rotation.\nIn summary, significantly low excitation energies com-\nbined with prolate axially symmetric shapes lead to a predic-\ntion of the systematic existence of long-lived, multiquasipar-\nticle isomers in the hafnium isotopes with N>104. However,\nfor I>35\\ , well-deformed oblate-collective rotation may\ntake over as the energetically favored mode for accommo-\ndating angular momentum. Both the prolate and oblate\nmodes depend on reinforcing neutron and proton contribu-\ntions. The predicted structures appear to be within experi-\nmental reach.\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council and the Swedish Natural\nSciences Research Council.@1# P.
