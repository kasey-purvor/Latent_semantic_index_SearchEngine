For pre-service teachers, the teaching practice experience\nprovides the opportunity to observe the pedagogical strategies and classroom management\npractices of experienced teachers; to apply theoretical concepts and practical skills in real-\nlife settings; to speak the language of the profession in a real setting; and to understand the\nconcept of the school community and the professional role of the teacher within that\ncommunity.\nTeaching practice has been an example of how teacher educators and practising teachers\nwork together to mentor newcomers into the community of practice. However, the\n24\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\neffectiveness of the implementation of this partnership model has been the discussion of\nrecent debate and calls for reform in Australia (Ministerial Advisory Council on the\nQuality of Teaching, 1998; Ramsey, 2000). Changing fiscal and social influences require\nnew approaches to be investigated.\nThe concerns of policy-makers are mirrored by the frustrations communicated by the\nactive participants in the teaching practice experience (lecturers, pre-service and\nsupervising teachers). University-based lecturers refer to limitations in discussing the\napplication of theory into practice and providing counselling for pre-service teachers\nexperiencing problems and anxieties when in the school setting. Further needs analysis\nwith pre-service and supervising teachers suggests requirements for greater and more\nconsistent communication among participants, access to a variety of information (related\nto the programme specifically and to the teaching profession generally) and access to\nresources and tools to support the teaching and learning process.\nThe affordances of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and their\ndiffusion in primary, secondary and tertiary education setting allows for the exploration of\ninnovative approaches to supporting the teaching practice experience. Networked\ntechnology provides the opportunity for students to have continued and frequent contact\nwith faculty staff and other students thus supporting a philosophy of collaborative\nlearning (Bruffee, 1993). The use of such technologies allows students to:\n\u2022 share their practical learning experiences to develop a collective body of knowledge;\n\u2022 discuss content material and their understanding of that content in the light of their\npractical experiences;\n\u2022 engage in reflective practice that is valued by mentors and peers;\n\u2022 develop a support network to facilitate ongoing information sharing;\n\u2022 combat isolation through the development of a networked community that includes\naccess to peers, mentors and resources (Naidu and Olsen, 1996).\nThis paper details the methodology and outcomes associated with a pilot project that\nutilized asynchronous Web-based communication tools to facilitate mentoring and peer\nsupport through the teaching practice experience. Content analysis provides an indication\nof the richness of the interactions possible in such technology-supported learning\nenvironments. In-depth interviews with lecturers and pre-service teachers provide a\nparticipant perspective on the value of the intervention and guidelines for large-scale\nimplementation.\nThe context\nThe Faculty of Education in the University of Wollongong provides undergraduate pre-\nservice teacher education and postgraduate continuing and professional development. A\nspecialized Bachelor of Education degree prepares secondary school physical and health\neducation teachers, and graduates of this programme have gone on to positions in\ncommunity health and recreation centres. This initial teacher preparation in physical and\nhealth education involves the development of discipline-based knowledge, curriculum and\npedagogy skills and professional ethos. In each year of the four-year programme, pre-\n25\nLori Lock\/er et al Online mentoring and peer support\nservice teachers engage in school-based teaching practice experiences. This teaching\npractice is designed to provide students with the opportunity to put theory into practice.\nProfessional and educational literature expounds the benefits of the use of information\nand communications technologies (ICTs) in support of the roles and responsibilities of the\nphysical and health educator (Milio, 1996; Committee on Enhancing the Internet for\nHealth Applications, 2000). In 1998, with a strategic commitment and structuring of\nlecturing teams to include an appropriate mix of technology and physical and health\neducation expertise, the programme began to integrate ICT use in discipline and pedagogy-\nbased subjects (Lockyer and Kerr, 2000; Lockyer, Patterson and Harper, 2001). The success\nof such implementations suggested that extensions of that integration might address the\naforementioned challenges to the teaching practice programme. Of particular interest was\nhow the online environment might facilitate the active process of reflection on the\nexperience of professional practice through the interaction among the pre-service teachers\nand their university-based lecturers (Knights, 1985; Herrington, Herrington and Oliver,\n1999).\nPilot project\nA small-scale trial of online peer support and mentoring was implemented for students\nengaged in their final five-week teaching practice experience in July\/August 2000. Ten\nfourth-year students volunteered to engage in the trial, with two lecturers acting as expert\nmentors.\nA Website provided access to resources (such as links to sites related to syllabus topics and\na lesson plan template) and a bulletin board, which facilitated the online interaction\namong students and lecturers. The bulletin board was structured to support specific topic\nexploration in order to provide:\n\u2022 a general forum where students could interact on a more social level - not necessarily\nfocusing on teaching practice issues;\n\u2022 an activities forum where pairs of students were rostered weekly to submit an activity\nundertaken during the teaching practice;\n\u2022 and a questions and problems forum where students could post any problems or queries\nthey had in relation to their teaching practice or where lecturers could pose questions\nfor the whole group.\nOne week prior to their school-based teaching practice experience, a two-hour training\nsession was held with students and lecturers, which included an introduction to using the\nbulletin board system. A key aspect of this session was to clarify the students' tasks and\nresponsibilities related to their participation in the online discussion. Similar attempts to\nsupport professional practice experience through online interaction have suggested use of\nan explicit structure to develop interaction (Brehm, 1999). Further, consideration was\ngiven to developing a structure that would facilitate the opportunity for all students to\nreflect upon and contribute their classroom experiences. Given that many participants had\nlimited familiarity with online discussion, a roster structure was established. Each student\nwas asked to contribute a description of one activity they had used or planned to use in the\nclassroom during their teaching practice in an activities forum of the bulletin board during\n26\nALT-J Volume 10 Number \/\nan assigned week. Students were responsible for providing feedback to their peers\nregarding these posted contributions.\nAll students were also given the opportunity to request advice from their peers and\nlecturers, as well as to suggest possible solutions to issues faced by other students during\nthe teaching practice, on an ad hoc basis through the questions\/problems forum of the\nbulletin board.\nLecturers were not given a defined task but were expected to monitor regularly all\ndiscussion forums and respond to students' questions and problems if it seemed that their\npeers could not help them resolve issues. Lecturers were also expected, if necessary, to\nstimulate online discussion by posing practice-based questions.\nAll postings to the three bulletin board forums were saved and analysed in order to\nunderstand the use patterns and nature of discussion that took place. Further, students'\nand lecturers' perspectives on the experience were elicited through post-implementation\ninterviews which also provided explanatory support to the analysis of the interaction data.\nInterview questions covered issues related to participants' perceptions of the value of the\nonline interaction in supporting the development of their practice-based skills and\nunderstanding, their discipline (that is, physical and health education) knowledge base,\nprofessional self-concept and teaching philosophy, and social\/emotional encouragement as\nwell as the technical considerations of using the online system. In addition to analysis of\nthe pattern of postings, analysis of the nature of the online discussion was undertaken with\nconsideration of these issues.\nAnalysis of the postings revealed that, while students had been assigned a week in which to\npost an example of teaching activities that they had used or intended to use in class, only\nfour of the ten participants fulfilled this task. Of those, one student's initial contribution\nwas limited to a description of an activity used with children in class. Probing questions\nposted by other students and a lecturer stimulated reflective responses from the initiator\nregarding the process and outcomes of engaging in the activity with the children. The other\nthree students who initiated contributions during their assigned week focused on basic\ndescriptions of an activity they planned to implement in class. Questions to elicit more\ninformation about the planned activity and\/or sharing of personal experiences with similar\nsituations were posted by other students. This provided the initiators with an opportunity\nto clarify their lesson plans and spark ideas for possible activities among the other\nparticipants. For example, in response to a description of a ball game one student intended\nto implement, another participant posted:\nGreat game!... I will definitely be trying it with my year 7's next time we have prac. Only\nthing is I'm not 100% clear on is what the zone in the middle is for?!?!? Clarification\nplease!!!!!\nThe general and questions\/problems forums were by far the most utilized by the participants\n(26 postings in the activities forum, 67 postings in the questions\/problems forum, and 206\npostings in the general forum). Participants contributed practice-related issues and\nquestions to both the general\/problems forums. However, the majority of the postings in the\ngeneral forum covered more personal or social topics (such as jokes, birthday greetings,\norganization of social outings, etc.).\n27\nLori Lockyer et ol Online mentoring and peer support\nThe lecturers initiated discussion related to classroom practice (for example, strategies to\nengender respect from children) in the questions\/problems forum within the first few days of\nthe teaching practice in an attempt to welcome the students into this discussion space.\nHowever, students quickly took control of the discussion by sharing their classroom experi-\nences, asking their peers and the lecturers for specific advice and providing their peers with\npractical suggestions and emotional encouragement. Practice-based topics discussed in the\nquestions\/problems and general forums included aspects of classroom management, planning\nfor activities, reflection on practice and the process of teaching practice assessment.\nQuestions posed by the lecturers and requests for advice from students engendered\ncontributions of both conceptual understanding or philosophy of teaching practice as well as\ndetailed description and reflection on specific strategies used in class by the students. One\nstudents' posting expressed emotional stress over the teaching practice situation:\nSubject: Soul Searching\nHow do you get yourself out of a rut? I don't want to be here. I know i should plan but\nfor the life of me, it just isn't happening... there are soooo many things to think about\nand consider i simply can't be blessed starting... What do I do ?!? My life sux . . .\nSigned: Screwed up mind.\nFour students responded to this posting with contributions of encouragement. For\nexample, one student replied:\nSubject: re: soul searching\n. . . We are all new at this - we are trying to put the theory into practice, its tough man -\ni understand the way your feelin bro . . . you think that your not cut out for this stuff\n. . . have a look around the staff room - do you see any of them up till all hours thinking\nof what they have to teach tomorrow - no. They have the experience, knowledge and\nresources and know how to use them efficiently and effectively. That's what we are here\nto learn and develop . . .\nJust think about the good lessons or even just the good parts in the lessons, think of the\ninformation that the students have learnt - from you!!! Watch how their skills develop\nover the 5 weeks - because of you!!!\nOne of the lecturers used this set of postings to focus the discussion on the attributes of a\nprofessional teacher (an issue previously explored in lectures).\nThe pattern and nature of contributions suggests that a more free-flowing interaction\nrather than structured assignment of roles was appropriate to support the students' needs\nwhile they were engaged in their practice teaching experience. This observation was further\nconfirmed through post-implementation interviews with participants who noted that an\nimposed structure of assigned contribution in the activities forum confined the interaction\nprocess and that they felt more comfortable contributing to the more open general or\nquestions\/problems forums.\nExtending the concept\nLessons learnt from this initial small-scale trial provided a basis on which to structure\nsubsequent implementations of online peer support and mentoring through the teaching\npractice experience. The 2001 cohort of fourth-year students were given the opportunity to\n28\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nparticipate in the online intervention during their five-week (July\/August) teaching practice\nexperience. For this implementation one forum was utilized with two threads - one for\ngeneral or social issues and one for teaching issues. Unlike the previous implementation, a\nstructure or roster for contributions was not imposed. While far fewer contributions were\nposted by this group (n=106) than that from the previous cohort (n=299), the nature of the\ndiscussion was similar. The limited participation may have been a factor of technical\ndifficulties (individual student access to the Internet and University server downtime)\ncombined with a smaller number of participants (seven versus ten).\nThe concept was also extended to include second-year students who were involved in one\nweek of secondary school teaching practice in each of two semesters of the academic year\n(one week in May and one week in October). The seven fourth-year students agreed to act\nas online mentors for fourteen second-year students. Two second-year students were\ngrouped with one fourth-year student acting as mentor.\nOne week prior to the commencement of the first teaching practice experience for the\nsecond-year students, the participants attended a training and development exercise. This\nsession was used for groups to meet and negotiate times at which they expected to access\nthe bulletin board over the week. Second-year students were advised that they could\nsubmit questions, problems and requests for advice. The fourth-year mentor was\nresponsible for providing suggestions and feedback on the issues or questions raised by the\nsecond-year students undertaking their practice. Students were advised that the\nparticipating lecturers would monitor the discussions on a regular basis to ensure that\nquestions or problems were not going unanswered (particularly in the event that a fourth-\nyear mentor experienced technical difficulty accessing the bulletin board).\nAnalysis of the online interactions found that the nature of the discussion focused on\ngeneral behaviour management issues with some practical teaching strategies being\nsuggested by the mentors. When second-year students returned to campus after their\nteaching practice, all participants were invited to attend a session to discuss the online\nexperience. The teaching practice students agreed that they appreciated knowing that there\nwas someone online with whom they could share their successes and frustrations. They\nsaid that they felt comfortable asking their online mentors for advice and suggestions.\nThe online mentors felt that the experience allowed them to reflect on their previous\npractice teaching experiences. A comment by one mentor was wholeheartedly supported by\nthe others: 'I was giving advice and I thought \"where did that come from?\" I can't believe\nhow much I've learnt in the last three years!'\nThe second teaching practice for the second-year students occurred after the fourth-year\nonline mentors had engaged in their own final practice teaching experience (five weeks in\nJuly\/August). Preliminary analysis of the online interactions from the second teaching\npractice suggests that, in these discussions, the fourth-year mentors were far more explicit\nin their advice regarding teaching strategies. They made specific reference to examples of\ntheir experiences during their recent teaching practice and provided their analysis of the\nteaching strategies which they employed.\nWhilst issues of technical stability of the bulletin board system and access to the site from\nschools needs further consideration, the opportunity to be involved in discussions both\n29\nLori Lockyer et al Online mentoring and peer support\npersonal and professional over the duration of the teaching practice was rated highly and\nthought well worthwhile by all participants and therefore worthy of continuation.\nConclusions\nThe success of these small-scale trials has highlighted the potential for learning tech-\nnologies to enhance the practical component of a pre-service teacher education pro-\ngramme and provides a foundation for a future, larger-scale implementation. The following\nissues must be considered and detailed.\nStructuring discussion and supporting reflection\nThe initial attempt to elicit participation and facilitate reflective processes among the\nstudents via a roster of contributions regarding teaching activities was not successful. The\npattern of discussion and feedback from students suggests a more free-flowing interaction\nto be beneficial. However, students' initial tendency to be descriptive (recounting what\nhappened) needs to be extended by the other participants. Questioning and contribution of\ntheir own experiences by lecturers and other students facilitates the engagement of\nstudents in a more reflective process, discussing why it happened and what they would do\ndifferently next time. Preparing both the students and the lecturers to identify the\ndifference between a descriptive and reflective posting and developing strategies to support\nreflection may need to become a focus of the pre-implementation training session. The\nlecturers' role has further importance in simulating discussion through practice-based\nquestions, providing contributions that link the students' classroom experiences to\ncampus-based lectures, and acting as a source of ideas or guidance.\nCommunication Tools\nAn asynchronous communication tool was selected based on benefits of flexibility of time\nfor contribution and recording\/reflection purposes. However, given that some groups of\nstudents choose to schedule their online meetings for a particular time, it may be\nappropriate to provide access to a synchronous tool such as a chat space which would\nbetter facilitate real-time interaction.\nFuture research associated with a large-scale implementation will provide empirical\nevidence for the extent to which this intervention prepares pre-service teachers for their\nfuture professional role.\nReferences\nBrehm, B.
