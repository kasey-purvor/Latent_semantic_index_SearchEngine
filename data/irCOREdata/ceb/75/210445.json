Socio-economic development in communist Albania 1950-1990  \nIt is difficult to understand any achievements or setbacks in the development of Albania \nwithout considering the impact of communist rule in the second half of the twentieth \ncentury. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the communist regime faced an \nunparalleled task: not only did it have to re-build a country destroyed by the war, it also \nhad to create a modern country from the ruins of a semi-feudal society. The economy \nwas in a shambles: farming was the main economic activity, involving about 85% of the \npopulation; heavy industry was limited and focused primarily on the extraction of a few \nminerals, despite the country\u2019s wider wealth of mineral deposits. The country had no \nlarge industrial establishments; instead it had primitive forms of cottage industry \nsupplementing agriculture or stock-raising activities (Mason et al. 1945). Industrial \noutput had made an insignificant contribution to the country\u2019s economy since the start \nof the Italian occupation in the late 1930s. \nThe post-war Albanian government followed a policy not unlike that of other \nsocialist countries in order to accomplish its development strategy. Emphasis was \nplaced on the development of an industrial base to bring about basic structural changes \nand a balanced development of agriculture. The country\u2019s goal was set as the \ntransformation of Albania from an agricultural society (85% of the population being \nrural in 1939) to a developed industrial-agricultural one. Although the Albanian \ngovernment tried to keep a balance in its policy of development between agriculture \nand industry, the main focus of its development for 50 years was the industrialization of \nthe country. The government based its policy on the Stalinist model of rapid \nindustrialization, developing both light and heavy industry, and the principle of long-\nterm economic planning was adopted. At the end of the second five-year plan in 1955, \nit was announced that a light industrial base was to be created, and that Albania had \nnow become an agricultural-industrial country. The total output of the mineral industry \nincreased dramatically.  \nIn the later Albanian economic plans the focus remained the intensification of \nindustry, but now with a more difficult priority - the development of heavy industry for \nAlbania. Until the mid-1970s, the Albanian government was moderately successful in \nindustrializing the economy and the income per capita increased rapidly at an average \nof more than 8.2% a year (Gjon\u00e7a, Wilson, and Falkingham 1997). The government\u2019s \nrapid industrialization policy led to the creation of a relatively modern multi-branched \nindustrial sector, which by 1985 was generating 43.3% of the total national income \n(Golemi and Misja 1987). After the break with China in the late 1970s, however, the \nindustrial sector and the rest of the economy soon showed signs of decline. Despite the \nprogress of the early decades, by the end of communist regime Albania emerged as the \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 263 \npoorest country in Europe with a gross national product (GNP) per capita of about \nUS$380 (World Bank 1996). \nThere were two significant demographic consequences of the industrialization of \nthe Albanian economy. The first was the change in the rural-urban ratio. The urban \npopulation grew from 15% in 1938 to 36% in 1989, and to almost 50% by 2001. The \nindustrialization brought important changes in the working pattern for women, who  \nmade up 47% of the total labour force in 1989 (INSTAT 1992). \nA new social system was needed for a patriarchal and agrarian society, in which \nmore than 80% of the population lived in extreme poverty (Mason et al. 1945). The \nhealth of the population was extremely poor, with malaria and tuberculosis being \nwidespread: twenty percent of the population was infected with malaria (Skendi 1956), \nwhile tuberculosis accounted for 17.8% of all deaths (Gjon\u00e7a 2001). Other infectious \ndiseases (such as smallpox, typhus fever, and syphilis) were prevalent across the \ncountry. Just after the Second World War, life expectancy at birth was no more than 50 \nyears for both sexes. Infant mortality was at unprecedented levels for the region at 148 \ninfant deaths per 1000 live births. This was higher than that of any of the neighboring \nBalkan countries, such as Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. By the end of \nthe 1990s the communist government could rightly claim a success story with respect to \nimprovements in the health and survival of the population. Life expectancy at birth had \nimproved to 70.7 years and the infant mortality rate was reduced to 45.4 deaths per \n1000 live births (Gjon\u00e7a 2001). By 2000 these figures had further improved, with life \nexpectancy for both sexes reaching 74.4 years and infant mortality further reduced to \njust 22 deaths per 1000 live births. \nThe social system in Albania in the aftermath of World War II (WWII) was also in \na dreadful state. Large regions of the country did not have access to basic standards of \nhygiene, medical needs, or education. There was no access to safe drinking water in \nmost areas of the country and only a few cities had a central water provision. For the \nmajority of households drinking water was obtained from private wells. There were \nonly ten hospitals in the country and they could not even cope with the needs of the \npopulations of the main cities. Most of the country\u2019s population did not have access to a \nmedical doctor in their own locality, and going to a hospital would involve traveling, \nsometimes for a whole week. The number of medical personnel was very low. There \nwere about 1.1 doctors per 10,000 people, and the investment in health was only 1% of \nthe state budget. The total investment in the social agenda was very low. \nIlliteracy was widespread. More than 80% of the population was illiterate and \nfemale illiteracy stood at 92% (Publishing House 8 Nentori 1982). It was more \nwidespread in the rural areas and the undeveloped north-eastern part of the country. The \ncommunist government took improvements in education seriously and a campaign \nagainst illiteracy was one of the first to be introduced in 1947: in a very short period of \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n264  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \ntime, by the start of the 1970s, illiteracy was eliminated for people under 40 years of \nage; by 1989 the proportion of illiterates in the population was less than 8%; and by \n2001 it was 5.6% (INSTAT 2004b). \nThe social organization was based on a patriarchal system that disadvantaged \nwomen in all aspects of their social life. The social structure was basically tribal in the \nnorth and semi-feudal in the centre and south of the country, with kinship and descent \nplaying central roles. The basic unit of society was the extended family: a married \ncouple with their married sons and their offspring, as well as any unmarried daughters. \nThis extended family was the basic single residential unit and the basic economic entity. \nThe size of these families was very large, and by the end of WWII some numbered as \nmany as 60 to 70 members. \nThere was no social security system at the end of WWII: it was first introduced in \n1947. While it initially covered only a fragment of the population, by 1967 the social \ninsurance program covered most of the population. \n \n \n2. Data description  \nThe analyses in this paper are based on both aggregate level data and individual data. A \nlarge amount of information about fertility histories, marriages, and other socio-\neconomic indicators in Albania exists at an aggregate level, and this paper has made use \nof these sources. The information was only made available in the mid-1990s. Until \n2002 there were no individual data for the analysis of fertility in Albania. Most of the \nprevious work (Falkingham and Gjonca 2001) was based on aggregate level data. For \nthe first time, this paper makes use of individual data from the Albanian Living \nStandard Measurement Survey (ALSMS), which was implemented in 2002 and \nsurveyed 3,544 households providing information on 16,634 individuals. It follows the \nstandard format of the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and contains not \nonly rich information on income and consumption expenditures, but also on education, \nemployment, and, importantly for this analysis, full information on retrospective \nfertility histories for all women in the household. The 2002 ALSMS forms the basis for \na longitudinal survey, with a sub-sample of households and individuals re-interviewed \nin 2003 and 2004. \nAfter the background on socio-economic development in Albania and a brief \ndescription of data, this paper analyses the trends and patterns of fertility change in \nAlbania since 1950, using both aggregate and individual data. The analysis is followed \nby a discussion of the proximate determinants. Policies that brought fertility down to \nthe present level are analyzed following the discussion of the proximate determinants, \nwith a particular focus on the recent setting for fertility change. The paper concludes \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 265 \nwith a discussion of the future of fertility in Albania, focusing on the interplay between \nthe traditional and modern norms of society, and possible policies that might change the \ntrend. \n \n \n3. Fertility trends and patterns 1950 \u2013 2000  \nIt is difficult to build any fertility histories and trends for the period before World War \nII. Available data on crude birth rate(s) start from the early 1930s, at a time when the \nvital statistics registration system was set up in Albania. However the quality of such \ndata is questionable for a variety of reasons. Most important of all is the existence of a \nbirth registration tax in the period before WWII, which was a considerable burden for \nthe budget of a typical Albanian household. Another factor was the high level of \nilliteracy in the country, which affected the registration of all events. In addition, one \nneeds to take into account that the vital statistics registration system had just been \nintroduced and was either incomplete or non-existent in some of the less developed \nareas of the country. Consequently, there was either a lack of data for complete regions \nor inaccurate reporting of the vital events for that period. It is for this reason that the \nanalyses here focus on the period after 1950. However, here another important issue has \nto be taken into account: for the period 1950-1990 there is no data on individuals and it \nis only in 2002 that the first individual data to build fertility histories and analyze the \nfertility behaviour of Albanians was collected. \nBy the end of WWII Albania had the highest fertility in Europe, with an average of \nabout six births per woman. High fertility was reinforced by traditional patriarchal \nnorms. The total fertility rate (TFR) rose during the 1950s, reaching a peak of almost \nseven children per woman by 1960. This was followed in the 1970s by a steady decline, \nwith a TFR of less than four in 1980 and just over three children per woman in 1990 \n(Figure 1). The 1990s saw a continuing reduction in fertility, with both vital statistics \ndata and survey data confirming a TFR of about the replacement level of 2.2 children \nper woman. While the total fertility rate steadily declined during the 1950-2000 period, \nit was accompanied also by a steady decrease in the mean age of childbearing (MACB) \n(Figure 1). The MACB fell from 31.4 to 27.7 in 2000. This decrease is not unduly sharp \nand coincides with the high levels of fertility in Albania during the period under \nconsideration. After the baby boom of the 1960s, the relationship between the TFR and \nMACB becomes clearer. Thus, when fertility dropped sharply in the mid 1970s, the \ndecrease in the MACB slowed down: the MACB hardly changed. This trend continued \ninto the 1990s. As the TFR decreased from 3 to 2.2 children per woman, the mean age \nof childbearing remained almost constant at about 28 years for women. In most \nEuropean countries the postponement of or reduction in fertility is very much associated \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n266  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nwith changes in the MACB. In the case of Albania, this relationship is not so \nstraightforward. The distinctive feature of fertility reduction in Albania is that when \nfertility decreased during the 1960-2000 period, it decreased for women of all ages \n(Figures 2a and 2b), thus the changes in the MACB were not dramatic. \nThe rise in period fertility during the 1950s and 1960s mirrors the experiences of \nmany European countries at the end of the Second World War. As one of the countries \nwith the highest per capita losses, it is not surprising that fertility increased in Albania \nimmediately after the war. However, in no other European country did the post-war \nbaby boom start from such a high underlying rate. An alternative interpretation of this \ntrend is that it represents a pre-decline rise in fertility of the kind studied by Dyson and \nMurphy (1985), which they showed to be a widespread characteristic of fertility \ntransition. The baby boom of the 1960s was accompanied by a decrease in the mean age \nof entrance into marriage (MAM). The mean age of marriage dropped from 21.8 years \nin 1950 to 21.2 years in 1960, remained at a similar level in 1965, and increased to 23 \nyears in 1990. Since a first birth was universal, the trend in the MAM should follow the \nsame trend in the mean age of first birth, which fell from 23.4 years in 1950 to 22.55 \nyears in 1965. It subsequently increased to 24.51 years in 1990. It is also important to \nmention here that infant mortality started declining rapidly in the 1950s (Gjon\u00e7a, \nWilson, and Falkingham 1997) and that might have had an initial inverse effect in the \nearly stages. By the mid 1970s the infant mortality rate (IMR) was almost half that of \n1950 (143 per 1000). \nWhen Albania opened up in the 1990s, immediately after the collapse of \ncommunism, it came as a surprise to learn that in the intervening period, fertility had \nfallen to around three children per woman, despite a pro-natalist Marxist regime and in \nthe virtual absence of contraception and abortion. \nThe rise in fertility between 1950 and 1960 was made up of a rise in age-specific \nfertility rates for all ages; the increase was most marked amongst young women under \nthe age of 30 (Figure 2a). Once fertility began to decline, the process was irreversible \nand the TFR fell by approximately 1.28 children per woman per decade during the \nperiod 1960 to 1990. While this is not as rapid as some of the most famous fertility \ndeclines of that era, such as those seen in China or Thailand during the 1970s, the fall in \nfertility was substantial nevertheless, especially when compared with most other \ncountries at similar levels of economic development. Note that while family planning \npolicies were in place in these other countries (e.g. the \u2018one child policy\u2019 in China), in \nAlbania the reduction of fertility during these years occurred in the absence of family \nplanning policy. Despite this reduction, the level of fertility at the end of the communist \nregime was still high in comparison to other Southern and Eastern European countries, \nsuch as Italy, Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria. The absence of a clear family planning \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 267 \npolicy, the existence of a pro-natalist environment, and the absence of the means of \nbirth control kept the level of fertility relatively high through to the end of the 1980s. \nCohort fertility data show that the Cohort Fertility Rate (CFR) is not as high as the \nTFR, reinforcing the earlier view that the rise in fertility from 1950 to 1955 was in part \nan effect of timing, exacerbated by a boom in early marriages immediately after the war \n(Figure 1). Secondly, the downturn for both the TFR and CFR coincide, although the \nfall in cohort fertility is more gradual. Both measures, however, point to a fall in total \nfamily size from between 5 and 6 to just above 2 children per woman. It is important to \nmention here that just as in many other European countries, during the 1960s\u2019 baby \nboom all cohorts contributed to the increase in the level of fertility (Figure 2b). \nFor the period before the late 1990s it was difficult to build any fertility histories \ndue to the lack of individual data. Here, we use fertility histories based on data from the \nAlbanian ALSMS in 2002. As well as describing the trends, semi-parametric statistical \nsurvival techniques are used to analyze the fertility differentials in Albania, based on \ndemographic and socio-economic characteristics. Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 show the results \nof the Kaplan Meier estimates by birth cohort, education, region, and rural\/urban \ndivision against birth order.

Interpretation of the time dimension is somewhat difficult since some \nwomen were aged 15 when they gave first birth. The time to the second birth event is \nmeasured as that which has elapsed since the first birth, and for the third birth it is the \ntime that has elapsed since the second birth. However, what we are interested in are the \noverall differentials more than differences by birth order. \nFigure 3 shows the Kaplan Meier estimates by birth cohorts and birth order. Six \nbirth cohorts are defined, the first capturing those born between 1930 and 1939. The \nsubsequent cohorts are those born between 1940 and 1949, 1950 and 1959, 1960 and \n1969, 1970 and 1979 with the last being those born between 1980 and 1986. It is clear \nthat the last two cohorts have not yet completed their fertility cycle. Similar to the \nresults from the aggregate data, these estimates show that there is a clear difference \nbetween cohorts, with the younger cohorts entering childbearing later compared to the \nprevious ones. An interesting point that attracts attention when analyzing by birth order \nand cohort is the extent to which the two youngest cohorts differ from the older ones. \nOverall, the estimates show that there is little difference between cohorts for the first \nbirth and very little difference for the second, but there is a distinct difference between \nthe youngest and the two older cohorts for the third birth. This indicates that a first birth \nis generally universal in traditional Albanian society. Even in 2000, when the TFR is at \n2.2 children per woman, first birth is given at a relatively young age immediately after \nmarriage. For the higher parities we see strong differences, showing that the decline in \nfertility (as seen in Figures 1, 2a, and 2b) is driven primarily by a decline in higher-\norder births. Estimates (Kaplan Meier) for the first birth in particular, and for the other \ntwo to a lesser extent, approach zero for early cohorts. This suggests a very high \nproportion of women having a first birth, which fits the observation that the overall \nlevel of fertility for these cohorts was very high (Figure 2b). However, there may be \nother explanations. First, the data collected in these types of surveys, where fertility \nhistories are investigated, tend to under-represent groups of women who are not \nmarried, divorced, or childless. This may well apply to Albania: it is a country that has \nbeen, and to a certain extent still remains, a traditional and patriarchal society. \nHowever, these results may also be affected by the fact that marriage was universal in \nAlbania for the period under consideration and in particular for the early cohorts, where \nchildbearing outside marriage was almost zero (Falkingham and Gjon\u00e7a 2001, INSTAT \n2005). \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n270  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nPreviously, we emphasized the role of education in the reduction of fertility in \nAlbania (Falkingham and Gjon\u00e7a 2001), but we were unable to quantify this effect. \nFigure 4 shows clearly the difference in fertility between women with different levels of \neducation and by birth order, with the most educated being later entrants and having a \nlower level of childbearing for all birth orders. It is interesting to see the behaviour of \nthe women with the two lower levels of education. When birth orders are compared, the \neffect of educational differences is apparent in all of them, but this effect is most \nevident in respect of the third birth. Note that even low levels of education make a \ndifference when fertility is considered. This is particularly the case between the lower \nlevels of education (0 to 4, 5 to 7 and 8 to 11 years) when the third birth is analyzed. \nWhile for the first birth the differences between these levels of education are not \nsignificant, for the third birth they are distinctive. The very small differences for the \nlower three levels of education where the first birth is concerned again prove that \nhaving a first birth in Albania remains universal even today. For the first birth, it is \nworth noting that women with 5 to 7 years of education have the highest likelihood of \nhaving more children, closely followed by women with 0 to 4 years of education. This \ncan be explained by the fact that the groups with these levels of education are mainly \nthe oldest cohorts (Gjon\u00e7a 2001). For them, the traditional values are universal and \nwidespread; the only difference resulting from the additional years in education would \nbe in the time of childbearing, rather than in the number of children. \nIt is difficult to build an accurate indicator or variable to measure the historical \nincomes or development of Albania. However, a relatively good proxy for the level of \ndevelopment in the case of Albania is regional location, although this is clearly not \nentirely accurate because of the large internal migration within the country during the \n1990s. There are four main regions in ALSMS: the coastal region (more developed), the \nmountainous region of the north east (the least developed in the country), the central \nregion, and the capital, Tirana, which is the most developed region. The differences \nbetween three of the regions are very small (Figure 6). This can be seen as showing \neither that development was not an important factor in determining the level of fertility \nin the past in Albania, or it could be seen as confirming an expectation that there would \nbe no major differences in a very egalitarian society where income distribution was the \nflattest of all the Eastern European countries. However, there are aspects of \ndevelopment that affect the level of fertility in such circumstances: physical \ninfrastructure is one; access to institutions (including health and education) is another; \nand there are many more specifically associated with life in the capital city. These \naspects are indeed reflected in the differences of the Kaplan-Meier estimates between \nTirana, the capital of the country, and those of the other three regions. A very similar \nargument applies when the rural\/urban fertility differential is considered. The \ndifferences are small but clear in both the level of fertility and the late entrance to \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 271 \nchildbearing in the urban areas (see Figure 5). These differences are more evident for \nthe third birth. The rural\/urban differences seem to be not very significant when \ncompared to the experiences of other developing countries. However, this could be \nspecific to the Albanian case, where the country experienced the lowest income \ninequality in the whole of former Eastern Europe (Gjon\u00e7a, Wilson, and Falkingham \n1997, Gjon\u00e7a 2001). The narrowing of the income gap between the rural and urban \nareas and, in particular, the improvement of female education in rural areas was seen as \na priority by the former communist government. These two policies might have had an \neffect in minimizing the fertility differences between the urban and rural areas. \nThe Living Standard and Measurement Survey allows us to build a poverty \nvariable based on both consumption and income levels of households. As for the \npoverty variable for the fertility differences by regions and rural\/urban locations, this \nvariable does not reveal a significant effect on the fertility level in Albania.  \nVery important in this analysis is the role of education (investment in the social \nagenda) relative to the other variables that show the level of development in the \ncountry, such as region and poverty variables. It is of particular importance when the \npolicies affecting fertility change in Albania are considered later in this paper. It \nemphasizes the greater importance of the policies addressing the social agenda in the \ncountry, compared with those addressing economic development. \n \n \n4. Emigration and fertility in Albania  \nSince 1990 Albania has experienced one of the largest and fastest growing rates of \ninternational migration in the recent history of Europe. About 24% of the country\u2019s \npopulation emigrated between 1990 and 2001 (INSTAT 2002). Most of this emigration \nwas concentrated in the reproductive age groups (Figure 7). The most affected ages are \nthe 25 to 35 year olds with a clear over-representation of men. From Figure 7 it is also \nclear that the number of children born between the two censuses declined dramatically. \nIt is obvious that this flow of out-migrants, taking place in a very short period of time, \nhas had an effect on the absolute numbers of children born. However, it is difficult to \njudge if this large emigration has had an effect on the level of fertility. Clearly, in order \nto evaluate the possible effects of emigration on the level of fertility, data on both \nemigration and fertility histories are required. Unfortunately the Albanian Living \nStandard and Measurement Survey of 2002 includes only those members of households \nwho have been present for more than six months in the past year. This has the \nunfortunate effect of excluding any household members that have been away for more \nthan six months. A substantial component of the emigration is seasonal, so this ALSMS  \n \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n272  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier estimates by cohorts and birth order  \nKaplan Meier estimate of 1st birth\nby cohorts\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 25 35 45Age of Woman\n1930-39 1940-49 \n1950-59 1960-69 \n1970-79 1980-86 \n \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 2nd birth\nby cohorts\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYears since 1st birth\n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 3rd birth\nby cohorts\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nYears since 2nd birth\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from the ALSMS, INSTAT 2002. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 273 \nFigure 4: Kaplan-Meier estimates by education and birth order  \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 1st birth\nby education\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 25 35 45Age of woman\n0 - 4 yrs\n5 - 7 yrs\n8 - 11 yrs\n12 - 15 yrs\n16+ yrs\n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 2nd birth\nby education\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYears since 1st birth\n \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 3rd birth\nby education\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nYears since 2nd birth\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from the ALSMS, INSTAT 2002. \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n274  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nFigure 5: Kaplan-Meier estimates for all births by rural\/urban division \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 1st birth\nby urban - rural \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 25 35 45Age of woman\nurban rural\n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 2nd birth\nby urban - rural\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYears since 1st birth\n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 3rd birth\nby urban - rural\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nYears since 2nd birth\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from the ALSMS, INSTAT 2002. \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 275 \nFigure 6: Kaplan-Meier estimates for all births by four major regions  \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 1st birth\nby region\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 25 35 45Age of woman\nCoastal Central Mountain Tirana \n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 2nd birth\nby region\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYears since 1st birth\n \nKaplan Meier estimate of 3rd birth\nby region\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nYears since 2nd birth\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from the ALSMS, INSTAT 2002. \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n276  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nfeature will necessarily exclude an important part of those working abroad. As a result, \nit is difficult to use this data source to establish possible links with emigration and \nfertility outcomes. \nHowever, aggregate data sources do give some clues to this issue. In the early \nyears, migration was initially male dominated and thereby reduced the potential for \nchildbearing due to the lack of matching partners. This might have affected the level of \nfertility initially, at least in the early years of the 1990s. Later, however, the gender \ndifference became much more balanced, and it is believed that by the late 1990s this \neffect became negligible. Another issue to consider here is that migration is usually \nselective in terms of the individual education, place of residence, and work history. \nHowever, the census data showed that in Albania emigration has affected all areas of \nthe country (INSTAT 2004c), people with different levels of education, and people \nfrom different social groups. In that respect the effect on fertility has not been unequal \nin different areas or within different groups of the population. Another relevant issue \nconcerns remittances. As far as fertility decisions are affected by economic \ncircumstances, one would expect remittances to have a positive effect on fertility. By \nand large, emigration is driven by difficult economic circumstances in the country of \norigin, and clearly remittances play an important role for household survival. From the \n2002 ALSMS we know that one-third of household budgets came from remittances \n(World Bank 2003). This is a substantial amount and will affect all processes that are in \nany way income-related, and here, of course, childbearing is not an exception. \nHowever, as we have demonstrated, fertility has certainly decreased during this period \nand thus the effect of remittances on fertility is not a significant one. Therefore, it has to \nbe concluded that factors other than income have driven the reduction of fertility since \n1990. This is also supported by the results of our analyses, which show that poverty is \nnot a significant factor in explaining variation in fertility in Albania during past years. \nAnother major event that had the potential to affect the level of fertility in Albania \nwas the forced displacement of Kosovo Albanians during the 1999 war in Kosovo. \nAbout 66% of households in Kosovo were displaced (Spiegel and Salama 1999), \nmainly into Albania (71% of all the displaced population) and Macedonia: altogether an \nestimated 700,000 people (ICC 1999). The conflict ended in a matter of months rather \nthan years, and the displaced population of Kosovo returned home within three months \nof the conflict: the 2001 Albanian census and the 2002 Kosovo LSMS data show that \nthey did so immediately after the war. Hence, the number of people settling in Albania \nwas insignificant, and we would thus not expect to see any significant affect on fertility \nlevels. \n \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 277 \nFigure 7: Population age pyramids of Albania, 1989, 2001 \n \n1989\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\nMale Female\n \n2001\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85+ Male Female\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from the Institute of Statistics (INSTAT, 1991, 2002). \n \n \n \n5. The proximate determinants of fertility in Albania  \nWhile work has been done on the trends and patterns of fertility in Albania in the past \n50 years, not much is known about the proximate determinants of fertility in Albania. \nThis paper looks at the proximate determinants of fertility in Albania for the first time, \nusing data from the Albanian Reproductive and Health Survey (ARHS) conducted in \n2002 (INSTAT, 2003a).  \n \n \n5.1 Marriage  \nMarriage plays a central role in Albanian society. Marriage has been almost universal in \nthe past and continues to be so even today. The ARHS data show that by age 25, 72% \nof females are married and by age 35, only 8% of them have remained single (Figure 8). \nThe percentage of single women 16 years of age or older in the population in 2001 was \nonly 19.6%. These figures show clearly that where marriage is concerned, Albanian \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n278  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nsociety remains traditional. This is interesting if one takes into account that despite \ndramatic improvements in education, and in female education in particular, the \nmarriage pattern still has not changed in Albania. This is also supported by the fact that \nthe mean age at marriage has changed very little. Thus, in 1950, the mean age at \nmarriage for a female was 22.0 years, while in 2000 it was only 23.0 years. The same \napplied for men, with a mean age at marriage of 27.7 years in 1950 compared to 28.1 \nyears in 2000. The picture is quite different when compared with neighboring countries, \nsuch as Greece, where in 2000, the mean age at marriage for females was 28.6 and for \nmales 32.8, and Serbia and Montenegro, where the figures were 26.8 for females and \n30.6 for males. As for the age at marriage, the marriage rate has not changed much. The \ncrude marriage rate (marriages per thousand of population) in 1950 was 10.1 (INSTAT, \n1992); in 2001 it was 8.4 (INSTAT, 2003b). It is understandable that with these high \nmarriage rates, childbearing continues to be within marriage. Vital statistics show an \ninsignificant number of children being born outside marriage. In 2003 the number of \nbirths out of wedlock was less than 0.5% of all births. Since marriage rates are so high \none would expect cohabitations to be very low. Indeed, among the young population, \nthose aged from 15 to 29, the proportion cohabitating was 0.2% (INSTAT 2005). \nDespite the strong traditional values, there are signs of increased cohabitation in \nAlbania, in particular within the younger age groups. The introduction of new \nlegislation (the Family Code) in 2003 is expected to affect the levels and trends of \nmarriage and cohabitation. \n \n \n5.2 Induced abortion  \nUnlike many Eastern European countries where induced abortion was the primary \nmeans of birth control, abortions were illegal in Albania until 1991. However, this does \nnot mean that abortion was not practiced at all: it was allowed on medical grounds, and \na large number of pregnancies in the major cities would end with an abortion justified \nthis way. This makes it difficult to analyze abortion in communist Albania. The data \nfrom the ARHS on induced abortions differ from those coming from official figures, \nwhich is most probably due to under-reporting. While under-reporting of abortions \nthrough surveys or vital statistics reports is universal in most societies, be they \ndeveloped or developing (Henshaw, Singh, and Hass 1999), in the case of Albania \nunder-reporting is very significant; the most likely explanation is the reluctance to \nreport having had an abortion in a patriarchal society. The survey rate for abortion is \nabout 73 per 1000 live births (INSTAT, 2003a), while the official figures (routinely \ncollected from the health system) show a rate of 200 per 1000 live births (INSTAT, \n2003b). There are some reasons for this difference. One may be the under-reporting of \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 279 \nunwanted pregnancies themselves. Another may be the under-reporting of illegal \nabortions outside the medical system, and yet another may be the tendency to classify \ninduced abortions as spontaneous or as miscarriages. Comparing the survey figures over \ntime reveals a declining trend in the abortion ratio: the figure of 73 quoted above \ncompares to the figures of 241 in 1999 and 172 in 2001 (INSTAT, 2003a). Prior to \n1990 abortion was illegal so earlier records are not accurate. In 1991, abortion was \nlegalized through a decree of the Council of Ministers approving the activities of family \nplanning clinics in Albania. The law for the interruption of pregnancy which was later \npassed in parliament (1995) allows the termination of a pregnancy within the first 22 \nweeks for health and social reasons, and within 12 weeks for psychological reasons. \n \n \nFigure 8: Proportions of Albanian female population married in 2001,  \nby place of residence \n \nFemale married population in 2001 (in %)\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\ntotal\nrural\nurban\n \n \nSource: Population and housing census, INSTAT, 2001. \n \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n280  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \n5.3 Knowledge and use of contraception  \nThe analysis of fertility by age suggests an increase in childlessness among the young \ngeneration (or a postponement of childbirth to later years). It is only reasonable to \nassume that this has been a consequence of the introduction of modern methods of \ncontraception. However, different sources of information give conflicting evidence on \nthe issue. The ARHS data show that nine out of ten Albanian women know of at least \none modern method of contraception, and about 87% know of at least one traditional \nmethod of contraception. While 81% of women know about condoms, only two-thirds \nhave heard of oral contraception and less than 35% have heard of any other modern \ncontraceptive methods. The situation is very similar for men. There is a strong belief \nthat traditional methods are better than the modern ones, in particular, the importance of \nwithdrawal versus the use of a condom. While the prevalence of any contraception is \nhigh among the married population (about 75% of women and 77% of men), the \nadoption of modern methods is very low at 8% for women, and 3% for men. Modern \ncontraceptive use was found to be high only in women with higher education and living \nin the capital, Tirana (INSTAT, 2003a). \n \n \n5.4 Age and frequency of intercourse  \nThe age of first sexual intercourse in Albania remains relatively high compared to other \nEuropean countries. The ARHS data indicate that the proportion of women who \nexperienced sexual intercourse before the age of 18 was 10% for women aged between \n40 and 44 and 16% for women aged between 20 and 24. The average age for first \nsexual intercourse for women was 21.1 years, only a few months younger than the \naverage age of first marriage, at 21.9 years. Usually the first birth follows at an age of \n23.4. For men the age of first sexual intercourse is similarly late (21.5 years). The \nmedian age at first marriage for men is 26.5 years.  \n \n \n6. Population and social welfare policies in Albania  \nWhen the communists took control in 1945, the social environment was already pro-\nnatalist with regard to marriage and fertility. Albanian society was a patriarchal and \ntraditional one. Population growth in Albania, as in some other communist countries \nthat applied Marxist ideology, was seen as positively correlated with economic growth. \nAs Misja and Vesju (1985, p.8) state:  \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 281 \n\u201cThe essence of the socialist law of population is the full employment and rational \nutilization of all sources of labour, the ceaseless growth of the population, the ceaseless \nraising of the material and cultural well-being of the people.\u201d \n \nIt is important to start this discussion by explaining the difference between the \nexplicit and implicit population policies implemented in Albania. In an environment \nwhere fertility was already high due to strong traditional and cultural norms, the \ngovernment did not need to have any explicit population policy in order to increase the \nlevel of fertility. However, other population policies, such as the reduction of infant and \nmaternal mortality policies, had an indirect effect on fertility reduction in Albania. The \ncommunist government also invested considerably in improving the social agenda of \nthe country through policies that would have a significant effect on the level and pattern \nof fertility in Albania, not just in the period 1950 to 1990, but also to the present day. \nThe discussion that follows will be focused on two main streams of factors and policies, \nthe ones that tended to keep fertility high during the past 50 years and the ones that \nreduced the fertility from 6 to 2.2 children per woman. \n \n \n6.1 Pro-natalist environment and traditionalism kept fertility high in communist \nAlbania between 1945 and 1990  \nIn contrast to most other communist states of Eastern and Central Europe, which \nproduced considerable pro-natalist propaganda, population issues were given little \nattention in Albania. The literature on the country tells us that there was no debate on \npopulation policy in Albania during the communist rule, either in policy discussion or \nin research work (Macura 1974). In fact, the only population-related policy was the \nreduction of infant and maternal mortality, and all demographic developments were \nseen in connection with this policy.  \nThere were two sets of factors that kept fertility high in Albania. First were the \npro-natalist environment and policies. Second, there were the traditional and cultural \nnorms which were very strong in the patriarchal Albanian society in the aftermath of \nWWII. \n \n \n6.1.1 Pro-natalist environment and policies  \nDespite the value placed on mothers and children by the communist government, there \nwas no provision for family planning. The most significant pro-natalist policy, if it \ncould be called such, was the restriction of access to the means of birth control. \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n282  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nContraceptives were not widely available and unlike in many European communist \nstates, abortion was prohibited by law. It was only permitted on very narrow medical \ngrounds, making Albania\u2019s abortion law by far the most consistently restrictive in \nEastern Europe (David 1970). Also there were no incentives to provide any form of \neducation or information on the use of contraception; in a patriarchal society, the lack \nof knowledge about contraception would in effect restrict its use even if it were \navailable. Contraception was never prohibited, but neither was it promoted. The main \nmeans of birth control was coitus interruptus; this has remained so to the present day, \ndespite the availability of contraception and abortion (INSTA 2003a, INSTAT 2005). \nOther areas of state policy also acted to sustain the high fertility level, either \nthrough strong financial incentives for mothers, or through the reduction of the \u2018cost\u2019 of \nchildbearing. In order to encourage women to join the labour force, extensive provision \nof pre-school care was introduced. Infants and children under the age of three could be \nplaced in daycare or even overnight accommodation for fees payable by the parents and \ntheir employers. All children aged between three and six were entitled to a free place in \na state-funded kindergarten. This had a double benefit for the state: women were freed \nfrom childcare responsibilities and were thus able to work; and children could be \ninducted into the socialist education system at an early age. It also created a significant \nexternality favoring large families. \nOther policies reduced the \u2018cost\u2019 of children, both directly and indirectly. The price \nof children\u2019s clothes was kept deliberately low. Canteens were provided both at the \nworkplace and in local residential areas to lighten women\u2019s loads, as were launderettes \nand labour-saving devices to assist women to combine their roles of workers and \nmothers (Hall 1994). Albania also adopted the Soviet practice of presenting medals to \nwomen who were particularly fecund, and this continued right up to the end of the \n1980s. On the first birthday of the eighth surviving child a woman was awarded the \naccolade of \u2018Heroic Mother\u2019, while third, second and first class awards of \u2018Mother\u2019s \nGlory\u2019 were bestowed on women with between four and seven children. \nPregnancy leave was extended from six weeks to six months in 1981, with the \nwoman\u2019s right to return to her job protected by law (B\u00ebrxholli and Qiriazi, 1986). The \npositive influence of such measures on fertility was reflected in the fact that over \n20,000 more births were recorded in the four-year period after this measure was enacted \nthan in the previous four years (Hall 1994). In the years following this four-year period, \nhowever, the trend was reversed. The impact on the fertility rate was nonetheless \ninsignificant for this whole period: a slight change in the fertility rate was seen in the \nurban areas, where the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) increased from 20.5 in 1980 to 22.3 in \n1985 and then decreased in the following years. For the same period in the rural \npopulation the CBR decreased from 29.5 to 28.2. This is understandable on two \ngrounds. First, the urban population was more educated than the rural one, and thus \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 283 \ncould react more quickly to the introduction of new policies. Second, the way \nemployment was regulated in the rural areas meant that the financial benefits of the \npregnancy leave were not significant in the agricultural cooperatives. Nonetheless, the \nincrease in the pregnancy leave did have an immediate beneficial effect on infant \nmortality: in the following year, 1982, the infant mortality rate dropped by 18%, with \nmortality at two to five months being most affected (Skenderi and Vejsiu 1983).  \nThese measures, applied in a traditional society like Albania where children were \nalready seen as beneficial, only served to reinforce the psychological base for a large \nnumber of children (Falkingham and Gjon\u00e7a 2001). \n \n \n6.1.2 Cultural and traditional values  \nUnder communism Albanian women were given little choice but to procreate (Hall \n1994). For most women, traditional Albanian life was characterized by discrimination \nand inequality compared with men. These were further reinforced by a wide range of \ncultural norms. While the Canon (a traditional 14th century set of laws) subjugated \nwomen in the northern upland areas, religion abetted their oppression in the rest of the \ncountry. The birth of a girl was considered a burden and a misfortune on the family. \nMost marriages were arranged (Hall 1994). In the immediate pre-war period there were \njust 21 female teachers in the country, two women doctors, and no female engineers, \nagronomists, or chemists (Ash 1974). Only 2.4% of secondary school students were \ngirls (EBNA 1984). In the 1946 constitution immediately following their accession to \npower, the communists introduced a number of laws to regulate marriage and divorce. \nMarriage was based on equal rights for both spouses. The traditional concept of the \n\u2018head of the family\u2019 was rejected by the new legislation, with each of the spouses \nhaving the right to choose his\/her own occupation, profession, and residence. The \nintroduction of the new legislation gave unprecedented rights to women in a traditional \nsociety. However, the persistence of traditionalism in the rural areas and north of the \ncountry made the emancipation of Albanian woman difficult. Divorce law for the first \ntime provided women with the right to petition it on the same grounds as men (Keefe et \nal. 1971). The modifications made to the divorce law in 1970 made it somewhat easier \nfor couples to divorce, in particular for the women. Thus, we see almost a doubling of \nthe number of divorces from 1,041 in 1965 to 1,903 in 1975. Since all childbearing took \nplace within marriage this change in the divorce law might have made a slight \ncontribution to the sharp decline of fertility in the 1970s (Figure 1). However, marriage \nrates increased from 5.8 per 1,000 in 1938 to 8.5 by 1985, one of the highest levels in \nEurope (Hall 1994). Equality between men and women was stressed continuously and \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n284  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nwas even included in the constitution. The constitution of the People\u2019s Socialist \nRepublic (PSR) of Albania (Article 41) stated: \n\u2018The woman enjoys equal rights with a man in work, pay, holidays, social security, \neducation, in all social-political activities as well as in the family\u2019 (Kuvendi Popullor \n1976). \nThe move towards equal rights, despite being sanctioned by law, was a slow \nprocess. On the one hand, improvements in rights and equality in educational \ninstitutions and the workplace took place, but on the other hand, the traditional norms \nwere enforced and survived in families and households in many parts of the country, in \nparticular the countryside and the highlands. In these parts of the country women faced \nthe double burden of having to work full time and at the same time cope with all the \nhousehold responsibilities, despite the authority of the \u2018master of the family\u2019 being \nconsiderably reduced. Although the legislation had been introduced, its implementation \nwas difficult. For example, when the divorce legislation was changed in 1970, giving \nboth men and women equal rights to divorce, the person suing for it had to present the \ncase publicly in court, thus making it not just difficult, but also creating a lack of \nprivacy and showing \u2018interference\u2019 from the state. The situation has changed \nsignificantly today, but equal rights at home are still an issue that deserves to be \naddressed in current Albanian society. \n \n \n6.2 Social and economic policies reducing fertility in communist Albania  \nbetween 1945 and 1990  \nAlthough there were few explicit family planning policies, there were other social and \neconomic policies that had a much more significant and implicit effect on fertility in \nAlbania, in particular the ones that improved the social agenda in the country. There \nwere two main achievements of the communist policies that affected the level of \nfertility in the country. First, the improvement in female education, and second the \nimprovements in the employment rates for females. \nThe investment in education, particularly female education, was unprecedented in \nAlbania. Female illiteracy improved from 92% in 1945 to less than 8% in 1989, and by \n2002 it was less than 5%, similar to most developed European societies. The \ngovernment instigated its campaign against illiteracy in the aftermath of the Second \nWorld War; it started on a voluntary basis and by 1950 primary education was made \ncompulsory by law. The law that made the seven years of primary education obligatory \naffected the entire population from 12 to 40 years of age. It also established the \nfoundations for vocational training and specialized technical education. By the early \n1970s the government had achieved a remarkable success in the area of education, \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 285 \nproclaiming the eradication of illiteracy. This success was accepted even by the \nharshest critics of Albanian communism (Logoreci 1977). More importantly, the 1946 \nconstitution of the country guaranteed free education for all, which opened the doors to \nall strata of society, most importantly the rural population. The promotion of education \nremained high on the communist agenda even in the last years of its existence. Thus, by \n1985 the government was spending about 29% of its budget on education (Misja, \nVejsiu, and B\u00ebrxholli 1987). This is unprecedented for any former communist \ngovernment in Eastern Europe. In terms of enrolment, Albania had a broad-based \nsystem, with more than 90% of pupils completing compulsory primary education, and \n70% of them continuing into secondary education. From these, more than 40% went on \nto university (Gjon\u00e7a 2001). \nAttention was paid to female education, in particular in the less developed areas of \nthe country. It is well known that improvement in female education has a significant \neffect directly and indirectly on the level of fertility and other demographic processes \n(Caldwell 1986, Caldwell and Caldwell 1991). Table 1 shows the percentages of female \nstudents at all levels of education. It is clear that dramatic improvements were made \nduring the period under consideration, and at the end of communist rule female \neducation was on a par with male education. There is an important point to focus on \nhere with regards to fertility changes: in 1967 Albania banned religion, with the \ngovernment arguing that it was the major source of female oppression. Unquestionably, \nfemale educational opportunities improved, and the figures show that. The increase in \nthe number of female students in secondary (not compulsory) and higher education in \n1970 and 1980 is exceptional. This also affected the employment rates for females, and \nby 1970 we see most of the improvement. These measures are the ones most likely to \naccount for the sharp decline in fertility in the following years from 1970 until 1980 \n(Figure 1). It has to be emphasized that these results were part of a whole package of \nmeasures giving women equal rights with men. All these measures together made the \ndecline in fertility in the 1970s sharper than in previous periods. \nIt was not only female education that the communist regime invested in. Since the \ngovernment was interested in full female employment, it also invested in the pre-school \neducation system, creating a system of day-care nursing and kindergartens across the \nwhole country. By 1970 women made up 45.3% of the labour force, an increase of \nmore than one-quarter compared to 1960 (35.9%). Although the authority of the \u2018master \nof the family\u2019 was greatly reduced, the old patriarchal system survived, especially in the \nhighlands. \nAnother aspect of the communist social agenda, one of the few explicit statements \nconcerning population and the only articulated population policy, is to be found in \nAlbania\u2019s communist constitution, which stated that: \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n286  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \n\u201cThe State gives special protection to the interests of mother and child\u201d. \n \nIn order to improve maternal and child health, medical care and prescriptions for \npregnant mothers and for infants were free. There is a wide range of literature showing \nthat the reduction of infant mortality to historically low levels generally leads to a \nreduction in the level of fertility (van de Walle 1986, Palloni and Rafalimanana. 1999). \nIn the case of Albania, Gjon\u00e7a, Aassve, and Mencarini (2006) found that the survival of \na child had a strong effect on fertility reduction in the country. The 1950s and the 1960s \nsaw most of the improvement in under-five mortality, reducing it to less than half of the \n1950 value. This in itself could explain a significant part of the reduction of fertility in \nthe late 1960s and early 1970s. \n \n \nTable 1: Percentages of female students at different levels of education \n \n 1938 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 \nPrimary education 32.4 45.4 42.3 46.9 47.2 47.9 48.6 \nSecondary education 22.0 28.8 29.8 40.9 44.7 45.0 49.2 \nHigher Education n\/a n\/a 16.6 32.5 49.6 50.1 61.4 \n \nSource: INSTAT 2000). \n \n \n6.3 Transition and the new setting for \u2018family planning\u2019 in Albania, 1990-2006  \nThe period after the collapse of communism was characterized by the introduction of \nmany new laws and policies to regulate the transition to a more market-oriented and \nmodern society. In this context, population policies were no exception. One of the first \nchanges in legislation that the Albanian government introduced in 1991 was the \nlegalization of abortion, which brought about a dramatic increase in their number, from \nalmost zero to about 172 per thousand live births in 2002 (INSTAT, 2003a). \nContraception became widely available, but the level of information and education for \nits use were, and still remain, very low. Another important policy was the increase of \nmaternity leave from six months to nine months. All these changes took place in the \nearly 1990s and should have had some effects on the level of fertility. \nIt is clear that we have a new setting in Albania with regards to fertility change \nduring the 1990s: the introduction of modern methods of birth control, which were non-\nexistent before 1990. However, as Coale (1973) suggests, the availability of \ncontraception is only one of the pre-conditions for a fertility decline. The contrast \nbetween the traditional values of a patriarchal society and the more modern values \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 287 \nimplied by recently introduced family planning policies are reflected in the use of birth \ncontrol. While the practice of abortion has increased rapidly, the use of contraception is \nstill very low, due to a lack of knowledge. Sex education has just been introduced in the \nsecondary system, but it comprises a one-off lecture and is presented only in the \nsecondary school systems in the main cities. It is precisely because of this that Albania \nis not experiencing a decline in fertility as sharp as that experienced in Southern \nEurope. \nIt is worth noting that education continues to remain high on the agenda of \nAlbanians even after the collapse of communism and the introduction of the market \neconomy. The 1990s experienced a few changes with regards to enrolment. The gross \nenrolment rate for primary education has decreased from 102% in 1990 to about 99.8% \nin 2002. While secondary enrolment has decreased from about 80% in 1990 to 44% in \n2002, university enrolment has gone up by 5%. The drop in enrolment for secondary \nschooling is very significant. This may be due to the increased poverty and inequality in \nthe country which has forced a large number of secondary students to enter the labour \nmarket. Illiteracy rates do not show much difference between the overall rates for males \nand females: the LSMS data show an illiteracy rate for males of 2.8% and for females \nof 6.2%; the census data show an even smaller and insignificant difference (1.2% and \n1.9%). For a traditional society such as the Albanian one, this overall parity represents \nthe achievement of social equality between genders, particularly as any remaining \ndifferences can be attributed to illiteracy in the older generations, where female \nilliteracy for over 60 years is about 34.8% and that of males only 12.4%. \nWhen educational attainment is examined, it is clear that overall male\/female \ndifferences are very small. Thus, for primary education the number of female graduates \nis higher at 52% of all graduates. For secondary education female graduates represent \n47% of all graduates. The only level of educational attainment where there is a clear \nmale advantage is the university level, where female graduates comprise just 41% of all \ngraduates. However, this pattern will change in the years to come as the number of new \nstudents registering at university in the last 10 years has increased for females and \ndecreased for males. By 2000 more than 60% of students registered in universities were \nfemale (INSTAT, 2000). \nAnother change that has affected the level of fertility during the transition is the \nhardship caused by the economic development of the country, which is accompanied by \nvery high rates of unemployment. These have increased to about 22.7%, and are even \nhigher for women (28.4%). The data show that recorded unemployment is much higher \nin the 2001 census than in the 1989 census, the last one under communism. This is \nunderstandable as the communists took pride in the \u2018full employment policy\u2019 of their \nadministration. The unemployment figures for women are higher in all areas of the \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n288  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \ncountry and in particular in the urban areas, where the rate reaches a peak of 45.5% \n(excluding Tirana). \nFemale participation in the labour market has decreased from 47.4% in 1989 to \n40.7% in 2001, and 45.1% of women not working outside the home are categorized as \nhousewives. This represents about 22.7% of the total active female population, which \nmeans that the proportion of housewives has increased. Once unemployed or made \nredundant, a woman finds it hard to return to the labour market, particularly in the \nprivate sector, and in most cases she decides to remain at home.  \n \nTable 2: Unemployment rates by sex and place of residence for  \nthe 1989 and 2001 censuses \n \n  1989 Census 2001 Census \nMen \nTirana urban 10.4 19.7 \nOther urban 10.7 22.8 \nRural 5.5 16.4 \nCountry 7.4 18.8 \nWomen \nTirana urban 14.5 34.3 \nOther urban 16.3 45.5 \nRural 10.1 14.5 \nCountry 12.4 28.4 \nTotal \nTirana urban 12.4 26.1 \nOther urban 13.4 33.0 \nRural 7.7 15.7 \nCountry 9.8 22.7 \n \nSource: INSTAT 2004a. \n \nIt is clear that while education continues to be a high priority in Albania, the \nopposite is the case with female employment, as demonstrated by the reduction in the \nnumber of women in the labour force and the higher number unemployed. The increase \nin the number of housewives shows a trend in the country similar to more developed \nsocieties where the percentage of housewives is at comparable levels. Despite this \ntrend, the high unemployment rate among women and the large number of redundancies \nin the 1990s have had an effect on fertility during this period (Gjon\u00e7a, Aassve, and \nMencarini 2006) and will continue to affect it in the coming years. This is believed to \nbe responsible for maintaining the universal first birth feature of Albanian marriages, \neven in the 1990s. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 289 \n7. Concluding notes \u2013 family planning policy in Albania  \nAt about 2.2 children per woman, the level of fertility in Albania continues to be high \ncompared to other European countries. If the trend continues and follows the \nexperiences of other South-Eastern European countries, the next five years will see the \nlevel of fertility in Albania falling below the replacement level. Despite its present high \nlevel by European standards, Albanian fertility dropped dramatically in a short period \nof 50 years from 7 to 2.2 children per woman. \nAt the start of this paper we discussed the interplay between implicit and explicit \npolicies in Albania during the communist period through to the present day. There was \nno explicit population policy in Albania during the period of communist rule until 1990: \nideologically the government linked population growth to economic growth, and since \nthere was already a high-fertility environment, there was no need for any population \npolicy to help increase the level of fertility, as happened in some Eastern European \ncountries. On the one hand, the government implemented a number of health policies \nthat were aimed at reducing infant and maternal mortality, which indirectly affected the \nchanges in fertility in the country. The reduction of infant mortality from 148 to 22 per \nthousand in a period of 50 years had a strong effect in reducing the level of fertility \n(Gjon\u00e7a, Aassve, and Mencarini 2006). On the other hand the government implemented \na considerable number of policies affecting social changes in the country, such as \neducational reform and, in particular, female education reform, which had a large effect \nin reducing fertility. Equal employment and full employment policies were again \npolicies that affected the level of fertility in the country and these were followed by \ncomplementary policies to help mothers, such as a system of government sponsored \nnurseries and kindergartens. All of these policies created a more emancipated \nenvironment for women in which to make their own decision with regard to family \nformation, and all these policies had an indirect effect in reducing fertility. \nThe other dimension of the discussion in this paper was the interplay between \ntraditional and modern values with regard to demographic behaviour in Albania. It was \nargued that Albania was, and to a certain extent still remains, a traditional society with a \npatriarchal social and family organization which has affected a number of the \ndeterminants of fertility, such as marriage and contraception. Large families, common \nin the past, are today only to be found in small numbers in the north of the country. This \nreduced number of siblings living together in the same household also has an indirect \neffect on fertility reduction. Tradition is still affecting the marriage patterns in Albania, \nwith marriage and a first birth being universal and with an early entrance into marriage \nfor both men and women. Cohabitation is rare and the signs are that it is going to \nremain low for a long period to come. This could also be affected by the lack of housing \nand the lack of resources for the young population, which is the poorest compared to all \nGjonca, Aassve & Mencarini: Albania: Trends and patterns, proximate determinants and policies  \n290  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org  \nother age groups in the country (World Bank 2003). The interplay between traditional \nand modern values is also seen in the use of methods of birth control, where traditional \nforms of birth control (withdrawal is the dominant one) are still the norm. The use of \nmodern methods of contraception is slowly but surely increasing, and changes are \nexpected to take place here faster than changes in the marriage pattern. This is due to \nthe availability of contraception and the dissemination of information among the \nyounger population in recent years. \nThis discussion of the factors that affected fertility reduction in Albania was \nstructured around the factors that sought to keep fertility high in Albania and those that \ndecreased fertility over the past 50 years. It is clear from the analyses in this paper that \nthe investments of the communist regime in the social agenda, in particular, policies \nand measures that improved women\u2019s education and position within society and family, \nwere by far the most important determinants in bringing the fertility rate down. \nWhile in many European countries the discussion has been focused for a long time \non ways and policies to increase the level of fertility, in the case of Albania this \ndiscussion is either non-existent or has just started to be recognized by scholars. There \nare two possible explanations for this. First, Albania still has a high level of fertility \ncompared to the rest of Europe. Thus, at this stage of transition, the high level of \nfertility is not a cause for worry for many demographers and policy makers. However, \nand most importantly, this level of fertility has not been sustained over a long period of \ntime. Only ten years ago the level of TFR in Albania was 3 children per woman. Under \nsuch circumstances, the question that needs to be raised is, \u201cShould one wait and see if \nthe level of fertility will continue to decrease, or should there be policies introduced to \nsustain this current level?\u201d Even if the answer is to introduce policies to sustain the \ncurrent level of fertility, that would be very difficult to achieve since the society is \nchanging rapidly from a traditional one to a more modern one and such a change is \nreflected in the demographic behaviour of the population. Second, and even more \nimportantly, to a population that has been denied basic human rights for more than 50 \nyears, the right to the availability and use of the means of birth control is seen as a \nfundamental one. Some family planning programs have already started to be \nimplemented in Albania, but they mainly focus on the use of contraception. It is \nimportant to point out here that Albania still has a high rate of abortion, as well as of \nsexually transmitted diseases. Infant mortality remains high and maternal health is not \nat the levels expected in a developed country. In this respect, policies that would \nintegrate the family planning demands of the population with the issues that address the \nreproductive rights of women and children would probably be the way to implement \nany population policy in Albania. \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 11 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 291 \nReferences  \n8 Nentori Publishing House. 1982.
