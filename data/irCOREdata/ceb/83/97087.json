Introduction\nTumour growth is a complex process that involves a sequence of well-orchestrated events. These include the initial\navascular phase of growth, angiogenesis, the process by which the tumour becomes vascularized, and the vascular\nphase of growth. During the early growth stage, oxygen and other nutrients are delivered to the tumour cells, and the\nwaste products are removed from the tumour, via diffusion from nearby blood vessels, the tumour cells proliferate\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: J.Panovska@hw.ac.uk (J.

Due to diffusion limited supply of nutrients initial (avascular)\ngrowth is limited in size [2]. To grow larger the tumour must complete a sequence of processes that include the\nsecretion of TAFs, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and initiate the angiogenic process. During\nangiogenesis VEGF stimulates the formation of a tumour-specific vascular network from the host vessels. Upon\nsuccessful vascularization oxygen is rapidly supplied to the tumour by the neovasculature so it can grow larger and\nmetastasize. Tumours generally become vascularized after approximately 14\u201321 days [3] and are usually detectable\nonly after they have vascularized and grown larger invading the adjacent healthy tissue.\nThus far it has proved difficult to find a treatment that can control all aspects of tumour growth. In different stages\nof growth different treatments can be relevant. For example, to prevent tumour vascularization, anti-TAF drugs can\nbe administrated or antivascular drugs would aim to kill the neovasculature during angiogenesis. Alternatively, due to\nexcessive proliferation of tumour cells anti-proliferative treatments are also relevant. An ideal treatment would control\ntumour invasion, remove all the tumour cells from the affected region and prevent further tumour cell production,\nwhilst inflicting no damage to the normal tissue [4]. Due to the complexity of tumour growth this is usually not\npossible and currently available tumour therapies include surgical intervention [5], exposure to radiation or laser\ntreatment [6], and injection of anticancer drugs into the bloodstream or the surrounding normal tissue [4].\nThe aim of surgery is to remove as much of the tumour as possible together with the associated blood supply to\narrest its progression. Surgery can also be undertaken as a preventative measure to remove tissue that is not cancerous\nbut is likely to become so. For example, preventative surgery is used to remove precancerous polyps in the colon [5].\nCurative surgery involves the removal of tumours that are confined to one area; it is the main treatment for primary\ntumours that have not metastasized. Unfortunately, many cancers are inoperable due to their location, for example,\nsevere forms of brain tumours [7]. Further, surgery is often undesirable as it is a traumatic process that poses particular\nrisks to elderly and infirm patients.\nRadiation therapy (known as radiotherapy) has long been used to eradicate various tumours, especially those in\ninternal organs, lymphomas and cancers of the prostate [6]. High-powered radiation rays damage tumour cells and\nthereby prevent the tumour from growing. Radiotherapy is often used to destroy tumour tissue that cannot be removed\nwith surgery or to target cancer cells that may remain after surgery. Doctors and scientists are continually striving\nto improve radiation techniques. Some of the suggested improvements are 3D-imaging where doctors can more\naccurately view the tumour mass before to radiation [8] and then focus the radiation at a specific location [9].\nChemotherapy is perhaps the most common anticancer treatment. Treatment may consist of a single drug or a\ncombination, usually delivered orally or by injection [4,7]. Drugs that act on tumour cells can be subdivided into\nthose that target both proliferating and nonproliferating (quiescent) cells in different parts of the tumour mass, and\nthose that target only dividing cells in specific phases of cell division [10]. Some drugs not only kill cancer cells, but\ncan also kill rapidly dividing non-cancerous (host) cells. For example, hair follicles are extinguished, causing severe\nhair loss in chemotherapy patients [11]. The reason that this treatment is feasible is that following treatment normal\ntissue may recover fully whilst the tumour will be removed. A common type of chemotherapy drugs are cell-cycle-\nspecific chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide [12] which acts upon cells in the DNA replication phase of\nthe cycle, or Taxol [13] which more effectively influence cells in the division phase of the cell cycle.\nA more recent treatment involves applications which either target tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs) or attack\nthe new capillaries. Since, in practice a tumour is usually already vascularized when detected, such antiangiogenic\ntherapies are likely to be effective. For example thalidomide is an antiangiogenic drug which acts by inhibiting\nendothelial cell growth and has shown promising results when used to treat kidney tumours [14]. Combretastatin\nis another antiangiogenic drug that is currently in clinical trials and works by causing the immature vasculature inside\nthe solid tumour to collapse [15].\nThe treatments mentioned above used to date have proved to be highly variable from one patient to another. One\nof the main reasons for this high variability is the issue of toxicity of the drugs. Namely, there is a lack of patient\nvolunteers for in vivo clinical trials of new drugs, so many drugs can only be tested in small animals (e.g. mice).\nAlthough successful here, these drugs may be toxic to the human patient and therefore result in disastrous side-\neffects. The delivery of the treatment is also relevant: sometimes when the drugs are delivered to the tumour they can\nbypass large areas of the target. In order to facilitate clinical studies of tumour treatments, theoretical models are being\ndeveloped. These models can be formulated in a mathematical framework and are being viewed as a technique that\ncan complement medical studies in the quest to halt tumour growth. Mathematical modelling can be used to compare\ndifferent treatment protocols and has the potential to reduce significantly the time and money needed to develop and\n562 J. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579\ntest new drugs. This can be achieved by performing numerical simulations of mathematical models in which new drugs\nare tested and optimal protocols determined before being used to guide clinical trials. Mathematical models may also\nbe used to suggest the existence of new mechanisms to explain observed clinical phenomena. In some respects it is\nthe predictive capability of mathematical models that is their most important feature.\nWithin the last three decades a number of mathematical models for tumour growth have been developed. Most\nmodels focus on one particular aspect, for example, avascular growth (e.g. [16,17]), tissue interactions (e.g. [18,19]),\nangiogenesis (e.g. [20\u201323]) or vascular tumour growth (e.g. [24\u201327]). In [28] we formulated and studied a continuum\nmodel that can describe tumour development from the avascular growth phase through tumour angiogenesis to the\nvascular growth phase. The novel aspect of the model developed in [28] was the coupling between the cell densities,\nthe oxygen concentration and the vasculature. For example, when the oxygen concentration falls to low values, tumour\ncells (and to a lesser extent normal cells) secrete TAFs such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that\ninitiate the angiogenic process [29]. This coupling distinguishes our model from existing models of tumour\u2013host\ninteraction [18], tumour angiogenesis [21] and previous models of vascular growth such as [30]. In this paper we\nextend our earlier model to compare the effect of different drugs on tumour growth.\nWe do this by incorporating an equation for a generic drug delivered to the tumour by the vasculature. The drug\ntargets either proliferating cells (cf. doxorubicin [31]), or the angiogenic process (e.g. reduce the influence of VEGF)\nor kill the tumour neovasculature. In [28] it was assumed that both tumour and healthy host cells proliferate, and that\ncells constituting the vasculature simply migrated towards the VEGF source without proliferating. This assumption\nwas based on observations by Sholley and Ferguson [32] which showed that the migration of capillary tips towards\nVEGF is essential for successful angiogenesis and that proliferation within the capillary tips is less important. Thus, in\nour model, a drug with anti-proliferative properties targets only tumour and normal cells. For future reference, we call\nthis \u201cdrug A\u201d. Another key aspect of tumour growth is angiogenesis. Drugs that target this process aim either to reduce\nthe strength of the angiogenic stimuli (VEGF in our case) (cf. inhibitors such as endostatin [33] or angiostatin [34]),\nor to target directly the angiogenic capillary tips (cf. combretastatin [35]). For the rest of this paper we term a drug\nthat reduces the strength of the VEGF field as \u201cdrug B\u201d, and a drug that targets the angiogenic capillary tips as \u201cdrug\nC\u201d. We will also study the effect of a drug that reduces the blood vessel density by targeting the blood vessels that\nproduce the angiogenic tips in the tissue surrounding the tumour. We refer to such a drug as \u201cdrug D\u201d but note, to our\nknowledge, that such a drug is not currently available. We use our simulations to compare its effect against the effects\nof drugs A\u2013C.\nThe incorporation of drugs A\u2013D distinguishes our work from previous chemotherapy models where only one type\nof drug was studied. For example, models that studied the effect of drugs of type A have been developed by Ward and\nKing [36] and Jackson and Byrne [37]. The former model explored the effect of chemotherapy on the rate of tumour\ngrowth in multicellular spheroid and mono-layer cultures, whereas Jackson and Byrne [37] studied the effect of blood-\nborne chemotherapy on two cell types, one of which is more resistant to the drug. Other authors have explored the\neffect of drugs that target the angiogenic stimulus (VEGF) (type B) [26,27] or drugs of types C and D that destroy\n(immature and mature) tumour vessels [38,39].\nA different therapeutic approach was taken by Sinek et al. [40]. They have recently extended the model of Zheng\net al. [41] to develop a multiscale tumour simulator to study the effect of chemotherapy on tumour progression\nthrough its avascular and vascular growth stages. They performed 2-D simulations based on a self-consistent parameter\nestimation that demonstrated the fundamental convective and diffusive transport limitations in delivering anticancer\ndrug into tumours regardless of whether this delivery was via free drug administration (e.g. intravenous drip), via 100\nnm nanoparticles injected into the bloodstream, extravasating and releasing the drug that then diffused into the tumour,\nor via smaller 1\u201310 nm nanoparticles capable of diffusing directly and targeting the individual tumour cell. The results\npredicted that even in a best-case scenario, involving constant drug release from the nanoparticles and a homogeneous,\nnot drug resistant tumour of one cell type, the fundamental transport limitations were severe and drug levels inside the\ntumour were far less than in vitro, leaving large parts of the tumour with inadequate drug concentration.\nCancer chemotherapies have also been studied by Fister and Penetta [42,43]. They used a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations and optimal control techniques to develop optimal strategies for chemotherapy. In particular, the\nauthors investigated the qualitative differences between three different cell-kill models: log-kill hypothesis (cell-kill\nproportional to mass); Norton\u2013Simon hypothesis (cell-kill proportional to growth rate) and Emax hypothesis (cell-kill\nproportional to a saturable function of mass). For each hypothesis, an optimal drug strategy was characterized that\nminimized the cancer mass and the cost (in terms of total amount of drug). Their work modelled well-established drugs\nJ. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579 563\nsuch as metha-trexate, which has been used to treat leukemia in the last 30 years, as well as more speculative drugs\nwhich are currently unavailable [43]. Their numerical results showed the qualitatively different treatment schemes\nfor each hypothesis. In particular, they predicted that the log-kill hypothesis required less drug compared to the\nNorton\u2013Simon hypothesis to reduce the cancer an equivalent amount over the treatment interval.\nIn contrast to the spatially-averaged models developed by Sinek et al. [40] or Fister et al. [42,43] we use non-linear\npartial differential equations to study the response of vascular and avascular tumours to different chemotherapeutic\ndrugs. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our mathematical model, focusing our\ndescription on the drug and how it is incorporated into our earlier model of vascular tumour growth. We briefly\nrecap our results from [28] in Section 3. In Sections 4\u20136 we illustrate the types of behaviour that result when a\none-dimensional tumour is exposed to a single chemotherapeutic drug. The tumour\u2019s response to combinations of\nthese drugs is investigated in Sections 7 and 8. Finally, we present our conclusions and comment on future research\ndirections in Section 9.\n2. Mathematical model\nIn this section we extend the mathematical model for vascular tumour growth from [28] to include an equation\nfor a blood-borne therapeutic drug with different modes of action. We recall that tumour growth, via invasion of the\nsurrounding host cells and angiogenesis, is a multi-dimensional process. In this paper, however, as in [28], we average\nthe dependent variables in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the invasion of the tumour front and we restrict\nattention to one spatial dimension. This direction is chosen to be parallel to the line connecting the limbus, situated at\nx = 0 and where the nearest host blood vessels are found, to the tumour centre at x = 1 (in dimensionless terms). We\nintroduce independent variables t and x representing, respectively, time and spatial position in a direction parallel to\nthat of tip growth.\nWithin our modelling framework we consider two types of dependent variables: those that contribute to the tumour\nvolume and those of negligible volume. The former category comprise the healthy (host) cell density n1(x, t), the\ntumour cell density n2(x, t), the capillary tip density n3(x, t) and the density of the blood vessels b(x, t). Variables\nof negligible volume are the nutrient concentration a(x, t) (here taken to be oxygen), the TAF concentration c(x, t)\n(here vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and the drug concentration d(x, t).\nWe now describe these equations, noting that details can be found in [28].\nFollowing [18], in the absence of therapy, we use nonlinear reaction\u2013diffusion equations to model the tumour and\nnormal cell densities. We also assume that the normal tissue is immobile. As in [18] we assume that the tumour is\nunable to spread unless the surrounding healthy tissue is below its carrying capacity. Thus the expansion of the tumour\ninto the adjacent tissue depends on its composition and we assume that the random motion coefficient for the tumour\ncell density depends on the density of the surrounding normal cells. We also include competition between the host and\nthe tumour cells for space and oxygen through simple Lotka\u2013Volterra competition. Unlike [18], the equations we use\nfor the tumour and the host cell density are coupled via the oxygen equation, rather than hydrogen ion density H+ (the\nlatter provides a measure of the local pH). We assume that oxygen is blood-borne and that it controls cell proliferation\nand cell death. These assumptions are based on experimental observations of tumour\u2013host interactions in the presence\nand absence of oxygen [1]. Following [44,21], and as in [28] we use the \u2018snail-trail\u2019 modelling of fungal growth [45]\nto describe the interactions between the vasculature and the VEGF. We assume that tip cells dictate the movement of\nthe vascular front. One novel feature of [28] was the introduction of a nonlinear chemotaxis coefficient to describe\ncapillary tip movement towards the tumour. We keep this assumption here also. The branching of the blood vessels\nis influenced by VEGF and leads to the production of capillary tips. We incorporate vessel remodelling by including\nlogistic growth in Eq. (6). The key assumption in the model from [28] is that hypoxic cells secrete VEGF and this\ninitiates the angiogenic process. Thus Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) couple to Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) via the blood-borne delivery of oxygen\nin (3) and also the assumed production of VEGF by the tumour and normal cells under low oxygen (see Eq. (4)).\nWe summarize the (dimensionless) equations for the host n1(x, t) and the tumour n2(x, t) cell densities, the oxygen\nconcentration a(x, t), the capillary tip density n3(x, t), the blood vessel density b(x, t) and the VEGF concentration\nc(x, t) as follows:\n\u2202n1\n\u2202t\n= r1\u03c11a\n1+ \u03c11a n1 \u2212 r1n\n2\n1 \u2212\nR1n1\n1+ \u03c11a \u2212 c1n1n2, (1)\n564 J.

(6)\nand we refer the reader to [28] for further details.\nIn order to study the effect of therapy on vascular tumour growth, we now couple Eqs. (1)\u2013(6) with an equation\nfor a generic drug d(x, t). We assume that the spatiotemporal evolution of the drug concentration is influenced by\ndiffusion, its delivery by the vessels and its loss due to uptake by the relevant cells. In dimensionless terms we write\n(see [46] for more details)\n\u000fd\n\u2202d\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n2d\n\u2202x2\n+ \u0393b(1\u2212 d)\u2212 \u03b21\u03c15n1\n1+ \u03c15n1 d \u2212\n\u03b22\u03c16n2\n1+ \u03c16n2 d \u2212 \u03b23cd \u2212\n\u03b24\u03c15n3\n1+ \u03c15n3 d \u2212\n\u03b25\u03c15b\n1+ \u03c15bd \u2212 \u03bb3d.\nWe model drug delivery by the vasculature using the source term \u0393b(1\u2212 d) which is similar to the source term in (3).\nDepending on which of drugs A\u2013D we are studying, different sink terms are present in (7). When drug A is being used\nthe terms \u03b21\u03c15n11+\u03c15n1 d and\n\u03b22\u03c16n2\n1+\u03c16n2 d describe its uptake at rates \u03b21 and \u03b22 by the normal and tumour cells respectively (see\nTable 1). Similarly \u03b23cd represents the rate at which drug B is neutralized by VEGF, and the term\n\u03b24\u03c15n3\n1+\u03c15n3 d is used\nwhen drug C is being studied. For drug D the term \u03b25\u03c15b1+\u03c15bd describes its uptake by endothelial cells that line the blood\nvessels. Finally, in (7) we assume that, regardless of its type, the drug undergoes natural decay at rate \u03bb3.\nTo complete our model we now modify Eqs. (1)\u2013(7) to account for the action of the drug, the term that is active\ndepending on whether drug A, B, C or D is being used. When drugs A, B, C or D are used, additional sink terms are\nincluded in the Eqs. (1) and (2), (4) and (5) or (6) as appropriate. We assume that these sink terms are proportional to\nthe sink terms in (7) that describe the uptake or neutralization of drugs A\u2013D by the appropriate variables on which they\nact (cells, VEGF or vessels). The functional forms for the therapeutic effect are included in Table 1. We note that the\nparameters\u2206i (i = 1, 2, . . . , 5) represent the maximum potency whereas \u03c1i (i = 1, 2, . . . , 5) represent the sensitivity\nof drugs A\u2013D on the normal and tumour cells, VEGF, angiogenic capillaries or the blood vessels respectively (see\nTable 1).\nIncorporating the features outlined in Table 1 into Eqs.

(16)\nWe note that in practice, at t = 0, the tumour may not yet have elicited angiogenic response or it may already be\nvascularized. The boundary and initial conditions we use are analogous to those from [28] and we assume that initially\nsome tumour cells are situated at x = 1 awaiting angiogenesis. Experimental studies by Stokes and Lauffenburger [47]\nsuggest that during angiogenesis there is a one-off formation of the capillary tips at x = t = 0. After this time capillary\ntips no longer originate from the limbus and instead they move away, so that the density at the limbus decreases. Based\non these observations, and following [21], we impose the boundary condition n3(0, t) = e\u2212kt , where k represents the\nrate of tip decrease at the limbus. Blood-borne removal of VEGF at the limbus is modelled by imposing a mixed\nboundary condition of the form \u2202c\n\u2202x (0, t) = p1bc, where p1 represents the rate of VEGF removal by the vessels at the\nlimbus. The host vessels supply the region with oxygen and drug and therefore we have \u2202a\n\u2202x (0, t) = \u2212hb(1 \u2212 a) and\n\u2202d\n\u2202x (0, t) = \u2212\u0393b(1 \u2212 d), where h and \u0393 represent the rates of oxygen and drug delivery by the limbal vessels.

(7)\u2013(16) in the absence of therapy. The normal n1 (\u2212) and\nthe tumour cell density n2 (\u2212\u2212) propagate as waves of normal cell regression and tumour invasion, respectively, before and after successful\nvascularization (a)\u2013(d); or when the normal cells are better competitors the tumour density regresses (e) in which case angiogenesis is unsuccessful.\nAfter successful vascularization the tumour grows larger ((b) and (d)). During angiogenesis in (a) and (c) the capillary tips n3 (\u2212.\u2212) propagate\nfrom the limbus towards the tumour with increasing speed and increased maximum density. Post angiogenesis, tip profiles propagate with constant\nspeed and either increase to a maximum value within the tumour mass (b) or decrease towards the tumour centre (d). The results are shown at\ndimensionless t = 5, 10, 15 in (a), (c) and (e) and t = 20, 25 and 30 in (b) and (d).

Since we do not require boundary\nconditions for n1 and b (see (7) and (12)), Eq. (14) complete our specifications at x = 0.\nWe assume symmetry of the tumour about its centre and hence impose no flux boundary conditions for n2, a, c, n3\nand d at x = 1 (see Eq. (15)). As before we do not need to specify boundary conditions for n1 (see (7)) and b (see\n(12)) at x = 1.\nThe initial profiles for n1, n2, a, n3, b and d in (16) are chosen to be smooth functions that are consistent with the\nboundary conditions. We assume that initially some tumour cells are located at x = 1 and that the rest of the domain\nis filled with normal cells. Initially the vasculature is only present near the limbus, the region is well-oxygenated and\nthere is no VEGF present.\n3. Summary of results from [28]\nBefore we proceed with analysis of the system of equations (7)\u2013(16) we present a brief summary of the results\nfrom [28] describing vascular tumour growth in absence of therapy.\nOur results in [28] suggest that, in the absence of therapy, the tumour first undergoes a stage of initial avascular\ngrowth which is characterized by invasion of the host tissue. Following successful angiogenesis the tumour grows\nas a vascular tumour (see Fig. 1(a)\u2013(e)). Vascular growth is characterized by a rapid increase in tumour density and\nincreased speed of invasion. Furthermore our model predicts that tumour\u2013host interactions control vascular tumour\ngrowth. Recalling that c1 and c2 represent the adverse effect of the tumour cells on the normal cells and vice versa, we\nJ.

(a) Diagram showing how the competition parameter space (c1, c2) can be decomposed into distinct regions depending on the long time\nbehaviour of the model solutions, for two different values of \u03bb2 before any therapy. In (a) \u03bb2 = 5 and in (b) \u03bb2 = 50 with the rest of the parameters\nas per Fig. 1. Three outcomes are evident: the tumour and host cells coexist in region M, tumour cells dominate in region P and the tumour is\ncleared by the host cells in region Q.\npredict that before chemotherapy the (c1, c2) parameter space contains distinct regions M, P and Q where tumour\u2013host\ninteractions result in different long term solutions (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)). In region P the tumour eventually dominates\nand replaces the normal cells; in region Q the normal cells dominate and replace the tumour cells; in region M the\ntumour coexists with the normal cells. The bifurcation curves that divide these regions depend on \u03bb2, a parameter\nwhich represents the rate at which oxygen is consumed by the tumour cells (see Eq. (9)).\nIn the next five sections we explore how the vascular tumour growth dynamics described above changes in the\npresence of three different treatment strategies used in isolation or in combination. We compare tumour growth to that\nin [28].\n4. Therapy targets proliferating cells (drug A)\nIn this section we use Eqs. (7)\u2013(16) to study the effect of a drug that targets the proliferating cells. We assume that\ndrug A is delivered to the vascular tumour by the vasculature and that it does not target VEGF or the vasculature.\nAccordingly we fix \u22063 = \u22064 = \u22065 = 0 and \u03b23 = \u03b24 = \u03b25 = 0 in Eqs. (7)\u2013(16).\nWe use the NAG library routine DO3PCF to perform our numerical simulations. This routine discretizes the\nequations using finite differences and solves the resulting system of ordinary differential equations using backward\ndifferentiation [48]. We find that, depending on the parameter values, the system admits 3 qualitatively different types\nof behaviour: the tumour undergoes vascular growth (i.e. chemotherapy with drug A is ineffective and profiles are as\nper Fig. 3(a)); the tumour experiences arrested growth with the tumour mass reaching a finite size (limited success\nof the drug A and profiles as per Fig. 3(b)) or it is eliminated (successful treatment with drug A and profiles as per\nFig. 3(c)).\nThe key (dimensionless) parameters associated with incorporating different tumour types in our model are c1, c2,\n\u03bb2, r4, \u22061,\u22062 and \u03b22. The parameters associated with drug A are \u22061,\u22062, \u03b21, \u03b22, Dd ,\u0393 and \u03bb3. Where possible\nwe use published data for the treatment of nude mice with the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin that targets proliferating\ncells. In Table 2 we list these parameters, their dimensional and dimensionless values and the source of the parameter\nestimates. Experimental studies involving doxorubicin [49,51] suggest that it induces apoptosis in tumour and healthy\ncells but that normal tissue is more resistant to therapy because its uptake is about a tenth that of the tumour cells [49].\nMotivated by this we assume that (dimensionless) \u03b21 \u001c \u03b22.\nWe use results from [28] to fix the other model parameters so that in the absence of therapy the tumour becomes\nvascularized after 14 days. Upon vascularization chemotherapy with drug A is initiated. The different outcomes\npresented in Fig. 3(a)\u2013(c) can be obtained from our mathematical model by varying the parameters \u22061,\u22062 and \u03b22.\nWe explore (\u22061,\u22062, \u03b22) parameter space and present our results in Fig. 4(a) and (b). We constructed Fig. 4(a) and (b)\nby solving the Eqs. (7)\u2013(16) numerically for different values for \u22061,\u22062 and \u03b22 to determine the bifurcation curves\nthat represent the transitions between different regions.\n568 J.

[31]\nWe find that the (\u22061,\u22062) parameter space partitions into four distinct regions I\u2013IV depending on whether the\ndensity of the tumour and the normal cells are reduced when drug A is present. In region I neither the tumour cell nor\nthe normal cell density is reduced and the vascular tumour growth proceeds as if no drug was applied (see Fig. 4(a)).\nWhen (\u22061,\u22062) lie in region II the waves of tumour invasion that were present prior to chemotherapy are replaced\neither by waves of tumour regression or tumour invasion is halted and the normal cell density is not reduced (profiles\nare similar to those in Fig. 3(b) and (c)). In this case chemotherapy effectively controls tumour invasion and arrests\nvascular tumour growth. When (\u22061,\u22062) lie in regions III or IV (see Fig. 4(a)), then either both the tumour and the\nnormal cell densities are reduced or only the normal cell density is reduced.

In one case the therapy removes the tumour (\u2212.\u2212) so the total density decreases\nto zero, whilst in the other case tumour growth saturates (\u2212). In the former case we fix \u22061 = 0.1, \u22062 = 10 and \u03b22 = 0.5 and in the latter case\n\u22061 = 0.1,\u22062 = 25, \u03b22 = 2. The rest of the parameters are as per Fig. 1(a) and (b) and we calculate the values numerically. Avascular growth is\ncalculated when we fix\u22061 = \u22062 = \u03b22 = 0 and \u03c8 = 1, \u03b7 = 10 with the rest of the parameters as per Fig. 1(a) and (b).\na tumour growing in a dead host. We consider this case as biologically irrelevant. The former case corresponds to death\nof the tumour and the host with the normal cell density reaching to zero before the tumour is cleared. Hence our sim-\nulations suggest that an antiproliferative drug is effective only when\u22061 \u001c \u22062 (region II of Fig. 4(a)). The biological\ninterpretation of our results is drug A will be successful in controlling tumour growth only if it has negligible impact\non the normal cells, and high potency on the tumour cells. These results are consistent with experimental observations.\nFor example in [49] doxorubicin was shown to be effective in human Ewing\u2019s carcinoma if its toxicity to tumour cells\nwas large and its toxicity to healthy tissue was negligible. As \u22062, i.e. the potency of the drug A on the tumour cells,\nincreases in region II, the tumour is cleared more quickly and thus the therapy is more effective (see Fig. 4(c)).\nOur simulations show that the response to drug A also depends on the dimensionless parameter \u03b22 that characterizes\nthe drug\u2019s uptake by the tumour cells (see Eq. (13)). Keeping the rest of the parameters fixed so that prior to therapy\nthe tumour dominates the healthy cells, vascularizes and invades the adjacent tissue, in Fig. 4(b) we decompose the\n(\u22062, \u03b22) parameter space into distinct regions based on the predicted therapeutic outcome. The diagram shows that\neither the therapy is not effective in controlling vascular invasion (region N), tumour invasion of the host tissue is\n570 J. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579\nreversed and the tumour regresses (region R), or tumour invasion of the host tissue is halted and the tumour undergoes\nsaturated growth (region S). When \u03b22 and \u22062 are small we predict that the therapy is ineffective: proliferation of the\ntumour and normal cells is unaffected by the drug and so the tumour continues to grow and invade. As \u03b22 and \u22062\nincrease, corresponding respectively to an increase in the rate at which the tumour cells uptake the drug, or an increase\nin its potency, the rate of cell death increases, tumour invasion is reversed and the tumour eventually eliminated (in\nregion R of Fig. 4(b)). These results are consistent with in vivo observations [49] showing an increase in the rate of\ntumour cell death and possible tumour clearance when the rate at which tumour cells uptake the drug doxorubicin\nand\/or its potency are increased. These results are also consistent with theoretical predictions concerning doxorubicin\nthat were developed by Jackson [50]. In contrast to [50] our results suggest the existence of a region (region S)\nin which the tumour undergoes saturated growth and does not regress. Saturated growth in previous mathematical\nmodels (e.g. Ward and King [17]) is a consequence of the degradation of the necrotic material in the tumour centre.\nUnless this occurs there is no saturated tumour growth. However, to the best of our knowledge arrested growth has\nnot been captured in previous mathematical models for anti-proliferative therapies, although it has been observed\nin vivo tumours [49,51].\nThe response to the simulated anti-proliferative chemotherapy depends markedly on the competitive effects of the\ntumour cells on the normal cells (c1) and vice versa (c2). Next we investigate how the distinct regions M, P and Q of\nthe (c1, c2) parameter space (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)) change upon application of therapy. When the therapy is of limited\nsuccess ((\u22062, \u03b22) \u2208 S in Fig. 4(b)) our results suggest a change in the long time solutions characterized by the shifts:\nM \u2192 Q so that the region where tumour\u2013host coexistence was present before therapy is replaced by a region where\nthe tumour is cleared following treatment with drug A; and a shift P \u2192 M so that the region of tumour dominance\nand invasion before therapy is replaced by a region in which invasion is controlled and the tumour is growth arrested\nfollowing treatment with drug A. When the therapy is successful ((\u22062, \u03b22) \u2208 R in Fig. 4(b)) the tumour is cleared\nfor any values of the competition parameters c1 and c2 and in the respective Fig. 2(a) and (b) the following shifts are\nevident: M \u2192 Q and P \u2192 Q. These results suggest that drug A applied to a tumour that dominates the host tissue\nwill clear the tumour if its potency and uptake by the tumour cells are large ((\u22062, \u03b22) \u2208 R in Fig. 4(b)). When drug A\nis applied to a tumour that coexists with the host cells, we predict that neither its potency on the tumour cells nor its\nuptake need be large for the therapy to successfully remove the tumour. In this case for values (\u22062, \u03b22) \u2208 S or R in\nFig. 4(a) and (b) the longtime solutions are characterized by the shifts M \u2192 Q and P \u2192 Q in the (c1, c2) parameter\nspace in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Therefore in the longtime the region of tumour dominance or tumour\u2013host coexistence is\nreplaced by a region where healthy host cells dominate. These results allow us to predict that success of treatment\nwith drug A depends on the drug\u2019s potency and its rate of uptake by the tumour cells, as well as the composition of\nthe tissue in the tumour surrounding.\nWe note that in our results the success of treatment with drug A does not depend on the rate of drug\u2019s uptake by\nthe normal cells. From Table 2 and also in results from [52], the uptake by the normal cells is an order of magnitude\nless than that by the tumour cells. Thus in our simulations, the uptake by the normal cells was O(1) and its increase\ndis not alter the results.\nOur simulations also suggest that when (c1, c2) \u2208 Q in Fig. 2(a) and (b) so that before therapy the host tissue is a\nbetter competitor and dominates the tumour cells, the tumour will be cleared regardless of the strength of the therapy\n(region Q does not change when drug A is administered).\nWe also run simulations where at one point the therapy with drug A is switched off and then switched on again (by\ndecreasing or increasing \u03b22 and \u22062 below or above their thresholds in Fig. 4(b) as appropriate after a few timesteps).\nOur results predict that in such a case the longtime behaviour of the tumour resembles tumour growth in absence of\ntherapy studied in [28]. The longtime solutions of the tumour and host cell density depend on the competition param-\neters c1 and c2 and two qualitative outcomes are evident: either the tumour undergoes vascularization and grows as a\nvascular tumour either replacing the healthy cells ((c1, c2) \u2208 P in Fig. 2(a) and (b)) or coexisting with them ((c1, c2) \u2208\nM in Fig. 2(a) and (b)); or the tumour is cleared by the healthy cells ((c1, c2) \u2208 Q in Fig. 2(a) and (b)). These results\npredict that continuous infusion with antiproliferative drug A is required to control vascular tumour growth.\n5. Therapy targets VEGF (drug B)\nIn this section we use the Eqs. (7)\u2013(16) to study the effect of a drug that targets the angiogenic stimulant VEGF.\nWe assume that drug B is delivered to the vascular tumour by the vasculature and that it does not target proliferating\nJ. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579 571\ncells or the vasculature. Accordingly we fix \u22061 = \u22062 = \u22064 = \u22065 = 0 and \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b24 = \u03b25 = 0 in Eqs. (7)\u2013(16)\nso that the drug only has antiVEGF properties.\nNumerical simulations suggest that continuous infusion with a drug of type B gives rise to two qualitatively\ndifferent outcomes: either the drug is ineffective and the tumour continues to undergo vascular growth or it is\nsuccessful, the vasculature is eliminated and the tumour undergoes avascular growth. Qualitatively speaking, tumour\ninvasion of the healthy cells is unaltered by this therapy but the speed of invasion is reduced, being similar to that\nprior to tumour vascularization. As a result the tumour grows more slowly than in the absence of therapy. The key\nparameters that control whether this therapy succeeds (and makes the tumour resume avascular growth) are \u22063, its\npotency on the tumour cells, and r4, the (maximum) rate of VEGF secretion by the tumour.\nFollowing effective antiVEGF therapy the tumour profiles are similar to the profiles depicted in Fig. 1(a), and\nrepresent avascular growth with decreased cell density behind the leading tumour front. This resembles the growth\nof multicellular spheroids in vitro [2] where the tumour cell density decreases from the outer edge of the tumour\ntowards the centre. We recall that our results in [28] suggest that in the absence of therapy the tumour grows as an\navascular tumour if tip chemotaxis towards VEGF is weak. Therefore the effect of antiVEGF therapy is the same as\nif tip chemotaxis is sufficiently reduced: in both cases the tumour undergoes avascular growth only.\nIn Fig. 5(a) we show how the (\u22063, r4) parameter space splits into two regions depending on the long term model\nsolutions. Either the tumour evolves to a large and invasive vascular tumour (ineffective therapy in region V2 of\nFig. 5(a)) or (under effective therapy in region V1 of Fig. 5(a)) there is a reduction in its vascular density and the\ncorresponding vascular profiles differ from those during successful angiogenesis (compare Fig. 6(a) and (b) with\nFig. 6(c) and (d)). The tumour grows slower following antiVEGF therapy (see Fig. 5(b)) in agreement with the results\nfrom [26].\nOur simulations suggest that under hypoxia (induced by large consumption of oxygen i.e. large \u03bb2) the therapy fails\nif too much VEGF is produced by the hypoxic tumour cells i.e. when r4 is above a certain threshold, regardless of the\nsize of \u22063. This agrees with clinical studies in which the drug Thrombospondin was used as an antiVEGF drug [53].\nThis therapy was effective under hypoxia only when low levels of VEGF were secreted regardless of the amount of\nthe antiVEGF drug Thrombospondin administered [53].\nAlthough antiVEGF therapy can transform a vascular tumour into its avascular counterpart, it cannot prevent\ntumour invasion. Our simulations suggest that tumour invasion is independent of the success of the antiVEGF therapy\nand is controlled instead by the strength of tumour\u2013host competition (by the parameters c1 and c2). The qualitative\nform of the (c1, c2) parameter space resembles that in Fig. 2(a) and (b) with three distinct regions evident. In these\nregions either (i) the tumour cells dominate and replace the normal cells (region P); (ii) the normal cells dominate and\nreplace the tumour cells (region Q); or (iii) the tumour and host cells coexist (region M).\nWe also run simulations where at one point the antiVEGF therapy is switched off (by decreasing \u22063 below its\nthreshold as in Fig. 5(a) after a few timesteps) and then switched on again. Our results predict that in such a case the\ntumour will become vascularized in the long time although the time for tips to reach the tumour is slightly longer.\nIn particular, when we keep \u22063 large for the first five dimensionless timesteps and then decrease it to zero, the time\nof tumour tip-contact is approximately 21 (dimensional) days after the initial time. Therefore having the anti-VEGF\ntherapy effective initially has lengthened the vascularization time compared to 15 days in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(d) if no therapy\nwas initially present. The longtime profiles resemble those in Fig. 1(b) or 1(c) depending on the choice for c1 and\nc2. If the therapy is initially on for five timesteps, then is switched off for five timesteps and then switched on again,\nqualitatively the results represent unsuccessful antiVEGF therapy. In the long time the tumour remains vascular and\ndoes nor revert to avascular growth. These results predict that when the antiVEGF therapy is not being administered\ncontinuously the tumour becomes vascularized. Once antiVEGF therapy is switched off the tumour initiates and\ncompletes angiogenesis rapidly, and even though we then increase \u22063 so (\u22063, r4) \u2208 V1 in Fig. 5(a), the tumour\ndoes not revert to an avascular mass. Instead it grows as an invasive vascular tumour. Therefore our model predicts\nthat discontinuous antiVEGF therapy is not effective anticancer treatment. This result is expected since although\nantiVEGF therapy will reduce the VEGF influence in the region preventing further angiogenesis, it will not affect the\nneovasculature formed in the time when the antiVEGF therapy is switched off.\n6. Therapy targets the tumour vasculature (drug C or drug D)\nAn alternative to antiproliferative or antiVEGF therapy involves targeting the tumour vasculature with antivascular\n572 J.

This parameter space is determined by detailed numerical simulation. The rest of the parameter\nvalues are as per Fig. 1(a) with the tumour being the better competitor and (c1, c2) \u2208 P from Fig. 2(a) and (b).

(d) Diagram illustrating how the (\u22065,\u22064) parameter spaces can be decomposed into distinct regions\ndepending on the long time behaviour of the model solutions. The regions are determined depending on whether in the long term the vascular\ncontent in the region is destroyed and the tumour grows avascularly (regions I3 and I4), only the angiogenic capillary density is reduced (region\nI2), or the therapy has no impact and the tumour grows as a vascular tumour (region I1).\ndrugs such as cyclophosphomide [12] or combretastatin CAP4 [35]. In this section we use Eqs. (7)\u2013(16) to study\nthe effect of drugs with such anti-vascular properties. We distinguish between anti-vascular drugs that target\nthe (immature) capillary tips and those that destroy the (mature) blood vessels in the peritumoural environment.\nAccordingly we assume that drugs C or D are delivered to the vascular tumour by the vasculature, that they do\nnot affect the proliferating cells or the VEGF and we investigate the impact on the tumour\u2019s growth dynamics of\ncontinuous infusion with such drugs. To focus on drugs that target only the vasculature we set \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b23 = \u22061 =\n\u22062 = \u22063 = 0 and assume that \u22064,\u22065 > 0.\nIn the absence of suitable experimental data, we assume that the diffusion coefficient and the delivery rate of the\nantivascular drugs are similar to those of an anti-proliferative drug. Accordingly we fix Dd and \u0393 at levels similar to\nthose used in Section 4.\nFollowing their successful delivery, the potency of drugs C or D dictates whether they reduce the density of the\nangiogenic capillaries only or reduce the density of all tumour blood vessels.\nWhen drug C is employed tumour dynamics are controlled by the balance between its potency (\u22064) and the rate\nat which vessels produce tips (p2). Effective therapy with drug C reduces the density of the angiogenic tips only, and\nJ. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579 573\nFig. 6. Series of plots illustrating the profiles of the capillary tips and the vessel density during unsuccessful angiogenesis (a) and (b) and during\nsuccessful angiogenesis with brush border (c) and (d). The parameters are as in Fig. 1(a) apart from \u03b3 = 19, \u03b7 = 50 for (a) and (b) and\n\u03b3 = 1, \u03b7 = 1.5 for (c) and (d). We plot the profiles at dimensionless t = 5, . . . , 20.\nin so doing slows tumour growth rate. We note that the vessel density is slightly reduced but blood vessels persist in\nthe peritumoural environment. Spatial gradients of VEGF mean that tumour vascularization is ongoing but angiogenic\ntips are destroyed with drug C. The reduction in tip density is most dramatic when \u22064 \u001d p2 and the drug\u2019s potency\nis much greater than the rate of tip production. In this case existing tips are killed more rapidly than new ones can be\nproduced. Consequently the treated tumour grows more slowly than its untreated counterpart (see Fig. 7(a)). Finally,\nwe remark that the dynamics of the tumour\u2013host interactions are unchanged following treatment with drug C. As a\nresult the (c1, c2) parameter space has the same qualitative decomposition as in Fig. 2(a) and (b) (results for drug C\nnot shown).\nWhen drug D is delivered to the tumour its overall growth rate is retarded when drug potency on the blood vessels\n(\u22065) is large (see Fig. 7(a)). In this case the host blood vessels are destroyed and no new tips can be produced.\nAngiogenic tips that have reached the tumour prior to therapy will not be destroyed, so while some neovasculature\nmay occur at the tumour site, further angiogenesis is prevented. However since the blood vessels in the peritumoural\nenvironment deliver oxygen as well as drugs, their destruction makes the region hypoxic. This affects the growth\ndynamics and in our simulations is manifested by a decrease in the overall density of the healthy tissue. This is an\nundesirable outcome and suggests that treatment with drug D may have a strongly deleterious effect on the normal\ntissue. Although our simulations show that normal and tumour cell densities are reduced following such treatment, the\ndynamics of the tumour\u2013host interactions remain unaltered. In particular, if the tumour (or the normal) cells dominate\nprior to therapy they will continue to do so following therapy. Equally if tumour\u2013host coexistence is present before\ntreatment it will persist after therapy. Therefore the (c1, c2) parameter space is similar to that presented in Fig. 2(a)\nand (b).\nNext we compare the effects of drugs C and D. In our simulations targeting the angiogenic vasculature (drug C)\n574 J. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579\nFig. 7. (a) and (b) Numerically calculated increase in the total number of tumour cells calculated as\n\u222b\nn2(x, t)dx from our simulations. We plot this\nvalue at different times. We contrast the rate of increase when the tumour only completes the avascular growth phase to that when it can become\nvascularized, as well as to the rate of growth in presence of single (a) and combined (b) antivascular therapies. These results are obtained when we\nsolve (7)\u2013(16) for parameter values depending on which therapy is effective.\nresults in a vascular tumour with a small density of angiogenic vessels and large density of host blood vessels. In\ncontrast, targeting the blood vessels (drug D) will diminish the vessel density of the vascular tumour whilst some\nangiogenic capillaries will persist at the tumour site. In Fig. 7(a) we observe that following treatment with drugs C\nor D reduces the overall growth of the tumour mass. These growth curves lie between those for an untreated vascular\ntumour and an untreated avascular tumour. The tumour grows more rapidly when drug C is applied (see Fig. 7(a)).\nAs mentioned previously, the potency of drugs C and D (\u22064 and \u22065) are key parameters that control their efficacy\nin our simulations. In Fig. 5(d) we decompose the (\u22064,\u22065) parameter space into distinct regions depending on the\nlong time vascular content. Four distinct regions are observed. In region I1 the therapy has no impact and the tumour\nretains a large vascular component of both blood vessels and angiogenic tips. In region I2 drug C is effective and\nthe impact of drug D is negligible. Hence only angiogenic vasculature is destroyed. Similarly in region I4 drug D is\neffective and drug C is not. In this region blood vessels are destroyed, but any tips that reached the tumour before\ntherapy will not be destroyed. Finally in region I3 both drugs C and D are effective: the angiogenic tips and the\nblood vessels are destroyed, reducing the overall vascular content to zero. The tumour growth rate reduces to that for\navascular growth (see Fig. 7(a) and (b)). Therefore we predict that antivascular therapy will cause a vascular tumour\nto revert to an avascular form only when it destroys both the angiogenic tips and the blood vessels. We note, however,\nthat for the potency rates in region I4 of Fig. 5(d), the healthy cell density is reduced. As mentioned previously, this is\na consequence of the hypoxia that occurs when the oxygen-bearing host blood vessels are destroyed.\nAs for antiVEGF therapy, in our model successful antivascular therapy can transform a vascular tumour to its\navascular counterpart, but cannot prevent tumour invasion. The qualitative form of (c1, c2) parameter space resembles\nthat in Fig. 2(a) and (b): the tumour cells dominate and replace the normal cells (region P); the normal cells dominate\nand replace the tumour cells (region Q); or the tumour and host cells coexist (region M).\nWe also run numerical simulations where anti-vascular therapy is switched off after a few time steps and then\nswitched on again (by first decreasing and then increasing \u22064 and \u22065 below and above the thresholds so they belong\nto regions I1 and I3 in Fig. 5(d)). Our results suggest that the tumour will become vascularized in the long time but the\ntime of tumour-tip contact is greater the longer we keep the antivascular therapy switched on. In particular, keeping\nthe potency rates large, and therapy effective, in the first five timesteps and then decreasing them to zero, so therapy\nis ineffective, increases the vascularization time from 15 (dimensional) days in absence of any initial therapy to 23\ndays. The profiles resemble those in Fig. 1(b) and (c) depending on the choices of competition parameters c1 and c2.\nTherefore we predict that continuous infusion with antivascular drugs C and D is required to control vascular tumour\ngrowth.\nJ. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579 575\n7. Combined antiVEGF and antivascular therapy (drug B, drug C and\/or drug D)\nThus far we have studied the response of a vascular tumour to continuous infusion with antiproliferative, antiVEGF\nor anti-vascular drugs. Our results suggest that the antiproliferative therapy (drug A) is most effective in controlling\nvascular tumour growth since it can either reverse tumour invasion and clear the tumour or arrest its progression (see\nFig. 3(c) and (b) respectively). In contrast, delivery of drug B, or a combination of drugs C and D reduces the overall\ntumour growth but does not control tumour invasion.\nIn this section we investigate the effect of infusing the vascular tumour with a combination of drugs B, C and D\nand, in so doing, study the impact of combined antiVEGF and antivascular therapies. To focus on therapy that targets\nthe VEGF stimulant and the vasculature we set \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u22061 = \u22062 = 0 and vary \u22063,\u22064 and\/or \u22065 respectively.\nOur numerical simulations suggest two qualitatively different outcomes: either the tumour reverts to avascular\ngrowth (successful combined therapy) or it continues to undergo vascular growth (ineffective combined therapy). In\nparticular the outcome is the same as that for effective treatment with drug B, or a combination of drugs C and D.\nFurther tumour invasion is not altered when these therapies are applied.\nWhen the tumour resumes avascular growth the vascular density is reduced and tumour growth rate retarded. Our\nsimulations predict that this situation rises in the following cases:\n1. When the angiogenic capillaries are destroyed (drug C) and the influence of the VEGF is reduced (drug B);\n2. When the blood vessels surrounding the tumour are destroyed (drug D) and the influence of the VEGF is reduced\n(drug B);\n3. When the blood vessels as well as the angiogenic tips around the tumour are destroyed (drugs D and C) in parallel\nto reduced influence of the VEGF stimulant (drug B).\nCombinations of antiVEGF and antivascular therapy are effective if the potency of the drugs is large. The tumour\u2019s\ngrowth rate following treatment with combinations of drugs B, C and\/or D differs from that when drug B is given\nin isolation and\/or when drugs C and D are administrated. As Fig. 7(b) shows, the presence of an antiVEGF drug in\ncombination with antivascular drugs C or D, slows down tumour growth. We undertake parameter sensitivity analysis\nand we calculate the increase in tumour growth under different combinations of drugs B, C and D. Our results predict\nthat the increase in tumour mass (\n\u222b\nn2(x, t)dx) is slowest when drugs B, C and D are combined. In contrast when\ndrugs C and D only are combined the growth retardation is least i.e. this combination of antiVEGF and antivascular\ndrugs is least effective. We label with g(\u2126) = [\u222b n2(x, t)dx]\u2126 the increase in the tumour mass under the influence of\nthe therapy \u21261 as plotted in Fig. 7(a) and (b). The results from Fig. 7(a) and (b) can be summarized as follows:\ng(\u21260) < g(B) < g(D) < g(C) < g(\u2126\u221e) (17)\ng(\u21260) < g(BCD) < g(BC) < g(BD) < g(CD) < g(\u2126\u221e). (18)\nTherefore we predict that a combination of antiVEGF and antivascular drugs that destroy all the vasculature is\nmost effective in reducing the increase in tumour mass. In comparison to when only antivascular therapy (combined\ndrugs C and D) is effective, combined antiVEGF and antivascular therapy dramatically reduces tumour growth (see\nFig. 7(b)) to that of avascular tumour in absence of therapy. We also remark that when drug B is combined with drugs\nC and\/or D the increase in the tumour mass is slower than under isolated therapy with drugs B, C or D (comparing\nFig. 7(a) and (b)).\n8. Combined antiproliferative, antiVEGF and antivascular therapy (drug A and drugs B, C and\/or D)\nThus far we have studied the response of a vascular tumour to continuous infusion with antiproliferative, antiVEGF,\nantivascular drugs or a combination of antiVEGF and antivascular drugs. In this section we use the Eqs. (7)\u2013(16) to\nstudy the effect of a chemotherapy that simultaneously targets the proliferating cells, reduces the VEGF influence and\ndestroys the tumour vasculature during vascular tumour growth. We assume that drugs A, B, C and D are delivered\nto the vascular tumour and vary their respective potency on the normal and tumour cells, VEGF and the vasculature\n1 We note that g(\u21260) represents the increase in tumour mass during avascular growth and no therapy and g(\u2126\u221e) represents the increase in\ntumour mass during vascular growth and no therapy.\n576 J.

We use the results from Sections 4\u2013\n6 to fix these parameters at values which, when each drug is given in isolation, correspond to effective treatment\nand investigate how the overall tumour growth dynamics change when different combinations of the therapies are\nadministrated.\nOur numerical simulations suggest that two qualitative outcomes are possible. In one case tumour invasion of\nthe host cells is controlled: the tumour is either cleared or becomes growth-arrested; in the other case, the tumour\nvasculature is destroyed and the tumour becomes avascular. The former case is the same as that for effective treatment\nwith drug A only, whilst the latter is the same as that for effective antiVEGF therapy (drug B), effective antivascular\ntherapy (combined drugs C and D) or effective combinations of drugs B, C and D.\nWe predict that combined therapy prevents tumour invasion, leading to tumour arrested growth or tumour clearance,\nonly when one of the drugs in the cocktail kills proliferating cells i.e. is drug A. If a combination of the drugs B, C\nand D is applied, tumour growth is slowed (see Fig. 7(b)) but invasion persists. In Table 3 we summarize the different\nresponses that can be achieved when different combinations of the drugs are administrated.\nWe recall that the aim of an ideal treatment is to clear all tumour cells whilst inflicting no damage on the normal\ncells. Our results in Table 3 suggests that the tumour is cleared under the influence of a treatment with drug A only or a\ncombination of drug A with drugs B, C or D. The time when the tumour is removed depends on the parameter\u22062 that\ncontrols the potency of the drug A on the tumour cells. In order to compare how quickly the tumour is removed under\ndifferent therapy scenarios, in Fig. 8(a) and (b) we plot the clearance time T upon application of different therapies \u2126\nas T (\u2126)2 with the change in \u22062. We summarize our results as follows:\nT (AB) < T (A) < T (AC) < T (AD), (19)\nT (ABC) < T (AB) < T (A) < T (AC) < T (ABD) < T (ACD) < T (ABCD) < T (AD). (20)\nOur results predict that when applying a double therapy the tumour is removed quickest with a treatment that kills\ntumour proliferating cells (drug A) and reduces the influence of the VEGF in the region (drug B). The clearance of\nthe tumour is slowest when the therapy targets the proliferating cells (drug A) and kills the blood vessels (drug D).\nUpon application of combined triple and quadruple therapies the therapy removes the tumour in shortest time when\nthe combined therapy reduces VEGF influence (drug B) and kills the angiogenic capillaries (drug C) in parallel with\ntargeting proliferating cells (drug A). The tumour will take longest to be removed under a combined therapy that\ndestroys the blood vessels (drug D) in combination with killing proliferating cells (drug A).\nFollowing different therapies with isolated or combined drugs A, B, C and D, some damage can be sustained by the\nnormal cells. In our numerical simulations this is represented by a decrease in the overall density of the normal tissue\nand is evident only when drug D is administered in isolation or combined with drugs A, B and C. This is expected\nsince upon delivery of the drug D the mature vasculature is destroyed resulting in absence of oxygen delivery to the\nhealthy tissue. As a consequence the region becomes hypoxic and whilst tumour cells may survive healthy tissue is not\nviable. Therefore our results predict potential strongly deleterious effects on the healthy cells following a successful\ntherapy that includes drug D.\n2 As in Section 7 \u2126 represents different therapies with drugs A, B, C and\/or D.\nJ.

(a) Numerically calculated time when the tumour is removed TR as a result of combining drug A which kills proliferating cells with drugs\nB, C and D which destroy the VEGF or the tumour vasculature. To calculate this time we solve (7)\u2013(16) for different values of\u22062 with the rest of\nthe parameters as per Fig. 1 with c1 = 10, c2 = 5,\u22061 = 2, \u03b22 = 1. Our results suggest that the tumour is removed quicker when the potency effect\nof the antiproliferative drug (measured by \u22062) is larger. A combination of drug A with drug B removes the tumour quickest. (b) The numerically\ncalculated time when the tumour is removed as a result of application of different triple or quadruple therapies by delivery of combinations of drug\nA with drugs B, C and\/or D.\nWhen we exclude administration of drug D, the most effective treatment that removes the tumour (see Fig. 8(a)\nand (b)) is a combination of drugs A, B and C which for given drug potency clears the tumour at shortest time. In\ncontrast the most effective treatment that controls vascular tumour growth is combination of drugs B and C, upon\nwhich application the increase in tumour mass is least (see Fig. 7(a) and (b)).\n9. Discussion\nIn this paper we extended a model formulated in [28] to investigate the response of a vascular tumour to treatment\nwith different anticancer drugs. Our results suggest that the tumour\u2019s response to a therapy that kills proliferating\ntumour cells (drug A) depends on its potency and rate of uptake by the tumour cells. In particular, at long time the\nvascular tumour will either be cleared, become growth-arrested or will grow at a reduced rate, depending on the values\nof the relevant model parameters (see Fig. 3(a)\u2013(c)).\nWhen VEGF or the tumour vasculature are targeted by drugs of type B or C or D, tumour elimination can not occur.\nInstead, at best vascular growth is retarded (see Fig. 7(a) and (b)). Upon application of combined antivascular therapy\nthe results are qualitatively the same as if isolated antiVEGF or antivascular therapy were effective: the tumour reverts\nto avascular growth but cannot be eliminated. Combining anti-proliferative therapy with antiVEGF or antivascular\ntherapy can eliminate a vascular tumour in our simulations. For different combinations of the drugs of type A with\ndrugs B, C and\/or D the time of tumour removal depends on the potency of the drug that kills the proliferating tumour\ncells (see Fig. 8(a) and (b)).\nThe results in this paper are of clinical relevance. What we suggest via our modelling is different from the\nconventionally used treatment methods where one therapy is applied followed by another therapy after some time\ninterval. Our combination therapy includes simultaneous application of a cocktail of drugs targeting different aspects\nof tumour growth at the same time. We predict that a cocktail of drugs that kill the proliferating tumour cells, reduce\nthe VEGF and destroy the angiogenic capillaries will remove the tumour in shortest time whilst inflicting no damage\non the healthy tissue, whilst a combination of only antivascular and antiVEGF drugs can, at best, reduce the vascular\ntumour\u2019s growth rate to that of its avascular counterpart.\nCombination therapy is currently used in controlling the growth and spread of the HIV virus and the development\nof AIDS [54]. This motivated us to explore whether combination anticancer therapy will be more effective then single\nanticancer therapy. Recently combination therapies have been suggested for use in treating breast cancer [39,42].\n578 J. Panovska et al. \/ Mathematical and Computer Modelling 47 (2008) 560\u2013579\nUsing a virtual cancer patient engine Agur et al. [39] studied short- and long-term cellular dynamics of specific patients\nundergoing drug therapy with only doxorubicin or a doxorubicin combined treatments. Their results for the therapy\noutcomes for individual patients agree with in vitro response to doxorubicin protocols, and offer per-case choice of\ndrug, drug combination and schedules to achieve desired clinical end points [39]. Fister and Panetta [43] reviews the\nuse of mathematical models to study breast cancer chemotherapy and illustrates the relationship between different\ntherapies and the initiation time of metastatic growth, predicting the effect of the therapy on the metastatic growth\nand suggests the optimal chemotherapy administration. With our model, we have used a much simpler mathematical\nframework than that in [39,43] and studied continuous infusion of the combined drugs making theoretical predictions.\nQuestions remain whether the suggested therapies are feasible and whether the associated side effects can be tolerated.\nA weakness of our modelling framework which underplays the efficacy of some of the treatments studied is its\ninability to give rise to an avascular steady state solution. The modelling framework developed here can be extended\nto include necrotic material production by the hypoxic cells and its degradation, which would give rise to avascular\ntumour arrested growth. The model developed here also leads naturally to several possibilities for further investigation.\nFor example, our model can be extended to study more sophisticated treatment strategies such as two-step targeting of\nmulti-cell type tumours [52]. This would allow us to determine conditions for which one strategy is better than another.\nWe could also extend our work to account for treatment with drugs that target different phases of the cell cycle by\nextending the work of Pettet et al. [55]. However, for the purpose of this paper we have studied three different isolated\ntreatments for controlling vascular tumour growth, as well as their combination. We have proposed theoretical results\nof the effectiveness of such treatments which we hope will be tested clinically in future.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out whilst JP was a graduate student at the Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical\nInstitute, Oxford University and was funded by The Queen\u2019s College Studentship.
