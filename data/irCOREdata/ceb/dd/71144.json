K. Hargreaves\nDepartment of Communication Systems, University of Lancaster, Bailrigg, Lancaster LA1 4YR, UK\nReceived: 29 July 2003 \u2013 Revised: 29 July 2004 \u2013 Accepted: 3 Setember 2004 \u2013 Published: 28 February 2005\nAbstract. During polar-cap absorption events, which are\ncaused by the incidence of energetic solar protons, the high-\nlatitude ionospheric D region is extended down to relatively\nlow altitudes. While the incoming proton fluxes may be mon-\nitored by satellite-borne detectors, and the resulting radio-\nwave absorption with a ground-based riometer, the enhance-\nment of electron density at a given altitude is less easily de-\ntermined. Direct measurements by incoherent-scatter radar\nare infrequent and they tend to lack the necessary sensitiv-\nity at the lower levels. Computations of the electron density\nfrom the observed particle fluxes are handicapped by uncer-\ntainties in the height profile of the effective recombination\ncoefficient.\nThis paper describes a new approach based on finding the\nbest-fit solution to an over-determined set of equations. The\nD region is treated as a set of slabs, each contributing to the\ntotal radio absorption, and the method relies on the fact that\nthe proton spectrum varies during the event. The analysis\nproduces a set of coefficients relating the absorption incre-\nment in the slab to the square root of the production rate, as\na function of height. Values of effective recombination co-\nefficient are also deduced over a range of heights, and these\nagree with previous estimates (Gledhill, 1986) to within a\nfactor of 2. However, whereas the latter do not generally go\nbelow 60 km altitude the new determination extends the val-\nues down to 40 km.\nThe new method provides a measurement of the height\nprofile of the absorption in PCA events. It is shown that the\nslabs centred from 45 to 65 km typically account for 80% of\nthe total daytime absorption, and that less than 1% of the to-\ntal arises above 80 km or below 30 km. At night most of the\nabsorption comes from the slabs at 75 and 80 km, with no\nsignificant contribution from slabs below 75 or above 85 km.\nThese results would not differ significantly from estimates\nbased on the Gledhill profiles if extrapolated downward.\nCorrespondence to: J. K. Hargreaves\n(j.hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\nPredictions based on the coefficients generated by the pro-\ncedure are compared with the polar-cap absorption observed\nduring some recent events. Typical electron-density values\nare derived, and the study provides an independent confir-\nmation that the electron density and the production rate are\nrelated by a square-root law.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionospheric disturbances; particle\nprecipitation; polar ionosphere)\n1 Background\nPolar-cap absorption events (PCA), several good examples of\nwhich have occurred during the recent solar maximum, are\na direct consequence of energetic protons emitted from an\nactive region of the Sun. On penetrating into the terrestrial\natmosphere they enhance the ionization of the mesosphere,\nwhich in turn increases the absorption of radio waves in the\nHF and VHF bands (Bailey, 1959). The incidence and inten-\nsity of the event may conveniently be monitored in terms of\nthe radio absorption, using a riometer (Relative Ionospheric\nOpacity Meter \u2013 Little and Leinbach, 1959). The proton\nfluxes are also routinely monitored above the atmosphere us-\ning satellite-borne detectors. An important characteristic of\nsolar proton events is their relative uniformity over the polar\nregions down to a cut-off latitude at or near 60\u25e6 geomag-\nnetic latitude (Reid, 1974). The enhancement of electron\ndensity may in principle be measured as a function of height\nby incoherent-scatter radar.\nAt a given altitude the rate of ion production, which de-\npends on the energy deposited at that level, is determined by\nthe energy spectrum of the proton flux and may be computed\nfrom it using an atmospheric model. The ion production rate\n(q, in cm\u22123.s\u22121) and the equilibrium electron density (Ne, in\ncm\u22123) at a given height are related by the simple formula\nq = \u03b1e \u00b7 N2e , (1)\nwhere \u03b1e (in cm3.s\u22121) is by definition the effective recom-\nbination coefficient.

Hence, the total ab-\nsorption over a vertical path is\nA =\n\u222b\nNe(h).a(h).dh . (2)\nThe specific absorption depends on the effective collision\nfrequency (dominated by the electron-neutral collision fre-\nquency \u03bd) and the radio frequency (\u03c9) at which the absorp-\ntion is measured, in proportion to \u03bd\/(\u03bd2+\u03c92). Here, \u03c9 is\nthe angular frequency (=2pi f where f is in Hz). The specific\nabsorption may be calculated from an atmospheric model.\nThe values used were based on the curves given by Little et\nal. (1964). No account is taken of possible transitory varia-\ntions of \u201ca\u201d due, for instance, to frictional heating.

Direct measurements f the electron-density\nprofile by rocket or radar are only possible in some instances,\nand although the incoherent-scatter technique is an attractive\none for D-region studies in general, it tends to lack the sensi-\ntivity required for PCA studies. The problem may in princi-\nple also be solved by using pre-determined values of the ef-\nfective recombination coefficient. There have been many es-\ntimates of this coefficient, but since they vary greatly (Fig. 1)\nit is not obvious which values should be assumed.\nGledhill (1986) reviewed the literature on \u03b1e measure-\nments under various circumstances, and derived formulae for\nits variation with height over the range 50\u201390 km. The re-\nsults were given for different types of D-region disturbance,\nand the PCA results were divided into \u201cday\u201d and \u201cnight\u201d ac-\ncording to solar zenith angles less than 92\u25e6 and greater than\n98\u25e6, respectively. Recognising the large spread, it was stated\nJ. K. Hargreaves: Polar-cap absorption events 361\nFig. 4. Integral proton fluxes at energies exceeding 1, 5, 10, 30,\n50, 60, and 100 MeV during the event which started 14 July 2000,\nmeasured by GOES-10 at geosynchronous orbit.\nthat the results were \u201cnot reliable to a factor of 2, and in\nsome cases not even within an order of magnitude\u201d. This\nqualification succinctly summarises our problem.\nPatterson et al. (2001) used Gledhill\u2019s profiles of effective\nrecombination coefficient (day and night) to estimate the to-\ntal absorption from the observed proton spectrum in a num-\nber of events, and obtained reasonable agreement, at least for\nthe daytime. Figure 2 reproduces their comparison between\nobserved and predicted absorption; lines have been added to\nindicate differences of 20%.\n2 A new approach\nThe new approach is as follows. From Eqs. (1) and (2), we\ncan write,\nA =\n\u222b\nq1\/2.c.dh , (3)\nwhere\nc = a\/\u03b11\/2e . (4)\nGiven that A is in decibels (dB), h in km, and a and\n\u03b1e are in the units stated above, the unit of c will be\ndB.cm3\/2.s1\/2.km\u22121. The ionosphere is divided into 17 slabs\nof 5 km (Fig. 3). In each slab the incremental absorption is\nrelated to the square root of the production rate by the \u201ccom-\nbined coefficient\u201d, c (equal to the specific absorption divided\nby the square root of the effective recombination coefficient).\nThe production rates are computed from geosynchronous-\nsatellite measurements of the proton fluxes by the method of\nReid (Reid, 1986; Reid et al., 1991). The scheme of compu-\ntation is based on laboratory measurements of ionization by\nFig. 5. Ion production rates computed for heights from 20 to 90 km\nduring the proton event of July 2000. The curves are displayed in\ntwo panels for clarity.\nprotons in air. Power-law approximations are fitted in sec-\ntions to the observed fluxes exceeding 1, 5, 10, 30, 50 and\n100 MeV, and the energy deposition of individual protons is\nfollowed until the particle stops. At selected heights, in this\ncase every 5 km, the deposition is integrated over energy and\nincidence angle.\nThe values of \u201cc\u201d are varied until the difference between\nthe calculated and measured absorption is a minimum, the\ncriterion being the sum of the squares of the difference taken\nover many values during the PCA event. We wish to vary\nc(n) to minimise the quantity\u2211\n[(Acalc \u2212 Aobs)\/Aobs]2 , (5)\nwhere the summation is over time, and\nAcalc = 5\n\u2211\nq1\/2n .cn , (6)\nwhere this summation is over all the slabs, n=1 to 17.\nThe mathematical procedure, which is from the NAG\nFortran Library, is designed for the solution of an\n362 J.

Starting from initial guesses, the\nprogram works in (in our case) 17 dimensions and samples\nwith small steps, in order to determine in which direction\nthe minimum lies. A larger step is then taken and the pro-\ncess repeated until a minimum is found. The method relies\non the fact that the proton spectrum varies during the event,\nas a result of which the relative contribution by the various\nslabs changes with time. No solution would be possible if\nthe spectrum were constant.\nSome finesse is required in applying this method. The pro-\ncedure might find a local minimum which is not the best so-\nlution, and there might be mathematical solutions which are\nFig. 7. Comparison between observed and reconstructed absorption\nduring the event of July 2000.\nnot realistic physically. For instance, we know that \u201cc\u201d can-\nnot be negative and that it should vary smoothly from level\nto level. Thus, it was found useful to operate on different\nselections of data and to begin the iteration from different\nstarting points. Moreover, because there will always be noise\nin the data we cannot expect a perfect solution. We are\nlooking for the best answer that does not contradict existing\nknowledge and that tends to emerge with some consistency\nover a number of tests.\n3 Daytime results\nDaytime data are taken from the PCA event of July 2000.\nThe integral proton fluxes above 7 threshold energies (Fig. 4)\nwere measured on a geosynchronous GOES satellite, and\nproduction rates from 10 to 90 km were computed from them\n(Fig. 5). The radio absorption was measured throughout\nthe event with the 38.2-MHz imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(Finland), geographic coordinates 69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E, L-\nvalue 5.9, (Browne et al., 1995; Hargreaves and Detrick,\n2002), taking the average absorption over the central five\nbeams. This event exceeded 10 dB at its maximum. To main-\ntain accuracy, only values of at least 0.5 dB were used in de-\ntermining combined coefficients.\nFigure 6a shows the values of c determined using different\ndata selections, and also the results of initial tests run using\n8 slabs (of 10 km, centred 15\u201385 km height). In Fig. 6b, the\ncentral values, so determined, have been fixed in the hope of\nobtaining better precision at the upper and lower extremes.\nThe medians from Fig. 6b have been taken as the working\nvalues of c for this event, and to represent daytime condi-\ntions.\nIn Fig. 7 the absorption pattern reconstructed using these\ncoefficients is compared with the observed absorption. The\nratio of observed\/calculated absorption (Fig. 8a) has a me-\ndian value of 1.0 (horizontal line), and half of the values\nare within 10% of the median. The measure of agreement\nJ. K.

We therefore have an independent experimen-\ntal confirmation of the square root law.\nIn order to test the more general validity of the coeffi-\ncients, computations and comparisons have been made for\nthe events of 2 April, 24 September and 23 November 2001\n(Fig. 9).

Gener-\nally, above 70 km and below 40 km the contribution to the\nabsorption (per km) is less than 10% of that at 60 km. The\nslabs centred from 45 to 65 km account for 80% of the total\nabsorption. Less that 1% of the total absorption arises below\n30 km or above 80 km.\nFrom the definition of the \u201ccombined coefficient\u201d, c, and\nsince we know the \u201cspecific absorption\u201d, a, as a function of\naltitude, we may compute values of the \u201ceffective recombi-\nnation coefficient\u201d. The most accurate values will be those\nfor the slabs that make the largest contribution to the to-\ntal absorption, i.e. from 45 to 65 km. Figure 11 compares\nthose values (extended by one slab at each end) with Gled-\nhill\u2019s (1986) daytime profile of this quantity. Our values are\nlarger by a factor of 1.5 to 2. Recall that the Gledhill values\nwere obtained by reviewing the existing literature, in which\nthe values show a large spread. It is interesting that the plots\nof Fig. 11 show similar gradients over their common height\nrange. The new determination is entirely independent of pre-\nvious estimates and, moreover, it extends down to altitudes\nfor which other data are sparse.\nSpecimen values of the electron density during PCA\nevents may also be estimated from Eqs. 1, 2 and 4. Ta-\nble 1 gives such values for the height range 40\u201370 km, for\ntimes near the daytime maxima of the events of July 2000\nand September 2001. These values are consistent with di-\nrect measurements (by incoherent-scatter radar \u2013 Fig. 1b) at\nthe higher altitudes. However, no comparable radar data are\nbelieved to exist for the lower levels.\nTable 1 also gives the values of combined coefficient, spe-\ncific absorption coefficient, and effective recombination co-\nefficient, all for daytime conditions as derived from the event\nof July 2000.\n5 Night-time results\nWe expect the results to be rather different for the night pe-\nriods, when free electrons are removed at the lower altitudes\nby attachment to neutral species. Night periods were se-\nlected from the events of 23 November 2001 and 24 Septem-\nber 2001, the criterion for \u201cnight\u201d being that the Sun was\nmore than 10\u25e6 below the horizon, this being the depression\nangle for which riometers generally indicate that the transi-\ntion to night-time absorption levels is complete. Data from\n2 April were not included because the absorption values fell\nbelow 0.5 dB. To obtain the greatest range of the proton spec-\ntrum, we wish to include observations early and late in the\nevent. The first phase, however, tends to be of short duration,\nwhereas the last will be more subject to auroral contamina-\ntion. This is a greater problem by night than by day because\nthe component of absorption due to the protons is relatively\nsmaller by night for a given proton flux.\nIt was indeed found that the consistency of results from\ndifferent runs of the procedure was poorer by night than had\nbeen the case by day. Taking what is considered to be \u201ca\ngood estimate\u201d, Fig. 12 shows the reconstruction of night\nperiods for the events of April, September and November,\ncompared with the observations. The November event is\nreproduced quite well, as is the September event except for\nthe dip immediately after sunset. The sharp enhancement\nJ. K.

The shape of the variation by night\nis poorly reproduced in the April event, though the absolute\ndifference is no more than 0.3 dB.\nThe values of c obtained from various runs for the night\nperiods are shown in Table 2a. The residual r.m.s. error varies\nonly slightly between these cases, being close to 23.5%, yet\nthe \u201cc\u201d values which the procedure deems to give the best fit\nvary widely. Evidently, the result is very sensitive to small\nvariations in the data. On the other hand, this also means that\nthere are several sets of \u201cc\u201d which will predict the absorp-\ntion from the proton flux equally well, presumably because\nvariations in the production rate are well correlated over the\neffective height range. Note that c=0 below 70 km in every\nrun, which accords with the well established view that the ef-\nfective recombination coefficient increases sharply at sunset\nat the lower altitudes. The present result says that at night\nthe radio absorption cuts off sharply below the 70 km slab\nand that any absorption contributions lower down are negli-\ngible in relation to the total. There is experimental evidence\nfor a sharp increase in the ratio of negative ions to electrons\nbelow 75 km (Hall et al., 1988).\nThe first row of Table 2b is an average of the values in\nTable 2a, adjusted to smooth the transition between 75 and\n85 km.

Note\nthat the change in the residual error is very slight during this\nrun.\nAs a further test (Table 2c), the values of c obtained above\nwere taken as the starting guess and only 2 levels (75 and\n80 km) were allowed to generate non-zero values of c. This\nwas repeated, allowing contributions from only 4 levels (70\nto 85 km). Table 2c gives the result at 2 stages of this second\nrun. Note that the value of c at 70 km generated in this run\nis either very small or zero. It was shown above that at night\nthere are no significant contributions to the absorption from\nbelow 70 km. We can now add that when contributions are\nrestricted to the slabs from 70 to 90 km, there are virtually\nno contributions from 70 or 90 km either. The night-time\nabsorption is effectively confined to the three slabs centred\nfrom 75 to 85 km. Note that the r.m.s. residual is virtually\nconstant in all the results shown here. Any of these sets of\ncoefficients will give virtually the same accuracy of PCA pre-\ndiction (i.e. 23\u201324%).\n6 Inferences for the night period\nTable 3 gives the incremental absorption and the distribution\nof absorption with height for selected points (all at night) dur-\ning the November and September events. The points labelled\nNovember: points 60, 200, 340 and 520; and September:\npoints 300, 520, 560 and 830, are, respectively, at 23 Novem-\nber, 05:00 UT and 16:40 UT, 24 November, 04:20 UT and\n19:20 UT, 25 September 01:00 UT, 18:20 UT and 22:40 UT,\nand 26 September, 21:10 UT. The c values used are the fi-\nnal values from Table 2b, and from Table 2c, respectively.\nClearly, the major part of the night-time absorption during\nthese PCAs comes from the 75 and 80 km slabs, the former\nproducing 60\u201370% of the total absorption, and the latter 25\u2013\n30%. The contribution of the 85-km slab is a minor one at\n368 J. K. Hargreaves: Polar-cap absorption events\n4\u201310% (typically in the late and early phases of the event\nrespectively).\nWhen it comes to estimating the effective recombination\ncoefficients, we should, as for the daytime, only use values\nfrom slabs that make a major contribution to the total ab-\nsorption. For night, this restricts us to 75 and 80 km. Most of\nthe values of c for 75 and 80 km are in the range 2.91.10\u22123\nto 4.33.10\u22123 and 1.66.10\u22123 to 2.20.10\u22123, respectively. Fol-\nlowing the method of Sect. 4, these lead to values of effec-\ntive recombination coefficient of 8.3.10\u22127 to 3.7.10\u22127 and\n5.2.10\u22127 to 3.0.10\u22127. These values are smaller than those\nfrom the Gledhill (1986) formula for night (1.56.10\u22125 and\n4.83.10\u22126), and are close to the \u201clower limiting values\u201d in\nFig. 1 though still within the range shown there.\nThe values of electron density at 75 and 80 km correspond-\ning to the 8 samples detailed in Table 3 are given in Table 4.\nWe note that at these heights the electron density values are\nsimilar to each other, being about 4 to 5 times 104 if the to-\ntal absorption is 1 dB, with approximate proportionality be-\ntween electron density and absorption.\n7 Conclusions and discussion\nThe method outlined in the paper uses the variations of calcu-\nlated ion production rate as a function of height in compari-\nson with the total radio absorption measured with a riometer,\nto estimate the magnitude of the absorption contribution as\na function of height. It has been applied to recent polar-cap\nabsorption events, and to day and night periods separately.\nWorking with 5-km slabs it was found that most of the\nabsorption occurs in the slabs centred from 45 to 65 km by\nday (80%), and at 75 to 80 km by night. By day, typically,\nless than 1% of the absorption arises above 80 km or below\n30 km. At night there is no significant contribution to the\nabsorption below the 75-km slab or at 90 km.\nThe observed linearity between the observed and com-\nputed values of total absorption provides an experimental\nconfirmation of the square-law relationship between produc-\ntion rate and electron density (Eq. 1).\nThe method does not require values of the effective re-\ncombination coefficient to be assumed, but estimates of this\nquantity may be obtained from the results. The daytime val-\nues so deduced are comparable with the values recommended\nin Gledhill\u2019s (1986) literature review, though they also ex-\ntend the range down to 40 km. Night values are considerably\nsmaller than Gledhill\u2019s at 75 and 80 km. Electron density val-\nues may also be deduced for the heights contributing the most\nabsorption, and these are generally comparable with results\nfrom the limited incoherent-scatter radar data available. Val-\nues derived in this manner may be useful estimates at times\nwhen direct measurements are not available.\nThis analysis assumes that the values of the \u201ccombined\ncoefficient\u201d, c, are constant at a given height. In fact, there\nis some evidence from radar data that the effective recom-\nbination coefficient may vary slowly with time (Reagan and\nWatt, 1976; Hargreaves et al., 1993), and such a variation\nwould plainly reduce the accuracy of the prediction. Further,\nno seasonal variations have been taken into account in the\npresent study. The method takes no account of any varia-\ntions in the specific absorption coefficient (Eq. 2), nor of au-\nroral electrons which are most likely to arrive after the first\nday of the proton event and have most effect at the higher al-\ntitudes, therefore making their greatest relative contribution\nat night. These caveats considered, the overall accuracy of\n20\u201325% which the method achieves appears reasonable and\nworthwhile.\nAcknowledgements. I thank H. H.
