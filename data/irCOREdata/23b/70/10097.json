The aim is to provide a service that is easy to access\nand confidential, allowing the client space to think with a professional.\nThis paper gives an overview of the YPCS, including describing the history of\nthe service, with an outline of the YPCS model and a case vignette to exemplify\nthe therapeutic process. The relevant literature on very brief psychotherapy is\nexplored: although the consultation model of the YPCS is not intended to be\npsychotherapy as such, this body of work provides the most relevant compari-\nson. The paper then proceeds to report on an analysis of outcome data. It was\nhypothesized that clients would show improvements on outcome measures\nafter four sessions. The evaluation of outcome will provide information about\nwhich clients seem to show the greatest benefit and enable the service and\nfunders to assess its effectiveness.\nHistory of the YPCS\nThe YPCS was set up in 1961 as a voluntary counselling service for any young\nperson without the need for a formal referral. The original staff were a\nmixture of psychoanalytically-oriented social workers and psychologists. The\naim of the formative service was to offer an intervention for people whose\nproblems were seen as part of the \u2018normal\u2019 maturational process rather than\n\u2018pathological\u2019.\nThe founders\u2019 hope was to offer a service that was:\nindependent of the adolescent\u2019s world of authority, to which young people may\ncome and discuss their immediate problems without any need for a deep or\npermanent relationship being created . . . The adolescents, by discussion with well-\ntrained advisers, can work out their own problems and attain insight into them so\nthat they may return to their milieu and make growth and progress. (Lyon, 2004,\np. 30)\nThe service was set up to be brief, targeting a particular young client group who\nmay be \u2018cautious and . . . curious, cautious about commitment but curious about\nthemselves\u2019 (Dartington, 1995, p. 253).\nThe age range of 16 to 30 covers the extended transition phase between\nadolescence to establishing oneself as an adult.This period involves negotiating\nseveral milestones, including moving from school to university or the work-\nplace, leaving home to become an independent adult, developing adult sexual\nrelationships, and establishing one\u2019s adult identity. The self-referral nature of\nthe service inherently excluded under-16s as it was a legal requirement for\nparental consent below that age.1\nIn the UK, there is an increasing recognition of the importance of providing\nmental health services that cover this transition from adolescence to adult-\nhood (e.g. Lamb et al., 2008). The adolescent phase does not suddenly end\nwhen the young person turns 18 and there is evidence that the brain continues\nto develop into the early 20s (Dahl, 2004). Thus the YPCS was perhaps ahead\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 57\nof its time in offering a service that crosses the traditional age boundaries\nbetween child and adolescent and adult mental health services.\nThe problems that clients present with are usually those of everyday life. The\naim from the outset was for young people to be seen quickly during a time of\ncrisis or change, to strengthen their own resources and avoid acting out through\nunconscious impulses. The service thus provides \u2018an important preventive\nmental health function\u2019 (Dartington, 1995, p. 260).\nThe informal nature of the service was unique at the time of the service\u2019s\ninception and was maintained when it became part of the NHS in 1967 under\nthe auspices of the Tavistock Clinic in North London, where it remains within\nthe Adolescent Department.\nIn terms of reviewing outcomes and related services, the literature on very\nbrief psychotherapy provides the most relevant comparison. This body of work\nis reviewed below as well as pertinent material on psychodynamic counselling.\nThis is followed by detail of the YPCS model and a case vignette to illustrate the\nintervention.\nVery Brief Psychotherapy\nThe concept of very brief psychodynamic psychotherapy may initially seem\nparadoxical. However, Freud himself practised psychoanalysis within a shorter\ntime-scale than modern standards: six months was considered long. He experi-\nmented with setting a definite ending date from early on in therapy. Similarly,\nother influential analysts, such as Jung, Klein and Winnicott all saw patients for\nshort periods. Other early analysts, including Ferenczi and Rank, advocated\ntime-limited treatments, focusing on the \u2018here-and-now\u2019. Although brief psy-\nchotherapy was not originally a different entity, it began to develop as such\nthrough the work of Malan and Balint in the 1950s. Malan studied waiting lists\nfor psychotherapy and observed that people who had been assessed but not\nbeen taken on showed real improvements (Malan et al., 1975). He concluded\nthat the assessment itself had been a significant encounter which helped the\nclient to reframe their difficulties, strengthen their self-understanding and facili-\ntated their seeing a way forward.\nIn spite of the variety of theoretical models that have evolved from this work,\nthere are some general agreements among brief psychotherapy theorists and\nclinicians about key elements for success. Firstly, the client should have a high\nmotivation for change. Secondly, there should be a circumscribed problem and\na clear focus: this should be promptly formulated by the psychotherapist in\norder to maximize the use of the limited time. Coren (1996) argues that the\ncentral focus must encompass the \u2018triangle of insight\u2019 (Flegenheimer, 1982), that\nis, linking between the current life circumstances, past history and what happens\nin the room. Thirdly, the ending is thought about from the start. This is consid-\nered to concentrate the minds of both client and therapist, intensifies emotions\nand allows a working through of former losses. \u2018Working with the end from the\nbeginning enables core attachment issues to be addressed\u2019 (Lee, 2004, p. 5).\nFacilitating good endings is particularly important when working with young\npeople as this phase of development is characterised by losses in the form of\n58 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nending of the childhood relationship with parents, leaving the family home and\nprogression to adult roles in life.\nIn their seminal paper, Howard et al. (1986) challenged the previous notion\nthat it was the quantity of treatment that was associated with therapeutic\nbenefit. Much psychotherapy research focuses on length of therapy as the\ncrucial variable, with many studies showing a positive association between the\namount of treatment and outcome. But what is the active ingredient? While this\nis often taken as length of therapy or number of sessions, Howard compares this\nto an analogy of weight in different medicines, that is, they are not necessarily\nequivalent. Howard et al. (1986) conducted a meta-analysis on length of psy-\nchotherapy and examined whether there is a dose\u2013response relationship:2 that\nis, whether increased amounts of psychotherapy are associated with change.\nThey found that there was an acceleration of improvement early on in therapy:\nover two thirds of the therapeutic benefit is seen in the first 25 sessions. Many\nshowed improvements even sooner. Between 29\u201338% of patients studied\nimproved within the first three sessions, regardless of how long therapy was. For\nthose whose treatment lasted 4\u20137 sessions, 38% improved between sessions 1\u20133\nand 58% improved by sessions 4\u20137.3 These figures would be considered remark-\nable for many modern medicines,4 i.e. for over half of patients to improve in\nonly 1\u20132 months. However, it is of note that this meta-analysis includes studies\nusing various models of psychotherapy, mainly interpersonal and psychody-\nnamic,5 in a variety of settings, from private practice to university counselling\ncentres; and, importantly, using a range of outcome measures, including both\ntherapist and client self-ratings. This heterogeneity makes comparison between\nstudies complex.\nBarkham et al. (1999) explored the dose\u2013response effect further with a\nstudy of the \u2018Two-Plus-One\u20196 psychotherapy model. They argued that Howard\u2019s\nwork was flawed in that it did not examine time-limited psychotherapy:\nfor example, clients may have shown a rapid improvement safe in the knowl-\nedge of an agreement for further sessions. Barkham and colleagues found\nthat clients showed a significant improvement at the end of the three-session\npsychotherapy.\nAveline (2001) reported on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a \u2018Three-\nplus-one\u2019 model,7 comparing this very brief psychodynamic intervention with\ntheir standard four-session assessment for psychotherapy. They found that\npatients preferred this intervention over the usual assessment and it was asso-\nciated with significant cost savings. As a result, they have adopted this model as\ntheir standard assessment process.\nThere is a relevant literature on student counselling (e.g. Coren, 1996, 1999).\nMany such services operate within a psychodynamically-oriented framework\nsimilar to the YPCS model described here, typically offering between four to\nsix sessions. Coren (1996) argues that such consultations should not simply be\nseen as second best to longer-term psychotherapy, and that they can be attrac-\ntive to young people because of the inherent therapeutic hope and lack of\nprocrastination and pathologizing. Such work with adolescents and young\nadults has the benefit of allowing the young person to continue with normal\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 59\ndevelopmental tasks and to get on with the business of life outside the con-\nsultation room.\nVery brief psychotherapy requires particular skill on the part of the therapist.\nWhile the time-limited nature means that time is precious, this should not be a\nreason to rush. Pacing of the therapy is thus a crucial part of the psychothera-\npist\u2019s role. Excessive use of interpretations may be overwhelming for the client.\nThere is less margin for error or possibility for repair in the case of a misinter-\npretation. Many would argue that the use of reflections to test out hypotheses,\non the other hand, is appropriate: \u2018To do this well requires knowledge, skill and\nsensitivity\u2019 (Aveline, 2001, p. 373).\nGiven the limited time, the rapport and trust between therapist and client\nneed to be swiftly established. It may be that the crucial variable in brief\npsychotherapy is this therapeutic relationship. Holmes (1994) argues that it is\nquality rather than quantity that is essential for secure attachments and this\nanalogy may be logically extended to psychotherapy. It has been argued that\n\u2018positive therapeutic alliance\u2019 is a good predictor of positive outcome in\ntherapy (e.g. Orlinsky & Howard, 1986). Other models of psychotherapy, such\nas cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), initially ignored this aspect, but have\nincreasingly come to acknowledge the value of the therapeutic relationship.\nFor the therapist, very brief psychotherapy poses special challenges. While\nthis form of therapy is inherently short, it need not be superficial. Indeed, these\nvery brief encounters can be particularly intense. Endings can be difficult for the\ntherapist and may be experienced as a loss, which can be difficult for those\nclinicians who specialize in this field (Lee, 2004). This requires careful and\nskilled supervision. On the other hand, the psychotherapist benefits from the\nrichness of sharing these intense experiences with more clients and there is\ngreater opportunity for \u2018learning from the patient\u2019 (Casement, 1985). The work\ncan be especially satisfying when tangible improvements can be simultaneously\nwitnessed by both client and therapist.\nThe YPCS Model and Therapeutic Process\nThe YPCS may best be seen as a consultation model of very brief psychotherapy.\nIt offers a consultation to the young person rather than psychotherapy as such.\nNevertheless, the intention is to offer an intervention that is therapeutic. The\nconsultation aims to engage young people by offering an easy to access space\nto think about their difficulties, through its self-referral and brief nature, with\nshort waiting times. The intervention is referred to as either a \u2018consultation\u2019 or\n\u2018psychotherapy\u2019 for the purposes of brevity in this paper.\nThe YPCS is limited to four sessions of 50 minutes each.8 This may be the\nperson\u2019s first and only experience of a psychological intervention, or it may act\nas a taster for longer-term therapy. The four-session contract is clearly defined\nto clients at the outset and this is felt to have a containing function. The four\nsession dates are given at the start of the consultation and reminders are not\nusually sent in the case of a client missing a session. This is to promote the\nclient taking responsibility for the psychotherapy and to prevent a sense of\npersecution.\n60 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nThe focus tends to be on the client\u2019s current situation, allowing space for\nself-exploration and promoting growth, without encouraging dependency. The\nclient is able to start to make use of careful interpretations offered by the\npsychotherapist. Indeed, the brief nature of the service requires special skills on\nthe part of the psychotherapist as it is key to move at the client\u2019s pace. The\ntherapist may become aware of emotions that remain subconscious for the\nclient, and it may not be appropriate in this setting to delve further into this: this\nrequires skilled clinical judgement.\nAt the end of the four sessions, some clients feel they would like to continue\nwith longer-term psychotherapy. While this is something that may be thought\nabout in the final session, it is considered important to see this as a brief\ntherapeutic process in its own right and to encourage the client to make use of\nthis space. Young people may be given information about appropriate services\nalthough formal referrals are not routinely made. Some clients progress to be\nseen for longer-term psychotherapy in the Adolescent or Adult Departments at\nthe Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust (TPNHSFT). Others may\ndecide they do not want further psychotherapy, while in some cases it may be\nconsidered by the therapist that this may not be the right time to go on for\nlonger-term psychotherapy. Indeed, some people may not complete the four\nsessions for various reasons.\nClients can attend for a second intervention within the YPCS at a later stage\nshould they wish. In fact, four clients in the time period studied had had two\nseparate interventions in the YPCS. Whatever the outcome, it is hoped that the\nyoung person has gained something from the consultation that they will take\naway to assist them to continue on their life\u2019s journey.\nIt is often important to consider what makes a client choose such a time-\nlimited intervention. It may be lack of knowledge of the therapeutic world,\nshortage of time, a means of \u2018dipping their toes in the water\u2019 of their own psyche\nor an avoidance of or ambivalence about engaging in deeper therapeutic work.\nSome may simply not need longer-term therapy, in which case this consultation\nis a good fit. This question is often held in the psychotherapist\u2019s mind and can\nserve as a tool for understanding the client\u2019s position.\nThe service operates within a psychodynamic framework and the therapists\ncome from a variety of professional backgrounds including psychiatrists,\npsychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors.9 Some are employed by, or in\ntraining at, the TPNHSFT, while others may participate in the service on an\nhonorary basis as part of external training or to gain experience. Due to the\nlarge number of psychotherapists available, most clients can be offered an\nappointment within a week or two of their initial contact.\nEach psychotherapist is allocated to a weekly supervision group led by an\nexperienced clinician. Transference issues are thought about in supervision, but\ndirect transference interpretations are not usually made in the sessions. Coun-\ntertransference feelings, on the other hand, are often used indirectly to help\nidentify issues for that client. For example, the psychotherapist may draw on\ntheir own experience of their relationship with a client to facilitate that person\u2019s\nawareness of links and patterns in their past and present external relationships.\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 61\nReferral Procedure\nThe YPCS is a self-referral only service and young people can refer themselves\nby telephoning the department directly. When the client makes initial contact,\nthe service administrator carries out an initial screening process as to suitability\nfor the service. This includes taking brief details of the problem the person\nwants to discuss, as well as information regarding previous therapy, whether the\nperson is taking any medication or is known to other services.\nThe referral is passed on to the Chair of the service for approval.The majority\nof cases will be accepted at that stage and passed on to a psychotherapist who\nhas availability. Some cases will be considered unsuitable for this service, for\nexample, if they are too complex or too high risk, and can be referred on to\nsomewhere more appropriate.\nApart from this brief screening process, there is no assessment as such,\nlargely due to the aim of offering a brief and easy to access service. The\nself-referral nature can be difficult for clinicians used to working in more\nformal mental health services where professionals may be accustomed to\nhaving access to detailed information on clients. This lack of knowledge can\ncreate anxiety in the psychotherapist. However, this also allows for a more\nspontaneous approach during the initial encounter with the client, without\none\u2019s judgement being clouded by assumptions, and being able to experience\nfreely what it is like to be in the room with that person for the first time.\nIndeed, this can have a levelling effect between client and psychotherapist as\nthe young person will know nothing about the therapist except their name\n(Dartington, 1995).\nPresenting Problems\nCommon issues that people disclose at the initial contact are that they are\nfeeling depressed or anxious, have had a bereavement, are having family prob-\nlems or relationship difficulties or breakdown. Many are experiencing difficul-\nties associated with the transition from adolescence to adulthood, for example,\nproblems in studying, difficulties at work, leaving home and separation issues.\nFor these reasons, although most of the clients are young adults, it has been felt\nthat the service is best placed within the Adolescent Department.\nIt is commonly found that further issues are unravelled during subsequent\nsessions with the psychotherapist. It is understandable and appropriate that\npeople do not go into full details of their problem during the initial telephone\ncontact with the administrator. For example, a person who initially reports\nfamily problems may subsequently disclose a history of abuse. Should signifi-\ncant risk issues emerge during the consultation, the YPCS team have access to\npsychiatrists within the department, who can arrange to review the young\nperson. This has rarely been necessary but this availability has a containing\nfunction for the therapeutic process (Dartington, 1995).\nYPCS Case Vignette\nThe following vignette describes the consultation with one of the clients\nwho showed improvement from the data during the period under study. It\n62 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nexemplifies the usual YPCS process and key themes that emerge. Some details\nhave been altered to preserve anonymity.\nJosie was a 22 year-old young woman who contacted the YPCS, having read\nabout the service in a leaflet at her GP surgery. In the initial telephone contact\nshe said that she was feeling low in mood: she had been depressed in the past\nand had been prescribed medication but did not want to take this again. She also\nmentioned problems in her personal life which she thought started in childhood.\nShe had not previously tried counselling or psychotherapy. She was accepted into\nthe service and a psychotherapist was allocated to her case and she was given\nfour session dates, starting within three weeks of initial contact.\nIn the first session, Josie described to the psychotherapist how she had started\nfeeling depressed again, similarly to when she was 14. She spoke about how she had\nbeen travelling recently with her cousin to South America which she had really\nenjoyed, but was now back at university where she was studying law. She was\nfinding it hard to concentrate on her studies. She also spoke of her current boy-\nfriend of nearly a year, her ambivalence about this relationship and that she did not\nthink he was \u2018the one\u2019. She had become involved in a partying lifestyle in which her\nboyfriend was also involved, but wanted to stop this in order to be able to focus\nmore on her studies and career.\nIn the second session, she said that she had ended the relationship with her\nboyfriend the previous weekend. She felt upset and was not sure how she would\ncope over the next few weeks but thought this was the right decision. She then\nwent on to talk about how she felt close to her father but did not get on well\nwith her mother as she did not feel she understood her. [Was this a reference to\nwhether her female psychotherapist really understood her? Perhaps this reflected\nconcerns about becoming attached.] She then went on to talk about how she gets\nvery \u2018stressed\u2019 when she has a big decision to make. She spoke of how she ini-\ntially finds it hard to commit to relationships; how it had been so difficult to end\nthe relationship with her boyfriend and she worries about not meeting someone\nelse. [This may have been an expression of how hard it would be to end the\nrelationship with her therapist. She might also have been referring to her deci-\nsion to try this form of very brief psychotherapy and thoughts on whether she\nshould commit to longer-term therapy. She may have been indicating how diffi-\ncult it was to move from her childhood relationship with her father to having\nintimate relationships with men and whether she would find someone with whom\nshe shared the same closeness.]\nIn session three, she talked about having resumed her relationship with her\nboyfriend the previous weekend. However, they subsequently broke up again a\nfew days later. She spoke about her maternal grandmother\u2019s death when she was\n13, just before she had previously become depressed. She also talked about the\ndeath of a sister who died as a baby when Josie was 2. She did not really remem-\nber this but was aware of the impact it had had on her mother in particular. She\nbecame very tearful during this session. [The loss of her grandmother appeared\nto be a significant trigger for her previous episode of depression. The psycho-\ntherapist wondered how the tragic death of her baby sister had impacted on the\nfamily, and, in particular, Josie\u2019s mother. Did she subsequently become depressed\nherself? How had this affected Josie as a child and was this continuing to affect\nthe relationship between them her and her mother, and, in addition, Josie\u2019s\ncapacity to form intimate relationships?] The link between these former losses\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 63\nand the ending of her current relationship was put to Josie and she was able to\nacknowledge how she found ending this relationship difficult as it brought back\nthese painful feelings.\nIn the fourth and final session, Josie asked how the psychotherapist was. [Was\nthis an indication of her concern about how the therapist would feel after their\ntherapeutic relationship ended?] She went on to talk about missing her ex-\nboyfriend and her sadness about this. She brought photographs of her family to\nshow, including the baby sister who had died and her grandmother, which was\napparently very moving for Josie. At the end of the session, she gave the psycho-\ntherapist a thank-you card which she had made herself.\nThis vignette exemplifies some key themes of the YPCS work. As is often the\ncase, the initial contact gives only a clue as to the nature of the underlying issues,\nwhich swiftly emerge during the sessions.The preliminary description of feeling\nlow in mood expands to reveal problems around ending a relationship, with\nfurther layers of previous unresolved losses. It is of note that Josie decided to\nend the relationship with her boyfriend during these sessions. Was this merely a\ncoincidence? Perhaps the consultation provided her with a sufficiently safe\nplace and a sense of grounding that enabled her to make this decision, some-\nthing she acknowledged finding hard to do.\nIt may be useful to consider Josie\u2019s choice of this form of very brief\npsychotherapy. The ending is clear from the start and it is noteworthy that\nlosses emerged as such a core theme in this case. Given the very brief nature\nof the intervention, some of the thoughts and questions in the psychothera-\npist\u2019s mind are not directly shared with the client, but are used to focus on\nwhat may be core issues for that person. In the final session, Josie wanted to\nshare her life in a more concrete way by bringing in photographs of people\nwho were important to her, maybe as a way of saying how important the\ntherapist had been in their brief time together. She also demonstrated how\nshe had kept the psychotherapist in mind between sessions through having\nmade a card for her, perhaps wondering if the therapist would continue to\nkeep her in mind, and trying to ensure she did so by leaving her with this\nparting gift.\nThe consultation had a similarly powerful effect on the psychotherapist. She\nfelt quickly engaged with Josie and was stirred by the material that emerged.\nShe was particularly moved by the issues about death, with these losses pain-\nfully present as they worked together towards the ending.\nThis scenario typifies themes of transition that are common to the YPCS,\nlargely due to the age group of the clients. Josie was struggling with coming to\nterms with the ending of her childhood relationships with her parents, devel-\noping adult responsibilities through leaving her party lifestyle behind in order\nto focus on her career, and developing intimate adult relationships.\nThis case also illustrates the type of emotional problems that clients may\npresent with. The issues are not of the complexity that would meet the criteria\nfor adult mental health services, but the consultation is likely to have served an\nimportant function in preventing Josie from deteriorating into the depression\nthat she had experienced in her teenage years.\n64 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nEvaluation of the YPCS\nIn addition to case material showing an apparent benefit of the four-\nsession consultation model, this study examined outcome data in order to\nevaluate whether measurable improvements were seen at the end of the\npsychotherapy.\nMethod\nThis study involved a review by hand of the files of all clients who had attended\nthe service from January 2003 to April 2006 inclusive, to obtain demographic\ndata, sessions attended and presenting issue. These details were cross-\nreferenced with the computer records and the information was entered into a\ndatabase.\nOutcome Measures\nIn order to assess outcome, clients were given the Youth Self-Report form\n(YSR)10 (Achenbach, 1991) or the Young Adult Self Report form (YASR)\n(Achenbach, 1997)11 to complete prior to attending the consultation and at\nthe end of the four sessions.12 The young person rates themselves on various\naspects of emotional and behavioural functioning. This gives scores on various\nsubscales, including internalizing (Anxious\/Depressed, Withdrawn, Somatic\nProblems) and externalizing (Rule Breaking and Aggressive Behaviour) scales\nand a total problems score.13 The measures also provide an assessment of\nwhether people fall within the clinical range: that is, an indication of whether\ntheir difficulties are likely to cause significant impairment of their day-to-day\nfunctioning. YSR\/YASR scores at the start of psychotherapy are compared to\nthose at the end, both in terms of change in mean scores and whether the person\nhas moved from the clinical to the non-clinical range.14\nResults\nDuring the period from January 2003 to April 2006, a total of 236 clients\nattended the service.\nDemographics:\nAge\nFigure 1 shows the age distributions of patients attending the YPCS by age at\ninitial referral date. The age distribution shows a similar pattern between males\nand females, with a peak at ages 22\u201323 and 28\u201329. It is of note that these peaks\nappear to coincide with key stages of transition for young people, for example,\nas they are leaving university or approaching their next decade of life.\nGender\nFigure 2 shows the gender of clients attending the YPCS service during the\nperiod under study. 71 of the 236 clients (30.1%) were male while 165 (69.9%)\nwere female.\nAttendance\nTable 1 shows the number of sessions attended by clients: whether they\nattended all four sessions offered or less.This was further analysed according to\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 65\ngender. 106 people (44.9%) attended all four sessions offered. Males were\nmarginally more likely to attend all four sessions than females, with 34 out of 71\nmales (47.9%) attending all sessions offered compared to 72 out of 165 females\n(43.6%).\n302928272625242322212019181716\nAge At Referral Date\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nC\no\nu\nn\nt\nFemale\nMale\nGender\nFig. 1: Age of clients attending YPCS\nFemale\nMale\nGender\nFig. 2: Gender of clients attending YPCS\n66 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nAttendance and Pre-assessment Scores\nThe number of sessions attended was compared to YSR\/YASR scores before\nand at the end of the four sessions. This was to test the hypothesis that there\nmay have been some difference between those who attended more sessions\ncompared to those who did not. For example, they may have had more serious\nproblems and were therefore more in need of help. Alternatively, they may\nhave had less severe problems and been less chaotic.\nIt was found that those who attended all four sessions had significantly lower\nexternalization scores on the YSR\/YASR at the start of the psychotherapy (see\nTable 2), i.e. indicating fewer behavioural problems. The other pre- and post-\nscores did not show statistically significant differences.\nOutcome\nOut of 236 clients, 128 completed the YSR\/YASR forms at the beginning of\npsychotherapy and 41 at the end. Of these, 24 clients completed both the pre-\nand post-therapy forms.Thus pre- and post-psychotherapy comparison could be\ncarried out with 24 cases.\nTable 3 shows the mean scores on the YSR\/YASR at the start of psycho-\ntherapy and at the end of therapy, as well the statistical significance of any\nchange. Of the 24 YPCS service users for whom pre- and post-data was avail-\nable, scores reduced significantly on all subscales between pre- and post-\npsychotherapy.\nTable 4 shows the percentage of service users that scored within the clinical\nrange on the subscales at each time point. Proportionately more clients were\nfound to fall in the clinical range on the Internalizing scale at the start of the\nconsultation. Further analysis of the subscales revealed that, at the start of the\nfour sessions, 75% of YPCS clients had at least one clinical score and 16%\nscored at clinical levels on all three scales at assessment.\nA significant proportion of clients moved from the clinical to the non-clinical\nrange in the Internalizing (z = -2.598, p = 0.009) and Total (z = -2.126,\np = 0.033) subscales.

Reliable improvement\nrefers to a difference in scores between pre- and post-psychotherapy that is\nbeyond the natural variance of the YSR or YASR (outside the broken lines in\nFigures 3, 4 and 5): that is, an improvement that is beyond what might be\nexpected by chance alone.15 Clinically significant improvement refers to moving\nfrom the clinical to non-clinical range of scores. Each YPCS case for which\npre-post comparison data was available is represented by a single circle on\nFigures 3, 4 and 5. Clinical and reliable change is represented by the points\noutside the broken lines and above or below the solid cut-off lines in the\ndiagrams.16\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of clinical and reliable change in the Total\nSubscale of the YSR\/YASR of the 24 complete sets of data. No clients\u2019 scores\nshowed deterioration on this scale.\nFurther evaluation of the Internalizing and Externalizing scales reveals more\ndetail about the change in scores over time. Examination of Figure 4 shows\nthat a greater number of young people\u2019s scores showed improvement on the\nInternalizing scale. Of the YPCS clients for whom pre-post comparison data was\nTable 3.

None showed\ndeterioration.\nFigure 5 demonstrates the reliable and clinical change on the Externalizing\nscale of the YSR and YASR. At the end of the consultation, 4 (16.7%) of the\nYPCS group showed reliable improvement, 1 (4.2%) of whom showed both\nreliable and clinical improvement on the Externalizing scale.\nFig. 3: Reliable and clinically significant change in the YSR and YASR Total\nProblems Subscale\nFig. 4: Reliable and clinically significant change in the YSR and YASR Internal-\nizing Scale\n70 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nThus Figures 3, 4, and 5 show that a number of YPCS clients showed both\nreliable and clinical improvement on the Internalizing and Externalizing scales\nof the YSR\/YASR. The number showing improvement was greater on the\nInternalizing scale which suggests that the consultation is more effective for\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression.\nDiscussion\nThis paper has provided a review of the YPCS, including its history, a descrip-\ntion of the model, an overview of the relevant literature and an analysis of\noutcome.\nOutcomes\nYPCS service users\u2019 scores for whom pre- and post-data were available reduced\nsignificantly on all subscales of the YSR\/YASR between the start and end of the\nconsultation. Similarly, clinical severity significantly reduced in all cases and on\nall subscales. There was a trend towards moving from the clinical to the non-\nclinical range, reaching statistical significance in the Internalizing and Total\nsubscales. Further analysis of the subscales of the YSR\/YASR data revealed that\na number of YPCS clients showed both reliable and clinical improvement on\nthe Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the YSR\/YASR. The number\nshowing improvement was greater on the Internalizing scale which suggests\nthat the brief intervention is more effective at treating emotional problems as\nopposed to behavioural problems.\nOf note, Howard et al. (1986) similarly found that those with depressive\ndisorders began responding at the lowest \u2018doses\u2019 of psychotherapy. Likewise,\nHolmes (1994), following a review of outcome literature in this field, found\nthat people with depression responded well to brief dynamic psychotherapy.\nFig. 5: Reliable and clinically significant change in the YSR\/YASR in the YSR and\nYASR Externalizing Scale\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 71\nIn a study of psychotherapy with young people at another local service, the\nBrandon Centre, Baruch and Fearon (2002) found markedly lower rates of\nreliable improvement for externalizing problems and, indeed, found that nearly\n12% showed a deterioration. Thus it may be that this type of service is better\nsuited to those with fewer externalizing problems and may be more usefully\ntargeted at young people with more internalizing problems, such as symptoms\nof anxiety or low mood.\nThis raises the question of which aspects of the psychotherapy may be less\nhelpful to clients with externalizing problems. Baruch and Fearon (2002) found\nthat a supportive approach, compared with an interpretative approach, was\nassociated with a six-fold increase in the odds of reliable improvement in\nbehaviour problems. Thus it may be that a psychodynamic approach is less\nbeneficial to this group. Other studies have found that more intensive interven-\ntions are better for young people with externalizing problems (e.g. Fonagy &\nTarget 1994, 1996; Target & Fonagy 1994). This poses ethical issues about how\nsuch a service could be targeted towards those clients who are most likely to\nexperience the most benefit. However, this is inherently difficult within the aims\nof offering an easy-to-access self-referral intervention.17\nOf note, none of the YPCS clients for whom data were available showed\ndeterioration, including those with higher externalizing scores. Patients build\nup psychic defences that may serve a useful function. There could be a risk of\nthese being unravelled in very brief psychotherapy without sufficient time to\nheal. However, if this were the case, it might be expected for people to be\nworse at the end of four sessions, which was not found here. This provides\nreassuring information about the safety of this model, although it is acknow-\nledged that the numbers in this sample are relatively small to draw firm\nconclusions.\nNumber of Sessions Attended and YSR\/YASR Scores\nAnalysis of the number of sessions attended showed that those who attended all\nfour sessions, compared to those who did not, had significantly lower external-\nization scores on the YSR\/YASR at pre-assessment (see Table 2).This indicates\nthat those with fewer externalizing problems (e.g. rule-breaking and aggressive\nbehaviour) may be more likely to engage in this form of very brief psycho-\ntherapy.\nAlthough the number for whom outcome data is available in this study is\nrelatively small, Baruch et al. (1998), in their research of psychotherapy at the\nBrandon Centre, showed similar findings with respect to the type of presenting\nproblems. They found that young people who did not complete the YSR\/YASR\nquestionnaire at 1-year follow-up had attended fewer sessions, had higher exter-\nnalizing scores at presentation and fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of\nconduct disorder.\nThus, as well as apparently showing less benefit, young people with higher\nexternalizing problems seem to be less likely to engage. It may be that this\nself-referral model of very brief psychotherapy, which requires a client to\nbe reasonably proactive, may not be suited to clients with more behavioural\n72 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nproblems, who may have more chaotic lifestyles. On the other hand, young\npeople with more externalizing difficulties are likely to have greater social\nproblems and, it could be argued, greater need, and more efforts may be\nrequired to help these young people to engage in psychotherapy.\nLimitations\nA major limitation of this study is the relatively low rate of return of the\nYSR\/YASR forms. This makes it difficult to draw wide conclusions about the\neffectiveness of the consultation. For example, it could be argued that there was\nsomething different about those clients who completed the forms, such as that\nthey had less severe problems or that they were unusual in showing improve-\nment. However, the fact that it has been shown to be of clinical benefit to some\nyoung people is of value in itself.\nThis relatively low response rate is not unique to the YPCS as this is an issue\ngenerally affecting the use of postal questionnaire methods. The YPCS made\nattempts to improve the rate of return in October 2005, by changing from\nposting the end of treatment questionnaire to handing the form to the client in\nthe fourth session. In 2008, 100% of pre-consultation forms were returned and\n57% of post-consultation forms were returned. This should improve the reli-\nability and validity of future analyses.\nWhile the YSR\/YASR data has shown a benefit of the consultation for\nsome clients at the end of the psychotherapy, the longer-term benefits are not\nknown. It would be of interest to follow-up YPCS clients for a longer period,\nfor example, six months or a year, to be able to assess whether any of the\ninitial benefits have been sustained. However, this is likely to be difficult to\nachieve in practice. Given that the return rates immediately at the end of the\nconsultation are relatively low, it would be hard to achieve a sufficient rate of\nreturns at a later time to be of statistical or clinical significance. The popula-\ntion of interest are inherently a relatively transient group whom it would be\ndifficult and costly to follow up for longer periods of time. Indeed, the self-\nreferral nature of the service militates against long-term follow-up.\nWith respect to research methods, the gold standard would be to carry out a\nrandomized-controlled trial (RCT), e.g. comparing this consultation to a control\ngroup or to other forms of psychotherapy.This would provide more information\nabout whether it is this intervention that has actually made the difference, e.g.\nwould people have improved anyway over time without the intervention?\nHowever, there are intrinsic difficulties with applying RCTs to psychotherapy,\ne.g. due to the use of non-trained therapists for the control group (Milton et al.,\n2000). Richardson and Hobson (2000) argue that it is a narrow and oversimpli-\nfied view to claim that RCTs provide the only real evidence for psychotherapy.\nIndeed, as improvements were seen after only four weeks in this study, there is\nsupport for the idea that the intervention itself has helped, as it would be\nunlikely for clients to move from the clinical to the non-clinical range in such a\nshort time. Similarly, the fact that other research into psychotherapy in a similar\nlocality has comparable findings supports the validity of this data. Howard et al.\n(1986) argued that most controlled studies have shown psychotherapy to be\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 73\nmore beneficial than spontaneous recovery alone. In addition, there are ethical\nissues in randomizing young people with known emotional or behavioural\ndifficulties to a no-treatment control group (Kennedy, 2004).\nAnother limitation is the use of self-reports as the measure of outcome. This\nis a potential source of responder bias: for example, the client could answer the\nquestionnaire in a way that would please their therapist or attempt to portray\nthemselves in a more favourable light than is true, thus skewing the results.\nEvidence shows that self-report data are reliable for measuring internalizing\nproblems, but less accurate at assessing externalizing problems (e.g. Baruch\net al., 1999). There is a general consensus that reports from significant others\ntend to provide more accurate information regarding outcome. However, given\nthat the YPCS offers a confidential service to young people aged 16 and over, it\nwould not be appropriate to use an outcome measure relying on collateral\ninformation.\nBenefit of Very Brief Psychotherapy\nOverall, this study demonstrates some benefit of this consultation model of\nvery brief psychotherapy: for people to move from within a clinical range to\nborderline or non-clinical in only four sessions shows a value of the service.\nThere is a widely held premise amongst modern psychoanalytic psychothera-\npists that \u2018longer is better\u2019. While the small numbers for whom data is available\nin this evaluation do not refute this idea, it can be concluded that, for some\npeople at least, a benefit is seen with this intervention. This supports Howard\net al.\u2019s (1986) findings that a significant proportion of patients show the most\nimprovement in the first few sessions of psychotherapy. This paper does not\nadvocate that very brief psychotherapy or a fixed number of sessions should be\nimposed for all clients \u2013 simply that it is a valid option. Similarly, this paper is\nnot arguing that many people do not benefit from long-term psychotherapy,\nonly that some seem to benefit from very brief psychotherapy. In reality, there\nare likely to be large individual differences in how quickly different people\nrespond to therapy, as found by Barkham et al. (2006) in their exploration of the\n\u2018Good Enough Level\u2019 of psychotherapy.\nBaruch and Fearon (2002) found that their clients showed the greatest rate of\nimprovement in the first three months of psychotherapy, which challenged their\nprevious assumption that longer-term psychotherapy would be associated with\ngreater clinical benefits. Indeed, as a result, they have revised their service to\nalso include briefer interventions with shorter waiting times, similar to the\nYPCS model.\nThere has been a strong impetus towards the use of other modalities of\nbrief therapy within recent years, notably cognitive\u2013behavioural therapy\n(CBT). While such approaches are undoubtedly of help to some people, this\napproach does not suit everyone. Indeed, a RCT by Leff et al. (2000) com-\npared cognitive therapy with couple therapy and anti-depressant treatment\nbut found such a high drop-out rate amongst the cognitive therapy group\nearly on in the study that they soon abandoned this arm of the trial. Many\nclients may not want to do the \u2018homework\u2019 required. In addition, cognitive\n74 BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (2011) 27(1)\nmethods require the client to be able to access thoughts and feelings at a\nconscious level. Very brief psychodynamic approaches offer alternative\nmethods for those wanting to explore their psyche in a time-limited fashion.\nThese results should be of interest to those who are responsible for funding\npsychotherapy services, as shorter therapy is inherently cheaper. Information\nabout which types of problems show the most clinical improvement will help\nboth funders (e.g. NHS commissioners) and the YPCS to target resources\nmost effectively. Internationally, psychotherapy services are under financial\npressure. Under these circumstances, there is a tendency to target resources at\nthose with more severe mental health problems, such as psychotic disorders,\nwith a relative neglect of those with depressive, anxiety or other emotional\nproblems. A significant proportion of clients in this study fell within the clini-\ncal range, indicating that the service is not just reaching the \u2018worried well\u2019.\nVery brief psychotherapy services, such as the YPCS, are likely to fulfil an\nimportant preventative mental health role, which would save money in the\nlonger term.\nConclusion\nThis paper provides an overview of the Young People\u2019s Consultation Service\nand an evaluation of its effectiveness. The case vignette typifies the work done\nwithin the service as well as exemplifying the type of case that was found to\nshow a better outcome. Some limitations of this study have been discussed. As\nresponse rates for the outcome measures have improved, it would be helpful to\nre-evaluate subsequent data in order to assess whether these findings are con-\nsistent with a larger sample. This would enable the service to ensure that it is\ntargeted at those who show the most benefit. However, the fact that both clinical\nand statistical benefit has been demonstrated for at least some young people in\nonly four sessions is of importance. In addition, this consultation model of very\nbrief psychotherapy has a significant value in being of a self-referral nature and\nhaving short waiting times, thus being able to respond to clients\u2019 needs. The\nservice will continue to develop to meet the requirements of both young people\nand an evolving health service.\nNotes\n1. The Fraser Guidelines have subsequently changed this requirement for parental\nconsent for under-16s, provided an adolescent is deemed competent.\n2. \u2018Dose\u2013response\u2019 or dose\u2013effect\u2019 relationship describes the change in effect caused by\ndiffering levels of exposure to an event (usually a drug). This is often used to describe\nresponse to a medicine but provides a useful analogy for psychotherapy, e.g. with a \u2018dose\u2019\nbeing the equivalent of a \u2018session\u2019 of psychotherapy.\n3. It should be noted that subsequent studies have tended to show a slower response,\ne.g. about 50% showing improvement at between 13\u201318 sessions, e.g. Hansen et al.,\n2002\n4. Perhaps with the exception of medication such as antibiotics which have a more rapid\nmode of action. Few psychotropic drugs would have such efficacy.\n5. None were primarily behavioural in orientation.\nLIZ SEARLE ET AL. 75\n6. The \u2018two-plus-one\u2019 model involves two sessions one week apart, followed by a third\nsession three months later.\n7. This \u2018three-plus-one\u2019 model involves three weekly sessions with a follow-up session\nthree months later.\n8. The sessions are usually held on a weekly basis.\n9. For the purposes of consistency and brevity in this paper, the therapeutic staff are\nreferred to throughout as \u2018psychotherapists\u2019 although it is acknowledged that they do not\nall have specific psychotherapy training.\n10. The Youth Self Report Form (YSR) (Achenbach, 1991) is used for 11\u201318 year-olds.\n11. The Young Adult Self Report Form (YASR) (Achenbach, 1997) is used for clients\nover 18.\n12. Until October 2005, the YSR\/YASR form was posted to the client at the end of\ntreatment. In order to increase returns, this was changed to the form being handed to the\nclient by the psychotherapist in the final session.\n13. The Total Problems score is an average of the Internalizing scales and Externalizing\nscales, with additional scales for Thought Problems, Attention Problems, and Social\nProblems.\n14. Moving from the clinical to the non-clinical range would indicate that the person\nhas changed from a position where their symptoms were having a significant impact\non their everyday functioning to a situation where they were less affected.T scale scores\nare used to allow valid comparisons between client groups and individual change over\ntime.\n15. For example, this could occur by chance due to unreliability of a measure used.\n16. A score between 60 and 63 is borderline clinical (this borderline indicated by the\nsolid lines on Figures 3, 4 and 5), whereas scores over 63 are within the clinical range.\nThus, movement from below this cut-off to above 63 would indicate a clinically signifi-\ncant deterioration. Similarly, movement from above to below would indicate clinically\nsignificant improvement.\n17. Indeed, within the YPCS, the YSR and YASR are not completed until the client\narrives for the first session.Thus, the extent to which their problems may be internalizing\nor externalizing would not be fully known until they are already accepted into the\nservice.\nReferences\nAchenbach, T.M.
