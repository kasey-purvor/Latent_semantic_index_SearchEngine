Analysis of the EPIC and RGS\nspectra from the first observation provided evidence for a highly ion-\nized outflow with a velocity of \u223c0.09 \u00b1 0.01c (Pounds et al. 2003,\nhereafter P03), though this high velocity was contested following\na careful ion-by-ion modelling of the RGS data (Kaspi & Behar\n2006). However, a re-examination of the 2001 EPIC data (Pounds\n& Page 2006) resolved additional absorption lines in the EPIC MOS\nspectrum, strengthening the initial claim, and yielding a preferred\nvelocity of v \u223c 0.14c. Confirmation of the high-velocity outflow is\nimportant since, as noted in P03, the mechanical energy in the flow,\nif not highly collimated, is a significant fraction of the bolometric\nluminosity of PG1211+143 and could be typical of active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) accreting near the Eddington rate (King & Pounds\n2003), while also providing an example of the feedback required by\nthe linked growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in AGNs\nwith their host galaxy (King 2005).\nP03 also found a strong \u2018soft excess\u2019 over a 2\u201310 keV power-law\nfit of photon index \u0003 \u223c 1.8, a typical value for type 1 AGNs, and\na broad Fe K emission line. Subsequently, the 2001 EPIC spectrum\nof PG1211+143 has been used by Gierlinski & Done (2004), and\n\u0002E-mail: kap@star.le.ac.uk\nmore recently by Schurch & Done (2006), to demonstrate how strong\nabsorption of the intrinsic X-ray continuum in a \u2018velocity-smeared\u2019,\nhigh-column, ionized gas could provide an alternative explanation\n(to Comptonization) for the strong soft excess generally seen in\ntype 1 AGNs (Wilkes & Elvis 1987; Turner & Pounds 1989). A\nmore general study by Chevallier et al. (2006) also considered an\nionized reflection origin of the soft excess in AGNs (e.g. Crummy\net al. 2006) and concluded that absorption was the more likely cause\nof a strong soft excess (as in PG1211+143).\nIn the present paper we use the full XMM\u2013Newton data set from\nboth observations of PG1211+143 to re-examine the broad-band\nX-ray spectrum of PG1211+143, to better understand the structure\nand dynamics of the outflow, and thereby to assess the conjecture that\nthe massive and energetic outflow substantially defines the emerging\nspectrum.\nWe assume a redshift for PG1211+143 of z = 0.0809 (Marziani\net al. 1996).\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\nPG1211+143 was observed by XMM\u2013Newton on 2001 June 15 for\n\u223c53 ks, and again on 2004 June 21 for \u223c57 ks. In this paper we\nmainly use the high signal-to-noise ratio data from the EPIC cameras\n(Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001; Turner et al. 2001), but with a crucial constraint\non high-resolution spectral features provided by the simultaneous\nRGS data (den Herder et al. 2001). All X-ray data were first screened\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n824 K. A. Pounds and J. N. Reeves\nwith the XMM SAS v6.5 software and events selected corresponding\nto patterns 0\u20134 (single and double pixel events) for the pn cam-\nera and patterns 0\u201312 for the MOS cameras. We extracted EPIC\nsource counts within a circular region of 45 arcsec radius defined\naround the centroid position of PG1211+143, with the background\nbeing taken from a similar region, offset from but close to the target\nsource. After removal of data during periods of high background\nthe effective exposures for the pn camera were \u223c49.5 ks in 2001\nand \u223c25.2 ks in 2004, with corresponding exposures of \u223c103 and\n\u223c81 ks for the combined MOS cameras. Individual spectra were\nthen binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin, to facilitate use of\nthe \u03c72 minimization technique in spectral fitting.\nSpectral fitting was based on the XSPEC package (Arnaud 1996),\nversion 11.3. All spectral fits include absorption due to the line-of-\nsight Galactic column of NH = 2.85 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Murphy et al.\n1996) and errors are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level\n(\u0005\u03c7 2 = 2.7 for one interesting parameter).\n3 V I S UA L E X A M I NAT I O N O F T H E E P I C DATA\nFig. 1 displays the pn spectra of PG1211+143 from the 2001 and\n2004 observations in a way that has become conventional, by first\nfitting a power law over the 2\u201310 keV band and then extrapolating\nthis fit to lower energies, revealing the \u2018soft excess\u2019 typical of many\ntype 1 AGNs. This approach, followed by P03 in their initial analysis\nof the 2001 pn camera data of PG1211+143, yielded a power-law\nfit over the 2\u201310 keV band with a \u2018canonical\u2019 photon index of \u0003 \u223c\n1.79, together with an Fe K emission line (apparently with a broad\nred wing), and a strong soft excess parametrized by a blackbody\nspectrum of kT \u223c 0.1 keV. The same approach for the 2004 pn data\nof PG1211+143 yields a steeper power law (\u0003 \u223c 1.85) and a less\nstrong \u2018soft excess\u2019 (Fig. 1).\nAn alternative comparison of the 2001 and 2004 spectra is shown\nin Fig. 2, which plots the unmodelled, background-subtracted data.\nShown in this way, we see the spectral change is actually an increase\nin flux (from 2001 to 2004) between \u223c0.7\u20132 keV, and a (less ob-\nvious) decrease at \u223c0.5\u20130.7 keV. Interestingly, the 2001 and 2004\nspectra are essentially identical above \u223c3 keV. We choose to show\nthe MOS data in Fig. 2 since, while the broad flux profile is the\nsame, the higher energy resolution of the MOS data shows addi-\ntional low-energy structure in the 2001 spectrum.\nTo highlight the broad spectral changes between the 2001 and\n2004 data we then directly compared the two data sets, noting, for\nFigure 1. Comparison of the X-ray spectra of PG1211+143 displayed in the\nconventional way, showing the strong soft excess sitting above a \u2018canonical\u2019\npower law, for the pn data from the 2001 (black) and 2004 (red) observations.\nOn this view it appears that the soft excess in 2004 is weaker but \u2018hotter\u2019.\nFigure 2. Direct comparison of the background-subtracted MOS data from\nthe 2001 (black) and 2004 (red) observations shows the spectral change to\nbe due to an increase in flux between \u223c0.7\u20132 keV, and a less obvious flux\ndecrease at \u223c0.5\u20130.7 keV.\nFigure 3. The MOS spectral ratio obtained by dividing the 2001 count rate\nspectrum by that obtained in 2004. The most obvious feature is a broad\ndeficit at \u223c0.7\u20132 keV indicative of variable photoionized absorption.\nexample, that if absorption is having a controlling effect on the\nemerging spectrum, it should show up in the way in which individ-\nual spectra differ. As variable absorption (multiplicative) spectral\ncomponents are best seen in the ratio of data sets, we therefore re-\nbinned the EPIC data from 2001 to a minimum of 200 counts per\nchannel, in order to show any broad features more clearly, and then\nrebinned the 2004 data to have identical energy channels. Dividing\nthe first data set by the second then gave the spectral ratio plot of\nFig. 3. The most obvious feature is a broad flux deficit over the\n\u223c0.7\u20132 keV band, the shape and positioning of which is strongly\nsuggestive of differential absorption by ionized gas, with enhanced\nabsorption in the 2001 spectrum.\nFig. 4 shows the \u2018difference spectrum\u2019, obtained by subtracting\nthe 2004 (background-subtracted) data set from that of 2001. The\ndata have again been rebinned to a minimum of 200 counts per\nbin. While above \u223c2 keV the difference spectrum reflects the very\nsimilar hard X-ray fluxes, in addition to a lower flux at \u223c0.7\u20132 keV\nwe see a significant excess peaking at \u223c0.5 keV in the 2001 data.\nIn summary, a direct comparison of the 2001 and 2004 MOS\ndata (comparison of the pn data shows the same features) suggests\na decrease in continuum absorption is the main cause of the spectral\nchange in PG1211+143 from 2001 to 2004, together with a decrease\nin an emission component specific to the soft X-ray band. Implicitly,\nboth results support the contention that reprocessing in ionized gas\nis a primary factor in determining the form of the observed broad-\nband X-ray spectrum.

The MOS difference spectrum, obtained by subtracting the 2004\nspectrum from that of 2001, shows the near-identical hard X-ray spectra,\nwith a lower flux at \u223c0.7\u20132 keV and comparable higher flux peaking at\n\u223c0.5\u20130.6 keV in the 2001 observation.\nvariable absorption is the similarity in the ionizing flux during the\n2001 and 2004 observations indicated by the near-identical spectra\nabove \u223c3 keV, suggesting a change in covering factor (CF) rather\nthan ionization parameter.\n4 T H E C A S E F O R A F R E S H A P P ROAC H\nTO M O D E L L I N G T H E X - R AY S P E C T RU M\nO F P G 1 2 1 1+1 4 3\nAccumulation of high-quality, broad-band X-ray spectra of AGNs,\nparticularly from XMM\u2013Newton EPIC, has raised doubts over the\nphysical reality of the soft excess and also the ubiquity of the\nrelativistic Fe K emission line suggested by earlier ASCA ob-\nservations. In particular, the conventional interpretation of the\nsoft excess in type 1 AGNs, as arising by Comptonization of\ncooler disc photons, has been questioned by Gierlinski & Done\n(2004).\nThose authors studied 26 AGNs from the PG sample observed\nwith XMM, fitting the X-ray spectra with a double Comptoniza-\ntion model. They found that while Comptonization of the accretion\ndisc emission provided a good statistical fit to the soft excess be-\nlow 2 keV in every case, the temperature of the cool Comptonizing\nregion was remarkably constant over the sample, despite that sam-\nple having a large range in mass and luminosity, and hence in disc\ntemperature, and in the ratio of power released in the hot plasma\nto that from the disc. Given these difficulties, Gierlinski & Done\n(2004) proposed that the soft excess was an artefact of ionized ab-\nsorption in a subrelativistic wind above the inner accretion disc. In\norder to explain the generally smooth form of the soft excess the\nabsorbing gas was required to have a complex velocity structure.\nSubsequently, Schurch & Done (2006) have explored this \u2018smeared\nabsorber\u2019 model in more detail, showing \u2013 in particular \u2013 that by\nincluding re-emission from the ionized gas the strong soft excess in\nPG1211+143 could be reproduced.\nChevallier et al. (2006) have also examined alternative origins of\nthe soft excess in AGNs, including enhanced soft X-ray emission\nfrom an ionized accretion disc (e.g. Crummy et al. 2006). Chevallier\net al. (2006) found that ionized absorption in a high speed outflow,\nor an inhomogeneous accretion flow could best explain some AGN\nX-ray spectra, particularly those with very strong soft excesses (as\nPG1211+143), while only weak excesses can be modelled by re-\nflection unless the primary continuum is strongly depressed (Fabian\net al. 2002). However, they concluded that simple \u2018smeared\u2019 absorp-\ntion models would require \u2018fine tuning\u2019 to constrain the depth of the\ntrough near 1 keV and thereby be generally applicable.\nA second spectral feature whose interpretation has been ques-\ntioned recently is the broad wing seen to the low-energy side of\nthe Fe K fluorescent emission line in a number of bright AGNs.\nWhile widely considered to be due to Doppler and strong grav-\nity broadening of radiation reflected off the innermost accretion\ndisc (e.g. Fabian et al. 2000), an alternative explanation as (again)\nan artefact of absorption has been proposed in specific cases (e.g.\nInoue & Matsumoto 2003; Kinkhabwala 2003).\nClarifying the nature of such significant features in the X-ray spec-\ntra of AGNs is important to explore the accretion process, outflows\nof ejected matter, and ultimately the properties of the central black\nhole. Its strong soft excess, evidence for a massive and energetic\noutflow, and high accretion ratio make PG1211+143 a particularly\ninteresting object by which to explore an alternative approach to\ndeconvolving the broad-band X-ray spectrum.\n5 D E V E L O P I N G A N E W S P E C T R A L M O D E L\nF O R T H E 2 0 0 1 O B S E RVAT I O N O F P G 1 2 1 1+1 4 3\nWe begin the fresh approach by noting that the intrinsic continuum\nover the broad X-ray band now visible to XMM\u2013Newton might not\nbe adequately described by a simple power law derived by fitting to\nthe data over the \u223c2\u201310 keV band. Recent studies of spectral vari-\nability in MCG-6-30-15 (Vaughan & Fabian 2004) and 1H0419-577\n(Pounds et al. 2004), among the most detailed broad-band spectral\nanalyses to date, have provided clear evidence of a variable power-\nlaw component of slope significantly steeper than the \u2018canonical\nvalue\u2019 of \u0003 \u223c 1.9 (Nandra & Pounds 1994). That finding is im-\nportant in the present context since, if absorption is to create the\nimpression of a strong \u2018soft excess\u2019, then the underlying contin-\nuum must be much steeper than it appears above \u223c2 keV. To allow\nfor that possibility, while retaining a harder \u2018primary\u2019 continuum in\nthe range predicted by the disc\/corona model (Haardt & Maraschi\n1991), we include two power-law components in the new model. For\nsimplicity we will call these the primary and secondary continuum\ncomponents.\nIndication from the flux ratio plot that the main spectral\nchange between the 2001 and 2004 XMM\u2013Newton observations of\nPG1211+143 is due to a change in ionized absorption affecting\nthe spectrum above \u223c0.7 keV, suggests the model should include\na moderately ionized (\u2018warm\u2019) absorber, in addition to the highly\nionized absorber responsible for the narrow, blueshifted absorption\nlines (P03; Pounds & Page 2006). Finally, we include components\nto model the re-emission from both ionized absorbers.\nIn XSPEC terms the prospective model is then WA(PO1*ABS1*\nABS2 + PO2*ABS3*ABS4 + EM1\/3 + EM2\/4), where WA\nrepresents the line-of-sight Galactic column, included in all fits,\nand PO1, PO2 are the separate power-law components. ABS1 and\n3 represent the high-ionization absorber, differing only in column\ndensity on the two continua, while ABS2 and 4 similarly repre-\nsent the lower ionization absorption. Finally, EM1\/3 and EM2\/4\nmodel the re-emission from the highly ionized and warm absorbers,\nrespectively. All ABS and EM components are modelled by pho-\ntoionized gas using the XSTAR code (Kallman et al. 1996). We assume\na relatively high turbulent velocity of 1000 km s\u22121 full width at half-\nmaximum (FWHM) in order to allow substantial line opacity before\nsaturation. Free parameters in each XSTAR grid are the column den-\nsity and ionization parameter, with outflow (or inflow) velocities\nincluded as an adjustment to the apparent redshift of the absorbing\nor emitting gas. All abundant elements from C to Fe are included\nwith the relative abundances as a further variable input parameter,\nbut tied for all the XSTAR components and limited to within a factor\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

Further constraints on the model are to tie the ioniza-\ntion parameters of ABS1 and 3, and of ABS2 and 4, and also with\ntheir respective re-emission spectra.\nWe first evaluated the model with the pn and MOS data sets,\nseparately, given their differing low-energy responses and the higher\nMOS resolution, which potentially is important in resolving features\nin the soft X-ray band (Pounds & Vaughan 2006).\nAn excellent statistical fit was obtained for the pn data with the\ncomponent parameters as listed in Table 1. The spectral components\nare shown together with the total model and pn data in Fig. 5. Fit-\nting the model to the 2001 MOS data yielded similar component\nparameters, although the statistical quality of the fit was less good.\nThe fit parameters are listed in line 2 of Table 1 and the data, model\nand separate model components are shown in Fig. 6.\nVisual examination of Figs 5 and 6 clarifies the main features of\nthe new model.\nAbove \u223c3 keV the spectrum is dominated by the \u2018primary\u2019 power\nlaw, with a photon index \u0003 \u223c 2.2, at the upper end of \u2013 but consis-\ntent with \u2013 the \u2018accepted\u2019 range for type 1 AGN spectra. At lower\nenergies the secondary power-law component (\u0003 \u223c 3.1) is more\nimportant, while below \u223c1 keV re-emission, particularly from the\n\u2018warm\u2019 absorber, becomes significant. We note that variability in this\ncomponent between 2001 and 2004 could explain the low-energy\npeak in the difference spectrum of Fig. 4.\nStrong absorption of the primary power law is seen to be respon-\nsible for the mid-band (\u223c2\u20136 keV) spectral curvature, with ionized\ngas column densities of NH \u223c 3\u20135 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122.

Our approach in P03 and in Pounds & Page\n(2006) was based on the visual identification of narrow absorption\nlines, backed up by modelling with XSTAR. While that works well\nwhere the aim, as there, was to determine the velocity of a strong\noutflow, here we have to rely principally on modelling to interpret\nthe multicomponent broad-band spectrum of PG1211+143. For the\nhighly ionized absorber, the high velocity is again constrained by\nthe presence of narrow absorption lines in the EPIC data, with the\nhighly ionized XSTAR component having an apparent blueshift (in\nthe observer frame) of \u223c0.06 \u00b1 0.01, indicating an outflow veloc-\nity (in the AGN rest frame) of v \u223c (0.14 \u00b1 0.01)c. For the warm\nabsorber the XSTAR fits yield apparent redshifts of \u223c0 \u00b1 0.02 (pn)\nand \u223c0.02 \u00b1 0.02 (MOS). Constraints on the velocity of this mod-\nerately ionized absorber are less secure, being derived from fitting\nthe mid-band spectral curvature and the rather complex absorption\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

The column density and ionization parameter also affect\nthe spectral curvature while, at lower energies, the re-emission spec-\ntrum has overlapping spectral structure. It does appear, however, that\nthe moderately ionized gas is outflowing at a somewhat lower, but\nstill high velocity.\nIn contrast, the emission line spectra in both pn and MOS models\nprefer a low mean velocity in the rest frame of the galaxy, with\nan apparent redshift of the XSTAR emission spectra of \u223c0.07 \u00b1\n0.01, corresponding to a mean outflow velocity in the rest frame\nof PG1211+143 of \u223c3000 \u00b1 3000 km s\u22121. Visual examination of\nthe spectral components in Figs 5 and 6 suggests the velocity sen-\nsitivity of the emission line gas derives from the strong O VII and\nO VIII lines at \u223c0.5 and \u223c0.6 keV.\n5.2 Component luminosities, absorption and re-emission\nOverall and component luminosities in the pn and MOS model\nfits are sufficiently similar to take their average values. For the\n2001 observation we find an overall luminosity L0.4\u201310 \u223c 1.2 \u00d7\n1044 erg s\u22121, with a 2\u201310 keV luminosity L2\u201310 \u223c 5.0 \u00d7\n1043 erg s\u22121. The primary power law is the dominant compo-\nnent with L0.4\u201310 \u223c 5 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121; this increases to \u223c1.3 \u00d7\n1044 erg s\u22121 when corrected for absorption (90 per cent being in the\nmoderately ionized absorber). The secondary power law has an ob-\nserved luminosity L0.4\u201310 \u223c 6 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121, increasing to \u223c7 \u00d7\n1043 erg s\u22121 when corrected for absorption.\nRe-emission from the ionized outflow provides a strong contribu-\ntion to the observed soft X-ray flux below \u223c1 keV, with an integrated\nluminosity in the emission line spectrum Lem \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121\nin the moderately ionized component and Lem \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121\nin the high-ionization component. Comparing the absorbed and re-\nemitted luminosities we estimate the covering fractions (CFs), for\nan optically thin radial flow, of \u223c0.2 and \u223c0.1 for the warm and\nhighly ionized gas components, respectively.\n6 C H E C K I N G F O R C O N S I S T E N C Y W I T H\nT H E R G S S P E C T RU M O F 2 0 0 1\nA key constraint of the new spectral model is to produce a strong\nsoft excess with no strong narrow spectral lines in absorption or\nemission, although there should be weak absorption lines imposed\nin the soft band by the highly ionized, high-velocity flow. Several\nsuch lines, at low signal-to-noise ratio in the RGS data, were claimed\nin our initial analysis reported in P03.\nExamination of Figs 5 and 6 suggest the narrow absorption line\nspectrum would be significantly \u2018diluted\u2019 by the dominance, at low\nenergies, of the weakly absorbed secondary power-law continuum.\nHowever, the absence of strong, narrow emission lines in the RGS\nspectrum requires substantial line broadening of the re-emission\ncomponent in the EPIC model spectrum. Conceivably this could be\na result of a high-velocity flow integrated over a wide angle, which\nwould be consistent with the estimated CF of \u223c0.2, for a partially\nfilled outflow.\nThe high intrinsic resolution of the RGS therefore offers a valu-\nable check on the model spectrum of PG1211+143 over the soft\nX-ray band, even if the emission lines are strongly broadened. Test-\ning the model against the RGS data from the 2001 observation ini-\ntially gave an unacceptable [\u03c72 per degree of freedom (d.o.f.) =\n845\/636], with the steep power law (\u0003 \u223c 3) dominant. Examina-\ntion of the data:model residuals showed this to be due to substan-\ntial low-energy structure, too broad to be fitted by the narrow line\nFigure 7.

We therefore added a Gaus-\nsian smoothing factor to the emission line component in the model\n(gsmooth in XSPEC). The broadened emission lines now increased in\nstrength to match the observed spectral structure, with the power-law\ncomponent becoming correspondingly weaker, yielding an excel-\nlent fit (\u03c72 per d.o.f. = 649\/635 over the 0.35\u20131.5 keV band). Both\nunsmoothed and smoothed spectral fits are reproduced in Fig. 7,\nwhere the soft X-ray emission can be identified in the figure, in or-\nder of increasing energy, with K-shell emission of N, O and Ne, to-\ngether with several strong Fe L lines. The apparent redshift from the\nXSTAR emission spectrum fit of \u223c0.08 \u00b1 0.01 was consistent with the\nEPIC data fits, while \u2013 encouragingly \u2013 the RGS data also requires\na steep power-law component (\u0003 \u223c 3.3 \u00b1 0.2).\nFig. 8 provides another view of the spectral structure in the soft\nX-ray band, showing the broad spectral lines that are successfully\nmodelled by re-emission from the ionized gas in PG1211+143. The\nbest-fitting Gaussian (\u03c3 \u223c 25 eV at 0.6 keV), would correspond to\nvelocity broadening of 29 000 km s\u22121 FWHM, which again would\nsuggest the high-velocity flow occurs over a wide angle. Much better\ndata will be required to determine the true emission line profiles and\nconstrain the effects of saturation in the principal resonance lines.\nThe important point for the present study is that the spectral\nmodel developed to fit the EPIC data is fully consistent with the\nRGS data provided the emission lines are strong but broad. In ad-\ndition, the RGS spectral fit requires a steep power-law continuum,\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 374, 823\u2013831\n828 K. A. Pounds and J. N.

To place the soft X-ray emis-\nsion in a wider context we note it represents some 0.5 per cent of the\nbolometric luminosity of PG1211+143. In comparison, an XMM\u2013\nNewton observation of NGC1068, a Seyfert 2 galaxy with a similar\nbolometric luminosity, found an integrated soft X-ray emission lu-\nminosity of only \u223c5 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 (Pounds & Vaughan 2006). The\nmuch stronger soft X-ray line emission from PG1211+143 supports\nthe view of a strong centrally condensed emission region that would\nbe hidden from view in a Seyfert 2.\n7 A P P LY I N G T H E N E W S P E C T R A L M O D E L\nTO T H E 2 0 0 4 O B S E RVAT I O N O F P G 1 2 1 1+1 4 3\nAs the new spectral model was based on the evidence for variable\nionized absorption, and re-emission, from a direct comparison of\nthe 2001 and 2004 data sets it is clearly important to show that the\n2001 model parameters can be varied in a physically reasonable way\nto also describe the 2004 spectra.\nTo that end we tested the new spectral model with the 2004 data\nof PG1211+143, keeping the element abundances in XSTAR and\nionization parameters unchanged. Justification for the constant ion-\nization parameters is based on the near-identical hard X-ray fluxes\nFigure 9. The spectral model fitted to the 2004 pn camera data of\nPG1211+143. The model components are primary power law (green), addi-\ntional power law (dark blue), re-emission from the moderately ionized gas\n(light blue) and re-emission from the highly ionized gas (magenta).\n(which we take as a good proxy for the ionizing luminosity). Fig. 9\nillustrates the fit and the separate model components for the 2004\npn data, which yielded an acceptable \u03c7 2 per d.o.f. = 691\/625. The\nfit to the 2004 MOS data was statistically excellent, with \u03c7 2 per\nd.o.f. = 350\/351, as was that to the 2004 RGS data. Comparing the\n2001 and 2004 model fits to both EPIC and RGS data shows that\nthe spectral change is primarily due to a stronger secondary power-\nlaw component, though the \u2018warm\u2019 absorption of the primary power\nlaw and the soft X-ray line emission also appear to be weaker. The\ncolumn density of the highly ionized absorber is a factor of \u223c2\nlower, consistent with the significantly weaker absorption line at\n\u223c7 keV in 2004. Dilution by a stronger steep power-law continuum\nand weaker line emission both contribute to the reduced soft X-ray\nstructure evident in the 2004 RGS spectrum (Fig. 10).\nIn summary, we find reasonable changes in the 2001 spectral\nmodel also fit the 2004 data. The net effect of a stronger secondary\npower law, with reduced ionized absorption (and re-emission) can\nsatisfactorily match the ratio and difference spectra shown in Figs 3\nand 4. However, given the relative complexity of the spectral de-\nconvolution we stress that more than two spectral \u2018snapshots\u2019 will\nbe required to fully resolve and understand the spectral variability.\nFor example, while our modelling suggests the reduced soft X-ray\nstructure in the 2004 spectrum is a combination of a stronger contin-\nuum and weaker line emission, we would expect further observations\nto show this to be coincidental.\nFigure 10. Ratio of the 2004 RGS data to the model shown in Fig. 9 when\nthe metals C\u2013Fe are removed from the XSTAR emission line spectra. Al-\nthough spectral structure is seen, it is at a significantly lower level than in\nthe corresponding plot for the 2001 RGS data (Fig. 8, lower panel).\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 374, 823\u2013831\nA high-velocity outflow from PG1211+143 829\n8 D I S C U S S I O N\nWe have explored a new model to describe the complex broad-band\nX-ray spectrum of the narrow emission line QSO PG1211+143.\nThe model structure was guided by a comparison of the spectral\ndata from two XMM\u2013Newton observations of PG1211+143 in 2001\nand 2004, which suggested a reduction in ionized absorption (and\nre-emission) in the latter case. In addition, the model allows for a\nsecond continuum component, described by a steeper power law,\nto take account of evidence from other AGN studies that a steep\npower law can be a principal contributor to spectral variability.\nAlthough more complex than the conventional description of the\nX-ray spectrum of PG1211+143, where the hard power law and\nstrong \u2018soft excess\u2019 are both modelled by Comptonization of\nsoft accretion disc photons, the new model is encouragingly self-\nconsistent. Thus, the main continuum absorption is modelled by\nmoderate ionization (warm) matter of column density NH \u223c 3 \u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 and log \u03be \u223c 1.4, with re-emission from gas of the same\nionization parameter dominating the observed spectral structure be-\nlow \u223c1 keV. Modelling the higher resolution RGS data confirms the\ncontributions of the broadened emission lines and the steep power-\nlaw continuum to the soft X-ray spectrum of PG1211+143. From\na comparison of the absorbed and re-emitted luminosities we find\nCFs of \u223c0.2 and \u223c0.1, respectively, for the warm and highly ion-\nized outflows. In turn, the mechanical energy in the highly ionized\noutflow is confirmed to be an order of magnitude larger than the\nluminosity in the secondary power law, supporting our conjecture\nthat shocks in the outflow could drive that additional continuum\ncomponent.\nApplication of the 2001 spectral model to the 2004 data suggests\nthe primary change is due to an increase in the steep power-law con-\ntinuum rather than a decrease in absorption of the primary power\nlaw. In fact, given the quality of the shorter 2004 observation, it is\npossible the ionized absorption did not change, a possibility con-\nsistent with the very similar ionizing fluxes indicated by the com-\nparable hard X-ray spectra which would have required a change to\nbe mainly in column density (or CF). A more extended observation\nof PG1211+143, exploring spectral variability over hours to days,\nwould be very interesting.\n8.1 The ionized outflow\nThe spectral curvature near \u223c1 keV, previously seen as the onset of\na strong \u2018soft excess\u2019 in PG1211+143, is attributed in our model\nprimarily to absorption and re-emission in a substantial column\ndensity (NH \u223c few times 1022 cm\u22122) of moderately ionized gas.\nAlthough not as well constrained as the high-ionization gas, which\nproduces an array of narrow absorption lines (Pounds & Vaughan\n2006), the warm absorber also appears to be outflowing at a high\nvelocity. With the present \u2018snapshot\u2019 spectra it is not clear how\nthese absorption components might be related; perhaps they simply\nrepresent different matter densities in a common flow.\nIdentifying the strong absorption line observed at \u223c7 keV with\nFe XXV He\u03b1 (here and in Pounds & Page 2006) increases the velocity\nof the highly ionized outflow from \u223c(0.09 \u00b1 0.01)c (P03) to v \u223c\n(0.14 \u00b1 0.01)c, with a corresponding reduction in the ionization\nparameter (and column density) from the XSTAR modelling. These\nchanges can then be applied to the radiatively driven wind model\ndiscussed in P03 and King & Pounds (2003).\nWith an ionizing X-ray luminosity (\u00027 keV) of 3 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121\nand ionization parameter \u03be (= L\/nr 2) \u223c 1000, we have nr 2 \u223c 3 \u00d7\n1040 cm\u22121. Assuming a spherically symmetric flow, at an outflow\nvelocity of 0.14c, the mass-loss rate is then of the order of \u02d9M \u223c\n35b M\u0004 yr\u22121, where b \u0003 1 allows for the collimation of the flow.\nFrom a comparison of absorbed and re-emitted luminosities in the\npresent analysis we found b \u223c 0.1, yielding an outflow mass rate\n\u02d9M \u223c 3.5 M\u0004 yr\u22121. This compares with \u02d9MEdd = 1.6 M\u0004 yr\u22121 for\na non-rotating SMBH of mass \u223c4 \u00d7 107 M\u0004 (Kaspi et al. 2000)\naccreting at an efficiency of 10 per cent.\nThe mechanical energy is now \u223c1045 erg s\u22121, a factor of \u223c15\nlarger than the luminosity in the steep power-law component. The\nratio of mechanical energy to the bolometric luminosity remains\n(as in P03) roughly consistent with the value v\/c predicted for a\nradiatively driven outflow (King & Pounds 2003). Again, if the\nhigher velocity equates to the escape velocity at the launch radius\nRlaunch (from an optically thick photosphere or radiatively extended\ninner disc), v \u223c 0.14c corresponds to Rlaunch \u223c 50Rs (where Rs =\n2GM\/c2 is the Schwarzschild radius), or 3 \u00d7 1014 cm. The EPIC\ndata show significant flux variability in the harder (2\u201310 keV) band\non time-scales of 2\u20133 h (Fig. 1 in P03), which would be compatible\nwith the above scale size relating to the primary (disc\/corona) X-ray\nemission region.\nBelow \u223c1 keV we find a similar time-scale of variability, but with\nreduced amplitude. The simplest interpretation is that the photoion-\nized emission is constant over hours, implying that the secondary\npower-law component is also produced close to the inner disc. Bet-\nter data will be needed to clarify the time variability and scale size\nof the separate model components.\nWe have very little information on the geometry of the warm\noutflow, responsible for most of the continuum absorption (and re-\nemission), except that it presumably originates close to the black\nhole (from its apparent high velocity) and is largely confined within\na radius of \u223c1 pc (by comparison with the much weaker soft X-ray\nemission seen from Seyfert 2 galaxies). The observed soft X-ray\nluminosity of Lem \u223c 2 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 corresponds to an emission\nmeasure \tn2 V \u223c 1066 cm\u22123 for a solar abundance gas with ioniza-\ntion parameter \u03be \u223c 25. With an ionizing luminosity \u223c1044 erg s\u22121,\nthe ionization parameter gives nr 2 \u223c 4 \u00d7 1042. Assuming a spherical\nshell of radius r, thickness \u03b4r and density n, a second constraint is\nthe measured column density n\u03b4r \u223c 4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122. Interestingly,\nthese parameters match the above emission measure independent\nof the assumed scale size. For example, assuming r \u223c 1016 cm, we\nfind n \u223c 4 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22123 and \u03b4r \u223c 1012 cm. For r \u223c 1017 cm, an\nalternative set of self-consistent parameters are n \u223c 4 \u00d7 108 cm\u22123\nand \u03b4r \u223c 1014 cm.\nAlthough the above estimates are very crude, we note the rela-\ntively high densities are essential for much of the gas to remain in\na state of moderate ionization so close to the powerful continuum\nsource. A likely geometry may be for the warm gas to exist in many,\ndispersed small clouds rather than the thin spherical shell assumed\nabove.\nThat would extend the picture developed in P03 and King &\nPounds (2003) to incorporate higher density \u2018clouds\u2019 entrapped in\nthe fast outflow and responsible for the strong low-energy absorp-\ntion (and re-emission) previously interpreted as the \u2018soft excess\u2019.\nA possible scenario might be where an inhomogeneous flow ac-\ncretes through the inner disc to a radius R where radiation pressure\ncauses the matter to be launched at the local escape velocity. As\nthe outflow expands outwards the mean density will fall, as will the\nfilling factor of the cooler, more opaque, matter. If the secondary\npower law is indeed formed by shocks in the fast outflow, then a\ncentrally condensed absorber could explain the stronger absorption\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

Reeves\nwe find on the primary power-law continuum (assumed to form in\nthe disc\/corona).\n8.2 The second power-law component\nThe incentive for including a second power-law component de-\nrived mainly from the detailed studies of MCG-6-30-15 (Vaughan\n& Fabian 2004) and 1H 0419-577 (Pounds et al. 2004), where dif-\nference spectrum analyses showed the primary spectral change in\neach case could be attributed to a variable flux, steep power law. It\nis also interesting to recall that a \u2018broken power law\u2019, with a steeper\ncomponent at lower energies has often been used to parametrize\nAGN spectra, without any physical explanation being offered. In\nthe present study of PG1211+143 we find the inclusion of a sec-\nond continuum component provides the simplest variable to allow\na good fit to both 2001 and 2004 EPIC data. In contrast, a reduction\nin the CF (modelled by a lower column) of ionized absorber on the\nprimary power law is not able \u2013 alone \u2013 to fit both data sets.\nA further reason to include the second power-law component in\nour modelling was to quantify the conjecture that the mechanical\nenergy in the high-velocity outflow in PG1211+143 might power a\ncontinuum component additional to primary disc\/coronal emission.\nA key factor in determining the mass and energy in the outflow is the\ndegree of collimation. Our modelling of the broad-band spectrum of\nPG1211+143 has quantified both the absorbed and re-emitted fluxes\nfor the ionized outflow and thereby allowed the CFs (or fractional\nsolid angle) of to be estimated. With a CF of \u223c0.1, we have seen that\nthe mechanical energy in the fast, highly ionized outflow is ample\nto power the second continuum (steep power-law) component. Few\nhours variability below \u223c1 keV, although of lower amplitude than in\nthe harder X-ray band, suggests the second continuum component\noriginates at a small radius. If powered by the fast outflow, possi-\nbilities might be internal shocks in the flow (perhaps analogous to\nthe process suggested in gamma ray bursts), or by running into the\nslower moving clouds providing the bulk of the continuum opac-\nity. A possible X-ray emission mechanism in either case could be\nComptonization of optical\u2013UV disc photons, where the steep power\nlaw would be a result of the relatively lower energy content of the\nelectron \u2018corona\u2019 compared with that responsible for the primary\npower-law continuum.\n9 A R E V I S E D A S S E S S M E N T O F AG N X - R AY\nS P E C T R A\nIn contemplating how widely applicable our new model might be to\ndescribing the X-ray spectra of type 1 AGNs, we note that a bolo-\nmetric luminosity of the order of 4 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 and reverberation\nmass estimate for the SMBH in PG1211+143 of M \u223c 4 \u00d7 107 M\u0004\n(Kaspi et al. 2000) indicates PG1211+143 is accreting close to the\nEddington rate. Additional support for that view comes from the op-\ntical classification of PG1211+143 as a Narrow Line Seyfert, now\nthought to be a characteristic of a high accretion ratio (e.g. Pounds\n& Vaughan 2000 and references therein). King & Pounds (2003)\nprovided a simple physical model whereby massive, high-velocity\noutflows can be expected in AGNs accreting at or above the Ed-\ndington limit. PG1211+143 may therefore be a special case among\nbright, nearby AGNs.\nHowever, it is intriguing that the X-ray spectra of many bright\ntype 1 AGNs have a similar profile to that of PG1211+143 shown in\nFig. 1, suggesting ionized absorption is a common cause of the \u2018soft\nexcess\u2019. An alternative model that works well for weaker soft ex-\ncesses invokes strong photoionized reflection (Crummy et al. 2006),\nwhere the smooth spectral profile is explained by relativistic broad-\nening in the inner disc.\nFurther observations of PG1211+143, extended over several\ndays, are essential to test the new spectral model, in particular to\nresolve the contributions of variable absorption (and re-emission)\nfrom ionized gas to the overall spectral form. The variability time-\nscale of the secondary power law will constrain the scale of the\nregion where we predict the fast outflow undergoes internal shocks.\nDetecting hard X-ray emission from PG1211+143 above \u223c20 keV\nwould also support the need for a continuum component with pho-\nton index less steep than that in the single power-law\/absorption\nmodels (Gierlinski & Done 2004; Schurch & Done 2006). Finally,\nmuch deeper RGS spectra are needed to resolve the broad emission\nline profiles indicated in the model fits.\n1 0 S U M M A RY\n(1) Previous analyses of the 2001 XMM\u2013Newton observation of\nthe bright quasar PG1211+143 have reported evidence of a high-\nvelocity ionized outflow (P03; Pounds & Page 2006). By decon-\nvolving the absorption and emission luminosities in the broad-band\nspectrum, we now find a CF of the order of \u223c0.1 for the fast outflow,\nconfirming the mass rate and mechanical energy to be comparable\nto the accretion rate and bolometric luminosity, respectively.\n(2) We show that an additional outflow component of less highly\nionized (and hence more opaque) gas can impose significant curva-\nture on the emerging spectrum near \u223c1 keV, thereby replicating a\n\u2018soft excess\u2019 when applied to a continuum steeper than the canonical\nvalue.\n(3) Narrow absorption lines in the EPIC spectra show the outflow\nto be approximately radial, in contrast with the assumption of a\nrelativistically smeared absorber in the soft excess modelling of\nSchurch & Done (2006).\n(4) However, like Schurch & Done (2006), we find that re-\nemission of the absorbed continuum also makes a significant con-\ntribution to the observed soft X-ray flux. The high integrated lumi-\nnosity of the photionized outflow in PG1211+143 is more than an\norder of magnitude larger than that of NGC 1068, a Seyfert 2 galaxy\nof comparable bolometric luminosity, consistent with an expanding\nflow originating close to the SMBH.\n(5) Inclusion of a secondary continuum component, which en-\nergetically could be powered by the high-velocity outflow, is sup-\nported by a fit to the soft X-ray spectrum of the RGS. The RGS\nanalysis also requires the soft X-ray line emission to be strongly\nbroadened, possibly by a combination of velocity broadening and\nline saturation.\n(6) Testing the resulting model with data from a second XMM\u2013\nNewton observation of PG1211+143 in 2004 shows that the spectral\nchange is dominated by an increase in the secondary power-law\ncomponent, which mimics the effect of reduced ionized absorption\nof the primary continuum.\n(7) A further interesting consequence of the double power-law\nmodel is to remove the conceptual difficulty in considering partial\ncovering as an alternative to the extreme relativistic Fe K emission\nline apparent in a simple power-law fit (P03).\n(8) We suggest that the above model could be generally applicable\nto type 1 AGNs accreting at or above to the Eddington limit.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThe results reported here are based on observations obtained with\nXMM\u2013Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.
