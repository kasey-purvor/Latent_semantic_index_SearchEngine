This analy-\nsis is complete at next-to-next-to-leading order and includes the full resummation\nof logarithms at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy and some partial contribu-\ntions at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Compared with fixed-order\ncomputations at next-to-next-to-leading order the scale dependence and conver-\ngence of the perturbative series is greatly improved for both the position of the\npeak and the normalization of the total cross section. Nevertheless, we identify\na possible source of large scale dependence in the result. At present we estimate\nthe remaining theoretical uncertainty of the normalization of the total cross sec-\ntion to be of the order of 10% and for the position of the peak of the order of\n100 MeV.\n1Permanent address after September 1st: Grup de F\u00b4\u0131sica Teo`rica and IFAE, Universitat\nAuto`noma de Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.\n1 Introduction\nThe existence of (heavy) quarks with a large mass compared with \u039bQCD, like\nthe top, the bottom, and maybe the charm, makes particularly interesting the\nstudy of physical processes where a heavy quark pair is created close to threshold,\nbecause accurate experimental information over the whole near-threshold region\nmay allow for a precise determination of some parameters of the Standard Model.\nFor instance, the future International Linear Collider (ILC) offers the opportunity\nto study the top quark with unprecedented accuracy [1, 2, 3]. To fully exploit the\npotential of an ILC in this respect, it is essential that a dedicated measurement of\nthe cross section for the production of a top antitop quark pair close to threshold\nis made. Such a threshold scan allows for an extremely precise measurement of\nthe top-quark mass and yields information on the top-quark width and the top-\nHiggs Yukawa coupling. The analogous threshold scan for the bb\u00af sector is also\nfundamental for non-relativistic sum rules [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and may lead to accurate\ndeterminations of the bottom quark mass [9].\nThe characteristic feature of heavy-quark pair production close to threshold is\nthe smallness of the relative velocity v of the heavy quarks in the centre of mass\nframe. This entails a hierarchy of scales \u00b5h \u226b \u00b5s \u226b \u00b5us where the hard scale \u00b5h\nis of the order of the heavy quark mass m, the soft scale \u00b5s \u223c mv is of the order\nof the typical momentum of the heavy quarks and the ultrasoft scale \u00b5us \u223c mv2\nis of the order of the typical kinetic energy of the heavy quarks. The presence\nof an additional small parameter can be exploited by systematically expanding\nin the strong coupling \u03b1s and v. Thus, in this context, a next-to-leading order\n(NLO) calculation takes into account all terms that are suppressed by either \u03b1s\nor v relative to the leading-order (LO) result, whereas a next-to-next-to-leading\norder (NNLO) calculation includes all terms suppressed by two powers of the\nsmall parameter \u03b1s \u223c v. The coefficients of this perturbative series contain large\nlogarithms log v. In order to improve the reliability of the calculation, these\nlogarithms should be resummed. Counting \u03b1 log v \u223c 1 in a NLO or NNLO\ncalculation produces a result of next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) or next-to-\nnext-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy respectively. There are no leading\nlogarithmic (LL) corrections, thus the LO and LL results are the same.\nThe expansion as well as the resummation of the logarithms can be organized\nmost efficiently by using an effective theory (for a review see Ref. [10]) approach.\nThis is done most conveniently by using the threshold expansion [11] that allows\nto separate the full result of an integral into contributions due to the various\nmodes. Denoting the generic integration momentum by k = (k0,k), the modes\nthat are relevant are: the hard mode k0 \u223c k \u223c \u00b5h, the soft mode k0 \u223c k \u223c\n\u00b5s, the potential mode k\n0 \u223c \u00b5us,k \u223c \u00b5s and the ultrasoft mode k0 \u223c k \u223c\n\u00b5us. The standard procedure is to first match QCD to non-relativistic QCD\n(NRQCD) [12] at the hard scale. This corresponds to integrating out the hard\n1\nmodes using the threshold expansion. The resulting theory is then matched to\npotential NRQCD (pNRQCD) [13, 14] by integrating out the soft modes and\npotential gluon modes. At this stage the theory consists of a non-relativistic\nquark pair interacting through potentials and ultrasoft gluons.\nWithin this framework NNLO calculations have been performed by several\ngroups (for a review in the case of the top quark see [3]) and quite a few partial\nresults needed for a NNNLO calculation have been obtained [15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21]. Moreover, the existence of the effective theory also provides the necessary\nframework on which to use renormalization group (RG) techniques. These allow\nto resum the large logarithms, log v, that appear as the ratio of the different\nscales appearing in the physical system: log \u00b5h\/\u00b5s and log\u00b5s\/\u00b5us. At present,\nthe situation is as follows. The computation of the heavy quarkonium spectrum\nis known with NNLL accuracy [22, 23] (for the hyperfine splitting at NNNLL\n[24, 25]). Inclusive electromagnetic decays of heavy quarkonium have been com-\nputed to NLL [26, 23] and for the spin-zero, spin-one ratio to NNLL [27]. In\nthe case of top-quark pair production a renormalization-group improved (RGI)\ncalculation is available [28, 29], using a somewhat different approach, referred to\nas vNRQCD [30] (in this theory, soft degrees of freedom are kept dynamical and\nthe matching from QCD to vNRQCD is carried out directly). However, so far,\nthere is no RGI calculation of heavy-quark pair production within the conven-\ntional pNRQCD approach. It is the main purpose of this work to close this gap\nand to provide the ingredients to perform such computations in the case of top\nand bottom-quark pair production. We will report results on tt\u00af production near\nthreshold, as well as elaborate on the computation of non-relativistic sum rules\npresented in Ref. [9]. Inclusive electromagnetic decays of heavy quarkonium will\nalso be considered. These analyses will be complete at NNLO and include the\ncomplete resummation of logarithms at NLL accuracy and some partial contri-\nbutions at NNLL.\nThe importance of higher order logarithms can be illustrated in the top quark\ncase. In the on-shell scheme, the NNLO corrections turned out to be much larger\nthan anticipated and, moreover, made the theoretical prediction very strongly\nscale dependent. If the cross section is expressed in terms of a threshold mass [31,\n32, 33] rather than the pole mass, the position of its peak is more stable and can\nbe predicted with a small theoretical error. This will allow to determine the top\nthreshold mass and ultimately the top MS-mass with a very small error. The\nsituation is much less favourable regarding the normalization of the cross section.\nThe corrections are huge and the scale dependence at NNLO is larger than at\nNLO, indicating that this quantity is not well under control at NNLO. This\naffects how accurately one may obtain the top-quark width and the top-Higgs\nYukawa coupling. It has been shown that the inclusion of the potentially large\nlog v terms is numerically very important and improves the situation regarding\nthe normalization of the cross section considerably [28, 29]. One of the aims of\n2\nthis paper is to compare with these results. We also investigate to what extent\nthe resummation of the logarithms is really required and to what extent the\nimprovement we observe in the RGI results is simply due to the partial inclusion of\nhigher-order terms. To do so we will produce \u201cNNNLO\u201d results by re-expanding\nfull RGI results and dropping terms that are beyond NNNLO. Of course, these\nresults are by no means complete at NNNLO, but they contain those NNNLO\nterms that are enhanced by a logarithm. To obtain an estimate of the importance\nof resummation, we then compare these \u201cNNNLO\u201d curves to the full RGI results.\nAs we will see, this partial inclusion of NNNLO terms does reproduce the bulk of\nthe RGI result except for rather small values of \u00b5s. In particular, in the case of\nthe top quark the difference between fully resummed and partial NNNLO results\nis small.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we present our formalism and\ndescribe how to perform a RGI calculations in pNRQCD. Some formulae and\ntechnical details of this section are relegated to the Appendix. In Section 3 we\napply these results to tt\u00af production near threshold. Section 4 contains the appli-\ncation to bottomonium non-relativistic sum rules and inclusive electromagnetic\ndecay widths. In the final section, we show our conclusions.\n2 Effective theory\nWithin pNRQCD, \u03c8 and \u03c7, the fields representing the non-relativistic quark and\nantiquark, interact through a potential and with dynamical ultrasoft gluons. It\nis well known that the leading Coulomb interaction is not suppressed and has to\nbe included in the LO Lagrangian which is given by\nL(0)pNRQCD = \u03c8\u2020\n(\ni\u22020 +\n\u22022\n2m\n)\n\u03c8 + \u03c7\u2020\n(\ni\u22020 \u2212 \u2202\n2\n2m\n)\n\u03c7 (1)\n+\n\u222b\nd3r\n(\n\u03c8\u2020T a\u03c8\n)(\n\u2212\u03b1s\nr\n) (\n\u03c7\u2020T a\u03c7\n)\n,\nwhere T a are the colour matrices and the strong coupling is understood to be\nevaluated at the soft scale, \u03b1s \u2261 \u03b1s(\u00b5s), unless explicitly indicated otherwise.\nSubleading effects are incorporated in the Lagrangian as corrections to the po-\ntential, \u03b4V , and as interactions of the heavy quarks with ultrasoft gluons. For\nfurther details we refer to Ref. [10]. If we restrict the accuracy of our analysis to\nNNLL, ultrasoft gluons do not appear as physical final states (thought their ef-\nfect is embedded in the RGI running of the matching coefficients of the potentials\nand currents). It follows that the number of particles is conserved (we only have\none heavy quark and one heavy antiquark) and the problem effectively becomes\nequivalent to do standard quantum mechanics perturbation theory. If we restrict\n3\nourselves to study the Hilbert space spanned by the heavy quark-antiquark sys-\ntem in the singlet colour sector we are lead to solve the following equation for\nthe associated Green function\n(H(r,p)\u2212E)G(r, r \u2032;E) = \u03b4(r\u2212 r \u2032) , (2)\nwhere\nH = Hc + \u03b4V (3)\nand\nHc =\np2\nm\n\u2212 CF \u03b1s\nr\n, (4)\nwith CF = (N\n2\nc \u22121)\/(2Nc) (where the colour factor Nc = 3). The explicit expres-\nsion of \u03b4V (the correction to the Coulomb potential) will be given afterwards.\nThe full Green function G can be solved iteratively in an expansion in the velocity\nby performing multiple insertions of \u03b4V . The LO solution is the Coulomb Green\nfunction Gc and we write\nG(r, r \u2032;E) = Gc(r, r\n\u2032;E) + \u03b4G(r, r \u2032;E) , (5)\nwhere\nGc(r, r\n\u2032;E) = \u3008r| 1\nHc \u2212 E |r\n\u2032\u3009 (6)\nand\n\u03b4G(r, r \u2032;E) = \u2212\u3008r| 1\nHc \u2212 E\u03b4V\n1\nHc \u2212 E |r\n\u2032\u3009+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (7)\nG(r, r \u2032;E) is related to the correlators that appear in the total cross section\nfor the production of a heavy quark pair, \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 QQ\u00af) with the centre of mass\nenergy\n\u221a\nq2 =\n\u221a\ns \u223c 2m. This is the key quantity we are interested in. The cross\nsection obtains contributions from \u03b3 and Z exchange. In order to simplify the\ndiscussion we ignore the Z exchange in what follows. The cross section can then\nbe written as\n\u03c3\u03b3(s) =\n4\u03c0\u03b12EM\n3 s\ne2QR(s) , (8)\nwhere eQ is the electric charge of the heavy quark, \u03b1EM the electromagnetic\ncoupling at the hard scale and the ratio R \u2261 \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 QQ\u00af)\/\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212)\nis expressed as a correlator of two heavy-quark vector currents j\u00b5(x) \u2261 Q\u00af\u03b3\u00b5Q(x)\nR(s) =\n4\u03c0\ns\nIm\n(\n\u2212i\n\u222b\nd4x eiq\u00b7x\u30080|T{j\u00b5(x) j\u00b5(0)}|0\u3009\n)\n. (9)\nIn order to compute this correlator, we first express the current in terms of the\nnon-relativistic two-component spinor fields \u03c8\u2020 and \u03c7,\nQ\u00af\u03b3\u00b5Q = c1\u03c7\n\u2020\u03c3i\u03c8 \u2212 d1\n6m2\n\u03c7\u2020\u03c3i (iD)2 \u03c8 + . . . , (10)\n4\nwhere the matching coefficients c1 and d1 are normalized to 1 at LO. By using\nthe equations of motion, Eq. (10) can also be written in the following way\nQ\u00af\u03b3\u00b5Q = c1\u03c7\n\u2020\u03c3i\u03c8 \u2212 d1\n6m\ni\u22020\n(\n\u03c7\u2020\u03c3i\u03c8\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (11)\nGiven the Lagrangian, we solve the corresponding Schro\u00a8dinger equation and\nultimately relate the imaginary part of the spin one Green function at the origin\nto R(s) by the equality\nR(E) =\n24\u03c0e2QNc\ns\n(\nc21 \u2212 c1d1\nE\n3m\n)\nImGs=1(0, 0;E) , (12)\nwhich is valid with NNLL accuracy (where E \u2261 \u221as \u2212 2m). We note that in\nevaluating R(E) we expand the expression in Eq. (12) and drop all terms that\nare beyond NNLO\/NNLL. In particular, we set c1 = 1 in the second term of the\nparenthesis.\nIn order to connect with the notation in Ref. [10], Eq. (12) can also be written\nas\nR(E) =\n18Nc\nm2\u03b12EM\nImGs=1(0, 0;E)\n[\nImfpNREM (\n3S1) + Img\npNR\nEM (\n3S1)\nE\nm\n]\n, (13)\nwith\nImfpNREM (\n3S1) =\n\u03c0e2Q\u03b1\n2\nEM\n3\nc21 ,\nImgpNREM (\n3S1) = \u2212\n\u03c0e2Q\u03b1\n2\nEM\n3\nc1\n(\nc1 +\n1\n3\nd1\n)\n. (14)\n2.1 Potential\nThe computation of G(0, 0;E) will lead to divergences. These divergences are\nregularized by performing all calculations in momentum space [34] and using\ndimensional regularisation in D = d + 1 = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb dimensions. Thus, the LO\nGreen function at the origin, Eq. (6), is understood as\nGc(r, r\n\u2032;E)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nr=r \u2032=0\n\u2261\n\u222b\nddp\n(2\u03c0)d\nddp \u2032\n(2\u03c0)d\nG\u02dcc(p,p\n\u2032;E) , (15)\nwhere G\u02dc denotes the Fourier transform of the Green function and the insertions,\nEq. (7), are to be evaluated as indicated in Eqs. (42) and (43). Using the threshold\nexpansion [11], the Fourier transform of the leading order Green function can be\n5\ncomputed as the sum of all ladder diagrams with the exchange of potential gluons\nbetween the heavy quarks and can be written as\nG\u02dcc(p,p\n\u2032;E) = (2\u03c0)d\u03b4(d) (p\u2212 p \u2032) \u22121\nE \u2212 p2\/m (16)\n+\n4\u03c0CF\u03b1s\n(E \u2212 p2\/m) (p\u2212 p \u2032)2 (E \u2212 p\u2032 2\/m) + finite ,\nwhere we have omitted terms that are finite if Eq. (16) is used in Eq. (15). The\nGreen function at the origin has a ultraviolet divergence that manifests itself as a\npole 1\/\u01eb. Using MS subtraction and then taking the limit \u01eb\u2192 0 we find [34, 35]\nGc(0, 0;E) = \u2212\u03b1sCF m\n2\n4\u03c0\n(\n1\n2\u03bb\n+\n1\n2\nlog\n\u22124mE\n\u00b52s\n\u2212 1\n2\n+ \u03b3E + \u03c8(1\u2212 \u03bb)\n)\n(17)\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 CF \u03b1s\/(2\n\u221a\n\u2212E\/m).\nHigher-order corrections to the Green function can be computed perturba-\ntively in two steps. First, the pNRQCD Lagrangian has to be determined to\nthe accuracy needed for the calculation. Second, higher-order corrections are\ncomputed using quantum mechanics perturbation theory, Eq. (7). Since some\nof the potentials generate singularities in insertions, we have to start from the\nNNLO potential computed in D dimensions [34]. It is essential to manipulate the\npotential consistently in D dimensions, since it allows us to use the same hard\nmatching coefficients defined in the MS-scheme obtained in Refs. [36, 37]. We\nthen bring the potential in a form that is more suitable to be combined with the\nRGI coefficients as presented in Ref. [22]. In particular we use\nCF\u03c0\u03b1s\nm2\n\u222b 4\u220f\ni=1\nddpi\n(2\u03c0)d\nG\u02dcc(p1,p2)\n(\np22 \u2212 p23\n(p2 \u2212 p3)2\n)2\nG\u02dcc(p3,p4) (18)\n=\nC2F\n2\n(1\u2212 2\u01eb)e\n\u01eb\u03b3E\u03932(1\n2\n\u2212 \u01eb)\u0393(1\n2\n+ \u01eb)\n\u03c03\/2 \u0393(1\u2212 2\u01eb) \u00d7\u222b 4\u220f\ni=1\nddpi\n(2\u03c0)d\nG\u02dcc(p1,p2)\n\u03c02\u03b12s \u00b5\n2\u01eb\ns\nm |p2 \u2212 p3|1+2\u01eb G\u02dcc(p3,p4)\nto eliminate the C2F term of the non-analytic potential 1\/q\n1+2\u01eb, present in Ref. [34].\nThe angular momentum operator is generalized to\nL2\n2\u03c0r3\n\u2192\n(\np2 \u2212 p\u2032 2\nq2\n)2\n\u2212 1 (19)\nto be compatible with D dimensional calculations in momentum space. Note that\nan insertion of this operator does not vanish even for an S-wave (see Eq. (86)),\n6\nbut the corresponding contribution could be absorbed into a redefinition of the\nmatching coefficient of the current.\nAt NNLL, the higher-order corrections to the D-dimensional potential in mo-\nmentum space, \u03b4V\u02dc , can then be written as\n\u03b4V\u02dc = \u2212 c4 p\n4\n4m3\n(2\u03c0)d\u03b4(d)(q)\u2212 4\u03c0CF\n\u03b1V\u02dcs\nq2\n+ 4\u03c0CF\n\u03b1s\nq2\n(20)\n\u2212CFCAD(1)s\n\u03c02 \u00b52\u01ebs\nmq1+2\u01eb\n(1\u2212 \u01eb)e\n\u01eb\u03b3E\u03932(1\n2\n\u2212 \u01eb)\u0393(1\n2\n+ \u01eb)\n\u03c03\/2\u0393(1\u2212 2\u01eb)\n\u2212 2\u03c0CFD\n(2)\n1,s\nm2\np2 + p\u2032 2\nq2\n+\n\u03c0CFD\n(2)\n2,s\nm2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n(\np2 \u2212 p\u2032 2\nq2\n)2\n\u2212 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n+\n3\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nd,s\nm2\n\u2212 4\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nS2,s\ndm2\n[Si1,S\nj\n1][S\ni\n2,S\nj\n2]\n+\n4\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nS12,s\ndm2\n[Si1,S\nr\n1][S\ni\n2,S\nj\n2]\n(\n\u03b4rj \u2212 d q\nrqj\nq2\n)\n\u2212 6\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nLS,s\nm2\npiqj\nq2\n(\n[Si1,S\nj\n1] + [S\ni\n2,S\nj\n2]\n)\n,\nwhere the colour factor CA = Nc, q = p\u2212 p\u2032 and \u03b1V\u02dcs contains the corrections to\nthe static potential up to NNLL [38, 39]. We will set c4 = 1 due to reparameter-\nization invariance. We would like to stress that the Wilson coefficients are not\ndimensionless in D 6= 4.\nThe non-relativistic reduction of the spin operators of the potential depends\non the operators used to single out the physical state we want to study. In our\ncase we are using the vector currents, which project to the spin-one state. We\nalso have to be careful to use the same conventions than those used to obtain the\nhard piece of the matching coefficients. This produces O(\u01eb) terms multiplying the\nS2 operator. In practise one can do the following replacement for the S2 operator\nwith S2 = 2\n\u2212 4\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nS2,s\ndm2\n[Si1,S\nj\n1][S\ni\n2,S\nj\n2]\u2192\nS2\n4\n2\u03c0CFD\n(2)\nS2,s\ndm2\n[\u2212(d \u2212 4)(d\u2212 1)] . (21)\nFor S-wave creation there is no contribution from the potentials proportional to\nthe S12 and L \u00b7 S operators.\nThe D-dimensional prescriptions used above are irrelevant for the computa-\ntion of the heavy quarkonium mass with NNLL accuracy, which reflects the fact\nthat the leading running of the Wilson coefficients is scheme independent. On\nthe other hand to specify the D-dimensional prescription of the potential is im-\nportant once they are introduced into divergent potential loops. This is relevant\n7\nif we want to obtain heavy quarkonium sum rules, or to compute the tt\u00af produc-\ntion near threshold with NNLL accuracy, and use computations obtained in other\nplaces for the hard matching coefficients. We would like to emphasize however\nthat we could have chosen a different prescription. This would have changed\nsome intermediate-step results but not the physical results.\nFinally, one should note that the potential above is not equal to the potential\nused in Ref. [34]. Nevertheless, they can be exactly related with each other by\nfield redefinitions (in four and D dimensions). In particular this means that the\nhard matching coefficients will be the same in both cases. This is actually what\nwe expected, since they simply correspond to the effects of the (integrated out)\nhard modes.\nThe RGI coefficients of the various potentials are known to the accuracy\nrequired for evaluating the Green function at NNLL [39, 22]. Note that the strong\ncoupling is included in the matching coefficients. Thus D(1)s \u2243 \u03b12s(1+ (\u03b1s log v)n)\nand D\n(2)\nX \u2243 \u03b1s(1 + (\u03b1s log v)n). For the Coulomb potential \u03b1V\u02dcs, the exact static\npotential at two loop [38] receives additional three-loop LL terms proportional to\n\u03b13sC\n3\nA(\u03b1s log v)\nn [39]. The explicit form of all matching coefficients can be found in\nRef. [22]. However, we have changed the basis of potentials compared to Ref. [22].\nThis affects the matching coefficient D\n(2)\nd,s , which now reads (\u00b5us = \u00b5\n2\ns\/\u00b5h)\nD\n(2)\nd,s(\u00b5us) =\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n3\n(2 + cD(\u00b5s)) +\n1\n3\u03c0\n(\ndvs(\u00b5s) +\n1\nCF\ndss(\u00b5s)\n)\n+\n32\n9\u03b20\n(\nCA\n2\n\u2212 CF\n)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s) log\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n]\n. (22)\nFor the other potentials, the expressions obtained for their Wilson coefficients in\nRef. [39, 22] hold, where one may also find the expressions for the RGI coefficients\n(cD, dvs, dss, . . .) of the NRQCD operators. We repeat them in the Appendix for\nease of reference.\nIn this paper we also include an additional contribution in \u03b4V\u02dc , the electro-\nmagnetic Coulomb term\n\u03b4V\u02dc \u2192 \u03b4V\u02dc \u2212 4\u03c0 e\n2\nQ \u03b1EM\nq2\n. (23)\nThis will give rise to a NLO term \u223c \u03b1EM\/v from single potential photon exchange\nand a NNLO term from double potential photon exchange. Strictly speaking, the\ncoupling in Eq. (23) should be evaluated at the soft scale and not at the hard\nscale, but this effect is beyond NNLL.\nThis completes all the corrections needed at the Lagrangian level for the\ncomputation of the imaginary part of the Green function with NNLL accuracy.\nWhat is left is to obtain the RGI expressions for cs and ds, where s = 0, 1 labels\n8\nthe spin. The matching coefficient cs is needed at NNLL whereas ds is only\nneeded at LL.\n2.2 Direct ultrasoft effects to cs and ds\nMost of the ultrasoft contribution to the running of cs and ds comes in a indirect\nway, through the running of the potentials in the anomalous dimensions of the\nRG equation. Nevertheless, there are some genuine ultrasoft effects that have not\nbeen considered so far. They are due to the appearance of some energy dependent\npotentials with the structure\n\u03b4Vus = (Hc \u2212 E)Z1\/2 , (24)\nwhere Z is the normalization correction to the heavy quarkonium propagator.\nTherefore, Z1\/2 corresponds to the normalization of the field that represents the\nheavy quarkonium. \u03b4Vus was not included in Eq. (20), as there only energy\nindependent potentials were considered. Its effects could be reabsorbed in field\nredefinitions of the fields that represent the heavy quarkonium. Therefore, they\nhave no consequences in the spectrum. Nevertheless, these field redefinitions\nchange the vertex interaction of the heavy quarkonium with photons producing\nchanges in cs and ds and they have to be considered in our computation. The\nleading logarithmic corrections to Z1\/2 were obtained in Eqs. (15\u201318) of Ref. [17]\n(for some partial results see also Ref. [16]). They produce corrections of order\n\u03b13s log\u03b1s. We can obtain the RGI expressions for them and generate terms of\norder \u03b1(n+3)s log\n(1+n) \u03b1s. Note that the running goes up to the soft scale because\none gets expressions of the form \u3008r = 0| log r|p\u3009 and the logarithm gets the scale\nof p. The corrections to the Green function due to Eq. (24) read\n\u03b4G1 =\n4\u03b12s\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n]\n1\nHc \u2212E\nC2ACF\n4\n, (25)\n\u03b4G2 =\n4\u03b1s\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n]{\n1\nmr\n,\n1\nHc \u2212 E\n}(\n2\n3\nC2F + CFCA\n)\n, (26)\n\u03b4G3 =\n4\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n]{\np2\nm2\n,\n1\nHc \u2212 E\n}\n2\n3\nCF . (27)\nThe correction coming from \u03b4G3 can be included in ds:\nds \u2192 ds + 16CF\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n]\n. (28)\nThe correction from \u03b4G2 is zero. Finally, the correction from \u03b4G1 could be ab-\nsorbed in cs:\ncs \u2192 cs + \u03b1\n2\ns\n2\nC2ACF\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n]\n. (29)\n9\nNote also that these changes are equivalent to a change in the NNLO and LO\nanomalous dimension of the RG equation describing the running of cs and ds\nrespectively.\n2.3 Running of ds\nThe LL running of ImgpNREM can be obtained in two steps. In the first step one\ncomputes its soft running. This has been done in Ref. [40, 41]. For the explicit\nresult see Eqs. (C.18,C.19) in Ref. [41]. The ultrasoft running can be obtained\nfrom Eq. (28). Adding everything together the LL running of ImgpNREM reads\nIm gpNREM (\n1S0)(\u00b5s) = (30)\nIm gpNREM (\n1S0)(\u00b5h)\u2212 16\n3\u03b20\nCF Im f\npNR\nEM (\n1S0)(\u00b5h) log\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\n]\n,\nIm gpNREM (\n3S1)(\u00b5s) = (31)\nIm gpNREM (\n3S1)(\u00b5h)\u2212 16\n3\u03b20\nCF Im f\npNR\nEM (\n3S1)(\u00b5h) log\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\n]\nThe last result agrees with the LL result obtained in Ref. [29]. For the matching\ncoefficient d1 as defined in Eq. (10), this entails\nd1(\u00b5us) = 1 +\n16CF\n\u03b20\nlog\n[\n\u03b1s(\u00b5us)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\n]\n. (32)\n2.4 Running of cs\nThe running of cs is not yet known with NNLL accuracy. It is dictated by the\nsolution of the RG equation (the LO anomalous dimension is zero)\n\u00b5s\nd\nd\u00b5s\nlog cs = \u03b3\nNLO\ncs + \u03b3\nNNLO\ncs + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (33)\nThe structure of the solution reads\ncs(\u00b5s) = cs(\u00b5h)e\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\u0393\nNLL\ncs\n(\u00b5s)+\u03b12s(\u00b5h)\u0393\nNNLL\ncs\n(\u00b5s)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . (34)\nExpressions for cs(\u00b5h) at two loops in the MS can be found in Ref. [36] for s = 1\nand (almost complete) in Ref. [37] for s = 0.\nThe expression for \u03b3NLOcs in the basis of potentials used in this paper reads\n\u03b3NLOcs = \u2212\nC2F\n4\n\u03b1s\n[\n\u03b1s +\n(\n2\u2212 4\n3\ns(s+ 1)\n)\nD\n(2)\nS2,s \u2212 3D(2)d,s + 4D(2)1,s\n]\n\u2212 CACF\n2\nD(1)s .\n(35)\n10\nThe expression of \u0393NLLcs is known [26, 23]. For \u0393\nNNLL\ncs only the spin-dependent\nterm is completely known [27]. Its contribution to the spin-one case reads\n\u03b4\u0393NNLLc1,SD(\u00b5s) = \u0393\nNNLL\nc\u02c6v +\n11\n72\nC2F\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b12s (\u00b5h)\nD\n(2)\nS2,s(\u00b5s)\u2212\n11\n72\nC2F , (36)\nwhere \u0393NNLLc\u02c6v corresponds to the result quoted in Ref. [27]. Note that we use a\ndifferent expression for the spin-dependent term than just \u0393NNLLc\u02c6v . The expres-\nsion above corresponds to the spin-dependent contribution to the vector current\nmatching coefficient in the MS scheme. Numerically this contribution is small\ncompared with others.\nBesides the spin-dependent correction, we have also incorporated the follow-\ning spin-independent corrections at NNLL order (to these corrections one obvi-\nously has to subtract the spin-dependent piece that has already been included in\n\u03b4\u0393NNLLc1,SD):\na) those that appear from the exponentiation of the NLL term and formally are\nNNLL (see Eq. (34)),\nb) Effects due to the two-loop beta running of \u03b1s. They produce the following\ncorrection:\n\u03b12s (\u00b5h)\u03b4\u0393\nNNLL\nc1,b\n(\u00b5s) =\n\u03b21\n2\u03b220\n\u222b \u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\nd\u03b1s\n\u03b1s\n\u03b3NLOcs (37)\n\u22122\u03c0\n\u03b20\n\u222b \u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\nd\u03b1s\n\u03b1s\n\u03b21\n\u2202\u03b1s(\u00b5\n2\ns\/\u00b5h)\n\u2202\u03b21\n\u2202\u03b3NLOcs\n\u2202\u03b1s(\u00b52s\/\u00b5h)\n.\nThe last term is generated from the fact that in the determination of \u0393NLLcs (\u00b5s),\nthe relation\n\u03b1s(\u00b5\n2\ns\/\u00b5h)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u2192 1\n(2\u2212 z\u03b20) , (38)\nwhere z\u03b20 = \u03b1s(\u00b5s)\/\u03b1s(\u00b5h), was used. This relation is only true at one loop and\nhas to be corrected by \u03b21 terms if a NNLL accuracy is demanded. The numerical\nimpact of these corrections is small.\nc) We have also incorporated the corrections proportional to a1, the one-loop log-\nindependent term, that appears in \u03b1Vs \u2243 \u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n(\n1 + \u03b1s\n4\u03c0\na1\n)\n. These corrections\ncan be deduced from the computation of the NLO anomalous dimension. They\nread\n\u03b12s (\u00b5h)\u03b4\u0393\nNNLL\nc1,c\n(\u00b5s) = \u2212 1\n2\u03b20\na1\n\u222b \u03b1s(\u00b5s)\n\u03b1s(\u00b5h)\nd\u03b1s\n\u03b1s\n(\n\u03b3NLOcs +\nCACF\n2\nD(1)s \u2212 C2F\n\u03b12s\n4\n)\n. (39)\nThe numerical impact of these corrections is small.\nFinally, the inclusion of the electromagnetic corrections produces some cor-\nrections to c1. Counting \u03b1EM \u223c \u03b12s, the one-loop exchange of a hard photon\n11\ncontributes at NNLO and is taken into account by\nc1(\u00b5h)\u2192 c1(\u00b5h)\u2212\n2 e2Q\u03b1EM\n\u03c0\n(40)\nfor the spin-one case, whereas for s = 0 we have\nc0(\u00b5h)\u2192 c0(\u00b5h)\u2212\ne2Q\u03b1EM\n\u03c0\n(\n5\n2\n\u2212 \u03c0\n2\n8\n)\n. (41)\n2.5 Green function\nOnce the RGI potential and current matching coefficients are available, we are in a\nposition to use standard quantum mechanics perturbation theory to compute the\nhigher-order corrections to Im[G(0, 0;E)] via insertions of the potentials. This\ncalculation has been done in momentum space using dimensional regularization.\nFor the terms suppressed by two powers of \u03b1s \u223c v in \u03b4V\u02dc , Eq.(20), it is sufficient\nto consider a single insertion,\n\u03b4G(0, 0;E) =\n\u222b 4\u220f\ni=1\nddpi\n(2\u03c0)d\nG\u02dcc(p1,p2;E) \u03b4V\u02dc (p2,p3) G\u02dcc(p3,p4;E) , (42)\nwhereas for terms suppressed by only a single power of \u03b1s \u223c v we have to compute\ndouble insertions as well,\n\u03b4G(0, 0;E) = (43)\u222b 6\u220f\ni=1\nddpi\n(2\u03c0)d\nG\u02dcc(p1,p2;E) \u03b4V\u02dc (p2,p3) G\u02dcc(p3,p4;E) \u03b4V\u02dc (p4,p5) G\u02dcc(p5,p6;E) .\nSince the RGI does not alter the structure of the interaction terms, the insertions\ncan be taken directly from Ref. [34]. In Appendix A we list the integrals that are\nneeded and present the explicit results obtained in Ref. [34].\nIn the calculation described so far, the on-shell scheme for the heavy quark\nmass has been implicitly assumed. In order to avoid the bad convergence be-\nhaviour inherent to this scheme, it is necessary to rewrite the expressions in\nterms of a threshold mass which is free of the renormalon ambiguity. In this\npaper we will consider the cases of the potential subtracted (PS) mass [32] and\nrenormalon subtracted (RS) mass [33]. We will use the difference between both\nschemes as an indication of the scheme dependence of our results.\n3 The case of the top quark\nIn this section we apply the previous results to the case of top-quark pair produc-\ntion near threshold at a future linear collider. Due to the large width \u0393t of the\n12\ntop quark there are no bound states and the toponium resonances are smeared,\nresulting in a smooth curve for the cross section with a broad peak as the rem-\nnant of the would-be 1S bound state. Using perturbation theory we can reliably\ncompute the cross section as a function of the energy [1]. This may lead to accu-\nrate determinations of the top mass and its total decay width by measuring the\nposition and normalization of the peak.\nThe tt\u00af pair will be dominantly produced via e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 , Z\u2217 \u2192 tt\u00af.

(47)\nHere ef is the charge for fermion f , T\nf\n3 is the third component of weak isospin,\n\u03b8W is the weak mixing angle, and mZ the mass of the Z. Here we will focus\non Rv, since it gives the dominant contribution and we are mainly interested in\nstudying the impact of the resummation of logarithms on the convergence and\nscale dependence of the perturbative expansion of Rv. A study of Ra can be\nfound in Ref. [29].\nSince \u0393t \u223c m\u03b1EM \u223c mv2 and the propagator of a potential heavy quark\nscales as v\u22122 the effects due to the width of the top quark are LO effects and\nhave to be taken into account by modifying the propagator E \u2212 p2\/(2m) \u2192\nE+ i\u0393t\u2212p2\/(2m). This amounts to replacing E \u2192 E+ i\u0393t in Eq. (1). As noted\nin Ref. [1], this is only correct at LO. Higher-order electroweak corrections have a\nmuch richer structure and it is not possible any longer to formulate the problem\n13\nin terms of a tt\u00af final state. In particular, at NNLO there are interference effects\n(between double and single resonant processes), QED radiation effects and non-\nfactorizable corrections (non-trivial interconnections between the decay products\nof the top quarks with the remainder of the process). Any consistent approach\nbeyond LO has to introduce additional operators with fields corresponding to the\nincoming electrons and the decay products of the top quarks, and link higher-\norder corrections of the \u03c8\u2020\u03c8 and \u03c7\u2020\u03c7 operators to three-point and higher-point\nvertices. Even though there is an effective theory framework available for sys-\ntematically taking into account these corrections [42], a full explicit calculation\nof electroweak effects at NNLO is still lacking. If we are interested in the total\ncross section only, the situation is somewhat simpler, since the non-factorizable\ncorrections cancel [43], and the replacement E \u2192 E + i\u0393t becomes correct with\nNLO accuracy. Furthermore, some of the electroweak corrections have be taken\ninto account by including them in the matching coefficients [44]. In this article\nwe restrict ourselves to the usual shift E \u2192 E + i\u0393t.\nIn Figure 1 the fixed-order results are compared to the RGI results obtained\nusing the procedure described above and using the PS mass with the subtraction\nscale \u00b5F required for the definition of the threshold mass set to 20 GeV. The\nplots were produced with an energy dependent soft scale \u00b52s = 4m\n\u221a\nE2 + \u03932t .\nIn order to obtain a first rough estimate of the theoretical uncertainty we show\nthe cross sections as bands obtained by variation of the soft scale in the region\n30 GeV \u2264 \u00b5s \u2264 80 GeV, where these numbers refer to the scale \u00b5s at E = 0.\nFor the hard and ultrasoft scale we take our default values \u00b5h = mPS = 175 GeV\nand \u00b5us = \u00b5\n2\ns\/\u00b5h. Our results are qualitative consistent, but not equal, to those\nobtained in Refs. [28, 29]. This agreement is not trivial, since the ingredients\nincluded in the NNLL analysis are different in ours and their computations. This\nmay indicate that, even if the NNLL evaluation is incomplete, the qualitative\nfeatures will hold in the complete result. We observe that the scale dependence\nis much reduced once the logarithms are taken into account and reduces from\nLL to NLL to NNLL. We also note that the size of the corrections decreases for\nthe RGI results, in particular the NNLL band is much closer to the NLL band.\nHowever, the NNLL band does not overlap with the NLL band, indicating that a\ntheoretical error estimate relying on the scale dependence alone is too optimistic.\nTherefore, we consider other possible source of errors in what follows.\nThe variation of the soft scale has been stopped at \u00b5s = 30 GeV which might\nseem to be a rather large value. In fact, the dependence of the normalization of\nthe peak as a function of \u00b5s is very smooth at NNLL, up to a value of \u00b5s \u223c 25 GeV,\nwhere it abruptly changes2. At NLL, already for \u00b5s \u223c 30 GeV there is a rather\nlarge variation of the normalization. This is illustrated in Figure 2 which shows\nthe \u00b5s dependence of the normalization of the peak at LO\/LL, NLO, NLL, NNLO\n2As we will see a similar pattern also appears for the bottomonium decays.\n14\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nEPS=\n\u008f!!!\ns-2 mPS\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nR\n=\n\u03a3\ntt\n\u0090\u03a3\n\u039c\n\u039c\n\u039cs= 30 - 80 GeV\nNLO\nLO\nNNLO\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nEPS=\n\u008f!!!\ns-2 mPS\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nR\n=\n\u03a3\ntt\n\u0090\u03a3\n\u039c\n\u039c\n\u039cs= 30 - 80 GeV\nNLL\nLL\nNNLL\nFigure 1: Threshold scan for tt\u00af using the PS mass, mPS(20GeV) = 175 GeV.

The soft scale is varied from\n\u00b5s=30 GeV to \u00b5s=80 GeV.\nand NNLL. As observed in Ref. [20] the situation for small soft scales may be\nremedied if multiple insertions of the Coulomb potential are taken into account.\nSince in our result these, formally, higher-order contributions are not taken into\naccount, we refrain from using scales \u00b5s \u2264 30 GeV and take \u00b5s = 40 GeV as\nour default value for the soft scale unless stated otherwise. The \u201cNNNLO\u201d result\nalso depicted in Figure 2 is obtained by re-expanding the full RGI result and\nkeeping only terms that are NNNLO, but dropping those of even higher order.\nThe difference between this result and the full RGI result is small except for\nscales \u00b5s \u2264 30 GeV, which is outside the range we use.\n15\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\u039cS\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nR\nM\nA\nX\nLL\u0090LO\nNLL\nNLO\nNNLL\nNNLO\n\"NNNLO\"\nFigure 2: The normalization of the peak of the RGI threshold cross section as a\nfunction of the soft scale \u00b5s.

The vertical dashed lines show the limits of variation used in Figure 1.\nWe also present a similar plot to show the scale dependence of the position\nof the peak in Figure 3. From this plot we can see that the NNLL resummation\nof logarithms significantly improves over the fixed-order NNLO evaluation. The\nscale dependence is reduced and also the convergence of the perturbative series\nis better, which is reflected in a smaller difference between the NLL and NNLL\n16\nresult versus the NLO and NNLO result (this also happens for the normalization\nof the total cross section). The difference between the \u201cNNNLO\u201d and NNLL curve\nis again very small for \u00b5s \u2265 30 GeV. From this plot we estimate the theoretical\nerror for the determination of the position of the peak (which is related to the\ndetermination of the top mass) to be of the order of 100 MeV.\nIn the fixed-order calculations the error is usually estimated from the soft-\nscale dependence, even though one may think that the dominant uncertainty\ncame from the magnitude of the correction. This is potentially more of a problem\nafter the resummation of logarithms, since the soft scale dependence is much less\nsevere. Therefore, we have to be more careful with other sources of uncertainties.\nIn particular, the missing ultrasoft contributions make it important to consider\nthe dependence on the other scales as well. Since they are correlated, we can\nonly vary \u00b5h together with \u00b5us and, thus, consider in Figure 4 the dependence\non the hard scale \u00b5h, setting \u00b5s = 40 GeV. Variation of the hard scale around\nits natural value \u00b5h = m by choosing 100 GeV \u2264 \u00b5h \u2264 250 GeV results in a\nscale dependence that is considerably larger than the soft scale dependence. We\nnote that this error is compatible with the magnitude of the difference between\nthe NLL and NNLL result. It is to be expected that the situation improves once\nall ultrasoft logarithms at NNLL are taken into account, but at this stage the\nrather large dependence of the cross section on \u00b5h has to be taken into account\nif a theoretical error is assigned. We also note that the dependence on \u00b5h only\nenters at NLL, thus the LL \u201cband\u201d in Figure 4 is simply a line.\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nEPS=\n\u008f!!!\ns-2 mPS\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nR\n=\n\u03a3\ntt\n\u0090\u03a3\n\u039c\n\u039c\n\u039ch= 100 - 250 GeV\nNLL\nLL\nNNLL\nFigure 4: Dependence of the tt\u00af threshold scan on the hard scale \u00b5h, using the PS mass.\nAt NNLL (NLL) the lower (upper) curve corresponds to \u00b5h = 250 GeV, whereas the\nupper (lower) curve corresponds to \u00b5h = 100 GeV.\nFinally we turn to Figure 5, where we display the effects due to the QED\n17\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nEPS=\n\u008f!!!\ns-2 mPS\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nR\n=\n\u03a3\ntt\n\u0090\u03a3\n\u039c\n\u039c\nLL\nNLL\nNNLL\nwith QED\nno QED\nFigure 5: Effects of the QED corrections to the tt\u00af threshold scan.

As\npreviously mentioned, the QED effects enter at NLL (thus there is no effect on the\nLL curve) and, compared to the desired accuracy (top quark mass measurement\nwith an error \u03b4m \u2264 100 MeV), they are large. They change the normalization\nby up to 10% and result in a shift in the extracted MS mass of up to 100 MeV,\nmaking it mandatory to include them. We note that we have not changed the\ndefinition of the PS mass. Thus the shifts shown in Figure 5 are physical effects\nand are not compensated if the PS mass is related to the MS mass.\nWe end this section by mentioning that all results presented here can be\nworked out in different threshold mass schemes. The qualitative features of the\nresults obtained are similar. We illustrate this point using the RS and RS\u2019 mass,\nagain setting \u00b5F = 20 GeV, and depict the threshold scan in Figure 6. Those\nplots, together with the plot in the PS scheme (lower panel in Figure 1), allow us\nto visualize the effect of using different threshold masses. In principle, the value\nof the threshold masses can run from being numerically close to the MS mass (but\nnot too close otherwise power counting is broken) to being numerically close to the\npole mass (but again not too close, otherwise the renormalon cancellation does not\ntake place). Within this allowed range, the threshold mass definitions numerically\ncloser to the MS mass have a smaller scale dependence. The price paid is that\nthe magnitude of the corrections (between different order in perturbation theory)\nis larger. For the specific threshold masses we use, the RS mass is the one closest\nto the MS mass whereas the RS\u2019 mass is closest to the pole mass. The PS mass\nis in the middle, though somewhat closer to the RS mass.

[9], where an\n19\naccurate determination of the bottom mass was obtained. Here we will consider\ninclusive electromagnetic decays (either to e+e\u2212 or to \u03b3\u03b3) of the bottomonium\nground state for which we will provide analytic formulae. These can be obtained\nfrom the results obtained for the non-relativistic Green function.

(52)\nFor completeness we also give the corrections to the wave function induced\nby the QED effect, Eq. (23).

Therefore, the decay of the pseudoscalar\nheavy quarkonium to two photons reads (d0 = d1)\n\u0393(\u03b7b(nS)\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (56)\n16\u03c0 CA\n[\n\u03b1EM e\n2\nQ\nM\u03b7b(nS)\n]2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6(s=0)n (0)\u2223\u2223\u22232\n{\nc0 \u2212 d0M\u03b7b(nS) \u2212 2m\n6m\n}2\n.\n21\nWe now perform a phenomenological analysis of these results. We restrict\nour analysis to the ground state of bottomonium. For the mass of the \u03b7b(1S),\nwe use the \u03a5(1S) mass, which is consistent to the order of interest. When we\nperform the numerical analysis, we expand the expressions (except for the overall\nfactor 1\/M2\u03a5(1S)\/\u03b7b(1S)) in Eqs. (48) and (56), and drop subleading corrections, in\norder to work strictly at LL, NLL (NLO) and NNLL (NNLO). In particular, this\napplies to the relativistic correction proportional to ds, where M\u03a5(1S)\/\u03b7b(1S) \u2212 2m\nis replaced by E\n(0)\n1 = \u2212mC2F\u03b12s\/4. The expressions above have been written\nin the pole scheme. Therefore, we change to a threshold scheme suitable for\nthe renormalon cancellation. We consider three possible schemes: the PS, the\nRS and the RS\u2019 scheme with the subtraction scale \u00b5F = 2 GeV. The numerical\nvalues of the bottom-quark mass to be used in the various schemes are take from\nRef. [9] and are given by mPS(2 GeV) = 4.515 GeV, mRS(2GeV) = 4.370 GeV,\nand mRS\u2032(2 GeV) = 4.750 GeV. Apart from the different numerical values for m\nto be used, the first change in the formulae appears (at most) at NNLL (NNLO)\nand is due to the shift\nm \u2192 mX(\u00b5f) + \u03b4mX(\u00b5f) (57)\n\u0393|m \u2192 \u0393|m\u2192mX + 3\n\u03b4mX\nmX\n\u0393(0) , (58)\nwhere mX represents a generic threshold mass, \u0393\n(0) is the decay width at lowest\norder and the shift in the mass \u03b4mX \u223c mv2. We notice that in the RS\u2019 scheme\n\u03b4mRS\u2032 = 0 at order mv\n2. Therefore, in this scheme, with the current precision\nof the calculation, the expressions for \u0393 are equivalent to those in the pole mass\nscheme.\n2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u039cs\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\n1.25\n1.5\n1.75\nG\nHU\n\u00ae\ne+\ne-\nL@\nke\nV\nD\nNNLL\nNNLO\n\"NNNLO\"\nNLL\nNLO\nLL\u0090LO\nFigure 7: Prediction for the \u03a5(1S) decay rate to e+e\u2212.

We work in the RS\u2019\nscheme.\nThe results for the vector and pseudoscalar decay can be found in Figure 7\nand Figure 8 respectively. From the numerical analysis, we find that the NNLL\ncorrections are huge, especially for the \u03b7b(1S)\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. The result we obtain\nfor this decay is compatible with the number obtained in Ref. [27]. This is some-\nwhat reassuring, since in that reference the ratio of the spin-one spin-zero decay\nwas considered, which was much more scale independent, as well as more conver-\ngent (yet still large) than for each of the decays themselves. This agreement can\nbe traced back to the fact that, for the spin-one decay, for which we can compare\nwith experiment, we find that the NNLL result improves the agreement with the\ndata. Overall, the resummation of logarithms always significantly improves over\nthe NNLO result, the scale dependence greatly improves, as well as the conver-\ngence of the series. On the other hand the problem of lack of convergence of the\nperturbative series is not really solved by the resummation of logarithms and it\nremains as an open issue. Due to the lack of convergence we refrain from giving\nnumbers (and assigning errors) for our analysis. In this respect we can not avoid\nto mention that, whereas the perturbative series in non-relativistic sum rules is\nsign-alternating, is not sign-alternating for the electromagnetic decays. Finally,\nwe would also like to remark the strong scale dependence that we observe at\nlow scales, which we believe to have the same origin than the one observed in tt\u00af\nproduction near threshold in the previous section.\nAs for the tt\u00af case the \u201cNNNLO\u201d curve, which contains the logarithmically\nenhanced NNNLO terms, follows closely the RGI curve up to a certain value of \u00b5S.\nFor smaller soft scales, the two curves start to deviate. However, in the bb\u00af case,\nthis deviation takes place already for reasonably large values of \u00b5s \u223c 2.5 GeV.\n23\nThis seems to suggest that resummation is rather more important in the bb\u00af case.\nHowever, we have to keep in mind that some logarithms at NNLL are still missing\nin our analysis and this might well affect this conclusion.\nWe also illustrate the dependence on the threshold mass evaluation in Fig-\nure 9. Compared with the uncertainty due to the lack of convergence of the\nperturbative series, the dependence on the threshold mass is negligible.\n2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u039cs\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\n1.25\n1.5\n1.75\nG\nHU\n\u00ae\ne+\ne-\nL@\nke\nV\nD\nRS\u2019\nPS\nRS\nNNLL\nNLL\nLL\nFigure 9: Prediction for the \u03a5(1S) decay rate to e+e\u2212 at LL, NLL and NNLL for the\nPS, RS and RS\u2019 mass.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have studied the effect of the resummation of logarithms for tt\u00af production\nnear threshold and inclusive electromagnetic decays of heavy quarkonium. This\nanalysis is complete at NNLO and includes the full resummation of logarithms\nat NLL accuracy and some partial contributions at NNLL accuracy.\nCompared with fixed-order computations the scale dependence and conver-\ngence of the perturbative series is greatly improved for both the position of the\npeak and the normalization of the total cross section of tt\u00af production near thresh-\nold. Nevertheless, we identify a possible source of a large scale dependence in the\nresult. While the result is very stable with respect to the variation of the soft\nscale \u00b5s it shows a considerably larger dependence on the hard scale \u00b5h. This\nmight well be related to the fact that the variation with respect to \u00b5h is corre-\nlated with the ultrasoft scale variation and the ultrasoft logarithms are not fully\nincluded at the NNLL level in our result. At present we estimate the remaining\n24\ntheoretical uncertainty of the normalization of the total cross section to be of the\norder of 10% and for the position of the peak of the order of 100 MeV, based\non the difference between the NLL and NNLL plots, as well as on the hard scale\ndependence. We note that this estimate of the theoretical error is somewhat\nlarger than in Ref. [45], due to the fact that we use more possible sources of the\ntheoretical error. We would like to remark that the use of the RGI provides us\nalso with a significantly improved determination of the top mass.\nFor the inclusive electromagnetic bottomonium decays the corrections are\neven larger than in the top case. In the case of the \u03a5(1S) \u2192 e+e\u2212, they bring\nthe final prediction into better agreement with experiment. For the \u03b7b \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3,\nthere is no experimental data at present and the presence of huge corrections\nmake a reliable theoretical prediction difficult.\nFinally we remark that the NNNLO part of the RGI results is numerically\nconsiderably more important than the even higher-order terms, in particular for\nthe top case. Thus it would be highly desirable to combine a full NNNLO eval-\nuation with a complete NNLL result in order to obtain a satisfactory theoretical\nprediction of heavy-quark pair production near threshold.\nAcknowledgments:\nThe work of A.P. was supported in part by a Distincio\u00b4 from the Generalitat\nde Catalunya, as well as by the contracts MEC FPA2004-04582-C02-01, CIRIT\n2005SGR-00564 and the EU network EURIDICE, HPRN-CT2002-00311.
