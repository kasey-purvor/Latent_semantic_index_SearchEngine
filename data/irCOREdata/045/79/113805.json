Corbett \nSurrey Morphology Group \ng.corbett@surrey.ac.uk \n \nDraft of 10 July 2009: comments very welcome. \nTo appear in Markedness in the Morphosemantics of \u03c6-Features (special issue of \nMorphology), edited by Jonathan Bobaljik, Uli Sauerland & Andrew Nevins \n1 Introduction \n \nFeatures are often presented as clean, neat and simple. This is understandable, since it \nis the contrast with the widely varying behaviour of lexical entries which gives the \nintuitive justification for features. But real feature systems are more complex. For \ninstance, linguists do not agree on how many case values Russian has, after years of \nstudy and argument. Yet Russian is no recent discovery, no obscurity pieced together \nfrom scraps of evidence. At least it is clear that Russian has a case feature. A whole \nfeature may be in question: for the Daghestanian language Archi the issue is whether \nit has person at all. More generally, there are many examples where we need to ask \nwhether we really have a proper feature, or feature value. We have to recognize that \nfeature systems vary according to how well founded they are, and here the work of \nthe Set-theoretical School is still of value. They also vary in how features and their \nvalues are distributed across the lexicon, sometimes in principled ways, sometimes \nalmost randomly.  \n \nIn order to analyse this murky area, the penumbra of feature systems, a canonical \napproach proves helpful (\u00a72). Having justified this approach, we consider a set of \nconverging criteria for canonical features and values (\u00a73). This gives us a point in the \ntheoretical space from which to calibrate the difficult instances. We ask whether the \nproblems we find are feature-specific or whether they recur in the different \nmorphosyntactic features (\u00a74). This leads to asking whether they can co-exist (\u00a75). \n                                                 \n1 This paper was first presented at the meeting on \u2018Markedness and \nUnderspecification in Morphology and Semantics\u2019, Harvard, February-March 2008. I \nam grateful to the participants, and particularly to David Pesetsky, the discussant, for \nuseful suggestions. A new version was given at the Max Planck Institute for \nEvolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, where there was also a good discussion: I thank \nJuliette Blevins, Bernard Comrie and Martin Haspelmath for the points they raised. I \nalso wish to thank Matthew Baerman, Dunstan Brown, Marina Chumakina, Anna \nKibort, Alison Long and Claire Turner for helpful comments on a draft.

We would propose a morphosyntactic feature number, \nwith the values singular and plural, without hesitation. Any alternative would make \nthe syntax highly redundant. Conversely, if we found a language in which the only \ntrace of number was a distinction between the equivalent of \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019, then any \ncase for a number feature would take some careful preparation. Of course, many \nlanguages fall between these two extremes. Yet we are perhaps too ready to treat \nthem as though they were instances of the first type. Morphosyntactic features, like \nnumber, often have a \u2018penumbra\u2019 where the data are not clear-cut, and we need to be \ncareful in our analysis.  \n \nI contend that each time a morphosyntactic feature is proposed in an analysis it needs \nto be argued for. If a parallel distinction proves useful in the semantic analysis, or the \nthe distinction is reflected in a purely morphological form, this is no more than \nsuggestive. We need an argument specifically for proposing a morphosyntactic \nfeature (and we may later wish to consider the degree of overlap between the different \nfeatures). One part of the argument will be the range of the feature across the lexicon: \na potential feature available to a few items is to be distinguished from a feature \navailable to the majority of items in the lexicon (thus case in English is not on a par \nwith case in Russian). It seems evident too that the analysis proposed should not \ndepend on geography. Yet that is what we find: Guugu Yimidhirr has been analysed \nas having split ergativity (simple morphology, complex syntax), because it is spoken \nin Australia. If it were spoken in Siberia it would have been analysed as having a \nmore complex case system, with simpler syntax. The paper will elucidate these \nissues, asking in particular whether they relate to individual features or apply more \ngenerally.  \n \nThose of us who work in typology tend to be attracted to clusterings of properties. \nAnd indeed, when we find features which are problematic, they are often problematic \nin more than one way. We need to see whether these are significant clusterings or \naccidental coincidences. One route towards that goal is to extend the theoretical space \nso that the clusters can be pulled apart: it turns out that the space is rather larger than \nis generally imagined. A way of anchoring this space is to take the type of instance \nwe started with \u2013 the indisputable instance of a feature. We can use it to establish the \nproperties of a canonical feature and its values, and then take it as the yardstick from \nwhich we measure the actual examples we find. And of course, the closer our \nexample is to being canonical, the easier it is to justify the use of a morphosyntactic \nfeature.  \n \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 3 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nThe aims of the paper are to elucidate the penumbras of features, to bring out the \nissues that require attention, to clarify some of the terminology on the way, and to \nestablish whether the morphosyntactic features are different or similar when we look \nat their less clear manifestations (their penumbras). In some instances non-canonical \nbehaviour has been given different terms for the different features, which perhaps \nleads us to expect that they are indeed different. This might be a useful pointer, or just \na case of the tail wagging the dog. \n \nAdopting a canonical approach means that we take definitions to their logical end \npoint, and this enables us to build theoretical spaces of possibilities. Only then do we \ninvestigate how this space is populated with real instances. Canonical instances are \nthose that match the canon: they are the best, clearest, the indisputable ones. Given \nthat they have to match up to a logically determined standard, they are unlikely to be \nfrequent. They are more likely to be rare, and may even be non-existent. This is not a \ndifficulty. The convergence of criteria fixes a canonical point from which the \nphenomena actually found can be calibrated. This approach has been worked out \nparticularly for inflectional morphology, as well as for syntax. Inflectional \nmorphology has been treated by Baerman, Brown & Corbett (2005: 27-35), Spencer \n(2005), Stump (2005, 2006), Corbett (2007a), Nikolaeva & Spencer (2008), Stump & \nFinkel (2008) and Thornton (2008). In syntax, agreement has occupied centre stage, \nfor instance in Corbett (2003, 2006), Comrie (2003), Evans (2003), Polinsky (2003), \nSeifart (2005: 156-74) and Suthar (2006: 178-98). A working bibliography of this \ngrowing body of research can be found at \nhttp:\/\/www.surrey.ac.uk\/LIS\/SMG\/CanonicalTypology\/index.htm . Most relevant to \nthe current issue is the discussion of morphosyntactic features in Corbett (2008). \nThere is a practical point to canonicity: since the examples nearest to canonical are \nthose which are \u2018indisputable\u2019, when defining a canonical use of a term we should be \nable to assume it covers the canonical core; in the ideal scenario, differences in use of \nterms can be specified in terms of how far out from the canonical point different \nresearchers allow particular terms to apply. \n \nThus canonical is not identical to prototypical (as normally used) since we have no \nrequirement to produce a canonical exemplar; rather we need to be able to define and \nso identify the canonical point. We should also not confuse canonicity with being \neasy to find: the example which is frequently cited may not be a fully canonical \ninstance of a phenomenon. \n \nWhy adopt this approach? We are tackling an area that is relatively new, where the \ndetailed work has been mainly on individual features rather than taking the broad \nview. Hence, effort devoted to the basic intellectual housekeeping is worthwhile: \n \n\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u2013 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \n\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0435, \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \n\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439 (2007: 29) \n \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n4 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nPrecision in research is characterized not primarily by the use of a \nmathematical apparatus but by the sharp definition of concepts, precluding \ndifferent interpretations. Gladkij (2007: 29); translation GGC \n \nSince we need to tackle the less clear cases in feature systems, not just the neat ones, \na canonical approach will prove valuable in this tricky area.  \n \n3 Canonical features and feature values \n \nIn brief, a canonical morphosyntactic feature is one that has robust formal marking \nand is manipulated or constrained by simple rules of syntax. These two general \nprinciples cover sets of criteria, and weakenings of the criteria define a space for \nsituating features that are \u2018less good\u2019, arguable or marginal, and for systematizing \nvarious earlier observations in the literature. \n \nWe now consider in more detail what a canonical morphosyntactic feature and its \nvalues would look like. We are focussing on the morphosyntactic features, strictly \ndefined (Corbett forthcoming b): that is, features which have a role in both \nmorphology and syntax. We shall start with case, since case has provoked interesting \nthinking on the topic, but we shall see that similar issues arise with the other features. \nWe need to look first at how case values are identified, in order then to investigate \nhow issues of canonicity relate to such case values. As a point of reference, we give \ntraditional paradigms of two types of Russian noun: \n \n(1)  Paradigm of two Russian nouns  \n \n \u017eurnal \u2018magazine\u2019 \n(inflectional class I) \nkomnata \u2018room\u2019  \n(inflectional class II) \n SINGULAR PLURAL SINGULAR PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE \u017eurnal \u017eurnaly komnata komnaty \nACCUSATIVE \u017eurnal \u017eurnaly komnatu komnaty \nGENITIVE \u017eurnala \u017eurnalov komnaty komnat \nDATIVE \u017eurnalu \u017eurnalam komnate komnatam \nINSTRUMENTAL \u017eurnalom \u017eurnalami komnatoj komnatami \nLOCATIVE \u017eurnale \u017eurnalax komnate komnatax \n \nThese are fully regular nouns: there are many thousands which inflect similarly.2 \nHowever, these nouns represent only two inflectional classes; there are two other \nmajor classes and several smaller subclasses (Corbett & Fraser 1993). Moreover, \nthere are some less secure case values, as we shall see in \u00a75. \n \n                                                 \n2 Animates like drug \u2018friend\u2019 will be discussed below (see (18)); these inflect like \n\u017eurnal \u2018magazine\u2019 but have the accusative syncretic with the genitive.  \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 5 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nThe case values proposed in (1) are relatively uncontroversial. But it is still worth \nasking, as Kolmogorov and the members of the Set-theoretical School did, how we \njustify such an analysis. For instance, given that \u017eurnal has the same forms, singular \nand plural, for the case values nominative and accusative, how do we justify claiming \nthere are two case values here? The method is set out in Zaliznjak (1967\/2002: 36-\n42), but see also Goddard (1982) and Comrie (1986, 1991). We start from the idea of \ncontexts. We take different syntactic contexts, such as ja vi\u017eu \u2026 \u2018I see \u2026\u2019, u menja \nnet \u2026 \u2018I haven\u2019t got a \u2026\u2019 and collate the forms which fit appropriately into these \ncontexts (by tradition, the contexts are the rows, and the items examined \u2013 nouns in \nthis instance \u2013 are arranged in columns, giving a table, as in (2)). \n \n(2) Establishing features and values: an example from Russian \n \n Item1 \n\u017eurnal \n\u2018magazine\u2019 \nItem2 \ngazeta \n\u2018newspaper\n\u2019 \nItem3 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \nContext1 \nNa stole le\u017eit \u2026 \n\u2018on table lies \u2026\u2019 \n\u017eurnal \n \ngazeta \n \n    \nContext2 \nOna dumaet o \u2026 \n\u2018she thinks about \n\u2026\u2019 \n\u017eurnale \n \ngazete \n \n    \nContext3 \nOna \u010ditaet \u2026 \n\u2018she reads \u2026\u2019 \n\u017eurnal \n \ngazetu \n \n \n    \n\u2026       \n\u2026       \n\u2026       \n \nIf we had only the evidence of the first noun \u017eurnal \u2018magazine\u2019, we would have to say \nthat the contexts 1 and 3 provided no evidence for different values. However, when \nwe put gazeta \u2018newspaper\u2019 in the same two contexts, this provides evidence for \ndistinct feature values (the traditional nominative and accusative). Hence we could \nclaim that the two different instances of \u017eurnal have different case values. If two \ncontexts produce exactly the same results for every item we test, then we can discard \none of the two contexts.  \n \nSo far this makes intuitive sense. However, the context must also be semantically \nconstrained. Thus the context ona pi\u0161et \u2026 \u2018she is writing \u2026\u2019 would allow both \npis\u00b4mo \u2018a letter\u2019 and karanda\u0161om \u2018with a pencil\u2019. We do not want to suggest these \ntwo nouns are in the same case, rather that the apparently single context is not \nadequate here. In the terms of Comrie (1986: 91) we also require identity of function. \nAnd more generally, we may require alternative contexts in order to allow natural \nreadings for different semantic classes of noun. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n6 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n \nThe procedure works well while we constrain the contexts (consciously or \nunconsciously). But suppose that like Zaliznjak we take the procedure seriously and \ninclude contexts like ja risuju svoju \u2026 \u2018I am drawing my own \u2026\u2019 ? Svoju \u2018one\u2019s \nown\u2019 is feminine, and there is no possible form of \u017eurnal \u2018magazine\u2019 that could fit \ninto this context, since it is masculine. The next step in the procedure is to eliminate \ncontexts like this one, which produce gaps in the table, provided that in all other \nrespects (i.e. apart from the gap) the context gives results which are identical to those \nof another context. This has the neat effect of allowing us to abstract away from the \nfeatures of number and gender while investigating case. For a fuller account see \nZaliznjak (1967\/2002: 36-42); the issues are well summarized in Blake (1994: 29-30), \nand the work of the Set-theoretical School is documented and evaluated by van \nHelden (1993). Quite often, the result of such an analysis is that the expected features \nand values are established, but that less clear instances emerge too, as we shall see.3  \n \nGiven this general approach to determining feature values, let us now consider a \ncanonical morphosyntactic feature and its values. There are several criteria, which we \ngroup under more general principles. Once the theoretical space is clear, we can \nidentify and better understand some interesting deviations from the canonical ideal. \nThe criteria for canonical features and values have been worked out previously \n(Corbett 2008). Going further, we find that those criteria give us a way for talking of \nvarious interesting phenomena described in the literature but not so far in this \nsystematic way. As we tackle them it is worth keeping in mind that some of the \nphenomena have been represented by a couple of well-known instances, which \nconfound more than one \u2018symptom\u2019; we shall try to separate these out.  \n \nThe first set of criteria, which is the set we shall concentrate on, is covered by this \ngeneral principle: \n \nPrinciple I:  Features and their values are clearly distinguished by formal means \n(and the clearer the formal means by which a feature or value is \ndistinguished, the more canonical that feature or value).  \n \nFormal means are \u2018clear\u2019 to the extent that they allow a transparent and regular \nmapping from form to function. The general point is straightforward: in the canonical \nsituation there is clear evidence for the feature and its values. Principle I covers four \nmore specific criteria.4 We sketch these four criteria, to give the general picture, and \nthen we consider each in greater detail below. \n \n                                                 \n3 It is worth remembering, as noted early, that features are not \u2018given\u2019 but have to be \nargued for and justified; see Pullum & Tiede (forthcoming) for clear demonstration of \nthis point.  \n4 By convention, principles are given Roman numerals, and criteria are labeled with \nArabic numerals.  \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 7 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n3.1 Criterion 1: Canonical features and their values have dedicated forms \n(are \u2018autonomous\u2019) \n \nIt is natural to assume that in order to postulate a feature, and its various values, we \nshould be able to point to at least one inflected form and to show that it can be \nexplained only in terms of the particular feature and value. For instance, in (1) above, \nthe form \u017eurnalom requires reference to case, and to the value instrumental: it cannot \nresult from any other specification. This is what Zaliznjak (1973: 69-74) and Mel\u00b4\u010duk \n(1986: 66-70) treat as \u2018autonomous\u2019. There is a question, however, as to what the \nstandard of comparison is. We might state the criterion in absolute terms, that is, we \nlook for some marker with a unique function. This would be appropriate if the \ninflectional morphology in question was also canonical (Corbett 2007a, \nforthcoming a). However, Zaliznjak and Mel\u00b4\u010duk both treat autonomy relative to a \nparticular lexeme; if for a given lexeme there is a unique form, then the feature value \nis autonomous.  \n \nThe following schema represents an autonomous feature value. \n \nSINGULAR PLURAL function \na d NOMINATIVE \na e ACCUSATIVE \nb e LOCATIVE \nc f DATIVE \n \nFig. 1: Autonomous feature values \n \nIn Figure 1, the realizations \u2018a\u2019, \u2018b\u2019 and so on represent fully inflected forms, and that \nlabelled \u2018b\u2019 uniquely marks the locative case value. Since it has one unique marker, \nthe locative is \u2018autonomous\u2019. The nominative and dative are similarly autonomous. \nThere is no form, however, which uniquely signals accusative case, which is therefore \nnon-autonomous. Compare the situation in Figure 2: \n \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n8 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nSINGULAR PLURAL function \nazg azgk\u2019 NOMINATIVE \n azg azgs ACCUSATIVE \nazgi azgs LOCATIVE \nazgi azgac\u2019 DATIVE \nClassical Armenian azg \u2018people\u2019 \n \nFig. 2: Non-autonomous case value \n \nIn this example (from Baerman 2002a) there is no unique form for the accusative; its \nforms are always syncretic. We still recognize an accusative case value, as is \nnecessary to maintain simple rules of syntax. At the same time, we recognize that it is \na less canonical feature value than the nominative or dative. We shall return to further \ninstances of non-autonomous values once we complete our sketch of the criteria for \ncanonicity. \n \n3.2 Criterion 2:  Canonical features and their values are uniquely \ndistinguished across other logically compatible features and their values \n \nIn the canonical situation, we can distinguish a feature and its values irrespective of \nother features and their values. In other words, we do not have to select particular \ncombinations: any of them will serve.5  \n \nConsider these examples from Italian, concentrating on the adjective. They show \ncanonical expression of number and gender, since the values of each can be uniquely \nidentified by the formal contrast, independently of the other: \n \n                                                 \n5 Zaliznjak (1973: 84-86) and Mel\u00b4\u010duk (1986: 61) talk of \u2018complete\u2019 versus \u2018partial\u2019 \ncase values, where a complete case value \u2018embraces all nouns of a language \nthroughout the whole paradigm\u2019, while a partial case value \u2018functions for a subset of \nthe nouns or for a subset of the paradigms only\u2019 (Mel\u00b4\u010duk 1986: 61). I separate out \nthe notions of embracing all relevant lexical items and that of applying throughout the \nparadigm in criteria 4 and 2 respectively.  \nGreville G.

What matters here is that any of the forms is sufficient to provide evidence \nfor a gender value and a number value. We have two number values and two gender \nvalues, each of which is autonomous. Contrast this with the cognate Russian \nadjective, in these examples (at this stage we consider a small part of the paradigm):  \n \nRussian \n(8) nov-yj \u017eurnal \n new-M.SG.NOM magazine(M)[SG.NOM] \n \u2018a new magazine\u2019 \n \n                                                 \n6 Glossing follows the Leipzig Glossing Rules. Inherent features are given in \nparentheses. Thus gender is glossed with the noun stem. While -a on the noun often \nimplies feminine gender by the assignment rules of Italian, this is not necessarily so, \nas with poet-a \u2018poet\u2019 (masculine); similarly -o often implies masculine, but this is not \nalways the case, as with mano \u2018hand\u2019 (feminine). These distinctions are important \nprecisely because we are dealing with features. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n10 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(9) nov-aja knig-a \n new-F.SG.NOM book(F)-SG.NOM \n \u2018a new book\u2019 \n \n(10) nov-oe pis\u00b4m-o \n new-N.SG.NOM letter(N)-SG.NOM \n \u2018a new letter\u2019 \n \n(11) nov-ye \u017eurnal-y \n new-PL.NOM magazine(M)-PL.NOM \n \u2018new magazines\u2019 \n \n(12) nov-ye knig-i \n new-PL.NOM book(F)-PL.NOM \n \u2018new books\u2019 \n \n(13) nov-ye pis\u00b4m-a \n new-PL.NOM letter(N)-PL.NOM \n \u2018new letters\u2019 \n \n(14) Gender and number in Russian adjectival forms (partial) \n \nGENDER NUMBER \n SINGULAR PLURAL \nMASCULINE novyj  \nFEMININE novaja novye \nNEUTER novoe  \n \nIn this instance, in order to establish the need for a gender feature at all, and to \nestablish the feature values, we need to look at forms which are singular. Russian \nclearly has gender, with three gender values, but its expression is less canonical than \nin Italian. Gender is not uniquely distinguished across number, as Criterion 2 \nrequires; rather it is distinguished in one number value only. \n \nPaying attention to the combination of features is a key part of the procedure for \ndefining features and their values (see Zaliznjak 1973: 59 on case). The \nnon-canonicity produced by various types of syncretism can produce difficult \nproblems, as we shall see. Indeed, Meyer (1994: 360) suggests that successful \nset-theoretic modelling of a feature in a given language requires full knowledge of all \nthe other features. Some put great store by the patterns of syncretism; the message of \nBaerman, Brown & Corbett\u2019s (2005) survey of syncretism is that this is unwise: the \nspecific patterns found in a few familiar examples are not representative of the \nsyncretisms discovered in a larger sample of the world\u2019s languages. \n \nDeviations with respect to criterion 2 give subvalues (including structured values). At \nthis stage we will restrict ourselves to one example of a subvalue, the animate \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 11 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nsubgender of Russian. This requires us to extend our coverage of Russian adjectives \nto include case: \n \n(15) Paradigm of the long form adjective novyj \u2018new\u2019 (traditional presentation) \n \n MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE novyj novaja novoe novye \nACCUSATIVE as NOM \/ GEN novuju novoe as NOM \/ GEN \nGENITIVE novogo novoj novogo novyx \nDATIVE novomu novoj novomu novym \nINSTRUMENTAL novym novoj(u) novym novymi \nLOCATIVE novom novoj novom novyx \n \nIn (15) the adjectival paradigm is given in traditional layout (a truly traditional \npresentation has the accusative ordered after the dative, but this obscures some of the \nregularity of the paradigm). There are many more cells than there are distinct \nphonological forms, owing to pervasive syncretisms. These syncretisms are brought \nout in (16) by reordering the gender and case values: \n \n(16) The paradigm of the long form adjective novyj \u2018new\u2019 (showing syncretisms) \n \n FEMININE NEUTER MASCULINE PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE novaja novoe novyj novye \nACCUSATIVE novuju  as NOM \/ GEN \nGENITIVE  novogo novyx \nLOCATIVE novoj novom  \nDATIVE  novomu novym \nINSTRUMENTAL novoj(u) novym novymi \n \nA first thing to notice is that looking at the case values we have added in here (as \ncompared with (14)) does not give any further differentiation for the three genders in \nthe plural. Second, the masculine and neuter are less well differentiated than the \nfeminine; they are identical in the oblique cases and so are less canonical in this \nrespect. Thus novoj is uniquely feminine while novogo could be masculine or neuter. \n(From the point of view of case, however, the feminine does not distinguish the \noblique cases, and the adjectival instrumental inflection -oju is now largely limited to \npoetry.) However, the most interesting of these syncretisms in the adjectival paradigm \nconcerns the accusative case. If we concentrate on the masculine singular (all the \nplurals behave in the same way too), then the form of the accusative is identical to the \nnominative for inanimates, as in (17), and identical to the genitive for animates, as in \n(18) and (19): \n \nRussian \n(17) ja vi\u017e-u star-yj dom \n I see-1SG old-M.INAN.SG.ACC house(M.INAN)[SG.ACC] \n \u2018I see an old house\u2019 \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n12 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n \n(18) ja vi\u017e-u star-ogo drug-a \n I see-1SG old-M.ANIM.SG.ACC friend(M.ANIM)-SG.ACC \n \u2018I see an old friend\u2019 \n \n(19) ja vi\u017e-u star-ogo dedu\u0161k-u \n I see-1SG old-M.ANIM.SG.ACC grandfather(M.ANIM)-SG.ACC \n \u2018I see (my) old grandfather\u2019 \n \nFor a formal account of this syncretism, which goes over paradigm boundaries, see \nCorbett & Fraser (1993), and for the typological implications see Baerman, Brown & \nCorbett (2005: 206-217). The key point is that we cannot claim that the animate form \nin (18) is simply a genitive, as we see if we look carefully at (19). The form of the \nnoun in (19) is uniquely accusative (distinct from both nominative and genitive), and \nthe form of agreeing adjective must also be accusative. Since the adjective carries the \nspecification \u2018accusative, masculine, and animate\u2019, and it has no unique form, its form \nis identical to the genitive.  \n \nAnimacy in Russian is a good illustration of why we need to separate out the different \ncriteria. On the one hand, the animacy distinction is severely limited in that it is found \nwithin just one case (and it is non-canonical in this respect). On the other hand, it is a \ncentral part of the system, affecting nouns, pronouns, almost all adjectives (those that \ncan occur in attributive function) and some numerals.  \n \nWe will consider further deviations in \u00a74 below. First we should complete our initial \npass through the criteria.  \n \n3.3 Criterion 3: Canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across relevant parts of speech (word classes) \n \nIn a sense it is true to say that German and English both have case, and indeed that \nGerman and English both have gender. However, these statements are somewhat \nmisleading. In German we have evidence for the case feature in articles, adjectives \nand pronouns (as well as limited evidence in nouns). For gender we have evidence in \narticles, adjectives and pronouns. In English the evidence for case and gender is \nrestricted to pronouns.7 Criterion 3 draws the distinction between the two systems, \nGerman being largely canonical here and English clearly not.  \n \n                                                 \n7 For those who do not accept pronominal gender systems, as discussed in Corbett \n(1991: 169-170), the gender example is not relevant here, but the argument from case \nis clear. Numerous further examples of case systems where the inventories of \ndifferent parts of speech differ can be found in Iggesen (2005). \n \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 13 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nA problem with criterion 3 gives a limited system. In the extreme instance, where \nthere is a distinction in only one part of speech, we have for instance a pronominal \ngender system or a pronominal case system. More interesting problems arise if the \nrealization of the values is not consistent. We return to that issue in \u00a74 below.  \n \n3.4 Criterion 4: Canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across lexemes within relevant parts of speech \n \nIn the canonical situation, given the morphosyntactic specification determined by the \nsyntax and the part of speech (word class) of the target, no more is required. Each \nmember of the part of speech marks the feature and all its values consistently. When \nmore information is required, that is, when not all members of the part of speech \nbehave consistently, deviations from the canonical situation may be seen in two \ndifferent ways: \n \nIn terms of level, the deviation may be in terms of the feature as a whole8 or only in \nterms of its values. In Macedonian, while most adjectives mark gender and number, \nsome mark number but do not mark gender (Friedman 1993: 266-267). That is, they \ndo not mark the feature gender; it is not simply that they fail to distinguish particular \nvalues. \n \n(20) Macedonian adjectives (Victor Friedman 1993: 266-267 and personal \ncommunication) \n \nMASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER PLURAL gloss \nnov nova novo novi new \nkasmetlija kasmetlii  lucky \ntaze fresh \n \nTypical native adjectives, like nov \u2018new\u2019, distinguish three genders and two numbers. \nAdjectives like kasmetlija \u2018lucky\u2019 agree in number but not in gender. On the other \nhand, taze \u2018fresh\u2019 and adjectives like it are indeclinable, they are unable to agree (see \nBaerman, Brown & Corbett 2005: 30-33). This means that we cannot necessarily say \nthat in a given language, adjectives (or whatever part of speech we have in mind) \nagree in particular features. There may be variation within the part of speech, so that \nwe need information about particular lexical items.  \n \nThis is an example of particular lexical items failing to mark a feature which the other \nmembers of the part of speech do mark. At the level of values consider these Latin \nadjectives: \n \n                                                 \n8 This criterion takes up \u2018lexical generality\u2019, as in Bybee (1985: 84-86), and goes \nfurther in clearly distinguishing its application to features and to their values. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n14 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(21) Latin adjectives of inflectional class 3 (singular) \n \nMASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER gloss \nacer acris acre sharp \nfacilis facilis facile easy \nvigil vigil vigil alert \n \nLatin has three gender values, as shown by many adjectives (though not in all of the \ncases). Adjectives belonging to the third inflectional class show various possibilities. \nAcer \u2018sharp\u2019, and others like it distinguish three gender values; adjectives like facilis \n\u2018easy\u2019, on the other hand, show no distinction between masculine and feminine. Vigil \n\u2018alert\u2019 and similar adjectives show no evidence of gender agreement in the \nnominative singular (though certain other forms distinguish neuter from the other \ngenders). \n \nIn terms of range, the deviation may affect different numbers of lexemes. The \ncanonical situation is that each lexeme marks the feature and its values. Deviations \nmay involve larger or smaller subclasses. We may find inflectional classes which \ndistinguish the particular feature and its values to varying degrees (as in point 1). \nThere may be subclasses at various levels, right down to individual lexical \nexceptions. The latter may be overdifferentiated (marking \u2018too many\u2019 distinctions \ncompared with the other members of their subclass) or they may show additional \nsyncretism and so show too few distinctions. For such situations, approaches like that \nof Network Morphology (as in Corbett & Fraser 1993 and Evans, Brown & Corbett \n2002), which rely on default inheritance, are helpful, since they readily capture \ngeneralizations which apply to large classes and are overridden by specifications \nwhich are more and more restricted, right down to the idiosyncrasies of individual \nwords. Moreover, this sort of deviation may be motivated to varying degrees. We \nmay find that a split is principled, as when a distinction is available for, say, all \nanimates. At the other extreme a distinction may be (synchronically) unprincipled, so \nthat each lexical item affected requires a special indication.  \n \nThe different types of non-canonicity of lexemes (such as marking too few or too \nmany distinctions) fall under a principle that we shall not discuss further here, namely \nthat canonical morphosyntactic features and their values are realized through \ncanonical inflectional morphology (Corbett forthcoming a). That principle is \nconcerned with canonicity from the point of view of the lexeme. At this point we are \ntaking the perspective of the feature and its values, suggesting that a canonical feature \nwill not be subject to the restrictions we are considering.  \n \nThe essential point of the fourth criterion, consistency across lexemes within relevant \nparts of speech, is that in the canonical situation it is sufficient to have a syntactic rule \n(of the type: in Polish \u2018the preposition ku \u2018towards\u2019 requires the dative\u2019) and the part \nof speech of the target (e.g. noun). Any requirement for additional information about \nthe particular lexeme(s) making up the target is non-canonical. \n \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 15 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nThe set-theoretical approach highlights the issues. Subsequent analysis is likely to \ninvolve a trade-off between regularities stated high in an inheritance tree and \nstatements that belong lower down either as sub-regularities, or even in particular \nlexical entries. Suppose that the set-theoretical approach to a particular language \ndemonstrates the need for both dative and instrumental case values; however, some \nnouns lack distinct forms. If such nouns are in a minority, we would probably favour \nan analysis in which the distinction is stated high up, and the particular items showing \nsyncretism are treated as an override to this general statement. However, if the nouns \nmaking the distinction are in the minority, we might propose a high-level \ngeneralization that the two forms are identical, with a lower level statement of distinct \nforms. In each instance, we need to make a special statement for a larger or smaller \ngroup of lexical items (this is taken up in the discussion of (29) and (30) below).  \n \nIn the examples of inconsistency across parts of speech discussed so far, the status of \nthe feature or feature value was not in doubt, since the problems involved relatively \nfew lexemes. If the problems affect a large number of lexemes, so as to threaten the \nstatus of the feature or feature values, we come to the issue of minor features and \nvalues, which we shall discuss below. \n \nSo far, then, we have surveyed Principle I: which concerns clear formal marking; we \nhave considered briefly the four criteria it covers. We should also have in mind \nPrinciple II, which requires that morphosyntactic features be manipulated or \nconstrained by simple rules of syntax. This is relevant to the current discussion since \ncertain non-canonical aspects of features could be avoided by baroque rules of syntax, \nif these were allowed. For instance, the case problem in Classical Armenian (Figures \n1 and 2) could be analysed away by claiming that transitive verbs take the nominative \nwith singular direct objects and the locative with plural direct objects. Such a rule, \nwhich I assume we should avoid, is clearly more complex than the rule stating that \ntransitive verbs take the accusative case of their object. It is this simpler rule which \nthen leads us to propose a non-autonomous case value. A general requirement of \nsimple syntax is that it should be \u2018morphology-free\u2019 (Zwicky 1996: 301, Corbett & \nBaerman 2006). Thus Principle II prevents us from shipping out our difficult \nexamples into the syntax. And third, as has already been mentioned, another \nperspective on canonical features and their values, which we shall not take further \nhere, is that they be realized by canonical inflectional morphology (see Corbett 2007b \nfor more on canonical inflection).9  \n \n4 Recurring types of non-canonical feature values \n \nLet us now go back and consider deviations from the four criteria (under Principle I) \nin more detail, asking in particular how they affect different features and their values. \n                                                 \n9 A very observant reader may wonder about fully canonical morphosyntactic features \nand how we could distinguish them. That is a good question, one whose answer is too \nlarge to fit here; an account is given in Corbett (forthcoming c). \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n16 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nRecall that Principle I is concerned with the morphological realization of the features. \nThere are two rather different types of prediction we might have. We could look at \nthe evident differences in the semantics and syntax of the different features and \nassume that these will be reflected in comparable differences in their morphology \n(specifically in the possibilities for the non-canonical behaviour we are investigating). \nAlternatively we might have in mind the arguments that morphology is autonomous, \nand predict that the realization of the different featural requirements specified by the \nsyntax will be similar across the features. In an intriguing fashion, as we shall see, \nissues of non-canonicity with feature values apply to the different features in \ncomparable ways, giving a picture closer to the second prediction. \n \nAt this stage we are concerned with the existence or not of all the types of non-\ncanonical behaviour which we have defined. To this end it makes sense to look \nwherever the chances are best: many languages were investigated, and no language \nwas excluded because of any sampling considerations. \n \n4.1 Criterion 1: Canonical features and their values have dedicated forms \n(are \u2018autonomous\u2019) \n \nThe problematic example we considered earlier (Figure 2) involved case. If we look \nmore abstractly at the relevant part of the paradigm, we have this schema (Figure 3). \n \nforms functions \na c I \n a d II \nb d III \n \nFig. 3: Non-autonomous feature value \n \nGiven this abstract schema, we can see an important aspect of the analysis: it can \napply equally to other features, since similar deviations from canonicity can be found \nwith them. Consider these data from Romanian: \nRomanian (Anca Sevcenco, personal communication) \n(22) student \u00eenalt (25) studen\u0163-i  \u00eenal\u0163-i \n student(M)[SG] tall[M.SG]  student(M)-PL tall-M.PL \n \u2018a tall (male) student\u2019  \u2018tall students\u2019 \n \n(23) scaun \u00eenalt (26) scaun-e \u00eenalt-e \n chair(N)[SG] tall[M.SG]  chair(N)-PL tall-F.PL \n \u2018a tall chair\u2019   \u2018tall chairs\u2019  \nGreville G.

There was a long debate about whether there \nare indeed two genders or three (see references in Corbett 2007c: 245-249). On the \none hand, nouns like scaun have no agreement forms which are used uniquely for \nthem; on the other, they do have a unique set of agreement requirements, as we see \nwhen we include the evidence of (25)-(27). In terms of agreement classes, there are \nclearly three, as in Figure 4.  \n \nSINGULAR PLURAL  \n\u00eenalt \u00eenal\u0163-i MASCULINE \n\u00eenalt \u00eenalt-e NEUTER \n\u00eenalt-\u0103 \u00eenalt-e FEMININE \nRomanian \u00eenalt \u2018tall\u2019  \n \nFig. 4: Non-autonomous gender value \n \nThe feature has been changed here \u2013 we are now dealing with gender \u2013 but the pattern \nis the one we have just seen (in Figure 3). In the singular in Romanian there is no \nevidence for a third, neuter gender, nor in the plural; it is the combination which gives \nthe third value. We recognize it as a gender value, but one that is less canonical than \nthe other two. A gender value of this type is sometimes known as \u2018genus alternans\u2019 \n(Igartua 2006); see this source and references there for discussion of the development \nof such instances in Indo-European. The important point for us is that this situation is \nfully analogous with that illustrated for case above. Therefore we do not need the \nterm \u2018genus alternans\u2019. Similarly, Corbett (1991: 164-165) introduced the term \n\u2018dependent target gender\u2019 for gender values realized only through syncretic forms; \nthis term too can be replaced by \u2018non-autonomous gender value\u2019, thus making the \nterminology consistent across the different features. While saying that Romanian has \nthree gender values, we want to distinguish it from languages like German, Russian \nor Tamil. It is typologically different, in various ways, including the fact that one of \nthe values is non-autonomous.  \n \nA clear instance of a non-autonomous person value is found in Old Nubian (a Nilo-\nSaharan language, with texts dating from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries, \naccording to Browne 2002: 1). Here are the key data (from Browne 2002: 50, see also \nBechhaus-Gerst 1996: 237, cited in Baerman, Brown & Corbett 2005: 75):  \n \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n18 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nSINGULAR      PLURAL  \ndollire dolliro 1 PERSON \ndollina dolliro 2 PERSON \ndollina dollirana 3 PERSON \nOld Nubian present indicative (doll- \u2018wish\u2019) \n \nFig. 5: Non-autonomous person value \n \nOld Nubian is cited here because it had regular syncretism, as in Figure 5, through its \nverbal paradigms. In Nobiin, its descendant, second person forms were innovated in \nsome parts of the verbal paradigm, so that the second person became autonomous.10  \n \nThus in general, problems with criterion 1 give non-autonomous values. We shall \nsee a further example for case when we consider the Russian second genitive below, \nthough the effect there is less striking. A more dramatic example involving person is \nfound in Archi. It may seem obvious that we can argue for a feature only if at least \ntwo values are autonomous (so there is a distinction in form). However, even that is \nnot clear-cut; see Chumakina, Kibort & Corbett (2007) where it is argued that a \nperson feature is required in the grammar of Archi, even though there is no dedicated \nform to support it. \n \n4.2 Criterion 2:  Canonical features and their values are uniquely \ndistinguished across other logically compatible features and their values \n \nProblems with criterion 2 give sub-values. For example, see this definition for \nsubgender (Corbett 1991: 163) \n \nSubgenders are agreement classes which control minimally different \nsets of agreements, that is, agreements differing for at most a small \nproportion of the morphosyntactic forms of any of the agreement \ntargets. \n                                                 \n10 Other instances of non-autonomous person found to date are typically less \nsystematic, varying according to verbal categories such as tense, aspect and mood. \nThus in the Omotic language Benchnon, the second person is non-autonomous in the \nindicative final and in the medial forms, but has unique forms in polar question forms \n(Rapold 2007: 70-71). In Amahuaca (Panoan) the second person is again non-\nautonomous, with the syncretisms varying according to tense (Baerman 2002b, citing \nSparing-Ch\u00e1vez 1998: 449). And Marc-Olivier Hinzelin points out (personal \ncommunication) that certain Francoproven\u00e7al varieties show relevant patterns, but \nonly in particular tense-mood combinations: see Fankhauser (1911: 151-153) for \nexamples.  \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 19 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n \nThere is a detailed account of Serbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian (Corbett 1991: 161-165) to \nshow what is covered by \u2018minimally different\u2019. The intuition behind the definition is \nthat in larger feature systems there can be distinctions which are minimal, when \ncompared to those of other feature values, and these are to be specifically noted.11 \n \nSub-values often have other non-canonical behaviours. For instance, they may be \nnon-autonomous too (Corbett 1991: 164, where the term used was \u2018dependent\u2019), but \nthis is not required (Brown 1998b: 198); these two types of non-canonical behaviour \nmay co-occur but are not bound to do so. Sub-values may also not be distributed \nacross other relevant parts of speech. If we are to extend the notion to other \nmorphosyntactic features, it is the notion of minimal difference that is relevant. Thus \nBrown (2007) treats the Russian second locative as a subcase. There are also possible \ninstances of a subnumber, where the dual is restricted to the first person. However, \nsuch instances are open to other interpretations. A clearer instance is found in Biak \n(an Austronesian language, of the South Halmahera-West New Guinea subgroup, \nspoken on the islands of Biak and Numfor and on several small islands near the Bird's \nHead, and along part of the north coast of the Bird\u2019s Head), described by Steinhauer \n(1985) and discussed also in Cysouw (2003: 201-202, including footnote 12). We \nfollow the most recent source, van den Heuvel (2006): \n \n(28) The independent personal pronouns of Biak (van den Heuvel 2006: 66) \n \n                             NUMBER  \nPERSON  \nGENDER \nSINGULAR DUAL PAUCAL PLURAL \nEXCLUSIVE aya nu inko \n1 \nINCLUSIVE ___ ku ko \n         2 aw mu mko \nANIMATE si \n3 \nINANIMATE \ni su sko \nna \n \nAs can be seen, Biak has a paucal number, but in the third person only. These features \nand values are not restricted to the independent pronoun (as in (28)); their use extends \nto the pronominal affixes and pronominal articles. We may view this as an instance of \na sub-number. \n \nThe instances presented so far have all involved a restriction according to a different \nfeature\/value (for instance, a number value restricted by person, as in Biak). Now we \n                                                 \n11 We need the notion of comparison within the paradigm: we do not want, for \ninstance, to say that because they are distinguished in one number only the Russian \ngenders are subgenders (see examples (8)-(13) above); particularly since the \nsyncretism fits into a widespread typological pattern (Greenberg 1963). \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n20 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nturn to instances where the restriction is to a limited number of values \u2013 usually one \u2013 \nwithin the same feature. Such instances are sometimes treated as structured values.  \n \nOne such treatment is Brown\u2019s (2007) account of the Russian second locative. If we \nlook back at the basic system given in (1), we need to add that there is an additional \nvalue, the second locative, which is non-canonical in more than one respect. What \nconcerns us here is that it is distinct for a small proportion of the available paradigm \ncells, namely within the locative singular only. That is, there is no distinction in the \nplural, and where there is a distinction it is within the locative only. There is a handful \nof prepositions which take the locative, and just two of them (v \u2018in\u2019 and na \u2018on\u2019) \nrequire the second locative, as in v sad\u00fa (second locative) \u2018in the garden\u2019, in contrast \nwith o sade (ordinary locative) \u2018concerning the garden\u2019. When it is available (and it is \nalso non-canonical in that few items have a distinct form, see \u00a74.4), the second \nlocative is thus a subdivision of the locative. \n \nThis sort of non-canonicity has a satisfying account. Brown\u2019s solution is to treat the \nsecond locative as a \u2018structured\u2019 case (1998a: 198-200). In his Network Morphology \nanalysis, which relies heavily on the notion of defaults, the default realization of the \nsecond locative will be as the normal locative. This default is overridden for the \nrelative few nouns with a distinct second locative. Inflectional morphology in this \nmodel is specified according to ordered paths, where more specific information is \nordered after more general. For instance the specification of the ordinary locative \nsingular may be given as:12 \n \n(29) <singular locative> \n \nThis ordering is justified by the fact that some nouns have different stems for singular \nand plural (and these are specified within the lexical entry), while none have a special \nstem for locative. Then the specification of the second locative is an extension of this \npath: \n \n(30) <singular locative locative2> \n \nThe effect is that when the second locative is in principle required by the preposition, \nthen: (a) if the noun has a form matching the specification (30) completely, a distinct \nsecond locative, this is the appropriate form; (b) if not, by default, the closest \nmatching path specifies the form, and that path is as in (29), giving a normal locative. \nThis latter will always occur with adjectives, which Brown covers elegantly with no \nextra machinery. The analysis in effect says that all nouns have an appropriate \nrealization for second locative (if the syntax requires it, there is an appropriate form, \nusually the ordinary locative), but very few nouns really do (that is, few nouns have a \ndistinct morphological form for the second locative). As far as the main issue here is \n                                                 \n12 Brown (1998a, 2007) uses \u2018prepositional\u2019 and \u2018locative\u2019 rather than \u2018locative\u2019 and \n\u2018locative2\u2019; I have retained locative and locative2 for consistency. \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 21 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nconcerned, this approach clearly treats the second locative as a subcase of the \nlocative, as the ordered path in (30) shows.  \n \nTwo important points need to be made here. First, Brown\u2019s solution for this particular \ntype of non-canonicity is not just an elegant idea. It is worked out as a full \nimplementation within Network Morphology (one of the inferential-realizational \napproaches to inflectional morphology). Brown\u2019s implementation gives the right \noutcomes and others can test it to ensure that it is indeed a valid analysis (the \nfragment is provided in Brown 1998a). And second, it develops an idea found in \nComrie (1991: 102), that of having a hierarchical feature analysis for the second \ncase,13 one which captures the specific nature of these case values and does not \ninvolve invoking other artificial features for other case values.  \n \nWe may think of clusivity in similar terms. On one analysis the distinction is not \nlogically compatible with the singular; otherwise it can be found across all values of \nother features, and yet it is restricted to occurring within person. See, for instance, the \nsystem of Belhare (a language of the Kiranti group within Sino-Tibetan, spoken in \nNepal) as Bickel & Nichols present it (2005: 51): \n \n(31) Belhare (Bickel & Nichols 2005: 51): intransitive verb forms \n \n  SINGULAR DUAL PLURAL \n1 EXCLUSIVE -\u014ba -chi-\u014ba -i-\u014ba \n INCLUSIVE ___ -chi -i \n2  -ga -chi-ga -i-ga \n3  \u00d8- N-\u2026-chi N- \n \nHere we see a clear marker of the exclusive -\u014ba, while inclusive remains without a \nmarker; clusivity is restricted to the first person. Note, however, that not all would \nagree with this analysis of clusivity; see for instance Daniel (2005) and the review by \nBobaljik (2008). \n \nAnother example is provided by Sursurunga, which is convincing because of the size \nof the number system. The data are from Hutchisson (1986, and personal \ncommunications). Sursurunga has some 4 000 speakers in southern New Ireland. It is \none of the South New Ireland\/West Solomonic languages, which form part of the \nNew Ireland Network, that being a branch of Melanesian, within Oceanic, in turn part \nof Austronesian (Ross 1988: 258). The meanings of the values are discussed in \nCorbett (2000: 26-29):  \n \n                                                 \n13 Brown discusses the locative and Comrie the genitive, but in both instances the \naccount generalizes to the other second case. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n22 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(32) The emphatic pronouns in Sursurunga \n \n SINGULAR DUAL PAUCAL  GREATER \nPAUCAL \nPLURAL \n1 EXCLUSIVE iau giur gimtul  gimhat gim \n1 INCLUSIVE ___ gitar gittul githat git \n2 i\u00e1u14 gaur gamtul  gamhat gam \n3 -i\/on\/\u00e1i diar ditul dihat di \n \nHere again we see clusivity running through the first person, in this instance through \nfour values of number. For those who treat clusivity differently, the sub-values of \nperson are rather to be looked for in the various proposed \u2018fourth persons\u2019, which \nmay be analysed as sub-values of the third person.  \n \nTo sum up, problems with criterion 2 lead to sub-values, restricted across other \nfeature values or within their own feature. Given the number of values available, \nsub-values are prevalent when case is involved, since this gives more possibilities for \ndiscrepancies between proportions of the paradigm in which different feature values \nare realized distinctly. The clearest instances are those where there is a clear contrast \nbetween a distinction drawn right through a paradigm and another where there is only \na minimal difference. Of course, there are many instances between the two extremes. \nIn the canonical situation, the value is uniquely distinguished across all other \nlogically compatible features and their values; in the least canonical situation, the \nvalue is distinguished minimally, and we recognize increasing non-canonical \npossibilities between the two extremes.  \n \n4.3 Criterion 3: Canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across relevant parts of speech \n \nAs we saw earlier, systems which are non-canonical because of a problem with \ncriterion 3, where only one part of speech has a particular distinction, give limited \nsystems. We now look at more interesting examples where the distinctions are not \nconsistent across parts of speech. (We mean that the distinctions available are \ndifferent, not that \u2018inconsistent\u2019 choices can be made in particular instances, as with \nhybrid nouns, for example.) \n \nIn the easy instances, one part of speech has values which represent a collapsing of \nthe values available to the other. In the least problematic instances, the distribution is \nprincipled, for instance, it is according to the Animacy Hierarchy. Thus in the number \nfeature in Yimas, pronouns have singular\/dual\/paucal\/plural, but nouns lack the \n                                                 \n14 \u00e1 is used to indicate schwa; this is the preferred form according to Hutchisson \n(personal communication), rather than 'a, as in Hutchisson (1986: 20fn7). Other \nchanges from the 1986 paper, like -hat for -at in the greater paucal, are based on \npersonal communications. \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 23 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \npaucal (William Foley 1986: 74, 86-87, 132-133; 1991 216-225, and personal \ncommunications, reported in Corbett 2000: 92, 120-121). Since personal pronouns \ncome higher on the Animacy Hierarchy, Yimas conforms to a general pattern Yimas \nconforms to a general pattern, namely that there is greater differentiation higher on \nthe hierarchy. \n \nWe also find collapsing of values in a less principled way; the Russian second \nlocative discussed above is a distinction available to the noun but not to the adjective \n(where the two locatives are marked identically). There are much more challenging \ninstances, such as Bayso (Cushitic) where nouns and verbs both mark nominal \nnumber, but where the mapping of values between the two is anything but \nstraightforward (Corbett 2000: 127-129, 181-183).  \n \nParticularly interesting are the systems in which the combination of possibilities on \ndifferent parts of speech gives rise to additional values. We begin with gender, where \nsuch systems have been called combined gender systems (Corbett 1991: 184). Few \nexamples have been found; consider these data from Mba. Languages of the Mba \ngroup (Ubangian branch of Niger-Kordofanian; data from Tucker & Bryan 1966: 110, \n114-23, 131-40; Pasch 1985: 69-71; 1986) have a combination of gender systems \nsimilar to the Bantu type (somewhat reduced), and a second system distinguishing up \nto four members: male human, female human, animal and inanimate. Most interesting \nof the group is Mba itself, discussed in detail in Corbett (1991: 185-188). The key \ndata are presented in (33); the situation is somewhat more complex but the essential \npoints are evident here. \n \n(33) Consistent agreement patterns in Mba \n \nattributive agreement \nsingular \nagreement \nplural \nagreement \npronoun \/ \noptional \nagreement \ngender combined gender \nw y nd\u00e9 I  1\/2  male personal \nw y \u0253\u0131 \u030d II  1\/2  animate \nw y \u00d8 III  1\/2  inanimate \nl s \u00d8 IV  3\/4  inanimate \nk z \u0253\u0131 \u030d V  5\/6  animate \nk z \u00d8 VI  5\/6  inanimate \ng y nd\u00e9 VII  7\/2  male personal \ng y \u0253\u0131 \u030d VIII  7\/2  animate \ng y \u00d8 IX  7\/2  inanimate \nny z \u00d8 X  9\/6  inanimate \nm y \u00d8 XI 11\/2 inanimate \n \nThe first two columns give the attributive agreement markers (the Bantu type), from \nwhich we set up agreement classes 1\/2, 3\/4, 5\/6, 7\/2, 9\/6, 11\/2. Note that not all the \nnouns in these proposed agreement classes behave identically, since there is the \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n24 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nfurther set of distinctions found in the pronoun (which also serves optionally as an \nagreement marker), shown in column three Now the fact that different agreement \ntargets behave differently is not in itself so unusual. Normally, however, when there \nis a difference, the distinctions made on one target are simply a subset of those made \non the other (and there can therefore be a simple rule of agreement); this would be the \n\u2018collapsing\u2019 noted above. Mba is different, since the attributive modifier and the \npronoun\/optional agreement marker seem to be operating according to different \nsystems.  \n \nAt this point there are two ways forward. One is the way consistent with the approach \nof the Set-theoretical School. There are two contexts (attributive agreement and \npronoun \/ optional agreement), and only those nouns which control the same set of \nagreements in all contexts have the same gender value. There are eleven possibilities, \nhence eleven gender values, as given in column four. (The combinations on which \nthey are based are given in column five.) The alternative is to say that the items in \ncolumn five are not just useful mnemonics for the eleven genders, rather they reflect \nthe existence of two co-existing systems.  \n \nThere are three considerations pointing towards the first alternative (combining the \ngender values as a single system, as in column four). First, we do not get all the \npossibilities from the two types of agreement; instead of eighteen theoretical \npossibilities we actually find eleven. Second, cross-linguistically we find one set of \nvalues for each morphosyntactic feature; relaxing that constraint would allow for a \nwide range of possibilities which appear not to occur. And third, Principle II requires \nmorphosyntactic features to be manipulated or constrained by simple rules of syntax; \nif we require two different agreement rules, both to handle gender and number \nagreement, this is not simple syntax.  \n \nWhichever way we analyse the Mba data, by complicating the gender specification of \nnouns or by complicating the rules of agreement, it is clear that we do not have a \ncanonical morphosyntactic gender feature, since its values are not distributed \nconsistently across the relevant parts of speech. We should then ask whether there is \nanything similar to be found in the other morphosyntactic features. Consider these \ndata on number from Mele-Fila (Corbett 2000: 35, 69). Mele-Fila is an Eastern \nOceanic language spoken on Vanuatu. The data are from Ross Clark (personal \ncommunications). The article makes a three-way number distinction which, taken on \nits own, would give a singular-paucal-plural system. The forms for the noun nuaane \n\u2018old man\u2019 are given in (34). The underlying form of the plural article is \/a\/, but before \nnouns of more than two morae, the form is zero. \n \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 25 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(34) Number contrasts in Mele-Fila (data from Ross Clark) \n \narticle distinctions SINGULAR PAUCAL PLURAL \narticle plus noun \n    (\u2018old man\u2019) \nt-nuaane ru nuaane nuaane \npronoun \ndistinctions \nSINGULAR DUAL PLURAL GREATER \nPLURAL \npronoun aia raaua raateu reafa \n\u2018constructed\u2019 \nnumber \nSINGULAR DUAL PAUCAL PLURAL GREATER \nPLURAL \n \nThe pronoun makes four distinctions rather than three, and these do not map simply \nonto those of the article. The pronoun distinguishes singular and dual forms, and then \nthe remaining space is divided between a plural and a greater (global) plural. The dual \npronoun is appropriate only for some cases where the paucal article would be used. \nOn the other hand, the pronoun raateu covers the remaining area of the paucal article, \nbut splits the range of the plural article, the part left over being covered by reafa. If \nwe follow the set-theoretical approach, we combine the two systems and we have five \nnumber distinctions, as shown in the last line of the table. The alternative is to have \nmore complex syntactic rules. In either case the system is non-canonical, in a way \nanalogous to the issue in the gender system of Mba. Other systems where different \nelements combine to give the full range of number distinctions include Hopi and Zuni \n(Corbett 2000: 169-171), see also Bliss (2005) on Hopi. Note however that sometimes \nonly a part of the system works this way; thus in Hopi only the pronouns are affected \nin combination with the verb, while the noun has full marking. Systems like that of \nMele-Fila were termed \u2018constructed number\u2019 systems in Corbett (2000). Once their \naffinity to the combined gender systems is recognized they could better be termed \n\u2018combined number systems\u2019.  \n \nLet us move on to case. Consider the Pama-Nyungan language Guugu Yimidhirr. The \ndata are from Haviland (1979: 47\u201351, 66\u201367), discussed in Baerman, Brown & \nCorbett (2005: 42-45); the table has been reoriented to show the analogy with those \nfor gender and number above. \n \n(35) Guugu Yimidhirr \n \n ERG NOM-ABS ACC \nPRONOUN 1SG ngayu ngayu nganhi \nNOUN \u2018girl\u2019 gabiirrngun gabiir gabiir \n \nGiven just the pronoun, we would think that Guugu Yimidhirr had a nominative-\naccusative system. With just the evidence of nouns we would say that it was ergative-\nabsolutive. We can consider the two together, in a way that recalls the \nnon-autonomous values discussed earlier, though with the major difference that they \ninvolved forms of a single paradigm, while here we are considering different lexical \nitems of different part of speech. The consequence is that these data give evidence for \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n26 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nthree distinct case values (and Guugu Yimidhirr has several additional simpler cases). \nThis makes good sense, and might be called a \u2018combined case system\u2019. Such an \nanalysis is argued for in Goddard (1982).  \n \nSuch systems are often termed systems of \u2018split ergativity\u2019; the focus is then on which \nelements work according to an ergative-absolutive system (those lower on the \nAnimacy Hierarchy) and which follow a nominative-accusative system (those higher \non the Hierarchy). That analysis rests on the assumption that different parts of speech \ncan vary in ways which make the syntax-morphology interface anything but simple.15 \nOur Principle II, requiring morphosyntactic features be manipulated or constrained by \nsimple rules of syntax, prevents us from concealing non-canonical behaviour by \nassuming complex syntax. By accepting the notion of combined case systems, \nanalogous to combined gender and combined number systems, we avoid such \ncomplexity. \n \nWe now have analogous non-canonical behaviour for three morphosyntactic features, \nin respect of their not being consistent across the parts of speech. We should then ask \nif there is anything similar in person. Consider these data from Maybrat, (a West \nPapuan language spoken in the central area of the Bird\u2019s Head, Irian Jaya), pointed \nout to me by Matthew Baerman (also discussed in Cysouw 2005: 84): \n \n(36) Maybrat (Dol 2007: 65) \n anu p-kias ania \n 2PL 1PL-tell RECIP \n \u2018We (inclusive) tell each other.\u2019 \n \nThe inclusive is expressed by a combination of the second plural free pronoun and the \nfirst person marker on the verb (Dol 2007: 64). We thus have a combined system \nwithin person. Daniel Harbour points out (personal communication) that Kiowa has \nan analogous combination, though here it a first person free pronoun (which does not \ndistinguish number) combined with a second person plural verb form. These combine \nto give a first person inclusive (Harbour 2007: 82-83).  \n \nThe deviations concerning the third criterion have shown particularly clearly how the \ndifferent morphosyntactic features can be analyzed in parallel with each other.16  \n \n                                                 \n15 For the complex situation in Anatolian languages, see Patri (2007).  \n16 Data like those from Guugu Yimidhirr recall the examples cited for non-\nautonomous values. In those instances where the combined system represents the \ncomplete picture (recall that there are instances, like Hopi, whose combined number \nsystem applies only for some items), it is the case that at least one value is non-\nautonomous. The point is that establishing the value in a combined system requires \nreference to different parts of speech, and not just to other different feature values. \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 27 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n4.4 Criterion 4: Canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across lexemes within relevant parts of speech \n \nThe basic deviation gives us a minor value: the key point is that the limitation is on \nthe number of items involved, rather than being a featural one. There are several types \nof deviation here. Let us start from instances of number.  \n \nIn Maltese most nouns distinguish singular from plural. Now consider uqija \u2018ounce\u2019: \n \n(37) Example of the Maltese dual \n \nSINGULAR DUAL PLURAL \nuqija  uqitejn uqijiet \n \nThis noun has a dual in addition; there are around 30 nouns which have the dual. This \nis therefore a minor number value (Corbett 2000: 96). To complete the picture, only \neight of these nouns, according to Fenech (1996), require the use of the dual (uqija \n\u2018ounce\u2019 is not one of them: for \u2018two ounces\u2019 one can use either the dual uqitejn or the \nform with the numeral: \u017cew\u0121 uqijiet). In terms of canonical morphology, such nouns \nare \u2018overdifferentiated\u2019 (Bloomfield 1933: 223-224); they have a distinct form for the \ndual in their paradigm while almost all nouns do not. Other examples include the \npaucal in Avar (data and source in Corbett 2000: 96-97), and as we now see, the \npaucal in Bezhta (like Avar, a Daghestanian language). The paucal is presented in \nXalilov (1985), and the minority of nouns which have the paucal are indicated in the \nBezhta dictionary (Xalilov 1995). The examples in Xalilov (1985) are mainly \ninanimates (concrete), with a few nouns denoting animals.  \n \n(38) Example of the minor paucal in Bezhta (Xalilov 1985) \n \nSINGULAR  PAUCAL  PLURAL \nsik \u2018wineskin\u2019 sika  sikla \n \nAccording to Mad\u017eid Xalilov (personal communication), the use of the paucal, when \navailable, is obligatory for reference to a small number; there is no difference for \nagreement between plural and paucal. \n \nCase behaves similarly. The Russian second locative was discussed above (\u00a74.2) as \nbeing non-canonical in that it shows a minimal difference within the paradigm. As \nmentioned there, it also non-canonical because there is a distinct form only for a \nrelatively small number of nouns out of many thousands: \n \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n28 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(39) Nouns with the second locative: Ilola & Mustajoki (1989: 42-43)17 from \nZaliznjak (1977) 18 \n \ninflectional \nclass \nexample nouns with second \nlocative available \nof these, second \nlocative optional \n  I na bereg\u00fa \u2018on the bank\u2019 128 33 \nIII v step\u00ed \u2018in the steppe\u2019 31 8 \n \nClearly we have to distinguish case values like these from those which apply right \nacross the noun lexicon. The issues of variability between speakers, acquisition by \nchildren, and observable change over a relatively small time-span indicate that we \nshould take seriously the difference in status between features values that are close to \ncanonical and those like the second locative which have marginal status. \n \nGender is the feature for which minor values have been most discussed; there are \nspecial terms, and for good reason. Let us start from an idealized (canonical) \nsituation, in which each gender has a substantial number of nouns (controllers) and is \nreflected through agreement in a large number of targets, according to our four \ncriteria. The deviations in terms of criterion 4 may affect the controller or the target. \nIf we have a target, with a \u2018problem\u2019 (it has insufficient controllers), we label this a \n\u2018minor target gender value\u2019, though generally in the literature the simple \u2018minor \ngender\u2019 is used; see Corbett (1991: 159-160) for discussion of terms and earlier uses. \n \nThere is interesting variety in the possibilities here. Consider first the limiting case, \ntermed a non-lexical value, in which we have a gender with no nouns in it. \n \nThese in turn are of two types; the first, the \u2018neutral\u2019 gender, is a target gender form \nwhich cannot normally have a canonical noun phrase headed by a noun or pronoun as \nits controller. When analyzing the Surselvan dialect of Romansh (Haiman 1974: 130-\n134), we would postulate two genders (following the agreement class approach); the \nmasculine marked \u2013s on agreeing targets, sometimes with a change of root vowel, and \nthe feminine in -a. However, there is a third form of gender agreement: this is found \nwith controllers which are not specified for gender and number: sentential subjects, \nthe demonstrative pronoun quei \u2018that\u2019 and the impersonal pronoun igl. For example: \n \n                                                 \n17 Brown (2007) reports similar but slightly lower figures, and adds interesting \ninformation on frequency. The form is in overall decline and so published figures \ntend to be overestimates of its current use. \n18 Zaliznjak also includes v zabyt\u00b4\u00ed \u2018in a state of unconsciousness\u2019 and v poluzabyt\u00b4\u00ed \n\u2018in semiconsciousness\u2019 (Zaliznjak 1967\/2002: 287), and does not mark these as \noptional. However, Plungian (2002) states that the distinction is largely lost for these \ntwo nouns, with one or other form (in \u2013e or in \u2013\u00ed) being generalized for all uses. This \nview is adopted in the 2003 revision of Zaliznjak\u2019s dictionary. \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 29 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \n(40) Surselvan Romansh: (Haiman 1974: 130\u2013132, Corbett 1991: 215) \n Igl ei sesalzau in urezi \n there is arisen[NEUTRAL] a storm \n \u2018a storm arose\u2019 \n \nThe form which is found in (40) cannot occur with a noun phrase headed by a noun as \ncontroller; we term this target gender the \u2018neutral\u2019 gender. \n \nThe second type has no nouns uniquely in it. A nice example is found in Walman, a \nTorricelli language of Papua New Guinea; my thanks to Lea Brown and Matthew \nDryer for the data, now available in Brown & Dryer (ms.) and for discussion of their \nsignificance (our interpretations of the data differ): \n \nWalman: minor target gender \n(41) Pelen n-aykiri. \n dog M.SG-bark \n \u2018The male dog is barking.\u2019 \n \n(42) Pelen w-aykiri. \n dog F.SG-bark \n \u2018The female dog is barking.\u2019 \n \n(43) Pelen l-aykiri. \n dog DIMIN.SG-bark \n \u2018The puppy is barking.\u2019 \n \nWhile pelen \u2018dog\u2019 can be masculine or feminine, there are numerous nouns that \nbelong to the masculine or feminine gender. However, there are no nouns that belong \nuniquely to the diminutive gender.  \n \nThose were the two types of non-lexical values. Then there is the straightforward type \nof minor gender value, one which simply has few nouns in it (but is otherwise \ncanonical). Here Lelemi (a Kwa language of south-eastern Ghana) provides an \nexample; in addition to five clear gender values, there are two gender values, \nindicated with a unique agreement marker, but which appear to have extremely few \nnouns in them (Corbett 1991: 173-175, following Heine 1968). \n \nThere is a term proposed specifically for a combination of non-canonical behaviours, \nnamely inquorate gender value. Inquorate genders are agreement classes which \ncomprise a small number of nouns, but whose agreements can be readily specified as \nan unusual combination of forms available for agreement with nouns in the normal \ngenders. The origin is that an inquorate meeting is one at which there are insufficient \nappropriate persons present to take decisions; hence an inquorate gender is an \nagreement class with insufficient nouns to deserve being labelled a gender. But note \nthat the number of members is not the only criterion (now criterion 4); there is also \nthe question as to whether the agreements can be characterized as an unusual \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n30 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \ncombination of forms available for agreement with nouns in the normal genders \n(criterion 1). Consider the following examples: \n \n(44) Inquorate genders in Serbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian \n  \nSINGULAR PLURAL gloss \nakt MASCULINE akta NEUTER document \noko NEUTER o\u010di  FEMININE eye \nma\u010de NEUTER ma\u010di\u0107i MASCULINE kitten \n \nThere are three genders in Serbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian, with robust agreement and a \nsizable number of nouns in each. There are much smaller groups of nouns, \nrepresented by those in (44), which do not fit into the three-gender system. However, \nthey simply take an irregular combination of genders in the singular and plural.19 \nThey are non-canonical in being non-autonomous and in having few members. We \ncan treat these as lexical exceptions, rather than postulating additional gender values. \nIt is worth checking on the motivation here. Unlike a language like Lelemi, where the \nnouns in question control gender agreements with unique forms, the examples in (44) \ntake agreement forms which are found elsewhere in the system. What is special about \nthem is just the unusual combination of gender agreements according to whether the \nnoun is singular or plural. In that latter respect they resemble Romanian; and yet, the \nsituation is very different from that of Romanian in another respect: the \nnon-autonomous neuter gender of Romanian has many hundreds of nouns (and gains \nmore through borrowings), while those in (44) have relatively few members. \n \nFinally for non-canonical behaviour in respect of criterion 4, we consider person. \nHere we need look no further than English, where the person values distinguished by \nbe differ from those of regular verbs, with the modals then showing no distinctions at \nall. \n5 Combinations of non-canonical behaviour \n \nWe have tried to separate out the non-canonical behaviours associated with feature \nvalues. It is important to note that these can coexist, as we have just seen when \nconsidering inquorate genders. A telling example of the coexistence of non-canonical \nbehaviour is provided by the Russian second genitive (see Zaliznjak 1973, Worth \n1984, and Comrie 1986). Contrast these forms of kisel\u00b4 \u2018kissel\u2019 (a thickened fruit \ndrink) and \u010daj \u2018tea\u2019. Both are members of inflectional class I (they vary somewhat \nfrom the forms in (1), but in predictable ways), and as expected both have the normal \n(first) genitive: \n \n                                                 \n19 Nouns which can have an unusual combination of gender features are the gender \nequivalents of heteroclites in terms of inflectional patterns. The nouns given are all \nheteroclites, and the different gender values are predicted from the inflectional \npatterns, as is a normal pattern of gender assignment.  \nGreville G.

With this in mind, consider these forms (within partial \nparadigms: \n \n(49) Russian partial singular paradigms \n \nNOMINATIVE kisel\u00b4 \u010daj \nGENITIVE kiselja \u010daja \nGENITIVE 2 (as genitive) \u010daju \nDATIVE kiselju \u010daju \n \nNouns like kisel\u00b4 \u2018kissel\u2019 have no separate second genitive; in environments like (47) \nthe normal genitive is used. For nouns like \u010daj \u2018tea\u2019, which do have a second genitive, \nit always has the form of the dative: it is non-autonomous.  \n \nCriterion 2 requires that canonical features and their values are uniquely distinguished \nacross other logically compatible features and their values. The logically compatible \nfeature is number. In fact the second genitive is found only in the singular, and has no \ndistinct form in the plural. It is therefore non-canonical in respect of Criterion 2. \n \nCriterion 3 states that canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across relevant parts of speech. This is not straightforward, since in the \nmodern language \u2013 at least for some speakers \u2013 the inclusion of an agreeing modifier \ndisfavours the use of the second genitive; instead the ordinary genitive is more likely. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n32 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nHowever, in those instances where the noun stands in the less likely second genitive \nin an expression similar to (48) genitive agreement is still required. Thus krepkogo \n\u010daju \u2018strong tea\u2019 is possible as a second genitive. This distributional test shows that \nwe have to distinguish the second genitive from other forms. However, it clearly is \nnon-canonical with respect to Criterion 3, since only the noun makes the distinction, \nwhile adjectives do not. \n \nFinally, Criterion 4 requires that canonical features and their values are distinguished \nconsistently across lexemes within relevant parts of speech. In fact, the number of \nnouns with this second genitive is restricted and declining.20 They are all members of \nthe inflectional class I. Of the nouns which have a second genitive, for some the \nsecond genitive is normally used in partitive expressions, for the others the second \ngenitive is a possibility, but in competition with the ordinary genitive; for data on this \nsee Panov (1968: 180), Graudina, Ickovi\u010d & Katlinskaja (1976: 121-125), Comrie, \nStone & Polinsky (1996: 124-125), and especially Paus (1994). Thus the second \ngenitive varies from being normally used, to being optional, to unusual \u2013 according to \nthe particular lexical item. \n \nThe Russian second genitive is non-canonical in respect of each of our four criteria. \nGiven its uncertain, marginal status, it is therefore somewhat ironic that it was one of \nthe case values incorporated, alongside the robust case values, in Jakobson\u2019s famous \ncube (1958). \n6 Typology of feature values and non-canonical behaviour \n \nWe should take stock. We set out to demonstrate the existence of a penumbra of non-\ncanonical behaviour for the different features and their values. We looked only at the \nstrictly morphosyntactic features, those with a role both in syntax and in morphology. \nFor lack of data, since they are found only rarely as genuine morphosyntactic \nfeatures, we omitted respect and definiteness (Corbett 2006: 135-138). We considered \nthe criteria in order, starting with whichever feature provided clear or familiar data. \n \n                                                 \n20 Ilola & Mustajoki (1989: 41-41) reporting on Zaliznjak (1977), identify 396. \nHowever, the form has been in decline, continuing since the publication of Zalizjak\u2019s \ndictionary; see Brown, Tiberius & Corbett (2007: 522) for recent statistics. Our \nexample helps show this: kisel\u00b4 \u2018kissel\u2019 is given by Zaliznjak as having a second \ngenitive, but consultants do not offer this form. A Google search gave over 200 \nexamples of stakan kiselja \u2018glass of kissel\u2019 and none of stakan kiselju; however, other \nweb searches reveal occasional sporadic instances of kiselju as a second genitive. A \nGoogle search on 29.5.08 produced four examples of stakan kiselju compared with \naround 1070 examples of stakan kiselja. All this shows that this particular noun has \nalmost lost its second genitive, but not quite. For further discussion of the second \ngenitive see Wierzbicka (1983: 249-252) and Uspenskij (2004: 11-26) and for a \nrecent analysis of the second genitive in the Russian National Corpus see Brehmer \n(2009). \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 33 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nIt is now time for a systematic summary of what we have found. In (50), the examples \nof non-canonical behaviour for each of the four criteria are included, feature by \nfeature, together with the section where they were introduced. \n \n(50) Non-canonical feature values with respect to the four criteria \n \n Criterion 1: \nautonomous \nCriterion 2: \ndistinguished \nacross \nfeatures\/values \nCriterion 3: \ndistinguished \nconsistently \nacross parts of \nspeech21 \nCriterion 4:  \ndistinguished \nconsistently \nacross lexemes \nnumber  Biak \u00a74.2 Mele Fila \u00a74.3 Maltese \u00a74.4 \ngender Romanian \u00a74.1 Russian \u00a73.2 Mba \u00a74.3 Lelemi \u00a74.4 \nperson Old Nubian \u00a74.1 Belhare \u00a74.2 Maybrat \u00a74.3  English \u00a74.4 \ncase Classical \nArmenian \u00a73.1 \nRussian \u00a74.2 Guugu \nYimidhirr \u00a74.3 \nRussian \u00a75 \n \nIt is important to keen in mind our original aim, namely to demonstrate the types of \nnon-canonical behaviour which are found, across the different features. This did not \ntherefore require a systematic survey, though many languages were analysed. Given \nthis, the picture that emerges in (50) is remarkably complete. We would not have \nexpected such full coverage. It suggests that whatever the semantic and syntactic \ndifferences between the morphosyntactic features, there are strong similarities in their \nmorphology. And this has implications for the status of the morphological \ncomponent. \n \nThere is one gap in (50): we have not found any examples of non-autonomous \nnumber. We should be cautious, given the relative rarity of the examples we have \noverall: and yet, the fact that there is no example in the data collected for the Surrey \nSyncretism Database (Baerman, Brown & Corbett 2002) may be indicative. It is \nworth checking what an example would look like: \n \n(51) Hypothetical non-autonomous number value \n \n SINGULAR DUAL PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE a a b \nACCUSATIVE c d d \n \n                                                 \n21 For Criterion 3 the straightforward instances of non-canonicity would include \nYimas (number), and gender and case in English; since we need to show just the \nexistence of a particular type of non-canonical behaviour \u2013 and so one example is \nsufficient \u2013 we have rather plotted the more interesting instances of combined values \nin the table. \nPenumbra of morphosyntactic feature systems \n34 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nThis hypothetical situation appears unlikely.22 Let us suppose, while continuing to \ncheck the evidence, that there is a genuine gap in the pattern. We should ask why that \nwould be. There is a suggestive remark in Carstairs-McCarthy (1994: 771). \nDiscussing the relation of gender and number, he claims that the pattern of Romanian \n(as in Figure 4 above) must be of that type. Non-autonomous gender values (what he \ncalls gender mixtures) can be based only on number. I suspect he is right, and this \nobservation, though only partly relevant, is a useful hint: number is a good base for \nnon-autonomous values of other features. There are various indicators for the primacy \nof number among the morphosyntactic features. I believe that the key one which \nmakes it a good \u2018base\u2019 (for non-autonomous values of other features) is that lexemes \nwith just one number value (singularia and pluralia tantum) are relatively common, \nwhile those with, say, one case value are not. Since number is a good base for non-\nautonomous values of the other features, this may be the reason why it cannot itself \nhave non-autonomous values based on other features.23 However, before speculating \nfurther, we should remind ourselves that the degree of coverage in (50) is already \nremarkable and further work will be needed to establish whether the gap in the data is \nindeed significant. \n7 Conclusion \n \nFeature systems are frequently much less clean and neat than is generally supposed. \nIn order to tackle the systems which have proved difficult to analyse, we adopted the \ncanonical approach, previously applied specifically to case. While this type of \ndetailed work has typically been carried out on the individual features separately, we \nnoted intriguing similarities in the non-canonical behaviours of each. We then found a \nsurprisingly complete distribution of the types of non-canonical behaviour over the \ndifferent features. Thus the differences between the morphosyntactic features in their \nsemantics and syntax do not determine similar differences in morphology, which \nillustrates again the autonomy of morphology.   \n \n                                                 \n22 Note, however, that the conditions where it could arise are readily found. All that is \nrequired in principle is a number feature with two autonomous values, intersecting \nwith one other two-valued feature (gender, case or person). That, in the right \nconfiguration, could give a non-autonomous number value, as in hypothetical (51).  \n23 Jonathan Bobaljik offers an explanation for the gap (personal communication). He \nsuggest that the examples of non-autonomous values that we find are combinations of \notherwise attested syncretisms. Thus we find examples of first person being \ncontrasted with syncretic second and third persons, and elsewhere first and second \nsyncretic versus third person (see Baerman, Brown & Corbett 2005: 59-81 for \nexamples). His suggestion is that the gap may be connected to a gap in possible \nsyncretisms, if no language has a systematic singular and dual syncretism (opposed to \nplural). However, the Otomanguean language Pame has extensive singular-dual \nsyncretism in the noun system, also affecting verb agreement (see Gibson & \nBartholemew (1979), discussed in Corbett (2000: 121-122). Hence we cannot account \nfor the gap, if it proves robust, along the lines of Bobaljik\u2019s suggestion. \nGreville G. Corbett \n \n 35 : Version of 3\/11\/09 \nThere are three main implications following from this research. First, in theoretical \nsyntax we tend to be concerned with the distribution of feature values; we need to \nbear in mind that these values may have radically different status, one from another. \nThus there is no one simple numerical answer to a question like: \u2018how many case \nvalues has Russian?\u2019 Rather there are some case values which occupy such core \npositions that without them Russian morphosyntax would fall apart, and others with \nvarying types of marginal status, each requiring careful analysis.24 Second, a similar \npoint holds for grammar writing. When we learn that, for instance, a language has a \ndual, we need clear information whether its dual is like that of Sanskrit, available \nacross the relevant parts of speech and used obligatorily, or like that of Maltese. And \nthird, the less clear areas of feature systems, their penumbra, are important for \ndiachrony, since they show potential routes through which feature values can arise \nand die out.  \n \nReferences \n \nBaerman, Matthew. 2002a.
