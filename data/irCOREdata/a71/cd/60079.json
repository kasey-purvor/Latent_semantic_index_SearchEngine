Introduction 68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n \n Globally, rodents destroy or spoil substantial amounts of food intended for \nhuman or animal consumption (Singleton et al., 1999; Stenseth et al., 2003). \nConsequently, a range of methods is employed to reduce rodent density and \nassociated damage. This is most commonly done in developed countries using \nanticoagulant rodenticides, vitamin K antagonists that prevent the synthesis of \nfunctional prothombrin and related blood-clotting factors. Extensive use of first-\ngeneration anticoagulant rodenticides (FGARs) during the 1950s, however, led to the \nevolution of genetic resistance in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), with widespread \ncross-resistance to other compounds (Cowan et al., 1995; Thijssen, 1995). As a \nresult, more potent second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) were \ndeveloped which have a greater affinity to binding sites, resulting in greater \naccumulation, persistence and toxicity (Parmar et al., 1987; Huckle and Warburton, \n1986). \n Given their mode of action, both FGARs and SGARs are potentially harmful to all \nvertebrates, and so users are expected to adopt measures that limit direct exposure \nto non-target species. However, the degree to which these preventive measures are \nadhered to, particularly by non-professionals, is unknown. For example, in Britain \nsome products are readily available to householders who may be less aware of the \nrisks of non-target poisoning and\/or less likely to follow manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. \nNon-target species may also be deliberately poisoned (Barnett et al., 2006). \n Most studies investigating indirect exposure of non-target species to \nanticoagulant rodenticides have focussed on the consumption of poisoned rodents by \npredatory birds and mammals (Newton et al., 1990, 1999a; Berny et al., 1997; \n 3\n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \nMcDonald et al., 1998; Shore et al., 1999, 2003a). However, invertebrates can be a \nroute of contamination for insectivorous vertebrates (Spurr and Drew, 1999) and, \nalthough exposure of insectivorous birds has been reported (Borst and Counotte, \n2002; Dowding et al., 2006), exposure of insectivorous mammals has not been \nstudied. Potential routes of uptake by invertebrates include: the consumption of \nrodent faeces (Laas et al., 1985; Craddock, 2002; Eason et al., 2002); the \nconsumption of rodent carcasses; ingestion of soil-bound residues by e.g. \nearthworms; and direct consumption of poison baits (Spurr and Drew, 1999; Dunlevy \net al., 2000; Craddock, 2002). Given that many ecological communities typically \ncontain larger numbers of insectivorous vertebrates relative to predators, the \ncontamination of invertebrates potentially poses the greater risk of non-target \npoisoning in terms of species and individuals. \n The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is a medium-sized (0.8 - 1.2 kg) \ninsectivorous mammal distributed throughout Britain and across Western Europe \n(Morris and Reeve, 2008). Hedgehogs are of particular interest in terms of exposure \nto anticoagulant rodenticides, as they are reputed to have declined significantly in the \nlast few decades in Britain, and poisoning by industrial chemicals, including \nrodenticides, may have been a contributory factor (Battersby and Tracking Mammals \nPartnership, 2005). Our overall aim in this study was to investigate the scale and \nseverity of exposure of hedgehogs throughout Britain to some of the first-generation \n(warfarin, coumatetralyl) and all of the second-generation (difenacoum, \nbromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen) anticoagulant rodenticides that are \nlicensed for use in Britain; the indandione compounds were not determined using the \nanalytical techniques available to us in this study. The current study is the first to \nassess anticoagulant rodenticide contamination in Britain of species at this trophic \n 4\n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \nlevel. Furthermore, we analysed tissue residues using both high performance liquid \nchromatography coupled with fluorescence detection (hereafter HPLC) and liquid-\nchromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). To date, characterisation of exposure \nof non-target species has mostly used HPLC (for example, McDonald et al., 1998; \nShore et al., 2003a, 2006a; Walker et al., 2008) but LCMS is potentially a more \nsensitive technique and, perhaps more importantly, enables compounds with similar \nchemical structure to be differentiated with greater confidence since identification is \nbased upon mass rather than elution times. Our specific objectives were: to compare \nand contrast the (i) frequency of occurrence and (ii) average residue magnitude of \nFGARs and SGARs in hedgehogs by analysing liver concentrations using both HPLC \nand LCMS techniques; (iii) to determine whether there were differences in levels of \ncontamination between males and females and between geographical regions; and \n(iv) on the basis of these results, compare the extent of sub-lethal exposure of \nhedgehogs in Britain with that of predatory birds and mammals, and assess whether \nhedgehogs are at risk of acute toxicity from their exposure. \n \n2. Materials and Methods  \n \n During 2004-2006, 20 adult hedgehog carcasses were collected from wildlife \nrehabilitation hospitals from each of six (Scotland, Wales, Midlands and West, South-\nWestern, South-Eastern, and Eastern) of the seven regions of Britain as defined by \nthe Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs when assessing rodenticide \nusage (Dawson et al., 2003); we were unable to obtain samples from the remaining \nregion (Northern England). All 120 hedgehogs used in the study had either died \nfollowing admission or were euthanased due to their injuries or illness.  \n 5\n Each carcass was weighed, sexed and stored at -20oC until dissection, when it \nwas inspected for lesions, injuries or other abnormalities. These observations, along \nwith information collected at admission, were used to determine the cause of death \nor reason for euthanasia. The whole liver, the primary organ for accumulation of \nrodenticides (Huckle and Warburton, 1986), was removed, weighed to two decimal \nplaces and stored in aluminium foil at -20oC until further analysis.  \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n \n2.1. Residue analyses \n \n Anticoagulant rodenticide residues were quantified using both HPLC and LCMS. \nThe four main SGARs licensed for use in the UK (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, \ndifenacoum and flocoumafen) were quantified using both techniques. The two most \ncommonly applied FGARs in the UK, coumatetralyl and warfarin (Dawson and \nGarthwaite, 2004), were also analysed using LCMS only. All reagents were from \nRathburn Chemical Co. Ltd, Walkerburn, Scotland and of a grade suitable for HPLC \nand LCMS analysis. \n Extraction procedures for second-generation compounds followed Hunter (1985) \nand Jones (1996). Samples were analysed in randomised batches of 15. Each liver \nwas defrosted at room temperature and a subsample of approximately 1g (mean wet \nweight\u00b1SE=0.98\u00b10.01g) ground to a homogenous paste using acid-washed furnace-\ncleaned sand and anhydrous sodium sulphate. A 30ml aliquot of extraction solvent \n(50:50 acetone\/chloroform) was mixed thoroughly with the ground tissue, stood for 1 \nhour, then decanted and collected in a 100ml measuring cylinder through a funnel \ncontaining glass wool and anhydrous sodium sulphate. The ground tissue was \nsubsequently washed with 30ml aliquots of extraction solvent and washings were \n 6\n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \nadded to the original extraction aliquot until a total volume of 100ml was collected. \nThe mixture was mixed by inversion and left to stand at room temperature for a \nminimum of 12 hours. Subsequently the extract was divided into 50ml for analysis by \nHPLC and 30ml was archived at 4\u00baC in the dark for later analysis by LCMS. Both \nsamples were reduced to zero volume by evaporation of solvent in a fume cupboard \nand the remaining 20ml was poured to waste. \n The reduced extract was re-dissolved in 1ml of extract solvent and 4ml \nacetronitrile and cleaned using an SPE Isolute C18 (EC) 1g column (Internation \nSorbent Technology, Mid-Glamorgan, UK) connected to an SPE 500-mg NH2 column \nsolvated with methanol. Columns were conditioned with 5ml methanol followed by \n5ml acetronitrile. The re-dissolved extract was loaded onto the C18 column and \nwashed with three 5ml aliquots of acetronitrile at <4ml\/minute. The C18 column was \nthen removed and 4ml ammoniacal methanol was washed through the NH2 column \n(flow <4ml\/min). The resulting eluant was combined with 5ml methanol, reduced to \nnear dryness (to remove ammonia) and re-dissolved in 0.5ml methanol. Samples \nwere finally transferred to a chromatography vial via a 4mm syringe filter (Whatman \nInternational Ltd, Kent, UK).  \n \n2.2. High performance liquid chromatography \n \n High performance liquid chromatography (HP Series 1100, Agilent Technologies, \nBracknell, Berkshire, UK) was performed using a ODS Hypersil 200mm x 4.6mm \n5\u00b5m column (Thermo electron corporation, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK) at 30oC. A 15\u00b5l \naliquot of cleaned-up extract was injected onto the column using 76:24 \nmethanol:water (v\/v) supplemented with 0.25% (v\/v) acetic acid and 40mM \n 7\n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \nammonium acetate, as the mobile phase pumped at 1.0ml\/min isocratically. SGARs \nwere detected by fluorescence spectronomy (HP 1100 series fluorescence detector) \nusing three excitation wavelengths (313nm, 320nm and 350nm) simultaneously to \nallow for correction of co-eluting peaks that interfered with the fluorescence of the \nrodenticides. The emission for each excitation wavelength was measured at 380nm. \nThe excitation wavelength of 313nm gave the greatest emission signal at 380nm and \nwas thus used for quantification. The ratio the emission response elicited by the \n320nm wavelength to that elicited by 313nm and the ratio elicited by 350nm to that \nelicited by 313nm were both used to aid identification. A chromatographic peak was \nidentified as a specific SGAR if the ratios of the signals for each excitation \nwavelength matched the ratios in the standards and if the absolute retention time of \nthe peak fell within the retention time window of the calibration standards. \n \n2.3. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry \n \n The archived extraction samples were cleaned using methods previously \noutlined and analysed by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry \nconducted on a Zorbax Eclipse C18 3\u00b5m column (150 x 2mm). The analysis was \nconducted using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetronitrile:water containing \n0.1% formic acid in the ratio 75:25 and at a flow rate of 200\u00b5l\/min. The column was \nmaintained at 35oC; injection volume was set at 15\u00b5l. A Surveyor HPLC system \n(Thermo Corporation, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK) was used to separate \nthe sample and deliver it to an LCQ Duo, API ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo \nCorporation, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK).  \n 8\n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n Analyses were performed using electrospray ionisation in the negative mode. \nThe capillary temperature was set at 270oC with an ionisation voltage of -36.0V. The \nsheath and auxiliary gasses used were helium and nitrogen maintained at 80psi and \n20psi respectively. Sensitivity was increased using single ion monitoring, scanning \nfor the molecular ion of each of the rodenticides. Selectivity and conformational \nanalysis was undertaken using tandem mass spectrometry.  \n   \n2.4. Quality assurance \n \n Quantification of residues was carried out by comparison with rodenticide \nstandards (Chemservice, Greyhound Chromatography, Merseyside, UK) for all the \nFGARS and SGARS that were quantified. For HPLC analysis, the linear calibration \nrange was 50-500ng\/ml and the limit of detection (LoD) for peaks identified as \nSGARs was determined from the linear regression of the multilevel calibration using \nthe equation Y=Y0+3Sy\/x, where Y is the LoD response, Y0 is the intercept and Sy\/x is \nthe standard error of the regression line. The HPLC LoDs for bromadiolone, \ndifenacoum, flocoumafen and brodifacoum based on the standards were 0.03, 0.01, \n0.01 and 0.02\u00b5g respectively, which were analogous to previous analyses of polecat \n(Mustela putorius) livers (Shore et al., 2003a). The LoDs for LCMS were obtained \nusing a similar method and were 0.002\u00b5g for all compounds. \n For LCMS analysis, three concentrations (100, 50 and 10ng\/ml) of the standards \nfor all the FGARs and SGARS were run alongside procedural blanks after every eight \nsamples to determine day-to-day quantitation. Calibration curves were obtained \nusing a range of concentrations (500, 400, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1 and 0.1ng\/ml) of \n 9\n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \nthese standards; the average areas of ten determinations of each standard \nconcentration were used to produce these curves. \n For both HPLC and LCMS analysis, procedural blanks (reagents only) were \nanalysed alongside samples to detect possible contamination during sample \npreparation. Chicken liver samples were each spiked with known concentrations of \neach SGAR and were prepared, stored and analysed in the same way as unknown \nsamples to determine sample matrix recovery and percent recovery data. For HPLC \nthe mean (\u00b1SE%) recovery, determined from analyses of eight spiked samples, were \n108\u00b111.5%, 81.6\u00b15.0%, 95.2\u00b19.8% and 93.3\u00b19.0% for difenacoum, bromadiolone, \nflocoumafen and brodifacoum respectively. Corresponding figures for LCMS recovery \nwere 59.2\u00b19.9%, 27.3\u00b112.0%, 59.2\u00b19.9% and 65.9\u00b17.3%, determined from analyses \nof four samples spiked for each SGAR. The apparently lower recovery associated \nwith LCMS than HPLC may have been an artefact reflecting poor stability of spiked \nsamples when archived. The bromadiolone and difenacoum concentrations in the \nactual samples of hedgehog livers were not significantly lower when quantified by \nLCMS than when measured by HPLC (see Results). Concentration data in tissue \nsamples were not recovery-corrected. \n \n2.5. Statistical analysis \n \n The numbers of samples with detectable and non-detectable rodenticide \nresidues as determined by HPLC and LCMS were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact \ntests. Liver concentrations were not normally distributed and average residue \nconcentrations are given as medians. Median liver concentrations in animals with \ndetectable residues were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Wilcoxon matched \n 10\n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \npairs tests were used to compare residue concentrations detected by the two \ntechniques within the same individual. Binary logistic regression was used to \nexamine the effect of region, batch number and sex on the presence\/absence of \ncontamination; batch was included as a factor to confirm that batching samples for \nanalysis did not introduce any analytical biases. All analyses were conducting using \nSPSS, Release 15.0 (Field, 2005). \n \n3. Results \n \n Reasons cited by wildlife hospitals for admission of the hedgehogs used in this \nstudy were: injury (n=55); unknown (n=46); natural causes (n=18); and suspected \npoisoning (n=1), although this diagnosis was not confirmed clinically or chemically. \nNo obvious signs of haemorrhage other than that associated with trauma were found \nduring post-mortem examinations (n=120).  \n Using HPLC, detectable liver concentrations of brodifacoum, bromadiolone, \ndifenacoum and flocoumafen were found in four, 13, 16 and zero animals \nrespectively (Table 1); in total, SGARs were detected in 27 individuals (23% of the \nanimals analysed: Table 2). In contrast, SGARs were detected in 69 (57.5%) \nhedgehogs when the analysis was conducted by LCMS (Table 2). FGARs (only \ndetermined by LCMS) were detected in 27 (22.5%) animals (Table 2). Overall, \nresidues of at least one FGAR or SGAR were detected in two thirds of hedgehogs \nwhen samples were analysed by LCMS. Fifty-three (44%) individuals had liver \nresidues of one compound; 21 (18%), five (4%) and one (1%) animal contained \nresidues of two, three and four compounds respectively. \n 11\n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n The greater frequency of detection of SGARs by LCMS than HPLC was largely \nbecause more instances of difenacoum and bromadiolone contamination were \ndetected by LCMS (Table 2); the difference in frequency of detection between the \nanalytical methods was significant for difenacoum (Fisher\u2019s Exact test, P<0.001) and \napproached significance for bromadiolone (two-tailed Fisher\u2019s Exact test, P=0.10). \nMuch of this higher frequency of detection was due to the greater sensitivity of the \nLCMS. Liver difenacoum and bromadiolone concentrations below 0.025\u03bcg\/g wet \nweight (ww) and 0.05\u03bcg\/g ww, respectively, were not detected by HPLC, whereas \nthese concentrations comprised 25-50% of the LCMS detections for these \ncompounds (Fig. 1). Overall, detection of these low level difenacoum and \nbromadiolone residues by LCMS accounted for an extra 30 hedgehogs (25% of the \nsample) being identified as containing rodenticide.  \n The average magnitude of residues (Table 3), not just the frequency of \noccurrence, also varied with analytical technique. When only hedgehogs with HPLC \nand\/or LCMS detectable residues were included in the statistical analysis, the \nmedian liver bromadiolone concentration was lower when determined by LCMS than \nby HPLC (Mann Whitney U test: U=61.0, n1=23, n2=13, P<0.01; Fig. 2). This reflected \nthe presence of low-level bromadiolone concentrations (typically < 0.1 \u00b5g\/g ww; Fig. \n1) that were detected by LCMS but not by HPLC (and so were not included in the \nHPLC dataset of animals with detected residues). When the statistical analysis was \nfurther restricted to a matched pair comparison of just animals with bromadiolone \nresidues detected by both analytical methods, there was no significant difference \nbetween LCMS and HPLC measurements (Wilcoxon matched pairs test: n=10, Z=-\n0.663, P>0.05). This again suggested that differences between HPLC- and LCMS-\ndetermined measurements were solely due to detection of low-level concentrations \n 12\n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \nby LCMS. However, this was not true for difenacoum. Median liver concentrations of \ndifenacoum in animals with detectable residues did not differ with the method of \ndetermination (U=427.5, n1=16, n2=57, P>0.05), despite the presence of a relatively \nlarge number of low-level difenacoum residues in the LCMS sample (Fig. 1). This \nmay reflect differential responses (involving enhancement or quenching of response) \nof the two techniques, as matched-pair analysis indicated that residues were higher \nin animals when measured by LCMS (n=9, Z=-2.429, P<0.05). \nAnalyses of potential differences in residue magnitude with sex and region were \nbased on LCMS data. Geographical region was not significantly associated with the \npresence\/absence of (i) FGARs (coumatetralyl and warfarin), (ii) bromadiolone and \ndifenacoum combined (the most commonly found SGARs), (iii) all four SGARs, or (iv) \nall FGARs and SGARs combined (Table 4). Sex did, however, approach significance \nin two of the four models (bromadiolone and difenacoum combined, P=0.052; all \nSGARs, P=0.072; Table 4), with a greater frequency of occurrence of contamination \nin males than females.  \n \n4. Discussion \n \n The major proportion of hedgehog diet consists of invertebrates, particularly \nmolluscs, beetles and earthworms (Wroot, 1984). Invertebrates have different blood-\nclotting mechanisms to vertebrates and so are less susceptible to anticoagulant \nrodenticides than birds and mammals (Shirer, 1992; Pain et al., 2000; Craddock, \n2002; Johnston et al., 2005). However, ground-dwelling invertebrates can access \nand feed on rodenticides, including those placed in bait stations (Spurr and Drew, \n1999; Dunlevy et al., 2000; Craddock, 2002), and retain ingested compound in their \n 13\n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \nbodies for four weeks or longer (Booth et al., 2001; Craddock, 2002). Additional \nexposure of invertebrates to rodenticides may also arise through ingesting \ncontaminated soil (where baits have not been protected or have been displaced or \nremoved from bait stations), rodent food caches and rodent carcasses. Thus, \npredation of contaminated invertebrates is likely to be a major pathway by which \nhedgehogs are exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides. However, hedgehogs will \nconsume small mammal carcasses if they are available (Yalden, 1976) and may also \naccess spilt, cached or unprotected baits directly, and these may be alternative \nsecondary and primary exposure routes.  \nWhatever the route of exposure, it is clear from our results that contamination of \nhedgehogs with anticoagulant rodenticides is commonplace. These compounds may \ntherefore similarly pose a risk to other species at the same trophic level, such as \ninsectivorous birds (Rammell et al., 1984; Empson and Miskelly, 1999; Robertson \nand Colbourne, 2001). The frequencies with which we detected SGAR residues by \nHPLC were towards the mid (brodifacoum, bromadiolone) or low (difenacoum) end of \nthe spectrum documented for predatory birds and mammals in Britain (Table 1), but \nwere comparable in some instances to prevalence rates in species considered to be \nspecialist predators of small mammals, such as the polecat (Shore et al., 2003a), \nbarn owl (Tyto alba) (Newton et al., 1999b) and tawny owl (Strix aluco) (Walker et al., \n2008). Likewise, the magnitudes of residues were also broadly similar to those \nmeasured in predatory birds and mammals in Britain (Table 3). Thus, hedgehogs in \nBritain appear to be at similar risk of exposure and effects from anticoagulant \nrodenticides as non-target predatory birds and mammals. \nOur data also suggest that exposure of hedgehogs is geographically widespread. \nThe absence of any significant difference between the proportion of individuals with \n 14\n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \nresidues and region indicates that the scale of exposure of hedgehogs does not vary \nmarkedly across Britain, consistent with studies of polecats (Shore et al., 2003a), \neven though the apparent use of rodenticides in arable regions varies geographically \n(Dawson et al., 2003). In part, however, the likelihood of detecting correlated patterns \nbetween prevalence rates in animals and regional patterns of use will be affected by \nexactly which specific compounds are used. This is because compounds, and \nparticularly FGARs and SGARs, differ in their biological half-life and toxicity (Eason \net al., 2002). Furthermore, geographical variation in arable use of rodenticides is \nunlikely to be of relevance to those animals that were from urban areas. There are no \npublished data for rodenticide use in urban areas in Britain and so it is not possible to \nassess how urban use may relate to exposure of hedgehogs. Finally, our finding that \nmale hedgehogs tended to be more likely to accumulate rodenticides than females \nmay also have a spatial, albeit small scale, explanation. Males have a greater \nranging behaviour than females (Reeve, 1994) and this is likely to increase the \nlikelihood of individuals finding baits and contaminated forage. \n The overall similarity between hedgehogs and specialist avian and mammalian \npredators of small mammals was unexpected. This may simply indicate that \nsecondary exposure is more common than previously anticipated for food chains in \nwhich small mammals are not a major component. However, this similarity may mask \nother factors, such as differences in the likely exposure of non-target species in \nurban and rural areas. We had no information on the exact location in which our \nhedgehogs were found. Our reliance on analysing the carcasses of animals admitted \nto wildlife hospitals may have biased the sample towards urban areas because their \nrelatively high human population density may mean that sick\/injured hedgehogs are \nmore likely to be found. In contrast, most UK studies on secondary exposure in \n 15\n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \npredatory birds and mammals have analysed animals that are predominantly from \nrural areas. It is not clear whether an urban-biased sample would tend to increase or \ndecrease the likelihood of detecting exposure. Rodenticides are widely used on \nfarms in rural Britain but are also commonly used throughout urban and suburban \nlandscapes by both professional practitioners and the general public. The density of \nbaits and contaminated prey relative to population numbers of non-target species in \nrural and urban areas is completely unknown. Furthermore, it is possible that \nhedgehogs may be particularly susceptible to exposure in urban areas where \nuntrained domestic users may be prone to unintentional misuse. Animals may also \nbe more likely to suffer traumatic injuries in human-dominated habitats through \ncollisions with motor vehicles or injuries arising from misadventure (Reeve and \nHuijser, 1999). If such injuries occur independently of levels of rodenticide uptake, \nsuch a sample would give a reliable indication of levels of sub-lethal contamination in \nthose areas, but if rodenticide uptake increases the likelihood of injury (Fournier-\nChambrillon et al., 2004), then urban samples in particular may over-estimate \nexposure rates. Comparison of exposure rates of hedgehogs or other species from \nknown urban and rural locations is merited.  \n The analysis of our sample of hedgehog tissues using LCMS as well as HPLC \nhas shown that exposure, particularly low-level exposure, is markedly \nunderestimated by HPLC. The proportion of hedgehogs exposed to SGARs \nincreased by two- to three-fold when the analysis was conducted by LCMS. We \npostulate that current estimates of the exposure of predatory birds and mammals to \nSGARs have been similarly under-estimated where they have been determined using \nHPLC measurements.  \n 16\n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n Although exposure of hedgehogs to anticoagulants may be widespread, there is \nno evidence from our study that this commonly causes lethal poisoning. The post \nmortem examination of the animals in our study did not identify any instances of \nhaemorrhage that appeared consistent with rodenticide poisoning. Although there is \nno precise liver concentration in hedgehogs or other species that is diagnostic of \nlethal poisoning, SGAR residues in excess of 0.2\u03bcg\/g ww are considered to be of \nconcern in barn owls (Newton et al., 1999a) and residues of >1\u03bcg\/g ww are generally \nconsidered to be very high. Irrespective of the measurement technique in our study, \nthe percentage of hedgehogs with summed SGAR residues above 0.2\u03bcg\/g ww and \n1\u03bcg\/g ww was <11% and <5% respectively. The detection of liver residues exceeding \n1\u03bcg\/g ww suggests that lethal poisoning by rodenticides is likely to occur in some \nhedgehogs, but the lack of haemorrhaging and relatively low magnitude of most \nresidues suggests that, for animals in our study, contamination with rodenticides was \ngenerally not a contributory factor in their admission to wildlife hospitals. Overall, \nhowever, poisoning of non-target wild animals by anticoagulant rodenticides is \ndifficult to monitor and studies such as ours may underestimate poisoning events \nbecause animals with fatal doses may become lethargic some hours before death \nand die in cryptic locations (Newton et al., 1999a). Furthermore, there is a general \nlack of knowledge about whether sub-lethal exposure, as appears to be common in \nhedgehogs, may be associated with any sub-lethal impacts or an increased \nsusceptibility to toxicity following repeated exposures.  \n \n5. Conclusion \n This study has shown that the European hedgehog, an insectivorous species, \nhas similar rates of exposure (judged from the proportion of animals with HPLC-\n 17\n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \ndetected liver concentrations and the size of those residues) to those of specialist \npredators of small mammals. Given that hedgehogs only rarely eat rodents, these \nresults indicate that anticoagulant rodenticides are finding their way into ecosystems \nvia transfer pathways other than through consumption of contaminated rodents. \nFurthermore, our data indicate that analysis of samples using LCMS can increase the \nestimate of exposure by two- to three-fold, largely through the detection of low-level \nresidues, and that the use of HPLC may have markedly under-estimated the true \nscale of exposure of other non-target species to anticoagulant rodenticides.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n We thank the RSPCA Westhatch, RSPCA Stapeley Grange, RSPCA East \nWinch, RSPCA Mallydams Wood, The Gower Bird Hospital, St Tiggywinkles and \nHessilhead Wildlife Rescue Trust for supplying hedgehog carcasses and the \nDulverton Trust (C.V.
