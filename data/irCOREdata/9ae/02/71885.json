The House of Lords, having appeared to take the bold step of introducing such a principle in its decisions in Ramsay (1982) and Furniss (1984), has now recast it as a principle of purposive interpretation, since it does not consider itself to have the constitutional power to introduce a general overarching interpretative principle (MacNiven 2003). Meantime, the government declined to put a proposal for such a general principle to the legislature (apparently bowing to business pressures), but has instead introduced a procedure requiring notification to the Revenue of new tax planning devices; the statutory power for this is drafted in impossibly wide terms, so its effectiveness will depend on the more detailed regulatory requirements, which have been more narrowly drafted (Richards 2004). It has been suggested that there is no need for a legislated antiavoidance principle, as sufficient resources are available in the common law (Simpson 2004); while the judicial shift to purposive interpretation of existing tax law without a legislated anti-avoidance principle is likely to favour the taxpayer (Tiley 2004).","cites":null},{"id":16455832,"title":"14 Anti-avoidance principles (or the requirement to show a commercial justification rather than a tax-reduction motive) are already present in specific parts of UK tax law, and have been shown to operate with `reasonable objectivity\u2019","authors":[],"date":"2004","doi":null,"raw":"14 Anti-avoidance principles (or the requirement to show a commercial justification rather than a tax-reduction motive) are already present in specific parts of UK tax law, and have been shown to operate with `reasonable objectivity\u2019 (Kessler 2004).

Its \neffectiveness and the levels of compliance greatly depend on acceptance by citizens of its \nlegitimacy. This paper proposes a rethinking of approaches to compliance, extending \nperspectives which view regulation as an interactive or reflexive process mediated by socio-\nlinguistic practices. These suggest that the meaning of rules is not fixed ex ante, but may \nemerge and change through such interactions, which therefore actually help to construct what \nit means to comply. The analysis supports proposals to base tax law on purposive general \nprinciples combined with detailed rules. However, it suggests that this should be the approach \nadopted for the tax code as a whole, instead of focusing mainly on the merits of a general \nanti-avoidance principle, as some of the recent debates have done. Although a general anti-\navoidance principle may have a place, the aim of achieving a cultural shift in the regulatory \nsystem of tax compliance needs public debates on the substantive general principles of \ntaxation. These have been neglected, as tax reform initiatives have tended to become fruitless \nexercises in trying to rewrite complex tax law in plain language. Unless the tax code itself is \nbuilt on a sound foundation of principles generally accepted as fair, compliance will be \nproblematic. \nThe first part of this paper explores the question of interpretation of rules and the problem of \navoidance and game-playing. It re-examines the issue of the indeterminacy of rules and \nrelocates it within the context of professional and regulatory practices, suggesting that it is \nthese interactions that construct the meaning of rules and hence of compliance. In the second \npart the analysis is applied to income taxation, to sketch out how the international tax system \nhas been constructed through the interaction of contending views of fairness in the allocation \nof tax jurisdiction, while in the process becoming refined into a formalist and technicist \nprocess of game-playing. I argue that the central factor in this process has been the inherent \ncontestability of the core concepts of international taxation, the rules on corporate residence \nand source of income. The final section then considers some of the current proposals for \nimproving tax compliance, in particular by reducing complexity, improving clarity, and the \nuse of broad principles. \nA. THE CONSTRUCTION OF COMPLIANCE \n1. Negotiating the Meaning of Rules and Legitimacy \nMuch of the discussion of `compliance\u2019 with rules implies a rather instrumental view of law, \nin which the aim of the regulator is to induce the regulatee to comply with the requirements \nof a rule. This assumes that regulator and regulatee both have a relatively clear understanding \nof what the rules mean, and indeed a shared understanding. Although there have long been \n 2 \njurisprudential debates about the imprecision or indeterminacy of rules,1 only relatively \nrecently have some authors explored the implications of this from a socio-legal perspective \n(McBarnet & Whelan 1991, 1999, Reichman 1992, McCahery & Picciotto 1995, Black 1997, \nBraithwaite & Braithwaite 1995, Lange 1999, Braithwaite 2002).  \nHowever, even socio-legal studies tend to assume that there is basic agreement on the \nmeaning of the `core\u2019 of the rules, and that any ambiguity lies in the `penumbra\u2019, or the `grey \nareas\u2019. Regulatees are generally seen as being on a continuum between the committed or \ncompliant at one end, and at the other the avoiders or evaders, those who enjoy game-playing \nor like to `play for the grey\u2019. Avoidance also tends to be seen as involving `creative \ncompliance\u2019, complying with the letter while avoiding the spirit or policy of the law \n(McBarnet 2003: 229). This again implies that those involved share a common understanding \nof the requirements of the rules. However, Valerie Braithwaite has recently asked the \nquestion `What Does it Mean to Comply?\u2019 She suggests that it is not always easy to assess \nwhether a person has done `what is asked of him or her\u2019, and that `whether or not a person \ninterprets the request in accordance with its intent is far from certain\u2019 (V. Braithwaite 2003a: \n276). This implies a different view, in which various players may have different and \ngenuinely-held understandings of a rule\u2019s meaning, and may each consider theirs the correct \nand clear meaning. \nIndeed, the existence of different understandings or interpretations of `what is required\u2019 by a \nrule is, I suggest, a frequent and even normal situation. Let us take a basic tax provision, such \nas what deductions are allowable against employment income. Even a cursory piece of \nresearch would show, I think, that taxpayers have very different understandings of `what is \nasked\u2019 of them by this rule.2 This may of course be due to a variety of factors, not least that \nfew people are enthusiastic about reading tax legislation. It must nevertheless be a concern \nfor any regulatory regime, and to researchers studying compliance with it, if there can be \ndifferent understandings or interpretations of the rules to which its subjects are expected to \nadhere. It may mean, for example, that people who regard themselves as compliant, based on \ntheir understanding of the regulatory requirements, may from the regulator\u2019s viewpoint be \navoiders or game-players.  \nThis suggests that the primary task in designing a regulatory system is to build it on \nprinciples which are widely accepted as fair and hence help foster shared understandings. The \ninstrumental view of law generally considers that compliance is best achieved by formulating \nlaw in clear language and using precise or specific rules rather than more abstract general \nprinciples. This view has been undermined by critiques, based in linguistic philosophy, which \npoint to the indeterminacy of law. Socio-legal studies generate a separate concern, that \ninstrumentalism takes a uni-directional view of compliance with law, which fails to take \naccount of the ability of legal subjects to adapt their behaviour in response to the law and to \nits application by those responsible for its enforcement.  \nThis opens a further perspective, that norms may be generated and derive their meaning \nthrough the interactions of all those involved in a social field. This has been examined in \nBettina Lange\u2019s fascinating fine-grained study of waste disposal regulation, looking \nespecially at the interaction between formal and informal rules (Lange 1999). The critique of \nindeterminacy and the view of law as a social process are inter-related in studies of regulation \nwhich view it as mediated by interpretive practices. This is captured by the term regulatory \nconversations, which has been developed by Julia Black as a metaphor for the analysis of the \nsocio-cultural interactions between regulators and regulatees (Black 1997, 1998, 2002). \nHowever, this raises the question of whether esoteric conversational communities may \n 3 \ndevelop complex regulatory fields, insulating them from input from outsiders and broader \ndemocratic debate. Indeed, the issue of indeterminacy and formalism is fundamentally about \ndemocracy, since it concerns the processes for generating the authoritative meaning of laws. \n2. Legitimacy in Tax Compliance and Avoidance \nThe problem of legitimacy of income taxation has been a key factor in the crisis of the \nKeynesian fiscal state since the mid-1970s. In many countries wage-earners became \nincreasingly reluctant to accept tax burdens which they perceived as inequitable, especially \ndue to the greater effectiveness of collection at source from employment income, compared \nwith the greater opportunities for avoidance available for income from capital, business or \nself-employment. On the other hand, it has been argued that tax burdens on business or on \nhigh earnings hinder entrepreneurship and discourage achievement, and in a world of mobile \nmoney governments have generally preferred to try to boost revenues through economic \nexpansion rather than increasing taxation of investment income. The pressures on income \ntaxation have led to widespread reforms in many countries both of tax policy and \nadministration. Policy reforms have generally entailed reducing high marginal rates of \nincome tax while attempting to broaden the tax base by ending tax breaks and combating \navoidance, as well as widening the tax net by introducing new sources of revenue such as \nsales and transaction taxes.  \nUnfortunately, the attempts at structural reform of income tax have largely failed. Although \nthe virtues of tax `neutrality\u2019 have often been extolled, in practice tax provisions have been \nextensively used for political and social engineering purposes. This produces an ever-growing \nvolume of tax law, including complex amendments to prevent the use of tax breaks in \nunintended ways. In the absence of structural reform, the attention has shifted to improving \ntax administration, involving new managerial techniques and professionalisation, with \nrevenue authorities often being given greater autonomy from government, although within a \ndefined remit. As with other areas of governance in the `new regulatory state\u20193 there has been \na shift to a culture of service delivery, with corporate plans, customer charters, and \nperformance targets (Hamilton 2003). The aim is to rebuild the confidence and trust of \ncitizens in public services, mainly through technocratic approaches to efficiency. However, as \ntax administrations are being asked to do more with fewer resources (to achieve `efficiency \ngains\u2019), there has not surprisingly been talk of a crisis in tax administration (Aaron & \nSlemrod 2004: 2-4).  \nThe new approach to regulation entails new relationships between the so-called public and \nprivate spheres which are more diverse and interactive, or `reflexive\u2019. An important feature of \ngovernance in the regulatory state is reliance on formalised rules, which increasingly replace \ninformal norms or shared understandings amongst closed groups. At the same time, the \nincreased complexity of regulatory interactions has also brought a new awareness of the \ninadequacy of instrumental views of law and regulation. Taxation has features in common \nwith other areas of economic regulation, but its particular character means that some of them \nare present in a much more extreme form. This is especially so for two key features of \nmodern tax systems, which are in many ways related. The first is their complexity, and the \nsecond is the prevalence of tax avoidance, especially when it develops to the point where it \nbecomes an elaborate `game\u2019 between tax officials and the tax `planning\u2019 industry.  \nLegal complexity comes from the attempt to draw up rules which are precise and which \nanticipate every contingency, resulting in a highly complex tax code. This derives from \nformalism:` a narrow approach to legal control - the use of clearly defined, highly \n 4 \nadministrable rules, and an emphasis on uniformity, consistency and predicatibility, on the \nlegal form of transactions and relationships and on literal interpretation.' (McBarnet & \nWhelan 1991: 849). The alternative is more general, open-ended principles which focus on \nsubstance rather than form, and are expressed purposively or in policy-oriented terms. \nHowever, this comes up against a problem endemic in liberal legality, often referred to as \nindeterminacy: that general legal rules are open to different possible interpretations. `[L]aw in \nitself is complex and elusive, open to different interpretations: its application to specific facts, \neven more so' (McBarnet & Whelan 1999: 217). It is to avoid the uncertainty created by \nbroad principles that regulators seek precision in detailed rules.  \nHowever, the formalist approach does not prevent avoidance, but shifts it to a new level, \ninvolving game-playing and `creative compliance\u2019. This has been pointed out especially by \nDoreen McBarnet and her collaborators in studies of avoidance both of tax and financial \nregulation. She has described `creative compliance\u2019 as `working to rule\u2019 (McBarnet 2003). \nEssentially, it entails recharacterising the legal form of economic transactions, in such a way \nas to avoid the purpose of the law while complying with the letter of the rule. Hence, as \nseveral commentators have pointed out, the complexity resulting from formalism also \ngenerates uncertainty (Miller 1993; Weisbach 1999; J. Braithwaite 2002, 2003a), especially if \nit results from cat-and-mouse game-playing, which generates `contrived complexity\u2019 (J. \nBraithwaite 2003a, 76). Thus, as John Braithwaite has recently argued, it may be better to \ncombine general principles and specific rules (J. Braithwaite 2002, 2003a, 2005).  \nThis paper argues a slightly different view of creative compliance, built on the insight that \nalternative interpretations of rules may each be potentially valid. Hence, a regulatory regime \nmay be `created\u2019 through the interactions of those involved, mediated by contestations about \nthe validity and legitimacy of different interpretations of rules. To consider this more closely, \nit is important first to try to clarify the issue of indeterminacy. \n3. Three Levels of Indeterminacy of Rules \nI suggest that there are three aspects or levels of indeterminacy. At the most general level, \nindeterminacy arises from the social nature of language. At least since Wittgenstein, \nlinguistic philosophy has emphasised that the meaning of words is socially constructed. \nHence, even physical objects have an ontological existence which depends on shared \nunderstandings and practices, reflected in the terms used to denote them within a particular \nlinguistic group or community. Furthermore, linguistic terms also carry a range of social \nconnotations, for example about the normal or socially acceptable uses of an object. Thus, for \nexample, specific terms may be used to denote an umbrella and a parasol because they are \ngenerally used for different purposes, although they are very similar objects and in practice \nmay be substitutable. The implications of the social construction of meaning are clearly much \ngreater for terms or statements which do not refer to sensorily verifiable objects or events, but \nto social activities, and even more to artificial concepts.4 Thus, it has been suggested that \nincome tax law is different in kind even from other laws (even other taxes, such as sales or \ntransaction taxes), because its concepts do not refer to something which exists in nature.5 This \npoint is well taken for the central concept of income, which is almost entirely artificial, \nalthough I suggest that a concept such as residence does have some relation to physical \nreality, at least as much as does that of an exchange transaction. Thus, there is less \nindeterminacy in a drunk-driving law that refers to blood-alcohol levels (although that still \ndepends on the social practices, e.g. of their measurement), than one which refers to capacity \nto drive (Endicott 2001). \n 5 \nThere are two further levels of indeterminacy of legal or regulatory rules, due to their nature \nas norms in a liberal system of regulation. Liberal legality assumes that individuals should be \nfree to decide on their own conduct provided it complies with rules of law expressed in \ngeneral terms addressed to all citizens. Regulation may involve other kinds of decision-\nmaking process, such as a requirement of prior approval, which obviously provides more \ncertainty.6 However, such a power is regarded as absolutist and illegitimate unless it is \nsubject to procedural safeguards, and exercised within a framework of rules. Nevertheless, \nthe liberal principle of individual freedom subject to the rule of law gives rise to a range of \npositions in political theory on whether it is best safeguarded by laws expressed in general \nprinciples or precise rules (J. Braithwaite 2002: 49). At one end of the spectrum is the \nassumption that the freedom of citizens is best safeguarded by ensuring that state power is \nexercised only through rules drawn as precisely and specifically as possible, and at the other \nthe view that law `must allow forms of private ordering, giving legal powers to individuals to \ncreate and to assume rights and duties in ways that are liable to be vague' (Endicott 2001: \n382). \nGeneral norms require a process of inductive-deductive reasoning, from the particular to the \ngeneral and vice versa. This gives rise to the second level of indeterminacy, the one with \nwhich lawyers are perhaps most familiar, since it is recognisable even from a positivist \nperspective on legal rules. Its most well-known exposition is in H. L. A. Hart\u2019s discussion of \nthe core meaning and the `penumbra\u2019 of legal rules (Hart 1958). This suggests that the \nbroader a legal rule the more fuzzy its core and the wider the penumbra. It also implies that \nall rules have an objective meaning at their core that is generally understood, and that it is \nonly the more or less marginal cases in the penumbra that may be doubtful. \nHowever, applying to norms the interpretive approach to language (the first level of \nindeterminacy mentioned above) suggests a third level of indeterminacy. Fuller\u2019s famous \ncritique of Hart (Fuller 1958) was essentially based on the view that legal precepts are not \nmerely positivist statements of a general character but norms, so that interpreting their \nmeaning when applying them to particular cases entails a normative judgement. Thus, \ndeciding whether a particular instance fits within a general principle is not just a factual \ninquiry but entails a value-judgement, if it concerns a legal principle. Fuller argued that this is \nnot limited to the `penumbra\u2019 of borderline or doubtful cases, but that every application of a \ngeneral rule to a particular case involves purposive interpretation. He argued for a view of \n`fidelity to the law\u2019 which would `accept the broader responsibilities (themselves purposive, \nas all responsibilities are and must be) that go with a purposive interpretation of law\u2019 (Fuller \n1958: 670).  \nThe implication of this is that even the core meaning of a legal norm depends on a shared \nview of the values or purposes which underlie it. Differing views about those values will \nresult in different interpretations of the meaning of the norm, which are equally potentially \nacceptable. Fuller\u2019s concern was with the responsibility of judges in applying legal rules. For \nhim, the judges\u2019 responsibility in interpreting laws included a responsibility to uphold certain \ncore values of what law should be, and not simply applying the law `as it is\u2019.  \nThe Hart-Fuller debate centred on the relationship between law and morality, in that Fuller \nargued that the meaning given to a legal rule is inseparable from the moral values it is \nconsidered to embody, whereas Hart\u2019s essentially formalist view was that legal and moral \nreasoning could (and should) be separated. I suggest that a more helpful view comes from an \nunderstanding that epistemology is relative and based on different social practices, which \nnevertheless interact within society as a whole. The problem of formalism comes from a type \n 6 \nof reasoning that assumes that social behaviour can be comprehended in terms of the internal \nrationality of a particular social practice (law, morality, economics, science) without \nreference to other perspectives.  \nThis is exemplified in legal adjudication by the literal approach to rules, which asserts that \nthey should be understood according to their `natural\u2019, `ordinary\u2019, or `normal\u2019 meaning, in \ntheir `context\u2019, which generally means the linguistic context of the particular words. This \nimplies that the legal meaning can be directly related to common social practices and \nunderstandings (unless the term itself is recognised as deriving from a particular technical \nsphere). From this perspective, the moral (or economic, or political) purpose of a rule is \nirrelevant in understanding its meaning. The literal approach to interpretation is generally \ncontrasted with the purposive approach, which suggests that the specific words of a \nlegislative provision should be interpreted in accordance with the general purpose of the \nlegislation. This goes some way towards cognitive openness, in that it obliges the interpreter \nof the rule (usually a judge) to articulate the policy implications of the possible interpretations \nof the rule, and to select among them by reference to the objectives of the legislature. In the \nUK the courts have historically preferred the literal approach, especially in tax cases, \nalthough there has been some shift recently towards purposiveness (Avery Jones 1996).  \nTo the extent that there are shared understandings among the various practitioners involved in \nthe law, the indeterminacy of the rules may be greatly reduced, but only within that closed \ngroup. If a legal rule refers to a more widely understood or experienced ontologically \nverifiable object, or even a common social activity, indeterminacy may also be reduced. \nHowever, legal reasoning which remains closed to wider social practices and understandings \nrelies for its legitimacy simply on the authority of lawyers as technical specialists. A wider, \nand indeed more democratic, legitimacy comes from adopting a more open epistemology, \nwhich acknowledges that legal rules have a wider social resonance and impact, and that their \nunderstanding must be informed by wider social practices, especially those of the persons to \nwhom they are addressed. This is likely to be important to the legitimacy and hence stability \nof an interactive regulatory process or system. \n4. Constructing Compliance \nLooking more broadly at regulatory systems as social processes, we can say that \ninterpretative judgements are made about rules or regulations by all those involved: by those \nwho are expected to comply with the regulation, the specialists who they may consult for \nadvice about it, and the officials tasked with monitoring compliance. Each person\u2019s \nunderstanding of a regulation will to some extent depend on what they think it should mean, \nand this will affect how far they are willing to accept what another person thinks it means. \nTheir interactions involve negotiations about these meanings, `regulatory conversations\u2019 to \nuse Black\u2019s term, which in one way or another may result in shared understandings about the \nmeaning of the rules. How far they do so, however, greatly depends on a shared acceptance \nof the values or purposes which underlie them, since they are by their nature normative. \nHence, `constructing compliance\u2019 with a regulation entails more than persuading those who \nare subject to it to ensure that their conduct complies with the regulation. It entails \nconstructing a shared view of what the regulation itself means. A stable and effective \nregulatory system therefore is one in which such acceptance is as broad as possible. This will \nminimise the extent of disagreement or contestation about the meaning of the regulations.  \n 7 \nThe points made above about the indeterminacy of rules, should also be considered in terms \nof the sociological analysis of fields of regulation. As Mark Tushnet has pointed out, the \nindeterminacy thesis is not simply an argument in analytic jurisprudence, but one of political \nor social theory (Tushnet 1996: 339). The `construction\u2019 of a regulatory field is a social \nprocess, mediated by interpretative practices. Thus, Pierre Bourdieu has discussed the \npractices of interpretation of legal texts, involving the appropriation of the `symbolic power \nwhich is potentially contained within the text\u2019, in terms of competitive struggles to `control\u2019 \nthe legal text (Bourdieu 1987: 818). However, he suggests that coherence emerges partly \nthrough the social organization of the field, and partly because to succeed competing \ninterpretations must be presented `as the necessary result of a principled interpretation of \nunanimously accepted texts\u2019 (ibid. ). This explains the apparent paradox that, while lawyers \nspend much of their time disagreeing about the meaning of texts, they often do so from an \nobjectivist perspective. They generally deny that indeterminacy is inherent, and tend to \nattribute disagreements to bad drafting and lack of clarity in the texts, which are said to create \n`loopholes\u2019 in the logical fabric of the law, although it is legal arguments that generate the \nloopholes as well as constituting the warp and weft of law.  \nFinally, we should remember that legal and regulatory practices operate upon and in the \ncontext of the overall social fields which they help to regularise. Thus, while Bourdieu points \nto `the relatively autonomous creative capacity of the law which the existence of its \nspecialized field of production makes possible\u2019, he stresses that `[t]he shaping of practices \nthrough juridical formalisation can succeed only to the extent that legal organisation gives \nexplicit form to a tendency already immanent within those practices\u2019, since ` [t]he rules \nwhich succeed are those which, as we say, regularise factual situations consonant with them\u2019 \n(Bourdieu 1987, 848-9).  \nThe important point here is that contestation of the meaning of norms is generated from \ndisagreements about what they should mean, for the social practices which they seek to \nregulate or `regularise\u2019. The parties may not know that they do not have a shared \nunderstanding; or some or all of them may realise that different views exist, and may seek to \nadvance their own view as the correct one. Hence it may be a misnomer to describe such \ncontests as `game-playing\u2019. A game generally relies on a very strong shared understanding \nbetween the players of the purpose and meaning of the rules. Thus, the term `game-playing\u2019 \nimplies an instrumental view of rules, rather than an interpretive view.  \nB. CONSTRUCTING INTERNATIONAL TAXATION \n1. Contested Norms in International Taxation \nThe taxation of income or profit from international business is a field which has become \nincreasingly complex, and rife with avoidance game-playing, especially in recent years. \nHowever, its basic principles were the subject of some debate from the earliest days when \nincome tax began to replace indirect taxation, especially import duties, to become the centre-\npiece of the fiscal constitution of the 20th century welfare-warfare state, in which Britain led \nthe way (Daunton 2001). From the viewpoint of the British state, fairness required taxation of \nresidents on their income from all sources, and of non-residents on income from UK sources. \nWhen incorporation began to be more widely used in the last part of the 19th century, it \nbecame necessary to interpret the application of these provisions to those companies formed \nin the UK whose activities largely took place abroad. From the 1870s on, decisions taken by \nthe Inland Revenue on these matters were resisted by some companies, and ultimately \nreferred for authoritative decisions by the courts. The issues were, when should a company be \n 8 \nregarded as `resident\u2019 in the UK, and what income should be regarded as attributable to a \ncompany, as well as how to characterize such income (due to the schedular structure of the \nUK income tax).7  \nOn the question of `residence\u2019, the decisive precedent was set by the case involving the De \nBeers mining company, which was formed under South African law; not only that, but the \nhead office and all the mining activities of the company were at Kimberley, and the general \nmeetings were held there. Nevertheless, the House of Lords held that the company was a \nBritish resident, since `the directors' meetings in London are the meetings where the real \ncontrol is always exercised in practically all the important business of the company except the \nmining operations\u2019(De Beers 1906: 213). In the way of English judges, this decision was put \nforward as flowing from a common-sense interpretation of the term `resident\u2019. The Lord \nChancellor stated: `In applying the conception of residence to a Company, we ought, I think, \nto proceed as nearly as we can upon the analogy of an individual. A Company cannot eat or \nsleep, but it can keep house and do business. We ought, therefore, to see where it really keeps \nhouse and does business. An individual may be of foreign nationality, and yet reside in the \nUnited Kingdom. So may a Company.\u2019 (Ibid. 212-3). \nIn deciding that company residence depended on the location of its main shareholders, this \nreasoning ignored or overlooked the implications for the way global business was organised \nand financed. Some of the earlier court decisions had at least appreciated the implications of \nthe issue for Britain as the world\u2019s leading source of international investment at the time. \nThus, in 1876 Chief Baron Kelly showed an acute awareness that the cases involved `the \ninternational law of the world\u2019, since many of the shareholders were foreign residents, so that \nmuch of the earnings of the company belonged to individuals not living in Britain and \ntherefore `not within the jurisdiction of its laws\u2019. However, he contented himself with the \nthought that if such foreigners chose to place their money in British companies, they `must \npay the cost of it\u2019 (Calcutta Jute 1876: 88). \nThe issue looked very different from the viewpoint of some of the leaders of British \ninternational business. This was expressed perhaps most clearly by Sir William Vestey, who \nwas to become well-known in UK tax law, and whose grocers\u2019 firm had grown by importing \neggs from China and beef from Argentina. He argued for fairness in relation to his \ninternational competitors, and proposed a global approach based on the proportion of sales in \neach country. \n`In a business of this nature you cannot say how much is made in one country and \nhow much is made in another. You kill an animal and the product of that animal is \nsold in 50 different countries. You cannot say how much is made in England and how \nmuch is made abroad. That is why I suggest that you should pay a turnover tax on \nwhat is brought into this country. ... It is not my object to escape payment of tax. My \nobject is to get equality of taxation with the foreigner, and nothing else.\u20198 \nHowever, the British state was reluctant to modify its claim to tax all British residents (and \ncompanies based in the UK) on all their income, except by international agreement, which \nwould take some time. Meantime, the Revenue was left to trying to apply the principle of \nresidence based on the test of `central management and control\u2019 laid down by the courts. The \ndecision in De Beers rejected the alternative test, put forward on behalf of the company, of \nthe place of incorporation, on the grounds that this could easily be avoided `by the simple \nexpedient of being registered abroad and distributing its dividends abroad\u2019 (De Beers 1906: \n213). But the control test could also be avoided: indeed the Vestey group had moved its \n 9 \nheadquarters to Argentina in 1915 to avoid being taxed at British wartime rates on its \nworldwide business. Sir William had said he would like to come back to Britain to live work \nand die; but as his tax proposals were not accepted, not surprisingly, the Vesteys (and other \nfirms) took steps to organise their affairs to ensure that they were not, as they saw it, unfairly \nsubjected to tax. This involved ensuring that their foreign business was carried out by entities \nwhich could not be said to be resident in the UK. Indeed, they went further, and with the help \nof tax advisers, set up a scheme centred on a trust formed in Paris, which could receive \nprofits from their global business and make payments to members of the Vestey family at the \ndiscretion of the trustees (Knightley 1993). When the Revenue eventually discovered this, it \nsecured legislation in 1936-8 to tax the income of such foreign trusts. But to be effective, this \nextended to all such `sheltered\u2019 income, even if not paid over to a UK-resident beneficiary, \ngiving the Revenue very broad discretionary powers, which was later denounced by an \neminent tax lawyer as `preposterous\u2019 and amounting to a `suspension of the rule of law\u2019 \n(Sumption 1982: 116, 138). The validity of these provisions, as well as subsequent legislative \namendments, occupied lawyers and the courts profitably for many years. Indeed, the Vesteys \nscored two significant victories, although they had to take their cases to the House of Lords, \nand the judges at various levels disagreed with each other. In the hundreds of pages of \njudicial reasoning it is hard to discern any issues of principle, and the decisions turned on \npoints such as whether the beneficiaries could be said to have a `power to enjoy\u2019 income \n(Vestey's Executors 1949: 69), whether a reference to a person could include more than one \nbeneficiary (ibid.), and whether the provisions could extend to beneficiaries other than the \noriginal transferor of the assets (Vestey 1979). \nThus, the `game\u2019 of international tax avoidance was born early in the 20th century, out of \ndisputes over the fairness of the basis for taxation of international business income. These \ndifferent perspectives could be used to justify different interpretations of the basic principles \nsuch as `residence\u2019 and `source\u2019 of income. International coordination did develop, although \nonly slowly. However, the tax specialists who tackled the issue rejected a global approach \nalong the lines suggested by William Vestey, because they considered that it would not be \npossible to reach political agreement among states, especially on the formula for allocating \nglobal income (Picciotto 1992: 27-37). Instead, a network of bilateral tax treaties grew, based \non internationally agreed models, which allocated rights to tax based on residence and source. \nThis entailed treating activities which from a business perspective might be globally \nintegrated as if they were carried out by separate unrelated entities.  \nCreative Jurisdictionality \nAlthough this process was in some respects one of cat-and-mouse game-playing, I suggest \nthat to see it only in this way is a mischaracterization. The various interactions between the \ntax authorities and the professional advisers of internationally-operating businesses over a \nlong period of time helped to construct the international tax system. Thus, the claim to tax the \nworldwide profit of residents was mitigated by the introduction of foreign tax credit \narrangements. However, this still meant that profits earned abroad in a low-tax country could \nbe subject to the higher rate of tax of the country of residence of the investor, which was \nconsidered unfair by transnational corporations (TNCs). Hence, they developed more \nsophisticated versions of many of the devices pioneered by wealthy families such as the \nVesteys, by establishing affiliates incorporated in convenient jurisdictions to shelter such \nforeign-source income, enabling retained earnings to benefit from a lower tax rate. Many \nwent further and used such intermediaries as channels to provide financial or service \nfunctions for the corporate group, enabling them to reduce the taxable profits of operating \n 10 \naffiliates by deductions of interest charges, management fees, royalties for intellectual \nproperty, or insurance premiums. Such schemes were of more dubious legitimacy, depending \non the acceptability of the claim that the functions are validly carried out by separate entities \nand actually in those locations, if the companies exist in effect only on paper.  \nTo combat such devices, most developed countries enacted anti-avoidance legislation: for \nexample, to bring `captive\u2019 affiliates within residence rules, by treating the income of \n`controlled foreign corporations\u2019 (CFCs) as attributable to their parent companies. However, \nthe requirement of `control\u2019 for CFCs must be defined, often by complex rules, and the \nattributable income is generally limited to `passive\u2019 investment income. This accepts that \nsome group functions or services can be provided to other parts of the TNC if they may \narguably be said to be carried out `offshore\u2019 (and hence produce `active\u2019 income), such as \nshipping management, or insurance and other financial services. The jurisdictions of \nconvenience, or tax havens, have therefore been further transformed into `offshore financial \ncentres\u2019. They have crafted special laws, often on the advice of specialists in corporate tax \nplanning, which take advantage of the room for interpretation in other countries\u2019 legislation. \nThus international tax avoidance, or `planning\u2019, has become a complex field centring on the \nnegotiation of the legitimacy and validity of business and financial arrangements in an \nincreasingly complex maze of different national rules and their interactions. What constitutes \ncompliance continues to be negotiated. The underlying reason is the inherent contestability of \nthe principle of jurisdictional allocation based on treating the components of a global firm as \nif they were separate entities. The principle is contestable because it does not embody a \ngenerally accepted criterion of fairness for that allocation.  \nThe alternative approach of global unitary taxation of TNCs based on formula apportionment \nhas sometimes been put forward, but has generally been rejected by both tax administrators \nand business representatives. Certainly such an approach would, in principle, provide a much \nsounder basis for agreement on principles which could be recognised as fair to all taxpayers \nand states. However, most international tax experts remain fearful of an open debate on such \nprinciples of fairness, because they consider it too difficult to achieve political agreement.9 A \nperhaps cynical view would be that they have too much intellectual capital invested in the \ncomplex and arcane system which has grown up historically.  \nThere are genuine issues and disagreements about the definition and jurisdictional allocation \nof the income from international business, which are fought out in these struggles to `control \nthe text\u2019. The problem is that these issues have become largely obscured because the lack of \nany general principle of fairness in jurisdictional allocation means that the texts are so \ncomplex and esoteric that they are accessible only to a small number of specialists. Even \nthese experts would find it hard to explain the underlying justification for many of the rules.  \nFormalism also derives from the disjuncture between the conversations about the rules which \nremain internal to tax specialists, and debate in the general public policy arena (which could \nalso involve contributions from other specialists such as economists). International taxation is \nnow a hot policy issue, and debates about it are conducted in language which is also highly \ncontested. Terms such as `tax havens\u2019, `harmful tax competition\u2019, and even `passive income\u2019 \nor `high net worth investors\u2019 are deployed for their symbolic effects; but these contests are \nhard if not impossible to connect with the specific issues dealt with in the esoteric language \nsurrounding for example the definition of `controlled foreign corporation\u2019.  \n 11 \nThe result is both to impoverish the policy debate, and to cut away the political and moral \nconsiderations which should underpin the specialist practices of those involved with tax \ncompliance. These are the structural reasons which turn a regulatory culture into one of \ngame-playing. The tax avoidance `game\u2019 is one in which the players seek to interpret the \nrules to their advantage, but in a formalist and technicist manner, that is to say by referring \nonly to the apparent internal logic of the rule-system, without feeling any need to justify their \ninterpretation of a rule by reference to broader considerations. Those involved may consider \nthey are simply doing a professional job, but to outsiders they are acting in a cynical and \namoral manner. The problem of formalism is due not merely to the detailed nature of the \nrules, but to their being dislocated from any justifying rationale, a generally accepted \nprinciple of fairness. \nC. LEGITIMACY, COMPLEXITY AND COMPLIANCE \nThe preceding analysis might help to illuminate some of the current debates about how to \nimprove the tax regulatory system. The general concern to improve compliance by improving \ntaxpayer confidence in the fairness of the system is linked to the need to find ways to reduce \nthe opportunities for avoidance, and in particular to end the cynical perspective on tax rules \nthat is entailed in game-playing. The difficulty is that the complex rules have been enacted \nand seem to be needed in order to combat avoidance. Thus, although many of the leading \ncommon-law countries have embarked on tax simplification exercises, little progress has \nbeen made in reducing complexity.  \nThere is ample evidence that taxpayer compliance largely depends on having a favourable \nattitude towards the tax system, and in particular on considering that it is on the whole a fair \nand just system (V. Braithwaite 2003a; Rawlings 2003; V. Braithwaite 2003b). Acceptance \nof the fairness of taxation may derive from an identification with the state and a general \nconfidence that its tax system treats everyone equitably. There is also evidence that such a \ngeneralized acceptance is undermined in a period of rapid social change, especially such as \nthat experienced in recent years (termed globalisation) which has tended to dissolve the \n`imagined communities\u2019 of nationhood. In these circumstances, tax authorities must seek \nmore refined means of maintaining or re-establishing taxpayers\u2019 confidence in the tax system \nand its integrity. An important aspect of this is certainly procedural fairness: compliance is \nmore likely if taxpayers feel they have been treated respectfully, honestly and impartially \n(Murphy 2003).  \nTax Law Clarification, Simplification and Reform \nDebate in recent years has focused on tax reform and simplification as a means of restoring \nconfidence in the fairness of tax systems. Many a Treasury minister has vowed to simplify \nthe tax laws. Such promises have sometimes resulted in tax reviews, and occasionally even in \nreforming legislation. Some reforms achieve a degree of success, but it seems to have been \ndifficult, if not impossible, to achieve the triple aims of (i) greater clarity, (ii) less complexity \nand (iii) a simpler and fairer tax structure.  \nThe US prioritised structural reform, and its Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to reduce the \ncomplexity of the system and not just to improve clarity. However, it has been shown that \nalthough it `did deliver some important simplifications\u2019 it `did not turn the tide of growing \ncomplexity of the tax system\u2019 (Slemrod 1992: 55). In contrast, Australia\u2019s Tax Law \nImprovement Project, initiated in 1993, aimed mainly at clarification. Its first project was \nlegislation to simplify the `substantiation\u2019 rules for claiming expenses as deductions from \n 12 \nsalary income, which were reduced from 19,000 to 11,000 words; however the initial \nevaluation seems uncertain whether the result was easier to understand (James & \nWallschutzky 1997: 453, 457). A more radical approach was proposed in the paper on Tax \nReform \u2013 not a new Tax, a New Tax System (1998); this called for an integrated tax code, \nwhich would `use general principles in preference to long and detailed provisions\u2019 (p.149). \nHowever, the impetus for simplification was overtaken by the debates generated by major tax \nchanges, notably the controversial General Sales Tax.  \nIn the UK, although there has been much debate about both structural reform and reduction of \ncomplexity, the only progress made has been on clarification. The Tax Law Rewrite project \nhas laboured since 1995,10 and has resulted so far in five statutes on income tax, after which \nits attention will turn to corporation tax. Even its political progenitor admits that, although it \ncould be said to have improved the quality of tax legislation, it has not reduced its quantity, \nwhile the annual Finance Act continues to add an enormous and uncontrollable number of \npages of tax legislation (Howe 2001). Thus the exercise seems very like a classic case of \nrepainting the Forth bridge. Its effects will not be felt outside a very small circle of tax \nlawyers, as a recent independent evaluation of one of the `clarified\u2019 statutes confirmed that \neven accountants and in-house tax specialists rarely look at the legislation itself (MORI \n2006). \nSimplification: the Purpose of Principles and the Utility of Rules \nWhile structural reform is hampered by political conflicts (and economic inequalities), there \nseems little point in pursuing clarification without simplification (Owens & Hamilton 2004: \n350). This has, however, been bedevilled by the concern that simplification would endanger \nclarity by reducing certainty. More recently, discussion has centred on the relative merits of \nlaws cast in terms of general principles as against detailed rules.  \nSome commentators have suggested that new ways can be found to combine the advantages \nof general purposive principles with the precision of more detailed rules. Thus, John Avery \nJones has suggested a hierarchy, with overarching purposive principles at the top, less \ndetailed legislation below, and Revenue rulings to deal with specifics (Jones 1996). \nAcknowledging that this would entail a far-reaching transformation of British legal and \nregulatory culture, he expressed the hope that the catalyst might be provided by the influence \nof European Community law.11 John Braithwaite has also argued convincingly that tax law \nshould be designed along these lines, with overarching binding principles supported by non-\nbinding detailed rules (J. Braithwaite 2003a, 2005). He emphasises in particular the need for \na general anti-avoidance principle, in order to deter the `contrived complexity\u2019 resulting from \ntax avoidance especially by the rich. Judith Freedman has also lent her weight to the proposal \nthat a General Anti-Avoidance Principle12 should be enacted in the UK, bringing it into line \nwith other countries, such as Australia and Canada (Freedman 2004).13 Instead, the UK has \npreferred to introduce administrative procedures for notification of avoidance schemes, which \nraise their own questions and tactical games over what needs to be notified. \nThe analysis in this paper also supports proposals to base tax law on purposive principles \ncombined with detailed rules. It would, however, seem undesirable that the first or only \ngeneral principle should be on anti-avoidance.14 Authors such as John Braithwaite and Judith \nFreedman argue, in my view correctly, that more certainty could be provided by a tax code \nbased on broad general principles, supplemented by more detailed rules which could emerge \nfrom regulatory conversations between tax authorities and taxpayers or their advisers. Thus, \nFreedman suggests that a general anti-avoidance rule `would facilitate a debate around the \n 13 \nmeaning of the difficult concept of tax avoidance which could be pursued between the \ntaxpaying community and revenue authorities\u2019 (Freedman 2004: 357).  \nHowever, the analysis put forward here suggests that it is essential, not optional, to begin by \nformulating general principles in the substantive areas of tax law, which should adequately \nexpress a widely accepted principle of fairness or equity in relation to that type of tax. A \ngeneral anti-avoidance rule itself may not help to guide tax planners as to what is acceptable \nsince, as Nabil Orow has pointed out, the complexity of the tax laws as a whole has led to the \ninvention of such fantastical tax-driven financing devices that ` tax lawyers and specialists \nhave lost their sense and grasp of reality\u2019 (Orow 2004: 412). \nTax reform should not be viewed as a technical exercise. Nor can the vicious circle of game-\nplaying and complexity be broken by introducing a general principle of adherence to the \nspirit of tax rules, if that spirit is not itself expressed in terms of broad and generally accepted \nprinciples. Regulatory conversations may not help to improve the quality of regulation if they \nare conducted only within closed circles of experts. Indeed, such specialist communities may \ngenerate their own esoteric language in which to negotiate interpretations of the rules. They \nmay therefore remain impervious to attempts to introduce transparency by formal measures, \nsuch as publication of technical documents and consultation. Disagreements about the \nnormative underpinnings of the rules may result in game-playing and hence complexity. Both \nspecialist language and regulatory complexity may develop partly as a defence mechanism, \nthrough a misplaced lack of trust that public debate and political processes can help resolve \nnormative conflicts. \nAs this paper has shown, indeterminacy results not merely from the inherent ambiguities of \nlanguage, but from different normative perceptions. Hence, there are real limits to what can \nbe achieved merely by redrafting existing regulations. Articulating the fairness principles \nunderlying tax law should clearly be part of a wider democratic deliberation, including tax \nlaw reform. At the same time, a shift towards discussing taxation in terms of general fairness \nprinciples instead of the arcane complexities of detailed rules may also make a significant \ncontribution to such a democracy. \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nAaron, Henry J. and Slemrod, Joel (2004) The crisis in tax administration.

A first version of this paper was drafted during an all-too-short visit of four weeks to the Centre for Tax \nSystem Integrity at the Australian National University, and presented to a seminar attended by staff of the \nAustralian Tax Office and the Treasury; a subsequent version was published as a CTSI Working Paper. My \ngrateful thanks to John Braithwaite and all his colleagues at RegNet for the opportunity to work in such a \nstimulating and friendly environment, and more specifically to Val Braithwaite and her colleagues in the CTSI, \nespecially Jenny Job and Greg Rawlings, and to ATO and Treasury staff, for all their help, comments, and \ndiscussions.  \n1 For a recent discussion see Endicott 2001 and other papers in the same issue of the journal. \n2 I am not aware of any scientific empirical research on this question. However, I would urge any doubting \nreader to try asking any half-dozen or more friends or colleagues (as I have done), what their understanding is of \nthe deduction rule. I have found qualitatively significant variations even among a group of tax researchers.  \n3 Many writers have used the term or the general concept (notably Teubner 1987, Majone 1993, Pildes and \nSunstein 1995, Loughlin 1997, Braithwaite 2000, Scott 2000), and with different actual states in mind; clearly \nthe changes are far from uniform but vary greatly between different national contexts (for a recent comparative \noverview see Jordana & Levi-Faur 2004). Nor do they lead to a settled or even clearly identifiable outcome: \nindeed, Michael Moran argues that a key feature, at least of the British regulatory state, is `hyper-innovation\u2019 \n(Moran 2003). Most recently, John Braithwaite has explicitly applied the concept to the area of tax \nadministration (J. Braithwaite 2005).  \n4 I should perhaps say that I adopt a critical realist perspective which posits an objectivist ontology but a \nrelativist epistemology, i.e. that reality can only be understood through the different perceptions of the various \nactors involved. Thus, our shared perceptions of the natural world provide a firmer common grasp of its reality, \nunderstandings of social activities are likely to be more relativistic, while shared understandings of abstract \nconcepts must be generated by socio-linguistic practices. \n 18 \n                                                                                                                                                  \n5 Prebble 1998: 113; prior to the emergence of the modern income tax, of course, direct taxes were levied on the \nindicia of wealth, such as windows, or carriages. \n6 For example, theatre performance was not liberalised in Britain until the requirement of prior approval of \nscripts by the Lord Chamberlain under the Stage Licensing Act of 1737 was ended in 1968. In the field of \ntaxation, relative certainty is sometimes achieved by giving the tax authorities the power to determine whether a \nproposed arrangement is liable to tax, although such a determination is not usually final.  \n7 Different categories of income were (and still are) taxed differently according the Schedule and Case to which \nthey might be attributed; in particular income or profits of a trade were taxable as they arose, while income from \nsecurities or possessions were taxable only when remitted to the UK. Thus, UK shareholders of a foreign-\nresident company would only be liable for UK tax on dividends remitted to the UK; whereas if the company \nitself were regarded as UK resident, its worldwide trading profits would be regarded as directly taxable in the \nUK. For further details of the court decisions and interpretations involved see Picciotto 1992, 6-8.  \n8 UK Royal Commission on Income Tax, Evidence, p. 452, Question 9460. \n9 Taxation on a unitary basis has been applied by the component states in a federal system, notably in the USA; \nhowever, a strong campaign was waged in the 1970s and 1980s against its extension globally (Picciotto 1992: \n241-9). More recently, the European Commission has proposed taxation of business operating in the single \nEuropean market on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (European Commission 2001); although this \nis viewed with scepticism by national Treasury officials, it has some support among business representatives \n(interview information).  \n10  Its aim is `to rewrite all (or most) of the United Kingdom\u2019s existing primary direct tax legislation to make it \nclearer and easier to use, without changing or making less certain its general effect\u2019 see \nhttp:\/\/www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\/rewrite\/. \n11 It does seem to be the case that the problem of complexity or `hyper-lexis\u2019 is peculiar to common-law \ncountries, perhaps for a combination of reasons which there is no space to consider here. \n 19 \n                                                                                                                                                  \n12 Freedman has suggested the admittedly ugly acronym GANTIP for this, since GAAP is understood to refer to \nUS accounting principles, and the alternative of GAAR which is often used runs counter to the distinction \nbetween general principles and specific rules. \n13 The proposal has developed into an interesting and typically British process of constitutional evolution (or \nbuck-passing). The House of Lords, having appeared to take the bold step of introducing such a principle in its \ndecisions in Ramsay (1982) and Furniss (1984), has now recast it as a principle of purposive interpretation, \nsince it does not consider itself to have the constitutional power to introduce a general overarching interpretative \nprinciple (MacNiven 2003). Meantime, the government declined to put a proposal for such a general principle to \nthe legislature (apparently bowing to business pressures), but has instead introduced a procedure requiring \nnotification to the Revenue of new tax planning devices; the statutory power for this is drafted in impossibly \nwide terms, so its effectiveness will depend on the more detailed regulatory requirements, which have been \nmore narrowly drafted (Richards 2004). It has been suggested that there is no need for a legislated anti-\navoidance principle, as sufficient resources are available in the common law (Simpson 2004); while the judicial \nshift to purposive interpretation of existing tax law without a legislated anti-avoidance principle is likely to \nfavour the taxpayer (Tiley 2004). \n14 Anti-avoidance principles (or the requirement to show a commercial justification rather than a tax-reduction \nmotive) are already present in specific parts of UK tax law, and have been shown to operate with `reasonable \nobjectivity\u2019 (Kessler 2004). This supports the view that it is the particular parts of tax law that need to be drafted \nin terms of purposive principles. \n"}
