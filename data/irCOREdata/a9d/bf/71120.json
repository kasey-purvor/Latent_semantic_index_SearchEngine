We report on the observation of two distinct cold\n(Ti<5 keV), dense (Ni>2 cm\u22123) ion populations at geosyn-\nchronous orbit. A statistical study was performed on mea-\nsurements from the geosynchronous Los Alamos plasma in-\nstruments, for the period 1990\u20132004, and complemented\nby corresponding large-scale plasma sheet data obtained by\nmapping DMSP observations in the tail. The first popula-\ntion, which has previously been reported in several studies,\nis observed in the midnight region of geosynchronous or-\nbit. The second population, which has drawn less attention,\nis detected on the dawn side of geosynchronous orbit. No\nsuch cold, dense population is observed on the dusk side\nof geosynchronous orbit on a frequent basis. The tempo-\nral evolution of various plasma parameters as a function of\nlocal time shows that the two populations appear at geosyn-\nchronous orbit as distinct populations, since the appearance\nof a midnight population is not usually associated with that\nof a dawn population, and vice versa. The midnight ion pop-\nulation is typically observed after the IMF has been north-\nward for some time and is convected inward toward geosyn-\nchronous orbit after an observed mild southward turning of\nthe average IMF. It is interpreted that the source of the mid-\nnight population is the cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS).\nThe dawn-side cold and dense ion population is associated\nwith previously strong southward IMF and consequently oc-\ncurs during substantial geomagnetic activity. These events\nare typically observed around the end of the main phase of\nthe corresponding Dst decrease, down to \u221250 nT on aver-\nage. It is unlikely that this dawn population is simply the\nlow-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) moving closer to Earth\nCorrespondence to: B. Lavraud\n(lavraud@lanl.gov)\nbecause (1) no symmetric dusk population is observed and\n(2) on average a small sunward flow (\u223c15 km\/s) is observed\nfor those events. The cold, dense population at dawn is thus\nobserved during active times (based on Dst , Kp and AE\nindices) in comparison with the midnight case. However,\nsince the dawn population is observed only around the end\nof the main Dst decrease, it is concluded that this population\ndoes not typically contribute to the Dst decrease during the\nmain phase. This population may rather be transported to\ngeosynchronous orbit by means of a compression and con-\nvection enhancement in the magnetosphere, with a preferen-\ntial access from the dawn flank with no apparent counterpart\nat dusk. DMSP data suggest that a cold and dense plasma\nsource is mainly present at dawn.\nKeywords.

The former index is a proxy for the convection elec-\ntric field strength (e.g., Thomsen, 2005) while the latter gives\nan estimate of the ring current strength (Dessler and Parker,\n1959; Vasyliunas, 2006). The Dst and Kp indices are further\nlinked to conditions upstream in the solar wind, as a result of\nthe large-scale coupling between Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and\nthe solar wind (e.g., Burton et al., 1975).\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3452 B. Lavraud et al.: Observation of two distinct cold, dense ion populations at geosynchronous orbit\nThe occasional observation of cold and dense plasma sheet\nat geosynchronous orbit has been noted in several studies\n(e.g., Thomsen et al., 2003; Lavraud et al., 2005). It has been\nsuggested in particular that the density of the plasma sheet\nhaving access to the inner magnetosphere through geosyn-\nchronous orbit may have an impact on the ensuing magne-\ntospheric activity (e.g., Borovsky et al., 1998; Jordanova et\nal., 1998; Kozyra et al., 1998; Thomsen et al., 1998). The\nstudies by Thomsen et al. (2003) and Lavraud et al. (2005)\nshowed that the observation of cold and dense plasma at\ngeosynchronous orbit is likely due to the inward transport\nof the cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS) that is occasionally\nobserved in the tail of the magnetosphere (c.f. Lennartsson\nand Shelley, 1986; Zwolakowska et al., 1992; Terasawa et\nal., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 1998; Phan et al., 2000). Be-\ncause of its composition, the CDPS has been attributed a so-\nlar wind origin (Lennartsson, 1992). Its formation strongly\ndepends on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction,\nbeing typically observed after long periods of northward IMF\n(Terasawa et al., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 2002). Two main\nmechanisms have been proposed to account for its forma-\ntion: (1) solar wind plasma penetration via Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability at the flank magnetopause (Fujimoto et al., 1998;\nHasegawa et al., 2004) and (2) solar wind \u201cdirect\u201d capture on\nnewly closed field lines at the dayside magnetopause, by dou-\nble high-latitude reconnection of magnetosheath field lines\n(Song and Russell, 1992; Raeder et al., 1997; \u00d8ieroset et al.,\n2005; Lavraud et al., 2006a). Also, it is noted that events\nof \u201csuper-dense\u201d plasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit are\nnot always unusually cold (Borovsky et al., 1997; Thomsen\net al., 2003; Lavraud et al., 2005). These have been inter-\npreted as the result of different solar wind conditions, e.g.,\nnon-northward IMF but dense solar wind, possibly associ-\nated with different plasma sheet formation mechanisms and\nprocessing (transport and acceleration) in the magnetotail.\nGeosynchronous spacecraft are located at the inner edge of\nthe plasma sheet and therefore constitute ideal tools for ex-\nploring the transport of plasma populations to the inner mag-\nnetosphere. From geosynchronous observations, Borovsky\net al. (1997) showed that the plasma sheet typically has den-\nsities in the range 0.4\u20132 cm\u22123, with an average density of\n0.7 cm\u22123 in the midnight region. They also put forth the\nappearance of a distinct higher density distribution above\n2 cm\u22123, which they referred to as \u201csuper-dense\u201d plasma sheet\nevents. Lavraud et al. (2005) focused on the access of such\ndense plasma populations to geosynchronous orbit. They\nshowed that dense plasma observations primarily occur in\nthe midnight region of geosynchronous orbit, presumably as\na result of modestly enhanced convection leading to plasma\nsheet inward transport. They only focused on the occurrence\nof high density plasma and noted the frequent appearance of\na dense plasma population at dawn of geosynchronous orbit\nas well, which appeared to have generally low temperatures.\nA similar population appeared in earlier analyses (e.g., Korth\net al., 1999; Denton et al., 2005) but received no particular\nattention then.\nFujimoto et al. (2002, 2005) noted that the cold, dense\nplasma sheet (with densities above 1 cm\u22123 and temperatures\nbelow 2 keV) in the mid-tail regions may be observed equally\nat dawn and dusk. By contrast, a hotter (>2 keV) and dense\npopulation (hot, dense ions; HDI) is often detected at the in-\nner edge of the CDPS on the dawn side, but not on the dusk\nside. In the present follow up of the study by Lavraud et\nal. (2005), we investigate the occurrence of both dense and\ncold ion populations at geosynchronous orbit. We particu-\nlarly focus on the appearance of distinct populations at mid-\nnight and dawn. We analyze geosynchronous, solar wind,\ngeomagnetic activity, and DMSP data to obtain clues on (1)\nthe local time distribution of the access of these plasma pop-\nulations, (2) their respective origin and transport path, and\n(3) their potential impact on magnetospheric dynamics.\nIn the next section, we present the data used in this study\nand the processing methods. In Sect. 3, we present the results\nof the analysis, which we discuss in Sect. 4. Section 5 draws\nthe conclusions.\n2 Instrumentation and data processing\n2.1 Los Alamos geosynchronous data\nWe use ion and electron measurements from the Los Alamos\nMPA (Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer) instruments on-\nboard geosynchronous satellites. The MPA instruments are\nelectrostatic analyzers. They measure the three-dimensional\nenergy-per-charge distributions of ions and electrons be-\ntween \u223c1 eV\/q and \u223c45 keV\/q. Here we use ion density and\ntemperature measurements which are available every 86 sec-\nonds (Thomsen et al., 1999) and are calculated for the en-\nergy range 100\u201345 000 eV. The reader is referred to Bame et\nal. (1993) and McComas et al. (1993) for detailed description\nof the MPA instruments.\nFor the current study, data are taken from seven different\nsatellites in geosynchronous orbit covering the period be-\ntween 1990 and 2004. Section 3.1 first deals with a large-\nscale analysis of the whole data set, which is performed to\nobtain statistics of plasma events characterized by various\ndensities and temperatures. These allow us to study the lo-\ncal time dependence and occurrence statistics as a function\nof the selected density and temperature criteria. The \u201czero\nepochs\u201d used for the superposed epoch analyses performed\nin the following sections come from a list of 644 initial events\nwhich are found to be unusually dense (>2 cm\u22123) and cold\n(T<5 keV) simultaneously. The zero epochs are defined as\nthe time at which one of the operating spacecraft, during\none given day and with a minimum delay of 12 h between\ntwo consecutive events (the same event would be counted\nmultiple times otherwise), measures such cold, dense plasma\nfor the first time (with at least two such measurements con-\ntiguous to avoid spurious data points). Events from all local\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3451\u20133465, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3451\/2006\/\nB. Lavraud et al.: Observation of two distinct cold, dense ion populations at geosynchronous orbit 3453\ntimes are analyzed first in Fig. 1, after which we only focus\non the two separate populations observed at midnight and\ndawn. For all measurements used in the study, most magne-\ntosheath and \u201cflowing\u201d low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL)\nencounters were removed by only accepting data points with\nproton density lower than 10 cm\u22123 and proton bulk speed\nlower than 100 km\/s. Owing to spacecraft charging effects,\nwe have also excluded data points recorded when the charg-\ning exceeds 70 keV, so that it may not affect ion spectra in the\nenergy range for moments computation (100\u201345 000 eV).\n2.2 Solar wind and geomagnetic activity data\nSolar wind data and geomagnetic indices used in this study\ncome from the OMNI2 data set (King and Papitashvili, 2005)\nand have 1 h resolution (the Kp index is 3 h resolution). Al-\nthough this resolution is coarser than the resolution used in\nthe superposed epoch plots of Fig. 3, we used OMNI2 data\ninterpolated at 10 min resolution in these plots in order to be\ncomparable to the other superposed epoch plots in this study.\nThe global trends, which are of interest here and which typ-\nically last for several hours, are therefore presumably mean-\ningful. The coordinate system used is GSM.\n2.3 DMSP low-altitude data and mapping technique\nWe also use data obtained from the SSJ4 instruments on\nboard DMSP satellites. DMSP are Sun-synchronous satel-\nlites in nearly circular polar orbit at an altitude of roughly\n835 km and a period of approximately 101 min. The SSJ4\ninstruments are curved plate electrostatic analyzers which\nmeasure ions and electrons from 32 eV to 30 keV (Hardy et\nal., 1984). Complete electron and ion energy spectra are ob-\ntained every second. The satellites are three-axis stabilized\nand the detector apertures always point toward local zenith.\nThis means that the observed fluxes are largely within the at-\nmospheric loss cone. There were generally several satellites\nin operation during any given event of this study. This allows\nan optimal spatial coverage as each satellite covers different\nlocal times.\nIt is known that ions (6 keV and above) observed in the\ntopside ionosphere are isotropic above a certain latitude (e.g.,\nBernstein et al., 1974). In situ magnetotail observations, tail-\nward of \u223c8\u201310RE , have also indicated that the plasma sheet\nis nearly isotropic, irrespective of activity levels (e.g., Kistler\net al., 1992; Huang and Frank, 1994). Consequently, den-\nsity, temperature, and pressure are approximately conserved\nalong the magnetic field. The ions maintain their isotropy\nby pitch angle scattering in the tail current sheet (Lyons\nand Speiser, 1982). Closer to Earth (typically earthward of\n\u223c8\u201310RE), field lines become more dipolar and pitch angle\nscattering ceases. As a result, the mapping technique does\nnot work in this region. Newell et al. (1998) have developed\nan algorithm to identify the equatorward isotropy boundary\nin the ionosphere (b2i) (equivalently the earthward boundary\nof the plasma sheet). Sergeev et al. (1993) showed that the\nion isotropy boundary (i.e., b2i) highly correlates with the\ntail inclination angle measured in the same local time sector\nby GOES (correlation coefficient = 0.9). Therefore b2i can\nbe used to modify and improve ionosphere-magnetosphere\nT89 magnetic field model (Tsyganenko, 1989) tail mapping\n(Sergeev et al., 1993) and has been adapted into the method\nused here. More complete method descriptions may be found\nin Wing and Newell (1998) and Newell and Wing (2000).\nElectron acceleration events are excluded from the data\nset because they distort the plasma sheet ion spectra, result-\ning in distributions that do not represent those in the plasma\nsheet. Each ion spectrum is fitted to distribution functions\n(one-component Maxwellian, two-component Maxwellian,\nand Kappa) and the best fit is selected. The moments ob-\ntained from those fits thus take into account ions from out-\nside the detectors\u2019 energy range. Therefore, the densities ob-\ntained, in particular, can be larger than those calculated us-\ning straight integration of the distribution functions. But as\nwill be apparent, the relative behaviors of the ion density and\ntemperature constitute the most relevant observation in the\ncontext of the present study.\nUsing this method and DMSP data, we have constructed\nplots of the two-dimensional equatorial plasma sheet den-\nsity and temperature for three different time intervals. Those\nintervals are [\u22126, 0], [0, 4] and [+4, +10] in epoch time,\nbased on the zero epochs of observation of a cold and dense\nplasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit, as defined previously\nin Sect. 2.1. The data gathered in Figs. 6, 7 and 8 thus come\nfrom the same events as for geosynchronous observations,\nwith several spacecraft typically operative during each event\nin both dataset, thus allowing for direct comparisons.\n3 Results\n3.1 Local time distribution of plasma sheet access as a\nfunction of density and temperature\nFigure 1a shows the local time distribution (1 h bins) of the\n644 cold (T<5 keV) and dense (N>2 cm\u22123) plasma events\nobserved from the survey of data from all satellites during\nthe period 1990\u20132004 (cf. Sect. 2.1), and which are used as\nzero epoch times in the next sections. This distribution shows\na tendency for cold, dense plasma events to occur close to\nmidnight, but a comparable peak is observed around dawn.\nThe occurrence then fades away each side of those peaks and\ntowards the dayside. The distinct midnight and dawn events\nused later in Sect. 3.2 are shown between the blue and red\nvertical dashed lines, i.e., respectively between 21:00\u201303:00\nand 03:00\u201309:00 LT.\nTo assess whether this feature is only specific of the\npopulations meeting these particular criteria, we performed\nadditional surveys of the dataset by varying the density and\ntemperature thresholds.

See text for further details.\nplasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit has typically densities\nin the range 0.4\u20132 cm\u22123, with an average of 0.7 cm\u22123 in the\nmidnight region (Borovsky et al., 1997).\nFigure 1b shows the local time distribution of events\nwith temperatures lower than 5 keV for five different density\nthresholds ranging from 1 to 2 cm\u22123 (by steps of 0.25 cm\u22123).\nThis figure shows that less dense (e.g., red curveN>1 cm\u22123)\nbut cold events are recorded with a larger occurrence mostly\naround midnight. Although one can distinct two populations\nin this curve, a clear separation between midnight and dawn\npopulations only becomes fully evident for dense plasmas\nabove 1.5 cm\u22123, with the appearance of a large dip in occur-\nrence between the two local time regions.\nSimilarly, Fig. 1c shows the local time distribution of\nevents with densities above 2 cm\u22123 for ten different tempera-\nture thresholds ranging from 5 to 9.5 keV (by steps of 500 eV,\ncurves colors respectively go in the order black-blue-red).\nFrom these curves it appears that dense plasma events appear\nas increasingly distinct populations at midnight and dawn\nfor progressively lower temperatures. A striking feature in\nFig. 1c is the increase in the total number of events at dawn\nas the temperature threshold is decreased. This feature is due\nto the fact that a small fraction of the dense and relatively\nhot populations from midnight (these events are numerous;\ni.e., the red curve around the midnight region in Fig. 1c) are\nrecorded during events when a colder and dense population\nis observed at dawn as well. We discuss this in Sect. 4.\nFrom this analysis, we may so far conclude that the first\nappearance of cold, dense plasma occurs distinctly at both\nmidnight and dawn with comparable occurrence. That the lo-\ncal time distribution shows two peaks at midnight and dawn,\nwith a clear dip in between, shows that those are generally\ndistinct populations. We will now focus on the properties\nof those events meeting the initial criteria (N>2 cm\u22123 and\nT<5 keV) since those correspond to the original cold, dense\nion populations of interest (cf. introduction). To understand\nthe large-scale behavior and origin of plasmas at geosyn-\nchronous orbit during the two types of event (midnight and\ndawn), in the remainder of this paper we separately ana-\nlyze solar wind data (and in the next sections Los Alamos\nMPA and DMSP data) for two subsets of the 644 initial cold\n(T<5 keV), dense (N>2 cm\u22123) plasma events. The first set\ncorresponds to \u201cmidnight\u201d events observed first in the range\n(21:00\u201303:00 LT, with a total of 271 events. The second\nset corresponds to \u201cdawn\u201d events observed first in the range\n03:00\u201309:00 LT, and totals 247 events (cf. Fig. 1a).\nTo quantify the likelihood of observation of such cold,\ndense plasma events at geosynchronous orbit, we kept track\nof the total number of measurements that have been analyzed\nin the midnight and dawn regions, respectively (as defined\nabove). These correspond to a total of 2730 and 3054 days\nof satellite data, respectively for midnight and dawn. The\nlikelihood of observation of a cold, dense event is thus re-\nspectively of \u223c10% and 8%. It must be remembered that our\nAnn.

From top to bottom,\nthe panels show (a) the solar wind (SW) dynamic pressure\n(Pram), (b) the SW density, (c) the SW speed, (d) the IMF\nabsolute clock angle (|CA|=| tan\u22121(BY \/BZ)|), (e) the IMF\nmagnitude, (f) the IMF Bz component, (g) the Dst index, (h)\nthe AE index, and (i) the Kp index. We have used all avail-\nable data to perform superposed epoch averages of those pa-\nrameters. The results from the superposition of all 644 cold,\ndense events (regardless of local time) are represented by the\nblack line. The results from the superposition of the separate\nsets of midnight and dawn events are respectively displayed\nas the blue and red lines. The available solar wind data are\nlimited compared to the coverage of the Los Alamos space-\ncraft. We have estimated that 72% and 69% of the total num-\nber of events (644) have a coverage of at least 70% of the\ninterval (from \u22126 to +10 h in epoch time in Fig. 2) for the\nmagnetic field (e.g., IMF clock angle) and plasma data (e.g.,\ndynamic pressure), respectively. Owing to the large number\nof events, the following results may be viewed as meaning-\nful. Also, the AE index from the OMNI dataset is only avail-\nable up to 1995, but the trend of this index will be shown\nto be consistent with other parameters and is therefore worth\nnoticing. Dst and Kp coverage is complete. Note that, ow-\ning to the large number of events, statistical errors are very\nsmall and thus not shown in Fig. 2. The average deviation of\nthe mean (i.e., the average deviation from the mean divided\nby the square root of the number of measurements) is typi-\ncally of the order of a few percent of the absolute value for\nall parameters at all epoch times (apart from the Dst for the\nmidnight events that is close to zero at early epoch times).\nFrom the superposed epoch results of Fig. 2 we can see\nthat cold, dense plasma at midnight is generally observed for\nmild solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. By contrast,\ncold, dense plasma observations at dawn correspond to active\ntimes.\nThe events for which first detection of cold, dense plasma\noccurs at midnight have (compared to the dawn events)\n(1) a lower dynamic pressure mainly in the period \u22122 to\n+2 h in epoch time (panel a), (2) similar density and slightly\nlower velocity (panels b and c), (3) a modestly lower IMF\nstrength both prior to and after zero epoch, (4) an average\nclear northward-directed IMF (panels d and f) prior to zero\nepoch and (5) a mild southward turning of the IMF toward\nmore horizontal direction around zero epoch. The main prop-\nerty of those midnight events thus appears to be that it fol-\nlows a substantial period of northward IMF, together with a\nslight southward turning of the IMF towards an average hor-\nizontal direction around zero epoch. This fact suggests that\n(a)\n(b)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(c)\n(g)\n(h)\n(i)\nMIDNIGHT\nDAWN\nDAWN\nMIDNIGHT\nFig. 2.

Kp and AE indices also show significant in-\ncreases in conjunction with the main phase of the Dst de-\ncrease. It is of particular interest to notice that (1) the ap-\npearance of this cold, dense population at dawn is actually\nobserved after the main phase (i.e., at the end of the main\naverage decrease in Dst ) and that (2) such preceeding con-\nditions (i.e., the observed average southward IMF and the\nsubstantial dynamic pressure) also are conducive to magne-\ntopause compression and erosion.\nFinally, the superposed epoch results of the IMF By com-\nponent do not show any noticeable feature. The average val-\nues are close to zero for both kinds of events at all epoch\ntimes (not presented in Fig. 2). The frequent appearance of\ncold, dense plasma at dawn is thus likely unrelated to this\ncomponent of the IMF.\n3.3 Superposed epoch analysis of plasma parameters for\nthe two distinct populations\nIn this section we investigate how frequently those two pop-\nulations may appear during the same events. Figure 3 shows\nsuperposed epoch plots of ion density and temperature, with\nthe y-axis being the epoch time in hours and the x-axis corre-\nsponding to the local time of observation. In these plots, all\ndata from all operating spacecraft are used and binned into\n96 ten-minute epoch time bins and 24 local time bins, and\naverages are made.

This is the result of our selec-\ntion of only events for which enhanced densities were first\nseen in the midnight region between 21:00\u201303:00 LT. Low\ntemperatures are observed at midnight around zero epoch\n(Fig. 3c) for the same reason. It is important to note that\nAnn.

See text for further details.\nsince those plots show averages of plasma parameters from\nall operating spacecraft, data at non-midnight local times\nnear zero epoch come from the other operating spacecraft\n(up to seven).\nFigure 3a shows a lack of dense plasma, on average, near\ndawn around zero epoch. This demonstrates that the obser-\nvation of cold (T<5 keV), dense (N>2 cm\u22123) plasma near\nmidnight at geosynchronous orbit is not typically associated\nwith cold, dense plasma observation at dawn at the same\nepoch time. Modestly dense plasma is observed at dawn\nlater, after several hours in epoch time. This plasma is in\naddition relatively cold, thus suggesting the possibility that a\nportion of the cold, dense plasma populations at dawn occur\nduring the midnight events but at later times (see Sects. 3.4\nand 4). It should be remembered that ions at dawn are gener-\nally colder at all times owing to the continuous duskward\nmagnetic drift of the highest energy ions (Maurice et al.,\n1998; Korth et al., 1999).\nFigure 3b shows the superposed epoch plot of the aver-\nage density for the dawn cold and dense plasma events only.\nLarge average densities are observed at dawn at zero epoch\nowing to the selection criteria. Correspondingly, the temper-\natures are low at this local time as well (Fig. 3d). The ob-\nserved average density around midnight during these events\nis lower than at dawn, but it is generally above 1 cm\u22123. In ad-\ndition, the temperatures at midnight in Fig. 3d are observed to\nbe relatively high at all epoch times in comparison with those\nfor the midnight events in Fig. 3c near zero epoch. Thus, the\noccurrence of cold, dense plasma at dawn is often correlated\nwith non-negligibly high plasma density near midnight (and,\nindeed, throughout most of the nightside), but this plasma is\nnot typically (1) colder than usual and (2) as dense as 2 cm\u22123\n(i.e., since it was not recorded in the original selection using\nour density and temperature thresholds).\n3.4 Transport patterns of the different plasma populations\nFigure 4 shows the superposed epoch plots of the relative\nnumber of cold (<5 keV), dense (>2 cm\u22123) ion measure-\nments subsequent to an initial midnight (panel a) or dawn\n(panel b) event. The panels show the absolute number of such\nmeasurements, normalized by the total number of all mea-\nsurements, in each local time \u2013 epoch time bin. In these plots,\ngrey means that no cold, dense measurement is recorded at\nall. This representation is meant to follow local time changes\nin such cold, dense plasma observations over the course of\nthe events, which may shed light on the transport of these\npopulations.\nFigure 4a shows that, for the midnight events, there ap-\npears little counterpart at dawn, near zero epoch, in terms\nof the relative number of such measurements. Similarly, lit-\ntle counterpart is observed at midnight, around zero epoch,\nfor the dawn events (Fig. 4b), as expected from the results\nof the previous analyses (e.g., Fig. 3). A non-negligible but\nsmall occurrence (0.01 to 0.1) is observed towards dawn as\nepoch time progresses in Fig. 4a. This figure shows that the\nfrequency of cold, dense plasma observations is relatively\nhigh along the corotation curve (white dashed line), sug-\ngesting that cold, dense plasma from midnight may convect\ndawnward and be detected there for a minority of the mid-\nnight events. But the detection frequency is also appreciable\nthroughout the entire dawnside, from zero epoch onwards.\nThis means that, for midnight events, cold and dense plasma\nis sometimes observed at dawn before corotation could de-\nliver it from the midnight regions. However, the generally\nlow frequency of observation outside of the region of initial\ndetection (for both Figs. 4a and 4b) is also compatible with\nthe fact that observation of both types of populations during\nthe same event is not very frequent, and that the two popula-\ntions are distinct in origin.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3451\/2006\/ Ann.

Superposed epoch distribution of the azimuthal (eastward) ion velocity component for the midnight and dawn events. The positive\n(yellow to red) values at dawn correspond to sunward flow. The negative values (blue) at dusk correspond to sunward flows as well. See text\nand previous figure captions for further details.\nIt is important to note the presence of few cold, dense mea-\nsurements near midnight before zero epoch in the case of the\ndawn events in Fig. 4b (and some counts in Fig. 4a as well).\nAlthough these are compatible with the detection of both\ntypes of cold, dense populations during the same events, such\nmeasurements ought not to be measured at such time, i.e., be-\nfore zero epoch, according to our original selection criteria.\nThe existence of non-zero counts prior to zero epoch in these\nfigures is partially due to individual data points that do not\nsatisfy the two-in-a-row cold, dense measurements criterion\n(see Sect. 2.1). It is also largely the result of our minimum\nlag time criteria of 12 h between two consecutive events, i.e.,\nthese counts were likely occurring during the few hours fol-\nlowing previously selected events which happened at an ear-\nlier time on the dusk- or day-side.\nThe MPA instruments measure the 3-D distribution func-\ntions and thus allow the determination of the bulk flow ve-\nlocity. For flow speeds significantly smaller than the thermal\nspeeds, this is a difficult measurement and shows significant\nscatter. Nonetheless, we may examine the derived velocities\nfor the events in this study. Figure 5 shows the superposed\nepoch plot of the eastward velocity measured for the mid-\nnight (panel a) and dawn (panel b) events in a format sim-\nilar to Fig. 3. At dawn, eastward is equivalent to sunward,\nwhereas at dusk eastward is equivalent to anti-sunward, and\nat midnight it is toward dawn. Because the satellites are all\nspinning around an axis pointing radially toward Earth, the\neast-west flow component is deemed to be the most reliable.\nFigures 5a and 5b show a global pattern of the ion flow be-\ning diverted around the Earth from the midnight region, with\nsunward-directed flows both on the dusk and dawn side of\ngeosynchronous orbit. The important observations in these\nfigures are (1) the sunward direction of the flows at both\ndawn and dusk during both types of events, and (2) that the\nflows are clearly enhanced during the dawn events compared\nto the midnight events. The former observation shows that\nthe dawn population is not flowing anti-sunward, as would\nbe expected for typical LLBL encounters. The latter observa-\ntion shows a global convection enhancement consistent with\nthe more disturbed periods corresponding to the dawn events.\n3.5 Global properties of the source ion populations\nIn this section we wish to investigate the origin of the popula-\ntions for each type of event. We investigate the global prop-\nerties of the tail plasma sheet (which may include LLBL)\nregions using a mapping technique of data from the DMSP\nspacecraft fleet (see Sect. 2.3 and, e.g., Wing and Newell,\n1998). Figure 6 shows the total number of measurements\nto be used in the averages of Figs. 7 and 8. The represen-\ntation shows the equatorial plane of the magnetotail, for the\nmidnight and dawn events, respectively, in the left and right\ncolumn, and for three different epoch time intervals relative\nto the geosynchronous event identification (\u22126 to 0, 0 to +4,\nand +4 to +10 in hours).\nFigure 6 shows that the coverage of DMSP data in the\nplasma sheet is particularly good on both flanks and in the\nnear-Earth regions. The central and distant part of the plasma\nsheet is the least well covered region.\nFigure 7 shows the average ion density (left column) and\ntemperature (right column) of the plasma sheet for the three\ndifferent epoch time intervals relative to the onset of the\nmidnight events. It shows that, except at its outer edge,\nthe plasma sheet on the flanks before zero epoch (Figs. 7a\nand 7b) is substantially denser and colder (and especially on\nthe dawn side) compared to that observed after zero epoch\n(Figs. 7c, 7d, 7e and 7f). As noted in Fig. 2, before zero\nepoch, the IMF is northward on average for these events,\nwhile it turns southward and stays horizontal on average from\nzero epoch onwards. Around midnight close to zero epoch\n(in the time interval 0\u20134) in Fig. 7c, there appears a partic-\nularly dense ion population. This population is presumably\nAnn.

The number of measurements in this re-\ngion of the representation of Fig. 6c is relatively high, so that\nthis property may be viewed as characteristic of this popula-\ntion.

Compared to that observed before zero\nepoch for the midnight events in Figs. 7a and 7b (i.e., that\ncoldest and densest), the plasma sheet seems somewhat less\ndense and significantly hotter at all epoch times in the case of\nthe dawn events. These dawn events are not associated with\nnorthward IMF (Fig. 2), but rather with strong southward av-\nerage IMF, especially before zero epoch.\nIn Fig. 8a, large densities are observed on the dawn side of\nthe magnetosphere before as well as after zero epoch.

Similarly, the dawn\nflank of the plasma sheet is significantly colder than the dusk\nside for both kinds of events, at all epoch times. This dif-\nference is observable as a layer of cold plasma all along the\ndawn flank, which has no counterpart on the dusk flank of\nthe plasma sheet.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Existence of two distinct ion populations\nFrom the results of Sect. 3, we may first recall that ini-\ntial measurements of cold (T<5 keV), dense (N>2 cm\u22123)\nplasma appear distinctly at both midnight and dawn with\ncomparable occurrences. That the local time distribution\nshows two peaks at midnight and dawn, with a large dip\nin between (Fig. 1a), shows that those are generally dis-\ntinct populations. It is known that the plasma sheet ion\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3451\u20133465, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3451\/2006\/\nB.

See Fig. 6 caption and text for further details.\ntemperature at geosynchronous orbit decreases from dusk to\ndawn on the nightside (Maurice et al., 1998; Korth et al.,\n1999; Denton et al., 2005), but this cannot account for the\ntwo peaks observed in this survey.\nIn Sect. 3, Fig. 1c, we noted that the total number of cold,\ndense events at dawn generally increases when the temper-\nature threshold is decreased (with fixed density threshold at\n2 cm\u22123). This feature is due to the fact that a fraction of the\ndense and relatively hot events from midnight (these events\nare numerous; i.e., the red curve around the midnight region\nin Fig. 1c) are recorded during events when a colder and\ndense population is observed at dawn as well. Thus, by de-\ncreasing the temperature threshold, the midnight population\nno longer qualifies, but the dawn, colder population seen later\nduring the same event becomes the first to satisfy the criteria.\nThis fact demonstrates that some events are characterized by\ndense plasma at both midnight and dawn, but for many of\nthose events only the dawn plasma is unusually cold. Some\nof the cold, dense events recorded at midnight do appear to\nhave a cold, dense counterpart at dawn as well (Fig. 3c).

Geophys., 24, 3451\u20133465, 2006\n3462 B. Lavraud et al.: Observation of two distinct cold, dense ion populations at geosynchronous orbit\nof cold plasma from midnight (Fig. 4a) shows that the dawn\npopulation is not entirely attributable to corotation from the\ninitial midnight appearance. As further shown in Fig. 4, the\nobservation of the two populations during the same event has\na low occurrence frequency overall.\n4.2 Origin and fate of the midnight population\nThe change observed in the average IMF direction (from\nnorthward to horizontal) just before zero epoch for the mid-\nnight events in Figs. 2d and 2f presumably results in the\nslight enhancement of magnetospheric convection observed\nas a modest gradual rise in the average Kp of Fig. 2i. This\nconvection enhancement would allow the plasma sheet to be\npushed closer to Earth, compatible with previous observa-\ntions (Korth and Thomsen, 2001; Thomsen, 2005). As the\nIMF orientation preceding the observation of cold, dense\nplasma at midnight is substantially northward on average,\nit is interpreted that the source of this population is the\ncold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS) formed, and present in the\nmidnight tail regions during such northward IMF conditions\n(Terasawa et al., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 1998), as previously\nsuggested (Thomsen et al., 2003).\nThe observation of a modest Kp enhancement and in-\nsignificant average Dst decrease around zero epoch for the\nmidnight events (Fig. 2) suggest that the presence of cold,\ndense plasma at midnight of geosynchronous orbit does not\ntypically lead to enhanced geomagnetic activity. Such activ-\nity requires sustained southward IMF, which does not neces-\nsarily follow (and is not observed in Fig. 2) the intervals of\nsustained northward IMF required to produce the CDPS in\nthe midnight region.\nAssessing whether the formation of a CDPS in the mid-\nnight tail of the magnetosphere may enhance ensuing geo-\nmagnetic activity requires the study of specific geoeffective\nevents with and without prior formation of a CDPS. Such a\nstudy has been undertaken in a previous report (Lavraud et\nal., 2006b), which showed that storms preceded by intervals\nof northward IMF tend to be modestly stronger than those\nnot preceded by northward IMF, and this difference is pre-\nsumably attributable to the higher plasma sheet densities ob-\nserved under these conditions.\n4.3 Origin and fate of the dawn population\nBy contrast, the cold, dense ion population detected initially\nat dawn is not preceded by northward IMF. Therefore, it can-\nnot be simply associated with the cold, dense or hot, dense\nion populations reported at dawn and in the nightside by Fu-\njimoto et al. (1998; 2005) using Geotail data. Rather, the\ndawn population observed here follows from a substantial\nsouthward IMF in the preceding 4 h, which in turn leads to\na significant geomagnetic activity (observed in Kp, AE and\nDst in Fig. 2). It is of particular interest to notice that the ap-\npearance of this population at dawn is actually observed after\nthe main phase, i.e., at the end of the main decrease in Dst ,\ndown to \u221250 nT on average. This observation demonstrates\nthat this cold and dense population is not the source of the\nring current increase during the main phase. In other words,\nit is the solar wind conditions, with associated compression\n(dynamic pressure) and large-scale convection (Kp index),\nthat seem to lead to both the large geomagnetic activity and\nthe access of the cold, dense plasma population at dawn. It\nis presently unclear whether this population in turn affects\nthe ring current strength in the later stage of the storm. Fu-\nture work, involving simulations of the ring current, will be\nneeded to study this possibility.\nObservation of cold and dense plasma at the dawn side\nof geosynchronous orbit following enhanced magnetospheric\ncompression (large solar wind dynamic pressure) and activity\n(convection) could suggest that these populations come from\nmagnetosheath and LLBL encounters at geosynchronous or-\nbit. Since we reject samples with densities above 10 cm\u22123 or\nion flow speeds above 100 km\/s in all of our analysis, mag-\nnetosheath intervals are unlikely to contribute, and only low-\nspeed LLBL could have been included. Since the cold and\ndense population observed at dawn is not symmetrically ob-\nserved at dusk, it seems unlikely that this feature is caused by\nsuch LLBL encounters either. Additionally, Fig. 5 shows an\nenhancement of the sunward flow at dawn and dusk around\nzero epoch (from 5 to \u223c15 km\/s), whereas the LLBL would\nbe expected to flow tailward there. This sunward flow en-\nhancement is compatible with a global enhancement of mag-\nnetospheric compression and convection during the active\ntimes corresponding to the dawn events. The possibility of\na dawn-dusk asymmetry in the magnetopause and LLBL po-\nsitions is further discussed in Sect. 4.4.\nWe have attempted to estimate the composition from the\ndifference between derived ion and electron densities (cf.\nDenton et al., 2005; Lavraud et al., 2005). In both kinds\nof events we infer lower than usual contribution from heav-\nier ion populations (not shown). This suggests a more direct\nsolar wind origin for both populations. But this result is not\nfully conclusive owing to the limitations of the technique.\nFurther work will be required to evaluate a possible iono-\nspheric contribution. Finally, it is straightforward to mention\nthat the solar wind driving conditions identified here for both\ntypes of events come from a large-scale statistical analysis.\nTherefore, it may be expected that various combinations of\nsuch drivers\/criteria (Kp, IMF Bz and solar wind density in\nparticular) may actually lead to the observation of cold, dense\nplasma at geosynchronous orbit, without necessarily requir-\ning all of them to be met.\n4.4 Global plasma sheet observations and transport\nPrevious works using large-scale plasma sheet mapping with\nDMSP data have shown the capabilities of this technique\n(Wing and Newell, 2002; Wing et al., 2005). These studies\ndemonstrated that the plasma sheet globally becomes denser\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3451\u20133465, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3451\/2006\/\nB. Lavraud et al.: Observation of two distinct cold, dense ion populations at geosynchronous orbit 3463\nand colder when the IMF is northward and that there exists a\npersistent tendency for the dawn side of the plasma sheet to\ndisplay these characteristics more than the dusk side.\nIn the context of the present study, the cold, dense plasma\nsheet (CDPS) origin of the midnight events is confirmed\nthrough the observations from DMSP satellites. The plasma\nsheet and flank regions are substantially colder and denser\nbefore than after zero epoch for the midnight events (Fig. 7),\ncompatible with the formation and existence of a CDPS\nunder the corresponding northward IMF. Near zero epoch,\na significantly dense population appears in the near-Earth\nregion in the midnight sector, consistent with the geosyn-\nchronous observations at that time. Unfortunately, the low\ncoverage in the more distant midnight region does not allow\nus to trace this population fully.\nThe results from DMSP data also show that the plasma\nsheet is not typically cold or dense during the dawn events,\nconsistent with the more southward or horizontal IMF dur-\ning those times. There appears, however, a layer of denser\nand substantially colder plasma along the dawn flanks at all\nepoch times during both kinds of events. The DMSP obser-\nvations thus show the existence of a cold and dense popu-\nlation (in the form of a layer in Figs. 7 and 8) on the dawn\nside of the plasma sheet, not present at dusk, which may be\ninterpreted as the source population of the population ob-\nserved at dawn of geosynchronous orbit during the dawn\nevents. Its access to geosynchronous orbit may be the result\nof the more extreme solar wind conditions which are con-\nducive to enhanced compression and convection in the mag-\nnetosphere, i.e., it occurs during active times. This is sug-\ngestive of plasma transport from the dawn flank toward the\ninner, dawn magnetosphere during such times. Such trans-\nport pattern was also suggested as a fate for the cold, dense\nand hot, dense ion events reported in the mid-tail at dawn\nby Fujimoto et al. (1998, 2005) from the analysis of Geotail\ndata. However, we have shown that the dawn events studied\nhere are not preceded by northward IMF and are therefore of\ndifferent origin to those discussed by Fujimoto et al. (1998,\n2005).\nThe recent analysis of geosynchronous magnetopause\ncrossings by Dmitriev et al. (2004) showed that the oc-\ncurrence frequency for such crossings is skewed toward\nthe dawn side (with the peak occurrence between 10:00\u2013\n11:00 LT). Such an asymmetry may lead to more frequent\ncrossings of the LLBL under disturbed conditions and could\nbe a reason for our results, i.e., large occurrence for cold\nand dense plasma observations at dawn but not at dusk.\nHowever, because (1) the cold, dense plasma occurrence at\n10:00\u201311:00 LT (and at noon to dusk LT) is particularly low\n(Fig. 1a), (2) the flows are enhanced and sunward (rather\nthan tailward) at dawn during the dawn events (Fig. 5), (3)\nthe flows are similarly enhanced and sunward at dusk, but\nthe plasma is neither cold or dense (Figs. 3 and 5), and (4)\nmost importantly, a cold and dense ion population is mainly\nobserved in the dawn-side of the plasma sheet (DMSP data\nin Figs. 7 and 8), we may conclude that the dawn events\ndo not generally correspond to LLBL crossings. That cold,\ndense plasma is preferentially observed at dawn of geosyn-\nchronous orbit is likely explained by the preference for the\nplasma sheet in the tail to be denser and colder at dawn. This\npopulation may thus be interpreted as the source of the cold,\ndense events recorded at dawn of geosynchronous orbit. Fi-\nnally, it is reminded that the appearance of the dawn popu-\nlation (and of the midnight one) seems unrelated to the IMF\nBy component.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have reported the appearance of two distinct cold\n(Ti<5 keV), dense (Ni>2 cm\u22123) ion populations at midnight\nand dawn of geosynchronous orbit. These populations were\nstudied using results from geosynchronous Los Alamos data,\ncomplemented by corresponding large-scale plasma sheet\ndata obtained by mapping DMSP observations in the tail.\nThe first population is observed in the midnight region of\ngeosynchronous orbit. The second population, which has\ndrawn less attention, is detected on the dawn side of geosyn-\nchronous orbit. No such cold, dense population is observed\non the dusk side of geosynchronous orbit on a frequent basis.\nThe study of the spatial and temporal behavior of both pop-\nulations has shown that they appear at geosynchronous orbit\nas distinct populations, since, usually, the appearance of the\nmidnight population is not associated with that of the dawn\npopulation, and vice versa.\nThe midnight population is observed after a slight turn-\ning of the IMF towards more horizontal direction on average,\nfollowing a period of substantial northward IMF. The obser-\nvation of this population is thus interpreted as the result of\nthe inward transport of the cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS)\nfollowing a moderate enhancement of magnetospheric con-\nvection, as suggested by Thomsen et al. (2003).\nThe dawn, cold and dense ion population is associated\nwith previously strong southward IMF and is on average ob-\nserved around the end of the main phase of the corresponding\nDst decrease. It is unlikely that the cold, dense population\nobserved at dawn be the result of the direct inward motion of\nthe low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) because (1) no sym-\nmetric dusk population is observed and (2) an average small\nsunward flow (\u223c15 km\/s) is observed for those events. The\ndawn population is observed during active times (based on\nDst , Kp and AE indices) in comparison with the midnight\ncase. However, since the dawn population is observed only\naround the end of the main Dst decrease, it is concluded that\nthis population does not generally contribute to the Dst de-\ncrease during the main phase. Rather, it may have access\nto geosynchronous orbit by means of a large compression\nand convection enhancement in the magnetosphere. Cold,\ndense ion populations thus preferentially get access to the in-\nner magnetosphere from the dawn side during active times.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3451\/2006\/ Ann.
