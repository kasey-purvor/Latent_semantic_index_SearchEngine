To avoid such limitations and\ndevelop a more practical approach, this paper extends the work\nof Huang and Shen. The result enables both interpolation and ex-\ntrapolation which involve multiple fuzzy rules, with each rule con-\nsisting of multiple antecedents. Two realistic applications, namely\ntruck backer-upper control and computer activity prediction, are\nprovided in this paper to demonstrate the utility of the extended\napproach. Experiment-based comparisons to the most commonly\nused Mamdani fuzzy reasoning mechanism, and to other existing\nfuzzy interpolation techniques are given to show the significance\nand potential of this research.\nIndex Terms\u2014Fuzzy model simplification, fuzzy rule extrapo-\nlation, fuzzy rule interpolation, scale and move transformations,\nsparse rule base, transformation-based interpolation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFUZZY rule interpolation helps reduce the complexity offuzzy models and supports inference in systems that em-\nploy sparse rule sets [2], [3]. As argued in [1], with interpola-\ntion, fuzzy rules which may be approximated from their neigh-\nboring rules can be omitted from the rule base. This leads to\nthe complexity reduction of fuzzy models. When given obser-\nvations have no overlap with the antecedent values of the rules,\nclassical fuzzy inference methods have no rule to fire, but inter-\npolation methods can still obtain certain conclusions. Despite\nthese significant advantages, earlier work in fuzzy interpolative\nreasoning does not guarantee the convexity of the derived fuzzy\nsets [4], [5], which is often a crucial requirement of fuzzy rea-\nsoning to attain more easily interpretable practical results.\nInitially, the motivation of research on fuzzy interpolation\nis to eliminate the nonconvexity drawback. It soon goes be-\nyond that to make fuzzy interpolation a more practical and gen-\neral inference for both sparse and nonsparse rule bases.

For instance, Vas et al. have proposed an algo-\nrithm [6] that reduces the problem of nonconvex conclusions.\nQiao et al. [7] have published an improved method which uses\nsimilarity-based reasoning to ensure the attainment of convex\nresults. Hsiao et al. [8] have introduced a new interpolative\nmethod which exploits the slopes of the fuzzy sets. Baranyiet al.\n[9], [10] have proposed the work on general fuzzy interpolation\nand extrapolation techniques. Tikk et al. [11]\u2013[13] have pre-\nsented a modified -cut-based method. Dubois et al. [14] have\nproposed a fuzzy interpolation technique using fuzzy relation in\nthe Cartesian product of input and output space. Bouchonet al.\n[15] have created an interpolative method by exploiting the con-\ncept of graduality. Yam and K\u00f3czy [16], [17] have proposed a\nfuzzy interpolative technique based on Cartesian representation,\nand Jenei et al. [18], [19] have introduced an axiomatic approach\nfor fuzzy interpolation and extrapolation.\nNevertheless, some of the existing methods (e.g., [17]) in-\nvolve complex computation. It becomes more difficult when\nthey are extended to interpolation with multiple antecedents.\nOthers (e.g., [8]) may only apply to simple fuzzy membership\nfunctions limited to triangular or trapezoidal. Apart from the\nwork that uses different combinations of interpolation and in-\nference schemes (e.g., [10]) and the approaches of [16] and [17]\n(that are able to generate multiple results but do not show how\nto make a choice amongst them), many existing techniques lack\nthe flexibility to generate fuzzy results that meet different ap-\nplication requirements. In addition, practically, fuzzy sets used\nin a rule base may have vertical slopes. In fact, handling fuzzy\nsets with vertical slopes is crucial in prediction or classification\nproblems as shown in Section V. However, some existing fuzzy\ninterpolation methods cannot handle such cases.\nThe work of [1] proposes a novel interpolation method which\navoids the problems mentioned above. It only considers inter-\npolation between two adjacent rules. This paper further extends\nthis method to deal with extrapolation as well as interpolation\nand which can both involve multiple rules, with each rule con-\nsisting of multiple antecedents. Although fuzzy interpolation\ntechniques have been successfully applied to control problems\n[20]\u2013[23], little has been reported for their use in performing\ntasks like prediction and classification. This extension helps\nbridge the gap between theory and prediction or classification\napplications, which may often require reasoning with multiple\nmultiantecedent rules and extrapolation.\nIncidentally, it is worth mentioning that a set of axioms have\nbeen proposed by Jenei [18], from a logical point of view, for\nfuzzy interpolation which include properties such as validity\nand compatibility amongst others. To uphold these properties,\n1063-6706\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\n14 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nFig. 1. Scale and move transformations.\na number of conditions are set. However, a particular constraint\nimposed is not realistic in practice, which requires that all inter-\nmediate fuzzy sets have a wider nuclear (interval of elements\nwhich have a full membership value) in the consequent part\nthan those in the antecedent part. Violation of this constraint\nwill cause the resultant fuzzy sets to lose normality (with the\nmaximal fuzzy membership values of the result being less than\n1). In addition, Jenei\u2019s method cannot handle the case where\nthe membership functions of the intermediate fuzzy sets have\nvertical slopes. The interpolation method proposed here avoid\nthese, and, hence, it does not necessarily require or satisfy prop-\nerties such as the monotonicity as imposed in [18].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. For complete-\nness, Section II introduces the concept of general representa-\ntive values for arbitrarily polygonal fuzzy sets, and Section III\nreviews the fuzzy interpolation method proposed in [1]. Sec-\ntion IV extends the method to handle the interpolation and ex-\ntrapolation involving multiple rules, with each rule consisting of\nmultiple antecedents. Section V gives two examples to illustrate\nthe utility of this method, showing its potential in both model\nsimplification and in performing interpolation and extrapolation\ninferences. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.\nII. GENERAL REPRESENTATIVE VALUE\nTo facilitate the description of the proposed work, the concept\nof representative value (Rep) of a polygonal fuzzy set must be\ndefined first. This value should capture important information\nsuch as the overall location of a fuzzy set, and will be used as\nthe guide to perform scale and move transformations of given\nfuzzy sets. Consider an arbitrary polygonal fuzzy set with odd\npoints, , as shown in Fig. 1. It has\nsupports (horizontal intervals between every pair of odd points\nwhich have the same membership value) and\nslopes (nonhorizontal intervals between every pair of consecu-\ntive odd points). Note that two top points (of full membership\nvalue) do not have to be different. Although this figure explicitly\nassumes that evenly paired odd points are given at each -cut\nlevel, this does not affect the generality of the fuzzy set represen-\ntation as artificial odd points can be created to construct evenly\npaired odd points. Given such an arbitrary polygonal fuzzy set,\nits general Rep is defined by\n(1)\nwhere is the weight assigned to point .\nSpecifying the weights is necessary for a given application.\nThe simplest case, which is called the average Rep hereafter, is\nthat all points take the same weight value, i.e., .\nAn alternative definition named the weighted average Rep as-\nsumes that the weights increase upwards from the bottom sup-\nport to the top support, to reflect the relative significance of the\nfuzzy membership values. For instance, assuming the weights\nincrease upwards from to 1, such a Rep is defined by\n(2)\nwhere is the membership value of .\nOne of the most widely used defuzzification methods\u2014the\ncenter of core can also be used to define the center of core Rep.\nIn this case, the Rep is solely determined by those points with a\nfuzzy membership value of 1\n(3)\nNote that the general Rep definition can be simplified if the\nlengths of the supports (with the\nindices arranged in ascending order from the bottom to the top)\nare known. Indeed, as\n, the general form of (1) can be re-written as\n(4)\nwhere is a constant.\nFinally, it is worth indicating that the underlying scheme used\nto capture the representative value of a fuzzy set is the same as\nwith the work of [12], that is, using a vector of characteristic\npoints to represent a fuzzy set.\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 15\nIII. OVERVIEW OF INTERPOLATION\nThe method of [1] works by first constructing a new infer-\nence rule via manipulating two given adjacent rules, and then\nby using scale and move transformations to convert the inter-\nmediate inference results into the final derived conclusions. To\nbe self-contained, a brief overview of this method is provided\nhere. Note that all fuzzy sets involved are convex and normal\npolygonal fuzzy sets throughout this paper.\nA. Construct the Intermediate Rule\nTo be concise, the simplest case is herein used to illustrate\nthe underlying techniques for fuzzy interpolation. Given two\nadjacent rules (informally, where a rule does not exist whose\nantecedent value is between the antecedent values of these two\nrules) as follows:\nwhere\n, together with an observation which\nis located between fuzzy sets and (i.e.,\nif , or\nif , this constraint\nwill be disregarded in the extension, see Section IV), an inter-\npolation is performed to achieve the fuzzy result .\nThe transformation-based interpolation begins with con-\nstructing a new fuzzy set which has the same Rep as that of\n. To support this, the distance between and is defined\nby\n(5)\nwhere the actual scheme adopted to compute Reps is fixed for\nboth and , of course. A ratio is\nintroduced to represent the important impact of upon the\nconstruction of with respect to\n(6)\nThat is to say, if plays no part in constructing\n, while if plays a full role in determining\n. Then,by using the simplest linear interpolation, the\n, of are calculated as follows:\n(7)\nNote that the resulting has the same representative value as\nand that is convex and normal. Similarly, the consequent\nfuzzy set can be obtained by and . In doing so,\na new rule is derived, which involves the use of only\nnormal and convex fuzzy sets.\nAs is derived from and ,\nwhen is given it is feasible to perform fuzzy reasoning with\nthis new rule without further reference to its originals. Consider\ntwo extreme cases first. If , then from (6) ,\nand according to (7), , and similarly , so the\nconclusion . Likewise, if , then .\nOther than the extreme cases, similarity measures are used to\nsupport the interpolation that follows the intuition:\n(8)\nSuppose that a certain degree of similarity between and\nis established, it is intuitive to require that the consequent parts\nand attain the same similarity degree. The question is\nnow how to obtain an operator which can capture the similarity\ndegree between and , and to allow transforming to\nwith the desired degree of similarity. To this end, the following\ntwo component transformations are proposed.\nB. Scale Transformation\nConsider applying scale transformation to an arbitrary\npolygonal fuzzy membership function (as\nshown on the left of Fig. 1) to generate\nsuch that and will have the same Rep, and\n, where are scale rates and\n. In order to achieve this, equa-\ntions ,\nare imposed to obtain the supports with desired lengths, and\nequations\nare\nimposed to equalize the ratios between the left\nslopes\u2019 lengths and the right slopes\u2019 lengths of\nto the ratio counterparts of the original fuzzy set . The\nequation which ensures the Reps to\nremain the same before and after the transformation is added to\nmake up of equations. For\nclarity, these equations are collectively written as\n(9)\nwhere is the th support length of the resultant fuzzy set and\nis the ratio between the th left slope length and the th right\nslope length. Solving these equations simultaneously results\nin a unique and convex fuzzy set . It can be shown [1] that\ngiven a fuzzy set and the support scale rates , the use of a\ndifferent Rep will not affect the geometrical shape of the resul-\ntant fuzzy set. Instead, it only affects the position of the trans-\nformed fuzzy set.\nHowever, arbitrarily choosing the th support scale rate when\nthe th scale rate is fixed may lead the th support to be-\ncoming wider than the th support, i.e., . To\navoid this, the th scale ratio , which represents the actual in-\ncrease of the ratios between the th supports and the th\nsupports, before and after the transformation, normalized over\nthe maximal of such an increase (in the sense that it does not\n16 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nlead to nonconvexity), is introduced to restrict with respect to\nif\nif\n(10)\nIf (when ) or (when\n), then . In summary, if given\nsuch that or\n(depending on whether or not),\n, the scale transformation guarantees to produce a normal and\nconvex fuzzy set.\nConversely, if two convex sets and\nwhich have the same Rep are given, the scale\nrate of the bottom support, , and the scale ratio of the th\nsupport, can be calculated by\n(11) and (12), shown at the bottom of the page. Since and\nare both convex, must be within the range as given in (12).\nC. Move Transformation\nNow, consider the move transformation (on the right of Fig.\n1) applied to an arbitrary polygonal fuzzy membership function\nto generate , such that\nand have the same Rep and the same lengths of supports,\nand . In order to achieve\nthis, the move transformation is decomposed into\nsubmoves. The th submove moves the\nth support (indexed from bottom to top beginning with 0) to a de-\nsired place. This operator moves all the odd points on and above\nthe th support, whilst unaltering those points under this support.\nTo measure the degree of the th submove, the first possible max-\nimal move distance (in the sense that the corresponding submove\ndoes not lead to the part of the fuzzy set above the th support\nbecoming nonconvexity) should be worked out first. To simplify\nthe description of the submove procedure, only the move on the\nright side (from \u2019s point of view) is considered in the discussion\nhereafter. The left direction simply mirrors this operation.\nIf the th point is supposed to move to the right direction, the\nmaximal position can be calculated as follows when:\n(13)\nFig. 2. Extreme move positions in the ith submove.\nwhere\nand is the length of the th support (either before\nor after move transformation as they are the same). If, however,\n, the maximal position\nis calculated similarly to (13) except that the condition\non term is changed to . It\ncan be shown that the other extreme moving points\nwhich are on the left side of the fuzzy\nset in the th submove can be computed by\nif\nif\n(14)\nAlso, it can be seen that all the extreme points determine a\nnormal and convex fuzzy set (as illustrated in Fig. 2) which\nmust have at least a vertical slope between any two consecutive\n-cuts above the th support. This fuzzy set will have the same\nRep as with respect to the move transformation. That is\n(15)\nFrom (13), the first maximal move distance can be calculated.\nHowever, the th submove should not only consider noncon-\nvexity above the th support, but also ensure the avoidance of\nnonconvexity below. Otherwise it may still lead to nonconvexity\nas illustrated in Fig. 2. For this, the second maximal move dis-\ntance is calculated as . It is intuitive to select\n(11)\nif\nif\n(12)\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 17\nthe minimal of these two maximal move distances to act as the\nactual maximal move distance, in order to avoid nonconvexity.\nThe move ratio , which is used to measure the degree of such\na submove is, thus, calculated by (16), shown at the bottom of\nthe page, where the notation represents \u2019s new position\nafter the th submove. Initially, .\nIf when , or\nwhen , the submove is carried out as fol-\nlows. The odd points under the th support are not changed:\nwhile the other\npoints are to be moved. At the begin-\nning, when , all odd points are moved of course. If moving\nto the right side from the viewpoint of , i.e., ,\nthe moving distances of\nwhich are on the left side of the fuzzy set are calculated\nby multiplying with the distances between the extreme po-\nsitions and themselves. In doing so, will move the\nsame proportion of distance to their respective extreme posi-\ntions. That is\n(17)\nwhere\n(18)\nThis represents the applied move ratio for the th submove. If\n. The adoption of applied move\nratio avoids the potential nonconvexity below. Such a move\nstrategy leads to a fuzzy set which\nis convex, has the same Rep as , and its th point is located\nat the new, desired position , i.e.,\n, and .\nIn summary, if given move ratios\n, the submoves\ntransform a given normal and convex set\nto a new normal and convex set with the\nsame lengths of supports and the same Rep.\nIn the converse case, where two convex fuzzy sets\nand of the\nsame representative value are given, the move ratio as\n, are computed by\nif\nif\n(19)\nwhere is the \u2019s new position after the th submove.\nInitially, when . This (bottom) submove will\nnot lead to any nonconvexity below as there are no odd points\nunderneath, whilst the other submoves need to consider situa-\ntions where nonconvexity may arise both above and underneath.\nWhen and are not de-\nfined. In order to keep the expression the same for (19), both of\nthem take an infinite value. That is, the denominators in (19) are\nsimplified to and .\nSince and are both\nconvex, it is obvious that when and\nwhen .\nD. Algorithm Outline\nIn summary, scale and move transformations transfer a fuzzy\nset to another which has the same representative value as\n. Scale transformation scales up or down to retaining the\nratio between left and right slope, but having a different support\nlength. The closer the scale ratio to 0, the more similar and\n. Move transformation shifts to which has the same\nsupport length as , but has a different location for support.\nThe closer the move ratio to 0, the more similar and .\nBoth scale and move transformations guarantee the representa-\ntive value unchanged, and they both guarantee that the trans-\nferred fuzzy sets have the same type of shape as the original\none. For example, the transformation of a hexagonal fuzzy set\nwill lead to another hexagonal fuzzy set.\nAs indicated earlier, it is intuitive to maintain the similarity\ndegree between the consequent parts and\nto be the same as that between the an-\ntecedent parts and ,\nin performing interpolative reasoning. As scale and move trans-\nformations allow the similarity degree between two fuzzy sets to\nbe measured by the scale rate, scale ratios, and move ratios, the\ndesired conclusion can be computed from and scale rate,\nscale ratios, and move ratios calculated from to (as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 3 for an interpolation involving triangular fuzzy\nsets). The computation procedure is summarized as follows.\n1) Calculate scale rates of\nthe th support from to by\n.\n2) Calculate scale rate of the bottom support (or just get\nfrom the first step) and scale ratios (\nof the th support from to by (11) and (12).\n3) Apply scale transformation to with scale rates as cal-\nculated in the first step to obtain .\n4) Assign scale rate of the bottom support of to the\nvalue of (i.e., ), with the scale ratios\nof the th support of calculated as\nif\nif\n(16)\n18 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nFig. 3.

This is acceptable given that is not\nsignificantly large in most cases.\nTo explain the computation involved, an example is given as\nfollows.\nExample 1: Two rules and the obser-\nvations are given in order to determine the result . This\nexample concerns a trapezoidal interpolation. All the attributes\nand results with observation are shown in Table I\nTABLE I\nEXAMPLE 1\nFig. 4. Example 1: Normal interpolation.\nand Fig. 4. Consider the use of center of core Rep in this ex-\nample, and\nare calculated by interpolation of , and , respec-\ntively, with . This is calculated using (6).

Its value is 1.0 as has vertical\nleft slope. This move ratio is used to move to obtain the\nresultant fuzzy set . In this example,\nthe interpolation method resulted in a fuzzy set which still has\na vertical left slope.\nThe above review is given for the simplified cases where both\nrules involved in the interpolation have one antecedent attribute.\nThis is purely for easy illustration purposes. The work has been\ndeveloped to cover more general situations where the adjacent\nrules involve more than one antecedent attribute, as detailed\nin [1].\n(20)\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 19\nIV. EXTENSIONS\nAll fuzzy interpolation techniques in the literature assume\nthat two closest adjacent rules to the observation are available.\nAlso, most interpolation methods presume that such rules must\nflank the observation for each attribute (but not necessarily in\nthe same order). In practice, however, there may be a different\nnumber of the closest rules to a given observation, and the at-\ntribute values of these rules may lie just on one side of the obser-\nvation. In addition, some interpolation methods cannot handle\ncases where fuzzy sets with vertical slopes are involved. These\nlimitations inevitably restrict the potential application of the ex-\nisting techniques. Although fuzzy interpolation has been applied\nto control problems [20]\u2013[23], little has been done for tasks such\nas prediction and classification. To resolve this, the work of [1]\nis first extended herein to allow interpolations that involve mul-\ntiple multiantecedent rules, without making the strong assump-\ntion that antecedent attributes flank the observation. Further-\nmore, it is shown that exploiting the generality of this extension,\nextrapolation can be performed over multiple multiantecedent\nrules in a straightforward manner. This further extension to ex-\ntrapolation makes the work of [1] much more useful as demon-\nstrated in Section IV-B and the follow-up sections.\nA. Interpolation With Multiple Multiantecedent Rules\nTo allow fuzzy interpolation with more than two rules given a\nrule base, the first step is to choose closest rules from\nthe rule base. The choice of a larger will help approaching\nglobal consideration of neighboring rules in performing fuzzy\ninterpolation, thereby resulting in smoother decision surfaces.\nOn the contrary, the choice of a relatively smaller will tend\nto consider only neighboring rules, whilst taking less compu-\ntation time. The value of may be predetermined by trading\noff between the smoothness of decision surfaces and quick re-\nsponse of decision making. This requires a consistent use for a\ngiven application domain, in order to ease interpretation of the\ninterpolated results. In the experiments carried out in this paper,\nfor simplicity of illustration, only two or three closest rules are\nchosen to perform fuzzy interpolations. Then, selected rules are\nused to construct the intermediate fuzzy rule. Once the interme-\ndiate rule is worked out, the rest of the process remains the same\nas described in Section III. The following shows these two im-\nportant steps.\n1) Choose the Closest Rules: Without losing generality,\nsuppose that a rule and an observation are represented by\n(21)\n(22)\nAccording to the distance definition (5) between two fuzzy\nterms, the distances , between the pairs of\nand can be calculated as\n(23)\nAs attributes may have different domains, the absolute distances\nmay not be compatible with each other. To make these compa-\nrable, each distance measure is normalized into the range of 0\nto 1\n(24)\nwhere and are the maximal and minimal values of\nattribute given. The distance between a rule and an observa-\ntion can be calculated as the average of all attributes\u2019 distances.\nThe Euclidean version of the distance, which is to be used in the\nlater implementation, is, therefore\n(25)\nIf, however, the importance of attributes are not equal, weights\nmay be used. Note that if a conditional part of a rule is missing,\nthe distance of this attribute is treated as 0 to reflect that any data\nvalue is very close to the null attribute value. This allows for\nmeasuring the distances between a given observation and rules\nwhich may not have fuzzy sets associated with certain attributes.\nOnce the distance definition of (25) is given, the distances\nbetween a given observation and all rules in the rule base can\nbe calculated. The rules which have minimal distances are\nchosen as the closest rules from the observation. It is worth\nnoting that the closest rules do not necessarily flank the ob-\nservation. In the extreme case, all the chosen rules may lie on\none side, resulting in extrapolation rather than interpolation (see\nSection IV-B).\n2) Construct the Intermediate Rule: The main issue that re-\nmains is how to construct the intermediate rule after\nclosest rules have been chosen. Let\n, denote the weight to which the th term of the th\nfuzzy rule contributes to constructing the th intermediate fuzzy\nterm . Intuitively, the larger the distance from to is,\nthe less value should take. In particular, the inversion of the\ndistance can be used to act as the weight\n(26)\nwhere is defined as per (23). Of course, if desired, al-\nternative nonincreasing functions such as\nmay be adopted to assign different weights.\nFor each attribute , the weights , are used\nto compute the intermediate fuzzy term . Prior to that, they\nare normalized as follows:\n(27)\nso that their sum over attribute equals to 1. Therefore, the\nintermediate fuzzy term , are computed as\n(28)\nwhich correctly degenerates to (7) when only two rules\nare considered for interpolation. That is, the two-rule in-\nterpolation case is a special case of the generalized multirule\ninterpolation.\nIn the two-rule interpolation case, the calculated via (28)\nhas the same Rep as the input . However, this is generally\n20 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nFig. 5. Example 2: Interpolation with multiple rules.\nnot true when more than two rules are involved (that is why the\nsymbol , rather than , is used here). Thus, it does not sat-\nisfy the requirement, of having the same Rep value before and\nafter transformation, as imposed by the scale and move transfor-\nmation-based interpolation. In order to solve this problem, the\nprocess of shift is suggested to modify so that it becomes\na new intermediate fuzzy term which has the same Rep as\n. In particular, the shift of , is performed\nas follows:\n(29)\nwhere is a constant defined by\n(30)\nIn doing so, the following holds:\n(31)\nRegarding the consequent, by analogy to (28), the intermediate\nfuzzy output can be computed by\n(32)\nwhere is the mean of\n(33)\nis then shifted to as follows:\n(34)\nwhere and are maximal and minimal values of output\nattribute, and is the mean of the shift parameters\n(35)\nFrom this, the intermediate fuzzy rule\ncan be constructed via (29) and (34). The rest of the interpolation\nreasoning is, hence, applied to this intermediate rule and the\nobservation, in the same way as presented in Section III. An\nexample follows to explain how this works.\nExample 2: Three rules and\nthe observation, i.e., the observed values and for the two\nconditional attributes are given in Table II. For the first attribute\n, the distances between and the observed\nare calculated as 4, 4, and 8 respectively (assuming the center of\ncore Rep is adopted). According to (26), the weights are calcu-\nlated as 0.25, 0.25, and 0.13 respectively. They are normalized\nusing (27), resulting in the new weights of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2. Ac-\ncording to (28), a fuzzy term is obtained using\nthese normalized weights. As does not have the same Rep\nas the input , it is shifted so that it has the same Rep as .\nAccording to (30), is computed. The fuzzy term\nand are then used to generate the required intermediate\nfuzzy set . Similarly, is con-\nstructed with the normalized weights of and (0.33,\n0.44, and 0.22, respectively). is then computed\nbased on and . For the consequent, fuzzy set\nis computed using the average weights of at-\ntributes and (0.37, 0.42, 0.21) according to (32). The inter-\nmediate output is then calculated using the\naverage of and , that is , with respect to (34). The\noverall computational process is summarized in Fig. 5.\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 21\nFig. 6. Example 3: Extrapolation as a specific case of interpolation.\nTABLE II\nEXAMPLE 2\nB. Extrapolation\nThe extension of the above to perform extrapolation is readily\nattainable. It is a special case of interpolation as indicated in\nSection IV-A. In particular, when all of the closest rules\nchosen (see Section IV-A1) lie on one side of the given obser-\nvation, the interpolation problem becomes extrapolation. Both\nchoosing the closest rules and constructing the intermediate\nrule are carried out in the exactly same way as those procedures\nfor interpolation as described in Section IV-A.\nAn example follows to explain the computation. Suppose that\nonly the second and third rules in Example 2 are considered, the\ninterpolation becomes an extrapolation of two rules.\nExample 3: Two rules and the ob-\nservation as given in Table II are used to carry out fuzzy\nextrapolation in this example. Again, assume the center of core\nRep is used. For the first attribute , the normalized weights\nof are computed to be 0.67 and 0.33. According\nto (28), a fuzzy term is obtained. Since\ndoes not have the same Rep as , it has to be shifted. According\nto (30), is obtained.

That is, their associated fuzzy sets may not have the\nsame order (as in Example 3) for each attribute. The following\nillustrates this case.\nExample 4: Two new rules and\n, and the observation of Table II\nare given for fuzzy extrapolation.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFuzzy interpolation methods not only help reduce rule bases\nby removing fuzzy rules which can be approximated by their\nneighboring rules, but also support reasoning in sparse fuzzy\nrule bases. In this section, the truck backer-upper control\nproblem shows how the extension of work [1] (denoted as HS\nhereafter) helps simplify a fuzzy rule base. Further, the problem\n22 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nFig. 7. Example 4: Extrapolation with twisted rules.\nFig. 8. Truck backer-upper system.\nof computer activity prediction shows how the extension serves\nas a fuzzy inference mechanism for a sparse rule base. In\naddition, results are compared to those obtained by the most\nwidely used fuzzy inference method, Mamdani inference, and\nby other interpolation-based inferences, including the general\n[9], QMY [7], and linear HS method [24].\nA. Truck Backer-Upper Control\nTo demonstrate the usage of the extended interpolation\nmethod, the truck backer-upper problem [25]\u2013[28] is consid-\nered in this section. This problem is a well-known benchmark\nin nonlinear control and, thus, has attracted much interest in the\nliterature. It can be illustrated in Fig. 8: The small cab is the\ntruck whose behavior can be determined by three state variables\nand , where and\nare the coordinate values for horizontal and vertical axes\nrespectively, and is the azimuth angle between the horizontal\naxis and the truck\u2019s onward direction. The truck begins from\na certain initial position and should reverse to the\ndesired end point (50, 200) with desired azimuth angle 90. To\ncontrol the truck, the steering angle should be\nprovided after every small move made by the truck. The control\nproblem can, thus, be formulated as . Typically,\nit is assumed that enough clearance between the truck and the\nloading dock exists so that the truck y-position can be ignored,\nsimplifying the controller function to .\nThis example involves the case of FISMAT [29], which has\nnine fuzzy rules as shown in Fig. 9, with each row interpreted\nas a fuzzy rule\nwhere and are the linguistic labels of the system vari-\nables. Controlled by these nine fuzzy rules, the truck backing\ntrajectories for four initial points are shown in Fig. 10. All four\ntrajectories roughly converge to the destination point (50, 200).\nThe reaching positions of these four trajectories are given in the\nsecond row of Table III.\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 23\nFig. 9. Membership functions for nine rules.\nFig. 10. Trajectories from the use of nine fuzzy rules.\n24 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nTABLE III\nREACHING POSITIONS\nFig. 11. Trajectories from the use of six fuzzy rules.\nFor this illustrative example, such an expert fuzzy controller\nmay not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, thanks to the\ncurrent computational potential. Yet, in general, the number of\nrules increases exponentially as the input variables and the fuzzy\nlinguistic labels associated with each variable increase. This is\nbecause each domain partition has to be covered by at least one\nfuzzy rule, without the use of interpolation, in order to ensure\ncompleteness of the inference.\nIt is, however, interesting to notice that, for the given rule\nbase, domain partitions appear to be symmetrical in some sense.\nFor example, rule 4 and rule 6 are symmetrical if they are mir-\nrored by rule 5: both rules 4 and 6 have the same , and they are\nsymmetrical for attribute and from rule 5\u2019s point of view.\nThis indicates that rule 5 can be interpolated by rules 4 and 6,\nand, therefore, it may be removed from this fuzzy controller.\nSimilarly, rules 2 and 8 may be removed as they can be interpo-\nlated by rules 1 and 3, and rules 7 and 9, respectively. In doing\nso, a much more compact fuzzy controller which consists of\nonly six fuzzy rules is obtained. The trajectories and reaching\npositions of the truck controlled by the remaining six fuzzy\nrules, without interpolation, are respectively shown in Fig. 11\nand the third row of Table III. It can be seen that the reaching\npositions still roughly converge to the destination point.\nHowever, as the rule base becomes more sparse (due to the\nremoval of rules 2, 5, and 8), it is possible that no fuzzy rules\nmay fire for a given observation (truck state here), although this\ndoes not happen in this particular experiment. Yet, if the firing\nstrength threshold is set to be 0.7 (that is, any rule fires only if\nthe firing strength is greater than 0.7), then no rule fires given the\nobservation whose is around 50 and is around 90. This leads\nto the sudden breaks of the trajectories as shown in Fig. 12.\nFuzzy interpolation technique can be employed to support the\napplication for this problem. A possible solution is to predeter-\nmine a threshold to decide which inference mechanism (Mam-\ndani or fuzzy interpolation based) should be applied. That is,\nfor a given observation under certain firing strength, the rule\nbase should be treated as sparse. Therefore, the interpolation-\nbased inference becomes a natural choice where otherwise no\nrules may fire. In this experiment, the threshold is set to be\n0.72 after several trials. With the interpolation using two closest\nrules, Fig. 13 and the fourth row of Table III show the results\nof performing inferences by following this approach (with the\nthreshold set to 0.72). It is interesting to note that all four trajec-\ntories better converge to the destination, although with a slightly\nmore azimuth error.\nThis experiment clearly demonstrates that the interpolation\nmethod can help to simplify a given rule base and to support\ninferences in a sparse rule base. First, it removes the fuzzy rules\nwhich can be approximated (interpolated) by their neighboring\nrules, resulting in a more compact rule model. This alleviates\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 25\nFig. 12. Sudden breaks of trajectories for six fuzzy rules with rule-firing threshold being 0.7.\nFig. 13. Trajectories from interpolation with six fuzzy rules.\nthe curse of dimensionality by keeping important rules only,\nrather than using all possible rules. Second, as an alternative\nfor performing traditional fuzzy inferences (such as Mamdani\nand Sugeno), it helps generate the results even when no fuzzy\nrules may fire with certain firing strengths for the traditional\napproaches.\nB. Computer Activity Prediction\nThe computer activity database [30] contains a collection of a\ncomputer system activity measures. It includes 8192 cases, with\neach involving 22 continuous attributes. The task is to predict\nthe numeric value of attribute usr based on all other attributes.\n26 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2008\nFig. 14. Relative squared error of fuzzy ID3s.\nIn this experiment, the database is divided into a training and\na test dataset. The training dataset covers approximately\nof the whole database (5462 cases, to be precise) and the test\ndataset containing the rest. As there exists redundant or less rel-\nevant information in the initial 22 attributes, feature selection is\ncarried out to select the most informative ones. For simplicity,\nthe correlation-based feature subset selection [31], [32] is used\nand it selects 11 (read, small, sread, swrite, exec, rchar, pflt, vflt,\nrunqsz, freeswap, and usr) attributes.\nThe well-known fuzzy ID3 training scheme [33] is adopted\nto form fuzzy rule bases on which different fuzzy inference\nmethods including Mamdani and interpolation-based ones, can\nbe applied and then compared with each other. For simplicity,\nthe triangular fuzzy sets are used and they are assumed to be\nevenly distributed over each attribute domain. Fuzzy ID3 with\ndifferent configurations (in terms of the number of fuzzy sets\nand the number of minimal leaf objects) are carried out and the\nrelative squared errors (relative to the simple average predictor)\nare shown in Fig. 14. This reveals a general trend in that the\nmore fuzzy sets used in the training, the better performance the\nresulting rules have. However, the number of rules may become\nvery large at the same time. For instance, with the number of\nminimal leaf objects being 1, the resulting rule base size quickly\nincreases from 55 to 477 if the number of fuzzy sets increases\nfrom 3 to 7. For comprehensibility a fuzzy decision tree which\nhas 47 rules and an error rate of 13.29% is chosen (where the\nnumber of fuzzy sets is six per attribute and the number of min-\nimal leaf objects is 480) to be used in comparing different fuzzy\ninference methods. Note that in this rule base, four among the\n2730 test data are not fired by any of the 47 rules using Mam-\ndani inference. That is, the obtained rule base is not complete,\ninvolving sparse regions.\nThe errors shown in Fig. 14 are those produced by using\nMamdani fuzzy inference. Now, the interpolation-based infer-\nence techniques are compared against it using the same rule base\nand same test data. Note that the methods used here, including\ngeneral [9], [10], QMY [7], linear HS [24], and HS methods all\nmake use of intermediate rules in performing interpolation. In\nparticular, the solid cutting method [10] and the revision prin-\nciple-based technique [9] are deployed amongst the family of\ngeneral interpolations. Other methods such as KH [2], [34], and\nmodified KH [12], [35], which perform without making use of\nintermediate rules, are not considered here.\nIn this experiment, the test dataset may be preprocessed be-\nfore use. In particular, the data are fuzzified to isosceles trian-\ngular fuzzy sets, by assigning appropriate support lengths with\nthe center of a fuzzified observation to be the same as its original\ncrisp value. For example, with respect to an attribute, fuzzi-\nfication assigns of the support length of the fuzzy terms\nthat are used in the rule base to that of the test data object.\nThis fuzzification is purely implementational. The reason for\napplying fuzzification is that the test data may not be precise\nin practice due to various factors in data collection. Of course,\nfuzzification 0 is allowed in which no fuzzification is performed.\nIt is possible that some attribute values of the intermediate\nrule exceed the domain limit of that attribute. This is because\nduring the construction of the intermediate rule, extrapolation\nmay be involved and it may lead to the intermediate fuzzy terms\nbeing out of range. Also, it is possible that the fuzzified test data\nexceed the domain limit. If either of these two cases occurs, gen-\nHUANG AND SHEN: FUZZY INTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION: A PRACTICAL APPROACH 27\nTABLE IV\nRELATIVE SQUARED ERRORS\neral interpolation ignores this attribute in performing interpola-\ntion as it simply cannot handle these two cases. For QMY and\nthe linear HS methods, they suffer from another problem as they\ncannot handle the case where the intermediate rule has a vertical\nslope (on either the left or right side) for a certain attribute. Such\nan attribute is ignored if it occurs. Fortunately, all these issues\nare not a problem for the HS method. Thus, no attributes would\nbe dropped in performing HS interpolations or extrapolations.\nThe results of using different methods with respect to various\nfuzzifications of the test data are shown in Table IV. The words\nwithin parenthesis indicate which type of Rep is employed for\nlinear HS or HS methods. Note that all the errors shown are\nthe average of the errors in interpolating two and three closest\nrules. These results clearly show that all interpolation-based in-\nferences (except some cases of the general interpolation) outper-\nform Mamdani inference. The reason of the poor performance\nfor the general is that it drops too many attributes during the\ninterpolation process (if either intermediate fuzzy terms or the\nfuzzified test data exceed the domain limit), leading to substan-\ntial information loss. On the contrary, as the HS method does not\nneed to drop any attributes, it generally results in a stable and\nhigh performance. QMY and the linear HS method are between\nthose two extremes. Nevertheless, they still generate better per-\nformance than that produced by Mamdani. It is worth noting\nthat the attribute dropping is not part of the general interpolation\nmethod, it is simply made so to facilitate comparisons. There\nmay exist other approaches, on which the general interpolation\ncan hopefully perform better.\nThe best performance is 6.22% when the HS or linear HS\ninterpolation is used and no fuzzification is made for the test\ndata. This error is even less than half of the original error rate of\n13.29%, which was produced by Mamdani inference. In addi-\ntion to the high performance, the interpolation-based inferences\nare capable of firing all test data including those that are not\nfired by Mamdani. It is worth noting that the fuzzification of the\ntest data with different support lengths does not significantly af-\nfect the prediction error of the HS method. If the average Rep\nis used for linear HS and HS, the results are exactly the same\nacross different fuzzifications. This is because the value of the\naverage Rep over a fuzzy set is exactly the same as the fuzzi-\nfied crisp value created from the defuzzification method used\n(namely, center of gravity) over the same fuzzy set. These re-\nsults clearly demonstrate the robustness of the HS method.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFuzzy interpolation does not only help reduce the complexity\nof fuzzy models, but also makes inference in sparse rule-based\nsystems possible. Although fuzzy interpolation techniques have\nbeen applied to control problems, they have not yet been re-\nported in prediction or classification applications in machine\nlearning sense as 1) almost all fuzzy interpolation techniques\nin literature unrealistically assume that there are two closest ad-\njacent rules available to the observation; 2) such rules must flank\nthe observation for each attribute; and 3) some interpolation\nmethods cannot handle the case when fuzzy sets with vertical\nslopes are involved.\nTo make fuzzy interpolation ready to be used in practice, this\npaper has further extended the work of [1] to deal with inter-\npolations that involve multiple multiantecedent rules, without\nmaking the strong assumption that antecedent attributes flank\nthe observation. Furthermore, exploiting the generality of this\nnewly developed method, extrapolation can be performed over\nmultiple multiantecedent rules in a straightforward manner.\nThis extension helps bridge the gap between theory and\napplication.\nTwo realistic applications, namely truck backer-upper con-\ntrol and computer activity prediction, are given in this paper to\nillustrate the potential of fuzzy interpolation (and indeed extrap-\nolation as well) in both rule base simplification and inference\nwith sparse rule bases. Comparative studies to Mamdani infer-\nence and other existing fuzzy interpolation methods have been\nprovided to show the success of the proposed method.\nFurther development on the proposed method may be desir-\nable in maximal accordance with Jenei\u2019s axioms [18]. Also,\nwork remains to investigate the possible implications of using\noptimized partition of a problem domain. However, this should\nnot affect the theoretical approach put forward both here and in\nthe original paper [1] which the present work is based on, since\nthe techniques developed do not rely on this implementational\nissue. In the experimental studies presented in this paper, only\nevenly partitioned datasets are used and these partitions are not\noptimized in any sense. It is, therefore, expected that with the\nuse of an optimized fuzzification mechanism, the performance\nof the proposed work may be further improved. It is also very\ninteresting to apply the work to more complex domains, perhaps\nin conjunction with the utilization of more powerful feature se-\nlection tools (e.g., [36]) than those used in this paper, in an effort\nto fully realize the aims of developing this practical approach.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for\ntheir helpful comments on this paper.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.
