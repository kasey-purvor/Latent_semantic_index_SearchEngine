Legal requirements about involving incapacitated adults in research were not consistently interpreted correctly.  Letters often lacked explicitness and clarity.

There is a need for improved clarity, explicitness, and accuracy when submitting and reviewing applications for ethical review of research in this area.   \n \n  INTRODUCTION \nThere are now two separate regulatory regimes governing research with adults who lack capacity to \nconsent in England and Wales: the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical \nTrials) Regulations 2004. The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 1 came into force in England and Wales \nin two stages in April and October 2007. The MCA offers, for the first time, a comprehensive legal \nframework for decision-making on behalf of adults (aged 16 years and over) who lack capacity to make \ndecisions for themselves. One of its novel features is a set of requirements governing how incapacitated \nadults can be involved in research. The Act thus clarifies a long-running area of concern for \nprofessionals and researchers, though it excludes clinical trials of investigational medicinal products \n(CTIMPs). 2\nCTIMPs involving adults who lack capacity are regulated separately by the Medicines for Human Use \n(Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. \n \n3\nThe National Research Ethics Service (NRES) has designated around 30 RECs to receive applications \nunder the MCA, and these RECs have been given special training. Applications to conduct CTIMPs must \nalso be considered by separate specialist (\u2018recognised\u2019) RECs.  RECs issue decision letters in response \nto applications, which may give one of three opinions (Box 1). It has been suggested that researchers \nshould work closely with Research Ethics Committees (RECs) to ensure that the stipulations of the MCA \nare followed, \n Though there are many similarities between the two regulatory \nregimes (Figure 1), there are important differences. In particular, CTIMPs require consent from a legal \nrepresentative; non-CTIMPs require consultation with a consultee.  \n4\nSERVICE EVALUATION: METHODS \n but little is known about how RECs have interpreted its requirements or those of the \nCTIMPs regulations in relation to incapacity. In this paper, we report a service evaluation of how RECs \nhave responded to legal requirements governing adults who lack capacity to consent to research. \nWhen applying for REC approval, researchers are required to declare (by ticking a box on the electronic \napplication form) whether they plan to include adults unable to consent for themselves in their research. \nAs part of a service evaluation commissioned by NRES, we analysed anonymised REC decision letters \nabout applications where this box had been ticked. NRES advised that ethics committee approval was \nnot required for our project because of its status as service evaluation. Researchers\u2019 applications \nthemselves could not be analysed without permission from the applicants and were not included in the \nanalysis.  \nWe were interested in applications involving adults who lacked mental capacity both before the \npublication of the MCA in April 2005 and after its implementation in October 2007. We therefore \nconstructed two sampling epochs: a pre-MCA epoch (1st March 2004 - when the database began - to 1st \nApril 2005) and a post-MCA epoch (1st October 2007 to 28th February 2008 - when our service \nevaluation began). For purposes of this analysis, because we were interested in RECs\u2019 interpretation of \nthe Clinical Trials Regulations and the Mental Capacity Act, we included CTIMPs projects from both \nepochs, but for non-CTIMPs projects we focused only on letters issued after the implementation of the \nMCA.  \nOur inclusion criteria were that: the application indicated that the research would involve adults who \nlacked capacity; it was a full application for a new study (not a site-specific assessment or a protocol \namendment for example); the application had been submitted to a REC in England or Wales; and the \napplication had received a provisional or unfavourable opinion. Our exclusion criteria were: the \napplication had received a favorable opinion at first review (thus providing little or no suitable text for \nanalysis); the application was withdrawn, deemed to be outside remit; and the applicants had ticked a \nbox indicating that the research involved children under 16, prisoners, young offenders, healthy \nvolunteers, those who could be considered to have a particular dependent relationship with the \ninvestigator, or other vulnerable groups. Although some RECs have recently been assigned as \n\u2018specialist\u2019 RECs to review applications involving adults with involving incapacity, this project sampled \nletters regardless of REC status. \nUsing the NRES database, we identified 308 applications meeting our criteria in the pre-MCA epoch, \nwhile there were 65 applications meeting our criteria in the post-MCA epoch. From each epoch, we \nrandomly selected (using a table of random numbers) 50 applications where the applicants indicated that \ntheir research involved adults who lacked mental capacity and met the other inclusion\/exclusion criteria. \nApplications where no letter had been uploaded to the database were excluded at this stage. As letters \nwere unavailable for 14 applications in the post-MCA epoch and a further application was ineligible \nbecause of reasons relating to the date, all 50 remaining applications were included \u2013 no further \nsampling was possible. \nTo conduct the analysis, we applied a coding scheme developed in previous studies by using \nethnographic content analysis and traditional content analysis.5 6 7  This coding scheme allows reliable \ncategorisation of the kinds of issues that RECs raise and how the RECs propose these be resolved. The \ncoding scheme was further refined in this project to address new themes identified in this project, \nspecifically in relation to legal issues pertaining to mental capacity. Using these methods allowed us to \ncombine powerfully a systematic and explicit approach to coding of data with a commitment to \ninterpretation and reflexivity. QSR N6 software was used to assist in the analysis.  RESULTS \n \nThe post-MCA epoch included 45 applications covered by the MCA, which we term the \u2018MCA letters\u2019 \nTwelve applications relating to CTIMPs were included in our sample: seven from the pre-MCA epoch \nand five from the post-MCA epoch. We term these the \u2018CTIMPs letters\u2019.  \nTHE MCA LETTERS  \nThe 45 post-MCA letters had been considered by 21 different RECs. Most (38\/45) of these letters gave \napplicants a provisional opinion, meaning that some further modifications or response was required \nbefore a final decision could be issued. Of these initially provisional applications, all except one (for \nwhich the decision was unavailable at the time of analysis) were subsequently given a favourable \nopinion. Seven of the 45 applications were issued with an unfavourable opinion at first review. The \nunusually high rate of unfavourables (15%, compared with the normal rate of 8%)7\nIn 25 of the 45 letters, RECs explicitly showed that they were concerned with ensuring compliance with \nthe Mental Capacity Act. In two letters, RECs explicitly declined to approve the proposed project for \npurposes of the MCA. In 11 letters, they were concerned with processes of conducting research \ninvolving adults who lack capacity, including how capacity could be assessed. \n  might be due to \nresearchers\u2019 unfamiliarity with the MCA regulations or the stringent implementation of the regulations by \nRECs, but with the small numbers involved it is difficult to be certain about whether this is a genuine \ndifference in rates of unfavourable opinions. \n\u201cThe Committee raised concern about obtaining consent at a time of distress and in a population \nwith high levels of illiteracy. The Committee would like clarification on how this will be dealt with \nand how lack of capacity to consent would be assessed.\u201d (Letter A11, non-CTIMP, provisional \nopinion then favourable) \nHowever, despite their evident engagement with issues of mental incapacity, RECs were not consistently \nfully explicit or correct in their interpretation of MCA requirements. We judged that 15 of the 21 RECs did \nnot provide completely clear, explicit or correct advice about the MCA, particularly in relation to \njustifications for including people who lack capacity and the consultee process. \nJustification for including people who lack capacity \nUnder the MCA, research involving, or in relation to, a person lacking capacity may be lawfully carried \nout only if an \u201cappropriate body\u201d (normally a REC) approves it. RECs must judge the research against \nset criteria (Box 2).  In 15 of the 45 MCA letters, RECs raised issues about whether people with \nincapacity to consent should be included or excluded from research. Only a small proportion (8\/45) of \nletters commented explicitly on the justification for including people with capacity in the research, and a \nsmaller proportion (5\/45) commented explicitly on whether the research would benefit people with \nincapacity. These small numbers may well be because the applicants provided sufficient information to \nreassure RECs, and RECs may therefore have felt no need to comment. However, given the \nrequirements of the MCA in relation to these matters, and the need for accountability, it is worth \nconsidering whether RECs should be consistently explicit in endorsing the applicants\u2019 proposals \u2013 for \nexample by stating that \u201cthe REC considered and accepted your explanation for why the involvement of \npeople with incapacity was justified for this project and that it meets the requirements for benefits and \nrisks of research under the Mental Capacity Act 2005.\u201d \nConsultee process under the Mental Capacity Act \nThe MCA requires the researcher to take steps to identify a personal consultee who has a role in caring \nfor the person who lacks capacity or is interested in that person's welfare, but is not doing so for \nremuneration or acting in a professional capacity. 8\nThere was some evidence from RECs\u2019 comments in letters that applicants were not always clear about \nwhat was required to comply with the MCA. For example, applicants' proposals to use \u2018proxies\u2019 were \nrejected by RECs in two letters, since proxies are not recognised by the MCA. Six letters also corrected \napplicants who proposed to seek \u2018assent\u2019 from relatives\/carers, as the categories of \u2018assent\u2019 or \u2018assenter\u2019 \nare not legally recognised by the MCA .  \n In situations where there is no personal consultee \navailable, the researcher may identify a nominated consultee (e.g. a General Practitioner) who is not \nconnected with the research. The researcher must provide the consultee with information about the \nresearch project, and ask for advice on whether the person in question should take part in the project, \nand the consultee's opinion regarding the person's wishes and feelings about taking part if the person \nhad capacity. Importantly, the consultee gives advice, not consent, as under the MCA there is no \n\u2018consent\u2019 representing the presumed will of the participant in law.  \nCorrecting applicants: \u201cA separate form should be provided for consultees to sign. It should be \nsimilar to a consent form, but cannot use words such as assent or consent\u201d (Letter A60, non-\nCTIMP, provisional opinion then favourable) \nHowever, there was considerable evidence that RECs themselves were not consistently getting it right: \n27 of the 45 letters talked about the consultee process, but we judged that only one of these gave advice \nthat could be considered entirely correct and explicit. \nTen letters appeared to be giving inappropriate advice in relation to issues of assent\/consent, sometimes \nby accepting or endorsing what applicants themselves were proposing, and sometimes by actively \nrequesting changes. Three letters (all from the same REC) incorrectly advised applicants to obtain \nconsent from relatives\/carers. In seven letters (three from one REC and the remainder from four different \nRECs), applicants were inappropriately advised to obtain assent.  \nIncorrectly advising consent:  \u201cRelative assent form. The form should be rewritten as it does \nnot take into account the changes brought about by the Mental Capacity Act. It would be better to \ndescribe the sheet as \u2018Personal Consultee Consent Form\u2019 [...]\u201d (Letter A27, non-CTIMP, \nprovisional opinion then favourable) \nIncorrectly advising assent: \u201cplease change consent to assent if being given by one person on \nbehalf of another\u201d (Letter A47, non-CTIMP, provisional opinion then favourable) \nEighteen of the 45 letters (four from one REC, three each from two other RECs, and the remaining eight \nfrom different RECs) gave advice that might be considered ambiguous, lacking in clarity, misleading or \ncontradictory in relation to the type of person who could be consulted. For example, we found one letter \nthat referred to obtaining assent from legal representatives, even though the term \u2018legal representative\u2019 \ncan only be used in relation to CTIMPs. Letters frequently used terms such as \u2018carer\u2019 without making \nclear whether they were referring to paid or unpaid carers. Terms such as \u2019relative\u2019 and \u2019next of kin\u2019 were \nalso used, and could give the misleading impression that only people related to the patient could be \nconsulted, which is not what is intended by the MCA. Letters did not consistently use terms such as \n\u2018personal\u2019 and \u2018nominated\u2019 consultee explicitly or correctly. One letter, for example, described using a \n\u2018professional\u2019 consultee rather than a \u2018nominated\u2019 consultee. Only three letters used the term \n\u2018nominated\u2019. In three other letters (all from the same REC), applicants were incorrectly advised that paid \ncarers cannot act as consultees for the patient, failing to make clear that while paid carers may not be \npersonal consultees, they may act as nominated consultees as long as they are unconnected with the \nresearch project.  \nAmbiguity about carers acting as consultees: \u201cThe Committee requested reassurance that \nthe researchers are aware that paid carers are unable to act as consultees for patients in \naccordance with the Mental Capacity Act.\u201d (Letter A35, non-CTIMP, provisional opinion then \nfavourable) \nApplications to conduct clinical trials of investigational medicinal products \nOf the 12 CTIMPs-related letters in our sample, 10 issued provisional opinions (followed by favourable), \nand two issued unfavourable opinions at first review. The Clinical Trials Regulations implement the \nEuropean Union Clinical Trials Directive, 9\nThere was evidence in the letters we looked at that RECs were giving advice about seeking consent \nfrom legal representatives for CTIMPs, but did not consistently give fully correct or explicit advice. In four \nletters where advice was given about the consent process, the advice was in some way lacking in clarity \nor misleading. In two letters, RECs advised applicants (or endorsed applicants\u2019 proposals) to seek \nassent rather than consent.  No letter correctly and explicitly made clear the role and distinctions \n which specifies that people who are incapable of giving legal \nconsent to clinical trials should be given special protection. A medicinal product should only be \nadministered to someone who lacks capacity in a trial if there are grounds for expecting that the product \nwill produce a benefit to the person that outweighs the risks, or has no risk. The trial should relate \ndirectly to a life-threatening or debilitating clinical condition from which the person suffers.  In these \nrespects the Regulations therefore share similarities with the Mental Capacity Act. However, there are \nsome important distinctions. Rather than using consultees, the Regulations require that informed \nconsent be obtained on behalf of the patient from the patient\u2019s legal representative. This legal \nrepresentative must have no connection to the conduct of the trial, and may be a personal legal \nrepresentative (e.g. a relative or friend) or a professional legal representative, who should be \napproached if no personal legal representative is available and should be nominated by the relevant care \nprovider (e.g. NHS trust).  \nbetween the personal and professional legal representative, instead referring to relatives, next of kin, \ncarers and so on. Again, inappropriate views about who is entitled to consent on behalf of a participant \nmay thus be inadvertently encouraged. \nReference to next of kin: \u201cA consent form for next of kin should be produced if it was the \nintention to recruit adults without capacity to consent for themselves.\u201d (Letter A44, CTIMP, \nprovisional opinion then favourable) \nSources of mental incapacity mentioned by RECs \nMany REC letters about both CTIMPs and non-CTIMPs projects referred to different conditions that \nmight result in people losing capacity to consent to research. These included dementia\/Alzheimer\u2019s, \nilliteracy, terminal illness, learning disabilities\/cognitive impairment and unconsciousness. But we found \nno letters that commented on involving people with mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia or \npsychosis) that might interfere with capacity.   CONCLUSIONS \nBoth RECs and applicants need to be very clear about legal requirements in relation to involvement of \nadults who lack capacity in research. The law in this area is complex and confusing, with two different \nregimes with some similarities and some differences. Our analysis suggests that in the period \nimmediately following the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act, RECs were not always giving \nadvice to applicants that was consistent with the provisions of the Act.  There is a need for consistent, \naccurate, and explicit use of the terms used by the MCA in REC letters and in applications for REC \napproval. Neither consent nor assent from third parties are legally valid concepts for purposes of the \nMCA, yet it was suggested or endorsed in 10 of the 45 letters we examined. There was also evidence of \nconfusion about the consultee process. The terms \u2018personal consultee\u2019 and \u2018nominated consultee\u2019 need \nto be used consistently and explicitly, and both applicants and RECs need to be aware that paid carers \ncan act as nominated consultees. For CTIMPs, there is also need for RECs and applicants to recognise \nthat \u2018assent\u2019 is not the appropriate term, and that the terms \u2018personal legal representative\u2019 and \n\u2018professional legal representative\u2019 should be explicitly and consistently used. Terms such as \u2018relative\u2019 \nand \u2018next of kin\u2019 are to be avoided, as they are misleading and may exclude people who are eligible to be \nconsulted. \nWe would also suggest that RECs should explicitly accept or reject applicants\u2019 proposals regarding why \nthe involvement of people with incapacity is justified for each project, and whether the project will provide \nknowledge relevant to the condition (or similar condition) affecting the participant, or have potential \nbenefit for the participant without disproportionate risks. \nThe National Research Ethics Service, who commissioned this service evaluation, is already taking \nsteps to correct the problems identified by our analysis and there is an ongoing training programme on \nthe MCA for RECs. It is important that applicants are also aware of the legal requirements governing the \ninvolvement of adults who lack capacity to consent in research; they should prepare their applications \naccordingly and be well informed in their responses to REC decision letters. \n  \nAcknowledgements: We thank the National Research Ethics Service for funding this analysis.

The final opinion may be either favourable or unfavourable. An \u2018unfavourable\u2019 opinion (~8% of all submissions) at first review amounts to a rejection. RECs may also decide that applications are \u2018outside remit\u2019.  Some applications are withdrawn (~10% before review and ~2% after a provisional opinion has been issued).  *Data based on the period October 2005-March 2008 from the NRES website and refer to all applications. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBox 2: Criteria for approval of a research project involving adults who lack mental capacity The REC may only approve the research project if the research is linked to: an impairing condition that affects the person who lacks capacity or the treatment of that condition and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the research would be less effective if only people with capacity are involved, and the researchers have made arrangements to consult carers and to follow the other requirements of the Act. Research involving adults who lack capacity must meet one of two requirements: the research must have some chance of benefiting the person who lacks capacity, and this benefit should be in proportion to any burden of taking part, or the aim of the research must be to provide knowledge about the cause of, or treatment or care of people with the same impairing condition or a similar condition. If this is the case, the risks to the person with incapacity must be negligible, there must be no significant interference with the freedom of action or privacy of the person, and nothing unduly invasive or restrictive may be done.
