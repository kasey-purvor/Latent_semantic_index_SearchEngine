Although in the last analysis these heterodox \neconomies always remain decisively capitalist, there has been a growing \nacknowledgement of the plurality of competing forms in which capitalist \neconomies can be conceived and constructed. There is a great variety of \nliteratures that in various ways acknowledge this \u2013 institutional political economy, \nthe \u201evarieties of capitalism\u201f literatures, cultural political economy and so on (for \nexample Hudson, 2004; Peck and Theodore, 2007).   \n \nThe reasons for this growth of interest in diversity and variety of forms of \ncapitalism are complicated but there is no doubt that, in part at least, they reflect \na recognition that free-market capitalism, celebrating individualism, consumerism \nand pleonaxia (an Aristotelian concept denoting  excessive insatiable \nacquisitiveness), not only creates a yawning gap between the rich and poor but it \nalso threatens ecological sustainability and human well-being, greatly increasing \nthe risks to both economy and environment and indeed human life on the planet \nas we know it  A corollary of this is renewed interest in the regulatory role of the \nstate and in alternative ways of governing and organizing capitalist economies \u2013 \nor even tentatively exploring the implications of non-capitalist alternatives \u2013 in \nseeking different ways of reconciling economic imperatives with concerns as to \nenvironmental and social justice.  Nonetheless, while neo-liberal conceptions \nhave to a degree been selectively modified in practice in response to these \nvarious critiques and alternative views, they remain dominant in economic policy  \nand to pretend otherwise would be dangerously misleading but it would be \nequally misleading to deny the variety that does exist.  \n \nCapitalist economies and the accumulation process that is central to them are \npredicated upon the dominance of a narrow and very specific concept of value, \nwith the exchange value of commodities taking precedence over their use values.  \nIn terms of day-to-day economic practices, what therefore matters is the price of \ncommodities and \u201efictitious\u201f commodities such as labour-power. This immediately \n 3 \nraises questions as to how to value those things that cannot be priced and \nwhether the price attached to those things that can be priced reflects properly \ntheir ecological consequences and social value \u2013 an issue of central significance \nto those concerned with the social economy.  It also raises questions about the \nrelationship between \u201ethe economic\u201f and the \u201esocial\u201f1.  Put another way, raising \nquestions such as these recognises that a lot of \u201eeconomic\u201f activity beyond the \nmainstream is informed and motivated a diversity of values and ethical and moral \nconcerns \u2013 but also that to a degree the reproduction of the mainstream depends \non this being so and on the provision of certain things not being wholly \ncommodified, not least labour that can be purchased as labour-power as and \nwhen needed by capital. This raises intriguing and important questions as to the \nextent to which, and ways in which, the existence of a \u201esocial economy\u201f may be \nactually functional for mainstream capital accumulation rather than posing a \nradical challenge to it. \n \n \nCreating a space for the social economy \n \nThis renewed interest in the social economy and varied forms of social economy \norganisations (SEOs) must be situated in the context of a recognition of complex \nand diverse capitalist economies. For one result of this revived interest in the \ndiversity of capitalisms has been to create a space - theoretical, practical and \npolitical \u2013 for an (re)emergent interest in the social economy, broadly understood. \nThe recognition of a variety of forms of capitalism has created differing \nopportunities for the development of a social economy and for varying forms of \nSEOs to emerge and evolve and so helped define the substantive meaning of the \nsocial economy in specific times and places (for example, see Amin et al, 2002).  \nRecognising the diversity of organisational forms of SEOs and of the specific \nconcerns and values that motivate them, there is nonetheless one common \nshared distinguishing characteristic of all SEOs: that is, that  they are not \nconcerned with making a profit for distribution to individual capitalists and\/or \nprivate shareholders of capital but with providing, directly or indirectly, socially \nuseful goods and services, often explicitly in sustainable environmental ways,  \nthat would not otherwise be provided through the mainstream channels of \nmarkets .or state2. As such SEOs seek to create a space for humane, co-\n                                                 \n1\n Although this is not to suggest that the economy can ever be anything other than thoroughly and \nunavoidably social or that the social is thoroughly and unavoidably economic. The issue is about \nthe specific form of socio-economics and the prioritis that inform it. \n2\n The social economy can be defined as follows (NICDS\/CDS, 1999: 11):  \n \n\u201cThe \u201eSocial Economy\u201f constitutes a broad range of activities which have the potential to \nprovide opportunities for local people and communities to engage in all stages of the \nprocess of local economic regeneration and job creation, from the identification of basic \nneeds to the operationalisation of initiatives. The sector covers the economic potential and \nactivities of the self-help and co-operative movements, that is, initiatives that aim to satisfy \nsocial and economic needs of local communities and their members. This sector includes \nco-operatives; self-help projects; credit unions; housing associations; partnerships; \ncommunity enterprises and businesses. The Social Economy is the fastest growing sector \n 4 \noperative, and sustainable forms of social and economic organisation that are \n\u201ealternative\u201f to the markets of the mainstream economy and\/or the mechanisms \nof the state as ways of producing and distributing  goods and services3. \n \nThere is a wide range of forms of SEO \u2013 from large near market social \nenterprises (that seek to produce a surplus for social uses) to co-operatives to \nSEOs that rely heavily on direct funding from the state or state contracts to small \ncharitable organisations that rely wholly on voluntary labour (although \nvolunteering is widespread to varying extents among almost all forms of SEO \nand in that sense SEOs can be thought of forming part of as a gift economy). \nThese is a wide range of forms of SEO, and these have followed diverse and \nmultiple developmental trajectories. Reflecting different concepts of value and \nprocesses of valuation to those of the capitalist mainstream, such not-for-profit \nventures are established to supply services and goods to those abandoned  by \nmainstream enterprises  or by the welfare state. As such, they are seen to play a \nlargely social role, helping to meet social needs, empower the marginalised or \nunemployed, form an Intermediate Labour Market  bridge to help such people \nreintegrate into the formal economy, and sustain alternative lifestyles and \nsystems of survival, of \u201egetting by\u201f in difficult times and places.  Many are content \nto continue in this mode.  \n \nIncreasingly, however, there is an interest in some SEOs in exploring different \nways of creating jobs and wealth generation and assuming a more explicitly \neconomic role, seeking to become more market \u2013oriented, to become social \nenterprises, to trade their way to development and expansion. Such social \nenterprises have increasingly been seen as a legitimate form of economic entity \nby some social scientists, policy makers and practitioners alike.  Numerous \nGovernments and other policy makers have begun to introduce legislative \nchanges to recognise and support social enterprises, policy interventions to \nencourage their formation and growth, and discursive arguments placing the \nemphasis on  individual responsibility, enterprise and economic achievements.  \nIndeed, for some within the social economy, this risks compromising or \nconcealing the raison d\u201f\u00eatre of social enterprises (and even more so the work of \nthe broader spectrum of SEOs) in meeting otherwise unmet social needs.  \n \nIn the rest of this paper, I first further explore the motivations that lie behind the \nformation of SEOs and the multiple trajectories that these can then follow and the \ntensions to which this can give rise as the \u201esocial\u201f runs up against the \u201eeconomic\u201f. \n                                                                                                                                                 \nin Europe and this context is fertile ground for the creation of many new enterprises \nlocally\u201d.  \n \n3\n It is also worth noting that while mainstream private sector organisations have developed \nCorporate Social Responsibility programmes, and that this to a degree seems to blur the \nboundary between mainstream and social economies, these organisations remain primarily \nmotivated by the imperatives of accumulation and profitability and as such the qualitative divide \nbetween them and SEOs remains sharp. An analogous point can be made with regard to SEOS \nad major public sector organisations that develop CSR programmes. \n 5 \nThis can, and often does, involve competition between SEOs in limited local \nmarkets and in search of state grant income. For those that seek to transcend \nthese limits, the tensions between the \u201eeconomic\u201f and the \u201esocial\u201f can become \nmanifest and at times acute, especially as SEOs seek to become self-\nconsciously social enterprises, with a growing focus upon their economic role \nand contribution and trading as the route to growth. This typically leads them into \ncompetition with firms in the mainstream capitalist economy, engendering \ntensions between the need to survive in competitive markets and the ethical and \nsocial motivations that informed their original formation. There is a varying \ntension between \u201ethe social\u201f and \u201ethe economic\u201f in all SOEs, but this is especially \nevident in those constituted as, or that seek to transform themselves into, near-\nmarket social enterprises. Exploring how in practice this tension is dealt with and \nmanaged, how the ethical and moral issues that this tension gives rise to are \nhandled, is a major theme of the paper. I then return to broader questions as to \nimaginaries about the social economy and its role, of how these conceive of the \n\u201eeconomic\u201f and the \u201esocial\u201f and relations between them, of how the social \neconomy is seen in the policy and academic literatures in terms of its socio-\neconomic role,  in light of the evidence of how SEOs in practice handle the \ntensions between the \u201eeconomic\u201f and the \u201esocial\u201f. Finally I offer some reflective \ncomments as to the future for SEOs and the social economy and their \ncontribution to social and economic life. \n \n \nManaging the tensions between \u2018the social\u2019 and \u2018the economic\u2019 in social \neconomy organisations: some evidence from the UK4 \n                                                 \n4\n  This paper draws upon evidence collected in four large-scale collaborative research projects \ncarried out between 1997 and 2007 into the practices and experiences of social economy \norganisation in the UK and the EU, using a variety of sources of primary and secondary evidence \n(for fuller accounts, see Amin et al, 2002; Bennett et al, 2000). These projects provide the basis \nfor a considered and evidence-based account and assessment of the strengths, weaknesses and \nfuture potential of the social economy in these locations. The first of these projects was \ncommissioned by European Commission Directorate General XII\/G as part of its \u201eLocal Initiatives \nto Combat Social Exclusion in Europe\u201f. It involved an initial sample of almost 2,000 Third Sector \ninitiatives in the UK, as a basis for selecting 60 examples of \u201ebest practice\u201f for inclusion in a multi-\ncountry database of over 700 projects\n4\n.  The second project, funded by the UK\u201fs Economic and \nSocial Research Council, undertook a more critical, in-depth and place-based analysis of social \neconomy practice.  Rather than investigating isolated examples of best practice, it sought to \nexamine the dynamics of success and failure in different types of social enterprise (40 in total) in \na variety of local settings in Bristol, Glasgow, Middlesbrough and Tower Hamlets in London.  \nThese four areas were chosen to allow an exploration of the degree to which their widely differing \nlocal civic, political and economic conditions might explain variety in the form of the social \neconomy and in the vibrancy of SEOs in these places (for a fuller account, see Amin et al, 2002).  \nThe third project, also funded by ESRC, sought to build upon the preceding project, via an \nethnographic investigation of the social economies of Bristol and Manchester, seeking to fill an \nimportant gap in the literature and elucidate the everyday practices and micro-scale structures of \nsocial enterprises and the social economy, the trajectories of social economy organizations and \nof people into, within and out of the social economy. This is important, not least because public \npolicy tends to make untested assumptions about these issues. The final project was funded by \nthe Joseph Rowntree Foundation and examined the role of the social economy in the \nregeneration of former British coalfields, especially in Nottinghamshire and south Wales, but with \n 6 \n \nOne way to approach this issue is in terms of the life course and trajectory of \nSEOs; something of an ideal-typical sequence but one that is useful in illustrating \nthe shifting tensions between \u201esocial\u201f and economic\u201f, especially for those SEOs \nthat seek to become social enterprises. Given the differences that exist at the \nnational scale in the ways in which the social economy is constituted (for \nexample as a result of differing national regulatory regimes), it is important to \nrecognise that the revival of interest in the social economy in the UK came in the \ncontext of an enthusiastic adoption of neo-liberal economic policies by national \ngovernments, Conservative and Labour alike. In other national states the social \neconomy developed in markedly different contexts and ways and no claim is \nbeing made here for the general validity of the results reported below. Rather \nthey represent a solidly evidence-based account of developments in the UK. \n \nOrigins: ethical and social concerns and \u2018doing social good\u2019: while \nthere is a lot of emphasis in the literature (both academic and policy) on the \nactivities of serial social entrepreneurs \u2013 and in specific circumstances they can \nbe an important influence (for example, see Bennett et al, 2000) - there is less in \nthe way of empirical evidence to back up such generalised claims. In fact, the \norigins of SEOs more typically lie in the good intentions of a small number of \naltruistic individuals, motivated by ethical and\/or social concerns, voluntarily \ngiving their labour freely or working in poorly remunerated jobs, at much less \nthan the wage rates that they could command in the formal mainstream \neconomy. They are not primarily motivated by monetary concerns but work in this \nway because it provides a range of non-monetary satisfactions (for example, see \nBorzaga, 2008; Haugh, 2008). They do so in order to provide goods and services \nto disadvantaged people in disadvantaged places and to provide Intermediate \nLabour Market (ILM) organisations to help the long-term unemployed back into \nthe world of work and onwards into the mainstream labour market of the formal \neconomy.  \n \nThe origins of SEOs in ethical and social concerns with meeting otherwise unmet \nneeds are grounded in a recognition that there are possibilities to things and \nthings that need to be done, socially, that aren\u201ft done precisely because they \ndon\u201ft fall with the logic of the mainstream \u2013 in short, they aren\u201ft sufficiently \nprofitable to attract the private sector, nor politically strategic enough to warrant \ndirect state provision, especially in an era dominated by neo-liberal political-\neconomic concerns. SEOs typically seek to address issues to do with the \nenvironment, sustainability, re-cycling materials and reducing wastes, care for \nthe elderly, training for the young and not-so-young, tackling social exclusion and \nso on. Often such initiatives are found in places that have been ravaged by the \n                                                                                                                                                 \nsome attention to north east England and south Yorkshire. Seeking to explore in greater depth \nthe micro-scale social practices of the social economy, it deployed a mixture of in-depth \ninterviews, focus groups and participant-observation in ethnographies of place(for a fuller \naccount, see Bennett et al, 2000) .  \n \n 7 \nrestructuring of capital and that remain unattractive to the mainstream economy, \nsituated beyond the reach of major circuits of capital but are by no means limited \nto them.  \nThe reasons given for forming a SEO are typically a fusion of individual beliefs, \nvalues and motives and the specificities of place and institutional context.. For \ninstance, Five Lamps in Stockton-on-Tees, an area with serious problems of \nmultiple deprivation, began because  \n(i)n the late 1980\u201fs a handful of people chose to do something about the \nrising problem of unemployment in this area. Many have followed in their \nfootsteps as volunteers and workers, seeking to tackle the issues that are \ndestroying the quality of life for whole communities. The vision of those \npioneers means that the Five Lamps can celebrate two decades of \n'making people matter'. Countless lives have been changed for the better. \nAll because some people were willing to stand up and take action. (Five \nLamps, 2007).  \nAnother example of this theme of \u201emaking people matter\u201f and \u201estanding up and \ntaking action\u201f is provided by a SEO in a deprived area of Salford, Manchester, \nwhich emerged in response to a perceived need for better health care to \nenhance the health and well-being of local  residents and a desire to devolve \npower to local citizens. In the words of its director: \nWe know\u2026 that health care tends to be provided much more efficiently \nand effectively the wealthier and better social status that you have, so if \nyou really want to deal with health inequalities you actually have to put \nmore resources into areas of greatest deprivation, even in proportion to \nneed\u2026 What I am more bothered about is what difference do we make to \npeople\u201fs lives\u2026 and in order to do that we have to do it differently.5 \n \nThis ideal of \u201estanding up and taking action\u201f, \u201edoing it differently\u201f and \u201edoing \ndifferent things\u201f, informed by powerful ethical and moral imperatives and \nprincipled concerns to improve the lot of the disadvantaged, \u201emake a difference\u201f \nand \u201emake people matter\u201f, lies at the heart of the foundation of a great many \nSEOs and constitutes one of their key distinctive defining characteristics.  \n \n \nThe next steps \u2013 more of the same: for many SEOs it is enough to continue in \nthis mode of operation, maybe growing a little but with no ambition to transcend \nthe limitations that working in this way unavoidably brings. Indeed these are not \nseen as limitations but rather as affirmation of the ethical and moral importance \nof providing goods and services that otherwise would not be provided to those \nthat need them most. There are however a couple of points worth noting here. \nFirst, there are limited options in terms of the sorts of goods and services that \n                                                 \n5\n Interview by Chris  Hewson: 21\nst\n August 2006. \n 8 \ncan be provided in this way, typically in relation to meeting local needs in a small \narea, on the basis of largely voluntary labour with maybe a small number of paid \nstaff. As a result there is a tendency towards serial repetition of SEOs, all \ninformed by similar ethical and social concerns and  seeking to survive if not \nprosper by providing the same sorts of goods and services and a sort of \ncompetition between them within the social economy. In South Wales, for \nexample, there is a cluster of social economy projects in the valleys of the former \ncoalfields, most of which have established some form of community enterprise \nand SEOs using national (both UK Government and the recently established \nWelsh Assembly) and EU funds.  The range of activities among them is quite \nnarrow, consisting for the most part of semi-industrial potteries, carpentry \nworkshops, furniture exchanges, catering, garden centres and landscaping \nservices.  All of these activities are conducted on a very small scale, reflecting \ntheir primary objective of providing jobs and services within the immediate \nneighbourhood.  Whilst some of these SEOs are successful in meeting their own \ngoals, their capacity for expansion or diversification is limited.  They saturate the \nlocal market with similar products, and local labour markets can only absorb so \nmany people being trained in the same skills which are often unrelated to the \ndemands of the mainstream formal labour-market.  The same limited range of \nactivities serve the same set of local needs and chase the same limited local \ndisposable income.  The restriction on spending power further limits the \npossibilities of diversifying into \u201enew\u201f products and services.  Despite exhortations \non the part of social; economy umbrella organisations that locally-focused SEOs \nshould seek to break out of their immediate local areas, very little is done in \npractice to overcome the inherent limitations of the activities pursued (West \n1999).  \n \nAcceptance of these limitations has a number of consequences, however. Firstly, \nthose SEOs offering poorer quality products and services, in a context of \nrestricted demand for them and competition from others offering better quality \ngoods and services, tend to fail or are struggle to survive.  Such weaker SEOs \ntypically have been born out of a response to a highly localised problem, without \nanalysis of the potential for sustained demand for the goods and services they \nprovide.  In these circumstances their capacity to meet their social objectives is \neroded by the economics of markets within the social economy and their demise \nas SEOs.  Secondly, insofar as SEOs operate as ILM organisations, there is a \nlimited range of skills that they cam impart and these too can be over-produced, \nswamping local labour markets with people chasing the same limited set of \nopportunities. \n \nThe uneven development of SEOs within the social economy can have perverse \neffects in further widening inequalities. Many places, especially areas of marked \nsocial exclusion and deprivation (as are clearly shown in England by data from \nsuccessive Indices of Multiple Deprivation, for example), are often those bereft of \nthe sorts of local capacities, resources and requisite skills that can facilitate the \nemergence of successful SEOs and sustain a vibrant social economy. Contrary \n 9 \nto optimistic communitarian and policy perspectives,  insofar as a fledgling social \neconomy in such places, it comprises either highly precarious and short-lived \nSEOs that fail to meet local needs or SEOs reliant upon public sector leadership, \nperipatetic professionals and social entrepreneurs, or dedicated organisations \nsuch as religious or minority ethnic bodies. \n \nInsofar as such SEOs, especially those in multiply disadvantaged places, require \nfunding to remain economically viable in order to meet their ethical and social \nobjectives, this tends to come from the state \u2013 either directly in the form of grants \nor indirectly in the form of (sub)contracts. Typically there is a heavy reliance upon \npublic subsidy or public sector sub-contracts to provide markets. The majority of \nSEOs (even well-known \u201csuccess stories\u201d) rely heavily on grant income and\/or \nservice level contracts with public authorities.  An analysis of 195 SEOs from \nthroughout the UK between 1997 and 2000 for which data were available \nrevealed that 67% were wholly reliant on public funds and a further 21% relied on \nthe public purse for at least 70% of their income (Amin et al, 2002).    The \nalternative that the social economy offers with respect to the public sector, \ntherefore, is less one of providing a different way of generating resources than a \ndifferent way of using and distributing them. This creates a potentially dangerous \nrelationship of dependence on the state and can, as a result, create tensions \nbetween meeting the \u201eeconomic\u201f output\/outcome targets required to qualify for \nfunding and the \u201esocial\u201f and ethical concerns that drive SEOs. It can also create \ntensions as a result of the accounting and monitoring requirements of funders, \ndiverting work time from doing the socially useful work of providing needed goods \nand services to filling in forms to renew \u2013 or more generally seek new sources of \n\u2013 funding and the complying with the differing accounting and monitoring \nrequirements of multiple funders. Crucially, however, all cannot win in the \ncompetition for grants: there necessarily are \u201flosers\u201f as well as \u201ewinners\u201f (and this \nis one reason why some SEOs seek to break free from the world of grant \ndependency: see below). \n \nIn drawing attention to the close relations between many SEOs and the state as \na source iof funding, it is important not to obscure the point that relations with the \nmainstream private sector and economy can, in some circumstances,  be \nimportant in helping sustain SEOs economically, albeit precariously and \nunevenly.  In places where the private sector economy is strong, such as in \nLondon and Bristol, SEOs have been able to derive considerable benefits.  \nThese include the secondment of staff from local firms, the acquisition of \nmaterials and financial donations, and the capacity of local labour markets to \nabsorb trainees coming through ILM organisations. In these circumstances SEOs \ncan draw upon the mainstream economy for help and resources in meeting their \nsocial objectives: the \u201eeconomy\u201f of the mainstream and the \u201esocial\u201f goals of SEOs \ncan therefore, in some circumstances, be made to be, to a degree, compatible. In \ncontrast, where the needs for alternative forms of provision through the social \neconomy are often greatest, as in deindustrialised urban areas and former \ncoalfield settlements and other mono-industrial places, the private sector \n 10 \neconomy is much weaker. As a result, such links cannot develop precisely \nbecause there is insufficient density of private sector firms to provide the required \naggregate level of support (for example see Lang, 2008). In these circumstances, \nthe \u201eeconomy\u201f of the mainstream and the \u201esocial\u201f objectives of SEOs are dis-\narticulated and simply do not connect. \n \nMoving nearer the mainstream market: breaking the mould, creating \nhybrid forms and the transition to become a social enterprise?: for reasons \nthat have already been alluded to above, some SEOs do seek to expand the \nlimitations of their local origins and the constraints of the social economy by \npushing out their boundaries into the space of mainstream markets, seeking to \nexpand the scope and scale of their activities via developing new lines of activity \nand trading in spatially more extensive markets. Successful ethically and socially-\ndriven SEOs that offer a quality product, perhaps with a unique selling point with \npotential beyond the local economy, and in markets of secondary interest to \nmainstream private sector firms or public welfare organisations can flourish.  \nTypical niches in which SEOs can flourish include art materials for childcare \norganisations, recycled electrical goods and furniture for low-income groups, low-\nbudget catering, shopping catalogues distributed by the homeless, and targeted \nservices for ethnic minorities, the elderly or particular disadvantaged groups. \n \nThere are numerous examples of SEOs that have sought to transform \nthemselves into social enterprises (SEs) and to expand beyond their, typically \nlocal, roots and areas of operation. Moreover, they seek to expand by taking a \nshare of mainstream markets, either by developing new lines of business or \nseeking to compete in their existing areas, entering direct competition with \ncapitalist firms in those markets and impinging on the spaces of the mainstream. \nHowever, typically in so far as such SEs seek to grow, and become less reliant \nupon state funding and free labour and more reliant upon income from trading, \ntwo things happen: first, this creates tensions between their social origins and \nobjectives and their ethical and moral motivations and the imperatives of \u201ethe \neconomy\u201f; secondly, it potentially increases competition between the dominant \nmainstream and the alternative to the mainstream, As a result, the latter \nincreasingly looks like and behaves like the former.  \n \nPut another way, while ethical and social concerns are central to SEOs they are \nof necessity reconciled with a more pragmatic acknowledgement of other \ninfluences as they seek to grow and, especially so if they seek to become SEs. \nAs Julie Graham and Janelle Cornwell (2008, 29) have put it, such SEOS grow \nand develop \u201cthrough what we have called ethical negotiation, in which different \nprinciples, projects and participants are brought into balance\u201d. However, \u201c[f]or all \nthe simplicity of their guidelines and maxims, it is clear that to be a community-\nled, evolving organisation is not a simple or straightforward process. There\u201fs no \nobvious or automatic way forward\u201d   Often, then, this reconciliation is an \nexperimental  trial-and-error process of learning-by-doing, an open-ended \nprocess  with no pre-defined end point. Sometimes it may reflect the internal \n 11 \ndynamic of the SEO but it may also reflect a response to external pressures and \nopportunities. For instance, SOFA (Shifting Old Furniture Around) in Bristol \nsought to increase capacity in order to position itself as a key local and regional \nplayer in the emerging Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) \nmarket. This exemplifies the way in which such organisational development may \nbe shaped by selectively targeted responses to opportunities \u201eas and when\u201f they \ntranspire. Nonetheless, such local responses can be intimately connected to \nwider social and ethical concerns expressed though state regulation \u2013 in this \ncase the EU WEEE directives which came into force (in the UK) in January 2007. \nA second example is provided by a social enterprise in Bristaol which provides a \nsupported design and woodworking environment for clients with mental health \nneeds, its founder viewing the organisation as marrying his experience, in the \nwoodworking industry, with an external social objective:  \n \n\u201cto fill the gap in day services employment\u2026 what we really wanted to do was \nprovide something that was going to be there for a long, long period of time, \nthe people could come in and access \u2013 some of those people were less likely \nto access open employment [so] it was to provide a work environment for \nthem forever, that\u201fs pretty much where we feel we are now.\u201d6  \n \nThis organisation detached itself from the local Primary Care Trust (PCT), \ncontracting its services back to the NHS at \u201emarket rate\u201f, in an attempt to secure \na potentially more sustainable future. The wish to secure the provision of \nservices for a \u201elong period of time\u201f highlights two key dilemmas. Firstly, that \narising from a wish to respond to opportunities which promise a solution to \nimmediate issues of economic survival balanced against wider moral, social and \nethical concerns. Secondly, that arising from the nature of the SEO as \n\u201eintermediary\u201f positioned between civil society and the realm of formal \nmainstream labour market.  \n \nThere are many other instances of well-established SEOs actively promoting an \nincreased \u201ebusiness orientation\u201f, buying into and deploying these new discourses \nin a way that is directly related to an ability to respond and adapt to a number of \nopportunities offered in the contemporary economy. A typical example comes \nfrom an SEO that seeks to address community needs for transport in Bristol, \nwhich was able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by new funding \nschemes. Its manager explaining how explained  \n \nwe were able, in partnership with Bristol City Council, to secure a \ngovernment grant under the Urban Bus Challenge\u2026 over the last two \nyears [we\u201fve]\u2026 started the community buses off, and we\u201fre hoping to \nkeep them rolling out because the funding is coming through now, and it \nwill probably run out about April\/May next year\u201d.7  \n \n                                                 \n6\n Interview by David Land: 2\nnd\n August 2006. \n7\n Interview by David Land: 28\nth\n November 2006. \n 12 \nThis is simply one of a number of examples in which core activities have been \nmodified and\/or extended in response to opportunities as they arise. This \nprocess is tempered by the knowledge that opportunities and funding streams \nare invariably time-limited, and concomitantly additional openings must \nconstantly be identified. However, this model of \u201egrowth through opportunity\u201f is \nnot always guaranteed to be a smooth one. Nonetheless, there are pressures to \ndevelop new hybrid forms of organisation to retain a focus on ethical and social \nconcerns while recognising the material realities of the political economy of \ncapitalist social relationships. At many SEOs there is a perceptible struggle \nbetween ethical and pragmatic, social versus economic, concerns, with questions \narising as to the extent to which the founding vision of the organisation can thrive \nwhen confronted with the economic realities of the markets within which the \norganisation has been positioned \u2013 or has chosen to position itself. \n \nThe need to create and sustain viable forms of hybrid organisation as an SEO \nmoves more in the direction of becoming a SE was highlighted by the director of \nan organization in Bristol  seeking to manage the tensions that this generated, \nwho noted that: \n \nIt\u201fs not just an ordinary business, my work would be much easier if we did \nstuff more cheaply, employed trained people, sourced the cheapest \nmaterials, ran more of a sweatshop. It\u201fd be easier to get stuff made in \nChina!  You know \u2013 half the price, half the hassle, fantastic sellers, but \nthat\u201fs not actually the point.8 \n \nPrecisely because these organisations are not just \u201eordinary businesses\u201f, the \nextent to which any particular \u201eadditional\u201f element and modification to the way in \nwhich they work is necessary is often the key point of contention. SEOs that seek \nto become SEs and as such become more exposed to the vicissitudes of \nmainstream economic markets are less clearly delineated from mainstream \nbusinesses in terms of their management style and business objectives (although \nthey may of course the distinguished through other factors). SEOs that are \nattempting to generate new outcomes \u2013 and attempting to either work within new \nmarkets, or provide a new way of working across different existing markets \u2013 \nmay be more likely to achieve the transition to become economically sustainable \nsocial enterprises because they offer something which public sector \norganisations do not. Those organisations are also more likely to find a niche in \nthe market, and may have the potential to expand further. Conversely, SEOs that \nthat are unable to find such a market or product niche or create a distinctive way \nof working must differentiate themselves from non-SEO organisations through a \nstress upon their non-profit, ethical or otherwise social character.  \n \nThere are a number of examples of SEOs that have made the transition to \nsuccessful social enterprise. Some of the larger and better established social \nenterprises in the UK have made the transition because they have been able to \n                                                 \n8\n Interview by David Land: 27\nth\n March 2007. \n 13 \ncircumvent the limitations of the local by operating on much bigger and\/or \nmultiple scales.  Such organisations are effectively detached from any identifiable \narea or community, sometimes operating up to and including the national level.  \nPerhaps the clearest example of this is the Wise Group which is routinely cited \nas an exemplar of best practice in the \u201elocal\u201f social economy (see, for example, \nSEU 1998).  When it first began in the early 1980s, Wise\u201fs services (provision of \ninsulation, security devices and landscaping in areas of social housing combined \nwith training) were delivered by community-based \u201esquads\u201f scattered throughout \nGlasgow and responsible for particular local areas, neighbourhoods and\/or \ncommunities.  As the project has grown, however, the Wise intermediate labour \nmarket in Glasgow has become organised on a city-wide basis, with all \noperations based in its Charlotte Street offices. Following changes in the nature \nof employment services and Scottish devolution, Wise has taken on an \nincreasingly regional and national role, looking to expand further as a provider of \ntraining and work-experience throughout the UK, developing a number of \nsubsidiaries and associated projects in other cities which, although more or less \nlocal depending on the nature of the local labour market, follow a model \ndeveloped elsewhere.  This is serial repetition of a rather different kind.  \n \nThe ability to work beyond the local market has also contributed to the economic \nand political success of other successful social enterprises.  The Furniture \nResource Centre has been able to become financially independent in large part \nbecause of the wide social housing market that it has been able to tap into \nthroughout Merseyside and, increasingly, the rest of England.  Without access to \na market on this scale, it would not have been able to grow or to diversify into \nother forms of social provision, recycling, training and manufacturing (Frances \n1988).  Similarly, Coin Street Community Builders (CSCB) has been successful \nprecisely because its location in central London has allowed it to transcend the \nlimitations of local demand alone.  As CSCB has developed local housing co-\noperatives, increasing amounts of private-sector housing have been developed \non adjoining sites, attracted by the associated infrastructural and environmental \nimprovements created by the project.  By targeting its workspaces at the \nparticular niche market of young creative designers, CSCB has been able to \nbring in a range of new industries and effect a considerable change in the nature \nof the local economy.  More importantly, perhaps, the concentration of designers \nwithin one of the project\u201fs main building, the Oxo Tower, attracted further large \nnumbers of designers, artists and their various customers and collectors to an \narea that they would previously have avoided.  By encouraging the development \nof small cafeterias and bistros, as well as an internationally renowned restaurant, \nCSCB has been able to exploit the presence of large numbers of people working \nin local businesses and, increasingly, tourists and bon-viveurs from throughout \nLondon and beyond.   \n \nIn brief, local services have been created for local people by CSCB but the \nresources assembled to enable this have not been exclusively those of local \npeople.  Rather, CSCB has been able fundamentally to alter the boundaries of \n 14 \nthe local economy by breaking down economic, social and political barriers that \npreviously isolated this particular part of the inner-city from the rest of London.  \nThis was greatly helped by the fact that Coin Street is situated within the wealthy \nand complex London economy. As a result, the process of \u201ereconnection\u201f has \nbeen very much easier than it would have been in more physically isolated \ncommunities.  Prior to the development of the Coin Street site, the local economy \nwas in sharp decline following the demise of the London Docks upon which many \nlocal businesses \u2013 primarily warehouses and processing plants \u2013 had depended.  \nThe local population was also falling, partly because of a lack of local \nemployment and partly because social housing in the area was amongst the \nworst in London.  By addressing these severe limitations of the local area, not \nleast by connecting it to the wider political economy of London, conditions have \nbeen put in place that have allowed the creation of a successful social enterprise \nand the regeneration of the area.  .  \n \nIn cases such as these, while working with the grain of the private sector \nmainstream and seeking to use it for their own purposes,  social enterprises \nincreasingly and unavoidably enter into competition with mainstream capitalist \nenterprises and have no choice but to seek to compete with them on the terrain \nof mainstream markets. As a result, tensions inevitably arise as they seek to \nbalance these new competitive demands, with all that they imply for work within \nthe SEO and its modes of internal organisation and management as it becomes \na social enterprise, with the original intention to do social good in the parts that \nmainstream markets and the state didn\u201ft reach. It is at this point, and in part a \nreflection of the emphasis given to \u201eprofessionalisation\u201f in public policy towards \nthe social economy,   that many SEOs bring in new \u201eprofessional\u201f managers who \nbring fresh perspectives to the issue of running the SEO explicitly as a social \nenterprise. These people are often refugees from the world of mainstream \nbusiness or people who have had a successful career in business or in the public \nsector, retired early, and have time of their hands that they seek to use by \nengaging with the social economy (see Amin, 2008). However, \n\u201eprofessionalisation\u201f also has implications for the balance of emphasis on the \n\u201esocial\u201f versus the \u201eeconomic\u201f. While the goal of creating a bigger surplus for \nusing in the pursuit of social purposes is fine and laudable, the organisational \nchanges required to achieve this  - for example in terms of modes of work \norganisation - often run counter to the original social objectives of the SEO. \n \nMany aspirant SEs fail because of a lack of a clear sense of mission, an inability \nto reconcile their ethical and social objectives with market realities, and for that \nreason fail to align processes with aims. Typically, initiatives mixing business-\ndriven aspirations and ethically informed goals that seek to address unmet social \nneeds but lacking a clear-cut and conscious understanding of the differences \nbetween them, have had to sacrifice one or the other or have come unstuck and \nfallen between two stools because of contradictory organisational arrangements \nand competitive goals.  For example, ethical ventures have been forced to lower \nwages or the quality of training because the product is commercially non-viable, \n 15 \nor business-driven ventures have been forced by funding agencies to change \ndirection because of poor social achievements.  In contrast, the experience of \ninitiatives with clear aims has been different.  Those with clearly articulated social \nand ethical goals have consciously organised work, clients and products as a \nmeans of meeting needs or developing capabilities, which, in turn, has focused \neffort.  Similarly, business-driven social enterprise ventures run by professionals, \nas for example has become the trend in Glasgow, are clear that equity must \nfollow business success, perhaps \u2013 and not without controversy - even at the \nexpense of social objectives.   \n \nThus successful SEs are based upon a clear identification of real unmet social \nneeds, with potential for expansion beyond the immediate neighbourhood and\/or \ninto related goods and services.  However, in some instances, the local state has \nplayed an important role in underwriting demand as a contractor of the services \nprovided.  This highlights the point that for survival, beyond the important \nquestion of choosing the right product, there is a pressing need to secure a \nsource of recurring demand and sustainable income streams. This presents a \nconsiderable challenge for nascent small social enterprises with fragile market \nexpertise and thinly spread competencies.    \n \n \n \nReading the social economy: perspectives on the relationship between the \n\u2018social\u2019 and the \u2018economic\u2019 and on possibilities for the future \n \nAs the above section makes clear, there is a number of differing, even \ncompeting, perspectives as to the relationship between the social and the \neconomic in SEOs in the UK, and as to the relative weight to be attached to \nthese in practice. In this section I want to connect these different views as to the \npractical relationships between the \u201esocial\u201f and \u201eeconomic\u201f with broader \nperspectives about the social economy and its place within contemporary \ncapitalisms as seen from a variety of national, policy and theoretical \nperspectives, each with differing analytic and normative emphases. There are at \nleast three such \u201etakes\u201f on and interpretations of the social economy that I want \nto consider here, which can be mapped into the differential national and sub-\nnational development of the social economy. \n \nThe first of these prioritises the ethical, moral and \u201esocial\u201f role of the SEOs, \nseeing them as a vital site of provision of goods and services, typically with a \nstrong local focus, that otherwise would not be provided through the mainstream \nmechanisms of capitalist markets and states. As is clear from a weight of \nempirical evidence from the UK, virtually without exception SEOs are formed \nprecisely with this intention and it remains their key priority, subordinating other \nissues to this. As a consequence, they choose to remain heavily dependent upon \nvolunteer labour and the work of a few dedicated individuals who are prepared to \naccept much lower wages than they could earn in mainstream organisations. For \n 16 \nsome this is  precisely because of their ethical and moral commitment to helping \nothers less fortunate than themselves but for others it marks a recognition of \nlimited opportunities \u2013 or indeed no opportunities \u2013 of finding employment in the \nmainstream economy. For them work in the social economy is typically mundane \nand \u201cextraordinarily ordinary\u201d (see Amin, 2008) and many are content to remain \nwithin the safe haven that it offers in an otherwise turbulent world.. Furthemore, \nfor those who founded these SEOs and continue to direct and manage them, any \nconcern with issues such as expansion via expanding markets remains off the \nagenda as this is seen as undermining their \u201esocial\u201f imperatives; if this means an \nuncertain future of reliance upon voluntary labour and precarious funding via \ncontracts and\/or grants from the state or grants from charitable trusts, so be it.  \n \nSuch a view of the SEOs and the social economy as driven by a concern to help \nmeet the needs of those marginalised by or excluded from mainstream economy \nand society chimes neatly with a policy perspective that sees the social economy \nas a safety net and as a lower cost substitute for the provision of goods and \nespecially services previously provided to citizens as of right via the state. This is \nclearly the perspective that has become dominant in UK policy discourse. From \nsuch a neo-liberal policy perspective the role of the social economy is to meet the \nneeds or - still better - unlock the entrepreneurial capacities of those who are \nmarginalised or indeed even damaged by the operations of markets and states, \nhelping them to become future workers \u2013 or still better entrepreneurs -  and \ncitizens of the capitalist economy in whatever form it takes.  The social economy \nis thus seen as an intermediate space through which those who have become \neconomically and socially excluded as a result of the restructuring processes of \ncapital and state can be reintegrated back into mainstream economy and society.  \nFrom this perspective, the social economy is seen as an adjunct to the \nmainstream capitalist economy and a safety net for those that are marginalised \nby or surplus to its requirements (part of what Marxian political economists would \nrefer to the surplus population). Often this is expressed in terms of the social \neconomy, understood as a local economy, becoming a panacea for problems of \nlocally-concentrated social exclusion. There is a very clear emphasis here that \nunequivocally accepts the dominance and primacy of the capitalist mainstream \nand its economic (il)logic and sees the social economy as a space in which those \nworst affected by its restructuring processes can be re-integrated into the \nmainstream \u2013 or if not that, then at least a space (or maybe more accurately a \nspacious cul-de-sac) in which they can be contained and challenges to the \nmainstream and its constituent social order can thereby be diffused..   \n \nThere are, however, many who are actively involved in the social economy in he \nUK and elsewhere who would vigorously contest and reject this first perspective. \nA second perspective therefore sees the social economy much more as an \nalternative to, rather than as an adjunct to, the mainstream capitalist economy, \nthe motives that drive it and the values that underpin it. In contrast it sees the \nsocial economy as one that places addressing social need and enabling social \nparticipation before the imperatives of capital accumulation, corporate profits, \n 17 \nshare-holder value and individual gain rather than simply the space in which the \nindividual and social costs of mainstream capitalism are absorbed and contained. \nFor those who adhere to this view, the social economy represents an alternative \nto the values and economic logic of mainstream capitalism but one that also \naccepts the mainstream and, on occasion, seeks to compete with capitalist \nenterprises within the markets of the mainstream. Those SEOs that seek to make \nthe transition to social enterprises and increase the scope and scale of their \noperations via competing with mainstream capitalist enterprises do so precisely \nbecause they see this as a way of generating greater resources and a social \nsurplus that can then be used for collective and social purposes   \n \nThe social economy is thus conceived as a parallel sphere of to the modalities of \nstates and the mainstream economy, informed by different values and processes \nof valuation and organized differently, existing in parallel to and at times in \ncompetition with mainstream capitalist enterprises and states, but capable of \nboth surviving and demonstrating the viability of a socially needs-based, humane \nand human-centred economy within contemporary capitalism (for example see \nPearce, 2008). Such a view of the social economy is common in France (Laville, \n2008) and Italy (Borzaga, 2008), in the \u201csolidarity economy\u201d of Quebec, where it \nis entangled in complex ways with issues of Quebec nationalism and identity, \nand in parts of South America.  Crucially, however, in the last analysis it accepts \nthe primacy of the mainstream and its conceptions of the economic, the social \nand the relations between them, but seeks to create a space for those whose \nethical and moral values do not fit comfortably within the parameters defined by \nthe mainstream. However, the interplay of the mainstream and the alternative to \nit raises issues of the regulation and structures of markets in complex and hybrid \neconomies. How can markets be structured in such a way as to create a viable \nspace for activities otherwise not attractive to capital? How can the environment \nin which social enterprises operate best be governed? What is the optimal \nbalance between state and the institutions of civil society in governance \narrangements? These are questions that in the final analysis can only be worked \nout in practice. \n \nThe third perspective to a degree overlaps with this second one but it is also \ndistinct from it in one very important respect \u2013 that is, that it emphasises the \ndisruptive qualities and radically transformational potential of the social economy \nto prise open the possibilities of a post-capitalist future. In intent if not pace of \ndevelopment, it is revolutionary. Rather than accept a de facto subordinate \nexistence in a parallel social and economic world to the mainstream, it seeks \npotentially at least to challenge the dominance and hegemony of the mainstream \nand suggest alternative arrangements and definitions of the economic and social \nthat could replace those of the mainstream.  In principle it seeks to supplant the \nlogic of capital rather than co-exist in parallel to it. From this perspective, and \nbuilding upwards and outwards from radical locally-based initiatives (while \nbearing in mind Raymond Williams (1989) strictures and warnings as to the \ndangers of generalising \u201emilitant particularisms\u201f and translating them to places \n 18 \nbeyond their origins), the social economy offers, perhaps, the first green shoots \nof something beyond capitalist (dis)order, and not only in those places \nmarginalised and ravaged by the devalorisation of capital or the restructuring of \nstates  but also in its very heartlands. For sure this is still grounded in a vision of \nconstructing, regulating and shaping markets and bureaucracies but in ways that \nare sensitive to sustaining social needs, the needs of diverse individuals, \ncommunities and ecologies, and driven by values and ethical and moral concerns  \nradically different from those of an economy driven by the imperatives of capital \naccumulation .  From this perspective the social economy is seen as symbolising \nalternative definitions and meanings of economy and economic purpose, of \nrecognising that the economy is always social and in that sense the debate about \nthe relations between \u201eeconomic\u201f and \u201esocial\u201f in the social economy needs to be \nradically re-cast  as part of a more systemic process of socio-economic \ntransformation (for example, see Amin et al, 2002; Gibson-Graham, 1996). \n \n \nConclusions: what about the future? \n \nThere is no doubt that in many parts of the world many SEOs perform a crucial \nfunction in providing goods, services and training opportunities for people in \nplaces that would otherwise be bereft of provision. They seek directly to improve \nthe well-being of people, places and communities, to do so by working with the \ngrain of the desires and wishes of local people, and move to a different \ncollaborative and co-operative rhythm and tune to that of the mainstream \neconomy. In that sense the \u201esocial\u201f continues to take precedence over the \n\u201eeconomic\u201f and there are sound ethical and moral reasons for supporting the \nsocial economy for this reason. Once seen as a residual and poor relation of the \nstate and\/or the market, a sphere of charity and social or moral repair, SEOs are \nnow imagined as a mainstay of future social organisation in both the developed \nand developing world, seen as set to co-exist with or substitute for the welfare \nstate, meet social needs in depleted and hard pressed communities, constitute a \nnew economic circuit of jobs and enterprises in the socialised market composed \nof socially useful goods and services, empower the socially excluded by \ncombining training and skills formation with capacity and confidence-building, \nand create a space for humane, co-operative, sustainable, and \u201ealternative\u201f forms \nof social and economic organisation. This is a pretty impressive agenda of \ndiverse intended outcomes, although the extent to which they can be and are \nactually delivered in practice remains to be seen. What is clear is that the \nexpectation \u2013 common in much policy thinking in the UK for example - that the \nsocial economy can be a major source of jobs, entrepreneurship, local \nregeneration, and welfare provision in places marginalized by processes of \ncapital accumulation and state restructuring is na\u00efve and dangerous, with the \nmanifest danger of generating disappointment as a result of unrealised \nexpectations. More positively, SEOs - in some places, at varying spatial scales, \nand with the relevant support - can complement provision via state and \nmainstream market, perhaps even constitute a genuine \u201cThird System\u201d of \n 19 \nprovision,  and add to the range of goods and services and opportunities \navailable to people in them.  As such, in specific and typically but not necessarily \nsimply local circumstances, they can achieve something genuinely different. \n \n What can be said with much greater certainty is that it is difficult to envisage \nSEOs in aggregate having a radically transformative role such that a \u201csocial \neconomy\u201d with its own distinctive values and concerns develops and displaces \nthe (il)logic of capital accumulation from its position of systemic dominance within \ndiverse capitalisms; rather they provide at best an alternative to the mainstream, \nat worst a safety net that serves to legitimise the inequalities inherent to the \noperation of mainstream capitalist markets and the process of capital \naccumulation. But whatever else SEOs and the social economy do or do not do, \nthey do keep on the agenda the needs of those who the mainstream ignores and \nthe possibilities of alterity and maybe radical alterity at that in terms of other ways \nof organising economy and society, and indeed of re-conceptualising what we \nmean to the economic, the social and the relations between them. Keeping open \nthis window of potential practical and political as well as theoretical opportunity is \nvitally important \u2013 even if the short-term prognosis is less than rosy. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis is a revised version of a paper prepared for the ESRC-sponsored Seminar \non \u201eChanging Cultures of Competitiveness: Global Production and Labour \nRelations\u201f, Manchester, 9 July 2008.
