First published in 1998, re-issued in\npaperback. Scope: scientific biography. Level: undergraduate, postgraduate, and general\nreader.\nLudwig Boltzmann was one of the towering figures who marked the transition from nine-\nteenth to twentieth century science. It is not generally realised that in his era the very\nexistence of atoms still remained controversial. Boltzmann was convinced of their reality\nat an early stage, but was surrounded by distinguished sceptics such as Mach and Ostwald\nwho seemingly regarded atomism as no more than an amusing fairy-story. So he had to\nfight hard for his ideas. Of course, he was right. Not only was he (at least as much as\nGibbs) the father of statistical mechanics, but his ideas exerted strong influence on his\ncontemporaries and successors, including Hilbert, Planck and Einstein. Boltzmann\u2019s life\nwas tortured by the mood-swings associated with manic depression, and a restlessness of\nspirit. Even when already famous, he needlessly changed universities on several occasions,\noften to a less congenial environment than the one he was leaving. Carlo Cercignani\u2019s\nlovingly crafted book describes all this and works well, on many levels. It is both a per-\nsonal and a scientific biography. Much interesting technical material (including almost\nall the equations) is consigned to appendices, so the main text can be read by anybody.\nReaders will gain a sympathetic understanding of this sensitive, cultured, and anguished\nman as well of his enormous contributions to science. Although the author is properly\nreticent about the reasons for Boltzmann\u2019s suicide while on holiday in Duino near Trieste\nin 1906 \u2013 he left no suicide note and nobody knows the specific reason for the act \u2013 it\nbecomes clear that his tragic end was in a sense almost inevitable. The author quotes\nHo\u00a8flechner\u2019s words, that Boltzmann \u201c...switched universities for the last time and entered\nthe one great university of the immortal intellectual giants of science\u201d.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 47, 234 (2006).\n"}
