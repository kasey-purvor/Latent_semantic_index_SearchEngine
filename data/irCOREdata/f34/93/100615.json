Here we are concerned with\nthe SGT transistor in hydrogenated amorphous silicon\nsa-Si:Hd, the most commonly used semiconductor for large\narea electronics. It has been shown that saturation voltage\ncan be as much as a factor of 10 lower in an amorphous\nsilicon SGT compared with a FET2 which has important im-\nplications for device circuits such as those used to address\ndisplays based on organic light emitting diodes. The low\nsaturation voltage enables transistors to be operated at lower\ndrain voltages and with a correspondingly lower power dis-\nsipation. Furthermore, the SGT in a-Si:H is more stable to\nvoltage-temperature stressing than an equivalent FET.3 Here\nwe are concerned with modeling of the SGT to establish\nwhether the low saturation voltage and high output imped-\nance are preserved at the currents needed to drive light emit-\nting diode arrays. These currents are typically in the micro-\namp region.\nA schematic cross section on a SGT is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe principle of the operation of the SGT differs from that of\nthe FET where the gate voltage modulates channel conduc-\ntance and saturation occurs when the drain region is de-\npleted. In the SGT the current is determined by a reverse\nbiased barrier and the effect of the electric field. As the drain\nvoltage increases the depletion region spreads until it reaches\nthe semiconductor-insulator sS-Id interface. At this drain bias\npoint sVSATd the current saturates because further increase in\ndrain voltage only extends the depletion layer towards the\ndrain contact and there is little effect on the electric field at\nthe barrier. The values of VSAT can be small if the semicon-\nductor is thin and lightly doped. In the saturated condition\nthe electric field and the current passing through the source\nare controlled by the gate. Therefore the on current is con-\ntrolled by the effect of the gate voltage on the reverse biased\nsource barrier of length s. The off current, however, is deter-\nmined by the parasitic FET of length d in series with the\ngated source sFig. 1d. A chromium Schottky barrier modified\nusing ion implantation sphosphorous 10 keV, 131014 cm\u22122d\nwas used for the source barrier and a compensating implant\nBF2 s13 keV, 531013 cm\u22122d was used to passivate and pro-\nvide field relief at the edge of the source barrier.2 In this\ndevice the electric field at the source barrier determines the\nmagnitude of the electron current passing through the barrier\ndue to thermionic-field emission.\nThe experimental transistor characteristics of a SGT are\nshown in Fig. 2. The thickness of a-S :H and silicon nitride\nwas 100 and 300 nm, respectively. It can be seen that the\nSGT has a low saturation voltage sVSATd and high output\nimpedance. Assuming uniform emission over the area of the\nsource barrier, the current density and the effective barrier\nheight, FB of the source was determined from the measured\ntransistor characteristics. According to the model for the\nSGT based on thermionic-field emission,2 the transconduc-\ntance gm should be proportional to the source current Is\ngm = ISaqCSCG\/\u00abS\u00ab0kTsCS + CGd , s1d\nwhere Is is the current through the reverse biased barrier, Cs\nand CG are capacitances per unit area of the semiconductor\nand the insulator, respectively, and a is a tunneling constant.\nBased on Eq. s1d the tunneling constant a was found to\nbe ,3 nm which is in good agreement with values obtained\nusing various amorphous silicon Shottky diodes.4 Further-\nmore, since\nIS = SA*T2 exps\u2212 q\/kTdfFB \u2212 asVSAT\/ta-Sidg s2d\nand\nVSAT = CGsVG \u2212 VTd\/sCG + CSd + K s3d\nthe effective barrier height FB can be easily estimated. S and\nta-Si are the area of the source and thickness of the semicon-\nductor sFig. 1d. VT is the threshold voltage of the parasitic\nFET and K is a constant, which takes into account the drain\nvoltage required to deplete the semiconductor from charge at\nthe S-I interface.\nadAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nf.balon@surrey.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

All simulations were done with the developer\nversion of the ATLAS Silvaco sv.5.7.28.Cd. The magnitude\nand shape of the characteristics for simulated and experimen-\ntal transistor characteristics per unit width are found to be in\nvery good agreement sFig. 2d particularly in view of the sen-\nsitivity of the current to the barrier height.\nWhile agreement between the magnitude of the current\nobtained from modeling was in good agreement with mea-\nsured values for high source barriers and low currents, this\nwas not the case when the source barrier was low and cur-\nrents much higher. It was found that modeling always pro-\nduced higher currents. This discrepancy is probably due to a\nchange in the field dependence of the current for high fields\nand low barriers and the fact that emission is no longer uni-\nform over the source area but confined to the edge of the\nsource. For high current devices, simulations showed a lat-\neral voltage drop along the S-I interface responsible for cur-\nrent crowding near the source edge opposite the drain con-\ntact. However, the shape of the transistor characteristics at\nhigher currents remained in good agreement with that mod-\neled particularly around saturation ssee Fig. 3d.\nThe transistor characteristics for a high current device\ns2.5310\u22127 A\/mmd are shown in Fig. 3. We see that the low\nsaturation voltage is preserved albeit less well defined in\ncomparison with low current device ssee Fig. 2d. Further-\nmore, the output impedance remains high with very little\ndeterioration even for submicron source-drain separations.\nThis feature illustrates the good screening of the source from\nthe drain field provided by this geometry.\nThe good modeling results around saturation enabled us\nto predict the effect of the source-drain separation and the\nparasitic FET in series with the source schannel length d in\nFig. 1d. Clearly for a given source current the characteristics\nwill become increasingly influenced by the parasitic FET as\nd increases and the current becomes limited by the FET. This\nfeature is shown experimentally in Fig. 4sad for a high barrier\ndevice sta-Si=100 nmd. For low source-drain separations the\nchange of VSAT with VG is in good agreement with the di-\nelectric model for the SGT2 fdVSAT\/dVG=CG \/ sCG+CSdg\nwhile for large separations it tends to the FET limit for long\nchannel devices sdVSAT\/dVG=1d.5 Computer calculations\nfFig. 4sbdg show the same behavior sta-Si=60 nmd. Overall\nthese results show that VSAT is not strongly dependent on d\nand wide variations can be tolerated without large changes in\nVSAT. For example, for a source-drain separation as large as\n10 mm dVSAT\/dVG is still four times lower than a FET.\nIn conclusion, it has been shown that the shape of the\noutput characteristics of a SGT having a Shottky barrier\nsource can be predicted using the SILVACO Atlas program. It\nis found that a low VSAT is maintained when the source bar-\nriers are low and the current is high. The saturation voltage is\nless well defined but the low values should enable circuits to\nbe operated at lower drain voltages and power dissipation.\nThe saturation voltage increases with source drain separation\nbecause the current becomes restricted by the parasitic FET\nin the extrinsic drain region. However, this effect is less pro-\nnounced than expected. It has also been shown that SGT\ncharacteristics can be preserved down to submicron source-\ndrain separation.\nFIG. 2.
