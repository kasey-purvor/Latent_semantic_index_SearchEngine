Previous studies have\nidentified a YY1 (Yin Yang 1)-binding site as an impor-\ntant sequence in LINE-1 transcription. Here, we\ndemonstrate that mutations in the YY1-binding site\nhave only minor effects on transcription activation\nof the full-length50-UTRand LINE-1mobility in asingle\nround cultured cell retrotransposition assay. Instead,\nthese mutations disrupt proper initiation of transcrip-\ntion from the +1 site of the 50-UTR. Thus, we propose\nthat the YY1-binding site functions as a component of\nthe LINE-1 core promoter to direct accurate transcrip-\ntion initiation. Indeed, this sequence may explain the\nevolutionary success of LINE-1 by enabling full-\nlength retrotransposed copies to undergo autono-\nmous retrotransposition in subsequent generations.\nINTRODUCTION\nLong Interspersed Element-1s (LINE-1s or L1s) are abundant\nnon-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons in mam-\nmalian genomes that mobilize via a RNA intermediate by a\nprocess termed retrotransposition (1,2). Although LINE-1s\ncomprise \u000217% of human genomic DNA, most elements\nare 50 truncated, internally rearranged, or mutated and can\nno longer retrotranspose (3,4). However, the average human\ngenome is estimated to contain \u000280\u2013100 retrotransposition-\ncompetent LINE-1 (RC-L1s) elements (5,6), and some retro-\ntransposition events have resulted in disease (7,8).\nRC-L1s are \u00026.0 kb and contain a 50-untranslated region\n(50-UTR), two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORF1\nand ORF2) and a 30-UTR that ends in a poly(A) tail (9,10).\nORF1 encodes a 40 kDa RNA-binding protein (p40 or ORF1p)\n(11,12), whereas ORF2 has the potential to encode a 150 kDa\nprotein with demonstrated endonuclease and reverse transcrip-\ntase activities (13,14). Both proteins are required for retro-\ntransposition in cis (15), which probably occurs by target\nsite-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) (13,16,17). LINE-\n1 elements also usually are flanked by variable sized target\nsite duplications (TSDs), which are generated during retro-\ntransposition (Figure 1). However, recent studies indicate\nthat LINE-1 retrotransposition sometimes leads to other target\nsite rearrangements (18\u201321).\nThe initial step in human LINE-1 retrotransposition requires\ntranscription from an internal promoter located within its 910-\nbp LINE-1 50-UTR, which lacks a TATA box (i.e. a TATA-\nless promoter). Swergold (22) demonstrated that the majority of\npromoter activity resides within the first 600-bp of the 50-UTR\nand that transcription initiates at or near the first nucleotide of\nthe element at an unconventional start site (50-GGGGG-30).\nSubsequent studies revealed that the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) pro-\ntein could bind the 50-UTR between position (+21 to +13) on\nthe antisense strand, and that mutations in this sequence\nreduced the ability of a \u2018minimal\u2019 LINE-1 promoter (i.e. a\npromoter containing the first 155 bp of the LINE-1 50-UTR) to\ndirect transcription of a heterologous reporter gene (23\u201325).\nBesides the YY1-binding site, two putative SRY-related\ntranscription factor binding sites, a putative RUNX3 transcrip-\ntion factor binding site, as well as an antisense promoter have\nbeen identified within the 50-UTR (26\u201329). Thus, the 50-UTR\nmost probably contains multiple cis-acting sequences that\nfunction in LINE-1 transcriptional regulation. However,\nhow LINE-1 maintains the integrity of its 50 end has long\nbeen a mystery.\nWe demonstrated previously that the 50-UTR is sufficient to\ndrive LINE-1 transcription and retrotransposition in HeLa\ncells. In addition, we showed that a heterologous promoter\n[e.g. the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter]\ncould replace the 50-UTR without drastically affecting\nretrotransposition (15). By comparison, deletion of both the\n50-UTR and CMV promoter results in a three order of magni-\ntude reduction in retrotransposition efficiency (15).\nHere, we have used a single round cultured cell retrotrans-\nposition assay in conjunction with a heterologous luciferase-\nbased reporter system to examine the function of the\nYY1-binding site in LINE-1 retrotransposition and transcrip-\ntion. Unexpectedly, we have found that mutations in the YY1-\nbinding site have only minor effects on LINE-1 retrotranspo-\nsition and the transcriptional activation potential of the full-\nlength 50-UTR. Instead, these mutations disrupt the proper\ninitiation of transcription from the +1 site of the 50-UTR.\nThus, we propose that the YY1-binding site is a component\nof the LINE-1 core promoter that functions to direct accurate\ntranscription initiation.\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Plasmids were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems\nDNA sequencer (ABI 3730) at the University of Michigan\nCore facilities.\nPlasmid construction\npCEP4-based retrotransposition constructs. Wild-type\n(e.g. JM101\/L1.3) and mutant (e.g. DDJM101\/L1.3) pCEP4-\nbased LINE-1 constructs containing the mneoI retrotransposi-\ntion cassettes have been described previously (5,15,30).\nWild-type and mutant pCEP4-based LINE-1 constructs in\nthis study were created using standard PCR mutagenesis tech-\nniques. Briefly, wild-type and mutant LINE-1 50-UTR frag-\nments were PCR amplified using Pfu Turbo polymerase\n(Stratagene) with a 50-primer harboring a NotI site (e.g.\nJA1; Supplementary Table 1) and a reverse primer comple-\nmentary to sequences near the 30 end of the 50-UTR, which\ncontains an engineered EagI site (e.g. JA8; Supplementary\nTable 1). The primer pairs used to amplify each L1 50-UTR\nfragment are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The resultant\nPCR fragments were digested with EagI and were subcloned\ninto pDDJM101\/L1.3 (30). Restriction mapping and DNA\nsequencing confirmed the orientation of the insert. Notably,\na wild-type LINE-1 50-UTR fragment containing an EagI site\n(1\u2013910 EagI) was constructed and serves as an equivalent\npositive control.\nLuciferase reporter constructs. Wild-type LINE-1 50-UTR or\nmutant LINE-1 50-UTR derivatives were PCR amplified from\ntheir respective pCEP4-based constructs with platinum Taq\n(BRL) using primers JA43 and JA44b (Supplementary Table 2).\nThe ATG of ORF-1 in the reverse primer was destroyed so the\nfirst ATG is that of the luciferase gene. The resultant PCR\nfragments were digested using XhoI and HindIII, and were\nthen subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Restric-\ntion mapping and DNA sequencing confirmed the orientation\nof the insert.\nCell culture and transfections\nN-Tera 2D1 teratocarcinoma cells and PA-1 ovarian carci-\nnoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells and N-Tera 2D1 cells\nwere grown in 7% CO2 at 37\n\u0003C in DMEM (Invitrogen) sup-\nplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and 1\u00b7 penicillin\u2013\nstreptomycin\u2013L-glutamine (Invitrogen). PA-1 cells were\ngrown in 7% CO2 at 37\n\u0003C in MEM supplemented with 10%\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1\u00b7 non-essential\namino acids (Invitrogen).

An overview of the LINE-1 retrotransposition assay. (A) Rationale of\nthe assay: depicted is a schematic diagram of a full-length retrotransposition-\ncompetent L1. ORF1 is indicated by the yellow rectangle. ORF2 is indicated by\nthe blue rectangle. The 50-UTR and 30-UTR are indicated by the gray rectangles.\nA SV40 poly(A) signal present at the 30 end of the LINE-1 is indicated by\nthe (A)n. The relative position of the YY1-binding site on the antisense strand of\nthe 50-UTR is indicated, as are the sequences of the YY1-scramble (YY1-s) and\nYY1-forward (YY1-f) mutants. The mneoI retrotransposition indicator cassette\nwas inserted into the 30-UTR of wild-type and mutant L1 constructs (15,35).\nThe cassette consists of a backward copy of the neomycin phosphotransferase\ngene (pink rectangle) and is interrupted by an intron (IVS-2 from the g-globin\ngene), which is in the same transcriptional orientation as the L1. SD and SA\nindicate the splice donor and splice acceptor sites. The cassette also is equipped\nwith its own promoter (P0) and polyadenylation signal (A0). This arrangement\nensures that a functional NEO transcript will only be translated following LINE-\n1 retrotransposition (15). The putative structure of a resultant retrotransposition\nevent that confers G418-resistance (G418R) to HeLa cells is indicated at the\nbottom of the figure. The horizontal arrows indicate TSDs that are generated\nupon LINE-1 retrotransposition. (B) The results of the retrotransposition assay:\nretrotransposition was assayed in HeLa cells using the transient\nretrotransposition assay (31). Approximately 2 \u00b7 105 HeLa cells\/well were\ntransfected with JM101\/L1.3 (WT), 1\u2013910 EagI, YY1-s or YY1-f. No\npromoter indicates cells transfected with a LINE-1 construct that lacks a\npromoter (DDJM101\/L1.3) (30).\nNucleic Acids Research, 2004, Vol. 32, No. 13 3847\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n(pCMV-bGal), which was used to normalize transfection effi-\nciency (see below).\nRetrotransposition, luciferase and b-galactosidase\nassays\nRetrotransposition was monitored using a transient retrotran-\nsposition assay (31), except that a b-galactosidase reporter\nplasmid was used to normalize transfection efficiencies.\nBriefly, 48 h post-transfection, duplicate plates were rinsed\nin 1\u00b7 PBS, lysed in 400 ml of 1\u00b7 cell culture lysis buffer\n(Promega) and incubated for \u000220 min. Whole cell lysates\nfrom each well were collected in a microcentrifuge tube\nand 50 ml of extract was used to measure b-galactosidase\nactivity in a standard colorimetric assay. Cell extracts\nwere added to 1 ml of Z buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate,\npH 7.5, 0.001 M MgSO4) and 200 ml of 2-nitrophenyl-b-D-\ngalactopyranoside (4 mg\/ml in 0.1 M sodium phosphate). The\nreaction was allowed to proceed at 37\u0003C for \u00021\u20132 h and the\nabsorbance was measured at 420 nm. Retrotransposition effi-\nciencies are reported as normalized values (i.e. #G418 resis-\ntant foci\/b-galactosidase activity units).\nLuciferase experiments were performed using a Luciferase\nAssay System (Promega). Briefly, cells were lysed in 400 ml of\n1\u00b7 cell lysis buffer (from 5\u00b7 Cell Culture Lysis Reagent; Pro-\nmega) for 20 min with gentle agitation. The resultant cell\nlysates were transferred to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and\nwere then centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. for 5 min. Luciferase\nactivities were measured using a luminometer (Monolight\n3010; Pharmagen) using 20 ml of cell extracts and 100 ml of\nLuciferin reagent (Promega). b-Galactosidase assays were per-\nformed as noted above using 5 ml of the same cell lysate. Luci-\nferase activities in relative light units (RLUs) are reported as\nnormalized values (i.e. RLUs\/b-galactosidase activity units).\nRNase protection assays\nTissue culture cells were plated in T-175 mm2 flasks at a\ndensity of 6 \u00b7 106 cells\/flask and were transfected with 30 mg\nof wild-type or mutant luciferase-based reporter constructs\nusing 90 ml of the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Mole-\ncular Biochemicals) (31). Cells were harvested 72 h post-\ntransfection and total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol\nreagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were treated with 100 U\nof RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h\nat 37\u0003C, extracted with acid-equilibrated phenol\u2013chloroform,\nand precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. PCR pro-\nducts containing a T7 promoter were generated from either\nthe wild-type or the mutant luciferase-based reporter con-\nstructs using primers JA41 and pLuc-for (Supplementary\nTable 2). We used a Hybaid Thermocycler programmed as\nfollows: 1 cycle of 95\u0003C for 10 min, 55\u0003C for 7 min, 72\u0003C\nfor 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u0003C for 30 s, 55\u0003C for\n30 s, 72\u0003C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of\n72\u0003C for 10 min. The resultant PCR products were then used\nas templates for in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase in\nthe presence of [a-32P]UTP (Amersham) using the Maxi-\nscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). RNase protection\nassays were performed using the RPA III kit (Ambion).\nBriefly, 30 mg of total RNA was hybridized to gel-purified\nprobe (1 \u00b7 105 c.p.m.\/reaction) at 42\u0003C overnight. The reac-\ntions were then digested in a mixture of RNase A (0.375 U)\nand RNase T1 (15 U) at 37\u0003C for 1 h, precipitated and\nresolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\n50-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (50-RACE)\nPoly(A) RNA was isolated from \u0002300 mg of the total HeLa\ncell RNA samples described above using a MicroPoly(A)\nPure Kit (Ambion). 50-RACE was carried out using the\nFirstChoice RLM-RACE kit in accordance with the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s instructions (Ambion). Briefly, 250 ng of poly(A)\nRNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove\nthe 50-PO4 from degraded mRNAs, rRNA, tRNA and DNA.\nTobbaco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) treatment was then\nused to remove the 7-methyl-G cap from full-length\nmRNAs. The resultant poly(A) RNA was ligated with the\n50-RACE adapter using the procedures specified by the man-\nufacturer. Reverse transcription using the SuperScriptII RT\n(Invitrogen) was conducted with random decamers; 1 ml of\nthe RT reaction was then used in the first PCR with the\nouter 50-RACE and pLuc-reverse primer pairs (Supplemen-\ntary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2). An aliquot of 2 ml\nof the PCR was then used as the template in a nested PCR\nusing the inner 50-RACE and either the 300AS (JA10) or the\n600AS (JA9) primer pairs (Supplementary Figure 1 and Sup-\nplementary Table 2). We used a Hybaid Thermocycler pro-\ngrammed as follows: 1 cycle of 95\u0003C for 10 min, 55\u0003C for\n7 min, 72\u0003C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u0003C for\n30 s, 55\u0003C for 30 s, 72\u0003C for 1 min, followed by a final\nextension step of 72\u0003C for 10 min. The PCR products were\ngel purified and cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega) and\nthe resultant clones were sequenced on an Applied Biosys-\ntems DNA sequencer at the University of Michigan Core\nfacilities.\nAnalysis of LINE-1 50-termini\nAn annotated database of full-length, human-specific L1s\nshowing high >98% identity to a RC-L1 sequence (L1.3,\naccession no. L19088) was screened for elements flanked\nby unambiguous TSDs (32). These elements were then\nscreened for those containing an intact YY1 non-degenerate\ncore (NDC) sequence (50-CAAGATGGCCG-30). A total of\n229 LINE-1 sequences including 500 bp of the 50-flanking\ngenomic DNA were aligned using Clustal W (33) and the\nalignment was refined manually to annotate the position of\nthe 50-TSD. The distance from the 30 end of the 50-TSD to the\n30 most base of the YY1 NDC sequence (50-CAAGATGGCC-\nG-30) for each sequence was then calculated to give an objec-\ntive measure of the L1 50-terminus length. Analysis of this\ndistribution revealed a strong bimodality. Most sequences\nexhibited a terminal distance between 10 and 48 bases. How-\never, 10 elements were excluded from the analysis because\nthey had terminal distances >100 bp and likely are the result of\ntranscription from upstream cellular promoters [also known as\n50-transduction (3)]. The frequency distribution of 50-terminus\ndistances was plotted in 1 nt bins and the nucleotide conserva-\ntion calculated as the percentage proportion of the most fre-\nquent base at each position of the alignment, weighted by the\nnumber of sequences contributing to that position.

In addition, the NEO gene is inter-\nrupted by an intron (IVS2 of the g-globin gene) in the same\norientation as the LINE-1 transcript. This arrangement ensures\nthat G418-resistant foci will only arise when a transcript\ninitiated from a promoter driving LINE-1 transcription is\nspliced, reverse transcribed and is integrated into chromo-\nsomal DNA, thereby allowing expression of the retrotran-\nsposed NEO gene from promoter P0 (15).\nThe first two constructs [JM101\/L1.3DCMV (WT) and\npJM101\/L1.3DCMV 1\u2013910EagI (1\u2013910 EagI)] contain a\nwild-type L1 50-UTR and differ only by the presence of an\nEagI site at position +904 (see Materials and methods). The\nEagI site was introduced to facilitate subsequent cloning of\nYY1-binding site mutants, and its presence had no significant\neffect on retrotransposition efficiency in the cultured cell assay\n(Figure 1B and Table 1). Mutant derivatives of the 50-UTR\ncontain either a scrambled YY1 sequence (YY1-s; Figure 1A)\nthat can no longer bind the YY1 protein (25), or an intact, but\ninverted YY1 core binding sequence (YY1-f; Figure 1). Both\nmutants contain the engineered EagI site.\nUnexpectedly, we found that the YY1-s mutant retrotrans-\nposed near the level of its corresponding control (1\u2013910 EagI)\nwhen assayed in the context of a full-length 50-UTR (Figure 1B\nand Table 1). By comparison, the YY1-s mutant displayed\n4- to 5-fold less activity than its corresponding control (1\u2013\n150-WT) when assayed in the context of a \u2018minimal\u2019 promo-\nter, containing the first 150 bp of the 50-UTR (Table 1).\nA similar reduction in retrotransposition efficiency was\nobserved when the YY1-f mutant was assayed in the context\nof a minimal promoter (Table 1).\nMutations in the YY1-binding site have only\nminimal effects on the activation potential of the\nfull-length 50-UTR\nIn light of previous data, we next tested whether the YY1-s and\nYY1-f mutations affect the ability of the 50-UTR to activate the\ntranscription of a luciferase reporter construct in HeLa cells,\nN-Tera 2D1 teratocarcinoma cells and PA-1 ovarian carci-\nnoma cells. The latter two cell types are thought to be surro-\ngates for endogenous cell types that naturally express LINE-1\nelements (12,36,37). Consistently, we found that the wild-type\n50-UTR is \u000218-fold more active in N-Tera 2D1 cells when\ncompared to HeLa cells and is \u00025-fold more active in PA-1\ncells when compared to HeLa cells (Table 1).\nThe promoter activity of the YY1-s mutant construct was\nindistinguishable from its corresponding control when assayed\nin HeLa cells and only exhibited \u00022-fold less activity than its\ncorresponding control when assayed in either N-Tera 2D1 or\nPA-1 cells (1\u2013910-YY1-s versus 1\u2013910 EagI; Table 1). By\ncomparison, in the context of a minimal promoter, the YY1-s\nmutant construct displayed 3-fold less activity than its corre-\nsponding control when assayed in HeLa cells, and displayed 4-\nto 10-fold less activity than its corresponding control when\nassayed in either N-Tera 2D1 or PA-1 cells (1\u2013150-YY1-s\nversus 1\u2013150-WT; Table 1). The reduction in promoter activ-\nity also correlated with a reduction in retrotransposition effi-\nciency (Table 1).\nInversion of the YY1-binding site had no effect on the\nactivation potential of the full-length promoter in any cell\ntype examined (1\u2013910-YY1-f versus 1\u2013910 EagI; Table 1).\nHowever, in the context of a minimal promoter (1\u2013150-YY1-f\nversus 1\u2013150-WT; Table 1), the YY1-f mutation displays a\ndramatic reduction in promoter activity in the three cell lines.\nTogether, the above data indicate that the two YY1-binding\nsite mutations have little effect on the activation potential\nof the full-length 50-UTR. However, as putative downstream\nTable 1.

We also detect a less intense band in the Neg. lanes, which probably represents protected RNAs derived\nfrom endogenously transcribed LINE-1 elements.\n3850 Nucleic Acids Research, 2004, Vol. 32, No. 13\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nluciferase reporter construct that was under the control of the\nfull-length 50-UTR and then performed RNase protection ana-\nlysis (RPA) on whole cell RNAs. This analysis revealed a\nmajor product of\u0002290 nt, which is slightly less than the 300 nt\nsize expected if transcription initiated from the first base of the\n50-UTR (Figure 2, left panel). We also found transcripts ori-\nginating further downstream in the LINE-1 promoter. The cis-\nacting sequences responsible for these alternative initiation\nsites are the subject of an ongoing investigation.\nTo investigate the apparent size discrepancy noted above,\nwe mapped the LINE-1 transcription initiation site more pre-\ncisely using a construct that lacked the first five nucleotides of\nthe 50-UTR (D5G). This mutation had no significant effect on\npromoter activity or retrotransposition efficiency in HeLa cells\n(D5G; Table 1). Thus, we repeated the RPA on whole cell\nRNAs derived from HeLa cells transfected with a luciferase\nreporter construct that was under the control of either the full-\nlength 50-UTR or the D5G 50-UTR. When compared to the\nwild-type control, we observed a protected product containing\n\u00025 fewer nucleotides in cells transfected with the D5G con-\nstruct (Figure 3, left panel). Thus, consistent with previous\nfindings, our data indicate that LINE-1 transcription normally\ninitiates near the first nucleotide of the 50-UTR (22). Moreover,\nthe data suggest that the aberrant migration of the RPA product\nmay be due to the secondary structure adopted by the 50-UTR.\nWe next performed RPA on whole cell RNAs derived from\nHeLa, N-Tera 2D1 or PA-1 cells transfected with a luciferase\nreporter construct that was under the control of the full-length\n50-UTR containing the YY1-s mutant. We did not observe a\nmajor protected product corresponding to transcripts that\ninitiated at the +1 position of the 50-UTR. Instead, we observed\nnumerous protected products that varied in size, suggesting\nthat transcription initiated at multiple sites both within and\nupstream of the 50-UTR (Figure 2, right panel). A similar loss\nin initiation fidelity was observed in HeLa cells transfected\nwith the YY1-f mutant (data not shown; however, see Figure 4).\nNotably, although the YY1-s mutation reduces transcription\nby\u00022-fold in both N-Tera 2D1 and PA-1 cells when compared\nto its corresponding control (1\u2013910-YY1-s versus 1\u2013910 EagI;\nTable 1), the absolute expression levels are still sufficient\nto detect any correctly initiated full-length mRNAs that are\npresent.\nTo independently confirm the RPA data, we conducted 50-\nRACE to map the transcription initiation sites. Experiments\ngenerated from HeLa cells transfected with wild-type con-\nstructs (WT and 1\u2013910 EagI) demonstrated that transcription\ngenerally initiated within the first five guanosine residues pre-\nsent in the 50-UTR (Figure 4). Similarly, transcripts derived\nfrom HeLa cells transfected with the D5G construct initiated\ntranscription at either the first base of its 50-UTR (i.e. the\nadenosine at +6) or slightly upstream at the 30 most guanosine\nresidue present in the engineered NotI restriction site, which is\nconsistent with data learned from the RPA (Figures 3, right\npanel and 4). In contrast, cells transfected with either the YY1-\ns or YY1-f mutants have variable transcriptional initiation\nsites located downstream of the YY1-binding site throughout\nthe 50-UTR (Figure 4). Thus, we conclude that both the\nsequence and orientation of the YY1 site is necessary for\nproper transcriptional initiation in the context of a full-length\n50-UTR. Interestingly, we detected only 50-RACE products\nwhen RNA samples were treated with tobacco acid pyrophos-\nphatase (see Materials and Methods), indicating that LINE-1\nRNA contains a cap-like structure at its 50-terminus (Supple-\nmentary Figure 1).\nEndogenous LINE-1 elements have heterogeneous\n50 ends\nThe above data indicate that a functional YY1 site is important\nto direct transcriptional initiation near the terminus of the\n50-UTR. However, the variable initiation sites observed for\nthe wild-type and D5G constructs (Figures 2\u20134) suggest that\nYY1 does not specify the precise nucleotide of transcrip-\ntion initiation. To test this model, we used a database of\n219 human-specific L1s to objectively define the LINE-1\n50-terminus (and hence the likely transcriptional start site)\nwithout reference to the consensus sequence (see Materials\nand methods). Although the majority (i.e. 146\/219 or 67%) of\ngenomic elements begin within the first five guanosine resi-\ndues that are deleted in the D5G construct, there is a broad\ndistribution about this point (Figure 5, blue line and Supple-\nmentary Figure 2), indicating heterogeneity in initiation sites.\nD\nel\nta\n 5\nG\nW\nT\nR\nN\nas\ne +\nR\nN\nas\ne -\nD\nel\nta\n 5\nG\nW\nT\nR\nN\nas\ne +\nR\nN\nas\ne -\nWTProbes: Delta 5G\n300\n400\nN\neg\nN\neg\nM\nFigure 3.

However, despite this observed sequence het-\nerogeneity, \u000296% of the LINE-1 sequences have a purine at\ntheir 50-terminus. Together, these data are consistent with the\nhypothesis that YY1 directs transcription to initiate at hetero-\ngeneous purine residues located near the 50 end of the LINE-1\nelement.\nDISCUSSION\nIn summary, we have shown that mutations in the YY1-\nbinding site have only minor effects on transcription activation\nof the full-length 50-UTR and LINE-1 mobility in a single\nround cultured cell retrotransposition assay. Instead, these\nmutations disrupt proper initiation of transcription from\nnear the +1 site of the 50-UTR. Thus, we propose that the\nYY1-binding site functions as a component of the LINE-1\ncore promoter to direct accurate transcription initiation.\nYY1 is an essential, widely expressed Kruppel-related zinc\nfinger protein that can either activate or repress the transcrip-\ntion of many cellular and viral genes (39\u201341). It can also\nrecruit components of the basal transcription machinery as\nwell as histone modification enzymes to promoters and may\nplay a role in directing transcriptional initiation (39,42\u201347).\nThus, our data suggest that YY1 most probably interacts with\nother trans-acting factors that bind downstream sequences in\nthe L1 50-UTR to recruit RNA polymerase II to the 50 end of\nthe element.\nAnalysis of young LINE-1 sequences in the human gen-\nome draft sequence corroborates our experimental data and\nreveals extensive heterogeneity at the 50 end of endogenous\nLINE-1 sequences (Figure 5). This 50 end heterogeneity\ncould be due to the following: (1) the use of multiple tran-\nscriptional initiation sites; (2) untemplated nucleotide addi-\ntions that occur during (\u0004) strand cDNA synthesis [(18,20)\nN. Gilbert, S. Lutz and J.V. Moran, unpublished data];\n(3) 50-truncation of the LINE-1 element during the process\nof retrotransposition; or (4) 50-transduction (3). Although all\nof these processes most probably contribute to the observed\nLINE-1 50 end heterogeneity, our data clearly demonstrate\nthat there is no strict consensus sequence that is required for\nLINE-1 transcription initiation. Instead, they are consistent\nwith the notion that YY1 directs transcription to initiate at\nheterogeneous purine residues located near the 50 end of the\nLINE-1 element.\nFigure 4. 50-RACE analyses of wild-type and mutant luciferase-based expression constructs. 50-RACE analysis was performed using poly(A) selected RNA from\nHeLa cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant luciferase-based expression constructs.

A model for how the YY1-binding site functions in LINE-1 retrotransposition. The model depicts retrotransposition events arising from a progenitor, full-\nlength LINE-1 element that contains either a wild-type (left panel) or a mutant (right panel) YY1-binding site. In the wild-type scenario, a full-length LINE-1 element\ncontaining an intact 50-UTR predominantly initiates transcription from the +1 site of the 50-UTR allowing the internal promoter to be regenerated upon\nretrotransposition. The progenitor as well as the full-length retrotransposed product can then undergo autonomous retrotransposition in subsequent\ngenerations. By comparison, LINE-1 elements lacking a functional YY1-binding site cannot initiate transcription at the +1 position of the 50-UTR and instead\nmay initiate transcription from various positions within the 50-UTR (represented by the numerous arrows). Thus, the resultant progeny will become progressively\nshorter, leading to the eventual formation of an element that cannot undergo autonomous retrotransposition. The red question marks (?) in the right-hand panel\nindicate uncertainties about whether the progeny LINE-1 element will be transcribed or whether it will remain retrotransposition-competent. It is likely that genomic\nsequences flanking the progenitor and progeny LINE-1 elements will influence their expression and ability to retrotranspose in vivo.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2004, Vol. 32, No. 13 3853\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nIt is noteworthy that we have identified 10 LINE-1\nsequences with intact YY1-binding sites that contain 50 exten-\nsions that range from 115 to 560 bp (available at http:\/\/\nwww.leicester.ac.uk\/ge\/ajj\/LINE1). These sequences may be\nderived from 50-transduction, indicating that, even in the pre-\nsence of a functional LINE-1 promoter, readthrough transcrip-\ntion from endogenous promoters occasionally may give rise to\nRC-L1 transcripts (3,22,32). Indeed, it is likely that the geno-\nmic context of a LINE-1 influences both its expression and\nretrotransposition capacity.\nGiven that mutations in the YY1-binding site have only\nminor effects on promoter activity and retrotransposition\nwhen present in the context of the full-length 50-UTR, one\nmight ask why has this sequence been conserved during evo-\nlution? Since the YY1-binding site plays an important role in\ndirecting transcriptional initiation near the +1 site of the\nLINE-1 50-UTR, we propose that its presence ensures that\nfull-length retrotransposed RNAs will retain an intact internal\npromoter, allowing them to undergo retrotransposition in sub-\nsequent generations (Figure 6). By comparison, although\nLINE-1 elements lacking a functional YY1-binding site\nmay initiate transcription from internal sites within the 50-\nUTR, the resultant progeny would probably lack an internal\npromoter, which rapidly would lead to their extinction as\nautonomously replicating elements. Ultimate proof of this\nhypothesis requires establishing a selection scheme that\nallows one to assay the retrotransposition potential of progeny\nLINE-1 elements in cultured cells (i.e. a two-round retrotrans-\nposition assay).\nLINE-1 sequences and non-LTR retrotransposons in other\norganisms likely have evolved a variety of mechanisms to\nensure that their respective progeny contain an internal pro-\nmoter. For example, mouse and rat LINE-1 sequences, as well\nas avian CR1 elements may use a recombination-based\nmechanism to maintain their promoter structure (48\u201351). By\ncomparison, the jockey element of Drosophila melanogaster\ncontains a downstream promoter element that serves to ensure\nits transcription starts from a specific initiator sequence\nlocated at the +1 site of the element (52,53), whereas the\nD.melanogaster TART retrotransposon may use a promoter\nlocated in the 30 end of an upstream, tandemly localized HeT-\nA retrotransposon (54). Clearly, our data highlight yet another\nmechanism that non-LTR retrotransposons have evolved to\nmaintain an internal promoter and show that there are multiple\nsolutions to this perplexing problem.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSupplementary Material is available at NAR Online.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the members of the Moran lab for thoughtful feed-\nback and discussions.
