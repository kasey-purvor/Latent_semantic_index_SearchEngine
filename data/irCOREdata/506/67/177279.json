This paper explored the cost-effectiveness of \nstapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH) compared with the standard non-surgical intervention, \nrubber band ligation (RBL), for grade II symptomatic circumferential haemorrhoids. \n \nMethods \nAn economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial conducted between October \n2002 to February 2005.  Adults were recruited from a single surgical centre in Scotland and \nrandomised to either SH or RBL.  The same surgeon performed all procedures and \ninvestigators were blinded until analyses was completed.  Primary outcomes measured at 52 \nweeks were cumulative costs to the NHS, clinical diagnosis of recurrence and quality \nadjusted life years (QALYs).   \n \nResults \n60 symptomatic men and women with confirmed clinical diagnosis of grade II symptomatic \nhaemorrhoids were randomised. Loss to follow-up was up to 10% at 52 weeks.   \n \nThe mean cost for SH was greater than RBL (mean difference - \u00a31483, 95% CI \u00a31339 to \n\u00a31676); disease recurrence was lower (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.86); and there was no \nevidence of a statistically significant difference in QALYs (-0.014, 95% CI \u20130.076 to 0.051).  \nSH was associated with a modest incremental cost per recurrence avoided at 12 months \nfollow-up (\u00a34945).  Based on current data it was considered highly unlikely to be cost-\neffective in terms of incremental cost per QALY.   \n \nConclusions \nThere is insufficient evidence about the cost-effectiveness of SH for grade II haemorrhoids to \nrecommend its use in place of RBL.  Further information is needed from larger trials with a \nlonger-term follow-up to inform subsequent economic evaluation.   \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nHaemorrhoidal disease is one of the commonest benign ano-rectal conditions and is \nassociated with relapsing and remitting symptoms. The majority of patients (75%) diagnosed \nwith second degree haemorrhoids require treatment within a few years1. Early intervention \nmay avoid advanced disease and its associated complications. The current standard \ntreatment for symptomatic grade II haemorrhoids, rubber band ligation (RBL), is readily \navailable, can be performed as an out-patient procedure, is tolerated well and does not \nrequire general anaesthesia.1  As a consequence the cost per procedure is relatively low \nThis technique, however, is associated with a treatment failure rate of more than 40%2,3 \n \nand \nthe return of symptoms will reduce quality of life and require lead to further costly treatment,   \nExcisional haemorrhoidectomy (EH) is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 treatment for \nadvanced (grade III and IV) haemorrhoids and remains the most commonly performed \nsurgical intervention.4 A systematic review comparing EH with RBL has shown no significant \ndifference in the clinical effectiveness for grade II haemorrhoids. Furthermore EH was shown \nto be associated with increased incidence of complications.5\n \n  \nStapled haemorrhoidopexy is an alternative surgical intervention accepted and performed \nwidely because of its clinical success.6,7,8  It shares a similar mechanism of action to RBL by \naddressing haemorrhoidal prolapse and bleeding whilst maintaining the presence of the anal \ncushions. It acts by relocating the haemorrhoidal cushions cranially into their original position \nby excising a strip of lower rectal mucosa (pain insensitive mucosa) and by interrupting the \nblood supply to the haemorrhoids. It is however more costly than RBL.  There is very limited \nliterature evidence available comparing stapled haemorrhoidopexy with RBL for grade III and \nIV haemorrhoids.9\n \n and there is no data available for grade II haemorrhoids.  \nIn view of the relatively high recurrence rate for symptoms following RBL and the lack of \ncomparative studies against stapled haemorrhoidopexy and the difference in treatment cost, \nwe conducted a pilot study to compare these two techniques in a randomised controlled \nsetting. This economic evaluation, conducted alongside the randomised controlled trial, \nsought to assess the cost-effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy compared with RBL \nfor grade II symptomatic haemorrhoids.   \nMETHODS \nDescription of trial \nThe trial was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing stapled haemorrhoidopexy \nwith rubber band ligation for grade 2 haemorrhoids. Further details of the trial are reported \nelsewhere9\n \n but in brief 60 participants were recruited from one centre in Aberdeen Scotland, \nbetween October 2002 and February 2005, and randomised to either stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy (n = 30) or RBL (n = 30). Patients with associated colonic malignancy, \nsymptomatic anal sphincter damage or ano-rectal sepsis were excluded from the trial.  \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all eligible participants and the Grampian \nResearch Ethics Committee approved the study (Ethics committee approval code \u2013 GREC \n01\/0297).  Participants who were randomised to stapled haemorrhoidopexy would, if \nsymptoms had not resolved, be eligible for two repeat procedures.  This was assessed at a 6 \nweek, a 26 or a 52 week follow-up or at a re-presentation.  RBL patients were eligible for a \nmaximum of four repeat procedures. Longer-term recurrence rates for both treatments were \nassessed at 40.7 (\u00b16.3) months. All analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis.  \nMeasurement of costs \nCosts included health care resource costs (from the perspective of the NHS) for initial \ntreatment and follow up events, both for secondary care and primary care. As detailed below \nresource usage was recorded as part of the trial for each individual patient and wherever \npossible, unit costs for these resources were identified at the individual patient level.  At \ninitial treatment visits and all scheduled follow up visits at 6, 26 and 52 weeks hospital \nresource use was recorded using data collection forms for each patient.  Information \nrecorded included the anaesthetic time (for stapled haemorrhoidopexy), length of time for the \nprocedures, recovery time and post procedure stay in ward, duration of any in-patient stay \nand medications.  Details of any unscheduled hospital visits, primary care contacts, over the \ncounter medications and prescriptions were obtained from a self-reported patient \nquestionnaire completed at 6, 26 and 52 weeks post randomisation.  Details of the methods \nused to derive resource used to provide the two procedures are described below.  \n \nOperative Costs \nThe resources required for RBL were based on the procedure being performed in an \noutpatient setting.  Details of the staff involved were recorded on a case report form \ncompleted at the time of surgery.  Also included on this form were details of the post \ndischarge medication and the use of consumables (disposable rubber band applicator, \ndisposable proctoscope) required for the procedure.   \n Resource costs for stapled haemorrhoidopexy included theatre running costs, assumed to \ninclude an element for recovery facilities, were derived from published sources10 to establish \na theatre cost.  The cost of staff involved in theatre were based upon the number and grade \nspecific health care professionals necessary for each procedure.  Operative costs relating to \nsurgical repair of haemorrhoids (including consumables, drugs, equipment and sterilisation) \nfor the two interventions studied were sourced from the hospital pharmacy and measured \nprospectively.  The cost of reusable items were converted into annual costs (when it was \nbelieved the equipment would last more than 1 year using a discount rate of 3.5%11\n \n). This \nvalue was divided by the amount of time the equipment would be used used in a year to give \na cost per patient.   \nIn the instance that a patient experienced a recurrence, the overall resource use of the \nrepeat surgery was assumed to be the mean value of the original surgical procedure across \nall patients.  \n \nA summary of the costs used in the analysis is provided in Table 1. All costs are at \ncalculated in 2004 prices and inflated to 2006\/7 prices using the hospital pay and prices \ninflation index.\n \n12 \nEffectiveness \nClinical effectiveness was measured in terms of whether or not the treatment had failed over \nthe 52 weeks following initial treatment. At the 52 week follow-up a clinical assessment was \nmade using proctoscopy and symptom enquiry. This was performed by an experienced \nconsultant colorectal surgeon who was blinded to the original intervention.  Further \nassessment of clinical effectiveness was undertaken at a mean follow-up of 40.7 (\u00b1 6.3) \nmonths. \n \nQuality of life was measured using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Each patient was asked to \ncomplete the EQ-5D at baseline, 3, 6, 26 and 52 weeks. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) \nwere calculated from the EQ-5D responses using UK population tariffs.13  Differences \nbetween groups were based on linear regression adjusting for the EQ-5D score at \nbaseline.14\n \n   \nCost-effectiveness \nThe incremental cost per recurrence avoided was estimated by combining the estimates of \nincremental costs and the difference in recurrence rates.  Similarly, using the estimates of \nincremental cost and QALYs, the incremental cost per QALY was estimated.  No discounting \nof costs and effects was performed, as the time horizon was only one year.  Non-parametric \nBootstrap methods were used for statistical inference on total costs, QALYs and cost per \nQALY because of skewed distributions.15\n \n   \nSensitivity Analysis \nIn economic evaluation sensitivity analysis is used to address concerns which might relate to \nsuch issues as whether the methods of estimating data influence the conclusions or whether \ndata are generalisable to other settings.  In this analysis there is uncertainty about the \nmagnitude of any difference in cost.  The total cost per patient was recalculated using \nalternative values for the procedure cost.  This was done separately for stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy and RBL. For stapled haemorrhoidopexy the initial procedure cost (and \nsimilarly the cost per re-treatment) was reduced by 25% and by 50%. For RBL, initial \nprocedure cost (and cost per re-treatment) was increased by 50% and by 100%.   \n \nWith respect to the precision surrounding estimates of the incremental cost per recurrence \navoided the cost effectiveness results were re-estimated using the extreme values of the \n95% confidence intervals for the difference in total costs and recurrence rates. This was \ndone using best case and worst case scenarios for the stapled haemorrhoidopexy \nprocedure. \n \nA further area addressed in the sensitivity analysis was the impact of imputing missing \nquality of life data.  In the base case analysis the mean difference in QALYs was estimated \nusing information from those trial participants who had utility scores available at each time \npoint.  The drawback of this approach is that a participant would be excluded if data for that \nparticipant were only available for only three of the four time points, approximately 10% of \nresponses were missing.  A second approach was therefore also adopted.  In this, the \nmissing data were imputed from the most recent previous score that was available. \n \nRESULTS \nA total of 69 patients were identified from clinic or direct access endoscopy, of which two \npatients were subsequently, deemed unsuitable (One recent RBL and another unsuitable for \nanaesthesia).   Details of the trial were presented to the remaining 67 patients, 66 of whom \nchose to participate. Of these, 64 were considered suitable for randomisation. Four patients \nwere then excluded (one could not attend hospital due to personal commitment and three \nwere not recruited for want of base line data due to technical reasons) leaving a total of 60 \neligible patients who were randomised (by computer) to either RBL or stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy.  Complete data were available for 54 patients at the end of the trial \nperiod (2 withdrew early, four moved and forwarding addresses were not obtainable before \nthe final follow-up). The baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes for this trial are \nreported elsewhere.\n \n9 \nHealth Care Costs \nThe mean total cost per patient, both in aggregate and separately for each element of health \ncare is presented in Table 2.   These are rounded to the nearest pound. The mean cost per \npatient treated using stapled haemorrhoidopexy was significantly higher than that for RBL \n(\u00a31757 compared to \u00a3273).  Much of this difference can be attributed to the initial procedure \ncost which is relatively high for stapled haemorrhoidopexy (\u00a31647 vs \u00a3102 for RBL) due to \nthe cost of the disposable stapling gun (\u00a3336) along with drugs and staff costs incurred in \ntheatre, plus the hospital stay requirement. \n \nIncremental Cost per Recurrence \nRecurrence rate at 52 weeks was significantly higher in the RBL treatment group than the \nstapling group [11 (41%), n =27, compared to 3 (11%), n = 27) OR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03, to \n0.86), P = 0.028). This gave an incremental cost per recurrence avoided from stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy of \u00a34945.  At a mean follow-up of 40.7 (\u00b16.3) months the recurrence \nrates were 12 out of 22 patients for whom data were available in the RBL group and 4 out of \n24 patients in the stapling group, OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.04, to 0.92).  This give an incremental \ncost per recurrence of \u00a33917. This estimate excludes treatment costs incurred after the first \nyear. \n \nIncremental cost per QALY \nQuality Adjusted Life Years and the EQ-5D scores at baseline and at 52 weeks are reported \nin Table 4.  Four patients in each treatment group had missing values for EQ-5D data at one \nor more time points. The mean value for QALYs was higher for the RBL patients than those \ntreated with stapled haemorrhoidopexy although the confidence intervals were wide.  In \nterms of mean incremental cost per QALY, RBL dominated stapled haemorrhoidopexy (RBL \nwas associated with lower mean cost and greater mean QALYs than the stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy group).   \n \nSensitivity analysis \nThe results of the sensitivity analyses described in the methods are presented in Table 3.  \nUnder each scenario for procedure costs and also for the best case scenario based on \nconfidence intervals for costs, RBL was the dominant procedure in terms of the incremental \ncost per recurrence avoided.  \n \nTable 5 shows that the base case results for incremental cost per QALY were also robust in \nterms of RBL being the dominant intervention for variations in procedure costs.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nWith stapled haemorrhoidopexy for grade II haemorrhoids we found that at 52 weeks there \nwas a statistically significant reduction in recurrences which was associated with a relatively \nmodest incremental cost per recurrence avoided, although it is a matter of judgement as to \nthis additional benefit is worth the extra cost.  However, there was no evidence that this \ndifference in the risk of recurrence translated into differences in quality of life.  Furthermore, \nit was unlikely that stapled haemorrhoidopexy would be considered cost-effective at \nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY based upon the 12 month data.   \n \nThe population in the trial was representative of those seen in practice and were all treated \nby a single surgeon with considerable experience in performing both procedures.  Therefore, \nit might be expected that if there were benefits to stapled haemorrhoidopexy in terms of \nquality of life then these would be seen within this study.  However, the relatively small size \nof the RCT on which this economic evaluation was based would render the results \nimprecise.  Furthermore, the time horizon over which costs and effects were considered was \nonly 52 weeks, although further information of recurrence rates was available for a mean \nfollow-up of 40.7 months.  Given the finding of increased recurrences in the rubber band \nligation arm the difference in cost might fall over a longer time horizon and that the quality of \nlife associated with the rubber band ligation arm would be reduced.  Given that the benefits \nfrom stapled haemorrhoidopexy may persist into the future it is possible to consider under \nwhat circumstances stapled haemorrhoidopexy might be considered worthwhile.  For \nexample, if society\u2019s maximum value willingness to pay for a QALY was \u00a320,00011 and the \ndifference in cost was unchanged then stapled haemorrhoidopexy would need be associated \nwith an average gain of 0.07 QALYs compared with RBL over the expected life time of a \npatient.  This might occur if, on average, patients who initially received RBL spent at least \n0.6 years more with a recurrence (and patients with a recurrence returned to their pre-\ntreatment quality of life).  Numerous factors, including the long-term performance of both \nprocedures will affect estimates of cost-effectiveness but should differences in recurrence \nrates persist then it is possible that the cost-effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy  \nmight improve but further long-term data would need to incorporated into a well designed \neconomic model to explore this fully.   \n \nThe results of the analysis were sensitive to the costs associated with stapled \nhaemorrhoidopexy.  Changes in management as well as in equipment can result in \nimprovements in the cost-effectiveness of this procedure. In terms of future research a \nfurther larger scale RCT would be required.  The design of this study might be informed by a \nmodelling exercise in which value of information methods are used to determine an optimal \ndesign and sample size.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nBased upon the data presented in this paper it is unlikely that stapled haemorrhoidopexy \nwould be considered a cost-effectiveness treatment for grade II haemorrhoids and hence \nthere is no basis to recommend its use in place of rubber band ligation.  However, the risk of \nrecurrence at 52 weeks and at a mean follow-up of 40.7 months following surgery is lower.  \nFurther information is needed from larger trials with a longer term follow-up before this \nconclusion should be revisited.   \nREFERENCES \n \n1 Nisar PJ, Scholefield JH.
