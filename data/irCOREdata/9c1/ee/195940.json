Doi: 10.1016\/j.bcp.2007.10.015Metadata only entryHuman SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have been used to investigate mechanisms involved in CREB phosphorylation after activation of two endogenously expressed Gq\/11-protein-coupled receptors, the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) and B2 bradykinin receptors. Stimulation with either methacholine or bradykinin resulted in maximal increases in CREB phosphorylation within 1 min, with either a rapid subsequent decrease (bradykinin) to basal levels, or a sustained response (methacholine). Inhibitor studies were performed to assess the involvement of a number of potential kinases in signalling to CREB phosphorylation. Removal of extracellular Ca2+, inhibition of Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) resulted in reduced CREB phosphorylation after both M3 mACh and B2 bradykinin receptor activation. In contrast, inhibition of MEK1\/2 by U0126 resulted in significantly reduced CREB phosphorylation levels after B2 bradykinin, but not M3 mACh receptor activation. In addition, we demonstrate that maintained phosphorylation of CREB is necessary for CRE-dependent gene transcription as the M3 mACh, but not the B2 bradykinin receptor activates both a recombinant CRE-dependent reporter gene, and the endogenous c-Fos gene. These data highlight the involvement of multiple, overlapping signalling pathways linking these endogenous Gq\/11-coupled metabotropic receptors to CREB and emphasize the importance of the duration of signalling pathway activation in converting a CREB phosphorylation event into a significant change in transcriptional activity","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Elsevier","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8077<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2010-12-15T14:59:19Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_112<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9550<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_113<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nRegulation of cyclic AMP response-element binding-protein (CREB) by Gq\/11-protein-coupled receptors in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nRosethorne, Elizabeth M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nNahorski, Stefan R.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nChalliss, R.A.
