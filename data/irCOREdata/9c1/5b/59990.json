However, the effects of social stress on \ndemographic density-dependence remain largely overlooked in ecological theory. Here we \ncombine behavioural experiments, physiology and population modelling to show in a top \npredator (pike Esox lucius) that social stress alone may be a primary driver of demographic \ndensity-dependence. Doubling pike density in experimental ponds under controlled prey \navailability did not significantly change prey intake by pike (i.e., did not significantly change \ninterference or exploitative competition), but induced a neuroendocrine stress response \nreflecting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy, depressed pike energetic status and lowered \npike body growth rate by 23%. Assuming fixed size-dependent survival and fecundity \nfunctions parameterized for the Windermere (UK) pike population, stress-induced downsizing \nshifts age-specific survival rates and lowers age-specific fecundity, which in Leslie matrices \nreduces population rate of increase (\uf06c) by 37 to 56%. Social stress also makes population \npersistence more dependent on old individuals by flattening elasticity profiles of \uf06c to age-\nspecific survival and fecundity. Our results support the view that accounting for non-\nconsumptive social stress from competitors and predators is necessary to accurately \nunderstand, predict and manage food-web dynamics.\nKey words: Community interactions, Corticosteroids, Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, \nLeslie matrix, Thyroid hormones, Trait-mediated interactions.\n2\nINTRODUCTION\nEcological theory classically considers that the dynamics of closed populations are driven by \ntrophic links such as competition and predation, i.e., by consumptive and lethal effects (Sibly \n& Hone 2002; Amarasekare 2002; Begon et al. 2006; Krebs 2009). However, there is \ncurrently a growing appreciation that competitors and predators may also negatively affect \ntheir prey through non-consumptive and non-lethal effects, which remain cryptic because they \nare in the same direction as consumptive and lethal effects of predation. Non-consumptive \nand nonlethal effects of predators may be mediated by plastic physiological, morphological \nand\/or behavioral changes in the prey. For instance, recent studies have shown that predator \nbehavioural avoidance, which exposes prey to less favourable habitats, may alter prey \ndynamics and have cascading effects on whole community functioning (Peacor & Werner \n2001; Schmitz et al. 2004; Pangle et al. 2007; Orrock et al. 2008; Preisser & Bolnick 2008; \nPeckarsky et al. 2008). However, predation risk may incur costs to prey not only through \nhabitat shifts, but also in terms of chronic physiological stress. For instance, reduced \nfecundity due to chronic social stress from predation risk might be involved in driving the \nfamous 10-yr population cycles in Canadian snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) (Boonstra et  \nal. 1998). However, the contribution of social stress to population dynamics remains poorly \nquantified and generally overlooked in ecological studies. Additionally, non-consumptive and \nnon-lethal effects on vital rates are rarely addressed in the context of intraspecific interactions. \nHere we quantify the effects of intraspecific social stress on population finite rate of increase \n(\uf06c) in pike (Esox lucius), an aquatic top predator widely distributed across the northern \nhemisphere (Craig 1996). \n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\nThe physiological response to stress has been extensively studied. In vertebrates, \nincreased density (crowding or confinement) often favours the development of dominance \nhierarchies in which rank is influenced by a host of factors among which body-size is often \nprevalent (Cloutier & Newberry 2000; French & Smith 2005). Behaviourally, dominance \nhierarchies are often set through aggressive interactions (Alexander & Roth 1971; Cloutier & \nNewberry 2000), but social rank can also establish without any direct conflict through visual \nexposure to opponents and predators (H\u00f6jesj\u00f6 et al. 2007; Grosenick et al. 2007; Barcellos et  \nal. 2007). Behavioural responses to social stress from dominant conspecifics and predators are \nmediated by an elevated release of serotonin in the brain, reduced brain cell proliferation, and \nactivation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis (Summers 2002; Hoshaw et al. \n2006; S\u00f8rensen et al. 2007). On the short term, activation of the HPA-axis results in a rise in \nplasma glucocorticoids. On the longer-term, stress depresses thyroid activity (K\u00fchn et al. \n1998; Walpita et al. 2007), increases standard metabolic rate, stimulates oxygen uptake and \ntransfer, mobilises energy substrates, lowers liver glycogen, and reallocates energy away from \nimmunity, growth and reproduction (Wendelaar-Bonga 1997). Hence, although stress \nincreases vigilance towards enemies and heightens capacity to fight and flight or to cope with \nenvironmental change, in the long-term stress can decrease individual survival and fecundity \nand potentially impact on population dynamics.\nWe test this hypothesis in pike, which shows both individual and population responses \nto density in the wild (Haugen et al. 2006; Edeline et al. 2007; Haugen et al. 2007; Edeline et  \nal. 2008; Winfield et al. 2008). We first experimentally quantify the effects of social stress \nalone on pike somatic growth rate by cancelling consumptive, food-related intraspecific \ndensity dependence (i.e., we increase pike density without altering interference or exploitative \ncompetition), and then we transpose laboratory results to field projections in matrix \n4\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\npopulation models parametrised for this species in Windermere (UK, see Materials and \nMethods). Windermere pike vital rates are strongly size-dependent (Haugen et al. 2007; \nCarlson et al. 2007; Edeline et al. 2007), and we thus base our demographic approach on the \nassumption that social stress influences survival and fecundity indirectly through its effect on \nsomatic growth rate. This assumption is valid in a vast majority of ecosystems in which body-\nsize determines individual fitness and affects food-web structure and dynamics (Woodward et  \nal. 2005). We show that demographic density dependence may be driven by social stress \nalone in the absence of any significant consumptive effect.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExperimentally-induced chronic social stress\nPike of fork lengths (FL) ranging from 306 to 534 mm (mean 400 \u00b1 55 SD) and body mass \n(BM) ranging from 200 to 1206 g (mean 511 \u00b1 235) were caught with gill nets in the lake \n\u00c5rungen (~ 50 km south of Oslo, Norway) just after the spawning season that starts at ice \nbreak (from May 18 to June 7 2006, and from April 23 to May 7 2007). In order to reduce \ngill-netting injuries, the nets were lifted every 20\u201330 minutes. All pike were visually \ninspected for injuries and only unharmed pike were transported in large water-filled plastic \nbags to the Norwegian Institute for Water Research\u2019s biological station at Solbergstrand \nlocated ~ 10 km from \u00c5rungen. Pike were anesthetized with benzocain, measured for FL to \nthe nearest mm, weighed for BM to the nearest g, and individually tagged with passive \nintegrated transponders introduced into the body cavity. Tagged pike were then released in 4 \n5\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\ncircular (5 m diameter), indoor experimental ponds (water volume \u2248 13 m3 each). Pike \ncaptured on the same day were homogeneously distributed among ponds, and pike body size \nat start of the experiments was not significantly different among ponds (body mass: p = \n0.9781, body length: p = 0.9999) or pike density treatment (body mass: p = 0.5012, body \nlength: p = 0.7565), but was higher in 2007 compared to 2006 (body mass: p < 0.0001, body \nlength: p < 0.0001) when tested in one single ANOVA (n = 120 observations). To limit stress \nfrom human exposure, each pond was surrounded by tarpaulins. A habitat structure (concrete \nblocks) provided in 2006 was not used by the fish and complicated prey count, and we \ntherefore did not provide any habitat structure in 2007. Feces and waste were regularly \nremoved from the ponds using fine mesh nets. Each pond was supplied with oxygenated well \nwater (mean temperature = 11.7\u00b0C \u00b1 1.0) at a flow rate of 1 m3 h-1.\nWe experimentally induced chronic social stress in pike in 2006 (from June 9 to \nAugust 10) and in 2007 (from May 10 to September 12) by increasing pike density from 10 \npike pond-1 (duplicate low density treatment, 0.5 pike m-2) to 20 pike pond-1 (duplicate high \ndensity treatment, 1 pike m-2). In the wild, numbers of pike m-2 vary widely from 0.0002 to \n0.0117 in Windermere (age-2 pike and older (des Clers et al. 1994)), 0.0006 to 0.0013 in \n\u00c5rungen (pike longer than 45 cm TL only (Sharma & Borgstr\u00f8m 2008)), from 2.8 10-5 to 3.8 \n10-4 in small Wisconsin lakes (Margenau et al. 1998), and from 3 10-5 to 5.9 10-4 in Minnesota \nlakes (Pierce & Tomcko 2003). However, population densities in key habitats are probably \nmuch higher than when the lake is considered as a whole. Hence, the two densities induced by \nour experimental setup (0.5 and 1 pike m-2) may be considered to lie in the upper range of \nnaturally occurring densities. In our experiment, ponds used for the low density treatment in \n2006 were used for the high density treatment in 2007, and vice versa. No pike died during \nthe 2006 experiment, while two pike died in 2007 (both at low density). Dead pike were \n6\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\nmeasured to the nearest mm and immediately replaced (from a stock of extra pike kept in a 5th \npond). Pike at the two densities were fed on average every 3.6 day (\u00b1 2.2 SD) with live prey \n(roach Rutilus rutilus and crucian carp Carrassius carrasius) caught in nearby lakes and \ndelivered through pipes crossing the tarpaulins (prey availability was never 0). Prey total \nlengths ranged from 61 to 231 mm (mean 85.0 \u00b1 18.5 SD) in roach and from 80 to 192 mm \n(mean 134.0 \u00b1 19.5 SD) in crucian carp. Prey size was not significantly different among \nponds (p = 0.3352) or density treatments (p = 0.9789) but was higher in 2007 compared to \n2006 (p < 0.0001) in one single ANOVA (n = 980 observations). indeed, in 2006 prey \nincluded small-sized roach, while in 2007 we used only crucian carps that were on average \nlarger than roach. Total number of prey eaten by pike was 1294 at high pike density and 676 \nat low pike density in 2006, and 703 at high pike density and 397 at low pike density in 2006.\nWe varied within-pond prey availability across the experiments (from 0.2 to 4.7 prey \npike-1; low pike density: mean 1.59 \u00b1 0.97 SD; high pike density: mean 1.51 \u00b1 0.90 SD), \ntaking care to maintain prey availability identical among ponds and pike density treatments in \norder to avoid differences in competition intensity. Square root-transformed prey availability \nwas not significantly different among ponds (p = 0.6208) or density treatments (p = 0.3219) \nbut was higher in 2006 compared to 2007 (p < 0.001, reflects smaller prey size in 2006) when \ntested in one single ANOVA (n = 244 observations). Our aim in varying prey density was to \ncover a wide range of the pike functional response, but the linear relationship between prey \navailability and pike feeding rate (from model 1 in Table 1, \n\ue08dN preyeaten pike\u22121=0.0535\u00d7\ue08dN prey available pike\u22121\u22120.1044 ) indicates that we did not saturate pike \nwith prey.\nMeasurement of response to social stress\n7\n100\n105\n110\n115\nWe checked the effects of social stress by measuring pike behaviour, energetic condition, \nhormonal status, and somatic growth. Internet cameras were set above each pond, allowing us \nto observe pike daily from an office place. Additionally, on 38 occasions in 2006 we video-\nrecorded pike attacks on a prey during a period of 30 sec to 5 min following prey addition. \nPike are notoriously cannibalistic and males are territorial during the breeding season (Craig \n1996), but we did not observe any direct agonistic behaviour or cannibalism (pike also had no \nphysical injury). Finally, prey number in each pond was counted every 2nd to 7th day, allowing \nus to calculate a pike feeding rate Fr (in prey eaten pike-1, n = 244 observations). At the end of \neach experiment, pike were sampled from their pond using hand nets and immediately killed \nwith an overdose of metomidate (270 mg L-1, cortisol-release inhibitor (Iversen et al. 2003)) \nmixed with benzocain (40 mg L-1, pain killer). Time used to sample all pike from one pond \nvaried from 1 to 4 min (2 min 12 sec on average), i.e., less than the putative delay necessary \nfor onset of cortisol release in teleosts (5 min (Gamperl et al. 1994)). Killed pike were \nmeasured for FL to the nearest mm, weighed to the nearest g, and dissected for determination \nof gender. Liver mass was weighed to the nearest 10-1 g. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) provided \nan indication of energetic status (glycogen storage, long-term stress effects) and was \ncalculated as the ratio between measured and standard liver mass. We estimated standard liver \nmass using the linear regression of log-transformed liver mass on log-transformed BM. \nAdditionally, blood was sampled by caudal puncture, centrifuged, and plasma was \nstored at a temperature of -80\u00b0C before hormonal measurements. Heparin was not efficient at \npreventing coagulation of pike blood and we therefore used EGTA (ethylene glycol \ntetraacetic acid) powder as an anticoagulant. This did not interfere with hormonal \nmeasurements. Hormone analyses were performed at the Hormone Laboratory, Aker \n8\n120\n125\n130\n135\n140\nUniversity Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Plasma cortisol is usually used as a stress indicator but \nbecause cortisol levels rapidly respond to handling (Gamperl et al. 1994) we also measured \nplasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) as well as the T3\/ T4 ratio \n(Edeline et al. 2004) as endocrine markers of long-term physiological stress (see \nintroduction). Total plasma cortisol (in nmol L-1) was assayed by radioimmunoassay \nfollowing the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Los \nAngeles, CA). Free circulating T3 (in nmol L-1), and total circulating T4 (in pmol L-1) were \nassayed by competitive fluoroimmunoassays, again following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions \n(Delfia, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). All assays were tested and validated for \npike plasma before samples were analyzed. \nModelling response to social stress\nWe explored the effect of social stress on pike using statistical models for which detailed \nstructures are provided in Table 1. However, before proceeding to the analysis of individual \nresponses we performed a preliminary MANOVA approach (Multivariate Analysis of \nVariance) that controls for possible type-1 statistical errors due to multiple tests on non-\nindependent response variables. In one MANOVA, we grouped responses and predictors from \nmodels 1 and 2 in Table 1 (behavioural responses measured at the pond level), while in \nanother MANOVA we grouped responses and predictors for models 3-9 in Table 1 (responses \nmeasured at the individual level). Both MANOVAs indicated a highly significant effect of \npike density (p = 0.0036 on pond-level behavioural responses, and p = 0.0002 on individual \nresponses). We detected a significant pond effect on pike behaviour, somatic growth, HSI, \nplasma cortisol, plasma T4 and plasma T3\/T4, and we thus analyzed these responses with \n9\n145\n150\n155\n160\n165\nrestricted maximum likelihood (REML) mixed-effects models with pond as the grouping \nfactor (Table 1). To model feeding rate, somatic growth, HSI, plasma cortisol, plasma T4 and \nplasma T3\/T4, we used linear REML mixed models in the nlme library of R (Pinheiro & Bates \n2000; R Development Core Team 2008). To model pike behaviour (probability for observing \na video-recorded attack by a pike on a prey during prey addition), we used a binomial (logit \nlink) generalized mixed model fitted by REML and Laplace approximation in the lme4 library \nof R (Bates 2005). Finally, there was no significant pond effect on plasma T3, which was \nmore efficiently modelled with a standard linear model than with a mixed model (comparison \nof Akaike's Information Criterions, AICs, based on ML parameter estimation (Pinheiro & \nBates 2000)). \nDemographic cost of social stress\nWe computed effect size of social stress on pike somatic growth using predictions from model \n3 in Table 1 for averaged covariates (i.e., adjusted mean density effect). Predicted length \nincrease is 0.30 mm day-1 at low density and 0.23 mm day-1 at high density, yielding a 23% \ndifference in somatic growth rate. We used this effect size of social stress on length increase \nto project the demographic costs of social stress in Windermere pike, for which survival and \nfecundity are length-dependent (Haugen et al. 2007; Carlson et al. 2007). Windermere is a \nglacial valley lake of the English Lake District in which pike have been sampled each year \nsince 1944 as part of a long-term scientific monitoring program (Le Cren 2001; Winfield et  \nal. 2008). A spring (March-April) component of this sampling was designed to capture a large \nsize range of pike, which were all measured for total body length (TL, to the nearest cm), \ntagged and released. Resulting capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data have been extensively \n10\n170\n175\n180\n185\n190\ndescribed in two recent papers (Haugen et al. 2006; Haugen et al. 2007). Briefly, an \nindividual pike tagged in spring of year t was considered to have survived through the \nsummer of year t (survival = 1) if recaptured at any point in time after the summer of year t \n(Carlson et al. 2007). In contrast, a fish that was never recaptured after the summer of year t \nwas attributed a survival of 0 for this summer. We built a size-dependent nonlinear survival \nfunction s(BL) with a natural cubic spline in a binomial (logit link) additive model (Fig. 1A, \nGAM function, mgcv library of the R software (Wood 2006; R Development Core Team \n2008); n = 5,065 including male, female and immature fish for a wide size range and a robust \nestimation; edf = 4.078; Chi2 value = 528.1; p < 0.0001]. \nAs part of the scientific program, pike are also sampled in winter (October-February) \nusing gill-nets (64 mm mesh size) which target pike longer than 54 cm (Frost & Kipling \n1967). All pike captured this way are killed, sexed, measured for TL (to the nearest cm), and \nback-calculated for length-at-age using opercular bones (Frost & Kipling 1959). Additionally, \nfemale fecundity (total number of eggs) has been estimated since 1963 (Kipling & Frost \n1969). We used the fecundity data to obtain a size-dependent fecundity function F(BL) with a \nnatural cubic spline in a GAM (Fig. 1C; n = 3,695 females; edf = 5.915; F value = 2,339; p < \n0.0001). We equated age-specific survival and fecundity as sa = s(BLa) and Fa = F(BLa), \nrespectively (black solid lines in Figs. 1B and 1D), where BLa is mean female body length at \nage a in the back-calculated length-at-age dataset. We quantified the effect of added social \nstress on Windermere pike survival and fecundity (red dashed lines in Figs. 1B and 1D) by \nreducing BLa by 23 % so that sa = s(0.77*BLa) and Fa = F(0.77*BLa). We calculated 95% \nconfidence limits for this effect as sa = s[(0.77 \u00b1 1.96 SE)*BLa] and Fa = F[(0.77 \u00b1 1.96 \nSE)*BLa], where SE is the standard error of the predicted effect size of stress on pike somatic \ngrowth.\n11\n195\n200\n205\n210\n215\nResultant age- and density-specific survival and fecundity estimates sa,D and Fa,D \nprovided entries in Leslie matrices of the following form (Caswell 2001):\nM=[\n0 0 \ue0c8 s2, D F3, D \u22ef \u22ef \ue0c8 sa\u22121, D Fa , D\n6.56\u00d710\u22124 0 0 \u22ef \u22ef 0\n0 s1,D 0 \u22ef \u22ef \u22ee\n0 0 s2, D \u22ef \u22ef \u22ee\n\u22ee \u22ee \u22ee \u22f1 \u22ee \u22ee\n0 0 0 \u22ef sa\u22122,D 0\n]\nwhere \ue0c8 is the proportion of females in a clutch (0.5) and maturity occurs at age 3 (i.e., F = \n0 for a < 3). Survival from the egg to age 1 was taken equal to 6.56 10-4, which is the average \nof literature values (Wright 1990; Masse et al. 1993; Minns et al. 1996; Farell 2001). We \nestimated the demographic cost of social stress by computing population finite rate of increase \n(\uf06c\uf03b Nt+1 = \uf06c\uf020Nt) as the dominant eigenvalue of M for maximum a ranging from 3 to 10 under \nboth control conditions (i.e., Windermere conditions) and added social stress conditions. We \ncalculated 95% confidence limits for the effect of social stress on \uf06c by using upper and lower \n95% confidence limits of sa and Fa in M. Finally, we computed elasticities of \uf06c to age-specific \nsurvival and fecundity as:\nx\n\ue0c1\n\u2202\ue0c1\n\u2202 x\n= x\ue0c1\u2211i , j\n\u2202\ue0c1\n\u2202mij\n\u2202mij\n\u2202 x\nwhere parameter x is age-specific survival or fecundity, and mij is matrix M entry in row i and \ncolumn j (Caswell 2001). Computations were performed using SCILAB software (Digiteo, \n12\n220\n225\n230\nhttp:\/\/www.scilab.org\/). 95% confidence limits for the effect of social stress on elasticities \nwere obtained from matrices M including upper and lower 95% confidence limits of sa and Fa\uf02e\nRESULTS\nPike response to social stress\nEndocrine measures generally supported the occurrence of social stress at an increased pike \ndensity. Plasma hormone levels were as follows: 34.5 \u00b1 43.8 (SD) nmol L-1 cortisol, 16.2 \u00b1 \n8.7 pmol L-1 T4 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.7 nmol L-1 T3 at high density, and 24.9 \u00b1 37.7 nmol L-1 cortisol, \n22.8 \u00b1 11.8 pmol L-1 T4 and 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 nmol L-1 T3 at low density. Possibly due to a very large \nindividual variability, the effect of increased pike density on pike circulating cortisol levels \nwas not statistically significant (model 6, Table 1). However, increased pike density \nsignificantly decreased pike thyroid activity (both plasma T4 and T3, models 7 and 8 in Table \n1) and significantly increased pike T3\/T4 ratio (model 9, Table 1), indicating a physiological \nstress. Interestingly, pike physiological stress increased with a smaller body-size (models 6-9 \nin Table 1), suggesting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy. \nPike mean feeding rate was 0.43 \u00b1 0.57 prey pike-1 day-1 at high density, and 0.45 \u00b1 \n0.55 prey pike-1 day-1 at low density. Pike feeding rate was stimulated by an increase in the \nnumber of prey available but was not significantly affected by pike density, indicating that no \nsignificant difference in interference or exploitative competition occurred among density \ntreatments (model 1, Table 1). Note that a Time*Density interaction was not significant in \nmodel 1 (p = 0.1511) and increased model AIC from -62.5 to -46.8, further indicating that \npike consumed prey at the same rate in the two density treatments. The probability of \n13\n235\n240\n245\n250\n255\nobserving an attack by a pike on a prey during prey addition into the ponds increased with \npike density (model 2, Table 1). \nFinally, pike mean somatic growth was 0.32 \u00b1 0.28 mm day-1 and 1.41 \u00b1 0.68 g day-1 \nat high density, and 0.35 \u00b1 0.25 mm day-1 and 1.85 \u00b1 0.76 g day-1 at low density (see also \npredicted somatic growth in Materials and Methods). Increased pike density significantly \ndepressed individual pike somatic growth in both length (model 3, Table 1) and mass (model \n4, Table 1), indicating a depressed energetic status despite a similar food intake. Increased \npike density significantly decreased pike hepatosomatic index (model 5, Table 1), further \nsupporting the view that social stress depressed pike energetic status. \nDemographic cost of social stress in pike\nDecreased somatic growth from social stress shifts age-specific survival rightward (Fig. 1B), \nand age-specific fecundity downward (Fig. 1D). These stress-induced changes in pike vital \nrates result in a 37 to 56 % decrease in \uf06c\uf020for maximum ages in the population decreasing from \n10 to 3 (Fig. 2). Average age of mature female pike in Windermere is 5 years old, an age at \nwhich somatic growth depression from social stress reduces \uf06c by 49 %. Somatic growth \nreduction from social stress shifts elasticities of \uf06c to age-specific survival and fecundities \ntowards older age classes (Fig.3), i.e., under social stress fitness is less dependent on early \nvital rates and more dependent on late vital rates. However, social stress does not change \nsurvival to maturity as being the most critical fitness component (Fig. 3). \nDISCUSSION\n14\n260\n265\n270\n275\n280\nIn this study, we couple behaviour, physiology and demographic modelling to reconstruct \nfully the whole suite of biological mechanisms underlying the effects of social stress on \npopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that, cues from conspecifics can induce a \nneuroendocrine stress response reflecting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy, depress \nindividual energetic status and somatic growth, and severely lower population rate of increase \nunder size-dependent survival and fecundity. Importantly, our results show that social stress \ncan alone drive demographic density-dependence without any significant change in the \nconsumptive effects of interference or exploitative competition.\nSocial stress\nSocial stress is underlain by a cascade of neuroendocrinological, physiological and \nbehavioural mechanisms. Activation of the HPA-axis in the presence of potential competitors \nand predators is mediated by visual, auditive, chemical and other types of cues. In our \nexperiment, we did not observe any direct agonistic interaction or physical injury on pike but \npike physiological stress was negatively linked to individual body size, suggesting that \nindividuals were able to assess risk from a distance. This result is in line with data in various \ntaxa of vertebrates showing that social rank in dominance hierarchies increases with body-size \n(Cloutier & Newberry 2000; French & Smith 2005), and that visual cues alone are enough to \ninduce social stress and set dominance hierarchies (H\u00f6jesj\u00f6 et al. 2007; Barcellos et al. 2007; \nGrosenick et al. 2007). Our results are also consistent with results in the wild, showing that \nindividual pike spatially avoid their larger conspecifics (Nilsson 2006). Indeed, pike is \nstrongly cannibalistic (Craig 1996), and larger conspecifics do not only represent potential \ncompetitors for pike but also potential predators. \n15\n285\n290\n295\n300\n305\nThe effects of social stress on individual physiology are remarkably consistent among \nvertebrates. Stress-associated rise in plasma glucocorticoids depresses thyroid activity (K\u00fchn \net al. 1998; Walpita et al. 2007), increases standard metabolic rate and reallocates energy \naway from immunity, growth and reproduction (Wendelaar-Bonga 1997). In our experiment, \ndepressed pike thyroid status (lower T4 and T3, elevated T3\/T4 ratio), liver mass and somatic \ngrowth rate (revealing activated gluconeogenesis and resting metabolism) are typical of an \nactivation of the HPA-axis. However, we did not observe any significant effect of pike \ndensity on pike plasma cortisol level, probably because individual variability far exceeded \nmean differences. Although we followed standard sampling procedures (Gamperl et al. 1994), \nit can not be excluded that pike plasma cortisol levels were affected by this process. In \nparticular, sampling might have increased cortisol levels more at low than high density \nbecause chronically stressed animals show a less rapid onset of cortisol response to acute \nstressors (Summers 2002).\nAt the behavioural level, an activation of the HPA-axis is often associated with \nincreased locomotor activity. In brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) held in lake enclosures, \ndoubling the density (from 4 to 8 fish per 8 m3 enclosure) reduced somatic growth by 50 % \nwithout any change in food consumption (Marchand & Boisclair 1998). This effect was \nattributed to increased locomotor activity (swimming and aggression). In our experiment, pike \nwere highly static, except during attacks on prey or when we were cleaning ponds of faeces. \nWeak swimming activity by pike was to be expected because pike are ambush hunters (Craig \n1996). Also, absence of pronounced swimming by pike might reflect conflicting metabolic \ndemands between digestion and movement since individuals were fed at a high rate. However, \nwe detected that attack rate during prey addition increased at an increased pike density, a \nresult that might reflect an increased locomotor activity.\n16\n310\n315\n320\n325\n330\nDemographic cost of stress\nOur results suggest that social stress can be a primary driver of pike population dynamics. \nWas the strength of pike response to stress of a reasonable magnitude in our experiment? We \nmay have overestimated stress by doubling pike density (from 0.5 to 1 pike m-2) because the \ndoubling of densities rarely occurs under natural conditions, and because we did not provide \nany suitable habitat structure in which individuals could hide from each other. However, we \nmay also have underestimated social stress by employing densities that were in the upper \nrange of naturally occurring densities (see Materials and Methods). Indeed, if we reasonably \nassume that the relationship between density and social stress is asymptotic, a large density \nincrease at high densities (as in our experiment) is likely to induce less stress than a smaller \ndensity increase at lower densities (as in the wild). Therefore, we suggest that stress increase \nin our experiment was within a roughly natural magnitude. How reliable is our estimate of the \ndemographic cost of social stress in pike? A full account of the effects of social stress on pike \nvital rates would have probably yielded a stronger decrease in \uf06c than estimated here because \n(1) Windermere data taken as control in fact already include naturally occurring social stress, \n(2) we did not evaluate the direct effects of social stress on survival (e.g., immunity \ndepression) and fecundity, and (3) we did not assume any social stress effect for survival to \nage-1. Therefore, we suggest that somatic growth decrease from social stress can have a very \nstrong effect on population dynamics. Reduced individual growth from social stress also \nflattens the elasticity profiles of \uf06c to age-specific survival and fecundity, therefore making \npopulation persistence more dependent on old individuals. The impact of social stress on \npopulation dynamics and its ramifications for ecosystem-level processes are likely to vary \n17\n335\n340\n345\n350\naccording to species' position in the food-web. In key species like top predators, the effects of \nsocial stress are likely to propagate down in the food-web and influence whole ecosystem \nfunctioning. At lower trophic levels, social stress might have less influence on the food-web, \nbut a multiplicity of competitors and predators may increase stress intensity. Hence, further \nstudies are needed to characterize social stress and its demographic cost at different trophic \nlevels, and to ultimately quantify the contribution of stress to whole community dynamics. \nConclusion and implications\nStress allows vertebrates to cope with perturbations and recover homeostasis at the expense of \nsuppressing non immediately-essential activities. In the long term, stress diverts energy away \nfrom immunity, somatic growth and reproduction. Our results suggest that somatic growth \nreduction from chronic social stress can, alone, severely decrease population rate of increase \nwhen survival and fecundity are size-dependent. Somatic growth reduction from social stress \nalso flattens the elasticity of \uf06c to age-specific survival and fecundity, i.e., makes population \npersistence more fragile as it depends more on older, scarcer individuals. Ecosystems are \nreplete with stressful social interactions that can depress body size, which is itself strongly \nlinked to individual fitness in a vast majority of ecosystems. Therefore, we suggest that our \nresults are of a general ecological value, and that a better integration of the effects of social \nstress into theory would enrich our understanding of population and community dynamics. \nFor instance, the existence and strength of particular trophic links is often assessed using \nobservational data on changes in population and species abundance through time. Such \nstudies may overestimate the strength, rate or scale of trophic links if they do not account for \nthe non-consumptive effects of social stress. Invasive or introduced competitors and \n18\n355\n360\n365\n370\n375\npredators, or other sources of disturbance (e.g., human activities, habitat loss...) can also be \nmore harmful to local populations than initially expected if they increase social stress. We \ntherefore suggest that management and conservation plans should routinely integrate a \nquantitative evaluation of the effects of social stress.\nAKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to Elise Pouille, Stephanie Carlson, Katja Saggese, Lars Flodmark, Philippe \nSabarros and Marcos Llope for help with pike and prey sampling.

The effect of social stress (density) on pike behaviour and physiology (BM: body \nmass, D: density, Exp: experiment, FL: fork length, Fr: feeding rate, HSI: hepathosomatic \nindex; selection of model structure based on AIC). \n*: sequential decomposition of the contributions of fixed-effects terms.\n\u2020: i.e. number of prey pike-1 at previous observation.\n\u2021: this model also incorporated within-pond temporal autocorrelation (autoregressive function \nof time of order 1 and moving average of time of order 2).\n23\nFig. 1. Projected effect of social stress-induced downsizing on size- and age-dependent \nvital rates of Windermere pike. A. Windermere pike survival probability as a function of \nbody-length with 95 % confidence limits. B. Corresponding survival probability as a function \nof pike age without (black solid line, control) and with (red dashed line) the added effect of \nsocial stress on pike somatic growth rate (thin red dashed lines represent 95% confidence \nlimits for the effect of social stress on pike somatic growth). C. Windermere female pike \nfecundity as a function of body-length with 95% confidence limits. D. Corresponding \nfecundity as a function of pike age without (black solid line, control) and with (red dashed \nline) the added effect of social stress on somatic growth rate (first reproduction occurs at age \n3; thin red dashed lines represent 95% confidence limits for the effect of social stress on pike \nsomatic growth).\n24\nFig. 2. The demographic cost of social stress in pike. Projected effect of experimentally-\nmeasured somatic growth reduction from social stress on Windermere pike population rate of \nincrease (\uf06c), estimated for different maximum ages in the population (starting from female \nfirst reproduction at age 3;  thin red dashed lines represent 95% confidence limits for the \neffect of social stress on pike somatic growth). Horizontal, black dashed line at \uf06c = 1 \nrepresents the limit at which population size is temporally stable (Nt+1 = Nt).\n25\nFig.3. Effect of social stress on population response to perturbation. The elasticity of \npopulation asymptotic growth rate (\uf06c) with respect to changes in age-specific survival and \nfecundity without and with the added effect of social stress on somatic growth rate (thin red \ndashed lines represent 95% confidence limits for the effect of social stress on pike somatic \ngrowth).\n26\n"}
