When \nmodelling the hydrological impacts of climate change, using data from climate models, \npresent models generally do not provide direct estimates of PE from the land surface. \nEstimates thus have to be calculated from other climate variables, and many existing \nformulae can be applied. This paper compares the well-established, more physically-\nbased but data-intensive, Penman-Monteith PE against a simple, temperature-based (T-\nbased) PE, when calculated from readily-available monthly climate model data over \nBritain (for five global and eight regional climate models). The performance of the two \nPE formulations is compared to MORECS PE (a gridded dataset derived by the UK Met \nOffice from weather observations, using a modified Penman-Monteith formulation) for \nthe baseline period 1961-1990, and the changes in the two PE estimates between the \n1970s and the 2080s are compared. The results show that the T-based PE matches \nMORECS PE better than does Penman-Monteith PE, for all the climate models studied. \nHowever, the changes in the two types of PE between the 1970s and 2080s are different, \nfor each of the climate models, and these affect the modelled hydrological impacts. This \nis illustrated using three example catchments spread across Britain. The uncertainty \nintroduced by the PE formulation is less than that due to the climate model, but could \nstill be important for some applications. \n \nKeywords \nClimate change impacts; hydrology; potential evaporation; uncertainty \n \n1. Introduction \n \nEvaporation from the land surface forms an important part of the water budget of a \ncatchment, and needs to be accounted for within hydrological modelling. Continuous \nsimulation hydrological models generally require (as a minimum) inputs of rainfall and \npotential evaporation (PE), where the latter is defined as \u2018the amount of water that \nwould evaporate if sufficient water were available\u2019. This contrasts with actual \nevaporation (AE), the rate of which is less than or equal to that of PE as it is dependant \n 2 \non the water available in the soil. Evaporation rates also depend on the type of land \ncover, but \u2018short grass\u2019 is often assumed as the standard. \n \nThere are numerous different formulae available in the literature for the calculation of \nPE. The complexity of these formulae varies greatly, from those dependant on just one \natmospheric variable, often temperature (e.g. Thornthwaite 1948, Jensen and Haise \n1963), to those requiring a number of other variables, such as relative humidity, wind \nspeed and net solar radiation (e.g. Penman 1948, Priestley and Taylor 1972, Thom and \nOliver 1977). When modelling under the current climate, observed data are potentially \navailable to produce PE estimates using whichever formula a modeller prefers. For \nBritain, monthly PE data can be obtained from MORECS (Meteorological Office \nRainfall and Evaporation Calculation System; Thompson et al. 1981, Hough and Jones \n1997) for 201 squares on a 40 x 40 km grid. These data are based on the Penman-\nMonteith equation for PE (Monteith, 1965), which involves all four of the atmospheric \nvariables mentioned above. However, it is important to note that calibration of a \nhydrological model with such \u2018observed\u2019 data necessarily means that the calibration is \ntuned to the particular form of PE estimates chosen (e.g. Andreassian et al. 2004). \n \nWhen modelling climate change impacts, data from (Global or Regional) Climate \nModels (GCMs or RCMs) are often used. Usually, climate models only provide direct \nestimates of AE from their land-surface schemes, not PE, and not all of the variables \nrequired for the calculation of more complex PE formulae are available from all climate \nmodels. Sometimes replacement variables can be used instead (see Section 2), but not \nalways. This leaves the modeller with somewhat of a dilemma: should they not use any \nclimate model where calculation of their preferred form of PE is not possible, or should \nthey change to an alternative, simpler, form of PE, for which the required data are \navailable for all of the climate models they wish to use? If the latter option were to be \nchosen, the same formula should ideally be used for all of the climate models, to \nmaintain consistency of method. \n \nStudies have shown that climate model uncertainty, particularly that of global models, is \na major source of hydrological uncertainty under climate change (e.g. Arnell 1999; \nJenkins and Lowe 2003; Wilby and Harris 2006; Cameron 2006; Prudhomme 2006; \nGraham et al. 2007; New et al. 2007; Kay et al., in press). This suggests that, in studies \naiming to show as wide a range of impacts uncertainty as possible, the use of as many \nclimate models as possible should be the preferred option. In addition, evidence from \nOudin et al. (2005) suggests that the precise PE formulation is not critical for the \nperformance of rainfall-runoff models. They compared the performance of four \nconceptual rainfall-runoff models when given (bias-corrected) PE data derived using 27 \nalternative formulae, for 308 catchments spread over three countries, and found that a \nlarge number of these formulae performed similarly, in terms of the fit of observed and \nsimulated flows. Temperature-based formulae, in particular, were often found to \nperform similarly to (or better than) much more complex formulations. Similarly, \nKannan et al. (2007) found that a simple temperature-based PE formula performed \nbetter than Penman-Monteith PE, for a distributed hydrological model run for a \ncatchment in eastern England. Oudin et al. (2005) propose and test a simple, \ntemperature-based PE formula, which initially seems like it could be a good choice for \nuse with climate model data.  \n 3 \n \nHowever, in the context of climate change it may not be that simple. When considering \nchanges in PE between current (or baseline) and future climates, it may be that changes \nin atmospheric variables other than temperature could have an important effect on \noverall changes in PE. This is demonstrated by the sensitivity study of Gong et al. \n(2006) for example, which shows that, for a large river basin in China, Penman-\nMonteith PE is generally more sensitive to changes in relative humidity than air \ntemperature. This means that, for a climate change impact study, the use of more \nphysically-based PE formulae, such as Penman-Monteith, could be preferable as they \nwould include the effect of changes in more atmospheric variables. Arnell (1999) \ninvestigated the sensitivity of modelled changes in European runoff to PE formulation, \nunder a given climate change scenario. He compared two PE formulae, Penman-\nMonteith and Priestley-Taylor (the latter includes only temperature and net radiation), \nand found that they predicted differing changes in runoff, even of different directions in \na number of regions (including South-East England), despite giving similar estimates of \ncurrent runoff. \n \nThis paper compares the performance of Penman-Monteith PE with the simple, \ntemperature-based formula proposed by Oudin et al. (2005) (see Section 2), when \ncalculated from climate model data (both from GCMs and RCMs). Monthly mean PE \ndata calculated for the baseline period (1961-1990) for each method are compared to \nMORECS PE data over Britain for the same period (Section 3). The changes in the two \nforms of PE between the baseline period and the future period (1971-2100) are then \ncompared (Section 4). Section 5 demonstrates the hydrological impact uncertainty (both \nfor flooding and water resources applications), for a small number of catchments in \nBritain, caused by the use of the different PE formulae. The results are discussed in \nSection 6. \n \n2. Models and methods \n \nThis section describes the two PE formulae that will be tested, introduces the (Global \nand Regional) climate models for which the formulae will be applied, and describes the \nhydrological model and the method used to demonstrate the effect of the different PE \nformulae on the hydrological impacts of climate change. \n \n2.1 PE formulae \n \n2.1.1 Penman-Monteith PE \n \nThe Penman-Monteith formulation for PE (Monteith, 1965) over short grass can be \nexpressed as: \n \n     \n)1(\n\/)()(1\nas\nadapan\nw\nPM\nrr\nreecGR\nPE\n++\u2206\n\u2212+\u2212\u2206\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03c1\n\u03bb\u03c1\n, \n(1) \n \nwhere  \n\u0000\n is the latent heat flux (taken as 2.45x10\n6\n J\/kg),  \n 4 \n\u0000\nw is the density of water (taken as 1000 kg\/m\n3\n),  \n\u0000\na is the density of air (taken as 1.00 kg\/m\n3\n),  \ncp is the specific heat of air (taken as 1013 J\/kg\/\n o\nC) \n\u0001 is the psychrometric constant (taken as 0.066 kPa\/\n o\nC),  \nRn is the net solar radiation (J\/m\n2\n\/s), \nG is the soil heat flux (taken as 0 J\/m\n2\n\/s), \nea=e(Ta)=0.611 exp(17.27 Ta \/ (Ta+237.3)) is the saturation vapour pressure \n(kPa), where Ta is the air temperature (\no\nC), \n=dea\/dTa=17.27x237.3 ea \/ (Ta+237.3)\n2\n is the slope of the vapour pressure \ncurve (kPa\/\n o\nC), \ned=e(Td) is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), with Td the dew-point temperature \n(\no\nC),  \nra=208\/W2 is the aerodynamic resistance (s\/m), where W2 is the wind speed \n(m\/s) at a height of 2 m, and  \nrs is the surface resistance (taken as 70 s\/m for short grass),  \ngiving PEPM in units of m\/s (see Allen et al. (1994) for more details). Although \ndeveloped for application with weather data at a daily time-step, mean monthly weather \ndata can be used to compute mean monthly PEPM, which will be very similar to the \naverage of daily PEPM computed from daily weather data (Allen et al. 1998, p69). \n \nThe way in which MORECS implements a slightly modified Penman-Monteith \nformulation, to convert synoptic station data into estimates of PE on a 40 x 40 km grid \nover Britain, is described in detail by Thompson et al. (1981) and Hough et al. (1996), \nwith an overview given by Hough and Jones (1997). Briefly, daily sunshine, \ntemperature, vapour pressure and wind speed data taken from synoptic stations are \nnormalised\/standardised, before being interpolated to grid-square average values. These \nare then reverse normalised\/standardised before being used in a Penman-Monteith PE \nformulation similar to that given above, to calculate daily PE and subsequently \nweekly\/monthly mean PE.  \n \nThe main difference between the formulation described above and that used within \nMORECS is a correction for the assumption that surface temperature equals the \nmeasured (air) temperature. MORECS also allows a seasonal grass cover so uses a \ndifferent value of rs for each month, with values in the range 44.5 s\/m (late spring) to \n88.7 s\/m (winter) (with an average of about 73 s\/m). Also, MORECS does not assume \nG=0, but the effect of this term is small, for a grass land cover over 10-30 day periods \n(Allen et al. 1994). One feature of the MORECS implementation necessary for the \ncalculation of Penman-Monteith PE from climate model data is the use of wind speed at \na height of 10 m rather than at 2 m. Assuming a logarithmic profile, this gives \nra=243\/W10, where W10 is the wind speed (m\/s) at a height of 10 m (see Thompson et al. \n(1981), section 4.2.2.2).  \n \n2.1.2 Temperature-based PE \n \nThe simple, temperature-based (T-based) PE formulation suggested by Oudin et al \n(2005), based on a study of the performance of over 25 existing PE formulations when \nused as input to four different hydrological models for over 300 catchments, is given by:  \n \n 5 \n     \n100\n5+\n= a\nw\ne\nT\nTR\nPE\n\u03bb\u03c1\n            if Ta+ 5 > 0, \n     0=TPE                            otherwise, \n(2) \n \nwhere \n\u0000\n and \u0000w are as in section 2.1.1, Re is extraterrestrial radiation (J\/m\n2\n\/s), which is \ndependant on latitude and Julian day only (see Allen et al. 1994), and Ta is the mean \ndaily air temperature (\no\nC), giving PET in units of m\/s. Although this formulation was \ndeveloped for use with (long-term) mean daily data, there is evidence that monthly data \ncan be used in models similar to this to compute monthly PET, without significantly \naffecting results (Federer et al. 1996). Note that this T-based PE formulation does not \nallow negative values for PE, however the Penman-Monteith formulation can result in \nnegative values. Here, all negative PE values have been reset to zero. \n \n2.1.3 Comparison of MORECS PE with T-based PE derived from MORECS\u2019 T \n \nAs an initial test of the T-based formulation of PE, the monthly time-series of grid-\ninterpolated mean temperature data were taken from within MORECS and applied in \nthe T-based formulation, to calculate monthly mean T-based PE on the MORECS \n40 x 40 km grid. Figure 1 compares the resulting T-based PE with MORECS PE, as \nmean monthly values and mean annual totals (for 1961-1990) averaged over two \nregions, over the north and south of Britain. This shows that, compared to (Penman-\nMonteith) MORECS PE, the T-based formulation generally underestimates in the \nwinter and spring but overestimates in the summer, with a slightly later peak. The mean \nannual PE totals are very similar, but with T-based PE slightly less than MORECS PE. \n \n2.2 Climate models \n \nGlobal Climate Models (GCMs) are currently run, of necessity, on quite coarse grids \n(generally ~300 km over the UK). Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are limited-area \nversions of global models and so can be run on finer grids (generally ~50 km over the \nUK), with improved representation of topography etc. When forced by GCM boundary \nconditions, RCMs can provide dynamic downscaling of GCM climate change scenarios. \nHowever, RCMs have not currently been run for all available GCMs. Consequently, \ndata from a set of GCMs is applied here, as well as data from a set of RCMs.  \n \nFigure 1 \n 6 \n2.2.1 Global Climate Models \n \nThere are a number of GCMs, developed by various institutes across the globe, and \nthese produce different effects on global climate from given emissions scenarios. They \nhave different climate sensitivities (the change in global mean temperature under a \ndoubling of CO2) and show different patterns of change in temperature and precipitation \n(see Figures 24-27 of Hulme et al. (2002)). Various monthly mean climate variables, \nunder the SRES A2 emissions scenario (IPCC 2000), were obtained from the IPCC data \ndistribution centre (ipcc-ddc.cru.uea.ac.uk) for five of the GCMs used for the IPCC \nThird Assessment Report (TAR): HadCM3, CCSR\/NIES, CGCM2, CSIRO-Mk2 and \nECHAM4 (Table 1). These have been used to calculate both the Penman-Monteith and \nT-based PE in this study.  \n \nFor the GCMs, Penman-Monteith PE is calculated as described in Section 2.1.1, \nincluding the values for rs and G as suggested by Allen et al. (1994), rather than as used \nby MORECS. As summarised in Table 1, solar radiation, Rn, mean air temperature, Ta, \nand the 10 m wind speed, W10, were available for each GCM, but different data had to \nbe used for the calculation of actual vapour pressure, ed,, in each case. ECHAM4 is the \nonly GCM to give dew-point temperature, which is the recommended variable, however \nthese data were only available for 1990 onwards so the baseline monthly mean dew-\npoint temperature was calculated for 1990\u20131994. Specific humidity was used in the \ncalculation of ed for the CGCM2 and CCSR GCMs, whilst relative humidity was used \nfor the HadCM3 GCM. For the CSIRO GCM, minimum temperature had to be used in \nplace of dew-point temperature, as no humidity data were available. Data from two \nfurther GCMs \u2014 NCAR and GFDL (USA) \u2014 are available from the IPCC, but the \nNCAR data only run from 1980, so none of the baseline means can be established, and \nthe GFDL data do not include the information on humidity or dew-point temperature \nrequired to calculate Penman-Monteith PE.  \n \n2.2.2 Regional Climate Models \n \nThe EU-funded PRUDENCE project (Christensen et al. 2007; http:\/\/prudence.dmi.dk) \nproduced high-resolution climate change scenarios for Europe (for 2071-2100) based on \nthe use of different RCMs nested within a Hadley Centre GCM (HadAM3H, except for \nthe Hadley RCM which is nested in HadAM3P). Control runs (for 1961-1990) are also \navailable. Some of these data (at a monthly time-step) are used to calculate both the \nPenman-Monteith and T-based monthly mean PE in this study. The data for each RCM \nare available on its native grid (different for each RCM), but also interpolated onto a \ncommon grid (of a similar resolution); that of the Climate Research Unit (the definition \nof the CRU grid, and details of the interpolation method, are available from \nhttp:\/\/prudence.dmi.dk). The interpolations onto the CRU grid have been used here, for \nease of comparison, and the SRES A2 emissions scenario has been used for all of the \nRCMs. The eight RCMs represented here are from the Met Office Hadley Centre \n(MOHC), DMI, ETH, GKSS, KNMI, MPI, SMHI and UCM (see Table 1). Deque et al. \n(2007) provide a brief description of each of these RCMs, with references for further \ndetail. The RCM of ICTP (Italy) could not be used due to lack of available wind speed \ndata. Where more than one run of the RCM is available (i.e. with different initial \nconditions), only the first run has been used here. \nTable 1 \n 7 \n \nFor the RCMs, Penman-Monteith PE is calculated as described in Section 2.1.1, \nincluding the values used for rs and G by MORECS. As summarised in Table 1, mean \nair temperature, Ta, and the 10 m wind speed, W10, are available for each of the RCMs \n(except that the scalar wind speed for the ETH RCM has to be calculated from the two \ndirectional wind speeds, as W10\n2\n=U10\n2\n+V10\n2\n) and the net solar radiation, Rn, can be \ncalculated as the sum of the net short wave and net long wave radiation. However, three \nof the RCMs (MOHC, UCM and KNMI) do not provide dew-point temperature, Td, so \nspecific humidity had to be used in the calculation of actual vapour pressure, ed.  \n \n2.3 Impact modelling \n \nIn order to investigate the effect that uncertainty in PE changes has on the modelled \nhydrological impacts of climate change, a continuous rainfall-runoff model was used to \nsimulate the effect on projected changes in high and low flows for three example \ncatchments in Britain. The catchment numbers (from the UK National River Flow \nArchive: www.ceh.ac.uk\/data\/nrfa\/) are 30004 (the Lymn at Partney Mill, in East \nAnglia), 42012 (the Anton at Fullerton, in southern England) and 96001 (the Halladale \nat Halladale, in northern Scotland). The catchments represent a range of catchment \ntypes, with varying rainfall regimes. Details of the catchments are given in Table 2 and \ntheir locations are shown on the map in Figure 2. \n \n2.3.1 Rainfall-runoff model \n \nThe rainfall-runoff model applied is the Probability Distributed Model (PDM) of Moore \n(1985, 2007). This is a relatively simple but flexible conceptual model (with a \nprobability-distributed soil moisture store feeding into fast and slow routing stores), \nwhich takes input time-series of catchment-averaged rainfall and PE and outputs time-\nseries of flow at the catchment outlet. The model has been widely applied in Britain and \nit forms part of the River Flow Forecasting System (Institute of Hydrology 1992). A \nrelatively parameter-sparse version of the model is applied here, with five catchment-\nspecific parameters, four of which require calibration (the fifth is set using soils data; \nsee Kay et al. (2007) for more detail). \n \nTwo of the three example catchments (30004 and 96001) have hourly catchment-\naverage rainfall data and corresponding hourly flow data (for January 1985 to December \n2001), so are calibrated and run with an hourly model time-step. The third catchment \n(42012) is calibrated and run with a daily model time-step, using daily catchment-\naverage rainfall and flow data (for January 1975 to December 1999). All three \ncatchments are calibrated with monthly catchment-average PE time-series data (equally \ndivided over the number of model time-steps in each month), where the monthly \ncatchment-average series are obtained from MORECS through simple areal-weighting \nof the series from all 40 x 40 km MORECS boxes covering the catchment.  \n \nFigure 2 \nTable 2 \n 8 \n2.3.2 Delta-change downscaling \n \nIn order to limit problems caused by any bias in climate model rainfall or PE (and to \nallow for the fact that the rainfall-runoff model is essentially calibrated for use with \nMORECS Penman-Monteith PE), the monthly changes in rainfall and PE suggested by \nthe climate models are applied, respectively, to baseline observed rainfall and MORECS \nPE time-series. This approach is often termed the delta-change method of downscaling, \nand has been applied in a number of previous climate change impact studies (e.g. \nReynard et al. 2001, Schreider et al. 2000, New et al. 2007). In its simplest form, the \ndelta-change method involves the application of monthly mean (percentage or absolute) \nchanges to each value in the baseline daily (or sub-daily) time-series. It is this form of \nthe method which is applied here, although more complex variations are possible (e.g. \nPrudhomme et al. 2002, Reynard et al. 2004). The great advantage of this method is the \nease with which alternative changes, suggested by different climate models, emissions \nscenarios etc., can be applied. A disadvantage is that it is limited by the ordering and \nvariability of events in the baseline series, as these remain essentially unchanged in the \nfuture series. However, it serves here to demonstrate the potential uncertainty \nintroduced by the PE calculation method. \n \n3. Performance for baseline PE \n \nThis section attempts to compare the (Penman-Monteith and T-based) PE estimates \nderived from climate model data with MORECS PE data, as this is essentially what the \nrainfall-runoff model is calibrated for use with. The comparison is done in terms of \nmonthly means (mm\/day) for regions covering North and South Britain, to look at the \nreproduction of the annual cycle in two different regions, and (for the RCMs) in terms \nof maps of mean annual totals, to look at the reproduction of spatial patterns. All \naveraging is done for the period 1961-1990. \n \nComparison of MORECS PE with PE derived from GCM data is not easy, due to the \nvery different resolution of the GCM grids (~300km over the UK) compared to that of \nMORECS (40 x 40 km). Comparison of MORECS PE with PE derived from RCMs is \neasier due to the similar resolutions of the data sets. As data for each of the eight \nPRUDENCE RCMs are available on a common (CRU) grid (see Section 2.2.2), the \nMORECS PE data have also been interpolated onto that grid (using straightforward \nareal-weighting, and allocating missing values to those CRU boxes where less than 80% \nof the area is covered by MORECS 40 x 40 km boxes). Boxes covering regions over \nNorth and South Britain have then been selected (Figure 3), and the MORECS monthly \nmean PE calculated for each of these regions is used as the basis for the comparison \nwith both GCM- and RCM-derived monthly mean PE.  \n \n3.1 Global Climate Models \n \nFor each GCM, the grid box whose centre is within, or closest to, each region (North \nand South Britain) has been chosen for comparison with the MORECS regional \nmonthly mean PE. Figure 3 shows the location of the grid box centres across the UK \nregion, for each of the five GCMs used here, and highlights those grid boxes used for \nthe comparison with MORECS PE (for the North and South regions shown by the \nFigure 3 \n 9 \nshaded areas on Figure 3). Comparisons are made between mean monthly PE \n(calculated as mm\/day) as well as mean annual PE (m), where the latter is calculated \nfrom the former using the true number of days in each month. This allows for the fact \nthat some GCMs work with 360-day years (12 months, each with 30 days). \n \nThe results (Figure 4) show that GCM Penman-Monteith PE is generally lower than \nMORECS PE for most, if not all, of the year, in both the North and South of Britain. \nThe exception is the CSIRO GCM, where Penman-Monteith PE is significantly higher \nthan MORECS PE for the whole year, over both regions. This means that the Penman-\nMonteith mean annual PE is higher than MORECS PE for the CSIRO GCM but lower \nthan MORECS PE for the other four GCMs. In contrast, the T-based mean annual PE \ntotals are closer to those of MORECS PE, as these are generally higher than MORECS \nPE in the summer but lower for the rest of the year. The T-based PE also tends to peak \nslightly later in the year than does MORECS PE. This monthly pattern of under\/over-\nestimation from T-based PE in comparison to MORECS PE seems to be due to the T-\nbased formulation, as the same was seen for T-based PE calculated from MORECS\u2019 \ntemperature data (Section 2.1.3). \n \nThe main factor affecting the performance of GCM-derived PE (compared to MORECS \nPE) is likely to be bias in the GCMs\u2019 reproduction of current climate. In particular, a \nmajor factor in the significant over-estimation of Penman-Monteith PE for the CSIRO \nGCM appears to be bias in minimum temperature (Tmin), which had to be used in place \nof dew-point temperature (Td) (see Section 2.2.1). In general the use of Tmin (from early \nmorning) instead of Td (as an average over the day) could cause problems over Britain, \nas the former would generally be lower than the latter in a relatively humid climate, thus \nthe actual vapour pressure ed calculated from Tmin is too low, hence PEPM is too high \ncompared to MORECS PE (which uses the mean of four vapour pressures measured \nthrough the day). However, in the case of the CSIRO GCM there seems to be a specific \nnegative bias in Tmin in autumn, winter and spring, in comparison with Tmin from other \nGCMs. This, together with an apparent positive bias in summer temperature, is probably \nthe cause of the over-estimation of Penman-Monteith PE throughout the year. \n \n3.2 Regional Climate Models \n \nFor each RCM, regional monthly means (mm\/day) are calculated over the same boxes \ncovering North and South Britain as used for calculating the MORECS regional \nmonthly mean PE, thus providing a more direct comparison than is possible for the \nGCMs. Also, mean annual PE (m) is calculated from mean monthly PE for each region, \nusing the true number of days in each month, to allow for the fact that all of these \nRCMs work with 360-day years and thus providing a fairer comparison against \nMORECS PE data. \n \nThe results (Figure 5) show that, as for the GCMs, RCM Penman-Monteith PE is \ngenerally lower than MORECS PE for most, if not all, of the year, for all eight RCMS, \nhence mean annual Penman-Monteith PE is lower than MORECS PE too. RCM T-\nbased PE is, again, higher than MORECS PE in the summer (with a slightly later peak), \nbut lower for the rest of the year (probably due to the T-based formulation, see Section \n2.1.3), so annual totals are closer to (but still always lower than) those of MORECS PE. \nFigure 4 \nFigure 5 \n 10 \nThis general underestimation of Penman-Monteith PE from RCM data is consistent with \nresults from Ekstrom et al. (2007), who derive their Penman-Monteith PE in a similar \nway but using data from the HadRM3H RCM and show significant underestimation \nover NW England, especially in summer, compared to PE derived from observational \ndata. \n \nFigure 6 shows maps of the gridded mean annual PE for each RCM and each PE type, \ncompared to interpolated MORECS PE (and to interpolated T-based PE derived from \nMORECS\u2019 temperature data). The results suggest that RCM T-based PE actually \nprovides a better representation of the general North-West to South-East gradient of \nannual PE across Britain than does RCM Penman-Monteith PE. However, it needs to be \nborne in mind that this is largely due to overestimation of PE in summer and \nunderestimation of PE for the rest of the year. For some of the RCMs (e.g. MOHC and \nDMI), the Penman-Monteith PE shows the greater spatial variability that is evident in \nthe MORECS PE, on top of the underlying gradient. That is, these maps are quite \n\u2018patchy\u2019, whereas such variability is not seen in the T-based PE (the maps of which \nhave very distinct bands across the country). Thus the variability is presumably due to \nthe other climate variables involved in the calculation of Penman-Monteith PE.  \n \nIt should be noted that the land-sea mask of the climate model can be important for PE, \nand much of the variation seen on the edges of the mapped areas for RCM PE is due to \nsome grid boxes being classified as sea rather than land in some RCMs. Such boxes are \nover-marked with smaller white squares on the maps in Figure 6, where the interpolated \nland-sea mask has been derived separately for each model, from its native land-sea \nmask, by the PRUDENCE team. The effect of this is particularly evident in the \nPenman-Monteith PE. \n \n4. Comparison of changes in PE \n \nThis section looks at the potential changes in PE under climate change (from the 1970s \nto the 2080s), in particular the differences in these changes when calculated using \nPenman-Monteith PE or T-based PE, for different GCMs and RCMs. \n \n4.1 Global Climate Models \n \nGraphs of the percentage change in each type of PE over North and South Britain, for \neach of the five GCMs, are shown in Figure 7. These show that the change in T-based \nPE is positive throughout the year, for each GCM, generally with larger percentage \nincreases in winter than in summer. In contrast, the changes in Penman-Monteith PE are \nsometimes negative for some GCMs, particularly for Northern Britain, usually with a \ngreater range of changes (minimum to maximum) across the year and with more month-\nto-month variability in the changes than is seen for T-based PE. This difference in \nchanges in T-based and Penman-Monteith PE is not unexpected, given that climate \nmodels suggest consistent increases in temperature over Northern Europe, and so \nincreases in T-based PE, but complex interactions between multiple variables lead to \nless clear-cut patterns of change in Penman-Monteith PE. \n \nFigure 6 \nFigure 7 \n 11 \nAll of the GCMs show annual increases in each type of PE, but the changes in Penman-\nMonteith PE are generally lower than those for T-based PE in the North (except for the \nECHAM4 GCM), whereas the opposite is often true of the changes in the South. The \nCSIRO GCM shows the smallest increase (for both PE types and both regions). \nHowever, there is more variation in the ordering of the rest of the GCMs for the two PE \ntypes. For instance, the ECHAM4 GCM shows the largest increase in Penman-Monteith \nPE (for both regions) whilst the CCSR GCM shows the largest increase in T-based PE \n(for both regions). The ordering of the GCMs with the T-based PE changes is \ncompletely consistent between the two regions.  \n \nNote that the calculation of percentage change in PE is sometimes difficult, mainly for \nwinter months, as the baseline PE can be (at or) near zero, potentially resulting in \npercentage increases that are very large. This affects the results for HadCM3 and \nECHAM4, where the plotted percentage increases have been capped at 100%. Also, the \nzero percentage changes shown for the winter months for CGCM2 are due to zero PE \nbeing calculated for both the current and future periods. \n \n4.2 Regional Climate Models \n \nGraphs of the percentage change in each type of PE over North and South Britain, for \neach of the eight RCMs, are shown in Figure 8. As for the GCMs, the change in T-\nbased PE is positive throughout the year, whilst the changes in Penman-Monteith PE are \nsometimes negative, and are generally much more variable across the year, with a \ngreater range of changes, than the T-based changes. All of the RCMs show annual \nincreases in PE, with the MOHC and UCM RCMs showing consistently larger increases \nthan the rest of the RCMs, for both regions and both PE types. There is much more \nvariation in the ordering of the rest of the RCMs between PE types and regions. \n \nFigure 9 shows maps of the gridded percentage change in mean annual PE, for each \nRCM and each PE type. Most of the maps show a general gradient of changes, with \nlarger increases in the south-east than in the north-west. The gradient is more \npronounced in the Penman-Monteith PE than in the T-based PE, with some grid boxes \nin the north-west even show decreases in mean annual Penman-Monteith PE for some \nRCMs. It is also clear from the maps that the MOHC and UCM RCMs are much more \nextreme in terms of changes in Penman-Monteith PE than the other RCMs. \n \n5. Impact uncertainty \n \nThis section looks at the additional uncertainty in the hydrological impacts of climate \nchange due to the use of different forms of PE in the hydrological modelling. As \ndescribed in Section 2.3.2, the monthly percentage changes for the two PE types are \napplied to the baseline time-series of MORECS PE, as the model is calibrated using the \nlatter and because this method avoids problems with bias in the climate model data (see \nbelow). Similarly, the monthly percentage changes in rainfall are applied to the baseline \nrainfall time-series so that, for a given climate model, the same changed rainfall series is \napplied with each of the two changed PE time-series. The differing impacts between \neach pair of results for a given climate model are therefore due to the differing PE input. \n \nFigure 8 \nFigure 9 \n 12 \nThe use of the delta change method in the hydrological impact modelling means that \nany bias in a climate model\u2019s reproduction of PE (and rainfall) does not matter directly, \nas it does not affect the water balance within the hydrological model. However, it does \nmatter indirectly, as the ability of a climate model to represent the current climate \naffects the confidence that can be given to its results under climate change. Thus the \nresults of Section 3 should be borne in mind here. \n \nThe impact is considered for the whole flow range \u2014 low, medium and high \u2014 for \nthree catchments in Britain (see details in Section 2.3). Note that the impacts are \ngenerally more consistent between the eight RCMs than they are between the five \nGCMs, as each of the RCMs is nested within (essentially) the same global atmospheric \nmodel (see Section 2.2.2). \n \n5.1 Impact on low to average flows \n \nFigure 10 shows the modelled annual and seasonal percentage changes in Q95 (the flow \nexceeded 95% of the time) for the three example catchments, using the changes in \nrainfall and (each type of) PE suggested by each of the five GCMs and eight RCMs. \nThe results suggest that the PE type used to define the changes in PE can make a \ndifference to the modelled impact on low flows, which may be quite significant in some \ncases. For instance, for the Scottish catchment (96001) the impact modelled using one \nPE type can be of the opposite sign to that using the alternative PE type for some \nclimate models (e.g. HadCM3, ECHAM4, DMI, KNMI) especially in winter (DJF) and \nfor GCMs. The same is true for the catchment in southern England (42012), although \nhere it is most noticeable in spring (MAM) and for RCMs. There can also be large \ndifferences in impact even where the two PE types result in the same sign of change. \nFor instance, for catchment 42012 using the ECHAM4 GCM, the modelled reduction in \nQ95 in each season using T-based PE is approximately one-half to two-thirds of that \nusing Penman-Monteith PE. Neither is there any obvious consistency between climate \nmodels, in terms of the impact modelled with the different PE types. For instance, for \nthe Anglian catchment (30004) using the UCM RCM, the impact on winter Q95 using \nthe T-based PE is about two-thirds of that using Penman-Monteith PE (approximately \n+40% vs +60%), whereas for the same catchment using the CCSR GCM the impact on \nwinter Q95 using the Penman-Monteith PE is about two-thirds of that using T-based PE \n(approximately +34% vs +50%). \n \nFigure 11 shows the modelled annual and seasonal percentage changes in the median \nflow (Q50) for the three example catchments, using the changes in rainfall and PE \nsuggested by each of the climate models. The results are similar to those for Q95, in that \nthere are cases where the modelled impacts have quite different values, sometimes even \nof a different sign, depending on which PE type is used, and there is no obvious \nconsistency in the differences by PE type for different climate models. \n \n5.2 Impact on high flows \n \nFigure 12 shows the modelled annual and seasonal percentage changes in Q5 (the flow \nexceeded 5% of the time) for the three example catchments, using the changes in \nrainfall and PE suggested by each of the climate models. The results in this case are \nFigure 10 \nFigure 11 \nFigure 12 \n 13 \nagain similar to those for Q95 and Q50, although there are fewer cases where the \ndifferent types of PE result in opposite-signed changes in Q5. However, the differences \ncould still be important, particularly, it seems, for the catchment in southern England \n(42012). Here, for almost all of the RCMs, the use of T-based PE results in larger \nincreases (in some cases by 100% or more) in annual (and winter and spring) Q5 than \ndoes the use of Penman-Monteith PE. This is also relatively consistent with the results \nfor the HadCM3 GCM, which is the coupled version of the global model that the \nPRUDENCE RCMs are nested within. Also for this catchment, using the ECHAM4 \nGCM with Penman-Monteith PE suggests a reduction in winter Q5 of about 30% \nwhereas using T-based PE suggests an increase of about 7%. \n \nFigure 13 shows the modelled percentage changes in flood peaks at five return periods \n(2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 years) for the three example catchments, using the changes in \nrainfall and PE suggested by each of the climate models. In general, these results follow \nthe patterns seen for changes in winter Q5 (Figure 12), which is unsurprising as winter \nis the main flood season in the UK (Bayliss and Jones 1993). Thus here, again, the \neffect of using T-based as against Penman-Monteith PE seems to be particularly evident \nfor the catchment in southern England, with the use of T-based PE resulting in larger \nchanges at each return period than does Penman-Monteith PE, for most of the RCMs, \nand with the ECHAM4 GCM giving increases in flood peaks at most return periods \nwhen using T-based PE, but decreases at most return periods when using Penman-\nMonteith PE. Note that the results for the 50-year return period require some \nextrapolation of the fitted flood frequency curve, and so involve much more uncertainty \nthan the results for the lower return periods. \n \n6. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThis paper has applied two very different formulations to derive PE for a set of climate \nmodels; one method which is data-intensive (needing temperature, humidity, radiation \nand wind speed data) but more physically-based (Penman-Monteith) and one which is \nsimpler but more empirical, needing only temperature data (T-based). Surprisingly, a \ncomparison with MORECS PE (a gridded dataset derived by the UK Met Office from \nweather observations, using a modified Penman-Monteith formulation) over Britain \nshowed that using the T-based method with climate model data for the period 1961-\n1990 generally gave a better fit than applying the Penman-Monteith formulation. The \ntwo methods also give very different changes in PE when applied to climate model data \nfor the period 2071-2100 (under the A2 emissions scenario), and this can, potentially, \nhave a large effect on the subsequent modelled hydrological impacts of climate change.  \n \nIt is perhaps not surprising that this affect is most noticeable for modelled low, or even \nmedian, flows, but it is perhaps surprising how large an effect this can have even for a \nfast-responding catchment in Scotland. As far as high flows are concerned, it would be \nexpected for catchments in the south and east of England to be most affected by the \ndiffering changes in PE, as such catchments lose a higher proportion of their rainfall \nthrough evaporation (and receive less rainfall) than catchments to the north or west of \nBritain. They also tend to have deeper soils, so can build up larger soil moisture deficits. \nIn particular, catchments with a high baseflow index, such as 42012, are worse affected, \ndue to their even greater water storage capacity and thus longer hydrological \u2018memory\u2019. \nFigure 13 \n 14 \n \nIn general, the results suggest that the hydrological impact uncertainty due to PE \nformulation is less than that due to GCM structure, or even RCM structure. Thus the \nmain aim for the impact modeller should probably still be to apply as many climate \nmodels as possible. However, some combinations of PE type and climate model do still \nlead to individual impacts outside the range of results given by the alternative PE type \nwith the whole set of climate models applied here. For instance, for catchment 30004, \nthe impact on winter Q95 with Penman-Monteith PE and the UCM RCM is larger than \nthat with T-based PE for any climate model applied. Neither is it possible to say with \nany certainty what effect the use of an alternative form of PE will be, given the impacts \nresulting from the use of one type of PE, as there is no obvious pattern that can be \napplied. Thus the possibility of a quite different set of impacts, if an alternative form of \nPE is applied, must be borne in mind.  \n \nThe problem is further complicated by the fact that T-based PE performed better than \nPenman-Monteith in a comparison for the current climate, even though Penman-\nMonteith PE is more physically-based. This is probably due to reliability issues with \nsome of the other variables required for the calculation of Penman-Monteith PE, when \nthese are produced by climate models; such problems are clearly lessened when only \ntemperature data are required. Ekstrom et al. (2007) discuss suspected problems with \nthe PE derived from HadRM3H climate model data using the Penman-Monteith \nformulation, for their modelling over NW England and the Rhine basin, and describe \nsite-specific methodologies applied to avoid these. Of course, many more PE \nformulations exist than the two applied for this paper, and other methods, perhaps \nintermediate in complexity to these two, should probably be tested on climate model \ndata, but the T-based formulation applied here is one of the simplest and seems to \nperform well, at least for annual totals over Britain (although the tendency towards \noverestimation in summer and underestimation for the rest of the year could be a \nproblem from some applications). \n \nThe impact modeller thus has to make a pragmatic choice, preferably including as many \nclimate models as possible and estimating PE for each climate model in a consistent \nway. Consideration of the particular impact being modelled and of the circumstances \nunder which it may be especially affected by differences in PE, perhaps including a \nsensitivity study, may help the modeller to decide on the best course of action. \n \nAcknowledgements \nGCM data were obtained from the IPCC data distribution centre (http:\/\/ipcc-\nddc.cru.uea.ac.uk).
