INTRODUCTION \n \nCognitive and practice-based theories have informed two influential strands of the \nliterature on organisational knowledge and learning.  There has generally not been a \ngreat deal of exchange between these two traditions, unless it is to be critical of the \nother.  Practice-based approaches have been especially dismissive of cognitive \napproaches (e.g. Cook and Yanow, 1993; Gherardi, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006; Gherardi \nand Nicolini, 2002; Lave and Wenger, 1991; Nicolini et al., 2003; Orlikowski, 2000, \n2002; Suchman, 1988).  However, in this paper it is argued that there is actually much \nto be gained from establishing a more productive dialogue between the two \nperspectives.  As with many attempts at fusing insights from multiple theoretical \npositions, there are potential dangers that need to be taken into account.  This is \nparticularly the case where the perspectives in question are derived from quite distinct \n                                                 \n1 Corresponding author: Dr Nick Marshall, Centre for Research in Innovation \nManagement, University of Brighton, The Freeman Centre (University of Sussex \ncampus), Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9QE, United Kingdom, tel. +44 (0)1273 877 937, fax. \n+44 (0)1273 877 977, email nick.marshall@brighton.ac.uk \n 2 \nontological and epistemological positions and grounded in radically different sets of \nguiding assumptions.  Bearing these obstacles in mind, my argument in this paper is two \nfold. \n \nThe first part of the argument is to suggest that practice-based theories have been, at \nleast partly, justifiable in their criticisms of conventional cognitive approaches, but that \nthis in itself is not a reason to dismiss any cognitive accounts of organisational \nknowledge and learning.  Gherardi (2006, p. xv) has argued that cognitive approaches \nsuggest \u201cthat knowledge resides in the heads of persons, and that it is appropriated, \ntransmitted and stored by means of mentalistic processes.  This figure works through the \ndichotomies of mind\/body, thought\/action, individual\/organization.  Its watchword is \n\u2018organizational learning\u2019, and also \u2018cognitive framework\u2019 or \u2018traditional cognitive \nlearning theory\u2019\u201d.  To a large degree this argument is quite valid.  To the extent that \ncognitive approaches have drawn on models of information processing, it is true that \nthey tend towards a rather static, functionalist, and ultimately individualistic portrayal of \nlearning as the passive acquisition of knowledge.  Practice-based theories, by contrast, \nemphasise the dynamic, processual, and inescapably social and material character of \nknowing.  Cognition is not something that primarily takes place \u2018in the head\u2019 through \nthe cold and dispassionate mental operations of individual cognitive agents that are \nsomehow detached from the world of activity in which they must necessarily be \nembedded (Lave, 1988).  The information processing tradition underlying cognitive \napproaches also tends towards portraying knowledge in rationalistic (albeit boundedly \nrational) and representational terms (c.f. Rorty, 1979; Wingrad and Flores, 1986).  In \nopposition to this, practice-based theories adopt a more holistic, constructionist position \nin which the various elements of thinking, doing, and being, and the social, cultural, \nhistorical, and material settings within which they take place are conceived in \nrelationships of co-constitution. \n \nFrom the above characterisation of cognitive approaches it would seem that they have \nlittle in common with practice-based theories and that a rapprochement between the two \nwould be surprising, if not downright ill-advised.  However, there are times when the \nportrayal of the former by the latter often verges on caricature, not really acknowledging \nthe changes that have been happening within the cognitive literature that addresses some \nof the criticisms raised (see Schwartz, 1998, for an overview).  Consequently, the \nsecond element of my argument is to suggest that by being excessively wary of \ninvoking any cognitive explanations, practice-based approaches are actually placing an \nunnecessary limitation on themselves.  The main point is that acknowledging a \ncognitive dimension to knowing does not have to be incompatible with a socially \nsituated, constructionist, and processual view.  Practice-based approaches make frequent \nmention of the enduring and patterned character of social action, often drawing on \ninsights from sociological accounts of practice (e.g. Bourdieu, 1977, 1992; Giddens, \n1979, 1984).  A key issue here is not only about how practices are reproduced over \ntime, but also how they are modified and transformed as they are enacted or \n\u2018instantiated\u2019.  Informed by work on cognitive sociology, I argue that individual and \ncollective cognitive frameworks or schemata play a central and dynamic role here \n(Cicourel, 1973, 1981; Zerubavel, 1999).  It is not necessary to see schemata in purely \ncomputational terms as providing the algorithms and transformation rules that mediate \nbetween the input and output elements of information processes.  They can be \nconceptualised in much broader and less mechanistic terms as providing the, often \nimplicit, unarticulated, and shifting background upon which knowledge and action are \ngrounded.  The emphasis here shifts from the rule-based processing of information as \nrepresentations of reality, to the role of interpretative schemas in guiding how unfolding \n 3 \nsocial realities are constituted through processes of enactive sensemaking (Weick, 1979, \n1995).  Schemata provide the crucial link between past, present, and future that permit \nboth the reproducibility and transformational capacity of practices, allowing genuine \nagency without voluntarism and regularities of action without determinism. \n \nAs well as the conceptual challenges of merging insights from two hitherto quite \nseparate, and one might even say antagonistic fields, there are also important \nmethodological issues.  Here as well there are important differences between the two \ntraditions which, again, have tended, prematurely I would suggest, to be depicted as \nirreconcilable.  Influenced by approaches such as ethnomethodology, practice-based \ntheories tend to assume that the situated intelligibility of practices can mainly be \ngrasped through observation.  This is because, as Gherardi (2006, p. 30) has argued, \n\u201cactions speak for themselves\u201d since they \u201c\u2018reflexively\u2019 display their nature as \nmeaningful to social actors\u201d and so permit the reconstruction of their meaning by \nexternal observers.  Cognitive approaches, by contrast, have tended to depend more on \neliciting the structure, content, and processes of cognition through techniques requiring \nparticipants to provide a more or less direct account of their perspectives and actions, as \nwell as a heavy reliance on experimental and simulation studies.  Certainly many of \nthese techniques have been applied in a positivistic fashion that tends to reinforce the \nproblems of static, individualistic, and reductionist arguments for which cognitive \napproaches have been rightly criticised (Greeno, 1998).  However, it is by no means \ninevitable that one has to subscribe to a positivist programme in seeking to elicit the \nnature of individual and collective cognition, just as one does not necessarily have to \nrely wholly on attempting to infer the meaning of practices from observation. \n \nTo illustrate how the conceptual and methodological task of combining practice-based \nand cognitive approaches might be achieved, the second half of the paper offers an \nexample drawn from research currently being conducted by the author into knowledge, \nlearning, and communication in multi-functional engineering teams.  This study is \npursuing a multi-method approach that involves not only observing teams in action \nthrough ethnographic research, but also using other techniques drawn from studies of \ncognition for mapping individual and shared schemas, which have been applied \nparticularly in the areas of organisational strategy and team dynamics (e.g. Cooke et al., \n2000; Hodgkinson, 2005; Huff, 1990; Langan-Fox et al., 2000; Porac and Thomas, \n1990).  One aim is to explore the possibilities and limitations of using techniques from \ncognitive approaches in a more action-orientated and socially situated manner than has \noften been the case previously.  The focus is on considering the intricate interplay \nbetween individual and group schemata as dynamic, context-dependent, and embodied \nrepresentations that are variably constructed, drawn upon, and revised in the course of \nthe day-to-day communicative and other practices of teams of consulting engineers. \n \n \n2. COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO ORGANISATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND \nLEARNING \n \nAs several authors have observed, cognitive approaches form one of the most influential \nstrands of the literature on organisational knowledge and learning.  Swan et al. (1999), \nfor example, distinguish between cognitive and community models of organisational \nknowledge.  The former, as S\u00f8rensen and Lundh-Snis (2001, p. 85) explain, \u201cdenotes a \nperspective where valuable knowledge is conceived as being captured and codified from \nindividuals, packaged, transmitted and processed through the use of ICT, and hence \ndisseminated and used by other individuals in new contexts.  In this perspective, \n 4 \nknowledge can also be exploited through the recycling of existing knowledge \u2018owned\u2019 \nand \u2018experienced\u2019 by individuals in cognitive networks\u201d.  The community model, which \nholds much in common with practice-based theories, by contrast \u201cportrays the \nmanagement of knowledge as socially constructed through interaction within \ncommunities of practice \u2026 Knowledge creation and learning are processes of making \nsense of knowledge in social activities deeply rooted in daily work practice\u201d (ibid., p. \n85).  Other similar characterisations of the organisational knowledge literature include \nthe distinction drawn by Cook and Brown (1999) between epistemologies of possession \nand practice, and that by Gherardi (2000) between mentalist or functionalist \nperspectives and practice-based theorising.  Despite differences in terminology, these \ncharacterisations all refer to one set of approaches to organisational knowledge and \nlearning that are strongly informed by ideas drawn from conventional cognitive \npsychology, itself dominantly based on an information processing view of cognition \n(e.g. Anderson, 1983, Broadbent, 1958, Bruner et al., 1956, Fiske and Taylor, 1984, \nMcClelland et al., 1987, Miller, 1956, Neisser, 1967, Newell & Simon, 1972).  While \ninformation processing has proven to be a useful metaphor for processes of \norganisational knowledge and learning, contributing numerous valuable insights, it also \nbrings with it some theoretical baggage that ultimately limits its usefulness.   \n \nThere are three key limitations of orthodox views of cognition that impact upon \ncognitive approaches to organisational knowledge.  These are, firstly, the \nrepresentationalist tendencies of the information processing perspective; secondly, an \nindividualistic and mentalist emphasis that limits attempts to arrive at a genuinely social \nunderstanding of organisational knowledge; and thirdly, at least in some segments of the \nliterature, a focus on simulated or experimental settings in seeking empirical support, \nrather than investigating what have been called \u2018intact activity systems\u2019 (Greeno, 1998). \n \n \n2.1 Information Processing and Representationalism \n \nOne of the key elements of the information processing perspective is the positing of pre-\nexisting cognitive structures that guide perception and provide an important heuristic \nfunction in people\u2019s information processing strategies.  Such structures have been \nvariously referred to as frames (Minsky, 1975; Mitchell, 1986), scripts (Abelson, 1981; \nSchank and Abelson, 1977), schemata (Moussavi and Evans, 1993; Rummelhart, 1984), \ncategories (Rosch, 1978), personal constructs (Kelly, 1955), cognitive maps (Tolman, \n1948), and mental models (Gentner and Stevens, 1983; Johnson-Laird, 1983).  Taking \nthe form of simplified \u201cinternal working models of the world\u201d (Badke-Schaub et al., \n2007, p. 7), these cognitive frameworks are seen as economising devices allowing \npredictions to be made about likely future states of affairs and channelling the \nassimilation of new information without undue cognitive effort (Craik, 1943; Johnson-\nLaird, 1983).  In this sense, people are depicted as \u2018cognitive misers\u2019, relying on \nestablished frameworks, models, or schemata to economise on the use of limited \ncognitive and attentional resources (Fiske and Taylor, 1984).  This in itself is not \nproblematic as a considerable volume of research has supported the existence of \nheuristics of various forms (e.g. Gilovich et al., 2002; Kahneman et al., 1982).  \nHowever, difficulties arise when, as in the cognitive literature on organisational \nknowledge and learning, heuristics are conceived primarily as having a representational \nrole, intended to mirror more or less faithfully, albeit in synoptic form, various \nphenomena \u2018out there\u2019 in the world (c.f. Rorty, 1979).  Winograd and Flores (1986, p. \n73) have summarised the key features of information processing approaches in the \nfollowing terms: \n 5 \n \nAt its simplest, the rationalistic view accepts the existence of an objective \nreality, made up of things bearing properties and entering into relations.  A \ncognitive being \u2018gathers information\u2019 about those things and builds up a \u2018mental \nmodel\u2019 which will be in some respects correct (a faithful representation of \nreality) and in other respects incorrect.  Knowledge is a storehouse of \nrepresentations, which will be called upon for use in reasoning and which can be \ntranslated into language.  Thinking is a process of manipulating representations. \n \nThe problem with representationalism is that it relies on a series of excessively strict \ndualisms between mind and body, thought and reality, individual and environment.  As \nDescombe (2001) has argued, the understanding of mental acts needs to be broadened \nout to embrace not only the states of mind of individual brains that appear as somehow \ndetached from the world, and instead to emphasise the actively engaged, embodied, \ncollective, culturally- and historically specific character of knowing.  It is arguably also \nthe case that a representationalist view tends to prioritise structure over process and \nstatics over dynamics.  As a consequence there has been less attention paid to how \nindividual or organisational schemata are formed, reproduced, modified, or overturned \nover time, or how malleable they are depending on the alternative contexts and social \nsettings within which they are drawn upon and performed (c.f. Goffman, 1959). \n \n \n2.2 Cognitivism and the Social Character of Knowing \n \nThe second limitation of the cognitive tradition concerns the individualistic and \nmentalistic way in which knowing and acting are depicted (Norman, 1993; Schwartz, \n1998).  It may seem counter-intuitive that a body of work purporting to deal with the \nthoroughly social phenomena of organisational knowledge and learning could exhibit an \nindividualistic bias, but this is evident in one of two tendencies in the literature.  The \nfirst, which sidesteps the issue of how social coordination is actually accomplished, \nsimply treats organisations as if they are individual actors and draws analogies between \nindividual and organisational cognition.  This style of argument can regularly be found \nin much of the writing on the economics of organisational knowledge and capabilities \n(e.g. Grant, 1996; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Teece et al., 1997; Winter, 1987).  Here the \norganisation is often reified as a unitary actor, based on the problematic assumption of \nan equivalence between individual and organisational cognition.  The second, which is \nequally flawed, treats organisational cognition as a straightforward aggregate of the \nindividual cognitions of its members.  This approach can be found in the earlier IT \nfocused writing on knowledge management that portrayed organisations as a collection \nof atomised individuals possessing different types of knowledge (e.g. Croy et al., 1997; \nGore and Gore, 1999; Sher and Lee, 2004).  The challenge, which according to this \nview can be met through the widespread deployment of IT systems, is to connect up \nthese different individuals, allowing knowledge to flow to where it is needed and \nallowing for \u201ca vast treasure house of knowledge, know-how and best practices\u201d to be \nexploited rather than remaining untapped (O\u2019Dell and Grayson, 1988, p. 154).  As Swan \net al. (1999, p. 273) suggest, \u201c[c]ognitive, IT-led approaches to KM typically fail to take \ninto account the pre-existing organizational structures, norms and cultural values that \nlead different groups to have divergent, possibly even irreconcilable, interpretations of \nwhat needs to be done and how best to do it.  They unrealistically assume that building \nnetworks that provide structural links between these different groups will somehow \nautomatically produce knowledge creation and sharing\u201d.  Neither of the above \napproaches is able to depict the socially and materially situated character of cognition as \n 6 \na dynamic and relational process that is not something that purely goes on \u2018in the heads\u2019 \nof individuals, nor is a wholly collective phenomenon where the individual is \neffectively submerged within an ostensibly coherent and seamless collective agency. \n \n \n2.3 Positivism and the Experimental Approach \n \nA final limitation of orthodox cognitive psychology that has been imported into the \nliterature on organisational knowledge and learning, more strongly in some quarters \nthan others, concerns a positivist orientation towards collecting and analysing empirical \nevidence.  This tends to reinforce the pronounced individualistic, static, and \nfunctionalist perspective already evident in the way that organisational knowledge and \nlearning are conceptualised by cognitive approaches.  This is particularly evident in \nthose approaches that have adopted the same emphasis on experimental and simulation-\nbased methods as the cognitive psychology literature from which they draw inspiration.  \nWhile not denying the potential usefulness of such techniques, it is also crucial to \nacknowledge their limitations.  Arguably their greatest strength is also their biggest \nweakness.  Experimental and simulation studies are able to provide settings in which \nvariables can be controlled and manipulated to allow the researcher to focus on the role \nof those that are hypothesised to be of relevance.  However, the ability to manipulate \nexperimental settings often comes at the cost of simplification and abstraction.  This \nmeans that they are typically limited in their ability to emulate the messy complexity of \n\u2018intact activity systems\u2019 (Greeno, 1998) or cognition \u2018in the wild\u2019 (Hutchins, 1995).   \n \nEver more sophisticated experimental designs can ameliorate the problems of \nsimplification and abstraction, but there are more inescapable features of such \napproaches that make them less suited for investigating the dynamic, unfolding, \nsituated, context-dependent, and complexly interconnected processes of knowing and \nlearning in practice.  The main problem is that such approaches tend towards \nreductionism in assuming that organisational cognition can best be understood by \nsubdividing it into simpler components, factors, or variables that can then be \nreassembled to form a complex whole.  The aim of experimental approaches is to \nmanipulate conditions so as to isolate one or a few features of interest.  For some, this is \nnot considered problematic, either because there is thought to be a sufficient degree of \nresemblance between the experimental setting and non-artificial situations despite the \ndecomposition and separation of \u2018factors\u2019; or alternatively features of the real world are \nsimply not seen to be relevant to the phenomena being studied.  For example, Vera and \nSimon (1993, pp. 42-43) argue that for \u201cmany purposes of cognitive simulation, it is of \nno special significance that thought is social.  So long as a system is provided with a \nknowledge base that corresponds with the relevant knowledge possessed by the person \nwho is being simulated, one need not be concerned with the original source of that \nknowledge\u201d.  However, others remain unconvinced by these arguments.  For instance, \nGreeno (1998, p. 7) has observed that \u201c[e]xperimental conditions are arranged to \nprovide information about one of the processes of perception, comprehension, memory, \ninference, or judgement, assuming that the influence of other processes can be neglected \nin drawing conclusions about the process that the experiment was designed to \ninvestigate\u201d.   \n \nThe problem is that by isolating factors, treating them as discrete and independent \nvariables to be manipulated under experimental conditions, almost invariably \nencourages them to be hypostatised.  At worst this means that actors (whether individual \nor organisational) are themselves treated as bundles of individual characteristics, the \n 7 \npresence or absence of which in different combinations, and given alternative \nenvironmental conditions and stimuli, together influence behaviour.  Although it is not \nlogically necessary for such studies, once organisations, individuals, and situations are \nreduced to a series of component parts, the emphasis is typically a narrowly functional \none, investigating the effects and outcomes of these characteristics rather than \nconsidering how such features are constituted or how they change and evolve.  The \nindividual characteristics and traits of cognitive agents come across as static attributes \nrather than actively and historically constituted elements.  Another tendency that seems \nto follow from such atomistic thinking is that of treating actors and the settings within \nwhich they act and interact in strongly dualistic terms, with contexts or environments \nforming a passive and container-like backdrop to organisational action. \n \n \n3. PRACTICE-BASED APPROACHES TO ORGANISATIONAL KNOWLEDGE \nAND LEARNING \n \nHaving looked at some of the main features and limitations of the cognitive tradition in \nthe literature on organisational knowledge and learning, I would now like the consider \nthe key benefits, but also disadvantages and omissions, of practice-based approaches.  \nAlthough the latter are keen to distance themselves from cognitive explanations, I \nnevertheless argue that the two approaches are by no means as incompatible as is often \nclaimed and that a fruitful dialogue could and should be established between them.  The \nstrength of practice-based approaches is that they strive to offer a holistic understanding \nof knowing and learning as dynamic, emergent, social accomplishments that are \nactively situated within specific contexts of practice.  Consequently, they are able to \ncounter some of the tendencies observed above in cognitive approaches towards \ndepicting knowledge and learning in static, dualistic, internalised, and ultimately \nindividualised terms.  According to Lave and Wenger (1991, pp. 50-51) \u201ca theory of \nsocial practice emphasizes the relational interdependency of agent and world, activity, \nmeaning, cognition, learning, and knowing.  It emphasizes the inherently socially \nnegotiated character of meaning, and the interested, concerned character of the thought \nand action of persons-in-activity\u201d.  Similarly, Gherardi (2001, p. 134) has argued that \n\u201cwhen the locus of knowledge and learning is situated in practice, the focus moves to a \nsocial theory of action that addresses activity and passivity, the cognitive and the \nemotional, mental and sensory perception as bits and pieces of the social construction of \nknowledge and of the social worlds in which practices assume meanings and facticity\u201d.  \nThus, a crucial feature of these approaches is a shift in focus from \u2018cognition in the \nhead\u2019 to \u2018cognition in practice\u2019 (Lave, 1988). \n \nThe emphasis is on the socially constituted, indeterminate, revisable, and negotiated \ncharacter of knowledge.  This is in contrast to representationalist approaches that \nbelieve in the possibility of a mirror-like correspondence between external, independent \nphenomena and the mental structures and language used to represent them.  Practice-\nbased approaches are deeply critical of this, presenting instead a relational and process-\norientated view of the mutually constitutive nature of social phenomena which makes it \nmeaningless to speak of them independently.  As Lave and Wenger (1991, p. 51) put it, \n\u201cthe socially and culturally structured world \u2026 is socially constituted; objective forms \nand systems of activity, on the one hand, and agents\u2019 subjective and intersubjective \nunderstandings of them, on the other, constitute both the world and its experienced \nforms\u201d.  It is from recognising the mutually constituted character of knowledge and \npractice that questions of context, situation, and setting come to the fore.  This is \nbecause at \u201cissue here is not knowledge as a self-standing body of propositions but \n 8 \nidentities and modes of action established through ongoing, specifically situated \nmoments of lived work, located in and accountable to particular historical, discursive \nand material circumstances\u201d (Suchman, 2000, pp. 312-313).  Once again there are \nimportant differences here with the cognitive approaches outline above which tend to \ntreat the context or setting of organisational actions as a static, container-like backdrop.  \nPractice-based approaches conceptualise context not simply as a container within which \nactivities occur, but as crucially enacted whereby its elements are simultaneously \ninfluence on, medium, and outcome of social activity. \n \nOne of the key advantages of practice-based approaches is that they seek to provide a \nhistorically situated account of practices, acknowledging that they follow complex and \nsometimes contradictory trajectories.  This is in opposition to some branches of the \ncognitive tradition that appear to portray organisational knowledge and learning as \ndriven by universal and immutable tendencies, and thus as effectively ahistorical.  \nHowever, I would argue that the anti-cognitive bias in practice-based approaches is both \nunnecessary and ultimately limiting.  One does not have to abandon any reference to \ncognition in order to avoid those pitfalls of cognitive approaches that practice-based \ntheory so eloquently highlights.  Indeed, by being excessively reticent to speak of \ncognitive processes, practice-based approaches have closed down a fruitful avenue of \ninvestigation that may offer a more detailed understanding of how practices are \nconstituted, reproduced, and transformed than they have so far been able to offer.  \nAlthough there are those who doubt the potential of integrating sociological styles of \ninterpretation - which practice-based theories typically draw upon - with cognitive \napproaches (e.g. Woolgar, 1995), there have nevertheless been some that have been \nworking towards precisely such a rapprochement (e.g. Cicourel, 1973, 1981; Greeno, \n1998; Zerubavel, 1999).  There are a few practice-based theorists who have taken steps \nin this direction, notably the work of Orlikowski and Gash (1994) on technological \nframes, but such attempts have generally been few and far between. \n \nIt is worth acknowledging that the practice-based critique of cognitive approaches is \nperhaps rather ingenuous, based as it is upon something of a caricature of the latter.  \nCertainly by using the rhetorical device of setting themselves up in opposition to \n\u2018conventional\u2019 or \u2018traditional\u2019 cognitive theories, practice-based theories are able to \nmake their arguments stronger and more distinctive.  There is, however, a question mark \nover whether the rhetorical benefits of a thoroughgoing rejection of cognitive \napproaches does not come at the expense of ignoring any useful insights from this body \nof work at all.  Practice-based approaches are reticent about making reference to \npatterns, frameworks, or models of thinking, collective or otherwise, for fear of veering \ntowards representationalism and mentalism (e.g. Gherardi, 2006; Lave and Wenger, \n1991).  However, one does not have to accept a representational or mentalist position to \ndraw conceptual benefit from the notion that patterns of collective activity are, to some \nextent at least, enabled and guided by interlocking cognitive schemas that are, to a \ngreater or lesser degree, generated, reproduced, and modified by people participating in \njoint activities.  Indeed, there is much to be gained for practice-based approaches in \ntaking on board ideas from social cognition because it is arguably in the study of the \ninterplay between individual and socially overlapping knowledge frameworks that \nimportant steps can be taken towards understanding the different circumstances under \nwhich practices are reproduced or transformed.  In opposition to the representationalist \ntendencies of the information processing view, taking such an interpretative perspective \non cognition connects much more closely with many of the traditions from which \npractice-based theory draws, including pragmatism, phenomenology, symbolic \ninteractionism, and social constructionism.  As such, it offers an appropriate route for \n 9 \npursuing a rapprochement between practice-based and cognitive approaches.  Instead of \nviewing cognition in terms of the rule-based processing of information as \nrepresentations of reality, the emphasis shifts to the role of interpretative schemas in \nguiding how unfolding social realities are constituted and enacted.  Schemata provide \nthe crucial link between past, present, and future in these processes, permitting practices \nto be reproduced but also potentially transformed, and thus allowing genuine agency \nwithout voluntarism and regularities of action without determinism.  The next section \nconsiders some of the theoretical possibilities and challenges of integrating cognitive \nand practice-based approaches. \n \n \n4. COGNITION IN PRACTICE: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION \n \nFortunately, the theoretical foundations upon which practice-based theories of \norganisational knowledge and learning stand provide a solid starting point from which \nto develop a more socially and historically situated understanding of cognition.  \nPractice-based approaches are often themselves inspired by a sociology of practice (e.g. \nBourdieu, 1977, 1990; Garfinkel, 1967; Giddens, 1979, 1984), and contributions such as \nthese have been rather less reticent to invoke cognitive processes, even if they do not \nfully elaborate how they fit into their explanatory frameworks.  For example, Giddens \n(1979, 1984) emphasises the knowledgeability of actors, highlighting the need for a \nknowledge of the rules, conscious or otherwise, to make people capable of action (c.f. \nSewell, 1992).  Structuration theory makes reference to memory traces and pre-existing \ninterpretative schemes as carriers that permit the reproducibility of practice.  However, \nit is not always clear the precise role these play and whether they can be conceptualised \nas having a cognitive dimension.  There are some who are unwilling to concede the \npossibility of recurrent practices, or scripts, being guided by cognitive frameworks.  For \nexample, Barley and Tolbert (1997, p. 98, emphasis in the original) have argued that \u201cit \nis empirically more fruitful to view scripts as behavioural regularities instead of mental \nmodels or plans.  From this perspective, scripts are observable, recurrent activities and \npatterns of interaction characteristic of a particular setting\u201d.  However, this does not \naddress how such patterns are actually formed and reproduced and it is here that I would \nsuggest socially shared cognitions play a crucial part in guiding practices.  To claim the \nrelevance of cognitive frameworks for reproducing social practices is in no way \ninconsistent with the crucial argument that such frameworks for knowing are embodied, \ninhere in, and are variably distributed across, specific social and material settings in \nwhich practices are actively situated.  To talk about schemata, mental models, and so \non, does not have to conjure up images of knowing as taking place solely \u2018in-the-head\u2019.  \nHowever, this does not mean that one has to deny any role for knowing-in-the-head for \nfear of mentalism.  This is providing, of course, that one does not make the mistake of \ndepicting cognition entirely as an individual, internalised, rational, impassive, and \ndispassionate activity. \n \nMoreover, there are lessons from social cognition, in terms of the interplay between \nindividual and collective knowledge and between automatic and active modes of \ncognition that can begin to address some of the key problems that a sociology of \npractice has been attempting to solve, arguably without total success (e.g. Louis and \nSutton, 1991; Schwarz, 1998).  One of the most difficult of these is the question of how, \nonce rules or patterns of recurrent action are established and effectively reproduced, \nthey can be modified and transformed.  Contributions to a sociology of practice have \ntended to focus more on the conditions underlying the reproducibility of practice than \nits transformation.  This is probably most evident in the work of Bourdieu (1977, 1990) \n 10 \nwhere practice is depicted as taking place within a particular habitus.  The latter is \ndefined as \u201can acquired system of generative schemes objectively adjusted to the \nparticular conditions in which it is constituted \u2026 engender[ing] all the thoughts, all the \nperceptions, and all the actions consistent with those conditions, and no others\u201d \n(Bourdieu, 1977, p. 95).  Given such a conceptualisation it is difficult to see how \ntransformations are possible if the grip of the habitus is so all-embracing and pervasive.   \n \nOther work that has informed a sociology of practice, such as ethnomethodology, has \nbeen more open to the twin character of social practices as offering both the potential \nfor routinisation and transformation.  While not denying that large elements of action, \nparticularly in organisational settings, are routinised, relatively unreflexive, and \ngrounded in taken-for-granted assumptions, this does not mean that the totality of \nbehaviour is entirely automatic and habitual.  People are not \u2018cultural dopes\u2019, simply \nacting out established norms and patterns of behaviour (Garfinkel, 1967).  Certainly, as \nGarfinkel\u2019s so-called \u2018breaching experiments\u2019 clearly demonstrated, there is a \nconsiderable amount of \u2018work\u2019 and implicit background knowledge that goes into \nsustaining even the most trivial of everyday activities that only comes to the surface \nwhen there is a breakdown, in the case of these experiments by purposefully breaching \nthe expected rules of conduct.  However, this does not mean that social action is entirely \nand unchangingly rule-bound in the sense that there is no escape from collectively \nsanctioned norms of conduct.  For Garfinkel (1967), the potential for improvisation and \nautonomous action comes from the very fact that social rules have to be actively \nconstituted and that a considerable amount of, generally unacknowledged, effort goes \ninto reproducing them.  They may seem to be self-evident, immutable, and natural \nstates-of-affairs, but they are nonetheless the product of concerted human action.  This \nis not dissimilar to the discussion of reification in social constructionism (Berger and \nLuckman, 1966).  Being the product of human action, rather than fully naturalised \ncategories, social rules and norms always contain the potential, however infinitesimal, \nfor their own transformation. \n \nThis potential for transforming social rules and norms has been directly recognised by a \nnumber of practice-based organisation theorists.  As Gherardi (2006, p. 29) has \ncommented, \u201csocial norms are indexical, with the consequence that a rule of behaviour \ndoes not have a univocal meaning outside the concrete settings where it is applied.  This \nthesis stresses in particular that the range of application of a rule is always constituted \nby an a priori indefinable number of different situations, so that a norm is always \napplied \u2018for another first time\u2019 \u2026 and a routine work practice is always executed for \n\u2018another first time\u2019\u201d.  Similarly, Feldman and Pentland (2003) have highlighted the \npartly reflective and performative character of rules and norms of conduct as a way of \nexploring the interplay between the reproducibility and transformability of routine \npractices.  They use the distinction between ostensive and performative forms of power \nspecified by Latour (1986) to offer a reworking of the notion of organisational routines.  \nAccording to their definition, the \u201costensive aspect is the ideal or schematic form of a \nroutine.  It is the abstract, generalized idea of the routine, or the routine in principle.  \nThe performative aspect of the routine consists of specific actions, by specific people, in \nspecific places and times.  It is the routine in practice.  Both of these aspects are \nnecessary for an organizational routine to exist\u201d (Feldman and Pentland, 2003, p. 101).  \nAccordingly, rules and norms in their formal or ostensive sense can never be all-\nencompassing because they always rely on being enacted through performances.   \n \nHowever, what has received less attention in these accounts is the notion that the \nperformance of rules and norms by necessity relies upon an active, if often implicit, \n 11 \nbackground of interpretations and assumptions, in an ongoing flow of mutually \nconstituting interactions.  These are needed to reproduce normative behaviour to give it \nits regularised character, but also offer the potential for its transformation through \nunintentional modifications and the reflexive self-monitoring of more conscious agency \n(Emirbayer and Mische, 1998).  A key issue here is not only that individuals are active \nagents in the reproduction and potential transformation of social rules and normative \nexpectations, but also that the process of fitting together norms, dispositions, and \nsituations is a crucially interpretive accomplishment.  In order to orientate their \nbehaviour by calling upon different normative or dispositional elements that are more or \nless appropriate to the situation, individuals must first make sense of the what the \nsituation is, often on the basis of quite fragmentary, fleeting, and incomplete evidence.  \nHow one makes sense of situations is, in turn, influenced by what Hochschild (1979) \ncalled \u2018framing rules\u2019 and Cicourel (1973) termed \u2018interactional competence\u2019.  In either \ncase it is not only knowledge of the rules that is needed, but also a practical sense of \nhow and where they can be applied.  For Cicourel (1973) there is a crucially cognitive \ndimension to the ability to generate situationally appropriate actions in that both \nnormative expectations and the understanding of situations are guided by interpretive \nschemata.   \n \nThis is something that practice-based approaches, and sociology more generally, have \navoided recognising.  Yet, as Sewell (1992, p. 7, emphasis in original) has argued in \nrelation to structuration theory, this leads to something of an omission: \u201cGiddens places \na great deal of weight on the notion that actors are knowledgeable.  It is, presumably, \nthe knowledge of rules that makes people capable of action.  But Giddens develops no \nvocabulary for specifying the content of what people know\u201d.  Cicourel (1981, p. 101) \nhas made much the same point in suggesting that \u201c[t]aking seriously the notion of \nschema theory should force sociologists to recognize the necessity of an explicit theory \nof meaning.  Sociological theory often treats meaning as obvious or as a residual \ncategory\u201d.  Using the example of the constitution of project management practices in \nconsulting engineering, the next section offers an illustration of how the interplay of \ninterpretative schemata, norms, and situations can be approached empirically.  This \nprovides an opportunity to reflect upon not only the conceptual challenges of integrating \ncognitive and practice-based approaches, but also the non-trivial issues of method that \narise when attempting such an integration. \n \n \n5. REPRESENTING AND PERFORMING PROJECT WORK: AN \nILLUSTRATION \n \nThis illustration is drawn from a study currently being conducted by the author into the \npractices of multi-functional project teams.  It focuses on one of two teams being \nstudied through a combination of ethnographic observation and other methods for \ninvestigating patterns of team knowledge, such as cognitive mapping and documentary \nanalysis.  The team in question, which undertakes capital projects in the utilities sector, \nhas members representing different functions, roles, disciplines, and organisational \naffiliations.  It is responsible for delivering an extensive series of projects over a five \nyear period as part of a large capital investment programme.  In terms of the methods \nchosen for the study, a multi-method case study approach was selected as an appropriate \nway of addressing the research questions.  The two principal methods used are \nethnographic observation and cognitive mapping which, despite making strange \nbedfellows, arguably offer complementary insights that partly counteract each other\u2019s \nweaknesses.   \n 12 \n \nThere is a tendency in practice-based theories to assume that the intelligibility of \nsituated practices can mainly be grasped through observation.  This is founded on an \nargument drawn from ethnomethodology where the indexicality of practices, in which \ntheir meaning is tied to specific contexts of action, is such that those participating in \nthem are able to, and routinely do, provide their own accounts of what they do.  This \noffers a foundation for reflexive action, but crucially also, so the argument goes, allows \nexternal observers to reconstruct the meaning of practices through observation.  While \nethnomethodology can be criticised for exaggerating the transparency of practice to \nthose involved, and particularly to those outside a given field of practice, there are \nnevertheless key benefits to approaches based on the longitudinal observation of, and \nengagement in, activity settings for investigating knowledge-in-action.  Without \nbecoming deeply embedded in the setting being studied it is difficult for the researcher \nto appreciate the context-specific, localised, and emergent character of practices.  To \nthis end, the research has involved repeated visits to the various team locations to \nobserve the day-to-day activities of its members, particularly in their formal and \ninformal interactions.  To date this has involved around 45 days contact with the team \nover a twelve month period, with visits to the other case study team being conducted \npartly in parallel.  As well as detailed notes and, where possible, direct transcripts of \nmeetings held for a variety of reasons (from team level discussions to detailed planning, \nprogress, design, and implementation meetings), a fieldwork diary was kept for each \nvisit containing a record of observations, conversations, and other points of potential \ninterest.  As far as possible, this has been based on an attempt not to pre-select and \ncensor events that only meet my preconceptions about the setting I am trying to \nunderstand.  This is frequently easier said than done and conscious efforts need to be \nmade to counteract the influence of familiarity on observations as the amount of contact \ntime with the team increases.  The danger here is that with the growing routinisation of \nresearch interactions over time it also becomes more difficult to appreciate the recurrent \ncharacter of those team practices that are the target of the research. \n \nContrary to the assumption often found in practice-based approaches that observation is \nthe only secure route to comprehending a field of practice, I would suggest that social \npractices are often more opaque to outsiders than frequently claimed.  The previous \npoint about the researcher becoming absorbed in the taken-for-granted nature of a \npractice indicates the paradoxical nature of observational research.  Familiar to \nanthropologists, the paradox is that in order to understand the rule-based and routine \nnature of practices, the researcher must allow him or herself to become, at least partly, \nengaged in those practices and thus risks treating them in the same taken-for-granted \nway as the research participants under study.  With minimal engagement, the researcher \nis presented with a potentially bewildering series of obscure activities and the danger is \nthat their meaning is interpreted solely according to the researcher\u2019s existing conceptual \nschemas.  However, by developing the degree of engagement required to begin to \nunderstand the meaning of practices as it appears to those involved in them, it becomes \nlikely that the more routine or \u2018normal\u2019 activities go unobserved as they no longer have \nthe capacity through unfamiliarity to capture the attention. \n \nRecognising the challenges and limitations of observational work, the study has also \ndrawn on other methods, particularly cognitive mapping, as a technique for eliciting \nteam members\u2019 perspectives on project work.  Using the issue of what constitutes and \ndifferentiates \u2018good projects\u2019 and \u2018bad projects\u2019 as an opening thematic prompt, team \nmembers are asked to construct cognitive maps of their immediate responses to this \ntheme side-by-side with the researcher using the mapping software package Decision \n 13 \nExplorer\u2122.  So far 30 mapping interviews have been conducted, each lasting around 1-\n1\u00bd hours, and I am currently involved in repeat interviews with those participants who \nare still available to see the extent to which their thematic priorities have changed over \nthe intervening period of several months since the original mapping exercises were \nundertaken.  For each of the mapping interviews, the emphasis was on minimising the \namount of prompting provided to participants beyond explaining the mechanics of the \nmapping process, introducing the initial thematic prompt, and clarifying the wording of \nthe concepts as they were recorded by the researcher using, as far as possible, the \nrespondent\u2019s own words.  Audio recordings and transcriptions of both the initial and \nfollow-up interviews have been made, providing an important cross-reference during \nthe subsequent analysis of the resulting maps (see Figure 1 for some examples of maps \ngenerated with team members). \n \nThe status of the representations developed through cognitive mapping in its various \nforms have been the subject of vigorous debate (e.g. Bougon, 1992; Daniels and \nJohnson, 2002; Hodgkinson, 2002; Scheper and Faber, 1994).  While this is by no \nmeans inevitable, cognitive mapping is frequently associated with some of the less \nbeneficial characteristics of conventional cognitive psychology, as outlined above.  In \nother words, there is the danger through cognitive mapping of promoting a static, \nindividualistic, and representationalist view of knowledge, often accompanied by a \nstrongly positivist and functionalist research orientation.  At its most extreme, there is \nthe risk of conflating cognitive maps as verbal and visual representations of ideas or \nperspectives, with cognitive maps as a metaphor for heuristic and schematically guided \nprocesses of perception and interpretation.  At best, as Swan (1997) has observed, \ncognitive maps are representations of representations, and incomplete and fragmentary \nones at that.  However, as a corollary of my suggestion that to draw on insights from the \ncognitive tradition does not have to mean that one accepts all its attendant problems, \nproviding its limitations are acknowledged, cognitive mapping can be used as an \neffective method for gathering perspectives about a particular domain.  This does not \ninevitably mean that the method has to be used in a static, functionalist, and positivist \nway.   \n \nBy treating the resulting representations generated from the mapping sessions not as \nfinal and definitive mirrors of an individual\u2019s thinking, but rather as partial, provisional, \nand revisable documents charting a person\u2019s perspectives on a given theme at a specific \npoint in time, many of the above difficulties fall away.  The resulting cognitive maps are \nnot an end-product, as they appear to be treated in some studies, but instead take the \nform of incomplete markers that can be positioned and compared relative to the activity \nsetting of the respondents.  Without this they remain abstract and fixed with no sense of \nhow they are mutually constituted in practice.  This is where the ethnographic element \nof the research comes back in.  By taking a multi-method approach, it is possible to use \ncognitive mapping in a much more situated and dynamic way than has usually been the \ncase, while at the same time providing another window into the nature of practice that \ndoes not depend entirely on insights drawn from observation.  The following examples \nare drawn from both elements of the study and the crucial attempts to trace out the \nconnections between them. \n \n \n5.1 Schemas of Project Work \n \nOne of the key rationales behind using a cognitive mapping approach has been to \nattempt to identify if there are any patterns or regularities in the ways that multi-\n 14 \nfunctional project team members represent the nature of their work.  A major \nmethodological challenge here has been how to make meaningful comparisons across \nwhat are quite individual and idiosyncratic maps.  The relative benefits and \ndisadvantages of ideographic (as employed in this study) as opposed to nomothetic \nmapping techniques has been a major topic of discussion in the study of organisational \ncognition (e.g. Daniels and Johnson, 2002; Hogkinson, 2002).  The main problem with \ncomparing cognitive maps collected using an ideographic approach is that, with fewer \nlimits on what concepts respondents are able to talk about and an emphasis on allowing \nthem to express themselves in their own words, the researcher is left with the potentially \nenormous task of painstakingly examining and cross-checking each concept and the \nrelationships between them manually rather than with the aid of, at least partly, \nautomated analytical techniques to which nomothetic approaches lend themselves more \nreadily.  However, for the purposes of the present study, where it has been important not \nto impose a priori limitations on the concepts employed by respondents so as not to \neliminate potential points of difference, the challenges of analysing ideographic \ncognitive maps were judged to be a worthwhile price to pay for addressing the research \nquestions.  In order to make a comparative analysis possible, the maps have been \nsubject to qualitative interpretation and coding using an emergent and iterative coding \nscheme that is still being refined as further data are collected.  The aim of the coding has \nbeen to reduce the overwhelming number of concepts elicited through the mapping by \ngrouping them into overarching themes.  Thus, where it is possible to detect thematic \nsimilarities between the concepts used by respondents, despite precise variations in \nwording and forms of expression, these have been grouped together under a more \ninclusive label.   \n \nThe next stage in the analysis has been to identify patterns across these themes to see \nwhere team members agree and disagree on their perspectives of project work.  The \ncoding has also been used as the basis for a cluster analysis to explore whether there are \nregularities of response between specific segments of the project team according to \npotential bases of identity construction (e.g. role, discipline, organisational affiliation, \neducational background, age, gender, etc.).  However, the results of that aspect of the \nresearch will not be reported here.  Instead, I would like to concentrate on the overall \ndegree of overlap (or otherwise) in team members\u2019 perspectives on project work and \nhow far they coincide with orthodox images of project management without going into \ndetail on patterns at the sub-group level.  The idea is to give some indication of the \nextent to which the typical norms of project work are apparent in the concepts that \nproject members articulate in their self-characterisation of what they do.  I will discuss \nsome important caveats regarding the status and interpretation of these data in due \ncourse, but leaving those aside for the time being the indications emerging from he \nmapping side of the study are as follows. \n \nBased on the coding of concepts from the maps collected from a cross-section of team \nmembers, Figure 2 depicts the degree to which thematic areas are shared across the \nteam.  It should be evident from the overall character of themes covered that there is a \nfairly strong appearance of those supporting a technical, rational, and instrumental view \non project management.  However, perhaps the most telling indications of this come \nfrom those themes that are shared by the majority of maps.  Here the usual \npreoccupations of project management thinking come to the fore, not least the \u2018iron \ntriangle\u2019 of time, cost, and quality.  Having said that, it is worth noting that time and \ncost, the pre-eminent pillars of managerial instrumentalism, actually make an \nappearance in more project members\u2019 maps of project work than does quality.  Other \npopular themes that are in line with conventional project management thinking include: \n 15 \nplanning, control and monitoring; issues about scope of work and establishing a clear \ndirection to follow; processes, standards, and regulations; resource allocation; a focus \non delivering actions, outcomes, and outputs; and so on.  Not all the central themes are \nquite so technically-orientated but are arguably equally rational and instrumental in \nflavour.  These include issues about staffing and personnel, such as team selection and \nrole allocation; how to motivate the team through appropriate incentives; how to \norganise and arrange team relationships to promote enhanced performance; and how to \nstreamline communications between different parties. \n \nWhile the themes in the middle of the diagram give an indication of the issues around \nwhich there appears to be team consensus, suggesting the existence of collective norms \nsurrounding what is involved in project work, it is important not to forget the widely \nranging collection of themes arrayed around the edge that are shared by a smaller \nproportion of the maps.  Admittedly many of these are subsets or elaborations of what \ntend to be more abstract and generalised categories in the centre (e.g. \u2018deadlines and \nmilestones\u2019 are a sub-category of \u2018time and programme\u2019).  This means that it is little \nsurprise there is less overlap because they are simply specific and more individualised \ninstances of the global project management topics that dominate the middle.  However, \nit does also underline the overall technical, rational, and instrumental flavour of the \nconcepts covered by the maps.  Further refinements of the coding scheme will \nconcentrate on clarifying the hierarchical relationships or nesting between themes to \naddress potential difficulties in adequately charting the shared occurrence of themes \nacross all the different maps.  However, it should be clear that some of the outlying \nthemes are less readily subsumed under the more generic issues that have been more \nregularly referred to by respondents.  Some interesting examples include: innovation \nand new ideas, learning, responsibility and accountability, environmental issues, \nemotional issues, and help, advice, and mentoring.  While, of course, it is entirely \npossible to take a quite instrumental view on each of these themes, to the extent that \nthey could be the target of purposeful manipulation to enhance project delivery, they are \nperhaps less obviously in the mould of orthodox project management thinking.  An \nimportant question arising from this is whether the patterning and distribution of themes \nacross the maps supports the view of conventional project management ideas being \nnormalised to the extent that such views are broadly shared by most people in the team.  \nCertainly the initial indications are that this is the case, with the more popular images of \nproject work being quite orthodox while other perhaps less conventional themes are not \nshared so widely. \n \n \n5.2 Performing Project Management Schemas \n \nHaving seen strong indications from the case study team members\u2019 cognitive maps of \nquite orthodox norms of project management thinking, a major question arises as to how \nfar such schematic assumptions about their work guides their conduct in practice, and \nequally how their everyday practices shape their perspectives of what they do.  From the \nearlier discussion about the performative and open-ended character of norms and rules \nof behaviour, it should be clear that they are not universal and unchanging, but rather \nactively, and often incompletely, constituted through situated practices.  It would, \ntherefore, be surprising to find the complete penetration of a field of practice by a \nsingle, all-embracing form of rationality, such as that represented by orthodox schemas \nof project management.  Some counter-currents to the dominant images of project \nmanagement have already been seen in the themes emerging from the maps in the form \n 16 \nof concepts and issues that do not comfortably fit the collective norms.  Indications \nfrom the observations of team practices are equally ambivalent, if not more so. \n \nCertainly there are clear outward signs of conventional project management thinking \nobservable in the case study setting.  These include the usual techniques of control and \nordering, such as detailed project procedures that follow a linear stage model, Gantt \ncharts and other tools for planning time and resources, and regular meetings and \ndocumentation processes designed to report on, monitor, and adjust progress.  Many of \nthese tools and procedures are formally prescribed and codified in considerable detail \nwithin the company\u2019s IT systems.  Here the standard project process, with its clear \nsequence of stages, milestones, and decision points for technical and financial approval, \nare laid out.  Underneath these are then arrayed a progressively more elaborate \nhierarchy of work instructions describing in minute detail the actions that need to be \nundertaken within each stage of the project.  However, from observing the behaviour of \nthe team as they perform tasks specified by this overall sequence, it quickly becomes \nclear that such norms of project practice are not undertaken automatically and without \nreflection and critique.  Indeed, it is evident that many team members display a quite \nambivalent stance to the formal project procedures, combining elements of frustration \nand cynicism about their precise form, while at the same time usually complying with \ntheir underlying logic by leaving the fundamental existence of such features as a clear \nsequence of project stages largely unquestioned.   \n \nFor example, at a presentation on how to use the project extranet, the presenter \u2013 a \nprogramme manager from another team \u2013 demonstrates a link within the system to the \ncompany\u2019s formal project stage model.  One of the design engineers points out that this \nis not actually the sequence of events that happens within his team.  Due to differences \nin the contractual arrangements for the type of work undertaken by the team, detailed \ndesign and one of the project stage gates are in a different place than indicated in the \nmodel.  The presenter says that the diagram was created from the point of view of the \nwork undertaken by his team and other teams involved in similar work and admits that \nit does not reflect what happens in all parts of the company.  The engineer asks whether \nit would be possible to modify the diagram to reflect this.  The initial response of the \npresenter is as follows: \u201cI\u2019m happy to change it, but I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s half the \ncompany it applies to and half that it doesn\u2019t and you\u2019re unfortunately in the half that it \ndoesn\u2019t\u201d.  Another design engineer then asks whether it might not be possible to show \nwithin the existing diagram that there are actually two somewhat different stage models \nrelevant to different teams in the company.  The presenter agrees to look into this.  What \nthis short episode suggests is that there is an acknowledgement of the limitations and \ncontradictions inherent in attempts to establish formal project procedures.   \n \nContrary to the universalising impulses of project management contained in the logic of \na fixed sequence of project stages applicable to all projects, the engineers in the \nexchange above clearly recognise that there needs to be some flexibility in this \nsequence.  If they were actually to follow the formal procedures for project stages as \nencapsulated in the project extranet to the letter, they would end up carrying out \nactivities that were inappropriate for the nature of the work that they do and, \nparadoxically, undermine the performative intentions of having formal procedures.  \nInstead of being an innate, naturalised, and immutable element of project work, the \n\u2018project stage process\u2019 is problematised as a context-dependent device whose \nconstitution depends crucially on social and political influences.  The fact that the \ngeneral project stage model for the company takes the particular form that it does speaks \nvolumes about the relative position and interests of those responsible for its design.  The \n 17 \nmodel has been created around the specific needs and activities of this group and then \npresented as the definitive company procedure without, it seems, even realising that \nthere might be limits to its applicability across different areas of the company.  By \nquestioning the relevance of the stage model to their own activities, the members of the \ncase study team are opening up some cracks in the rationalistic veneer of the project \nstage process, not to question the overall existence of some form of project staging, but \nto assert the local character of their practices by declaring that this is not the way that \nthings are done around here. \n \nAnother example of the often critical way in which team members reflect upon formal \nprocedures is provided by a discussion I had with a design engineer who had recently \njoined the team from a company-level programme for defining and implementing a \nrange of process improvement projects.  He described how this improvement \nprogramme was strictly based around the PRINCE2 (PRojects in Controlled \nEnvironments) project management methodology (OGC, 2005).  This is a tightly \nsequential and carefully controlled process-driven approach to project management that \ninvolves the initial formation of a Business Case and its subsequent review on a regular \nbasis.  The engineer commented on how he thought the documentation requirements for \nthis approach are excessive and that the procedures are generally too cumbersome for \nmost activities.  He went on to say that the use of a high profile approach, such as \nPRINCE2, which attempts to present itself as the current best practice for managing \nprojects, is probably being used by the company\u2019s process improvement programme \nless as a workable approach and more as a visible display of their being at the cutting \nedge in project management terms and a justification for the resources they have been \ngiven to undertake their work.  He outlined two reasons for this.  Firstly, the \nimprovement programme is mostly staffed by people who have not come from an \nengineering or project background and so he thinks that they may be keen to \ndemonstrate their project management credentials within an organisation that overall \nhas a strong technical orientation.  Ironically, by choosing a methodology that many \npractising project managers and engineers within the engineering side of the company \nconsider to be overly complicated and bureaucratic, the result has arguably been the \nopposite of that intended by the process improvement team.  Rather than demonstrating \ntheir legitimate membership within the project management community, they have \nunwittingly set themselves apart.  This is because their slavish following of PRINCE2 \nprinciples appears in stark contrast to the more experience-based, rule-of-thumb, and \ncommonsensical image of practice that the established project management community \nwithin the company likes to portray.  Secondly, having made a number of \u201cquick wins\u201d \nin improving processes, the engineer suggested that most of the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d had \nbeen picked and that further measurable improvements would be both less dramatic and \nslower in coming.  He argued that since it was now becoming difficult to prove the \noutcomes of these improvement projects, more emphasis was being placed on the \nactivities being undertaken rather than their outcomes to demonstrate that something \nwas being achieved.  PRINCE2, with its detailed \u201cpaper trail\u201d of documentation was, \naccording to the engineer, an effective way of achieving this even if it ultimately did not \ncontribute to the aims of the programme.  What is most interesting in this illustration is \nnot that the use of project management discourses as a political tool for legitimating \nparticular activities and access to resources, or as a badge of membership in a given \ncommunity, can be readily shown to depart from the calmly rational and instrumental \nimage of project management orthodoxy.  The more important point is that this critique \nshows the clear capacity of practitioners to reflect critically upon what they do, in this \ncase demonstrating a less than complete acceptance of conventional project \n 18 \nmanagement norms and a clear orientation towards not taking the claims of formally \nprescribed approaches too seriously. \n \nThe above example is by no means an exception in the team.  Discussions among team \nmembers, both in formal and informal interactions, often involve a questioning attitude \ntowards what might be considered conventional project management thinking.  It is in \nthese episodes that one can find indications of multiple rationalities that are often \ncontradictory.  Sometimes these contradictions are left untouched, particularly by \nsplitting rationalities into distinct domains (e.g. professional and personal life, work and \nhome, individual and organisation), thus allowing people to cope with the potential \nconflict.  In these instances some norms, values, or beliefs are often privileged while \nothers are allowed to play a less prominent role, a typical example being the self-\nregulation of personal beliefs that are not thought to be in line with the collective norms \nof conduct at work (bearing in mind that we have emphasised the provisional and \ncontested character of the latter).  In other cases, the tensions can not so easily be \ncontained and erupt into situations where attempts are made to repair and resolve the \ncontradiction. \n \nThe following illustration, taken from a discussion at another of the team\u2019s monthly \nmeetings, suggests how multiple rationalities are a regular feature of organisational life \nwithin the team.  In this example, members of the team are discussing the recent \nrequirement introduced by the company to complete a waste management plan when \nplanning their projects.  This is being implemented with the intention of reducing the \nenvironmental impact of projects through increased on-site recycling of waste materials, \nreduced landfill, and fewer vehicle movements.  A manager has come from the head \noffice to explain the new requirements.  Throughout his explanation he repeatedly \nemphasises how there is a good financial business case for reducing waste.  This focus \non reducing corporate social and environmental responsibility issues to a financial \nrationale by portraying such practices as also good for the bottom line is perhaps what \none might expect from an orthodox managerialist perspective.  However, rather than \naccept this rationale at face value, different members of the team questioned the way \nthat the changes to waste management procedures were being justified to them.  The \nteam leader was particularly vociferous on this point, saying that he would \u201clike to hear \nthe company say this is what you should do because it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d not \nsimply because there is a workable business case for it.   \n \nHowever, at a subsequent meeting a few months later, the issue of reducing the impact \nof projects on the environment was again raised, except that this time views about the \nrelative priority of such matters had changed quite radically.  This was because in the \nintervening period a major reorganisation had been set in motion within the company \nwith a strong focus on improving efficiency and concentrating only on business critical \nactivities.  Each of the project areas was under extreme pressure to show demonstrable \nimprovements and so, to avoid being the target of senior management interventions, the \nteam\u2019s management was now retreating into a more conventional position on such \nthings as environmental and social responsibility.  The team leader was still keen to \npromote an ethos where team members are encouraged to think about their wider \nresponsibilities and \u2018do the right thing\u2019, except that now he emphasised that this had to \ntake second place to questions of efficiency.  He is keen to justify this change of \nposition, counterposing his own interpretation and beliefs against what are portrayed as \nthe inescapable realities of business: \n \n 19 \n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a company like ours and not have environmental and \nsustainability objectives \u2026 It\u2019s the money thing isn\u2019t it?  How far would you go \nto pay to have good environmental consequences \u2026 So money always comes \ninto it and that\u2019s why the word sustainability is always thrown in there because \n\u2026 sustainability doesn\u2019t mean saving up things now so that you can use them \nlater on in the day.  That\u2019s what it should mean.  Doing things now that mean we \nexist and we can function \u2026 in the future is what sustainable means in my view.  \nBut what it means to us is not doing this if it doesn\u2019t pay back.  Sustainable \u2026 \nmeans can the company afford it.  Because if it can\u2019t afford to do these things \neven though it wants to do them, it won\u2019t exist\u201d. \n \nWhat this example shows is the interplay of quite different rationalities \u2013 a more private \nbelief system about environmental sustainability and a more public, role-constrained \nposition that ultimately takes precedence within the changing context of the company\u2019s \norganisational initiatives.  The implication is not only that different and potentially \ncompeting discourses can coexist within a particular setting of practice, sometimes \nrubbing up against each other in the form of tensions and contradictions, but also that \nsuch discourses and the interplay between them are not static but are instead \ndynamically constituted and situated within a whole range of other interlocking \npractices.  This is something that is difficult to detect in the earlier cognitive mapping \ndata because, unless repeated at different points in time, they represent a single snapshot \nof an individual\u2019s perspectives on a given set of issues.  From this it is easy to assume \nthat all of the perspectives expressed are equally enduring when it is more likely that \nsome will make a relatively regular appearance, at least in some form, in somebody\u2019s \nviews over time, while others will be more ephemeral, temporarily reflecting the salient \nfeatures of the more immediate situation.  Thus, while it is possible to detect a \ncontinuing concern about not taking an excessively hard-nosed and instrumental \nposition on environmental issues in the team leader\u2019s professed views over time, there is \nan important shift in how these are represented relative to other perspectives.  With the \nchanging political climate accompanying the company\u2019s reorganisation, the team \nmanagement\u2019s zone of manoeuvre narrows and they self-consciously subordinate their \nown more personal beliefs to those of an increasingly powerful corporate discourse of \nefficiency.  Despite this, the team leader\u2019s strong personal stance on issues other than \npurely technical efficiency has not been displaced in all instances by the new pressures \nfrom the corporate level.  Thus, despite calls from the head office to \u2018streamline\u2019 health \nand safety procedures in the new efficiency drive, this was not something that he was \nprepared to compromise on.  In direct contradiction to the directive that had been issued \nhe instructed his staff to continue to carry out all existing health and safety related \nactivities and said that he would take responsibility if they ran into any problems by \ndoing this.  Once again this highlights the shifting and power-laden tension between \nalternative rationalities and modes of practice in which the outcomes are never entirely \npredictable and secure.  This is because there is always the scope for some resistance, \nhowever small it may be, as people have the capacity to reflect upon and readjust what \nthey do.  Certainly this capacity is not unlimited and is crucially constrained by existing \npatterns and norms of thought and conduct, but it is precisely the fact that such norms \nneed to be actively constituted to be reproduced over time that provides the opening for \ntheir potential transformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \n6. CONCLUSION \n \nThis paper has put forward the argument that cognitive and practice-based traditions in \nthe study of organisational knowledge and learning both have important contributions to \nmake to our understanding of the field.  However, the full potential of these \ncontributions has been hamstrung by a lack of positive interchange between the two \ntraditions.  This is because these two broad approaches have typically been presented as \nincommensurable and so have eschewed the opportunity of learning from each other.  \nWhat I have argued is that the incompatibility of cognitive and practice-based \napproaches has been exaggerated and that both have something to contribute to the \nother.  Practice-based theories offer a crucial corrective to many of the weaknesses of \nthe cognitive tradition, including the latter\u2019s tendency to portray knowledge in static, \nindividualistic, and representationalist terms.  Instead, practice-based approaches have \nemphasised the dynamic and situated character of knowing in practice as a culturally, \nhistorically, and socially constituted accomplishment.  However, I have also argued that \nthe criticism of cognitive approaches by practice-based theories relates primarily to only \none, albeit dominant, strand of the cognitive tradition based on the idea of information \nprocessing and fails to take into account ideas from cognitive psychology that are by no \nmeans subject to the same difficulties.  In their efforts to avoid mentalism and \nrepresentationalism at all costs, practice-based approaches have tended to reject any and \nall cognitive explanations.  This is unfortunate because there are insights that practice-\nbased theories can derive from a more socially situated and dynamic understanding of \ncognitive processes.  In particular, the former tend to struggle to provide an adequate \naccount of both the reproducibility and transformability of social practices and it is here \nthat the notion of shared schemas drawn from cognitive psychology can offer fruitful \navenues of exploration.  I have suggested that schemas are the cognitive equivalent of \nsocial rules and norms, and that they are central in underpinning the interpretative \ncompetence necessary to constitute, but also potentially transform, situationally \nappropriate actions.  At the same time, the performative dimension of recurrent \npractices in turn helps to constitute their ostensive or schematic component, \nreproducing, modifying, or overturning established frameworks and assumptions in an \nongoing flow of mutually constituting interactions. \n \nWhile the integration of cognitive and practice-based approaches presents some \nimportant conceptual challenges, it is also crucial not to underestimate the \nmethodological issues associated with bringing the two traditions together.  Just as \ncognitive and practice-based approaches have tended to pursue quite distinct theoretical \nprogrammes, they also typically rely on quite different methods.  Using an illustration \ndrawn from a current study I have been conducting, I have attempted to show how in \nthe area of empirical method, as much as theory, there are benefits to be gained from \ncombining the methods of cognitive psychology, in this case cognitive mapping, with \nthose of practice-based approaches, in the form of detailed ethnographies of practice.  \nThe illustration shows how multiple methods can provide different lenses on how \nparticipants represent and perform their joint activities in practice.  Using examples of \nshared schemas of project work and the extent to which they both constitute and are \nconstituted by the day-to-day working practices of a team of consulting engineers, I \nhave endeavoured to show that the interplay between the two is by no means \nstraightforward.  From the cognitive mapping data it appears that team members share a \nquite similar core of assumptions concerning their project practices, taking the form of \nrather formal, abstract, and conventional images of project management.  However, \nfrom the observational data it is clear that these schematic representations offer only an \nincomplete guide to action, with the nature of project work coming across as \n 21 \nconsiderably more contested and negotiated within different social settings compared \nwith the more definitive and less ambivalent character of individual schemas elicited \nthrough the mapping exercises.  While the implications of this have yet to be explored \nfully, there is an interesting mismatch between the project practices of team members \nand the way that they represent these practices.  Such gaps between thinking, saying, \nand doing are, of course, a regular feature of organisational life, as typified by the \ndistinction drawn by Argyris and Sch\u00f6n (1978) between espoused theories and theories-\nin-use.  This raises important questions about the reasons for such differences and the \nextent to which cognitive schemata and situated practices are co-conditioning that need \nto be more thoroughly addressed.  Nevertheless, while there is still much to be done in \ndrawing together cognitive and practice-based approaches, and especially in \noperationalising them empirically, I hope to have shown that the potential benefits to be \ngained from doing so make the attempt worthwhile. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nI would like to acknowledge the support of the UK Economic and Social Research \nCouncil (grant reference: RES-000-23-1116) and extend my gratitude to all those who \nhave participated in the study reported in this paper. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbelson, R.P.
