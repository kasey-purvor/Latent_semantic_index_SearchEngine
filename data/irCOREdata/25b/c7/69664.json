IN EACH DATA-SET THE\nMEDIAN VALUE IS EMBOLDENED\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIontophoresis is widely used for transcutaneous delivery of ioniz-\nable drugs for the assessment of skin microvascular function. In prac-\ntice, a small electrical current is used to carry e.g., vasodilators such as\nacetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) through the skin,\nwhile consequent changes in blood flow aremonitored by laser Doppler\nflowmetry [1]\u2013[3]. It is known, however, that increases of blood flow\ncan be produced in response to the current, even in the absence of drugs,\nwhen using pharmacologically neutral electrolytes such as H2O [4],\n[5] or NaCl solution [6]. This phenomenon is known as the galvanic\neffect or current-induced vasodilation. The mechanism is unclear but\ncould involve, for example, local heating due to the voltage required to\nconvey the ions through the dermal barrier. Because a finite potential\ndifference is always needed to maintain the chosen iontophoresis cur-\nrent, it is obviously important to establish whether or not the magnitude\nof this voltage is a significant factor in causing vasodilation.\nWe have therefore carried out a systematic study of the voltages\nneeded for iontophoresis with a constant current under different\nconditions, and of how they change with time. The present work\ndiffers in two important respects from the investigations recently\nreported by Ferrell et al. [7] and Ramsay et al. [8]. First, all of\nour measurements are for pulsed iontophoresis, rather than for a\ncontinuous longer period of stepped current delivery. Second, our\nmeasurements are all single-ended, i.e., we measure the potential\ndifference when a fixed current is passed between an iontophoresis\ncell and the body, rather than the combined voltage difference across\ntwo cells of opposite polarity, with the body in between. This enables\nus to establish unambiguously the voltage needed for iontophoresis of\ngiven polarity with particular electrolytes.\nII. METHODS\nThe measurements were performed on 11 healthy subjects (two fe-\nmale, nine male) aged 24\u201368 years (see Table I). They lay comfortably,\nsemi-supine, with the measured forearm placed in a horizontal position\non a cushion, in a quiet roomwith an ambient temperature of 20\u00061\u000e C.\nThe study was approved by theMorecambe Bay Local Research Ethics\nCommittee and the subjects gave their fully informed consent.\nCurrents were derived from a battery-powered constant-current ion-\ntophoresis controller (Moor Instruments MIC1-e). The iontophoresis\nchambers were of perspex with internal platinumwire electrodes. Their\ninternal diameter was 8 mm, giving an area of 1 cm2 in contact with the\nskin. Four chambers were used, placed in a square of side 2 cm on the\nvolar aspect of the forearm. They were held in position with double-\nsided adhesive disks, avoiding hair or skin defects. The earth-potential\nelectrode was a 4 cm\u0002 4 cm conducting pad, placed on the wrist at\n0018-9294\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\n1684 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 51, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2004\nFig. 1. Potential differences (in volts) needed to drive the iontophoretic current pulses (see Section II), for subject J. The top panel indicates the timing of the\ncurrent pulses. The lower panels show respectively: voltage as a function of time for the different electrolytes and polarities of active electrode, as indicated; blood\nflow measured by the probe inserted in the centre of the chamber; and basal blood flow in unstimulated skin at least 5 cm away from the nearest iontophoresis\nchamber. Note the difference in ordinate scale between the lower two panels. The abscissa scale is the same for all measurements and electrolytes, but with an\narbitrary zero and different offsets for the different electrolytes.\na distance of 15\u201318 cm from the iontophoresis chamber. Good elec-\ntrical contact was ensured by the use of conducting MIC1-GP gel. The\nfour substances were inserted sequentially, and randomly. The order in\nwhich the polarities were chosen was also random. For consistency, the\ndiscussion that follows relates to the order of the data in Fig. 1, but this\ndoes not reflect the order in which the data were acquired.\nThe voltage required to maintain a constant current between\neach chamber and the earth-potential electrode was measured. The\nvoltage measurement circuit was of very high input impedance\n(50 M\n) to avoid drawing a significant fraction of the current from\nthe iontophoresis controller. It was based on the Linear Technology\nLT1112 operational amplifier for the input stages, and a Burr Brown\n3656 transformer-coupled isolation amplifier meeting the safety\nrequirements of IEC 601-1. The circuit also served to rescale the\nmeasured \u000625 to \u00065 V, which was taken to the same multi-channel\nanalogue-to-digital convertor used for digitizing the blood flow\nsignals.\nThe programmed current delivery protocol produced 100-\u0016A pulses\nof duration 20 s, separated by 60-s intervals, over a total measurement\nperiod of 6 min. Between the pulses, the iontophoresis current was held\nat zero.\nVoltage measurements were made for four different electrolytes:\ndeionized H2O; 20.4% saturated, 5 mol\/l NaCl solution (both positive\nand negative electrodes); 1% ACh (positive electrode); and 1% SNP\n(negative electrode). During these measurements, the cutaneous blood\nflow was monitored by laser\/Doppler flowmetry using the Moor\nInstruments DRT4 to which the iontophoresis controller was attached.\nIII. RESULTS\nA full set of iontophoresis voltage measurements for subject J is\nshown in Fig. 1. In what follows, we use average to denote a time av-\nerage of the blood flow or of the potential difference, while median\nrefers to the group median value over the 11 subjects. The average volt-\nages for each subject are summarized in Table I and presented graphi-\ncally in Fig. 2(a). Several features of the data are apparent. The average\nmagnitude of the voltage needed to maintain the current decreased with\ntime: each successive pulse is slightly lower. The voltages also varied\nwithin each pulse, usually decreasing as shown in Fig. 1. The voltage\nbetween current pulses was in general small but nonzero, and it some-\ntimes varied with time in a complicated manner.\nCathodal iontophoresis with deionizedH2Oproduced clear evidence\nof increased blood flow, as shown in Fig. 2(b); but even in the seven\nsubjects where the effect was significant, the increase was smaller by a\nfactor of\u00184 than that seen in iontophoresis with either of the vasodila-\ntors ACh or SNP. The average blood flows, stimulated and basal values,\nfor all subjects and six configurations are shown in Fig. 2(b).\nThe averaged blood flow measured in each of the subjects is shown\nfor different forms of iontophoresis in Table II. Statistical analyses were\nperformed to assess the possibility of correlations between voltage and\nblood flow. Although 11 subjects is hardly a sufficient number for se-\nrious correlation analysis, it may be of interest that we did not observe\nany statistically significant correlation for any mode of iontophoresis.\nThe analyses were repeated for each individual, while considering the\nsix modes of iontophoresis, again with a null result in each case.\nThe polarity that produced greater voltage was associated with\na smaller blood flow when deionized H2O was used. Cathodal\niontophoresis resulted in increased average blood flow, although\nnot significantly greater than the blood flow obtained during anodal\ncurrent (p = 0:1). At the same time, the average voltage was slightly\ngreater during anodal iontophoresis but, again, not significantly\n(p = 0:3). When the group values are compared for the NaCl, it can\nbe seen that a slightly higher, but not significant (p = 0:4), average\npotential difference is obtained during anodal iontophoresis, while the\naverage blood flow values were comparable. Although the voltage\nwas significantly higher during ACh compared to SNP iontophoresis\n(p < 0:05), this difference was not reflected in the average blood flow\nvalues (p = 0:4). Average blood flow values during iontophoresis\nwith ACh are slightly higher, but not significantly (p = 0:4), than\nthose obtained with SNP.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe results obtained appear to be consistent with earlier work [7],\n[8], although the different current delivery protocol used in the latter,\nand the fact that the individual voltages needed to deliver particular\nsubstances could not be separated, makes direct comparison difficult.\nThe group median values of average voltages during iontophoresis\nwith deionized H2O are 15.0 V for anodal current and 12.5 V for\ncathodal current. These values are slightly higher than the median\nvalues of voltages during iontophoresis with saturated NaCl, which\nare 11.1 V for anodal and 9.7 V for cathodal currents. It seems, at first\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 51, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2004 1685\nFig. 2.

The inset in (b) shows\naverage values of basal blood flow measured simultaneously in unstimulated\nskin several cm from the iontophoresis chambers. The boxes have lines at\nthe lower quartile, median and upper quartile values. The whiskers extend\nfrom each end of the box and their maximal length is set to 1.5 times the\nsize of the box. Outlier values are presented as + . The probability that\nthe potential difference is the same for all tested substances and polarities,\nevaluated by ANOVA, is 0.009. This means that out of six data sets, at least\none is significantly different from the others. The probability obtained by\nnonparametric, unpaired Wilcoxon test from a pair of data sets is marked as\nif 0:05 > p \u0015 0:01 and for p < 0:01. The overall difference between\naverage blood flow values obtained in six different measurements, tested by\nANOVA, is highly significant (p = 0). The average blood flow values obtained\nduring iontophoresis with ACh or SNP differ significantly (p < 0:05) from\nthose obtained during iontophoresis with H O and NaCl using both polarities,\nbut there is no significant difference between the flows during ACh and SNP\n(p = 0:4). On the other hand, the basal blood flow values do not differ\nsignificantly for any of the six recordings.\nTABLE II\nSUMMARY OF DATA FOR THE 11 SUBJECTS, SHOWING THEIR AVERAGED\nBLOOD FLOW (ARBITRARY UNITS) DURING DIFFERENT FORMS OF\nIONTOPHORESIS. IN EACH DATA-SET THE MEDIAN VALUE IS EMBOLDENED\nsight, surprising that the measured voltages should all fall within a\nrange that is so much narrower than the enormous range in the con-\nductance of the two electrolytes. At the two extremes, NaCl solution\nis of very low resistance, whereas deionized H2O is in principle an\ninsulator. Using exactly the same current delivery protocol, but with\nthe electrodes immersed in bulk electrolyte in a Petri dish:\n1) for deionized H2O, the Moor iontophoresis controller was able\nto deliver only 25\u201328 \u0016A, rather than the chosen 100 \u0016A, and\nthe voltage was out of range;\n2) with NaCl solution, the voltage was too small to measure reli-\nably, being only about twice the background noise level.\nThis behavior is exactly what was to be expected, given the difference\nof many orders of magnitude in the relative conductances. The fact\nthat (initially) deionized H2O does not behave as a near-insulator in\niontophoresis through skin is presumably because ions are quickly ac-\nquired from\/through the skin itself.\nThe relatively small range of voltages, and the fact that they vary\nsystematically between individuals (Table I) suggest that, at least for\nthe current protocol used in the present study, the conductance of the\nelectrolyte is relatively unimportant. The main contribution to the re-\nsistance is probably that of the transdermal barrier.\nOur statistical analyses revealed no correlation between voltage and\nblood flow. It would seem, therefore, that the changes in blood flow\nthat are sometimes observed in the absence of vasoactive agents are not\nattributable to subcutaneous ohmic heating in those subjects for whom\nthe voltage needed to drive iontophoresis is relatively large.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAlthough many details remain to be explored, the main question mo-\ntivating this investigation can be answered unambiguously. At least for\nthe conditions applying in the present investigation, the magnitude of\nthe voltage needed to sustain the chosen iontophoresis current is not\nan important factor in causing changes in blood flow. This conclusion\nmay be expected to apply, not only to neutral agents such as H2O or\nNaCl solution, but also in iontophoretic drug delivery.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to all the subjects who volunteered and they\nacknowledge valuable discussions and help from R.
