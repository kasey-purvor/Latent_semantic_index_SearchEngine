Its starting\npoint is that although much of the literature about effective leadership\npractice focuses on leadership behaviours, little is written about the way in\nwhich those behaviours are actually enacted. The musician, Bobby\nMcFerrin serves as a case study for identifying three key aspects of\nleading beautifully: mastery, congruence between form and content, and\npurpose. These are further considered through reference to the concept\nof beauty as theorised by the philosophers Plato and Plotinus. The paper\nthen considers how \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 might differ from other\nconceptualisations of leadership and discusses the particular insight it\nbrings to understanding the nature of leading as a relational phenomenon.\nKeywords: Aesthetics, Beauty, Embodiment, Leading as Artful Practice,\nPerformance\n3Leading Beautifully: How Mastery, Congruence and Purpose Create the\nAesthetic of Embodied Leadership Practice\nMuch of the leadership canon attends to behavioural aspects of leading:\nthe leader creates and imparts a \u2018vision\u2019 (Bryman 1992, Drath 2001) he or she\nmotivates and directs followers (Hersey & Blanchard 1977, Bennis & Nanus\n1985). According to Bass (1985) he or she enables followers to achieve higher\naims through transformational practices, and for adherents of \u2018servant leadership\u2019\n(Greenleaf 1970) the leader acts as an enabler, facilitating followers\u2019 purposeful\naction by removing obstacles or providing necessary resources.\nRather less appears about how leaders actually enact these behaviours\u2014\nthe embodied way in which they attempt to motivate, direct, or transform. In fact,\nas highlighted by Sinclair (2005) to a large extent \u2018leaders\u2019 are theorised as\ndisembodied beings. She suggests:\n\u2026although leadership has been constructed as an activity of brains\nwithout bodies\u2026It is a bodily practice, a physical performance in addition\nto a triumph of mental or motivational mastery\u2026leadership works at a\nvisceral and sensual level, activating appetites and desires. ..The\naccomplishment of leadership is often highly dramatic and full-bodied;\nthere is intimacy, titillation, sometimes mystique (387- 388).\n4This paper explores the territory of leading as an embodied activity\nthrough the lens of aesthetic perception. A key assumption underpinning its\nargument is that the quality of a leader\u2019s performance can be judged according to\nits aesthetic dimension, as well as the more commonly recognised operational,\nsymbolic, political, or moral ones. Followers perceive the elegance,\nawkwardness, comedy, or beauty of a leader\u2019s performance even as they judge\nits relevance and effectiveness. The suggestion is made that the aesthetic\ndimension of a leader\u2019s bearing can be particularly important in those situations\nin which the leader has relatively less positional power, and must rely on referent\npower (French and Raven 1959) instead. This possibility is highlighted as a key\narea for further study.\nAs a starting point for exploring the aesthetics of leadership practice, the\npaper focuses on the aesthetic category of \u2018the beautiful\u2019. Hillman (1998)\nargues that \u2018beauty\u2019 is one of the most repressed and taboo concepts in our\nsecularised and materialistic times. Certainly, within the domain of organisation\nstudies, beauty is not a construct commonly associated with leading or\nleadership. Yet, quoting from Plato, Hillman argues that beauty \u2018reminds us of\nour wings, it inspires us, lifting the mind to permanent values and eternal truths.\u2019\n(261) This aspiration seems to align itself with concepts such as \u2018charismatic\u2019\n(Weber 1947) or \u2018authentic leadership\u2019 (Avolio and Gardner 2005). I will argue\nhowever, that although similar to these notions, \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 distinguishes\nitself from them in key ways.\n5The paper explores what \u2018the beautiful\u2019 might mean in terms of the\nenactment of leadership both experientially and theoretically. It begins with a\ndescriptive account of a leadership performance perceived as \u2018beautiful\u2019. This\naccount is then analysed and linked to idealised notions of \u2018the beautiful\u2019\noriginating in Classical Western philosophy. \u2018Leading beautifully\u2019 is then\ncontrasted with similar theories in order to highlight the unique insight it\ncontributes to our understanding of the practice of leading. By way of illustrating\nwhat might constitute \u2018leading beautifully\u2019, I\u2019ll begin with a story.\nBobby McFerrin: A Case Study of Leading Beautifully\nDuring the summer of 2005 I had the pleasure of attending Prom 32 at the\nRoyal Albert Hall in London, which featured the a capella vocalist, Bobby\nMcFerrin, performing in collaboration with a jazz band and the African Children\u2019s\nChoir. I\u2019d attended his concert at the Proms in 2003, when he\u2019d conducted the\nVienna Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as singing the second cello part of a\nVivaldi double concerto. He\u2019d struck me then as being a particularly engaging\n6performer. I\u2019d been especially taken by how he managed to conduct the staid\nmembers of the Vienna Phil through a sung rendition of the William Tell Overture.\nIt was a moment of sheer delight when the predominantly white-haired Austrian\nmusicians laid their instruments on their laps and began singing their parts\u2014\n\u2018oom-pahing\u2019 their way through the final chorus. I left the Hall wondering how\nMcFerrin had achieved the level of rapport with the orchestra\u2019s members to\nenable them to relax their inhibitions in this way. Earlier in the performance he\nhad orchestrated an impromptu rendition of the Salve Regina which involved the\naudience singing the melody while he intoned the organ part below. This had\nbeen accomplished without his uttering a word. Instead, he communicated his\nintent through gestures, inviting us to join him in making music as if to do so were\ncompletely natural.\nDuring the more recent performance he performed alongside two other\ngroups of musicians, a New York jazz band and the African Children\u2019s Choir.\nAgain, he engaged the audience in the performance. Before I\u2019d realised what or\nhow it had happened, I found myself\u2014along with the vast majority of the Hall\u2019s\noccupants, echoing back his vocalisations, stomping my feet and clicking my\nfingers in response to his gestures. How was he able to lead us in such an\nunobtrusive way?\nWe were, admittedly, a willing group. We\u2019d all chosen to attend that\nparticular performance, probably because of our expectation of the man and his\nstyle of performance. It was a relaxed Sunday afternoon, there was a relatively\nlarge proportion of children in the audience. Even so, having the majority of\n7those present in the Royal Albert Hall responding to a flick of a wrist, and to have\nachieved this relationship so discretely, I found impressive.\nIn describing what McFerrin did, I would suggest there was more than\n\u2018effectiveness\u2019 going on. There was a quality of engagement which I experienced\nas \u2018nourishing\u2019. McFerrin is charismatic, certainly\u2014but his is a soft kind of\ncharisma. I noticed how in working with his fellow musicians, he never seemed\nto dominate or take control of them. When he was not performing directly, he\noften stood at the back of the stage, nodding along to the beat. During the\nencore he insisted on not occupying centre stage himself, but instead, the jazz\nmusicians and he joined the African Children\u2019s Choir in their rendition of the\nAfrican Anthem. McFerrin stood in the back row, singing along to the words as\nhe could grasp them under the direction of the young African woman who\nconducted the choir. I reflected on how he could lead the audience in an\nimpromptu rendering of the Salve Regina, but in a different situation, seem just\nas comfortable taking the lead from someone else.\nI experienced his performance as embodying a way of leading which was\ninclusive, accepting, and creating of a safe environment. Throughout the concert\nMcFerrin seemed very present to the moment at hand. For instance, during one\nof his vocal improvisations while singing nonsense syllables, a baby in the\naudience began crying. I wondered whether he would respond in any way, and\nin a moment he did, working into his improvisation\u2014\u2018the baby\u2019s crying\u2019. After a\nfew more bars he sang, \u2018it will be all right, it will be all right\u2019. The audience\nresponded with warm laughter. He seemed to work with the present in such a\n8way that I experienced now as rich ground, pregnant with potential for something\nnew and creative to happen. This contrasts sharply with so much of the\nleadership literature which emphasises the leader\u2019s ability to envision the \u2018future\u2019.\nInstead, McFerrin brought my full attention to the possibilities and potentialities of\nthe present moment.\nHow did he enact leadership?\nFirstly, McFerrin is a consummately skilled musician whose expertise\nspans a range of musical genres from jazz to classical. His mastery is attested to\nboth by the awards he has achieved (such as an Emmy for his popular hit \u2018Don\u2019t\nWorry, Be Happy\u2019) but more importantly for the purposes of this paper\u2014for the\nlevel of esteem granted to him by fellow musicians. The Vienna Philharmonic\nOrchestra is not an organisation who would easily respond to a less skilled\nmusician at their helm.\nAs well as exercising mastery within the musical sphere, he demonstrated\ndistinctive skills of communication. Much leadership literature focuses on verbal\naspects of communication; getting the message \u2018right\u2019 in terms of its content.\nMcFerrin never spoke to us. He communicated through gestures, vocal\ninflections, and the way he used his body. His body language was inclusive,\nthere was an openness and a lack of guardedness in the way he loped around\nthe stage.\nHis self presentation (on both occasions he wore black jeans and a t-shirt,\nin sharp contrast to the more formally attired orchestral musicians) seemed\ncongruent with his overall style and purpose\u2014for certainly part of his purpose\n9was to disrupt us as an audience, to invite us to engage beyond the constraints\nof conventional performance rituals. But his style of disruption was gentle, playful\nand non-aggressive. It was aligned with what could be inferred as his purpose\nfor that afternoon\u2014to involve all of those attending his performance to join in the\nprocess of music making.\nMcFerrin\u2019s performance highlights for me three aspects which seem key to\nthe enactment of \u2018leading beautifully\u2019:\n\uf0b7 Mastery: both in terms of a mastery in understanding one\u2019s context\nand domain and mastery of the self. To be masterful in this way\nrequires attention to the here-and-now possibilities inherent within\nany given moment. In this way, leading beautifully incorporates\nexpertise.\n\uf0b7 Coherence: expressing the self through forms which are congruent\nwith one\u2019s overall message and purpose. This requires attending\nnot only to what one says but the way one says it. In this way,\nleading beautifully incorporates authenticity.\n\uf0b7 Purpose: attending to the goal towards which one is leading. Is the\ngoal one that serves the best interests of the human condition? In\nfact, is the goal itself \u2018beautiful\u2019? In this way, leading beautifully\nbrings into play the ethical dimension of a leader\u2019s endeavor.\nThese aspects identified as contributing to Bobby McFerrin\u2019s leadership\nstyle find support in Classical philosophical conceptions of the beautiful. The\npaper now turns to explore these connections in more detail.\n10\nThe Beautiful\u2014Insights from Plato and Plotinus\nNotions of the beautiful are situated in cultural, historic and societal\nlocations\u2014over time, \u2018the beautiful\u2019 as applied to human bodies in particular has\nfluctuated according to taste and fashion. In considering how beauty might relate\nto leading, in the first instance I am posing the question, \u2018What is beauty?\u2019.\nThe philosophers Plato (428-348 BC) and the neo-Platonist, Plotinus (205-270\nAD) are key here, as both set out to understand the nature of beauty itself, rather\nthan the nature of beautiful things. These philosophers\u2019 writings are also\nvaluable to my study because their work seeks to address \u2018 the beautiful\u2019 as\nexpressed not only in paintings or musical compositions, but as an essence\nwhich could imbue human form as well as art works and nature. Similarly, I\u2019m\ninterested to tease out something of the essence of beauty which might be\nrelevant to leadership performance.\nIn Carritt\u2019s (1931) landmark collection of philosophical writings about\nbeauty, he asserts that Plato \u2018helps us more than later writers to make up our\nminds on this question (of what is beauty)\u2019 (xv). He elaborates on this writing:\nPlato was convinced that it is by no linguistic accident that we call various\nthings beautiful. We really recognize in them one common character, and\nthis character, he thought, must be capable of definition\u2026To Plato beauty\nis not just truth or edification, beauty is not a physical thing, like gold, but\nrather some relation of things to our minds, perhaps to our purposes (xvi)\nThis quote highlights two important issues in considering leading through\nthe aesthetic lens of the beautiful. Firstly, it suggests that as conceptualized by\n11\nPlato, the experience of beauty is not just a subjective evaluation, that there is a\n\u2018common character\u2019 present in those things which we would describe as\nbeautiful. Secondly, it suggests the relational nature of beauty, pointing out that\nwe experience the beautiful as such because it is connected to our own minds, or\npurposes in a particular way. In the next section of this paper, I\u2019ll explore the first\nof these points, and offer suggestions from Plato and Plotinus about what\nconstitutes the \u2018common character\u2019 of beauty.\nIt is important to note that Plato does not offer a finalized definition of\nbeauty, but instead takes us through logical arguments in which the notion is\nteased out through dialogues between Socrates and various students. For\ninstance, In Hippias Major, (1982) Plato presents Socrates interrogating Hippias\nabout the nature of beauty. Each time Hippias arrives at an answer, Socrates\nposes yet another instance in which Hippias\u2019 conclusion is proven deficient.\nBeauty is not \u2018a beautiful girl\u2019, it is not the gilding of something in gold, it is not\npurely defined by something\u2019s usefulness, or by its \u2018pleasantness\u2019 from a visual\nor auditory perspective. Through their discussion however, key aspects of\nbeauty are identified. The first of these is the relationship between the beautiful\nand the ethical.\nBeauty and its Relationship to the Ethical\nIn order to understand the relationship Plato asserts between the beautiful\nand the ethical, it is important to understand one of his fundamental\npresuppositions, his \u2018Theory of Forms\u2019. Murdoch (1992) writes that Platonic\n\u2018Forms\u2019 are \u2018models, archetypes: universals, general concepts as distinct from\n12\nparticular entities, and in their ethical role, (they are) moral ideals active in our\nlives, radiant icons, images of virtue\u2019 (10). Plato remarks on the particular power\nof beauty as a Form in Phaedrus (1986) when Socrates says to Phaedrus:\n\u2026but on the subject of beauty \u2013 as we said, it shone out in company with\nthose other things, and now that we have come to earth we have found it\ngleaming most clearly through the clearest of our senses. For of all the\nsensations coming to us through the body, sight is the keenest: wisdom\nwe do not see-- beauty alone has acquired this privilege, of being most\nevident and most loved (250).\nGiven that sight is the keenest of our senses then, Plato suggests that we\nare particularly attuned to those things which please our sight. But Plato\u2019s use of\nthe word sight is more encompassing than as just a sensory experience. Plato\noften used the word sight as a metaphor for \u2018intellect\u2019 (Gosling, 2006). Thus, for\nPlato, the beautiful pleases not just our senses, but also our Intellect, which for\nPlato was itself a Form, that of \u2018Purified Mind\u2019. For Plato, intellect itself is\nbeautiful, and recognizes beauty because it is akin to itself. Plotinus notes a\nsimilar parallel between the beautiful and the soul in his Ennead I.6:\nIt must be therefore that, since the soul\u2019s nature is what it is, and ranks\namong the highest essences in the order of things, when she sees\nsomething akin to herself or even a vestige of kinship she rejoices and\nflutters her wings, and receives it within her, and remembers her true self\nand that which is hers (5).\n13\nThe link Plato makes between beauty and purified mind, and which\nPlotinus makes between beauty and the soul, necessitates the connection\nbetween beauty and the good. By Plato\u2019s definition, beauty cannot be used for\nbad ends. Plato points this out in Socrates\u2019 conversation with Hippias, when\nHippias has asserted that a thing is \u2018beautiful\u2019 to the extent that it works efficiently\nand is useful. Through further discussion, Socrates asserts:\n\u2026 to be beautiful it is enough for a thing to be efficient and useful. But\nwhat we meant in our hearts to say was really this, that what is useful and\nefficient for some good purpose is beautiful? (296)\nHere Plato clearly links the beautiful with the moral. In order to be beautiful, an\naction, or way of being must have the purpose of being good.\nThe link between the beautiful and the ethical carries on into contemporary\nphilosophical writings (Moore 1903, Murdoch 1992) and can even be found within\nthe business ethics literature. For instance Dobson (1999) argues that aesthetic\ndevelopment is a key path to developing virtue, and it is virtue which should act\nas the means by which organizational decisions are taken. He writes:\nrather than economic or moral rules, what guides the manager-as-artisan is\nthe pursuit of internal goods; the nurturing of the aesthetic relation (163).\nLikewise, I am arguing here that \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 incorporates aiming towards\nethical purposes. However, here I am similarly taking a Classical view of \u2018ethics\u2019,\none that is grounded in notions of \u2018the good life\u2019 and \u2018human flourishing\u2019, rather than\nstrict adherence to rule-based norms. From this standpoint, leading beautifully\ncould be seen as an ethical aim in itself. This raises the question of how leading\n14\nbeautifully is created, and a starting point is the connection between the purpose\none has, and the way in which it is embodied.\nFitness of Purpose\nAccording to many Classical philosophers, beauty arises when there is\ncongruence between an entity\u2019s or act\u2019s purpose and how that purpose is\nembodied. The following passage from Hippias Major (1982) elaborates on this,\nas Socrates and Hippias discuss Pheidias\u2019 representation of Athene,\nS: (Pheidias was a good artist, but) he did not make Athene\u2019s eyes of\ngold, nor the rest of her face, nor the hands and feet, but of ivory, though\ngold would have made her look more beautiful. And this mistake must\nhave been due to his ignorance of the fact that, as you say, it is gold which\ngives beauty to everything. What are we to say, Hippias?\nH: Nothing very difficult. We shall say that Pheidias was quite right. For I\nsuppose ivory is beautiful too.\nS: But why did he work the eyeballs not in ivory but in stone, exquisitely\nmatching the stone to the ivory. Or is beautiful stone beauty too?\nH: In its right place, we must agree that it is.\nS: Then, does your wisdom come to this, that ivory and gold make things\nbeautiful when they are appropriate, but otherwise ugly? (289)\nIn an earlier version of Socrates\u2019 philosophy, Xenophon (430-350 BC)\npresents a dialogue between Socrates and Aristippus in which they come to\nagreement that even a \u2018dung basket\u2019 can be a beautiful thing, if it is beautifully\nfitted to its purpose (Xenophon 1990).\n15\nLikewise, this suggests that a key aspect of leading beautifully will be\ndetermined by the extent to which the leader acts in a way which \u2018fits\u2019 his or her\npurpose. For example, consider a leader who might not be thought of as\nconventionally \u2018beautiful\u2019, such as Mo Mowlam, the former British Minister of\nParliament who held a pivotal leadership role in the Northern Ireland peace\nprocess. A legendary story of Ms Mowlam\u2019s involvement with that process tells\nof how, at a particularly crucial point in the negotiations, she removed her wig\n(which she\u2019d been wearing having lost her hair due to chemotherapy treatments)\nand began thumping it on the table to reinforce her point. Conventional ideas\nmight not judge this a beautiful act , but perhaps, given the context within which\nshe was working, it ideally fit her purpose.\nAdditionally, it was behavior which was not out of keeping with Mowlam\u2019s\nreputation as an outspoken, unconventional politician. Her act was congruent\nwith both the immediate moment, and with how she was known to be. In that\nway, it could be seen to be authentic\u2014it \u2018rang true\u2019 to the others present at the\nmeeting. It is also the moment which is mythologised as catalyst for breaking the\ndeadlock in the negotiations. Perhaps it also reflects Ms Mowlam\u2019s expertise at\nreading the situation, which indicates a third aspect of leading beautifully,\n\u2018mastery\u2019.\nMastery\nHere, the notion of mastery is explored from two different angles, firstly,\nhow mastery connects with ideas of \u2018form\u2019, and secondly, how it fits with ideas of\n\u2018measure\u2019. Throughout Classical writings philosophers refer to beauty being the\n16\nresult of harmonious \u2018form\u2019. An entity, or an act, is beautiful because it adheres\nto a particular \u2018form\u2019, one which is harmonious, symmetrical and pleasing. For\ninstance, Plotinus comments in distinguishing between the beautiful and the ugly,\nthat those things which are beautiful adhere to a certain \u2018form\u2019 or \u2018reason\u2019:\n\u2018the beautiful\u2019 is created through the harmonious proportion of parts to\neach other and the whole thing must have pleasing coloring (1984: 4).\nHe further asserts that we can tell the difference between the beautiful and the\nugly by reference to the way each relates to form:\n\u2018the ugly is that which is not dominated by its form and reason, when its\nmatter will not allow it to be completely molded to its form. (Plotinus 1984:\n5).\nIn considering leading beautifully, the notion of \u2018form\u2019 might relate to mastery\nwithin the domain in which a leader operates. Bobby McFerrin, for instance, is a\nmaster at the \u2018form\u2019 of creating music. He is so expert within the form that he can\nattend carefully to the sphere within which he is performing, and express the form\nin the most fitting way for a specific context. Likewise, once organizational\nleaders have mastered a functional domain, they can turn their attention to\ndiscerning how their expertise might be best used within a given situation.\nMastery from a leadership perspective might also extend to other, more\ncontextually-based areas of domain competence. For instance, a leader may\nhave mastered the reading of organizational politics, or may be particularly expert\nat building strong relationships with key stakeholder groups.\n17\nA second aspect of such mastery discussed by both Plato and Plotinus\nconcerns \u2018measure\u2019. This is about knowing \u2018how much\u2019 of a certain act is\nbeautiful, as opposed to being either stingy or excessive. Making such a\njudgment requires attention to the present, for only accurate reading of the here\nand now can alert someone to what might constitute the appropriate measure in\na given moment.\nIn his Dialogue \u2018The Statesman\u2019, Plato (1995) elaborates on this idea,\nwriting:\n\u2018When a maker commands his art he can judge the excellence of his\nproduct according to his insight into proportion and measure.\nFundamentally then, the artist must, if he is to work well, know the nature\nof Measure. For to know the proper length of a speech, the proper\nproportion of a painting, the proper distribution of functions in a society,\nthe proper organization of a poem, is to command the art of\nmeasurement.\u2019 (285)\nHofstadter and Kuhns (1964: 4) suggest that for Plato, \u2018measure\u2019\nembraces the principles of the good and the beautiful\u2019 and knowing the measure\nof something is essential to producing it beautifully. Such a sensibility could be\nappreciated as a key feature of mastery, of knowing what, in a particular\ncircumstance, is the \u2018right\u2019 amount of interaction, the length of the speech, the\nloudness of the crescendo. Acting on such discernment differentiates between\nactions or intonations which are fitting, which add to the overall shape and form\nof a performance, and those acts which are distracting and detracting.\n18\nHere, then, I am suggesting that leading beautifully demonstrates mastery\nat two levels. Firstly, the leader exhibits expertise within a \u2018form\u2019\u2014that form may\nbe a field of professional expertise, such as McFerrin\u2019s musical mastery, or it may\nbe mastery of a particular skill, such as influencing others or building\nrelationships. Secondly, leaders who lead beautifully are attentive to how \u2018much\u2019\nof a certain action, or gesture, or communication is necessary. Sometimes,\nparadoxically, leading beautifully requires minimal, rather than maximum action,\nas illustrated by the following story.\nIn exploring ideas of leading beautifully, a manager spoke about attending\na conference in Atlanta, Georgia to hear Warren Bennis. The day in question\nwas hot and humid and the air conditioning had broken down in the room in\nwhich Bennis was speaking. Sitting in the audience was uncomfortable and\nthere was a good deal of fidgeting and shuffling during the opening minutes of\nBennis\u2019s talk. About twenty minutes into the presentation, Bennis paused. \u2018This\nisn\u2019t going very well is it?\u2019 he asked the crowd. There were muffled non-\ncommittal replies. \u2018Well, what should I do?\u2019 he asked. Someone suggested, \u2018turn\nthe mic over to us.\u2019 Bennis did so. The group proceeded to self-organize into\nsmaller work groups, distribute themselves throughout cooler rooms in the\nbuilding, and accomplish a good afternoon\u2019s work. The teller of the story\nrecounted how he felt this was \u2018beautiful\u2019 on Bennis\u2019s part, that it was an apt and\nskilled response to the circumstances. What particularly impressed the teller\nwas that Bennis was able to relax his own ego concerns and provide the space\nfor the group to decide how best to use the time. Paradoxically, choosing not to\n19\ncontinue speaking demonstrated, at least to this observer, Bennis\u2019s mastery as a\nspeaker.\nSuch mastery, along with congruence between an act\u2019s form and its\npurpose weave through both the experience of \u2018beauty\u2019 and the way it has been\nconceptualized by Plato and Plotinus. The paper now moves on to consider how\nleading beautifully compares with other leadership theories which occupy similar\nterritory.\nLeading Beautifully\u2014Adding New Insight to Existing Theory?\nAlthough the aesthetic dimension of organizational dynamics is a relatively\nnew departure (Gagliardi 1996, Linstead and Hopfl 2000, Strati 1999,) there is\nlittle writing devoted specifically to the aesthetics of leadership (Duke 1986) or\nmore particularly to what leading beautifully might entail. However, there are a\nnumber of theories which offer similar ways of thinking about leading and\nleadership, including:\n\uf0b7 Leading as a performing art\n\uf0b7 Charismatic leadership\n\uf0b7 Authentic leadership\n\uf0b7 Impression management\nEach is contrasted with \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 in the following section of the paper.\nLeading as a Performing Art\nGrint (2000) suggests that leadership should be considered more of an\nart-form than a science, and highlights four particular art-forms which it emulates:\nthe philosophical arts, the fine arts, the martial arts, and finally, the performing\n20\narts. The performing arts take into account the way things are said, including\naspects such as gesture and tonal inflection as well as the use of symbols to\nconvey meanings. Grint argues that the performative dimension of leading\nmoves the hearts and minds of followers.\nAlthough Grint makes the case for the importance of this performative\ndimension, he does little to map the territory or explain how effective\nperformances are created. The notion of leading beautifully I\u2019m offering here\ncould be seen to build on Grint\u2019s work in attempting to articulate particular\naspects (mastery, congruence, and purpose) which contribute to the\nperformance dimension.\nCharismatic Leadership\nUndoubtedly, leading beautifully can be experienced as charismatic.\nLadkin (2006 ), writes about possible linkages between the charismatic and the\n\u2018sublime\u2019 aesthetic experience. A key point made in that writing is that in both\nWeber\u2019s theorization of charisma (1947) , and Kant\u2019s theorization of the sublime\n(2005) , there is a recognition of a \u2018negative pleasure\u2019 associated with each\nexperience. The sublime cannot be wholeheartedly embraced without a\nconcurrent experience of discomfort. Likewise, Weber (1947) suggests that in\nthe engagement with a charismatic leader, the follower experiences a loss of\nself, a kind of obliterating of one\u2019s individual identity, which is not an altogether\npleasant experience. In contrast to this, philosophers through the ages have\nnoted how the experience of the beautiful can be wholeheartedly enjoyed without\ndiscomfiture or unease (Kant 2005, Burke 1990, Scarry 1999).\n21\nFurthermore, charisma can operate in such a way that the follower loses\nhis or her own sense of identify through identification with the leader. Instead of\nbeing a soul-affirming experience, engagement with extreme versions of\ncharisma can veer into the soul-destroying, as witnessed by the \u2018shadow side\u2019 of\ncharismatic power (Kets de Vries 2004) . Charismatic leaders can align their\npurposes to self-serving and harmful ends, whereas for leading to be beautiful, I\nam arguing it must be in the aid of the best of human purposes. The ethical\nrequirement of leading beautifully also differentiates it from another perceptual\ndynamic, impression management.\nImpression Management\nThe charismatic has been linked to a third area of literature which\nintersects the notion of leading beautifully, \u2018impression management\u2019. Sosik,\nAvolio and Jung (2002) outline the components of impression management and\npresent evidence indicating that certain behaviors charismatic leaders engage in\ncan be seen to increase the chances that followers will attribute charisma to\nthem.\nAn example of how effective leaders manage their images can be seen in\nRichard Branson, who writes openly in his recent autobiography (Branson 2005)\nabout the role impression management played in the establishment of the Virgin\nbrand. For instance, Branson reveals that in the early days of running Virgin, he\nwould regularly use pay telephones when calling important clients. He would ring\nthe operator, claiming he\u2019d lost his money in the phone, which then required the\noperator to connect the call. On being transferred, the operator would inevitably\n22\nsay to the person answering the call, \u2018I have Mr Branson for you\u2019, thereby\ncreating the impression that Branson had a PA dedicated to placing his\ntelephone calls. Similarly, when speaking on the telephone to potential clients,\nhe would arrange for someone to call out from the other side of the office \u2018Ted\nHeath is on the other line wanting to talk with you,\u2019 thus suggesting that Branson\ninteracted with well-placed figures in the British government.\nAlthough such behaviors may portray a favorable impression, their\ndeceitful element would preclude their falling within the definition of leading\nbeautifully I am offering here. Jones & Pittman (1982) suggest this type of self\npromoting impression management is often used at another\u2019s expense, a tactic\nwhich demotivates followers in the long run. This raises an important aspect of\nboth impression management and the perception of a leader\u2019s aesthetic: in each\ncase it is the follower who ultimately has the impression, or judges the aesthetic.\nThe distinction between the impression an individual aims to produce,\nand how onlookers actually read a given behavior is captured by the distinction\nGoffman (1959) makes between the impression a person \u2018gives\u2019 and that which\nshe or he \u2018gives off\u2019. Although an individual can control what they \u2018give\u2019, i.e.\nBranson decided to behave in certain ways to try to create a certain impression;\nhe or she cannot control what is \u2018given off\u2019, i.e. the sense onlookers make of the\nbehaviors. This dynamic aspect of perception is a key feature of leading\nbeautifully, and also features largely in the experience of \u2018authentic leadership\u2019,\nexplored in greater detail below.\nAuthentic leadership\n23\nIn the wake of corporate misbehaviors such as those exemplified by\nEnron, Shell and Worldcom, a burgeoning literature has grown focused on\n\u2018authentic\u2019 leadership. Shamir and Eilam (2005) suggest that although there are\na number of differing definitions of authentic leadership, the link between the\nleader\u2019s values and behaving ethically is at the heart of the majority of this\nliterature. From this perspective, authenticity is determined over time, as\nfollowers judge the extent to which a leader acts consistently, reliably takes\ncertain stances, and behaves in accordance with organizational and societal\nnorms.\nI\u2019m suggesting here that authenticity also operates aesthetically, and as\nsuch will be determined very quickly. For instance, followers \u2018get a sense\u2019 of\nwhether or not a leader is trustworthy from their \u2018gut reaction\u2019 to that leader. By\nreading those seemingly invisible clues embodied in a leader\u2019s stance, facial\nexpressions, bodily tension and tone of voice followers draw conclusions about a\nleader\u2019s motives, hidden agendas and unconsciously, as well as consciously\nexpressed purposes. These difficult to quantify aspects of a leader\u2019s\nperformance are gathered at a preverbal level of apprehension and create the\nleader\u2019s affective aesthetic. They add up to whether or not a follower \u2018reads\u2019 a\nleader\u2019s performance as authentic.\nEarlier in the paper authenticity, as the felt sense to which a leader was\nexpressing views coherent with their beliefs, was identified as an aspect of\nleading beautifully. What the notion of leading beautifully adds to the current\nliterature about authentic leadership is the idea that authenticity is aesthetically\n24\ndetermined, as well as being an attribute followers ascribe to leaders if they act in\naccordance with their espoused values, in a consistent manner over time.\nIn summary, considering the aesthetic dimension of leadership pushes\nextant theory by bringing into high relief the performative element of leading, and\narticulating key aspects of that performance. Moving beyond charismatic\nleadership, in order to be considered \u2018beautiful\u2019 aesthetically, leading must be\ndirected towards life enhancing purposes. Finally, \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 offers\n\u2018authentic leadership\u2019 an explanation for those split-moment apprehensions of a\nleader\u2019s authenticity. This last point alludes to the relational aspect of aesthetic\nappreciation, a point elaborated on below.\nLeading Beautifully\u2014Effects on Followers\nThe most elegant leadership performance in the world will not have the\ndesired affect if followers are more concerned with their well-being or their\nphysical comfort than paying attention to the leader. I am certain there are many\npeople who attended the Bobby McFerrin concert who did not perceive the\nbeauty of the man\u2019s style as I did. Some would have been distracted by the\nincongruity of McFerrin in that particular setting, or would have been too pre-\noccupied by their own concerns to have registered an aesthetic apprehension.\nOthers would have interpreted his performance differently from the way I\u2019ve\npresented it here. However, I was led to believe that other audience members\nhad experienced similar delight to my own by the comments I overheard and the\ngenerally relaxed and cheerful demeanor of those I passed as I left the Hall.\n25\nSomething had passed between McFerrin and his audience that day. Something\nhad evoked our willing response.\nI\u2019m attributing that something to the way McFerrin engaged with us, a way\nI have characterized as \u2018beautiful\u2019. Interrogating this dynamic as done within this\npaper could yield important clues for leaders who find themselves in similar\nsituations to McFerrin\u2019s; in which they have little positional or hierarchical power,\nlittle in the way of coercive or reward power, and where the ability to persuade\nand engage followers is generated primarily through personal power.\nTwo theories might help deconstruct this dynamic further. The first is\n\u2018Leader-member exchange theory\u2019 (LMX) (Dansereau, Graen and Haga 1975,\nGraen and Cashman 1975). A key concept within LMX theory is that leaders\nform particular relationships with followers, resulting in \u2018in-groups\u2019 and \u2018out-\ngroups\u2019 within the organization. Although those operating within in-groups may\nsuffer from jealousy due to the favoritism they enjoy, it has been shown that \u2018in\ngroups\u2019 do perform at higher than average levels of productivity and success,\nindicating that the creation of \u2018in groups\u2019 can be beneficial to organizational\nperformance (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995).\nOne of the aspects which might influence the attractiveness of a leader for\na follower to become part of the leader\u2019s in-group, is the particular aesthetic of\nthat leader. Along with benefits, \u2018in-group\u2019 membership also yields\ndisadvantages such as the expectation of longer work hours and increased\npressure to perform at exceptional levels. Part of the inter-personal glue which\nholds devoted followers could be attraction of the leader\u2019s mastery, their\n26\nadherence to ideals, or the purpose for which they stand. Although such aspects\nmay be hard to quantify, they could contribute to the mix which produces\nexemplary organizational performance.\nA second theory which offers insight into the role of beauty in inter-\npersonal perception is that produced by Rowe about the impact of what she\ncalled \u2018micro-inequalities\u2019 and \u2018micro-affirmations\u2019. Micro-affirmations are the\ndiscreet behaviours that offer encouragement and bring out the best in people\n(Rowe, 1990). They are gestures as small as holding another\u2019s glance, nodding\nwhen they are speaking, or literally patting them on the back, which demonstrate\nacceptance and approval. These are not actions which can be parroted and still\nbe experienced as authentic. Linking the performance of micro-affirmations back\nto the notion of leading beautifully, they must be enacted in a way which is\ncongruent to the leader\u2019s style, and to the right measure, in order to be perceived\nas being authentic and potentially beautiful. However, when I reflect on what\nMcFerrin DID to create the experience of leading beautifully, it was the small,\nopen gestures, the willing and unforced smile, the way he easily draped an arm\naround a young African child\u2019s shoulders, which coalesced my apprehension of\nhis performance as beautiful.\nThese two frameworks offer potential theoretical starting points for further\nexamination of how leading beautifully might both be perceived by followers, and\ncontribute to the leader-follower dynamic. For instance, it would be of potential\ninterest to explore whether \u2018in-group\u2019 members perceive the leader to generate\nan aesthetic quality to which they are drawn, and whether or not there is a shared\n27\n(but perhaps tacit) appreciation of that aesthetic among in-group members.\nSimilarly, attending to micro-gestures and how they are perceived might help to\nbuild our understanding of the aesthetic of leading from an experiential base.\nBoth LMX and Rowe\u2019s work highlight the relational aspects of leading by\ndrawing attention to the effect of a leader\u2019s way of being on followers. Likewise,\nthe significance of a beautiful performance, whether it is a leadership\nperformance or an orchestral concert, is in its impact on those beholding it.\nLeading beautifully is important, I propose, because it has the potential to move\nfollowers in ways that other embodied aesthetic forms cannot. Exploring this\nconjecture is a key focus for future research.\nLimitations and Areas for Further Research\nHere, I have used the case study of Bobby McFerrin as a starting point for\nexploring what might be meant by leading beautifully. Of course, a myriad of\ndifficulties arise from treating one case study in this way, including: the\nsingularity of my perception, my own biases and background which will have\neffected how I experienced the performance, the impossibility of generalizing\nfrom a sole experience. However, in comparing my analysis of his performance\nwith Classical views of what constitutes beauty, similar themes have arisen.\nAdditionally, there seems to be a high degree of recognition of the phenomenon\nof leading beautifully when I discuss its possibility with students and colleagues.\nIt is often recognized as a qualitative aspect of the leadership dynamic which is\nrarely articulated.\n28\nThis may be partly to do with the \u2018taboo\u2019 associated with discussing beauty\nin contemporary times. Perhaps this is because of beauty\u2019s power, the power to\narouse desire, to seduce, to sway hearts. Yet such power might have a\nparticular role to play in leadership dynamics where hierarchical power is\nabsent\u2014where a leader must resort to his or her ability to persuade by force of\npersonal power. Considering such relationships from the aesthetic perspective\nmight bring unique insights into how they work, highlighting, perhaps, the role of\npleasure, as well as desire in leader\/follower relations. These areas, along with\nthe following questions, provide rich ground for further inquiry:\n\uf0b7 Do leaders who are experienced as \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 evoke\ndistinctive responses from their followers? Could leading beautifully\nbe seen to be more effective, for instance, than leading in a way\ncharacterized as \u2018ugly\u2019 by one\u2019s followers?\n\uf0b7 How much does the experience of \u2018beautiful leadership\u2019 rely on the\nsensibilities of followers to discern it as beauty\u2014would non-\nmusicians, for instance, have been as aware of McFerrin\u2019s level of\nmastery?\n\uf0b7 What circumstances does leading beautifully most fit\u2014are there\nsituations in which \u2018ugly leadership\u2019, for instance, might be more\neffective?\n\uf0b7 If a leader aspires to leading beautifully, what must he or she pay\nattention to? Is leading beautifully something that can be\n29\ndeveloped or does every leader need to find and express his or her\nown aesthetic in order to be authentically perceived?\nConclusion\nTo consider anything beside art from an aesthetic perspective is relatively\nalien to our contemporary Western way of conceptualizing the world. Taylor\n(2002) in his study of organizational aesthetics writes of \u2018aesthetic muteness\u2019\u2014\nthe outcome of his research which indicated that people in organizations don\u2019t\nhave the language to talk about the qualitative aspect of their experience. Yet,\nthe difficulty experienced in articulating this domain of sensory experience does\nnot mean it has no impact on inter-relationships between leaders and followers.\nThe concept of \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 brings our attention to that often un-\narticulated, but nonetheless powerful aspect of how leaders embody their role.\nLeading beautifully speaks to a quality of being\u2014one honed through the\ndevelopment of self-mastery, and quickened through the congruence of one\u2019s\nacts with their \u2018measured\u2019 expression. It also alerts us to the possibility of a\nleader\u2019s goals being directed towards the best of human purposes.\nTheoretically, \u2018leading beautifully\u2019 may have a more general application as\nwell. Plato suggests that what is beautiful in a runner will not be beautiful in a\nwrestler (1982: 295), meaning that when we appreciate something as beautiful,\nwe are apprehending something of the essence of the act which they are\nperforming. Similarly, by noticing what constitutes a beautiful leadership\nperformance, perhaps we can be informed of the essence of leading itself.\n30\nThough rarely written about, leading beautifully has occurred as long as\nhuman beings have been acting together to create our communities, institutions,\nand culture. By bringing this qualitative aspect of leading to the fore, it is hoped\nthat both leaders and those who follow them might become more attentive to\nbeauty, as well as other aesthetic responses, and value those responses for the\nsensory, spiritual and moral knowledge with which they are invested.\n31\nReferences\nAvolio, B.J. & Gardner, W.L.
