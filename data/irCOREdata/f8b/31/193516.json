This \nevent is generally accepted to be mediated by the GPCR kinase \n(GRK) family in a process that results in the recruitment of \narrestin adaptor proteins to the receptor and the concomitant \nuncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G protein (Pierce \net al., 2002). In addition, GRK phosphorylation can promote \nreceptor activation of G protein\u2013independent pathways such as \nthe MAPK cascade (Wei et al., 2003).\nThis universal adaptive paradigm belies the complex na-\nture of GPCR phosphorylation and regulation. There are >340 \nnonolfactory GPCR subtypes in the mammalian genome \n(Vassilatis et al., 2003) showing widespread tissue distribution \nand infl uencing nearly every biological process from sensory \nperception to cell growth and differentiation (Wettschureck and \nOffermanns, 2005). Many of these receptors are phosphorylated \nat multiple serine, threonine (Blaukat et al., 2001; Pollok-Kopp \net al., 2003; Trester-Zedlitz et al., 2005), and occasionally tyro-\nsine residues (Fan et al., 2001). This multisite phosphorylation \nhas been reported in some instances to be hierarchical and me-\ndiated by more than one protein kinase (Rao et al., 1997; Kouhen \net al., 2000; Blaukat et al., 2001). Most enlightening have been \nstudies on GRK knockout animals that have suggested that the \nsame receptor subtype expressed in different tissues may be \nphosphorylated by a different complement of receptor kinases \n(Walker et al., 2004).\nIt is also the case that many receptor subtypes are found in \nmore than one tissue type (Vassilatis et al., 2003) and mediate \nvery specialized tissue-specifi c responses. For example, the M3-\nmuscarinic receptor regulates membrane excitability in neurons \n(Millar et al., 2000), contraction and cell growth in smooth \nmuscle cells (Gautam et al., 2005), and secretary vesicle priming \nand fusion in salivary acinar cells (Yoshimura et al., 2002; Gautam \net al., 2005). It would appear intuitive that receptors expressed \nin different cell types, controlling specifi c cellular responses, \nwould be regulated in a manner specifi c to that cell type.\nHence, a tantalizing alternative model of GPCR regulation \nis that phosphorylation is a fl exible process of receptor modifi ca-\ntion where tissue-specifi c differences in phosphorylation would \nPhosphorylation and regulation of a G protein\u2013\ncoupled receptor by protein kinase CK2\nIgnacio Torrecilla,1 Elizabeth J.

On ago-\nnist occupation, specifi c subsets of receptor phospho-\nacceptor sites (which include the SASSDEED motif in the \nthird intracellular loop) are phosphorylated by CK2. \nReceptor phosphorylation mediated by CK2 specifi cally \nregulates receptor coupling to the Jun-kinase pathway. \nImportantly, other phosphorylation-dependent receptor \nprocesses are regulated by kinases distinct from CK2. \nWe conclude that G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) \ncan be phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion \nby protein kinases from a diverse range of kinase families, \nnot just the GPCR kinases, and that receptor phosphoryla-\ntion by a defi ned kinase determines a specifi c signalling \noutcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the M3-\nmuscarinic receptor can be differentially phosphorylated \nin different cell types, indicating that phosphorylation is a \nfl exible regulatory process where the sites that are phos-\nphorylated, and hence the signalling outcome, are depen-\ndent on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed.\nCorrespondence to Andrew B.

In this paradigm, \ndifferential deployment of receptor kinases in a tissue- selective \nmanner would result in differential phosphorylation that \nwould facilitate the specifi c physiological role of that receptor \nin a particular cell type.\nOur work on the Gq\/11-coupled M3-muscarinic receptor \nhas demonstrated that this receptor subtype can be phosphory-\nlated in an agonist-dependent manner by casein kinase 1\u03b1 \n(CK1\u03b1), and this process regulates the coupling of the receptor \nto the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1\/2 pathway (Budd \net al., 2000, 2001; Tobin, 2002). These studies established that \nagonist-dependent GPCR phosphorylation could be mediated \nby protein kinases other than the GRKs (Tobin, 2002). In the \ncurrent study, we extend our investigation of the CKs in GPCR \nphosphorylation and provide evidence that protein kinase CK2 can \nalso phosphorylate the M3-muscarinic receptor. Furthermore, we \nshow that the M3-muscarinic receptor is differentially \nphosphorylated in different cell types and that the action of spe-\ncifi c receptor kinases can determine the signaling outcome of \nreceptor phosphorylation.\nResults\nInhibition of CK2 decreases M3-muscarinic \nreceptor phosphorylation\nTo investigate the role of the CK2 in M3-muscarinic receptor \nphosphorylation, we raised siRNAs against the catalytic \u03b1 and \n\u03b1\u2032 subunits of CK2. The effectiveness of the siRNAs was es-\ntablished by cotransfection of the duplexes with plasmids ex-\npressing HA-tagged \u03b1 or \u03b1\u2032 subunits. In these experiments, we \nestimated the transfection effi ciency of fl uorescently labeled \nsiRNAs to be \u000490% (unpublished data). The siRNAs desig-\nnated CK2\u03b1-4 and CK2\u03b1\u2032-1p effectively inhibited expression \nof the \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 subunits, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, \nthese siRNAs were active against the endogenously expressed \nkinase where the levels of the CK2\u03b1 subunit fell by >85% with \nno subsequent change in the levels of CK1\u03b1, GRK2, GRK3, or \nGRK6 (Fig. 1 B). This corresponded to a fall in CK2 enzymatic \nactivity of 68% compared with control (Fig. 1 C).\nWhen used in phosphorylation experiments where the \nM3-muscarinic receptor was immunoprecipitated from CHO-\nM3 cells labeled with [32P]-orthophosphate, the CK2 siRNA \nduplexes reduced agonist-mediated M3-muscarinic receptor \nphosphorylation by \u000472% compared with scrambled siRNA \ncontrols (Fig. 1, D and E). These results were confi rmed by \nraising further siRNA duplexes to different regions of \nCK2\u03b1 and -\u03b1\u2032 (Figs. S1 and S2, available at http:\/\/www.jcb\n.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200610018\/DC1).\nThe third intracellular loop of the M3-muscarinic receptor \nis a serine-rich region containing several consensus sites for \nCK1\u03b1, CK2, and the GRKs, many of which are shared between \nthese acidotropic kinases (Fig. 2 A). The ability of these kinases \nto phosphorylate the third intracellular loop is illustrated in \nFig. 2 B, where GRK6 was found to phosphorylate the GST-fusion \nprotein containing the third intracellular loop of the human \nM3-muscarinic receptor (R253-T492, called here GST-H3iloop) with \nthe highest effi ciency followed by CK1\u03b1 and then GRK2 and \nCK2 (Fig. 2 B). None of the kinases phosphorylated GST alone \n(unpublished data).\nTo confi rm of a role for CK2 in the phosphorylation of \nthe M3-muscarinic receptor, the CK2-specifi c pharmacological \ninhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB) and \n2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT; \nPagano et al., 2004; Sarno et al., 2005) were used. The selec-\ntively of these inhibitors was confi rmed in assays using the fu-\nsion protein GST-H3iloop as a substrate for CK1, CK2, GRK2, \nand GRK6 (Fig. 2 C). TBB at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM was very \npotent against CK2, reducing the level of GST-H3iloop by \n\u000475% but had only a small effect on CK1, GRK2, and GRK6 \n(Fig. 2 C). DMAT also strongly inhibited CK2 with no signifi cant \neffect on CK1 or GRK2 but was able to inhibit GRK6 by \u000445% \n(Fig. 2 C). These in vitro experiments were consistent with the re-\nported selectivity of the CK2 inhibitors and established that they \nFigure 1.

Both TBB and DMAT substantially reduced \nagonist-mediated phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic recep-\ntor by 76 and 58%, respectively (Fig. 2 D). These data are con-\nsistent with the aforementioned siRNA experiments and \ndemonstrate a role for CK2 in the phosphorylation of M3-\n muscarinic receptors.\nTo further investigate the ability of CK2 to directly phos-\nphorylate the M3-muscarinic receptor, membranes prepared \nfrom CHO-M3 cells that express recombinant human receptor \nwere reconstituted with purifi ed CK2. We noted previously that \nthese membranes maintain the ability to phosphorylate the \nM3-muscarinic receptor (Tobin et al., 1993, 1996); hence, to \nreduce the endogenous kinase activity, the membranes were \nwashed with 200 mM NaCl. Purifi ed CK2 added to these mem-\nbranes resulted in an increase in receptor phosphorylation, al-\nthough this was not agonist regulated (Fig. 2 E).\nM3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation \nin cerebellar granule (CG) neurons\nTo test whether CK2 had a role in the phosphorylation of the \nM3-muscarinic receptor in a native cell type, we investigated \nmouse CG neuronal cultures where this receptor subtype is en-\ndogenously expressed (Fohrman et al., 1993). To facilitate these \nstudies, we raised an antibody against the region S344-L462 in the \nthird intracellular loop of the mouse receptor that specifi cally \nimmunoprecipitated the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor when \ntested against all fi ve muscarinic receptor subtypes (Fig. 3 A).\nThis antibody was subsequently used in phosphorylation \nexperiments where 7-d-old mouse CG neurons were metaboli-\ncally labeled with [32P]-orthophosphate and stimulated with \nmethacholine before being solubilized and the receptor immuno-\nprecipitated. In CG neurons from wild-type mice, the M3-\nmuscarinic receptor appeared as a \u000495-kD phosphoprotein that \nincreased in the level of phosphorylation after agonist stimula-\ntion in a manner that was inhibited by the muscarinic receptor \nantagonist atropine (Fig. 3 B). In CG neurons obtained from \ntransgenic mice where the M3-muscarinic receptor gene had \nFigure 2.

Both \nTBB and DMAT reduced agonist-mediated phosphorylation \nfrom control levels of 2.47- \u00b1 0.89-fold and 2.97- \u00b1 0.06-fold \nover basal to 0.88- \u00b1 0.37-fold and 0.98- \u00b1 0.11-fold over \nbasal, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D).\nCK2 directs phosphorylation of a subset \nof sites in the intact M3-muscarinic receptor\nChymotryptic phosphopeptide maps were prepared from the \nreceptor immunoprecipitated from CHO-M3 cells under condi-\ntions where CK2 had been inhibited by siRNA knockdown \n(using CK2\u03b1-4\/CK2\u03b1\u2032-1p) or by pharmacological inhibition \n(with TBB). In these experiments (as before), quantifi cation of \nreceptor numbers by radioligand binding ensured that the same \nnumber of receptors had been immunoprecipitated from each \nsample. These maps revealed that CK2 siRNA and TBB inhib-\nited the phosphorylation of the same subset of phosphopeptides \n(Fig. 4, arrows and asterisks) while minimally affecting the phos-\nphorylation of other phosphopeptides (Fig. 4).\nSASSDEED motif in the third intracellular \nloop is a CK2 phosphoacceptor site\nThe sites of CK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation were in-\nvestigated by two-dimensional chymotryptic phosphopeptide \nmapping. We established previously that the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor is phosphorylated on serines in the third intracellular \nloop of the receptor (Budd et al., 2003). Here, we compared the \nchymotryptic phosphopeptide map of the receptor phosphory-\nlated in a cellular context by endogenous kinases in CHO-M3 \ncells with the map of a bacterial fusion protein containing the \nthird intracellular loop of the M3-muscarinic receptor (GST-\nH3iloop) phosphorylated in vitro by CK2. We know from pre-\nliminary studies that this fusion protein is phosphorylated by \nCK2 in the muscarinic receptor portion only.\nThe phosphopeptide map obtained from the phos-\nphorylated M3-muscarinic receptor, immunoprecipitated from \n[32P]-orthophosphate\u2013labeled CHO-M3 cells, was complex, with \nat least 19 distinct phosphopeptides identifi ed (Fig. 5 A, right). \nIn contrast, the phosphopeptide map from the in vitro phosphory-\nlated GST-H3iloop demonstrated just fi ve major phosphopep-\ntides (Fig. 5 A, left). Four of these phosphopeptides migrated to \nvery similar positions to phosphopeptides in the in vivo map, \nsuggesting that they may represent the same phosphopeptides \n(Fig. 5 A, asterisks). It is also of interest that the peptides that \nare shown to decrease in the level of phosphorylation in CK2 \nsiRNA\u2013treated cells (Fig. 4 A, arrows) closely correlated with \npeptides seen to be phosphorylated in vitro by CK2 (Fig. 5 A).\nEdman degradation of peptide 1 in Fig. 5 A determined \nthat it was phosphorylated in position 6 in both the in vitro sample \nFigure 3.

Similarly, for peptide 2, the major \nphosphoacceptor site was at position 15 in the in vitro and in \nvivo sample (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the fact that peptides 1 and 2 run \nin very similar positions in the phosphopeptide maps from the \nin vivo and in vitro samples and that these peptides are phos-\nphorylated at the same position (residue) indicated that they are \nthe same phosphopeptide phosphorylated in vitro by CK2 and \nin vivo by endogenous receptor kinases.\nThe occurrence of a phosphorylated serine at position 15 in \nspot 2 corresponded with a predicted chymotryptic peptide where \nthe third intracellular loop serine 351 (S351) was the 15th serine \n(Fig. 5 B). This serine is in the motif SASS351DEED, which \nis a classical CK2 consensus site (S-x-x-D\/E\/pS; Meggio and \nPinna, 2003). Generation of a bacterial fusion protein 3iloop con-\nstruct where the SASSDEED motif was mutated to AAAADEED \nresulted a fusion protein that was phosphorylated predominantly \nat just two sites (Fig. 5 C, marked A and B) compared with the \nmultisite phosphorylation seen in the wide-type fusion protein. \nIn contrast, the sites phosphorylated by CK1 were not changed \nin the AAAADEED mutant (Fig. 5 C). These data indicate that \nthe SASSDEED motif was not only a phosphoacceptor site for \nCK2 but that phosphorylation at this motif promoted further \nsubsequent \u201chierarchal\u201d phosphorylation events, a feature that is \ntypical of CK2-mediated phosphorylation.\nSimilar analysis on spot 1, where residue 6 is phosphory-\nlated, indicated that the potential phosphoacceptor sites could \nbe contained in one of two predicted chymotryptic peptides, \nwhich start with the following sequences: VHPTGS286SRS and \nELQQQS299MKRS. In the fi rst of these sequences, the serine in \nposition 6 fi ts a consensus CK2 site only if position 9 is primed \nby phosphorylation. In the second peptide, the serine in position 6 \ndoes not fi t precisely into a consensus CK2 site, although prim-\ning by phosphorylation at position 10 might be suffi cient. How-\never, there is no evidence from the Edman degradation data \npresented here that priming at these sites occurs. Nevertheless, \nCK2 might be mediating phosphorylation at these sites (even in \nthe absence of priming), a possibility that is currently being \ntested using mutants lacking these sites.\nPhosphorylation of the third intracellular \nloop by GRK2, GRK6, and CK2\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2 A, the predicted sites at which the GRKs \nand CK2 might phosphorylate the receptor show some overlap. \nTo investigate whether phosphoacceptor sites between CK2 and \nthe GRKs were in fact shared, we generated chymotryptic \nphosphopeptide maps of GST-H3iloop phosphorylated with \nGRK2 and GRK6 and compared these to maps generated after \nthe phosphorylation with CK2. The phosphorylation of the third \nintracellular loop protein by GRK2 and GRK6 appeared to occur \nat very similar sites, as determined by the fact that the phospho-\npeptides migrated to similar positions and were phosphorylated \non the same residues (i.e., spot A in GRK2 and GRK6 migrate \nto the same position and are both phosphorylated on residue 12; \nFig. 6). In contrast, CK2 phosphorylated the receptor on very \ndifferent sites, as determined by the different migration of phospho-\npeptides. In the single peptide that appeared to run in a position \nsimilar to that of the GRKs (i.e., spot 1 runs similarly to spot A; \nFig. 6), Edman degradation demonstrated that this peptide was \nphosphorylated at a different residue (i.e., residue 6) compared \nwith the residue phosphorylated by the GRKs (i.e., residue 12). \nThese data indicate that CK2 phosphorylated the third intracel-\nlular loop at sites different from the GRKs.\nCK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation \ndoes not regulate receptor internalization\nInternalization of GPCRs has long been associated with recep-\ntor phosphorylation (Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2003).

This mutant receptor, \ntermed mutant-6, was expressed normally at the cell surface, \nas determined by radioligand binding (unpublished data) and \nby biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by immuno-\nprecipitation of the biotinylated M3-muscarinic receptor (Fig. 7 A). \nFurthermore, these receptor-biotinylation experiments demon-\nstrated that immunoprecipitation of mutant-6 was as effi cient as \nthat of the wild-type receptor and that the effi ciency of immuno-\nprecipitation was not altered by ligand stimulation (Fig. 7 A). \nIn subsequent phosphorylation experiments, the ability of \nthe mutant-6 receptor to be phosphorylated in response to \nagonist was demonstrated to have been almost completely \nremoved (Fig. 7 B).\nThe loss of receptor phosphorylation in mutant-6 corre-\nlated with a loss in the ability of the receptor to be internalized \nafter prolonged treatment with agonist. As shown in Fig. 6 C, \nstimulation of CHO-M3 cells expressing the wild-type M3-\nmuscarinic receptor resulted in a decrease in cell surface receptor \nexpression, as measured by radioligand binding using the non-\nmembrane permeable antagonist [3H]-N-methylscopolamine \n(NMS). In contrast, stimulation of cells expressing mutant-6 did \nnot result in any signifi cant change in the cell surface expression \nof the receptor (Fig. 7 C). This was confi rmed using immuno-\nhistochemistry, where staining for the wild-type receptor showed \na plasma membrane localization before agonist treatment \nbut a characteristic endosomal localization after treatment with \nagonist for 30 min (Fig. 7 D). This was not the case for cells \nexpressing mutant-6, where the receptor remains at the cell \nsurface after exposure to agonist (Fig. 7 D).\nDespite the fact that these data support a role for receptor \nphosphorylation in the internalization of the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor, inhibition of CK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation \nby siRNAs directed against CK2 (Fig. 7 E) or pharmacological \ninhibition using TBB (Fig. 7 F) did not signifi cantly affect \nreceptor internalization. It appears, therefore, that receptor \nphosphorylation mediated by CK2 is not involved in receptor \ninternalization, but rather other kinases (presumably of the GRK \nfamily; Tsuga et al., 1998) are responsible for this process.\nRole of CK2-mediated receptor \nphosphorylation in coupling \nto MAPK pathways\nWe tested the role of CK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation in \nthe coupling of the M3-muscarinic receptor to the ERK1\/2 and \nJun-kinase pathways. Fig. 8 A shows that siRNA-directed ago-\nnist CK2 had no effect on the ability of the receptor to activate \nERK1\/2. In contrast, the magnitude of the Jun-kinase response \nwas signifi cantly increased after inhibition of CK2-mediated \nreceptor phosphorylation, with the maximal response being \napproximately twofold greater in cells transfected with siRNA \nagainst CK2 compared with control transfected cells (Fig. 8 B). \nSimilarly, the onset of the Jun-kinase response is faster in cells \ntransfected with CK2 siRNA, where a signifi cant response was \nevident at 10 min of agonist stimulation compared with 15 min \nin cells transfected with control scrambled siRNA (Fig. 8 B). \nImportantly, the control Jun-kinase response to sorbitol was not \naffected by CK2 inhibition (unpublished data).\nThe M3-muscarinic receptor is differentially \nphosphorylated in different cell types\nOur study indicates that CK2 is among several protein kinases \ninvolved in the phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic, each able \nto mediate a different signaling outcome (i.e., internalization\/\nJun-kinase). A natural extension of these fi ndings would be to \nhypothesize that cell type\u2013specifi c receptor phosphorylation \ncould contribute to tissue-specifi c signaling of the receptor. \nA fi rst step in testing this hypothesis would be to determine if the \nreceptor is differentially phosphorylated in different cell types. \nHence, we compared the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of \nagonist-stimulated mouse M3-muscarinic receptors derived from \ntransfected CHO cells with that of maps derived from receptors \nexpressed in mouse CG neurons.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 9, the receptor expressed in CHO \ncells was phosphorylated both basally and in response to ago-\nnist on many more sites than the receptor expressed in CG \nneurons. By comparing the migration of the spots, it can be seen \nthat several of these phosphopeptides are common in the receptor \nmaps derived from the two cell types (Fig. 9 B, marked with \nnumbers), indicating that certain receptor phosphoacceptor sites \nare conserved. However, some of these common sites are differ-\nentially regulated by agonist. Hence, the phosphopeptide marked A \nFigure 6.

Furthermore, the peptide marked B \nis agonist regulated only in CHO cells (Fig. 9 A).\nAlthough some of the phosphopeptides are common to the \ntwo cell types, others are cell type specifi c. Five examples of \nphosphopeptides identifi ed only in CHO-derived receptors are \nmarked with open arrowheads in Fig. 9 B (left), and an example \nof a phosphopeptide specifi c to CG neurons is marked with \na closed arrowhead (right).\nDiscussion\nAgonist occupation results in the multisite phosphorylation of \nGPCRs by receptor kinases in a manner often described as ho-\nmologous phosphorylation. There is now a large body of evi-\ndence to support the role of the GRK family in this process \n(Pierce et al., 2002). However, it is clear from studies using \nphosphoacceptor site mutants (Seibold et al., 2000), peptide \nmapping (Blaukat et al., 2001), mass spectrometry (Trester-\nZedlitz et al., 2005), phosphospecifi c antibodies (Pollok-Kopp \net al., 2003; Tran et al., 2004), and transgenic animals (Walker \net al., 2004) that the process of receptor phosphorylation is \ncomplex, suggesting the possibility of the involvement of pro-\ntein kinases in addition to the GRKs (Tobin, 2002).\nBy use of CK2 inhibitors and siRNA against the \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 \ncatalytic subunits of CK2, we demonstrate that CK2 contributes \nto the phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor in both a \nheterologous expression system and in mouse neurons. Further-\nmore, by using phosphopeptide maps, we show that in vitro phos-\nphorylation of the third intracellular loop of the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor by CK2 results in the phosphorylation of sites that are \nalso phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in vivo. Impor-\ntantly, these in vivo sites are seen to decrease in phosphoryla-\ntion after CK2 siRNA treatment. Finally, we show that purifi ed \nCK2 can increase the phosphorylation state of the intact M3-\nmuscarinic receptor in membranes prepared from CHO-M3 \ncells. Thus, CK2 can be added to GRK2, GRK6, and CK1\u03b1 as \na protein kinase that can phosphorylate the M3-muscarinic re-\nceptor in an agonist-dependent manner (Budd et al., 2000; Wu \net al., 2000; Willets et al., 2003).\nWhat might be the signifi cance of multikinase receptor \nphosphorylation? Despite CK1\u03b1 and CK2 sharing the same \nnomenclature, they are structurally distinct protein kinases, a fact \nhighlighted in Hanks and Hunter\u2019s (1995) classifi cation, where \nCK2 is classifi ed as a CMGC kinase and CK1\u03b1 as a member of \nthe CK1 family. This compares with the GRKs that are classifi ed \nas ACG kinases. It appears, therefore, that the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor can be phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner \nFigure 7.

This diversity would allow for a very fl exible pro-\ncess of receptor regulation, where not only can different sites on \nthe receptor be phosphorylated by different protein kinases but \nalso the differential mechanisms of activation and regulation of \nprotein kinase activity\/localization could infl uence receptor \nphosphorylation and signaling.\nThe fact that more than one structurally distinct protein \nkinase family has a role in M3-muscarinic receptor phosphoryla-\ntion is refl ected in the numerous phosphoacceptor sites deter-\nmined from the proteolytic phosphopeptide maps conducted in \nthis study. Furthermore, by comparing the in vitro CK2-mediated \nphosphopeptides with in vivo phosphopeptide maps, and by the \nanalysis of phosphopeptide maps from cells where CK2 was in-\nhibited using either siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors, we \ndemonstrate that only a subset of the phosphoacceptor sites on \nthe M3-muscarinic receptor are phosphorylated by CK2.\nThis data points to the fact that the distinct receptor ki-\nnases for the M3-muscarinic receptor are able to phosphorylate \ndefi ned sites on the receptor. This is supported by comparisons \nof the phosphopeptide maps after the phosphorylation of the \nthird intracellular loop by GRK2, GRK6, and CK2, which dem-\nonstrated that CK2 can indeed phosphorylate sites different \nfrom those phosphorylated by the GRKs. In the case of CK2, \nwe determined that one of these sites was the SASSDEED mo-\ntif in the third intracellular loop. Phosphorylation at this motif \npromotes further CK2-mediated phosphorylation in a process \nakin to hierarchal phosphorylation, which is a common feature \nof this protein kinase.\nThe question that arises from these observations is whether \nphosphorylation by different receptor kinases can result in dif-\nferent signaling outcomes. We addressed this here by focusing \non three signaling processes well known to be regulated by re-\nceptor phosphorylation, namely, receptor internalization, acti-\nvation of the ERK1\/2, and activation of the Jun-kinase pathway \n(Pierce et al., 2002). Our study showed that inhibition of CK2-\nmediated phosphorylation does not affect receptor internal-\nization. This is the case despite the fact that M3-muscarinic \nreceptor internalization is a phosphorylation-dependent pro-\ncess. Thus, receptor internalization must be driven by a non\u2013\nCK2-dependent phosphorylation. Our unpublished data shows \nthat CK1\u03b1 inhibition similarly does not affect receptor internal-\nization. It appears most likely that M3-muscarinic receptors are \ninternalized in a GRK-dependent manner, as has previously \nbeen reported for this receptor subtype (Tsuga et al., 1998).\nReceptor coupling to the ERK1\/2 pathway is similarly not \naffected by inhibition of CK2-mediated receptor phos-\nphorylation. We have shown previously that this signaling response \nFigure 8. CK2 regulates M3-muscarinic receptor activation of Jun-kinase \nbut not ERK1\/2. CHO-M3 cells treated with control scrambled or CK2 \nsiRNAs (CK2\u03b1-4\/CK2\u03b1-1p) were stimulated with 100 \u03bcM methacholine \nfor the indicated times, and cell extracts were obtained and used in an \nERK1\/2 kinase assay where the ERK substrate was an EGFr peptide (A) or \na Jun-kinase assay where GST\u2013c-Jun fusion protein was a substrate for Jun-\nkinase (B). Phosphate incorporated into substrates GST\u2013c-Jun or EGFr per \nmilligram of protein in cell extracts was normalized to the basal level of \nphosphorylation (time 0).

These maps are the same as shown in A except that the \nnumbered phosphopeptides indicate those that migrate to similar positions \nin both maps, whereas the open arrowheads represent phosphopeptides \nthat are specifi c to CHO cells and the closed arrowhead a phosphopeptide \nspecifi c to receptors derived from CG neurons.\n o\nn\n August 20, 2013\njcb.rupress.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPublished April 2, 2007\nCK2 IN M3-RECEPTOR PHOSPHORYLATION \u2022 TORRECILLA ET AL. 135\nis likely to be regulated by CK1\u03b1 (Budd et al., 2001). In contrast, \nwe show here that CK2 activity is important in coupling the re-\nceptor to the Jun-kinase pathway. Inhibition of CK2 via siRNA \nsubstantially increases both the magnitude and time course of \nthe Jun-kinase response to muscarinic receptor stimulation but \nhas no affect on the receptor-independent activation of the Jun-\nkinase pathway mediated by sorbitol. Because we show that \nCK2 is able to mediate receptor phosphorylation, our data point \nto the possibility that CK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation \ncan regulate the coupling of the M3-muscarinic receptor to the \nJun-kinase pathway and none of the other phosphorylation-\ndependent signaling pathways. This supports the notion that \nsite-specifi c phosphorylation mediated by a single receptor \nkinase can regulate a defi ned receptor signaling process. Our \nstudies do not, however, completely rule out the possibility that \nCK2 has an indirect role on receptor coupling to the Jun-kinase \npathway that is independent of receptor phosphorylation.\nA logical extension of this fi nding is that GPCR phos-\nphorylation might be used as a fl exible adaptive process where \na defi ned complement of protein kinases would be recruited to \nphosphorylate specifi c sites in a process that would allow for \n tissue-specifi c signaling. Hence, in the case of the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor, such a process would contribute to the very different \nphysiological responses mediated by this receptor when ex-\npressed in smooth muscle cells compared with the same recep-\ntor subtype expressed in salivary acinar cells and neurons.\nIn the current study, we tested whether the M3-muscarinic \nreceptor was able to be phosphorylated in a cell type\u2013specifi c \nfashion by comparing the tryptic phosphopeptide maps obtained \nfrom the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor immunoprecipitated \nfrom CHO cells and mouse CG neurons. We refer to the pat-\ntern obtained from these maps as phosphorylation signatures. \nBy comparing the receptor phosphorylation signatures obtained \nin CHO cells and CG neurons, it was clear that some elements \nof receptor phosphorylation were the same between the two \ncell types, whereas others were cell type specifi c. The common \nfeatures of these maps may underlie common regulatory pro-\ncesses, such as receptor internalization, whereas those phos-\nphorylation events that are unique to a given cell type might be \ninvolved in cell type\u2013specifi c signaling. It was clear from these \nstudies that at least between these two cell types the phosphory-\nlation signatures of the M3-muscarinic receptors were different, \nindicating that differential cell type\u2013specifi c phosphorylation \nindeed occurs. Our continuing studies aimed at defi ning the \nrole of these cell type\u2013specifi c phosphorylation events in physi-\nologically relevant tissues will test further whether this differ-\nential phosphorylation pattern is related to cell type\u2013specifi c \nfunctional responses.\nMaterials and methods\nPrimary cell culture\nMouse CG neurons were cultured as described previously (Leist et al., \n1997).

Equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated receptor in \neach sample were ensured by parallel radiolabeled ligand binding experi-\nments using the antagonist [3H]-NMS (Budd et al., 2004). The immuno-\nprecipitated receptor was resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by \nautoradiography or using a phosphorimager (STORM; GE Healthcare).\nIn the case of CG cells, the procedure was the same, but CSS-25 in-\ncubation buffer (120 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 15 mM glucose, 25 mM \nKCl, and 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 100 \u03bcCi\/ml [32P]-orthophos-\nphate was used. The receptor was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates \nobtained by pooling 2 wells of a 6-well plate. In these experiments and \nothers involving the mouse receptor, we used an in-house anti\u2013mouse M3-\nmuscarinic receptor antibody (see Generation of mouse M3-muscarinic re-\nceptor antibody).\nFor phosphopeptide mapping, CHO-M3 cells and CG neurons were \nlabeled with 100 or 200 \u03bcCi\/ml [32P]-orthophosphate, respectively. Stimu-\nlation and immunoprecipitation were performed as described. The immuno-\nprecipitated samples of one entire 6-well plate of CHO cells or 2 plates of \nCG neurons were pooled and resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Biotinylated proteins were then detected \nwith chemiluminescence reagent (ECL plus; GE Healthcare).\nGeneration of mouse M3-muscarinic receptor antibody\nThe region S344-L462 of the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor third intracellular \nloop was produced as an N-terminal tagged GST\/receptor fusion protein, \nwhich was used to inoculate New Zealand white rabbits (Harlan Sera-Labs). \nThe resulting antisera was tested in immunoprecipitation studies and shown \nto specifi cally react with the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor (Fig. 3).\nCK2 activity assay\n48 h after siRNA transfection, CHO cells cultured in 12-well dishes were \nharvested in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM \u03b2-glycerophos-\nphate, and 200 mM NaCl) containing 0.5% NP-40 substitute (Fluka). \nThe kinase assay (using 10 \u03bcl of cell lysate) was performed in lysis buffer \ncontaining 1 \u03bcM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 \u03bcg\/ml BSA, 50 \u03bcM CK2 \npeptide substrate R R R E E E T E E E (Promega), and 1 \u03bcCi \u03b3-[32P]ATP (total \nvolume 50 \u03bcl). After a 15-min incubation at 37\u00b0C, half of the mixture \nwas spotted on phosphocellulose P81 fi lter (Whatman) and washed four \ntimes with 0.5% H3PO4. The fi lters were then transferred to vials con-\ntaining scintillation fl uid (Safefl uor) and counted. The phosphorylation \nassays were performed in either the presence or absence of 1 \u03bcM of the \nCK2 inhibitor TBB. CK2 activity was then determined as the TBB-sensitive \ncomponent of the peptide phosphorylation, which was \u000420% of the total \npeptide phosphorylation.\nData analysis\nAutoradiography densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuant \nand AlphaEase FC softwares. SD of at least three determinations is pre-\nsented, and signifi cance was determined using a one-way analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA).\nOnline supplemental material\nFig. S1 shows the sequences on CK2\u03b1 and -\u03b1\u2032 subunits that were targeted \nby siRNAs. These siRNAs were then tested for the ability to reduce expression \nof CK2 and effects on M3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation (Fig. S2). \nThis data demonstrated that siRNAs distinct from those used in Fig. 1 were \nalso able to reduce CK2 expression, and this correlated with a reduction \nin receptor phosphorylation.
