The underlying pathology (periventricular \nleukomalacia: PVL), may feature focal necrotic damage of periventricular white matter \nand diffuse white matter injury. White matter injury may arise following hypoxia-\nischemia at birth, but the largest patient cohort suffer injury during mid-gestation1, 2. The \nmotor, sensory and cognitive deficits that characterize the lesion are associated with \ninjury to immature cells of the oligodendroglial lineage, which are susceptible to a form \nof non-NMDA-type glutamate receptor (GluR) -mediated excitotoxic injury3-8. In \naddition to non-NMDA receptors, these cells express NMDA GluRs selectively on their \nprocesses9-11, although the role of NMDA receptors in ischemic injury of myelinated \nwhite matter is controversial12-15. \n Oligodendroglial injury has been the focus of research into the cellular \nmechanisms of developing white matter injury for the past decade. However, axon \ndamage is consistently reported in histological examinations of PVL2,16,17. Axonal \nchanges include truncation of the axon cylinder18 and the formation of \"retraction balls \nand clubs\"16. Recent reports indicate that axonal injury is an early event in the formation \nof both focal and diffuse components of PVL19-21, and may be central to the evolution of \nthe injury17. Despite these considerations, almost nothing is known regarding the injury \nmechanisms operating upon premyelinated central axons. In mid-gestation telencephalic \nwhite matter that is subject to PVL, axons have an immature expression profile for \ndevelopmental markers and oligodendroglia are changing from the precursor to the \nimmature form22, 23. The first evidence of early myelination is apparent, which includes \nmyelin basic protein expression around some axons of the optic radiation23. There is \nevidence that injury to these axons during PVL can result in optic nerve hypoplasia24. \nCentral axon development has been studied in detail in the rat optic nerve (RON), where \nradial expansion corresponding to an ~3 fold increase in diameter within an ~4 day \nperiod precedes first contact by oligodendrocyte processes and the subsequent onset of \nmyelination25. The first post-mitotic oligodendrocytes appear at post-natal day 6 (P6) and \nstart to extend processes parallel to axons26-28.

Recent reports \nindicate that axonal injury is an early \nevent in the formation of both focal and \ndiffuse components of PVL 19-21, and may \nbe central to the evolution of the injury 17. \nDespite these considerations, almost \nnothing is known regarding the injury \nmechanisms operating upon \npremyelinated central axons. In mid-\ngestation telencephalic and periatal white \nmatter that is subject to PVL, axons have \nan immature expression profile for \ndevelopmental markers and \noligodendroglia are changing from the \nprecursor to the immature form 22, 23\nDeleted: and periatal\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: expression around axons of \nthe optic radiation \nDeleted: myelination 25\nPage 4 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 4 \nage and correspond to the largest premyelinated axons with diameters of >=0.4 \u00b5m25. By \nP10 the first wraps of compact myelin appear, corresponding to ~1% of axon profiles \nwith ~4% of axons ensheathed but not myelinated25, at which point the axons become \nsensitive to acute ischemic injury29. We here examine the mechanisms of acute ischemic-\ntype injury at this crucial developmental point and test the significance of GluR \nexpression in the injury process. \n \nMethods \n All animal procedures conformed to UK home office regulations. RONs were \ndissected from Lister-hooded rats between P8-12. Nerves were perfused with artificial \ncerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), composition (in mM): NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; NaH2PO4, 2; \nMgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; NaHCO3, 26; glucose, 10; pH, 7.45, bubbled with 5% CO2 \/ 95% O2 \nand maintained at 37oC. Zero-Na+ aCSF: NMDG\/Cl, 124; KCl, 3; CaCl2, 2; MgSO4, 2; \ncholine-HCO3, 26; KH2PO4, 2; Glucose 10. Zero-Cl- aCSF: Na-cyclamate, 124; K-\ngluconate, 3; Ca gluconate, 2; MgSO4, 2; NaHCO3, 26; NaH2PO4, 2; Glucose 10. Zero-\nCa2+ aCSF: CaCl2 was omitted and 50 EGTA \u00b5M was added. Glucose was omitted from \nsolutions when oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was required and the solution was \npre-bubbled with 5% CO2 \/ 95% N2 for at least 60 min. The chamber atmosphere was \nswitched to 5% CO2 \/ 95% N2 during perfusion with OGD. Osmolarity of all solutions \nwas measured and adjusted using NaCl or sucrose as required. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM, \nsignificance determined by t-test or ANOVA as appropriate. GluR antagonists were from \nTocris (UK), all other reagents were from Sigma (UK) unless stated otherwise. \n Electrophysiological recordings used the same equipment to that described \nrecently30. In brief, extracellular compound action potentials (CAPs) were evoked and \nrecorded with suction electrodes. Peak-to-peak amplitude was used to assess changes in \nthe number of unitary action potentials since CAP area can not be applied reliably to \nrecordings from neonatal nerves due to the long stimulus duration required for \nsupramaximal stimulation29. CAPs were evoked via square-wave constant current pulses \nof 150-600 \u00b5sec (Iso stim A320, WPI). The signal was amplified (Cyber Amp 320, Axon \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: diameters of >=0.4 \u00b5m 25\nDeleted: Ca2Cl,\nDeleted: Ca2-gluconate,\nDeleted: zero-Ca2+\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: times\nDeleted:  \nPage 5 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 5 \nInstruments), subtracted from a parallel differential electrode, filtered (low pass: 800 Hz), \ndigitized (25000 Hz: 1401 mini, Cambridge Electronic Design) and displayed on a PC \nrunning Signal software (Cambridge Electronic Design). CAP loss is taken to indicate \nirreversible failure of axon function29, and is well correlated with pathological changes in \naxons such as dissolution of microtubules\/neurofilaments, disruption of mitochondria, \nloss of axoplasmic integrity and of neurofilament staining. \n For immuno-histochemistry, P10 RONs were dissected into 0.1M PBS and fixed \nin 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Nerves were subsequently incubated in 0.1M PBS \nplus 20% sucrose w\/v for 5 min prior to freeze-sectioning (20 \u00b5m sections) and \nsubsequent blocking for 60 min in 0.1M PBS, 10% fetal goat serum plus 0.5% Triton-X \n100. Sections were then incubated in this solution plus primary antibody at 4o C \novernight. Antibodies raised against NR1 (1:200, Upstate), GluR4 (1:200, Upstate), \nneurofilament-200 (NF-H), neurofilament-70 (NF-L) (Chemicon; 1:200 and 1:100 \nrespectively), and CNPase (an oligodendroglial marker; Sigma; 1:100) were detected \nusing appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Cambridge \nBioscience, see10 for further details), and imaged as single planes via laser scanning \nconfocal microscopy. Primary antibody omission controls were performed and are \nincluded in the figures at appropriate points. Intensity levels of neurofilament staining \nwere assessed using mean pixel intensity levels within standard regions of interest, \nperformed using Metamorph (Universal Imaging).  \n For PCR, P10 RONs were digested in MELT (Ambion) and subjected to a triazol \nextraction. RNA was then column purified and the resulting RNA treated to remove DNA \ncontamination. The RNA was purified by extraction with phenol, pH 4.2, (Sigma) and re-\nsuspended to a concentration of 1\u00b5g\/\u00b5l.  PCR was then performed using Omniscript \n(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All primers were tested on whole \nbrain as a positive control, see10 for further details.  \n For electron-microscopy, P10 RONs were collected at the end of \nelectrophysiological experiments, washed in Sorenson's buffer and post-fixed in 3% \ngluteraldehyde\/Sorenson's. Nerves were then fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide and \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: -10000\nDeleted:  \nDeleted:  \nDeleted: Intensity levels \nDeleted: ntensity levels \nDeleted: by mean pix\nDeleted:  \nPage 6 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 6 \ndehydrated prior to infiltration in epoxy. Ultrathin sections were counterstained with \nuranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 100CX electron microscope. \nGlial cell processes could sometimes be identified on ultrastructural grounds6. For \nexample, the astrocyte process in Fig 6 e contains characteristic wide-bore endoplasmic \nreticulum and glycogen particles, and the oligodendrocyte process in Fig 4 e has \nmyelinated a nearby axon. Since all axons in the adult rat optic nerve are myelinated, \nnon-myelinated axons at P10 are in either an early or late stage of preparation for \nmyelination. For post-embedding immuno-labelling of NR1 (1:100), GluR2\/3 (1:50, \nUpstate) and KA2 (1:50, Upstate), primary antibody was applied to the sections overnight \nand appropriate 20 nm gold particle secondary antibodies were applied following \nwashing. Primary antibody omission controls were blank. \n For morphometric analysis and viability scoring, axons within a minimum of \nthree grid sections were outlined by hand using Image-J software (NIH) and axon area \nand perimeter were measured. Grids were selected at random and all identifiable axons \nwithin the area were included to avoid bias. Axon profiles were often far from round and \nthe closest corresponding circular diameter was calculated from the perimeter values. \nAxon viability scores were assigned blind using the following scoring system. Axons \nwere given one point for each of three well-established indicators of viability; i) the \npresence of a relatively complete axolemma, ii) the presence of normal microtubules, iii) \nthe presence of a clear and debris-free axoplasm. Axons that showed all three of these \nfeatures were therefore given a viability score of \"3\", and axons with none were given a \nscore of \"0\", with intermediate scores between this range. Examples of axon scores are \nshown in supplemental Fig 1, where a healthy axon (score of \"3\"), and degrees of injury \n(\"2\" to \"0\") are shown.  \n \nSupplemental Figure 1 near here \n \nResults \nDeleted:  \nDeleted: Fig \nDeleted: Fig \nDeleted: axons of the P10 nerve can be \nconsidered to be either \nDeleted: overnight\nDeleted: (1:100)\nPage 7 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 7 \n Action potential conduction in the isolated P10 RON was stable for several hours \nunder control conditions, while 60 min of OGD resulted in conduction failure that was \nonly partially reversible after 60 min recovery in aCSF29 (25.6 \u00b14.2% CAP recovery, \nn=14 nerves, P<0.001 vs. 130 min of control perfusion; Fig 1 a-c). Injury was largely \nprevented by removing extracellular Ca2+ (84.2 \u00b14.2% CAP recovery, n=8 nerves, \nP<0.001 vs. injury in normal Ca2+; Fig 1 a-c), an effect confirmed at the ultrastructural \nlevel (Fig 2 d). Staining for the axonal markers NF-L and NF-H, which label small \ndiameter and larger diameter axons respectively31, was also disrupted in axons following \n60 min of OGD + 60 min recovery (Fig 1 e, f). Confocal imaging of post-OGD staining \nrevealed areas denuded of neurofilament reactivity and ball-like structures that may \ncorrespond to swollen axon regions. Staining levels were quantified to reveal a similar \ndecline in reactivity to NF-L and NH-H following the insult (Fig 1 f). \n \nFigure 1 near here \n \n Control perfused nerves had the ultrastructural features typical of this age25,27,28, \n32\n. Small (<0.4 \u00b5m diameter) and large (=>0.4 \u00b5m) premyelinated axons where separated \nby a narrow extracellular space and by glial processes (Fig 2 a \"S\" and \"L\" premyelinated \naxons respectively), with the occasional myelinated axon apparent (Fig 2 a \"Ax\"). Some \nof the large premyelinated axons were ensheathed by glial processes (Fig 2 a, \"*\"), shown \nin long-section in Fig 2 c (arrow). Mitochondria in all cell compartments had a typical \ninternal structure and showed no evidence of swelling. Following OGD, the extracellular \nspace was expanded and nondescript cellular debris was common (Fig 2 b). Many \npremyelinated axons showed a loss of microtubules and regions of axolemma breakdown  \n(Fig 2 b), and extensive disruption of glial processes was widespread (intact glial \nprocesses were only occasionally seen). In long section, regions of intense focal \npremyelinated axon disruption were seen (Fig 2 e, \"Axon\" arrow heads), generally \naligned parallel to damaged regions of neighbouring glial processes (\"gp\" arrow heads). \nIdentification of axons in post OGD micrographs was based upon the presence of \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: The injury process was largely \nnegated\nDeleted:  \nDeleted:  \nDeleted:  Note that the remaining \nidentifiable axons in Fig 2 btend to be of \nlarge diameter (=>0.4 \u00b5m).\nDeleted:  small premyelinated\nDeleted: often \nPage 8 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 8 \nidentifiable microtubules which were sometimes rather sparse (e.g., Fig 2 e \"Axon\" \narrow). \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \n Unlike mature optic nerve axons33,34, replacing extracellular Na+ (Fig 3 a-c; \nsupplemental Fig 2) or Cl- (Fig 3 d-f) was not protective against injury. This was not due \nto any toxicity of ion substitution at this age since control ion substitutions had no \nsignificant non-reversible effect (Fig 3 a, c, d, f). This result suggests a fundamentally \ndifferent ionic basis to injury in premyelinated and myelinated axons, and rules out a \nsignificant role for Na-Ca exchange or Cl- channels in the injury process33,34. In \nparticular, Na+ replacement leads to rapid depletion of axoplasmic Na+ and block of \nreverse-mode Na-Ca exchange, a major source of Ca2+ influx in mature myelinated axons \nduring anoxia33. The finding was confirmed at the ultrastructural level where wide-scale \ndisruption of axons following OGD in zero-Na+ conditions was confirmed (supplemental \nFig 2). No changes were observed in the ultrastructure of nerves perfused with zero-Na+ \naCSF for 140 min in the absence of OGD (not shown).  \n \nFigure 3 near here \n \n Oligodendroglial GluRs are implicated in the Ca2+-dependent injury of their \nprocesses and somata3,4,9-11, while axonal expression of AMPA and kainate receptors is \nimportant for ischemic-type injury of myelinated spinal axons35,36. Block of NMDA-\nreceptors (10 \u00b5M MK-801) or non-NMDA receptors (20 \u00b5M NBQX) was protective \nagainst OGD-induced injury of premyelinated axons, as was combined block (67.9 \n\u00b17.0% CAP recovery during combined block, n=8 nerves, P<0.001 vs. OGD alone; Fig 4 \na-d).

Note in Fig 4 g that a large diameter premyelinated axon has \nlost all axoplasmic differentiation but a glial processes wrapped around the axon is intact \n(arrow heads). \n \nFigure 4 near here \n \n In control nerves, the diameter spectra of premyelinated axons ranged between \n0.15-0.70 \u00b5m, with a peak between 0.25-0.30 \u00b5m (n = 100 axons; Fig 5 a, left). This \ncorresponds closely to earlier studies25. Following OGD, the density of recognizable \npremyelinated axons fell from 11.50 axons\/\u00b5m2 to 1.26 axons\/\u00b5m2 (P<0.001; n = 91 \naxons; Fig 5 a, right, filled bars). The loss of recognizable premyelinated axons was \nsignificantly reduced by GluR block (to 6.59 axons\/\u00b5m2), in particular in small \npremyelinated axons (Fig 5 a, right, open bars). The axon diameter spectra following \nOGD may be affected by expansion of the extracellular space and swelling of glial \nprocesses. To better assess the degree of injury within small and large premyelinated \naxons, we employed a numerical viability scoring system. The mean viability score for \nsmall premyelinated axons (<0.4 \u00b5m in diameter) and large premyelinated axons (=>0.4 \n\u00b5m in diameter) are shown in Fig 5 b. Under control conditions, the mean viability score \nof both groups of axons was close to \"3\", indicating no significant pathology. Following \nOGD the viability scores of both groups declined significantly, with the smaller axons \nshowing a significantly greater decline than the larger axons (P<0.001). Combined GluR \nblock prevented the appearance of pathology in identifiable small premyelinated axons \nbut had no comparable effect upon the larger premyelinated axons. The viability scores \nfor all premyelinated axons examined is shown in Fig 5 c-e, confirming the selective \nprotection of small premyelinated axons by GluR block.  \n \nFigure 5 near here \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: e-g \"S\"),\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: 0.1-0.7\nDeleted:  in axon density\nDeleted:  \nPage 10 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 10 \n \n The pattern of NMDA receptor protein (Fig 6 a-c) and mRNA (Fig 6 d) \nexpression was similar in P10 RON to that reported in the P10 mouse optic nerve10. \nConfocal imaging indicated that NR1 subunit protein is colocalized with CNPase (+) \noligodendroglial processes but not with N-FH (+) axon profiles (Fig 6 a, b). GluR4 \nprotein (non-NMDA subunit) appeared primarily in CNPase (+) oligodendroglial somata \n(Supplemental Fig 3). At the ultrastructural level, intense NR1 protein reactivity was \nfound in regions where oligodendrocyte process membrane ran parallel to the axolemma \nof small premyelinated axons, in addition to expression within compact myelin as \npreviously reported9,11 (Fig 6 e-g arrows, supplemental Figs 4, 5). NR1 reactivity \nappeared to translocate from the axolemmal face of oligodendrocyte processes aligned \nalong small diameter premyelinated axons into the myelin as development progressed. \nOn no occasion was NR1 reactivity seen in the cell membrane of axons or astrocytes and \nit was unusual to see it in cell membranes of oligodendroglial somata.  \n \nFigure 6 near here \nSupplemental Figs 3-5 near here \n Perfusion with AMPA+kainate produced a small but significant fall in the CAP \n(Fig 7 a), which achieved higher significance in the presence of the AMPA \ndesensitization inhibitor cyclothiazide.

Immuno-\nlocalization using an antibody against the AMPA receptor Glur2\/3 subunit revealed high \nexpression in and under myelin and in the axolemma of premyelinated axons (Fig 7 c-e). \nThe kainate receptor KA2 subunit showed more focal expression at sites within and \nunder myelin, in addition to the axolemma of premyelinated axons (Fig 7 f-i). \n \nFigure 7 near here \nField Code Changed\nDeleted:  mRNA and\nDeleted: nerve 10, with clusters of NR1 \nNMDA subunit protein reactivity \ncolocalized with CNPase (+) \noligodendroglial processes but not with \nN-FH (+) axon profiles (Fig 6 a, b).

We have here shown NMDA receptor expression on oligodendrocyte \nprocesses, as required by this hypothesis. We have also shown that the presence of these \nNMDA receptors results in acute injury of small premyelinated axons during OGD. \nPossible mediators that might link NMDA receptor-mediated oligodendrocyte process \ninjury with axon injury include local release of intracellular potassium resulting in axon \ndepolarization and cytotoxic swelling; physical disruption of the axolemma during \noligodendrocyte process swelling and dissolution, which will also disrupt the \nextracellular matrix; release of free radicals; and release of intracellular components such \nas calpains and lipases that are likely to attack the axon directly. \n In addition to expression on oligodendrocyte processes, NMDA receptors were \nfound in early compact myelin. Similar myelin expression in mature RON can mediate \ncytotoxic Ca2+ influx9-11. As a result, NMDA receptors contribute to OGD-induced injury \nin this preparation12, although apparently not in mouse optic nerve14,15. The current \nfindings indicate that oligodendroglial processes express NMDA receptors where they \nnavigate along premyelinated axons, while expression shifts to the myelin as it is \ndeposited. NMDA receptor block failed to protect larger premyelinated axons, which is \nconsistent with loss of receptors from the axonal face of oligodendrocyte processes once \naxon ensheathment has been achieved. At this point in central axon development, injury \nmay involve the voltage-gate calcium channels transiently expressed in these large \npremyelinated axons30. \n NMDA or AMPA\/kainate receptor block was equally protective against OGD-\ninduced injury. Combined block had no additional protective effect and resulted in \nsparing of small but not large premyelinated axons. Since oligodendrocyte NMDA \nreceptors require co-activation of AMPA\/kainate receptors to overcome Mg2+-block even \nDeleted: The premyelinated central \naxons that are subject to injury during \nPVL are on the threshold of a program of \nrapid diameter expansion and axolemma \nprotein re-organization. At this point in \nthe P10 RON, oligodendroglia are \nmaturing and extending processes parallel \nto axons as voltage-gated Na-channels \nstart to cluster at sites where nodes of \nRanvier will form 26-28. Recent findings \nsuggest that formation of the intricate \nmorphological arrangement between \naxons and oligodendrocyte processes is \ndependent upon axonal vesicular-type \nglutamate release, which may co-ordinate \naxo-glial interactions via GluR on the \noligodendrocyte processes 30, 35, 36. \nPremyelinated central axons also express \nfunctional glutamate transporters 37, and \nvesicular- and transporter-mediated \nglutamate release are potential sources of \nthe extracellular glutamate responsible \nfor GluR-mediated injury of \noligodendrocyte processes described in \nthe current study. Astrocytes may also act \nas a source of ischemic glutamate release \nin developing white matter 37, 38. The \nlocalization of NMDA receptors to \noligodendrocyte processes aligned along \nthe axolemma of premyelinated axons \nindicates that Ca2+-dependent, Na+- and \nCl--independent, injury to the processes at \nthese sites precedes breakdown of the \nneighbouring axolemma. The findings \ntherefore place oligodendrocyte process \ninjury before premyelinated axon injury \nDeleted: . Premyelinated central axons \nalso express functional glutamate \ntransporters 37, and vesicular- and \ntransporter-mediated glutamate release \nare potential sources of the extracellular \nglutamate responsible for GluR-mediated \ninjury of oligodendrocyte processes \ndescribed in the current study. Astrocytes \nmay also act as a source of ischemic \nglutamate release in developing white \nmatter 37, 38. The localization of NMDA \nreceptors to oligodendrocyte processes \naligned along the axolemma of \npremyelinated axons indicates that Ca2+-\ndependent, Na+- and Cl--independent, \ninjury to the processes at these sites \nprecedes breakdown of the neighbouring \naxolemma. The findings therefore place \noligodendrocyte process injury before \npremyelinated axon injury in the \nsequence of events that result in acute \nloss of function in early developing white \nmatter during ischemia. \u00b6\nIn addition to expression on \noligodendrocyte processes aligned along \npremyelinated axons, NMDA receptor \nprotein was also observed in early \ncompact myelin. Similar expression in \nmyelin is seen in mature rat optic nerve \nwhere it can mediate cytotoxic Ca2+ \ninflux 9-11. Presumably as a result, NMDA \nreceptors contribute to ischemic injury in \nmyelinated rat optic nerve 12, although no \nsimilar effect is found in mouse optic \nnerve 14, 15. The current findings indicate \n... [1]\n... [2]\nPage 12 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n 12 \nduring modelled ischemia9, this is consistent with the current observation that both \nclasses of GluR are present on oligodendrocyte processes. Immuno-labelling at the light \nlevel appears to show low AMPA\/kainate receptor expression on oligodendrocyte \nprocesses10, but the current ultrastructural analysis reveals high levels of membrane \nexpression in these structures in addition to clear expression in the axolemma. \nAMPA\/kainate receptor activation produced ~10% decline in the CAP, consistent with \nexpression of functional receptors in the axolemma. Although a small contribution from \nAMPA\/kainate receptors to axonal injury cannot be ruled out by the current findings, the \nabsence of an additive effect of co-receptor block indicates that axonal non-NMDA \nGluRs are not directly involved in injury. This contrasts with the situation in mature \ncentral axons35,36, and may indicate that the axonal nanocomplexes incorporating \nAMPA\/kainate receptors and NO synthase which are involved in acute OGD-injury have \nyet to form in premyelinated white matter.  \n The results may have significant clinical ramifications, since magnesium sulphate \nis a recognized antenatal intervention associated with a decreased risk of gross motor \ndeficit in low birth weight babies39,40. While the significance of this effect requires further \ninvestigation, elevated extracellular Mg2+ will inhibit NMDA receptors in developing \nwhite matter9. The current findings raise the possibility that this prophylactic strategy \nmay prove effective at protecting small premyelinated central axons in the foetus at risk \nof cerebral palsy, while interventions designed around NMDA receptor block41,42 may \nprotect both oligodendroglial cells and their partner axons. \n \nreceptors in developing white matter9.

At this point in the P10 RON, oligodendroglia are maturing and extending \nprocesses parallel to axons as voltage-gated Na-channels start to cluster at sites where \nnodes of Ranvier will form 26-28. Recent findings suggest that formation of the intricate \nmorphological arrangement between axons and oligodendrocyte processes is dependent \nupon axonal vesicular-type glutamate release, which may co-ordinate axo-glial \ninteractions via GluR on the oligodendrocyte processes 30, 35, 36. Premyelinated central \naxons also express functional glutamate transporters 37, and vesicular- and transporter-\nmediated glutamate release are potential sources of the extracellular glutamate \nresponsible for GluR-mediated injury of oligodendrocyte processes described in the \ncurrent study. Astrocytes may also act as a source of ischemic glutamate release in \ndeveloping white matter 37, 38. The localization of NMDA receptors to oligodendrocyte \nprocesses aligned along the axolemma of premyelinated axons indicates that Ca2+-\ndependent, Na+- and Cl--independent, injury to the processes at these sites precedes \nbreakdown of the neighbouring axolemma. The findings therefore place oligodendrocyte \nprocess injury before premyelinated axon injury in the sequence of events that result in \nacute loss of function in early developing white matter during ischemia.  \n In addition to expression on oligodendrocyte processes aligned along \npremyelinated axons, NMDA receptor protein was also observed in early compact \nmyelin. Similar expression in myelin is seen in mature rat optic nerve where it can \nmediate cytotoxic Ca2+ influx 9-11. Presumably as a result, NMDA receptors contribute to \nischemic injury in myelinated rat optic nerve 12, although no similar effect is found in \nmouse optic nerve 14, 15. The current findings indicate that NMDA receptor expression is \nhigh on oligodendroglial processes navigating along premyelinated axons but shifts to the \nmyelin as it is deposited, possible becoming trapped in the lamella. The absence of \nprotection of larger premyelinated axons by NMDA receptor block indicates that NMDA \nreceptors are not restricted to the axonal face of the oligodendrocyte process membrane \nonce it has ensheathed the axon cylinder. At this point in central axon development, \ninjury may involve the voltage-gate calcium channels recently documented in this axon \nPage 24 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\npopulation 30. The mechanism of small premyelinated axon injury following GluR-\nmediated disintegration of neighbouring oligodendrocyte process will be difficult to \ndissect from the process injury itself. Possible mediators include local release of \nintracellular potassium onto the axolemma resulting in depolarization and cytotoxic \nswelling; physical disruption of the axolemma during oligodendrocyte process swelling \nand dissolution, which will also disrupt the extracellular matrix; release of free radicals \ncapable of damaging the axolemma; and release of intracellular components such as \ncalpains and lipases likely to attack the axon directly. \n In addition to NMDA GluRs on their processes, developing oligodendroglia \nexpress non-NMDA receptors that can mediate toxic Ca2+-influx during ischemic \nconditions 3-7. The current findings support the view that these receptors are expressed \nmainly on the somata 10. Block of either NMDA or non-NMDA GluRs provided a similar \ndegree of protection from ischemic conditions. This may reflect the significant degree of \nMg2+-block of oligodendrocyte NMDA receptors 9 \n \nPage 11: [2] Deleted Robert Fern 4\/23\/2009 1:20:00 PM \n.

Astrocytes may also act as a source of ischemic \nglutamate release in developing white matter 37, 38. The localization of NMDA receptors \nto oligodendrocyte processes aligned along the axolemma of premyelinated axons \nindicates that Ca2+-dependent, Na+- and Cl--independent, injury to the processes at these \nsites precedes breakdown of the neighbouring axolemma.

This may reflect the significant degree of \nMg2+-block of oligodendrocyte NMDA receptors 9, requiring cell depolarization via non-\nNMDA receptors before toxic Ca2+ influx can proceed. This may have significant clinical \nramifications, since magnesium sulphate is a recognized antenatal intervention associated \nwith a decreased risk of gross motor deficit in low birth weight babies 39. While the \nsignificance of this effect requires further investigation, elevated extracellular Mg2+ will \ninhibit NMDA receptors in developing white matter 9. The current findings raise the \npossibility that this prophylactic strategy may prove effective at protecting small \npremyelinated central axons in the foetus at risk of cerebral palsy. \nPage 26 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n \n \n \nPage 27 of 45\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nAnnals of Neurology\nFor Peer Review\n  \n \n \nFigure 1 \nOGD-induced injury in developing white matter. a: CAP recorded from the P10 RON before and 60 \nmin after 60 min of OGD in normal-Ca2+ (left) and zero-Ca2+ (right) conditions.
