The impedance\ncharacteristics of both types of electrode were changed by increasing concentrations\nof antigen up to a saturation level. Calibration curves were obtained by subtraction of\nthe non-specific response from the specific response, thereby eliminating the effects\nof non-specific adsorption of antigen. Both the use of microelectrode arrays and\naffinity binding protocols showed large enhancements in sensitivity over planar\nelectrodes containing entrapped antibodies and gave similar sensitivities to our other\npublished work using affinity based planar electrodes. Detection limits were of the\norder of 0.1 ng ml-1 for digoxin and 1.5 ng ml-1 for BSA.\nKeywords. ac impedance, immunosensor, polyaniline, microelectrode, BSA, digoxin.\n31. Introduction\nThe principle of immunoassays was first established in 1959 (Yalow and\nBerson 1959) and their work led to the development of the widely used\nradioimmunoassay to determine insulin-binding antibodies in human serum, using\nsamples obtained from subjects that had been treated with insulin. Later, within\nunconnected work (Clark and Lyons 1962), the concept of a biosensor was pioneered.\nThese workers exploited the selectivity of enzymes for analytical purposes via a\nmethodology which involved immobilising enzymes on the surface of electrochemical\nsensors and measuring the oxygen consumption by the glucose oxidase enzymatically\ncatalysed oxidation of glucose. This basic idea has remained virtually unchanged\nsince the original design, although the field has undergone continual technological\ndevelopments over the last forty years.\nThe incorporation of antibodies into conducting polymer films was first\nreported (John et al 1991) in 1991. Pyrrole was galvanostatically polymerised onto a\nplatinum wire substrate from a solution which contained anti-human serum albumin\n(anti-HSA). The antibody was incorporated into the polypyrrole film and the pyrrole\nanti-HSA electrode found to give a specific electrochemical response to HSA. Since\nthis early work there has been burgeoning interest in the development of\nelectrochemical immunosensors - as detailed in several recent reviews (Rodriguez-\nMoraz et al 2006, Diaz-Gonzales et al 2005, Cosmier 2005).\nAntibody-antigen interactions are by their very nature complex and it is\nthought necessary that the affinity reaction be minimally perturbed by the fabrication\nprocedure to give reproducible response characteristics. We have previously shown\nthat up to 2-3 \uf06dg antibodies for BSA and digoxin may be successfully incorporated\n4into conducting polymer films by entrapment in a growing polypyrrole film with no\ndetrimental effect to antibody activity (Grant et al 2003). Electrochemical\ninterrogation of these films demonstrated selective interactions with the target\nantigens. Further work utilised an AC impedance protocol (Grant et al 2005) as the\nmethod of interrogation for these films - and led to the development of\nimmunosensors for digoxin and bovine serum albumin. Later work by our group\nutilised polyaniline coated screen-printed planar carbon electrodes as substrates for\nimmobilisation of antibodies utilising the classical avidin-biotin interaction. This\nenabled the construction of immunosensors for the fluoroquinolone antibody\nciprofloxacin (Garifallou et al 2007) and myelin basic protein - a marker for\nconditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis (Tsekenis et al 2008).\nOur group has also pioneered the development of sonochemically fabricated\nmicroarrays of conductive polymers (Higson 1996), the schematic for the formation\nof which is shown within figure 1. Poly(1,2-diaminobenzene) can be electrodeposited\non a variety of conductive surfaces to form an insulating layer15. We have utilised\ncommercial screen printed 3 electrode strips as the basis for these sensors. The\nworking electrodes are initially coated with a thin film (50-70 nm thickness) of an\ninsulating polymer formed by the electrochemical deposition of 1,2-diaminobenzene\n(Myler et al 1997). An advantage of this process is that it is self-limiting, making it\nhighly reproducible. Sonochemical ablation is then used to ablate or \u201cdrill\u201d holes in\nthis insulating material with diameters of 0.1 to several microns and a density of up to\n120000 pores cm-2. We have used these micropore arrays for the detection of aqueous\nchlorine (Davis et al 1997). The arrays may be used as substrates for further\nelectropolymerisation reactions, generating arrays of conducting polyaniline\nprotrusions, consisting of just the polymer or alternatively containing entrapped\n5biological species (Barton et al 2004). Previous work within our group has utilised\nthese microarrays containing entrapped enzymes for the amperometric detection of\nglucose (Barton et al 2004, Myler et al 2004), alcohol (Myler et al 2005). and a range\nof organophosphate pesticides (Pritchard et al 2004, Law et al 2005) with extreme\nsensitivity (10-17 M).\nOne difficulty often encountered when using sensors for practical analytical\napplications is that the species being detected can in some situations be present only at\nvery low concentration while being contained within a complex biological system\nsuch as blood. This means that any sensor must display high sensitivities and also low\nnon-specific adsorption of possible foulants or interferents. As can be seen from\nprevious work using enzymes, use of microelectrodes rather than planar electrodes\ncan lead to extremely high sensitivities (Pritchard et al 2004, Law et al 2005).\nAttempts therefore were made within this study to determine whether the use of\nmicroelectrodes rather than planar electrodes within immunosensors similar to those\npreviously reported (Grant et al 2003, 2005) would lead to sensitivity enhancements.\nMicroelectrode arrays containing entrapped anti-BSA were constructed and their\nperformance compared with our previous work on planar, entrapped sensors.\nA disadvantage associated with the entrapment method used within much of\nour previous work for antibody immobilisation is that the antigen will often be too\nbulky to diffuse through the polymer matrix and so only antibodies located at the\nsurface of the polymer film or microelectrode - and suitably orientated, will be\navailable for antigen binding. Other work comparing monolayers of randomly and\nspecifically orientated antibody fragments (Bonroy et al 2006) showed that\nimmunosensor responses typically double when the fragment is specifically\norientated.\n6Digoxin (supplementary information, figure S2) is a cardiac drug, widely used\nin the treatment of various heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter,\nwith a narrow therapeutic range of 0.8-2.0 ng ml-1 (Terra et al 1999). Previous work\nby our group demonstrated the construction of an immunosensor for digoxin,\nhowever, these sensors were only capable of detecting the antigen in the mg-\uf06dg ml-1\nranges (Grant et al 2003). The anti-digoxin antibodies used in this early study were\nentrapped within a planar, electropolymerised film. We therefore within this work\nalso compare results obtained using an affinity method to graft antibodies to the\nsurface of the film with those obtained previously by entrapment (Grant et al 2003) in\nan attempt to improve sensitivity.\nThe focus of this paper is not just to describe the development of particular\nsensors - but rather to compare the behaviour of sensors fabricated using a variety of\nmethods, namely our earlier work on entrapment in planar polymer films with affinity\ngrafted planar films and also entrapment of the antibodies within conductive polymer\nprotrusions. As will be demonstrated, both methods lead to an enhancement in\nsensitivity.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Materials and equipment\nSodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate,\nsodium chloride and hydrochloric acid were obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK).\nAniline, polyclonal human anti-IgG (AIgG), biotin 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide,\nthe biotinylation kit (part no. BK101), neutravidin, human serum albumin (HSA),\nbovine serum albumin (BSA), anti-bovine serum albumin (ABSA, developed in\nrabbit), digoxin, anti-digoxin (developed in rabbit-whole antiserum), sodium acetate,\n7acetic acid, sodium perchlorate, potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide\nwere obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK. All water used was\nobtained from a Purelab UHQ Deioniser (Elga, High Wycombe, UK). Commercial\nscreen-printed carbon electrodes (Figure S1, supplementary information) containing\ncarbon working and counter electrodes and an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode were\nobtained from Microarray Ltd, Manchester, UK. The surface area of the working\nelectrode was 0.2178 cm2. AC impedance measurements were performed using an\nACM Auto AC DSP frequency response analyser (ACM Instruments, Grange-over-\nSands, UK). Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a Sycopel potentiometer\n(Sycopel Scientific, Tyne & Wear, UK) to electrodeposit polyaniline.\nAniline buffer (pH 1-2) was prepared containing 0.5 mol l-1 KCl, 0.3 mol l-1\nHCl and 0.2 mol l-1 aniline. Phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) was prepared comprising\n52.8 mmol l-1 disodium hydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate, 13 mmol l-1 sodium\ndihydrogen orthophosphate 1-hydrate and 5.1 mmol l-1 sodium chloride. Acetate\nbuffer (pH 4.0) was prepared comprising 0.4 mol l-1 sodium acetate, 0.4 mol l-1 acetic\nacid and 0.4 mol l-1 sodium perchlorate.\nThe anti-digoxin was supplied as a solution in whole antiserum and was\npurified using a 5 ml protein G-column (Pharmacia). IgG fraction was eluted using\nglycine buffer (pH 2.7) and dialyzed overnight. For antibody biotinylation, the\nprocedure outlined in the BK101 kit was followed (see manufacturers instructions for\ndetails). The biotinylated anti-digoxin was very dilute (0.01 mg ml-1) and was\nconcentrated using a Centriprep centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK)\nfitted with an Ultracel YM-30 membrane containing glycerol, to prevent drying. This\nprocedure also ensured the removal of sodium azide from the antibody solution. The\nprocedure involved three subsequent centrifugations in a cold room (4\u00baC), each for 20\n8minutes at 30,000 rpm; the final concentration was 0.5 mg ml-1. Biotinylated\nantibodies were kept frozen in aliquots of 200 \uf06dl until required.\n2.2. Formation of microarrays.\nSonochemically fabricated microarrays were constructed as previously\ndescribed (Barton et al 2004). To deposit the insulating layer, a 5 mmol l-1 solution of\n1,2-diaminobenzene in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer was utilised. Prior to the immersion\nof the carbon electrode, the monomer solution used was thoroughly purged with N2\nfor 20 minutes in a sealed cell to provide an oxygen free atmosphere. An initial\n1-second blast of ultrasound was also applied to a submerged electrode to displace air\nbubbles trapped at the surface of the electrodes. Homogenous insulation of a planar\ncarbon electrode was achieved by sequentially scanning the working electrode\npotential from 0 mV through to +1000 mV (vs. Ag\/AgCl) and back to the starting\npotential at a scan rate of 50 mVs-1 for 20 sweeps.\nSonication experiments were performed using a custom built 2 kW, 25 kHz\nultrasound tank with internal dimensions of 750 x 750 x 600 mm (working volume\n750 x 750 x 500 mm) (Ultrawave Ltd., Cardiff, UK). Ultrasound was applied at a\nfrequency of 25 KHz for 10 seconds duration.\n2.3. Incorporation of antibody within microarrays via electrochemical deposition.\nA 0.2 M aniline hydrochloride solution was prepared in a pH 4.0 acetate\nbuffer. The solution pH fell to approximately 2.6 upon addition of monomer.\nMonoclonal antibody receptor was incorporated into the buffered monomer solution\nprior to polymerisation at a resultant concentration of 0.5 mg ml-1. The pH of the\nmonomer solution increases upon addition of antibody, this was monitored to ensure\n9the pH remained below 4.0 so that the conductive protonated \u2018emeraldine\u2019 form of\npolyaniline was deposited at the working electrode. Electrochemical deposition of the\npolyaniline was performed by sequentially cycling the working electrode potential\nfrom \u2013200 mV through to +800 mV (vs. Ag\/AgCl) and back to the starting potential\nat a scan rate of 50 mVs-1. A linear sweep from -200 to +800 mV (50 mVs-1) was\nperformed at the end of cyclic voltammetry to leave the polyaniline in its protonated\nemeraldine salt form. This lead to formation of polyaniline protrusions containing\nentrapped antibodies as previously described (Barton et al 2004, Law et al 2005).\n2.4. Construction of planar antibody electrodes via an affinity protocol\nAnti-digoxin was immobilised at the surface of planar electrodes by the\nmethods previously described (Garifallou et al 2007, Tsekenis et al 2008) and the\nimmunosensor structure is shown schematically in figure 2. The potentiodynamic\nelectrodeposition of polyaniline from aniline buffer, pH 1-2 into the microelectrode\narray was achieved electrochemically as described for the microarrays.\n30 \u03bcl of biotin-sulfo-NHS (10 mg ml-1 in water) was placed on the working\nelectrode surface for 24 hours. The sensors were rinsed with copious water and 30 \u03bcl\nof neutravidin (10 \u03bcg ml-1 in water) placed on the working electrode for 1 hour -\nfollowed by further rinsing in water. 30 \u03bcl biotinylated anti-digoxin (0.5 mg ml-1 in\nwater, 1 hour) was then added followed by rinsing. Finally, non-specific interactions\nwere blocked by HSA (10-6 mol l-1 in PBS, 1 hour).\n2.5. Determination of antigen concentration\nAC impedance measurements were performed using an ACM Auto AC DSP\nfrequency response analyser. Following immobilisation of antibody, impedance\n10\nanalyses were performed from 1 Hz to 10,000 Hz (+\/- 5 mV amplitude perturbation)\nin pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, i.e. containing no antigen, as a baseline trace. This buffer\nsolution did, however, contain a 50:50 mixture of [Fe(CN)6]3-\/4-, at a concentration of\n10 mmol l-1 as redox mediator so as to perform faradaic impedance spectroscopy. The\npotential of the electrochemical cell is offset to the formal potential of the redox probe\n(+0.12 V vs. Ag\/AgCl identified via amperometric cyclic voltammetry). Following\nthe recording of a baseline spectral trace (0 ng ml-1 antigen), the same sensor is used\nfor all concentrations and exposed for 30 minute time periods to the increasing\nconcentrations of antigen in phosphate buffered test solution.\nAfter each 30 minutes exposure to a known concentration, the sensor was\nthoroughly flushed with 50ml of pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (containing [KFe(CN)6]3-\/4-\n& no antigen) to remove any non-specifically adsorbed matter before ac impedance\nspectra were recorded in the phosphate buffered test solution (containing\n[KFe(CN)6]3-\/4- & no antigen). This sensor was then exposed to an increasing antigen\nconcentration and the process repeated for the full range of applied antigen\nconcentrations under investigation. Traces recorded may then be compared to the\nbaseline trace. Immunosensors were also tested where the electrode was exposed to a\ndiminishing series of antigen concentrations i.e. starting with the highest and gave\nsimilar results (Garifallou 2008).\nThe electrode assemblies were found to be very stable, for example a sensor\nplaced in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (containing [KFe(CN)6]3-\/4- showed no change in\nthe ac impedance curves even after 90 minutes equillibration (Tsekenis 2008).\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Impedance results for planar, affinity immobilised anti-digoxin electrodes:\n11\nFigure 3 shows the (a) Bode and (b) Nyquist curves obtained for a planar\npolyaniline\/anti-digoxin modified, carbon electrode exposed to various concentrations\nin the range of 0-10 ng ml-1of antigen. The Nyquist curve (figure 3b) demonstrates\nthat the Z' (real) component of the impedance increases steadily with decreasing\nfrequency whereas the Z\" (imaginary) component increases to a maximum value (at\nfrequencies in the range 5-10 Hz) before falling as the frequency approaches 1 Hz.\nThis type of impedance spectrum is indicative of a surface-modified electrode system\nwhere the electron transfer is slow and the impedance is controlled by the interfacial\nelectron transfer (Katz and Willner 2003).\nAs can be seen, there is a steady decrease in impedance as antigen\nconcentration increases towards a concentration of about 1.5 ng ml-1. Levels of 2 ng\nml-1 and 10 ng ml-1 did not lead to even lower impedances, but rather tend towards a\nplateau, indicating saturation of the specific binding sites. Any further changes in\nimpedance beyond 1.5 ng ml-1 are likely to be due to non-specific interactions. The\ncorresponding Bode plots (figure 3a) also show a decrease in the total impedance as\nthe digoxin levels increase. This indicates that the binding of digoxin is facilitating\nelectron transfer between the electrode and the redox probe. Since the therapeutic\nrange is 0.8-2.0 ng ml-1 (Terra et al 1999) this indicates that these sensors will be\nsufficiently sensitive and in fact there may be a need to undertake some dilution of the\nsample. However the range of these sensors is unfortunately rather small, which may\npreclude their use in real situations. What is of interest though is the much higher\nsensitivity compared to digoxin sensors fabricated by entrapment, indicating that\ncontrolled immobilisation does lead to enhanced sensitivity.\nThe impedance spectra consists of two components, the real (Z') component\nwhere the impedance in phase with the AC potential waveform is measured and the\n12\nimaginary (Z\") where the impedance is 180o out of phase. Previous work by our group\nhas demonstrated that in these type of systems, the increase in the real component\ndominated the total increase in the impedance and perhaps more importantly the real\ncomponent offers far greater reproducibility in comparison to the imaginary\ncontribution (Garifallou et al 2007, Tsekenis et al 2008).\nOur previous work demonstrated that the sensors of this type gave the largest\nrelative changes at the lower frequencies (Garifallou et al 2007, Tsekenis et al 2008).\nCalibration curves could be drawn (figure 4a) showing the percentage decrease in Z'\nat 1 Hz across a range of antigen concentrations. Again these show a relationship\nbetween antigen concentration and the decrease in Z\u2019.\nNon-specific interactions have the potential to either exaggerate or mask\nspecific interactions. Whereas specific binding of antigens will only occur when their\nantibodies is present, electrodes fabricated using a non-specific antibody should\nundergo the same non-specific binding events as those fabricated using specific\nantibodies. The calibration curve showing the percentage decrease in Z\u2019 at 1 Hz is\nshown for sensors fabricated using an identical protocol except that the specific\nantibody is replaced by a non-specific IgG antibody (figure 4b). As can clearly be\nseen, there is a much lower response for the non-specific antibody, showing that\nalthough there are non-specific interactions, between the concentration ranges of 0-2\nng ml-1, they comprise a minor component of the detected response.\nOnce the non-specific responses have been subtracted (figure 4a - figure 4b), a\ncorrected plot (figure 4c) shows the calibration curve for the corrected sensor\nresponse. Between a concentration range of 0-1.5 ng ml-1, there is a clear correlation\nof the corrected impedance change with the concentration. The limit of detection,\ncalculated as 3x the standard deviation of the baseline sample of this system\n13\n(Analytical methods committee, 1987) is approximately 0.1 ng ml-1. Our previous\nsystem using entrapment of digoxin within a polymer film combined with pulsed\nwaveform detection (Grant et al 2003) was only capable of resolving digoxin at levels\nhigher than 50 \u00b5g ml-1, so as can be seen the combination of an ac interrogation\nprotocol and an affinity based immobilisation procedure leads to at least a two orders\nof magnitude increase in sensitivity. The responses for 10 ng ml-1 digoxin (not shown\nin plots) were indistinguishable from those at 2 ng ml-1.\n3.2. Impedance results for entrapment immobilised anti-BSA microelectrodes:\nImpedance traces for polyaniline microelectrode sensors containing entrapped\nABSA were obtained as for the anti-digoxin based electrodes. These were very\nsimilar in appearance to those obtained for previous electrodes, again indicating a\nelectrochemical system where the electron transfer is slow and the impedance is\ncontrolled by the interfacial electron transfer (Katz and Willner 2003). Rather than\njust studying the change in Z\u2019 at 1 Hz, it was decided to undergo a more detailed\ninvestigation of the electrochemical system. A computer fitting of the experimental\ndata to a theoretical model, represented by a simple equivalent circuit, may be\nperformed by the software accompanying the frequency response analyser. In this\ncase, the interface is modelled by an equivalent circuit (supplementary information,\nfigure S3), also called a Randles circuit (Randles, 1947), consisting of a double-layer\ncapacitor in parallel with a polarization resistor (also known as a charge transfer\nresistor with certain constraints) and a Warburg impedance, connected in series with a\nresistor that measures the resistance of the electrolyte solution. For a more thorough\nevaluation of the data obtained, the changes in the Nyquist curves may be translated\ninto electron transfer resistance changes to provide a clear and consistent format.\n14\nThe relative electron transfer resistance changes from the baseline response at\neach concentration of BSA for a typical electrode modified with ABSA are plotted in\nfigure 5a. The electron transfer resistance increases with increasing BSA\nconcentration and demonstrates that an entrapped ABSA immunosensor gave a linear\nresponse to the analyte from 0 ng ml-1 to 100 ng ml-1 ABSA.\nThe insulation of the modified electrode upon formation of stable antibody-\nantigen immunocomplexes hinders the electron transfer kinetics of the redox probe\nresulting in the increase of electron transfer resistance. The electron transfer resistance\nincreases with increasing antigen concentration for both types of electrode. The limit\nof detection (three times the standard deviation of the baseline value) of the entrapped\nABSA immunosensor is 1 ng ml-1. There is negligible change from 100 ng ml-1 to 300\nng ml-1 suggesting that the immunosensor approaches saturation.\nNon-specific interactions have the potential to interfere with immunosensor\nperformance, leading to erroneously elevated results. For this reason, identical sets of\nimmunosensors were fabricated by both methods utilising a non-specific IgG antibody\nin place of the specific ABSA antibody. Results for these electrodes were obtained in\nexactly the same manner as for the specific electrodes. From the Nyquist plots for\nthese systems (not shown), it could be seen that while binding of BSA to the\nnon-specific immunosensors occurs, the responses are smaller than for ABSA\nmodified sensors. A calibration plot for this system can also be drawn (figure 5b) and\nshows a linear-type non-specific response is observed for the affinity based anti-IgG\nimmunosensor from 1 to 100 ng ml-1 BSA with a plateau above this concentration.\nUpon comparison of figure 5a with figure 5b, it is apparent that approximately 50% of\nthe ABSA-affinity immobilised sensor response encountered is, in fact, non-specific.\n15\nThis is most likely due to the fact that BSA is a protein with a high affinity for\nsurfaces and no blocking reagents have been utilised for these electrodes.\nTo obtain a calibration profile, in terms of \u2018corrected\u2019 electron transfer\nresistance change for an ABSA immunosensor, accounting for any non-specific\nresponses, the non-specific response was subtracted from the specific response over\nthe entire analytical concentration range. In total 10 ABSA immobilised sensors of\neach type and 10 corresponding anti-IgG immobilised sensors were interrogated over\ntheir active concentration range, to allow an assessment of the reproducibility of the\nresponses for this system. Results are presented in figure 6. The error bars are the\nstandard deviations obtained for the 10 matched sensor pairs from the mean\n\u2018corrected\u2019 values.\nFrom figure 6 a linear response was observed for the immunosensors from\n0-100 ng ml-1 BSA. Figure 6 (inset) shows an expanded view from 0 to 10 ng ml-1\nBSA and shows linear behaviour with R2>0.99. At concentrations above 100 ng ml-1,\nthe sensor becomes saturated. From the standard deviations obtained, we can say that\ndiscrimination of BSA antigen analyte is possible at 5 ng ml-1. The limit of detection\nof the ABSA immunosensor is 1.5 ng ml-1 BSA and is calculated from 3x the standard\ndeviation of the baseline response and extrapolated from the line of best-fit according\nto IUPAC guidelines (Analytical methods committee, 1987). Previous work (Grant et\nal 2003, 2005) allowed detection of BSA at levels as low as 10 \u00b5g ml-1. As can be\nseen the use of polyaniline microelectrodes has greatly increased sensitivity, although\nin this instance there is a problem with high non-specific responses.\n3.3 Stability of the BSA immunosensors and regeneration studies.\n16\nAlthough a long-term sensor stability test was not performed, a batch of 18\nsensor pairs was assessed from storage in dry state, at 4\u00baC, for a period of 12 weeks.\nAgain an identical experimental protocol was employed for electrochemical\nimpedance interrogation and the \u2018corrected\u2019 electron transfer change was the analysis\nmethod for response recovery.\nEvery 2 weeks a set of 3 matched sensor pairings was removed from storage\nand interrogated over the full BSA antigen analyte concentration range from 1 to 300\nng ml-1. After 2 weeks no loss of sensor response occurred but after 4 weeks there was\na 10% loss in response and further steady decreases until after 10 weeks storage only\n10% of the original response was detected.\nSome of our previous work demonstrated that acid washing of some\nimmunosensors led to their regeneration (Barton 2007). Attempts were made so see\nwhether it was possible to regenerate the sensors by acid washing. 5 ABSA-\nimmobilised sensors and 5 matched non-specific AIgG-immobilised sensors are\nexposed to the full interrogation procedure prior to reversibility investigations. In\norder to split the antibody-antigen complex and to regenerate the sensors, 0.1M HCl\nacidic buffer (pH 2.3) was applied for 3 separate 1 minute time periods. In between\neach acidic buffer exposure, pH 7.4 PBS was used to rinse the sensor surface. Finally\nthe sensors were rinsed with 50ml PBS to produce PSA-free sensors which could then\nbe used for fresh analysis. Unfortunately in all cases the washing removed all activity.\nAn identical baseline response could be achieved which suggests that the sensor\nsurface integrity remains, yet the antigen recognition and binding capabilities of the\nreceptor antibodies are severely damaged by the treatments.\n4. Conclusions\n17\nOur work verifies several fabrication techniques and an ac experimental\ninterrogation protocol as a viable approach towards the labeless sensing of BSA and\ndigoxin. Affinity based sensors where anti-digoxin is immobilised on planar\nelectrodes using avdin-biotin interactions have been shown to display much higher\nsensitivities (by two orders of magnitude, capable of detection of ng ml-1 levels of\nantigen) than sensors developed in earlier work utilising entrapment within planar\nconductive polymer electrodes as the method of immobilisation. Low non-specific\nbinding of these electrodes was also observed. However the range of these electrodes\nwas very limited which could preclude their use in real analyses.\nSimilarly sensors developed where ABSA is entrapped in conductive polymer\nmicroelectrodes rather than planar polymer films have been studied. The\nmicroelectrode array sensors were three orders of magnitude more sensitive, again\nallowing detection of ng ml-1 levels of antigen. These types of sensors however\ndisplayed higher non-specific binding. However BSA is a protein noted for its high\nbinding ability to surfaces and future sensors for other analytes will include a BSA\nblocking step to reduce non-specific interactions.\nThe next step involved combining these two methods in an attempt to enhance\nthe sensitivity levels even further. Sensors have been developed involving a multi-step\nprocedure. Initially conductive polyaniline microarrays were constructed. The\npolyaniline was then modified with biotinylating reagents and biotinylated antibodies\nimmoblised by the affinity procedures described above. Finally the sensors are\nblocked with HSA. Ongoing work has demonstrated the construction of sensors for\nprostate specific antigen, neuron specific enolase and the stroke marker protein\nS-100[\u03b2]. These immunosensors have been shown capable of quantifying antigens\nat levels as low as 1 pg ml-1, these will be the subject of a further series of\n18\npublications to be submitted for publication shortly and will be described in detail at\nthe 10th World Congress in Biosensors, Shanghai, May 14th-18th 2008.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work, including funding for ACB, G-Z G, GT and FD, has been supported by the\nEuropean Community QLRT-2001-02583 (SMILE) and NMP2-CT-2003-505485,\n(ELISHA) Framework VI contracts.\nReferences\nAnalytical Methods Committee, 1987.
