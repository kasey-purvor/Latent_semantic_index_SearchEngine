Scope: monograph\/advanced text. Level:\npostgraduate and professional physicist.\nWhy do physicists devote serious time and effort to the study of continuous (i.e. 2nd\norder or lambda) phase transitions, given that most of the phase changes in nature are\nactually discontinuous (1st order)? Igor Herbut poses this highly pertinent question near\nthe beginning of his book, which is devoted to the critical phenomena that occur near\ncontinuous transitions. He also provides the answer: the experimental observation that\nmany physical properties close to a continuous transition turn out to be the same for\ncompletely different physical systems, a fascinating and seemingly counter-intuitive re-\nsult. The occurrence of this universal behaviour shows that continuous phase transitions\nare independent of the underlying inter-particle interactions, which seems astonishing at\nfirst sight. Although there are, in fact, different universality classes depending on quan-\ntities like dimensionality and symmetry, the physicist can feel satified that he or she is\nstudying truly fundamental phenomena. Thus the results obtained are of broad relevance\nto systems as diverse as e.g. critical point phenomena in condensed matter, liquid helium,\nsuperconductiviy, magnetic systems, and the early universe.\nThe origin of the text lies partly in a course of graduate lectures on the theory of phase\ntransitions and renormalization group at Simon Frazer University. The opening chapter\nsets the scene with accessible introductory accounts of phase transitions, the Ising, XY\nand Heisenberg models, critical exponents, universality, scaling and correlations. The\nmain part of the book then follows, with chapters covering Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson\ntheory, the renormalization group, and then applications to different examples of contin-\nuous transitions. The latter include the superconducting, lower-dimensional, Kosterlitz-\nThouless, higher dimensional, and quantum phase transitions. There are appendices on\nthe Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, the linked cluster theorem and gauge-fixing for\nlong-range order, followed by a select bibliography.\nThe physics of the superfluid phase transition provides an underlying theme running\nthroughout most of the book. The author explains in the Preface that there are three\ngood reasons for this. First, Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson theory is most naturally introduced\nfor a system of interacting bosons and can then easily be generalized for other univer-\nsality classes. Secondly, the superfluid order parameter accommodates vortices which, as\nthe simplest topological defects, play an important role at the transition. Thirdly, the\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 50, 483-484 (2009).\nsuperfluid critical point is the best quantified phase transition in nature \u2013 the celebrated\nlambda-point experiment on the Space Shuttle having provided excellent data over six\norders of magnitude in the temperature difference from the transition \u2013 and therefore the\nmost stringent test of the theory.\nIt is evident that much care and thought have been applied to optimizing the pre-\nsentation and content. Each chapter starts with a succinct summary explaining in about\nthree sentences its purpose and content. Numerous worked examples are provided and,\nunusually, these are placed within the text with the fully-worked solution following im-\nmediately after the statement of the problem in each case. The exposition is careful and\nprecise, with well-chosen words, and an empathy with the reader which is all-too-often\nmissing in advanced texts of this kind. It is an excellent, accessible and very well written\nbook covering an important but difficult topic, and it is a pleasure to be able commend\nit warmly to both PhD students and lecturers working in the area.\nPeter V.
