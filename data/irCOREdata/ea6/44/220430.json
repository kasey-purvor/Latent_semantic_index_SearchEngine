INTRODUCTION \n \nMost states in the world grant the right to vote in political elections to some people who \ndo not live in the state\u2019s territory (and possibly never have done or never will). Non-\nresidents are allowed to cast their vote from abroad in 115 out of 214 countries of the \nworld.\n2\n Furthermore, the uptake of such rights is sometimes substantial. For instance, \nabout 2.6 million non-residents were eligible to vote from abroad in Italy\u2019s 2006 \nparliamentary elections and about 1.1 million actually voted, constituting 2.6 per cent of \nall ballots cast. Such extraterritorial voting rights are sometimes commended for \nacknowledging the realities of globalization and human mobility across borders. A \n                                                 \n1\n I owe a special debt of gratitude to Robert Goodin for many helpful suggestions.

While completing this \narticle, I benefitted from an Open Society Institute research grant. I remain responsible for the \narticle\u2019s shortcomings. \n2\n Carlos Navarro Fierro, Isabel Morales and Maria Gratschew, \u2018External voting: a comparative \noverview\u2019, Voting from Abroad: The International IDEA Handbook (Stockholm: International \nInstitute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, 2007), pp.11-34, at p. 11. The figure includes \nautonomous territories. \n 2 \nmember of the Italian parliament elected in the \u2018Africa-Asia-Oceania-Antarctica\u2019 \nconstituency hailed them as a form of \u2018global citizenship.\u20193 Cosmopolitans, however, \nare more likely to approve of the general principle of extraterritorial voting rights than \nof the reasons why some individuals enjoy them and others do not. As Rainer Baub\u00f6ck \nhas noted,\n4\n extraterritorial voting rights are usually justified with reference to ethnic-\nnationalist arguments, and states reserve them for \u2018nationals\u2019, i.e. people with a \nprivileged legal status that is usually acquired through descent from another national \nand, less commonly, by being born in the state or through a naturalization procedure. \n But what reasons would be more congenial to cosmopolitan sensibilities? \nCosmopolitans (and not only they) often believe that people who are significantly \naffected by a policy decision should have an opportunity to influence that decision. This \n\u2018all-affected principle\u2019 arguably requires the extension of participatory entitlements \nbeyond the circle of resident and non-resident nationals, to include also those who are \nneither residents nor nationals but are nevertheless significantly affected by the policy \ndecisions of the state.  \nHowever, it is also true that most residents are likely to be affected more directly and \nintensely by the decisions of any particular state than most non-residents. Despite \ngrowing global interdependence, jurisdictional boundaries still constrain the ability of a \nstate to get hold of people and coerce them into obeying its laws and paying taxes. \nInterpretations of the all-affected principle that are sensitive to differences in \naffectedness thus suggest that it would be wrong to grant participatory entitlements to \nnon-residents on the same footing as residents. This creates a conundrum: if the all-\naffected principle is regarded as a valid basis for assigning participatory entitlements to \nindividuals, how should those entitlements be distributed in a world where jurisdictional \nboundaries between states matter in determining patterns of affectedness \u2013 but only to \nsome extent? \nThis article presents a solution to this conundrum. The solution is called \u2018fuzzy \ncitizenship\u2019, and consists in an approach to the democratization of the global order that \n                                                 \n3 Simone Battiston and Bruno Mascitelli, \u2018The challenges to democracy and citizenship \nsurrounding the vote to Italians overseas\u2019, Modern Italy, 13 (2008), 261-280 at p. 274. \n4\n Rainer Baub\u00f6ck, \u2018Stakeholder citizenship and transnational political participation: a normative \nevaluation of external voting\u2019, Fordham Law Review, 75 (2007), 2393-2447. \n 3 \ndoes not place direct constraints on what states can or should do (the \u2018output\u2019 side of \nstate action) but changes the set of people to whom they owe participatory entitlements \n(the \u2018input\u2019 side). Fuzzy citizenship has the following key features: (a) it is based on \nterritorial jurisdictions with authority over a broad or almost unlimited set of issues \u2013 \nmost importantly, on states as they exist today; (b) participatory entitlements with \nregard to the decision-making process of those jurisdictions are accorded to all those \nwho are likely to be causally affected by any possible decision under any possible \nagenda,\n5\n rather than only to individuals with a privileged legal relationship to the \njurisdiction (nationals) or those formally bound to comply with policy decisions because \nof their presence on the territory (residents); (c) participatory entitlements vary \ndepending on the likelihood that decisions will have a significant impact on the interests \nof individuals;\n6\n (d) since the likelihood of significant impact can only be determined on \nthe basis of the resources controlled by jurisdictions, rather than on the basis of the \ncontent of possible decisions, jurisdictions that control a larger stock of resources \nshould be obliged to grant more say to extraterritorial voters than jurisdictions that \ncontrol a smaller stock of resources. These features can be institutionally realized in a \nnumber of ways, the simplest of which is the following: the legislature of each state \nshould grant voting power to representatives elected by all non-residents in proportion \nto the share of world income under the control of that state. While this is not the only \ninstitutional reform that could realize fuzzy citizenship, its relative simplicity makes it a \nuseful point of reference for the discussion that follows. An important caveat is that this \n                                                 \n5\n This formulation of the all-affected principle stems from Robert Goodin and is discussed \nbelow in section III. Robert E. Goodin, \u2018Enfranchising all affected interests, and its alternatives\u2019, \nPhilosophy and Public Affairs, 35 (2007), 40-68. \n6\n The fuzzy citizenship approach is therefore based on the proportionality principle: see Harry \nBrighouse and Marc Fleurbaey, \u2018Democracy and proportionality\u2019, Journal of Political \nPhilosophy, 18 (2010), 137-155. \u2018Proportional citizenship\u2019 could be another suitable descriptor \nfor the institutional arrangements proposed here. On the tension between \u2018numerical equality\u2019 \nand \u2018proportional equality\u2019 see Sofia N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m, \u2018Democracy counts: problems of equality in \ntransnational democracy\u2019, Transnational Actors in Global Governance, ed. C. J\u00f6nsson and J. \nTallberg (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010). \n 4 \narticle addresses only the desirability of this institutional innovation and does not \ndiscuss the conditions under which it may become politically feasible.\n7\n \nThe article is organized as follows. Section I presents the proposal in greater detail. \nSection II justifies the proposal by showing how it addresses problems of \nunderinclusiveness and overinclusiveness in light of the all-affected principle. Section \nIII compares fuzzy citizenship with other blueprints for global institutional reform \u2013 \nworld federalism, global stakeholder democracy, and \u2018functional, overlapping and \ncompeting jurisdictions\u2019 \u2013 and examines their relative ability to reduce \noverinclusiveness and underinclusiveness.   \n \n \nII. DESCRIPTION OF FUZZY CITIZENSHIP \n \nOver forty years ago, Robert Dahl examined the maxim \u2018Everyone who is affected by \nthe decisions of a government should have the right to participate in that government\u2019 \nand noted that, for all its problems, it \u2018is very likely the best general principle of \ninclusion that you are likely to find\u2019.8 Various issues and problems raised by Dahl in \nrelation to that maxim have since been discussed and elaborated, and new arguments \nrelating to the all-affected principle have been developed. However, one remark made \nby Dahl has generated little discussion: the all-affected interests principle \u2018forces us to \nask whether there is not some wisdom in the half serious comment of a friend in Latin \nAmerica who said that his people should be allowed to participate in our elections, for \nwhat happens in the politics of the United States is bound to have profound \n                                                 \n7\n For general discussions on the empirical feasibility of global democratization see Mathias \nKoenig-Archibugi, \u2018Is global democracy possible?\u2019, European Journal of International \nRelations, Published online before print June 16, 2010; Mathias Koenig-Archibugi, \u2018Global \ndemocracy and domestic analogies\u2019, Global Democracy: Normative and Empirical \nPerspectives, ed.

Authority in a Good Society (New Haven: Yale University \nPress, 1970), p. 64. \n 5 \nconsequences for his country.\u2019 Dahl added: \u2018Do not dismiss his jest as an absurdity. In a \nworld where we all have a joint interest in survival, the real absurdity is the absence of \nany system of government where that joint interest is effectively represented.\u20199  \nPerhaps the lack of attention towards Dahl\u2019s remark is due to the fact that, as Robert \nGoodin has noted, by labelling it \u2018half-serious\u2019 it was left \u2018hovering uneasily in that \ninfamous argumentational no-man\u2019s land between QED and reductio [ad absurdum]\u2019.10 \nThis article aims at rescuing it from that unfortunate condition. \nThe possibility of granting some form of representation for extraterritorial interests in \nstate institutions has not completely been ignored since Dahl wrote those words. \nPhilippe Schmitter proposed a system called \u2018reciprocal representation\u2019, whereby states \nthat are highly interdependent accord each other a number of seats \u2013 perhaps two or \nthree \u2013 in their respective national legislative chambers.11 The reciprocal representatives \nwould have the right to speak on the floor and, in time, possibly acquire the right to \nvote. For Schmitter, such an arrangement would be especially desirable and acceptable \nin the case of neighbouring countries and members of free trade areas such as NAFTA \nand MERCOSUL. From the point of view of the all-affected principle, a crucial \nlimitation of the proposal is that cross-national affectedness is often radically \nasymmetric. For instance, citizens of Nicaragua are significantly more affected by \npolicies decided by the U.S. government than U.S. citizens are affected by Nicaraguan \npolicies. An institutional blueprint that does not take such asymmetries into account is \nunlikely to make substantial progress towards realizing the all-affected principle. \nMore recently, a very weak form of \u2018external representation\u2019 has been proposed by \nDavid Miller for cases in which a state is considering a coercive policy that would have \nexternal impacts.\n12\n Miller suggests that before the decision is taken, representatives of \nother states that will feel the impact of the decision should be invited to put their case to \nthe legislature of the first state, without the right to vote on the decision. While \n                                                 \n9\n Dahl, After the Revolution? p. 67. \n10\n Goodin, \u2018Enfranchising all affected interests, and its alternatives\u2019, at p. 64. \n11\n Philippe C.

Entities that owe participatory entitlements. In contrast to other proposals for \nglobal democratization that focus on specialized and nongovernmental organizations \n(see section IV), fuzzy citizenship applies primarily to decision-making units that \ncombine two features: they are able to exercise effective authority over a territory in a \nway that is ultimately backed by coercive capabilities; and their authority applies to a \nwide and possibly open-ended range of policy issues. A number of entities possess \nthose features at least to some extent, notably provinces in federal states and the \nEuropean Union. But they most clearly characterize states as we know them today. \nTherefore, while the proposal may be extended to every multifunctional decision-\nmaking unit endowed with coercive authority, in the interest of simplicity the remainder \nof this article refers to \u2018states\u2019.   \nFurthermore, I assume that within each state it is possible to identify an organ that \nhas the twin function of taking fundamental decisions on how to use the authority of the \nstate and of \u2018representing\u2019 those who are subject to that authority. While such organs \nhave many different names, they are called \u2018legislatures\u2019 here. The following discussion \nskips over the diversity of ways in which legislative powers are exercised in existing \nstates \u2013 e.g. bicameralism, the role of the executive in legislation, constitutional review \nof statutory legislation by the judiciary, and so on \u2013 and instead is based on a stylized \naccount of how regulative and allocative policy decisions are made within state \njurisdictions.  \nOne question needs to be addressed now, however. Most existing legislatures claim \nto represent \u2018the people\u2019, but in many cases this \u2018representation\u2019 is arguably far from \nsatisfying minimal standards of democracy. Any proposal that advocates some kind of \nextraterritorial representation thus faces an obvious problem: what should be done about \nlegislatures that do not provide adequate democratic representation even for \u2018insiders\u2019? \n 7 \nThere are at least two possible answers to this question. The first answer is that \nparticipating legislatures must be fully democratic, and specifically be legitimized by \nfree and fair elections, before the idea of extending the circle of represented interests \ncan even be entertained. This could be called a \u2018thick\u2019 version of extraterritorial \nrepresentation. This position could entail either that the establishment of a global system \nof extraterritorial representation must wait until all states have become democracies, or \nalternatively that existing democracies should accord participatory rights to each other\u2019s \ncitizens and progressively include the citizens of other states as they become \ndemocratic. The second possible answer is that nondemocratic forms of political \nrepresentation are compatible with external representation: it would suffice that in each \nlegislature the affected extraterritorial interests are represented according to the same \n(democratic or nondemocratic) standards as nationals.\n13\n This would be a \u2018thin\u2019 version \nof external representation. Since the fuzzy citizenship approach is rooted in the all-\naffected principle, which is generally interpreted as a foundational principle of \ndemocracy, it is naturally close to the thick version. However, it is compatible with a \ndistinction between a transitional phase, during which various forms of political \nrepresentation coexist, and a steady-state phase, which is reached when democratic \nrepresentation is all-pervasive.   \n 2. Beneficiaries of participatory entitlements. Under a fuzzy citizenship regime, \nparticipatory entitlements with regard to the selection of members of state legislatures \nare to be extended well beyond the circle of individuals with a privileged legal \nrelationship to the state (\u2018nationals\u2019) or those formally bound to comply with legislative \ndecisions because of their presence on the territory (\u2018residents\u2019). Participatory \nentitlements should be accorded to anyone who is likely to be significantly affected by \n                                                 \n13\n On the issue of nondemocratic standards of valid political representation see Andrew Rehfeld, \n\u2018Towards a general theory of political representation\u2019, Journal of Politics, 68 (2006), 1\u201321. On \nthe issue of non-electoral standards of valid democratic representation see Terry Macdonald, \nGlobal Stakeholder Democracy: Power and Representation beyond Liberal States (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, 2008) and Michael Saward, \u2018Authorisation and authenticity: \nrepresentation and the unelected\u2019, Journal of Political Philosophy, 17 (2009), 1\u201322.  \n 8 \nany possible decision taken under any possible agenda.\n14\n Since individuals can be \naffected by the exercise of state power in a myriad of specific causal relationships that \ntranscend territorial borders, this expansive \u2018affectedness\u2019 criterion means that some \nform of \u2018citizenship\u2019 (understood as political status entailing participatory rights) may \nhave to be expanded well beyond anything so far contemplated even by the states with \nthe most generous and inclusive citizenship admission policies.  \n3. Full and partial citizenship. Under a fuzzy citizenship regime, citizenship ceases \nto be an all-or-nothing affair. Individuals can be full citizens or fully non-citizens, but \nalso partial citizens of a state. A useful way to think about this revised conception of \ncitizenship is in terms of fuzzy-set logic, which was first proposed by Lofti Zadeh and \nlater developed by many scholars.\n15\n The key feature of fuzzy sets is that they embody \nboth qualitative states, i.e. full membership and full nonmembership in a set, and \nvariation by level, i.e. degrees of membership between 0 and 1. This feature has made \nthe approach fruitful in a number of disciplines, such as mathematical logic, computer \nscience, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.\n16\n The basic idea can also be \napplied to normative and legal concepts such as citizenship. Thinking in terms of fuzzy \nsets is especially useful when observers of a certain property in a number of elements \ncan identify one or two thresholds. There is a lower threshold when it makes sense to \ndifferentiate elements on the basis of the degree to which they possess that property \nwhen the value of the property is above that threshold but not when it is below. \nElements that are below the threshold can be all considered fully out the relevant set, \nwhereas elements that are above the threshold are either partially or fully in the set. \nConversely, there is a higher threshold when it makes sense to differentiate elements on \n                                                 \n14\n This formula is based on Goodin, \u2018Enfranchising all affected interests, and its alternatives\u2019. \nSection III of this article elaborates on its implications. \n15\n Lofti Zadeh, \u2018Fuzzy sets\u2019, Information and Control, 8 (1965), 338-353. \n16\n See for instance Sen\u00e9n Barro and Roque Marin (eds), Fuzzy Logic in Medicine (Heidelberg: \nPhysica-Verlag, 2002); John Harris, Fuzzy Logic Applications in Engineering Science \n(Dordrecht: Springer, 2006); Charles Ragin, Fuzzy-Set Social Science (Chicago: University of \nChicago Press, 2000); Terry D. Clark, Jennifer M. Larson, John N. Mordeson, Joshua D. Potter \nand Mark J. Wierman, Applying Fuzzy Mathematics to Formal Models in Comparative Politics \n(Berlin and Heidelberg: Springer, 2008). \n 9 \nthe basis of the degree to which they possess that property when the value of the \nproperty is below that threshold but not when it is above. Elements that are above the \nthreshold can be all considered fully in the relevant set, whereas elements that are below \nthe threshold are either partially or fully out the set.  \nThis reasoning can be applied to the problem at hand. The relevant property of \nindividuals is the likelihood of being affected by decisions taken by a given state \n(affectedness, for short). A threshold is given by the circumstance that some individuals, \nby virtue of their being residents on the territory of the state, are \u2018subject\u2019 to its direct \nand coercion-backed authority. Such individuals are equally entitled to \u2018full\u2019 citizenship, \ni.e. to full and equal participatory entitlements. By contrast, non-residents may be \n\u2018affected\u2019 by but not \u2018subjected\u2019 to the authority of a state, and this justifies partial \ncitizenship, i.e. participatory entitlements that are weaker than those associated with full \ncitizenship.\n17\n But how much weaker should they be? In other words, what degree of \ncitizenship should states grant to non-residents? This question is addressed next.\n18\n \n                                                 \n17\n Also Bruno Frey advocates a form of \u2018partial citizenship\u2019, as well as \u2018multiple citizenship\u2019, \nbut he conceptualizes it in a fundamentally different way. Frey\u2019s partial citizenship would allow \nan individual to be a citizen of a political unit with respect to one particular function and a \ncitizen of another political unit with respect to other functions; Frey\u2019s multiple citizenship \nwould involve splitting up the citizenship of persons simultaneously working and living in \ndifferent countries.

The general topic of \u2018global citizenship\u2019 is \nanalysed by Luis Cabrera, The Practice of Global Citizenship (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2010). \n18\n In addition to the fact that, as noted in the introduction, most states of the world allow \nextraterritorial voting, it may be of interest that some states establish de facto differential voting \nrights for resident and non-resident voters. In Croatia, France, Italy, Portugal, Algeria, Angola, \nCape Verde, Mozambique, Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, the votes of citizens abroad are not \nadded to the votes of resident citizens, but used to elect special representatives with reserved \nparliamentary seats. See Navarro Fierro et al. \u2018External voting\u2019, at p. 28. The proportion of seats \nreserved for expatriate representatives as a percentage of total seats in parliamentary assemblies \nranges from 0.6% (in Colombia) to 8.3% (in Cape Verde). The effect of such arrangements is \nusually that the \u2018weight\u2019 of the votes of expatriates is significantly lower than the weight of \nresidents\u2019 votes.

Under a fuzzy citizenship regime, the \ndegree of citizenship that states should grant to non-subjects varies from state to state. \nThe likelihood that a non-subject will be affected by a state\u2019s decision - any possible \ndecision taken under any possible agenda \u2013 depends primarily on the resources that are \ncontrolled by that state. Hence, non-subjects should be granted relatively high degrees \nof partial citizenship by resource-rich states, and relatively low degrees of partial \ncitizenship by resource-poor states. In short, extraterritorial participatory entitlements \nshould be proportional to the resources controlled by the state. \nIt is possible that some kinds of resources are unlikely to have an impact on non-\nsubjects, whatever decision is taken about their use. What kind of resources should enter \nin the calculation?\n19\n A first step towards answering this question consists in the \ndistinction between fungible resources, which are convertible into one another in the \nshort or long run, and resources that are strictly not convertible. Fungible resources \ninclude tangible assets such as land, natural resources, factories, infrastructure, goods, \nweapons, etc, as well as intangible assets such as skills and \u2018social capital\u2019. Ideally, all \nfungible resources should be included in the calculation of extraterritorial participatory \nentitlements, since decisions on whether and how to convert them are likely to affect all \nnon-subjects. This is because even if the current form of the resource cannot affect \nthem, a \u2018converted\u2019 form probably would. By contrast, strictly nonfungible resources do \nnot necessarily affect non-subjects, or affect only a subset of them, which suggests that \ntheir likely effect would need to be considered case by case. However, since the set of \nstrictly non-fungible resources is small and possibly empty, this issue will not \nconsidered further here. \nConsidering that the set of fungible resources is very heterogeneous, how should the \nvarious categories be aggregated for the purpose of calculating the proportion of votes \nthat states should assign to extraterritorial constituencies, i.e. to partial citizens? \n                                                                                                                                               \ninstance, there was one parliamentary seat for every 76,171 eligible electors voting in Italy, and \none parliamentary seat for every 225,615 eligible electors voting abroad (own calculations \nbased on Ministero dell\u2019Interno, Archivio storico delle elezioni, http:\/\/elezionistorico.interno.it). \nAs voter turnout was significantly higher in Italy than abroad, the difference between \nseats\/voters ratios was substantially lower than the difference between seats\/electors ratios. \n19\n I am grateful to Robert Goodin for highlighting important issue. \n 11 \nUnfortunately there is no straightforward answer to this question. One possible solution \nconsists in focusing on the most \u2018fungible\u2019 kind of resource, which is probably national \n\u2018income\u2019 as captured by GDP. This shortcut would allow the application of very general \nrules, such as the rule that, in the legislature of each state, the percentage of seats for \nextraterritorially elected representatives should relate to the percentage of world GDP \nunder the control of that state, taking into account what proportion of world population \nis already made up by full citizens of that state.\n20\n \nTo be sure, several other calculation methods are plausible. Researchers of the \nCorrelates of War project have created a Composite Index of National Capability, which \nis computed by summing all observations on each of six capability components (total \npopulation, urban population, iron and steel production, energy consumption, military \npersonnel, and military expenditure), converting each state's absolute component to a \nshare of the international system, and then averaging across the six components. One \nlimitation of this index is that it does not capture an important aspect of material \ncapability such as the possession of nuclear weapons, although it is plausible to \nmaintain that the other components are correlated with the potential possession of \nnuclear weapons in the future, which would be consistent with the argument about \nfungible resources developed earlier. Another limitation of an index of material \ncapabilities is, of course, that it does not include intangible and ideational resources, \n                                                 \n20\n One possible formula could be: Se\/Sj = (GDPj\/GDPw)\u00b7(POPw-POPj)\/POPw, where Se\/Sj is the \nratio of extraterritorial seats over total seats in the legislature of state j,  GDPj is the gross \ndomestic product of j, GDPw is the world\u2019s gross domestic product, POPj is the population \nresiding in j, and POPw is total world population. For illustration, the following table provides \ncalculations for two large rich countries, a large poor country, a small rich country and a small \npoor country, in 2009 (data from World Development Indicators). \n GDPj\/GDPw (POPw-POPj)\/POPw Se\/Sj    (% of seats) \nUSA 0.284 0.955 0.271  (27.1%) \nJapan 0.123 0.981 0.121  (12.1%)  \nIndia 0.022 0.829 0.018  (1.8%) \nSweden 0.0071 0.9986 0.0071  (0.7%) \nCosta Rica 0.0006 0.9992 0.0006  (0.0%) \n \n 12 \nalthough also in this case an argument about correlation between material and ideational \nresources could be made. \nWhile the question of how to operationalize the principle of proportionality between \nresources and extraterritorial votes would inevitably be the subject to debate and \ncontestation, the next section will argue that the principle itself is an appropriate way of \nrealizing the all affected principle in a world of uneven interdependence. \n21\n \n 5. Constitutional decisions. Decisions that concern the basic rules and functioning of \nthe fuzzy citizenship regime require special procedures. These decisions include which \nresources should enter into the calculation of extraterritorial participatory entitlements, \nthe formula according to which resources are translated into seats, and how to assess \nwhether states have correctly applied the rules about extraterritorial representation. \nEveryone in the world would be affected by such \u2018constitutional\u2019 decisions in equal \ndegree, and hence everyone should have an equal chance to participate in taking them. \nThe most straightforward way of implementing this requirement is to create a global \nassembly whose members are either elected directly by citizens around the world or are \nchosen by state legislatures. Since such a body would be concerned only with settling \nconstitutional questions and ensuring the proper functioning of the regime, it may \nconvene only occasionally on the basis of need.   \n \n \nIII. JUSTIFICATION OF FUZZY CITIZENSHIP \n \nThe introduction stated that fuzzy citizenship would provide a way of realizing the all-\naffected principle in a situation in which jurisdictional boundaries between states \ndetermine patterns of affectedness, but only to some extent. This section aims at \nsubstantiating this assertion. \nThe principle that people who are significantly affected by a policy decision should \nhave an opportunity to influence that decision underlies a range of diagnoses of political \nlegitimacy under conditions of global interdependence. For instance, David Held argued \n                                                 \n21\n External representatives may be excluded from voting on decisions that pertain only very \nweakly and indirectly to a state\u2019s use of scarce resources, for instance on traffic regulations. \n 13 \nthat globalization undermines a key assumption of traditional democratic thought: the \nassumption of a \u2018symmetrical\u2019 and \u2018congruent\u2019 relationship between \u2018decision-makers\u2019 \nand \u2018decision-takers\u2019. Democracy is challenged by \u2018the divergence that sometimes \nexists between the totality of those affected by a political decision and those who \nparticipated in making it (however indirectly) within a democratic state\u201922. \nDiagnoses of this kind are often based, implicitly or explicitly, on some version of \nthe all-affected principle. The principle itself has deep roots in history. The formula \n\u2018Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur\u2019 (what affects all should be approved by \nall), which is found in Justinian\u2019s Code, was first used in a constitutional rather than \nprivate law sense in the thirteenth century, most famously in the writ by King Edward I \nof England that summoned the bishops and abbots to the so-called Model Parliament of \n1295\n23\n. Most generally, the principle can mean that those affected have a veto on the \ndecision (a literal reading of Justinian\u2019s formula); or that they are entitled to a vote (a \nweaker version already accepted in medieval theory and practice); or that they are \nentitled to voice, i.e. to be heard in a genuinely deliberative process. In this article, I \nassume that the principle is about voting rights, although many of the arguments \npresented here also apply to an interpretation stressing the right to express views and \nconcerns in the context of a deliberative process leading to a decision.  \nAs noted above, recent discussions of the principle owe much to the influence of \nDahl. It has been invoked by other prominent political theorists, e.g. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, \nwho stated that \u2018[d]eficits in democratic legitimation arise whenever the set of those \ninvolved in making democratic decisions fails to coincide with the set of those affected \nby them.\u201924  Important recent defences of the principle have been presented by Ian \nShapiro and Robert Goodin.\n25\n Jeremy Waldron has gone as far as describing the \nprinciple \u2018what touches all should be decided by all\u2019 as \u2018entirely unexceptionable\u2019.26 \n                                                 \n22\n David Held, Democracy and the Global Order (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995), at p. ix. \n23\nGaines Post, 'A Roman legal theory of consent, quod omnes tangit, in medieval representation', \nWisconsin Law Review 1950 (1950), 66-78. \n24\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Time of Transitions (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2006), at p. 78, emphasis \nremoved. \n25\n Ian Shapiro, Democratic Justice (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999); Ian Shapiro, The \nMoral Foundations of Politics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003); Goodin, \n 14 \nThe all-affected principle is useful to the extent that it provides a general criterion for \nassessing existing and hypothetical institutional arrangements. In order to perform this \nfunction, the principle needs to be disaggregated into more specific criteria. A first \nrelevant distinction is between the ability of institutional arrangements to reduce \n\u2018underinclusiveness\u2019 and their ability to reduce \u2018overinclusiveness\u2019. Moreover, \nunderinclusiveness and overinclusiveness can themselves be broken up into more \nspecific concepts and criteria.  \nThe likelihood that an institutional arrangement will be underinclusive depends to a \nsignificant extent on how the all-affected principle is understood. Goodin has probably \nprovided the most expansive, and also most coherent and cogent, interpretation of the \n                                                                                                                                               \n\u2018Enfranchising all affected interests, and its alternatives\u2019. For a discussion of the principle and \nfurther references to works that refer to it see Sofia N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m, \u2018The challenge of the all-affected \nprinciple\u2019, Political Studies, Article first published online on 10 June 2010. The relationship of \nthe principle with other approaches to \u2018constituting the demos\u2019 is examined by Christian List \nand Mathias Koenig-Archibugi, \u2018Can there be a global demos? An agency-based approach\u2019, \nPhilosophy and Public Affairs, 38 (2010), 76-110.  \n26\n Jeremy Waldron, Law and Disagreement (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999), at p. 114. In fact, \nseveral authors have taken exception to the principle, or accepted it only in a substantially \nqualified form. Some reject the principle and want to replace it with something else, for instance \nHans Agn\u00e9, \u2018A dogma of democratic theory and globalization: why politics need not include \neveryone it affects\u2019, European Journal of International Relations, 12 (2006), 433-458; Raffaele \nMarchetti, Global Democracy - For and Against: Ethical Theory, Institutional Design and \nSocial Struggles (London and New York: Routledge, 2008). Others develop what can be seen as \nrestrictive variants of the all-affected principle, where participatory entitlements are justified \nonly in relation to particular types of impact; for instance Carol C. Gould, Globalizing \nDemocracy and Human Rights (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); Macdonald, \nGlobal Stakeholder Democracy. Others yet argue that any application of the principle must be \nsubject to stringent constraints and provisos, for instance Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State, and \nUtopia (Oxford: Blackwell, 1974), at pp. 268-271. It is not possible to address such objections \nand qualifications here. I assume without further argument that the all-affected principle is \naccepted as a valid foundation for assigning participatory entitlements, that its application \nshould be suspended only in order to protect human rights, and that those human rights do not \ninclude the exclusive control over resources beyond what is necessary to keep out of poverty. \n 15 \nprinciple: a say should be given to anyone who might possibly be affected by any \npossible decision arising out of any possible agenda, and not just those who are actually \naffected by the course of action actually decided upon.\n27\n He also notes that the logical \nimplication of this interpretation may well be that virtually everyone in the world should \nbe entitled to vote on any proposal or any proposal for proposals. The risk that any \ninstitutional arrangement may fail to reach this demanding standard and produce \nunderinclusiveness is clearly very high.  \nGoodin\u2019s formula is particularly useful because the distinction between specific \ndecisions and agendas allows us to introduce a distinction between two kinds of \nunderinclusiveness. One kind consists of being excluded from making decisions on a \npredetermined set of options. The other kind consists of being excluded from decisions \non what options should be decided upon. Of the two kinds of underclusiveness \u2013 which \ncan be called \u2018option-underinclusiveness\u2019 and \u2018agenda-underinclusiveness\u2019 respectively \n\u2013 the latter is arguably the most fundamental, and it violates one of the basic criteria for \ndemocracy stressed by Dahl: \u2018The members must have the exclusive opportunity to \ndecide how and, if they choose, what matters are to be placed on the agenda.\u201928 In \npractice, agenda-underinclusiveness is much more likely than option-\nunderinclusiveness: most people may not be affected by any of the options that actually \nare on the table in any given decision-making situation, but may well be affected by \noptions that might hypothetically be placed on the table.   \nThe second criterion for assessing institutional designs is their ability to reduce \noverinclusiveness. Again, we can distinguish between two types of overinclusiveness. \nOne type occurs whenever someone who is not affected by a decision is allowed to take \npart in making it. This can be called \u2018absolute\u2019 overinclusiveness. How serious is the \nrisk of absolute overinclusiveness? It appears remote for any institutional arrangement \nthat aims to realize Goodin\u2019s most expansive interpretation, i.e. to secure the inclusion \nof anyone who might possibly be affected by any possible decision arising out of any \npossible agenda. Goodin himself, however, notes that a somewhat different and more \ndefensible interpretation, which requires the inclusion of anyone who might probably \n                                                 \n27\n Goodin, \u2018Enfranchising all affected interests, and its alternatives\u2019. \n28\n Robert A. Dahl, On Democracy (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), at p. 38. \n 16 \n(as opposed to possibly) be affected by any possible decision arising out of any possible \nagenda, reduces the expansionary implications of the all-affected principle. This is the \ninterpretation adopted in this article.\n29\n \nThe second type of overinclusiveness can be called \u2018relative\u2019 overinclusiveness. If \nabsolute overinclusiveness occurs whenever someone not affected by a decision is \nallowed to take part in making it, relative overinclusiveness occurs whenever someone \nwho is (probably) less affected by a decision is included in the same way and to the \nsame extent as someone who is (probably) more affected by it. A way to express \ndifferences in the degree of affectedness is the notion of an individual\u2019s \u2018stake\u2019, which \ncan be defined as \u2018the pay-off difference between the better option from the individual\u2019s \nperspective and the worse one\u201930 Insofar as stakes as well as participation in decision-\nmaking are a matter of degree rather than a matter of all-or-nothing, absolute \noverinclusiveness is just a special case of relative overinclusiveness, namely a situation \nwhere the stake is \u2018zero\u2019 and participation is \u2018full\u2019. \nRelative overinclusiveness is related to what Dahl called the \u2018problem of intensity\u2019 in \ndemocratic theory, i.e. how to deal with situations in which a minority prefers an \nalternative much more \u2018passionately\u2019 than the majority prefers a different alternative. \nDahl suggested that the failure to take into account differences in intensity, especially in \nsituations where minorities with intense preferences are systematically outvoted by \nmajorities with weak preferences, contravenes the principle of equal consideration and \n                                                 \n29\n Goodin suggested that overinclusiveness may not be a cause for concern even if it were to \noccur. He points out that, if people are required to vote on some issue that does not affect their \ninterests, they will randomly distribute themselves equally across all options, leaving the overall \noutcome unaltered. In other words, including people who are not affected will not change the \ncontent of the decision. While this may show that overinclusiveness may not be a problem in \ntheory, it still represents a massive problem for the purposes of institutional design. Creating \neffective opportunities for people to participate in a decision involves costs, which would be \nwasted if participants were not affected by the outcome. Allowing everyone to take part in any \ndecision irrespective of whether they would be affected by it would constitute a massive \nviolation of what Dahl called the \u2018criterion of economy\u2019.

The remainder of this section shows \nhow fuzzy citizenship can reduce them simultaneously. \nFirst, fuzzy citizenship reduces underinclusiveness because it assigns participatory \nentitlements to people who are not nationals but are affected by the decisions taken by \nthe relevant legislature. A critical advantage of fuzzy citizenship is that it would reduce \nnot only option-underinclusiveness but also agenda-underinclusiveness. This is because \nit applies to decision-making units whose authority extends to a wide and possibly \nopen-ended range of policy issues. In contrast to other entities such as \nintergovernmental organizations, NGOs, and companies, the range of policy decisions \nthat can be placed on the agenda of state legislatures is not constrained by a specialized \n\u2018mandate\u2019. It is usually the case that state legislatures can legitimately place on the \nagenda any decision except those that would infringe human rights. Within this \nconstraint, states are general-purpose entities that decide about the extraction of \nresources and their allocation to a wide range of tasks, as well as about setting rules for \na variety of social domains. Therefore access to state legislatures enables individuals to \nprotect a wide range of their interests rather than only those stemming from particular \nsocial roles.  \nSecond, fuzzy citizenship avoids overinclusiveness because it does not assign equal \nparticipatory entitlements to anyone who may possibly be affected by any possible \n                                                 \n31\n Robert A. Dahl, A Preface to Democratic Theory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, \n1956), pp. 91-102. \n32\n Brighouse and Fleurbaey, \u2018Democracy and proportionality\u2019; Macdonald, Global Stakeholder \nDemocracy. Some authors defend this position on utilitarian grounds: failure to take intensities \ninto account produces socially inefficient decisions, as the sum total of pay-offs across the \ngroup is lower than it could be otherwise. Marc Fleurbaey, \u2018One stake one vote\u2019, unpublished \npaper, 2008; see also Conradt and List, \u2018Group decisions in humans and animals\u2019. \n 18 \ndecision under any possible agenda of any state legislature. A critical advantage of \nfuzzy citizenship is that it would address relative overinclusiveness (and ipso facto \nabsolute overinclusiveness). This is so because it is based on a dual set of differentiation \ncriteria: one that differentiates between beneficiaries of participatory entitlements \n(people) and another that differentiates between the entities that owe such entitlements \n(states). These criteria will be considered in turn. \nWith regard to the first differentiation, fuzzy citizenship avoids relative \noverinclusiveness because it recognizes that there is normally an important difference in \nlikely impact between those who are directly subjected to the coercion-backed authority \nof a state (generally because they reside within the jurisdictional boundaries of that \nstate) and those that are affected by its decisions in other ways. As the former are \nequally \u2018subject\u2019 to the authority of the state, they should be entitled to equal and full \ncitizenship in the state. In terms of fuzzy set logic, they pass an intensity threshold of \naffectedness beyond which any further difference is irrelevant.\n33\n People over whom the \nstate has no authority find themselves in a different position: they may be more or less \naffected by it, but the mere fact of not being subjects of the state entitles them to less \nthan full citizenship, i.e. partial citizenship.\n34\n  \nAre there are reasons for differentiating further among those non-subjects and assign \ndifferent degrees of partial citizenship to different categories of non-subject? Since their \n                                                 \n33\n In principle it could be argued that some residents are less \u2018subject\u2019 than others and therefore \nentitled to less than full citizenship. For instance, residents of a country X who have a \nguaranteed right to enter and settle in another country (e.g. because they are nationals of that \ncountry and left it voluntarily) might be seen as not being subject to the coercive authority of \nstate X to the same degree as residents who do not have such a guaranteed entry and settlement \nright (e.g. because they are not nationals of any other state apart from X). The question is then \nwhether better opportunities for \u2018exit\u2019 should result in weaker opportunities for \u2018voice\u2019. Whether \nthis or any other differentiation between residents would be justified under any circumstance is \nsimply noted here as a question that may deserve further consideration. \n34\n Sofia N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m has contrasted the all-affected principle with the \u2018all-subjected principle\u2019, \naccording to which those subject to a rule should also be its authors. N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m, \u2018The challenge \nof the all-affected principle\u2019. In the fuzzy citizenship approach, \u2018being subject\u2019 is a special case \nof \u2018being affected\u2019 that justifies stronger but not exclusive claims to citizenship.  \n 19 \naffectedness has to be assessed in relation to any possible decision arising from any \npossible agenda, the answer is probably no: all non-subjects should be entitled to the \nsame degree of partial citizenship. On the other hand, it could be argued that some non-\nsubjects are more affected by the decisions of a state whatever that decision might be, \nfor instance because poverty or refugee status places them in a particularly vulnerable \nposition. I will not pursuing this question further here, except to note that there might be \nsome good reasons for distinguishing among non-subjects on the basis of general \nvulnerability.\n35\n \nWith regard to the second differentiation mentioned above, the one relating to states, \nfuzzy citizenship reduces relative overinclusiveness because it does not impose the \nsame participatory requirements on all states. As noted in the previous section, \nextraterritorial participatory entitlements should be proportional to the resources \ncontrolled by the state. Why this emphasis on resources? Recall the formulation of the \nall-affected proposed by Goodin: a say should be given to anyone who might probably \nbe affected by any possible decision arising out of any possible agenda. In general, the \nimpact of any decision depends on the content of the decision and on the resources that \nthe decision-making unit could use to implement them. Of these two elements, the \ncontent of decisions cannot be used to determine who should have a say, because the \ncontent will probably depend on who has a say. Hence, the impact of decisions needs be \ndetermined solely on the basis of how many resources are at the disposal of the \ndecision-making unit.\n 36\n Non-subjects have a higher probability of being significantly \naffected by a more resourceful decision-making unit than by a less resourceful decision-\nmaking unit. Indeed, many decision-making units, including some states, do not possess \nsufficient resources to be likely to affect any non-subjects in a significant way, whether \nbeneficially or harmfully. Those units may be required to offer weak or no participatory \nentitlements to non-subjects either if the former can affect the latter significantly but \nonly with a very low probability or if they can affect them with high probability but \n                                                 \n35\n On the issue of granting more voting rights to the poor see Brighouse and Fleurbaey, \n\u2018Democracy and proportionality\u2019.  \n36\n In contrast to Ian Shapiro, for whom \u2018the franchise is best defined activity by activity, \ndecision by decision\u2019, I maintain that it can only be defined decider by decider. Shapiro, \nDemocratic Justice, p. 235. \n 20 \ninsignificantly. In sum, fuzzy citizenship reduces relative overinclusiveness by linking \nthe extent of extraterritorial representation in states to the probability of them having a \nsignificant effect, via the resources they control.\n37\n \nIn section II, a class of decisions was singled out as requiring a special procedure \nbecause of their \u2018constitutional\u2019 nature. These decisions concern the basic parameters \nand workings of the fuzzy citizenship regime. It was proposed to reserve these decisions \nto a special global assembly, whose members could be either elected by all citizens or \nchosen by all state legislatures. The justification for this special arrangement is that \neveryone would be affected by these decisions, and there is no reason to expect that \nsome would be more affected than others. Since by design states do not offer equal \nopportunity for influence to everybody, those constitutional decisions need to be taken \nby an ad hoc body that offers such equal opportunities. It should be noted that this \narrangement addresses an alleged difficulty of the all-affected principle, which is that \nthe problem of defining democratically who is affected and therefore entitled to vote \nproduces \u2018a regression from which no procedural escape is possible\u2019.38 The institutional \nsolution proposed here does not lead to such an infinite regression: since everyone is \nequally affected by the basic rules of the fuzzy citizenship regime, everyone should \nhave an equal opportunity to shape them.   \n \n \n                                                 \n37\n Even a relatively weak state or non-state actor might have a significant impact on specific \nindividuals when it concentrates its limited resources to uses that are detrimental to them. The \nbest way to deal with this kind of situation is to create a system of obligations to provide ex post \nredress and compensation, not a duty to offer ex ante participation entitlements.    \n38\n Frederick G.

COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FUZZY CITIZENSHIP \n \nFuzzy citizenship is only one of many proposals aimed at reducing the \u2018democratic \ndeficit\u2019 of global society.39 Even if the arguments presented in section III are persuasive \nand it is accepted that fuzzy citizenship would promote the realization of the all-affected \nprinciple, this would not necessarily mean that fuzzy citizenship is the best way of \ndoing so. Such a conclusion could only stem from a comparative assessment. This \nsection presents some building blocks for such a comparative assessment, with the aim \nof stimulating further analysis and debate.  \n This section cannot provide a detailed discussion of specific institutional blueprints, \nand instead it aims at identifying how general design choices are likely to affect the \nability of the proposed institutions to minimize both underinclusiveness and \noverinclusiveness. From this perspective, two dimensions of institutional variation seem \nespecially important. The first dimension concerns the nature of governance in general, \nand is based on the distinction between a \u2018pyramidal\u2019 type of governance in which \nvarious nested decision-making units have competencies over a range of issues and \nthere is no or little territorial overlap among them, and a \u2018polycentric\u2019 system of \ngovernance in which governance units are functionally specific and have significant \nterritorial overlap with one another. The second dimension relates more specifically to \nthe all-affected principle and depends on whether the proposed institutional mechanisms \nrequire or merely allow consideration of the fact that actual or potential participants in \ntransnational democratic institutions are unlikely to have equal stakes or equally intense \npreferences on all issues that are to be decided collectively. \nWith regard to the first dimension, virtually no supporter of \u2018transnational \ndemocracy\u2019 thinks of it in terms of a centralized state. Almost all models expect \nauthority to be diffused, accepting the plea by Dahl and Edward Tufte: \u2018Rather than \nconceiving of democracy as located in a particular kind of inclusive, sovereign unit, we \n                                                 \n39\n For overviews see Anthony McGrew, \u2018Transnational democracy: theories and prospects\u2019, \nDemocratic Theory Today, ed. G. Stoker and A. Carter (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2002), pp. \n269\u2013294; and Daniele Archibugi, Mathias Koenig-Archibugi and Raffaele Marchetti, \n\u2018Introduction: mapping global democracy\u2019, Global Democracy: Normative and Empirical \nPerspectives. \n 22 \nmust learn to conceive of democracy spreading through a set of interrelated political \nsystems, sometimes but not always arranged like Chinese boxes, the smaller nesting in \nthe larger\u2019.40 However, supporters of transnational democracy disagree on whether the \n\u2018nestedness\u2019 referred to by Dahl and Tufte should be the rule or the exception. Adapting \nfor our purposes a typology of multilevel governance proposed by Liesbet Hooghe and \nGary Marks,\n41\n approaches to transnational democracy can be distinguished according to \nwhether they envisage overlapping governance units forming a polycentric system or \nalternatively nested governance units forming a pyramidal system. In a pyramidal \nsystem, a range of different competencies and governance tasks are bundled in a limited \nnumber of jurisdictions operating at different, usually territorial \u2018levels\u2019. There is no \noverlap between these jurisdictions at each territorial level, and the units at each level \nare \u2018nested\u2019 within those at the next higher level, so that there is one and only one \nrelevant jurisdiction at any particular territorial scale. By contrast, in a polycentric \nsystem governance is exercised by a large number of functionally specific and \nspecialized units, none of which has exclusive authority over a territory.  \nThe second dimension of institutional design relates to the consideration of the \nintensity of affectedness. Institutional rules can require sensitivity to variation in \naffectedness or they can merely allow it. Such variation can be accommodated even in \ninstitutional arrangements that do not explicitly and formally recognize their relevance. \nTheoretical and empirical work on established democratic states suggests that electoral \nincentives, by pushing elected representatives to take into account the salience of issues \nfor different groups of voters, allow members of minorities to exert disproportional \ninfluence on the issues they most care about.\n42\n Moreover, vote trading among elected \n                                                 \n40\n Robert A.

Forms of transnational democracy \n \nAs shown in Figure 1, these two dimensions can be used to identify four categories \nof transnational democracy models. The remainder of this section examines whether \nthree prominent models of transnational democracy, which are located in cell 1, 2 and 3 \nin Figure 1, might address problems of underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness more \neffectively than fuzzy citizenship, which is located in cell 4. The three models are the \n\u2018functional, overlapping and competing jurisdictions\u2019, which have been proposed by \nBruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger; \u2018global stakeholder democracy\u2019, which has been \nproposed by Terry Macdonald; and world federalism, which has been advocated by a \nvariety of authors such as, recently, Raffaele Marchetti. Some of the remarks on world \nfederalism also apply to the \u2018cosmopolitan democracy\u2019 approach developed by Daniele \nArchibugi and David Held.\n44\n \n                                                 \n43\n James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, The Calculus of Consent (Ann Arbor: University of \nMichigan Press, 1962). \n44\n Bruno S. Frey and Reiner Eichenberger, The New Democratic Federalism for Europe: \nFunctional, Overlapping, and Competing Jurisdictions (Cheltenham: E. Elgar, 1999); \nMacdonald, Global Stakeholder Democracy; Marchetti, Global Democracy \u2013 For and Against; \nHeld, Democracy and the Global Order; Daniele Archibugi, The Global Commonwealth of \nCitizens: Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2008). \n 24 \n Two caveats should be noted. First, the authors of those models do not necessarily \njustify them with reference to some version of the all-affected principle, but may use \ndifferent normative yardsticks. The aim of this section is not to assess how well the \nproposed institutions are likely to achieve goals set by their authors, but how and how \nwell they would meet the assessment criteria outlined in the previous section. Second, \nthe models have different approaches to the decision-making units that may or may not \nhave to grant participatory entitlements. Some \u2013 notably global stakeholder democracy \nand fuzzy citizenship \u2013 aim mainly at \u2018democratizing\u2019 existing decision-making units. \nThe task is to add participatory mechanisms to those decision-making units. Others \u2013 \nnotably functional, overlapping and competing jurisdictions, and world federalism \u2013 aim \nat creating new decision-making units, which would incorporate democratic \nparticipatory mechanisms by design. \nFrey and Eichenberger argue that significant welfare gains would ensue from \nopening the market for government services to a range of public jurisdictions that \nspecialize in the provision of particular services to individual citizens or communes, \nwith none of those jurisdictions monopolizing authority over a particular territory. They \ncall such entities \u2018FOCJ\u2019 (Functional, Overlapping and Competing Jurisdictions \u2013 the \nsingular being \u2018FOCUS\u2019). They are functional in the sense that their size and \ngeographical coverage are determined by the specific task to be performed, notably by \nissue-specific trade-offs between closeness to consumers and economies of scale. They \nare overlapping in the sense that the boundaries of different FOCJ do not coincide, and \nthat several of them may operate in the same geographical area, providing a different or \nthe same type of service. They are competitive because they incorporate two \nmechanisms of competition: citizens or communes can exit FOCJ and join others, which \nensures market-like competition between FOCJ; and citizens or communes have voting \nrights on policy decisions and on the election of politicians and managers running the \nFOCUS, which promotes political competition within FOCJ. Finally, FOCJ are \njurisdictions, because they have power to regulate and to tax their members. Their \nmembers may be either individuals or the smallest political units (\u2018communes\u2019) with all \ntheir citizens \u2013 the choice of type of membership will depend on the type of service to \nbe provided.   \n 25 \nHow does this proposal cope with the problems of underinclusiveness and \noverinclusiveness, as they have been defined in the previous section? FOCJ can produce \nintrasectoral and intersectoral, positive and negative externalities. For instance, waste \ndisposal through incineration generates negative environmental externalities for non-\nmembers. This creates the potential of underinclusiveness, if members are unwilling to \nlet affected outsiders participate in decisions. Recycling schemes, on the other hand, \nreduce the emission of greenhouse gases and thus generate positive environmental \nexternalities for non-members. This may create a different risk of underinclusiveness, as \nnon-members may refuse to join the scheme in order to avoid contributing to its cost. \nFOCJ will be underinclusive whenever members are interested in externalizing costs \nand reject the inclusion of affected outsiders, and whenever outsiders are interested in \nbenefiting from positive externalities and prefer not to join the FOCUS that produces \nthem. This is partly due to the voluntary nature of FOCJ. But it also depends on the fact \nthat FOCJ are functionally specific: since they specialize in the production of one type \nof good, various kinds of decisions are not likely to be on the agenda. This results in \nagenda-underinclusiveness. Members of a FOCUS have a say on how the resources it \nraises should be used to provide a good or service, rather than considering every \npossible use that could be made of those resources. Fuzzy citizenship is more effective \nat avoiding these problems of underinclusiveness, because full citizens do not have the \nright to exclude non-residents from (partial) citizenship, and the multifunctional nature \nof states means that full and partial citizens can decide to use the resources controlled \nby the state in any way they wish. \nFurthermore, the absence of explicit mechanism for taking the preference intensity of \nmembers into account exposes FOCJ to the risk of relative overinclusiveness. Frey and \nEichenberger acknowledge that the single-issue character of FOCJ means that intense \npreferences cannot be revealed through vote trading, but they argue that intense \npreferences can be accommodated in other ways.\n45\n First, members with intense \npreferences are more likely to participate in votes and elections for FOCJ positions, and \ntheir particularly intensive demands may be taken into account by other members. The \nproblem with these informal mechanisms is that the likelihood of active participation \n                                                 \n45\n Frey and Eichenberger, New Democratic Federalism for Europe, pp. 11-12. \n 26 \nand the responsiveness of other members to one\u2019s demands are dependent not only on \nthe intensity of preferences but also on a range of other factors, and the risk is that \nstructurally disadvantaged members may become disenfranchised rather than \nempowered through them. Second, Frey and Eichenberger note that \u2018minorities with \nintensive preferences can establish a FOCUS designed to care for their special interests\u2019. \nHowever, in some cases such separate FOCJ would forfeit economies of scale in the \nproduction of collective goods, and as a result a FOCUS that is more responsive to \npeople with certain interests may also be less able to satisfy them. Special FOCJ for \npeople with intense preferences may also increase the risk of exposing minorities to the \nexternalities produced by majorities, so that relative overinclusiveness is reduced at the \ncost of creating underinclusiveness. These problems are unlikely to emerge in a fuzzy \ncitizenship regime, since it incorporates a basic rule for differentiating between more \naffected and less affected people and it does not hinder vote trading as a way of taking \ninto account more fine-grained differences in affectedness. \nWhereas Frey and Eichenberger are mainly concerned with the creation of new \nentities that would provide collective goods more efficiently, and give reasons why they \nshould be governed democratically, Terry Macdonald\u2019s \u2018global stakeholder democracy\u2019 \nis based on the observation that today power \u2013 crucially, power that impacts in \nproblematic ways upon the capacity of individuals to lead autonomous lives \u2013 is already \nexercised not only by states but also by a variety of nonstate actors that operate across \nstate borders, such as NGOs, transnational corporations and intergovernmental \norganizations. Given the existence of these decision-making units, the problem is to \ncreate participatory mechanisms involving groups of individuals whose autonomy is \nmost deeply affected by those decision-making units. In global stakeholder democracy, \nwhat here is called absolute overinclusiveness could be kept in bounds by according \nparticipatory entitlements to affected individuals.\n46\n What here is called relative \n                                                 \n46\n In Global Stakeholder Democracy, Macdonald adopts stricter criteria for assigning \nparticipatory entitlements to individuals, as they are due \u2018only in relation to those forms of \npower that impact in problematic way upon their autonomy\u2019, i.e. their capacity to \u2018formulate \nand effectively pursue authentic personal goals\u2019 (p. 41 and p. 37) and moreover only by agents \nwho are somehow responsible for their autonomy, where responsibility must determined \npolitically for each context (p. 87). She also points out that in \u2018common-sense moral shorthand\u2019 \n 27 \noverinclusiveness is limited by creating a decision-making context in which the \nsubstance of stakeholders\u2019 interests is treated as subjective but the intensity of interests \ncan be \u2018objectively\u2019 assessed. In the liberal pluralist representative ideal underlying the \nmulti-stakeholder model, the decision-making process is thus divided in two stages. In \nthe first stage, electoral or non-electoral mechanisms of authorization and accountability \nprovide stakeholder representatives with mandates that reflect their constituents\u2019 \nsubjective interests. In the second stage, stakeholder representatives make final \ndecisions on the basis of a deliberative process that takes into account the interests of all \nstakeholders, and specifically \u2018objectively\u2019 assesses the relative intensity of the \nconflicting interests of various stakeholder constituencies. In other words, the tension \nbetween competing stakeholder claims are not solved by stakeholder representatives \nthrough aggregative mechanisms such as voting, but through deliberative judgements \nbased on shared standards of \u2018rationality\u2019 and \u2018reasonableness\u2019.47 \nThe ability of global stakeholder democracy to reduce overinclusiveness and \nunderinclusiveness, as they have been defined in the previous section, is subject to \nsignificant limitations because of two reasons. First, its ability to address relative \noverinclusiveness depends on the effectiveness of deliberation as a mechanism for \nproducing agreement. As Macdonald acknowledges, deliberation may fail to perform \nthis function and decision-making may ultimately have to be based on aggregative \nmechanisms.\n48\n Fuzzy citizenship provides an aggregative solution that guarantees \nconsideration of intensities even when deliberation fails to produce agreement. \nSecond, global stakeholder democracy could result in significant levels of \nunderinclusiveness because individuals are represented according to issue areas.\n49\n As \nnoted above, individuals can be affected not only by the decisions that are actually made \nbut also by decisions that could have been made, yet were not made. Restricting the \nactivities of agents to specific issues or issue areas, even with broad boundaries, often \n                                                                                                                                               \nthere is a link between responsibility one the one hand and \u2018action\u2019 as opposed to \u2018omission\u2019 on \nthe other hand (p. 38). By contrast, the interpretation of the all-affected principle adopted in this \narticle does not privilege action over omission. \n47\n Macdonald, Global Stakeholder Democracy, pp. 146-50. \n48\n Macdonald, Global Stakeholder Democracy, p. 159. \n49\n Macdonald, Global Stakeholder Democracy, p. 158. \n 28 \namounts to narrowing the range of possible options and producing what here is called \nagenda-underinclusiveness. For illustration, consider the example of a NGO with a \nmandate to promote labour rights that has to decide how to allocate a substantial amount \nof funds among a wide range of possible activities, such as providing direct income \nsupport to workers in need in poor countries, financial and organizational support for \ncreating labour unions, child care for working mothers, schooling for child labourers, \nand other tasks. It is conceivable that none of those issue-specific activities would have \na significant impact on the interests or autonomy of many people with HIV\/AIDS in a \npoor country. If so, those people with HIV\/AIDS would have no legitimate claim to \nparticipate in the decisions of that NGO, even though the resources controlled by the \nNGO could make a substantial difference to their quality of life if the funding of health \ncare were included on the agenda. This situation is a consequence of an a apriori \nlimitation of the range of options available to the NGO.\n50\n \nBy contrast, as noted several times in this article, fuzzy citizenship addresses the \nproblem of agenda-underinclusiveness by extending participation in decision-making \nunits with an unrestricted agenda rather than an issue-specific mandate \u2013 states. But how \ndoes fuzzy citizenship deal with the forms of power that global stakeholder democracy \nis meant to target, i.e. non-state power exercised by large transnational corporations, \nNGOs, and intergovernmental organizations? States should normally be able to regulate \nnon-state actors operating on their territory, and therefore citizens of states should be \nable to affect the decisions of those non-state actors indirectly through their influence on \nstate regulatory policy. Elsewhere I have argued that, at least in the case of transnational \ncompanies, this indirect form of control can fail because of four reasons: regulatory \ncompetition, collusion between state officials and companies, subversive activities by \n                                                 \n50\n Macdonald recognizes the problem of alternative uses of resources and notes that, \u2018[o]nce we \nview the impact of NGOs\u2019 activities in light of opportunity-costs as well as their actual \noutcomes, we see that the impact for which they should be accountable are very similar to those \nof elected state governments with respect to resource allocation\u2019. Macdonald, Global \nStakeholder Democracy, p. 79. But a key feature of state governments, which set them apart \nfrom most other actors, is that their decision-making competencies extend to all issues \u2013 their \nagendas are not restricted in any way, unless such a restriction stems from a prior constitutional \nand\/or democratic decision.  \n 29 \ncompanies, and state weakness.\n51\n If fuzzy citizenship were to ameliorate \n\u2018accountability\u2019 gaps due to state weakness, it would be only indirectly and in the long \nrun. But a fuzzy citizenship regime would probably address competitive deregulation \nmore directly: companies would find it more difficult to avoid stringent regulation by \nthreatening to shift operations across borders and playing states against each other, if the \ninterests affected by those companies were represented in the legislatures of their home \ncountry and at the same time in a variety of potential host countries. Similarly, collusion \nbetween companies and officials of host states, and covert subversion of the political \nsystem of host states, could be reduced if the interests of people in host states were \nrepresented in the legislature of home state, which would be likely to provide an \nadditional, and probably substantial, constraint on company behaviour. \nIf agenda-underinclusiveness is a persistent problem for proposals that focus on the \ndemocratization of issue-specific organizations, we need to examine whether it may be \nless of a problem for institutional models that occupy the third cell of Figure 1, \nspecifically world federalism. According to the federal approach, underinclusiveness \ncan be reduced by shifting authority over a particular issue area \u2018upwards\u2019, i.e. to a more \nencompassing decision-making unit. Similarly, overinclusiveness can be reduced by \nshifting decision-making authority \u2018downwards\u2019, i.e. to smaller territorial units that are \n\u2018nested\u2019 in the larger one. The principle of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019 is often invoked as a criterion \nfor allocating authority over policy areas among territorial levels, including in proposals \nfor global democratization,\n52\n but the principle itself is subject to several alternative \ninterpretations, as Andreas F\u00f8llesdal has shown.\n53\n  \nThe federal approach to minimizing underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness has \nsome limitations. The allocation of authority over a certain policy area to a certain \ngovernance unit results in a restriction of the decision-making agenda for all other \ngovernance units, at the same or at a different level. This can result in option-\nunderinclusiveness as well as agenda-underinclusiveness. Option-underinclusiveness \nremains a problem when the choice among the options on the agenda of a given \n                                                 \n51\n Mathias Koenig-Archibugi, \u2018Transnational corporations and public accountability\u2019, \nGovernment and Opposition, 39 (2004), 234-259. \n52\n Held, Democracy and the Global Order; Marchetti, Global Democracy \u2013 For and Against. \n53\n Andreas F\u00f8llesdal, \u2018Subsidiarity\u2019, Journal of Political Philosophy, 6 (1998), 190-218.  \n 30 \ngovernance unit affects people who are outside of the territorial jurisdiction of that \ngovernance unit. This can be avoided only if the agenda of governance units were to \ninclude only options about which it can be said that no one outside the geographical \nboundaries of that unit would be affected by which one among them is chosen. To the \nextent that few policy issues can be circumscribed within neat territorial boxes, \nminimizing underinclusiveness may require the centralization of most or nearly all \ndecisions at the most inclusive level, i.e. the global level. \nAgenda-underinclusiveness remains a problem under federal arrangements because \ntheir proper functioning depends on a relatively stable definition of what is and what is \nnot on the agenda of each governance unit, whereas the all-affected principle (at least in \nthe version adopted here) applies principally to the determination of the agenda itself. A \nprior and all-inclusive decision on the content of any agenda before votes on any \noptions are cast is probably not compatible with most interpretations of federalism as \nsystem of multilevel governance. \nFederalism is vulnerable to these problems because it lacks some crucial features of \nfuzzy citizenship. Fuzzy citizenship reduces the problem of option-underinclusiveness \nderiving from extraterritorial externalities by overcoming the dichotomy of citizens who \nhave a say and non-citizens who have no say at all. By assuming that all, or virtually all, \nchoices about the use of scarce resources may have an extraterritorial effect and \ntherefore give rise to extraterritorial participatory entitlements, fuzzy citizenship reduces \nunderinclusiveness. Crucially, the fuzzy citizenship approach does not achieve this \nreduction in underinclusiveness at the cost of increasing relative overinclusiveness: \nsince it assumes that residents are normally affected more strongly than non-residents \nby the decisions of territorial authorities, it maintains that the former should have a \ndifferent, and stronger, citizenship status than the latter. By abandoning the constraint \nthat people have to be either citizens or non-citizens of any given governance unit, \nfuzzy citizenship can address option-underinclusiveness and relative overinclusiveness \nmore effectively than federalism.  \nFuzzy citizenship also solves the problem of agenda-underinclusiveness that creates \ndifficulties for federalism: as indicated in section II, a fuzzy citizenship regime applies \nto multifunctional territorial units whose substantive agenda is not restricted, either by \n 31 \nfederal rules of competence or by specialized mandates. Full and partial citizens \nparticipate in determining the agenda as well as in choosing options from that agenda. \nWhile the substantive agenda of territorial units would not be restricted under a fuzzy \ncitizenship regime, there would be some procedural restrictions: as noted above, the \nbasic rules of a fuzzy citizenship regime would affect everybody equally, and thus they \ncannot be placed on the agenda of states, which offer unequal participatory entitlements. \nThe difference between federalism and fuzzy citizenship is that the former would assign \nto the \u2018global\u2019 level of authority a (potentially very wide) range of substantive \ncompetences in addition to procedural competences, whereas under fuzzy citizenship \nglobal institutions would focus on the procedural dimension. However, the fuzzy \ncitizenship approach has important points of convergence with federalist approaches \nthat emphasise the \u2018constitutive\u2019 and \u2018dispute-resolving\u2019 role of global representative \ninstitutions.\n54\n \n \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \n   \nIn contrast to world federalism, fuzzy citizenship does not entail the creation of a global \ngovernment with substantive competences. In contrast to global stakeholder democracy, \nfuzzy citizenship does not require the addition of mechanisms of stakeholder \nrepresentation for thousands of non-state organizations that may affect people\u2019s ability \nto live autonomous lives. As proposals for reducing the global democratic deficit go, \nfuzzy citizenship could even be seen as requiring relatively modest institutional \nadjustments: as noted in the introduction, most states already allow non-residents to \nvote from abroad, and realizing the proposal would essentially entail dropping the \nrequirement that those electors must be \u2018nationals\u2019 of the state. \n Of course, matters are not so simple. Before any such institutional adjustments \nbecome conceivable, let alone feasible, a major conceptual adjustment is required: \ncitizenship must no longer be seen as an all-or-nothing affair. This article has argued \n                                                 \n54\n Notably Marchetti, Global Democracy \u2013 For and Against. \n 32 \nthat, since different states have different impacts on different people, citizenship should \nbe differentiated as well. \n It is easy to develop this kind of arguments in academic journals. Another thing is for \npolitical entrepreneurs to move from abstract blueprints to programmes for political \ntransformation that can attract the support of a broad coalition. Whatever the merits of \nthe institutional change proposed in this article, the author of this article harbours no \nillusions that such a supporting coalition is likely to materialize. On the contrary, the \noutlook is certainly not rosy. One key obstacle to any programme for global \ndemocratization is, of course, the political construction of self-interest. U.S. President \nLyndon B. Johnson warned in 1966 that \u2018There are 3 billion people in the world and we \nhave only 200 million of them. We are outnumbered 15 to 1. If might did make right \nthey would sweep over the United States and take what we have. We have what they \nwant.\u201955 Johnson was speaking to troops stationed in Korea, and his speech implied that \nAmericans had the might as well as the right to keep what they had. Political leaders \nmay not always express such views so bluntly, but they are still predominant, and \ncosmopolitan advocates face an uphill battle in persuading the mighty to revise their \nviews of what is right.  \n As noted above, the implementation of the fuzzy citizenship proposal would require \na major conceptual shift in addition to major changes in norms and interests. It would be \nwrong to rule out the possibility of substantial conceptual innovations on the part of \ninfluential political entrepreneurs, and thus to condemn academic explorations into this \nunknown terrain as entirely futile. Shift happens.
