An alternative definition has been proposed by Harold Frost, suggesting that osteopenia is the bone\u2019s physiological response to disuse. On the contrary, true osteoporoses imply the bone\u2019s inability to adapt to the loads imposed on them by their habitual mechanical usage. As a consequence, fractures occur with no or very little trauma in osteoporotic, but not in osteopenic bones. There is now ample evidence that mechanical stimuli can increase strength. Accordingly, exercise, in particular some new forms of it that involve high strain rates, seems to be preventing bone loss and possibly also induces increases in bone mass even at older ages. Hence, exercise may ameliorate osteopenia in the sense of Frost\u2019s definition. However, exercise must be feared to facilitate rather than to ameliorate the occurrence of true osteoporoses, e.g., due to microdamage accumulation. This is in sharp contrast to the general \u2018understanding\u2019.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/24\/11RITTWEGER.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>The International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-03-31T12:46:11Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>The Journal of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions, 2006, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 162-166<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>16849827<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/95365<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/index.htm<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/24\/11RITTWEGER.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/index.htm","http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/24\/11RITTWEGER.pdf"],"year":2010,"topics":["Sport","Osteopenia","Aging","Material Fatigue","Bone"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
