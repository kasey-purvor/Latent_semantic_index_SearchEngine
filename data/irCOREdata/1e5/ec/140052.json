This\ngap needs to be addressed, as key account plans have their own unique complexities.\nMoreover, the importance of key account plans is increasing. There is a need for a more\nwidespread understanding of the benefits of key account planning, encompassing both\nprocesses and outputs. Based on a four-phase research project in 78 international\ncompanies, this paper describes current best practice in key account planning. The\nresearch demonstrates the benefits of key account planning and sets out a framework for\nimplementing key account planning as a business process. The paper goes on to describe\nthe contents of a key account plan and to note some common defects found in such plans.\nKEYWORDS: Marketing planning; key account planning; key account management\n2INTRODUCTION\nPoor marketing is recognised as contributing to poor business performance, yet marketing\nissues are receiving insufficient attention in the boardroom (McGovern at al., 2004). One area\nthat is attracting senior management attention, however, is the emergence of bigger, more\npowerful and more sophisticated customers whose demands on their suppliers may \u2018negotiate\naway\u2019 benefits from such relationships if the suppliers do not take care (Kalwani and\nNarayandas, 1995; Woodburn and McDonald, 2001). This paper describes a research project\ninvestigating planning for key accounts. Key accounts are the most important few customers\nmanaged by organisations. Because of their relative size and complexity, it is widely accepted\nthat special issues come into play with respect to how they are managed. Curiously, given this\ncontext, the practice of key account planning has received almost no academic attention. Little\nis known about the ways in which companies plan their relationships with their key accounts.\nThis research aims to fill a considerable gap in the marketing literature.\nDefining a key account\nWhat is a key account? Many companies still conflate \u2018key customer\u2019 with \u2018large customer\u2019.\nAn alternative description has been provided by McDonald, Millman and Rogers: \u201cKey\naccounts are customers in a business to business market identified by selling companies as of\nstrategic importance.\u201d (McDonald, Millman and Rogers, 1996). They argue that strategic\nimportance should be objectively decided on the basis of a customer portfolio matrix\nconstructed from two perspectives: the attractiveness of the customer and the customer\u2019s\n3\nperception of the supplier\u2019s business strengths (Figure 1). The latter is important because the\ndegree to which a key account plan might succeed is dependent on the customer\u2019s buy-in as\nwell as that of the supplier.\nAttractiveness factors may include volume (which might be highly weighted in process\nmanufacturing because of scale economies), but will almost always also include customer\nprofitability, potential growth and their attitude to partnership. Woodburn and McDonald\n(2001) found that in best practice companies there were three types of attractiveness factors:\nthose that involve reward to the supplier (e.g. profitability), those that involve opportunity for\ndifferentiation (e.g. customer willingness to partner) and those that involve risk reduction (e.g.\nvolume in process manufacturing).\nThe mechanics of using this \u201ccustomer portfolio matrix\u201d, first described by Fiocca in 1982, to\nidentify key accounts are included in most popular books on key account management (e.g.\nMcDonald and Rogers, 1998).\n- Bring in Figure 1 here -\nHaving identified the few accounts that justify dedicated resources, planning for them is an\nobvious pre-requisite to the effective deployment of those resources. The position and role of\nkey account plans in the corporate planning hierarchy has been recognised for some time:\n\u201cStrategies for an account or territory can and should be identified\u201d (Else, 1973), and popular\nsales management books today emphasise it: \u201cWithout a plan, you are left with only a vague\nconcept of past tactics, a desire to do better, and an uneasiness about your ability to succeed.\u201d\n(Simpkins, 2004).\n4Research to date finds best practice companies developing long-term plans \u201cfor, and together\nwith, their individual key accounts\u201d (Woodburn and McDonald, 2001). Only with customer\ncollaboration can effective planning be achieved. For example, in the early 1990s, Nabisco\noperated top-down product distribution forecasts based on information from marketing (about\ncampaigns) and finance. When powerful retailers began demanding flexibility in Nabisco\u2019s\npromotional offering, and when the regular low pricing of some retail chains cut across\nNabisco offers, the system had to change. Account managers needed to start gathering\ninformation from customers about their goals and programs, and what they wanted and when.\nThis information, fed back through distribution into production, ensured better effectiveness\nof company resources (Barash and Mitchell, 1998).\nTHE ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE ON KEY ACCOUNT PLANNING\nKey account planning has its roots in strategic marketing planning and its proponents have\nrecommended a similar approach to these two different types of marketing planning\n(McDonald, Rogers and Woodburn, 2000). Strategic marketing planning should in turn relate\nto the corporate strategic plan; certainly, the failure to do so is one reason for implementation\nfailure (Simkin, 2002). The strategic planning process for an organisation has been described\nin many textbooks (e.g. Bowman 1990) and consists of goal-setting, gap analysis, strategic\nappraisal, strategy formulation and implementation. This linear model has been adapted for\nmarketing and is described in core textbooks such as Kotler (2003), and in detail in McDonald\n5\n(2003). Although this process involves an analysis of the market, practical application has all\ntoo often been hampered by organisational behaviour issues (Piercy and Morgan, 1990;\nMcDonald, Smith, and Rogers, 2001). There is a general problem that relatively few\ncompanies are adopting strategic marketing planning (Wilson, 2004), perhaps because the\nevidence that it improves business performance is somewhat equivocal (Phillips, Davies and\nMoutinho, 2001; Slotegraaf and Dickson, 2004).\nRecently, academics have worked to refine marketing planning. For example, Knox and\nMaklan (1998) describe \u201ccustomer value planning\u201d which requires focus on closing the gap\nbetween the customers\u2019 future needs and the current organisational competencies through\nexamining the core processes which deliver customer value. These processes involve\norganisational partnerships (internal and external). Process planning has also been advocated\nby Hamel and Prahalad (1994) and Hammer (1996). Process planning inevitably touches upon\nsupply chain and a case study of successful integrated supply chain planning is described in\nReeder and Rowell (2001). Customer value planning and process planning is certainly\nimportant in key account planning, where the plan starts with the customer\u2019s point of view and\nsuccess depends on the key account manager\u2019s ability to map company capabilities to the\ncustomer\u2019s needs and thereby to improve performance with their customers. (McDonald and\nRogers, 1998).\nMeanwhile in the 1990s, work on customer relationship management by, for example,\nChristopher, Payne and Ballantyne (1991), argued that relationships outside the organisation\ndepend on the quality of relationships within it, making the important point that strategic\nintent and shared internal values become part of the product\/services offered. Indeed, internal\nrelationships play a vital role in the planning process (Dibb, 2002). Participation in planning is\n6\na key indicator of its effectiveness (Phillips, Davies and Moutinho, 2001), although gaining\nbuy-in is difficult (Lane and Clewes, 2000). Gaining internal buy-in is critical in key account\nplanning, and it is common to hear key account managers say they do more selling internally\nthan in front of the customer.\nMore recently, another stream of research has indicated that there are both financial and non-\nfinancial benefits to strategic marketing planning (Conant and White, 1999). The non-\nfinancial benefits include a better understanding of customer needs and the identification of\nnew opportunities (Conant and White, 1999). Although some researchers have suggested that\nmore formal planning is associated with better performance (Claycomb, Germain and Dr\u00f6ge,\n2000), other researchers have emphasised the need to adopt a planning approach that is\nadaptable to the organisation culture and the business environment (Smith, 2003). It seems\nthat it is the process of planning, rather than the production of a plan per se, that is linked to\nperformance (Conant and White, 1999; Lane and Clewes, 2000; Stratis and Powers, 2001).\nPlanning and key account management\nDespite considerable emphasis on relationship management in the 1990s, as recently as 2002\nO\u2019Toole and Donaldson were noting that \u2018there has been a dearth of academic literature on\nrelationship marketing planning\u2019 (O\u2019Toole and Donaldson, 2002). They identify that\nmanagers have to decide whether to adopt a strategy of competing via collaboration, which\nrelationships to develop, how resources are to be allocated to relationships and how benefits\n7\nare to be delivered. They also identify that these decisions require a planning process,\npreferably one that involves partners (O\u2019Toole and Donaldson, 2002).\nThe customer portfolio matrix (CPM) originally described by Fiocca (1982) was identified as\nan important sales management tool for the selection of key accounts by McDonald, Millman\nand Rogers (1996). Key account planning requires significant investment in time in behalf of\nthe key account team, and therefore the principle and process of discerning the few accounts\nthat justify it is an important first step. In practice, using the CPM has often made companies\nre-think their perceptions of what constitutes a key account.\nEarlier, Millman and Wilson (1994) had proposed a six-stage Key Account Relational\nDevelopment model similar to that of Dwyer, Schurr and Oh (1987) that they used to analyse\nrelationships and which could provide a base for key account managers for planning the\ndevelopment of closer co-operation. This model was adapted and mapped to Maslow\u2019s\nhierarchy of needs by McDonald and Woodburn (1999). This \u201chierarchy of key relationships\u201d\ncan also be instrumental in determining how much planning an account justifies.\nThe process of key account planning itself seems to have been first described in McDonald\nand Rogers (1998). In addition to drawing from McDonald\u2019s expertise in traditional\nmarketing planning, the planning process advocated required extensive analysis from the\ncustomer\u2019s point of view, the only way to identify the added value that a supplier might\ninnovate to provide. Indeed, purchasing academics have noted a lack of customer\nunderstanding among suppliers (Carter and Ellram, 1994; Sharma, 2000).\n8\nAs well as providing a process adaptable to key account planning, the research on strategic\nmarketing planning suggests some important drivers and barriers to implementation. Drivers\ninclude: the use of teams; cross-functional implementation teams; an open management style;\nand a supportive environment (Lane and Clewes, 2000). As well as line manager hostility\n(Simkin, 2002), barriers include cognitive, procedural, resource, organisational, cultural and\ndata availability difficulties (Wilson, 2004). Finally, goal-setting is important for tasks where\npeople have control over their own performance (Locke, 2004), as is the case for key account\nmanagers.\nMETHODOLOGY\nFor almost 10 years, the Cranfield Key Account Management Research Club has researched\nthe practice of key account planning. This paper reports on this research and, for the first time,\nreports it in the public domain. The research programme to date has involved four separate\nphases, as shown in Table 1.\n- Bring in Table 1 -\nFor phases 1 and 3, all interviews were conducted on the selling or buying companies'\npremises and typically each lasted two hours. Each interview was designed to be issues based,\nso that key account management experience and its development could be described, and to\nenable distillation of best practice using key themes\/ keyword analysis. Phase 2 consisted of a\n9\nself-completion questionnaire administered to a mixed industry sample of buyers (48%) and\nsellers (52%).\nThroughout phases 1 to 3, participating companies were deliberately drawn from a variety of\nsectors across manufacturing and services in order to establish common themes that spanned\nthe variable nature of industry business cycle, supply chains or product\/service type. It should\nbe noted that some sectors do have specific challenges in key account planning, such as highly\nregulated business relationships in the finance sector.\nPhase 4 consisted of a self-completion survey with a complete Key Account Management\n(KAM) team of 25 managers who had previously submitted their KAM plans to the authors\nfor evaluation. The survey was distributed and endorsed by the key account managers\u2019 line\nmanagers but was returned in confidence to one of the authors for analysis. An anonymised\nsummary of the results from phase 4 was presented to this KAM team at their sales\nconference.\nSample Limitations\nAlthough the research programme on which we report in this paper is extensive, there are\nseveral limitations that should be taken into account. Firstly, all the key account managers and\nmost of the key account relationships reported here are primarily UK-based. There may be\nadditional issues relating, for example, to language, culture and complexity that affect global\naccount managers (Holt, 2003).\n10\nMoreover, our work is with companies who are interested in improving their KAM\nperformance. We note that companies\u2019 aspirations may differ from their actual practice; what\nthey report to a study of good practice may include aspirational elements.\nRESULTS\nThe results of this major study into KAM planning are reported under five main headings: the\nstructure of key account planning; the benefits of KAM planning; the planning process; the\ncontent of KAM plans; and some common defects of KAM plans.\nThe structure of key account planning\nMany key account plans were produced at a modest level, including just volume and financial\ntargets for one year. One research participant explained that this was because they operated in\na very dynamic industry, and long-term plans were soon obsolete (nevertheless, product plans\nwere drawn up for 3-5 years). Generally, the quality of plans owed a lot to the competence of\nindividual account managers, and companies reported difficulty in achieving consistency.\nThere was recognition that poor planning could entail a waste of resources:\n\u201cWe wasted resources. We should have had more processes in place at the beginning,\nmore structure from the outset, and more standardisation in the future.\u201d (Respondent,\nPhase 3).\n11\nMost companies in the study were working hard to raise planning standards, so that the focus\nshifted towards identifying how business with key accounts would be expanded. In other\nwords, they expected a strategic viewpoint. Where companies were highly reliant on business\nfrom a few strategic customers, their focus was on strategic alignment with the customer,\nrequired customer value analysis and process planning.\nEven among the developed strategic plans, considerable weaknesses were observed, and most\nwere internally oriented and not shared with the customer. Joint strategic plans, where\ncustomers were involved in plan development (and therefore plan commitment), were rare.\nOnly a few companies had achieved this degree of sophistication. Most customers responded\nvery positively to supplier-initiated joint planning, and some suppliers had gained\nconsiderable share of spend as a result:\n\u201cA supplier had worked with its customer to get closer to their strategic planning. The\nselling company now contributed to improvement of the customer\u2019s whole process,\nand had progressed from being an \u2018over-the-fence\u2019 supplier of products, to complete\nfacility and category management. The value of the business had grown by five times\nfrom the original contract.\u201d (Respondent, Phase 3)\nIronically, whilst customers were critical of suppliers who did not involve them in planning,\nthey tended to wait for the supplier to make the invitation. Best practice companies were clear\nabout which key accounts they were going to focus their resources on, had clear planning\nprocesses, and proactively involved their customers in the planning process. As one key\naccount manager commented:\n12\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to ensure that the client sees the benefit to them of our KAM approach,\nso we need to write plans with the client wherever possible\u201d\n(Respondent, Phase 4)\nThe benefits of key account planning\nA majority of companies believed that strategic plans for individual key accounts were\nbeneficial. The earliest benefit was that the key account manager and the company overall\ngained a better understanding of the customer, thus meeting the customer\u2019s need for a pro-\nactive approach. Respondents commented that they thought they knew a lot about their key\naccounts until they started the information-gathering necessary for a strategic plan. It was\nclear thereafter that their knowledge had been superficial.\nThe new insight into the customer led logically to new thinking about how to do business with\nthem. At the very least, the need for new contacts was identified. At best, new comprehensive\nsolutions to help customers meet their strategic objectives could be explored. This is\nattractive to customers; purchasing decision-makers are impressed with suppliers who are easy\nto do business with. Some of them applied great emphasis to this as a \u2018feelgood\u2019 factor.\nWhere suppliers had thought strategically about solving customer \u2018hassle\u2019 in using their\nproduct, they were rewarded with a higher share of spend. This finding is consistent with the\nprocess focus recommended by Knox and Maklan (1998).\nCustomer involvement is undoubtedly a benefit as it usually leads to customer commitment to\nthe supplier plan, reducing risk and enabling follow-through planning to other functions to\n13\nensure efficient application of resources. Although some customers were reluctant to\ncontribute to supplier strategic planning, most welcomed being involved at an early stage.\nMost suppliers were nervous about that, although there is evidence of the cost-effectiveness of\nsupplier-customer co-operation, e.g. in supply chain integration (Corbett and Blackburn,\n1999).\nBoth suppliers and customers regarded having a strategy for a key account as preferable to no\nstrategy. Customers were critical of suppliers who were \u201cloose cannons\u2026.charging off in\ndifferent directions\u201d. Suppliers realised that good strategy based on good analysis led to \u201ca\nconsistent rationale for activity\u201d which fed into other plans within the organisation in an\neffective way.\nIntangible benefits within the supplier organisation included the value of organisational\nlearning about the customer and the value of the company\u2019s capabilities. This was true\nparticularly where cross-functional teams were involved in planning.\nThe individual learning acquired by the key account manager was also important. Typically,\nthe key account managers who participated in Phase 4 commented on the development of\ndeep customer understanding as a key benefit of KAM planning:\n\u201cCan be very time-consuming, but can see the benefit it gives in understanding the\nclient in more detail\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt has changed the way I look at my key clients, giving me a focus of where I was,\nwhere I currently stand and where I aim to be in 6 months to 2 years\u201d\n14\n\u201cThe greatest benefit was to put yourself in the customer\u2019s position\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe process required me to investigate and understand the client to a much greater\ndepth than I would have previously\u201d\n(4 Respondents, Phase 4)\nThe benefits to KAM planning went beyond the financial, and included:\n\uf0b7 Better customer understanding\n\uf0b7 New thinking\n\uf0b7 Customer involvement and buy-in\n\uf0b7 Sharing of information\n\uf0b7 Formulation of strategy\n\uf0b7 Guidance for implementation\n\uf0b7 Learning\n\uf0b7 Better management overview \/ customer portfolio management\nKAM Plans provided the basis for much better management insight in decision-making, and\nvisibility throughout the company of expectations concerning key account activity.\n15\nImplementing key account planning\nMost participants reported challenges in setting up key account planning. Firstly, whilst it\nwas possible to identify the resources needed to complete plans, it was less easy to get time\ncommitment from relevant contributors, as attitudes to planning could be negative. Key\naccount managers noted that it always took more time than expected to get important\ninformation from customers. It was also difficult to get appropriate training for key account\nmanagers. Integrating the key account planning process with the overall corporate planning\nprocess was also problematic:\n\u201cThe Operations department has a huge impact on our relationship with a client, and\nthis is an area that we have very little control over\u201d\n(Respondent, Phase 4)\nThe importance of frameworks for planning such as templates and consultations, including a\npost-plan communication process, were often overlooked.\nIn relation to marketing planning, McDonald, Smith and Rogers (2001) note eight major\nbarriers to success, some of which are also evident at the key account planning level. If the\nkey account manager is insufficiently skilled, sales managers will be reviewing poor plans.\nPoor plans are likely to be characterised by unspecific objectives, lack of in-depth analysis,\nand confusion about strategy, tactics, actions and process. If the approach to planning is not\n16\nsystematic, integration will be difficult. Moreover, if the corporate culture is not sympathetic\nto planning and customer focus, the planning effort will be wasted (Piercy and Morgan, 1990).\nBest practice companies anticipate and address these obstacles as key account management is\nimplemented and enhanced.\nBased on our considerable body of research, we can generalize that there is an eight-stage\nprocess used by good practice companies when they implement KAM planning:\n1. Identify the KAM team\n2. Train on analysis, objective and strategy setting, writing plans\n3. Brief on the planning process\n4. Brief on the analytical process\n5. Identify responsibility for production of plan document (usually key account manager)\n6. Agree customer involvement\n7. Communicate on planning process\n8. Communicate on output (plan, and results from the plan)\nTHE CONTENTS OF A KEY ACCOUNT PLAN\nOur research has found that good key account plans tend to follow a logical structure, as\nshown in Table 2:\n- Bring in Table 2 here -\n17\nClearly, this structure has much in common with that of strategic marketing plans as described\nby McDonald (2003) and Piercy (2001), with the key difference that KAM plans are largely\ndrawn up from the point of view of the customer.\nKAM Plans should contain an introduction that sets out the supplier\u2019s objectives folr the\nrelationship and summarises why the customer will respond in a way that makes the\nobjective\/s credible. Then, the second major section is a review of the key account\u2019s business\nenvironment. Tools such as the PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) analysis\nand Porter\u2019s (2004) Five Forces of Competition are used to determine the business\nenvironment and competitive pressures on the customer. By discussing with key decision-\nmakers what the customer\u2019s shareholders and customers are demanding, the key account\nmanager will learn a lot about their interests and attitudes, and about the customer\u2019s culture.\nUsing information provided by the customer or deduced from their annual review and media\ncoverage, Porter\u2019s internal value chain can be used to determine the customer\u2019s strengths and\nweaknesses.\nTo summarise this review of the customer\u2019s business situation, the KAM team has to produce\nan actionable SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for the\ncustomer, and determine what strategies the customer needs to implement in the next 3-5\nyears. If the customer has not already been involved in the process, it is important to try to\ncheck these assumptions with them.\nThe third section of the plan analyses the customer\u2019s issues to identify priority opportunities\nand threats for the supplier. This can be done using a matrix borrowed from information\nsystems (Ward and Peppard, 2002). The applications portfolio matrix is used to identify\n18\nopportunities for the supplier\u2019s resources to be applied to the customers\u2019 needs. For example,\na raw materials supplier offered to manage the stocks of their product in the customer\u2019s\npremises and to be responsible for ensuring a consistent quality was always available to the\nmanufacturing plant; the customer quickly agreed a single sourcing deal (McDonald, Millman\nand Rogers, 1996).\nSurveying a team of 25 account managers after they had been through an extensive planning\ntraining and feedback process revealed that they found the strategies, action plans, objective\nsetting, customer management strategies, and contact mapping to be the most useful parts of\nthe plan (sections 4 to 6). Interestingly, the most difficult task for the key account managers\nwas to evaluate the attractiveness of the customer to their firm and to place them on the\ncustomer portfolio matrix (section 3):\n\u201cMy major concern is about \u2018value of customer\u2019\u2026 I have little or no idea as to the\ncustomer attractiveness or monetary value to [name of bank]\u201d\n(Respondent, Phase 4)\nSome common defects in key account plans\nTo try to identify best practice in KAM planning, phase 3 concentrated on companies who had\nbeen practising key account management for some years. An interesting finding confirmed by\nphase 3 was that, even if the planning process was well-established and rigorous, defects\ncould still found in key account plans. Some of the major defects identified in key account\n19\nplans included weak data, confusion between strategies and action plans, and no contingency\nor risk planning.\nAcross the four phases, some common defects were identified. Where key account managers\nhad relied on only internal data, or numerical data, without checking with the customer, the\nplan was on weak foundations. These characteristics were usually found alongside little or no\nanalysis. Even with good analysis, confusion between strategy and action was common.\nStrategies were also confused with outcomes and the plan was confused with a budget.\nStrategies might appear only as possibilities, or without inputs and outputs. They might not be\nprioritised, or assessed for risk. Questions may be raised which were not answered, or options\npresented with no preferred choice. Some plans seemed to consist of distilled optimism in\nwhich all strategies succeeded and all accounts grew.\nRisk management within account planning has traditionally been considered alongside\nimplementation, but arguably deserves much earlier focus. Given the over-optimism that\nseems to be inherent in many plans, contingency plans needed to be developed to address\nidentified weaknesses and threats.\nDISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS\nOur research suggests that key account managers often have to assume new and complex roles\nsuch as phase management and \/ or people management, or to manage across borders. Corner\nand Rogers (2005) described the behaviour issues common among employees and managers\n20\nwhen CRM is being implemented, and many of these issues are common to the\nimplementation of KAM. Some companies have invested heavily in consultation and training\nin order to achieve the culture change necessary to support new strategic directions. Some of\nthat training should be dedicated to the key account manager\u2019s role as leader of the key\naccount team. Rogers (1999) and Gregory and Rogers (2004) have identified the qualities\nneeded in leaders of sales teams, including coaching, thinking and analysis skills, thorough\nadministration and standard-bearing as well as communication skills including listening.\nOur survey of key account managers after training in KAM planning and after they had\nreceived feedback on their KAM plans indicated that confidence in their ability to plan had\nimproved. Prior to training, several key account managers identified themselves as having no\nplanning skills and none said that they were highly skilled. After training and feedback, no\nkey account managers said they had no skills and several said they felt highly skilled. This\nincrease in confidence was a benefit of training in KAM planning.\nThere were also issues around implementation. Because the key account manager may not\nhave authority across functional, business unit and geographical boundaries, automatic\nimplementation following approval should not be assumed. Effective implementation\nrequired constant, consistent reinforcement, which was not easy in large organisations.\nMoreover, the integration of key account plans with functional plans was vital, together with a\ncommunications plan and frequent reviews to emphasise the validity of the process.\nCustomers expected the key account manager to deliver on promises made in a key account\nplan, but it was also quite apparent to them when their key account manager had been given\naccountability without responsibility. If the customer perceived that another part of the\norganisation was failing to respond, they may blame senior managers for the difficulty.\n21\nAnother general implication for managers was the importance of measurement and review.\nOne measure that should be constantly \u201ctop of mind\u201d with key account managers is customer\nlifetime value. The profit that a customer produces for the firm is simply the sum of the\nmargins of all the products purchased over time, less the costs of servicing the customer over\ntime (Kellen, 2002). Suppliers with a better understanding of the causes of customer revenues,\ncosts and profit over time are better equipped to manage a relationship profitably.\nFinally, several key account managers commented on the tensions they experienced between\nthe need to think and plan strategically for key account relationships and the short-term\npressure for results that their companies placed on them. One key account manager expressed\nthe frustrations of many about this issue as follows:\n\u201cSenior management can send us on as many courses as they like but, until they make\nit [the KAM plan] the cornerstone of our work and not a short-term numbers-driven\nenvironment, it will remain a useful check list but not an everyday way of doing\nbusiness\u201d\n(Respondent, Phase 4)\nIt is not that key account planning does not allow for the realisation of short-term benefits, but\nthe principle of planning is to ensure that short-term benefits are realised within a strategic\nframework and are not detrimental to long-term gain. Empirical evidence suggests that a\ncompany\u2019s share price is based on long-term factors rather than last quarter\u2019s results (Dobbs,\nLeslie and Mendonca, 2005). Senior managers must manage the balance between short-term\nand long-term constructively if they are to avoid cynicism from key account managers and\n22\nkey accounts. Moreover, senior managers should give very clear messages about the\nimportance of account planning, including failing to approve poor KAM plans.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough companies are likely to apply high-level skills and considerable time to product\ndevelopment planning and phase planning, key account planning has not received much\nstrategic focus. It has its unique characteristics as a process, especially the need for a\ncustomer view, preferably with customer involvement. The granularity of a strategic plan for\nan individual key account is necessary if that customer is truly strategic to the supplier. It is\nalso necessary because the activity has to be integrated into other internal plans, customer\nplans and sometimes into a complete supply chain plan. It also means that there can be\nflexibility to avoid over-bureaucratic planning; for example, a regular predictable key account\nmay need less effort to plan for, than a key account that is growing rapidly.\nKey account planning has been found to deliver benefits to suppliers. High quality key\naccount plans impress purchasing decision-makers, and the presence of defined strategies for\nkey account management in itself contributes to resource efficiency.\n23\nREFERENCES\nBarash, M. and Mitchell, D.
