Significant progress has been made\nin understanding the mechanisms that underlie pat-\nterning, and in determining the dependence of the fi-\nnal pattern on model parameters, initial and bound-\nary conditions, and domain size and growth (see for\nexample [18,7]). One class of model that has been\nstudied in detail is based on the Turing instability in\nreaction\u2013diffusion systems [30]. Turing demonstrated\nthat a system of two or more mutually interacting dif-\nfusible chemicals (termed morphogens) can undergo\nspontaneous spatial patterning within a specific region\nof parameter space (the Turing space).

Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115\npatterns have since been produced experimentally in\nchemical systems (reviewed, for example, in [9,18] and\narticles in [16]).\nTypically, the analysis of pattern-forming models\nis carried out assuming that both the initial conditions\nand model parameters are homogeneous in space. In\nthe case of reaction\u2013diffusion models, this yields, in\nprinciple, a complete characterisation of the Turing\nspace (see, for example [21,22]). In reality, however,\npattern-forming mechanisms often operate in spatially\nheterogeneous environments. In such cases it becomes\ncritical to understand the effects of the imposed spatial\nheterogeneity on the ability of the mechanism to gen-\nerate pattern, and on the form of the resulting pattern.\nOne specific instance in which spatial heterogeneity\nis significant is in the emergence of pattern during em-\nbryonic development, or morphogenesis [13]. Specifi-\ncally, development proceeds in a hierarchical fashion,\nwith pattern being laid down in progressively finer de-\ntail as the embryo ages and grows. At each stage of\nthis process, the biological patterning mechanisms op-\nerate within a cellular environment that already bears\nthe imprint of earlier patterning events. This may be\nmanifested in differences both in the internal state of\ncells, and in the environment external to the cells (for\nexample, the extracellular matrix). Given that cellular\nand extracellular conditions can modulate the param-\neters and initial conditions of patterning mechanisms,\nit seems clear that the possibility of spatially inhomo-\ngeneous parameters should be considered in models of\ns\nt\nd\na\nM\ns\nc\nt\nW\nt\nI\nf\ns\nw\ni\nm\nm\npatterns, or in novel propagating patterns. Finally, we\nextend our study to a two-dimensional model to illus-\ntrate the wealth and complexity of patterns that can be\ngenerated with a spatially varying parameter and dis-\ncuss possible applications in biology. Patterning in two\ndimensions is of great significance during embryonic\ndevelopment, since many pattern-forming events (such\nas the specification of neurons in the fly neuroectoderm\n[6]) take place in epithelial sheets which have an (ap-\nproximately) two-dimensional structure.\n2. The dependence of spatial patterns on model\nparameters\nAs a first step towards understanding the effects of\nspatial inhomogeneity in model parameters, we need\nto assess how each model parameter affects the form\nof the final steady state pattern. For concreteness, we\nfocus on the two-component activator-inhibitor system\nof reaction\u2013diffusion equations introduced by Gierer\nand Meinhardt [12]. In a non-dimensional form [26],\nthe model equations are\nut = r\n(\n1+ u\n2\nv\n)\n\u2212 \u00b5u+Du\u22072u,\nvt = ru2 \u2212 \u03bdv+Dv\u22072v, (1)\nwhere u(x, t) and v(x, t) denote, respectively, the acti-\nvator and inhibitor concentrations at spatial position x\na\nT\nm\nfl\ns\ne\nc\n[\np\ns\ns\nd\ns\na\na\ns\nsuch mechanisms.\nIn this paper, we investigate the effect of spa-\nially varying parameters in a two-component reaction\u2013\niffusion system. We study the well-characterised\nctivator-inhibitor model introduced by Gierer and\neinhardt [12]. In a previous paper [26], we demon-\ntrated that spatially varying parameters in this model\nan lead to patterning outside of the Turing space and\nhat the patterns generated can be spatially restricted.\ne now explore further the patterning capabilities of\nhis model system with spatially varying parameters.\nn particular, we determine how the variation of dif-\nerent parameters in the model equations affects the\nteady state patterns formed. Using the insight gained,\ne determine the effects on pattern formation of vary-\nng the spatial wavelengths of \u201cpre-patterns\u201d in the\nodel parameters. We show that spatial variation in\nodel parameters can result either in complex stablend time t. r, \u00b5, \u03bd,Du and Dv are positive parameters.\nhese equations are solved on a specified spatial do-\nain with given boundary conditions (we assume zero\nux). When the model parameters are within the Turing\npace, stable spatially patterned steady state solutions\nxist for u and v, in which localised peaks of activator\noncentration are separated by a characteristic spacing\n12].\nIn general, it is difficult to determine the effect on\natterning of each model parameter analytically. From\ntandard linear theory we know that the activator diffu-\nion coefficient Du must be smaller than the inhibitor\niffusion coefficientDv for diffusion-driven instability,\no we assume thatDu is very much smaller than theDv\nnd set Du = \t2 \u00d7Dv, where \t is a small parameter,\nnd we seek a solution of (1) for u and v in terms of a\neries expansion in \t. However it is not possible to con-\ntruct a regular series expansion which satisfies the dif-\nK.M.

We\nthus consider an \u201couter expansion\u201d which is regular and\nsatisfies the equations in most of the domain together\nwith \u201cinner expansions\u201d which match with the outer so-\nlution and satisfy the equations in small boundary layer\nregions of the domain. In these regions the coefficients\nof the series solution are given in terms of a rescaled\nspatial coordinate. This matched asymptotic analysis,\nwhich is described for a one-dimensional system in\nAppendix A, shows that when d \u2261 Du\/Dv is O(\t2), the\nwidth of the activator peaks is proportional to the dif-\nfusion wavelength of the activator \u03bbu \u2261\n\u221a\nDu\/\u00b5. The\nlength-scale of the inhibitor pattern (which gives us an\nidea of the spacing of the activator peaks) is of order\nthe diffusion wavelength of the inhibitor \u03bbv \u2261\n\u221a\nDv\/\u03bd.\nThe heights of the activator peaks are proportional to\n\u03be = \u221aDv\u03bd\/Du\u00b5.\nFig. 1 shows the results of simulations of the Gierer\u2013\nMeinhardt model equations in one spatial dimension.\nFig. 1(a) shows the steady state activator profiles in two\nF\n0\n\u00b5\n(\nl\nsig. 1.

As expected, quadrupling the value of \u00b5\nroughly halves the height and width of the peaks and\ndoes not change their separation. In Fig. 1(b), two dif-\nferent values of d or equivalently Du were used. Qua-\ndrupling Du roughly doubles the width and halves the\nheight of the peaks. In Fig. 1(c) two values of r were\nused. The steady state activator profiles are almost iden-\ntical (but the height of the inhibitor profile changes\nroughly in direct proportion to r). In Fig. 1(d) two val-\nues of \u03bd were used. We see that quadrupling \u03bd approx-\nimately doubles the height and halves the separation\nof the activator peaks, but has no discernible effect on\ntheir width. These simulation results all agree with the\nanalytical expressions we have found for the widths,\nheights and separations of the peaks.\nIn summary, the separation of the peaks is unaffected\nby the values of \u00b5, r and d and is proportional to \u03bbv.\nThe width of the activator peaks is independent of the\nvalues of \u03bd, r and Dv and proportional to \u03bbu and the\nheight of the peaks is independent of r and proportional\nto \u03be = \u221aDv\u03bd\/Du\u00b5.\nThe matched asymptotic analysis suggests that a\ncomplex pattern of peaks of varying heights, widths or\nseparations could be produced in a reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystem in which one of the parameters was controlled\nby another chemical species which was itself patterned,\nfor example by a different reaction\u2013diffusion mecha-\nnism. The form of the resulting complex pattern would\nd\nt\n3\nd\n3\ne\np\np\na\na\n1\nw\nu\n5.0. We modulate each of these parameters, one at a\ntime, by a factor (1.0+ 0.5\u00d7 cos \u03c0x), so that the pa-\nrameter decreases monotonically across the domain.\nFig. 2 shows the effect of variation of each parame-\nter. In Fig. 2(a), d is varied and, as expected, the steady\nstate pattern has activator peaks which are wider and\nlower at high d. There is no detectable change in the\nspacing of the peaks. In Fig. 2(b), \u03bd is varied and, again\nas expected, the spacing of the peaks decreases and their\nheight increases as \u03bd is increased, while the width of the\npeaks is approximately independent of \u03bd. When either\n\u00b5 or r is varied, as in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively, a\nsteady state pattern is not formed but rather a travelling\nwave of peaks is obtained. New peaks emerge at large\n\u00b5 (or small r) and disappear at small\u00b5 (or large r). The\nnew peaks are created just inside the boundary (see for\nexample the nascent peak on the right of Fig. 2(d)) and\nare annihilated just inside the opposite boundary. The\npatterns at t = 1000 are shown in the figures. The vari-\nation in forms of the peaks is not quite as expected for a\nsteady state pattern. The widths are approximately in-\ndependent of r, and the width and heights of the peaks\ndecrease with\u00b5, as expected. However, in addition, the\nheights of the peaks decrease with r and the peak sep-\narations vary with both \u00b5 and r. These features are not\nsuggested by the perturbation analysis for the steady\nstate solutions. A full understanding of these phenom-\nena would require more detailed analysis.\nIntuitively, the reason for the travelling peaks in the\nsystems with gradients in \u00b5 or r seems to be that the\nl\ni\nb\ns\nw\nd\nw\nl\nt\ne\nf\no\nt\nd\np\nc\nd\naepend on which parameter was modulated by the con-\nrol species.\n. Spatially varying parameters in one\nimension\n.1. Monotonically varying parameters\nNow that we have some insight into the effects that\nach of the parameters has on the final steady state\nattern, we look at the patterns produced when these\narameters are varied across the domain. We consider\none-dimensional form of the model system (1) and\nllow a single parameter to vary across the domain [0,\n] in such a way that the parameters are everywhere\nithin the Turing space. We use base parameter val-\nes Dv = 0.027, d = 0.01, \u03bd = 20.0, \u00b5 = 10.0, r =evel of the activator in the troughs of the pattern, which\ns given to leading order in our perturbation expansions\ny r\/\u00b5, varies across the domain. This leads to diffu-\nion of the activator across the trough from the side on\nhich it is higher to the side on which it is lower (i.e.\nown a gradient in r, or up a gradient in\u00b5). Thus peaks\nould be receiving activator on their upper sides and\nosing activator on their lower sides and hence move up\nhe gradient in trough activator level. Clearly, the same\nffect would not occur for variations in \u03bd and in the dif-\nusion coefficients. We are not aware that this method\nf obtaining moving peaks has been demonstrated in\nhe literature. Kramer et al. [17], do postulate that a\nynamic pattern would result in a system in which a\narameter varied from within the Turing space at the\nentre of the domain to outside the Turing space in a\nifferent manner at each end. In addition, Voroney et\nl. [31], show the occurrence of travelling waves in a\nK.M. Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115 99\nFig. 2. Late time activator profiles in simulations of the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model equations in which a parameter varies across the domain. The\nvalues of the base parameters areDv = 0.027, \u03bd = 20.0, \u00b5 = 10.0, r = 5.0 and d = 0.01. These base parameter values give rise to a pattern with\nmany peaks, so that we can easily see how varying a parameter across the domain modulates the pattern. The mode with the largest linear growth\nrate is the 18\u03c0 mode. The peaks are also fairly smooth, which makes accurate numerical simulation easier: (a) d = 0.01(1.0+ 0.5 cos \u03c0x);\n(b) \u03bd = 20.0(1.0+ 0.5 cos \u03c0x); (c) \u00b5 = 10.0(1.0+ 0.5 cos \u03c0x); (d) r = 5.0(1.0+ 0.5 cos \u03c0x).

In\ncontrast, in our simulations the parameters are within\nthe Turing space at all points in the domain and hence\nif the parameter was constant at any of these values,\nthe system would give rise to a stable spatial pattern.\nTo explore these moving peaks further, we con-\nsider matched asymptotic solutions for the full\nGierer\u2013Meinhardt model with the time derivative (see\nAppendix B). We find that we can transform the bound-\nary layer equation for u (which to leading order is u\u00af0\/\t)\nto obtain Fisher\u2019s equation (see Appendix B):\nwt\u2032 = w(1\u2212 w)+ wX\u2032X\u2032 , (2)\nwhere t\u2032 = \u00b5t,X\u2032 = \u221a\u00b5\/DvX and w =\n1\u2212 3u\u00af0\/2upeak = 1\u2212 ru\u00af0\/\u00b5\tv\u2217.

It appears, however, that\nthe pattern is pinned in place because the peaks are\nconfined to the boundary layer (and must not disappear\nentirely) and the positions of the boundary layers are\nfixed by the symmetry of the equations. If we consider\nthe system with, for example, \u00b5 = \u00b5(x), then the\ntransformation w = 1\u2212 ru\u00af0\/\u00b5\tv\u2217 yields extra terms\ndue to the spatial derivatives of \u00b5. These, however,\nare not present in the leading order equations, since\nthe variation in \u00b5 takes place on a spatial scale of\nO(1) and thus is negligible across the boundary layer.\nThus the differential equations for the leading order\nboundary expansions are the same as for the case\nwith constant parameters. The lack of symmetry (in\nthe matching conditions, albeit not to leading order)\nseems to allow the boundary layer to move. Intuitively\nit may be explained thus: the \u201cpressure\u201d for the lower\nu-state to invade is greater on the side of the peak\non which the outer solution in u takes smaller value\nand hence (in order to preserve the required thickness\nof the boundary layer) the peaks move down the\ngradient in \u00b5 (the outer solution value of u is r\/\u00b5 to\nleading order). This analysis is merely suggestive; to\nunderstand fully the phenomenon of moving peaks\nand the significance of Fisher\u2019s equation for u in the\nboundary layer would require further analysis.\n3.2. Spatially periodic parameters\nThe above simulations demonstrate that two-species\nr\nr\nt\np\nt\nr\nW\nc\nr\nw\ns\n[\nt\nw\np\no\nM\nthat could be described well by this type of formal-\nism, we consider pattern formation during embryonic\ndevelopment. The patterning of the embryo is natu-\nrally hierarchical and most patterning events are likely\nto take place in a heterogeneous environment. As we\nhave shown, heterogeneity in parameters of a reaction\u2013\ndiffusion system extends the range and type of patterns\nthat can be produced. There is good experimental evi-\ndence that the mobility of chemical species involved in\nembryonic patterning can be modulated by the concen-\ntration of others. For example, retinoic acid, which is\ngraded along the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the develop-\ning chick limb bud, modulates the permeability of gap\njunctions between cells and hence the effective diffu-\nsion coefficients of morphogens which move through\nthe gap junctions [2,5]. There is also evidence that ele-\nments of the extracellular matrix (ECM) modulate the\ndiffusion of growth factors such as activin [29], which\nare prime candidates for embryonic morphogens [25].\nThus spatial inhomogeneity in the structure of the ECM\ncould lead to spatially varying diffusion coefficients.\nOther studies have shown how the stability of mor-\nphogens is modulated spatially by specific receptors\nexpressed on the surface of cells (see, for example [3]).\nTo explore the influence of prior patterning events,\nwe investigate now the effect of the wavelength of a pe-\nriodic pre-pattern in the activator diffusion coefficient\nin the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model system. We use param-\neter values \u03bd = 20.0, \u00b5 = 10.0, r = 10.0,Dv = 0.027\nand d = 0.01(1.0+ 0.5 cos n\u03c0x), where n is an inte-\ng\nr\np\ns\np\nf\nt\n\u201c\ns\ni\nF\nF\nv\no\nr\no\nseaction\u2013diffusion systems with spatially varying pa-\nameters can lead to complex steady state patterns and\nravelling waves of peaks.

To give a specific example of the type of process\n1 Although, in most cases, simulations of reaction\u2013diffusion sys-\nems with constant parameters result in patterns of identical peaks,\ne note the interesting work of Doelman et al.

When n = 0 (i.e. when the pa-\nameters of the system are spatially homogeneous) the\nattern formed has approximately 23\/2 peaks, equally\npaced and of equal heights (the exact pattern de-\nends on the initial conditions). We look at the ef-\nect on the pattern when n\u000b 23, when n is a few\nimes smaller than 23 and when n > 23.

Spatially varying parameters in two\ndimensions\nIt is clear from the simulations in the previous sec-\ntion that a spatially varying parameter can enhance the\ncomplexity of patterns formed in a reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystem. We now explore the types of patterns that may\nbe produced with spatially varying parameters on a\ntwo-dimensional domain. Such systems could be in-\nvolved in the patterning of embryonic epithelia, for ex-\nample in the patterning of animal coats and fish skins,\nwhich are often characterised by complex spatial pat-\nterns. In particular, the profile of Fig. 3(c) suggests that\nit may be possible to obtain patterns of alternating large\nand small spots resembling the scale patterns on the\nhead of the lizard Cyrtodactylus fedtschenkoi (see Fig.\n5(a)) or alternating wide and narrow stripes resembling\nthose on the tail of the Gila monster (see Fig. 5(b)).\nIf we assume that cells differentiate where the ac-\ntivator concentration exceeds a certain threshold then\nthe size of the differentiated region is controlled by\nthe width of the activator peak. We have seen that this\nwidth is controlled by the diffusion and decay rates of\nthe activator. Increasing the diffusion rate reduces the\nheight of the peaks as it increases their width, imply-\ning that only for low thresholds of cell response will\nthe wide, short peaks lead to larger patches of cell dif-\nferentiation. Decreasing the parameter \u00b5 (the decay\nrate of the activator) increases both the height and the\nwidth of the peaks, so that any threshold of response\nbelow the height of the smaller peaks should lead to\na mixed pattern of large and small patches of differ-\nentiation of significantly different sizes. Thus, in an\nattempt to obtain a pattern of differently sized peaks\nwe vary \u00b5 across the domain. Fig. 6(a) shows a sim-\nulation of the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model equations (1)\nwith constant parameters on the two-dimensional do-\nmain [0, 2]\u00d7 [0, 2].2 The parameter values are given\nin the legend. In Fig. 6(b) and (c), the details of the sim-\nulation are the same except that\u00b5 is varied sinusoidally\nin space (see legend for details). For each simulation\nwe show (i) a greyscale plot which shows what the dif-\nferentiated cell pattern might look like and (ii) a mesh\nplot which shows the form of the peaks. We see indeed\nthat the largest peaks form at the minima of \u00b5 and that\nsmaller peaks occur between these at medium values\nof \u00b5.\nWe find that it is possible to obtain a regular pattern\nof large and small spots (cf. Fig. 5(a)) and we postulate\nthat, in a reaction\u2013diffusion system that normally gives\nrise to a pattern of stripes (e.g. one with cubic auto-\ncatalysis) a spatially varying parameter could give rise\nto a pattern of thick and thin stripes, like the pattern on\nthe skin of the lionfish (see Fig. 5c)).\n2 All two-dimensional simulations were performed using an alter-\nnating direction implicit (ADI) method [28]. Central finite differ-\nences were used for the spatial discretization.\n106 K.M. Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115\nThe pattern shown in Fig. 6(c) shows clusters of\npeaks, consisting of a larger peak surrounded by sev-\neral smaller ones. This is similar to the pattern of hair\nfollicles formed in many mammalian species. Nagor-\ncka [23,24] discusses the initiation of wool follicles in\nsheep and proposes a complex model, in which the for-\nmation of the first follicles modulates the domain and\ndiffusion coefficients of a reaction\u2013diffusion system.\nOur results suggest that a two-stage reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystem, in which a species involved in the first pattern-\ning step modulates a parameter of the second patterning\nsystem, could provide an alternative explanation for the\ninitiation of follicle clusters.\nFor comparison with Fig. 6, Fig. 7 shows a greyscale\nplot of the steady state activator concentration in a sim-\nulation in which \u03bd (the decay rate of the inhibitor) was\nvaried sinusoidally with the same wavelength of vari-\nation as in Fig. 6(b). We see here that the width of the\nactivator peaks is roughly constant throughout the do-\nmain, although the spacing is nonuniform. As in Fig.\n6, the peaks are located on a diagonal array.\n5. Complex pattern formation on patchy\ndomains\nThe sinusoidally varying parameters studied in the\nprevious sections would be relevant in a system in\nwhich, for example, the activator was degraded by an-\nother chemical whose concentration was already spa-\nt\nA\nr\nd\nfi\ns\nt\nt\na\nh\no\nt\ni\nc\ni\na\nt\ncan exert an influence on the form of the pattern and\ncan lead, for example, to the production of stripes in a\nsystem where spots are normally produced. This sug-\ngests that the differences in fish skin patterns between\nspecies, for example, might not involve different chem-\nical kinetics, but could arise through different parame-\nter variation on the skin of the different species. We also\nshow that a mixture of stripes and spots can be formed\n(as on the skin of the 13-lined squirrel, for example,\nsee Fig. 5(d)) and that other patterns such as target pat-\nterns can be produced (as in the juvenile Pomacanthus\nimperator, see Fig. 10(a)).\nFig. 8, shows the late time3 activator profile in\nsimulations of the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model (1) with\nparameters as given in the legend on the domain\n[0, 2]\u00d7 [0, 2], with zero flux boundary conditions. In\n(a), \u00b5 is constant and the parameters are within the\nTuring space, in (b), \u00b5 takes a stepfunction form with\nthe same value as (a) in the upper half of the domain.\nThe value in the lower half of the domain is outside\nthe Turing space. If \u00b5 = 2.0 across the whole domain,\nthen the parameters are outside the Turing space and\nthe activator concentration converges everywhere to its\nhomogeneous steady state value (the critical value of\n\u00b5 is 2.04). We see from the figure that when \u00b5 = 2.5\neverywhere, a pattern of spots is produced. The pres-\nence of a patch of \u00b5 = 2.0, with a straight boundary,\nhowever, causes stripes to be produced instead in the\nregion where \u00b5 = 2.5. The stripes also form in the re-\ngion where \u00b5 = 2.0, although their amplitude decays\na\nh\nt\na\nb\ns\nb\np\n(\ns\nT\nt\ns\ni\nbially varying due to a previous patterning process.\nnother potential source of inhomogeneities in the\neaction\u2013diffusion system is that due to the pattern of\nifferentiation of cells already present in the embryonic\neld. The states of differentiation of a cell are often es-\nentially discrete and cells of the same type often reside\nogether with sharp boundaries between different cell\nypes (due to differential cell adhesion\u2014see, for ex-\nmple [14]). Thus, we explore now the case where the\neterogeneities due to different cell types take the form\nf distinct patches within the domain. We assume that\nhe boundaries between these patches are sharp, result-\nng in parameter discontinuities across the boundaries.\nAs discussed in [26], a discontinuity in a parameter\nan lead to patterns when the parameters are nowhere\nn the Turing space. The patterns formed in this case\nre spatially restricted to the region around the discon-\ninuity. Here, we show that the geometry of the patchesway from the boundary.\nThe same phenomenon can occur when both patches\nave parameters within the Turing space (in this case\nhe amplitudes do not decay away from the bound-\nry). Fig. 9(a) shows an example of this in which the\noundary between the patches is along a diagonal of the\nquare. This shows that the stripes align with the patch\noundary rather than the sides of the square. When the\narameter set in one patch is further from bifurcation\nfurther within the Turing space), it initiates spots de-\npite the existence of the discontinuity at the boundary.\nhus, the pattern can vary from stripes to spots across\nhe domain, see Fig. 9(b). A local region inside the do-\n3 Convergence to steady state is very slow and the time taken for\nimulation is large, so we wait until the L2 norm of the change in u\nn one time-step, t = 0.01, is less than the tolerance, which we set to\ne 0.001. This happens at t = 192.61.\nK.M. Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115 107\nFig. 8.

The local difference could\narise naturally due to the local expression of a gene.\nWe show an example of such a pattern in Fig. 9(c), in\nwhich \u00b5 takes the value 2.5 on most of the domain, but\nequals 2.0 on a small square patch in the centre. If the\nregion is at the edge of the domain (for example next\nto the tail of a fish) then it could lead to a pattern of\nnested semicircles, as seen on Pomacanthus semicircu-\nlatus, see Fig. 10(b). The form of these patterns results\nfrom the fact that pattern formation propagates from\nthe boundary of the parameter discontinuity (see [26]).\nFinally, Fig. 9(d) shows a spatially restricted pattern\nproduced when the parameters are within the Turing\nspace (by which we mean the Turing space for a large\nzero flux domain) only on a patch in the centre of the\ndomain.\nEven if the patterns, such as those in Fig. 9, con-\nverge very slowly to a steady state, if the concentration\nof activator surpasses some threshold for a sustained\nperiod in a spatial region, this may be sufficient to\ntrigger differentiation. In general, the changes in pat-\ntern which occur at late times tend to take the form\nof small movements of a few pattern elements or the\nappearance or disappearance of a pattern element. If\nwe consider that the cells differentiate after sufficient\nexposure to super-threshold activator, then these rear-\nrangements are likely to have only a minor effect on the\np\n6. Discussion\nThe patterning of an embryo is naturally hierarchi-\ncal. Consequently, most patterning processes take place\nin an environment that is already spatially heteroge-\nneous. At a very early stage the embryo already consists\nof patches of different cell types and biologically active\nchemicals are distributed nonuniformly. Turing origi-\nnally proposed reaction\u2013diffusion as a mechanism for\nspontaneously generating patterns from random fluc-\ntuations about a homogeneous background [30]. Much\nsubsequent work on reaction\u2013diffusion patterning has\nconcentrated on systems with constant coefficients,\nboth because these systems are more mathematically\ntractable (but still very challenging to solve) and be-\ncause of the elegant appeal of the symmetry-breaking\nprocess.\nMuch work has focused on pattern selection in non-\nlinear systems and reaction\u2013diffusion has often been\ncriticised as a model for biological pattern formation\nbecause the selection can be very sensitive to pertur-\nbations. As illustrated by the results presented here,\npattern selection can be greatly influenced by spatial\nvariations in the parameters and so, in modelling bio-\nlogical systems, it may be more relevant to study this\nmore complex case. Attempts to demonstrate Turing\npatterns in real chemical systems have led to some\nwork on reaction\u2013diffusion systems with graded pa-\nrameters, since the (quasi-two-dimensional gel) reac-\ntors tend to be fed with different chemicals from two\noattern. pposite boundaries (see, for example [4]).

More recently,\nhowever, periodic spatial forcing has been investigated\nin a chemical reactor system and it has been shown [11]\nthat this can lead to more regular Turing patterns with\nfewer defects in two dimensions. In this context, the\nmore complex patterning capabilities of two coupled\nreaction\u2013diffusion systems have also been investigated\n[32].\nCompared to the experimental chemical reactors,\nthe cellular environment of the embryo can be far more\ncomplex and heterogeneous. Cells are nonuniform in\ntheir type and density and can produce, sequester and\ndegrade biochemicals in a selective manner. Further-\nmore, the extracellular matrix may also be heteroge-\nneous and contains factors which modulate the be-\nhaviours of putative morphogens [29]. As discussed\nabove, chemicals cannot only modulate the reactions\nof other chemicals but can also alter their mobility and\nstability.\nIn [26], we have shown that spatial variation of pa-\nrameters in the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model can lead to\nthe production of patterns when the parameters are ev-\nerywhere outside the Turing space and that the pat-\nterns produced can be spatially restricted. In this pa-\nper, we have explored in more detail the ways in\nK.M. Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115 109\nFig. 10. Pictures of the nested ring-like patterns on skin of the marine angelfish. (a) P. imperator; (b) P. semicirculatus.\nwhich spatially inhomogeneous parameters contribute\nto the generation of complex patterns. We have looked\nat the ways in which the various parameters of the\nGierer\u2013Meinhardt model system control different as-\npects of the pattern. The Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model is\nphenomenological, and so it is not clear that all of\nthe parameters would correspond to simple biophysical\nquantities in a particular biological application. How-\never, since the diffusion coefficients and decay rates\nthat we have varied are generic parameters it is likely\nthat their effects on the pattern would be qualitatively\nsimilar for other model systems. Future work could re-\npeat the analysis of this paper for more realistic mod-\nels and consider the generality of the results. We con-\njecture that many features of the work would simply\ngeneralise.\nWorking on a one-dimensional domain, we demon-\nstrated that a pre-pattern in a parameter can lead to a\ncomplex pattern of peaks of variable sizes. For certain\nratios of pre-pattern wavelength to natural wavelength\nof the system with constant parameters, we found that\nthe pre-pattern wavelength \u201cfixed\u201d the wavelength of\nthe final pattern, in the sense that only harmonics of the\npre-pattern were found in the final pattern (and the pat-\ntern was different to that obtained with constant param-\neters). The pattern formed was independent of the noise\nin the initial conditions, implying that a pre-pattern in\na parameter can enhance the robustness of pattern se-\nlection. Thus instead of leading to even more complex\npossibilities, hierarchical patterning can, in some cases,\nbe more reliable.\nWe also found that a spatially varying parameter\ncan result in the generation of peaks that move as a\nwave across the domain. Movement of patterns due to\nthe modulation of a control parameter has been ob-\nserved before in other patterning systems, for exam-\nple in Rayleigh\u2013Benard convection, see for example\n[15,33]. Peaks that move as waves have also been seen\nbefore in Turing systems where the parameter which is\nvarying in space crosses the Turing bifurcation [17,31].\nHere, however, we show that travelling waves of pat-\ntern can also occur in a system with a spatially varying\nparameter, with values that are always within the Tur-\ning space. Indeed the patterns concerned have steep\n\u201cspiky\u201d profiles, characteristic of a system which is far\nfrom bifurcation in the highly nonlinear regime. Such\nbehaviour could have important implications for appli-\ncations in biology. On the one hand, spatio-temporal\npatterns of gene expression resembling those seen in\nour simulations have been observed (during the for-\nmation of somites, for example see [19]). On the other\nhand, if small spatial variations in a parameter can cause\nthe peaks of a reaction\u2013diffusion pattern to move, this\ncould cast doubt on the reliability of reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystems as mechanisms for the production of stable\nspatial patterns. Given that the behaviour of the system\nwill depend on many details such as parameter val-\nues and the form of spatial variations, this issue would\n110 K.M. Page et al. \/ Physica D 202 (2005) 95\u2013115\nrequire detailed investigation in any particular applica-\ntion.\nIn two dimensions, we found that a sinusoidal pre-\npattern in a parameter could give rise to a pattern of\nlarge and small spots, like that on the head of the lizard\nC. fedtschenkoi. These spots can be arranged as a large\nspot surrounded by several smaller ones, similar to the\narrangement of mammalian hair follicles. A hierarchi-\ncal reaction\u2013diffusion system can thus provide an al-\nternative model of follicle initiation to that proposed\nby Nagorcka [23,24] and detailed above. We postu-\nlate that if the kinetics are such that the system with\nconstant parameters produces a striped pattern, then a\nsinusoidally varying parameter could lead to a pattern\nof thick and thin stripes, as seen on the skins of various\nspecies. (For a chemotactic model which can give rise\nto thick and thin stripes see [27].)\nThe geometry of the parameter patches in two di-\nmensions can have a significant impact on the final\npattern formed. If the system with constant parameters\ngives rise to a pattern of spots, then a straight patch\nboundary can, nevertheless, trigger a pattern of stripes\nor a mixed pattern of stripes and spots (for a discussion\nof the problem of obtaining striped patterns see [20]).\nA small parameter patch can lead to a target pattern or\npattern of nested semicircles, as seen on the skins of\nfish of the Pomacanthus family.\nIn summary, we have shown in this paper that spa-\ntially varying parameters in reaction\u2013diffusion systems\ncan greatly enhance the range of patterns available to\na\ns\nr\nA\n(\nB\nB\nt\no\nR\nf\ns\ne\nt\nTaiwan and Hokkaido University, Sapporo, for partial\nsupport.\nAppendix A.

The right hand boundary condi-\nion will then determine v\u2217 if we know the positions of\nhe boundary layers. Thus the location of the boundary\nayers is sufficient to fully determine the solution. Al-\nernatively, we can use an integral condition (obtained\nrom the differential equation for v) to determine v\u2217. We\nllustrate this for an example solution with n boundary\nayers at x = 1\/2n, 3\/2n, . . . , (2n\u2212 1)\/2n.\nIntegrating the second equation of (1) and using the\nero flux boundary conditions, we obtain\n\u222b 1\n0\n(ru2 \u2212 \u03bdv) dx = 0.

(A.18)\nWe wish to compare our matched asymptotic solu-\ntions to the numerical solution. Our analysis does not\nallow us to determine the location of the boundary\nlayers. If, however, we know the location and height\nof the leftmost inhibitor peak, we can calculate its\nform and the height and the form of the activator\npeak.

In Fig. A.1(a), we show\nthe resulting analytical solution on the domain to the\nleft of the second boundary layer (thick line) compared\nwith the numerical solution (thin line). The solution\nbecomes inaccurate towards the second boundary\nlayer. This is due to a small error in the values used for\nthe matching conditions. Thus we see that a small dis-\ncrepancy in the coefficients of the cosh and sinh parts\nof the solution (caused by a small error in the matching\nvalues of v\u2217 and \u001cvx) is enough to lead to a significant\ndiscrepancy in the solution far from the boundary layer.\nTo leading order, the activator concentration is zero\noutside the boundary layer and has a very high peak in\nthe boundary layer. In Fig. A.1(b), we show that there\nis excellent agreement between the analytical form of\nthis solution (assuming the value of v\u2217 obtained from\nthe numerical inhibitor solution) and the numerical so-\nlution (solid line) on a small region of the domain that\nincludes the left-hand boundary layer.\nOur analysis shows that when d \u2261 Du\/Dv is O(\t2),\nthe width of the activator peaks is proportional to the\ndiffusion wavelength of the activator \u03bbu \u2261\n\u221a\nDu\/\u00b5.\nThe length-scale of the inhibitor pattern (which gives\nus an idea of the spacing of the activator peaks) is of\nt\n\u03bb\no\ni\nl\nv\n|\na\no\nl\nl\ns\nand hence\nv\u2217 \u223c A \u221d r\u03be\n\u00b5\n.

From (A.6) and (A.10) we see that this implies\nthat the heights of the activator peaks are proportional\nto \u03be = \u221aDv\u03bd\/Du\u00b5.\nWe look now for a perturbation solution when r is\nO(1). We find that the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model equa-\ntions without the constant term+r in the activator equa-\ntion (see Eq.

We also find in simulations and in the above\nperturbation analysis for small r that v is roughly pro-\nportional to r in the full Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model sys-\ntem with the added constant term. This leads us to look\nfor an outer expansion in which v is O(1\/\t) when r is\nO(1), since v was O(1) when r was O(\t). The analysis\nfollows as before and we find an outer solution\nu = u0 + \tu1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , v = 1\n\t\n(v0 + \tv1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7),\n(A.23)\nwhere\nu\n( )\nu\na\nb\nv\nw\nc\nb\nvhe order of the diffusion wavelength of the inhibitor\nv \u2261\n\u221a\nDv\/\u03bd.
