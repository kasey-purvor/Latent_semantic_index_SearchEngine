New technology was most likely to 'normalize' where implementers perceived that it had a positive impact on interactions between professionals and patients and between different professional groups, and fit well with the organisational goals and skill sets of existing staff. However, where implementers perceived problems in one or more of these areas, they also perceived a lower level of normalization.<p><\/p>\\ud\n\\ud\n<b>Conclusions<\/b> Implementers had rich understandings of barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of e-health initiatives, and their views should continue to be sought in future research. NPT can be used to explain observed variations in implementation processes, and may be useful in drawing planners' attention to potential problems with a view to addressing them during implementation planning.<\/dc:description><dc:format>application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>http:\/\/eprints.gla.ac.uk\/47538\/1\/47538.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:publisher>BioMed Central<\/dc:publisher><dc:source>1748-5908<\/dc:source><dc:subject>RA<\/dc:subject><dc:title>Why is it difficult to implement e-health initiatives?
