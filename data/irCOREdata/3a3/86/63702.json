Introduction \nThe prediction of incipient motion of a particle lying in a bed of similar particles (i.e. the \nentrainment of sedimentary particles from the surface into the fluid when the fluid speed exceeds a \ncertain threshold), is fundamental for understanding sediment transport by water and wind [Graf, \n1971; Quan and Wan, 1983; Nickling, 1988; Raupach and Lu, 2004]. Shields [1936] pioneered \nresearch into incipient motion in open channels by introducing the dimensionless threshold shear \nstress *  ( )t p fA g d\u03c4 \u03c1 \u03c1= \u2212 , a measure of the ratio of the threshold hydrodynamic force on a \nsurface particle to its weight (see Table 1 for definitions of symbols). Shields argued that A should \nbe a unique function of the particle Reynolds number Re*t = u*t d\/\u03bd, as \n *(Re )tA F= .          (1) \nFor particle entrainment by air flow, Bagnold [1941] derived a similar theory considering the \nbalance between the aerodynamic drag and the gravitational force. He found that at large Re*t, A is \nnearly a constant and u*t \u221d d1\/2, which is essentially consistent with Shields' theory obtained in open \nchannels. Across all particle sizes, Bagnold also assumed that A is a unique function of Re*t, again \nconsistent with the proposals of Shields.  \nOver the last 70 years, experimental research into incipient motion has in general supported the \ntheories of Shields and Bagnold [White, 1970; Graf, 1971; Yalin, 1972; Mantz, 1977; Buffington \nand Montgomery, 1997; Zingg, 1953; Greeley and Iversen, 1985; Nickling, 1988]. Figure 1 shows \ndata obtained in experiments in air [Cleaver and Yates, 1973; Fletcher, 1976a,b; Iversen and White, \n1982;] and in water [Graf, 1971; Yalin, 1972; White, 1970], plotted on a typical Shields' \u0391 ~ Re*t \ndiagram.  Three distinct regions can be identified:  \ni) Re*t \u2265 10; a region where the flow is fully turbulent, and where \u0391 attains a constant value of \napproximately 0.04 to 0.06 at Re*t  \u2265  500 in water, and 0.01 to 0.03 in air (note that there are \nfew data with Re*t  \u2265 200 for air flows); \nii) Re*t < 1; a region where particle entrainment is mainly due to viscous laminar flow, where \u0391 \nincreases while Re*t decreases, at a rate which is steeper in air than in water; and \niii) A transitional region, 1 \u2264 Re*t \u2264 10, where the laminar sublayer partially covers the particles, \nbut the outer turbulent flow is partially affected by the roughness of the grain bed. Within \nthis region, \u0391 reaches a minimum value of approximately 0.03 to 0.06 for water [Yalin and \nKarahan, 1979], but such minima are not obvious for air entrainment [Greeley and Iversen, \n1985]. \n 3\nFigure 1 shows that data obtained from airflow and open channel flow do not collapse to a single \u0391 \n~ Re*t relationship. The upturn of the Shields curve at Re*t < 1 in air flow is much sharper than for \nwater flow. For Re*t \u2265 5, \u0391 is about 3 to 4 times smaller in air than in water. \n [[Insert Figure 1 here]] \nSeveral researchers have noted the different behaviour of A in air and in water, and that the \nexpressions for A derived in one fluid cannot be directly applied to another [Bagnold, 1941; Graf, \n1971; Iversen and Pollack, 1987]. Bagnold [1941] suggested that the differences might be due to a \ndifference in surface texture or bed packing conditions, or to observation errors. Iversen and \nPollack [1987] attributed the difference to density ratio differences. By adding the impacting force \nof saltating particles to the force balance equation, they related A empirically to the particle-to-fluid \ndensity ratio. Although not directly targeting the different behaviour of A in air and in water, a \nrecent study of incipient motion in air has also incorporated the effect of the particle-to-fluid density \nratio [Cornelis and Gabriels, 2004]. Interestingly, although Cornelis and Gabriels [2004] and \nIversen and Pollack [1987] both related A to the density ratio, and both utilized the same data of \nIversen and White [1982], the expression of Iversen and Pollack [1987] suggests that A decreases \nwith increasing particle-to-fluid density ratio while the expression of Cornelis and Gabriels [2004] \nsuggests A increases with increasing density ratio. Making the situation more confusing, a \ncomprehensive review of incipient motion in open channel flow concludes that there is no obvious \ndependence of A on particle density, therefore, on density ratio [Buffington and Montgomery 1997]. \nThese contradictions suggest that the quantitative relationships between A and flow conditions, fluid \nproperties and particle properties remain unclear. It is also not clear why, for a given fluid and \nunder similar experimental conditions, randomly-varying values of A have often been obtained.   \nMuch research into incipient motion has been based on a force balance at the instant of particle \nentrainment [Bagnold, 1941; Phillips, 1980; Iversen and White, 1982], and\/or analysis of \ndimensionless groups [Shields, 1936; Fletcher, 1976a,b]. With certain assumptions, the functional \nforms for the parameter A are predetermined and then fitted to experimental data, and in some cases, \nexcessive parameter fitting is involved [Greeley and Iversen, 1985; Cornelis and Gabriels, 2004].  \nThese studies have provided a means of estimating threshold shear stress under idealized situations. \nNevertheless, such a deterministic reductionism often results in partial explanations of the several \nprocesses involved in incipient motion. Apart from the inability to explain differences of A ~ Re*t \nrelationships in air and water, there is a lack of agreement about the values of A and the physical \ncauses of why, for Re*t \u2264 1, the estimates of A vary by an order of magnitude or more for a given \nRe*t. Emphasizing the effects of flow, Bagnold [1956] argued that A will not exceed 0.4, but values \n 4\nof A greater than 10 have been found for d \u2264 10 \u00b5m [White, 1970; Cleaver and Yates, 1973; \nFletcher, 1976a,b]. By assuming laminar sub-layer flow, Yalin [1972] derived \u0391 = 0.1\/Re*t. With \nsimilar assumptions for the flow regime and force balance, Ling [1995] suggested that A is inversely \nproportional to Re*t for rolling grains, and inversely proportional to 2*Re t  for a threshold lift \ncondition. Both studies implied that the increase in \u0391 with decreasing Re*t is solely due to the \ntransition in flow regime from turbulent to laminar flow.  \nFor particle entrainment in air flow, Iversen and White [1982] attributed the sharp upturn of A for \nRe*t < 1 to the effects of inter-particle cohesion forces. To account for the effect of cohesion, \nGreeley and Iversen [1985] suggested that A should be of the form  \n1 *(Re ) ( )tA A F G d=          (2) \nwhere the dimensionless functions F(Re*t) and G(d) respectively represent the effects of \naerodynamic and cohesion forces. Eq. (2) essentially implies that the upturn of A for Re*t < 1 is \npartially due to the flow condition (through the term F(Re*t)) and partially due to inter-particle \ncohesion (through the term G(d)). Though eq. (2) overcomes the shortcomings of the early \nexpression of Bagnold [1941] and is effective in describing the behaviour of u*t for the entire \nparticle size range, the expressions proposed by Greeley and Iversen [1985] involve the two \nempirical functions, F(Re*t) and G(d), and are difficult to relate to physical processes.    \nWhile earlier theoretical analysis often focused on the effects of flow conditions by relating A to the \nparticle Reynolds number Re*t, more recent empirical or semi-empirical studies have to some \ndegree sought to remove the flow term F(Re*t) in eq. (2), or to replace it by a particle property. For \ninstance, Marticorena and Bergametti [1995] simplified the expressions of Greeley and Iversen \n[1985] by expressing Re*t as a function of particle size only. Shao and Lu [2000] reanalyzed the \nwind tunnel data of Iversen and White [1982] and suggested that A =AN G(d),  where AN  is a \nconstant of 0.013 and G(d) representing the effects of interparticle cohesion,. More recently, \nCornelis and Gabriels [2004] expressed A as a function of the particle-to-fluid density ratio, particle \ndiameter and interparticle cohesion. Their expression involves five empirical constants that were \ndetermined by fitting to the data of Iversen and White [1982] using non-linear regression. Such \nemphases on sedimentological controls are also abundant in the hydraulic literature. For example, in \nopen channels with mixed bed material particle sizes, studies have commonly expressed A as an \ninverse empirical function of the ratio of particle size d to the underlying median bed particle size \nd50 [Komar and Li, 1988; Richards, 1990; Buffington and Montgomery, 1997]. \n 5\nA clear advantage of using these semi-empirical expressions of A is their simplicity. If A is not \nexpressed as a function of Re*t, iteration is avoided, since the friction velocity u*t  no longer appears \non both sides of the expression for u*t. This is particularly appealing for large-scale spatially-\ndistributed applications [Marticorena and Bergametti, 1995]. However, the drawback of these \nexpressions is their failure to account fully for the physical processes involved. As noted by Qian \nand Wan [1983], a variety of models could fit the experimental data well as long as the chosen \nexpression has the right shape and contains at least two free parameters to describe the upturn of A \nfor both large and small Re*t ranges. There is little basis for judging the superiority of an expression \nsolely on goodness of statistical fit if the physical meaning of the fitted parameters is not clearly \nunderstood. A more general, physically-based approach to the threshold of entrainment is needed.   \nRealizing that deterministic approaches can only estimate the average values of threshold shear \nstress but unable to predict the observed variations, some researchers have proposed that particle \nincipient motion is a stochastic process, i.e. there exists a range of threshold shear stresses for a \ngiven particle size [Grass, 1970; Gessler, 1971]. Field and laboratory observations in open channel \nflow confirm a variability of threshold shear stress attributable to a number of random factors \nincluding temporal fluctuation of near bed turbulence, the bed packing condition, and \nheterogeneities in grain size and shape, etc [Einstein, 1950; Grass, 1970]. In the hydraulic literature, \nrecent research into incipient motion has focused on finding appropriate probability distributions for \ninstantaneous flow velocity or shear stress [Cheng and Chiew, 1998; Wu and Lin, 2002], the effects \nof random bed roughness and picking conditions [Papanicolaou et al., 2001; 2002], or the \ncombined probabilistic nature of turbulent fluctuation and bed grain geometry [Wu and Chou, 2003]. \nNevertheless, incorporating statistical\/stochastic concepts remains rare in the modeling of particle \nincipient motion during wind erosion.  \nThe objective of this paper is to derive a general expression for A, to explain the differences in A ~ \nRe*t  plots between air and water. We incorporate the effect of fluid turbulence by utilizing recent \nadvances in understanding of turbulence over rough walls, especially the scaling of velocity \nfluctuations with bulk Reynolds number (using boundary layer height \u03b4 as the length scale rather \nthan particle diameter d). We also consider the probabilistic aspects of grain entrainment by \nadopting a log-normal distribution for the near-bed instantaneous flow velocity.  The new \nexpression also incorporates the influences of interparticle cohesion forces to account for the \nupturning of A for small values of Re*t. We use the new expression to analyze the effects of both the \nmean flow and turbulent fluctuations, and the physical causes of the different regions in the Shields \n 6\ndiagram, which are shown to depend on changes in the relative magnitude of the appropriate forces. \nThough no direct curve-fitting is used, our results compare well with available experimental data. \n2. Methods and The New Theory \nThis paper considers a flat surface covered by uniformly-sized erodible particles. The x-axis lies in \nthe plane of the bed surface, its direction parallel to the direction of flow, while the y-axis is \nperpendicular to the bed and directed upwards. The height origin (y = 0) is taken to be the \naerodynamic height origin, defined as the level of effective drag or zero-plane displacement (Figure \n2). An overbar denotes a temporal average. A superscript + with a velocity variable (either its mean \nor fluctuation) denotes normalization by the friction velocity u*, as in *u u u\n+\n= ;  a similar \nsuperscript with a length variable denotes normalization by the viscous length scale \u03bd\/u* , as in \n*y u y \u03bd\n+\n= . Also, subscripts a and w denote the air and water cases, respectively.  \n[[Insert Figure 2 here]] \n2.1 Forces Involved in Particle Entrainment \nAnalysis of the particle threshold condition begins by defining a force balance on a static grain \nsitting on the bed surface. A particle resting on the bed (Figure 2) is subjected to forces of drag DF , \nlift LF , specific weight GF  and a net cohesion force CF . We assume that CF  is approximately equal \nin magnitude to the cohesion force between two adjacent individual particles, but follows the \ndirection of GF .  The forces other than CF  can be expressed as \n( ) 3\n6G p f\nF gd= \u2212\u03c0 \u03c1 \u03c1 ,          (3) \n2\n2\nf\nD D\nSu\nF C \u2206=\n\u03c1\n,          (4) \n \n2\n2\nf\nL L\nSu\nF C \u2206=\n\u03c1\n,          (5) \nwhere u\u2206 = u  + u\u2019 is a streamwise reference instantaneous velocity at the threshold of grain motion, \nand other symbols are defined in Table 1. The frontal area S is approximately equal to 20.2 d\u03c0  for \nthe packing geometry shown in Figure 2.  \n 7\nChoosing the reference height y\u2206 where u\u2206 is defined can be difficult. Wu and Lin [2002] and Wu \nand Chou [2003] effectively calculated y\u2206  by integrating both u  and u\u2019 over the frontal area of the \nabout-to-move particle exposed to the flow. Such an approach is difficult to justify in fluid \nmechanical terms, for several reasons. Firstly, one cannot define the instantaneous velocity at a \nsolid surface as zero, because of the no slip condition. Secondly, at any height within the roughness \nelements, the velocity field is complex and three-dimensional because fluid has to find its way \naround the roughness elements. Thirdly, the drag on a surface-mounted roughness element does not \nsatisfy a simple momentum integral constraint equivalent to the relationship for a wake of an \nobstacle in a free stream [Batchelor, 1967; Raupach, 1992], because of the absence of a free-stream \nvelocity. Finally, an individual roughness element is exposed to a turbulent flow including not only \na mean shear but also strong turbulence with contributions both from the large-scale boundary-layer \nand also the wakes of other roughness elements. \nTo handle these complexities, it is usual to define u\u2206  as the velocity at a reference height y\u2206 ,  \nhorizontally-averaged over an area large enough to smooth out spatial fluctuations caused by the \nbed roughness (in practice a horizontal distance of order 10d).  This quantity is analogous to the free \nstream velocity for the drag coefficient of a body in a uniform flow.  In the case of incipient motion, \nthe logical choice for y\u2206  is the mean height of the most exposed roughness elements, i.e. y\u2206 = \u03b2d, \nwhere \u03b2  is a constant. For instantaneous velocity, the likely choice for \u03b2  is between 0.5 and 1.0, \nsince the most exposed elements rest some way above the mean position of all bed elements. The \nlevel of effective drag or zero-plane displacement (our height origin y = 0) is approximately 0.5d to \n0.7d above the bed substrate level [Jackson, 1981; Bridge and Bennett, 1992].  Cheng and Chiew \n[1998] suggested \u03b2  = 0.6 for the most stable bed packing situation where particles of identical size \nrest in an interstice formed by closely-packed bed surface particles.  In Section 3.1, the effects of \u03b2 \non the values of A will be discussed. \nThe effects of cohesion forces on incipient motion and the dependence of cohesion forces on \nparticle size are complex and poorly understood [Zimon, 1982; Shao and Lu, 2000; Cornelis and \nGabriels, 2004]. Cohesion forces arise from both mutual attraction between solid particles, and \ninteraction between the solid particles and those of the ambient fluid medium. The cohesion force is \naffected by the combination of molecular forces (including the van der Vaal's forces), Coulomb \nforces, electrostatic forces, capillary forces, and chemical bonding forces. Although these forces are \nfunctions of particle size d, their dependences on d are different, with molecular forces and \nelectrostatic forces proportional to d, Coulomb forces proportional to 1\/d2, the capillary force \n 8\nproportional to d(1\u2212dx\u22121), where x is the width of a microscopic water bridge in the contact zone of \ntwo particles [Zimon, 1982]. For instance, the cohesion forces between two identical spheres can be \nexpressed as \n232\ni\nC\ni\ncF d\nz\u03c0\n=  ,          (6) \nwhere ci is the cohesion coefficient and zi is the smallest separation between two spherical particles \n[Theodoor and Overbeek, 1985]. Eq. (6) indicates two possible relationships between FC and d: if zi \nis proportional to d, Eq  (6) gives FC proportional to 1\/d (assuming no dependence of ci on d), while \nif zi is a constant, CF  is proportional to d. \nObservations in air have resulted in various relationships between CF  and d:  direct, inverse and \nexponential dependence of the cohesion force on d, or even complete independence over a certain \nrange of d [Zimon, 1982]. In water, the dependence of cohesion forces on particle size is simpler \nand most experiments suggest that CF  is proportional to d [Corn, 1961; Zimon, 1982].  This is \nbecause in water, capillary and electrostatic forces do not apply as any charges on the particles will \nleak away and no capillary bridge develops within the particle contact zone [Theodoor and \nOverbeek, 1985].  This results in the cohesion force in a liquid medium being governed by \nmolecular forces, which implies direct proportionality to d [Fuks, 1955]. Nevertheless, in the case \nof threshold conditions over a loosely-packed bed with a small removal probability of grains \n(approximately 2%), direct proportionality between CF  and d may hold in both water and air media \nas \n C CF C d= ,          (7) \nwhere CC is a proportionality constant, according to Fuks [1955] and Zimon [1982]. \nAt the instant of particle motion, the combined retarding force moments must just balance the \ncombined hydrodynamic driving force moment. Such a condition is expressed as \n D D L L G G C CF L F L F L F L+ = + ,        (8) \nwhere LD = dcos\u03b8,  LL =dsin\u03b8, LG = dsin\u03b8 and LC = dsin\u03b8 are the moment arms (about the pivot \npoint P) of FD, FL, FG and FC (as shown in Figure 2). Following Wu and Lin [2003], the pivoting \nangle \u03b8  ranges from 30\u00b0 when the grain is at its most exposed, to 90\u00b0 when it is embedded within \nthe surface grain layer.  \nCombining eqs. (3) to (5) and (7) with eq. (8), the threshold condition can be written as \n 9\n tu u\u2206 \u2265 ,           (9)  \nwhere  \n3\n2\n( )2 6 11\n6 ( )\np f fw C C\nt\nD D L L f p f w\ngL d C Lu\nC L C L S g L d\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1\u03c0\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c0\n\u239b \u239e\n\u2212\n= +\u239c \u239f\u239c \u239f+ \u2212\u239d \u23a0\n   (10) \nis the threshold velocity. Eq. (9) simply states that the instantaneous reference velocity u\u2206  must \nexceed tu  for particle detachment to occur. If we assume u\u2206 obeys a certain probability distribution, \ntu  is therefore defined by a point on the velocity probability distribution of u\u2206 at the reference \nheight y from the bed where u\u2206 is defined, and the probability of particle detachment from the bed is \np = Prob( tu u\u2206 \u2265 ), as shown in Figure 3. The derivation of A based on a log-normal distribution of \nu\u2206 for a given probability removal rate p is given in Section 2.4.  \n[[Insert Figure 3 here]] \nWe turn now to the values of CD and CL. Compared with the well-studied situation of an isolated \nobject in a free stream, where the drag coefficient is a function of Reynolds number (Re*  = u* d \/\u03bd) \nand is proportional to 1\/ Re* for small Re*, the drag coefficient for a particle resting on a surface is \nmore complex and less well understood [Fischer et al., 2002; Jim\u00e9nez, 2004]. It has been found that \nthe drag coefficient CD  \u2248 0.15 \u2212 0.30 for a sphere resting on a surface [Tillman, 1944], but may be \nup to 1.25 for two-dimensional span-wise obstacles [Jim\u00e9nez, 2004]. Chepil [1958] provided one of \nthe most comprehensive data sets on the lift coefficient CL in air, and showed that the average ratio \nof lift to drag is nearly constant at 0.85 for a boundary layer friction Reynolds number of Re\u03c4 \u2264 \n5000, where Re\u03c4  = u* \u03b4\/\u03bd and \u03b4  is the height of the boundary layer. Mainly for channel flows, \nJames [1990] proposed \n * *\n*\n0.56 0.212ln Re Re 150\n0.5 Re 150\nL\nD\nC\nC\n\u2212 + <\u23a7\n= \u23a8 \u2265\u23a9\n.     (11) \nEq. (11) suggests that CL could be negative at Re*  < 15.  Marsh et al. [2004] derived a similar \nexpression to eq. (11) but with CL\/CD  \u2248 0.2 for Re*  > 100. The data of Patnaik et al. [1994] for \ngravel-bed rivers showed CL\/CD  \u2248 1, and an apparent decreasing trend of the lift-to-drag ratio with \nincreasing Re*  in the range 4,000 to 60,000. However, this has limited relevance to this study, \nwhere we focus on Re*  in the range from 1 to 10,000. This is because aeolian transport involves a \nnarrower range of particle sizes than in rivers, and in air, there is little reliable data on threshold \nvelocities for Re*t  > 100.  Furthermore, the exact values for temporally-averaged drag and lift \n 10\ncoefficients are unknown at present, as they both depend upon flow conditions. Though the \ndependence of CD and CL on Re* is likely to have some effects on A, especially for small Re*, for \nsimplicity, values of CD = 0.5 and CL = 0.3 are used in this study. According to Coleman [1967], for \na 3D sphere and \u03b8  = 30\u00b0, LD = 3 2d , and LL = LG = LC = d\/2. These values are used here.  \n2.2 Mean Velocity Profile over Rough Surfaces \nThe classic theory of near-wall turbulent flow defines the universal logarithmic velocity profile for \na smooth wall, \n 1 lnu y B\n\u03ba\n+ +\n= + ,         (12) \nwhere u  is the mean flow velocity at height y, \u03ba is von Karman's constant (0.41), and B is an \nempirical constant with a value of 5.0 [Clauser, 1956; Panton, 2005]. The effect of roughness on \nthe logarithmic velocity profile is a downward shift of eq. (12), corresponding to the increase in \nskin friction [Raupach et al., 1991]. The logarithmic law for a rough surface can then be written as \n 1 lnu y B u\n\u03ba\n+ + +\n= + \u2212 \u2206 .        (13) \nThere are three regimes in turbulent flow: smooth, transitionally-rough and fully-rough flow \n[Raupach et al., 1991]. Ligrani and Moffat [1986] suggested that these three flow regimes can be \nclassified by sk\n+ < 2.25 when the flow is smooth, and sk\n+   > 90 when it is fully rough, where \n*s sk u k\n+\n= \u03bd  is the roughness Reynolds number, and ks is the equivalent sand grain roughness.  \nThe roughness function u +\u2206  in eq. (13) has been measured experimentally by Nikuradse [1933] \nusing sand roughness of different grain sizes, and in many other experiments over other kinds of \nrough surface; see Raupach et al. [1991] for review. For a uniform sand bed, ks is equal to the \ndiameter of the particles. Ligrani and Moffat [1986] used Nikuradse's data to obtain \n 1 = ln 8.5su k B\u03be \u03ba\n+ +\u239b \u239e\u2206 + \u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0 ,        (14) \nin which the interpolation function  \n( )\n( )\n0 2.25\nln \/ 2.25\nsin 2.25 90\n2ln 90 \/ 2.25\n1 90\ns\ns\ns\ns\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\u03c0\u03be\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u23a7 <\u23aa \u23a1 \u23a4\u23aa \u23a2 \u23a5= \u2264 <\u23a8 \u23a2 \u23a5\u23aa \u23a3 \u23a6\u23aa \u2265\u23a9\n     (15) \n 11\nincreases from 0 to 1 through the transitionally-rough regime, 2.25 90sk\n+\u2264 < . Eq. (14) recovers the \nsmooth wall log-law in the smooth regime, and suggests that, in the transitionally-rough regime, the \nroughness function u +\u2206  is near zero for sk\n+  below approximately 5.  \nWe note in passing that the rough wall law, eq. (13), is commonly represented as  \n \n0\n1 ln yu\nz\u03ba\n+ \u239b \u239e\n= \u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n,         (16) \nwhere z0 is the zero-velocity level of the logarithmic profile. The dimensionless quantities z0\/ks, \u03be \nand u +\u2206  carry equivalent information [Raupach et al., 1991]. Substituting eqs. (13) and (14) into \neq. (16) and solving for z0, we have \n( )\n( ) ( )\n0 exp ln\nexp 1 ln 1 8.5\ns\ns s\nz k k B u\nk k B\n\u03ba\n\u03be \u03be \u03ba \u03ba\u03be\n+ +\n+\n\u23a1 \u23a4= \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2206\u23a3 \u23a6\n\u23a1 \u23a4= \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212\u23a3 \u23a6\n.     (17)  \nFor fully rough flows, \u03be = 1 (eq. (15)). Substituting it into eqs. (13) and (17) gives \n1 ln 8.5\ns\nyu\nk\u03ba\n+ \u239b \u239e\n= +\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n,         (18) \nand \n( )0 \/ exp 8.5 0.031sz k \u03ba= \u2212 = ,        (19) \nrespectively. Eqs. (18) and (19) are consistent with common assumptions in the hydraulics literature \nand the \u2018z0 ~ d\/30 rule\u2019 that is commonly known to wind tunnel experimentalists (assuming d = ks \nfor well sorted sand). In terms of threshold entrainment, all three flow regimes are relevant, \ndepending on particle size and flow conditions. In this study, we shall compare the dimensionless \nshear stress A resulting from eqs. (13) and (14) with those derived from the fully-rough limit, eqs. \n(16) and (19).   \nSome researchers argue that u +  depends not only on y+  but also on the flow Reynolds number \n[Barenblatt and Chorin, 1998]. However, in comparison to that of roughness, such effects are \nrelatively minor in the inner part of the mean velocity profile [Panton, 2005] and are not fully \nunderstood when roughness elements are present [Bergstrom et al., 2001].  \n 12\n2.3 Reynolds-Number Dependence of Near-bed Turbulent Velocity  \nLike the mean velocity profile, the turbulence in air and in water is governed by universal \ndimensionless scaling laws. However, a major distinction between turbulent airflow and turbulent \nriver flow lies in the flow Reynolds number ( *Re u\u03c4 \u03b4 \u03bd= , where \u03b4 is the boundary layer depth). \nUnder the conditions of incipient motion, the difference is mainly due to the intrinsic length scale \u03b4, \nas the difference in viscous length scale u*\/\u03bd of the two media is relatively small.  At the threshold \ncondition, the boundary layer depth in a typical wind tunnel is of the order of 1 metre or more \n[Greeley and Iversen, 1985], whereas it is of the order of a few centimetres in laboratory flumes \n[Graf, 1971; Yalin, 1972]. The Reynolds number in the atmospheric boundary layer is about 100-\n1000 times higher than that observed in natural rivers, whereas the sub-layer thickness remains \nnearly identical [Metzger and Klewicki, 2001]. We shall show that these differences are one of the \nreasons for the systematically smaller values of the dimensionless shear stress A observed in air \nrelative to water (Figure 1).  \n[[Insert Figure 4 here]] \nThe turbulent velocity (here considered to be the standard deviation of the streamwise \nvelocity, '2u\u03c3 = ) is a strong function of the Reynolds number [DeGraaff and Eaton, 2000; \nMetzger and Klewicki, 2001; Marusic and Kunkel, 2003]. As shown in Figure 4, there is a clear \ndependence of *u\u03c3 \u03c3\n+\n=  on the flow Reynolds number Re\u03c4 across all values of the inner variable \ny+. Marusic and Kunkel [2003] proposed a scaling formulation to account for the full range of \nturbulence intensity \u03c3 +  in relation to y+ and Re\u03c4 , based upon the attached eddy hypothesis and the \nidea that the attached eddy motions in the log region and beyond impose a forcing on the viscous \nbuffer zone and sublayer: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n3\n2\n1\/ 21\/ 2 222\n1 22\n2\n* 0.9 0.5\n1 2 3\n0.16( ) ln1 1 30\nln 501 ( ) 1 ( )\n( )\nln 1 150\nRe\nb\ny y y\nb y b y\nu yB B B y y y\n\u03c4\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n+ +\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n\u2212 \u2212+ + +\n\u23a7 \u23a1 \u23a4\n+ \u2212 \u2264\u23aa \u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6+ +\u23aa\n= = \u23a8 \u239b \u239e\u23aa \u23a1 \u23a4\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2265\u239c \u239f\u23aa \u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\u239d \u23a0\u23a9\n,  (20) \nwhere ( )( )\n1 2\n1 2\nln 50 \/ Re\nln 50 \/ 2000\nB B\nB B\n\u03c4\u03b1\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n, b1 = 0.008, b2 = 0.115, b3 = 1.6, B1 = 2.39, B2 = 1.03, and B3 = \n5.58. For 30 \u2264 y+ \u2264150, interpolation is needed. For simplicity, linear interpolation is used in this \nstudy. In essence, Eq. (20) describes the behaviour of \u03c3 +  shown in Figure 4, i.e. \u03c3 +  increases with \n 13\nRe\u03c4  and peaks at 15y\n+\n\u2248 for a given value of Re\u03c4 .  This maximum value of \u03c3\n+  can also be \nexpressed as a function of Re\u03c4  \n ( )max 0.964 0.87 ln Re\u03c4\u03c3 + = + .       (21) \nThe max\u03c3\n+ ~ Re\u03c4  relationship described by eq. (21) is plotted in Figure 5. Typical value ranges of Re\u03c4  \nfor flumes, natural rivers, wind tunnels and atmospheric boundary layers are also shown. This \nshows that max\u03c3\n+  \u2248 2.5 for open channel flow (assuming d = 1 mm, \u03b4 = 0.015 m and u*t = 0.03 m s-1), \nand max\u03c3\n+\n\u2248 3.5  for air flow in a wind tunnel (assuming d = 1 mm, \u03b4 = 1.2 m and u*t = 0.5 m s-1). The \nformer value of  max\u03c3\n+  is consistent with those commonly used in the hydraulic literature [Cheng \nand Chiew, 1998; Wu and Lin, 2002]. \n[[Insert Figure 5 here]] \nThough eqs. (20) and (21) were developed for smooth surfaces, recent studies show that roughness \nenhances the turbulence and the Reynolds shear stress over most of the boundary layer, and \npromotes isotropy as a result of mixing caused by the wakes generated by the roughness elements \n[Raupach et al. 1996; Krogstad and Antonia, 1999; Tachie et al., 2004]. However, for a sand \nsurface, the increment of turbulence intensity is quite small for the streamwise component [Tachie \nat al., 2004], in contrast with surfaces of higher roughness such as vegetation. Therefore, eqs. (20) \nand (21) are used in our analysis.  \n2.4 Entrainment Probability in a Log-Normal Distribution of Instantaneous Velocities \nThe near-bed turbulence is intense and dominated by gust-like eddy motions with length scales \ndetermined by the characteristic length scale of the roughness, ks or d [Raupach et al. 1991, 1996]. \nThese gusts cause the streamwise velocity to show significant departure from a normal velocity \ndistribution [Morrison et al., 2004], with strong positive skewness near the bed.  It is reasonable to \ndescribe the highly positively skewed distribution for the instantaneous velocity u\u2206 as log-normal \n[Wu and Lin, 2002] (Figure 3). Thus, we assume that if \u03c5\u2206  denotes the logarithm of u\u2206  (i.e. \nln u\u03c5\u2206 \u2206= ), the probability density function ( )f \u2206\u03c5  obeys a normal distribution: \n \n( )2\n2\n1( ) exp\n22\nf\u03c5\n\u03c5\u03c5\n\u03c5 \u03c5\n\u03c5\n\u03c3\u03c0\u03c3\n\u2206 \u2206\n\u2206\n\u23a1 \u23a4\n\u2212\u23a2 \u23a5\n= \u2212\u23a2 \u23a5\u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\n       (22) \nwhere \u03c5\u2206  and \u03c5\u03c3  are the mean and standard deviation of \u03c5\u2206 , respectively. \n 14\nThe probability of entrainment (p) can be expressed as \n ( ) ( ) ( )Prob Prob 1 Probt t tp u u\u2206 \u2206 \u2206= \u2265 = \u2265 = \u2212 \u2212\u221e < <\u03c5 \u03c5 \u03c5 \u03c5    (23) \nwhere lnt tu\u03c5 =  and tu  is the  threshold velocity determined by eq. (10). Physically, p can be \ninterpreted as the fraction of the time over which the instantaneous reference velocity u\u2206 must \nexceed the threshold velocity ut  for detachment to occur. As will be shown later, p emerges as a \ncritical parameter in estimating A.

(35) states that the dimensionless threshold shear stress A is governed by four types of effect: \ni) particle packing geometry, represented by the parameter fp; \nii) the mean velocity profile (first-order flow effects), represented by F1(Re*t); \niii) interaction between the mean velocity profile, turbulent fluctuations and particle removal \nprobability p (second-order flow effects), represented by F2(Re*t, Re\u03c4); and \niv) inter-particle cohesion, represented by G(d). \n 16\nIgnoring the turbulent fluctuations (i.e. \u03c3 + = 0 and therefore F2 = 1) and inter-particle cohesion (i.e. \nCC  \u2192 0 and therefore G(d)\n \u2192 1), we have A \u2245 fpF1.  In this case, F1 can be interpreted as a first-\norder effect of the flow that depends solely on the mean velocity profile u\n+\n\u2206 , which, in turn, \ndepends only on Re*t. For similar reasons, F2 can be viewed as a second-order effect of the flow as \nit depends on the turbulent fluctuation \u03c3 + . If we assume A1 =  fp (see eq. (2)), the main contribution \nof our new expression (35) is to introduce F2, and further specify F1 and G(d). Note that the particle \npacking parameter pf  depends on the drag and lift coefficients CD and CL, which both depend on \nthe choice of reference height y and Re*t. Such dependences could be important in determining A \nand its variations. Certain aspects of the statistical effects of particle packing geometry have been \ndiscussed by Wu and Chou [2003] and Papanicolaou et al. [2002] and further research is needed to \nunderstand the effects of CD and CL in relation to Re*t. \nIn this paper we focus on the effects of turbulent fluctuations on A. The statistical effect of the \npacking condition will not be considered, and pf  is treated as a constant, assuming a fixed packing \ngeometry (Figure 2). Using parameter values defined in Section 2.1, we have pf \u2248 1 to 2. For \nsimplicity, an average value of 1.5 is used throughout. In reality, F1 and F2 may also depend on \nparticle packing conditions, but such effects are also excluded from this paper. \nSeveral expressions have been proposed for the effect of inter-particle cohesion in the past. In \ngeneral, they share a form similar to  \n1\n3( ) 1 ( ) np f\nKG d\ngd\u03c1 \u03c1 \u2212\n= +\n\u2212\n,        (36) \nwhere K1 and n are parameters which need to be calibrated against data. With n = 1 and 1K  = \n6 C C\nw\nC L\nL\u03c0\n, eq. (36) reduces to eq. (34) and stands for the assumption of direct proportionality between \nthe cohesion force FC  and particle size d. Values of the parameters n and 1K  from previous \nresearchers are listed in Table 2. The resulting expressions for G(d) are plotted in Figure 6. This \nshows that inter-particle cohesion becomes negligible when d > 100 \u00b5m (in air). However, cohesion \nis important in determining the upward trend in A with decreasing *Re t , at *Re t < 1 (Figure 1).    \nFrom Table 2 and Figure 6, it can be inferred that it is reasonable (given earlier work) to assume CF  \nproportional to d, and that the most likely range of values for the cohesion coefficient CC  is \nbetween 10-6 and 10-4 N m-1. Though the parameter values listed in Table 2 were all calibrated using \n 17\nthe wind tunnel data of Iversen and White [1982], they are consistent with values of CC  found in \nadhesion studies. For instance, CC  was found to be of the order of 10\n-4 ~10-2  N m-1 in air [Corn, \n1961] and 10-6 ~10-4 N m-1 in water [Zimon, 1982]. Accordingly, the estimates provided in Table 2 \nmay represent the lower bounds of such effects in air. \n[[Insert Figure 6 here]] \nZimon [1982] attributed the different relationships between FC  and particle size d, resulting in a \nrange of values of FC  for a given d, to the probabilistic nature of particle removal. The variance of \nFC  is larger for smaller particles, and may also be larger in air relative to water. For instance, for \nparticle sizes in the range 10 to 20 \u00b5m in air, FC  at a particle removal probability of 50% can be 102 \nto 103 times larger than at a small removal probability (2% to 5%), while for particles smaller than \n10 \u00b5m, the difference can be as large as 105 [see Fig. 1.2 of Zimon, 1982]. Therefore, for small \nparticles, the effect of the cohesion force on the entrainment threshold is not clear, as a large \nuncertainty and high variance in A are expected in both experimental data and theoretical estimates \nfor particle size smaller than 10 \u00b5m.    \n3 Results and Discussion \nIn this section we focus on the first- and second-order flow-related effects, F1 and F2, mainly \nconsidering the range Re*t > 10 where G(d) \u2192 1 (i.e. medium to larger particles). In Section 3.3, we \ncompare our results with experimental data under a variety of different removal probabilities (p) \nand inter-particle cohesion parameter values ( CC ). For all calculations, kinematic viscosity \u03bd  is set \nto 1.47 \u00d7 10-5 m2 s-1 in air and 1.0 \u00d7 10-6 m2 s-1 in water,  particle density \u03c1p to 2650 kg m-3, and fluid \ndensity \u03c1f  to 1 kg m-3 in air and 1000 kg m-3  in water. \n3.1. First-Order Effects - Effects of the Mean Velocity Profile   \nFigure 7 shows contour plots of F1 in sk\n+ ~ y+\u2206\n space (dashed lines), with equations accounting for \nall three flow regimes (eqs. (13), (14) and (15)) in Figure 7a, and for the fully-rough regime only \n(eqs. (16) and (19)) in Figure 7b. In general, these diagrams show that contour lines of F1 are \nparallel to lines sk\n+ = \u03b6 y+\u2206 , where \u03b6  is a constant.  F1 reaches a maximum value of round 0.2 at \u03b6  = \n30.  When \u03b6  < 30, F1 decreases with y+  but increases with the roughness Reynolds number sk + , \nwhereas when \u03b6  > 30, F1 increases with y+  but decreases with sk + .  In the region where \u03b6  < 30, the \nopposite effects of sk\n+ and y+\u2206  on F1 (and therefore on the dimensionless shear stress A) are the main \n 18\nreason that values of A are confined to a rather narrow range in both air and water. The region \nwhere \u03b6  > 30 may have little to do with threshold entrainment. These points should become \nincreasingly clear later in this Section.  \n[[Insert Figure 7 here]] \nThe differences in F1 between Figures 7a (using all three flow regimes) and Figure 7b (using only \nthe fully-rough regime) are most evident when 70sk\n+ \u2264 , where the flow is either smooth or \ntransitionally rough. This is consistent with the findings of Ligrani and Moffat [1986] and Raupach \net al. [1991].  In the smooth flow regime, values of F1 are larger if the flow is treated as smooth \nrather than as fully rough. However, in the transitionally-rough regime, values of F1 are smaller if \nthe flow is treated as transitionally rough rather as fully rough. Therefore, A can be underestimated \nfor small particles but overestimated for medium particles if fully-rough flow is assumed for all \nparticle sizes. This implies that under\/over-estimated values of A can arise as a result of the \nassumption of fully-rough flow, and explains why the experimental Shields' curve (Figure 1) dips in \nthe vicinity of *Re t  ~ 10 to 30. This is most clearly seen in the data for water. Iversen et al. [1987] \nstated there is no indication of such a \u201cdip\u201d in A with *Re t  for their own and others' data in air. This \nmay be because fully rough flow is assumed for all atmospheric boundary layer studies [Jim\u00e9nez, \n2004], including the wind tunnel studies of Iversen and his colleagues.  \nIn terms of threshold entrainment, the ratio between the equivalent sand roughness ks and the \nparticle diameter d, namely \u03b1 = ks\/d, has been discussed by Ling [1995], who indicated that \u03b1 may \nbe interpreted as a measure of the packing density of roughness elements. For threshold conditions, \n\u03b1 = 0.3 to 4 [Ling, 1995, Cheng and Chiew, 1998], implying that *Res tk \u03b1\n+\n= . Commonly used \nvalues of \u03b1 are 1 for uniformly-sized particles and 2 for mixed particle sizes [Wu and Lin, 2002; Wu \nand Chou, 2003]. On the other hand, according to Section 2.1, y d\u03b2= , implying *Re ty \u03b2+\u2206 = , \nwhere \u03b2 lies between 0.5 and 1. We then have sk y\u03b6+ +\u2206= , where \u03b6 \u03b1 \u03b2=  varies approximately \nbetween 0.15 and 4. Larger values of \u03b6  are possible for other types of packing geometry, as the \npacking geometry shown in Figure 2 represents the most exposed position for a sphere resting on a \nsurface. Nevertheless, the contour lines outside of \u03b6  = 0.1 and \u03b6  = 10 may have little relevance for \nthreshold entrainment.  \nSome typical cases of threshold entrainment are shown in Figure 7. They are \u03b6 = 0.5, 1, 2 and 4, \nrespectively (solid lines). The upper bound of particle size common in gravelly fluvial systems is a \ngrain size of about 100 mm [Graf, 1971; Buffington and Montgomery, 1997], whereas it is two \n 19\norders of magnitude smaller in aeolian systems [Bagnold, 1941; Greeley and Iversen, 1985]. Thus, \nthe approximate upper bounds of sk\n+  and y+\u2206  are of the order of 10\n4 for fluvial systems (the lightly-\nshaded area), and approximately 102 for aeolian systems (dark shading), respectively. This shows \nthat, in air, threshold particle motion is likely to occur within the transitionally-rough and smooth \nregimes, rather than in the fully-rough regime. It also shows that, for \u03b6  = 0.5 ~ 4, the values of F1 \nare mainly limited to 0.01 ~ 0.05. Multiplying these values by fp = 1.5 gives values of A as expected \nfor fluvial entrainment [Graf, 1971; Qian and Wan, 1983; Buffington and Montgomery, 1997], but \nslightly larger than those obtained in wind tunnels [Bagnold, 1941; Iversen and White, 1982].  The \nphysical cause of such differences will be investigated further in Section 3.2.  \nIn comparison to uniformly-sized beds, \u03b1  tends to become larger and \u03b2  tends to become smaller \nfor mixed particle beds due to the hiding effect. As has been assumed previously by other \nresearchers, for a given average bed particle size, \u03b6 = 0.5 ~ 1 represents more uniformly-sized beds, \nand a larger \u03b6 represents mixed-sized surfaces [Wu and Lin, 2002; Wu and Chou, 2003].  Figure 7 \nprovides a theoretical explanation for the observation that A for mixed particle sizes is often larger \nthan that for uniformly sized particles [Shields, 1936; Buffington and Montgomery, 1997]. In \naddition, as particle sorting processes cause both \u03b1  and \u03b2  to vary spatially and temporally, they \ninevitably increase the variations of A [Church, 1978; Andrews, 1983]. This explains why the \u201cdip\u201d \nin A disappears in data obtained from mixed-sized river beds.  \n3.2. Second-Order Effects - Effects of Boundary Layer Friction Reynolds Number Re\u03c4 \nThe mean streamwise velocity is not the only factor affecting threshold entrainment. The turbulent \nvelocity is also responsible for the initial dislodgement of sediment. Eq. (33) provides us the means \nto investigate the second-order effects on A due to turbulent fluctuations, through the effects of bulk \nReynolds number and its relation to particle removal probability. In order to understand the general \neffect of turbulent fluctuations on A, and for simplicity, max\u03c3 \u03c3\n+ +\n=  is assumed at the height of the \nmean threshold velocity u\u2206  and is applied to all particle sizes. Eq. (21) is used to relate the \nmaximum turbulent fluctuation max\u03c3\n+  to Re\u03c4 . \n[[Insert Figure 8 here]]  \nFigure 8 shows contour plots of F2  in \u03c3 + ~ p space with F1 set to 0.01, 0.03 and 0.06 (left to right \npanels, respectively).  For all three cases, F2   increases with removal probability p. This shows that, \nfor any given Re\u03c4 , F2 has values smaller than 1 for 0 < p < 0.3 and larger than 1 for 0.3 < p < 1. \nThus, F2 acts to increase the variation of A. If we assume that A = fpF1 (as analyzed in Section 3.1) \n 20\nrepresents the mean, multiplying this quantity by F2 reduces the actual value of A when 0 < p < 0.3 \nbut enlarges it when 0.3 < p < 1.  \nFigure 8 also shows that F2 increases gradually with Re\u03c4 when 0 < p < 0.3, and that this increase is \nmore noticeable for smaller values of F1 than for larger ones. Physically, we would expect this to \nhappen as the larger the turbulent fluctuations, the easier the initial dislodgement of sediment, and \ntherefore, the greater the amount of reduction in A in comparison to its mean. We argue that this \nrepresents another reason for smaller values of A in air than those obtained in water (Figure 1). \nAccording to Figure 5, at the threshold, we may assume that Re\u03c4,w = 500 in flumes and Re\u03c4,a = \n50000 in wind tunnels respectively. Figure 9 shows the estimated values of F2,w , F2,a and their ratio \n\u03b7 = F2,w\/F2,a in relation to p, with F1,w = F1,a = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. The slope of the F2 ~ p \nrelationship is larger in air than that is in water. The two F2 ~ p relationships intersect at \napproximately p = 0.2 ~ 0.3, and F2 in air is about half of its value in water for p = 0.01 ~ 0.05. The \nphenomenon that particle entrainment in air is easier for a smaller removal probability, but \nprogressively harder for a larger removal probability for the same particle size entrained by water \nhas also been found experimentally by Zimon [1982]. However, the explanation provided by Zimon \n[1982] was based upon the probabilistic nature of particle cohesion rather than statistical properties \nof near-wall turbulence, as argued here.  \n[[Insert Figure 9 here]] \nFigure 1 suggests that the difference in A between air and water is actually larger than that predicted \nin Figure 9. This can be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, it is because of different \ndefinitions of particle removal probability at the threshold. Particle removal probabilities at the \nthreshold are never clearly defined under experimental conditions. For instance, those values of A \nlower than 0.04 were obtained by visual observations, in comparison to those obtained using \nbedload transport rates [Buffington and Montgomery, 1997].  Secondly, it is shown in Section 3.1 \nthat the average F1 may be larger in water than in air. In fact, data reported in Figure 1 are mostly \naveraged from different experiments with similar conditions. If we assume F1,w = 2F1,a, fp,w = fp,w \nand Ga(d) = Gw(d) = 1 (applicable for medium to large particles), then Aw would be approximately 3 \nto 4 times larger than Aa at p = 0.02. Such a ratio is close to what is seen in Figure 1.  \nPrevious analyses in hydraulic literature treat the instantaneous pick-up velocity ut and its \nfluctuation \u03c3  as linearly proportionality to the friction velocity u*, i.e. *t tu C u=  and *C u\u03c3\u03c3 = , \nwhere Ct and C\u03c3  are constants with values of approximately 5.5 and 2.0, respectively [Kironoto and \nGraf, 1994; Cheng and Chiew, 1998; Wu and Lin, 2002]. Also, fully-rough turbulent flow is \n 21\nassumed with no allowance for variations in \u03c3. A constant value of \u03c3  fails to predict the \nsystematically lower values of A at large Re*t observed in air, in comparison to those observed in \nopen channel flow. In this study, \u03c3  is allowed to vary with bulk Reynolds number as expressed by \neqs. (20) and (21). Therefore, linking incipient motion to the scaling of turbulent fluctuation \u03c3  is \nthe key contribution of this study as this provides us with a fundamental basis to explain the \nsystematically lower values of A in air than in water.     \nThe smaller values of A for smaller removal probabilities in air (and larger values for larger \nprobabilities) suggest that the variance of threshold velocity is larger in air than it is in water. This \nmay have profound implications for understanding wind erosion and aeolian transport. For instance, \nwind tunnel studies of Shao et al. [1993] found that dust emission is mainly due to saltation \nbombardment, and that dust emission arising from direct aerodynamic entrainment is generally \nsmall. On the other hand, direct field observations of Loosmore and Hunt [2000] found dust \nsuspension can be initialized by turbulent eddies in surface winds well before the sandblasting \nmechanism. Similar observations were made by Roney and White [2004] at Owens Lake. Both \nLoosmore and Hunt [2000] and Roney and White [2004] found that the threshold velocity is smaller \nthan the values estimated by the conventional \u201csaltation thresholds\u201d. From Figure 8 and 9, we \nsuggest that the physical causes of the discrepancy are likely to be due to the different definitions of \nthe threshold removal probability. While Shao et al. [1993] looked at sustained dust emission rates \nat an average p (at approximately 30% to 50%), the latter two studies focused on initial uplifting at \np = 1 ~ 10%. \nFigures 7 and 8 also show that F1 may also affect F2. At smaller p, the effect of Re\u03c4  on A becomes \nless evident when F1 becomes larger. Also, for a given p, F2  increases with F1 . Physically, this \nmeans that when A is larger, there is less reduction in its value by the second-order effect (i.e. when \nmultiplying it by F2). Further experimental studies are needed to investigate these findings. In \nreality, the effects of Re\u03c4  and Re*t are more complex than those presented in Figures 7 and 8. This is \nbecause A, Re\u03c4  and Re*t are all related to threshold velocity u*t , which increases with particle size. \nIn addition, boundary layer height \u03b4 may change with particle size. \nDirect field measurements by Roney and White [2004] at Owens Lake found that the dust \nsuspension threshold varied between 50 and 75% of the values estimated from expressions derived \nfrom wind tunnel experiments. The general model proposed in this study provides the physical \nexplanation for such an observation. Figure 10 shows three possible A ~ Re*t  relationships at \nboundary layer heights of \u03b4 = 0.01 m, 1 m, and 1000 m, respectively, all for p = 0.05. These curves \nwere obtained, for an in-air situation, by substituting eqs. (13) and (20) in eqs. (32) and (33) with \n 22\ny+\u2206  = 0.6Re*t , sk\n+  = Re*t  and CC = 4 \u00d7 10-5 N m-1. The values of A were calculated through iteration \nover u*t for a given particle size d.  This shows that A decreases with \u03b4 and the decrement increases \nwhen Re*t increases, suggesting that, for the same values of Re*t, direct field measurement would \nresult in smaller A in comparison to that in wind tunnel conditions. The physical implication is that, \nfor a given particle size, the average threshold velocity for dislodging particles could be smaller in \nthe atmospheric boundary layer compared with that observed in wind tunnels. Alternatively, a \nparticle that remains still in a wind tunnel may move if it is in an atmospheric boundary layer at the \nsame wind velocity.  \n [[Insert Figure 10 here]] \n3.3. Comparison with Experimental Data \nIn this section, using an approach similar to that employed to derive Figure 10, we shall use eqs. (13) \nand (20) to estimate F1 and F2. A is then calculated through iteration over u*t for a given particle \nsize d.  For all calculations below, we assume y+\u2206  = 0.6Re*t. When comparing predictions with data \nfrom flume experiments, we assume sk\n+  = 3Re*t and \u03b4  = 0.02 m, while sk +  = Re*t  and \u03b4 = 1.2 m for \ncomparing with data from wind tunnels.   \nFigure 11 shows predicted A ~ Re*t relationships for four values of  p in air and in water and three \nvalues of the  cohesion coefficient CC, respectively. For a given fluid, the variation of A in relation \nto Re*t can be explained by differences in the removal probability p when Re*t > 10, by inter-\nparticle cohesion when Re*t < 1, and by both of them when Re*t is in between. The Figure shows \nthat, with a mean value of CC = 10\n-5  ~ 10-4 N m-1, the new expression agrees very well with \nexperimental data for both air and water. The CC  values used in this study are smaller than those \nsuggested previously [Shao and Lu, 2000; Cornelis and Gabriels, 2004], but this is because flow-\nrelated effects play an increasingly important role in the new expression we propose. As discussed \nin Section 3.1 and shown in Figure 7, at smaller sk\n+ and y+\u2206\n (therefore smaller Re*t), F1 (therefore A) \nincreases with Re*t. \n[[Insert Figure 11 here]] \nPrevious researchers have suggested that the particle-to-fluid density ratio ( )p f fR = \u2212\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1  is an \nimportant parameter in determining A [Iversen et al., 1987; Cornelis and Gabriels, 2004]. Our new \nexpression suggests that A also depends on both Re*t and Re\u03c4 , not just on R\u03c1 . Therefore, in terms \nof the effects of flow on A, not only the density but also the flow viscosity is important. For a set of \n 23\nfixed values of viscosity, particle size, and boundary layer height, our new expression suggests that \nA increases when R\u03c1  decreases, as was shown by the wind tunnel data of Iversen and White [1982]. \nHowever, it would no longer be these parameters also vary, according to our generalized model. \nThe experimental simulations of McKenna Neuman [2003; 2004] confirm that A and sediment \ntransport rates depend not only on fluid density (or R\u03c1 ) but also on fluid viscosity. She showed both \nthreshold velocity and mass transport rates of sedimentary particles vary with temperature (Selby et \nal., 1974) and humidity. For instance, it was found that the aerodynamic drag required to entrain \nsand size particles can be 30% lower under cold conditions in high latitude regions, as compared to \nhot deserts and mass transport rates increase while temperature decreases. McKenna Neuman [2004] \nsuggested that temperature-dependent changes in air density and viscosity, and turbulence, are the \nmajor affecting factors. This example shows that caution is needed in applying previous analytical \nand semi-empirical models, and in assuming fixed parameter values, as both models and parameters \nmay only be applicable to certain conditions.  \nBoth theoretical analysis and observation show a certain degree of variation in A.  We therefore \nargue that threshold entrainment should be viewed statistically rather than deterministically, as most \ngoverning processes are probabilistic in nature, including near-surface turbulent flow, packing \ngeometry [Kirchner et al., 1990; Papanicolaou et al., 2002] and inter-particle cohesion. For \ninstance, the most important process \u2013 rough wall turbulent motion \u2013 is fundamentally stochastic. \nThe structure of near-bed turbulent flow is characterized by the spatial and temporal organization of \ncoherent structures [Best, 1992], the links between outer and inner scales, the nature of \nintermittency and the role of anisotropy.  All these turbulence characteristics depend on and interact \nwith the bed condition in a complex manner. In addition, for small values of Re*t, the interparticle \ncohesion forces are also statistical in nature, and the relationships between cohesion forces and \nparticle size are very complex and not well understood (see Section 2.1).  For all these reasons, a \ndeterministic resolution of incipient motion may not be possible. This message is particularly \nrelevant to wind erosion studies where a deterministic view of incipient motion remains common, \nand data on incipient motion are too sparse to separate the variety of physical processes involved. \n4 Conclusions \nIn this study, we have proposed a new, general expression for the dimensionless threshold shear \nstress A which is applicable to both aeolian and fluvial particle entrainment. It allows us to study the \neffects of mean flow, turbulent fluctuation, and inter-particle cohesion on incipient motion \nseparately. It suggests that the dimensionless threshold shear stress A is indeed related to Re*t, as \n 24\nearlier researchers proposed, and should also depend on flow Reynolds number Re\u03c4, which is \nproposed for the first time. Therefore, A depends on the flow condition and it should be a function \nof the viscosity (a flow property) as well as being a function of the density ratio and particle size.  \nWe have shown that the differences in the probability distribution of streamwise velocity \nfluctuations for typical situations in air and water are the main reason for the larger values of A in \nwater than in air (Figure 1). This is because the turbulent fluctuations are not only related to the \nnear-bed flow structure (i.e. Re*t,), as expected, but also depend on the bulk flow characteristics (i.e. \nRe\u03c4).  As velocity variance increases with the bulk flow Reynolds number Re\u03c4 , and typical values \nof  Re\u03c4   in air are several orders larger than those in water under the conditions of incipient motion, \nso the values of A are smaller in air than in water. The upturn of A for small Re*t is partly due to the \nflow conditions and partly due to inter-particle cohesion. Therefore, incorporating descriptions of \nthe flow condition into threshold entrainment is indispensable for all particle sizes. \nAt large Re*t, the narrow range of values of A in relation to *Re t  results from the opposite effects of \nthe roughness Reynolds number sk\n+  and the dimensionless reference height y+\u2206 , both of which are \nproportional to the particle Reynolds number *Re t . Although the mean values of A may be within a \nnarrow range, certain systematic variations exist. These variations are due to differences in particle \npacking density, which is incorporated in the first-order effect F1; and to the different removal \nprobability (p) used in different experiments, and the bulk Reynolds number, which are \nincorporated in the second-order effect F2. In reality, these effects are likely to act interactively on A \nand are reflected in a combined but rather random manner in experimental studies.  \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nHL is grateful to Professor Herbert Huppert at The Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of \nCambridge, for his kind support.
