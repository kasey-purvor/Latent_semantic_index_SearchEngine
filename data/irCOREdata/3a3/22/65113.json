The present study assessed the effect of articulatory \nsuppression (which suppresses private and inner speech) on Tower of London performance in \n7- to 10-year-olds. Experiment 1 (N = 30) showed no effect of articulatory suppression on \nperformance with the standard Tower of London procedure; we interpret this in terms of a \nlack of planning in our sample. Experiment 2 (N = 30) used a modified procedure in which \nparticipants were forced to plan ahead. Performance in the articulatory suppression condition \nwas lower than in the nonverbal control condition, consistent with a role for self-directed \n(private and inner) speech in planning. On problems of intermediate difficulty, participants \nproducing more private speech in the nonverbal control condition showed greater \nsusceptibility to interference from articulatory suppression than their peers, suggesting that \narticulatory suppression interfered with performance by blocking self-directed (private and \ninner) speech. \nKeywords: Tower of London; Tower of Hanoi; children; dual task paradigm. \n3 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThe Roles of Private Speech and Inner Speech in Planning in Middle Childhood: Evidence \nfrom a Dual Task Paradigm \nVygotsky (1934\/1987) saw higher mental functions such as flexible goal-directed \nthought as being founded upon the experience of participating in dialogue around joint \nactivity. The ability to regulate one\u2019s own thought and behavior is seen as emerging from the \nexperience of taking part in interactions in which adult and child use speech to direct each \nothers\u2019 thought and behavior. When children first use speech to direct their own thought and \nbehavior, they are said to be producing private speech. Private speech describes utterances \nspoken aloud that appear to serve a self-regulatory function rather than a communicative \nfunction: They are self-directed, and often take the form of self-guiding comments. Private \nspeech is mainly found in preschoolers, but can appear in middle childhood and adulthood, \nwhen it is likely to take the form of more covert muttering and whispering (see Winsler, \n2009). It is thought that this shift towards covertness reflects the gradual internalization of \nprivate speech to form inner speech, or silent verbal thought (Vygotsky, 1934\/1987). Private \nspeech and inner speech together are hereafter referred to as self-directed speech (Figure 1). \nSelf-directed speech has been implicated in the performance of problem-solving tasks, \nsome spatial working memory tasks, and executive functions, in studies which will be \ndescribed below. Some of this evidence comes from studies relating private speech \nproduction to task performance. A cognitive task is thought to be reliant on self-directed \nspeech if private speech production predicts either concurrent or future performance in \nchildren. For example, Winsler, Diaz, and Montero (1997) had preschoolers perform a \nselective attention task, each trial of which required them to determine which of two \nperceptual dimensions (shape or color) was shared by two pictures, and then to select, from a \ngroup of alternatives, the answer card that represented the shared dimension. After receiving \nguidance from an experimenter, children were more likely to succeed if they used private \n4 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nspeech than if they were silent. Similarly, Behrend, Rosengren, and Perlmutter (1989, 1992) \nfound that preschoolers\u2019 private speech production during spatial problem-solving tasks \ncorrelated with both their concurrent and future performance of those tasks. \nHowever, there are a number of problems with looking at private speech-performance \nrelations to speak to whether or not tasks are reliant on self-directed speech. One is that \nprivate speech production shows a positive or curvilinear relation with task difficulty, and if \nthis is not taken into account private speech-performance relations can be missed (see \nFernyhough & Fradley, 2005; Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985). Even when they are found, the \ndifficulty with a non-experimental design is that it leaves open the question of whether \nprivate speech is useful for or merely happens to accompany successful cognitive \nperformance. \n An approach that avoids these problems is to use the dual task paradigm to assess the \neffect of preventing self-directed speech. The experimental design allows researchers to \ninvestigate whether or not self-directed speech has a causal role in cognitive performance. \nResearchers can prevent the use of self-directed speech by asking participants to engage in an \narticulatory suppression task concurrently with the primary task on which performance is \nbeing assessed. Articulatory suppression can take the form of repeating a word, repeating a \nwell-learned sequence of words like the months of the year, or shadowing prose heard while \ncompleting the primary task. (Articulatory suppression is usually referred to as suppressing \n\u201cinner speech,\u201d but of course it interferes with private speech as well.) If performance of the \nprimary task relies on self-directed speech, it should be significantly impaired by articulatory \nsuppression. The performance of several cognitive tasks is vulnerable to articulatory \nsuppression in children and adults, including tasks tapping spatial working memory (Ang & \nLee, 2008), and task-switching (Whitehouse, Maybery, & Durkin, 2006) in children, and \n5 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \ntasks tapping spatial reasoning (Kim, 2002), cognitive flexibility (Baldo et al., 2005) and \ntask-switching performance (Baddeley, Chincotta, & Adlam, 2001) in adults. \nIn many of these studies, performance in the articulatory suppression condition was \ncompared to performance in a control condition with no secondary task. However, as \nEmerson and Miyake (2003) point out, the effect of articulatory suppression in some cases \nmight be wholly attributed to the general demands of performing two tasks simultaneously. \nTo guard against this possibility, a nonverbal secondary task, such as foot-tapping, can be \nincluded in the control condition. If the articulatory suppression task is to say a b c once \nevery metronome beat, the control task would be to tap one\u2019s foot once every metronome \nbeat. If the articulatory suppression task is verbal shadowing, an appropriate control condition \ncould involve shadowing a rhythm by foot-tapping. Foot-tapping is thought to be a good \ncontrol task because, like articulatory suppression, it incorporates a motor component, and it \ninvolves an attentional component that is similar to that of articulatory suppression (Robbins \net al., 1996). Its suitability was tested by Emerson and Miyake (2003), who found that, on a \nvisual task assumed to be completely nonverbal (the Identical Pictures Test), articulatory \nsuppression and foot-tapping affected adults\u2019 performance equally. Foot-tapping is now \nincluded in the control conditions of studies assessing the effect of articulatory suppression \non task-switching. They show that articulatory suppression impairs performance to a greater \nextent than does foot-tapping (e.g., Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Liefooghe, Vandierendonck, \nMuyllaert, Verbruggen, & Vanneste, 2005; Saeki, Saito, & Kawaguchi, 2006), suggesting \nthat task-switching relies on self-directed speech. Other research has revealed effects of \narticulatory suppression on spatial reorientation (that is, the ability to integrate geometric and \nlandmark cues in order to reorient oneself in space after disorientation; Hermer-Vasquez, \nSpelke, & Katsnelson, 1999) and face learning (Nakabayashi & Burton, 2008) compared to \ntapping control conditions. \n6 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nOne function that has received surprisingly little attention in research on self-directed \nspeech is that of planning. Planning is surely one of the most common human mental \nactivities, and is at the very core of goal-directed behavior (Cohen, 1996). According to \nVygotskian theory, self-directed speech has a special role in planning. Vygotsky\u2019s own \nstudies suggested that one of the most significant developments of private speech in the \npreschool years is that it takes on a planning function. Upon discovering the planning \nfunction of speech, he argues, \u201c[children\u2019s] psychological field changes radically. A view of \nthe future is now an integral part of their approaches to their surroundings\u201d (Vygotsky, 1930-\n1935\/1978, p. 29). He argues that speech (or \u201cverbal signs\u201d) is helpful in acting as a barrier \nbetween impulsive and actual behavior. Thus, \u201cthe inclusion of signs ... creates the conditions \nfor the development of a single system that includes effective elements of the past, present, \nand future. This emerging psychological system in the child now encompasses two new \nfunctions: intentions and symbolic representations of purposeful action\u201d (pp. 36-37). \nOn this view, self-directed speech should be particularly useful for the performance of \ntasks requiring planning in childhood. The gold standard planning tasks are the Tower of \nHanoi, and its more commonly used adaptation, the Tower of London (Shallice, 1982). The \nTower of London consists of three different-colored disks, arranged on three pegs that can \nhold one, two, and three disks respectively (Figure 2). Participants attempt to transform one \nconfiguration into another by moving one disk at a time. Planning is required because \nparticipants must complete the task in the smallest number of moves possible.  \nTo our knowledge, there are in the extant literature four studies with results that speak \ndirectly to whether or not self-directed speech is involved in Tower of London or Tower of \nHanoi performance; they all relate to the Tower of London. The first to be considered here is \na study of the private speech of 5- and 6-year-olds while completing the Tower of London \n(Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005). The authors found that children producing more private \n7 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nspeech completed the task more quickly and accurately than children who produced less. This \nwas partially replicated by Al-Namlah, Fernyhough, and Meins (2006), who found a negative \nassociation between private speech production and the time taken to complete Tower of \nLondon problems in their sample of 4- to 8-year-olds. These findings are consistent with the \nidea that successful planning requires self-directed speech in early childhood. \nWallace, Silvers, Martin, and Kenworthy (2009) reported the effect of articulatory \nsuppression on Tower of London performance in a group of typically developing adolescents \n(12- to 19-year-olds) \u2013 the control group in a study of \u201cinner speech\u201d in autism. The \nparticipants completed Tower of London problems, alternately with and without articulatory \nsuppression. Under articulatory suppression, the typically developing participants took \nsignificantly more moves to complete the problems than they did without articulatory \nsuppression. The authors interpreted the results to mean that inner speech supported \nperformance in their sample of typically developing adolescents. Because there was no \ncontrol secondary task, however, the results are open to the alternative interpretation \nmentioned above: that the effect of articulatory suppression could be wholly attributed to \ngeneral dual task effects. \nThe fourth study (Phillips, Wynn, Gilhooly, Della Sala, & Logie, 1999) also did not \ninclude a secondary task in the control condition, but this was less problematic for our \npurposes given the pattern of results. The participants, young adults aged 18 to 25 years, \ncompleted Ward and Allport\u2019s (1997) five-disk Tower of London with and without \narticulatory suppression. Articulatory suppression was not detrimental to performance \naccuracy (defined in terms of the number of excess moves) for problems of any level of \ndifficulty. The effect of articulatory suppression was only to speed up performance, although \nits effect in reducing planning times (time to first move) mainly occurred for the most \n8 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \ndifficult problems, which were too complex to be planned in full even with no secondary task \n(Phillips, Wynn, McPherson, & Gilhooly, 2001).  \nThus there are three studies (Al-Namlah et al., 2006; Fernyhough and Fradley, 2005; \nWallace et al., 2009) suggesting a role for self-directed speech in planning, but none used \ndual task methodology with a dual task control condition. The other study (Phillips et al., \n1999) is perhaps the most conclusive of these four investigations in terms of our question of \nwhether self-directed speech is important for planning, suggesting it is not. The lack of \narticulatory suppression interference on planning accuracy in adults does not preclude the \npossibility of finding an effect earlier in development, however. We predicted that planning \nwould be largely dependent on self-directed speech in middle childhood. To test this \nhypothesis was the principal aim of the present study. Specifically, we predicted that Tower \nof London performance would be impaired under articulatory suppression relative to a \ncontrol condition with a foot-tapping task. \nThe second hypothesis was that the detrimental effect of articulatory suppression on \nperformance would be larger for children whose performance relied on self-directed speech \nto a greater extent, as evidenced by more frequent private speech production in the tapping \ncondition. In this way we hoped to provide further evidence that articulatory suppression has \nits detrimental effect on primary task performance by interfering with self-directed speech, \nrather than through general dual task demands. We expected to find a relation between \nprivate speech production and interference by articulatory suppression only for problems for \nwhich private speech was useful. Like Fernyhough and Fradley (2005), who looked at private \nspeech-performance relations, we expected the utility of private speech to be moderated by \ntask difficulty. For the easiest problems, we expected speech to be mainly fully internalized, \nmeaning that private speech production would be a good indicator of the extent to which \nperformance was reliant on self-directed speech for intermediate and difficult problems only. \n9 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nFor the most difficult problems, beyond the children\u2019s ability range, private speech was \npredicted to be ineffective for improving performance in the control condition. We therefore \npredicted a positive relation between private speech production and interference by \narticulatory suppression only for problems of intermediate difficulty. Inner speech, on the \nother hand, was predicted to be useful for the easiest problems. As articulatory suppression \ninterferes with both private speech and inner speech, we expected articulatory suppression to \nbe detrimental to performance on the easiest problems as well as those of intermediate \ndifficulty. \nExperiment 1 \nIn Experiment 1, we sought to test the two hypotheses described above \u2013 that \nplanning would be disrupted by articulatory suppression in middle childhood, and that the \namount of private speech produced in the foot-tapping condition would correlate positively \nwith articulatory suppression interference for problems of intermediate difficulty. \nMethod \nParticipants. The participants were 30 typically developing children (13 boys), \nrecruited from and tested in mainstream state schools in the North-East of England. The mean \nage of the children was 9 years; 1 month (SD 0;9, range 7;11 \u2013 10;5). No participant had a \nlearning or neurological disorder according to teacher report. All had active written parental \nconsent to participate, and were free to withdraw at any time. \nMaterials. The Tower of London consisted of two wooden frames, each with three \ncolored disks (Figure 2). A camcorder recorded the testing sessions. A program on a laptop \ncomputer, connected to a foot pedal, was used for the tapping task: It produced sounds to \nallow participants to monitor their foot-tapping performance (see below). The pedal was \nmounted on a wooden platform, which incorporated an adjustable foot rest. \n10 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThere were two sets of 13 Tower of London problems \u2013 10 experimental problems \nplus 3 practice problems \u2013 one set for each condition. The problem sets were identical except \nthat the colors of the disks were swapped around; that is, the sets were isoforms of each other. \nThe practice trials were 1-, 2-, and 3-move problems, none of which were duplicated in the \nexperimental problem set. The experimental problem set consisted of two 2-move problems, \nthree 3-move problems, three 4-move problems and two 5-move problems. No problem \nappeared in the same problem set twice. Although the minimum number of moves is not the \nonly aspect of Tower of London problems that influences task difficulty (Kaller, Unterrainer, \nRahm, & Halsband, 2004), it is hereafter used as a rough guide to the difficulty level of the \nproblems. \nProcedure. The participants completed the two dual task conditions in a single \nsession. The order of conditions was counterbalanced so that the two groups \u2013 those receiving \nthe tapping condition first and those receiving the articulatory suppression condition first \u2013 \ndid not differ in gender composition or chronological age.  \nThe participants were told that their job was to make the two puzzles look the same, \nby moving one disk at a time, and that they would \u201cneed to plan ahead\u201d to do so in the \nminimum number of moves. The problems were presented in order of increasing difficulty, \nand the participants were told the number of moves they should use to solve each problem. \nParticipants received a sticker for each problem they solved in the minimum number of \nmoves and another for each problem that was completed with no secondary task errors. \nThe secondary tasks, repeating the word Monday (articulatory suppression) and foot-\ntapping (control), were demonstrated by the experimenter, who performed them at a rate of \none response per second. Participants then practised the secondary tasks with the Tower of \nLondon practice trials. \n11 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nIn the tapping condition, each tap was accompanied by a beep. The beeping was \nintended to serve as an aural reminder of the task. If there was an error, defined as a gap \nbetween taps of 2.0 seconds \u2013 equal to missing one tap \u2013 there was a warning sound, which \nceased when tapping was recommenced.  \nThe aural reminder of the articulatory suppression task was the experimenter\u2019s \narticulation of Monday in time with that of the participants. If a participant made an error, \ndefined as a missed Monday, the experimenter reminded her to recommence by uttering her \nname. \nScoring and analysis. Two commonly-used measures of Tower of London \nperformance are the number of excess moves (i.e., the difference between the number of \nmoves taken to solve a problem and the minimum number of moves), and whether or not a \nproblem was solved in the minimum number of moves (Berg & Byrd, 2002). The latter was \nmore compatible with the instructions given to participants (which were designed to focus \ntheir attention on the need for careful planning) and this measure had the advantage of \nrendering the results of Experiments 1 and 2 comparable. The primary outcome measure for \neach trial was therefore whether or not it had been solved in the minimum number of moves. \nA trial was considered to have ended after the first incorrect move, as incorrect sequences of \nmoves often ended in an impasse and participants were stopped by the experimenter. The \nsecondary performance measure, time taken to complete the problems, was therefore \nmeasured only for correctly-solved problems. The third measure of performance on each trial \nwas whether or not one or more secondary task errors had been made before the end of the \ntrial. \nThe participants\u2019 speech in the tapping condition was coded from the video \nrecordings. Private speech was defined as any speech that did not meet the criteria to be \nregarded as social speech (Winsler, Fernyhough, McClaren, & Way, 2005). Social speech \n12 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nwas defined as any full volume speech intended for communication with the experimenter. \nCommunicative intent was identified where the participant involved the experimenter \n(through physical contact, gaze direction, etc.), during or within two seconds of an utterance \n(Winsler et al., 2005). The frequency of social speech was negligible so it is not reported. \nPrivate speech is traditionally coded according to Berk (1986) as Level 1 (task-\nirrelevant private speech), Level 2 (task-relevant externalized private speech), or Level 3 \n(presumably task-relevant external manifestations of inner speech, including inaudible \nmuttering and whispering, and silent, verbal lip movements). However, the frequency of task-\nirrelevant private speech was negligible, and the internalization level of private speech was \nnot relevant to our hypothesis. Therefore each trial was coded as containing or not containing \ntask-relevant private speech (Levels 2 and 3 together). A trial-based metric was chosen as \nrate-based metrics (such as utterances per minute) risk confounding general verbosity with \nthe degree of dependence on private speech (Winsler et al., 1997), especially where it is not \npossible to control for verbosity by partialing out social speech production (see Winsler et al., \n2005). A second researcher independently coded 20% (six) of the recordings. Inter-rater \nagreement for the presence of private speech was \u03ba = .87. \nThe frequency of private speech was a function of the percentage of trials containing \nprivate speech at each difficulty level. In order that the results would be directly comparable \nto those of Experiment 2, which had an equal number of problems of each level of difficulty, \nwe applied a weighting to the problems of Experiment 1. Private speech rates were weighted \nso that each difficulty level was represented equally. For example, without weighting, a child \nproducing private speech during the performance of neither 2-move problem, all three 3-\nmove problems, all three 4-move problems and neither 5-move problem would score 60%. \nWith weighting, the rate would be the mean of 0%, 100%, 100% and 0%, which is 50%. \n13 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThe principal measure of task performance in each condition was the percentage of \nproblems solved in the minimum number of moves, with the weighting system applied. Other \nmeasures of task performance were the time taken to complete correctly-performed problems, \nand the percentage of problems containing a secondary task error. The same weighting \nsystem applied to all performance variables. For response times, the mean time was found for \ncorrectly-performed 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-move problems separately, and then the grand mean was \ntaken. The weighting system did not change the results of any statistical test: It simply made \nthe accuracy of Tower of London performance more comparable across experiments. \nParametric statistics were used throughout. Although one of the variables (the \nproportion of problems containing a secondary task error) was positively skewed, parametric \nstatistics were robust because the distribution was the same in each condition, the variances \nwere similar, and there were more than 20 degrees of freedom (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). \nDifficulty level was included in analyses of performance accuracy, as the effect of \narticulatory suppression was expected to vary with this. Time taken to complete correctly-\nperformed trials and the percentage of trials with a secondary task error were analyzed with 2 \n 2 (Condition [articulatory suppression, tapping]  Condition Order [articulatory \nsuppression first, tapping first]) repeated measures ANOVAs. \nResults and Discussion \nIn the control condition, the mean (SD) percentage of trials with private speech for 2-, \n3-, 4-, and 5-move problems was 5 (15), 9 (15), 6 (13), and 10 (24), respectively. The mean  \nproportion of all trials with private speech in the control condition was 7% (SD 11, range 0 to \n50). \nPerformance in terms of the percentage of problems solved correctly is shown in \nFigure 3. A 2  2  4 (Condition [articulatory suppression, tapping]  Condition Order \n[articulatory suppression first, tapping first]  Difficulty Level [2-, 3-, 4-, 5-moves]) repeated \n14 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nmeasures ANOVA was used to predict the percentage of problems solved correctly. There \nwas a main effect of difficulty level, F(3, 84) = 75.60, p < .001. Within-subjects contrasts \nrevealed a linear trend, F(1, 29) = 184.96, p < .001, with performance decreasing with \nincreasing difficulty level. There was neither a main effect of condition, F < 1, nor a \nCondition  Difficulty Level interaction, F < 1. No other effects approached significance (all \nps > .25). \nIn terms of the time taken to complete correctly-performed trials, there were no \neffects of condition, F < 1, or condition order, F < 1, and there was no Condition  Condition \nOrder interaction, F(1, 28) = 1.50, p = .23. Thus, there was no difference in the time taken to \ncomplete correctly-performed trials in the articulatory suppression condition, M  = 8.7 s, SD \n= 2.3, and compared with the control condition, M = 8.3 s, SD = 3.4.  \nIn terms of the percentage of trials with a secondary task error, there was no main \neffect of condition order, F(1, 28) = 1.06, p = .31. There was a marginally significant main \neffect of condition, F(1, 28) = 4.32, p = .05, with more errors in the articulatory suppression \ncondition, M = 11.9%, SD = 16.1, than in the control condition, M = 5.6%, SD = 9.7. \nHowever, this was modified by a Condition  Condition Order interaction, F(1, 28) = 6.87, p \n= .01. Follow-up t-tests showed that, amongst those receiving articulatory suppression first, \nthe secondary task error rate was higher in the articulatory suppression condition, M = 17.8%, \nSD = 19.6, than in the tapping condition, M = 3.3%, SD = 6.9, t(14) = 2.79, p = .01. Among \nparticipants receiving the tapping condition first, there was no difference in secondary task \nerror rate between the articulatory suppression condition, M = 6.1%, SD = 9.0, and the \ntapping condition, M = 7.8%, SD = 11.8, t(14) = 0.50, p = .62. \nIn sum, there were more secondary task errors in the articulatory suppression \ncondition than in the tapping condition, but this was limited to participants receiving the \narticulatory suppression condition first. Articulatory suppression had no effect on Tower of \n15 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nLondon performance, suggesting the latter was not dependent on self-directed speech. \nTherefore the second hypothesis was not tested.  \nIn response to these results, the video recordings were re-examined. We recorded the \ntime taken to initiate the first move for each trial \u2013 the planning time (see Berg & Byrd, 2002) \n\u2013 in the control condition. We chose the control condition rather than the articulatory \nsuppression condition because the former is the condition in which planning is theoretically \nuninhibited. One participant\u2019s video recording was lost after a technical problem with the \ncamcorder, so the results on planning times relate to 29 participants. \nThis analysis revealed planning times to be very short, M = 3.1 s, SD = 1.1. In \naddition, planning times did not increase with the difficulty level of the problems: Means in \nseconds (with standard deviations in parentheses) for 2- through 5-move problems were 2.7 \n(1.5), 3.5 (1.6), 2.9 (1.5), and 3.4 (2.5) respectively. The lack of relation between planning \ntimes and difficulty level was confirmed by a repeated measures ANOVA: There was no \neffect of difficulty level on planning times, F(3, 84) = 1.90, p = .14, and the within-subjects \ncontrasts indicated no significant linear trend, F(1, 28) = 0.75, p = .39. \nThese planning times are markedly shorter than those in Phillips et al. (1999), which \naveraged around 15 seconds in the control condition (planning times are not reported in \nFernyhough & Fradley, 2005, Al-Namlah et al., 2006, or Wallace et al., 2009). In addition, \nunlike in Phillips et al., planning time did not increase with trial difficulty. From this analysis, \nwe concluded that performance in the present study was not dependent on self-directed \nspeech perhaps because the procedure was not effective in eliciting planning. We therefore \nconducted a second experiment using another Tower of London procedure in which \nparticipants were forced to plan ahead. Instead of asking participants to move the disks to \nmake the configurations match, we asked them to mentally plan the moves, to tell the \nexperimenter the minimum number of moves it would take to make the configurations match, \n16 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nand then to demonstrate the moves they had planned. The original How many moves \nprocedure, in which participants did not have to additionally demonstrate the moves, was \ncreated by Owen et al. (1995) for use with adults, and has been used in several subsequent \nneuroimaging studies (e.g., Baker et al., 1996; Boghi et al., 2006). The predictions were as \nfor Experiment 1.  \nExperiment 2 \nMethod \nParticipants. The participants were 30 typically developing children (16 boys), \nrecruited in the same way as the participants in Experiment 1. No child participated in both \nexperiments. The mean age was 9 years; 4 months (SD 0;9, range 7;10 \u2013 10;8). \nMaterials. All materials were as above, except that in Experiment 2 there were 8 \ninstead of 10 experimental problems per condition. The number of problems was changed so \nthat there could be an equal number of problems of each difficulty level, i.e., two 2-move, \ntwo 3-move, two 4-move, and two 5-move problems. This was to ensure that guessing 3 \nmoves or 4 moves would not be reliably more effective than guessing 2 moves or 5 moves.  \nProcedure. In each condition, the problems were administered in a different pseudo-\nrandomized order. Pilot work indicated that the children would need more than the three \npractice problems provided in Experiment 1, so they completed one practice set of eight \nproblems, before completing the dual task conditions in a second session about a week later. \nThe order of dual task conditions was counterbalanced as before.  \nAs the Tower of London was introduced, the participants were asked \u201cto imagine \nmoving the disks around, one at a time, and tell [the experimenter] how many moves it would \ntake to make [the start state] look like [the end state].\u201d For the experimental problems, \nparticipants were just asked \u201cHow many moves?\u201d for each trial. Unlike in previous studies \nusing this version of the Tower of London (Baker et al., 1996; Boghi et al., 2006; Owen et al., \n17 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \n1995), the participants were asked to demonstrate the moves after telling the experimenter the \nnumber of moves they had planned. \nThe details of the secondary tasks were as above. They were performed only during \nthe planning phase, the period between the start of the trial and the verbal response. Similarly, \nonly the planning phase was coded for private speech. \nScoring and analysis. A Tower of London problem was scored as correct if the \nparticipant both named and correctly demonstrated the minimum number of moves required \nto make the start and end states match. The response time \u2013 the time from presentation of a \nproblem to the verbal numerical response \u2013 was also recorded. As in Experiment 1, trials \nwere coded dichotomously on the basis of whether or not a secondary task error had been \nmade.  \nPrivate speech was coded as in Experiment 1. Inter-rater reliability was  \u03ba = .90. \nVideo recordings were unavailable for one participant because of a technical problem with \nthe camcorder, so the response time and private speech data relate to 29 participants. \nNo weighting system was used in Experiment 2 as there was an equal number of \nproblems at each level of difficulty. As in Experiment 1, the principal measure of task \nperformance was the percentage of problems solved in the minimum number of moves. Other \nmeasures of performance were response times, and the percentage of problems containing a \nsecondary task error. Analyses were performed as in Experiment 1.  \nResults and Discussion  \nAs for Experiment 1, a 2  2  4 (Condition [articulatory suppression, tapping]  \nCondition Order [articulatory suppression first, tapping first]  Difficulty Level [2-, 3-, 4-, 5-\nmoves]) repeated measures ANOVA was used to predict the percentage of problems solved \ncorrectly. There was a main effect of condition, F(1, 29) = 10.55, p = .003; performance was \nimpaired in the articulatory suppression condition compared to the control condition (Figure \n18 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \n3). There was a main effect of difficulty level, F(3, 87) = 86.80, p < .001, but no Condition  \nDifficulty Level interaction, F < 1, with articulatory suppression affecting performance at all \ndifficulty levels equally. No other effects approached significance (ps > .15). \nResponse times and secondary task error rates were analyzed using 2  2 (Condition \n[articulatory suppression, tapping]  Condition Order [articulatory suppression first, tapping \nfirst]) repeated measures ANOVAs.  In terms of response times, there was no effect of \ncondition, F(1, 27) = 1.31, p = .26. Thus, the response times in the articulatory suppression \ncondition, M = 13.4 s, SD = 4.5, did not differ from those in the tapping condition, M = 14.3 \ns, SD = 3.8. There was no main effect of condition order, F < 1, but the Condition  \nCondition Order interaction approached significance, F (1, 27) = 3.52, p = .07. Follow-up t-\ntests showed that, among participants receiving the articulatory suppression condition first, \nthere was no difference in response times between the articulatory suppression condition, M = \n14.1 s, SD = 5.4, and the tapping condition, M = 13.4 s, SD = 3.1, whereas, among those \nreceiving the tapping condition first, response times were shorter in the articulatory \nsuppression condition, M = 12.6 s, SD = 3.5, than in the tapping condition, M = 15.3 s, SD = \n4.3, t(13) = 2.63, p = .02. The participants who received the tapping condition first thus \nexhibited an improvement in their response times, unlike those receiving the articulatory \nsuppression condition first. \nIn terms of the percentage of trials with a secondary task error, there was a main \neffect of condition, F(1, 28) = 7.76, p = .01, with more articulatory suppression errors, M = \n19.6%, SD = 17.3, than tapping errors, M = 8.8%, SD = 12.8, as in Experiment 1. There was a \nmarginally significant main effect of condition order, F(1, 28) = 3.92, p = .06, which was not \nmodified by a Condition  Condition Order interaction, F < 1. The proportion of trials with \nsecondary task errors was lower among those receiving articulatory suppression first than \namong those receiving tapping first in both the articulatory suppression condition, M = \n19 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \n14.1%, SD = 16.3, vs. M = 25.0%, SD = 17.0, and the tapping condition, M = 6.6%, SD = \n12.4 vs. M = 10.9%, SD = 13.3. Perhaps receiving the articulatory suppression condition first \nbiased the participants toward allocating more attentional resources to the secondary task. \nConsidering the deleterious effect of articulatory suppression on primary task performance, \nand the fact that participants were rewarded equally for perfect articulatory suppression \nperformance and perfect Tower of London performance (with one sticker for each), this \nwould be the optimum strategy in the articulatory suppression condition, and it was \npresumably carried over to the tapping condition by participants receiving this second. \nOverall, though, secondary task performance was poorer in the articulatory suppression \ncondition than the tapping condition. \nIn sum, Tower of London performance appeared to be dependent on self-directed \nspeech in Experiment 2. Tower of London performance and secondary task performance \nwere lower in the articulatory suppression condition than in the control condition. The fact \nthat the effect of articulatory suppression on primary task performance did not vary by \ndifficulty level is discussed below. \nTo find out whether the effect of condition on Tower of London performance in \nExperiment 2 was significantly different from that in Experiment 1, we combined the results \ninto a single 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 (Experiment [Experiment 1, Experiment 2] \u00d7 Condition [articulatory \nsuppression, tapping]  Difficulty Level [2-, 3-, 4-, 5-moves]) ANOVA predicting the \npercentage of problems solved correctly. There was a main effect of condition, F(1, 58) = \n6.49, p = .01, which was modified by a Condition  Experiment interaction, F(1, 58) = 5.64, \np = .02. Results shown above indicate this was due to an effect of dual task condition in \nExperiment 2 but not in Experiment 1. There was a main effect of difficulty level, F(3, 174) =  \n159.76, p <  .001; no other effects approached significance (defined as p < .10).  \n20 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThe absence of a main effect of Experiment in the above ANOVA was perhaps \nsurprising, given that little planning took place in Experiment 1 \u2013 a factor we would expect to \nresult in lower success rates in Experiment 1 than Experiment 2. Comparison of the control \nconditions confirmed that success rates on the two Tower of London versions did not differ: \nThe mean proportion of problems solved correctly in the control condition of Experiment 1 \nwas 66.6% (SD = 13.9), and in Experiment 2 it was 67.1% (SD = 18.4), t(58) = 0.36, p = .72. \nPossible explanations of the equal success rates in the two experiments are considered in the \nGeneral Discussion. \nNext, our attention turned to the private speech results of Experiment 2\u2019s control \ncondition: Would there be a correlation between articulatory suppression interference and \nprivate speech production for problems of intermediate difficulty? Private speech was \nproduced during 47% of the trials on average (SD 39, range 0 to 100). The mean (SD) \npercentages of trials with private speech for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-move problems were 34 (42), 41 \n(44), 50 (46), and 60 (45), respectively. The percentage of trials with private speech appeared \nto increase with difficulty level, but note that trial duration also increased with difficulty level \n(data not shown). Our measure of articulatory suppression interference was the percentage of \ntrials correct in the articulatory suppression condition minus the percentage of trials correct in \nthe control condition. Thus, a positive figure indicated poorer performance in the articulatory \nsuppression condition than in the control condition. We used this difference score in line with \nprevious research on individual differences in articulatory suppression interference (Lidstone, \nFernyhough, Meins, & Whitehouse, 2009), but we also calculated a measure of articulatory \nsuppression interference based on residual scores, by partialing the control condition \nperformance from the articulatory suppression condition performance. As the correlations \nusing these residual scores produced exactly the same pattern as those using the difference \nscores, only the latter are shown below. \n21 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThe correlations between articulatory suppression interference and the proportion of \ntrials with private speech in the control condition for 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-move problems (with 29 \ndegrees of freedom) were .07, -.10, .47, and .21, respectively (Pearson\u2019s correlation \ncoefficients). The largest of these was statistically significant (p = .01). As expected, then, the \nrelation between private speech production and interference by articulatory suppression was \nfound for problems of intermediate difficulty only. These results indicate that children who \nproduced more private speech on 4-move problems experienced greater interference from \narticulatory suppression on these problems, and therefore that articulatory suppression has its \ndetrimental effect on Tower of London performance by suppressing self-directed speech. \nGeneral Discussion \nThe principal aim of the study was to investigate, using the dual task paradigm, \nwhether or not planning relies on self-directed speech in middle childhood. Experiment 1 \nshowed no effect of articulatory suppression on performance of the standard Tower of \nLondon. However, this was interpreted as being due to a lack of planning in our sample. \nExperiment 2 showed that, when participants were forced to plan ahead, suppressing self-\ndirected speech was detrimental to Tower of London performance. The results of Experiment \n2 support those of Fernyhough and Fradley (2005), Al-Namlah et al. (2006), and Wallace et \nal. (2009) in suggesting that planning is achieved with the aid of self-directed speech. These \nfindings are consistent with Vygotsky\u2019s (1930-1935\/1978; 1934\/1987) ideas on the role of \nspeech in cognition, and suggest planning can be considered to be largely verbally mediated \nin middle childhood. The results are consistent with the view that cognition undergoes a \ndomain-general shift towards verbal mediation during early childhood (Al-Namlah et al., \n2006; Fernyhough, 2008). \nThe reason for the lack of planning in Experiment 1 is unknown. There were \ninstructions to plan ahead, and the participants were told how many moves each problem \n22 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nshould take and were only rewarded (with stickers) if they solved the problems in the \nspecified number of moves, emphasizing that reaching the goal state in more moves than \nnecessary did not constitute a correct answer. In retrospect, our intuition is that starting each \nsession with 2- and 3-move problems might have contributed to the lack of planning for two \nreasons. First, the participants perhaps did not get into the habit of planning as the first five \nproblems (of 2 and 3 moves) could quite easily be solved correctly with little advance \nplanning. Second, by the time the children reached the more difficult problems, they perhaps \nfelt comfortable making mistakes, having achieved a good success rate in the earlier part of \nthe session.  \nIn light of the fact that little planning took place in Experiment 1, it is perhaps \nsurprising that control condition performance equalled that of Experiment 2\u2019s control \ncondition.\n1\n We propose that this can be explained in terms of the fact that, in Experiment 1, \nthe problem-solving activity of the participants was in effect carefully \u201cscaffolded,\u201d in that \nthe problems were presented in exact order of increasing difficulty. In terms of performance \nlevels, the helpful effect of this scaffolding probably counteracted the detrimental effect of \nreducing planning. \nWe have characterized the procedure used in Experiment 2 as requiring more \nplanning than that used in Experiment 1, but the procedure of Experiment 2 undoubtedly \ndrew more heavily on working memory as well. In our view, however, any concept of \nplanning that requires no memory is of limited value. Memory is surely vital to planning, \nbecause tentative and incomplete plans need to be held in mind while they are evaluated and \nrevised (Cohen, 1996). On this view, to conceptualize the version of the Tower of London \nused in Experiment 2 as requiring a greater degree of planning is appropriate. In any case, the \nfinding that children\u2019s performance of this seemingly spatial task was dependent on self-\ndirected speech still stands. \n23 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nThe fact that the Tower of London procedure which elicited little planning was \nequally affected by articulatory suppression and foot-tapping is reminiscent of a finding from \na previous study relating to the general dual task demands of articulatory suppression and \nfoot-tapping in adults (Emerson & Miyake, 2003). As mentioned in the Introduction, these \nauthors reported that, on a visual task assumed to be nonverbal, articulatory suppression and \nfoot-tapping affected adults\u2019 performance equally. The present study\u2019s Experiment 1 results, \nindicating equal effects of the two secondary tasks, could be interpreted as preliminary \nevidence that the secondary tasks exert equivalent dual task demands also in children, and \nthat any deleterious effect of articulatory suppression can be attributed to its effect of \nsuppressing self-directed speech. However, the meaning of the trend towards more secondary \ntask errors in the articulatory suppression condition is unclear, and perhaps counters that \nclaim.  \nClearer evidence on the issue of whether articulatory suppression has its effect \nspecifically by blocking self-directed speech comes from the combination of the dual task \nparadigm with the private speech results. As expected, children who produced more private \nspeech during 4-move problems evidenced a greater difference in performance between the \narticulatory suppression and control conditions. This suggests that the difference in \nperformance between the dual task conditions related to the fact that, in the articulatory \nsuppression condition, self-directed speech was suppressed. \nAlthough we predicted that the relation between private speech and articulatory \nsuppression interference would exist only for problems of intermediate difficulty, we \npredicted that there would be an effect of articulatory suppression for easy and intermediate \nproblems, but not for the most difficult problems. The rationale was that the most difficult \nproblems would be beyond the children\u2019s ability range and therefore private speech (and \ninner speech) would not be as useful as for the easier problems. In fact, the effect of \n24 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \narticulatory suppression did not vary by difficulty level in Experiment 2. Perhaps 5-move \nproblems were within the range at which private speech would improve performance; the \ncorrelation between private speech production and articulatory suppression interference for 5-\nmove problems was positive (.21), though not statistically significant. \nLimitations of the present study include the fact that the reason for the paucity of \nplanning in Experiment 1 is unknown. Although a certain amount of planning probably \noccurred \u201conline\u201d (while moving the disks), the relation between this and advance planning is \nunknown (see Berg & Byrd, 2002). Similarly, the precise nature of planning as measured by \nthe How many moves version of the Tower of London is somewhat underspecified. Owen et \nal.\u2019s (1995) How many moves version, like the original Shallice\u2019s (1982) original procedure, \nis sensitive to frontal lobe lesions (Owen et al.), and comparison of functional neuroimaging \nstudies shows that it activates the same neural network as Shallice\u2019s original procedure \n(Boghi et al., 2006), including the motor and prefrontal areas associated with planning (Baker \net al., 1996). However, to our knowledge no study has directly compared the versions, and so \nit is not possible to go into detail about how they might differ, save for the observation that \nthe How many moves version is likely to involve a larger memory component.\n2\n Such studies \nmight prove valuable in the future.  \nFuture research could also look at whether or not the reliance of planning on self-\ndirected speech decreases between childhood and adulthood, as suggested by the present \nstudy in combination with that of Fernyhough and Fradley (2005), Al-Namlah et al. (2006), \nand Wallace et al. (all of which found effects in children or adolescents) and Phillips et al. \n(1999, which found no detrimental effect of articulatory suppression in adults). The \ndifference between Phillips et al.\u2019s and the others\u2019 findings might be explained in terms of the \ndifferent ages of the participants. Alternatively, it might be an artifact of the differing task \ndemands of the five-disk and three-disk versions of the Tower of London (Berg & Byrd, \n25 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \n2002). To see whether adults show an effect of articulatory suppression on the three-disk \nversion might therefore be informative. \nThe present study is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating planning and \nindeed any executive function in children by documenting the effect of articulatory \nsuppression relative to a control dual task condition. The results were clear: that planning is \ndependent on self-directed speech in middle childhood. We suggest that the dual task \nparadigm is a useful tool for the investigation of self-directed speech in childhood, \nparticularly when used in conjunction with the observation of private speech. \n26 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \nFootnotes \n1\n We thank an anonymous reviewer for drawing this to our attention. \n2 \nWe do not consider the present study to have compared the versions because the Experiment \n1 procedure did not elicit planning as it has in previous studies.  \n  \n27 \nRunning head: ROLES OF PRIVATE AND INNER SPEECH IN PLANNING \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 1.
