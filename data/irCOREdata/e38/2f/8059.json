Introduction\nIn our present industrial environment, situations often arise where noise\ngenerated by a particular source propagates through ducts to produce unwanted\nnoise in locations removed from the source. It is necessary to try to eliminate this\nunwanted noise in, for example, architectural acoustics (duct noise produced in\nheating and ventilation systems), experimental aerodynamics (noise propagation\nwind tunnels), aircraft transport (noise from aircraft jets and turbo fan engines),\nand, of major importance in recent years, road transportation (exhaust noise from\ninternal combustion engines). One method of reducing noise is to introduce\nexpansion chambers to muffle the noise as it travels along the duct. The\nintroduction of acoustically absorbent lining into the duct is another method that\nhas proved useful in reducing unwanted noise (see Rawlins, 1978). The insertion\nof expansion chambers with acoustically lined walls is yet another effective\nmethod of reducing sound radiated from duct terminations of motor cars and\nlorries. We are interested in the effect of lining an exhaust chamber to reduce\nnoise exiting from an exhaust. To try to solve this problem theoretically 'head-on'\nwould be extremely complicated. A typical exhaust chamber is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe theoretical or numerical analysis of the system shown in Fig. 1 would be\nextremely complicated because of the large number of design parameters. An\napproach for analysing the system shown in Fig. 1 is the so called 'building block\nmethod' (see Nilsson & Branders, 1980a,b). This assumes that the longitudinal\nlengths between the various discontinuities is such that the canonical problem for\neach discontinuity can be considered in isolation. When the various discon-\ntinuities which make up the exhaust system have been separately analysed, these\nseparate field calculations can be combined by an effective matching procedure to\nproduce a composite result. Such an approach has been successfully applied by\nNilsson & Branders (1980a,b, 1981a,b) and Taylor et al. (1993).\nIn this work we shall obtain a solution to the discontinuity problem shown in\nFig. 2. An incident mode propagates in the smaller tube of radius a and this\n59\n\u00a9 Oxford University Press 1995\n at The O\npen U\nniversity on N\novem\nber 16, 2011\nhttp:\/\/im\nam\nat.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n60 A. D. RAWLINS\nJ)\nFIG. 1. An exhaust muffler.\nenters an infinite duct of radius b which is lined with acoustically absorbent\nmaterial. This particular problem may also be of some interest as a mathematical\nmodel of an instrument for the measurement of the acoustic lining properties\nfrom observation of the acoustic field reflected into the semi-infinite tube.\nProblems of a similar nature have been considered by Bailin (1951) and\nVainshtein (1948), who assume all the surfaces are either rigid or soft. The latter\nboundary condition has applications in electromagnetism. The present work\nwould have applications in electromagnetism when dealing with waveguides with\nlossy walls.\nThe present problem is solved by means of a relatively standard Wiener-Hopf\napproach and an exact expression obtained for the reflection coefficient. In\nSection 2 we shall formulate the mathematical boundary value problem. In\nSection 3 the problem formulated in Section 2 will be solved by means of the\nWiener-Hopf technique. The solution will be in the form of complex contour\nintegrals. These integrals will be evaluated in Section 4 by an application of\nCauchy's residue theorem. This produces a representation for the acoustic field in\nthe various regions as an infinite series of modes. In Section 5 the fields in the\nvarious regions are obtained when only the fundamental mode propagates in the\nsemi-infinite duct. This will result in expressions for the reflection and transmis-\nsion coefficient of the dominant propagating mode. The effect of the absorbent\nlining on the reflection coefficient is then analysed for the low-frequency situation.\nFinally, various appendices are supplied. These contain analytical details required\nin the main body of the paper.\nI [\nFIG. 2. Geometry of the diffraction problem.\n at The O\npen U\nniversity on N\novem\nber 16, 2011\nhttp:\/\/im\nam\nat.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nA BIFURCATED CIRCULAR WAVEGUIDE PROBLEM 61\n2. Formulation of the boundary value problem\nWe shall consider the acoustic diffraction of a plane wave mode propagating out\nof the open end of a semi-infinite rigid cylindrical tube. This semi-infinite tube is\nsurrounded by an infinite cylindrical casing which is lined with an acoustically\nabsorbing material. The cylinder casing and its lining are located at {r = b,\n-oo< 2<oo} j and the semi-infinite rigid cylinder, assumed infinitely thin, is\nlocated at {r = a<b, - \u00b0 \u00b0 < z < 0 } , in cylindrical polar coordinates (r, 6, z), as\nshown in Fig. 2. The sound source field, which is located at z = z0 (zo < 0),\npropagates cylindrically symmetric modes along the rigid tube. Therefore the\nsource field may be represented as plane wave modes independent of 0. Such a\nsituation arises, for example, when the source field is a point source located at\n(0,0, Zo)- From the symmetry of the geometry of the problem and of the incident\nfield, the acoustic field everywhere will be independent of 0. We shall therefore\nintroduce a scalar complex potential of the form \\p{r, z', t) which defines the\nacoustic pressure and velocity by p = \u2014podifi\/dt and \u00ab = grad<\/\u00bb respectively,\nwhere p0 is the density of the undisturbed medium. The acoustic impedance Z of\nthe lining is defined by the ratio Z =pl{u \u2022 n) (see Morse & Ingard, 1961), where\nthe normal n is directed into the lining. Thus, in terms of the velocity potential\nfunction ip, the boundary condition on the absorbent surface is given by\n(n \u2022 grad + 5c\"1 d\/d\/)t\/\/ = 0, where S (=poc\/Z) is the specific admittance and c is\nthe velocity of sound.\nThe incident sound field which can propagate down the tube is taken to be\nMr, z;t) = e-\"*'Mr, z) = iVofoOe*\"*-'\"1 (r < a, - \u00ab <\n z ^0), (2.1)\nwhere Ao = e~'XnX\u00b0, and an are the real roots of the equation\nJi(aan) = 0, (2.2)\nwith Xn - (k2 - a^)', k = <u\/c, ao = 0<a1<a2<- \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Having specified the\nincident field, we now set up the boundary value problem for the potential field\neverywhere: ip(r,z\\t) = e~\"\"\"<j>(r, z). The time factor e\"'\u00b0\" will be dropped in\nfuture calculations.\nThus, for such a primary field, if 4>{r, z) = <f>o(r, z) + $(r, z) is the total field in\nr<a and <f>(r, z) the total field in a<r<b, then <t>(r, z) must satisfy the\nfollowing:\n(ii)\nor\n(iii)\n' \" - - - ' , _ - . , ; = 0 (Re\u00a3>0)\nor\n(~\n at The O\npen U\nniversity on N\novem\nber 16, 2011\nhttp:\/\/im\nam\nat.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n6 2 A.

Namely\nd\nBr\nThe satisfaction of the conditions (i)-(vi) will result in a unique solution to the\nboundary value problem formulated.\n3. Solution of the boundary value problem\nFor analytic convenience we shall assume that k = kT + ikj (kr > kt s= 0). A suitable\nrepresentation for the total field <f>(r, z) in all space {-\u00b0\u00b0<z < \u00b0\u00b0, r^b} which\nsatisfies (i) is given by\n\/\u2022\u00bb+ir\n<j>(r, z) = <f>o(r, z)+ \\ e'vzA(v)J0(Kr)dv (r<a), (3.1)\n<f>(r,z) = j ' ein[B(v)J^Kr) + C(v)H\\}\\Kr)]dv (a<r<b), (3.2)\nwhere K = (k2 \u2014 v2)' and the branch cuts are from k to i\u00b0\u00b0 and from \u2014k to -i\u00b0\u00b0.\nThe cut sheet on which we shall work is defined by 0 =\u00a3 arg K =\u00a3 n. The quantities\nA(v), B(v), and C(v) are as yet unknown; however, the edge condition (vi)\nrequires that, as |v|-* oo;\ne<\"|v|\nA(v) = Odvr'e\"\"111), - \/ - B(v) + Vjt e-\u00b0|v|C(v) = O(| vf1)- (3-3)\nWe shall see later that the integrands of (3.1) and (3.2) have poles that produce\n at The O\npen U\nniversity on N\novem\nber 16, 2011\nhttp:\/\/im\nam\nat.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nA BIFURCATED CIRCULAR WAVEGUIDE PROBLEM 63\nexponential wave modes propagating down the ducts. These wave modes, in the\nvarious duct regions, must be of the form given in the radiation condition (v).\nThis requires that the integrands of (3.1) and (3.2) have pole singularities at\nv = \u2014k and v = \u201417,, v = \u00a3, respectively. Thus the real parameter r in (3.1) and\n(3.2) is restricted by requiring that the asymptotic behaviour (v) is achieved. This\nnecessitates that the contour of integration lies in a strip such that\nmax{-Im\/c, -Im 77,} <: T<Im \u00a3,.\nIt is shown in Appendix B that -Imk <0, -Im TJ, <0, and Im \u00a3, >0, so such a\nstrip does exist. Thus we have from Appendix B that the above field representa-\ntions are such that the integrands have no singularities in the strip \u2014 e < Im v <\n\u00a3 (\u00a3>0), so that the field representations (3.1) and (3.2) will exist for\n- \u00a3 < T< \u00a3 (f >0).\nTo determine v4(v), B(v), and C(v), we substitute (3.1) and (3.2) into the\nremaining boundary conditions (ii)-(iv), giving:\nf eivzA(v)Kj'0(Ka) dv = f eivzK[B(v)J'0(Ka) + C(v)\/\/&lv(Ka)] dv = 0\n(z<0), (3.4)\nJ)ldvr:\n-r\nJ \u2014 a\ne\nivzA(v)KJ'0(Ka) dv\ne\nivz[B(v)J(b, v) + C(v)H(b, v)] dv = 0\n.

The expression for K+(k), with kE unrestricted, is given in Appendix\nC, but it is a complicated product expression. Rather than try to derive an\nasymptotic expression from the infinite product representation for kE^O, we\nshall use a simpler more direct method. The expression for K+(v) is given by\n(C.1)-(C4) as\nK+(v) = Kl+(v)\/K2+(v)K3+(v).\nThe lining parameter Honly occurs in Ki+(v) and K3+(v).
