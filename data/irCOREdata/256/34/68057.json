INTRODUCTION \n     There is political recognition that our reliance on fossil \nfuels is non sustainable; nuclear power may not be \ncapable of providing the complete solution \u2013 where does \nthat leave us? Much recent sustainable energy generation \nhas focused on wind power, which is intermittent. \nBioenergy would require a major shift in land use. This \npaper explores the potential capacity of an often \noverlooked renewable energy source, namely micro scale \nhydro power. DEFRA has stated that if many streams and \nrivers in the UK could be tapped it would be possible to \nproduce around 10,000 GWh per year \u2013 enough to meet \nover 3% of UK current total energy requirements; making \na significant contribution to the Government\u2019s renewable \nenergy target of 10% by 2010, [1]. Additionally, as a \nclean power source hydro can help attain national targets \nfor CO2 reduction. \n \nOne much discussed element of the British weather is \nrain; especially in the west of the country. We receive \nreliable annual precipitation rates of approximately 1m \u2013 \n3m (depending on location and altitude); this coupled \nwith a complex terrain generated array of mountain \nstreams through to lowland rivers, has the potential to \nconvert moving water (kinetic energy) into electricity via \na turbine for both ultra low (<2m), low (2-20m) and \nmedium\/high heads (>20m). In the UK our largest energy \ndemands occur during autumn through to spring. In \ngeneral, this coincides with the period of highest water \nflow; making hydro often more attractive than other \nrenewable energy sources such as solar power. \nLancaster University on behalf of the Joule Centre \n(http:\/\/www.joulecentre.org\/), and the North West \nDevelopment Agency (NWDA), (http:\/\/nwda.co.uk) has \nbeen awarded a grant to investigate the potential of hydro \npower in North West England. The project entitled \n\u201cNorth West Hydro Resource Model\u201d aims to build a web \nbased tool; which will enable interested parties to ask \nwhether hydro power could be harnessed to provide all or \na proportion of their individual or community electricity \nrequirements, [2 - 5]. \nII.  SEQUENTIAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS \n     A number of leading Lancaster academics across \nmany departments in partnership with the Centre for \nEcology and Hydrology (CEH) and Hydrological \nSolutions (HS) in Wallingford have come together in an \nattempt to address this problem. The model will be an \niterative process and Lancaster University is approaching \nit from a systems and informatics standpoint [6]. To be \neconomically viable, any energy system has to recover its \ncosts over a defined period \u2013 the payback time? Thus, the \nmain decision of any hydro power scheme is economic. \nThis key element will ultimately determine if a project \nmoves from conception to completion. In-between there \nare many other phases and steps.  \n     Figure 1 shows a circuit that takes linked information \naround an iterative loop in a \u201cSequential Decision \nMaking\u201d (SDM) process, [7]. This process requires the \nuser to ask a number of questions at each of the main \ntopic headings within the sequence before moving to the \nnext topic or level. Within this project topics are defined \nas work packages (http:\/\/www.engineering.lancs.ac.uk\/ \nREGROUPS\/LUREG\/home.htm).  \nRenewable Energy Resources Impact on \nClean Electrical Power by developing the \nNorth-West England Hydro Resource Model\nPhilip Leigh1, George Aggidis1, David Howard2 and Bob Rothschild3 \n \n1 Lancaster University, Department of Engineering, Bailrigg, Lancaster, LA1 4YR, England \n2 Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster Environment Centre, Bailrigg, Lancaster, LA1 4AP, England \n3 Lancaster University, Department of Economics, Lancaster University, Bailrigg, Lancaster, LA1 4YR, England\n1-4244-0632-3\/07\/$20.00 \u00a92007 IEEE. 315\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

This \nprocess allows refinement of questioning in order to \nobtain a higher level of sophistication and accuracy in the \nanswers, and permits the user to short circuit the loop \nwhere applicable in order to move their individual project \nforward [8]. The SDM process is designed to develop a \ngeneric and fundamental understanding of the barriers to \nthe deployment of hydro electric schemes in North-West \nEngland. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Multi-Level Sequential Decision Making Process. \nA.  Modelling \n     The modelling approaches being employed will differ \nwithin each component, using mathematical, statistical \nand economic analysis. The outputs will be presented in a \nrange of formats enabling use of the results to be made by \ndifferent users. The model is seen as a tactical tool that \nwill operate at the level of individual low- and ultra-low \nhead hydro installations and there is interest from \npotential users across a range of scales from large utilities \nand national agencies to local manufacturers. \nB.  Validation \n     The development of the model will include field \nvalidation of any forecast figures and will identify the \nnecessary monitoring and gauging to identify measures \nthat can rapidly and easily be taken to confirm confidence \nin the proposed solution. It is intended that the system, \nonce initiated, could be developed further for use outside \nNorth-West England. \nIII.  WORK PACKAGES \n     The North-West England hydro resource project \ncomprises of 6 main Work Packages (WP\u2019s). These are: \nA.  (WP1) Demand and economics  \n     This work package addresses identified costs and \nrevenues associated with various turbine technologies. \nCost per kilowatt hour produced (p\/kWh) is a key \nelement of any proposed hydro power system. WP1 will \nalso investigate costs and benefits for a community, e.g. \nloss of amenity and degradation of the physical \nenvironment.  \n    Connection to the grid can be a costly component of a \nhydro power scheme and must be included in the overall \nbudget (figure 3). \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Grid connection is a key factor in any hydro scheme that cannot \nuse all generated power on site. \n \nB.  (WP2) Resource capacity \n     Here we will utilise expertise from HS Wallingford \nand Low Flows 2000 software to estimate flow duration \ncurves for different river and stream reaches and identify \nsub catchments [9], (figure 4).  \n     Uncertainty in the prediction of flow duration curves \nwill be constrained to minimise and express uncertainty \nin projected energy production in order to demonstrate \nthe viability of a scheme.  \nPreliminary \nquestioning level \nSecondary inquiry level \nDetailed search level \nLevel 1 \nLevel 2 \nLevel 3 \nProject decision level Level \u2019X\u2019 \nIncreasing levels of sophistication \n316\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

(WP3) Engineering options \n     Modern hydro turbine design allows for small turbine \nunits to be installed directly into a small stream or water \ncourse. GIS data combined with flow data established \nfrom WP2 will feed into advanced software tools to \noptimise the engineering options on cost and annual \ngenerated power; all latest engineering innovations will \nbe incorporated in this model, [10, 11], (figure 5).  \n \n \n \nFig. 5: Example output from HydrA [1] of the turbine operational \nboundaries; inset is a Francis turbine installed in Blackburn Wastewater \nTreatment Works. \n \n     Each design will have its own specific characteristics \nand components including storage, culvert, penstock, \nturbine house and tailrace system, whose values will be \nadjusted for each location, [12, 13].  \nD.  (WP4) Environmental implications \n     The often ad hoc and loosely defined approaches to \ndefining impacts of hydro power schemes on a water \ncourse are currently being reviewed by various licensing \nbodies.  \n     This WP is an opportunity to ensure the environmental \nimplications of a hydro scheme, such as a water \nabstraction licence and environmental impact assessment \nare at one with current environmental legislation. To this \nend the project is in consultation with the Environment \nAgency to help ensure all parties are considered, [14], \n(figure 6). \n \n \n \nFig. 6: Illustration of part of the thought process before a hydro power \nsystem is approved in a particular location. \nE.  (WP5) Public engagement  \n     How the public engage with hydro technology is a \ncrucial question this WP is seeking to address. Ordinary \npeople are potential adopters of the technology at a micro \nhousehold and community level and may be concerned \nabout the local impacts of the installation (visual, \necological, noise etc.). The research here will focus on \nrecognising the diversity of public and stakeholder groups \nwho may have an interest in the installation and impacts \nof small scale hydro technologies.  \nF.  (WP6) Dissemination and exploitation \n     The final work package will ensure the project \ndelivers its objectives and outputs and identifies future \nwork on technologies and legislation that can smooth the \npath for potential hydro power designers, installers and \nend users. The novelty of this project is its ability to \nidentify appropriate solutions to different situations and \nlocations. The outputs will not be a \u201cone size fits all\u201d \napproach, but offer a range of options that will have \ndifferent capacities, values and costs. \nIV.  CASE STUDY \u2013 SIZERGH ESTATE, SEDGWICK, \nCUMBRIA, UK \n     The River Kent runs southward alongside the easterly \nborder of the Sizergh estate and contains the New \nSedgwick Gunpowder Works (NSGW) site. A second \n317\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 23,2010 at 15:18:12 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n site, Old Sedgwick, is located \u00bc mile downstream on the \nopposite bank of the river.  \n     The final site along the Kent, Basingill, is located \n1.2km further downstream from NSGW on the opposite \nside of the river. The three locations were once elements \nof a wider network of seven sites that were part of the \nCumbrian gunpowder industry in the South-East of the \ncounty [15]. The seven sites can be seen below in figure \n7. \n \n \n \nFig. 7:  Map to show the location of the seven Gunpowder Works Sites \nin South-East Cumbria; \u00a9 English Heritage, [15]. \n    \n     The industry relied on the civilian needs for the \ngunpowder, and supplied the mines and quarries in the \nnorth of England with blasting powder. This was an \neffective alternative to the hub of the industry; located in \nthe South of England, primarily around London, which \nserved the military market and allowed the dangerous \nprocesses to be carried out in the relative safety of the \nsecluded locations the area provided. Old Sedgwick was \nthe earliest recorded gunpowder works in Cumbria; being \nestablished in 1764 by John Wakefield I and partners. In \n1790 the company was forced to construct additional \nmills at Basingill. The site closed in 1852 following the \nexpiry of the lease of land.     \n     Construction started on NSGW in 1857 by William \nCharles Strickland, owner of Sizergh Castle and its estate \n(figure 8), but by 1864 his company had failed and had \nbeen taken over by a syndicate from Manchester. The \nindustry declined sharply after World War I when there \nwas a collapse in the demand for many of the Lake \nDistrict\u2019s mineral resources. NSGW closed in 1935 and a \nnumber of buildings were demolished to prevent any \nresidual gunpowder in their fabric being accidentally \nignited. The last site to close was Gatebeck in 1936. The \nremains of the NSGW site occupy an area of 10.9 \nhectares (26.9 acres). The site is designated a Scheduled \nAncient Monument (No 27807) and a number of its \nupstanding remains are also Listed Buildings (Grade II). \n \n \n \nFig. 8: Location of New Sedgwick Gunpowder Works on the River \nKent showing the 845m Leat from Larkrigg to Cooper\u2019s Yard; \u00a9 \nEnglish Heritage, [15]. \n \n     Figure 9, below shows an artist\u2019s interpretative sketch \nof the hydro power arrangement at New Sedgwick \nGunpowder Works. The incorporating mills were built in \ntwo ranges set at an angle to each other and separated by \na blast wall [16]. \n \n \n \nFig. 9: Partial site reconstruction sketch by English Heritage of the \nincorporating mills at New Sedgwick Gunpowder Works; \u00a9 English \nHeritage, [15]. \n \n     The National Trust (NT) acquired the site in 1950 and \nmaintains a few of the buildings south of the works. \nRecently local tenants and the Trust have shown an \ninterest in renovating the works at NSGW with the \npurpose of once again producing energy from the waters \nof the Kent. With this in mind the authors of the north-\nwest hydro resource model are working with the NT and \nusing the NSGW site as a case study.

Low Flows 2000 \n    The mean flow for any given channel is estimated \nusing a deterministic model calibrated on observed flow \ndata from over 500 gauged catchments in the United \nKingdom. While the annual FDC model incorporated \nwithin Low Flows makes use a 'region of influence \n(ROI)' approach to hydrological regionalisation. \nDimensionless, observed flow duration statistics from \ncatchments 'similar' to the user-defined catchment are \ncombined to estimate statistics for that catchment. \nSimilarity is defined using a Euclidean metric based on \ncatchment characteristics [17]. A similar ROI approach is \napplied to estimate the proportion of annual runoff \ndistributed over each month. Monthly flow duration \ncurves are estimated from dimensionless observed \nmonthly FDCs using an ROI model identical to the \nannual FDC model. The estimates of monthly mean flows \nare then used to rescale these dimensionless curves to \nflow units [18]. \n \n \n \nFig. 12: Flow Duration Curves for the River Kent at Sedgwick [17]. \n\u00b6\n319\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 23,2010 at 15:18:12 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n  \n     Flow duration curves were derived from Low Flows \n2000 (figure 12). The thick blue line shows the mean \nannual flow while the lower curves are the summer \nmonths (low flow period) and top curves winter\/spring \n(high flow period). A residual flow must always be left to \npass over the weir and down the fish pass (the Kent is a \nsalmon river) and this will be stipulated within the license \nrequired for the scheme. On the basis of previous \nschemes, and initial consultations with the EA this has \nbeen assumed to be equal to the Q95 flow (this means \nthat for 5% of the year the flow will be at this level or \nbelow). The residual flow and the existing abstractions \nare subtracted from the measured flow to give the actual \nflow available for power generation.  \nB.  Turbine choice \n    For a low head site such as this, options considered \ninclude: Kaplan, Crossflow, Banki type, Ossberger, \nArchimedean screw or propeller turbine. The Kaplan \nwhich is an axial flow reaction turbine specifically \ndesigned for low head operation would be an appropriate \nchoice. A bulb turbine is similar to a Kaplan turbine, but \nwith the generator enclosed in a waterproof bulb within \nthe flow. If a Kaplan turbine is used it would be sensible \nfor it to be \u201cdouble-regulated\u201d, i.e. for both the guide \nvanes and the blades to be adjustable. This is because of \nthe large range of flows occurring at the site and the need \nto accommodate them, [11, 12]. \n     The original turbine installed at NSGW was \nmanufactured in Kendal by Gilbert Gilkes and Gordon \nLimited, [19]. \nC.  Power generation \n     The total power available in the section of river \nconsidered will vary according to the time of year. In \ngeneral terms the total power available can be expressed \nby: \n \n\u0002\u0003QHP \u0004      (1) \n \nWhere:   \u0004P  Power (kW) \n \u0004Q  Flow (m3\/s) \n\u0004H  Gross head (m) \n              \u0002    = Specific Weight of Water (9.81kN\/m3)    \nAssuming \u0005 density of cold clean water is 1000 kg\/m3 \nand g acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m\/s2 \n\u0003    = Efficiency (assuming 80% efficiency) \n \n     From this formula it can be seen that the power \navailable in the river section is potentially: \n \nMinimum mean potential power generation (July) \n \nP = 3.623 x 6.4 x 0.8 x 9.81 = 182kW  (2) \n \nMaximum mean potential power generation (December) \n \nP = 15.51 x 6.4 x 0.8 x 9.81 = 778kW  (3) \n  \nAnnual mean potential power generation                              \n \nP = 9.005 x 6.4 x 0.8 x 9.81 = 452kW  (4) \n      \n     The Capacity Factor (CF) is a ratio summarizing how \nhard a turbine is working, expressed as: \n \nCF = Energy generated per year (kWh\/year)\/ (5) \n         Installed capacity (kW x 8760 hours\/year \n \n     Annual energy output is estimated from an assumed \nCapacity Factor (CF) of 35% as follows: \n \nEnergy (E), (kWh\/year) = P (kW) x CF x 8760 (6) \n \nE = 452 x 0.35 8760    (7) \n \nE = 1385832 kW\/year    (8) \n \nAnnual revenue = E x Unit Cost (p\/kW)  (9) \n \nAnnual revenue = 1385832 x 0.06 = \u00a383,150             (10) \n \n \n     From (10) above the payback period for a hydro \nscheme costing \u00a3200K is around 2.4 years and 3.6 years \nfor a scheme costing \u00a3300K. However, these feasibility \nfigures are only a guide. A detailed study and costing \nwould be undertaken if the NT and interested parties \nwished to follow the proposal to restore NSGW and \ngenerate hydropower on the River Kent at Sedgwick. \n     The large differences in potential power output \nthroughout the year show how it is important that the \ncorrect type of generator is selected. These calculations \nhave been made using gross head and it should be noted \nthat the net head could be considerably lower, especially \nwith the long length of the leat. Additionally, an \nefficiency of 80% has been used in the above \ncalculations, and not all turbines will necessarily be this \nefficient.  \nD.  Restrictions  \n     One initial major concern voiced by the Environment \nAgency (EA) regarding the redevelopment of NSGW is \nthe present length of the Leat (845m). This means that \nwater is displaced from the Kent for a considerable \ndistance and the EA has concerns that this may harm the \necology of the river. This could be possibly be solved by \nrestricting the proportion of the total flow diverted \nthrough the turbine. An alternative attempt to draw the \nwater from the river further downstream of the Larkrigg \nweir was proposed at a weir that pre-dated the gunpowder \nworks. This can be seen in figure 13 below. \nE.  Cost analysis \n     The extensive redevelopment required will incur a \nconsiderable cost, not only with the mechanical \nequipment needed but also civil works on the weir, leat, \nturbine housing and any educational centre required. A \nstudy by Liverpool John Moores University in 1998 [16], \n320\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 23,2010 at 15:18:12 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n estimated that reconstructing the weir would cost roughly \n\u00a330,000 and the Leat would cost about \u00a3100 per metre to \nrepair to a useable standard (giving a total of roughly \n\u00a384,500 for its repair). Assuming that inflation has been \nroughly 2.5% in the intervening years this would give a \n2007 price of roughly \u00a338,000 for the weir and \u00a3103,000 \nfor the leat.  \n \n \n \nFig. 13: Map to show the site of a weir that pre-dates the Sizergh \nGunpowder Works; \u00a9 English Heritage, [15]. \n \n     In addition to this there would be the cost of the \nturbine and turbine housing itself, which would typically \nbe between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3165,000 The final total could \nreach up to \u00a3300,000 when the costs of the educational \nbuildings are taken into consideration. Alternatively, this \nvalue could be as low \u00a3200,000. It should be noted that \nKaplan turbines have been found to be more expensive \nthan propeller turbines although they are more efficient in \noperation. \nV.  CONCLUSIONS \n     As bulk electricity supply from large utilities became \nmore generally available many small hydro schemes fell \ninto disuse. Since 1980, small hydro schemes have shown \nstrong development in many countries, supported by \nfavorable political measures. Today, revival of similar \nschemes in Britain by re-planting into existing \ninfrastructure or refurbishment of old plants can be cost \neffective and make a useful contribution to renewable \nenergy production; there are also a large number of \npreviously unconsidered sites. Small hydro is also well \nsuited for integration into existing infrastructure, and \nparticularly on water supply schemes since major civil \nengineering structures are already in place. An \nimaginative development of such schemes leads to power \ngeneration where the energy was previously dissipated. \nThe development of a model is described that integrates \nthe disciplines necessary to develop the hydro application \nin the North-West of England. \n     The model is composed of a series of integrated sub-\nmodels addressing the barriers to installation of devices \nas seen through different disciplines. The information is \nlinked through an economic assessment which identifies \ndifferent turbine options, assesses their suitability for \nlocation and demand and combines the different styles of \ninformation in a way that supports decision making. \nThere are five sub-model components; the hydrological \nresource is modelled using Low Flows 2000 which is \nbeing extended to improve coverage of smaller un-\ngauged rivers, the turbine options will be identified from \nhydrological, environmental and demand requirements \nand the consequences of the different solutions will be \nfed into the other components so that the environmental \nimpacts and public acceptability can be assessed and \nvalued. The model also feeds information into the \nhydrological resource estimates so that the consequences \nof multiple installations can be assessed. \n     The modelling approaches being employed differ \nwithin each component, using mathematical, statistical \nand cost-benefit approaches. The outputs will be \npresented in a range of formats enabling use of the results \nto be made by different users. The model is seen as a \ntactical tool that will operate at the level of individual \nlow- and ultra-low head hydro installations and there is \ninterest from potential users across a range of scales from \nlarge utilities and national agencies to local \nmanufacturers. \n     The development of the model includes field \nvalidation of any forecast figures and will identify the \nnecessary monitoring and gauging to identify measures \nthat can rapidly and easily taken to confirm the \nconfidence in the proposed solution. \n     Any redevelopment of the Gunpowder Works at \nSedgwick would require an extensive environmental \nimpact assessment, along with a detailed planning \napplication. The payback period on such a scheme is \nlikely to be long. Linking to the National Grid may be \ncomplex and downtime and maintenance costs must be \nconsidered. However, if sufficient interest is shown grant \nsupport may make the project viable. \n     Historically water power was utilised for centuries to \ndrive machinery in mills and factories. It determined the \nlocation of industry, supported the industrial revolution \nand shaped the landscape of the North West, but since the \nend of the 19th century its importance declined as fuel \npowered engine technology flourished. However, perhaps \nit is time to revisit the potential of this overlooked \nresource that is literally flowing past our front doors. This \nproject is in its infancy, but has potential to be applied \nthroughout the UK. \nAPPENDIX \nAppendix 1: Scale Map of Buildings and Features of \nNew Sedgwick Gunpowder Works [15]. \n \n321\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.
