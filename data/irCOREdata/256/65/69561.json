This is analogous to the concept of\nan A-group, which is a finite group with the property that all of its Sylow\nsubgroups are abelian. These groups were first studied in the 1940s by Philip\nHall as soluble A-groups, and are still studied today. A great deal is known\nabout their structure. Rather less is known about A-algebras, though they\nhave been studied and used by a number of authors, including Bakhturin\nand Semenov [1], Dallmer [2], Drensky [3], Sheina [8] and [9], Premet and\nSemenov [6], Semenov [7] and Towers and Varea [13], [14].\nThey arise in the study of constant Yang-Mills potentials. Every non-\nabelian nilpotent Lie algebra admits a non-trivial solution of the constant\nYang-Mills equations. Moreover, if a subalgebra of a Lie algebra L admits\na non-trivial solution of the Yang-Mills equations then so does L. It is\ntherefore useful to know if a given non-nilpotent Lie algebra has a non-\nabelian nilpotent subalgebra (see [2] for more details). They have also been\nparticularly important in relation to the problem of describing residually\nfinite varieties (see [1], [8], [9], [7] and [6]).\nThe Frattini ideal of L, \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in all\nmaximal subalgebras of L. The Lie algebra L is called \u03c6-free if \u03c6(L) = 0,\nand elementary if \u03c6(B) = 0 for every subalgebra B of L. We say that L is\nan E-algebra if \u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(L) for all subalgebras B of L. Following Jacobson\n[4], we say that a linear Lie algebra L \u2264 gl(V ) is almost algebraic if L\ncontains the nilpotent and semisimple Jordan components of its elements.\nEvery algebraic Lie algebra is almost algebraic. An abstract Lie algebra L\nis called almost algebraic if adL \u2264 gl(L) is almost algebraic. The classes\nof elementary Lie algebras, E-algebras, almost algebraic Lie algebras and\nA-algebras are related, as is shown in [13] and [14]. The centre of L is\nZ(L) = {x \u2208 L : [x, y] = 0 for all y \u2208 L}. We summarise below some of the\nknown results for Lie A-algebras.\nTheorem 1.1 Let L be a Lie A-algebra over a field F .\n(i) If F has characteristic zero, then\n(a) L is almost algebraic if and only if it is elementary; in this case\nL splits over each of its ideals;\n(b) L is elementary whenever L\/R(L) and R(L) are elementary, where\nR(L) is the solvable radical of L; and\n2\n(c) L is an E-algebra.\n(ii) If F has characteristic 6= 2, 3, then Q(L) = {c \u2208 L : (adc)2 = 0}is the\nunique maximal abelian ideal in L.\n(iii) If F has characteristic 6= 2, 3 and cohomological dimension \u2264 1, then\n(a) L2 \u2229 Z(L) = 0; and\n(b) L has a Levi decomposition and every Levi subalgebra is repre-\nsentable as a direct sum of simple ideals, each one of which splits\nover some finite extension of the ground field into a direct sum\nof ideals isomorphic to sl(2).\nProof. (i) See Towers and Varea, [14].\n(ii), (iii) See Premet and Semenov, [6].\nThe purpose of this paper is to obtain more detailed results on the struc-\nture of solvable Lie A-algebras. Some of the development is suggested by\n[5], but more is possible for Lie algebras.\nIn section two we collect together the preliminary results that we need,\nincluding the fact that for Lie A-algebras the derived series coincides with\nthe lower nilpotent series. We also see that Lie A-algebras need not be\nmetabelian.\nSection three contains the basic structure theorems for solvable Lie A-\nalgebras. First they split over each term in their derived series. This leads\nto a decomposition of L as L = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9A0 where Ai is an abelian\nsubalgebra of L and L(i) = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9Ai for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. It is\nshown that the ideals of L relate nicely to this decomposition: if K is an\nideal of L then K = (K \u2229 An)+\u02d9(K \u2229 An\u22121)+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9(K \u2229 A0); moreover, if\nN is the nilradical of L, Z(L(i)) = N \u2229 Ai. We also see that the result in\nTheorem 1.1 (iii)(a) holds when L is solvable without any restrictions on\nthe underlying field.\nThe fourth section looks at LieA-algebras in which L2 is nilpotent. These\nare metabelian and so the results of section three simplify. In addition we\ncan locate the position of the maximal nilpotent subalgebras: if U is a\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebra of L then U = (U \u2229L2)\u2295 (U \u2229C) where C is\na Cartan subalgebra of L.\nSection five is devoted to Lie A-algebras having a unique minimal ideal\nW . These have played a significant part in the study of varieties of resid-\nually finite Lie algebras. Again some of the results of sections three and\n3\nfour simplify. In particular, N = ZL(W ), and if L is strongly solvable the\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebras of L are L2 and the Cartan subalgebras of\nL (that is, the subalgebras that are complementary to L2.) We also give\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a Lie algebra with a unique minimal\nideal to be a strongly solvable A-algebra.\nThe final section is devoted to more detailed structure results when the\nunderlying field is algebraically closed.\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field\nF . Algebra direct sums will be denoted by \u2295, whereas vector space direct\nsums will be denoted by +\u02d9.\n2 Preliminary results\nFirst we note that the class of Lie A-algebras is closed with respect to\nsubalgebras, factor algebras and direct sums. Also that there is always a\nunique maximal abelian ideal, and it is the nilradical (which is equal to Q(L)\nif F has characteristic 6= 2, 3, by Theorem 1.1 (ii)).\nLemma 2.1 Let L be a Lie A-algebra and let N be its nilradical. Then\n(i) N is the unique maximal abelian ideal of L; and\n(ii) every subalgebra and every factor algebra of L is an A-algebra.\nProof. (i) Clearly N is abelian and contains every abelian ideal of L.\n(ii) It is easy to see that L is subalgebra closed; that it is factor algebra\nclosed is [6, Lemma 1].\nLemma 2.2 Let B, C be ideals of the Lie algebra L.\n(i) If L\/A, L\/B are A-algebras, then L\/(B \u2229 C) is an A-algebra.\n(ii) If L = B \u2295 C, where B,C are A-algebras, then L is an A-algebra.\nProof. (i) Let U\/(B \u2229 C) be a nilpotent subalgebra of L\/(B \u2229 C). Then\n(U + B)\/B is a nilpotent subalgebra of L\/B, which is an A-algebra. It\nfollows that U2 \u2286 B. Similarly, U2 \u2286 C, whence the result.\n(ii) This follows from (i).\n4\nWe define the nilpotent residual, \u03b3\u221e(L), of L be the smallest ideal of L\nsuch that L\/\u03b3\u221e(L) is nilpotent. Clearly this is the intersection of the terms\nof the lower central series for L. Then the lower nilpotent series for L is the\nsequence of ideals Ni(L) of L defined by N0(L) = L, Ni+1(L) = \u03b3\u221e(Ni(L))\nfor i \u2265 0. The derived series for L is the sequence of ideals L(i) of L defined\nby L(0) = L, L(i+1) = [L(i), L(i)] for i \u2265 0; we will also write L2 for L(1). If\nL(n) = 0 but L(n\u22121) 6= 0 we say that that L has derived length n.\nFor Lie A-algebras we have the following result.\nLemma 2.3 Let L be a Lie A-algebra. Then the lower nilpotent series\ncoincides with the derived series.\nProof. Since L\/L(1) is nilpotent we have N1(L) \u2286 L(1). Also L\/N1(L) is\nnilpotent and hence abelian, by Lemma 2.1 (ii), so L(1) \u2286 N1(L). Repetition\nof this argument gives Ni(L) = L(i) for each i \u2265 0.\nIf F has characteristic zero, then every LieA-algebra over F is metabelian,\nsince L2 is nilpotent. This is not the case, however, when F is any field of\ncharacteristic p > 0, as the following example, which is taken from [4, pages\n52, 53], shows.\nExample 2.1 Let\ne =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n0 1 0 . . . 0\n0 0 1 0 . . 0\n...\n...\n0 . . . . 0 1\n1 0 . . . . 0\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb , f =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n0 0 0 . . . 0\n0 1 0 . . . 0\n0 0 2 . . . 0\n...\n...\n0 0 0 . . . p\u2212 1\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\nlet F be a field of prime characteristic p and put L = Fe + Ff + F p with\nproduct [a+ x, b+ y] = [a, b] + (xb\u2212 ya) for all a, b \u2208 Fe+ Ff , x,y \u2208 F p.\nThen L is a solvable Lie algebra and L2 = Fe+ F p is not nilpotent. More-\nover, F p is a minimal ideal of L so the maximal subalgebras are either\nisomorphic to Fe+ Ff , which is solvable but not nilpotent, or of the form\nF (\u03b1e + \u03b2f) + F p for some \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F . It is straightforward to calculate\nthat the characteristic polynomial of \u03b1e + \u03b2f is xp \u2212 \u03b2p\u22121x \u2212 \u03b1p. This is\nnever divisible by x2 and is divisible by x if and only if \u03b1 = 0. It follows\nthat the nilpotent subalgebras of L are one-dimensional, Ff + Fx1 where\n5\nx1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0), or inside F p; in particular, all of them are abelian so\nthis is a Lie A-algebra.\nNote that L is also \u03c6-free but not elementary. For let B = Fe + F p.\nThen it is easy to see that Fx1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Fxp (where xi is the ith standard\nbasis vector for F p) is an ideal of B, and is, in fact, \u03c6(B). Therefore this is\nan example of a Lie A-algebra that is not an E-algebra.\nIf B is a subalgebra of L, the centraliser of B in L is ZL(B) = {x \u2208 L :\n[x,B] = 0}. We shall also need the following simple result.\nLemma 2.4 Let L be any solvable Lie algebra with nilradical N . Then\nZL(N) \u2286 N\nProof. Suppose that ZL(N) 6\u2286 N . Then there is a non-trivial abelian ideal\nA\/(N \u2229ZL(N) of L\/(N \u2229ZL(N) inside ZL(N)\/(N \u2229ZL(N). But now A3 \u2286\n[A,N ] = 0, so A is a nilpotent ideal of L. It follows that A \u2286 N \u2229ZL(N), a\ncontradiction.\n3 Decomposition results\nHere we have the basic structure theorems. First we see that L splits over\nthe terms in its derived series.\nTheorem 3.1 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra. Then L splits over each\nterm in its derived series. Moreover, the Cartan subalgebras of L(i)\/L(i+2)\nare precisely the subalgebras that are complementary to L(i+1)\/L(i+2) for\ni \u2265 0.\nProof. Suppose that L(n+1) = 0 but L(n) 6= 0. First we show that L splits\nover L(n). Clearly we can assume that n \u2265 2. Let C be a Cartan subalgebra\nof L(n\u22121) (see, for example, [15, Corollary 4.4.1.2]) and let L = L0+\u02d9L1 be\nthe Fitting decomposition of L relative to adC. Then L1 = \u2229\u221ek=1L(adC)k \u2286\nL(n), and so L1 is an abelian ideal of L. Also L(n\u22121) = L1+\u02d9L0 \u2229L(n\u22121) and\nL0 \u2229 L(n\u22121) = (L(n\u22121))0 = C, which is abelian. It follows that L(n\u22121)\/L1 =\nNn\u22121(L)\/L1 is abelian, whence L1 \u2286 Nn(L) = L(n) and L = L0+\u02d9L(n).\nSo we have that L = L(n)+\u02d9B where B = L0 is a subalgebra of L.\nClearly B(n) = 0, so, by the above argument, B splits over B(n\u22121), say\n6\nB = B(n\u22121)+\u02d9D. But then L = L(n)+\u02d9(B(n\u22121)+\u02d9D) = L(n\u22121)+\u02d9D. Continuing\nin this way gives the desired result.\nThis gives us the following fundamental decomposition result.\nCorollary 3.2 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra of derived length n + 1.\nThen\n(i) L = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9A0 where Ai is an abelian subalgebra of L for\neach 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n; and\n(ii) L(i) = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9Ai for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\nProof. (i) By Theorem 3.1 there is a subalgebra Bn of L such that L =\nL(n)+\u02d9Bn. Put An = L(n). Similarly Bn = An\u22121+\u02d9Bn\u22121 where An\u22121 =\n(Bn)(n\u22121). Continuing in this way we get the claimed result. Note, in\nparticular, that it is apparent from the construction that Ak \u2229 (Ak\u22121+ ...+\nA0) = 0 for each 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, and that it is easy to see from this that the\nsum is a vector space direct sum.\n(ii) We have that L(n) = An. Suppose that L(k) = An+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9Ak for some\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Then L = L(k)+\u02d9Bk andAk\u22121 = B(k\u22121)k by the construction in (i).\nBut now L(k\u22121) \u2286 L(k) +B(k\u22121)k \u2286 L(k\u22121), whence L(k\u22121) = An+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9Ak\u22121\nand the result follows by induction.\nNow we show that the result in Theorem 1.1 (iii)(a) holds when L is\nsolvable without any restrictions on the underlying field. We say that L is\nmonolithic with monolith W if W is the unique minimal ideal of L.\nTheorem 3.3 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra. Then Z(L) \u2229 L2 = 0.\nProof. Let L be a minimal counter-example and let z \u2208 Z(L) \u2229 L2. Put\nZ(L) = U+\u02d9Fz. Then U is an ideal of L and\nU 6= z + U \u2208 (Z(L) \u2229 L2 + U)\/U = Z(L\/U) \u2229 (L\/U)2.\nThe minimality of L implies that U = 0, so Z(L) = Fz. But now if K is an\nideal of L which does not contain Z(L), thenK 6= z+K \u2208 Z(L\/K)\u2229(L\/K)2\nsimilarly, contradicting the minimality of L. It follows that L is monolithic\nwith monolith Z(L).\n7\nNow let M be a maximal ideal of L. Then Z(M) \u2229 M2 = 0 by the\nminimality of L, so Z(L) 6\u2286 M2, whence M2 = 0. It follows that L =\nM+\u02d9Fx for some x \u2208 L and M is abelian. Let L = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting\ndecomposition of L relative to adx. Then L1 = \u2229\u221ei=1L(adx)i \u2286 M , and\n[L0, L1] \u2286 L1, so L1 is an ideal of L. But this implies that Z(L) \u2286 L1\u2229L0 =\n0, a contradiction. The result follows.\nNext we aim to show the relationship between ideals of L and the de-\ncomposition given in Corollary 3.2. First we need the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra of derived length \u2264 n + 1,\nand suppose that L = B+\u02d9C where B = L(n\u22121) and C is a subalgebra of L.\nIf D is an ideal of L then D = (B \u2229D)+\u02d9(C \u2229D).\nProof. Let L be a counter-example for which dimL + dimD is minimal.\nSuppose first that D2 6= 0. Then D2 = (B\u2229D2)+\u02d9(C\u2229D2) by the minimality\nof L. Moreover, since\nL\/D2 = (B +D2)\/D2 +\u02d9 (C +D2)\/D2\nwe have\nD\/D2 = (B \u2229D +D2)\/D2 +\u02d9 (C \u2229D +D2)\/D2\nwhence\nD = B \u2229D + C \u2229D +D2 = B \u2229D + C \u2229D.\nWe therefore have that D2 = 0.\nPut E = C(n\u22121). Then D + E \u2286 N , the nilradical of L, which is\nabelian, so [D,E] = 0; that is, D \u2286 ZL(E). But ZL(E) = ZB(E) + ZC(E).\nFor, suppose that x = b + c \u2208 ZL(E), where b \u2208 B, c \u2208 C. Then 0 =\n[x,E] = [b, E] + [c, E], so [b, E] = \u2212[c, E] \u2208 B \u2229 C = 0. This implies that\nZL(E) \u2286 ZB(E) + ZC(E). But the reverse inclusion is clear, so equality\nfollows.\nNow L(n\u22122) \u2286 B + E \u2286 L(n\u22122), so B = L(n\u22121) = (B + E)2 = [B,E].\nLet L(n\u22122) = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L(n\u22122) relative to adE.\nThen B \u2286 L1 so that ZB(E) \u2286 L0\u2229L1 = 0, whence D \u2286 ZL(E) = ZC(E) \u2286\nC and the result follows.\nTheorem 3.5 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra of derived length n+1 with\nnilradical N , and let K be an ideal of L and A a minimal ideal of L. Then,\nwith the same notation as Corollary 3.2,\n8\n(i) K = (K \u2229An)+\u02d9(K \u2229An\u22121)+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9(K \u2229A0);\n(ii) N = An \u2295 (N \u2229An\u22121)\u2295 . . .\u2295 (N \u2229A0);\n(iii) Z(L(i)) = N \u2229Ai for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n; and\n(iv) A \u2286 N \u2229Ai for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nProof. (i) We have that L = An+\u02d9Bn where An = L(n) from the proof of\nCorollary 3.2. It follows from Lemma 3.4 that K = (K \u2229 An) + (K \u2229 Bn).\nBut now K \u2229Bn is an ideal of Bn and Bn = An\u22121+\u02d9Bn\u22121. Applying Lemma\n3.4 again gives K \u2229Bn = (K \u2229An\u22121)+\u02d9(K \u2229Bn\u22121). Continuing in this way\ngives the required result.\n(ii) This is clear from (i), since An = L(n) = N \u2229An.\n(iii) We have that L(i) = L(i+1)+\u02d9Ai from Corollary 3.2, and Z(L(i)) \u2229\nL(i+1) = 0 from Theorem 3.3. Thus, using Lemma 3.4,\nZ(L(i)) = (Z(L(i)) \u2229 L(i+1)) + (Z(L(i)) \u2229Ai) = Z(L(i)) \u2229Ai \u2286 N \u2229Ai.\nIt remains to show that N \u2229 Ai \u2286 Z(L(i)); that is, [N \u2229 Ai, L(i)] = 0.\nLet L be a minimal counter-example. Then Bn = An\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + A0 is a\nsolvable Lie A-algebra with nilradical An\u22121 \u2295N \u2229 An\u22122 \u2295 . . .\u2295N \u2229 A0, so\n[N \u2229Ai, B(i)n ] = [N \u2229Ai, An\u22121+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+Ai] = 0 by the minimality assumption.\nBut [N \u2229 Ai, An] = [N \u2229 Ai, L(n)] \u2286 [N,N ] = 0, whence [N \u2229 Ai, L(i)] =\n[N \u2229Ai, An +An\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+Ai] = 0.\n(iv) We have A \u2286 L(i), A 6\u2286 L(i+1) for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Now [L(i), A] \u2286\n[L(i), L(i)] = L(i+1), so [L(i), A] 6= A. It follows that [L(i), A] = 0, whence\nA \u2286 Z(L(i)) = N \u2229Ai, by (ii).\nThe final result in this section shows when two ideals of a Lie A-algebra\ncentralise each other.\nProposition 3.6 Let L be a Lie A-algebra and let B,D be ideals of L. Then\nB \u2286 ZL(D) if and only if B \u2229D \u2286 Z(B) \u2229 Z(D).\nProof. Suppose first that B \u2286 ZL(D). Then (B \u2229 D)D = (B \u2229 D)B = 0,\nwhence B \u2229D \u2286 Z(B) \u2229 Z(D).\nConversely, suppose that B \u2229D \u2286 Z(B) \u2229 Z(D). Then BD \u2286 B \u2229D \u2286\nZ(B +D) which yields that BD \u2286 (B +D)2 \u2229 Z(B +D) = 0, by Theorem\n3.3. Hence B \u2286 ZL(D).\n9\n4 Strongly solvable Lie A-algebras\nA Lie algebra L is called strongly solvable if L2 is nilpotent. Over a field\nof characteristic zero every solvable Lie algebra is strongly solvable. Clearly\nstrongly solvable Lie A-algebras are metabelian so we would expect stronger\nresults to hold for this class of algebras. First the decomposition theorem\ntakes on a simpler form.\nTheorem 4.1 Let L be a strongly solvable Lie A-algebra with nilradical N .\nThen L = L2+\u02d9B, where L2 is abelian and B is an abelian subalgebra of L,\nand N = L2 \u2295 Z(L).\nProof. We have that L = L2+\u02d9B, where B is an abelian subalgebra of L, by\nTheorem 3.1. Also, L2 is nilpotent and so abelian. Clearly L2 +Z(L) \u2286 N .\nMoreover, N = L2 +N \u2229 B and [N \u2229 B,L] = [N \u2229 B,L2 + B] = 0 so that\nN \u2229B \u2286 Z(L), giving the reverse inclusion.\nNext we see that the minimal ideals are easy to locate.\nTheorem 4.2 Let L = L2+\u02d9B be a strongly solvable Lie A-algebra and let\nA be a minimal ideal of L. Then\n(i) A \u2286 L2 or A \u2286 B;\n(ii) A \u2286 B if and only if A \u2286 Z(L) (in which case dim A = 1); and\n(iii) A \u2286 L2 if and only if [A,L] = A.\nProof. (i) We have that A = (A \u2229 L2)+\u02d9(A \u2229 B), by Theorem 3.5 (i). Since\nA is minimal, either A \u2229 L2 = A or A \u2229 L2 = 0. The former implies that\nA \u2286 L2, and the latter that A \u2286 B.\n(ii) Suppose first that A \u2286 B. Then [A,L] = [A,L2+B] = [A,L2]. Now\n[A,L2] = A implies that A \u2286 L2, a contradiction. It follows that [A,L2] = 0\nand so A \u2286 Z(L).\nNow suppose that A \u2286 Z(L). Then A\u2229L2 \u2286 Z(L)\u2229L2 = 0, by Theorem\n3.3.\n(iii) Suppose that A \u2286 L2. Then [A,L] 6= 0 from (ii), so [A,L] = A. The\nconverse is clear.\n10\nCorollary 4.3 Let L be a strongly solvable Lie A-algebra. Then L is \u03c6-free\nif and only if L2 \u2286 AsocL.\nProof. Suppose first that L is \u03c6-free. Then L2 \u2286 N = AsocL, by [11,\nTheorem 7.4].\nSo suppose now that L2 \u2286 AsocL. Then L splits over AsocL by Theorem\n3.1. But now L is \u03c6-free by [11, Theorem 7.3].\nFinally we can identify the maximal nilpotent subalgebras of L. First\nwe need the following lemma.\nLemma 4.4 Let L be a metabelian Lie algebra, and let U be a maximal\nnilpotent subalgebra of L. Then U \u2229 L2 is an abelian ideal of L and L2 =\n(U \u2229 L2)\u2295K where K is an ideal of L and [U,K] = K.\nProof. Let L = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to adU .\nThen L1 = \u2229\u221ei=1L(adU)i \u2286 L2, and so L1 is an abelian ideal of L. Moreover,\nL2 = (L0 \u2229 L2)+\u02d9L1 and\n[L,L0 \u2229 L2] = [L0 + L1, L0 \u2229 L2] \u2286 (L0 \u2229 L2) + L(3) = L0 \u2229 L2,\nso L0 \u2229L2 is an ideal of L. It follows that U + (L0 \u2229L2) is nilpotent and so\nL0 \u2229 L2 \u2286 U \u2229 L2. The reverse inclusion is clear. Finally put K = L1.\nTheorem 4.5 Let L be a strongly solvable Lie A-algebra, and let U be a\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebra of L. Then U = (U \u2229 L2)\u2295 (U \u2229 C) where C\nis a Cartan subalgebra of L.\nProof. Put U = (U \u2229 L2) \u2295 D, so D is an abelian subalgebra of L. Let\nL = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to adD, and let\nL0 = L20+\u02d9E where E is an abelian subalgebra of L0. Put L\n2 = (U \u2229L2)\u2295K\nas given by Lemma 4.4. Then\nK = [U,K] = [D,K] so K \u2286 L1 and U \u2229 L2 \u2286 L0 \u2229 L2.\nHence\nL0 \u2229 L2 = (U \u2229 L2) + (L0 \u2229 L2 \u2229K) = U \u2229 L2.\nBut L2 = L20 \u2295 [L0, L1], so L0 \u2229 L2 = L20 and\nU = L20 \u2295 (E \u2229 U) = (U \u2229 L2)\u2295 (E \u2229 U).\n11\nNow put E = (E \u2229 L2)\u2295 C where E \u2229 U \u2286 C. Then\nL = L1 + L0 = L2 + L0 = L2 + E = L2+\u02d9C,\nso C is a Cartan subalgebra of L, by Theorem 3.1. Moreover, E\u2229U \u2286 C\u2229U ,\nwhence\nC \u2229 U = (E \u2229 U)\u2295 (C \u2229 U \u2229 L2) = E \u2229 U,\nsince C \u2229 U \u2229 L2 \u2286 C \u2229 (E \u2229 L2) = 0.\n5 Monolithic solvable Lie A-algebras\nMonolithic algebras play a part in the application of A-algebras to the study\nof residually finite varieties, so it seems worthwhile to investigate what extra\nproperties they might have.\nTheorem 5.1 Let L be a monolithic solvable Lie A-algebra of derived length\nn+ 1 with monolith W . Then, with the same notation as Corollary 3.2,\n(i) W is abelian;\n(ii) Z(L) = 0 and [L,W ] =W ;\n(iii) N = An = L(n);\n(iv) N = ZL(W ); and\n(v) L is \u03c6-free if and only if W = N .\nProof. (i) Clearly W \u2286 L(n), which is abelian.\n(ii) If Z(L) 6= 0 then W \u2286 Z(L) \u2229 L2 = 0, by Theorem 3.5, a contra-\ndiction. Hence Z(L) = 0. It follows from this that [L,W ] 6= 0, whence\n[L,W ] =W .\n(iii) We have N = An \u2295 N \u2229 An\u22121 \u2295 . . . \u2295 N \u2229 A0 by Theorem 3.5(i).\nMoreover, N \u2229Ai is an ideal of L for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, by Theorem 3.5(ii).\nBut if N \u2229 Ai 6= 0 then W \u2286 An \u2229N \u2229 Ai = 0 if i 6= n. This contradiction\nyields the result.\n(iv) We have that L = N+\u02d9B for some subalgebra B of L, by Theorem\n3.1 and (iii). Put C = ZL(W ) and note that N \u2286 C. Suppose that N 6= C.\nThen C = N+\u02d9B \u2229 C. Choose A to be a minimal ideal of B \u2229 C, so that A\n12\nis abelian, and let L = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to\nadA. Then\nL1 =\n\u221e\u22c2\ni=1\nL(adA)i \u2286 [[[L,A], A], A] \u2286 [[C,A], A] \u2286 [N +A,A] \u2286 N,\nwhich is abelian. It follows that L1 is an ideal of L and so L1 = 0, since\notherwise W \u2286 L1 \u2229 L0 = 0. This yields that N + A is nilpotent and thus\nabelian, whence A \u2286 ZL(N) \u2286 N , by Lemma 2.4. This contradiction implies\nthat N = C.\n(v) Clearly W = AsocL. Suppose first that L is \u03c6-free. Then W =\nAsocL = N , by [11, Theorem 7.4]. So suppose now that AsocL = W = N .\nThen L splits over AsocL by Theorem 3.1 and (iii). But now L is \u03c6-free by\n[11, Theorem 7.3].\nNote that Example 2.1 is monolithic, so monolithic solvable A-algebras\nare not necessarily metabelian. However, when the Lie A-algebra is strongly\nsolvable the situation is more straightforward.\nTheorem 5.2 Let L be a monolithic strongly solvable Lie A-algebra. Then\nthe maximal nilpotent subalgebras of L are L2 and the Cartan subalgebras of\nL (that is, the subalgebras that are complementary to L2.)\nProof. Let U be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L and let W be the\nmonolith of L. Then L2 = (U \u2229L2)\u2295K where U \u2229L2,K are ideals of L and\n[U,K] = K, by Lemma 4.4. Either W \u2286 U \u2229 L2 and K = 0 or else W \u2286 K\nand U \u2229 L2 = 0.\nIn the former case N = L2 \u2286 U , by Theorem 5.1. But then U \u2286\nZL(N) \u2286 N , by Lemma 2.4, so U = L2. In the latter case U is a Cartan\nsubalgebra of L, by Theorem 4.5.\nFinally we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a monolithic al-\ngebra to be a strongly solvable Lie A-algebra. The next two results are\nessentially Lemma 3 of [8], though the proofs are somewhat different.\nLemma 5.3 Let L = L2+\u02d9B be a metabelian Lie algebra, where B is a\nsubalgebra of L, and suppose that [L2, b] = L2 for all b \u2208 B. Then L is a\nstrongly solvable A-algebra.\n13\nProof. Let U be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L. We have L2 =\n(U \u2229L2)\u2295K where K is an ideal of L and [U,K] = K, by Lemma 4.4. Let\nu = x + b \u2208 U , where x \u2208 L2, b \u2208 B. Then L2 = [L2, b] = [L2, u], so L2 =\nL2(adu)i for all i \u2265 1. It follows that L2 = K from which U2 \u2286 U \u2229 L2 = 0\nand L is an A-algebra.\nTheorem 5.4 Let L be a monolithic Lie algebra. Then L is a strongly\nsolvable A-algebra if and only if L = L2+\u02d9B is metabelian, where B is a\nsubalgebra of L and [L2, b] = L2 for all b \u2208 B (or, equivalently, adb acts\ninvertibly on L2).\nProof. Suppose first that L is a strongly solvable A-algebra. Then L =\nL2+\u02d9B is metabelian, where B is a subalgebra of L, by Theorem 3.1. Let\nb \u2208 B and let L = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to adb.\nIt is easy to see, as in Lemma 4.4, that L2 = (L2 \u2229 L0)+\u02d9L1 and L2 \u2229 L0\nand L1 are ideals of L, so L2 = L2 \u2229L0 or L2 = L1 as L is monolithic. The\nformer implies that [L2, b] = 0, but then L2 and Fb are ideals of L, which is\nimpossible. It follows that L2 = L1, whence [L2, b] = L2. If \u03b8 = adb|L2 then\nL2 = Ker\u03b8+\u02d9Im\u03b8, so Ker\u03b8 = {0} and \u03b8 is invertible.\nThe converse follows from Lemma 5.3.\n6 Solvable A-algebras over an algebraically closed\nfield\nFirst we need the following lemma.\nLemma 6.1 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra over a perfect field F of\ncharacteristic p > 0. Let K be an ideal of L, A a minimal ideal of L\nwith A \u2286 Z(K), and N an ideal of L containing K and such that N\/K \u2286\nN(L\/K), the nilradical of L\/K. Then dim (N\/ZN (A)) \u2264 1.\nProof. Put L\u00af = L\/K and for each x \u2208 L write x\u00af = x +K. Then A is an\nirreducible L\u00af-module, and hence an irreducible U -module, where U is the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of L\u00af. Let \u03c6 be the corresponding representation\nof U and let x\u00af \u2208 L\u00af, n \u2208 N . Then [[x\u00af, n\u00af], n\u00af] = 0\u00af, whence [x\u00af, n\u00afp] = 0 and so\nn\u00afp \u2208 Z = Z(U).\n14\nLet n1, n2 \u2208 N . Then n\u00afp1, n\u00afp2 \u2208 Z, so \u03b11n\u00afp1 + \u03b12n\u00afp2 \u2208 ker(\u03c6), for some\n\u03b11, \u03b12 \u2208 F , since dim \u03c6(Z) \u2264 1, by Schur\u2019s Lemma. Since F is perfect,\nthere are \u03b21, \u03b22 \u2208 F such that \u03b11 = \u03b2p1 , \u03b12 = \u03b2p2 , so (\u03b21n\u00af1 + \u03b22n\u00af2)p =\n\u03b2p1 n\u00af\np\n1+\u03b2\np\n2 n\u00af\np\n2 \u2208 ker(\u03c6), since [n\u00af1, n\u00af2] = 0\u00af. It follows that A+F (\u03b21n1+\u03b22n2)\nis a nilpotent subalgebra of L and hence abelian. Thus \u03b21n\u00af1+\u03b22n\u00af2 \u2208 ker(\u03c6)\nand so dim \u03c6(N\u00af) \u2264 1. Hence ZN (A) has codimension at most 1 in N .\nThe following result was proved by Drensky in [3]. We include a proof\nsince, as far as we know, no English translation of the proof has appeared.\nTheorem 6.2 Let L be a solvable Lie A-algebra over an algebraically closed\nfield F . Then the derived length of L is at most 3.\nProof. Suppose the result is false. Then there is such an algebra L of\nderived length 4. First note that we can assume that the ground field is\nof characteristic p > 0, since otherwise L is strongly solvable and so of\nderived length at most 2. Let A be a minimal ideal of L contained in L(3).\nThen, putting K = L(3), N = L(2) in Lemma 6.1, we deduce that dim\n(L(2)\/ZL(2)(A)) \u2264 1.\nSuppose that dim (L(2)\/ZL(2)(A)) = 1. Put S = L\/ZL(2)(A). Then\ndim(S(2)) = 1. It follows that S\/ZL(S(2)) \u2286 Der(S(2)) and so has dimension\nat most one, giving [S(1), S(2)] = 0. But now S(1) is nilpotent but not\nabelian. As S must be an A-algebra, this is a contradiction. We therefore\nhave that dim (L(2)\/ZL(2)(A)) = 0, whence [A,L\n(2)] = 0.\nSince the field F is algebraically closed there is a chain of ideals of L,\n0 = A0 \u2282 A1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 Ar = L(3), where dimAi = i for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. By the\nabove we have [Ai, L(2)] \u2286 Ai\u22121 for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. It follows that L(3)+Fx\nis a nilpotent subalgebra of L for each x \u2208 L(2), whence [L(3), L(2)] = 0.\nThis means that L(2) is a nilpotent subalgebra of L and hence abelian. We\ninfer that L(3) = 0, a contradiction, and so the result follows.\nUsing the above we can examine in more detail the structure of mono-\nlithic Lie A-algebras.\nTheorem 6.3 Let L be a monolithic solvable Lie A-algebra of dimension\ngreater than one over an algebraically closed field F , with monolithW . Then\neither\n(i) L = L2+\u02d9Fb where L2 is abelian and L2(ad b\u2212\u03bb1)k = 0 for some k > 0\nand some 0 6= \u03bb \u2208 F , and dimW = 1; or\n15\n(ii) F has characteristic p > 0, dimW = p and L = L(2)+\u02d9B where\nL(2) is abelian, B = Fb + Fn, [n, b] = n, L(2)(adn \u2212 \u03bb1)k = 0 and\nL(2)((ad b)p\u2212 ad b\u2212\u00b5p1)k = 0 for some k > 0 and some 0 6= \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 F .\nProof. Suppose first that L is strongly solvable. Then L = L2+\u02d9B where\nL2 is abelian, B is an abelian subalgebra and W \u2286 L2. Now W is an\nirreducible B-module and so one dimensional, by [10, Lemma 5.6]. Now\nL\/ZL(W ) is isomorphic to a subalgebra of Der(W ) and so N = ZL(W ) has\ncodimension at most one in L. It follows that L is abelian (and hence one\ndimensional) or dimB = 1 and N = L2. Decompose L2 into adB-invariant\nsubspaces. Each is an ideal of L and so there can be only one. It follows\nthat L2(ad b\u2212\u03bb1)k = 0 for some k > 0 and some 0 6= \u03bb \u2208 F , where B = Fb,\ngiving case (i).\nSo suppose now that L2 is not nilpotent. Then F has characteristic p > 0,\nL has derived length 3 andW \u2286 L(2). Let N\/L(2) be the nilradical of L\/L(2).\nThen applying Lemma 6.1 with K = L(2) we see that dim (N\/ZN (W )) \u2264 1.\nBut ZL(W ) = L(2) \u2286 N by Theorem 5.1(iv), so ZN (W ) = L(2). As L(1) \u2286 N\nwe cannot have N = L(2), so dim (N\/L(2)) = 1; say N = L(2)+\u02d9Fn.\nPut L = L(2)+\u02d9B where B is a subalgebra of L containing n, and let\nC = ZB(Fn). Then C is a nilpotent ideal of B and so C = Fn. It follows\nthat B\/Fn = B\/C has dimension at most one, and so dimB \u2264 2. As B is\nnot abelian we have B = Fn+Fb where [n, b] = n. This algebra has a unique\np-map making it into a restricted Lie algebra: namely b[p] = b, n[p] = 0 (see\n[10]). We can decompose L(2) = \u2295\u03bb,SV\u03bb,S where \u03bb \u2208 (Fn)\u2217, S \u2208 B\u2217 and\nV\u03bb,S = {x \u2208 L(2) : x(adn\u2212\u03bb(n)1)k = 0 and x((ad b)p\u2212ad b\u2212S(b)p1)k = 0}\nby [10, page 236]. As each V\u03bb,S is an ideal of L there can be only one of\nthem. The fact that dimW = p follows from [10, Example 1, page 244], so\nwe have case (ii).\nCorollary 6.4 If, in addition to the hypotheses of Theorem 6.3, L is also\n\u03c6-free, then either\n(i) L is two-dimensional non-abelian; or\n(ii) F has characteristic p > 0 and L is isomorphic to the algebra in\nExample 2.1.\n16\nProof. Case (i) follows from Theorem 6.3 (i) because W = L2 by Theorem\n5.1. If case (ii) of Theorem 5.1 holds, then F has characteristic p > 0,\ndimW = p and L =W +\u02d9B whereW is abelian, B = Fb+Fn and [n, b] = n.\nLet \u03bb be an eigenvalue for (ad b)|W , so [w, b] = \u03bbw for some w \u2208 W . Then\n[w(adn)i, b] = (\u03bb + i)w(adn)i for every i, so putting wi = w(adn)i we\nsee that Fw0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Fwp\u22121 is B-stable and hence equal to W . We then\nhave [wi, b] = (\u03bb + i)wi, [wi, n] = wi+1 (indices modulo p). But now the\ncharacteristic polynomial of ad (b+ \u03b1n) is (x\u2212 \u03bb)p \u2212 (x\u2212 \u03bb)\u2212 \u03b1p and this\nis divisible by x precisely when \u03b1p = \u03bb \u2212 \u03bbp. It follows that by choosing \u03b1\nsatisfying this equation and replacing b by b+ \u03b1n we can take \u03bb = 0. This\ngives the algebra in Example 2.1.\nNote: alternatively, it can be deduced that W has the form claimed in\n(ii) by using [10, Example 1, page 244].\nFinally we seek describe the structure of \u03c6-free solvable Lie A-algebras\nover an algebraically closed field. The strongly solvable ones are easily de-\nscribed.\nTheorem 6.5 Let L be a \u03c6-free strongly solvable Lie A-algebra over an\nalgebraically closed field F . Then\nL =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nFai +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nFbi where [ai, bj ] = \u03bbijai\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, other products being zero.\nProof. If L is strongly solvable then it is elementary, by [13, Theorem 2.5],\nand hence as described in (i), by [13, Theorem 3.2 (2)]. (The restriction on\nthe characteristic in that result is not required for the solvable case.)\nThe \u03c6-free solvable Lie A-algebras that are not strongly solvable are\nmore complicated.\nTheorem 6.6 Let L be a \u03c6-free solvable Lie algebra, over an algebraically\nclosed field F , that is not strongly solvable. Then L is an A-algebra if and\nonly if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) L = L(2)+\u02d9C+\u02d9B, where B, C are abelian subalgebras of L and L(1) =\nL(2)+\u02d9C;\n17\n(ii) B+\u02d9C is a strongly solvable \u03c6-free Lie A-algebra (and hence given by\nTheorem 6.5);\n(iii) L(2) = A1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 An, where Ai is a minimal ideal of L of dimension\np for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; and\n(iv) for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, there exists ci \u2208 C, bi \u2208 B and a basis ai1, . . . , aip\nfor Ai such that C = ZC(Ai) \u2295 Fci, B = ZB(Ai) \u2295 Fbi, [ci, bi] = ci,\n[aij , ci] = ai(j+1) (indices modulo p) and [aij , b] = (\u03bbi + j)aij for 1 \u2264\nj \u2264 p and some \u03bbi \u2208 F .\nProof. Suppose first that L is a \u03c6-free solvable Lie A-algebra that is not\nstrongly solvable. Then F has characteristic p > 0, L = L(2)+\u02d9C+\u02d9B where\nL(2) is abelian, B, C are abelian subalgebras of L and L(1) = L(2)+\u02d9C, by\nTheorem 6.2 and Corollary 3.2; this is (i). Moreover, L(2) \u2286 N(L) = Asoc\nL , by [11, Theorem 7.4], so we can put L(2) = A1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 An, where Ai\nis a minimal ideal of L for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Put Li = Ai+\u02d9C+\u02d9B. Then\nL\n(1)\ni = Ai+\u02d9C and L\n(2)\ni = Ai, so [C,B] = C and [Ai, C] = Ai.\nSuppose first that dimAi = 1. Then dimLi\/ZLi(Ai) \u2264 1. If Ai+\u02d9C =\nL\n(1)\ni \u2286 ZLi(Ai) then Ai = [Ai, C] = 0, a contradiction; so C 6\u2286 ZLi(Ai). But\nZLi(Ai) = Ai+\u02d9(ZLi(Ai)\u2229C)+\u02d9(ZLi(Ai)\u2229B), by Theorem 3.5, so ZLi(Ai)\u2229\nB = B, giving [Ai, B] = 0. Hence Ai = [Ai, C] = [Ai, [C,B]] \u2286 [C, [B,Ai]] +\n[B, [Ai, C]] = 0, a contradiction again. It follows that dimAi 6= 1.\nPut Z = ZC(Ai)+\u02d9ZB(Ai) and L\u00afi = Li\/Z. We claim that L\u00afi is monolithic\nand \u03c6-free.\nLet D\u00af = D\/Z be an ideal of L\u00afi and suppose that A\u00afi = (Ai+Z)\/Z 6\u2286 D\u00af.\nThen [Ai, D] \u2286 Ai \u2229 D = 0, so D \u2286 ZLi(Ai) \u2229 D = (Ai + Z) \u2229 D =\n(Ai \u2229 D) + Z = Z. It follows that L\u00afi is monolithic with monolith A\u00afi.\nLet U\u00af = U\/Z be the nilradical of L\u00afi. Then A\u00afi \u2286 U\u00af , so Ai \u2286 U and\n[Ai, U ] \u2286 Ai \u2229 Z = 0. This yields that U \u2286 Ai + Z, whence U\u00af = A\u00afi.\nTheorem 5.1(v) now implies that L\u00afi is \u03c6-free.\nNext put D = C+\u02d9B. Then D\/Z is two dimensional, by Corollary 6.4,\nand so \u03c6-free, whence \u03c6(D) \u2286 Z\u2229C = ZC(Ai) for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. It follows\nthat \u03c6(D) is an ideal of L and hence that \u03c6(D) \u2286 \u03c6(L) = 0, by [11, Lemma\n4.1]. This establishes (ii).\nNow D is elementary, by [13, Theorem 2.5], and so splits over each of its\nideals, by Lemma 2.3 of [12]. This yields thatD = Z+\u02d9E for some subalgebra\nE of D, whence Ai+\u02d9E \u223c= L\u00afi has the form given in Corollary 6.4. Assertions\n(iii) and (iv) now follow.\n18\nNow suppose that conditions (i)-(iv) are satisfied. Adopting the same\nnotation as above we have that Li\/Z is an A-algebra, by (iv), and that Li\/Ai\nis an A-algebra, by (ii). It follows that Li is an A-algebra, by Lemma 2.2.\nAs this is true for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n repeated use of Lemma 2.2 yields that L\nis an A-algebra.\nReferences\n[1] Bakhturin, Yu.
