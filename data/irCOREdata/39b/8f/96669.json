This injection velocity is assumed to be much larger than that in a\nconventional Prandtl boundary layer, so that inertial effects dominate. After applying\nthe classical \u2018blowhard\u2019 theory of Cole & Aroesty (1968) to the two-dimensional ver-\nsion of the problem, it is shown that in three dimensions the flow may be foliated\ninto streamline surfaces using Lagrangian variables. An example is given of how this\nmay be exploited to solve the three-dimensional problem when the injection pressure\ndistribution is known.\n1. Introduction\nSeveral solidification processes arising in the glass industry rely on the idea of float-\ning a glass workpiece above a rigid porous medium through which air is injected at a\nsuitably high pressure. Depending on the geometry and the flow parameters, several\nfluid mechanics regimes are possible; the airflow may be dominated by either inertial\nor viscous forces and this flow may couple with the glass flow when the workpiece has\nsufficiently low viscosity. Even when viscous forces are not dominant, there are several\ntheories available to describe the mechanics of steady floating. Our starting point is\nthe \u2018blowhard\u2019 theory of boundary layers with strong injection (Cole & Aroesty\n1968). This theory, which is described below, considers boundary layer injection that\nis so strong that the transverse velocity greatly exceeds that in a traditional Prandtl\nboundary layer. For problems in which the flow is constrained to lie in a thin layer\nbetween two boundaries, one of which is porous, a theory can be constructed in which\ninertial and viscous forces are in balance, as in a traditional boundary layer (see for\nexample Petit 1986; Hinch & Lema\u0131\u02c6tre 1994; Cox 2002). However, analytical progress\nis possible only in geometries that are symmetric enough for similarity solutions to\nbe obtained. In the viscous-dominated limit, these solutions tend to those of classical\nlubrication theory and in the inertia-dominated limit, they will be seen to agree with\nthe theory presented below.\nIn this note, we will describe some models for the basic dynamics of the airflow\nunder the assumptions that inertial effects dominate, that air compressibility is\nnegligible and that the workpiece can be assumed to be a rigid or flexible solid\nplate levitating a small distance above a horizontal porous base. Even with these\nsimplifications, the flow modelling and analysis offer some interesting theoretical\nchallenges. As shown in \u00a7 2, these may be easily overcome in the two-dimensional\ncase; in \u00a7 3 we will describe how some progress may be made in three-dimensional\nfloating despite the complexity of the governing system of hyperbolic equations. The\nremainder of the introduction is devoted to setting up the models and reviewing some\nbackground theory.\n166 A. D. Fitt, G. Kozyreff and J. R. Ockendon\nz\ny\nx\nLevitating plate: z = Hh(x, y, t)\nPorous base:  z = 0\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the geometry and glass sheet.\nAs shown in figure 1, the surface of the porous base is taken to be z=0 and we\nassume that an injection velocity is generated by a pumping mechanism that delivers\nair at a known flow rate that depends on x and y with no feedback from the pressure\nvariation in the (x, y)-plane. Neglecting viscous, compressible and gravitational forces,\nthe steady air velocity between the base and the workpiece is (u, v,w), where\nu\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n+ w\n\u2202u\n\u2202z\n= \u2212 1\n\u03c1\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n, (1.1)\nu\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n+ w\n\u2202v\n\u2202z\n= \u2212 1\n\u03c1\n\u2202p\n\u2202y\n, (1.2)\nu\n\u2202w\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202w\n\u2202y\n+ w\n\u2202w\n\u2202z\n= \u2212 1\n\u03c1\n\u2202p\n\u2202z\n, (1.3)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n+\n\u2202w\n\u2202z\n= 0. (1.4)\nHere, the constant air density is denoted by \u03c1 and p denotes pressure. We further\nassume that the base is perforated in such a way that the air emerges normally, so\nthat\nu = v = 0, w = Ww0(x, y)\nat z=0, where W measures a typical injection velocity.\nIn writing (1.1)\u2013(1.3), we have made the crucial assumption that W is larger than\nthe transverse velocity in the Prandtl boundary layer that will be generated at the\nworkpiece; this means that the flow in the levitation gas layer is inviscid to lowest\norder, even though the layer is thin. Finally, we assume no normal flow across the\nbase of the workpiece z=Hh(x, y) (where H is a typical \u2018ride height\u2019) and an ambient\npressure p0 around the periphery of the workpiece, which must be an isobar.\nThe floating regime is one in which \u03b5=H\/L is small, where L is a typical horizontal\ndimension of the workpiece. An estimate of \u03b5 is obtained by balancing \u03c1u2 \u223c \u03c1W 2\u03b5\u22122\nwith the hydrostatic pressure \u03c1gga caused by the workpiece, \u03c1g being its density and\na its thickness. Thus \u03b52 \u223c \u03c1W 2\/(\u03c1gga).

Two-dimensional flow\n2.1. The Cole & Aroesty theory\nFollowing the procedure in Cole & Aroesty (1968), when v=0 and all variables are\nindependent of y, we may solve the hyperbolic system\nu\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+ w\n\u2202u\n\u2202z\n= \u2212dp\ndx\n,\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202w\n\u2202z\n= 0, (2.1)\nwith w=w0(x) at z=0 by introducing the variable x\n\u2217 which denotes the x-station at\nwhich the streamline passing through (x, z) emerges from the porous base at z=0.\nWhen x\u2217 is constant, the first equation of (2.1) may be written(\nu\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n+ w\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n)(\np + 1\n2\nu2\n)\n= 0\nand hence, when x and x\u2217 are regarded as independent variables rather than x and z\n(and with a slight abuse of notation),\np(x) + 1\n2\nu2(x, x\u2217) = p(x\u2217), (2.2)\nsince u=0 when x = x\u2217 (figure 2). Moreover, conservation of mass in the shaded\nregion of figure 2 implies that\u222b x\nx\u2217\nw0(s) ds =\n\u222b z\n0\nu(x, \u03be ) d\u03be,\nthe right-hand-side integral being taken with respect to the vertical coordinate. Hence,\nwhen z is regarded as a function of (x, x\u2217) along a streamline, we can differentiate\nwith respect to x\u2217 to find the relationship between the streamline height, p, and w0.\nThus\n\u2202z\n\u2202x\u2217\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=const\n=\n\u2212w0(x\u2217)\nu\n=\n\u2212w0(x\u2217)\u221a\n2(p(x\u2217) \u2212 p(x)) . (2.3)\nNow assuming that there is a dividing streamline emerging from x = z=0 (so that\nz=h(x) corresponds to x\u2217 =0) and since, by definition, x = x\u2217 on z=0, we find that\nh(x) =\n\u222b x\n0\nw0(s)\u221a\n2(p(s) \u2212 p(x)) ds.

Conservation of mass for the transformation (x, z)\u2192 (x, x\u2217).\nThis generalized Abel integral equation may easily be solved for w0 as a function\nof p and h, but a more practical case arises when we know w0 and h and wish to find\nthe pressure p. Viewed in this way, (2.4) is nonlinear. Let us suppose that p(x) is a\nstrictly monotone decreasing differentiable function with non-zero derivative over the\ninterval 0<x < 1, and that h(0) is finite. After the change of variables p(s)=p(0)\u2212 S,\np(x)=p(0)\u2212X and the definitions\nG(X) = \u2212 w0(x)\u221a\n2p\u2032(x)\n, H(X) = h(x),\nequation (2.4) may then be rewritten as the Abel equation\nH(X) =\n\u222b X\n0\nG(S)\u221a\nX \u2212 S dS. (2.5)\nEquation (2.5) may be inverted, for example by Laplace transform methods (see for\nexample Carrier, Crook & Pearson 1966), yielding\nG(X) = H(0)\n\u03c0\n\u221a\nX\n+\n\u222b X\n0\nH\u2032(S)\n\u03c0\n\u221a\nX \u2212 S dS.\nIn general this does not seem to allow any analytical progress to be made for a\ngeneral h(x), as the unknown function p appears in the argument of H. However,\nin the special case when h(x) is identically equal to a constant h0, the last expression\ncan be rewritten as a differential equation for p, which is\n\u2212w0(x)\u221a\n2p\u2032(x)\n=\nh0\n\u03c0\n\u221a\np(0) \u2212 p(x) ,\nwith solution\np(x) = p(0) \u2212 \u03c0\n2\n8h20\n(\u222b x\n0\nw0(s) ds\n)2\n.\nFinally, the constants p(0) and h0 are determined by the boundary condition\np(1)= 0, and the requirement that\n\u222b 1\n\u22121 p(x) dx balances the weight of the lid. Given\nthe density \u03c1g , the thickness a of the glass sheet and the gravitational acceleration\ng, the weight of the workpiece per unit length in the y-direction is 2\u03c1ggaL. After\nInertial levitation 169\nnon-dimensionalization, this weight is MG = \u03b5\n22\u03c1gga\/\u03c1W\n2 so that\np(0) =\n\u03c02\n8h20\n(\u222b 1\n0\nw0(s) ds\n)2\n, MG = 2p(0) \u2212 \u03c0\n2\n8h20\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(\u222b x\n0\nw0(s) ds\n)2\ndx.\nAs an example, let us assume a uniform inlet velocity w0. In this case\np(x) =\n\u03c02w20\n8h20\n(1 \u2212 x2),\nand\nh0 =\n\u03c0w0\u221a\n6MG\n. (2.6)\nFrom (2.2), it then follows that\nu(x, x\u2217) =\n\u03c0w0\n2h0\n\u221a\nx2 \u2212 x\u22172,\nwhile (2.3) leads to\nz = h0\n[\n1 \u2212 arcsin(x\n\u2217\/x)\n\u03c0\/2\n]\n.\nHence x\u2217 = x cos(\u03c0z\/2h0) and\nu(x, z) =\n\u03c0w0\n2h0\nx sin\n(\n\u03c0z\n2h0\n)\n.\nFinally, integration of the continuity equation yields\nw(x, z) = w0 cos\n(\n\u03c0z\n2h0\n)\n,\nthus completing the solution of (2.1). For completeness, we note from (2.6) that the\ndimensional ride height is\nH = \u03c0\n(\n\u03c1W 2\n12\u03c1gga\n)1\/2\nL.\n3. Three-dimensional flow\nIt does not seem possible in general to isolate a closed-form equation such as (2.4)\nfor the pressure p as a function of the floating height h. Fortunately, the inverse\nproblem of finding h from p is more tractable, as we show in this section. Having\ncomputed h[p(x, y)], one could in principle devise an iterative algorithm to invert\nthis operation.\nFirst, we solve the problem for the velocity components (u, v) and, for this purpose,\nwe write equations (1.5) to (1.8) in Lagrangian variables. Let the functions\nx = x(x\u2217, y\u2217, t), y = y(x\u2217, y\u2217, t), z = z(x\u2217, y\u2217, t) (3.1)\nbe such that x(x\u2217, y\u2217, 0)= x\u2217, y(x\u2217, y\u2217, 0)= y\u2217, z(x\u2217, y\u2217, 0)= 0, and that (u, v,w)=\n(\u2202x\/\u2202t, \u2202y\/\u2202t, \u2202z\/\u2202t)= \u2202x\/\u2202t , say. The momentum equations (1.5) and (1.6) become\n\u22022x\n\u2202t2\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202x\n,\n\u22022y\n\u2202t2\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202y\n, (3.2)\nwith \u2202x\/\u2202t = \u2202y\/\u2202t =0 at t =0 and, given p(x, y), they form a closed system.\n170 A.

Streamlines passing above the point P =(x, y)= ( 3\n2\n, 1) for the pressure distribution\n(3.7) with p0, \u03ba =\n1\n2\n. They emerge vertically from the locus of entry points \u0393 (P ).\nThe next step is to compute the vertical flow, which we do using conservation of\nmass. This can be expressed by considering the volume of an element of fluid emerging\nfrom a surface element dx\u2217 dy\u2217 in a time dt . This volume is initially w0dx\u2217 dy\u2217 dt and\nsubsequently becomes Jdx\u2217 dy\u2217 dt where J =(\u2202x\/\u2202t) \u00b7 (\u2202x\/\u2202x\u2217 \u2227 \u2202x\/\u2202y\u2217). Equating\nthe two gives\n\u2202(x, y, z)\n\u2202(x\u2217, y\u2217, t)\n= w0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217), (3.3)\nwhich, assuming (3.2) has been solved, is a linear first-order partial differential\nequation for the function z(x\u2217, y\u2217, t), namely\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(y\u2217, t)\n\u2202z\n\u2202x\u2217\n+\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(t, x\u2217)\n\u2202z\n\u2202y\u2217\n+\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(x\u2217, y\u2217)\n\u2202z\n\u2202t\n= w0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217). (3.4)\nKnowing z(x\u2217, y\u2217, t), the ride height h at a point (x, y) is then found from the limiting\nstreamline x(x\u2217, y\u2217, t) that passes tangentially to the glass sheet above that point. If\nwe suppose that\n\u2202x\n\u2202t\n(0, 0, t) =\n\u2202y\n\u2202t\n(0, 0, t) = 0,\nthen\nh(x, y) = lim\nx\u2217,y\u2217\u21920,t\u2192\u221e z(x\n\u2217, y\u2217, t),\nin which the limit is taken with the constraint that x and y remain fixed in (3.1), i.e.\nwe let x\u2217 and y\u2217 tend to the origin along the locus of entering streamlines for the\npoint (x, y). This locus is denoted by \u0393 in figure 3.\nThe solution of (3.4) is given by solving the characteristic equations\ndx\u2217\n\u2202(x, y)\/\u2202(y\u2217, t)\n=\ndy\u2217\n\u2202(x, y)\/\u2202(t, x\u2217)\n=\ndt\n\u2202(x, y)\/\u2202(x\u2217, y\u2217)\n=\ndz\nw0(x\u2217, y\u2217)\n, (3.5)\nwhich in fact comprise the streamlines through the points (x, y, z), where x and y are\nfixed and 0<z<h(x, y).\nInertial levitation 171\nWe note that h(x, y) is simply\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(dz\/dt) dt , and, denoting \u2202(x, y)\/\u2202(x\u2217, y\u2217) by\nJ(x\u2217, y\u2217, t), we thus have\nh(x, y) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nw0[x\n\u2217(x, y, t), y\u2217(x, y, t)]\nJ[x\u2217(x, y, t), y\u2217(x, y, t), t] dt. (3.6)\nIn the Appendix, we present an alternative description of this foliation of the stream-\nlines that offers an interesting analogy between the present flow and ray theory in\noptics.\n3.1. Illustrative solution\nTo illustrate our point, we now consider the pressure profile\np = p0(1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 \u03ba2y2). (3.7)\nThe isobars are elliptic and, since the pressure is ambient at the boundary, we\nimplicitly assume an elliptic shape for the workpiece. Equations (3.2) are linear, with\nsolution\nx = x\u2217 cosh \u03c4, y = y\u2217 cosh \u03ba\u03c4,\nwhere time has been rescaled using \u03c4 =\n\u221a\n2p0t for convenience. Equation (3.4) then\nbecomes\n\u2212x\u2217 sinh \u03c4 cosh \u03ba\u03c4 \u2202z\n\u2202x\u2217\n\u2212 \u03bay\u2217 sinh \u03ba\u03c4 cosh \u03c4 \u2202z\n\u2202y\u2217\n+ cosh \u03c4 cosh \u03ba\u03c4\n\u2202z\n\u2202\u03c4\n=\nw0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217)\u221a\n2p0\n,\nand the characteristic equations are\n\u2212dx\u2217\nx\u2217 sinh \u03c4 cosh \u03ba\u03c4\n=\n\u2212dy\u2217\n\u03bay\u2217 sinh \u03ba\u03c4 cosh \u03c4\n=\nd\u03c4\ncosh \u03c4 cosh \u03ba\u03c4\n=\n\u221a\n2p0 dz\nw0(x\u2217, y\u2217)\n.\nHence, on a characteristic, x\u2217 = x sech \u03c4 , y\u2217 = y sech \u03ba\u03c4 , and\ndz\nd\u03c4\n=\nw0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217)\u221a\n2p0\nsech \u03c4 sech \u03ba\u03c4.\nHence,\nz =\n1\u221a\n2p0\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nw0(x sech \u03c4\n\u2032, y sech \u03ba\u03c4 \u2032) sech \u03c4 \u2032 sech \u03ba\u03c4 \u2032 d\u03c4 \u2032,\nand h(x, y)= lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e z, keeping x and y fixed, i.e.\nh(x, y) =\n1\u221a\n2p0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nw0(x sech \u03c4, y sech \u03ba\u03c4 ) sech \u03c4 sech \u03ba\u03c4 d\u03c4. (3.8)\nConsequently, as in two-dimensional flows, a constant inlet velocity and a pressure\nprofile of the form (3.7) lead to a uniform elevation h(x, y).\nSimilarly to \u00a7 2, by equating the pressure integrated over the workpiece with its\nweight, we find that p0 = 2\t\n2\u03c1gga\/(\u03c1W\n2), so that the dimensional ride height for\nelliptic workpieces with area A=\u03c0L2\/\u03ba is\nH =\n(\n\u03c1W 2A\n4\u03c0\u03c1gga\n)1\/2 \u221a\n\u03ba\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsech \u03c4 sech \u03ba\u03c4 d\u03c4.\nIn the case \u03ba =1, the integral above equals one, which is consistent with the similarity\nsolutions in Hinch & Lema\u0131\u02c6tre (1994) and Cox (2002) in the zero viscosity limit.\nThis analysis depends crucially on the pressure having a maximum at the stagnation\npoint. It is easy to see that if it had a saddle, then the integral in (3.8) would\n172 A. D. Fitt, G. Kozyreff and J. R. Ockendon\ndiverge; for example, if (3.7) is replaced by p=p0(1 \u2212 x2 + \u03ba2y2), then dz\/d\u03c4 =\n(w0\/\n\u221a\n2p0) sech \u03c4 sec \u03ba\u03c4 . Indeed, if there is any direction through a stagnation point\nin which the pressure has a minimum, we can easily see from the dynamical system\n(3.2) that the Jacobian \u2202(x, y)\/\u2202(x\u2217, y\u2217) will vanish. Hence, our theory will only be\nacceptable under the conditions that (i) there is only one stagnation point, (ii) the\npressure has a maximum there. It would be interesting to know what constraint these\nconditions put on the perimeter of the workpiece.\n4. Concluding remarks\nWe have presented a theory which, in principle, describes the complicated rotational\nflow that occurs in three-dimensional floating, where viscous and unsteady effects are\nignored. Our theory gives physically acceptable predictions only in the case where\nthere is only one stagnation point for the horizontal velocity (u, v) and, in addition,\nthe pressure has a maximum at that stagnation point.\nAnother deficiency of the theory is that, from (3.3), it cannot describe flows in which\nthe injection velocity is zero or negative over any region of the base plate. Hence the\ntheory cannot, as it stands, apply to injection through discrete holes in the base plate.\nOf course, if air were blown through a single hole of sufficient radius in the base\nplate, levitation could not occur because of the pressure drop as the air accelerates\nin the layer. In fact, it is possible to support a plate by this method by placing the\nbase plate above the workpiece. It can also be supported in such an upside-down\nconfiguration by suction through the base plate, and this technique is also used in the\nglass industry. However such suction flows are not reversals of those described above.\nFinally, we regret that we have been unable to present any stability analysis for our\nflow. Intuitively, it is likely that a horizontal plate levitated under gravity will be stable\nbecause the levitation pressure will be roughly proportional to h\u22122(t), assuming quasi-\nstatic flow. A tilting plate may be unstable in inviscid theory and, indeed, \u2018see-sawing\u2019\nplates have been observed in practice (Hinch & Lema\u0131\u02c6tre, private communication).\nWe would like to thank Professor E. J. Hinch for valuable comments.\nAppendix\nWe can reformulate the two-dimensional problem (2.1) in terms of the function\nz=Z(x, s), which denotes the vertical displacement of a streamline. The independent\nvariable s is required to be constant on a streamline and may be chosen to\nbe x\u2217. Transforming the dependent variables from (u,w, p) to (u,Z, p) and the\nindependent variables from (x, z) to (x, s), we find that w= u\u2202Z\/\u2202x, and conservation\nof momentum and mass now become\nu\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n= \u2212dp\ndx\n,\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nu\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n)\n= 0,\nwith\nZ(s, s) = 0, u(s, s) = 0, w(s, s) = w0(s).\nIn this form, both equations may be integrated explicitly. While the former leads to\nthe Bernoulli relation (2.2), the latter gives\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n=\nc(s)\nu(x, s)\n, (A 1)\nInertial levitation 173\nwhere the function c(s) is obtained from the boundary condition on w on Z=0.\nNoting that (\u2202Z\/\u2202s)(s, s)=\u2212 (\u2202Z\/\u2202x)(s, s), we have c(s)= limx\u2192s u(x, s)(\u2202Z\/\u2202s)=\n\u2212w0(s), which leads to equation (2.3) and the ensuing developments.\nIn three dimensions, let us foliate the flow into stream surfaces (surfaces composed\nof streamlines). To this end, we write z=Z(x, y, s), where now s is any independent\nvariable that is constant on a stream surface, so that w= u\u2202Z\/\u2202x + v\u2202Z\/\u2202y. Then\n(1.5)\u2013(1.8) become respectively\nu\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202x\n, u\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202y\n, 0 = \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202s\n, (A 2)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n+\n(\nu\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n+ v\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n)\nlog\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n= 0, (A 3)\nand we soon find from (A2) that p+ 1\n2\n(u2 + v2) is constant on a streamline. It is\nconvenient to define the curves s =const in the (x, y)-plane as the level curves of p,\nso that\np(x, y) + 1\n2\n[u2(x, y, s) + v2(x, y, s)] = s. (A 4)\nIn this way, the total head of the flow is uniform on each stream surface. As a\nresult, the projection of the flow on the (x, y)-plane for s fixed is irrotational, for,\ndifferentiating (A 4) with respect to x and comparing it to the first equation of (A 2),\nwe find that \u2202u\/\u2202y = \u2202v\/\u2202x. Hence, we may write\n(u, v) = \u2207\u03c6(x, y, s),\nwhere \u2207 \u2261 (\u2202\/\u2202x, \u2202\/\u2202y). In terms of the velocity potential \u03c6, the Bernoulli equation\n(A 4) becomes\n1\n2\n|\u2207\u03c6(x, y, s)|2 = s \u2212 p(x, y), (A 5)\nwhich is the eikonal equation in optics for rays in an inhomogeneous medium. On\nthe other hand, the continuity equation becomes\n\u22072\u03c6 + \u2207\u03c6 \u00b7 \u2207 log \u2202Z\n\u2202s\n= 0,\nwhich is just the transport equation of optics, where the term 1\n2\n\u2202Z\/\u2202s plays the role\nof the field amplitude.\nFor a given pressure distribution and a fixed value of s, (A 5) has the characteristic\nequations\n\u2202x\n\u2202t\n= u,\n\u2202y\n\u2202t\n= v,\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202x\n,\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u2202p\n\u2202y\n, (A 6)\nas in (3.2) and (3.5), where t parameterizes the characteristics, which are simply the\nprojections of the streamlines in the (x, y)-plane. Taking r to be a coordinate along\nthe curves s =const, the initial conditions for x(r, s, t), y(r, s, t), u(r, s, t), and v(r, s, t)\nare\nx = x\u2217(r, s), y = y\u2217(r, s), u = v = 0,\nat t = 0, where, as before, x\u2217 and y\u2217 denote the coordinates of the point of entry of\nthe streamline through (x, y, z). On a characteristic,\n\u22072\u03c6 + \u2202\n\u2202t\nlog\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n(x(r, s, t), y(r, s, t), s) = 0. (A 7)\n174 A. D. Fitt, G. Kozyreff and J. R. Ockendon\nAt t =0, the function Z satisfies\nZ(x(r, s, 0), y(r, s, 0), s) = 0,\n\u2202Z\n\u2202t\n(x(r, s, 0), y(r, s, 0), s) = w0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217). (A 8)\nAs in \u00a7 3, by solving (A 6) for a given p(x, y), we can in principle obtain x, y, u, and\nv as functions of r , s, and t . For fixed s, the chain rule and (A 6) combine to give\n\u22072\u03c6 = \u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nlog\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(r, t)\n.\nSubstituting this result in (A 7), we thus obtain\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(r, t)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n= c(r, s),\nwhich is the three-dimensional counterpart of (A 1). The function c(r, s) is obtained\nin the same way as in the two-dimensional case by examining this equation on the\nplane z=0. We have\nZ(x(r, s, t), y(r, s, t), s) = 0 at t = 0.\nDifferentiating this expression once with respect to r , s, and t , successively, gives\nlim\nt\u21920\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(r, t)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n= lim\nt\u21920\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(s, r)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202t\n(x(r, s, t), y(r, s, t), s).\nTherefore, using (A 8),\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(r, t)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\n= lim\nt\u21920\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(s, r)\nw0(x\n\u2217, y\u2217).\nNow, let \u0393 (x, y) denote the locus of entry points on the plane z=0 of the streamlines\nthat intersect the vertical axis through (x, y), as in figure 3. Then the \u2018ride height\u2019 of\nthe glass workpiece is computed from\nh(x, y) =\n\u222b\n\u0393 (x,y)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202s\nds,\nwhich can easily be written as (3.6).\nNote that for a pressure distribution with non-convex isobars, the characteristics\nof (A 6) intersect and form envelopes, in analogy with caustics for optical rays. The\nanalogous optical amplitude, which is 1\n2\n\u2202Z\/\u2202s from (A7), is infinite on such a caustic.\nREFERENCES\nCarrier, G. F., Crook, M. & Pearson, C.
