INTRODUCTION  \nAn increasing number of small satellites are proposed for \nmiscellaneous applications, many of which assume the use of \nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) for positioning, timing and \norbit determination.  The smallest satellites are only 1 kg in \nmass, which is smaller than most commercially available space \nGPS receivers.  Equally demanding are the requirements for \npower consumption, where 1 watt is considered excessive, and \nalso low cost, implying the use of commercial component \nbased GPS receivers.  Small commercial-based GPS receivers \nhave previously been flown in space [1][3], and this has shown \nthat terrestrial miniaturisation of GPS technology can be \nsuccessfully applied to space applications with due caution \ntaken of the environment [2].  This paper describes the \ncharacterisation and adaptation of new commercial GPS \ntechnology for space use, including radiation testing, and \npreparation for demonstration on a satellite. \nII. THE SGR-05 GPS RECEIVER \nThe Zarlink Semiconductors GP4020 uses 0.35\u00b5m Digital \nCMOS with single polysilicon and is the successor to the \nwidely used GEC Plessey \/ Mitel GP2000 GPS chipset.  It uses \nsimilar correlator technology to the GP2021, but an \nARM7TDMI microprocessor is integrated onto the same IC, \nand with the 3.3 volt operation, a much lower power \nconsumption is achieved.  The Australian company Sigtec \nproduces a GPS application board (MG5001) that permits \ncustomers to develop and test their own software, and this has \nbeen adapted by Surrey as a starting point for a new space \nreceiver.  Three versions of GPS receivers have been designed: \n\u2022 the SGR-05U uses largely the same hardware as the \nSigtec COTS board, but with some component swaps \nand space-compatible software. This is intended for \nthe lowest budget missions. \n\u2022 the SGR-05P has error-detection and correction \n(EDAC)-protected memory and additional interfacing \ncircuitry to support missions with a wider range of \nrequirements. \n\u2022 the SGR-GEO is based on the SGR-05P, with an \noven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), some \nadditional power supply and interface circuitry, and \nspecialised operating software. This receiver is \nintended to be used at medium-altitude Earth orbit \n(MEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) \n(experiments have shown that GPS signals can be \ntracked in GEO). \nThe first flights of the SGR-05U and the SGR-GEO are \nplanned for 2005 on separate satellites as experiments. \nIII. RADIATION TEST CAMPAIGN \nIn collaboration with QinetiQ Ltd and ESA and with some \nfunding from the BNSC, Surrey embarked on a radiation test \ncampaign in an attempt to characterise the susceptibility of the \nnew chipset to radiation expected in an orbital environment, \nboth in terms of Total Ionising Dose (TID) and single event \neffects (SEE).  Samples of the MG5001 receiver were obtained \nfrom Sigtec. These were adapted for the tests, and the GP4020 \nIC replaced with \u201cdelidded\u201d GP4020s (see Fig.1). \n \nFigure 1.

Total Ionising Dose Tests \nTID testing was performed at the University of Surrey in \n2001 using a Cobolt-60 gamma radiation hot-spot source at a \nrate of 0.72 rad(SiO2) s-1 at room temperature  The small size \nof the GPS receiver allowed the entire receiver to be radiated at \nonce, enabling the characterisation of the whole receiver.  The \nreceiver was powered during the irradiation using a battery and \na linear regulator circuit to ensure that the receiver was \ncorrectly biased and operating (although not attached to an \nantenna).  The receiver was removed from the irradiation at \nregular intervals to test whether it was still operational or if had \nsuccumbed to the radiation and currents were recorded. \nB. Single Event Effect Testing \nIn July 2002, the susceptibility of the GP4020 to SEEs was \ntested in a campaign at the UCL Belgian cyclotron Heavy Ion \nFacility.  SEE testing was achieved by firing heavy ions at the \ndevice under test and observing susceptibility.  The angle and \nspecies of the heavy ions can be selected to vary the effective \nlinear-energy transfer (LET) of the ion to simulate the effects \nof typical radiation experienced in orbit due to cosmic rays.  It \nis necessary to expose the silicon of the device directly to the \nions, i.e. to de-lid the device.  The etching process can \nsometimes damage the component, and so several devices are \nprepared in case of de-lidding failure.  To enable proper test of \nthe component, it must be embedded as part of an operational \ncircuit so that radiation induced events can be monitored \ndynamically. Each device was therefore prepared and mounted \nin a separate GPS application circuit board. \n \nFigure 2.  Device being Fitted to Tray for Heavy Ion Testing \nAn ARM assembly code program was written to operate on \nthe GP4020 such that bit-patterns (55h, AAh, 00h and FFh) were \nwritten to the on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM) \nand registers to enable the detection bit flips due to heavy ions.  \nThe device was protected from single-event latch-ups (SELs) \nusing a fast-acting current switch that could be monitored and \nreset by the PC.  The results were logged using a PC program \nsuch that statistics of SELs and single-event upsets (SEUs) \ncould be gathered, and micro-latch-ups (\u00b5LUs) could be \nobserved using a current sensor linked to an analogue to digital \nconverter card in the PC. \nA final unusual test was made where the GPS receiver was \noperated in its full operational state, while the GP4020 was \nbeing subjected to heavy ion radiation.  The test equipment \npermitted the connection to an antenna mounted externally to \nthe building such that it was able to demonstrate tracking of \nGPS satellites and positioning. \nIV. RESULTS \nA. Total Ionising Dose Results \nThe GPS receiver was exposed to radiation, and removed \nfrom the chamber about once every 3 kRad(SiO2), to measure \ndynamic current and static current (holding the receiver in its \nreset state).  Fig. 3 shows the static current starting to increase \nafter about 10 kRad(SiO2) of dose, and the receiver unit was \nable to tolerate between 11 and 15 kRad(SiO2) of total dose \nbefore it failed.  After annealing the receiver under bias at \nroom temperature over night and then in a 100\u00b0C chamber for \n10 hours, the receiver recovered some degree of functionality \n(although not enough to be usable).  The cause of the failure \nwas not identified, but the 11 kRad(SiO2) system tolerance is \nadequate for many low cost space applications.   \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nkRads\nm\nA\nDynamic Current (mA)\nStatic Current (mA)\n \nFigure 3.  SGR-05U: Total Dose Effects on Nominal and Static Currents \nB. Single Event Effects Results \nThe heavy ion testing proceeded successfully, and SRAM \nand register upsets, latch-ups, micro latch-ups, program crashes \nand resets were automatically counted using the PC software, \nand logged into result files.  Latch-ups caused the protection \nswitch to trip every time, and the devices under test apparently \nsuffered no ill-effects. Micro-latch-ups were rare, but the \ncurrent increases were captured using an analogue to digital \ncard in the PC.  An example of multiple micro-latch-ups is \ngiven in Figure 4.  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n60 110 160 210\nTime (seconds)\nC\nur\nre\nnt\n (m\nA\n)\n \nFigure 4.

Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 06:23 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nThe results from the GP4020 heavy ion testing were \ncollated from all the tests in order to gather the statistics for \neach type of SEE.  LET thresholds and cross section \ncharacteristics were derived through fitting using Weibull \ndistribution curves.  For each set of results, the raw SEE-counts \nare turned into cross-sections (cm2 bit-1) by dividing the \nnumber of observed events by the fluence (ions cm-2) and by \nthe target number of bits, or devices as appropriate. The data \nfor each test LET are plotted with error-bars in cross-section \ncalculated as the 95% confidence limits of an assumed Poisson \nprocess. \nThe curves fitted to the data are derived from a best-fit \nWeibull distribution. This distribution has the functional form \nof: \nF(LET)=1-exp{-[(LET\u2013LETon-set)\/W]S} for LET > LETon-set \nF(LET) = 0          for LET <= LETon-set \nwhere LETon-set, W and S are the fitting parameters. \n \nThe function is normalised by multiplying by the measured \n(or estimated) saturated cross-section (cm2 bit-1). \nThe radiation tests were self-consistent, and a good quantity \nand quality of measurements mean that the primary \ncharacteristics were well determined.  Two samples were \ntested, and the results from both agreed closely. \nThe SRAM upset susceptibility is fairly high, as might be \nexpected from commercial 3.3V technology, and the threshold \nfor upsets was a LET of around 3.1 MeV cm2mg-1.  A plot of \nthe results from the SRAM from one of the devices is shown in \nFig. 5.  It was found that bit flips from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1 were \nequally likely.  A comparison of results from the GP4020 \nSRAM and GP4020 registers suggests that the registers may \nhave a slightly higher saturated cross-section than the SRAM, \nalthough there are far fewer registers and consequentially fewer \nevents (see Fig. 6).   \n  \nFigure 5.   GP4020 SRAM SEU Cross-Section (Device \u201ce1\u201d), \nDotted Line indicates MBU Cross-Section \nMultiple-bit upset (MBU) statistics were also gathered: \nonce again, the small number of events means poorly \ndetermined statistics, but it appears MBU cross section is \napproximately 500 times lower than that of the SRAM (Fig. 5).  \nThe MBUs were found to all be double bit upsets.  Results \nbetween the two device samples (\u201ce1\u201d and \u201ce3\u201d) were \nconsistent in each case. \n \nFigure 6.  GP4020 Register SEU Cross-Section (Device \u201ce1\u201d) \nDotted Line Indicates SRAM SEU Cross-Section \nThe GP4020 was significantly less susceptible to latch-ups \nthan to SEUs and the SEL LET threshold lies between 14 to 20 \nMeVcm2mg-1 (see Fig. 7).  Micro-latch-ups were also observed \nbut only when testing at the highest LET (28.2 MeV cm2mg-1) \n \nFigure 7.

Restrictions apply. \nOther effects logged included Watchdog Timeouts and self-\ninduced Software Resets (see Figs 8, 9), together referred to as \nsingle-event functional interrupts (SEFIs).  In common with the \nSEUs, the threshold is quite low. The data are consistent with a \nWeibull LET on-set of 3.2 MeV cm2mg-1. \n \nFigure 8.  GP4020 Timeout Cross-Section (Device \u201ce1\u201d) \nReceiver Operational Effects:  The receiver was tested \nwhile the GP4020 was radiated with low LET and low flux of \nheavy ions (5.85 MeV cm2 mg-1 at 500 ions cm-2 s-1, and 14.1 \nMeV cm2 mg-1 at 400 ions cm-2 s-1).  The receiver operation \nsuffered significantly in this mode, and it failed to operate \nnormally for more than a few tens of seconds (sustaining \nfluences of between 5000 and 14800 ions cm-2).  This was an \ninteresting test as the radiation flux under these circumstances \nis much higher than will be seen in orbit. \nA list of the fitting parameters derived is given in Table I, \nand a summary of all the radiation test results is given in \nTable II. \nV. RADIATION MITIGATION IN DESIGN \nThe results of the radiation tests can be compared to results \nfrom the 5V GPS chipset tested on a previous occasion [2].  \nThe SRAM\/register SEU saturated cross section of the GP4020 \n(1.3 - 2.3 x 10-7cm2 bit-1) is similar to that of the ARM60B (2 -\n4 x 10-7cm2 bit-1), but the threshold is lower (3.1 MeV mg-1cm2 \ncompared to 10 MeV mg-1cm2). This seems to confirm the \ngeneral perception that, as commercial technologies migrate \nfrom 5V to 3.3V, the sensitivity to SEEs increases. \n \nFigure 9.   GP4020 Software Reset Cross-Section (Device \u201ce1\u201d) \nFor low Earth orbit, the TID of the whole receiver is \nacceptable, as a lifetime of ~10 years is foreseen under average \nconditions, given 4 mm Aluminium screening.  The receiver \ncould also be used in higher orbits, e.g. GEO, given extensive \nshielding.  If an equivalent of 10 mm of Aluminium is used or, \nfor example, 3 mm of copper, it is calculated that the receiver \nwill survive 7-10 years in GEO.  The advantage of the SGR-05 \nis that its small size requires less shielding mass than most \nother electronic systems. \nThe SEU susceptibility is a matter of concern, as a \nsignificant number of upsets are to be expected in low Earth \norbit.  The operational tests give an idea how the receiver will \nbehave when a large number upsets occur, with a failure to \ntrack signals consistently.  The SGR-05U has no EDAC \ncircuitry and will be sensitive to upsets, and so it is important \nfor it to have a robust way of recovering.  Fortunately, the \nGP4020 is equipped with a Watchdog timer, and this will \ngenerally permit the receiver to be up and positioning within 10 \nTABLE I.

Note that devices have been frequently \nflown by Surrey that have similar thresholds to the GP4020 \nwithout experiencing mission-limiting reliability problems (e.g. \nthe 87C592 microcontroller). \nTo give greater confidence and reliability, the SGR-05P is \nbeing designed with external Triple Modular Redundancy \n(TMR) EDAC protected memory for speed and robustness, and \nsoftware is likely to avoid the use of internal RAM on the \nGP4020.  It is not possible to avoid using the registers but the \nchances of a register upset that causes a functional effect \nshould be small enough to achieve an acceptable degree of \nrobustness.  \nThe expected latch-up rate is sufficiently low for a practical \nsatellite sub-system.  As with the earlier SGR-10\/20 receivers a \nlatch-up switch will be used that switches the receiver off \nrapidly after any current surge.  SSTL\u2019s latch-up switch has \nbeen flown on several missions, and was also proven during \nthe radiation test campaign.  Micro-latch-ups are expected to be \nrare, but should ideally be checked for by the host computer.  \nAs with the SGR-10\/20 design, a battery-backed non-volatile \nRAM is being avoided to ensure that all latch-ups can be \ncaught and reset immediately.  See also discussion in [4].  \nOther non-volatile memories should be used, for example Flash \nor FRAM memories.  These cannot maintain a real-time clock, \nbut will be able to maintain copies of GPS Almanac and user \norbital elements during power cycling. \nThe test results indicate that SEFIs will occasionally \nhappen.  The GP4020 watchdog will usually help the receiver \nrecover any effects from SEFIs, but there may be some SEFIs \nthat cannot be solved through a self-induced reset.  In this case, \nthe host computer system will be required to monitor the \nreceiver and cycle the power if anomalies are observed (e.g. \nlack of communications, or lack of position fix for an excessive \nperiod of time). \nCONCLUSIONS  \nThis paper has described the results and implications from a \nradiation test campaign aimed at assessing the susceptibility \ncharacteristics of the GP4020, a COTS GPS integrated circuit, \nfor space applications.  Three types of miniaturised GPS \nreceivers have been developed based on the GP4020, and it is \nplanned that two receivers will be demonstrated in orbit on \nflight opportunities in 2005.  A future version of this receiver is \nalso being designed that can use multiple front-ends to \ndetermine accurate attitude of a space vehicle.  The radiation \ntests on the GP4020 suggest that with due care and attention, \nmodern low power commercial GPS technology can be used in \nspace applications, to be confirmed by a demonstration in orbit. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThanks are due to QinetiQ, ESA for supporting the \nradiation tests and to BNSC for contributing towards the \nfunding.
