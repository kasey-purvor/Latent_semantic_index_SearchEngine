Introduction \nThe principle of coating is to lay a thin film of liquid onto a solid surface.  It is \na wetting process, which occurs widely in nature and one that has been engineered for \na variety of applications, the oldest being painting.   Nowadays, there are very few \nsurfaces, which are not coated either for decorative or protective purposes or to add \nvalue  to  them.    Magnetic  tapes,  photographic  films  and  drug  patches  are  three \ncommon examples of the modern benefits of coating.  In these and most other coating \napplications,  the  key  requirement  of  the  coating  flow  is  that  it  must  produce  a \nperfectly  flat  film  of  uniform  thickness  (5-100  microns  typically)  devoid  of  any \ndefects.  The whole coating operation must also be carried out at reasonably high \nspeed (>1 m\/s) to be economical.  The stumbling block is dynamic wetting failure or \nthe entrainment of air bubbles, which occurs above a critical speed VAE. These air \nbubbles  spoil  the  quality  of  the  coating,  which  after  drying  becomes  pitted  with \ncraters.   As measured by Gutoff and Kendrick (1987) and confirmed by many others \n(see the authoritative review by Blake and Ruschak, 1997), VAE rapidly decreases with \nincreasing viscosity, \u03bc [VAE (cm\/s)=5.11 \u03bc(mPa.s)\n-0.67] and this is also not helpful in \npractice.    Coating  liquids  by  definition  are  viscous  (20  to  1000  mPa.s  or  more) \nbecause they carry solid particles or polymer molecules at high concentration (40% \nand  more)  to  make  subsequent  drying  not  too  expensive.    Clearly  any  means  of \nincreasing VAE whilst increasing \u03bc (which is partly the aim of this paper) will be most \nbeneficial.  To successfully attempt this, one must begin first by understanding the \nmechanism behind dynamic wetting failure.  \nDynamic wetting failure is observed in all coating operations (dip, blade, roll, \nslide, slot, die, and curtain coating) but its mechanism is best viewed and explained in \nthe simple dip coating flow when a substrate is plunged at a constant speed into a   3 \nlarge pool of liquid.  In such a flow and any other coating flows, the free surface of the \nliquid intersects the solid substrate along the dynamic wetting line and forms with it \nthe dynamic contact angle, \u03b8D.  As the speed of the substrate is increased, the wetting \nline  moves  downward  and  the  contact  angle  increases  until  it  approaches  180\n0  at \nwhich point the wetting line becomes unsteady and breaks into segments much like \nthe teeth of a saw.  At these critical conditions, wetting failure occurs and air bubbles \nform and are entrained at the tips of the vvv line formed.  Figure 1 taken from this \nexperimental programme shows this very clearly.  This phenomenon is not new; it has \nbeen reported first by Deryagin and Levi (1964) and since then has attracted a lot of \nresearch interest (see review by Blake and Ruschak, 1997).    Advances have been \nmade in our understanding of the factors that affect VAE but so far we have only been \nable to quantify the effect of viscosity and lump other effects in the constants of either \nvery basic experimental correlations or complex theoretical equations (see Table 1).  \nThe  reason  for  this  is  that  dynamic  wetting  is  a  formidable  problem  and  the \nfundamental question remains unanswered: what is the physical origin of dynamic \nwetting failure?  Is it controlled and can it be modelled by only the hydrodynamic of \nthe system (Voinov 1976 and Cox 1986) or by molecular interactions at the liquid-\nsubstrate  interface  (Blake  and  Ruschak,  1997).  The  available  data  support  both \napproaches  in  parts but  are lacking in  helping to develop a new complete theory, \nwhich bridges across the two.   This paper presents limited but fundamental data to \nhelp this development with regard to the effect of substrate roughness which has as yet \nnot been fully evaluated.   \nRoughness, unlike molecular surface structure, is one surface property, which \nis easy to create and manipulate, and which a-priori should have a significant effect on \nVAE.  The data of Buonopane, Gutoff and Rimore (1986) suggest that this is the case   4 \nwith roughness increasing VAE in some tests by a factor as much as 12 in comparison \nwith  smooth  substrates.    These  data  are  however  not  systematic  as  the  substrates \nchemistry or porosity were not kept constant.  Also, Buonopane, Gutoff and Rimore \ndo not offer experimental mechanistic evidence for this increase in VAE to support the \nproposition that with rough surfaces, air can escape through the valleys between peaks \nin the surface. Indeed it is opposite to the received wisdom (Blake and Ruschak, 1997) \nthat roughness should in fact decrease VAE on the basis that the wetting line must \nmove a greater distance across a rough surface than a flat surface of equivalent length.  \nClearly  an  explanation  is  lacking,  experimental  or  theoretical,  to  reconcile  these \nopposite  findings.    It  is  true  that  Blake  and  Ruschak  (1997)  offer  an  alternative \nscenario-  skipping  from  peak to  peak- as  a reason  why VAE should increase with \nroughness. They gave no data to support this view which is based on the theoretical \nargument that with increasing roughness the wetting line will move a shorter distance \ncausing  VAE  to  increase.  The  skipping  mode  however  should  lead  to  a  dynamic \nwetting failure different from the classical vvv type. This is because if the liquid skips \nover the peaks, it will not wet completely the topography of the substrate and small air \npockets will be trapped in the intervening valleys. Beyond a critical substrate speed, \nthe air pockets will grow larger than the scale of the roughness, they will get engulfed \nby the liquid and catastrophic coating failure should ensue rather than the vvv type \nfailure described in  Figure 1 in which tiny air bubbles form at the tip of the \u201cv\u201d \nsegments.      Clarke  (2002)  has  observed  this  phenomenon  in  curtain  coating  and \nexploited it to enhance coating speeds by a careful choice of roughness and viscosity. \nHis data at the lowest curtain flow rate show no roughness effect which suggest it may \nnot be observed in dip coating and in other non-assisted hydrodynamically coating \nflows. We intend to prove  that this switch in behaviour \u2013from VAE decreasing to   5 \nincreasing with increasing roughness- is fundamental to all coating flows when the \nroughness- flow (viscosity) conditions are appropriate.  It is not peculiar to curtain \ncoating where the skipping over a rough surface is aided by the turning geometry of \nthe impinging curtain and the large coating speeds. In doing so, the present work will \ncomplement the observations made at very low wetting speed- with sliding drops- by \nMenchaca-Rocha  (1992),  Herminghauss  (2000)  and  Miwa  et  al.  (2000)  who  also \nfound that as the roughness was increased, drops could move more easily.  \n \n2.  EXPERIMENTAL METHOD   \nThe dip coater used consists of a 50mm wide vertical tape drawn downwards \ninto and through a transparent tank containing the test liquids to a depth of 150 mm.  \nTo cancel edge effects, the tank cross section was 135 mm x 90 mm.  The tape was \nfed from a spool, plunged into the liquid, emerged through a sealed slit at the bottom \nof the tank and was finally wound around a cylinder driven by a variable speed geared \nmotor. Additional  liquid was supplied regularly to the tank to compensate for the \namount  entrained  by  the  substrate.    The  tape  velocities  were  measured  with  an \noptically triggered digital tachometer mounted on one of the rollers. The onset of the \ndynamic wetting failure was determined by slowly increasing the tape velocity until \nthe break-up of the wetting line into a saw-teeth pattern could be observed with the \nnaked eye under proper illumination.  A digital video camera with a microscopic lens \nwas also used to view and capture images of the flow.  Figure 1 shows the dynamic \nwetting line at break point with its vvv segments.  Catastrophic failure was gauged in \nthe same way except that larger bubbles instead of a vvv line would suddenly appear. \nIn  these  experiments,  2  non-porous  paper  and  2  polyester  substrates  with \ndifferent roughness on the front (F) and back (B) sides were used.  Both the paper and   6 \nthe polyester substrates were coated with a gelatine sublayer to eliminate differences \nin their surface molecular structure.  Their absolute roughness RA and average peak-to-\nvalley  height  roughness  RZ  were  measured  using  a  PicoForce  Multimode  Atomic \nForce Microscope with scan size less than 30 microns and a Taylor Hobson Talysurf \n4.  The roughnesses obtained from both were consistent as shown in Table 2.  We also \nobserved  the  substrate  topography  and  measured  roughness  with  a  MicroXam  3D \nInterferometric Profiling System (AG ElectroOptics).  Again the roughnesses obtained \nwere in par with those of the AFM and Talysurf.   \nThe procedure for measuring the air entrainment speeds was as follows.  For \nany one fluid we observed both the front and back sides of the substrate, increased the \nspeed gradually, measured the air entrainment speed on the side that entrained air first \nand  continued  the  experiment  until  the  second  side  showed  air  entrainment  and \nrecorded  the  corresponding  speed.  In  order  to  reduce  experimental  errors,  each \nexperiment  was  repeated  at  least  three  times.  In  spite  of  the  crudeness  of  the \nexperimental method, the discrepancies between individual and averaged data were \nalways found to be in the range \u00b1 5-10%.  All coating experiments were conducted at \nroom temperature (between 20 and 25\noC) with glycerol-water solutions.  The viscosity \nof each solution tested was measured before and after the test was carried out at the \nsame temperature in a concentric cylinder viscometer (Brabender Rheotron and Bohlin \nCVO 120).  As expected, the glycerol-water solutions were found to be Newtonian.  \nDepending on the critical viscosity (details later in the results), several solutions were \ntested covering the range from 50 to 800 mPa.s.  The surface tension \u03c3 of the fluids \nand  the  advancing  contact  angles  \u03b8D  for  each  pair  of  fluid-substrate  system  were \nmeasured with a FTA 188 video tensiometer.   The difference in wetting behaviour of \nthe paper and polyester substrates is clearly shown in Figure 2 and in the tabulated   7 \nvalues (Table 2) of the contact angles measured immediately after the drop sat on the \nsubstrate (t=0) and thirty seconds later (t=30s). \n \n3.  RESULTS & DISCUSSION   \nThe important result is the effect of roughness on air entrainment speed above \nand below a critical viscosity and a critical roughness.  When we compared the air \nentrainment speeds on the rough and smooth side of the paper substrates, we found a \nswitch in behaviour at a critical viscosity.  At viscosity lower than a critical value, the \nrough side entrained air at lower speeds than the smooth side.  It also shows the \nclassical vvv failure.  Above the critical viscosity the reverse was observed, the rough \nside entraining air at higher speed than the smooth side.  The air entrainment in such a \ncase was sudden and intense and not preceded by a vvv line.  This is clearly shown in \nthe  flow  images  of  Figure  3.    The  LHS  side  shows  two  sequences  at  increasing \nsubstrate speed for a viscosity of 40 mPa.s.  The RHS sequences are for a viscosity of \n140 mPa.s.  The pattern does not change as we increase the viscosity further.  We have \nthe experimental evidence for viscosities up to 800 mPa.s.  Hence the assertion that \nwe have for a given substantial roughness a critical viscosity.   For this particular \nroughness (substrate Paper2F, RZ=3.060 \u03bcm), the critical viscosity was found by an \niterative experimental procedure to be 84 mPa.s.  That is at this viscosity the smooth \nand the rough sides of this substrate entrained air at exactly the same speed.  This is \nclearly shown in the flow images of Figure 4. This result was confirmed with another \npaper substrate (Paper1) which also had a smooth and rough side.  Its rough side \n(Paper1F) was however only slightly rougher (RZ=3.300 \u03bcm) than Paper2F, the rough \nside of Paper2.  The resulting effect was that the critical viscosity was larger and \nmeasured to be 345 mPa.s,  much larger than the 84 mPa.s measured with Paper2F of   8 \nRZ=3.060 \u03bcm.  The critical viscosity is therefore very sensitive to roughness and a \nslight increase in it (8%) can push the critical viscosity by a much larger order of \nmagnitude (311%). \nThis  result  brings  out  clearly  the  importance  of  hydrodynamic  effects- \nroughness and viscosity- on air entrainment. Only above a critical viscosity is a rough \nsurface more dynamically wetting than a smooth surface.  Also, the critical viscosity is \npushed  to  higher  value  by  modest  increases  in  roughness.   This  is  very useful  in \npractice as it implies that higher solid content formulations (higher viscosity) can be \ncoated faster by increasing the roughness of the substrate but not so substantially as to \nweaken its strength. \nWhen  we  carried  out  the  experiments  with  the  two  polyester  substrates \nPolyester1 and Polyester2, we saw no switch or critical viscosity.  In comparison with \nthe paper substrates, these are smoother but they have different roughness on both \nsides  as  shown  in  Table  1.    This  result  together  with  the  results  with  the  paper \nsubstrates demonstrate that roughness is only effective in enhancing dynamic wetting \nwhen it is  large or above a critical  value.  When we compared VAE with surface \nPaper1B  (Rz=0.600  \u03bcm)  and  surface  Paper2B  (Rz=1.475  \u03bcm),  we  found  again  no \nswitch or critical viscosity.  This and the data with Paper1F and Paper2F suggest that \nthe critical roughness is in the range 1.5-3 \u03bcm.  Further experiments with a wider \nrange  of  roughness  on  the  same  type  of  substrate  are  needed  to  delineate  more \nprecisely the region in which roughness increases VAE.   \nThe above observation are clearly expressed in the air entrainment speeds data \nshown in Figures 5-8 for the 4 sides tested together with the correlation of Gutoff and \nKendrick  (1982).    The  smooth  sides  gave  air  entrainment  speeds  close  to  those \nobtained by Gutoff and Kendrick and this confirms the accuracy of the experimental   9 \ntechnique. The switch at the critical viscosity is clearly shown for the two rough sides, \nwith the rougher side switching at much higher viscosity than the less rough side.   \nThe data clearly demonstrate that depending on the flow conditions (which \nmust include viscosity) and roughness values, roughness could decrease or increase \nthe air entrainment speed. When roughness decreases the air entrainment speed, the air \nentrainment is of the vvv type and when it increases it, it is of the catastrophic type. \nAs for the mechanism,  skipping from peak to peak is a reasonable explanation \nfor why air entrainment speed should increase with roughness. It also explains the \nsudden  and  intense  air  entrainment  at  wetting  failure.  In  comparison  with  curtain \ncoating, the increase in air entrainment speeds is however not very large.  Unlike in \ndip coating, in curtain coating, the liquid impinges on the substrates creating a load \npressure that delays the formation of an air film sufficiently larger than the roughness \nto  induce  catastrophic  wetting  failure.

At catastrophic wetting failure, this air film thickness ha will be \njust greater than the roughness Rz , the air entrainment velocity will then be: \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02b\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf03d\na\nL\nZ AE\nm\nP\nR V\n\uf06d \uf070\n\uf073\n\uf073 ) 1 ( 2 3\n8\n2 \/ 3\n  with \na d\nZ\nL\nR\nm\n\uf06d\n\uf06d\n3 1\n1\n\uf02b\n\uf03d   (2)   10 \nEquation (2) intimates that the roughness effect should be the same in both curtain and \ndip coating.  It would be if both PL and m were the same. PL in curtain coating is very \nlarge and is due the large kinetic energy of the liquid curtain impinging at speed from \nthe curtain die from a height onto the substrate.  It is of order 1000-10,000 Pa.  In dip \ncoating,  the  liquid  pressure  is  much  smaller  in  comparison  and  of  order  a  few \nmillimetres of water or about 1-10 Pa. This explains why the roughness has such a \ndramatic  effect  in  curtain  coating  and  a  comparatively  insignificant  effect  in  dip \ncoating.  As for the effect of viscosity, m indicates that it is non-linear and magnified \nby RZ\/Ld, i.e. roughness.   For a given RZ\/Ld, m changes significantly only when the \nviscosity is large enough to affect the term \na d\nZ\nL\nR\n\uf06d\n\uf06d\n3 1\uf02b .   This could explain why \nroughness becomes effective only at and above a critical viscosity.   \n \n4.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis  work  has  provided  new  experimental  evidence  of  the  hydrodynamic \norigin of dynamic wetting failure. It shows that roughness and viscosity play a critical \nrole and can lead to higher or lower air entrainment speeds.  The mechanisms by \nwhich  the  air  is  entrained  also  differ.  We  have  shown  in  particular,  that  a  rough \nsubstrate will only coat faster than a smooth substrate when both the roughness and \nthe  viscosity  exceed  a  critical  value.      The  critical  roughness  is  only  small  and \naccording to our data in the range RZ =1.5-3 \u03bcm.  The corresponding critical viscosity \nis 84 mPa.s but increases rapidly with tiny increases in roughness. These results are of \npractical value as they imply that one can coat viscous fluids at higher speeds than \nnormal by roughening substrates only marginally.   Although limited in their range, \nthese key experiments have brought out the essential effect of roughness-viscosity on   11 \ndynamic wetting failure in dip coating and by implication other coating flows.   These \nfindings consequently provide a firm scientific basis to tune roughness-viscosity to the \nindustrial target of larger VAE with larger viscosities. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe  author  acknowledges  the  contribution  of  his  Coating  Research  Team \nmembers Dr Raj Patel and Mr Ilyas Khan in the collection of the data.
