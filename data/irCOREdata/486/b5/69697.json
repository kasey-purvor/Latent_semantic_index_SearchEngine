Since then, Cardew\u2019s stock as a composer of\nmusic has, if anything, fallen. Comparison between the New Grove\nentries of 1980 and 2001, for instance, evidences an increase in the priv-\nileging of Cardew\u2019s performance activities and politics over his musical\noutput.3 Similarly, in the last two decades, those pieces of Cardew\u2019s\nthat have merited most attention have been discussed from primarily a\nvisual perspective (Treatise)4 or incorporated into an examination of\nCardew\u2019s political engagement (The Great Learning).5 In the year of\nwhat would have been Cardew\u2019s 70th birthday, one can plausibly argue\nthat we know more about the motivations behind his music than how it\nactually goes. With this comes the risk that the music is reduced in sig-\nnificance, becoming no more than a symbol for Cardew\u2019s other (more\ndefinable) activities. \nThe challenges to performers and audiences posed by a work such\nas Cardew\u2019s Autumn \u201960 for orchestra are sufficient to sustain an analysis\nthat foregrounds its particular quality of musical thought over any\n\u2018conceptual infrastructure\u2019. To engage in such an analysis is not to deny\nthe role played by such an infrastructure, but rather to show that\nweakening or kicking away conceptual crutches need not cause the\nmusic to topple over. What remains standing is a work of considerable\ncharm, beauty and wit.\nCardew suggested that the criterion of any good performance of\nAutumn \u201960 \u2018is not completeness (i.e. perfection), but rather the lucidity\nof its incompleteness\u2019.6 It is in that spirit of revealing the lucidity of\nAutumn \u201960 that these brief and incomplete thoughts, my own reac-\ntions and reflections, have been offered. \n1 Barrett, Richard, \u2018Cornelius Cardew\u2019 in New Music 87, ed.

Written \u2018for orchestra\u2019,\nit can, in fact, be performed by any number of instruments. It was pre-\nmi\u00e8red in Venice in October 1960, with Heinz-Klaus Metzger and John\nCage on piano, Kurt Schwertsik playing horn and Cardew on guitar;\nBenjamin Patterson conducted. The performers alone are enough to\nreveal that Autumn \u201960 belongs to Cardew\u2019s Cage-influenced output. As\nwith any experimental work, one experiences considerable problems if\nwishing to talk about it in traditional terms as a piece of music rather\nthan an idea. This can be either a source of frustration or liberation,\ndepending on your viewpoint. \nExample 1 gives some indication of the difficulties one faces with\nAutumn \u201960. Each player performs from the same score, the content of\nwhich establishes a rich yet bounded field of musical possibilities. The\nnotational system blends traditional (pitch and dynamic indications) with\nnon-traditional symbols (or interpretations of symbols). The complete\nlist of symbols and their interpretation can be found in Figure 1. \nEach bar in the score contains one to four beats, divided by the bar\nlines in the upper system; bar lines through both staves indicates bar\nlengths. (The lower stave is provided for the performer to note down\nwhat they want to play, should they wish.) Each beat contains between\none item of information (e.g. Example 1, the B\u0004 in the second beat after\nfigure E) and six (Example 1, beat one). The performer is required to\naccommodate all but two of these instructions in whatever musical\nresponse they choose to make. If what remains after the two instruc-\ntions are ignored is mutually exclusive, or if they choose not to perform\nanything, the performer will be silent.7 If there are only two items of\ninformation, the performers must either remain silent or do anything\nbut those instructions. For instance, at figure D, any performer choosing\nto play must not use a stringed instrument, or diminuendo. Observed to\nthe letter, this would also presumably rule out a sustained percussive\nsound (which would get softer as it rang on), although one could reit-\nerate this sound in ever-louder attacks throughout the duration of the\nbeat. Where there is only one item of information, the players must\nobserve what is written, or remain silent. Finally, the double bar line is\nused to indicate a break in the music. Complicating matters further is\nthat within each section delineated by the double bar lines it is possible\nthat performers make their own speed through the material: the\nresulting overlapping of material would serve to obscure the detail that\nthe performers are trying so hard to observe.\n7 Being forced into silence is more common than one might expect. Michael Nyman has cited\nRoger Smalley\u2019s observation that \u2018so far from being entirely free, as one might suppose at a\ncasual glance, the performer finds himself gradually enmeshed in an ever-narrowing field of\npossibilities wherein it eventually becomes difficult to do anything at all\u2019.

For instance, in the final beat of Example 1, any\nperformer not playing bass will either be silent, or respond with a musi-\ncal gesture that will interpret two of the three other indications. It is\nstatistically likely that a group of performers will between them come\nup with material that contains the D \u0004 a minor ninth above middle C, a\ncrescendo and a long sustained sound with a distinct cut-off. Quite how\nthis is realized in a specific performance is another matter; neverthe-\nless, certain beats of the score suggest (in abstract, at least) more defin-\nable musical responses than others.\nFor beats that impose greater restrictions on the performer, the field\nof possible interpretations correspondingly shrinks. Most restrictive of\nall are those beats that require a single response from the performers:\nthose that immediately follow a double bar line (and hence begin with\nsilence) and those that have only one indication (which must be fol-\nlowed, or else the player remains silent). Such beats provide points of\nrelative focus in which a particular type of event is foregrounded, as if\nan underlying structure had briefly been pushed to the surface; the pat-\ntern of composed silences provided by the double bar lines articulates\nthe music into longer and shorter sections (which themselves might be\npunctuated by silence). Negatively, we might also take note of those\nbeats with only two indications. By requiring the players to ignore\nthese indications, the score ensures that certain events won\u2019t happen.\nHere, once again, we encounter a fruitful tension between tradition\nand notational demands: many players at first find it very difficult to\nactively do anything but what is written in front of them.\n8 Introduction to UE 14171. \n9 Cardew, Cornelius, Stockhausen Serves Imperialism (London: Latimer, 1974). Cardew in fact\ndescribes two \u2018diseases\u2019; the first is that \u2018the composer doesn\u2019t conceive of a piece of music\nso much as a notation system\u2019, the second is \u2018the idea that a musical score can have some\nkind of aesthetic identity of its own, quite apart from its realization in sound\u2019 (p. 80; see also\nn. 48, p. 121).\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f4\nFigure 1: Indications in Autumn \u201860\nfor orchestra\nExample 2 provides an overview of the entire score. Each beat is rep-\nresented by a slash; larger slashes represent beats with one or two\npieces of information, the latter shown in square brackets for clarity.\nWhat the summary demonstrates is that the most clearly prescribed\ncontent of Autumn \u201960, both positive and negative, is in itself limited to\na restricted range of pitches, colours and performance techniques.\nAll of the prescribed pitches of the work (not just those given in\nExample Two) are drawn from the pentatonic set F G \u0004 A \u0004 B \u0004 D \u0004.\nAlthough the performers are sometimes required to avoid these pitch-\nes, they will more often be drawn towards them.10 It is possible that a\nperformance of Autumn \u201960 would have a distinctive pentatonic feel,\nbut a more likely result is that these pitches act as focal points around\nwhich other events cluster, throwing up associations, hierarchies and\nconnexions that differ from one realization to the next. The patterns of\ninclusion and exclusion also relate to a limited colour palette (sax,\ntrombone, bass, viola and on one occasion all the strings) and articula-\ntion (the circle with a line through it); similarly, these events act as\ninterpretative hubs. \nTo the extent that one can talk about identities for experimental\nmusic at all, it seems reasonable to suggest that an identity of Autumn\n\u201960 is most clearly felt to exist at those points in which the instructions\ngive little room for freedom of interpretation. As the number of indi-\ncations varies from beat to beat, our (abstract) awareness of these focal\npoints waxes and wanes. The environment (or theatre) of Autumn \u201960\nin which performers and listeners can \u2018act\u2019 is shaped \u2013 controlled \u2013 by\nthis identity, no matter how loosely-felt; the important thing to note is\nthat this is a musical identity.\n10 Cardew: \u2018in the nature of things these pitches will often predominate\u2019 (Introduction to\nAutumn \u201960).\n\uf763\uf76f\uf772\uf76e\uf765\uf76c\uf769\uf775\uf773 \uf763\uf761\uf772\uf764\uf765\uf777\u2019\uf773 \u2018\uf761\uf775\uf774\uf775\uf76d\uf76e \u2019\uf736\uf730 \uf766\uf76f\uf772 \uf76f\uf772\uf763\uf768\uf765\uf773\uf774\uf772\uf761\u2019 5\nExample 2: Overview of Autumn \u201960\nfor orchestra\n\u0003\nThe musical challenges posed by Autumn \u201860 are considerable, requir-\ning performers to participate in the creative process of the work. It\noffers at first a hostile environment that forces the performers to grap-\nple with the sometimes counterintuitive demands of the notation\n(Figure 1). Each performer brings to the piece their own habitual\nresponses, conditioned by their prior experience. In interpreting the\nnotation, they must engage in a constant dialogue between their pre-\nconceptions of a symbol and what it actually means in Autumn \u201960.\nParticularly troublesome are those indications that employ traditional\nsymbols but demand different responses. The use of a turn to indicate\nvibrato is one example, the use of an accented tenuto for an event of\n\u2018long duration, with distinct cut-off \u2019 another. Even when this new\nmeaning has been internalized, it is still possible for some of the tradi-\ntional associations to influence their realization: vibrato could be per-\nformed wider than normal (taking into account the pitches around the\ncentral tone in a turn), or the onset of the held note could be accented.\nThe retention of time signatures offers another interpretative\nquandary: do performers take these as implications of metrically\nstrong and weak beats (and to what extent?), or do they ignore them?\nQuestions such as these are far from trivial: the answers that a particu-\nlar performing group provide will have a profound effect on any given\nperformance.\nOnce the performer has determined which instructions to, and how,\nif possible, to accommodate and interpret the remaining instructions,\nthe question arises of how to progress from one beat to the next. In his\nsleeve notes to a recording, David Ryan asks \u2018What was the world\nintended by Cardew for Autumn \u201960? Generally, the generated sound\nworld has a fragmented, pontillistic atmosphere\u2019.11 This is certainly in\naccordance with the Cageian influence on the work. However, certain\nindications suggest that continuity, at least sometimes, is as desirable as\ndiscontinuity. For instance, Roman numerals require performers to\nsustain an event for one, two, three or four beats (e.g. Example 1, beats\none, two and four). By doing so it is highly likely that they will obscure\nsome of the focal events described above; however, the distribution of\nRoman numerals is such that no sustained event overlaps a break\nrequired by a double bar lines (again, see Example 1). This suggests\nthat the silences that separate sections are absolute; those in the course\nof a section are optional.\nThe decision to produce a predominantly fragmented sound world\nis nevertheless one brought to the score; it is not inherent in it. It is a\ndecision based on prior experience, and one that emerges in the con-\nstant dialogue with the notation. In his introduction to the score,\nCardew gives a sample realization of seven beats, for the idiosyncratic\nensemble of five cellos. Whilst some of the individual cello lines sug-\ngest an atomistic performance, others hint at a smoother musical sur-\nface in which events flow into one another: both approaches are pre-\nsented as equally valid. And indeed, in the second bar after figure J (see\nExample 2), Cardew specifically instructs the performers not to hold\nthe event through one beat: one acceptable realization is to hold the\nevent for longer than a single beat, blending with the instruction of the\nfollowing bar (to hold for maximal duration). \n11 Sleeve notes to Cornelius Cardew: Chamber Music 1955\u201364, Apartment House, Matchless\nRecordings MRCD45 (2001). Ryan performed in both versions of Autumn \u201960 that are includ-\ned in the CD. \n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f6\nA conductor of Autumn \u201860, no less than the musicians, is required to\nengage in a dialogue between his or her musical background and the\nspecific demands of the score. In some respects, the conductor fulfils a\ntraditional function, keeping time and suggesting the character of\ninterpretation; the ways in which he or she chooses to do this can vary\nfrom one beat to the next. Thus in any given section, the conductor can\ngive distinct beats, vague beats, or even no beat at all. This results in the\nensemble either moving through the section with the conductor and\neach other; or if the gestures are vague they may stumble through\nuncertainly, blurring boundaries between beats; or they may progress\nat their own pace, coming together again only with the next double bar\nline. In this way the conductor can have a guiding hand, though by all\nmeans not the only say, in the way events link or overlap with one\nanother. The conductor is also at liberty to change the duration of\nbeats from one to the next; further, it is the conductor\u2019s decision as to\nwhere the piece begins and ends. The conductor may also suggest that\ncertain directions are observed more than others (an example Cardew\ngives is that \u2018in a particular section [the performers] should all play the\nwritten notes wherever possible\u2019); this may be used as a means of clar-\nifying (or obscuring) the identity of the work.\nBut the conductor may elect to participate with the group on a more\nequal footing. It is perfectly feasible that performers \u2018merely\u2019 progress\nthrough the work on their own, heeding only whether the conductor\u2019s\nbeat is clear, minimal or non-existent in order to guide their way\nthrough the score, paying no attention to the sounds around them.\nHowever, performers who are sufficiently versed with the notational\ndemands may choose to improvise within the limits established by the\nnotation and respond to those around them: they might enter into\nmusical dialogues, reacting to others as they become more or less pro-\nnounced in the texture. Certain performers might take on the role of a\nsoloist for one or more beats; the others could assume accompanimen-\ntal roles.12 Similarly, in addition to the clarity of his or her beats, the\nconductor may choose to \u2018interpret\u2019 the music in traditional ways, or\n\u2018merely\u2019 mark time; players are at liberty to respond as they see fit to\nthese gestures. \u0003\nThe musical challenges posed by Autumn \u201960 bring with them con-\nsiderable musical rewards. Autumn \u201960 does not ask of its performers\nthat they shed themselves of their history (a charge Cardew levels at\nCage), but that they examine it fruitfully and creatively. This process is\nnot easy, but when approached with sincerity and commitment, the\nexperience is positive and affirming, and the musical results significant.\nOne need not know Cardew\u2019s convictions to apprehend the humanist\nimpulse behind this music: it is palpable in every bar, and it is this that\nconvinces me of its considerable and enduring merits. \nMusical Examples \u00a9 Copyright 1967 by Universal Edition (London) Ltd, London.\n12 There are similarities here with some of the improvisational rites of the Scratch Orchestra;\nsee, for instance, Nature Study Notes.\n\uf763\uf76f\uf772\uf76e\uf765\uf76c\uf769\uf775\uf773 \uf763\uf761\uf772\uf764\uf765\uf777\u2019\uf773 \u2018\uf761\uf775\uf774\uf775\uf76d\uf76e \u2019\uf736\uf730 \uf766\uf76f\uf772 \uf76f\uf772\uf763\uf768\uf765\uf773\uf774\uf772\uf761\u2019 7\n"}
