ISBN: 0-7494-1931-8. 135\npages, paperback. \u00a315.99.\nThis is the latest in a series of practical books\npublished by Kogan Page in the field of\neducation by Professor Phil Race in\ncollaboration with various others. Phil Race,\nEmeritus Professor of Educational Develop-\nment at the University of Glamorgan, has had a\nvaried and inspirational career in higher\neducation, and at present is Programme\nDirector for the University of Durham\nCertificate in Teaching in Higher Education.\nSteve McDowell lectures in IT at Gateshead\nCollege and the Open University.\nThe scope of the book invites admiration for the\nbravery of the authors. To offer advice over a\nvista which ranges from choosing a computer to\nusing IT in different disciplines is not a task for\nthe faint-hearted or the inexperienced. With\nacademics bringing specialist knowledge and\nprejudices to a reading, one would imagine that\nsuch a book would fail to satisfy all but the\nuninitiated. It is a tribute to the breadth of\nknowledge of the authors that this is not the\ncase, though those who are already using\ncomputers in their teaching may be difficult to\nplease.\nThe book has four chapters with a total of\nforty-seven short sections, each about two pages\nlong, together with a short bibliography and a\nglossary. This is a work to be dipped into rather\nthan read sequentially. Approached in the right\nspirit, it contains gems of useful advice. To\nanyone who has been using computers for some\ntime, much of the advice will be fairly obvious,\nbut to the teacher beginning to think about\nways in which the computer can enliven\nteaching and learning, the tips will prove useful.\nFor example, there are thought-provoking\nsections on health and safety, and I learned that\nlaser printers produce toxic ozone, and that\nmonitors are implicated in facial dermatitis!\nThe sections on software follow a pattern of tips\nfor beginners, then a separate section of tips for\nmore experienced users. These do not offer\ninstructions on how to complete a task but\nrather general encouragement to explore\npossibilities. Since Phil Race is a firm believer in\nlearning by doing, words like 'explore', 'try out'\nand 'experiment' are common. As someone who\ntends not to explore functions unless I have a\ntask which needs them, I am not completely\nconvinced by this approach, and there is\nsometimes a tendency to gloss over material so\nthat the tip offered is not very useful. For\nexample, in 'Where to go next with\nspreadsheets', where my experience is limited,\nthe advice is 'Learn to use absolute cell\nreferences' - if you do not know what they are,\nthe detail in the tip will enlighten you. The book\nwould have been vastly improved (though, to be\nfair, of much greater length) by the inclusion of\nmore examples. Where they occur, what could\nhave been obscure becomes clear; where they\nare absent, the novice may be baffled.\nI did not find a bad piece of advice, but I came\nto the conclusion that the authors had spread\nthemselves too thinly. Much of the book covers\ntopics of interest to all computer users, or at\nleast beginners in the field. Where my interest\nlies - and I would suspect, given the title, the\n77\nReviews\ninterest of most readers - is in the use of IT in\nteaching and learning, yet only about 30 of the\n130 pages of main text are devoted to this.\nGiven the experience of the authors, this is a\npity. The advice in this part of the book is\nexcellent, but again suffers from the lack of\nspace devoted to it. To illustrate possibilities,\nthe authors choose to give tips in science\nteaching and music. Here, the problems of the\napproach are magnified, and the authors are\ninclined to make statements which are only\npartly true, such as 'Music scanning software\ncan read sheet music', or to minimize the\ndifficulties of a task with statements such as\n'Consider setting up virtual experiments'.\nThe style of the book is informal and friendly,\nand I would certainly recommend it to any\nteacher who has become aware of the\npossibilities of the computer in teaching and\nwants to know where to start. To the more\nexperienced, only a limited amount of the\nmaterial will be welcome.\nRobin Shaw, University of Glasgow\nResearch into Assessment and Evaluation in\nColleges and Universities by Kate Ashcroft and\nDavid Palacio, London: Kogan Page, 1996.\nISBN: 0-7494-1769-2. 156 pages, paperback.\n\u00a314.99.\nThis book does exactly what its title indicates: it\ndiscusses assessment and evaluation, and gives\nleads into how to pursue research into the area.\nThe research methods suggested are clear, and\nshould be able to be incorporated by all who\nteach. Indeed, as a result of reviewing this book,\nI have been inspired to carry out a small project\nevaluation.\nChapter 1 deals with types of research and how\nto begin. The standard qualitative and\nquantitative research principles are explained,\nand the chapter ends with various data-\ncollection techniques. Chapter 2 treats\nassessment and its purpose, while Chapter 3\nlooks at ways of judging reliability and validity,\nand systems for monitoring the quality of\nassessment within and between institutions. The\nrole of external bodies like HEQC and HEFC,\nand their function in quality assurance in\nteaching, is presented. Chapter 4, where there is\nsupport for the introduction of GNVQs in\nparallel with GCSEs and A-levels, with present\nresearch augmenting the trend towards\nformative assessment (traditionalists may\ndisagree with this view). Chapter 5 is about\nefficiency and effectiveness as they apply to\nassessment; new ways of assessing students are\nsuggested, and the use of a multiple-strategy\napproach to assessment is outlined. Topics dealt\nwith in this chapter include time issues, people\nissues, effectiveness and efficiency, opportunity\ncosts in managing assessment, teacher per-\nformance and recording student progress.\nChapter 6 treats evaluation and reflective\npractice; objective, outcome and transaction-led\nevaluation models are presented, and the\npurpose of evaluation, the monitoring process\nand models of quality with respect to evaluation\nare discussed. Chapter 7 deals with who and\nhow to evaluate; interviewing and other\nschemes are presented, including the familiar\nevaluation instruments: questionnaires, inter-\nviews, open and closed question types,\ndocument analysis (student diaries and learning\nlogs) and observation. The final chapter gives\npublishing guidance, and there is useful advice\non choosing a publisher, negotiating a contract,\nand writing for a journal. Each chapter offers\nan extensive reading list.\nAltogether, this book is a very useful guide for\nanyone involved wishing to research into\nassessment.\nHarish Ravat, De Montfort University\nLifelong Learning by Norman Longworth and\nKeith Davies, London: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN:\n0-7494-1972-5. 179 pages, paperback. \u00a318.99.\nThis pivotal book on lifelong learning is\nsubtitled 'New vision, new implications, new\nroles for people, organizations, nations and\ncommunities in the 21st century'. It defines\nlifelong learning as 'the development of human\npotential through a continuously supportive\nprocess which stimulates and empowers\nindividuals to acquire all the .knowledge, values,\nskills and understanding they will require.\nthroughout their lifetimes and to apply them\nwith confidence, creativity and enjoyment to all\nroles, circumstances and environments'.\nLifelong learning is simultaneously a practical\nconcept, equating vocational education and\ntraining with tangible outcomes such as wealth\nand prosperity, and a spiritual concept with\nhumanistic overtones. Lifelong learning is\nportrayed as the pragmatic alternative to\ncomplacency and fundamentalism which allows\nhuman beings to 'take control over their own\ndestiny, combining the skills of learning with\nthe power of knowledge and the joy of being\n78\nAn-J Volume 5 Number I\nhuman and alive' and thus to avoid 'descent\ninto a new dark age of the human spirit'.\nThrough its introduction and nine chapters, the\nbook sets out to make us question the rationale\nand fabric of traditional education and training\napproaches, and to establish lifelong learning\nway beyond adult education or continuing\nprofessional development. The chapter headings\nwill either make you smile or grimace, and\nactually do little to clarify their contents with\ntheir component verbiage apparently selected\nmore for rhyme than explicitness, but their\ncontent is worthwhile.\nChapter 1 (Returning to Learning: The Dawn\nof Understanding) outlines the driving forces\nfor the new learning initiatives at a global level.\nChapter 2 (Determining Learning: What in the\nWorld is Happening?) identifies eight paradigms\nwhich herald the lifelong learning age: influence\nof science and technology; restructuring of\nindustry; global demographics; influence of\ntelevision and other media; changes in the\nnature of work; focus on the individual;\nenvironmental imperatives; new global power\nstructures. Achievement of lifelong learning is\nfacilitated by four extant trends: increased use\nof education technology tools and techniques;\ngreater use of national and international\nnetworks; development of co-operative and\ntwo-way partnerships; and development of\nlearning organizations, and individual em-\npowerment. Chapter 3 (Learning Learning?\nSchools - Where Lifelong Learning Begins)\noutlines the desirable characteristics of a\nlifelong-learning school, and explores its\npotential interactions with the external\nenvironment. Chapter 4 (Learning for Earning:\nLearning for Survival) describes how industry\nand business is adapting, and must adapt, by\ndeveloping a learning approach to its essential\noperations. Chapter 5 (Turning to Learning:\nThe Growth of Learning Organizations)\noutlines ten characteristics of a learning\norganization, and includes a case study of the\nRover Group which since 1986 has taken\nserious steps to ensure its own future. Chapter 6\n(Yearning for Learning: New Visions for Old,\nNew Teachers for Old) explores some of the\nissues and challenges lifelong learning poses for\nteacher education. Chapter 7 (Discerning\nLearning: Higher Education and the Incoming\nTide) lists ten challenges or opportunities for\nhigher education. Again it is the relationship of\nthe university with the community at large\nwhich is the major focus of the chapter, and the\nrelevance of the academic content and the role\nof information technologies are key issues.\nChapter 8 (Burning for Learning: Lifelong\nLearning and the Quality of Life) explores the\ndevelopment of a global learning society.\nChapter 9 (Valediction: Learning Challenges for\na Learning Age) challenges the reader to\nparticipate in the implementation of some of the\nideas outlined in the book, and lists some fifteen\npersonal action points.\nThis topical, highly readable and thought-\nprovoking book is aimed at all those with an\ninterest and involvement in the development of\nopportunities for personal growth, either in a\ntraditional academic community or in a work-\nbased context, whether at a policy level or at a\nmore pragmatic level. If lifelong learning is the\nintellectual infrastructure for the new millen-\nnium, traditional physical and administrative\ninfrastructures need to be adapted to make sure\nthat it happens. The education and training\nparadigm for the new millennium has to be\n'more, better and wider', resulting in a more\nholistic and visionary view of education as a\nlifelong process. This book offers some insight\ninto the evolutionary and revolutionary ways\nthis can be achieved by encouraging the\ndevelopment of flexible and adaptable educa-\ntional systems that facilitate the development of\nflexible and adaptable individuals who know\nhow to think rather than what to think, and\nwho are thus better able to respond to future\ndemands and likely working patterns. As the\nbook concludes: 'Lifelong learning is not just\ndesirable, it is a survival issue for us all'.\nEleri Jones, University of Wales Institute,\nCardiff\nHyperwave - The Next Generation Web Solution\nby Herman Maurer, Reading MA: Addison-\nWesley, 1996. ISBN: 0-201-40346-3. 635 pages,\npaperback (CD-ROM included).\nAs World Wide Web publishers strive to outdo\neach other in offering more attractive, more\nuseful Web sites, they are often frustrated by the\nlimitations of the HyperText Mark-up\nLanguage (HTML) that Web pages are written\nin. The result is a proliferation of incremental\nsolutions in the form of HTML extensions and\nbrowser plug-ins. A team of researchers at Graz\nUniversity of Technology in Austria has been\nworking for several years to develop a better\nsystem for transmitting multimedia information\nover the Internet. Their system consists of server\n79\nReviews\nand client software and a protocol, Hyper-G,\nwhich allows a much richer communication\nbetween client and server. The Hyper-G system\nis now marketed commercially as Hyperwave,\nbut everywhere in the book, except in the title, it\nis referred to by its former name.\nChapter 1, the first of 31 chapters and 8\nappendices, claims a wide audience for the\nbook, from those who want to study the history\nand development of the Internet to those who\nwant a technical manual for setting up a Hyper-\nG Web server. Yet despite this claim, the\ndiscussion of Internet issues is more technical\nthan philosophical. And you have to read quite\nfar into the chapter before you find out that\nHyper-G is a whole suite of software for\nauthoring and exploring Internet-based\ninformation which offers much more than we\nare used to on the Web.\nChapter 2 gives a history of the Internet,\nexplaining all the terms and acronyms. There\nare sections covering FTP, Archie, WAIS,\nGopher and the Web. Those completely new to\nthese concepts may suffer from information\noverload as new terminology is thrown at them\nthick and fast. Every time a new term appears\nfor the first time, it is printed in bold face, and\nthere are often ten or more of these in a single\npage. Chapters 3 and 4 give a calmer and more\nreadable introduction to the history and\npossibilities of hypermedia systems. The history\nlesson continues in Chapters 6 and 7 which give\na detailed description of the history and\nworkings of Gopher and the Web. The basics of\nHTML are explained and there are short\ndescriptions of the most popular HTML\neditors, browsers and server software.\nReferences to Web addresses (URLs) are\nfrequently given.\nIn between, in Chapter 5, we learn how Hyper-\nG fits in. A Hyper-G Web server is able to\ngenerate HTML Web pages 'on the fly' when\nreceiving requests from an ordinary Web\nbrowser. The server maintains a database of\ninformation and links which allows the site to\nbe dynamically reconfigured, while maintaining\nthe integrity of the links. There are also a\nnumber of native Hyper-G clients for Unix,\nWindows and Macintosh platforms. These can\nfunction as ordinary Web browsers but, when\nconnected to a Hyper-G server, can make full\nuse of the advanced features of the system. They\ncan display HTML, postscript documents,\nvideo clips and three dimensional models, all\nwith embedded links. They can also build two-\nand three-dimensional maps of the information\nspace on the server, allowing you to find the\ninformation you want more easily. And you can\ncommunicate with others using the same server.\nChapter 8 discusses, in some detail, the\nlimitations of a Web site based simply on a\ncollection of linked HTML files, and Chapters 9\nto 13 describe the Hyper-G solution to these\nproblems. A Hyper-G site is dynamic structure\nof multimedia documents with facilities for\naccess control, version control and consistency\nof links and of cached information. All aspects\nof a Hyper-G server seem to have been covered;\nmultilingual documents, connections to\ndatabases through CGI and SQL gateways,\nsophisticated methods for representing and\nsearching information spaces, and production\nof stand-alone versions of sites for distribution\non CD-ROM. The following seven chapters\nmake up a technical manual for all the software\nso far described and its use with existing Web\nand Gopher severs. Chapter 22 describes the\ngeneral principles of structuring information\nwith Hyper-G, and is followed by five chapters\nwhich explain how to achieve this with the tools\nprovided on the CD-ROM. Further technical\ndetail is given in the appendices.\nChapters 28 to 30 describe a variety of\napplications which make use of the features of\nthe Hyper-G system. Examples are given of\nsuccessful, virtual versions of conferences,\nexhibitions and committees. Electronic publish-\ning is also described in some detail, covering\nissues such as electronic refereeing and the\nrelative advantages of various document file\nformats. Chapter 30 describes and compares\nvarious systems for secure Internet com-\nmunications and electronic funds transfer.\nChapter 31 lists anticipated developments in the\nHyper-G system which will increase the number\nof document formats supported and its use for\nmanaging electronic libraries. The main text\nends with a final sales pitch for the advantages\nof moving your Web site to a Hyper-G server.\nThe CD ROM contains software (also available\nfrom ftp:\/\/ftp.iicm.tu-graz.ac.at\/Hyperwave) to\nimplement a Unix-based Hyper-G server\n(although you are not allowed to use it for\ncommercial purposes) and Hyper-G clients for\nUnix and Windows. There are also some good\nexamples of Hyper-G multimedia databases.\nThe software is quite complex, and the user-\ninterface is not intuitive. I was not able to get\n80\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nthe Amadeus (Windows) client to connect to an\nexternal Hyper-G server, and although I did get\nit to connect to Web servers, I could not\nproperly display the Web pages I received. I\nsuspect that I shall have to delve much more\ndeeply into the pages of the manual to find out\nhow to configure the system properly.\nHyperwave\/Hyper-G is a well-thought out\nprotocol which releases much more of the\npotential of the Internet than the simplistic\nHTML which has made the Internet so popular.\nIt is likely to be one of a number of competing\nsystems for enhancing the capabilities of the\nInternet, but I fear that it will be too complex\nand too different from HTML-based systems to\nwin the battle.\nRichard Storer, University of Paisley\nManaging Multimedia by Elaine England and\nAndy Finney, Reading MA and Harlow: Addison\nWesley, 1996. ISBN: 0-201-87739-2. 346 pages,\npaperback, plus CD-ROM. \u00a328.27.\nThis book begins with the claim that it 'is useful\nfor anyone studying or practising multimedia '\nand, perhaps surprisingly, it is. Experienced\nmultimedia project managers may find little that\nthey have not already learned (the hard way),\nbut they will probably find it both gratifying\nand useful to have the detailed concerns of the\nlife-cycle of a complex multimedia project so\nlucidly articulated. Less experienced project\nmanagers, multimedia developers and students\nof multimedia should find this book and its\naccompanying CD-ROM a mine of useful\ninformation.\nThe book is divided into nineteen chapters\ncovering the entire cycle of a project from its\ninception to the necessary and often forgotten\nprocess of archiving all the records of the\nproject for future use. The first two chapters set\nout the issues surrounding multimedia project\nmanagement, and the remaining seventeen\nconsider in some detail what is required\nsatisfactorily to complete a multimedia project.\nThus the book begins with a discussion of how\nto 'scope a project' and turn it into a clearly\narticulated proposal that can in turn be\nconverted into a contract. Subsequent chapters\ndeal with issues like how to choose the\nappropriate platform and how to select and\nmanage a team. Others focus on the issues\nsurrounding the production of the various\nmedia assets. These chapters give a brief\nintroduction to the technical details of such\nthings as audio-video production, as well as\ninsights into how to achieve quality results.\nAdditionally, there are chapters that deal with a\nrange of pertinent legal issues including the\nthorny problem of intellectual property rights.\nAs the title, Managing Multimedia, suggests, the\nbook adopts the perspective of the project\nmanager in order to chart a path through the\ncomplexities of multimedia production and\nseeks to identify his or her responsibilities at\neach stage of the process. Indeed, each chapter\nbegins with a brief description of the project\nmanager's responsibilities vis-a-vis that\nchapter's principal concerns, be they contract\nnegotiations or ensuring the timely production\nof quality audio-visual assets. Each chapter also\ncontains a brief section entitled \"Theory into\npractice' which offers some practical\nsuggestions about how to relate that chapter's\ndiscussion to one's own work. There is also a\nsummary for each chapter and, as appropriate,\nrecommendations for further reading.\nThe accompanying CD contains supplementary\nmaterial for many of the chapters. By\ncomparison with the book, however, the CD is\nrather disappointing. It contains the summaries\nof each chapter, and this provides a helpful and\neasy way to navigate around the text. But the\nfull text is not there, although there would\nappear to have been room to have included it\nStill more puzzlingly, even the recommended\nreading is not there, nor is it ever gathered\ntogether into a complete bibliography. There\nare also one or two other less important oddities\nabout the CD. It was almost impossible to get it\nout of the sleeve containing it, and it was\nimpossible to return it there. And interestingly,\nalthough the CD is programmed in HTML to\nrun under Windows Explorer, and users are\ncautioned that it may not work as well with\nother browsers, I actually found that it\nperformed better under Netscape than under\nExplorer. However, this may have been a\nfunction of the different graphics capabilities of\nthe test machines.\nDespite these reservations, it should be stressed\nthat most of what is there is very useful. There is\na glossary of terms (also included in print in the\nbook), a selection of multimedia assets that give\nexamples of the impact on quality of various\nproduction techniques, and demonstration\nversions of several multimedia authoring and\nediting tools. But perhaps the most useful things\non the CD, or indeed in the book, are the range\n81\nReviews\nof sample documents and tables that can help\nwith the planning, organization and\nmanagement of a project. These include a\nquestionnaire to help scope a project, and\nsample rights agreements. Unfortunately, some\nof the useful documents in the book, such as the\ntable of multimedia costs, inexplicably do not\nappear on the CD.\nOne other aspect of the book that may initially\nconcern readers of ALT-J is the book's self-\nconfessedly commercial slant. It very\nsuccessfully seeks to 'cover all the phases for\ndeveloping a team-based, client driven,\ncommercial project which uses the equivalent of\nsome original video footage, a range of audio\nassets, and commercially sourced and in-house\nproduced graphics'. Some academic readers\nmay feel this slant is inappropriate for them, but\nthis would be a mistake. As the authors rightly\npoint out, \"The major differences between non-\ncommercial and commercial projects are the\namount and type of rights clearances that are\nneeded, as well as the smaller production scale\nwhere fewer staff are used in audio, video and\ngraphics production.' If you are working on\nthese types of project you may not have as\nmany administrative and legal aspects to cover,\nbut many will be the same, just needed on a\nsmaller scale.\nOne can say that despite its typically high price\n(\u00a328.27), Managing Multimedia can be\nrecommended as a useful core textbook for the\nburgeoning number of undergraduate and\npostgraduate courses in multimedia. It is also a\nvaluable reference book for those of us, whether\nin the commercial or academic worlds, charged\nwith managing the production of multimedia\nmaterials. Certainly, it is my intention to keep\nthis book very close to hand.\nBruce Douglas Ingraham, University of Teesside\nDigital Creativity (Proceedings of the First\nConference on Computers in Art and Design\nEducation, CADE 95), edited by Suzette\nWorden, Brighton: University of Brighton, 1995.\nISBN: 1-871-966-23X. CD-ROM. \u00a315.00.\nThis is a CD-ROM, and an interesting way of\npresenting the proceedings of a conference\n(although unfortunately it can only be used on a\nMacintosh computer). The use of a CD-ROM\nhas allowed the editor not only to provide all\nthe papers and keynote speeches, as you would\nexpect in a book of conference proceedings, but\nalso a method by which some of the exhibitors\nat the conference can show their exhibits to a\nwider audience. The editor has also included a\nset of reflections on the conference from people\nattending.\nThe conference proceedings are in an archived\nsection, and the prospect of printing off a whole\nbook is not one I expected to do when offering\nto review this CD-ROM, so I have not looked\nat the papers in detail (a printed book of the\nconference proceedings is available, but it was\nnot sent for review). But the archive does\nprovide the posters, workshop papers,\npostgraduate papers, demonstration papers,\nand evening session papers, none of which is\navailable in the book, and this represents a\nwealth of material not normally available\noutside a conference. The editor provides the\npapers in Word or plain text form, and there is\na contents list which is very useful. Also in the\narchive section are a number of pictures by\nvarious artists (in JPEG format).\nThe suggested formal approach to using this\nCD-ROM is to start with the attendees'\n'Reflections'. Unfortunately, however, the\nnavigation tools I would have expected in this\nprogram leave much to be desired. And\n'Reflections' has some very noisy distracting\nmusic on it: on my Mac, the CD-ROM program\noverrode the computer's volume control.\nFurthermore, the start of 'Reflections' is a good\nexample of how not to communicate essential\ninformation to a user. The first scene loops\ncontinuously until you click the mouse, though\nnothing tells you to do that. And the navigation\ninformation on the next screen is very difficult\nto read. Indeed, the first time through I did not\nrealize it was anything more than a jumble of\ndifferent-sized letters. Because the music was so\nloud, I switched off my computer. The second\ntime, having taken precautions to deaden the\nnoise, it became clear that the letters were giving\nout some information. One or two clear, always\nvisible buttons, are needed. Essential navigation\nbuttons have to be discovered at the bottom\ncentre of the screen by passing the mouse cursor\nover them. Having found that the index also\nhad the mixture of letters, I seriously wondered\nat this point if I was the audience this CD-ROM\nwas meant for. Clear communication of basic\nnavigation is of prime importance when\ndesigning something like this, and it is sadly\nmissing here.\nThe menu allows you to hear different people's\n82\nAn-J Volume 5 Number I\nreflections on the conference under the themes\nDigital Creativity, Art and Design, Work\nProcess and the Future. Clicking on the words\nin the index takes you to another area showing\nquotations on this subject from different people.\nClicking on the quotation brings up the picture\nof the person and his or her name, and clicking\non the picture starts them talking. Though I am\nsure that this was not the intention, I found that\nwhen you click on a quotation to get a picture,\nyou have to click again to get them to speak,\nwhich allowed me the luxury of pausing in\nsilence. It is quite interesting to hear different\npeople's short reflections on the conference,\nthough it is all rather bitty.\nThe last section is 'Creations', an area which\nshows various people's work based on using a\ncomputer. There is a lack of information about\neach creation, and you just have to try them\nout. What is more, it soon becomes clear that\nsome of the work was at an early stage before\npublication: it would perhaps have been better\nnot to include it, for what is acceptable at a\nconference is not necessarily acceptable away\nfrom it. One interesting piece, however, is\n'Word beyond speech', a mix of sound in the\nform of speech and music, and words on the\nscreen moving and changing, which as a piece of\ndynamic art I found intriguing. In this section\nyou can also access the movie clips used in\n'Reflections'.\nCertainly, if you would like to have been at the\nconference and could not get there, this CD-\nROM will give you a better idea of what went\non than would be possible in a printed book.\nBut I came away from using it very concerned\nthat the problems of basic communication\nrequirements outlined above did not seem to\nhave been addressed in a product describing a\nconference on Art and Design education.\nSheila Stone, Open University\nStudents as Tutors and Mentors, edited by\nSinclair Goodlad, London: Kogan Page, 1996.\nISBN: 0-7494-1792-7. Paperback. \u00a314.95.\nDevelopments in communications and\ninformation technology have allowed students\nto become responsible for their own learning.\nIndeed, nowadays there is often a lack of\ndistinction between the teacher as student and\nthe student as teacher. While technology allows\nroles to develop and change, we need a robust\n. warrant for such changes. The involvement of\nstudents as mentors in learning opportunities\nseems an appropriate context.\nRecent technology-led developments have\nfacilitated this partnership though Computer\nSupported Collaborative Learning. Un-\nfortunately, this book does not help. It came\nabout as a result of a BP-supported conference,\nStudents as Tutors and Mentors, held in 1995.\nThe involvement of BP arose with their interest\nin lifelong learning and their support for the\nInternational Mentoring and Tutoring Project\nat Imperial College back in 1990. The sixteen\nchapters of the book reflect many and varied\nperspectives of different authors who attended\nthe conference and who describe and evaluate -\nin some instances - case studies and\ndevelopment programmes in mentoring.\nMentoring, in my mind, is the facilitation of\nlearning. However, this book takes an\norganizational view of mentoring.\nSinclair Goodlad, from Imperial College, sets\nthe scene, and the final chapter is by Sir\nChristopher Ball. Ball (who authored the\nseminal RSA report 'Start Right' in 1994) lays\nout the challenge of lifelong learning and\nestablishes the importance of interdependence\nof the teacher and the taught. He makes much\nof what he calls 'applied intelligence', and\nsupports the Big Idea that the world is ready to\ngrasp the importance of learning as a\ncommodity in the First World's post-industrial\nsociety. Much of the book is about changing\nroles, and only by implication about learning. I\nwould like to have seen the influence of\ninformation and communications technology\nhighlighted.\nWhile the book is important in the field of\nlifelong learning, it will be somewhat\nimpenetrable for those with a technology\norientation. It does demonstrate the breadth of\nthe educational field, but learning technologists\nwill, I fear, have difficulty with the jargon of\nlifelong learning - 'tis a pity, but 'tis true.\nRay McAleese, Heriot-Watt University\nLearning Contracts: A Practical Guide by Geoff\nAnderson, David Boud and Jane Sampson,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN: 0-7494-\n1847-8.150 pages, paperback. \u00a318.99.\nThis is a very useful book. David Boud first\nbecame an author to check out when I was\ncatching up with most other people on problem-\nbased learning approaches to curriculum\n83\nReviews\ndevelopment (see, for example, Boud and Feletti\nin The Challenge of Problem-Based Learning,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1991 and 1994). Learning\ncontracts, as a concept, made sense to me but I\nneeded some rationale and description for this\nthat HE teachers could relate to whatever their\ndiscipline, and generate their own ideas rather\nthan revising mine (which activity belongs more\nusefully in a later brainstorming stage). What is\na learning contract? Answering this question\nforms the opening paragraph of Chapter 1 of\nthis book. The authors say it is 'a written\nagreement negotiated between a learner and a\nteacher, lecturer or staff adviser, that a\nparticular activity will be undertaken in order to\nachieve a specific learning goal or goals'. This\nimplies that it will vary widely across teaching\nand learning situations while retaining an\nessential defining feature as 'a document used to\nassist the planning of a learning project'.\nThe book is subtitled A Practical Guide -\nappropriately. Without leaning heavily on\ntheory (though with appropriate references), its\nchapters explain the idea and its rationale,\nprovide templates, describe cases, then leave it\nto the reader to test the value of the practice. It\nis a good strategy for more than simply agreeing\nlearning objectives and assessment procedures.\nBoth are called into question and tested against\neach other at all stages in the contractual\ninteraction - once an agreement is signed, the\nteacher and the students should at least have a\nshared model of what any given learning\nprogramme is for and how it should be\nprogressed through.\nThat is the ideal, of course. Just putting\ntogether a piece of paper which provides a few\nbullet points from a QA document draft or, far\nworse, an unreasonable target that a student\nfinds so hard to interpret that he\/she simply\ncomplies and hopes that understanding will\nfollow, are possible outcomes from a universal\nacceptance of learning contracts as an integral\npart of any HE course. Familiarity breeds\ncontent that is often devoid of real meaning\nand, to work properly, the thing has to be for\nreal, on both sides, and manageable.\nMoreover, there will (hopefully) be situations\nwhere the learning intentions, resourcing and\nrewards evolve as a course develops. To\nconstrain development by too strong a\ndelineation of goal and practice would be\ncounter-productive. This book has common-\nsense advice on writing learning objectives and\nidentifying appropriate learning resources, with\nstrategies for their use. There is a section on the\nneeds of both learners and teachers and a final,\nimportant chapter points to the limits of\nlearning contracts.\nThis is not a long book, and rather than extend\nthis review any further, I just recommend\nbuying it, reading it and lending it to your\nstudents so they can work out the point for\nthemselves. One problem: although it sets the\nstage and provides some examples, it will not\nwrite your contract for you. That will actually\nbe the hard part, and so it should be.\nErica McAteer, University of Glasgow\nDeveloping CGI Applications with Perl, by John\nDeep and Peter Holfelder, New York: John\nWiley & Sons, 1996. ISBN: 0-471-14158-5. 299\npages, paperback. \u00a322.50.\nThe World Wide Web is now being used quite\nextensively for marketing, tele-shopping, online\nordering, making reservations, survey analysis\nusing electronic questionnaires and, of course,\nonline student testing in order to assess\nknowledge uptake and skill acquisition. Many\nof these kinds of application require levels of\ninteractivity over and above those which can be\nachieved using simple hypertext markup\nlanguage (HTML). Two important ways of\nachieving this interactivity are through the use\nof Java applets and\/or the Common Gateway\nInterface (CGI). This book deals with the latter\napproach.\nThe material in the book is arranged into\nseventeen chapters that together cover most of\nthe important material needed to write CGI\napplications using HTML and the Perl\nprogramming language. Although most of the\nchapters have been written by Deep and\nHolfelder themselves, some of the others have\nbeen produced by a team of contributing\nauthors.\nThe opening chapters provide a brief overview\nof the Web, a description of its rapid\ndevelopment since its inception in 1990, and a\nsummary of its important features (such as\nbrowsers, URLs and HTML). The special\n'forms' features of HTML are then described in\nChapter 3, while Chapter 4 explains the CGI\nand how it can be used to handle data generated\nfrom within Web forms applications. This leads\ninto an introductory chapter on Perl and a very\ninformative chapter that describes and discusses\n84\nAn-} Volume 5 Number I\nthe HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\nHaving discussed the basics in Chapters 1 to 6,\nsubsequent chapters go on to explore CGI\napplications in more detail. Many of the scripts\ndescribed are available on the Web at\nhttp:\/\/worldwidemart.com\/scripts\/.\nThe first in-depth application looks at the\nFormMail script for decoding and parsing\nHTML form data (which it echoes back as email\nto the person who entered it). The next\napplication considers how to create a Free for All\nLink Page script which allows any user to add\nURL linkages and descriptive material on the fly.\nSubsequent chapters describe the Perl CGI\nscripts and HTML code for the implementation\nof various types of application: a countdown\ntimer for future dates, the display of randomly\nselected images, a guest book, the creation of\ndynamic documents, and many other useful\nfacilities. Of the chapters that make up the\napplications section of the book, Chapter 14 is by\nfar the longest. It deals with the development of a\nWeb-based project information management\nsystem (called PIMS) for large, multi-site\nengineering projects. Some of the other\ninteresting topics covered include an Oracle\ngateway and the creation of dynamic documents.\nThis book provides a useful application-driven\napproach to. understanding something of Perl\nand the types of processing that it can be used\nfor (based on the analysis of form data and the\ndynamic creation of Web pages). Although it\ndoes not deal directly with any educational\napplications of CGI and Perl (such as online\nstudent testing with real-time feedback), anyone\nwanting to develop materials of this soft would\nundoubtedly find this book a very useful source\nof technical help.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nResource-based Learning edited by Sally Brown\nand Brenda Smith, London: Kogan Page in\nassociation with SEDA (the Staff and Educa-\ntional Development Association), 1996. ISBN:\n0-494-1932-6. 154 pages, paperback. \u00a318.99.\nThis is a fifteen-chapter edited collection of\nideas about resource-based learning drawn from\nexperiences of its use. Some of the contributors\nare well-known in the field.\nThe editors open by discussing what resource-\nbased learning is. They point out that the phrase\ncan be used to describe a wide range of\nsituations, but essentially the book is concerned\nwith how non-human resources can help\nsupport significant amounts of independent\nlearning. This does not preclude the\ninvolvement of human tutors, but does involve\nthe use of resource materials such as printed\nstudy guides and workbooks, multimedia\npackages, computer-based learning material,\nand material delivered over the World Wide\nWeb.\nIn a sense, resource-based learning is nothing\nnew. What is new is that some now regard it as\na means of coping with the increased demands\nupon the UK higher-education system.\nHowever, most contributors indicate that\nresource-based learning is not a cheap option.\nEffective materials are costly to develop, have a\nlimited shelf-life, and factors such as students'\nstudy skills, management of students' activities,\nstaff induction and the provision of human\ntutorial support can all be critical to success or\nfailure.\nIn Chapter 2, Graham Gibbs takes up the issue\nof success and failure with a mythical account\nof one lecturer's attempt to introduce resource-\nbased learning into a course, impeded at every\nstage by inflexibility within the institution,\nmanagement, colleagues and even the students\nthemselves. There is not enough money for\nprinting; essential formative progress tests\nwithin the materials have to be made voluntary\nbecause the institution allows only one unit of\nassessment per course, and so the students\nignore them; the Department is fined for not\nusing the teaching rooms allocated; and so on,\nlayer upon layer. The punch line is that this is\nnot parody but a composite of factors actually\nobserved during an HEFC-funded study. This\nleads on to a discussion of how such problems\ncan be avoided through appropriate strategies\nfor implementing and supporting resource-\nbased learning. Most have institution-wide\nimplications and require commitment at many\nlevels. An additional point is that we cannot\ncost resource-based learning by the crude\ncounting of teaching hours. All kinds of\nconsiderations such as accommodation and\nassessment costs, drop-out rates and library use\nneed to be taken into the equation.\nMany of the following chapters consider\nresource-based learning from the perspective of\ndifferent stakeholders. Phil Race addresses the\ndevelopment of students' study skills so that\nthey can make effective use of the ever-widening\nrange of learning materials. Chris Rust and\n85\nReviews\nJames Wisdom discuss the skills staff need to\ndevelop resources, from planning to the\nincorporation of learning activities into the\nmaterials. Brown and Smith (again) provide a\nlist of ideas for staff development in the use of\nresource-based learning. Andrew Charlett\ndescribes how a distance-learning course in\nBuilding Studies was designed and run, and\nCharley Hardwick considers the implications of\nresource-based learning for libraries and\ninformation services. Two chapters describe the\nsetting up of open learning resource centres, one\nof these in industry.\nCultural issues are discussed in several chapters.\nBoth Leslie Mapp and Nick Slope discuss some\nof the difficulties that could arise if resource-\nbased learning leads to a move away from\ntraditional campus-based education. Mary\nThorpe explores a number of issues associated\nwith the increased use of innovative\ntechnologies, and how their evaluation may\ncause us 'to review accepted truths and\ncherished viewpoints'.\nBernard Lisewski and Chris Settle discuss the\nuse of multimedia CD-ROM to replace twenty\nhours of lectures in a Weed Biology course.\nThey cover issues such as the removal of the\nstudent time-management structure that\nlectures provide, benefits perceived by students,\nthe danger that students may regard a resource\nas the only source to be used, and the relative\nstrengths of CD-ROM and the World Wide\nWeb. This chapter is not a description of what\nwas done, but a well-informed and well-\nconsidered discussion of the integration of\nlearning technology and its evaluation.\nAs with many collections of this kind,\ncontributions are varied in both viewpoint and\nquality. Some tend in places towards over-\ngeneralization, others are parochial, one is\nbasically a set of checklists. I particularly liked a\ncouple of chapters, but different readers will\nprobably find different things of interest. In\nsum, the book discusses a variety of angles and\nexperiences of resource-based learning and\ncould be helpful background reading for course\ndevelopers or individuals considering\nincorporating it into their teaching.\nRobert Ward, University of Huddersfield\n86\n"}
