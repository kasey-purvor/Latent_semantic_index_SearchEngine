Littlejohn and Lorraine A. J. Stefani\nCentre for Academic Practice, University of Strathclyde,\nemail: allison.littlejohn@strath.ac.uk\nThere is a revolutionary culture change taking place within higher education in the\nUnited Kingdom. Part of this change is the adoption of new communication and\ninformation technologies (C&IT), such as the World Wide Web (WWW), for teaching,\nlearning and assessment. Many academics have limited experience of the WWW for\nteaching and learning and perceive that the use of new technologies involves transferring\ntraditional teaching methods into an electronic format, with no regard for the underlying\npedagogical implications. Our current research with teaching staff has given insight into\nessential skills and competencies required to empower the use of C&IT bearing in mind\nthe importance of the underlying pedagogy. In this paper we present an analysis of\nresearch carried out with academic staff members to determine the nature of staff and\nstudent skills needs regarding the use of C&IT in teaching and learning. This analysis is\nfollowed by a case study of how these findings were incorporated into the development\nand implementation of a staff development programme aimed at encouraging innovative\nteaching at the University of Strathclyde.\nThe importance of the effective use of C&IT in teaching and learning\nIn the context of academic induction courses, exploring conceptions of teaching and\nlearning with new staff members confirms the notion that many academic staff want to\nteach as they have been taught. To encourage the adoption of new instructional strategies\nrequires raising awareness of how students learn and supporting efforts to teach differently.\nCreative and flexible teaching requires an awareness of different methodologies,\ndeveloping new skills with these methodologies and knowing when to apply these methods\nto optimize students' learning. The process of managing teaching for effective learning is\nfurther complicated when staff are expected to use new technologies. Some staff members\nshow an added level of reluctance to engage in constructive dialogue about changes in\nframeworks for learning and teaching when the potential of communications and\ninformation technology (C&IT) is discussed.\n66\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nAn analysis of current literature supports the view that there is a limited conception\namongst higher education teaching staff of how to use the WWW effectively for teaching\nand learning (Thomas, Carswell, Petre and Price, 1998). Their own undergraduate\nexperience was likely to have been within a traditional university setting, so it may be\ndifficult to conceive of a whoie new framework. During our experience in facilitating staff\ndevelopment courses in using C&IT for teaching and learning we have found that academics\noften view the WWW as another means by which they can 'deliver lecture notes', ignoring\nthe importance of student dialogue. Current trends in higher education requiring increased\nstudent numbers are reducing the possibility of student-lecturer dialogue, which can in turn\nlead to students adopting a surface approach to learning (Mayes, 1995). This alarming trend\nmay be exacerbated when using new methods of C&IT because students and tutors have not\ndiscussed and agreed on a new teaching and learning framework and thus tutor and student\nresponsibilities are unclear (Stefani and Nicol, 1997). The outcome for students is that\ncourse material may be unclear, difficult to navigate and non-engaging. This can be boring\nand demotivating, often further promoting surface learning. Students also need the\nopportunity to learn how to use available technologies responsibly and effectively in their\nlearning, but all too often they are not given clear guidance on how to achieve this goal.\nThus it is clear that C&IT literacy skills for both staff and students must be incorporated\ninto an overall strategy. The development of such strategies requires further research into\nthe support needs for staff and students in higher education.\nResearch and development carried out with staff from across several higher education\ninstitutions has highlighted a number of perceived barriers to staff willingness to embrace\nC&IT as a tool to enhance the teaching and learning environment (Stefani and Littlejohn,\n1998; Littlejohn and Sclater, 1998). One of these perceived barriers can be articulated\nsimply as the 'skills gap', which exists for both staff and students with respect to effective\nuse of C&IT. At a deeper level this particular barrier can be expressed in terms of many\nacademic staff showing a lack of understanding of their pedagogical role in a C&IT-based\ninstructional environment. This interpretation is based on comments from many staff who\ndisplay a reluctance to adopt teaching strategies that are different from those which they\nthemselves experienced and a difficulty in acknowledging a theoretical underpinning of\nteaching and learning strategies.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a report of research carried out with academic staff\nmembers to determine the nature of staff and student skills needs regarding the use of\nC&IT in teaching and learning. This analysis is followed by a description of how these\nfindings were incorporated into a staff development programme aimed at encouraging\ninnovative teaching at the University of Strathclyde.\nExploring the skills gap: classroom research\nStaff perceptions of the learning skills required by students and the skills required by\nteachers were explored by asking two key questions:\n1. What skills, competencies and attributes do students require so that they can learn\nactively and effectively in a technological environment?\n2. What skills, competencies and attributes do tutors require in order to facilitate learning\nin a technological environment?\n67\nAJ\u00fcson H. Littlejohn and Lorraine A.J. Stefar\u00edi Effective use of communication and information technology\nStaff perceptions of the required student learning skills\nAcademic staff are expressing a growing concern over the 'skills gap' with respect to the\neffective use of C&IT to enhance and enrich the teaching and learning environment.\nResearch was carried out with academic staff from both the higher and further education\nsectors to determine the precise nature of this perceived skills deficit. This work was\nundertaken with academic staff members across several academic institutions and also in\nthe context of workshops facilitated by the authors (for example Stefani and Littlejohn,\n1998; Littlejohn and Cameron, 1998; Littlejohn and Sclater, 1998). Not surprisingly a\nvaried picture emerges from the responses to the first key question, but it is possible to sift\nout a coherent list of the core skills and attributes which academic and related staff believe\nstudents require in order to learn effectively in a technological environment:\n\u2022 basic study skills, e.g. reading, note-taking, ability to digest and analyse information;\n\u2022 higher level study skills, e.g. thinking skills, critical reading and analysing skills;\n\u2022 high-level problem-solving skills;\n\u2022 an ability to formulate and articulate questions;\n\u2022 motivation to learn;\n\u2022 basic knowledge and understanding of IT skills such as filing, navigating and browsing\nskills;\n\u2022 a concept of virtuality;\n\u2022 an ability to work with others in a virtual environment and engage in asynchronous\ndiscussion;\n\u2022 an open mind about the role of new technology in learning.\nIn addition to examining this list and its potential bearing on course and curriculum\ndevelopment it is worthwhile fully articulating some of the key comments made by\nacademic staff in response to this question. One of the most interesting findings is the fact\nthat more than half the skills articulated are required of students irrespective of their\nlearning environment, whether real or virtual. This reinforces the point that the use of\nC&IT cannot in itself transform teaching, learning and assessment. This will only be\nachieved by review and redevelopment of the curriculum and of the underlying pedagogies.\nThe view that the success of using C&IT for teaching and learning depends not so much on\nthe technology as on the course and curriculum design has long been echoed by pioneers in\nthe field of C&IT (Reiser, 1994). Yet many staff development courses still aim to support\nthe use of C&IT in teaching and learning by focusing on technology rather than on\npedagogical issues. Clearly a stronger emphasis on learning issues is required. Ehrmann\n(1995) makes the point that if you are headed in the wrong direction, technology will not\nget you to the right place.\nSome staff believed that students require extrinsic motivation to use new technologies and\nthat they require 'good learning experiences' to counteract their fears or phobias about\nnew technologies. Student enthusiasm may depend on prior experience of technology. At\ntimes students are subjected to boring computer-aided learning packages by teachers who\ndo not recognize that technology is only a tool which, when used properly, still requires\n68\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nthat academic staff facilitate the student learning using this new tool. To interest students\nin technology there is perhaps a need for a more explicit articulation of the learning goals -\nan important issue in conventional courses as well as online teaching and learning\n(Steinbach, 1997).\nOur developmental work with staff indicated a positive sense that the use of online courses\nincorporating computer simulation scenarios which encompass information-gathering,\ninformation analysis and problem-solving enable students to develop higher-level cognitive\nskills such as critical thinking, analysing and problem-solving. Laurillard (1993) explored\nthis issue in some depth in her book on Rethinking University Teaching. She supports this\nnotion that higher-level skills can be cultivated within a virtual learning environment which\nadapts to the input provided by the student. The intrinsic feedback to the student provides\na powerful learning experience, but only if the feedback pertains to the desired learning\noutcome. In other words, feedback which is poorly constructed will not lead to effective\nlearning. Recently there has been an alarming trend in higher education leading to a\nreduction in feedback to students. In an article in The Times Higher Education Supplement,\nTerry Mayes (1997) suggested how this trend might be reversed in a reasonably efficient\nand effective way. Student feedback can take several forms: from dialogue between learner\nand teacher or peers to direct interaction with courseware. One of the most powerful\nfeatures of new technologies is that they can render these dialogues 'reusable learning\nresources'. For example student-teacher dialogues can be recorded and set up as\nFrequently Asked Questions and so on (Mayes, 1997). This factor addresses one of the\nmajor conflicts expressed by staff. Such issues cannot be ignored if the use of technology is\nto be appropriately embedded into the student learning experience. What matters most is\nthe effective development of educational strategies for using technology, which can\ninfluence the student's total course of study.\nStaff perceptions of the required skills for teachers\nResponses to the second key question reveal a fairly broad picture, but it is possible to distil\na list of skills and attributes most commonly mentioned by academics in different settings:\n\u2022 flexibility in approach to teaching and an openness to the use of new;\n\u2022 technologies as another teaching tool;\n\u2022 an understanding of learning styles and experiences;\n\u2022 good communication skills;\n\u2022 comfort with subject material;\n\u2022 a willingness to learn from your students;\n\u2022 a knowledge of your own limitations;\n\u2022 a willingness to consider pedagogical issues associated with teaching and learning using\nnew technologies;\n\u2022 modelling the learning process through experimentation with new technologies and\nmaking the skills explicit;\n\u2022 IT literacy skills;\n69\nAllison H. Littiejohn and Lorraine A.}. Stefoni \u2022 Effective use of communication and information technology\n\u2022 an ability to face up to your fears of IT;\n\u2022 knowledge of when to use what type of technology.\nIn addition to the list of core skills and attributes it is again worthwhile expanding on the\ndialogue between staff who participated in this project and the authors. One of the most\ninteresting comments was that the increased emphasis on the use of new technologies in\nteaching and learning was in essence providing an opportunity for academic staff to\nrediscover pedagogy. This issue is strongly reflected in the fact that many of the key issues\narticulated pertain not only to the use of C&IT, but also to conventional teaching and\nlearning scenarios (for example Ramsden, 1992).\nIn pursuing this particular point staff commented that with the shift to a more C&IT-\nbased instructional environment lecturers\/tutors should show a level of openness to the use\nof new technologies as another teaching technique, tool or method when appropriate. In\nother words one of the key skills for teachers may be expressed as knowing how to blend\nknowledge of the content of a course with higher-order pedagogical objectives using the\nmethodologies and tools best suited to the learning context. Staff therefore require a level\nof awareness of different ways of managing teaching and learning. These findings\nhighlight the importance of linking student learning outcomes with curriculum design and\nthe selection of appropriate media (Conole and Oliver, 1998).\nWithin higher education there is an increasing expectation that learners be supported in\ndeveloping transferable skills enabling them to mature as independent learners (Harvey,\nMoon and Geal, 1997). The qualities which are increasingly sought in the educated\ngraduate do not include the ability to absorb and regurgitate a vast body of factual\ninformation, but rather the ability and skills associated with finding, evaluating and\napplying needed information (Breivik, 1997). These qualities combined with a desire to\nenable students to be autonomous self-directed learners (Cowan, 1988; Stefani, 1998)\nprepared for life-long learning allows anvessential list of skills which need to be embedded\nwithin the undergraduate curriculum. These skills include the ability to search for online\nresources, use online teaching materials, exchange ideas and engage in online dialogue, log\non from home, retrieve course online information, publish assignments on the WWW and\nreceive feedback online. A coherent curriculum focused on the student using C&IT tools to\nmanage students' learning has at its core the underlying principle of developing these\nessential skills. If these are not incorporated the outcome will be graduates who will be\ninclined to opt for resources that are easiest to access, irrespective of their validity and\nvalue. Sources such as books, journals, online databases and CD-ROMs are all learning\ntools which we must encourage students to use effectively as a matter of course. Therefore\nthe increased emphasis on C&IT may provide a platform for the development of a\npedagogy for the new millennium.\nSupporting students in the use of C&IT: reflections on pedagogy\nReflecting on our classroom research tells us about underlying pedagogies and the need to\nensure compatibility between the use of C&IT and effective student learning. Our research\ninto the skills gap associated with teaching and learning in a technological environment\nillustrates that university teachers have a good understanding of the barriers to effective\nuse of new technologies in teaching and learning. But many of the responses to our two\n70\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nkey questions are not specific to the use of new technologies but rather relate to teaching\nand learning in conventional settings. There is a contradiction in terms of the potential for\nC&IT to transform teaching, learning and assessment of student performance and the\nactual adoption of new technologies. The use of C&IT in teaching and learning has often\nbeen approached from a technological deterministic perspective which suggests that if\nC&IT is used, teaching, learning and assessment will be automatically enhanced and\nimproved due to the use of a technological medium (Thomas et al., 1998). While this\nconcept fits well with the pressure on universities to make efficiency gains through the use\nof new technologies, it can in fact lead to misguided, erratic and unsuccessful attempts to\nuse C&IT. As Ehrmann eloquently states, we may not be asking the right questions to\nfacilitate effective answers (Ehrmann, 1995).\nIn light of the inexorable drive to increase the level of C&IT usage in teaching and\nlearning, academics should consider the present time to be a period during which our\nnotions of course and curriculum design can be fully reviewed. While there has been much\nemphasis over the past decade on ensuring that transferable skills are an explicit com-\nponent of any discipline-based curriculum, the focus has tended to be on communication,\npresentation, numeracy, problem-solving and self-assessment skills (Anderson and\nMarshall, 1996). To enable the development of these higher-level skills using C&IT it could\nbe argued that supporting students in developing information literacy skills is now an\nessential element of the curriculum. Many UK universities are addressing this issue by\nintroducing information skills literacy training programmes which are increasingly\nbecoming a requirement for graduation (Martin, 1997). However, programmes focusing\nsolely on the development of IT skills ignore additional learning and information manage-\nment skills. Increasingly students will be required to make a cognitive transformation from\nmore traditional methods of learning to active learning managed around a personal\ncomputer. It is, therefore, essential that these skills are embedded into student support\nprogrammes in order to link the effective use of C&IT with pedagogical principles\n(Breivik, 1997).\nBridging the skills gap: staff development programme\nOur exploration of the 'skills gap' has enabled us to focus more effectively on the key issues\nin supporting academics in making effective use of the WWW for teaching and learning.\nThe Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative included a staff development programme\naiming to facilitate strategic change in the development and use of new technologies in\nteaching and learning at the University of Strathclyde. Our research into exploring the\n'skills gap' enabled us to take into consideration the anxieties and barriers to the use of\nnew technologies expressed by academics.\nProgramme structure\nA coherent programme was developed incorporating five short staff development courses\nincluding:\n1. Choosing the right technology.\n2. Web-based teaching.\n3. Electronic assessment.\n71\nAllison H. Uttlejohn and Lorraine Kj. Stefani Effective use of communication and information technology\n4. Internet communication.\n5. Electronic libraries.\nThese courses were designed around the premise that the technologies employed serve only as\na tool. The main emphasis is on the development of a strong pedagogical basis. Academics\ncan easily develop the technical skills necessary to build an educational website. However, our\nresearch has highlighted the recognition by academics that without grounding in sound\npedagogical practice these sites can be sterile and uninspiring learning environments.\nProgramme delivery\nAcademics are familiar with teaching in traditional settings, but how did we face the\nchallenge of enabling them to make the cognitive link between teaching in 'real' compared\nwith 'virtual' environments? The use of a Virtual University model provided a conceptual\nframework, enabling staff to compare the similarities and differences of a virtual learning\nenvironment with a conventional university campus. The Clyde Virtual University (CVU,\nhttp:\/\/cvu.strath.ac.uk) is a virtual learning environment integrating the main components\nof a traditional university: lecture theatre, library, assessment hall, virtual caf\u00e9 and\nadministration office. This model provided an excellent conceptual framework for\nacademics new to web-based teaching. It illustrates how all the components can be\nintegrated even more easily than by traditional means, creating a powerful integrated\nlearning environment. It also has an easy-to-use assessment engine and text-based chat\nfacilities, providing a platform for easy development of teaching materials. The aim is to\nrender the technology as transparent as possible, freeing academics to concentrate on their\nteaching and learning (Littlejohn and Sclater, 1998).\nAll courses involve the participation of between eight and twelve members of staff in a full\nday session. As far as possible staff members are placed in the role of students, for example\nwhen reviewing existing teaching materials, or while using new technologies to exchange\nideas enabling academics to reflect upon how their students would fare in a virtual\nteaching environment.\nChoosing the right technology\nThis course provides a brief overview of how technologies are currently used to enhance\nteaching and learning. Key issues articulated during our research are highlighted;\nincluding the selection of appropriate media and integration of a C&IT-based course into\nmainstream teaching. Internet communication tools, such as shared whiteboards and\nbulletin board discussions are demonstrated.\nWeb-based teaching\nOur research highlighted the development of an effective pedagogical strategy as an\nessential skill for academics. Therefore this skill is the main focus of the course on web-\nbased teaching. Case studies are presented and discussed, before participants are given the\nopportunity to critique an educational website within their own field. Afterwards a 'hands-\non' session is devoted to storyboarding and learning the practical skills required to create a\nshort course. These practical skills can be further developed in additional online courses.\nElectronic assessment\nSince learning goals are often driven by the assessment it is essential to ensure that an\nappropriate form of assessment is developed. Electronic assessment methods are still\n72\nALT-] Volume 7 Number 2\nsomewhat limited, but can be highly appropriate and useful if incorporated coherently into\nweb-based courses, where an overall assessment strategy will include summative and\nformative assessment and peer, self and tutor assessment. These issues are highlighted\nduring the workshop on electronic assessment. Examples of different electronic assessment\ntechniques are compared and discussed, providing a powerful insight into the effectiveness\nof various forms of electronic assessment. The afternoon session enables lecturers to\ndevelop and create their own simple Electronic Assessment using the Clyde Virtual\nUniversity Test Wizard. This tool enables staff to create web-based assessments without\nthe requirement of technical skills. By following a few simple steps web-based assessments\ncan be created in a matter of minutes, rendering the technology almost transparent,\nthereby enabling academics to focus their attention on writing assessment questions which\nreflect the learning goals.\nInternet communication\nThe importance of student dialogue via communication technologies was acknowledged\nby academics as a key component in the design of an effective course. This point is\nemphasized during the workshop on internet communication, which is run in collaboration\nwith the Glasgow Caledonian University. Participants discuss and debate the importance\nof dialogue using communication tools such as desktop videoconferencing, audio chat,\ntext conferencing, shared whiteboards and collaborative browsing. Ideas focused on case\nstudies are exchanged throughout the day and the session culminates in an inter-university\ndebate using ATM videoconferencing.\nElectronic libraries\nThe course on electronic libraries enables academics to develop the information\nmanagement and retrieval skills which they articulated as essential. The course explores\nlibrary and information services available over the WWW, including worldwide access to\nelectronic journals, library catalogues and databases, email-based library reference services,\ndocument delivery services and Internet search tools.\nDeveloping teaching and learning strategies in a technological\nenvironment\nThe staff development programme \u2022 described in this paper shows how research and\ndevelopment work with staff to determine the specific nature of the skills deficit has been\nused to develop a participant-friendly staff development programme. The goal was to\nencourage an emphasis on key issues such as curriculum redevelopment, promoting\ndialogue, the role of electronic assessment and the integration of technology-based courses\ninto mainstream teaching and learning.\nThe effectiveness of this programme will ultimately be measured by two factors: the\nnumbers of participants on this programme who subsequently use C&IT in their teaching\nand learning and the quality of the courses they develop. Presently about half the\nprogramme participants are actively involved in developing innovative teaching methods in\ntheir subject discipline. For example the Department of Forensic Science is developing an\nonline assessment of a virtual crime scene. Students are presented with an online crime\nscene and have a number of options for sample collection and analysis. The order in which\ndata are collected will ultimately affect the nature and quality of the results. Therefore\n73\nAllison H. IMejohn and Lorraine AJ. Stefani Effective use of communication and information technology\nstudents are required to analyse the information given and develop a strategy for sample\ncollection to attain successful results. The underlying pedagogical outcome is that students\nwill be better versed in how to proceed with analysis when faced with a real crime scene.\nIt is generally accepted now that these skills enhancement opportunities should be\nembedded within the curriculum rather than bolted on as optional extras. Creating\nopportunities for students to develop higher-order learning skills and to develop the\ninformation literacy skills essential to life-long learning may require more sophisticated\nchanges to course and curriculum development. However, it can still be argued that\nuniversity institutional structures do not encourage efforts to change and improve teaching\n(Albright and Graff, 1992). Primarily there appears to be a lack of vision of technology as\nan integral part of the curriculum, resulting in C&IT activities being bolted on to the\ncurriculum rather than thoughtfully included in ways which fully consider pedagogical\nparameters. Inevitably this trend has led to the perpetuation of traditional teaching systems\nthrough technology rather than to innovations in teaching and learning styles and methods.\nUniversity lecturers must take the main responsibility not only of what, but also for how\nour students learn. With some careful consideration and a willingness on the part of\nuniversity lecturers to change, computer-based technologies can be used to create an\nenvironment where students are helped to think constructively, critically and reflectively. If\nwe are serious in our goal of enabling students to become independent learners and\ninnovative critical thinkers it is essential to create a more student-centred curriculum and\nutilize teaching methods which encourage student participation, reflection and feedback.\nWe need to be more willing to create a learning culture in which the students themselves are\nactively engaged in the creation of knowledge which they share with their peers and their\nlecturers who in turn give feedback and critique to stimulate further thinking, exploring\nand learning. The lecturer in this scenario is no longer the centre of authority, rather s\/he is\na facilitator of active learning and plays an important role in providing feedback, cues for\nfurther enquiry and support for the development of a learning community. Achieving\nthose pedagogical aims requires several action points to be considered including more\nproblem-based learning within the curriculum; developing new partnerships across faculty\nand the university campus; and urging a more coherent institutional response regarding\nthe technology-based infrastructure of the university campus.\nAll of the above must be within the context of a supporting environment. For example, there\nmust be adequate provision for students and staff to access the virtual learning environment.\nThis is a difficult issue for the University, since it is expensive and resource-intensive. Finance\nmust be targeted effectively. Staff development courses provide a mechanism for discussion\nand channelling of ideas and requirements to the appropriate IT committees. It is also\nimportant to create a 'community of scholars' wishing to use C&IT to such an extent that\neventually there will come a point where a critical mass of university teachers have the skills\nto develop courses utilizing communication and information technology.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Niall Sclater and Shona Cameron of the Centre for\nEducational Systems for their contributions towards the staff development programme at\nthe University of Strathclyde.\n74\nALT-) Volume 7 Number 2\nReferences\nAlbright, M.
