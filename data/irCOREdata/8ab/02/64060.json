INTRODUCTION 1 \nBumblebees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of a large number of native plant 2 \nspecies and some crops (Corbet et al. 1991). Recent declines in their abundance in 3 \nEurope have been linked to habitat loss and alteration resulting from intensified 4 \nagriculture (Goulson et al. 2005). In particular, intensified crop management and 5 \nreductions in mixed farming have led to the loss, or botanical simplification, of both 6 \nsemi-natural habitats (e.g. flower-rich meadows) and linear habitats (e.g. species-rich 7 \nhedgerows and margins; Robinson & Sutherland 2002). This has led to a widespread 8 \ndecline in the quality and abundance of forage resources and nesting habitats for 9 \nbumblebees (Carvell et al. 2006).  10 \nReduced pollination services can have detrimental effects on the dynamics and 11 \npersistence of plant species and communities (Fontaine et al. 2006). Whilst diverse 12 \npollinator assemblages may be important to the maintenance of these services, 13 \nbumblebees may be able to compensate for the losses in other pollinator groups. This 14 \nmakes them key species in some agro-ecosystems (Kremen et al. 2002, Kremen et al. 15 \n2007). 16 \nThe European Union has recognized the need to counteract the negative 17 \neffects of modern agriculture on the environment, and has introduced agri-18 \nenvironment schemes whereby farmers are paid to manage their land for the benefit of 19 \nparticular habitats and species.  England has recently adopted the Environmental 20 \nStewardship scheme (www.defra.gov.uk\/erdp\/schemes\/es\/default.htm). This includes 21 \nspecific options targeted at pollinators, aiming to enhance the supply of pollen and 22 \nnectar sources by sowing flower mixtures at field margins. These mixtures can 23 \nsignificantly enhance the local density and diversity of foraging bumblebees on arable 24 \nland (Carvell et al. 2004), yet their effects have not been studied with respect to the 25 \narea of forage or landscape context in which they are provided. 26 \nLandscape context, especially the availability of semi-natural habitats, has 27 \nbeen recognized as important to bumblebees, and may interact with farming systems 28 \nto determine local community structure (Tscharntke et al. 2005). However, recent 29 \nwork questions the benefit of semi-natural habitat to bumblebee communities within 30 \nagricultural landscapes (Westphal et al. 2003; Kleijn et al. 2006). These studies have 31 \nconsidered neither the targeted agri-environment scheme options for pollinators being 32 \nimplemented in the UK nor the response of bumblebees to introduced forage 33 \nresources relative to resources elsewhere in the landscape. Here we investigate the 34 \n 4\nresponses of bumblebees to habitat creation in different agricultural landscapes. We 1 \ntest if sown forage patches have a positive effect on forager densities and if the effect 2 \nis influenced by landscape context.  3 \n 4 \n2. METHODS 5 \nWe selected eight sites across central and eastern England that represented 6 \ntypical land use for their locations but varied widely in landscape characteristics (table 7 \n1). We randomly allocated four treatments to each site: three forage patches of 0.25, 8 \n0.5 and 1ha sown with a mixture of 20% legumes (Trifolium pratense, Trifolium 9 \nhybridum, Lotus corniculatus) and 80% fine leaved grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa 10 \npratensis, Cynosurus cristatus) and a control patch representing typical non-crop 11 \nvegetation for the site. Loss of legumes is suggested as a major driver of declines of 12 \nlonger-tongued bumblebees (Goulson et al. 2005) so we expected that these 13 \nbumblebee species would be most attracted to the sown patches. Each patch was 14 \nseparated by approximately 3km (mean=2.99\u00b10.23km, SE) to reduce bumblebee 15 \ndispersal between them (Knight et al. 2005). Patches were established between 16 \nautumn 2003 and spring 2004.  17 \nA circular sampling zone around each treatment patch (n=32) was extended to 18 \na radius of 1km (314 ha) to reflect the scale at which the longer-tongued bumblebees 19 \nforage (Knight et al. 2005). Landscape characteristics for each zone were obtained 20 \nfrom the Land Cover Map 2000 (www.ceh.ac.uk\/data\/lcm), a computer-classified land 21 \ncover data set derived from satellite-based multi-spectral scanners. We used the 22 \nproportion of arable cropped fields as an indicator of landscape context because it was 23 \nnegatively correlated with the proportions of grassland, woodland (P<0.001) and 24 \nurban cover (P<0.05). 25 \nBumblebee activity was recorded monthly from May to September 2005 (five 26 \noccasions) when all patches were successfully established and flowering. Foraging 27 \nbumblebees were counted along two fixed 2m\u00d7100m transects in the centre of each 28 \ntreatment patch, and the plant species on which they were foraging were noted 29 \n(Banaszak 1980). In small or irregularly shaped patches we used U-shaped transects 30 \nto cover an equivalent area (e.g. four 50\u00d72m transects). All social Bombus species, 31 \ncuckoo bees (subgenus Psithyrus) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) were recorded. For 32 \nanalysis we grouped social Bombus species into colour groups (after Fussell & Corbet 33 \n 5\n1992, but with melanic Bombus ruderatus as a separate group), tongue length groups 1 \n(long >8.5mm, short <8.5mm) and diet breadth groups (defined using Simpson\u2019s 2 \ndiversity index, D, based on our flower visitation data; mean=3.8, narrow=D<3.8, 3 \nbroad=D>3.8) (table 2). Transects were carried out between 10.00 and 17.30 during 4 \ndry weather when ambient temperature was above 13\u00b0C with at least 60% clear sky, 5 \nor 17\u00b0C under any sky conditions.  6 \nForage availability on every visit was measured by identifying all flowering 7 \ndicotyledonous species and scoring their flower abundance in each 2\u00d710m transect 8 \nsection within the following ranges: 1-5; 6\u201325; 26-200; 201-1000; 1001-4999 and 9 \n5000+ flower units (defined as a single flower or an umbel, spike or capitulum on 10 \nmulti-flowered stems). For analysis, flower abundance was expressed as the median 11 \nvalue for each range, giving an estimate of the number of flowering units on each 12 \nsampling visit.  13 \nThe effects of patches on bee density were tested using a randomized block 14 \nANOVA on log transformed mean per transect (across all visits) with site and 15 \ntreatment as factors, and contrasts for effects of treatment type (control vs. sown) and 16 \npatch size. Differences in flower density (mean number of flowers per transect, per 17 \nsampling visit) between treatment patches across the landscape sectors were tested by 18 \nANOVA and contrasts. The relationship between bee density and % arable across 19 \nsites was compared between control and sown forage patches allowing for a random 20 \nsite effect using residual maximum likelihood (REML).  21 \n 22 \n3. RESULTS  23 \nWe observed 6602 bees including nine social bumblebee species and at least 24 \nthree cuckoo bee species. The most common species groups were: Bombus lapidarius 25 \n(+B. ruderarius) 45%, B. pascuorum (+B. muscorum\/humilis) 31%, B. terrestris agg. 26 \n(+B. lucorum) 8%, B. hortorum 8%, B. ruderatus 0.5% and B. pratorum 0.4%. 27 \nBumblebee density was significantly higher on the sown forage treatments 28 \nthan on the control patches (table 2) but  did not differ significantly with sown patch 29 \nsize for any species (table 2), suggesting that total bumblebee numbers increased in 30 \nproportion to patch area. Individual bumblebee species or groups showed variable 31 \nresponses to the sown patches. As expected, the strongest positive response was from 32 \nthe longer-tongued species (Goulson et al. 2005), with B. lapidarius and B. 33 \n 6\npascuorum, the most commonly recorded, 15-35 times more abundant on the sown 1 \nforage patches than control areas. Psithyrus spp. and A. mellifera did not show a 2 \nsignificant response to sown forage patches. The mean density of visited flowers 3 \n(defined as species that bumblebees visited at least once in the study) was 4 \nsignificantly higher on the sown forage patches than the control (F1,23=40.9, P<0.001) 5 \nbut did not differ significantly between sown forage patches (F2,14=1.01, P=0.39)  6 \nwithin or between sites (F7,14=1.2, P=0.37).  7 \n The effect of landscape context was highly significant in determining the 8 \nresponse of bumblebee density to forage patches but did not affect honeybee density 9 \nwhich declined in both forage patches and control areas with increasing proportion of 10 \narable land (table 3). In general, significantly more bumblebees per transect were 11 \nfound on forage patches in landscapes in which the proportion of arable land was 12 \nhighest. Importantly, the density of narrow diet and longer-tongued species on control 13 \npatches decreased with increasing proportion of arable land in the habitat surrounding 14 \nthe patches (figure 1). This suggests that non-crop habitats surrounding the patches 15 \nwere poorer for bumblebees as the proportion of arable land increased (e.g. control 16 \npatch log legume cover r=-0.72 P=0.043). There was no significant correlation 17 \nbetween honeybee and bumblebee abundance suggesting little or no competition for 18 \nforage resources (r=-0.296, P = 0.106). Finally, there was a strong positive correlation 19 \nbetween the mean estimated number of flowers of all bumblebee forage plant species 20 \nand the mean total number of bumblebees per patch (Total Bombus 21 \nspp.=0.61+0.0022\u00d7total forage flowers,  r=0.74, P<0.001).  22 \n 23 \n4. DISCUSSION 24 \n Our analyses suggest that the higher densities of foraging bumblebees 25 \nattracted to sown forage patches did not vary with patch size but did with landscape 26 \ncontext. If at the start of the experiment, patches were isolated (i.e. no shared 27 \nforagers), bumblebee colonies were randomly distributed within a landscape and bees 28 \nforaged only on patches, we would expect forager density to decline with increasing 29 \npatch size. Absence of this trend is consistent with several alternative explanations: a) 30 \nAn ideal free distribution; this would occur if patches were not truly isolated and 31 \nbumblebees traveled between them, but seems unlikely given the limited foraging 32 \nranges described for several species, e.g. B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius 449-450m 33 \n(Knight et al. 2005). b) Higher colony growth rates near larger patches (more total 34 \n 7\nforage) led to an increase in foragers visiting larger patches, offsetting expected 1 \ndecreases in density. c) Not all foragers within an area visited a patch, but larger 2 \npatches were encountered more often, thus the proportion of foragers visiting a patch 3 \nscales with its size.  4 \n In common with previous work we found higher numbers of bees on sown 5 \nforage patches in areas with high levels of agriculture. Westphal et al. (2003) 6 \nconcluded that the abundance of mass flowering crops (MFCs), rather than that of 7 \nsemi-natural habitats, was an effective determinant of bumblebee forager density on 8 \nflowering patches. In contrast, our data suggest that the response to introduced forage 9 \npatches was driven by a lack of forage resources in the surrounding habitats typified 10 \nby the control patches (MFCs had flowered earlier in all landscapes). Across our 11 \nlandscape gradient, increasing arable area led to a reduction in both the quantity and 12 \nquality of semi-natural forage resources for bumblebees. Thus sown patches were 13 \nrelatively more exploited where the availability of resources from semi-natural 14 \nhabitats was limited. The mobility of bumblebees means that they appear able to 15 \nreadily locate and exploit high quality forage patches, at least within the scale at 16 \nwhich we sampled.  17 \nAlthough the Bombus species assemblages differed across sites, many 18 \nbumblebees, especially the longer-tongued and narrow diet species, showed a positive 19 \nresponse to the sown mixture of legume species. Bumblebees often show strong 20 \npreferences for certain flowers or plant families (Heinrich 1976). The decline of our 21 \nsown legume species in the UK countryside may be a principal cause of rarity and 22 \ndecline in some bumblebees (Goulson et al. 2005). Our results suggest that restoring 23 \nforage resources through agri-environment schemes can enhance bumblebee densities 24 \nand attract large numbers of foraging bumblebees, especially in intensively managed 25 \nagricultural landscapes. Whilst our results focus on densities of individuals, it is 26 \nimportant to realise that this may not reflect impacts on populations per se. This 27 \nrequires more direct measurements of either colony density or colony performance, 28 \nand these form the basis of ongoing work. 29 \n 30 \nAcknowledgements 31 \nWe thank W.
