Introduction \nCurrently, the most intractable problem with ceramic tiled surfaces is that contaminants can enter \ninto, and exit a space via the grout used to fill the void between adjoining ceramic tiles. This problem \nis further compounded by the fact that the wear characteristics of commercially available epoxy tile \ngrouts are poor. Consequently, routine cleaning of the tiled surface with detergents and other cleaning \nagents brings about a significant reduction in the life of the epoxy tile grout. What is more, because \ncommercially available epoxy tile grouts are very difficult to clean and wear easily as a result of \ncleaning, they become contaminated over time and have to be removed physically or mechanically, \nboth of which are arduous and costly undertakings. \nTo counter these problems inherent to commercially available epoxy tile grout, a new approach was \ncreated by Lawrence and Li [1, 2]. This new approach was not only comprised of the development of \na new grout material termed the amalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG), but also a new \ngrouting technique whereby a high power diode laser (HPDL) was used to glaze an enamel coating on \nthe surface of the AOCG, thus resulting in a two-stage sealing process. This technique has been \ndeveloped further by Lawrence et al. [3], resulting in the development of a single-stage sealing \nprocess using the HPDL. The new grouting material used crushed vitrified ceramic tiles as a bulk \nfiller with an enamel frit placed directly on top. In this way a single-stage process could be achieved \nas theoretically the materials could be applied in a single action and only one pass of the HPDL \nwould be required. The seals generated between adjoining vitrified ceramic tiles with the single-stage \ngrout were found to be tough and inexpensive, as well as providing an amorphous, crack-free surface \nglaze. In this way the tiles were sealed together permanently, preventing any further contamination \nactivity; in effect creating a completely sealed surface that is both impermeable and relatively simple \nto clean and maintain since contaminants are basically arrested on the surface of the tile and the \nglazed seal. Because such a seal would be an integral a part of the surface as the tiles themselves, the \nnecessity to remove old or contaminated grout from the void between the tiles would be eliminated. \nThe current literature abounds with reports on the surface treatment of metals using lasers for the \npurposes of enhancing wear characteristics. A number of workers have successfully demonstrated \nthat the laser cladding of strategic metals can bring about improvements in the wear behaviour [4-6]. \nIn the same way, laser surface alloying (LSA) [7, 8] and laser surface melting (LSM) [9] have been \n 4 \nfound to be workable techniques for increasing the wear resistance of metals. Naturally, much \nresearch has revealed that laser surface hardening (LSH) [10-13] effects considerable increases in the \nwear resistance of metals. Pantelis et al. [14] have investigated the novel technique of laser surface \ntexturing. Using a high power pulsed CO2 laser, the surface of grey cast iron was textured to produce \nan anti-galling surface, yielding a marked increase in the wear resistance of the iron.  \nThe direct surface treatment [15-20] and coating [21-24] of engineering ceramic and composite \nmaterials with established industrial lasers is a field of ongoing research. What is more, work \nconducted by Yang et al. [25] to study the effect of LSM on the wear characteristics of Al2O3\/TiO2-\nbased ceramic coatings revealed that the wear characteristics of the ceramic were much improved \nafter laser treatment. Such improvements were attributed to laser-induced densification of the ceramic \nmaterials and the subsequent increase in the hardness. Even so, little work has been conducted using \nthe more contemporary HPDL. But in a series of comprehensive studies, Lawrence et al. have \ninvestigated the potential of the HPDL for the modification of the surface properties of engineering \nceramics [26-28], composites [29, 30] and the coating of composites [31]. Likewise, there are very \nfew reports on the efficacy of the HPDL to enhance the wear characteristics of engineering ceramic \nand composites. However, work carried out by Lawrence and Li [32] demonstrated that the HPDL \ntreatment of the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete effected considerable increases \nin the wear resistance of the OPC in both normal and corrosive environments. \nThis study aims to establish the wear characteristics of a HPDL generated single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout and compare them with those of a commercially available epoxy tile grout. This is of particular \ninterest since the inherent compactness of the HPDL enables it to be portable. Other industrial lasers \nonly allow the workpiece to be processed at a dedicated laser work station, whereas on the other \nhand, the HPDL can be used for on-site processing.  \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Laser processing procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810 nm \u00b120 nm and \noperating in the continuous wave (CW) mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The \nHPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical \n 5 \nfibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-\naxis computerised numerical control (CNC) gantry table (see Fig. 1). The single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout was irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam within the optimum HPDL \noperating parameters established previously [3]. Hence a beam spot diameter of 1.75 mm, a laser \npower (measured at the workpiece after fibre and optics losses using a Power Wizard power meter) of \n35 W and a traverse speed of 600 mm\/min were used. Fig. 1 illustrates schematically the laser \nprocessing experimental arrangement, whereby the defocused HPDL beam was fired along the \nvitrifiable enamel frit placed in the void between adjoining vitrified ceramic tiles by traversing the \nsamples beneath the HPDL beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table. In order to protect \nthe laser optics, 3 l\/min of coaxially blown O2 assist gas was used, whilst the fumes produced were \nremoved with an extraction system. \nThe experiments were carried out using UK standard 150 x 150 x 5 mm\n3\n vitrified ceramic wall tiles \nof various colours: white; navy blue; leaf green and jet black, cut into smaller pieces, 20 x 20 mm\n2\n, \nfor experimental purposes and applied in pairs to an OPC substrate using standard epoxy tile grout \n(Vallance Ltd). The spacing between the vitrified edges of each tile pair was the industry \nrecommended 1.5 mm. The fixed ceramic tile pieces were then allowed to set for the standard setting \ntime of one day. For the experiments investigating the wear characteristics of the epoxy tile grout, the \ngrout was applied into the void, proud of the surface of the tiles by approximately 500 \u00b5m. The grout \nwas then allowed to cure for 8 h. For the experiments investigating the wear characteristics of the \nHPDL generated single-stage ceramic tile grout, vitrified ceramic tiles were crushed and fine ground \nusing a pestle and mortar and then sieved to ensure a particle size of less than 45 \u00b5m. So as to form a \nmanageable paste, the vitrified ceramic tile powder was mixed with approximately 50wt% water \ndiluted sodium silicate solution. The vitrified ceramic tile paste was then placed into the void, proud \nof the surface of the tiles by approximately 500 \u00b5m and allowed to cure for 8 h. The set mixture was \nthen overlaid directly with a thin layer (500 \u00b5m) of enamel frit (Ferro Group (UK), Ltd.) which, in \norder to form a manageable paste, was mixed with 20wt% white spirit. The composition of the \nenamel consisted mainly of the following: SiO2; B2O3; Na2O; Mn and small quantities of Ba; Al2O3 \nand Ni, whilst the powder size was 25 \u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was allowed to cure for 1 h and then \n 6 \nirradiated immediately with the defocused HPDL beam. The enamel frit was chosen on account of the \nfact that it has been shown previously to have a high propensity for laser firing [1-3]. \nTo determine the characteristics of the glaze generated on the surface of the single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout seals, the samples were examined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy \n(SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. \n2.3 Wear testing procedure \nTo determine the wear resistance characteristics of both the epoxy tile grout and the HPDL generated \nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal, wear tests were conducted in accordance with Fig. 3. All the \nsamples were weighed and then clamped individually in the vice of a common shaping machine. A \nsteel abrader was attached to the floating head of the shaping machine and moved cyclically back and \nforth across the surfaces of the grout seals. The total distance moved in one cycle was 6 mm while the \ntraverse speed was 180 mm\/min. By applying weights to the floating head a frictional force of 60 N \nwas generated. The samples were subjected to the frictional force for 8 h, being removed from the \nmachine and weighed at 2 h intervals. The wear tests were repeated twice so as to give more reliable \nresults. The standard deviation due to experimental error, etc. was calculated as being \u00b115 mg. \n3. Results \n3.1 Wear characteristics in normal environmental conditions \nIn most instances, the wear resistance of any material is principally related to the hardness of the \nmaterial in comparison with that of any other material with which it subsequently comes into contact \n[33]. As such, with the compositional components of the enamel frit employed (mainly SiO2, B2O3, \nNa2O and Mn) being naturally much harder than those of the epoxy tile grout (mainly CaCO3 and \ndolomite), then one would expect the glazed enamel surface of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal \nto provide the seal with greater wear resistance than the epoxy tile grout alone. Yet wear resistance is \nnot directly proportional to hardness, nor does it always increase with hardness [34]. Fig. 4 shows the \nrelationship between weight loss and the friction time for the HPDL generated enamel glaze and the \nepoxy tile grout. As is clearly evident from Fig. 4, the HPDL generated enamel glaze possesses a \n 7 \nmuch greater wear resistance than the epoxy tile grout, with the weight loss being 9 times lower than \nfor the epoxy tile grout after 4 h, and 14 times lower after 8 h. \n3.2 The effect of corrosive environments on the wear characteristics \nTiled surfaces are almost always subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal \nservice environment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Consequently, corrosion resistance tests \nbased upon EN ISO 10545 [35] were conducted using nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \nand a detergent cleaner (MP9, Premier Products). The experiments were carried out by placing small \namounts of the corrosive agents in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10%, on to \nthe surfaces of the HPDL generated enamel glaze and the epoxy tile grout at hourly intervals for 4 h. \nThe samples were then examined optically and mechanically tested in terms of compressive strength \nand wear. High concentrations of the various corrosive agents were used primarily to accelerate the \ntests. Indeed, in practice nitric acid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for \nnuclear fuels in only 60% concentration [36], whilst within the food processing and brewing \nindustries, tiled surfaces are washed repeatedly, many times a day with detergent cleaners [37]. \nAll three reagents in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nepoxy tile grout surface. In particular, the HNO3 and the NaOH attacked the epoxy tile grout surface \nwith a much greater severity than the detergent, causing marked discoloration and heavy pitting after \nonly 1 h, as Fig. 5 shows. In contrast, the surface of the HPDL generated enamel glaze displayed no \ndiscernible changes in either morphology or microstructure. Furthermore, no signs of devitrification \ndue to corrosion were discernible.  \nTests conducted in accordance with ASTM C579-91 [38] revealed that exposure of the epoxy tile \ngrout surface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear \nresistance. From Fig. 6 it can be seen that exposure of the epoxy grout to HNO3 and NaOH in the \nconcentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 35-71%. \nIn the case of the detergent a significant loss in compressive strength only occurred with \nconcentrations above 40%. In this instance the average loss in compressive strength for \nconcentrations in the range 60-80% was approximately 15-30%. This compares sharply with no \ndiscernible difference in either the wear resistance or the compressive strength of the HPDL \ngenerated enamel glaze. \n 8 \nFig. 7 shows the variation in wear resistance of the epoxy tile grout when exposed to the reagents \nwith 80% concentration. As one can see, the wear resistance is significantly affected, particularly \nthrough interaction with the NaOH and the HNO3, which yielded similar results. Here the weight loss \nwas approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed epoxy tile grout after 4 h, 45 mg\/cm\n2\n and \n294 mg\/cm\n2\n (HNO3), and approximately 10 times higher after 8 h, 97 mg\/cm\n2\n and 986 mg\/cm\n2\n \n(HNO3). In the case of the detergent, the weight loss was twice as high as that recorded for the \nunexposed epoxy tile grout after 4 h, 45 mg\/cm\n2\n and 102 mg\/cm\n2\n respectively, and 4 times higher \nafter 8 h, 97 mg\/cm\n2\n and 415 mg\/cm\n2\n respectively. \n4. Discussion \nIt is abundantly clear from the results of the wear tests that the HPDL generated enamel glaze \npossesses far superior wear resistance characteristics than the epoxy tile grout. This superiority in \nwear characteristics was especially evident when the tests were conducted in corrosive environments. \nThe marked difference in wear rate between the HPDL generated enamel glaze and the epoxy tile \ngrout, in both normal and corrosive environments, can be attributed entirely to the difference in the \nstructure and phase of the two materials. Whereas the HPDL generated enamel glaze is fully \namorphous in nature (see Fig. 8(a)), the epoxy tile grout is comprised of a porous polycrystalline \nstructure (see Fig. 8(b)). Furthermore, the HPDL induced vitrification of the enamel has inherently \ncreated a surface that is much more dense and consolidated than the epoxy tile grout. In addition, the \nHPDL generated enamel glaze is considerably harder than the epoxy tile grout, with a respective \nvalue of 6 compared to 2 on the Mohs scale. Consequently, these two differences in the nature of the \nHPDL generated enamel glaze will in turn afford the HPDL generated enamel glaze wear \ncharacteristics that exceed those of the epoxy tile grout. Moreover, owing to the amorphous nature of \nthe HPDL generated enamel glaze, the glaze will naturally possess a greater resistance to corrosive \nreagents than the polycrystalline structure of the epoxy tile grout which is readily attacked by acids \nand alkalis [39]. Indeed, from a microscopic examination of the HPDL generated enamel glaze, no \nsigns of devitrification due to corrosion were discernible. \nIt is interesting to note that the weight loss experienced by the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal \nduring the wear tests increased linearly, as opposed to rising increasingly with time. From this \n 9 \nobservation it is possible to make two assertions. Firstly, such a finding implies that the surface of the \nHPDL generated enamel glaze is without protrusions that are naturally more susceptible to wear [32]. \nIndeed, the average surface roughness (Ra) of the HPDL generated enamel glaze was recorded as     \n0.12 \u00b5m. This compares with an average surface roughness value of 3.83 \u00b5m for the epoxy tile grout. \nSecondly, it is reasonable to maintain that the HPDL generated enamel glaze does not have an upper \nlayer that possesses superior wear characteristics over the bulk of the glaze. That is, throughout the \n500 \u00b5m section of the HPDL generated glaze the wear characteristics are somewhat consistent.  \nThe generally superior mechanical and chemical performance of the HPDL generated enamel glaze \nover the epoxy tile grout suggests that the life characteristics of the enamel glazes may also be \nsuperior to those of the epoxy tile grout. Yet in any analysis of the wear life of these two materials, \nthe in-situ relative thickness of the HPDL generated enamel glaze and the epoxy tile grout must be \nconsidered in order to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics. This is particularly \ntrue when considering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). \nConsequently, the increase in wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nHPDL generated enamel glaze wear life\nEpoxy tile grout wear life\n (1) \nwhere, Wear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg \/ m .cm)\nWear rate (mg \/ cm \/ h)\n3\n2    (1a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the HPDL generated enamel \nglaze over the epoxy tile grout. As is clearly apparent from Table 1, the HPDL generated enamel \nglaze effected an increase in actual life over the epoxy tile grout regardless of the environment. What \nis more, it can be seen that the increase in actual life of the HPDL generated enamel glaze over the \nepoxy tile grout varies considerably depending upon the working environment. However, arguably \nthe most common working environment for a tiled surface would involve some contact with at least \ndetergents, therefore yielding significant economic benefits since a HPDL sealed tiled surface lasts \naround 17.5-times longer than one which is sealed in the conventional way with epoxy tile grout. \n \n 10 \n5. Conclusions \nThe wear characteristics of a single-stage ceramic tile grout, generated using a 60 W high power \ndiode laser (HPDL), in comparison to those of a commercially available tile grout have been \ndetermined. Within both normal and corrosive (detergent, HNO3 and NaOH) environmental \nconditions the wear rate of the single-stage ceramic tile grout was found to be 0.9 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h. In \ncontrast, the wear rate of the epoxy tile grout after 8 h was 12 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h in normal environmental \nconditions and 52, 92 and 125 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h when exposed to detergent, NaOH and HNO3 respectively. \nLife assessment testing revealed that the HPDL generated enamel glaze gave an increase in wear life \nof 4 to 42 times over epoxy tile grout, depending upon the corrosive environment. It is believed that \nthe economic and material benefits to be gained from the deployment of such an effective and \nefficient means of sealing ceramic tiles could be significant. \nThe reasons for these marked improvements in the wear resistance and wear life of the HPDL \ngenerated enamel glaze over the epoxy tile grout can be attributed to firstly, the vitrified nature of the \nHPDL generated enamel glaze which subsequently yields a much more dense and consolidated \nsurface in comparison with the epoxy tile grout, and secondly, the fact that the HPDL generated \nenamel glaze possesses microstructural and phase characteristics that are inherently more resistant to \ncorrosive reagents than the epoxy tile grout. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/M46068) for their financial support of this work.
