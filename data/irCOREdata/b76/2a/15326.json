Within \nleadership research, behaviour of leaders and managers is usually considered as the independent \nvariable whilst followers\u201f reactions are considered the dependent variable. In this study, we reverse this \norder and investigate the degree to which the evaluation of leadership is a result of followers\u201f \nperceptions and attributions. In order to corroborate and extend previous experimental research, a field \nstudy was conducted to analyse the influence of followers\u201f personality and perceived leader personality \non followers\u201f perception of leadership within an organisational setting. The results provide further \nevidence that followers\u201f personality influences the perception of transformational leadership and \ncommitment to the supervisor. Moreover, the perception of leaders\u201f personality was related to the \nperception of leadership and commitment to the supervisor. The finding that the perception of \nsupervisors\u201f personality mediates both the relationship between followers\u201f personality and the \nperception of leadership and commitment provides support for the similarity hypothesis. Results are \ndiscussed in the light of feedback and leader development. \nKeywords: transformational leadership, followers\u201f personality, perception of leadership, \nsimilarity \nPersonality and leadership \n3 \nIntroduction \nMost research in the field of leadership has focused on leaders\u201f behaviour and its effectiveness \nwith regard to different outcome criteria and, therefore, can be labelled as leader-centric. In the last \ndecade, starting with Hollander\u201fs seminal work (Hollander, 1992a and b), however, research with a \nfollower-centred perspective that emphasizes the role of the followers in an interactive, dyadic \nleadership process has received increased attention (e.g., Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; Densten, 2005; \nFelfe & Schyns, 2006; Gardner & Avolio, 1998; Lord & Maher, 1993; Meindl, 1995; Nye, 2002, 2005; \nSchyns & Felfe, 2006; van Dick, Hirst, Grojean, & Wiseke, 2007). This line of research has provided \nevidence that the chance to emerge as and remain an effective leader does not depend solely on the \nleaders\u201f own behaviour but also on followers\u201f information-processing (Lord & Emrich, 2000). Such an \napproach posits that the evaluation and acceptance of a leader in a specific situation is determined by \nfollowers\u201f mind-sets which consist of assumptions, beliefs, and expectations regarding the causes, \nnature, and the consequences of leadership, or, in other words, their implicit leadership theories (ILTs) \n(Eden & Leviatan, 1975, 2005). Similarly, from a Social Identity Theory background, researchers argue \nthat the emergence of a leader is based on the leader fitting a prototype (\u201cprototypicality\u201d) for the \ncharacteristics of a group within a specific situation (Haslam & Platow, 2001). \nIn this study, we concentrate on the concept of charismatic or transformational leadership for the \nfollowing reasons. In the last decades, transformational leadership has emerged as one of the most \nimportant leadership concepts and there is still a growing interest in the functioning of this kind of \nleadership style. Therefore we consider transformational leadership an obvious starting point for this \nstudy. Moreover, Max Weber already postulated in 1922 that the perception of followers is an essential \nprecondition for the emergence and existence of charisma. Much recent research on charisma focuses \non the concept of transformational leadership which was introduced by Bass (1985) as the behavioural \nmanifestation of charismatic leadership, emphasizing the role of followers\u201f perceptions and attributions \nPersonality and leadership \n4 \nregarding this leadership style. While these arguments led us to choose the perception of \ntransformational leadership as the dependent variable in our study, the arguments made on the basis of \ndifferent theoretical backgrounds are equally valid for other leadership styles. That it so say that not \nonly the perception of transformational leadership is influenced by follower characteristics but also the \nperception of other leadership styles. \nKlein and House (1995, 1998) used the metaphor of a fire to illustrate the interactive emergence \nof charismatic leadership. Here the leader serves as a spark and the follower is a flammable material. \nOxygen stands for an appropriate environment. Metaphorically speaking, the emergence of leadership \ndoes not depend solely on the leader to light a fire. It also needs followers who perceive the respective \nleader as trustworthy, charismatic or transformational. Followers must be willing to allow the leader to \nbe influential. Although most authors would strongly agree that charismatic or transformational \nleadership is at least an interactive phenomenon that depends on the leader and the follower (Gardner & \nAvolio, 1998; Shamir, House & Arthur, 1993), most research in this field has concentrated on leaders\u201f \nbehaviour.  \nHowever, it is of practical importance to better understand followers\u201f information processing \nwhen evaluating leaders and managers because leadership behaviour is usually assessed by followers\u201f \nratings. As a lot of appraisal and training of leaders is based on follower rating, it is vital for \norganisations to know what they are actually assessing when asking followers to indicate their leaders\u201f \nbehaviour. Assessing leaders\u201f behaviour using follower ratings implies that all followers perceive the \nsame (i.e., the leader\u201fs behaviour) and are able to give an accurate record of their leaders\u201f behaviour. \nHowever, followers\u201f perception, and also the acceptance of transformational leadership, is not only \ndetermined by the actual behaviour of a leader but also by followers\u201f characteristics. Consequently, the \nquestion must be raised to what extent followers\u201f ratings are biased and what kind of follower \nperceives a leader as transformational (Howell & Frost, 1989). Additionally, it is at least questionable \nPersonality and leadership \n5 \nwhether all followers accept transformational leadership in the same way. Recent research provides \nevidence that followers\u201f characteristics, and specifically similarity between leader and follower, \ninfluence the perception and acceptance of charismatic and transformational leadership (Felfe & \nSchyns, 2006; Keller, 1999). Prior experimental research, however, has not directly tested perceived \nsimilarity but has only assumed this mechanism to explain the relationship between followers\u201f \npersonality and their perception of transformational leadership. This study will address this issue and \nwill examine the relationship between followers\u201f personality and their perception of the leader\u201fs \npersonality and their joint effect on the perception and acceptance of transformational leadership within \nan organisational context. \n  \nTheoretical background and prior research \nBefore providing details of our study, a summary of prior theory and research in the area of \nperception and acceptance of transformational leadership will be provided. Some prior research has \ntaken Klein and House\u201fs (1995) three contradicting assumptions concerning the relationship between \ntransformational leaders and their subordinates\u201f characteristics, namely, completion, similarity and \nindependence as a starting point. They addressed the question what types of followers are susceptible to \ntransformational leadership. We will briefly explain their argument why similarity is relevant in the \ncontext of the perception of leadership. In addition, we will refer to Social Identity Theory (SIT) as \nwell as social projection as potential explanations for our assumptions. \n \nSimilarity: Shamir et al. (1993) emphasize that subordinates\u201f characteristics such as self-efficacy \nand value congruence as well as similarity to the leader are important preconditions for the attribution \nof transformational leadership. In contrast, people with low self-efficacy might feel over-stretched as \ntransformational leaders set high standards. If followers\u201f norms and values are different from those of \nPersonality and leadership \n6 \ntheir leader, they do not perceive him\/her as a role model nor do they experience pride on behalf of \ntheir leader. Consequently, the same transformational behaviour of a leader may be evaluated as more \nor less transformational depending on the followers\u201f characteristics. Of course, leaders who do not \ndisplay transformational behaviours at all will not be perceived as transformational, even if followers \nperceive similarity with regard to personality (e.g., leader and follower share low self-efficacy). That \nmeans that similarity only has influence on the perception of transformational leadership when \nfollowers rate leaders as similar to themselves with respect to characteristics conducive to \ntransformational leadership.  \nKeller (1999) offers two theoretical explanations as to why similar leaders are preferred: (a) \nresearch on similarity and attraction suggests that similar persons are favoured and (b) positive self-\nillusions can be projected onto people who are similar to one\u201fs self. Moreover, from a cognitive \nperspective, similarity confirms one\u201fs own attitudes, reduces dissonances, and stabilizes one\u201fs own \nself-concept (Shamir et al., 1993). Numerous studies exist that indirectly support the assumption of \nsimilarity. Although these studies refer to similarity, all of them focus on characteristics conducive to \ntransformational leadership but do not address any other kind of similarity. For example, followers\u201f \nachievement orientation and high self-esteem have been found to be positively related to the preference \nfor a charismatic leader (Ehrhart & Klein, 2001). Keller\u201fs (1999) results indicate that followers\u201f \nextraversion is related to the preference for charismatic leaders. She even concluded that \u201cthe ideal \nleader was construed as similar to self\u201c (p. 600). In an experimental study supporting Keller\u201fs findings, \nFelfe and Schyns (2006) showed that extraversion in particular is positively related to the perception \nand acceptance of transformational leadership. In subsequent studies, Schyns and Sanders (2007) and \nSchyns and Felfe (2006) found that followers\u201f agreeableness also influenced the perception of \nleadership. It is important to note that all the characteristics addressed in the studies mentioned above \nare supposed to be typical of transformational leaders (Bono & Judge, 2004).  \nPersonality and leadership \n7 \n \nSocial identity: In line with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986), the perception of \ncommunalities should enhance the identification with the leader. A positive evaluation of the leader \nalso helps to develop a positive social identity which improves one\u201fs own self-concept. SIT gives \nattention to group-relevant characteristics (e.g., Duck & Fielding, 2003; Giessner & van Knippenberg, \n2008; Haslam & Platow, 2001), in our case personality variables that group members share. In order to \nhave an effect, the personality variable in question must be salient and relevant in an organisational \ncontext, for example, extraversion in a sales-oriented context or conscientiousness in accounting or \nadministration departments. Indeed, Schyns and Sanders (2007) found that when using different \nsamples to examine the effect of followers\u201f personality on the perception of transformational \nleadership, different personality traits proved relevant. The traits were exactly those that one would \nexpect to be prominent in the respective context. This is line with Turner\u201fs (2005) argument that group \nidentity is a precondition for leaders to gain power through persuasion, authority or coercion. Turner\u201fs \nargument is based on the self-categorisation theory which implies that people who share a common \ngroup identity expect to agree with each other in the interpretation of a given situation. Uncertainty \narises when members of the same group, although they share a common identity, disagree. This is \nwhere power is granted to the leader and can be exerted to solve this disagreement. To put it in \nTurner\u201fs own words: \u201cLeaders gain power not by possessing resources in the abstract but by standing \nfor, representing, believing, working for something, or being perceived to do so, with which at least \nsome others concur\u201d (p. 20). \nSimilarly to this view, Giessner and van Knippenberg (2008) point out that those leaders who are \nperceived as prototypical for the group receive more favourable attributions in case of failure and thus \nwill probably be granted more \u201cfollowership\u201d. Duck and Fielding (2003) showed that the appraisal of a \nleader\u201fs fairness depends on social identity concerns, namely the categorization as in-group or out-\nPersonality and leadership \n8 \ngroup leader. Irrespective of their behaviour, in-group leaders were evaluated more positively, whereas \nout-group leaders who favoured their own group were judged most critical. According to the Social \nIdentity Theory (SIT), other personality characteristics (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, and ambiguity \ntolerance), values and implicit theories, or competences may be relevant in a specific situation or \ncontext. SIT also suggests that the set of relevant characteristics may not be restricted to personality in \nterms of static dispositions, but that similarity in general enhances the acceptance of a leader. However, \none problem with arguing on the basis of SIT is that prototypicality does not necessarily mean that \nleaders are perceived as similar and as possessing characteristics conducive to transformational \nleadership. This, however, is a precondition for the effect assumed in the similarity hypothesis outlined \nabove. \nAs we concentrate here on the followers\u201f perception of leaders\u201f personality rather than on \nindependent or objective personality measures, we cannot rule out that leaders engage in impression \nmanagement or act as \u201centrepreneurs of identity\u201d (Reicher, Haslam & Hopkins, 2005) in order to \nconvince followers that they are prototypical for the group they lead. Whether leaders are (1) actually \nsimilar to their followers, (2) only similar in a specific situation, or (3) just \u201cpretend\u201d to be similar to \nthem, does not matter as the critical point is whether followers feel the leader to be \u201eone of us\u201f (e.g., \nHaslam & Platow, 2001). \n \nSocial projection: Prior research (Schyns & Sanders, 2007) has argued that the effect of \npersonality on the perception of transformational leadership in experimental studies can be explained \nby assumed similarity (Cronbach, 1955; Watson, Hubbard & Wiese, 2000). When little is known about \nthe leader who is to be rated, for example, in experimental studies, participants project their own traits \ninto the person they are rating. Keller (1999) used a similar approach when explaining the effects of \npersonality on images of ideal leaders, stating that persons do not only prefer others that are similar to \nPersonality and leadership \n9 \nthemselves but also \u201cproject their own traits onto idealized leadership images\u201d (p. 591). Both these \nexplanations that have been used in prior research are comparable to social projection on a more \ngeneral level (for overviews see Krueger, 1998; Krueger, 2007). According to Krueger (2007, p. 1): \n\u201cPeople by and large expect that others are similar to themselves\u201d. This seems to be especially the case \nfor in-group members (Clement & Krueger, 2002; Robins & Krueger, 2005). Murray, Holmes and \nGriffin (1996) found that in close relationships, persons rate their partners on the basis of their self-\nimages rather than the actual characteristics of their partners. In addition, they idealised their partners \nwhich in turn predicted relationship satisfaction. Transferring this to the leadership area, we can assume \nthat followers tend to project their own characteristics onto their leaders and are more satisfied when \nthey perceive themselves to be similar to their leaders. Thus, followers perceive more transformational \nleadership and are more committed to their leaders when they posses personality traits that are \ncharacteristic for transformational leaders. \n \nTo sum up, there are strong arguments that support the assumption that followers similar to \ntransformational leaders engage in transformational relationships. This may be either because of actual \nsimilarity with respect to personality characteristics conducive to transformational leadership, because \nof leader prototypicality (albeit only if characteristics conducive to transformational leadership are \nprevalent) or because of a projection of characteristics conducive to transformational leadership. While \nin this study we concentrate on transformational leadership, one could argue that similarity in terms of \nleader typical characteristics leads to the perception of leader-typical attributes in general and enhances \nthe acceptance of leaders that fit the leader prototype. As mentioned above, we decided to focus on \ntransformational leadership for two reasons: firstly transformational leadership has been in the focus of \nprior research in the area of perception of leadership, and secondly a current debate in literature \nexamines whether the nature of the transformational relationship can be characterized by similarity or \nPersonality and leadership \n10 \ncompletion. Prior research in this area has concentrated on personality and transformational leadership \nbut the argument proposed here can be easily transferred to other leader-typical attributes that may be \nof relevance in a specific situation or context.  \n \nAcceptance of transformational leadership: Commitment to the supervisor \nIn contrast to experimental research, followers in the present study share real work experience \nwith their leaders, and thus, commitment to the supervisor can be employed as a differentiated and \ntheoretically grounded measurement for acceptance of the leader. Commitment to the supervisor \nreflects on the quality of the psychological bond between follower and leader (Cheng, Jiang & Riley, \n2003; Clugston, Howell & Dorfman, 2000; Felfe, Schmook & Six, 2006; Stinglhamber, Bentein, & \nVandenberghe, 2002). High affective commitment to the supervisor indicates that followers want to \nmaintain cooperation with their leader because they appreciate the relationship with their leader. \nContinuance commitment to the supervisor, on the other hand, occurs if there are low alternatives or a \nchange will cause too many costs. Normative commitment means that followers stay with their \nsupervisor for reasons of obligation. They would feel guilty if they did not meet others\u201f expectations or \nunwritten rules in the organisation. \nThus, in a field context, commitment to the supervisor (Clugston et al., 2000; Felfe et al., 2006; \nStinglhamber et al., 2002) is considered a valid and relevant criterion for the acceptance of a leader. It \nis a well known concept within the body of commitment literature and has been found to be an \nimportant predictor for turnover intention and organisational citizenship behaviour (Stinglhamber et al., \n2002). By linking followers\u201f personality to supervisor commitment in a real organisational setting, the \nimpact of the potential findings goes far beyond previous research as they contribute to the explanation \nof determinants for organisational effectiveness and success. \nPersonality and leadership \n11 \nWe assume that the relationship between follower characteristics and the perception of leader \ncharacteristics influence commitment to the supervisor. The extent to which followers perceive that \nthey share characteristics conducive to transformational leadership with their leader will enhance \nmutual understanding and reinforcement, ultimately leading to higher commitment to an actual leader. \nResearch into Social Identity Theory hints in the same direction: Ellemers and colleagues (e.g., \nEllemers, Spears & Doosje, 2002) argue that identity and commitment are closely related in many \norganisational contexts. Thus, we can assume that similarity in characteristics conducive to \ntransformational leadership, through fostering a shared social identity, influences the relationship \nbetween follower and supervisor by enhancing the identification with the supervisor. Consequently, we \npropose that followers who perceive themselves to be similar to their leaders in terms of characteristics \nthat are typical of transformational leaders develop higher affective commitment to their supervisor. \nThey appreciate the cooperation to their supervisor, tend to develop an affective relationship and search \nto maintain it. In contrast, followers who are dissimilar to the characteristics of transformational leader, \ntend to build relationships that are based on reciprocity or dependency, and on the calculation of the \ngains, costs and risks. In these cases, followers stay with their leader either because they have no \nalternative or because they consider leaving their supervisor as too costly. Consequently, the \nrelationship is based on continuance commitment. Therefore, we conclude that feeling similar to a \ntransformational leader in terms of personality leads to affective commitment whereas perceived \ndissimilarity leads to continuance or calculative commitment to the supervisor.  \n \nResearch model and hypotheses \nIn contrast to prior experimental research (Felfe & Schyns, 2006), but similar to Schyns and \nSanders (2007), we conducted a field study allowing for direct face-to-face interaction and long-term \nexperience with the leader. Our research model is displayed in Figure 1. The most important point \nPersonality and leadership \n12 \naddressed by the study presented here is the following one: Although the effect of similarity served as \nan explanatory frame in both of the aforementioned studies, similarity has not been empirically tested. \nInstead the relationship between leader personality and transformational leadership, symbolized by \narrow (\u201c2\u201d) in our research model (see Figure 1), was based on findings of other studies (Bono & \nJudge, 2004; Crant & Bateman, 2000; House & Howell, 1992). Additionally, the postulated \nrelationship between followers\u201f and leaders\u201f personality represented by arrow (\u201c3\u201d) was based on \ntheory and referred to research that found that extraverts prefer a charismatic leadership style (Keller, \n1999). Consequently, in order to provide more evidence that similarity in terms of transformational \nleadership plays a crucial role in the perception and the acceptance of transformational leadership, it is \nnecessary to include the perception of leaders\u201f personality in the present study and examine the \nrelationships it has with followers\u201f personality and the perception of transformational leadership as \nwell as commitment to the supervisor.  \nIn line with prior research, we assume that followers\u201f personality (high extraversion, \nagreeableness, openness and low neuroticism) is related to the perception and acceptance of \ntransformational leadership. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 by the first arrow (\u201c1\u201d). \nTransformational leaders are supposed to be high in extraversion and low in neuroticism (Bono & \nJudge, 2004), which is symbolized by arrow (\u201c2\u201d) in Figure 1 (in our case on the basis of followers\u201f \nperception of leader personality), Felfe and Schyns (2006) concluded that similarity between followers\u201f \nand leaders\u201f personality may serve as an appropriate explanation for the enhancement of the perception \nand acceptance of transformational leadership. The assumed relationship between followers\u201f and their \nperception of leaders\u201f personality is symbolized by arrow (\u201c3\u201d). Rather than focusing on the actual \nsimilarity between followers\u201f and leaders\u201f personality, we focus on followers\u201f perception of their \nleader\u201fs personality. This is in line with Schyns and Sanders (2007) argument of the effect of assumed \nPersonality and leadership \n13 \nsimilarity (Cronbach, 1955; Watson, Hubbard & Wiese, 2000) on the perception of transformational \nleadership.  \n \n---- Insert Figure 1 here ---- \n \nIn order to develop our hypotheses, we have to clarify which concept of personality we refer to. \nIn line with prior studies, we define personality in terms of the Big Five (neuroticism, extraversion, \nopenness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). Conscientiousness as the fifth dimension of the Big \nFive was not included in thus study as, whilst it is generally related to performance in the workplace \n(Barrick & Mount, 1991; Judge, Higgins, Thoresen & Barrick, 1999), it is not specifically linked to \nleadership or transformational leadership (Bono & Judge, 2004). As transformational leaders are \nsupposed to be high in extraversion, agreeableness, openness and emotional stability (i.e., low in \nneuroticism; Bono & Judge, 2004; Judge & Bono, 2000), followers high in extraversion, agreeableness \nand openness are assumed to perceive or attribute more transformational leadership and to show more \naffective commitment to their supervisors. They are expected to show less continuance commitment to \nthe supervisor because their relationship to the supervisor is not based only on a lack of alternatives. In \ncontrast, a misfit between supervisor and follower will be characterized by continuance commitment. \nFor normative commitment, which is often highly related with affective commitment, no specific \nassumptions were made. Referring to the model presented in Figure 1 the following hypothesis are \nrepresented by arrow (\u201c1\u201d). \n \nPersonality and leadership \n14 \nH 1.1-1.3 Followers\u201f extraversion (1.1), agreeableness (1.2) and openness (1.3) are positively related to \nthe perception of transformational leadership and to the affective commitment to the supervisor, \nwhereas the relationship with continuance commitment is negative. \n \nTransformational leaders are also supposed to be high in emotional stability (i.e., low in \nneuroticism) (Bono & Judge, 2004). Although to a lesser extent than extraversion, agreeableness and \nopenness, neuroticism has been found to be negatively related to the perception and acceptance of \ntransformational leadership (Felfe & Schyns, 2006). According to our similarity assumption, followers \nwho are high in emotional stability should perceive more transformational leadership. Since \nneuroticism means lower self-esteem and higher anxiety, followers who are high in neuroticism may \navoid and withdraw when confronted with a transformational leader. Consequently, they are supposed \nto evaluate their leaders as less transformational and they develop only low levels of affective \ncommitment but high levels of continuance commitment. \n \nH 1.4 Followers\u201f neuroticism is negatively related to the perception of transformational leadership and \nto the affective commitment to the supervisor, whereas the relationship with continuance commitment \nis positive.  \n \nBono and Judge (2004) do not provide evidence as to whether transformational leaders are \nperceived as extraverted, emotionally stable etc. by their followers. For our study, however, in order to \nassess perceived similarity, it is important to examine in how far followers\u201f perception of leaders\u201f \npersonality is linked to the perception of transformational leadership and commitment to the supervisor. \nReferring to the model presented in Figure 1, we assume that followers\u201f perception of leaders\u201f \npersonality (high extraversion, high agreeableness, high openness and low neuroticism) is related to the \nPersonality and leadership \n15 \nperception of transformational leadership and to affective commitment to the supervisor (see arrow \n(\u201c2\u201d)). If this hypothesis is supported, one of the preconditions underlying the similarity assumption is \nfulfilled, namely, that the perception of leaders\u201f personality is related to the perception of \ntransformational leadership and affective commitment. \n \nH 2.1 Followers\u201f perception of leaders\u201f personality (high extraversion, high agreeableness, and high \nopenness and low neuroticism) is related to the perception of transformational leadership and to \naffective commitment to the supervisor. \n \nIn the next step, we have to show that leaders\u201f and followers\u201f personality do not function as two \nunrelated predictors of the perception and acceptance of transformational leadership. In order to \nsupport the assumption of similarity as an explanation for perception and acceptance, it is necessary \nthat they are correlated. Similarity is shown when people scoring high on a personality trait that is \nlinked to transformational leaders tend to evaluate their respective leader high on this dimension, and \nvice versa, when people who self-rate low on a personality dimension also perceive their leader to be \nlow on this dimension. This relationship is represented by arrow (\u201c3\u201d) in Figure 1.  \n \nConcerns may be raised about the appropriateness of our indicator for similarity. For example, if \nfollowers systematically rate themselves lower or higher than their leaders on the respective \ndimensions, then they will be different even though a high correlation may be found. Therefore \nwhether means differ systematically has to be tested.\n1\n  \n \nUp to now we have considered each relationship in Figure 1 as isolated (\u201c1, 2, 3\u201d). The question \nmust now be raised as to how the perception of leaders\u201f personality is involved in the relationship \nPersonality and leadership \n16 \nbetween follower personality and the perception and acceptance of leadership or, in other words, \nwhether the relationship between followers\u201f personality and their perception of transformational \nleadership can be explained by the perception of leaders\u201f personality. This means that followers who \nrate themselves high on extraversion, agreeableness, openness and low on neuroticism are prone to \nperceive their leader to be more transformational and develop a stronger commitment also rate their \nrespective leader high on extraversion, agreeableness, openness and low on neuroticism. In other \nwords, the relationship between followers\u201f personality and the perception of leadership can be \nexplained by the leaders\u201f personality, when it is perceived as similar and when personality is in line \nwith transformational leadership. In contrast however, if similarity was unimportant for the perception \nof leadership, both followers\u201f and leaders\u201f personality would independently predict the perception of \nleadership. This theoretical assumption empirically means that the relationships between followers\u201f \npersonality and the perception of leadership and commitment are mediated by the perception of \nleaders\u201f personality. Consequently, the influence of followers\u201f personality on the perception of \nleadership will be empirically reduced by the perception of leader personality. This reduced \nrelationship which is caused by common variance of followers\u201f and leaders\u201f personality in the \nprediction of perception and commitment, is represented by the thinner and interrupted arrow (\u201c4\u201d) in \nFigure 1. Thus we expect: \n \nH 2.2 The relationships between follower personality and the perception of transformational leadership \nand commitment to the supervisor are mediated by the perception of one\u201fs leader\u201f personality.  \n \nAt this stage, one might consider a different methodological approach, where similarity serves as a \nmoderator rather than a mediator. A moderation (test of the interaction between one\u201fs own and \nperceived leader personality) would mean that we expect to find different slopes for different \nPersonality and leadership \n17 \nperceptions of leaders\u201f personality. For example, the relationship between followers\u201f extraversion and \nperception of transformational leadership is high when the perception of leaders\u201f extraversion is also \nhigh, but low when the perception of leaders\u201f extraversion is low. However, this means that under the \ncondition of low followers\u201f extraversion and also low leaders\u201f extraversion, we should find higher \ntransformational leadership or commitment because they are similar than under the condition of low \nleader\u201f extraversion but high followers\u201f extraversion, which means, dissimilarity. Ideally, the \nrelationship between followers\u201f extraversion and perception of transformational leadership should be \nnegative when the perception of leaders\u201f extraversion is low. However, this is not what we hypothesise. \nIn other words, a moderator analysis would test for a higher perception of commitment and \ntransformational leadership in any case of similarity, no matter if extraversion was high or low. Rather, \nwe want to prove that the degree of perceived transformational leadership and commitment depends on \nsimilar levels of followers\u201f and leaders\u201f personality traits but only when they are in line with \ncharacteristics aligned with transformational leadership (high extraversion, high agreeableness, high \nopenness and low neuroticism). To use the extraversion example again, similar low extraversion is \nexpected to results in lower perception of transformational leadership and lower commitment whereas \nsimilar high extraversion should lead to higher perception of transformational leadership and \ncommitment.  \nMethod \nSample and procedure \nThis study was conducted in a financial service company. Questionnaires were distributed at the \nworkplace, and directly returned to the researcher. The participating employees were volunteers. \nConfidentiality was guaranteed. Participants were asked to indicate their personality as well as their \nperception of their direct supervisor\u201fs personality and his or her transformational leadership behaviour. \nIn addition, they were asked to indicate their affective and continuance commitment to their respective \nPersonality and leadership \n18 \nleader. Participants were 153 clerical workers of whom 75% were women. The mean age was 36.5 (SD \n= 9.3). \n \nMeasures \nFollowers\u2019 personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness) was assessed \nusing a German short version of the NEO-PI developed by Borkenau and Ostendorf (1993), based on \nthe instrument by Costa and McCrae (1985). The scales range from \u201c1 = not at all true\u201d to \u201c5 = \ncompletely true\u201d. The internal consistencies (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) for neuroticism, extraversion, \nopenness, and agreeableness were \u03b1 = .83, \u03b1 = .79, \u03b1 = .69, and \u03b1 = .70, respectively. Perceived \nleaders\u2019 personality was assessed using the same scales. The internal consistencies (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) \nfor neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness were \u03b1 = .78, \u03b1 = .80, \u03b1 = .79 and \u03b1 = .89 \nrespectively. All scales were optimized with respect to their factor structure and their reliability, \nleading to the exclusion of single items.  \n \nTo assess transformational leadership a translated and modified version of the MLQ5X Short \n(Felfe, 2006, original: Bass & Avolio, 1995) was administered. Five transformational dimensions were \ndistinguished: idealized influence, individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, and \ninspirational motivation. The scales range from 1 = never to 5 = almost always. The internal \nconsistencies (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) of the scales were \u03b1 = .74, \u03b1 = .79, \u03b1 = .74, \u03b1 = .74, and \u03b1 = .75, \nrespectively. Due to high scale intercorrelations among the transformational subdimensions an overall \nmeasure was created and used in this study (\u03b1 = .91). \n \nCommitment was measured by two scales for the assessment of commitment to the supervisor \ndeveloped by Felfe et al. (2006) based on Stinglhamber et al. (2002). The affective commitment scale \nPersonality and leadership \n19 \ncontained six items (sample item: \u201cI feel proud to work with my supervisor\u201d). The continuance \ncommitment scale (sample item: \u201cI am so used to working with my current supervisor that it would be \ntoo difficult for me to change\u201d) consisted of four items. The internal consistencies (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) \nwere \u03b1 = .88, and \u03b1 = .71, respectively.  \n \nPreliminary results  \nBefore testing the hypotheses, we wanted to establish whether the assessments of follower \npersonality and their perception of leader personality are independent. To this aim, we conducted four \nfactor analyses, one for each personality trait, including follower personality and their perception of \nleader personality. The factor analyses yielded two-factor solutions (screeplot criterion). Forcing a two \nfactor structure produced a clear differentiation between follower personality and their perception of \nleader personality for all four personality traits with high factor loadings on one and low factor loadings \non the other factor. Consequently, when rating personality, participants clearly differentiated between \ntwo foci: their own and their leaders\u201f personality. Detailed information on the factor analysis is \navailable from the authors. \n \nResults \nIn order to test H 1.1 \u2013 H 2.1 correlation analyses were conducted. As Table 1 shows, followers\u201f \nextraversion and agreeableness were positively related to the perception of overall transformational \nleadership (r = .20, p < .05; r = .25, p < .001), and to affective commitment to the supervisor (r = .19, p \n< .05; r = .23, p < .01). As expected, the relationship between followers\u201f extraversion and continuance \ncommitment to the supervisor was negative (r = -.16, p < .05). However, agreeableness was not related \nto continuance commitment (r = -.02, n.s.). Thus H 1.1 and H 1.2 are mainly supported. Although \ncorrelations between openness and transformational leadership and commitment were in the expected \nPersonality and leadership \n20 \n(positive) direction, they were only significant for continuance commitment to the supervisor (r = -.22, \np < .01). Thus H 1.3 is only supported for continuance commitment to the supervisor. In line with H 1.4 \nfollowers\u201f neuroticism was negatively related to the perception of transformational leadership and \naffective commitment, although not significantly (r = -.11, n.s.; r = -12, n.s.). A closer inspection of the \nsubscales revealed a substantial correlation with the subscale individualized consideration (r = -.26, p < \n.01). As expected, neuroticism and continuance commitment to the supervisor were positively related (r \n= .24, p < .01), thus, H 1.4 is partly supported. Additional regression analyses revealed that \nextraversion and agreeableness also predicted the perception of transformational leadership after \ncontrolling for sex and age (see Table 2). Neuroticism predicted individualized consideration \nnegatively. As expected in H 2.1 the perception of transformational leadership was positively related to \nperceived leaders\u201f extraversion (r = .61, p < .001), openness (r = .46, p < .001), agreeableness (r = .57, \np < .001), and negatively related to perceived leaders\u201f neuroticism (r = -.62, p < .001). The correlations \nwith affective commitment to the supervisor were r = .56 (p < .001), r = .38 (p < .001), r = .55 (p < \n.001), and r = -.54 (p < .001), respectively. Consequently, H 2.1 is supported.  \n \n---- Insert Table 1 here ---- \n \nIn order to test H 2.2 hierarchical regression analyses and Sobel-tests were conducted. According \nto Baron and Kenny (1986), mediation occurs when (1) an IV is significantly related to the mediator, \n(2) the IV significantly affects the DV in the absence of the mediator, (3) the mediator has a significant \nunique effect on the DV, and (4) the effect of the IV on the DV decreases with the addition of the \nmediator to the model. To test the first requirement, leaders\u201f personality was regressed on followers\u201f \npersonality. The standardized betas for extraversion, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness were: \u03b2 \nPersonality and leadership \n21 \n= .17, p < .05; \u03b2 = .17, p < .05; \u03b2 = .16, p = .051; and \u03b2 = .21, p < .01, respectively. The second \ncondition was tested in the second step of the hierarchical regressions predicting the perception of \ntransformational leadership and affective commitment to the supervisor. As can be seen in Table 2, this \ncriterion was met both for extraversion and agreeableness. Followers\u201f neuroticism only predicted \nindividualized consideration as a subscale of transformational leadership. The third condition was \nfulfilled for all leaders\u201f personality measures as there was a significant increase of explained variance \nof the perception of transformational leadership and commitment when leaders\u201f personality was \nentered in the third step of the regressions. In line with the fourth condition, the effect of followers\u201f \npersonality on criterion variables decreased upon the addition of leaders\u201f personality as a mediator for \nextraversion and agreeableness. Additional Sobel-tests indicated (Preacher & Hayes, 2004) that the \ndecrease was significant. For neuroticism, the decrease was only significant on the p < .10 level. Thus \nH 2.2 is supported for extraversion, agreeableness and partly for neuroticism but not for openness. To \nsum up, there is support for the mediation effect of extraversion and agreeableness, a tentative support \nfor neuroticism but no support for openness. \n \n---- Insert Table 2 here ---- \n \nSince the value of correlations for an interpretation in terms of similarity might be limited, \nadditional analysis were conducted. As indicated previously, concerns may be raised that levels of \nvariables may be completely different even though their correlation is high. An inspection of means \nand variation can help to estimate the probability of this potential flaw. As can be seen in Table 1, \nmeans and standard deviations for followers\u201f and leaders\u201f scores were only moderately different. \nAdditional t-tests revealed no significant differences for extraversion t (150) = 0.51 (p = .61), and for \nPersonality and leadership \n22 \nopenness t (128) = 0.33 (p = .74). The difference for neuroticism was small but significant (dif = .23, t \n(150) = 3.54, p = .01). For agreeableness, however, a considerable difference was found (dif = .44, t \n(150) = 6.95, p < .001). An additional cluster analysis with two clusters revealed one cluster (N = 73) \nwith high extraversion, agreeableness, openness and low neuroticism both for followers\u201f and leaders\u201f \npersonality with a second cluster (N = 76) exhibiting the reversed pattern (see Table 3). All differences \nbetween both clusters were significant (p < .001). These two clusters justify distinguishing between a \ngroup of participants with a high level of self-rated extraversion and a similarly high level of perceived \nleaders\u201f extraversion. The same argument holds for the other traits. As also shown in Table 3, the group \nhigh in extraversion, agreeableness, openness and low in neuroticism (cluster 1) perceived more \ntransformational leadership and is more committed to the supervisor (F(148) = 29.52, p < .001, and \nF(148) = 31.54 p < .001, respectively). A closer inspection of the means also reveals that the significant \noverall difference between follower and supervisor agreeableness results from the difference in cluster \n2.  \n \n---- Insert Table 3 here ---- \n \nDiscussion \nThere is no doubt that leaders and managers strongly influence the attitudes and behaviors of \ntheir subordinates in terms of satisfaction, commitment, performance and turnover intentions. \nTransformational leadership as a specific set of leader behaviours has proved to be effective with \nrespect to organizational outcomes by elevating followers\u201f motives and values. Therefore, \norganizations are interested in developing and improving managerial competences and specifically \ntransformational leadership skills of their managers. However, it is widely accepted that leadership is \nPersonality and leadership \n23 \nan interactive process. Followers do not only react to leadership but exert influence on the leadership \nprocess in several ways. They allow their respective leaders to exert influence depending on how much \na leader meets their expectations. The management and leaders on all levels should be aware of the \nactive part that followers take in an interactive leadership process. Increasing interest in follower-\ncentric research reflects the importance of a better understanding of the role of followers. \nIn addition, there are no objective measures to assess leaders\u201f behaviours. Mostly leaders are \nassessed by follower ratings. Leadership evaluations may, however, be biased and the acceptance of a \nleader may depend on the type of follower. Previous studies have shown that examining followers\u201f \npersonality is a promising approach for a better understanding of how followers perceive and evaluate \ntheir leaders. Particularly in the field of transformational and charismatic leadership, there is an \nongoing debate as to whether followers attribute charisma because their leaders seem to compensate \ntheir own deficits (e.g., followers with low self-esteem seek and prefer leaders with strong self esteem). \nIt is obvious that transformational leadership would be a questionable concept if its functioning \ndepended on this complementary relationship. However, there is growing empirical evidence based on \ndifferent theoretical backgrounds that similarity in terms of characteristics conducive to \ntransformational leadership (strong followers according to Klein and House, 1995) plays a crucial role \nin the transformational leadership process. As pointed out before, theoretical reasoning on the basis of \nsimilarity-attraction, social identity theory, and social projection converge in this point. \nThus adding to the body of follower-centric research, the aim of this study was to extend previous \nresearch on the relationship between of followers\u201f personality and the perception and acceptance of \ntransformational leadership. Specifically, we argued that the process leading to the relationship \nbetween follower personality and the perception of transformational leadership and acceptance in terms \nof commitment to the supervisor can be explained via perceived similarity with respect to \ncharacteristics conducive to transformational leadership. This means that perceived similarity rather \nPersonality and leadership \n24 \nthan complementarities in personality enhance the perception of transformational leadership and the \ndevelopment of a closer, affective-based relationship between leader and follower. It was the aim of \nthis study to provide empirical evidence for this assumption as previous studies have proved the \nrelationship between followers\u201f personality and the perception of leadership but neglected the role of \nleaders\u201f personality and the interplay between leader and follower personality. \nSimilar to prior studies (Felfe & Schyns, 2006; Keller, 1999; Schyns & Felfe, 2006), our results \nclearly indicate that the personality of followers is related to the perception of transformational \nleadership in real work settings. This is an important finding because one could argue that in prior \nexperimental studies the effect of personality on the perception and acceptance of transformational \nleadership was overestimated due to projection. \nAs expected, we found that followers high in extraversion and agreeableness perceive more \ntransformational leadership than their counterparts. For neuroticism we found a tentative negative \nrelationship with transformational leadership. A closer analysis of the sub-dimensions of \ntransformational leadership revealed a significant negative relationship between individualized \nconsideration and neuroticism. Thus, followers high in neuroticism perceive less individualized \nconsideration whereas followers high in emotional stability (low neuroticism) evaluate their respective \nleaders high on individualized consideration. Only for openness no clear relationship was found.  \nPrior studies reveal limited results for agreeableness (Schyns & Sanders, 2007); hence our results \nadd to this research and produce a clearer picture for this personality trait. Personality traits that are \nparticularly related to social interaction and communication, such as extraversion and agreeableness, \nappear to influence the perception of leadership. Reflecting on social identity theory, we can argue that \nthis depends in part on the context. Schyns and Sanders (2007) assumed that sample characteristics, \nthat is, traits that are especially salient in certain professions, could influence results. Within their \nPersonality and leadership \n25 \nstudy, for example, they found that conscientiousness was related to the perception of transformational \nleadership in accountants. Further research is needed in this area.  \nThis study also showed that followers\u201f personality not only influences the perception but also the \nacceptance of the leader. The influence of agreeableness of the acceptance of transformational \nleadership identified by Felfe and Schyns (2006) was reinforced and extended in our study. The Felfe \nand Schyns (2006) study involved participants who only imagined cooperation with a described leader. \nIn contrast, the evaluation in this study is based on real experience. Although in real life the \nrelationship may be influenced by many other factors than followers\u201f personality, extraversion and \nagreeableness were positively related to affective commitment to the supervisor. As assumed, the \ncorrelation is negative for neuroticism and positive for openness. However, the correlations were too \nlow to become significant. The results showed that followers high in extraversion and agreeableness \ntend to develop more affective commitment to their supervisor, indicating a close relationship that is \nbuilt on shared values, personal involvement and positive emotions. Therefore, these followers have a \nhigh interest in maintaining the relationship with their supervisor. Vice versa, followers low in \nextraversion do not only develop less affective commitment to their supervisor but also develop higher \ncontinuance commitment, indicating a relationship that is based on transactions. They consider \ninvestments that would be lost in case of a disruption of the relationship. A further reason for high \ncontinuance commitment is a perceived lack of alternatives. Whereas followers high in affective \ncommitment stay with their supervisor because they want to, followers high in continuance \ncommitment maintain the relationship because they have to. Openness is also negatively related to \ncontinuance commitment to the supervisor. In contrast, neuroticism is positively related to continuance \ncommitment. Followers with high levels of anxiety and insecurity and low self-esteem primarily accept \ntheir leaders because they think they have to. These findings add to the commitment literature as they \nprovide evidence that followers\u201f characteristics specifically influence different components and foci of \nPersonality and leadership \n26 \ncommitment (e.g., Clugston et al., 2000; Felfe et al., 2006). In conclusion, followers who show \npersonality traits similar to transformational leaders are more likely to perceive transformational \nleadership and to develop higher levels of committed to their leader.  \nBut why do employees with specific personality characteristics perceive more transformational \nleadership and engage in more affective based commitment? How can this relationship be explained? \nSimilarity has served as an explanation as to why followers high in extraversion and agreeableness but \nlow in neuroticism perceive more transformational leadership and evaluate their leaders more \npositively. This explanation can be grounded in different social psychological concepts such as the \nsimilarity attraction paradigm, social identity theory, and social projection. These concepts explain why \npersons tend to perceive relevant others as similar to themselves and, on our case, more specifically are \nsimilar with respect to personality traits that are linked to transformational leadership (as indicated by \nBono & Judge (2004). The results of this study close a gap in prior research as they clearly show the \nexpected correlations between perceived leaders\u201f personality and perception of leadership and \ncommitment. Leaders who are perceived as transformational and with whom participants develop \naffective commitment are perceived as being high in extraversion, agreeableness, openness and low in \nneuroticism.  \nIn order to provide evidence that similarity is directly linked to perception and commitment, a \nsecond step was proposed, namely that the relationships between followers\u201f personality and the \nperception of transformational leadership and commitment are mediated by the perception of one\u201fs \nleader as similar. The assumption of mediation includes an overlap between followers\u201f personality and \nperceived leaders\u201f personality. With respect to the perception of leadership, the mediation effect is \nsupported for extraversion, agreeableness and for neuroticism (the latter on the 10% level). For \naffective commitment, mediation is also found for extraversion and agreeableness. Addressing the \nconcern that levels of variables may be completely different even though their correlation is high, we \nPersonality and leadership \n27 \nshowed that means and standard deviations for followers\u201f and leaders\u201f scores were only moderately \ndifferent. In order to provide justification for our interpretation of the effect of a coherent pattern of \npersonality traits a cluster analysis was conducted. As expected, we could identify a cluster high in \nextraversion, agreeableness, openness and low in neuroticism that perceived more transformational \nleadership and is more committed to the supervisor than the cluster with a reversed pattern.  \nTo sum up, the results of this study provide further empirical evidence for the similarity \nhypothesis (Klein & House, 1995). Thus, the relationship between follower personality and the \nperception of transformational leadership and affective commitment to the supervisor can be explained \nin part by the perception of their respective leaders as similar and high in personality linked to \ntransformational leadership. Thus leadership dyads that are similar at least in the eyes of the followers \nare more likely to cooperate successfully than dyads where leaders and followers are different with \nregard to relevant personality traits. In other words, in case of dissimilarity chances for a successful \ninteraction are lower.  \nImplications \nOur results have important consequences for the organisational practice. Taken together, the \nstudies on follower personality and the perception of transformational leadership raise doubts on the \nvalidity of 360 degree feedback or similar kinds of evaluations of leaders undertaken by followers. Our \nresults imply that this feedback may not be independent of followers\u201f personality. Leaders can be \nadvised that feedback from followers high in extraversion and agreeableness and low in neuroticism \ntends to be positively biased, and even more important, feedback from followers low in extraversion \nand agreeableness and high in neuroticism tends to be negatively biased. Leaders should be aware of \nthis bias when receiving feedback. Feedback should not be attributed solely to leadership behaviour but \nmust be regarded in the light of upward or downward bias. This is especially fundamental since over-\nattributing transformational leadership or an exaggerated perception of transformational leadership may \nPersonality and leadership \n28 \nhave negative consequences. Leaders may be confronted with unrealistic expectations that they cannot \nfulfil. In the long run, mutual misunderstanding and disappointment may result. In order to avoid these \neffects, qualitative feedback and face-to-face communication are required. Standardized feedback \nsystems can only serve as a starting point for this. Leaders should not hesitate to discuss the results of \nleadership appraisals in team meetings and with individual followers in order to gain a better \nunderstanding of their followers\u201f perceptions. In order to organize open and efficient group meetings, \npractitioners have developed specific schedules and rules that might be helpful in negotiating mutual \nexpectations and thus establishing an appropriate way of leadership. The result of the dynamic \nnegotiation process may vary and may depend on the specific situation and the context.  \nFurthermore, leaders may expect more support and commitment from extraverted and agreeable \nfollowers. Although we have not examined the relationship between similarity and performance, this \nlink may be expected, especially as our results show a relationship between similarity and affective and \ncontinuance commitment to the leader. In terms of the selection of team members, this may be useful to \ntake into account when building a team: Given that similarity explains perception and acceptance \ngeneral managers or HR managers should consider the match between leaders and followers when \nbuilding dyads or teams. \nLimitations \nDue to the fact that our data is cross sectional, we cannot prove that the directions of the arrows \nin the model presented in Figure 1 are correct. For example, we cannot rule out that transformational \nleadership influences followers\u201f self perception. This may work through feedback or identification. It is \nalso possible that followers of transformational leaders tend to emulate their supervisors and therefore \ndevelop similar self-ratings. Also commitment may influence the attribution of personality and one\u201fs \nself concept. Longitudinal designs are required for the clarification of these questions.  \nPersonality and leadership \n29 \nAs another limitation of our study, we have to note that the influence of personality \ncharacteristics examined in this study is limited. Many other factors influence the perception and \nacceptance of leadership besides followers\u201f personality. Felfe and Schyns (2006) even raised doubts at \nto whether the effects of personality can be replicated in a real working context or whether they can \nonly be found in the beginning of cooperation between leader and follower when there is little \nexperience of cooperation. This study and the one undertaken by Schyns and Sanders (2007), however, \nshow that considerable influence of followers\u201f personality exists in \u201creal life\u201d settings.  \nWe cannot rule out that future studies may find a stronger influence of personality characteristics \nwhen other dimensions are included. Although less typical of leadership in general and \ntransformational leadership in particular, conscientiousness may be important, particularly in specific \ncontexts (Schyns & Sanders, 2007). Other personality characteristics may be of interest, such as self-\nesteem, self-efficacy, and tolerance of ambiguity. SIT related research indicates the possibility of \nrelevant characteristics besides personality in terms of static dispositions. Moreover, similarity may \ngenerally enhance the acceptance of a leader, and this effect can be extended to other styles or aspects \nof leadership. \nPersonality and leadership \n30 \nReferences \nAwamleh, R.

High scores \nresult from big differences whereas low scores indicate low differences. However this measure \ndoes not differentiate between low-low and high-high scorings (both will produce small \ndifferences). For our hypotheses, this differentiation is important as we do not assume that both \ncases result in high levels of transformational leadership and commitment. Instead, according to \nour model, people with similar low ratings should perceive low levels of transformational \nleadership and commitment whereas people with similar high ratings should have high levels of \nleadership and commitment. Thus we consider the correlation a tentative appropriate measure for \nsimilarity. \n"}
