A preliminary attempt at reconnection is made.  The implications of an interpretative turn in social \ntheorising are explored, and the interpretative perspectives of mentalism, intersubjectivism, textualism and \npractice theory examined in detail, in particular regarding how they and their equivalents in political study \ndiffer on units of analysis and how to understand one of the key social practices, language.  It is suggested \nthat text- and practice-oriented perspectives are well placed to sidestep common difficulties of voluntarism or \nsocial determinism, the mysteries of individual consciousness, and the metaphor of language as medium, and \nthat they offer rich and relatively unexplored possibilities for empirical study based on examining patterns of \nroutinised behaviour, their evolution, and reflexive individual responses to them.  Arguments are made for \ntheir wider application to the study of mass politics, in conjunction with a number of compatible research \nmethods. \n \n \n \nWHITE \n 2 \nDemocracy is widely understood to entail at least some degree of political involvement on the part \nof \u2018the people\u2019.  Popular sovereignty, as the principle constitutive of this type of political \narrangement, implies some level of engagement in the practices of collective self-rule.  It is hardly \nsurprising then that, since the early twentieth century at least, the political dispositions of the \ncitizenry in modern democracy have been a topic of considerable interest for the social and \npolitical sciences.  Yet how to study empirically these dispositions represents something of a \npuzzle, for the reason that \u2018the people\u2019 is a rather open idea that can be conceptualised in quite \ndifferent ways.  To list just some, the object of study might be conceived as a certain aggregate of \nindividuals, as a unitary collective, a communication system, an ensemble of practices, or perhaps \njust another piece of raw matter upon which material forces exert themselves.  The politics of \u2018the \npeople\u2019, as an empirical phenomenon, has therefore been subject to widely different approaches.   \nTo a large extent the evaluation of these approaches must take place at the level of \nnormative political theory.  Whether one chooses for instance to conceptualise \u2018the people\u2019 in \nindividualist or collectivist terms must depend in large part on the kinds of political philosophy and \nattendant ideas of popular sovereignty and citizenship one wishes to endorse.  But debates about \nmethodology are not purely a function of those about the right and the good.  They also hinge on \ncompeting ideas about the nature and significance of human bonds, the extension of regularities of \nbehaviour, the nature and capacities of human action, and how to understand change over time \u2013 \nquestions in other words which have perhaps been more central to debates in social than political \ntheory.  To note this disciplinary \u2018division of labour\u2019 is not to suggest that it is conceptually \ngrounded, since arguably there are common origins to the projects of social and political theory, \nand good reason to see the problems which they address as entwined (Wagner 2006).  It does \nsuggest, however, that empirical approaches to the politics of \u2018the people\u2019 may be enriched by \nreconnecting them to a number of debates in social theory which arguably have been heeded \ninsufficiently by the scholarly mainstream in political methodology.  These debates serve to \nWHITE \n 3 \nproblematise some of the presuppositions with which a significant amount of empirical research is \nconducted, and to suggest a number of new avenues for investigation.   \nThis paper aims to explore some of the implications of debates in social theory for the \nempirical study of the political inclinations of \u2018the people\u2019, where this refers to the behaviour and \ndispositions not so much of those who are professionally engaged in or oriented towards \ninstitutional politics (politicians, civil servants, activists, commentators, and the like) but of the \nwider public as a whole.  One may conveniently describe the field as mass politics, encompassing \nthe conventional sub-areas of political behaviour and public opinion, though the term should be \nread with an awareness of its potential drawbacks, notably the danger of a negative marking vis-\u00e0-\nvis \u2018elites\u2019, and of the presumption of a high degree of regularity across citizens.1  The field takes \nin a variety of research agenda, with explanation (in various forms) and prediction conventionally \nthe most prominent goals, but also involving social criticism and the identification of contingency \nand transformative potential. \nIn reading the study of mass politics through debates in social theory, it may be useful to \ndraw on a typology recently proposed by Andreas Reckwitz (Reckwitz 2002).  This begins with a \nbasic division of social theory into classically modern theories on the one hand, which treat \nbehaviour largely in terms of causal regularities, and late modern theories on the other, which \nemphasise the importance of human interpretation.  In the first category the two key approaches \nare the economic and the sociological, while in the second the paradigmatic approaches can be \ntermed \u2018mentalist\u2019, \u2018intersubjectivist\u2019, \u2018textualist\u2019 and \u2018practice-oriented\u2019.  In what follows, we \nshall see these approaches can be linked to a series of analogous ones in the study of mass politics: \nthe classically modern economic and sociological traditions find expression in rational-choice and \nnorms-and-values approaches to political behaviour, while the interpretative perspectives of \nmentalism and intersubjectivism find expression in political psychology and deliberative \ndemocracy.  Text- and practice-oriented approaches are also present in the study of mass politics, \nthough so far their adoption has been rarer.   \nWHITE \n 4 \nEstablishing this link to wider social-theoretical traditions allows a better understanding of \nthe different positions occupied by approaches to mass politics on a number of crucial debates, and \nallows an exploration of the critiques to which these positions may be subject.  As one moves \nthrough the different traditions, it becomes possible to chart the arguments for a series of \ntheoretical shifts, first from a focus predominantly on strongly determined regularities of behaviour \n(whether seen as a function of individual rationality or societal norms and values) to a greater \nconcern with reflexive interpretation, and then from an emphasis on individual cognition to shared \nstructures of symbolic meaning.  Further, one may discern the arguments for looking not just at the \ncommunicative possibilities these shared structures enable, but at the tacit knowledge and \nroutinised action they are embedded in.   \nHaving explored the major trajectories of these debates, some of which have yet to make \ntheir presence fully felt in research on mass politics, the paper considers their implications for \nresearch methods.  The suggestion is that the enduring dominance of quantitative opinion polling \ndoes not reflect an equivalent ascendancy in theoretical discussion of the methodological \nassumptions that underpin it.  This invites discussion of a number of alternative methods, broadly \nassociated with text- and practice-oriented perspectives, whose application could usefully be \nextended.  In a field where the greater part of research has tended to model itself on one scientific \nideal in particular \u2013 generally, the verification or falsification of propositions \u2013 the full potential of \nempirical work to inform the development of new ideas has been realised only thinly, something \nthese alternative perspectives may be well placed to remedy, albeit with sensitivity to certain \nenduring challenges.  While some such perspectives have their origins in critiques of the \nestablished approaches, their potential is nonetheless for a strongly positive contribution to the \nfield, on the one hand by expanding the set of resources with which research is imagined and \nconducted, on the other by sharpening the claims that are made for it.   \n \n \nWHITE \n 5 \nAn Interpretative Turn \n \nFor the purposes of overview, classically modern theories of the human world can be grouped in \ntwo broad traditions.  In the one, extending from the utilitarianism of the Scottish Enlightenment to \nmodern-day rational choice theory, the individual\u2019s pursuit of interest is taken to be the basic \nprinciple of human behaviour, and action is understood in terms of a purposeful, consequentialist \nlogic.  Man is viewed as a rational homo economicus, maximising his \u2018utility\u2019 according to \ninterests generally treated as unambiguous.  In the second tradition, regularly presented as \nantithetical to the first, and associated in particular with the work of Parsons and the later \nDurkheim, social structures are understood to be the basic ordering phenomenon, with action \nguided by a convergence of norms and values.\n2\n  Just like individual interests, these are treated as \nobjectively given rather than subjectively appraised, and are taken to produce regularities of \nbehaviour across the given unit of population, often referred to as \u2018society\u2019.  The behaviour of \nhomo sociologicus is norm-oriented rather than purpose-oriented, but the significance of \ninterpretation is again downplayed: in these classical sociological accounts, social order is founded \non a normative consensus that permits little space for reflection and reappraisal (Reckwitz 2002).   \nBoth of these theoretical traditions form the basis for approaches to the study of mass \npolitics.  Perhaps the classic rendition of homo economicus in the political-science literature is \nfound in the work of Anthony Downs, who proceeds from the assumption of man\u2019s instrumental \nrationality to elaborate a theoretical scheme intended to account for a variety of patterns of \nengagement and disengagement in mass politics (Downs 1957).  Based on the deductive method, \nand with a strong set of starting assumptions concerning how \u2018rational man\u2019 behaves, Downs\u2019 \ntheory does not lend itself easily to empirical study; nonetheless it has been influential for a \nsizeable body of research which looks at the accuracy with which economic interests can be used \nto explain political behaviour such as voting (Lipset 1959; Verba and Nie 1972).  Drawing instead \non the holistic classical sociological tradition, a large number of authors emphasise the extent to \nWHITE \n 6 \nwhich mass politics is guided by societal norms and values.  Empirical research has looked at \nquestions such as the changing values of western societies, or in the European context at the degree \nto which the populations of the EU member-states share common values such that one may speak \nof a \u2018European identity\u2019.3  Homo sociologicus, who acts according to the logic of appropriateness, \nis thus counterposed to his consequentialist cousin, setting off a string of debates about whether the \nindividual or societal structure should be taken as the basic unit of an explanatory account. \nOne of the major trends in latter-twentieth-century social theorising alerts us to the fact that \nthese two traditions have rather more in common than their tendency to position themselves \nagainst one another might suggest.  Crucially, both approaches, by drastically underplaying the \nrole of human interpretation and relegating the ideational to epiphenomenal status, exclude from \nview much that is indispensable to an understanding of the social world.  One can illustrate some \nof the difficulties this may lead to by looking at how these two approaches make sense of one of \nthe most basic elements of political behaviour: voting.  The problems of a rational-choice \nperspective on voting have been well-documented.  Given that interests are essentially ambiguous, \nany \u2018thick\u2019 conception of rational choice which seeks to remove non-material factors altogether \ntends to fare badly, and empirical studies are often unable to avoid bringing in the interpretative \ndimension: \u2018attitudes\u2019 usually make an appearance as an \u2018intervening variable\u2019 to explain how \ninterests guide behaviour.\n4\n  More fundamentally, even \u2018thinner\u2019 formulations of rational choice \nwhich, while maintaining the emphasis on utility, acknowledge the unpredictability of preferences, \nstruggle to account for the willingness of large numbers of citizens to go to the polls at all in the \nface of the miniscule probability that their vote will be decisive (Green and Shapiro 1994; \nFriedman 1995).  Conventional cost-benefit analyses suggest that this expenditure of time and \nenergy for such a remote chance of payoff hardly constitutes a \u2018rational choice\u2019 \u2013 yet many a \ncitizen, whom these accounts assume to be rational, still votes on a regular basis.  Suggesting, as \nsome have done, that the citizen\u2019s decision to vote is rational because it maximises the satisfaction \nWHITE \n 7 \nthat accompanies the performance of civic duties merely points attention away from the individual \nto the embedding milieu in which her sense of duty takes shape (Riker and Ordeshook 1968).   \nGiven that in order to account for why the act of voting should bring psychic rewards one \nneeds a theory of the social significance attached to voting and of the emergence of expectations \nconcerning good citizenship, this may seem to point to the superiority of a perspective more in \ntune with the model of homo sociologicus.  Citizens might then be seen as inclined to vote because \nof societal norms which cast voting as a civic duty (Knack 1992).  Yet such a perspective is \nseverely problematic too, since the emphasis on regularities of behaviour is liable to obscure the \nvariety of meanings attached to the act of voting, and the variety of reasons for which it may be \npursued.  Voting may be understood variously for instance as a matter of expressing attachment to \na particular political party, of expressing support for a particular representative, or of expressing \nappreciation for the opportunity to vote.  Considerable disagreement about the meaning of voting \nmay be masked by any attempt to reduce it to the outcome of a normative consensus.  Likewise, a \nhelpful approach to the study of mass politics should be able to make sense not just of voting itself \nbut of the decision not to vote.  While rational choice may be too swift to explain this in terms of a \nshort-term cost calculation, classical sociological approaches may be too quick to read non-voting \nas evidence of a shift in values away from the public to the private sphere, or the decline of norms \nof public engagement.  Such possibilities should not be discounted, but there is a danger that one \noverlooks the contrary possibility: that the decision not to vote is made precisely because of its \nsymbolic significance as a divergence from commonly held expectations.  The politically \nimportant element of protest is crucial if one wants to understand acts of voting abstention: how \npeople play with social expectations and use them for political effect is critical, yet is missed if one \nfocuses solely on purported overarching norms and values as these are inferred from behavioural \nregularities, just as it is missed if one looks only for means-ends rationality.  The type of classical \nsociological approach is liable to be blind to the meanings attached to non-conformist behaviour, \nwith the risk of marginalising individual agency and falling prematurely into social determinism.   \nWHITE \n 8 \nFor those whose goal is to predict human conduct, these concerns will be insufficient to \nwarrant a re-examination.  One may feasibly enough state one\u2019s main task as the search for \nbehavioural regularities without inquiry into their origins, in the manner of the behaviourist \ntradition.  Such an approach, insofar as it produces suggestive findings and does not mistake \nregularities for imperatives, may have considerable instrumental value for the identification and \nresponse to large-scale trends: for the design of public policy, one might want to know for instance \nwhether levels of voting abstention correlate with racial background and\/or levels of income.  \nMoreover, it may be that the heuristic application of rational choice or classical sociological \nmodels may usefully guide such research.\n5\n  However, the study of mass politics cannot be reduced \nonly to the search for regularities, since there is much that such regularities do not reveal, indeed \nmay disguise.  Nor do the models of homo economicus and sociologicus suffice as the means to a \ncloser understanding of behaviour.  The recognition that these two traditions in fact have rather \nmore in common than their mutual opposition might suggest provides the opening for a series of \ninterpretative approaches. \nIn social theory, the interpretative tradition sometimes goes under the heading \u2018culturalist\u2019, \nand finds extensive elaboration in the field of cultural sociology; but \u2018culture\u2019 is here understood \nnot in terms of a tightly structured system of rules, in the image of classical sociological \napproaches, but rather with reference to the ideational resources for interpreting the world \navailable to people as part of the social environment they inhabit and expressed in their practices \nof meaning-making (Swidler 1986, 2001b) (Wedeen 2002).\n6\n  Unlike in the reasoning of the \nindividualist-consequentialist perspective, a certain accent is placed on the importance of \ntranspersonal phenomena \u2013 with language often the most celebrated, but not the only, example \u2013 \nyet in contrast to the holism of traditional sociological approaches there is an emphasis also on the \npossibility of human beings actively to renegotiate their cultural milieu rather than merely be \nconstituted by it.  The language of \u2018identity\u2019, with its implication of cross-spatial and cross-\ntemporal sameness, is abandoned or sharply problematised (Brubaker and Cooper 2000).  Perhaps \nWHITE \n 9 \nmost generally, one can say that the human being is re-endowed with a basic level of reflexivity, \nand is no longer taken to be the passive agent of instrumental rationality or social structure.  One \ncan speak of a new emphasis on the creativity of human action (Joas 1996).  For those interested in \nmass politics, this is likely to be a welcome shift, since it accords well with a normative concern \nfor the principle of collective self-rule and the possibility of political change.   \nFollowing the typology referred to above, it seems possible to find analogues in the study \nof mass politics for the interpretative social-theoretical approaches of mentalism, \nintersubjectivism, and text- and practice-oriented approaches.  The first of these, in which the \nideational or symbolic world is conceived in terms of the structure of individual minds, finds \nexpression in the field of political psychology, an approach to mass politics which emerged in the \nUS in the early 1960s assisted by advances in the fields of sampling theory and psychology.\n7\n  As \nthe self-description \u2018psychological\u2019 implies, the approach is strongly subjectivist and maintains a \nfirm focus on the individual and that which is in the individual\u2019s head: a conventional layout of \nkey terms specifies the subject matter as beliefs (deeply held ideas), attitudes (general \norientations), and opinions (expressly formulated views on a particular subject) (Kavanagh 1983).  \nNo strong a priori position is taken on what the contents of these mental states may be, but they \nare generally taken to be the key elements in a causal account of political behaviour.  In the words \nof one scholar, there is \u2018a golden hierarchical assumption of the study of political behaviour: the \nidea that for every individual, his beliefs influence his attitudes, which, in turn, influence his actual \nbehaviour\u2019 (Bruter 2005, p.3).  While recent approaches in the field of political psychology have \nlooked increasingly at how environmental factors outside the mind, such as the media or political \nparties, may influence the structuring of mental activity, and have shown growing concern with the \nrole of emotion in political cognition and the processing of information, the approach still remains \nstrongly individualist and, as we shall discuss in a later section, generally relies on research \nmethods which require this.\n8\n   \nWHITE \n 10 \nThe second approach, intersubjectivism, has been linked directly to political study through \nthe work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas (Habermas 1984, 1989, 1990, 1996).  The model of deliberative \ndemocracy he proposes is informed by his (intersubjectivist) theory of communicative action, in \nwhich agents are conceived as expressing their individuality in the context of social relationships \nof communication (Habermas 1984, p.17) (Cooke 2003).  Rationality is central to this perspective, \nbut now understood in terms of a social process of argumentation and reason-giving leading to \nenlightened and ultimately consensual opinion-formation.  Unlike in the models of homo \neconomicus and sociologicus, the capacity of citizens to reappraise and revise their political \ninclinations in the light of reasoned social interaction is given emphasis.  As a normative model of \ndemocracy, the deliberative approach has by no means been elaborated always in an empirical \nmode, nor has it been addressed primarily to mass politics: indeed, its emphasis on a particular \nstyle of rationality has led to the charge of an inherent elitism (Sanders 1997).  But the feasibility \nof its claims has been the subject of a considerable body of recent research (Chambers 2003). \nText- and practice-oriented approaches,\n9\n in which the symbolic world is located in the \nmeanings immanent to sets of routinised practice (with language usage a prominent one) also find \nexpression in the study of mass politics (Wedeen 2002), though they have perhaps never acquired \nthe mainstream status of political-psychological and, to a lesser extent, deliberative-\nintersubjectivist approaches.  We shall refer later to a number of approaches informed by the ideas \nof social theorists, cultural sociologists and anthropologists such as Anthony Giddens, Clifford \nGeertz, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu.\n10\n  Such approaches tend to define themselves in \nopposition not just to the classical economistic and sociological theories but also to the two \ninterpretative traditions mentioned, and so they will be outlined in greater detail when discussing \nbelow some of the substantive points of debate to have emerged in their encounter.  Like \ninterpretative approaches more generally, they place emphasis on the symbolic world and the \nvarious kinds of knowledge which inform and constrain actors\u2019 behaviour, but the accounts they \ngive rise to are generally less universalist in their intended scope, and less oriented to the study of \nWHITE \n 11 \ncausal relationships.  This points to the study of mass politics as a project of \u2018thick description\u2019, \ninvolving the analysis of the political implications of prevalent forms of practice rather than the \nsearch for law-like regularities and causal mechanisms that govern the social world as a whole \n(Geertz 1973; Schatzki 2002, pp.xi-xii). \nWhile it makes sense to link these three approaches together under the heading of an \n\u2018interpretative turn\u2019 so as to underline their divergence from the models of homo economicus and \nsociologicus, this can only be a prelude to looking more closely at the points of difference between \nthem.  Their shared concern to reduce reliance on non-interpretative approaches appears to this \nauthor quite valid, but some of the perspectives put forward in substitute have been shown equally \nsusceptible to critique, with further theoretical divergences as the result. \n \n \nUnits of Analysis: From the Individual Mind to Language and Practice \n \nThe mentalist focus on the individual mind has been challenged by social theorists on a number of \ngrounds.  A first question which arises is whether it makes sense to take the individual mind in \nisolation as an object of study, and to ascribe to it a causal status for behaviour (Schatzki 2002, \n1996).  From the perspective of intersubjectivist and textualist\/practice-oriented approaches, this \nwill seem a curious move, since it implies that mental states are independent of given situations \nand the social relationships and material phenomena of which these are composed.  According the \nmind this kind of transcendental status may seem redolent of the much problematised Cartesian \nmind-body dualism, a kind of secularisation of the Christian world-view in which the individual is \nreified as an independent unit so as to make sense of doctrines of free will and personal \nresponsibility.  Even if one wants to set aside issues of consistency across contexts, and propose \nthat in the given situation mental states do have a causal effect on behaviour (in Davidson\u2019s terms \nthat a person\u2019s \u2018holding a belief\u2019 can be the explanation of their subsequent action (Davidson \nWHITE \n 12 \n2001)), one will inevitably face difficulties concerning how to conceptualise the possibility that \nthere is no one-to-one correspondence between beliefs and courses of action. An individual may \nsimultaneously holds multiple beliefs which do not all point to the same course of action, or, \nprecisely because they do point to the same action, it may be hard to associate that action with a \nparticular belief.  Moreover, it may be that much behaviour has a routinised quality, and that the \nkind of knowledge which informs it cannot easily be expressed in the purposive, propositional \nform implied by a desire-belief model (Schatzki 2001). \nA second question posed to the mentalist perspective asks how, even if one takes seriously \nthe ontological and\/or methodological priority granted to the individual mind, one is to gain access \nto its contents.  The conceptual problems just noted reappear as epistemological ones: mental \nphenomena such as beliefs resist definitive description because they are underdetermined by the \nopinions which an individual articulates (Barnes 2001, p.17; Schatzki 1996, chap. 2).  One can \ninfer as many beliefs as one wishes from a given stated opinion, rendering the reconstruction of an \nindividual\u2019s beliefs a matter of strong conjecture.  Furthermore, by probing them in a certain way, \none is establishing a particular context, one that may influence the findings.  When an individual is \nasked to report his\/her beliefs and reasons for action, the response is never a straightforward \ndescription but a \u2018speech act\u2019 in a new exchange, perhaps self-justificatory in its logic (Austin \n1962).  In advance of significant developments in cognitive science (the point would still be \ncontentious) there is an unavoidably metaphorical aspect to any claim that an individual \u2018holds\u2019 a \ncertain set of beliefs, and reason to be cautious about assuming a causal effect on behaviour. \nArguably many of the challenges which have been encountered by researchers in political \npsychology are traceable to these problematic underlying assumptions.  A research question typical \nof the discipline in its formative years was the extent to which people\u2019s beliefs and attitudes \nreproduce the coherent and stable ideological structures associated with elite opinion such as the \nleft-right divide.  Philip E. Converse set as his object of enquiry \u2018the nature of belief systems in \nmass publics\u2019, defining a belief system as \u2018a configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the \nWHITE \n 13 \nelements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence\u2019 (Converse \n1964, p.207).  The important conclusion of Converse\u2019s study was that, other than for those he \ntermed elites (the top 10% or so), beliefs about politics tended to be unstable and weakly \nintegrated: \u2018the net result, as one moves downward, is that constraint declines across the universe \nof idea-elements, and that the range of relevant belief systems becomes narrower and narrower\u2019 \n(Converse 1964, p.213).  While this was a sophisticated study and its results were widely received \nas significant, it exerted an agenda-setting influence which was by no means entirely positive.\n11\n  \nThe approach relied on the strong assumption \u2013 again, metaphor one might say \u2013 that inside the \nindividual\u2019s mind there are attitudes and beliefs which (s)he carries around and deploys in like \nmanner from one situation to another, regardless of the context, so as to form an opinion.  \nConverse defined constraint in its \u2018static\u2019 version as \u2018the success we would have in predicting, \ngiven initial knowledge that an individual holds a specified attitude, that he holds certain further \nideas and attitudes.\u2019 (Converse 1964, p.207)  Ideas and attitudes are thus described as though they \ncome in a specifiable unit form, like the songs which make up a record collection, possessed or not \npossessed.  Having set up the question in these terms, and having discovered little in the way of \nsuch constraint in the course of his empirical study, the natural consequence was a polemical \ndebate about whether \u2018attitudes\u2019 or \u2018non-attitudes\u2019 are the norm amongst non-elites (Converse \n1970).  Adhering to the terms of this debate, John Zaller was able to reach the conclusion that \ncitizens perhaps respond to opinion polls according to whatever happens to be at the top of their \nminds:  his suggestion that they \u2018make it up as they go along\u2019 was successfully provocative (Zaller \n1992) (Sniderman et al. 2001, p.256).  The shadow hanging over the mainstream in political \npsychology has therefore been the lingering suspicion that, taking individual minds as the unit of \nanalysis, the target of enquiry may be too amorphous to be worthy of study. \nPolitical psychology has evolved as a discipline, and most scholars in the field no longer \nseek the kind of over-arching belief system which Converse was looking for.  The more recent \nliterature tends to downplay the possibility of global constraint (i.e. integrated beliefs across the \nWHITE \n 14 \nrange of political issues) and to focus on domain-specific ideational packages structured not so \nmuch by sharply-defined ideology as by heuristics and schemae (Johnston Conover and Feldman \n1984) (Sniderman et al. 1991).  Yet the emphasis on the individual mind persists.  Partly one can \nlink this to the political theory which underpins this approach, specifically its aggregationist \nconception of public opinion (Price 1992).  For as long as public opinion is conceived as the sum \ntotal of individual opinions, there will be the inclination to reify opinions, beliefs and attitudes as \nindividual phenomena which are \u2018in there somewhere\u2019 so that there is something which can then \nbe aggregated.  These have to be seen as acontextual, since absent the assumption that there is only \none proper way for these to be formulated and described the logic of numbers would break down \nand the resultant aggregations would be meaningless.   \nBut more generally the difficulty is rooted in the individualist ontology this perspective \nmaintains (admittedly a more interpretative one than that of homo economicus).  Albeit in the \nname of polling public opinion, respondents are questioned in private, are encouraged to make up \ntheir own minds without help from the interviewer or from acquaintances, and are guaranteed \nanonymity of response, all lest their answers be distorted in some way.  The goal is to minimise the \nintrusion of \u2018context\u2019 (sometimes referred to as \u2018bias\u2019 or \u2018framing effects\u2019).  When empirical \nfindings do not invite unequivocal conclusions, it is often these situational factors which take the \nblame, resulting in more debate about whether \u2018real attitudes\u2019 are being missed because of the \ndistorting effect of framing, and whether the attitudes which have been documented are not in fact \n\u2018non-attitudes\u2019 masquerading as attitudes.12  These debates are forced upon the discipline by the \nproblematic starting assumption of the acontextual individual mind as the unit of analysis. \nThe difficulties of the mentalist approach seem to suggest the need to move away from a \nstrong emphasis on the unitary individual.  To be sure, empirical research of considerable value \nmay still be generated while adhering to this perspective: correlations between verbal statements, \nor between statements and voting patterns, may be richly suggestive, especially when used \ncomparatively to flag up variations across time and space.  The language of beliefs and attitudes \nWHITE \n 15 \nwill often be a natural one in which to make sense of empirical findings of considerable \nconsequence.  Nor is it plausible to seek to dispense altogether with the idea of individual mental \nstates: any interpretative approach which is not wholly determinist must make space for innovation \nand individual creativity, even if one avoids phrasing this in cognitive terms (Hollis 1994, p.196).\n13\n  \nBut an approach which gives centre-stage to the consciousness of the individual will inevitably \nhave little to say about the underlying symbolic patterns and broader schemes of meaning into \nwhich putative mental states fit, and which may enable and constrain individuals in their opinion-\nformation and political action.   \nClearly the answer cannot be simply to revert to holism in the manner of the classical \nsociological approaches mentioned above, with their emphasis on law-like societal norms, since \nthis would revive the same tendencies towards social determinism.  Rather, it may be that it is the \ndichotomy of society and the individual which needs to be overcome, so as to enable a focus \ninstead on what might be called specifically the social: the domain of transpersonal coordinated \nactivity, where agents are linked by the mutual responsiveness required to maintain shared \npractices.\n14\n  Such a perspective allows one to \u2018decentre\u2019 the individual mind by seeing it as \ninterdependent with wider processes of human interaction, whether one conceives these in terms of \na transpersonal orientation to rationality, in terms of the disciplining effects of discourse(s), or the \nconventions of practice that interpersonal coordination demands.  By seeing the individual as \ndrawing upon ideational resources or \u2018repertoires\u2019 which predate her and constrain the possibilities \nopen to her, yet which she redeploys in new ways and whose reproduction she actively shapes, the \nvoluntarism implied when each individual is conceptualised as constructing the ideational world \nfrom scratch can be avoided without reverting to a social determinist perspective which reduces \nthe individual to the passive bearer of structure (Sewell 1992, pp.7ff).   \nThis move can be associated with both intersubjectivism and textualist\/practice-oriented \napproaches, though these diverge in ways we shall examine.  One of the natural objects of study is \nthen language.  The study of discourse seems to hold out the possibility of dissolving the \nWHITE \n 16 \ndichotomy of individual and society, since discourse plainly cannot be understood purely in terms \nof individual actions and intentions or collective structures: the sentence is not \u2018owned\u2019 by the \nspeaker, since it requires borrowed vocabulary and grammar to be meaningful, yet vocabulary and \ngrammar would neither exist nor evolve but for the incessant creativity of the speaker.  The \nspeaker is both master and slave (Barthes 1982).\n15\n  In addition to this useful starting-point, a focus \non language invites particular emphasis on the context in which opinions are formed, the process \nby which they are developed, and the meanings in which they are embedded, all of which are \nneglected in the mentalist approach.  It also invites sensitivity to a wider field of political \nbehaviour than simply the ticking of boxes on questionnaires and voting slips.  Language is not \nhowever the only site of activity that one might want to explore empirically.  A wide range of \nsocial practices might be susceptible to examination, including patterns of cooperation and \ncollective action, practices of conflict and conflict avoidance, or the enactment of local knowledge.   \nBefore looking more closely at the kinds of research programme for mass politics that \nmight derive from a focus on the social rather than the individual or the structural-societal, let us \nlook more closely at one of the key points of contention between intersubjectivism and text-\n\/practice-oriented approaches: how one should understand the nature of that social practice on \nwhich they are generally agreed is of notable importance, language. \n \n \nFrom Rational Communication to Presuppositions and Routinised Practice \n \nThe classically modern theories discussed in the first section, and the mentalist approach discussed \nin the last, are based on an ideal-language perspective: they assume that there is no reason to doubt \nthe possibility of a perfect correspondence between the phenomenal world and our descriptions of \nit, so long as we use language properly.  It is assumed for instance that \u2018interests\u2019, \u2018values\u2019 or \n\u2018beliefs and attitudes\u2019 are susceptible to correct and incorrect description, and that through \nWHITE \n 17 \nempirical study the researcher may inch towards the former.  This is the logic of the scientific \nmethod, as derived from a certain understanding of how the queen of the sciences \u2013 physics \u2013 has \nprogressed in the modern period (albeit an understanding which contemporary physicists might be \nwary of) (Murphy 1995).  The intersubjectivist approach, while according language a more \nprivileged status than simply the medium of description, and while insisting that the individual not \nbe isolated from the context of discursive interaction, maintains a similarly idealist perspective on \nthe nature of language, and attracts far-reaching critique from text- and practice-oriented \napproaches for this reason. \nFor intersubjectivists, language is the crucial means by which communication between \nindividuals becomes possible and, of particular political significance, the means by which free \npublic reason can be exercised (Habermas 1984, p.99).  The perspective is generally linked tightly \nto a critical-theoretical stance which emphasises the possibility of overcoming distorted views \nthrough reasoned debate.  It is assumed that discursive interaction which is free and fair will \nproduce a rational consensus on truth \u2013 perhaps even that such a rational consensus can be defined \nas that which emerges when conditions for free and fair discursive interaction are achieved \n(Habermas 1990).\n16\n  Where these conditions fail, it is assumed to be for empirical rather than \ntheoretical reasons.  The possibility of language to express a universal form of reason is axiomatic.  \nText- and practice-oriented approaches, on the other hand, abandon the ideal-language perspective.  \nMeaning is taken to be rooted in language usage, and there can be no comprehensive system of \nrules by which to regulate uniformity of usage since rule-following requires interpretation, and \ndepends ultimately not on theoretical propositions but on the practical know-how of competent \nactors.  Meaning is possible not because there is a universal grammar which anchors language \npractice, but because language-users tacitly \u2018know how to carry on\u2019 based on \u2013 though never quite \nreducible to \u2013 their cultural familiarity with like situations (Schatzki 1996).17  In this view, treating \nlanguage as purely a medium is to severely downplay the significance of routinised practice and \nthe taking-of-things-for-granted.  As James Tully has emphasised, drawing on the insights of the \nWHITE \n 18 \nlater Wittgenstein, not everything on the basis of which people think, argue, and act as they do can \nbe justified (Tully 1989, p.181).  There is always a point at which justifications are exhausted, \nwhen bedrock is reached and \u2018my spade is turned.  Then I am inclined to say: This is simply what I \ndo\u2019 (Wittgenstein 1976, \u00a7217).  Indeed, it is precisely the impossibility of shaking off all features \nof particularity, and the rootedness of speakers in conventional practices, which establishes the \n\u2018rough ground\u2019, as Wittgenstein calls it, upon which discursive endeavours like communication, \ndeliberation and opinion-formation can be achieved.  It is therefore the tacit dimension (Polanyi \n1967) that deserves particular attention as one examines the social world, since it is here that the \nterms of debate are set, and where the constraints on political change may be found.   \nThis fundamental point of disagreement notwithstanding, both intersubjectivism and text- \/ \npractice-oriented perspectives are attractive for the study of mass politics in that they direct \nattention towards phenomena which are readily susceptible to empirical exploration rather than \ntowards the invisible phenomena of the cognitive realm.\n18\n  Both might take for instance an \neveryday discussion on matters of political relevance as their object of study, with the discursive \ninteraction itself rather than the individuals party to it as the principal point of interest.  But the two \napproaches then point research in different directions.  Intersubjectivists, insofar as they follow a \nHabermasian critical agenda, will want to examine how closely the interaction approaches the \ndeliberative ideal.  Of importance for them will therefore be questions to do with how the \ndiscussion evolves, the extent to which preferences seem to change in the course of discussion, the \nvalidity of the reasoning strategies adopted, the kinds of consensus which emerge, and the extent to \nwhich the opinion generated can be said to be of better quality than that which emerges from \ntraditional polling.  Text- and practice-oriented perspectives on the other hand will be more \nconcerned with the unintended and tacit aspects of the discussion, and their enabling and \nconstraining effects.  There may be less focus on opinions as such and more on the common-sense \nassumptions which underlie these and which, by restricting the sphere of agreement or \ndisagreement to a manageable size, make possible the exchange of views.  Researchers may \nWHITE \n 19 \nexplore the kinds of topic brought up in conversation, the reference-points invoked in their \ndiscussion, the usage of key concepts, and the assumptions made about political agency.  Also, \nrather than seeing the discussion as the achievement of distinct individual subjects, they will be \ninterested in the kinds of subjecthood the discussion makes possible: the \u2018I\u2019s\u2019, \u2018we\u2019s\u2019 and other \nroles or \u2018subject positions\u2019 routinely invoked, the power-political implications of these, the \ndifferent patterned discourses in which these are embedded, and the contradictions which arise as \ndifferent discourses are drawn upon.  Researchers may be interested in silences or bodily \nexpressions, including mannerisms of deference or authority, and the acceptance or rejection of \nthese.  Stepping back from the particular case, they may also want to explore how far such \ndiscussions are naturally occurring in everyday life, and the situational factors which may hinder \nor facilitate them. \n \n \nImplications for Research Methods \n \nThe opinion poll or survey has generally been the research method of choice for those studying \nmass politics from the perspective of classically modern theories or the more interpretative \nindividualism of political psychology.  It is the logical operationalisation of the assumption that \nindividuals and\/or their mental features can be considered in isolation.  Insofar as the link we have \nmade to certain debates in social theory suggests the need to be cautious on this, what does this \nimply for the method itself?  Certainly there need be no automatic association between \nmethodological or ontological individualism and quantitative methods, and while quantitative \npolling methods have a natural affinity with aggregative approaches (since both prioritise the \nnumerical) this association could in principle be weakened.\n19\n  The polling method might be used \nwith a view not so much to revealing what are taken to be the respondents\u2019 context-independent \npreferences, beliefs or values, but so as simply to explore what responses they are prone to give to \nWHITE \n 20 \nparticular questions, and how these correlate with other responses or behavioural tendencies.  The \nmethod can also be used to seek such patterns at a collective level, thus bypassing the problem of \nunstable dispositions at the individual level (Page and Shapiro 1992).  One does not have to \nassume, in other words, that the propositions on which answers are given correspond to discrete \nidea-elements in the heads of respondents. \nHowever, not only would the necessity of such a move probably be disputed by most \nscholars in political psychology, but there are problems with the polling method which are not \neasily overcome.  Survey questionnaires have justifiably been criticised as instruments of power, in \nthe sense that they presuppose which are the important questions to be asked, and may indicate to \nthe respondent what an appropriate answer might be.  They also remove from the researcher\u2019s \nview much of the most interesting material \u2013 the process of engagement with a question, the \nmeanings attributed to its vocabulary, the hesitations, the indifference, the side-comments, \ndiscussion with others, and variation in discussion across contexts.  Opinion polls and related \nquantitative approaches are not designed to study contextual interaction; quite the contrary, the \npoint of using polls is usually to neutralise the importance of situational cues and thereby get at the \nsupposed pre-interactional attitude, belief (etc.) as directly as possible.  Furthermore, aggregative \napproaches based on opinion polling can be insensitive to differences in the relative importance of \ndifferent political issue areas, and to differences in the relative importance of the opinions of \ndifferent individuals or groups (for famous critiques, see (Blumer 1948; Wright Mills 1940; Taylor \n1994; Bourdieu 1979; Adorno 2005)).  Whilst innovations in method \u2013 including the use of pre-\npoll interviews \u2013 can to some extent alleviate the first of these blind-spots, the second is bound up \nin the logic of random sampling, the point of which is to be blind to such differences.  This may \nindicate a need to move away from strong reliance on numbers-based research methods based on \nthe aggregation of individual units. \nOne of the standard defences given of opinion polling is that, for all its faults, it still \nusefully mirrors the mechanisms which are employed as part of the democratic process to \u2018capture \nWHITE \n 21 \npublic opinion\u2019: electoral voting and referenda.  These latter are also based on the principle of \naggregation and the secrecy of ballot, and those who criticise polling are therefore close to \ncriticising the democratic process itself.  There is indeed some truth in the idea that the two are \nlinked: one can plausibly imagine that, in liberal democracies, a certain conception of public \nopinion is reified so as to give meaning to the idea of popular sovereignty, and that polling is \nembraced as another means to lend solidity to this.  Hence what Blumer called \u2018the narrow \noperationalist position that public opinion consists of what public opinion polls poll.\u2019 (Blumer \n1948, p.543)  And for as long as this conception of public opinion remains institutionalised in \ndemocratic voting arrangements, opinion polls undoubtedly will be important tools of research.  \nHowever, even if one sets aside their normative role in sedimenting what is ultimately a \nproblematic conception of public opinion, they should not be accorded a special status, not least \nsince they are erratic as predictors of political behaviour and since their findings may be of \nambiguous significance.  To pick one example, in March 2005 the polling organisation \nEurobarometer released figures suggesting that 48% of the French population and 63% of the \nDutch population were in favour of the EU Constitutional Treaty, with 17% and 11% against it \nrespectively.  It moreover suggested that these high levels of support corresponded to a high level \nof knowledge about the Treaty, with the populations of both countries featuring in the top five of \nthe EU-25 on this measure (Eurobarometer 2005).  The results of the referenda a few months later \nwere rather different of course: 55% of the French vote and 62% of the Dutch was against.  \nAlthough it is quite possible that \u2018public opinion\u2019 changed rapidly in the intervening months, or \nthat the referenda themselves failed to capture that opinion, both possibilities raise strong questions \nabout exactly what it is that is captured at any one moment and aggregated.   \nShifting away from the purely mentalist perspective points to a number of possible \nalternative research methods.  Emerging predominantly from the intersubjectivist tradition, \n\u2018deliberative polls\u2019 and citizens\u2019 juries, in which participants are convened in a group environment \nand provided with informational resources with which to enrich a debate about policy proposals, \nWHITE \n 22 \nare a well known and promising substitute for individual polling, even if one remains ambivalent \non whether rational consensus can or should be the expected outcome of such exercises.\n20\n  There \nare also a number of interesting possibilities for studying, more in the text- and practice-oriented \ntradition, the ideational resources available in a given society, how people engage with and adapt \nthese, and what the political implications may be.  Group discussions again provide a useful \nsetting: in contrast to one-to-one interviews, the role of the individual interviewee\u2019s whimsy in \nsetting the course of discussion may be curtailed, since each is accountable to others for what they \nchoose to talk about, and that which is collectively deemed inconsequential is likely to be drowned \nout in discussion.\n21\n  Group discussions, both convened and naturally occurring, provide the \nopportunity to examine what ideas are invoked spontaneously by participants in the absence of a \nstructured questionnaire, and how these are handled and interpreted in mutual coordination.\n22\n  This \nthen enables the application of a range of analytical techniques.  Frame analysis and discourse \nanalysis can be used to look at the ideational tropes or \u2018interpretative repertoires\u2019 which enable and \nconstrain actors in their political discursive practice, at the construction of collective subjects, and \nat a range of acts of legitimisation and delegitimisation.\n23\n  Drawing on cultural sociology, the study \nof \u2018symbolic boundaries\u2019 provides a further perspective from which to analyse how the routinised \ninvocation of ideational resources can produce collective subjects of political significance (Lamont \nand Moln\u00e1r 2002).  Modes of justification represent another important subject of enquiry, for \nwhich the work of social theorists Luc Boltanski and Laurent Th\u00e9venot is of particular relevance.  \nFollowing their exposition of the different \u2018orders of worth\u2019 by the logic of which justificatory \narguments can be made, and on which some degree of tacit agreement is required in order for \nconflicts of opinion to be adjudicated, one may explore how these are invoked in the \nconversational context (Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot 1999; Lamont and Th\u00e9venot 2000).\n24\n  For all such \ntopics of analysis, which become of particular significance as one shifts away from a focus on the \nindividual mind to sites of social activity, the study of group environments is superior to the use of \nsurvey questionnaires. \nWHITE \n 23 \nIn addition to the study of artificially convened discussions, participant observation \nrepresents a valuable research method because it allows the researcher to explore not just political \nengagement but political withdrawal, and the sense in which this is pursued.  In the context of a \ndownward trend in voting turnouts across western democracies, this focus on how the practices of \neveryday life may carry depoliticising effects seems of particular significance, and is a question on \nwhich conventional research methods are weak because they immediately direct the respondents\u2019 \nattention towards matters political.  Nina Eliasoph provides an impressive demonstration of the \napplication of participant observation in her study Avoiding Politics, exploring how, in certain \nsocial situations, norms of etiquette are used to render inappropriate the discussion of political \ntopics.  Furthermore, invoking Erving Goffman\u2019s distinction between \u2018frontstage\u2019 and \u2018backstage\u2019, \nshe explores how people in private contexts may feel fully able to articulate collective interests \nwhilst in public contexts may feel constrained to adopt the more parochial language of a particular \n\u2018identity\u2019.  Her approach highlights the importance of social norms for understanding how political \nparticipation emerges or fails to emerge, yet by looking at how these norms vary across contexts \nand how they rely on individual choices for their maintenance, she avoids resurrecting the passive \nfigure of homo sociologicus (Eliasoph 1998) (Cf. (Cramer Walsh 2004)). \n \nWhile acknowledging the insights such approaches can produce, some scholars trained in \nquantitative methods will no doubt retain concerns about the scientific status of such findings.  It \nmay be suggested that while qualitative research of this kind can lead to interesting new ideas and \ntheories, ultimately it falls to quantitative approaches to establish their genuine significance, thus \npointing to a methodological division of labour between qualitative \u2018discovery\u2019 and quantitative \n\u2018verification\u2019.  Perhaps those sympathetic to Popper\u2019s critique of early positivism will prefer to \nspeak of falsification rather than verification, but the implication would be much the same.  In \nresponse, many qualitative researchers might argue that such a separation of tasks is not easy to \nmaintain, even if one accepts the objectivist perspective implied.\n25\n  Their commitment to studying \nWHITE \n 24 \nmeaning in context is not easily replicated using quantitative methods such as opinion polls, since \nthe very attraction of the latter is that they allow the rapid accumulation of data without recourse to \nclose observation.  What is \u2018verified\u2019 or \u2018falsified\u2019 may therefore not be the same as that which \nwas \u2018discovered\u2019 by alternative methods, and many questions of interest to qualitative researchers \nrelating to important but abstract concepts such as power may resist the formal \u2018operationalisation\u2019 \nrequired by verificatory quantitative research.  The matter is complicated further by the fact that \nmany qualitative researchers will be sympathetic to Quine\u2019s suggestion that theories are under-\ndetermined by empirical data (i.e. that the implications of new findings are never clear-cut) and \ntherefore that strict notions of verification or falsification are misleading (Quine 1951). \nRather than a division of labour which sees quantitative methods as the underpinning of the \nscientific enterprise, arguably what is needed is a variety of approaches whose findings are then \nplaced in dialogue.  Insofar as text- and practice-oriented theoretical approaches abandon an ideal-\nlanguage perspective and a search for the one true description as the purpose of scientific research, \nthey do point to a certain pragmatism and pluralism, discouraging the researcher from a \nmethodologically missionary stance which seeks to convert all scholars to a single approach.  \nMethods should be judged then not according to which corresponds unambiguously to \u2018the facts\u2019, \nor according to their capacity to test a theory conclusively, but according to the types of research \nproject they make possible and the extent to which they offer new ways of conceiving and tackling \nresearch problems.  Quantitative methods will retain important uses, such as to study declarations \nof voting intention (as above) or levels of knowledge on a specific topic, and adherents of \nquantitative and qualitative methods will benefit from a disposition of mutual curiosity.  Just as \ndismissal of competing methods is ill-advised, so there is little to be gained from the veneration of \na particular method, styling oneself e.g. a \u2018frame analyst\u2019 as opposed to a \u2018discourse analyst\u2019, as \nthough such terms each implied a clear, distinct and settled activity.  Such fields should instead be \ntreated as providing useful indications of how relevant research might be undertaken, to be \nWHITE \n 25 \nengaged with rather than blindly followed.  In the words of Alexander Pope, \u2018fools admire, but \nmen of sense approve\u2019 (Pope 1973 Part II, l.190).   \n \n \nA Few Enduring Problems \n \nBy making a connection between empirical social science in the field of mass politics and a \nnumber of debates in social theory, the previous sections have underlined the larger significance of \nsome of the theoretical and methodological choices researchers need to make, and have indicated \nwhere a reappraisal of approaches may be necessary.  At the end of a chain of approaches, as if in \nthe position of ultimate insight, we have placed the text- and practice-oriented strands of a wider \n\u2018interpretative turn\u2019.  The attraction of these approaches lies in the opportunities they provide for \nsidestepping the slide into voluntarism or determinism, in their willingness to seek the symbolic \nworld in observable rather than cognitive phenomena, and in their avoidance of a reduction of \nlanguage to the medium of conscious communication, focusing instead on its unintended and tacit \naspects, and the political effects of these.  But so as to dispel the implication that these approaches \nmark the end of theoretical debate, it may be as well to examine some of the challenges which they \nleave remaining. \n Abandoning the notion of an ideal representational language reaffirms the embeddedness of \nthe researcher in the social world \u2013 a principle which has become a familiar one in contemporary \nsocial science.  In contrast to a certain reading of the science of physics, the researcher is not \nassumed to be the detached observer of facts.  An alternative perspective presents new challenges \nhowever.  Consider for example the empirical question of how one might go about identifying a \n\u2018discursive resource\u2019 or a \u2018practice\u2019 with a view to assessing its political implications.  The \nresearcher needs to balance two competing demands: there is the need on the one hand to be \nsufficiently alien to the subject matter in question so as to be \u2018struck\u2019 by its distinctive features (the \nWHITE \n 26 \ndanger being that the researcher takes these for granted just like the actors themselves, and is \ntherefore unable to discern and analyse them) and yet there is the need also to be sufficiently \nembedded in the subject matter as to be able to interpret and make sense of what is found.  It is \npossible to alleviate the one danger (e.g. by conducting research in locations where one is \n\u2018culturally foreign\u2019) only by accentuating the other, and either such move will have implications \nfor the number and the kind of resources and practices considered worthy of record (Turner 1994, \npp.19-24).  Moreover, the extent to which these competing demands have been successfully \nbalanced is not something which the researcher is in a position to assess: ultimately this judgement \nmust fall to the research community as a whole, whose members he or she must seek to persuade. \n This raises the matter of by what criteria superior and inferior accounts of the social world \nare to be distinguished.  If one conceives the researcher as an interpreting actor who depends on \nskills of perception and sense-making, and the research community as second-order interpreters, \nthere may be difficulties in relying purely on naturalist notions such as intersubjective reliability.  \nCertainly there may be cases where studies and findings can be usefully replicated by secondary \nresearchers, but there may also be cases where interpretations are contestable and where the desire \nfor scientific consensus would restrict insights to the level of the banal.  Nor can the coherence of a \nrepresentation be treated as an indicator of its superiority, since many cultural ensembles will \ninclude contradictory elements that no sophisticated account may ignore (Geertz 1973).  A more \nplausible argument, as concerns text- and practice-oriented approaches, holds that the mark of a \nhigh-quality reading of the social world is that it opens up new ways of posing and engaging with \nresearch problems.  It makes convincing sense of the empirical material at hand, and in addition its \nmethods and concepts show themselves promising, perhaps with some amendment, for application \nto new sets of material.  Often it will draw further credibility by resonating with the findings \nachieved by other methods, and thus may usefully be probed with these, even if not confirmed or \nrefuted.  Ultimately, the study\u2019s success in achieving sustained support from a reflexive audience \nis also like to be important (Kratochwil 2007).  But these points notwithstanding, taking \nWHITE \n 27 \nhermeneutical ideas seriously does mean accepting that to demonstrate a given reading\u2019s \nsuperiority beyond reasonable dissent may not be possible, and therefore that disputes about its \ncontribution may be ongoing. \nThe researcher who wants to make claims for the wider significance of her findings will \nalso face the challenge of how best to think of the empirical data she draws out: as embedded in a \nlarger grammatical structure (a parole embedded in a langue, in Saussure\u2019s terminology), or as \nsimply one of several utterances or practices bearing a resemblance to one another but not \nstructured by a larger whole?  If the former, then how does one study grammatical structures when \nall one can access are particular utterances \u2013 how does one derive the nature of the category from \nthe item? \u2013 and how does one give these verbal rendition?  If the latter then what is it that allows a \nconnection between utterances to be made; how does one generalise one\u2019s findings?  Many \ndiscourse analysts and practice theorists describe themselves as post-structuralist and reject the \nidea of grammars (Potter and Wetherell 1987, p.173; Davies and Harr\u00e9 1990).  Whilst this is a \ncoherent perspective, it makes difficult something which can often be of great interest in the \nanalysis of any given empirical situation: that is, consideration not just of what was said or done \nbut of what was not said or done, yet might well have been given the patterns of action culturally \nfamiliar to the relevant actors.  When Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot adopt the term \u2018grammars of worth\u2019, \nit is precisely this possibility which they enable, albeit at the risk of reifying structure once more.    \nNext, one may need to think about the extension of the repertoires and practices one \nidentifies, i.e. how best to describe the set of people who take them up.  Here one encounters the \nold problem of \u2018groupism\u2019, whereby one is tempted to infer arbitrarily that the boundaries of the \ncircle of repertoire-users correspond to the boundaries of a recognisable group.  The problem is \nmore fundamental than methodological nationalism (Chernilo 2006), since it arises with regard to \nunits other than the nation, whether it be cities, ethnic groups, professions, or sexes.  Clearly one \nwants to avoid linking the use of particular discursive repertoires with a pre-defined collectivity, \nboth because a neat overlap of this kind is empirically implausible and because for normative \nWHITE \n 28 \nreasons one wants to avoid arriving at a perspective which does not allow for the possibility that \nindividuals may renounce some of the patterns with which they are confronted.  To some extent it \nmay be possible to circumvent the difficulty by means of careful phrasing of research goals and \nconclusions, so that one studies for instance the uneven territorial distribution and \u2018availability\u2019 of \ndiscourses and practices rather than their adhesion to particular social groups (Lamont and \nTh\u00e9venot 2000, pp.6-9).  It is likely though that language itself makes some kind of problem \nunavoidable, since whatever noun ones uses to describe the participants to an empirical study will \nimply some act of inference to a larger population.  A combination of cautiously phrased and \nconsistently problematised generalisations probably represents the most sensible means by which \nto continue empirical research in the face of this challenge. \nFinally, while a focus on the social rather than the individual or the societal may allow one \nto avoid binary thinking on the structure-agency problem, the problem itself does not fully \ndisappear.  Swidler\u2019s suggestion that culture be understood as a \u2018toolkit\u2019 represents a move away \nfrom the social determinism associated with seeing culture as determinative of values.  Humans \ncan be understood then as active \u2018problem-solvers\u2019 rather than as passive bearers of structure, but \nwithout sliding to the polar extreme of the radically autonomous individual since they work within \nthe constraints of their inherited cultural resources.  Similar considerations are undoubtedly behind \nseveral of the approaches we have considered.\n26\n  Yet arguably none of these approaches is able to \ngive a satisfactory account of how such a process of strategic choice between possible lines of \naction works.  In particular, there is a danger that, in presenting actors as consciously able to select \ndifferent frames, resources or repertoires of action according to whatever goals they wish to \nrealise, one reverts on the one hand to means-ends rationality and a disembedding of the actor, and \non the other one resurrects the idea of a meta-language in which competing options are constituted, \nevaluated and selected.\n27\n  One risks sacrificing the possibility that the cultural configurations of \nwhich people are a part shape their motivations and attachments to certain goals more than they, as \n\u2018toolkit users\u2019, are able to say.  These difficulties can be avoided if one abandons the attempt at \nWHITE \n 29 \ncausal explanation, which is at the heart of the structure-agency problem, but it is a move which \nmany are naturally reluctant to make. \nDrawing these strands together, one sees the extent to which future work in the field of \nmass politics needs to remain connected to social-theoretical debates.  Neither a retreat to na\u00efve \nempiricism, nor a conscious limitation of the research agenda to those topics deemed susceptible to \nnaturalist approaches, are adequate means by which to escape these challenges.  On the contrary, \nthere is a sense in which empirical researchers are particularly well-placed to contribute to the \nadvance of these debates, since the challenges emerge most sharply in the context of practical \nresearch problems.  Theoretical debates are usefully disciplined by the experiential knowledge of \nseasoned researchers.  Yet such an outcome requires continued theoretical self-awareness.  What \none takes to be a research problem depends itself on one\u2019s theoretical presuppositions, and there \nshould be no expectation of general principles of good method that can be applied mechanically \nwithout sensitivity to broader questions of the kind discussed.   \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe general aim of this paper has been to point to some of the arguments with which researchers in \nthe field of mass politics may enrich the consideration and justification of their theoretical and \nmethodological choices.  This has been coupled with the more specific aim of offering a corrective \nto the dominance of certain approaches.  The suggestion has been that too much work in this field \nis weakly attentive to the significance of how people interpret the political world, while to the \nextent this question is explored it tends to be from a strongly individualist perspective.  Given that \nthe arguments for doing so are inconclusive, new lines of research are needed.  In particular, text- \nand practice-oriented approaches promise to cast light on the routinised, taken-for-granted aspects \nof human action which other perspectives generally exclude from view or which they solidify as \nWHITE \n 30 \nlaw-like norms, and may therefore at the very least be a valuable complement to the growing \nintersubjectivist literature associated with deliberative democracy and the widely popular \nmentalism of mainstream political psychology.  The emphasis of text- and practice-oriented \napproaches on the in-depth study of meaning and action in context makes them particularly \nsensitive to the combined influence of cultural inheritance and individual creativity, that realm of \nthe social which tends to be badly captured in existing accounts.  Yet these new approaches will \nequally need to be handled with a good level of theoretical attentiveness, for they raise distinctive \nchallenges of their own.  In the study of mass politics in particular, where the organising concept \nof \u2018the people\u2019 is especially open-ended in meaning, empiricists must be theorists as well, for \nconceptual choices continue to present themselves.  Without wanting to downplay the normative-\npolitical character of these, it is likely that debates in social theory can be an important point of \norientation. \n \n \n                                                 \n \nEndnotes \n \n1\n A better term may therefore be lay politics, expressing the contrast to politics as a professionalised activity, but for \nreasons of brevity the more familiar vocabulary is used here. \n2\n The work of Marx and Weber contributes to both traditions.  We may set aside those \u2018naturalist\u2019 theories that see \nsocial structure in terms of social density (following the early Durkheim) or social \u2018forms\u2019 (following Simmel).  \n3\n See e.g. (Fuchs and Klingemann 2000; Ester et al. 1993), works in the tradition pioneered by (Inglehart 1977).  \n4\n E.g. (Lipset 1959; Verba and Nie 1972).  On \u2018thick\u2019 and \u2018thin\u2019 versions of rational choice, with their varying degrees \nof emphasis on the purely material world, see the overview in (Green and Shapiro 1994)  In common with all \ntraditions, rational choice is not a bounded entity, and in its more interpretative forms \u2013 where \u2018attitudes\u2019, \u2018beliefs\u2019 and \n\u2018reasons\u2019 are prominent \u2013 it merges with the mentalist approaches discussed later in this paper. \n5\n For defence of a pluralist standpoint, see (Fay 1996; Fay and Moon 1977). \n6\n For further discussion of the interpretative turn in social theorising, see (Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot 2006; Reckwitz \n2002; Sewell 1992; Hollis 1994; Taylor 1994).  \nWHITE \n 31 \n                                                                                                                                            \n7\n Early practitioners sometimes referred to themselves as \u2018political behaviouralists\u2019; however, for the purposes of this \npaper we shall consider their work a variation of political psychology, albeit one of the most central ones.  Political \npsychology has diversified somewhat in recent years \u2013 for an account which emphasises its pluralism see (Sullivan et \nal. 2002). \n8\n There are exceptions to this pattern of strong individualism in political psychology, notably where scholars draw on \nneighbouring disciplines such as social psychology and communications: e.g. (Iyengar 1991).  \n9\n For good reason these are sometimes treated as distinct approaches (Reckwitz 2002; Schatzki 2001; Neumann 2002)  \nHowever, while it is true that one version of textualism \u2013 the French structuralist kind associated with Saussure and \nL\u00e9vi-Strauss, which emphasises strongly determinative discourses at a macro level \u2013 is quite singular in its approach, \nfor reasons of brevity, and in recognition of the common strand which the work of the later Wittgenstein represents, \none may group practice-oriented theories with Anglo-Saxon textualist approaches, while acknowledging their \ndifferences on the centrality of language and the importance of non-propositional knowledge (cf. below).   \n10\n Harold Garfinkel\u2019s ethnomethodology has been another important influence, as has discourse theory, emerging from \npost-structuralism and the language philosophy of the later Wittgenstein \u2013 an overview is (Howarth and Torfing 2005). \n11\n Before then, political psychology might have developed in a number of directions, perhaps following the more \nstrongly interpretative approach of Robert E. Lane (Lane 1962). \n12\n The metaphor of the \u2018frame\u2019 is an interesting one: it asks us to think of the objects towards which attitudes are \nformed as being analogous to pictures, and contextual factors as analogous to the picture-frame and the picture\u2019s \nsetting more generally (neighbouring pictures, the play of sunlight, the art gallery itself, and so on).  In the view of art \nwhich the metaphor asks us to take up, there is a correct picture-frame, a correct set of neighbouring pictures, a correct \nplay of sunlight, a correct art gallery, etc., and all other variations can only be treated as distortions.  This conception \nof art is not widely held, and raises doubts about the analogous conception of politics. \n13\n Arguably one of the weaknesses of structuralist textualism (see fnt. 9) is exactly that, by radically diminishing the \nrole of the individual mind, it points to a closed symbolic system with little space for agency and change. \n14\n That the society-individual dualism is problematic has been long observed, yet from many social-theoretical \nperspectives it is hard to shake off (cf. (Dewey 1927, p.191; Schatzki 1996, chap. 1).  For a call to focus on the social \nrather than the individual or the societal, see (Barnes 2001, p.24). \n15\n Cf. the \u2018duality of structure\u2019 (Giddens 1984). \n16\n For the different positions taken by Habermas on these definitional questions, see (Cooke 2003).  Deliberative \ndemocracy, it should be acknowledged, has become a pluralised set of approaches and some of these emphasise the \nWHITE \n 32 \n                                                                                                                                            \nnon-necessity of consensus and the embeddedness of the reasoning process (c.f. (Dryzek 2000) chap. 3), but one may \ntake the Habermasian approach still to represent the core of the intersubjectivist approach. \n17\n The same argument can be made of non-discursive kinds of social practice, or \u2013 as textualists might prefer \u2013 other \nkinds of social practice can be understood as languages too. \n18\n Of course, identifying relevant assumptions requires interpretation.  Analysis of this kind is no more a neutral \nexercise than any other form of empirical research \u2013 but it is better grounded than that which relies on hypothesising \nabout invisible states of consciousness.  Cf. (Barnes 2001; Swidler 2001a) \n19\n (Sanders 1999).  Note also Lane\u2019s use of interview methods.  \n20\n For a review of the empirical work see (Delli Carpini et al. 2004; Luskin et al. 2002; Conover et al. 2002)  \nHighlighting the potential relevance of a quantitative technique, see (Dryzek 1990) on Q methodology. \n21\n On the group-interview method, see (Morgan 1997; Bloor et al. 2001)  \n22\n See e.g. (Meinhof 2004). \n23\n Applying frame analysis to everyday discussion, see (Gamson 1992).  For empirical discourse analysis, see (Potter \nand Wetherell 1987) \n24\n Studying the logics of justification invoked in discussion of political problems, see (Perrin 2006)  Looking at the \nmanagement of conflict in discussion, (Duchesne and Haegel 2007)  Note also the older idea of \u2018vocabularies of \nmotives\u2019, understood as the (partly situation-specific) motives attributed to the self and others (Wright Mills 1940). \n25\n For some discussion of the various meanings of \u2018qualitative research\u2019, and the problems of equating it with \u2018small \nN\u2019 research, see (Yanow and Schwartz-Shea 2006, Introduction). \n26\n Discourse analysts vary on this question, depending on whether they locate power in the discourse or its \nmanipulators, but Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot are explicitly sensitive to the selection of orders of worth, and Harr\u00e9 and \nDavies indicate \u2018at least a possibility of notional choice\u2019 (Davies and Harr\u00e9 1990, p.45). \n27\n For some discussion, see (Swidler 2001b, pp.24ff.). \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAdorno, Theodor W. 2005. \u201cOpinion Research and Publicness; translated by Andrew J.
