Ice-sheet models (ISMs) developed to simulate the behaviour of continental-scale ice sheets\nunder past, present or future climate scenarios are subject to a number of uncertainties from various\nsources. These sources include the conceptualization of the ISM and the degree of abstraction and\nparameterizations of processes such as ice dynamics and mass balance. The assumption of spatially or\ntemporally constant parameters (such as degree-day factor, atmospheric lapse rate or geothermal heat\nflux) is one example. Additionally, uncertainties in ISM input data such as topography or precipitation\npropagate to the model results. In order to assess and compare the impact of uncertainties from model\nparameters and climate on the GLIMMER ice-sheet model, a parametric uncertainty analysis (PUA) was\nconducted. Parameter variation was deduced from a suite of sensitivity tests, and accuracy information\nwas deduced from input data and the literature. Recorded variation of modelled ice extent across the\nPUA runs was 65% for equilibrium ice sheets. Additionally, the susceptibility of ISM results to modelled\nuncertainty in input topography was assessed. Resulting variations in modelled ice extent in the range\nof 0.8\u20136.6% are comparable to that of ISM parameters such as flow enhancement, basal traction and\ngeothermal heat flux.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate how uncertainty in\nmodelled ice-sheet configurations is affected by a range\nof possible uncertainties in model inputs. In particular,\nwe focus on assessing the influence of uncertainties in\nthe representation of the bed topography in comparison\nwith uncertainties of key mass-balance and ice-dynamic\nparameters input to a three-dimensional thermodynamically\ncoupled ice-sheet model (ISM). We do this by carrying\nout parametric uncertainty analysis on these parameters, as\nwell as applying modelled uncertainty to digital elevation\nmodels (DEMs) of an ice-sheet bed. Since our aim is to\nexplore and compare uncertainty as a function of these\nparameters, model runs were carried out using a steady-\nstate climate. The model runs explore ice-sheet extents and\nvolumes in Fennoscandia, withmass balances approximately\nin line with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However,\nwe emphasize that we are primarily concerned with the\ndevelopment of methodologies to assess uncertainties in ISM\nresults rather than the exploration of a particular ice-sheet\nreconstruction.\nUncertainty in ice-sheet models\nUncertainty in ice-sheet models has two main sources.\nFirstly, the modelled ice sheet is a function of the initial\ndecisions made in abstracting the real system to a conceptual\nmodel. By abstracting reality, we are accepting that uncer-\ntainty will be inherent in the results of our model \u2013 users of\nnumerical models will seek to minimalize this. For example a\nmodel which does not consider longitudinal stresses will fail\nto replicate particular aspects of the glacial system. Secondly,\nmodel uncertainty can arise from uncertainties in the in-\nput parameters, such as the choice of parameter values at\nmodel initialization. The first set of uncertainties can only be\nexplored through comparisons of systems that use different\nlevels of abstraction in constructing their model rules. Thus,\nfor example Hubbard and others (2005) showed how the in-\nclusion of longitudinal stresses led to considerable variation\nin modelled ice-sheet extents in Patagonia compared to pre-\nvious results (Hulton and others, 1994, 2002) based around\nmodels using the shallow-ice approximation (Nye, 1957).\nWithin the ice-sheet modelling community, intercompari-\nson experiments have sought to explore the sensitivity of\nmodelled results to differences in implementation (and in\nprinciple abstraction). For example, the European Ice Sheet\nModelling Initiative (EISMINT) experiments (Huybrechts and\nothers, 1996; Payne and others, 2000) explored a variety of\nmodel types and their responses to a range of glaciological\n(e.g. steady-state Greenland ice sheet under present condi-\ntions) and hypothetical experiments (e.g. ice-stream forma-\ntion on a hypothetical symmetric topography). In many\nmodelling fields a similar approach, though motivated by a\ndifferent philosophy, is applied in ensemble modelling. Here,\na variety of models are usually run in parallel and the results\nare weighted to provide a probabilistic forecast (Anderson,\n1996). Such approaches are arguably better suited for use in\npolicy formulation, where the focus of interest is centred on\nrisk estimation (Vaughan and Spouge, 2002).\nIn general, suchmodel intercomparisons allow exploration\nof differences between models for a given scenario, and\nare important in moving models towards a consensus view.\nHowever, since intercomparisons are also often used as a\nbenchmark towards which modellers aim in development,\nthey cannot be said to be a means of quantifying uncertainty.\nAdditionally, sensitivity to \u2018external\u2019 (input) parameters is not\nusually the subject of those intercomparisons, leaving a gap\nin the understanding of uncertainties associated with ice-\nsheet modelling, which we aim to fill. This second set of\nuncertainties, the focus of this paper, can be explored in a\n900 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nvariety of ways. The most common approach employed in\nglaciological modelling is to carry out a sensitivity study.\nIn such studies, all but one parameter are typically held\nconstant whilst the parameter under investigation is varied\nthrough some range, and the response of the modelled\nice sheet is visualized or quantified (e.g. Van de Wal and\nOerlemans, 1994; Fabre and others, 1995; Ritz and others,\n1997; Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999; Purves and Hulton,\n2000; Pattyn, 2003; Essery and Etchevers, 2004). Sensitivity\nstudies are important because they allow modellers to\nquantify which parameters, in isolation, have the greatest\ninfluence on model results. However, since all but the most\ntrivial ice-sheet models are inherently non-linear, it is often\ndifficult to properly quantify uncertainty or allow assignment\nof probabilities to particular outcomes (Van der Veen, 2002).\nParametric uncertainty analysis\nCurrently, despite the increased importance of numerical\nmodelling in policy making, relatively little research has\nexplored ways in which uncertainties might be consistently\ncalculated in individual ice-sheet model results. Parametric\nuncertainty analysis (PUA), where all parameters are varied\ntogether, is one such approach. Marshall and others (2002)\ninvestigated the response of the North America ice sheet\nto a range of parameters, and completed a number of\nsimulations where parameters were varied simultaneously.\nTarasov and Peltier (2004) also explored the response of the\nNorth American ice sheet during the LGM to simultaneous\nvariations in a range of parameters, whilst geophysically\nconstraining the modelled ice extents. However, in both\nthese experiments the variation of parameter values appears\nto have been based on a limited variation of parameter\nvalues over a predefined range. Such approaches allow the\nrange of potential model responses to input parameters to\nbe estimated, but these responses are not associated with\nprobabilities.\nVaughan and Spouge (2002) carried out a full paramet-\nric uncertainty analysis of future ice-sheet mass balance for\nthe Greenland ice sheet using parameterizations of accumu-\nlation and ablation. A key difference in this approach is that\nprobability density functions (PDFs) are estimated for each\nparameter, and used in themodel runs to allow calculation of\na final PDF for a chosen model output parameter. PDFs are,\nin general, used to associate a probability with a certain par-\nameter value or model outcome. For example using a normal\ndistribution as a PDF, values close to themean are more likely\nto occur than values that deviate more from the mean \u2013 in the\ncase of a normal distribution, 66% of all values are within\none standard deviation of the mean. The advantage of using\nPDFs in parametric uncertainty analysis is that by including\na (realistic) likelihood for a certain parameter value to occur,\nprobabilities can be assigned to model outcomes. This, in\nturn, allows modellers, policy makers and users to identify in\na more meaningful way how each parameter might affect the\nresult, and estimate, for instance, the risk of extreme events.\nTypically, PUA is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation\n(MCS) which is a brute-force technique, where large numbers\nof model runs are normally required to generate an ensemble\nof results from which PDFs can be calculated.\nTopography in ice-sheet models\nIn ice-sheet modelling the bed topography on which models\nare run is generally treated as having no uncertainty\nassociated with it. However, the data used in the generation\nof these bed topographies is often associated with large\nuncertainties, which vary as a function of locale (Hebeler\nand Purves, 2008). Furthermore, the interpolation methods\nused to resample these data to resolutions appropriate for\ntypical ISMs introduce further uncertainties (Hebeler and\nPurves, 2004). Topography, as discussed by Kerr (1993), plays\na key role in influencing ice-sheet behaviour through its\ngeometry, whereby the mass-balance profile is controlled by\nrelief (e.g. through orographic effects) and the topographic\ngeometry (e.g. hypsometry). Topography also influences ice-\nsheet configuration directly by facilitating or constraining\nice flow, for example in a glacial trough (Jamieson and\nothers, 2008). The sensitivity of modelled ice-sheet extents\nto uncertainty in topography is, thus, relevant to furthering\nour understanding of ice sheets, and to refining numerical\nmodels that seek to reconstruct such systems.\nAims\nThe objectives of this paper are, therefore, threefold:\n1. to propose a generalizable set of methods for exploring\nthe parametric uncertainty of ice-sheet model results;\n2. to explore the influence of uncertainty in bed topography\non modelled ice extents and volumes;\n3. to compare the influence of topographic uncertainty to\nother sources of uncertainty (such as climatic or basal\nmodel inputs) on modelled ice extents and volumes.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We\nbriefly introduce the ice-sheet model used in our experi-\nments, before we describe a method for exploring uncer-\ntainty in bed topography. We then review the parameters\nand associated PDFs derived for the parametric uncertainty\nexperiments. The results of the experiments are presented as\nplots of ice extent and volume through time and by visualiza-\ntions of ice extent and volume from ice sheets in equilibrium,\nusing probability maps. Additionally histograms of the asso-\nciated PDFs are given. Finally, we discuss the significance\nof the results and their implications for those constructing,\nusing and interpreting ice-sheet models.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe GLIMMER ice-sheet model\nPhysical laws relating to the dynamics of glaciers have\nlong been incorporated into numerical models of ice flow,\nin order to make predictions about past, present and\nfuture ice-sheet behaviour (e.g. Hulton and others, 1994;\nOerlemans and others, 1998; Huybrechts and Le Meur,\n1999). We aim to test how uncertainty in various model input\nparameters can affect the results of such ice-sheet models.\nTo achieve this, we employ the community ice-sheet model\nGLIMMER (General Land Ice Model for Multiply Enabled\nRegions; Payne, 1999) which builds on the foundations\nlaid down by the modelling studies of Huybrechts (1986),\nBoulton and Payne (1993) and Payne and Dongelmans\n(1997). Ice dynamics calculations implement the shallow-\nice approximation (Hutter, 1983), a widely used approach\nwhich assumes that bedrock and ice surface slopes are small\nenough that normal stress components can be neglected. The\nice flow law parameter is handled by a three-dimensional\nthermomechanical model. A full outline of the numerics\nimplemented in GLIMMER is provided by M.K.M. Hagdorn\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 901\nand others (http:\/\/glimmer.forge.nesc.ac.uk), and Paterson\n(1994) provides additional context to the derivation of these\nmechanics.\nThe ability of a modelled ice sheet to grow and interact\nwith its bed and climate is strongly dependent on basal ice\nvelocities. In GLIMMER, the velocities of the basal ice, vb, at\nany one point are determined as a function of the basal shear\nstress, \u03c4b, and the effective pressure (N = ice overburden\npressure \u2212 basal water pressure) thus:\nvb = k \u03c4\np\nb N\n\u2212q , (1)\nwhere k is a constant describing the thermomechanical prop-\nerties of ice and p and q are positive integers (Paterson,\n1994). The basal slip coefficient, tb (also known as the basal\ntraction parameter), determines the dependence of the\nthermomechanical properties of ice on N and therefore\nassumes that k andN\u2212q can be integrated as a single param-\neter. Equation (1) can therefore be simplified (M.K.M. Hag-\ndorn and others, http:\/\/glimmer.forge.nesc.ac.uk) to:\nvb = tb \u03c4b. (2)\nSliding is assumed to occur when ice temperature at the bed\nreaches pressure-melting point (taking into account both a\nuser-defined geothermal heat flux, Gtherm, and calculated\nfrictional heat contributions), at which point the ice can\ndetach from the bed and begin sliding due to the presence\nof water. Its ability to do so is a function of tb, which is\ncalculated as a linear function of basal melt rate, bmelt:\ntb = min\n(\ntbmax, bsoft + tbslopebmelt\n)\n. (3)\nThe slope of the function is given by tbslope, the softness of\nthe bed is given by a parameter, bsoft, and the basal traction\nis limited from becoming too large by the value of tbmax.\nVariability in the basal traction parameter will therefore alter\nthe behaviour and form of the resulting ice mass.\nAt each time-step, the model requires spatial parameteriz-\nation of surface mass balance and air temperature as inputs.\nWe follow the approach of Jamieson and Sugden (2008)\nto generate these inputs. The distinction between snowfall\n(which only occurs below a given temperature, tsnow) and\nrainfall across the model domain is determined using a posit-\nive degree-day (PDD) model (Reeh, 1991). The PDD\napproach assumes that melt at the ice or land surface is\nproportional to the number of days (integrated through time)\nin which the air temperature, T , rises above freezing point.\nThe number of PDDs is, therefore, proportional to the energy\navailable for melting. Melt, w , is calculated by:\nw = DDF\nyear\u222b\nmax(T , 0) dt , (4)\nwhere DDF is the degree-day factor describing the density\nand albedo of snow or ice (DDF is different for each). The\nmelt calculation further assumes that there is an annual si-\nnusoidal cyclicity (i.e. seasonality) to air temperature, which\nis calculated by taking the mean annual temperature and\nan associated half-range, trange. Further diurnal deviations\nfrom the sinusoidally shifted mean annual temperature are\naccounted for by assuming that this variability has a normal\ndistribution with a standard deviation of 5\u25e6C. The mean\nannual air temperature, MAAT, at the land or ice surface is\ncalculated given a MAAT at sea level which is then adjusted\nto the surface using an atmospheric lapse rate, lrate. The\nmodel also incorporates a firn model to account for the\nfraction, wmax, of melted snow that refreezes to become\nsuperimposed ice. The patterns of precipitation and MAAT\nused as inputs to this model are described under \u2018Climate\nforcing\u2019, below.\nThe Earth can be approximated as a thin elastic layer (the\nlithosphere) that floats above the asthenosphere. GLIMMER\ntreats these two components separately and can do so in\na number of ways. The flexural rigidity of the lithosphere\nis modelled as it responds to changes in load (Lambeck\nand Nakiboglu, 1980). The response of the asthenosphere\nto changes in overburden is modelled so mantle flow\nis approximated over time as an exponentially decaying\nhydrostatic response function (M.K.M. Hagdorn and others,\nhttp:\/\/glimmer.forge.nesc.ac.uk).\nThe model has been tested in the European Ice-Sheet\nModelling Initiative (EISMINT) experiments (Huybrechts and\nothers, 1996; Payne and others, 2000) and it has been\nemployed to gain better understanding of ice dynamics (e.g.\nLe Brocq and others, 2006). Furthermore, it has been used as\na tool to reconstruct ice-sheet configurations over numerous\nregions and time periods (Payne, 1999; Payne and Baldwin,\n1999; Jamieson and Sugden, 2008; Lunt and others, 2008).\nStudy area\nFor our experiments, we use basal topography of Fenno-\nscandia extracted from 30arcsec resolution GLOBE (Global\nLand One-Km Base Elevation) DEM data (http:\/\/www.ngdc.\nnoaa.gov\/mgg\/topo\/globe.html) between 50 and 72\u25e6N and\nbetween 14\u25e6W and 56\u25e6 E. This is merged with ETOPO2\nbathymetric data (http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/mgg\/global) at\n2 arcmin resolution and transformed to Albers equal area\nprojection. Thus the open water-bodies in GLOBE are filled\nby ETOPO2 data, and resampled to 10 km resolution. The\nmodel domain covers an area of 2580 km by 2370km, with\na minimum elevation of \u22123882m and a maximum elevation\nof 1960m.\nClimate forcing\nThe primary objective of the experiments described in\nthis paper is to investigate the influence of uncertainty in\ntopography, climate and model parameters upon modelled\nice-sheet extent and volumes. To this end, we are concerned\nwith generating ice sheets in which parameters are varied\nand which can be compared to a benchmark simulation of\na Fennoscandian ice sheet.\nFor precipitation rates, Climatic Research Unit (CRU;\nhttp:\/\/www.cru.uea.ac.uk) and Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC; http:\/\/www.ipcc-data.org\/) observa-\ntion data of recent climate were used to interpolate a precipi-\ntation scheme (Fig. 1), which can be scaled and varied over\ntime. Notable features are high values of precipitation along\nthe western coastal regions, with the highest precipitation of\n\u223c2.6ma\u22121 occurring in the southwest fjords.\nCRU and IPCC climate data from 30 year observation\nperiods were also used to compile MAAT at sea level for\nthe study area. From this data, latitudinal dependencies were\nderived to construct an input temperature field at sea level\nthat matches the general trends from observation data and\ngets colder with increased latitude. For modelling steady-\nstate ice sheets on Fennoscandia, recent mean temperature\nwas lowered by a constant value over the whole modelling\ndomain (cf. Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999; Forsstro\u00a8m and\nGreve, 2004).\n902 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nFig. 1. Precipitation scheme for Fennoscandia compiled from\npresent-day CRU and IPCC observation data serving as baseline\ninput for the GLIMMER ISM.\nPreliminary sensitivity tests for different temperature and\nprecipitation schemes were run to determine an optimal\nclimate set-up for the DEM uncertainty analysis as well\nas the parametric uncertainty tests. Lowering of present-\nday temperature by 10\u201314 \u25e6C, approximately resembling\nthe cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum (Ritz and\nothers, 1997), proved to produce stable and sensible ice-\nsheet extents.\nDEM uncertainty experiments\nDEMs are subject to uncertainties generated from sources\nsuch as resampling and data accuracy. GLOBE DEM data,\ncommonly used for modelling in Fennoscandia, are known to\ncontain substantial uncertainties originating from numerous\ndata sources, from compilation methods and from meas-\nurement errors. Despite claims as to the need for detailed\nerror models as an integral part of digital elevation data\n(Ehlschlaeger and Goodchild, 1994), common DEMs such\nas GLOBE are distributed with only global error or accur-\nacy figures (Fisher, 1998) as described by the root-mean-\nsquared error, rmse (D.A. Hastings and others, http:\/\/www.\nngdc.noaa.gov\/mgg\/topo\/globe.html). These global accuracy\nfigures have proven unrealistic and are of limited use as they\nlack information on the spatial distribution of error which is\noften spatially correlated with topographic attributes such as\naltitude or slope (Holmes and others, 2000; Oksanen and\nSarjakoski, 2005).\nTherefore, in order to realistically model DEM uncertainty\nincluding spatial dependencies, higher-order reference data\nare necessary where no explicit error model exists. Because\nof the limited availability of such reference data for large\nregions of Fennoscandia, a model to simulate GLOBE DEM\nuncertainty has been developed (Hebeler and Purves, in\npress a,b). This model assesses GLOBE DEM error properties\nover a number of mountainous regions where higher-order\nreference data (A. Jarvis and others, Shuttle Radar Topog-\nraphy Mission (SRTM), http:\/\/srtm.csi.cgiar.org) are available.\nUsing these regions, characteristics of error magnitude and\nspatial configuration, including their correlation with DEM\ncharacteristics such as elevation, slope and roughness, have\nbeen assessed. Analysis showed GLOBE error to be best\nmodelled using deterministic components of uncertainty,\nmodelled using regression, combined with stochastic ele-\nments. While the deterministic components reproduced the\namount and spatial configuration of uncertainty well, the\nstochastic elements allow the produced uncertainty surfaces\nto be used within Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting un-\ncertainty surfaces are essentially surfaces of deviations from\nthe original elevation data in metres, and are added to the\nGLOBE DEM.\nUsing this uncertainty model, derived from areas with\nexisting reference data, a suite of 150 uncertainty surfaces\nat 1 km resolution for Fennoscandia were produced. These\nuncertainty surfaces were then added to the original GLOBE\nDEM, resampled to 10 km and used as input to the GLIMMER\nISM for Monte Carlo simulations, thus allowing assessment\nof the impact of GLOBE DEM uncertainty on ISM results.\nThe baseline model set-up was used in our simulations, with\npresent MAAT lowered by\u221210, \u221212 and \u221214\u25e6C, producing\nthree sets of ISM runs. In order to determine the number\nof runs necessary to obtain stable and reliable results, the\nstandard deviation of modelled ice extent across all model\nruns, and the standard deviation of this standard deviation,\nwere plotted against the increasing number of runs, until both\nmeasures stabilized towards a constant value (Raaflaub and\nCollins, 2006). For each set, the mean and standard deviation\nof modelled ice extent and volume after 30 kyr (model years)\nacross all runs were evaluated, and probability maps (Hunter\nand Goodchild, 1995) were compiled, as a measure of the\nfrequency with which each cell was glaciated across a suite\nof Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) runs.\nParameter sensitivity\nUsing the PDD approach for determining snowmelt in GLIM-\nMER, five parameters influence the temperature forcing.\nThese are the mean annual air temperature at sea level, the\nlatitudinal dependency of temperature, the seasonal vari-\nation of temperature, the atmospheric lapse rate and the\ngeothermal heat flux. Additionally, four parameters influence\nthe ISM via their explicit or implicit dependence on tempera-\nture, namely the degree-day factors for ice and snow, the\nthreshold temperature for precipitation to fall as snow and\nthe meltwater refreezing fraction (Fig. 2).\nThe following parameters were thus selected for initial\nsensitivity testing in order to identify sensible parameter\nranges for PUA:\nMean annual air temperature and latitudinal dependency:\nMAAT\nAtmospheric lapse rate: lrate\nAnnual temperature half-range (seasonal variation): trange\nPrecipitation: precip\nDegree-day factor for ice: DDFice\nDegree-day factor for snow: DDFsnow\nGeothermal heat flux: Gtherm\nThreshold temperature for precipitation to fall as snow:\ntsnow\nMeltwater refreezing fraction: wmax.\nThemodelling of basal water and basal traction can influence\nice-sheet configuration, because of their importance in\ncontrolling basal ice velocities.

Thus,\nthe following three additional parameters were tested, giving\na total of 12:\nFlow enhancement factor: ffac\nIce-thickness threshold for resolving physics: icelimit\nBasal traction rate: btrc.\nThe influence of each of these parameters on mass balance\nand ice dynamics and their interrelations within GLIMMER\nare schematically depicted in Figure 2.\nFor all parameters, initial values, as well as variation\nranges, were derived from the literature and are described\nin detail in the following section. Additionally, for climate\nforcing, variation was derived from uncertainty in the input\ndata (e.g. using differences between CRU and IPCC data)\nand by accounting for uncertainty given in the respective\nmetadata. Using information from the literature along with\ndetails of input data uncertainty and sensitivity, a probability\ndensity function (PDF) was derived for each parameter, to\nbe used in the PUA. For this analysis, a suite of 510 input\nconfigurations for GLIMMER was created, where each of the\n12 parameters listed above was randomly assigned a value\naccording to the corresponding PDF.\nSENSITIVITY TESTS\nIn this section, the sensitivity tests using the selected model\nparameters are presented and discussed, and PDFs to be used\nwithin the PUA are deduced for each parameter.\nParameter ranges and PDFs\nFor each parameter the value range and selection criteria\nused within each sensitivity test are given here. A PDF to be\nused within the PUA for each parameter is deduced using the\ninput criteria as well as the model sensitivity. An overview\nof both the tested parameter range and the resulting model\nsensitivity is given at the end of this section.\nMAAT and latitudinal dependency\nDifferences found between the IPCC and CRU climate\ndatasets used to derive MAATs lie in the range \u22125 to +7\u25e6C.\nThis value range is similar to that reported by Christensen\nand others (1998) for CRU data compared with data from\nthe Danish Meteorological Institute. Using these mapped\ndifferences as a basis, MAATs were varied in steps of 1\u25e6C for\nthe sensitivity tests, spanning a range from 8 to 16\u25e6C cooling\nrelative to present sea-level MAAT. Because the latitudinal\nvariability of temperature is implicitly captured within the\nvariation of MAAT compiled from the CRU and IPCC\nobservations, model sensitivity to latitudinal temperature\ndependency was not explicitly tested and was kept constant\nfor the PUA.\nProbability distribution function for MAAT. Sensitivity\ntests for MAAT (Fig. 3a) revealed that temperature reductions\nof <8\u25e6C prevented any ice growth, because high ablation\nrates prevented ice nucleation at these temperatures. Tem-\nperature decreases of 9\u25e6C resulted in the formation of small\nice caps, but high ablation rates still prevented the formation\nof larger ice sheets. For temperature reductions of >16\u25e6C,\nmodelled ice sheets reached the borders of the modelling\ndomain. Modelled ice extent after 30 kyr shows an almost\nlinear dependency with temperature decreases between 9\nand 16\u25e6C, thus indicating the relatively large influence of\nMAAT on model results within this range.\nThe baseline scenario using a 12\u25e6C reduction from\npresent-day temperature proved to give stable results for\nall parameter variations, so it was chosen as the mean for\nthe MAAT PDF in the PUA. Because the probability of\n904 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\na b\nc d\ne f\ng h\nFig. 3.

Thus,\n95% (the 2-standard-deviation range) of all temperatures lie\nbetween \u22129 and \u221215\u25e6C (Fig. 4a).\nSeasonal temperature variation\nTo account for seasonal variation of air temperature, the\nMAAT imposed on the ISM is altered using a sinusoidal func-\ntion with a default half-range of 9\u25e6C. This corresponds to an\noverall range in yearly mean temperatures of 18\u25e6C, a range\ncharacteristic of present-day maritime and semi-continental\nclimates. According to Christensen and others (1998), cur-\nrent seasonal variation over Scandinavia ranges between 10\nand 20\u25e6C. The seasonal temperature range, however, is\nknown to be strongly dependent on continentality andMAAT,\nand thus can take on higher values for continental locations\nor lower ranges for extremely cold climates. For the initial\nsensitivity testing, seasonal temperature amplitudes between\n3 and 15\u25e6C have therefore been used (Fig. 3b).\nProbability distribution function for trange.

For the baseline approach with a\n12\u25e6C temperature reduction, the variation of the seasonal\ntemperature amplitude exhibited a non-linear dependency\non the modelled ice extent. Because higher seasonal\nvariations are more likely to raise temperatures above\nfreezing, and thus cause ablation during parts of the year\nfor a certain location, elevation threshold effects are likely\nto play a role in the sensitivity results (Hebeler and Purves,\nin press b). Variations in trange of 3\u201311\u25e6C resulted in stable,\nsensible ISM results. While slightly higher variations are still\nsupported by the sensitivity results (Fig. 3b), a half-range of\n<3\u25e6C results in unrealistically large ice-sheet configurations.\nThe seasonal temperature range amplitude was therefore\nvaried according to a normal distribution around a mean of\n9\u25e6C (N[9,2]). This yields a PDFwith the 2-standard-deviation\nrange (95%) between \u223c5 and 13\u25e6C (Fig. 4b).\nLapse rate\nThe input temperature used to force ice-sheet growth is\nthe air temperature at the upper surface. Surface elevation\nis equivalent to the bedrock elevation for ice-free areas\n(for glaciated areas ice thickness is added), and surface\ntemperature is extrapolated from sea-level MAAT using an\natmospheric lapse rate, which is commonly taken to be\n6.5\u25e6Ckm\u22121 (Stone, 1979). However, the moist adiabatic\nlapse rate is subject to seasonal and latitudinal variation\nas well as being dependent on height and atmospheric\nstability, and is suggested to be a better approximation to the\natmospheric lapse rate in the middle and lower troposphere\n(Stone, 1979). The lapse rate also varies with air moisture\ncontent, and increases up to 9.8\u25e6Ckm\u22121 for dry air. For\ncold, high-latitude regions, lapse rates have been shown to\nbe fairly constant and nearly sub-moist adiabatic.\nAir pressure, seasonal variation and temperature\/\nprecipitation dependencies of the lapse rate are not expli-\ncitly considered in our climate forcing. However, variation\nof the lapse rate for the sensitivity testing was chosen to\nreflect the maximum influence that these factors might have\nupon lapse-rate variability. Most models in very cold, dry\nenvironments, such as Antarctica, are generated using lapse\nrates of 7\u20139\u25e6Ckm\u22121 (Thompson and Pollard, 1997; Van der\nVeen, 2002; Jamieson and others, 2008). For their climate\nsimulation, Christensen and others (1998) use a temporally\nvariable lapse rate which ranges between 5 and 6\u25e6Ckm\u22121\nacross the year, and Charbit and others (2002, 2007) apply a\nlapse rate of 8\u25e6Ckm\u22121 for their model of the Fennoscandian\nice sheet. Reeh (1991) suggests a lapse rate of 8\u25e6Ckm\u22121 for\npolar regions. Given the uncertainty regarding appropriate\nlapse rates over different regions, we select the maximum\nand minimum previously used rates of 5\u20139\u25e6Ckm\u22121 for use\nin our sensitivity analysis (Fig. 3c).\nProbability distribution function for lrate. Because of its\ndirect relationship to temperature, modelled ice-sheet extent\nand volume is highly sensitive to lapse rate (Fig. 3c) within\nthe tested parameter range. An increase of the lapse rate\nfrom 5\u25e6Ckm\u22121 to 6.5\u25e6Ckm\u22121 almost doubles ice extent\nand volume, while a further increase to 8\u25e6Ckm\u22121 results in\na smaller-magnitude response. Because of the cold climate\nconditions, the mean lapse rate for our experiment was\n908 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nassumed to be slightly higher than the commonly chosen\nvalue of 6.5\u25e6Ckm\u22121 and was set to 7\u25e6Ckm\u22121. For the\nPUA, a PDF based on a normal distribution around this\nmean of 7\u25e6Ckm\u22121 with a standard deviation of 1\u25e6Ckm\u22121\nwas selected (N[7,1]). The value range deduced from the\nliterature (5\u20139\u25e6Ckm\u22121) is thus covered within the 95%\ninterval of the PDF (Fig. 4c).\nPrecipitation\nThe range and distribution of precipitation derived from\nCRU and IPCC data compare well with those given by\nChristensen and others (1998). However, their reported bias\nof CRU precipitation data compared to observation varies for\ndifferent regions by 15\u201330%. This range was used to derive\nvalues for initial sensitivity tests and served as a basis for\nparametric variation. Precipitation over Fennoscandia ranges\nfrom \u223c0.4 to 2.5ma\u22121, where most regions receive a mean\nof \u223c1m of precipitation. In order to preserve the spatial\nprecipitation scheme, and to avoid unreasonably large\nchanges to areas that had either high or low precipitation,\nprecipitation rates for the sensitivity tests were scaled as a\npercentage of the derived baseline scheme.\nFor the sensitivity test, variations in the range \u221240 to\n+40%, relative to present-day distribution, were applied.\nAs the impact of precipitation is strongly dependent on the\nmean temperature, sensitivity tests were conducted for three\ntemperature scenarios, where recent MAAT was lowered by\n10, 12 and 14\u25e6C, (Fig. 3d\u2013f) , in order to ascertain stable\nmodel runs for combinations of high precipitation rates and\nlow temperatures.\nProbability distribution function for precip. As expected,\nthe impact of varying precipitation proved to be closely\nrelated to MAAT. Scaling of precipitation in the range \u221240\nto +40% showed near-linear dependencies with modelled\nice extent for the \u221210 and \u221212\u25e6C scenarios. For the\n\u221214\u25e6C scenario, the relationship became slightly non-linear,\nresulting in unstable model runs for increases in precipitation\nof >40%, for which ice reached the domain boundaries.\nPerturbing precipitation between \u221240 and +40%, however,\nproduced stable equilibrium results for MAAT lowering\nbetween \u221210 and \u221214\u25e6C. The baseline precipitation was\ntherefore used as the mean precipitation for the PUA PDF,\nand a global value for perturbing precipitation was drawn\nfrom a normal distribution around a mean of 0, with a\nstandard deviation of 15% (N[0,0.15]) (Fig. 4d). This resulted\nin variations of precipitation between \u221230 and +30% in\n95% of all cases. This slightly more conservative range was\nchosen to ensure model stability, while the 15% standard\ndeviation still corresponds well, with a mean deviation of\n20% of the CRU data, for the meteorological observations\nreported by Christensen and others (1998).\nDegree-day factors for ice and snow\nDDFs used for temperature-index modelling have been\nshown to vary for different regions, due to a range of\nfactors such as seasonal and daily temperature amplitude,\nprevailing macroclimate, albedo and continentality. Where\ntemperature-index models are used in glaciological model-\nling, different DDFs are commonly used for ice and snow.\nHock (2003) compiled a list of snow and ice DDFs derived\nfrom a range of regional studies. DDFs for ice were shown\nto vary between 5.4 and 20 mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121, with most val-\nues lying between 6 and 10 mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121. Commonly, an\naverage DDFice of 8 mmd\n\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 is used for modelling ice\nmelt, where DDFs cannot be derived from observations. The\nvalues compiled by Hock (2003) for DDFsnow range from\n2.5 to 11.6mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121, with most values in the interval\n3\u20136mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121.\nFor the sensitivity tests, the DDFs for ice and snow were\nvaried between 6 and 10 mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 and between 3 and\n8 mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121, respectively.\nProbability distribution function for DDFice and DDFsnow .\nAgain, being closely related to temperature, variation of\nthe DDFs has a large influence on the configuration of the\nmodelled ice sheets (Fig. 3g and h). Increasing the DDF for\nsnow from 3mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 to 4mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 results in a\ndecrease of modelled ice-sheet extent and volume by \u223c10%\nin the \u221212\u25e6C scenario.\nFor the parametric uncertainty analysis, the PDF for DDFice\nwas centred around the standard value of 8mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121,\nwhich was used as a mean. A normal distribution with a\nstandard deviation of 1 was used to cover the range identified\nin the literature, of 6\u201310mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 (N[8,1]) within the\n95% interval (Fig. 4e). As the standard value for DDFsnow\nmarks the lower end of the variation range, an exponential\ndistribution was chosen in this case, using a mean, \u03bc, of 1\nfollowing the form\ny = f (x|\u03bc) = 1\n\u03bc\ne\nx\n\u03bc . (5)\nThe default value of 3mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 was added to the\ndistribution, resulting in an effective range from 3 to\n\u223c10mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121 and a mean of 4 mmd\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121, covering\nthe range of values from the literature with decreasing\nprobabilities for extreme values (Fig. 4f).\nGeothermal heat flux\nFor geothermal heat flux, most ice-sheet model experiments\nassume a value of 42mWm\u22122, which is a standard value for\nthe average heat flux of Precambrian shields. However, Pol-\nlack (1982) states that heat flux is dependent on the contin-\nental age and location. Na\u00a8slund and others (2005) have cal-\nculated the average geothermal heat flux to be 49mWm\u22122\nfor the Fennoscandian ice sheet, with regional variations\nranging from 30 to 83mWm\u22122. In their sensitivity tests, Ritz\nand others (1997) also use values of 50 and 60mWm\u22122,\nthe latter being the standard value for continents. Greve and\nHutter (1995) vary the heat flux by \u00b130% in their Green-\nland sensitivity experiments, using values of 29.4, 42 and\n54.6mWm\u22122. For our sensitivity tests, a variation of the geo-\nthermal heat factor of 35\u201365mWm\u22122 was chosen (Fig. 3i).\nProbability distribution function for Gtherm. Ice velocity\ndepends on the geothermal heat flux via the basal melt rates\nand resultant water pressures, which in turn determine rates\nof ice sliding. However, we find that changes in Gtherm have\nnegligible influence on modelled ice extent and volume\n(Fig. 3i). For very cold MAAT, and thus low ice temperatures,\nthe influence of geothermal heat on the thermal regime\nof the ice sheet is relatively small, which may explain the\ninsensitivity to variation of this factor. However preliminary\nsensitivity tests with different temperature set-ups showed\nthat variation of Gtherm within the given range could\ninfluence modelled ice volume, and therefore Gtherm was\nincluded in the PUA, and varied normally around a mean of\n49mWm\u22122 using N[49,7] (Fig. 4g).\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 909\nSnow temperature threshold\nThe threshold temperature, tsnow, below which precipitation\nis assumed to fall as snow, thus contributing to accumulation\nfor mass-balance modelling, varies little in the literature. For\nexample, Fabre and others (1998) and Charbit and others\n(2007) use a threshold of 2\u25e6C and Schneeberger and others\n(2003) use a threshold of 1.5\u25e6C with linear interpolation of\nthe rain\/snow ratio from 0.5 to 2.5\u25e6C. Most other models\nemploy a fixed threshold of 1\u25e6C. Sensitivity testing thus\ncovered this range, between 0.5 and 2.5\u25e6C (Fig. 3j).\nProbability distribution function for tsnow . The influence\nof the air temperature threshold for precipitation to fall as\nsnow is slightly larger on modelled ice volumes than extents.\nFurthermore, we observe non-linear behaviour in our models\ndue to the spatial distribution of precipitation, which results\nin local effects overlying global response patterns. This\nsuggests that variation of the threshold temperature is a\npotentially important factor despite the relatively low overall\nimpact compared to that of MAAT. For the PDF, the standard\nvalue of 1\u25e6C was assumed to have the highest probability. As\nthe upper and lower end of the variation range are physically\nconstrained, and are not symmetric around the mean of 1,\na log\u2013normal distribution (\u03bc = 0.1, \u03c3 = 0.3) was chosen\nfor the PUA, with maxima and minima constrained to 3 and\n0.5, respectively. For simplicity, random values below 0.5\nor above 3 were set to 1, hence the slight peak in the PDF\n(Fig. 4h).\nRefreezing fraction\nThe refreezing fraction, wmax, prescribes the amount of\nmelted snow that refreezes to form superimposed ice. The\ndefault value of 0.6 thus states that the first 60% of snow\nmelted by the potential ablation forms superimposed ice,\nwhile the rest is lost as runoff. The model is designed so that if\npotential ablation is greater than the volume of precipitation\n(as snow), superimposed ice melts first, before the ice itself.\nThe ratio of 0.6 was used in a suite of papers on Greenland\nice sheet modelling in the early 1990s (Huybrechts and\nothers, 1991; ?; Letre\u00b4guilly and others, 1991a). Even though\nsome models and measurements suggest lower values might\nbe appropriate or that no superimposed ice forms (e.g.\nLefebre and others, 2003), a ratio of 0.6 is commonly applied\nin the modelling of large ice sheets. We tested refreezing\nfractions of 0.4\u20130.8 for their impact on ISM results (Fig. 3k).\nProbability distribution function for wmax. The refreezing\nfraction had a considerable influence when varied within\nthe range tested (Fig. 3k), and is an important factor for\nuncertainty analysis. This is because as wmax is applied\nglobally over the model domain, it is uncoupled from\ninfluencing factors such as climate, ice rheology and\ntopography. Within our PUA, the refreezing fraction is\ntherefore varied around the standard value of 0.6 using a\nnormal distribution N[0.6,0.065] (Fig. 4i).\nBasal traction constant\/basal sliding\nIn reality, since basal traction is dependent upon such factors\nas basal hydrology, the presence of deformable sediment\nor bedrock and basal sediment saturation (Jamieson and\nothers, 2008), one global constant is unlikely to represent\nthe different conditions prevailing under an ice sheet. Basal\ntraction specifies the dependence of the thermomechanical\nproperties of ice on effective pressure. By prescribing basal\ntraction as a function of basal melt rate, bmelt, as we do\nhere, spatial variations in the thermal field of the ice sheet\nbecome more gradual than if it were prescribed purely by\nthe presence, or not, of water at the bed. Above a certain\nthreshold of basal melt rate, basal sliding is at a constant\nmaximum in ourmodel. Ritz and others (1997) use a constant\nof 3\u00d710\u22128 m a\u22121 Pa\u22122; Payne (1995) applies a sliding\nmultiplier of 5\u00d710\u22123ma\u22121 Pa\u22121; the standard value of the\nEISMINT experiments is 1\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121 (Payne and\nothers, 2000). Jamieson and others (2008) use basal traction\nconstants of 2\u00d710\u22123 and 5\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121 to explore ice-\nsheet behaviour. For our sensitivity tests, two different ways\nof calculating basal traction were used to test the importance\nof the inclusion of a basal melt rate parameterization. In a\nfirst approach, a constant basal traction value was applied\nwhere basal ice is at the pressure-melting point. This set of\nresults was used to determine the range of basal sliding rates\nto test with the second approach, where basal sliding is a\nfunction of basal meltwater (Equation (3)). In this second\nsensitivity test, both minimum and maximum basal traction\nrates, tbmax, and the slope of the linear relationship between\nmelt rate and basal traction, tbslope, were varied in order to\ndetermine optimal model set-up (e.g. Fig. 3l).\nProbability distribution function for btrc. Changes in\nbasal traction values have a considerable impact on ISM\nresults and behaviour set-up, through their influence on\nmodel stability via velocity calculations. If basal sliding is\nmodelled using a constant where basal ice is at its melting\npoint (e.g. sliding and basal traction are set to either on\nor off), an initial increase from 0.1\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121 to\n1\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121 results in growth of ice volume and\nextent. Increasing the basal traction constant then reduces\nboth volume and extent, and triggers oscillation of the ice-\nsheet margins. This instability is due to the lack of transition\nbetween zero and maximum values of basal sliding, and\nwas identified previously by Payne and Dongelmans (1997).\nFor high basal sliding constants, this on\/off scenario locally\nresults in enhanced ice flow over the base which, in turn,\nresults in a rapid drawdown of ice, which decreases ice\nthicknesses locally. This continues until a thresholdminimum\nice thickness and, in turn, driving stress is reached, whereby\nthe warm streaming features shut down while ice thicknesses\nagain build up, to a state where rapid flow can once\nagain be initialized. Because of these instabilities, very\nhigh basal sliding rates (enabled by high btrc constants) do\nnot lead to increases in overall ice extent. However, the\nimpact of changes in basal traction very much depends\non the method used for handling basal water in the ice\nsheet, and on local bedrock topography. If the basal sliding\nis modelled as a linear function of basal melt rate, with\ntransition zones between areas of maximum and zero sliding,\nthese instabilities are dampened, and the basal traction\nconfiguration has less influence on the modelled ice extent\nand volume (Fig. 3l).\nWhile oscillating behaviour can be found in real ice\nstreams, in ice-sheet models that do not account for\nlongitudinal stresses it is likely to be a numerical artefact,\nespecially where basal traction is uncoupled from basal\nmelt rates (Payne and Baldwin, 2000). As model instabilities,\nwhich are the result of numerical limitations, can influence\nresults, for the PUA a conservative set-up was chosen, using a\n(minimum) basal traction constant of 0.1\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121,\na slope of 0.02 and variation of the maximum basal traction\n910 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nconstant drawn randomly from a log\u2013normal distribution\n(\u03bc = 1e\u221205, \u03c3 = 0.75 (ma\u22121 Pa\u22121)), suitable for covering\nthe wide range of possible values between 0.1\u00d710\u22123 and\n\u223c7\u00d710\u22123 m a\u22121 Pa\u22121 (Fig. 4j).\nFlow enhancement factor\nA flow enhancement factor, ffac, is commonly used as a\ntuning factor. While a standard factor of 1 is often applied\nin ice-sheet models (e.g. Pattyn, 2003), higher factors are\noften used to simulate changes in the physical properties of\nice; for example, Fabre and others (1995) used this factor to\nrepresent layers of softer Weichselian ice in the Greenland\nice sheet. In their sensitivity study of a Greenland ISM, Ritz\nand others (1997) used flow enhancement factors of 1, 3 and\n5, values also used in previous experiments (e.g. Huybrechts\nand others, 1991; Letre\u00b4guilly and others, 1991b; Fabre and\nothers, 1995; Greve and Hutter, 1995). Sensitivity of ice\nextent and volume to flow factors of 0.5\u20135 has therefore been\nexplored in our sensitivity tests (Fig. 3m).\nProbability distribution function for ffac. The sensitivity\ntests showed ice extent to be relatively insensitive to changes\nin flow factor, while the volume varied by up to 10% with\neach 0.5 point change in flow factor (between values of\n0.5 and 1.5), while flow factors >2 have less effect on the\nice volume (Fig. 3m). This effect can be explained by the\nlower viscosity of ice simulated through an increased flow\nenhancement factor. The \u2018softer\u2019 ice thus flows faster to lower\nelevations, where it is ablated, thus preventing the build-up\nof ice at higher elevations. This results in comparable ice\nextent yet decreased volume. Based on these results and the\ncommonly used values for the flow enhancement factor, the\nPDF was chosen to vary around the default value of 1. As\nthe parameter range of the flow factor around this standard\nvalue is asymmetric, a log-normal distribution was chosen\nfor the PUA, with \u03bc = 0.1 and \u03c3 = 0.36. The distribution\nwas limited to a minimum of 0.5 by setting values below 0.5\nto 1, hence the peak in the PDF plot (Fig. 4k).\nIce limit\nFor small ice thicknesses, only minimal deformation will\noccur, so the full thermodynamic equations need not\nbe solved. For computational efficiency, a minimum ice-\nthickness threshold exists in GLIMMER, above which ice\ndynamics are solved. The default limit is 500m, which\ncorresponds to a maximum slope of 2.5% at 20 km resolution\nor 5% at 10 km. Using the shallow-ice approximation, it has\nbeen shown that ISMs become unstable when dealing with\nslopes >10%, corresponding to an ice-thickness change of\n1000m at the resolution of 10 km used in these experiments.\nLowering the threshold results in an increased computational\ndemand for little gain in the predictive ability of the\nmodel because flow rates at very low slopes are negligible.\nSensitivity tests were thus performed using conservative\nthresholds of 200\u2013600m (Fig. 3n).\nProbability distribution function for icelimit . As expec-\nted, changing the ice-limit threshold has little effect on the\nmodelled configuration of ice sheets, while the calculation\ntime significantly increased for low values (up to 30% for\nlimits of 200m instead of the default 500m). However, vari-\nation of the ice limit results in non-linear behaviour, and has\na slightly higher influence on modelled ice volume than on\nextents.\nDespite the limited sensitivity of modelled ice masses to\nthese effects, the ice-limit threshold is nevertheless included\nin the PUA for completeness. As no distribution can be\ndeduced from the literature, and the parameter does not\nrepresent a physical process, a uniform distribution between\n200 and 600m was chosen for the PUA (Fig. 4l).\nResults and discussion of sensitivity tests\nThe sensitivity tests conducted prior to the PUA indicate that\nthe modelled ISM extent and volumes are most sensitive to\ninput parameters that influence mass balance (see Fig. 2;\nTable 1): the tested range of mean annual air temperature\n(Fig. 3a) and seasonal variation in air temperature (Fig. 3b)\nresulted in the largest variations in modelled extent (up\nto 200%) in the sensitivity tests. Up to a 100% change\nwas recorded for variation in precipitation for the \u221212 and\n\u221214\u25e6C scenarios (Fig. 3e and f). The impact of lapse rate\n(Fig. 3c), precipitation at \u221210\u25e6C (Fig. 3d) and the DDFs of\nice and snow (Fig. 3g and h) was in the range 40\u201375%.\nModel parameters that control ice dynamics have less\ninfluence over ice-sheet model results: variation of basal\ntraction (Fig. 3l), the flow enhancement factor (Fig. 3m) and\nthe refreezing factor (Fig. 3k) had an impact on modelled\nice extent of \u223c10\u201320%. Additionally, the variation of both\nthe geothermal heat flux (Fig. 3i) and snow threshold\ntemperature (Fig. 3j) parameters within their tested ranges\nwas found to have limited influence on both modelled\nice extent and volume (\u223c1\u20132%). Varying the ice-thickness\nthreshold (Fig. 3n) for resolving of dynamics had a low to\nmedium non-linear impact on model results, which varied\nby \u223c5%. In general, the impact of changing the above\nparameters is slightly smaller on extent than volume.\nWhile \u2018external\u2019 climate parameters have a greater influ-\nence on ice-sheet configurations, the \u2018internal\u2019 parameters\nthat control ice dynamics can influence model stability, as\nshown by our sensitivity tests for different basal traction con-\nfigurations. The effect these parameters have on model sta-\nbility can be observed when examining ice-sheet behaviour.\nFor example, particular selections of parameter values can\ngenerate oscillations in ice flow. Therefore parameter set-\nups have been chosen that are unlikely to trigger model in-\nstabilities, and because of the use of these more conservative\nvalue ranges, the influence of internal ice-dynamics model\nparameters associated with internal ice dynamics might be\nlow compared to the climate-forcing module.\nWhile the strong influence of climate parameters concurs\nwith previous findings (Huybrechts and deWolde, 1999), the\nsensitivity of modelled ice sheets to some other parameters is\nmore controversial. For instance, Huybrechts and de Wolde\n(1999) found basal melt rates had a large influence on the\nmass balance of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets,\nand melt rates of 10\u201330ma\u22121 have been found for ice\nshelves (Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999; Rignot and\nThomas, 2002). For grounded ice, basal melt rates are heavily\ndetermined by the geothermal heat flux, and high basal\nmelt rates under the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are\nexplained by multiples of the normally assumed fluxes of\n56mWm\u22122. Fahnestock and others (2001) report local basal\nmelt rates of up to 1ma\u22121 for the Greenland ice sheet. In\nour experiments, however, maximum basal melt rates lie in\nthe range 0.5\u20131ma\u22121, and variation of the geothermal heat\nflux showed little impact on modelled ice extent or volume,\nin agreement with the findings of Ritz and others (1997).\nThis inconsistency could be explained by the conservative\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 911\nTable 1.

Another possible explanation is that in\nour model set-ups, ice-thickness variation (and therefore\ntopography) is a dominant factor influencing basal melt rates\nthrough overburden pressure. Because rapid variations in\nice thickness are driving large differences in overburden\npressure, they may overlay the impact of changes in\ngeothermal heat flux. In this case, higher variations in Gtherm\nthan the ones applied in our studies (which we assumed to\nbe unrealistic) would show a greater impact on modelled ice\nextents and volumes.\nOur experiments showed that increasing flow enhance-\nment factors had a considerable effect on reducing modelled\nice volume and, to a lesser amount, ice extent. In contrast,\nRitz and others (1997) found a slight increase in modelled\nice extent for initial increases of the flow factor for their\nGreenland experiments. Similar behaviour can be observed\nfor variation in basal sliding comparing the two sets of exper-\niments. Possible explanations may lie both in the topography\nand the climate configurations. For example, the Greenland\nice-sheet margin positions are not only limited through high\nablation in lower areas, but also by mass transport from\nthe accumulation areas. In this case, the lower ice viscosity\nsimulated by a higher flow factor would allow ice to flow\nfurther without being ablated. The relatively large seasonal\ntemperature variations in our model set-up make it likely for\nan area to experience ablation during some time of the year,\nespecially for lower elevations. Therefore increases in ice\nextent during colder periods of the year may ablate during\nthe summer, and not contribute to the long-term expansion\nof the ice sheet.\nThe baseline parameters and their range examined in our\nsensitivity tests have been carefully compiled. However, both\nparameter ranges and parameter PDFs are approximations or\nare still based on assumptions. The impacts on modelled ice\nextent and volume of varying parameters across the ranges\ngiven in Table 1 are therefore not applicable for a direct\ncomparison with each other or results from other studies.\nNevertheless, the impact and the impact ratio (impact on\nextent\/volume, measured as deviation from the mean in\nper cent) for each parameter can be used to compare the\nrelative influence of each of the factors on ISM results.\nThe derived impact ratio (Table 1) can also be used to\ndetermine whether parameters have a predominant influence\non either modelled ice extent or volume. This is an important\nconsideration in understanding the mechanisms through\nwhich these parameters influence the ISM.\nIn general, the impact ratio of parameter variation on\nmodelled ice extent and volume is \u223c0.8 (Table 1). This\nslightly higher impact of uncertainty on modelled ice volume\ncan be explained by the fact that ice extent is a two-\ndimensional measurement. By contrast, the calculation of\nice volume is three-dimensional and the variation of ice\nthickness is explicitly included. Because of the influence of\ntopographic uncertainty on the calculation of ice thickness,\nits direct impact is likely to be reflected in modelled ice\nvolume. Parameters with a low impact ratio have a greater\ninfluence on modelled ice volume than extent, such as the\nflow enhancement factor and the geothermal heat flux, via\nits influence on basal sliding. Both parameters influence ice\nvelocity, through changes in either ice viscosity or sliding\nbehaviour. Increased ice velocities support the accelerated\nflow of ice to lower elevations, where it is more likely to be\nablated. At the same time, because ice flows away from the\n912 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nFig. 5. Mean (solid curve) and standard deviation (dashed curve) of\nice extent after 30 kyr (model years) across PUA runs plotted against\nnumber of runs. Standard deviation of standard deviation is plotted\nas dashed light-grey curve.\naccumulation areas faster, ice build-up is inhibited. Thus,\nif mass-balance gradients at the edges of the ice mass are\nvery steeply negative (i.e. high ablation rates occur near\nthe equilibrium-line altitude (ELA)) then ice extent may not\nchange significantly with increasing ice velocities. At the\nsame time ice thickness (and thus volume) decreases because\nthe ice transports ice from the accumulation zone to the\nablation zone more rapidly.\nConversely, the maximum basal traction rate and the\nthreshold temperature for precipitation to fall as snow have\nimpact ratios close to 1 (Table 1). This means their influence\non modelled ice extent is larger than on volume, when\ncompared to other parameters. While the overall impact\nof tsnow might be too small to support detailed analysis, it\nis interesting that higher rates of basal traction appear to\nfavour changes in ice extent rather than volume. This is\nopposite to the effect of geothermal heat flux, a parameter\nthat controls basal sliding via its dependence on basal melt.\nOne explanation for this possible contradiction could lie\nin the fact that variation in geothermal heat flux affects\nthe entire ice sheet, resulting in an overall change in the\narea of basal ice at its melting point. Changes in basal\ntraction rate, however, only influence areas that already are\nat the pressure-melting point and are experiencing basal\nsliding. As this phenomenon occurs mostly in stream patterns\nand towards the edges of the ice sheet, where the ELA\nis positioned, changes in ice volume generated by the\nspatial pattern of ice velocity through basal traction may\nbe relatively slow. At the same time, ice extent may be\ninfluenced more strongly through local advances of ice-\nstream outlets, because concentrated patches of thicker ice\ndo not melt away as quickly as homogeneously distributed,\nbut thinner, slow-moving ice advance. However, differences\nin, as well as overall values of, basal traction rate impact\non modelled ice extent and volume are small, which means\nthat small relative changes in model results can have strong\ninfluences on the associated impact ratio.\nIt is interesting to note the observable decrease of the\nimpact ratio (Table 1) for the precipitation variation at\nFig. 6. PDF of modelled ice extent of the parametric uncertainty\nanalysis.\n\u221214\u25e6C. In comparison to the warmer climates tested, the\nimpact upon volume versus extent increases. This may be\ndue to the impact of air temperature on ice temperature\nand thus velocity. For the cold, \u221214\u25e6C, scenario, the\nice-sheet boundary is strongly influenced by (low) ice\nvelocities caused by the low temperatures as well as the\nhigh ice thickness dampening steeper slopes of the bedrock\ntopography. This in turn results in areas of positive mass\nbalance with increasing ice thickness, where ice cannot flow\nto ablation areas, so direct changes in mass balance mainly\nact on ice volume, rather than extent. Effectively, the stiffer,\nslower-flowing ice results in the build-up of a higher ice\ndome than the higher-temperature scenarios.\nPARAMETRIC UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS\nThe mean modelled ice extent and volume across all\n510 ISM runs comprising the PUA stabilized after \u223c200\nruns. However, variance in standard deviations of both extent\nand volume remained high, with>5% difference in standard\ndeviation of modelled ice volume being generated between\nthe 450th and 510th model runs. Analysis of the suite of\nISM runs carried out for the PUA revealed that 6 out of\nthe 510 configurations resulted in unreasonably large ice\nmasses that reached the boundaries of themodelling domain,\nwith ice extents >18 \u00d7 105 km2 (three times the standard\ndeviation above the mean). All 6 configurations featured\ncombinations of low temperatures (\u221214\u25e6C or lower) and\nsmall seasonal temperature variations, in conjunction with\nnormal to increased precipitation rates. In 4 out of the\n510 cases, the PUA configuration prevented the growth of\nany ice at all due to high temperatures (\u22127 to \u22129\u25e6C) and\/or\nlow precipitation. Upon removal of these 10 outliers, despite\nthe high variance in input parameters, and the high sensitivity\nof modelled ISM results to these parameters, the variation\nin standard deviation of the modelled ice volume dropped\nbelow 5% after 200 runs (Fig. 5).\nThe small number of outliers (10 in total) comprise<2% of\nthe runs, suggesting that PUA configuration was appropriate\nin most cases. The fact that only 6 configurations resulted in\nice sheets that grew out of the domain suggests a conservative\nselection of parameter ranges towards their upper end. At the\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 913\nTable 2.

This suggests the variation of input parameter\nranges may be biased towards the lower end.\nThis is supported by the mean ice extent and volume\nof the PUA (Table 2), which lie below that of the \u221212\u25e6C\nbaseline scenario (Table 3): the mean modelled ice extent\nof the remaining 500 ice sheets which reach equilibrium\n(after 30 kyr) is \u223c5.7\u00d7105 km2, with a standard deviation of\n3.7\u00d7 105 km2, equivalent to slightly more than 65% of the\nmean (Table 2).\nPossible explanations for the smaller average ice extent\ncompared to that of the \u221212\u25e6C baseline scenario include\nthe unchanging spatial pattern of the precipitation scheme,\nwhere scaling of the precipitation below a certain threshold\nis more likely to inhibit ice nucleation in general. Another\nfactor might be the PDFs of the input parameters. While most\nPDFs are symmetric around the default parameter values of\nthe baseline configuration (e.g. MAAT, precipitation, lapse\nrate), the PDFs of DDFsnow, the flow enhancement factor\nand the snow threshold temperature (Fig. 4f, h and k) are\nasymmetric, with a higher probability of selecting values that\nresult in relatively smaller ice sheets. However, the relatively\nlow sensitivity of modelled ice sheets to these last three\nfactors, and the high susceptibility to climatic factors makes it\nmore likely the aforementioned ice-mass configurations are\nthe result of high air temperatures and\/or low precipitation.\nIndeed, a closer examination of the model set-up config-\nurations of the runs that resulted in no significant ice sheets\nshowed that almost all of them had sea-level temperatures\nabove \u221210\u25e6C (relative to present-day climate) in combin-\nation with high values of seasonal temperature variation.\nSensitivity tests show that only small ice caps form for tem-\nperature lowering of<9\u25e6C (Fig. 3a), and, even for lower tem-\nperatures, high ablation rates during summer, as a result of\nlarge seasonal temperature variations, prevent the expansion\nof ice from the highest peaks. This underlines the fact that\ntemperature is probably the most important parameter for the\nISM, especially because it affects not only mass balance, but\nalso ice dynamics, and has multiple feedback and coupling\nmechanisms (see Fig. 2).\nThe model configurations generated for our PUA models\ncover a wide range of possible ice-sheet configurations\n(Fig. 7), and approximately half of all runs result in a single\nice sheet stretching across the Fennoscandian ridge. This is\nreflected in a relative standard deviation of extent of 92%\nover all runs during the inception phases, which decreases\nwith ice-sheet growth, and slowly increases again after 12 kyr\nto \u223c65% (Fig. 8).\nApart from the peak in the PUA resulting from the runs\nwhere only small ice caps formed, the PUA shows a bifur\ncation of modelled equilibrium ice extent above and below\n6 \u00d7 105 km2. The probability map (Fig. 7) indicates that the\ncause is likely to be the coalescence of the two separate ice\nsheets in the northeast and southwest of the Fennoscandian\nridge, which form in >80% of all runs. In \u223c50% of all\nmodel runs, these two ice masses coalesce to form a single\nlarge ice sheet. Probability drops sharply to values <5%\nalong the northwest coastal margin. A more gradual decrease\nis observed at the southeast ice-sheet margin in southern\nSweden and towards the Russianmainland. A relatively small\nnumber of runs (<10%) show considerably larger ice sheets\nreaching further into the Atlantic and covering the Baltic Sea,\nas well as forming independent ice caps towards the eastern\nboundary of the modelling domain.\nDEM UNCERTAINTY TESTS\nPlotting the standard deviation of the standard deviation\nof modelled ice extent against increasing numbers of MCS\nfor the DEM uncertainty test shows the value stabilizes\nafter \u223c100\u2013150 model runs under all three temperature\nscenarios (Fig. 9); consequently, the maximum number of\nconducted MCS runs for all scenarios was limited to 150.\nThis number is considerably larger than the number of\nTable 3.

Size of model area in cells is\nshown on the x and y axes.\nruns used in some other MCS. For example, Davis and\nKeller (1997) conducted 50 runs for slope stability prediction\nmodelling, andOpenshaw (1989) suggests 20\u201330 runs would\nbe sufficient if only summary statistics are required. For\nour DEM uncertainty runs, an estimation of the mean of\nmodelled ice sheets using only 50 runs would produce\nlargely sensible results: the mean of the first 50 runs for\nthe \u221210\u25e6C scenario is within 2.6% of that for all 150 runs\n(\u221212\u25e6C: 1.2%; \u221214\u25e6C: 0.3%). However an estimation of\nstandard deviation after only 50 runs shows as much as 31%\nchange from the value derived after 150 model runs for the\n\u221210\u25e6C scenario (\u221212\u25e6C: 14.5%; \u221214\u25e6C: 1.8%; cf. Fig. 9).\nThe requirement for an increased number of model runs to\nobtain a stable set of results is likely to be caused by the\ncomplexity of both the ISM and the model used to simulate\nDEM uncertainty, in comparison to, for example, a slope-\nstability model.\nModelled ice extent and volume for the three temperature\nscenarios (Table 3) show the total range of modelled ice\nextent (the difference between the minimum and maximum\nruns) to be \u223c22% around the mean for the \u221210\u25e6C scenario,\n\u223c16% for the \u221212\u25e6C scenario and \u223c3% for the \u221214\u25e6C\nscenario. The variation for modelled ice volumes is notably\nhigher, with values of\u223c31, 23 and 6% for the\u221210,\u221212 and\n\u221214\u25e6C scenarios.\nAn increased cooling from \u221210\u25e6C to \u221212\u25e6C relative to\nrecent temperatures results in an almost three-fold increase\nin modelled ice extent. The absolute standard deviation\nof modelled ice extents and volume under these cooler\nconditions only increases by about a third (Table 3; Fig. 9),\nwhich is equivalent to a drop of relative standard deviation\nfrom 6.6% to 3.1% (and equivalent to a drop from 9.1%\nto 4.2% in modelled ice volume). While further cooling to\n\u221214\u25e6C increases the size of the modelled ice sheet by about\nanother 50%, absolute standard deviation also decreases\nand relative standard deviation drops to \u223c1% (Fig. 10).\nThe impact of DEM uncertainty as represented by relative\nstandard deviation is larger for modelled ice volume than for\nice extent.\nFig. 8. Relative standard deviation (%) of modelled ice extent over\ntime for PUA.\nThis decreasing impact of DEM uncertainty on ISM results\nwith increasing total ice-sheet size, as measured by the\nrelative standard deviation of ice extent and volume across\nMCS runs (Fig. 10), is consistent with previous findings\n(Hebeler and Purves, 2008), as is the larger impact of DEM\nuncertainty on modelled ice volume than on ice extent.\nThese results reflect the shrinking influence of bedrock\ntopography in models where ice-sheet configurations result\nin larger ice masses.\nThis fact is also supported by the probability distribution\nfunctions of modelled ice extent for the three temperature\nscenarios shown in Figure 9, which are classified into\n30 equally distributed classes between the respective min-\nimum and maximum modelled ice extent. In the \u221210\u25e6C\nscenario (Fig. 9b) a bifurcation in the PDF is observable,\nwhere a third of the modelled ice sheets are \u223c20% larger\nthan the rest.\nLooking at the associated probability map for the \u221210\u25e6C\nset-up shows the main ice masses in northern Norway\n(Fig. 11a), with two smaller ice caps in the southwest\nwith high glaciation probabilities. These are surrounded by\nan irregular probability distribution, showing that relatively\nlarge areas have relatively low probabilities of becoming\nglaciated. This suggests the bifurcation in the PDF is\ncaused by the coalescence of the two southwestern ice\ncaps. This occurs where local topography supports ice-\nmass coalescence, either by lowered elevation of obstructing\nridges or by increased elevation of associated peaks, which\ncan drive an increase in mass balance. The coalesced\nsouthern ice sheet can then expand further towards the\neast and west, due to the further increase in accumulation\nenabled by the presence of a high-elevation ice mass. This\npositive elevation mass-balance feedback occurs because as\nthe two ice caps meet, the area between them is rapidly\nfilled with ice, and instead of the bedrock, the elevated ice\nsurface determines air temperature, resulting in increased\nlikelihood of precipitation falling as snow and, in turn, less\nablation, thus increasing the mass balance of the ice sheet.\nThe additional ice then flows towards lower elevations, thus\ndriving ice expansion in the west and east.\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 915\na b\nc d\ne f\nFig. 9.

The associated probability map (Fig. 11b) features\ntwo glaciation centres, in the northeast and southwest, with\nglaciation probabilities being high over the majority of the\npotentially glaciated area but decreasing rapidly towards\nthe ice margins, dropping to zero within an average range\nof \u223c3\u20135 cells. This rapid transition of probability over a\nfew cells indicates a relatively certain position of the ice\nmargin. An exception to this is a considerable area of\nmedium- to high-probability glaciated cells located between\nthe northeastern and southwestern ice sheets. In \u223c10\u201315\nof the 150 runs, these ice sheets are not fully connected\nand the described elevation mass-balance feedback is not\ninitiated, resulting in substantially smaller ice-sheet extents.\nThis reflects uncertainty in the coalescence of the two ice\nmasses. In the northeastern corner a similar pattern exists,\nwhere glaciation probability gradually decreases towards the\nice margin over \u223c20\u201330 cells. In these areas, the position of\nthe ice margin is less certain, resulting in a higher sensitivity\nto uncertainty in bed topography. While, because of the\nlarge overall ice masses, the relative difference in size is\ncomparably small, the configuration of the modelled ice\n916 Hebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models\nFig. 10. Relative standard deviation (%) of modelled ice extent (solid)\nand volume (dashed) for the three temperature scenarios of the DEM\nuncertainty MCS.\nsheets is significantly different, namely two separate ice\nsheets in almost 10% of all cases, as compared to a single\nlarge ice sheet.\nWith a further decrease in temperature to \u221214\u25e6C, the\ninfluence of DEM uncertainty, measured as both relative and\nabsolute standard deviation, becomes negligible, resulting\nin an evenly distributed PDF with an absolute variation of\n3.5% from the mean. The probability map for this scenario\n(Fig. 11c) shows a single ice mass stretching over the\nFennoscandian ridge with centrally high probabilities of\nglaciation and, again, a rapid decrease in probability towards\nthe edges. Here, ice extent is mainly limited by calving into\nthe Atlantic and the Baltic Sea, as well as higher ablation\nrates in southern Sweden. The influence of topography on\nice flow is limited to a relatively small area in the northeast,\nwhere the glaciation probability decreases more gradually\ntowards the Russian mainland (Fig. 11c).\nSince ice-sheet models are commonly run at resolutions\nof 5\u201320 km, an order of magnitude lower than the most com-\nmon DEMs of the Earth\u2019s surface (e.g. SRTM, GLOBE,\nGTOPO30), DEM accuracy is often assumed to be irrelevant.\nOur analysis has shown this assumption to be misleading,\nbecause uncertainty such as that simulated for the GLOBE\nDEM has an impact upon model results that is similar in\nscale to that of other key ISM parameters such as the flow\nenhancement factor, basal traction or the refreezing fraction.\nAdditionally, because of the necessary resampling of DEMs\nduring preparation for use as ISM input, key landform fea-\ntures and attributes are often lost due to the inherent smooth-\ning. This, in turn, may lead to unrealistic tuning of an ISM or\nits climate-driver parameters in order to force ice growth.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS\nThe aim of this work is to systematically investigate the effect\nof uncertainty in model parameterization and input data,\nand to develop a set of methods that can be generalized\nfor exploring this parametric uncertainty in ice-sheet model\nresults, rather than to investigate the uncertainties associated\nwith a particular ice-sheet reconstruction. The conducted\nmodel tests are valid primarily for the selected baseline\nFig. 11. Probability maps of modelled ice extent of the DEM\nuncertainty MCS runs; (a) \u221210\u25e6C, (b) \u221212\u25e6C and (c) \u221214\u25e6C.\nProbability of each gridcell being glaciated across 150 runs is plotted\non top of the Fennoscandian coastline. x and y axes are given in\nnumber of cells.\nparameter values, which makes a comparison of the absolute\nmodel results with those from other experiments, or with\nwork from other authors, difficult. The main reason for this\nis that the impact of uncertainty in one parameter can\nstrongly depend on a number of other model parameters.\nModelling of the Fennoscandian ice sheet using different\nmodels, climate data or topographic resolution is likely to\nproduce different results, which is partly triggered by the\nHebeler and others: Uncertainty in ice-sheet models 917\nlarge degree of approximation applied in large-scale physical\nice-sheet models. Despite this, a comparison of the results\nobtained throughout our experiments with empirical data,\nsuch as that compiled by Svendsen and others (2004), can\nhelp to integrate our findings with previous work.\nIn general, the ice-sheet configuration obtained by apply-\ning our baseline climate compares well with those com-\npiled by Svendsen and others (2004) for the LGM in Fenno-\nscandia, except for the eastern ice margin, where modelled\nice sheets reach the Gulf of Bothnia and northern Finland,\nwhile the recorded LGM maximum is further east, reaching\nacross the White Sea into Russia. The smaller ice sheets\nmodelled within our experiments are presumably the result\nof the climate distribution (temperature and precipitation)\nbased on present-day observations, which are likely to differ\nfrom those of the LGM. Additionally, because we did not aim\nat reconstructing the LGM ice sheet, boundary conditions\nwere not adjusted for this task. Earlier experiments on Fenno-\nscandia that applied climate time series based on Green-\nland Icecore Project (GRIP) data (Dahl-Jensen and others,\n1998), as well as global sea-level changes, reproduced ice-\nsheet configurations well in line with recorded LGM ex-\ntents (Hagdorn, 2003). Because open water of>250m depth\nrestrains ice advance through the associated calving rates\napplied within the model, the Baltic Sea prevents ice flow\ntowards the east. Applying local sea-level lowering that pre-\nvailed during the LGM would have facilitated the filling of\nthe Baltic Sea and consequent ice flow eastwards, and mod-\nelled ice sheets and associated uncertainties would have\nprobably been larger. This assumption is sustained by the\nfact that for PUA runs with very cold climate and increased\nprecipitation, which account for the maximum modelled ice\nextent (Fig. 7), the Gulf of Bothnia is ice-covered despite\nthe unchanged sea level, and maximum ice extent reaches\ninto the White Sea and Russia, giving a closer resemblance\nto the maximum ice limits mapped by Svendsen and others\n(2004).\nWhile, for the DEM uncertainty experiments, the spatial\ndistribution of the input topography was varied, for the PUA\nparameters were varied globally. The changes in topographic\nconfiguration as a result of DEM uncertainty influenced\nice-sheet configuration both through impact on inception\npoints and ice flow. Alteration of ridges and troughs controls\nthe coalescence of ice masses and resulted in different\nconfigurations (two isolated vs one continuous ice sheet;\nFig. 11a and b), represented by the bifurcation of the\nassociated PDFs (Fig. 9). This same bifurcation can be seen in\nthe PUA results (Fig. 6), where the influence of topography\non ice-sheet configuration is determined by the prevailing\nclimate. While the patterns are comparable, the variation of\nmodelled ice extent and volume encountered in the PUA is\nmuch larger than that of the DEM uncertainty tests.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. We have proposed a set of methods, that can be\ngeneralized, for exploring the parametric uncertainty of\nice-sheet model results. The approach of compiling a\nrange of possible parameter values from the literature\nas well as climate input data, and the derivation of as-\nsociated probability functions to be used as input to a\nPUA, allows numerous stable models of ice sheets to be\ngenerated and analysed. While the 510 runs conducted\nfor the PUA require considerable amounts of time and\ncomputing power, it was shown that if extreme outliers\nare eliminated during the analysis (e.g. through visual\ninspection) the overall number of necessary runs can be\nreduced to 200\u2013250. Comparison of the relative impacts\nof tested parameters as well as their impact ratio on mod-\nelled ice extent and volume aids understanding of uncer-\ntainty impact mechanisms as well as the explanation of\nPUA results.\nA comprehensive selection of ISM parameters were\nused to generate ice sheets of Fennoscandia, and the ma-\njority of these resulted in stable ice masses. This allowed\nus to identify the importance of particular parameters\non ice-sheet extent and volume. The approach presen-\nted here provides a reproducible method for sensitivity\ntesting of ISMs, in order to determine their susceptibility\nto uncertainty in input data and to the choice of model\nparameters.\n2. Applying an uncertainty model in the simulation of DEM\nerror allowed us to explore the impact of uncertainty\nin bed topography on modelled ice sheets. Across MCS\nruns, for ice sheets in equilibrium, recorded variations\nwere in the range 0.8\u20136.6% for modelled extent, and\n1.2\u20139.1% for modelled volume, depending on the ap-\nplied temperature scenario. Even though these variations\nare relatively small, experiments suggest that the effect\ntopographic uncertainty can have on model results, es-\npecially during phases of inception and for smaller ice\nsheets, is significant and can result in substantially dif-\nferent ice-sheet configurations. Using an ISM that em-\nploys the shallow-ice approximation in combination with\na complex uncertainty model, such as the GLOBE DEM\nuncertainty model applied in this study, showed that a\nminimum of 100\u2013150 MCS runs is required in order to\ndeliver a stable and reliable set of results that inform\nthe user about the probability of particular areas being\nglaciated.\n3. Using different climate scenarios, the dependency of\nthe impact of topographic uncertainty on the overall\nsize of an ice sheet was determined. The influence\nof DEM uncertainty on ISM is comparable to that\nof (other) parameters, such as the flow enhancement\nfactor or basal traction. Parameters influencing mass\nbalance directly, such as mean annual air temperature,\nprecipitation and DDFs, were confirmed to have the\nlargest impact on modelled ice extent and volume.\nUncertainty from model parameters, assessed by a full\nparametric uncertainty analysis, revealed large variations\nin modelled ice-sheet extents, with a relative standard\ndeviation of 65% across MCS runs for equilibrium ice\nsheets. Modelled ice-sheet configurations exhibited a\nbifurcation, induced by characteristics of the bedrock\ntopography.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by the Swiss National Science\nFoundation SNF, project No. 200020-109449.
