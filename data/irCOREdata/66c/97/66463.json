INTRODUCTION\nWithin the past decade, the CPU clock speed of PCs has\nincreased by about 100 times, and the use of parallel process-\ning has increased supercomputer speed by up to 3 orders of\nmagnitude, making many problems accessible to solution by\ncomputational techniques. In addition, a Crank-Nicolson1 al-\ngorithm established for solving the superfluid Gross-\nPitaevskii equations2 has been adapted for solving the time-\ndependent Ginzburg-Landau equations,3 which provides a\nfurther improvement in efficiency of one or two orders of\nmagnitude. These improvements permit the use of TDGL\ncomputation to model superconductors with high finite k val-\nues in contact with nonsuperconducting materials.\nThe phenomenological TDGL equations provide a way of\nmodeling superconductivity more complete than simple mac-\nroscopic models,4,5 but without the extreme complexity of\nmicroscopic theory which makes such calculations impracti-\ncal for the mixed state. The TDGL equations have been used\nto calculate I-V characteristics for superconductors with\ninsulating-boundary surface pinning6 and with bulk pinning\nby point pinning sites.7 The initial vortex penetration field of\na superconductor with a notch8 has also been investigated\nusing TDGL theory, along with the current flow in a 3D\nlayered superconductor.9,10 Some of the systems considered\nin the literature consider spatially varying material properties\nby invoking a variation in the critical temperature Tc.9\u201312\nThe effect of surface barriers on superconductors is a phe-\nnomenon which has been researched in detail for most of the\nhistory of superconductivity. The effect of coatings on the\nsurface critical field Hc3 has been determined by using lin-\nearized equations to obtain Hc3 as a function of coating\nresistivity.13 The question of initial vortex penetration into a\ncoated superconductor was first posed by Bean and\nLivingston,14 and solved in the high-k limit using London\ntheory, and using 1-D Ginzburg-Landau theory.15 The Bean-\nLivingston model is based on the competition between the\nattraction from an \u201cimage force\u201d and repulsion due to the\nscreening currents, and predicts an initial vortex penetration\nfield Hp<Hc. Much later, it was confirmed\ncomputationally16 that their result is valid for the extreme\nmetallic limit irrespective of k. The case of the supercon-\nductor with an insulating surface was solved by Matricon\nand Saint-James using the 1-D Ginzburg-Landau equations,17\nshowing that Hp was noticeably higher than the Bean-\nLivingston value, due to the need to force the material nor-\nmal at the insulating edge before fluxons can enter. This has\nmore recently been followed by computational work16,18\nwhich confirmed the Matricon result.\nThis paper extends our understanding of coated supercon-\nductors from the insulating and extreme metallic limits to the\ncase of superconductors coated with metals of arbitrary re-\nsistivity. These systems involve spatial variation of both Tc\nand normal-state resistivity r. The generalization of the com-\nputation to include spatially-dependent r necessitates imple-\nmentation of internal boundary conditions, but enables the\ndirect computational simulation of new classes of systems.\nHence coated superconductors, polycrystalline bulk materi-\nals swhere the grain boundaries may be nonsuperconductingd\nand superconducting composite conductors swhich may in-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 144507 s2005d\n1098-0121\/2005\/71s14d\/144507s9d\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society144507-1\nclude normal metal matrix materialsd can all begin to be\naddressed computationally. Our aim in this work is to deter-\nmine the effect of the surface barrier on the hysteretic mag-\nnetic response to an applied magnetic field. As part of our\nlong-standing interest in bulk superconducting properties, we\nhave also considered how best to eliminate the surface bar-\nrier from a superconductor. For this reason the properties of\nbilayer coatings, which consist of a weakly superconducting\nS8 layer interposed between the superconductor and normal\ncoating are calculated. This bilayer structure was chosen in\nlight of the experimental findings19,20 that the creation of a\ndiffusion layer between a superconductor and its normal\nmetal coating reduces the superconductor\u2019s magnetic irre-\nversibility.\nIn Sec. II an overview of the time-dependent Ginzburg-\nLandau model is given, and the appropriate parameters based\non normal-state material properties are determined. In Sec.\nIII we discuss the general impact of symmetry considerations\non TDGL computation, the numerical method itself, and how\nthe calculations were optimized.\nIn Sec. IV we consider a superconductor coated with a\nnormal metal. The magnetization characteristics themselves\nare calculated along with the initial vortex penetration field\nHp and the hysteresis. The minimum possible Hp and corre-\nsponding rN \/rS are also found. srN \/rS is the ratio of the\ncoating resistivity to the normal-state resistivity of the super-\nconductor.d\nIn Sec. V we consider the effect of introducing a weakly\nsuperconducting region between the superconductor and the\nnormal metal coating. As for the single normal metal coating,\ncomplete magnetization loops and Hp values are calculated.\nThe implications of all the results obtained are discussed\nfurther in Sec. VI. Finally, in Sec. VII we give a summary of\nthe results and conclusions.\nII. BACKGROUND THEORY\nA.

Varying coating resistivity\nThe Ginzburg and Landau original paper27 described a\nsuperconductor in terms of the two free parameters a and b,\nwhich can be expressed in terms of the coherence length j\nand penetration depth l. Both j and l are temperature de-\npendent, and so together with the critical temperature Tc de-\nfine the thermodynamic properties of any homogeneous iso-\ntropic superconductor as a function of field and temperature.\nThe time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations add the dif-\nfusivity D and the normal-resistivity r to the equations, but\nD can be obtained from j and Tc via Eq. s3d, while the r can\nbe obtained from l and Tc using Eq. s4d, thus showing that\nintroducing time dependence does not introduce any new\nfree parameters. Hence r, D, and Tc also provide a complete\nset of variables.\nIn this paper we consider both simple normal metal coat-\nings and bilayer coatings which include an additional weakly\nsuperconducting layer to represent a diffusion layer. Chang-\ning the resistivity of the normal metal coating leaves com-\nplete freedom in setting its diffusivity. In this paper the\nFermi-level density of states gs\u00abFd, given by\ngs\u00abFd =\n1\n2e2Dr\n, s22d\nwas held constant throughout the grid, while Tc and r were\nused to define material properties. This is appropriate if\nchanges in resistivity are determined mainly by impurity\nconcentration sand therefore by changes in Dd. In the bilayer\nsS8 \/Nd coating simulations, Tc and r were varied linearly\nacross the S8 layer. Since the core superconductor in the\ncomputation is the critical part of the system, and in most\nrelevant experiments is far larger than the coatings, the mag-\nnetization data were obtained from a sum over the core su-\nperconductor alone si.e., not including the S8 layerd. The\napproach excludes the possibility that the data are dispropor-\ntionally representative of the coatings.\nIII. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD\nA. Symmetry problems\nIf a local energy minimum in a physical system can be-\ncome a local maximum while equilibrium is maintained\nthroughout, changes in the system cannot be described cor-\nrectly without explicit consideration of symmetry breaking.\nWhereas an analytic calculation can check for the point at\nwhich a minimum becomes a maximum and then identify the\ncorrect minimum-energy equilibrium state, a time-dependent\ncomputation can get stuck at an energy maximum unless\nsymmetry breaking is introduced. In a superconductor, both\nNUMERICAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF NORMAL-\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 144507 s2005d\n144507-3\nthe Meissner state and the normal state may be erroneously\npreserved if symmetry breaking is absent.\nIn the Meissner state of an infinitely long superconductor,\nevery point along the edge is equivalent to every other point,\nwhich may mean that the superconductor remains trapped in\nthis state even above Hp. We have addressed this symmetry\nproblem by considering finite rectangular swhere the corners\nbreak the symmetryd and circular swhere roughness is im-\nposed by the rectilinear discretizationd superconductors. If\nthe surface barrier is not weakened by the corners, Hp ob-\ntained from both rectangular and circular computations will\nagree with analytic values in the large-grid limit.\nSimilarly, if the superconductor becomes completely nor-\nmal it is impossible for superconductivity to renucleate even\nif this is energetically favorable. When c\u02c6 is zero everywhere,\n]c\u02c6 \/]t8=0 fcf. Eq. s20dg and the normal state is erroneously\npreserved whatever the shape of the superconductor. Re-\nnucleation of superconductivity can be enabled by adding\nrandom Gaussian noise to both real and imaginary compo-\nnents of c\u02c6 after every 50 iterations. This noise is of mean\nzero and standard deviation 10\u22126. Within the superconducting\nregime this noise has a negligible effect on the results, as\nnoise 104 times more intense was found to have a negligible\neffect on the results18 except for the time scale\u2014more noise\nleads to faster equilibration.\nB. Numerical method\nMuch of the existing TDGL computational work has been\ndone using the simple explicit U-c method.6,8,18 An explicit\nalgorithm for solving partial differential equations involves\ncalculating the time-derivatives based on existing data, and\nthen advancing in time by a simple Euler step. Unfortunately,\nthis method is very computationally expensive for diffusion\nequations such as the TDGL equations\u2014as the explicit algo-\nrithm only considers nearest neighbors, the timestep dt be-\ntween iterations must be shorter than the diffusion time\nacross a cell of width dx for the algorithm to be stable.28\nMany of the calculations presented here would have required\na dt,0.001t ms1d\nJ had they been calculated using the U-c\nmethod, even for k=2, and at high k values even smaller dt\nvalues would have been needed, scaling as 1\/k2. In this pa-\nper we used a semi-implicit algorithm3 which considers the\neffect of the entire grid on any given location, thus allowing\na dt of up to 0.5t ms1d\nJ\n, although for rN \/rS values far from 1,\ndt values as low as 0.1t ms1d\nJ were needed for accuracy and\nstability. We note that to successfully use these much larger\ntime steps, one of the link variables must be calculated first,\nand the new results used in calculating the second link vari-\nable. When the two link variables were calculated in parallel,\neven the semi-implicit algorithm became unstable. The order\nof link-variable calculation is switched on alternate iterations\nto preserve x \/y symmetry as much as possible.\nC. Optimizing the computation\nIn Schmid\u2019s dirty-limit TDGL theory, the ratio of the time\nconstants z8=p4 \/14zs3d=5.78, while in TDGL theory as ob-\ntained for superconductors dominated by paramagnetic\nimpurities,29 z8=12. In Fig. 1, where the time evolution is of\nexplicit interest, our calculation uses z8=5.78. The remaining\nwork in this paper considers equilibrium properties, where\nthe time-dependent terms ultimately tend to zero. As a result,\nz8 was set to 1 to reduce computational expense. We have\nconfirmed that this setting of z8 does not affect the results,\nwhile reducing computation times considerably\u2014this is con-\nsistent with work in the literature.8 In order to obtain the\nequilibrated magnetic properties, the applied magnetic field\nwas ramped from one value to the next, and then held con-\nstant. The field increment was typically 0.05Hc2, ramped\nover 100t ls1d\nJ\n, although when obtaining precise Hp values\nmuch smaller increments were used. The equilibration time\nstypically 400t ms1d\nJ\n, although this varied depending on the\nsystemd was determined by confirming the convergence of M\nto 3 significant figures.\nIn all computations included in this paper, a grid spacing\nof 0.5j in both x and y directions was used.

Flux entry behavior\nFigure 1 shows the time evolution of uc\u02c6 u2 as flux enters a\nsuperconductor with an insulating surface and a supercon-\nductor with a rN=rS normal metal coating sthe outer surface\nof the coating was set to be insulatingd. For each system, the\nsuperconductor was equilibrated in the Meissner state with\nan applied field of Hp\u22120.01Hc2 swhere Hp is the minimum\nfield at which flux entry occursd then the field was increased\nto Hp+0.01Hc2. The mechanism of flux entry is quite differ-\nent in the two cases\u2014in the insulating surface case a con-\ntinuous normal region forms at the edges which then breaks\nup into fluxons, while in the metal-coated superconductor\nindividual fluxons enter the superconductor from the edge of\nthe material where uc\u02c6 u2 has been depleted by the proximity\neffect. When the magnetization response was calculated for a\nsuperconductor with normal metal coatings of various thick-\nnesses, it was found that any thickness above 2js1d gave the\nsame result for Hp. This shows that the order parameter\nwithin the coating becomes negligible within 2js1d for H\n<Hp, and so the normal metal coatings used here can be\nconsidered to be infinitely thick. A metal coating slows the\ndiffusion of fluxons into the superconductor compared to an\ninsulating surface because Hp, and therefore the driving force\non the fluxons, is lower for the metal-coated superconductor.\nIn the analytic work on initial vortex penetration, the non-\nsuperconducting side of the barrier is not explicitly consid-\nered. In both the insulating17 and extreme metallic14 limits,\nc=0 outside the superconductor, and the fluxons first nucle-\nate just inside the superconductor. For a superconductor\ncoated with a normal metal this leads to the question as to\nwhere current vortices first form. Figure 2 is a logarithmic\ncontour plot for such a system. It consists of three main\nregions: an outer region in the normal coating dominated by\nnoise where uc\u02c6 u2,10\u221210, a second region containing screen-\ning currents which circulate near the superconductor-normal\ninterface and exists in both regions and an inner region\nwhich contain a few fluxons, but where the order parameter\nis in most regions close to unity sMeissner stated. It can be\nseen that there are small depressions of c within the normal\nmetal layer, which have associated vortex currents. These\nproto-fluxons do not have quantized flux of f0 associated\nwith them. We have found that unlike the two extreme limits\nconsidered analytically, the proto-fluxons first nucleate\nwithin the \u201cnoisy\u201d region in the normal coating, then cross\nthe screening current region into the superconductor.\nB. Normal metal coatings\nFigure 3 shows the complete magnetization characteristics\nfor superconductors coated with insulator and with metals of\nvarious resistivities. The sample magnetization M was calcu-\nlated by subtracting the applied magnetic field H from the\ninternal magnetic field B scalculated by =\u02c6Ad, and then\naveraging over the S region only sthe demagnetization factor\ncan be ignored for a 2D systemd. Adding a metal coating\nreduces the surface critical field Hc3 from its insulating-\nsurface value of 1.69Hc2 to Hc2 when rN\u0142rS, consistent\nwith the Hurault result.13 sNote that superconductivity can\npersist in corners even above Hc3, as noted in the\nliterature.18d The magnitude of the magnetic hysteresis de-\ncreases as rN \/rS decreases, or as k increases. However, the\nfield dependence of the hysteresis is a property not only of\nthe coating itself but also of the shape of the superconductor\nbecause in superconductors with small dimensions, fluxons\nwhich have already entered the superconductor impede the\nentry of further fluxons.16 In contrast to the hysteresis, the\ninitial vortex penetration field Hp is characteristic of the coat-\ning alone, and is considered in more detail below.\nFigure 4 shows the results of Hp calculations for coating\nresistivity values ranging from rN=0.1rS to rN=10rS at k\nvalues of 2, 5, 10, and 20. Hp was calculated for both rect-\nangular sopen symbolsd and circular superconductors sclosed\nsymbolsd. It is clear that HpsrN \/rSd has a minimum value\nsHpsmindd that is lower than the extreme metallic limit\nFIG. 2.

The y axes in\nFig. 4 have been scaled so that the extreme metallic srN\n=0d and insulating srN=\u2018d limits are at the same positions\nfor all values of k sthe Hp values at these two limits converge\nin the extreme high-k limit17d. The rectangular and circular\nHp results agree to within a reasonable accuracy. We there-\nfore conclude that the corners are not responsible for deter-\nmining Hp in the rectangular superconductor and that the\ngrid size is sufficiently large. The existing result that\nnotches8 reduce Hp and the observation in Fig. 1 that fluxons\ndo not enter directly at corners suggest that convex features\nincrease Hp, and in particular that corners do not weaken the\nsurface barrier, and so that the computed Hp values in Fig. 4\nare equivalent to values determined by the Bean-Livingston\nand Matricon calculations.\nTo confirm that the minimum in Fig. 4 is not specific to\nthe conditions T=Tcs2d=0, Fig. 5 shows the effect of pair\nbreaking on Hp. The same system is considered as in Fig. 4,\nbut at T= 23Tcs1d and Tcs2d=0 sthis is also equivalent to T=0\nand Tcs2d=\u22122Tcs1dd. In this system the minimum is attentu-\nated considerably, as the pair-breaking forces c\u02c6 rapidly to\nzero in the normal metal, reinforcing the surface barrier for\nrN,rS, while weakening it for rN.rS. However, the mini-\nmum is not suppressed completely. The convergence of the\ndata at high rN \/rS in Figs. 4 and 5 suggests that in the rN\n@rS limit, fHpsrN \/rSd\u2212Hps0dg \/ fHps\u2018d\u2212Hps0dg depends pri-\nmarily on rN \/rS and T, not k.\nFigure 6 focuses on the minima in the HpsrN \/rSd charac-\nteristics in Fig. 4 swith some additional k valuesd, and dem-\nonstrates that Hpsmind, and srN \/rsdopt have approximate\npower-law dependences.

For rN.rS, the hysteresis\nenergy increases with rN \/rS, while for rN,rS it is approxi-\nmately independent of rN \/rS. The minimum observed in the\nHp characteristic does not appear in the hysteresis energy\ncharacteristic because hysteresis energy depends on both flux\nentry and flux exit, and the barrier for flux exit drops mono-\ntonically as rN \/rS decreases in the important low field re-\ngion. This cancels out the effect of the Hp minimum on the\nhysteresis energy.\nC. Bilayer \u0084S8 \/N\u0085 coatings\nIt is clear from the results presented so far that single\nnormal metal coatings cannot destroy the surface barrier in\nany significant field range. The effect of a weakly supercon-\nducting S8 layer between the S and N layers was therefore\ninvestigated with the intention of reducing the magnetic hys-\nteresis further and obtaining reversible magnetic behavior\nover the widest possible field range.\nFigure 8 shows examples of magnetization curves calcu-\nlated for k=2, bilayer coated superconductors. For an N\nlayer with rN=rS, adding a 2j -thick S8 layer has a minimal\neffect, while an S8 layer at least 10j thick makes the magne-\ntization essentially reversible above 0.4Hc2. For an N layer\nwith rN=10rS adding an S8 layer results in a less pronounced\nreduction of the hysteresis, and for a 2j-thick S8 layer there\nis an anomalous increase in both Hp and hysteresis energy,\nwhich is discussed below. It may be noted that the calcula-\ntions in Fig. 8sbd are more computationally expensive\u2014not\nonly does the large rN require the simulation time step to be\nreduced, but the equilibration itself is slower\u2014taking up to\n10 times longer in normalized time than for a system with a\nsimple normal metal coating.\nIn Fig. 8sad the magnetization characteristics for S8 thick-\nnesses of 10j or more appear to be reversible for fields above\n0.3Hc2, which opens the possibility of the existence of an\nirreversibility field. Since the irreversibility field marks the\npoint at which critical current density Jc becomes zero, it is\nan important issue both experimentally30\u201332 and theoret-\nically.30,31 The magnetization irreversibility DM obtained\nfrom the data in Fig. 8sad is plotted on a logarithmic scale in\nFig. 9. It is clear that there is no evidence for a phase tran-\nsition in high fields. For S8 thicknesses of 20j, DM eventu-\nally becomes less than that resulting from a single fluxon for\nH\u00f80.35Hc2. A limited set of calculations for a much larger\ngrid of 250j3200j, where one fluxon would make a much\nsmaller contribution to M, still showed a nonzero DM, thus\nconfirming that the apparent irreversibility field in Fig. 8sad\nis not the result of any phase transition.\nFigure 10sad shows Hp as a function of the thickness of S8\nfor k=2 and rN values of 0.1rS, rS and 10rS. The anomalous\nincrease in Hp first noted in Fig. 8sbd srN=10rSd is found for\nFIG. 7. Hysteretic energy density as a function of rN \/rS at k\n=2, 5, and 20.\nFIG. 8.

In Eq. s20d for rN=10rS, diffusiv-\nity D is decreased within the S8 layer, which lowers the\nkinetic energy term and thus increases c\u02c6 at the S8 \/S inter-\nface, increasing the energy penalty associated with moving\nfluxons into the superconductor. For S8 thickness of 3j or\nless this effect dominates, resulting in the anomalous Hp in-\ncrease, while for thicker S8 layers, Hp decreases because the\nBean-Livingston image force begins to dominate again. The\ninitial vortex penetration field never reaches the lower criti-\ncal field value33 of 0.195Hc2, but instead tends asymptoti-\ncally to a somewhat higher value of 0.205 Hc2. This differ-\nence and hysteretic behaviour is found even for a 50j-thick\nS8 layer fcf. Fig. 8sadg and is discussed in the next section.\nFigure 10sbd demonstrates the effect of changing k on the Hp\ncharacteristic as a function of S8 thickness\u2014for all values of\nk there is a general trend of decreasing Hp as the S8 thickness\nis increased, but again full reversibility is not achieved for\nthicknesses up to 20j.\nV. DISCUSSION\nA. The effects of coatings on Hp\nThe value of Hp is determined principally by two consid-\nerations. The first is the gradient of the order parameter at the\ninterface of the superconductor. The dependence of Hp on the\ngradient explains the existence of the minimum. Both very\nlow and very high rN \/rS have high Hp as the interface\nboundary conditions force a steep gradient: on the N side of\nthe interface for high rN \/rS and on the S side for low rN \/rS.\nThis means that in both of these cases the Bean-Livingston\n\u201cimage force\u201d is close to full strength. Close to srN \/rNdopt,\nthe screening supercurrent extends somewhat into the normal\nmetal, weakening the image force and lowering Hp. This\ndependence of Hp on =c\u02c6 also explains why adding a weakly\nsuperconducting S8 layer reduces Hp, as c8 is gradually re-\nduced to zero over the width of the S8 layer. The decrease in\nsrN \/rSdopt as k increases results from the second Ginzburg-\nLandau equation\u2014at high k values the screening current can\npenetrate farther into the normal metal, meaning gradients at\nthe interface are optimized at a lower rN \/rS value. The first\nGinzburg-Landau equation only plays a minor role\u2014it was\nfound that changing the relation between DN \/DS and rN \/rS\nchanged Hpsmind but not srN \/rSdopt.\nThe second consideration in determining Hp is the value\nof c\u02c6 itself at the interface. In the extreme metallic limit, c\u02c6\n=0 at the interface while in the insulating limit, c\u02c6 at zero\nfield is the Meissner state value. c\u02c6 must be reduced to zero\nnear the edge of the superconductor before any fluxons can\nenter, which results in a greater energy penalty for fluxon\nentry in the insulating limit, and thus a higher Hp than for the\nextreme metallic limit.16 This \u201ccondensation energy\u201d consid-\neration also explains the anomalous increase in Hp observed\nin Fig. 8sbd.\nFinally we consider the general issue of the field depen-\ndence of the hysteretic magnetization data. Clearly, the re-\nversible magnetization of a superconductor does not depend\non its shape or size, provided that the separation between the\nparallel surface size is much larger than ,20l sl= the pen-\netration depthd. The surface barrier contribution to the irre-\nversible magnetization can be interpreted as a critical current\nalong the surface of the superconductor per unit length in the\nz direction, and is thus also independent of shape and size.\nThis means that the magnetization characteristics presented\nin Figs. 3 and 8 are completely general for a given k value\nand surface, rather than being specific to a given shape or\nsize. These calculations have also confirmed that thick\nsmooth S8 layers cannot completely destroy the surface bar-\nrier, to achieve complete reversibility surface defects such as\nnotches or surface roughness are required.8 It may also be\nnoted that the magnitude of DM for the superconductors with\ninsulating coatings can be approximated by\nDM <\n0.35\nk2\u02dbHc2\nsHc3 \u2212 Hd3\/2. s23d\nIf we consider a thin film conductor of thickness ,l, for\nexample, of a high-temperature superconducting RABITS\nconductor,32 the surface contribution to the average current\ndensity sJcd is DM \/l which can be rewritten as Jc\n<0.64JD\/ k swhere JD<Hc\/ l is the theoretical upper limit\nknown as the depairing current density34d. Such high current\ndensities are clearly of technological interest.\nFIG. 10.

Comparison with experimental results\nIn many superconducting samples, the effect of the barrier\nis complicated by a combination of suppression of the super-\nconductivity near the surface sdue for example to oxidationd,\nby roughness of the surface sthe effect of notches on Hp has\nbeen investigated computationally8d, or by the presence of\ntwin boundaries or other defects. In such samples the effect\nof the surface barrier is most apparent in the immediate vi-\ncinity of Hc1, but obscured in higher fields by the effects of\nbulk pinning. Surface barriers strong enough for the charac-\nteristic asymmetric irreversibility shown in Fig. 3, with the\nalmost-zero magnetization of the descending branch, has\nbeen observed in materials with surfaces which are flat on\nthe scale of the coherence length, for example, in single crys-\ntals of YBCO sRef. 35d and Bi-2212 sRef. 36d as well as thin\nwell-annealed samples of elemental niobium36 and powdered\nMgB2 sRef. 37d.\nThere has been relatively little experimental work on the\neffect of plating normal metals onto a superconductor with\nflat surfaces, although measurements reported on cylindrical\nsamples of a niobium-zirconium alloy38 showed a small de-\ncrease in magnetization irreversibility on plating with silver.\nThe computational work presented in Sec. IV C of this paper\nshows that diffusing the boundary between a superconductor\nand its normal-metal coating radically reduces surface hys-\nteresis scompare Fig. 3 with Fig. 8d. This result has been\nobserved experimentally in metallic interdiffusion experi-\nments on a lead-thallium alloy19 and in oxide-coated\nniobium.20\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has considered the issue of coating supercon-\nductors with finite size single layer and bilayer coatings. The\nproperties of superconductors of different k and coated with\nmaterials with a range of resistivity and Tc have been calcu-\nlated using the TDGL equations and discussed. Flux nucle-\nation and penetration into a superconductor have been de-\nscribed, and the values for Hp, including conditions for it to\nbe a minimum, have been reported. General characteristics\nfor the hysteretic magnetization of large samples have been\npresented, which can be applied to coated materials of arbi-\ntrary shape.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe express our gratitude to Lydia Heck, Duncan Rand,\nand Gerry Fuller for IT assistance.
