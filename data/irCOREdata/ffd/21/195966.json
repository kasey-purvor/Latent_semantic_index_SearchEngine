Combining the two independent data sets, we monitor an isolated polar cap patch of high electron density (1011.5 m\u22123) that slowly formed in the dark cusp ionosphere during an interval of northward interplanetary magnetic field. The patch formed on a stirred lobe cell, excluding the possibility for solar EUV ionized plasma to drift in from the south. This data set represents an unparalleled example of patch formation within the polar cap, locally by particle impact ionization. After the interplanetary magnetic field turned southward and By changed polarity, the patch started to move poleward into the polar cap. Enhanced velocity gave rise to enhanced HF backscatter power and enhanced spectral widths, consistent with gradient drift instability as the formation mechanism of HF backscatter targets","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/www.agu.org\/pubs\/crossref\/2006\/2005JA011400.shtml.","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/8112\/3\/Observations_of_isolated_polar_cap_patches_....pdf","pdfHashValue":"cce9fc8172d373707b6f0923e8308b962dd10950","publisher":"American Geophysical Union (AGU)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8112<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2015-12-14T17:17:53Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_1<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_10633<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nObservations of isolated polar cap patches by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Svalbard and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) Finland radars<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nOksavik, K.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRuohoniemi, J.

Introduction\n[2] Patches of enhanced F region electron density are\nfrequently observed in the polar ionosphere during periods\nof southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These\npatches are 100\u20131000 km wide regions of high electron\ndensity surrounded by significantly lower density plasma\n[Buchau et al., 1983; Weber et al., 1984; Crowley, 1996;\nDandekar and Bullett, 1999; Basu and Valladares, 1999],\nand the lifetime of F region plasma is so long that these\npatches are capable of maintaining their high electron\ndensity as they convect across the polar cap from the cusp\nregion to the nightside auroral oval [Pedersen et al., 2000].\n[3] The plasma source of the most intense patches is\nbelieved to be solar EUV ionization in the sunlit ionosphere,\nand during the arctic winter the general understanding is\nthat a \u2018\u2018tongue of ionization\u2019\u2019 is formed in the subauroral\ndusk F region ionosphere and extends through the cusp\nregion toward the polar cap [Knudsen, 1974]. Still there is\nnot a unified view on how this tongue of ionization is\nstructured into individual patches. Modeling work has\nsuggested that patches can be formed through changes in\nthe convection pattern under the influence of variations in\nespecially IMF By [Anderson et al., 1988; Sojka et al.,\n1993; Decker et al., 1994], and this mechanism is supported\nby the observations of Milan et al. [2002]. It has also been\nproposed and demonstrated that transient reconnection or\nflux transfer events could act as a structuring mechanism\n[Lockwood and Carlson, 1992; Carlson et al., 2002, 2004].\nA third approach is that the electron density depletion\nbetween patches may be caused by enhanced plasma\nrecombination rate due to enhanced ion-frictional or Joule\nheating from rapid plasma drift of short-lived east-west flow\nchannels in the cusp region [Valladares et al., 1994; Rodger\net al., 1994]. In principle these flow channels may even be\nthose of flux transfer events similar to what has been\nreported by Oksavik et al. [2004, 2005].\n[4] On the other hand it has also been suggested that\nplasma enhancements in the cusp region can be caused by\nsoft particle precipitation [Walker et al., 1999], and this is\nsupported by modeling results of Millward et al. [1999].\nOver the last few years it has also become evident that\nlocalized and very intense auroral emissions may occur in\nthe dayside polar cap during northward IMF [Milan et al.,\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A05310, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011400, 2006\n1Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Mary-\nland, USA.\n2Department of Physics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\n3Also at Department of Arctic Geophysics, University Centre in\nSvalbard, Longyearbyen, Norway.\n4Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Arlington, Virginia, USA.\n5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011400$09.00\nA05310 1 of 9\n2000; Sandholt et al., 2001; Fuselier et al., 2002; Frey et\nal., 2002, 2003, 2004; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2005], and this\nparticle precipitation may cause significant ionization that\neventually may result in F region patches of high electron\ndensity within the polar cap. In this paper we explore this\nalternative even further taking advantage of new observa-\ntional capabilities of the SuperDARN Finland and EISCAT\nSvalbard radars in a coordinated operation mode to monitor\nthe backscatter volume along one of the SuperDARN Fin-\nland beams with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution\nto study poleward moving transients in the cusp region.\nIn particular we focus on a 40-min time interval on\n16 December 2002 when a patch slowly formed in the dark\ncusp ionosphere. During its formation the patch was clearly\nseparated from the subauroral sunlit ionosphere by a well-\ndefined plasma trough (possibly so well defined because of\nthe preceding period of predominantly northward IMF), and\nthe patch started to move into the polar cap when the IMF\nBy changed sign and the IMF turned southward.\n2. Data Presentation\n[5] The radar field of view is given in Figure 1 versus\nmagnetic latitude and magnetic local time. The SuperDARN\nFinland radar at Hankasalmi was operating in a special\nmode with 30 km range resolution giving 70 range gates\nbetween 900 and 3000 km from the radar. One frequency\nchannel of the Stereo mode [Lester et al., 2004] was\nsweeping through all 16 beam directions every 48 s (shown\nwith light gray shading). Simultaneously, the other Stereo\nchannel was sweeping through beam directions 6\u201311 every\n18 s (shown with darker shading). Both frequency channels\nwere dwelling for 3 s per beam direction. The EISCAT\nSvalbard 32-m dish was operated in a fast scan along beam\n9 of the SuperDARN Finland radar (\u000118.4\u0001 azimuth, shown\nwith a solid line), continuously swinging the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar beam between the elevation extremes of 30\nto 150\u0001 every 128 s.\n[6] Figure 2 presents observations from the ACE space-\ncraft located in GSM coordinates around (242, 13, 7) Re.\nThe solar wind dynamic pressure was low, and the velocity\n(not shown) was mostly around 450 km\/s, with a couple of\nbrief maxima reaching over 500 km\/s, which means that the\nsolar wind will need around 55 min to propagate along the\nSun-Earth line, before the response is expected to be\nobserved in the dayside ionosphere. A 55-min time delay\nis also consistent with the observed behavior of the large-\nscale dayside convection pattern seen by SuperDARN in\nFigure 3. These convection maps have been created using\nthe technique of Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998], and wher-\never there are actual measurements from at least one radar\n(indicated with color coded flow vectors) it is reason to\nbelieve that mesoscale features are real and not introduced\nby the technique, consistent with a study by Greenwald et\nal. [1996]. Data from all Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN\nradars is used, and for the Stereo mode radars each\nfrequency has even been processed separately before inclu-\nsion. The convection velocities are very low near magnetic\nnoon from 0840 to 0850 UT, consistent with the IMF being\nnorthward dominated (marked as interval 1 in Figure 2).\nFrom 0850 to 0906 UT the convection pattern reflects a\nsituation with both By and Bz positive (marked as interval 2\nin Figure 2) characterized by the presence of a lobe cell\nindicated with blue lines in Figure 3. From 0906 to 0912 UT\nthe convection intensified and the pattern gradually turned\nmore symmetric, in response to a brief negative rotation of\nboth the By and Bz components (marked as interval 3 in\nFigure 2). From 0912 to 0920 UT the convection pattern\ngradually returned to a northward IMF situation in response\nto the IMF turning northward (marked as interval 4 in\nFigure 2). In all panels of Figure 3 a black line is drawn\nfrom 70\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude to indicate the area scanned\nby the EISCAT Svalbard radar, and along this line the\nlocation of electron density patches in the EISCAT data\npresented in Figure 4 are marked with circles. We notice\nthat the flow velocities are very low for 0840\u20130850 UT, the\nenhanced westward flow was generally located south of the\npatches for 0850\u20130906 UT, the net flow intensified and\ngradually rotated poleward for 0906\u20130912 UT, and the flow\ngradually faded away for 0914\u20130920 UT.\n[7] Figure 4 shows data from the EISCAT Svalbard radar\nfor the same time period, plotted versus magnetic latitude\n(indicated with vertical magnetic field lines) and altitude\nfrom 250 to 500 km (indicated in the lower left panel). The\ncolumns from left to right show profiles of electron density,\nelectron temperature, ion temperature, and radar beam line-\nof-sight ion drift velocity. In the latter case, red color\nrepresents plasma drift away from the radar; that is, north-\nward drifting plasma is represented by blue color south\nof the radar site and red color north of the radar site\n(75\u0001 magnetic latitude). For these scans the radar beam\nwas moving back and forth like a windscreen wiper, that is,\nstarting out from the north at 0842:24 UT, reaching the\nsouth at 0844:32 UT, and returning north at 0846:40 UT.\nDistinct features in the electron density profiles are the\nhigh-density cold plasma tongue-of-ionization (south of\n74\u0001 latitude) extending into the dark cusp from the sunlit\nFigure 1. Field of view of the SuperDARN Finland radar\n(shaded area) and the EISCAT Svalbard radar (thick solid\nline). The SuperDARN Finland beams 6\u201311 are highlighted\nwith darker shading.\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n2 of 9\nA05310\nsubauroral ionosphere, the plasma trough [Whalen, 1987,\n1989] in the form of a minimum in the electron density\n(74\u201375\u0001 latitude), and the appearance of polar cap patches\nassociated with high electron temperature (north of\n75.5\u0001 latitude). In particular, we notice the slowly growing\npatch from 0842 to 0908 UT, which increased in electron\ndensity from 1011.2 to 1011.5 m\u00013. When the flow in Figure 3\nintensified around 0906 UT and rotated poleward around\n0910 UT, the patch also started to move poleward, and the\nEISCAT Svalbard radar line-of-sight ion drift and ion\ntemperatures increased. Simultaneously, a second patch\nstarted to appear around 75.5\u0001 magnetic latitude. This was\nfollowed by a third patch that appeared around 0916 UT. All\nthree patches drifted into the polar cap, and the striking\ndetail is that there appears to be no transport of high-density\nplasma across the plasma trough. All three patches seem to\nfirst appear and intensify north of the plasma trough.\n[8] For consistency, in Figure 5 we also show data from\nbeam 9 of the SuperDARN Finland radar. In the first panel\nonly ionospheric scatter is plotted, and the color scale is set\nto 10\u201320 dB to emphasize regions of strong backscatter.\nThe second panel shows the line-of-sight Doppler shift\nvelocity, and the last panel shows the spectral width of\nthe backscattered signal. For the velocity panel red color\nreveals that the plasma drift has a poleward component\n(away from the radar), blue color reveals that the plasma\ndrift has an equatorward component (toward the radar), and\ngrey color indicates ground scatter. In the time frame 0840\u2013\n0905 UT there are several enhancements between 76\u201378\u0001\nmagnetic latitude in the HF backscattered power. The exact\nlocation and power level changes slightly throughout the\ntime interval, most likely attributed to varying propagation\nconditions for the HF signal from the radar site at Hanka-\nsalmi in Finland to the ionosphere over Svalbard and back\nto Hankasalmi, and the fact that the radar for short periods is\npicking up ground scatter near the ionospheric scatter.\nHowever, starting around 0906 UT there is a clear enhance-\nment in the HF backscatter power in Figure 5 at 77\u201379\u0001\nmagnetic latitude. At the same time the ESR density patch\nin Figure 4 is observed at 76\u201378\u0001 magnetic latitude, which\nmay indicate that the standard SuperDARN procedure for\ncalculating the location of the backscatter overestimated the\nground range by \u00021\u0001 magnetic latitude. This is fully\nconsistent with previous work by Yeoman et al. [2001] that\nreported the ground range at a similar distance from the\nradar to be off by 114 \u00b1 15 km in a study involving the\nFigure 2.

Blue lines identify the location of lobe cells. Please notice that the blue lines are\ndashed for the 0858\u20130900 UT frame to indicate that we think a lobe cell is still active but cannot be properly identified\nbecause of insufficient data coverage; the same lobe cell is seen both before and after that particular 2-min interval.\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n3 of 9\nA05310\nFigure 3\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n4 of 9\nA05310\nSuperDARN Iceland East radar and the EISCAT Troms\u00f8\nHeater. Starting around 0909 UT the structure of high HF\nbackscatter power begins to move rapidly poleward like a\npoleward moving radar auroral form (PMRAF) [e.g., Milan\net al., 1999; Davies et al., 2002; Rae et al., 2004], consistent\nwith a significant enhancement in the poleward flow in the\nlast panel of Figure 5. It should also be noted that at the same\ntime the HF spectra got significantly wider and the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar observed increased ion temperatures.\n3. Discussion\n[9] To our knowledge this is the first time complete\naltitude\/latitude profiles of the four prime plasma parame-\nters (Ne, Te, Ti, and Vi) from an incoherent scatter radar\nhave been presented along a SuperDARN radar beam in the\ncusp region ionosphere. It is well known that transient\nchanges in the F region electron density do occur in the\ncusp region, and examples of structure due to particle\nprecipitation have been reported by, for example, McCrea\net al. [2000] and Moen et al. [2001]; however, previous\nobservations [McCrea et al., 2000; Moen et al., 2001;\nDavies et al., 2002] have only involved one-dimensional\nviews using standard fixed-geometry modes of the EISCAT\nradars. The unique location of the EISCAT Svalbard radar\nrelative to beam 9 of the SuperDARN Finland radar makes a\nnew and more comprehensive mode of joint operation\npossible, which may turn out to be a great tool toward\nFigure 4. A sequence of electron density, electron temperature, ion temperature, and radar beam line-of-\nsight ion drift velocity measurements from the EISCAT Svalbard radar in the altitude range 250\u2013500 km\n(see lower left panel for an altitude scale). For the velocity panels, red color indicates plasma drift\naway from the radar; that is, red color corresponds to equatorward drifts to the south of the radar site\n(75\u0001 magnetic latitude) and poleward drifts north of the radar site.\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n5 of 9\nA05310\nunderstanding the generating mechanisms for both the HF\nbackscatter irregularities and transient phenomena that\noccur along the common field of view.\n[10] In the current data set the unique coverage allows us\nto study in great detail the formation mechanisms of a patch\nof high electron density in the dark polar cap dayside\nionosphere on a stirred lobe cell. The preceding interval\nof northward IMF moves the open\/closed field line bound-\nary sufficiently poleward to allow us to clearly differentiate\nbetween the two potential sources of plasma: local produc-\ntion by soft particle precipitation vs. intake of dense solar\nEUV ionized plasma from the sunlit subauroral ionosphere.\nFigure 4 reveals that there is a persistent plasma trough\nbetween the subauroral plasma and the patches being\nformed north of 75\u0001 magnetic latitude, and there is no\napparent evidence of plasma being transported across the\ntrough. Consequently, the Lockwood and Carlson [1992]\nmechanism does not appear to be active. Furthermore, in the\ncurrent data set there does not appear to be a clear tongue of\nionization extending from lower latitudes into the polar cap,\nand it is unlikely that the mechanism of Valladares et al.\n[1994] and Rodger et al. [1994] is forming the patches. The\nfact that the convection velocities in Figure 3 seem to\nbe very low when the first patch started to form around\n0842 UT strongly implies that this patch was formed locally\nwithin the lobe cell (indicated with blue lines in Figure 3)\nand eventually started moving poleward around 0910 UT. It\nshould also be pointed out that the terminator between the\ndark and sunlit ionosphere was located over Northern\nScandinavia, more than 10\u0001 magnetic latitude equatorward\nof the patch, further supporting that the patch did originate\nlocally over Svalbard. The elevated electron temperature in\nFigure 4 points to soft electron precipitation as an important\nsource of the ionization, which is supported by modeling\nresults of Millward et al. [1999]. We therefore interpret this\ndata set as compelling evidence that soft electron precipita-\nFigure 5. Backscattered power, line-of-sight Doppler shift velocity, and spectral width for beam 9 of the\nSuperDARN Finland radar. In the first panel, only ionospheric scatter is shown. In the velocity panel, red\ncolor indicates plasma drift away from the radar (into the polar cap), and grey color identifies ground scatter.\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n6 of 9\nA05310\ntion does generate plasma enhancements that can be iden-\ntified as patches in the cusp region [Walker et al., 1999].\n[11] This data set also has the interesting implication that\nformation of electron density patches due to soft electron\nprecipitation may even be active during periods of north-\nward IMF, and in particular if there is a very localized cusp\nspot of intense high-latitude auroral emissions in the day-\nside polar cap [Milan et al., 2000; Fuselier et al., 2002; Frey\net al., 2002, 2003, 2004; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2005]. According\nto Figure 3 the first patch occurred on the poleward edge of\na gradually growing channel of westward flow, within what\nappears to be a small lobe cell of relatively low flow\nvelocity. The first pattern at 0842 UT shows the situation\njust before the electron density of the patch started growing.\nAt 0846 UT the first signs of a lobe cell became apparent\n(indicated with a blue line in Figure 3); with enhanced flow\non its equatorward side near 1300 MLT, and the electron\ndensity of the patch slowly increasing (see Figure 4). By\n0850 UT the lobe cell was larger and had rotated slightly\nclockwise; still with the channel of strong westward flow on\nits equatorward side, and in a shape that remained a\nprominent feature for several consecutive convection pat-\nterns (indicated with blue lines in Figure 3). This means that\nthe ionospheric plasma may circulate and be more or less\ncontinuously stimulated by soft electron precipitation for an\nextended period of time, gradually increasing the F region\nelectron density. This is also what is observed in Figure 4\nfrom 0842 to 0908 UT, where the electron density went\nfrom 1011.2 to 1011.5 m\u00013. Typical soft electron precipitation\nin the cusp is capable of producing electron densities within\nthis range [Millward et al., 1999]. Still it needs to be pointed\nout that there is probably some upper threshold of patch\ndensities for when the production by particle precipitation is\nmatched by increased recombination, and consequently for\nhigh-density patches (of the order \u00021012 m\u00013) transport of\ndense subauroral plasma will be required. There is also a\nfundamental difference between (1) patches formed within\nthe polar cap during Bz north that we present here and\n(2) formation of patches by intake of plasma from the south\nduring Bz south and By positive; the former case can only\nbe attributed to pure particle impact ionization, whilst the\nlatter can be attributed to both solar EUV ionization in the\nsubauroral ionosphere and additional exposure to particle\nprecipitation as the patches enter the polar cap.\n[12] For a lobe cell the rotation is determined by IMF By\ncomponent. According to equation (3) of Sofko et al.\n[1995], the upward field-aligned Birkeland current is given\nby Jk = SP B \u0004 r \u0006 v \u0001 E \u0004 r SP + Bv \u0004 rSH, where SP\nand SH are the height-integrated Pedersen and Hall\nconductivities, v is the F region plasma drift velocity, and\nB and E are magnetic and electric fields. In the dark winter\npolar cap, where there is only soft particle precipitation, the\ntwo conductivity gradient terms are expected to be very low\n[Moen and Brekke, 1990], so the vorticity of the plasma\ndrift (first term) is expected to be the significant contributor\nto the total current. In the Northern Hemisphere (with B\npointing down) a clockwise vorticity will surround an\nupward current. For the lobe cell we see in Figure 3 (see, for\nexample, 0902 UT) the circulation is indeed clockwise,\nconsistent with a localized upward Birkeland current and\nelectron precipitation. Even if we do not have any optical\ndata of the aurora for the day we are looking at; there\nhave been multiple reports of polar cap precipitation and\npolar cap arcs associated with lobe cells [Obara et al., 1998;\nSandholt et al., 2001; Eriksson et al., 2003], and even\nvery localized spots of intense high-latitude auroral emis-\nsions in the dayside polar cap [Milan et al., 2000; Fuselier et\nal., 2002; Frey et al., 2002, 2003, 2004; \u00d8stgaard et al.,\n2005].\n[13] The existence and formation of patches in the cusp\nregion during northward IMF conditions shows that under-\nstanding the dynamics of polar cap patches may be of even\ngreater importance than thought in the past. On the basis of\na significantly higher number of observed cases during such\nconditions, it has generally been believed that patches are\npredominantly of importance during periods of southward\nIMF. However, it seems likely that patches will be most\neasily identified in the form of transients in a quick-moving\nplasma, which could bias their sampling. This may also be\npart of the reason why observations of patches seem to\nfollow changes in the orientation of the IMF and in\nparticular changes in the IMF By component [e.g., Milan\net al., 2002]. With more comprehensive observations like\nthe SuperDARN Finland and EISCAT Svalbard radars in\ncoordinated operation it is now also possible to track\npatches even before they start moving.\n[14] Rapid changes in the convection pattern will also\nintroduce joule heating of the plasma from increased collision\nfrequency between the ions and the neutrals, which is ob-\nserved by the EISCAT Svalbard radar in Figure 4. Starting at\n0910 UT a band of high ion temperature appears poleward of\n76\u201377\u0001 latitude, and this feature seems to be consistent with a\ngeneral widening of the SuperDARN Finland spectra in\nFigure 5. Simultaneously there was a dramatic enhancement\nof the poleward flow. North of 77\u0001 latitude both radars clearly\nshow a change in the ion drift from weakly equatorward to\nstrongly poleward in response to the IMF By polarity change.\nIt is likely that the changing conditions are contributing\nfactors to SuperDARN\u2019s ability to detect the patches. In order\nto receive backscatter two conditions must be met: the HF\nsignal must be able to propagate from the radar site to the\nbackscatter volume via an ionospheric refraction and ground\nreflection, and the backscatter volumemust have field-aligned\nirregularities serving the role of backscatter targets. The\ngradient drift instability is believed to be the most important\nmechanism to drive the plasma unstable for an event like we\npresent in this paper [Ossakow and Chaturvedi, 1979;\nTsunoda, 1988; Moen et al., 2002]. The gradient drift insta-\nbility occurs when there is plasma drift along a density\ngradient, a criterion that will always be the case for patches.\nIn this context it is very interesting to notice that the HF\nbackscatter seemed to become more prominent once the\nconvection increased and the patch started moving. However,\nwith the currently available temporal\/spatial resolution it is\nimpossible to prove\/disprove the role of the gradient drift\ninstability using only ground-based data alone [Moen et al.,\n2002]. Therefore it has been proposed to launch a sounding\nrocket into the cusp region ionosphere to address this issue\n[Moen et al., 2003].\n4. Summary and Concluding Remarks\n[15] In this paper we have presented high-resolution\nobservations of an isolated polar cap electron density patch\nA05310 OKSAVIK ET AL.: BRIEF REPORT\n7 of 9\nA05310\nthat slowly formed on a stirred lobe cell over a 40-min time\nperiod in the dark cusp ionosphere during an interval of\nnorthward IMF. The convection velocity was very low\nwhere the patch formed, and the region of formation was\nseparated from subauroral plasma by a trough, which leads\nus to suggest that the patch was produced locally. The slow\nplasma motion allows adequate time for particle precipita-\ntion to be a candidate source for the patch density produc-\ntion, and enhanced electron temperature points at particle\nprecipitation as the most likely source. After the IMF turned\nsouthward and By changed polarity the patch started to\nmove poleward, as seen both in the EISCAT Svalbard radar\ndata and in the SuperDARN Finland backscatter power.\nThis new operational mode with the EISCAT Svalbard radar\nin 2-min scans along beam 9 of the SuperDARN Finland\nradar has great potential for studies of transient phenomena\nin the cusp region.\n[16] Acknowledgments.
