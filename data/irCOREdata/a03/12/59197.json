N. Hewitt\n(n.hewitt@lancaster.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe compilation of spatially and temporally detailed invento-\nries for the emission of anthropogenic volatile organic com-\npounds (VOCs) from urban areas is a necessary requirement\nfor air quality regulatory purposes, effects assessment and\nresearch. Current emission estimates are associated with\nlarge degrees of uncertainty (Friedrich and Obermeier, 1999)\nwhich may limit their usefulness. Much of this uncertainty\ncan be attributed to the large variety of different source cate-\ngories which contribute to urban VOC emissions, which can\nbe difficult to characterise and validate. Rather than taking\na \u201cbottom-up\u201d inventory approach, an alternative is to make\ndirect micrometeorologically based measurements which can\nintegrate observations of wind speed and scalar concentra-\ntions to give a city-wide estimate of pollutant emission rates\n(Nemitz et al., 2002; Dorsey et al., 2002; Velasco et al, 2005;\nMartin et al., 2008; Famulari et al., 2009).\nCurrently, the eddy covariance (EC) technique is con-\nsidered the most direct micrometeorological method avail-\nable for estimating surface\/atmosphere exchange fluxes, as it\nmeasures the turbulent flux directly, without reliance on any\nempirical parameterisations. This approach requires high\nfrequency measurements (typically in the order of 5\u201320 Hz)\nof both vertical wind speed and concentration (or mixing ra-\ntios) to resolve all eddies that contribute to vertical transport\n(Lenschow, 1995). Although this technique is now well es-\ntablished for the measurement of some trace gases, such as\nCO2 and H2O (Aubinet et al., 2001), its application to VOC\nfluxes has been restricted because of the slow response times\nof most VOC sensors.\nA number of alternative micrometeorological approaches\nhave been developed which relax the demands placed upon\ninstrument response times. The technique most com-\nmonly applied to VOCs is the relaxed eddy accumulation\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1972 B. Langford et al.: Eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC from a city\nmethod (REA), a conditional sampling technique where sam-\nples of air are directed into an up or down draught reservoir\naccording to the sign of the vertical wind velocity at the time\nof sampling (Businger and Oncley, 1990). Air from each\nreservoir is subsequently analysed off-line and a flux is calcu-\nlated from the difference in concentration generated between\nthe two reservoirs. Unlike the eddy covariance method, REA\nis not a direct measure of the flux as it relies on empirical\nparameterisation. Furthermore, there is no scope for retro-\nspective corrections to the coordinate frame (Bowling et al.,\n1998). Despite these drawbacks, the REA method has been\nsuccessfully applied to a range of vegetation types including\ngrass land (Olofsson et al., 2003), forests (Schween et al.,\n1997; Gallagher et al., 2000; Tani et al., 2002; Greenberg et\nal., 2003; Ciccioli et al., 2003; Friedrichs et al., 1999) and\nlately in an urban study (Park et al., 2008).\nMore recently a second technique, disjunct eddy covari-\nance (DEC) (Rinne et al., 2001; Warneke et al., 2002;\nTurnipseed et al., 2009), has been developed for \u201crelaxed\u201d\nflux measurement. Rather than measuring at high frequen-\ncies as in EC, in DEC the flux is calculated using a sub-set\nof a continuous time series. In order to retain the flux con-\ntributions carried by small scale eddies, DEC utilises near-\ninstantaneous grab samples of air which are aspirated into\na storage reservoir at regular intervals. The \u201cdead\u201d time be-\ntween the sampling periods is then used to analyse the air at a\nrate suitable for the gas analyser. The discontinuous dataset\ngenerated can be used to give high precision flux informa-\ntion, which is numerically similar to the EC approach, but\nwith reduced statistics (Grabmer et al., 2004). The DEC ap-\nproach is particularly useful for sensors with a response time\nof 1 to 20 s.\nWith the advent of quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS)\nfor the use of atmospheric composition measurements, a\nrange of analysers is now becoming available that can pro-\nvide fast measurements (as determined by the dwell time on a\ngivenm\/z), which is nevertheless discontinuous (as the QMS\nscans through a range of m\/z\u2019s). One such instrument is the\nproton transfer reaction-mass spectrometer (PTR-MS; Ioni-\ncon GmbH; Innsbruck, Austria) which allows for the mea-\nsurement of most VOCs with good sensitivity (10 ppt) and\nfast response times (200 ms\u20131 s).\nThe quadrupole mass spectrometer in the PTR-MS can be\nprogrammed to scan over a small suite of masses in what is\ntermed a scan cycle. Although in theory the instrument has\na sufficient response time to be compatible with the eddy co-\nvariance method, in reality the quadrupole can only scan one\nmass at a time; therefore the dataset returned on completion\nof each duty cycle is in effect disjunct.\nTo optimise flux measurement approaches for these kind\nof data, the DEC concept has been developed further to cal-\nculate fluxes from the discontinuous time-series at each m\/z\nby pairing up each concentration measurement with the as-\nsociated wind measurement in software, a process known\nas virtual disjunct eddy covariance (vDEC) (Karl et al.,\n2001, 2002; Spirig et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006; Ammann et\nal., 2006; Brunner et al., 2007). The advantage of this tech-\nnique is that air can be sampled directly into the instrument,\nas individual masses are measured at a sufficiently fast rate:\ntherefore no additional sampling system is required. Further-\nmore, analysis times are shorter than in DEC, allowing more\ndata points to be collected during each averaging period and\nreducing the statistical uncertainty associated with the use of\na discontinuous time series by averaging over a larger num-\nber of eddy motions. However, shorter dwell times can lead\nto increased random error in individual concentration mea-\nsurements, therefore a balance must be found between anal-\nysis times and measurement frequency.\nThe vDEC method has been successfully applied to give\nVOC flux estimates over vegetation canopies, including\ngrassland (Karl et al., 2001; Ammann et al., 2006; Brunner\net al., 2007), forests (Karl et al., 2002; Spirig et al., 2005;\nLee et al., 2006), and over an urban environment (Velasco et\nal., 2005).\nIn the current study we deployed both the DEC and vDEC\ntechniques for the measurement of a range of VOCs above\nthe city of Manchester (UK). The recorded data were then\nused to calculate city-wide emission fluxes which were com-\npared to the UK National Atmospheric Emission Inventory\n(NAEI) for Manchester (http:\/\/www.naei.org.uk\/datachunk.\nphp?f datachunk id=174).\nThe NAEI, as with most emission inventories, is com-\npiled using a bottom-up approach, where combinations of re-\nported and estimated emissions across numerous source sec-\ntors are used to provide a spatially disaggregated (1\u00d71 km)\nemission inventory. The uncertainty associated with these\nestimates is dependent on the ratio of reported to estimated\n(modelled) data, and hence for compounds such as VOCs,\nwhere reported emissions are limited and uncertainty levels\nare high, micrometeorological methods offer a useful alter-\nnative and\/or validation.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Measurement site and general setup\nThe work presented here formed part of the UK CityFlux\nproject, which aimed to (i) directly measure pollutant emis-\nsions from urban areas, (ii) investigate controls of these\nemissions, (iii) derive emission factors relative to CO2 and\nCO and (iv) study pollutant transformation by comparing\nfluxes at the plume, street canyon and urban canopy scale.\nDuring the summer of 2006, micrometeorological measure-\nments of VOC emissions were made over the city of Manch-\nester, together with measurements of fluxes and concentra-\ntions of VOCs, aerosols, O3, CO2 and H2O, as well as mo-\nbile measurements with a mobile laboratory, measurements\nin a street canyon, tracer releases and aircraft-borne mea-\nsurements. The VOC flux measurements were taken from\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 1971\u20131987, 2009 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/\nB. Langford et al.: Eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC from a city 1973\nthe roof of Portland Tower (53\u25e628\u203241\u2032\u2032 N; 2\u25e614\u203218\u2032\u2032 W), an\n80 m tall, rectangular (46 m\u00d716 m) office block, which is lo-\ncated in central Manchester. The building is situated on Port-\nland Street, which is approximately 600 m distance from the\nArndale centre, (the city\u2019s principal shopping district) 475 m\nfrom Piccadilly railway station, (the north-west\u2019s busiest sta-\ntion), and 100 m from the China Town district (a concen-\ntrated area of restaurants). The office block is surrounded by\ntrafficked streets on three sides and a multi-storey car park\non the other. The buildings in the immediate vicinity of the\ntower are predominately commercial thus giving the site an\nurban classification of 2 according to the criteria described by\nOke (2006) (intensively developed high density urban area\nwith 2\u20135 storey, attached or very close-set buildings often of\nbrick or stone, e.g. old city core).\nThe roof of Portland Tower is not uniformly flat but has\nthree levels. On the lowest level a small shed was erected\nwhich housed the PTR-MS. The second level, 2 m above,\ncontained a utility substation (20 m\u00d710 m) which was used\nto house the sonic anemometer signal box. The roof of the\nsubstation was used as the foundation for a 15 m mast which\nwas fitted to the north west facing wall and instrumented\nwith a sonic anemometer (Solent Research R3, Gill Instru-\nments Ltd, Lymington, Hants, UK) and Teflon gas inlet line\n(1\/2\u2032\u2032 OD; 0.38\u2032\u2032 ID). The mast was erected to get above the\nwake effects generated from both the edges of the building\nand the inhomogeneous roof surface and increased the ef-\nfective measurement height to 95 m above street level. The\nanemometer and sample inlet were therefore 13 m above the\nhighest part of the roof. Particle number fluxes from this site\nhave been presented by Martin et al. (2008).\nFluxes were measured between 5 and 20 June 2006. Dur-\ning the first few days of measurements (5th\u201310th) a high\npressure system was centred over Northern Ireland which\ndominated the weather during this period, with mostly dry\nconditions, clear skies and temperatures between 16\u201330\u25e6C.\nBetween 13th\u201316th a cold front slowly moved across South-\nern England and during this time temperatures at the mea-\nsurement tower dropped to a maximum of 24\u25e6C and a min-\nimum of 14\u25e6C on 16th. For the later part of the cam-\npaign, temperatures slowly increased as a high pressure ridge\nmoved in behind the cold front, increasing the average tem-\nperature to 21\u25e6C. Throughout the campaign the wind direc-\ntion shifted between SW and NNE, but also came from the\nSEE at certain times. The wind speed ranged between 0.4\u2013\n11.2 m s\u22121, with an average of 3.3 m s\u22121 (based on 30-min\naverages).\n2.2 The proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer\n(PTR-MS)\nA PTR-MS instrument (Ionicon Analytik, Austria) was\nused for the measurement of VOC concentrations. De-\ntailed descriptions of this instrument can be found elsewhere\n(Lindinger et al., 1998; Hayward et al., 2003; de Gouw and\nWarneke., 2007), therefore only a brief account of the instru-\nment and setup will be given here.\nThe PTR-MS used was an Ionicon standard model, con-\ntaining two turbo-molecular pumps, a 9.6 cm long drift tube\n(stainless steel rings) and heated silico-steel inlet, which\ndrew air at a rate of 0.15 l min\u22121. The quadrupole was pro-\ngrammed to sequentially scan through a suite of six pro-\ntonated target compounds: methanol (m\/z 33), acetalde-\nhyde (m\/z 45), acetone (m\/z 59), isoprene\/furan (m\/z 69),\nbenzene (m\/z 79) and toluene (m\/z 93). In addition\nto these compounds, the primary ion count, measured at\nm\/z 21 (H183 O+) and two reagent cluster ions, m\/z 37\n(H163 O+ (H162 O+)) and m\/z 55 (H163 O+ (H162 O+)2) were also\nrecorded. A further mass, m\/z 25, was used at the start of\neach measurement cycle as a spacer to ensure the monitored\nair did not contain residues from the previous sample.\nDuring the measurement period drift tube parameters pres-\nsure, temperature and voltage were held constant at 2 mbar,\n45 \u25e6C and 600 V, respectively, to achieve an E\/N ratio of\napproximately 125 Td. The primary ion count ranged be-\ntween (2.2\u20133.6)\u00d7106 with an average of 2.8\u00d7106. The\nreagent ions ranged between (1.07\u20132.62)\u00d7105 with a mean\nof 1.69\u00d7105 which represented 6% of the primary ion sig-\nnal. Average normalised counts ranged between 3 (benzene)\nand 72 [ncps] (methanol) with instrument sensitivities in the\nrange of 4.3 (isoprene)\u201313.3 (benzene) ncps ppbv\u22121.\nA VOC gas standard was not available for on-site cal-\nibration of the PTR-MS, hence mixing ratios were calcu-\nlated using the instrument specific transmission coefficients\nand reaction times taken from Zhao and Zhang (2004). The\ntransmission coefficients were calculated experimentally un-\nder laboratory conditions using a range of gas standards and\nthe method used has been described in detail by Wilkin-\nson (2006). Despite the careful calculation of coefficients,\nprevious studies (de Gouw and Warneke, 2007) have sug-\ngested mixing ratios calculated using this approach can have\nlarge systematic errors, therefore some systematic bias in\nmixing ratios cannot be ruled out here. It should be noted\nthat a systematic offset in the VOC mixing ratio due to the\ninstrument background will not affect the measured fluxes.\nAdditional uncertainties in PTR-MS measurements arise\ndue to the limitations of the mass filter, which can only re-\nsolve ion counts with a resolution of one atomic mass unit.\nTherefore attributing ion counts to individual VOC species\ncan be difficult, especially in the urban environment where\nnumerous emission sources give rise to air masses containing\na wide variety of compounds, several of which may have the\nsame integer molecular weight. Interference from other ions\nat m\/z 33, 45, 79 and 93 has been shown to be insignificant\nin previous studies (de Gouw et al., 2007), but both acetone\nand propanal have been detected at amu 59. Although this\ncan generate some uncertainty in the measurement of ace-\ntone, the signal of acetone is often dominant in ambient air\n(Kato et al., 2004), therefore ion counts recorded at m\/z 59\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 1971\u20131987, 2009\n1974 B. Langford et al.: Eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC from a city\nwere ascribed solely to acetone in the present study. Sim-\nilarly m\/z 69 may be isoprene and\/or furan, although the\nlatter is normally present at very low concentrations in am-\nbient air (Christian et al., 2004). Despite this, in the urban\natmosphere, contributions from unknown compounds such\nas alkenes cannot be ruled out and therefore m\/z 69 was ten-\ntatively attributed entirely to isoprene.\n2.3 Flux measurements\nDuring the campaign, two flux measurement techniques\n(DEC and vDEC) were employed to measure surface layer\nfluxes of VOCs from the urban canopy. As both techniques\nutilised a single PTR-MS instrument to give VOC concentra-\ntions, it was not possible to operate the systems simultane-\nously, and therefore fluxes were measured by the two meth-\nods in alternate half hours. A Teflon 3-way solenoid valve\n(001-0017-900, Parker Hannifin) sat in line and enabled the\nPTR-MS to switch between the two systems. Flux measure-\nments in each mode were averaged over a 25 min period and\nthe remaining 5 min of each half hour were used to scan the\nentire mass spectrum (m\/z 21\u2013146) to give basic ambient\nconcentration information on a wider range of VOCs. This\ninformation is to be presented elsewhere. Figure 1 shows a\ntypical PTR-MS operating sequence during 1 h of measure-\nments and includes the PTR-MS scan cycles for each flux\nmode.\n2.3.1 Virtual disjunct eddy covariance sampling system\n(vDEC)\nDuring the first period of each hour, the 3-way solenoid valve\nwas triggered to enable the PTR-MS to sub-sample directly\nfrom the main sample line in a virtual disjunct eddy covari-\nance mode. The quadrupole was set to scan each mass at\na rate of 20 ms, allowing sample air to be purged directly\ninto the instrument without the use of an additional sampling\nsystem. The inlet for the sample line was mounted a short\ndistance below the sonic anemometer, as vertical displace-\nment has been shown to result in the smallest flux losses\n(Kristensen et al., 1997). In order to maintain a turbulent\nflow through the sample line, and thus avoid dampening of\nthe VOC signal, a flow rate of approximately 60 l min\u22121 was\nused. Upon the completion of each PTR-MS scan cycle,\ndata were exported to a LabVIEW logging program using the\nMicrosoft Windows \u201cdynamic data exchange\u201d (DDE) pro-\ntocol, which stored the data alongside those from the sonic\nanemometer.\n2.3.2 Disjunct flux sampling system (DFS)\nA disjunct flux sampling system was deployed on the roof\nof the building to monitor the VOC fluxes for the second pe-\nriod of each hour. The schematic and operating sequence of\nthe DFS are depicted in Fig. 2. The sampler comprised two\none litre stainless steel canisters, which act as intermediate\nstorage reservoirs (ISR) for sampled air. Fast switching high\nflow conductance valves (Lucifer E121K45) were mounted\nto the inlet of each canister, enabling the ISR to take a fast\ngrab sample once activated. Each ISR was coiled with heater\ncable and insulated with aluminium foil to maintain an inter-\nnal temperature of 40\u25e6C. This, combined with the cylindrical\nshape of the canisters which reduced relative surface area,\nhelped to minimise loss of VOCs to walls, and minimised\ncondensation and the formation of liquid water, which can\nremove soluble compounds such as methanol from the gas\nphase.\nBefore grab samples of air were taken, each ISR was first\nevacuated to a pressure of 250 mbar. The time taken to evac-\nuate the canister, 12 s, was determined by the efficiency of\nthe pump and proved to be the limiting factor in determin-\ning the length of time between sampling. By contrast, the\ntime taken to fully pressurise the ISRs, 0.5 s, proved to be\nthe limiting factor in determining sampling times. This value\nis more than double that of previous studies (Grabmer et al\n2004; Rinne et al., 2000, 2001; Warneke et al., 2002) and\nis thought to be a consequence of the flow resistance of the\nsample tube, and the reduced pressure in the 1\/2\u2032\u2032 inlet tube\n(see below). This considered, the overall effective response\ntime of the DFS setup is about 0.5 s, which is sufficient to\nresolve turbulent fluctuations of up to 1 Hz. In comparison,\nthe effective response time of the vDEC system, which is\nlimited by the response time of the PTR-MS and not sample\nintegration time, was approximately 1 s. Therefore, despite\nthe shorter dwell time used in vDEC (20 ms) the effective\nresponse time was longer than in DEC, allowing turbulent\nfluctuations of up to 0.5 Hz to be resolved. At a measure-\nment height of 95 m the portion of the total flux carried in the\nsub 1 s range is negligible (estimated from Horst, 1997) and\ntherefore no explicit corrections were applied. Simulations,\nusing the sensible heat flux data, indicate that on average 5%\nof the heat flux were carried by frequencies between 0.5 and\n1 Hz. The effect is discussed below.\nGrab samples of air acquired by the DFS were analysed\nfor VOCs using the PTR-MS, which was connected to the\nDFS via a 4 m length of 1\/8\u2032\u2032 PFA tubing. The rate at which\nthe PTR-MS draws air from the ISR is important as a vacuum\nis gradually generated as air is sampled. This back-pressure\ncan affect the pressure in the drift tube, which can lead to\nsmall changes in the E\/N ratio of the instrument. In order\nto prevent this problem, the flow rate of the PTR-MS was\nreduced from 300 ml min\u22121 to 150 ml min\u22121.\nThe PTR-MS was housed some distance from the sonic\nanemometer. Thus the sampling line between ISRs and PTR-\nMS would have been too long for the DFS to be mounted on\nthe anemometer mast. Instead it was located at the base of the\ntower, with each sample valve connected via a \u201cT-piece\u201d into\nthe 1\/2\u2032\u2032 OD sampling line. This setup had three drawbacks:\nfirstly, the sample line is subject to a pressure drop of approx-\nimately 200 mbar, caused by the high flow rates used. Con-\nsequently, upon activation of sample valves each ISR could\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 1971\u20131987, 2009 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/\nB.

Secondly, air for anal-\nysis by the PTR-MS had to travel through an additional 4 m\nof 1\/8\u2032\u2032 tubing which may have resulted in the dampening of\nthe VOC signal. Finally, the additional inlet lines results in a\ntime lag between the wind measurement and the filling of the\nISR which had to be corrected for, similar to the correction\nin the vDEC approach. This correction is not required if the\nDFS can be mounted next to the anemometer.\nThe sequence of valve switching used to control both the\nsample and analysis phases of the DFS, which, combined\nwith valve switching, pressure recording, sonic anemometer\nand PTR-MS data recording, were all coordinated using Lab-\nVIEW software (National Instruments \u2013 v6.1).

The lag time was not constant due to fluctua-\ntions in temperature and pressure and the performance of the\npump which varied over time. For vDEC measurements the\npeak was typically found between 10 and 20 seconds whereas\nDEC lag times were much longer, 40\u201350 s, due to the cycling\ndelay of the DEC system (12 s) and an increased length of\nsample tubing.\nStandard rotations of the coordinate frame were applied to\ncorrect for tilting of the sonic anemometer. The vertical ro-\ntation angle showed a clear relationship with wind direction,\nwith maximum values of up to 15\u25e6. This is similar to other\nflux measurements in the urban environment (e.g. Nemitz et\nal., 2002) and suggests that, although the mean airflow at the\nanemometer is affected by the building, the influence can be\ncompensated by standard rotational corrections.\nCalculated fluxes were subject to a post-processing algo-\nrithm which filtered and removed data that failed to meet\nspecified quality controls. These included removal of large\nspikes in vertical wind speed or VOC concentration and the\nomission of data where the friction velocity (u\u2217) dropped be-\nlow 0.15 m s\u22121. This latter QA procedure resulted in the loss\nof 7% of the flux data.\nIn addition, during post-processing of the data, it was\nfound that the inlet pump was occasionally shut down by\nits thermal trip. The affected time periods were filtered and\nthe spikes removed, affected averaging periods were not in-\ncluded in the final flux analysis. This meant approximately\n31% of measured flux data was deemed unusable and are not\nincluded in the analysis here.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 VOC mixing ratios\nMixing ratios of VOCs measured by the PTR-MS are sum-\nmarised in Table 1 and the 25 min average values are plotted\nalongside temperature and wind direction in Fig. 3. The oxy-\ngenated compounds, methanol, acetone and acetaldehyde,\nwere the most abundant (methanol 1.3\u20138 ppbv; acetone 0.3\u2013\n4.4 ppbv; acetaldehyde 0.44\u20133.2 ppbv). The higher mixing\nratios of methanol compared with the other analytes are typi-\ncal for urban VOC composition measurements and can be at-\ntributed to its relatively low photochemical reactivity (Atkin-\nson, 2000) and the numerous anthropogenic\/biogenic sources\nwhich contribute to its emissions both in and outside of the\ncity (de Gouw et al., 2003). Comparisons of methanol con-\ncentrations with previous studies shows the values observed\nhere to be within the lower range of concentrations mea-\nsured in Barcelona (Filella and Penuelas, 2006) and within\nthe range of values recorded in Innsbruck (Holzinger et al.,\n2001). The concentrations of the other two oxygenated com-\npounds, acetone and acetaldehyde, both lie within the range\nof data reported from other major conurbations such as Rome\n(Possanzini et al., 1996), Los Angeles (Grosjean et al., 1996)\nand Rio de Janiero (Grosjean et al., 2002).\u2018\nConcentrations of isoprene ranged between 0.07\u2013\n0.75 ppbv, which is consistent with values obtained\nfrom the national air quality monitoring network\n(http:\/\/www.airquality.co.uk\/archive\/reports\/cat13\/\n0602011042 q3 2005 rat rep issue1 v5.pdf) for other\nUK cities, including Bristol and London. The aromatic\ncompounds, benzene and toluene, were the least abun-\ndant of the VOCs measured, ranging between 0.02\u20130.2\nand 0.03\u20130.73 ppbv respectively. These values also com-\npared well with data obtained from the national network\n(www.airquality.co.uk) automatic monitoring station on\nMarylebone Road, London although, on average, concen-\ntrations from the London site were higher, presumably due\nto the kerbside location of the sampler, compared with a\nsampling height of 95 m for the concentrations reported\nhere.\nLinear relationships were observed between the concen-\ntrations of each of the measured VOCs, with R2 values rang-\nAtmos.

These plots are useful for the in-\nterpretation and source apportionment of data. For exam-\nple, strong linear relationships, as seen in panel A or I,\nmay suggest a similar source contributing to the emission\nof the two compounds, whereas in panel K, where a bimodal\n(or even trimodal) distribution is evident, it is possible that\nthere are two (or three) separate sources contributing to the\nobserved VOC concentrations. Further information can be\nobtained from these plots by differentiating data points by\na third variable, in this case temperature as reflected in the\ncolour coding, which in some instances (e.g. panel E) can\nreveal what appears to be a temperature dependency in the\nmeasured concentration of the VOC. To help with the further\ninterpretation of the data shown in Fig. 4, Table 2 lists some\nof the known anthropogenic, biogenic and chemical sources\nof the measured compounds and also includes atmospheric\nlifetimes with respect to OH, NO3, O3 and photolysis.\nFigure 4, panel A, shows the correlation between isoprene\n(m\/z 69) and benzene (m\/z 79). Both these compounds are\nknown constituents of petrol fuel (Borbon et al., 2001), and\nconsequently they are emitted to the atmosphere by the same\ntwo anthropogenic sources: direct emissions in vehicle ex-\nhausts and evaporative emissions from petroleum products,\nhence the strong linear relationship (R2=0.87; p<0.0001)\nobserved between the two compounds during this study. This\nalso suggests that biogenic sources do not make a significant\ncontribution to mixing ratios at this site.\nToluene was the least volatile of the compounds mea-\nsured during this study and the ratios of its concentration\nagainst those of benzene, isoprene, acetone, acetaldehyde\nand methanol did not vary with temperature (Fig. 4, pan-\nels B, C, E, H and K, respectively). However, in each of these\nplots, bimodal distributions were observed and each of the\naforementioned compounds appeared to demonstrate some\ndegree of temperature dependency with respect to toluene,\nalthough this varied between compounds. Acetone appear-\ning to be highly temperature dependent, whereas benzene\nshowed only a slight variation with temperature.\nBenzene and toluene are both present in primary vehicle\nexhaust emissions (Jobson et al., 2005), and have differing\natmospheric lifetimes with respect to the OH radical and con-\nsequently analysis of the benzene to toluene ratio (B\/T) pro-\nvides a tool to gauge the photochemical age of an air mass\n(Warneke et al., 2001). Previous studies have shown the B\/T\nratio in primary exhaust emissions to typically lie in the range\nof 0.41\u20130.83 (Heeb et al., 2000), but this ratio increases as\ntoluene reacts with the OH radical faster than benzene and\nis preferentially removed over time in the atmosphere. In\nthe present study the average B\/T ratio was approximately\nTime & Date [UTC]\n Tue 06 00:00 Sat 10 00:00 Wed 14 00:00 Sun 18 00:00\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n [o\nC\n]\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nB\nen\nze\nne\n \/ \nTo\nlu\nen\ne \n[p\npb\nv]\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2 Temperature\nB\/T\nFig. 5. The ratio of benzene to toluene (solid line) followed the\naverage temperature (greyed area), suggesting an increase in the\nremoval rate of toluene due to increased levels of OH at higher tem-\nperatures.\n0.57 (Fig. 5), suggesting the observed concentrations were\ntypically originating from sources close to the measurement\nsite. However, during the period of elevated temperatures\n(9\u201312 June), the ratio increased to an average 0.67, which\nsuggests that the removal rate of toluene increased due to\nhigher concentrations of the OH radical corresponding to the\nincrease in temperature.\nAcetone (m\/z 59) appeared to show the greatest degree\nof temperature dependence of all the measured VOCs. Like\nacetaldehyde, acetone can be formed in the atmosphere as\na product of the photooxidation of other hydrocarbons, in-\ncluding propane, isobutene and isopentane (Singh and Zim-\nmerman, 1992). These are primary vehicle exhaust pollu-\ntants (Hwa, 2002; Chiang et al., 2007); however, the at-\nmospheric lifetime of each is typically on the order of tens\nof days, therefore temperature-dependent photooxidation is\nunlikely to be a major source of acetone within the city.\nBoth acetone and acetaldehyde are themselves found in ve-\nhicle exhaust emissions (Sigsby et al., 1987; Caplain et al.,\n2006), which accounts for the close relationship observed\nwith benzene concentrations. Again, the apparent temper-\nature dependency of these compounds, seen in Fig. 4, pan-\nels D and G, could be related to their high volatilities, leading\nto fugitive evaporative emissions at higher temperatures. Al-\nthough acetaldehyde is more volatile than acetone, and there-\nfore should demonstrate the greatest tendency to evaporate at\nhigher temperatures, acetone has a wider distribution of po-\ntential sources as it is not only found in petrol but also in a\nwide range of solvents and cleaning fluids (Table 2). Fur-\nthermore, the shorter atmospheric lifetime of acetaldehyde,\nwhich is removed by oxidation and photolysis (both likely to\nbe strongly correlated with temperature), may also contribute\nto the less prominent temperature dependency.\n3.2 VOC fluxes\nAveraged diurnal fluxes for the period 5\u201320 June 2006, as\nmeasured by both the DEC and vDEC techniques, are shown\nin Fig. 6.

Panels A, B, C, D and E show the average daily fluxes for methanol, acetone, benzene and toluene measured by the DEC and\nvDEC techniques. The error bars represent 1 standard error of the averages of the vDEC flux. Panels F, G, H and I show the corresponding\nregression plots for both corrected (closed circles, dashed line) and uncorrected DEC fluxes (open circles, solid line), where the correction\ntakes into account the carry over between subsequent samples in the ISRs.\ntime periods where measurements from both systems were\navailable. Despite some variability between the two systems,\nboth techniques show VOC fluxes to have a clear diurnal\ntrend, with fluxes at their largest in the mid to late afternoon\nand lowest in the early hours of the morning. On average,\nfluxes were positive for most of the day, indicating the city to\nbe acting as a net source of VOC to the atmosphere, although\ndeposition was observed for short periods at night. On aver-\nage, fluxes of methanol were the largest (0.54 mg m\u22122 h\u22121),\nfollowed by acetone, (0.53 mg m\u22122 h\u22121) and acetaldehyde,\n(0.38 mg m\u22122 h\u22121), whereas fluxes of the aromatic com-\npounds benzene and toluene were lower (0.12 mg m\u22122 h\u22121\nand 0.28 mg m\u22122 h\u22121, respectively). Isoprene fluxes were\nomitted from the final analysis, as significant differences\nwere observed between the two techniques, indicating a pos-\nsible source of contamination in one or other of the systems.\nPanel A, Fig. 6, shows the average daily flux of methanol.\nTypically, fluxes of methanol started to increase at around\n06:00, rising steadily until a broad evening maximum was\nreached between 16:00 and 21:00 GMT. At this time fluxes\ndropped off sharply before levelling and reaching a minimum\nduring the early morning. Acetaldehyde fluxes (panel B) also\nhad a broad daytime peak, but in contrast to methanol, fluxes\ntended to be larger in the late morning and early afternoon.\nThe remaining three compounds each shared a similar\ntrend that saw emissions rise between 05:00 and 06:00,\nreaching a broad peak between 14:00 and 19:00 GMT. This\nafternoon maximum was reflected in measurements of traffic\ndensity (Fig. 7) taken on Oxford Road, a busy street adjacent\nto Portland Street. Measurements from this location provide\na good proxy for the relative change of the diurnal traffic\npattern in the area. They also indicate a clear morning rush\nhour peak which is not reflected in the observed fluxes. The\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 1971\u20131987, 2009\n1982 B.

Traffic density measured on Oxford Road (street adjacent to\nPortland Street). This provides a good proxy for the relative change\nof traffic activity in the local area.\nabsence of this peak in the flux measurements is not unique\nto this site (Nemitz et al., 2002) and is thought to relate to\na number of factors: firstly, flux measurements represent the\naverage surface exchange occurring over a large area, thus\nrush hour trends which may be more apparent on some roads\n(e.g. bus routes such as Oxford road) than others, become\nsmeared. Secondly, during the day there is more stationary\ntraffic, due to loading\/unloading and congestion. Thirdly, for\nmeasurements of VOCs which might partially be under tem-\nperature control, fugitive emission may become an impor-\ntant source at midday when temperatures are warmest and\nconsequently any rush hour trend within the data becomes\nsmoothed. Furthermore the use of products (e.g. cleaning\nproducts, solvents) is not likely to be linked to traffic counts.\nFinally, the fluxes presented here are an average of both\nweekday and weekend fluxes, which, as shown by Fig. 7,\nmay also dampen any rush hour trend in the data.\nRegardless of these factors it is still possible that some of\nthe flux is missed by the measurement systems, as during\nstable night-time conditions and on calm mornings\/evenings\nthe measurement site may become decoupled from the street\ncanyon below. Although this may result in damping of some\ntemporal features, the effect is somewhat reduced through\nnocturnal heat output from the city and the relatively windy\nlocation and therefore the average daily fluxes presented here\nshould provide a robust estimate of the total exchange occur-\nring throughout the day.\nThe similarities between traffic counts and VOC fluxes\nsuggest vehicle emissions to be the dominant source for\nmost VOCs, but not all. Methanol and acetaldehyde emis-\nsions showed some similarities with traffic density but were\nbroader over the day, consistent with a large contribution\nfrom fugitive sources that are coupled to a combination of\ntemperature and non-traffic anthropogenic activity such as\nsolvent use.\nIn order to compare data from the two flux techniques,\nwhich did not measure simultaneously, the average daily\nfluxes were used, thus avoiding uncertainties associated with\na changing atmosphere. Despite the indirect nature of the\ncomparison, the two flux measurement systems showed good\nagreement, with measured fluxes falling within the range\nof the standard error (\u03c3 \/\u221aN) of hourly fluxes. The high-\nest observed correlations between the DEC and vDEC tech-\nniques were observed in the fluxes of toluene and benzene,\nwhich had R2 values of 0.9 (p<0.0001; N=24) and 0.85\n(p<0.0001), respectively. Acetone (R2=0.83 p<0.0001)\nand acetaldehyde (R2=0.77 p<0.0001) also compared well,\nas did methanol (R2=0.74 p<0.0001).\nThe regression plots that accompany Fig. 6 clearly show\nan offset between the two techniques, with the vDEC flux\nmeasurements consistently higher than those made by DEC.\nThe offset was highest for acetaldehyde (46%) and lowest\nfor benzene (6%) with an average deviation of 20%. Part\nof this offset may relate to the tendency of the VOC to ad-\nsorb to the surfaces of the DFS, meaning the signal of the\n\u201cstickier\u201d compounds such as methanol is dampened. The\nmain cause however, is thought to relate to the carry-over\nof air from one DEC sample to the next, caused by the in-\ncomplete evacuation of the canister. The carry-over for our\nsystem was much larger than that reported in previous studies\n(Rinne et al., 2001) and therefore an alternative data analysis\nwas carried out, incorporating the following correction for\ncarry-over:\n\u03c7corr = (\u03c7 \u00d7 p1 \u2212 \u03c7old \u00d7 p2)\n(p1 \u2212 p2) . (2)\nHere \u03c7 is the VOC concentration within the ISR, \u03c7old is the\nprevious concentration of the same ISR, p1 is the ISR pres-\nsure when full and p2 is the ISR pressure after evacuation.\nThe correction increases the amplitude of the PTR-MS data\nand consequently gives larger flux values, as can be seen in\nFig. 6. After the correction was applied the average offset be-\ntween the two systems was reduced to less than 7%. Despite\nthis correction, DECcorr values remained lower than vDEC\nfluxes at night-time. This is thought to relate to the very short\ndwell times chosen for the vDEC method, which can result\nin limited counting statistics.\nCounting statistics cause uncertainty in the flux and the\nerror is inversely proportional to N0.5, where N is the total\nnumber of ion counts during a (25 min) flux averaging period\n(Fairall, 1984). N remains similar, independent of whether\na concentration is measured frequently with a short dwell\ntime, or less often with a longer dwell time, except for the in-\ncreased relative dead time associated with switching between\nm\/z more rapidly. However, reducing the error associated\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 1971\u20131987, 2009 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/\nB. Langford et al.: Eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC from a city 1983\nwith individual count rates on the raw DEC and vDEC data\npoints is important as it can impact upon the cross-correlation\nfunction used to calculate 1t and may thus affect the overall\nprecision of the flux measurement. When the random error\nis high, the cross-correlation becomes noisier and more dif-\nficult to interpret, reducing the measurement precision. By\nlooking for the time lag that maximises the cross correlation,\nfluxes may be systematically biased towards extreme values,\nwhich would be more important the noisier the time-series\nand the smaller the flux (i.e. during night-time). Calculating\nthe flux limit of detection by taking the standard deviation\nof the covariance function at distances far from the true lag\nwould help to eliminate such periods in the future. It should\nbe noted that, where a constant time-lag can be used, a sys-\ntematic bias should not occur.\nDuring the daytime, corrected DEC fluxes were larger than\nvDEC fluxes. Some of this difference can be explained by the\nfaster response time of the DEC system, which could resolve\nturbulent fluctuations of up to 1 Hz as opposed to 0.5 \u02d9Hz for\nthe vDEC system. Analysis of the sensible heat flux, which\nwe assume to show identical frequency behaviour as the mea-\nsured VOC, demonstrated that approximately 5% of the flux\nwas carried in this frequency range.\nThe uncertainty of flux estimates due to the disjunct sam-\npling protocol was estimated for each system using the ap-\nproach of Lenschow et al. (1994). Integral time scales (lws)\nranged between 10\u201320 s, our averaging period (T ) was 1500 s\nand our sampling intervals (1x) were\u223c0.2 s and 12 s respec-\ntively for the vDEC and DEC techniques. Sampling errors\nwere found to be <1% for the vDEC technique and between\n6 and 13% for the DEC mode. These errors are comparably\nsmall when considering uncertainties associated with geo-\nphysical variability. Errors associated with both unstable and\nneutral conditions were calculated following the method of\nWesley and Hart (1985) and were found to be 47% and 61%,\nrespectively.\n3.3 Comparison of measured VOC fluxes with NAEI\nestimates\nMeasured VOC fluxes were up-scaled and compared\nagainst the most recent (2006) emission estimate for\nManchester taken from the UK National Atmospheric\nEmission Inventory (http:\/\/www.naei.org.uk\/datachunk.php?\nf datachunk id=174). The flux estimates from the DECcorr\nsystem were used for the comparison as they did not suf-\nfer from the attenuation of high frequency flux contributions.\nIn order to compare the up-scaled fluxes with the inventory\nit was first necessary to calculate the approximate flux foot\nprint (surface area contributing to the flux) so that the appro-\npriate NAEI grid(s) could be selected for comparison.\nFootprints were calculated using a simple parameterisa-\ntion model developed by Kljun et al. (2004) which was run\nusing typical urban meteorology to give footprints under sta-\nble, neutral and convectively unstable atmospheric condi-\ntions. This model is designed for dynamically homogenous\nterrain, therefore its application to the urban environment is\nnot ideal; however there are few if any operational footprint\nmodels designed for this type of environment. Therefore the\nflux footprints obtained are treated as a first-order estimate\nonly. The following parameters were used in the model: stan-\ndard deviation of vertical wind velocity \u03c3w=0.3 m s\u22121; fric-\ntion velocity u\u2217=0.3 m s\u22121 (average measurement period);\nmeasurement height zm=95 m; roughness length z0=1.5 m\n(estimated as 1\/10th of the average building height, 15 m);\nand boundary layer height h=2000 m. The results are shown\nin Fig. 8 and list the distance at which the maximum contri-\nbution to the flux can be expected (Xmax) and the distance\nwhich 80% of the flux is contained (Xr ). A circular flux\nfootprint (radius=Xr ) was then superimposed over a map of\nNAEI grid squares and the entrained grids averaged using a\nweighting factor to account for the measured wind direction\nduring the measurement period.\nIn order to calculate an emission estimate for the flux\nfootprint using these data, it was assumed that the observed\naverage fluxes were representative of VOC emission rates\noccurring throughout the year (although the emission rates\nare likely to show some seasonality, with increased vehicle\nuse during the winter months causing higher direct emis-\nsions; this may be balanced by increased fugitive emissions\nin the summer months). Therefore the measured average\ntotal daily flux of benzene for example (2.87 mg m\u22122 d\u22121\n(DECcorr)) was extrapolated to give an annual emission es-\ntimate of 1.0 t km\u22122 yr\u22121. This value is 1.5 times greater\nthan that predicted by the NAEI (0.69 t km\u22122 yr\u22121) for the\nsame flux footprint during 2006. However, the NAEI esti-\nmate falls inside the overall error bounds of the measure-\nment (Fig. 9). Fluxes of toluene compared similarly, with\na 1.5 times difference between measurements and inventory.\nIn contrast, fluxes of the oxygenated compounds methanol\n(\u00d73.6), acetaldehyde (\u00d76.3) and acetone (\u00d74.7) were con-\nsiderably larger than the emission inventory. This outcome\nsuggests the NAEI is accurately characterising the sources\nof the aromatic compounds, whose emission is dominated\nby a single source, in this case road transport. Yet, for the\noxygenated VOCs, such as methanol or acetaldehyde, whose\nemissions may be dominated by numerous diffuse sources, it\nperforms less well. In such instances direct \u201ctop-down\u201d flux\nmeasurements may provide a more robust approach.\nPublished VOC fluxes from the urban environment are\nlimited, but fluxes have been measured above Mexico\nCity using a vDEC approach as part of the Mexico City\nMetropolitan Area 2003 field campaign. Average fluxes of\nmethanol (1.0 mg m\u22122 h\u22121), toluene (0.83 mg m\u22122 h\u22121) and\nacetone (0.39 mg m\u22122 h\u22121) were found to be up to three\ntimes higher than those observed in Manchester (Velasco et\nal., 2005). This is unsurprising given the much older vehi-\ncle fleet, less dominance of catalytic converters and poorer\nfuel quality in Mexico City, where vehicle emissions are not\nregulated by the Geneva (UN ECE, 1991) and Gothenburg\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/1971\/2009\/ Atmos.

Error bars show the un-\ncertainty of the emission estimate based on the standard error of the\nflux averages.\n(UN ECE, 1999) multi-pollutant protocols as is the case in\nthe UK. By comparison, recent measurements of VOC fluxes\nby REA over Houston, Texas, (Park et al., 2008) derived\nfluxes in the range \u22120.36 to 3.1 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 for benzene and\n\u22120.47 to 5.04 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 for toluene.\n4 Conclusions\nIn the past the virtual and disjunct eddy covariance tech-\nniques have been successfully applied to give flux informa-\ntion from a range of vegetation canopies. In the present study\nwe have shown that these techniques can be extended to the\nurban environment provided a measurement site with suit-\nable elevation above street level can be found. We have also\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and limitations of each ap-\nproach. The vDEC technique is thought to be more suited\nfor urban flux work due to its relative simplicity, although\nlonger dwell times are needed to avoid errors associated with\nlimited counting statistics.\nEmission estimates derived from flux data demonstrate the\npotential of using VOC flux measurements in determining\nemission estimates on a city wide scale. Although emis-\nsion estimates obtained in this study are based on a \u201csnap\nshot\u201d of the total annual emission, they demonstrate the po-\ntential of the technique, which, if deployed on a longer time\nscale, such as a year, could give very detailed information on\nurban-scale emissions, including both spatial and, more im-\nportantly, temporal trends, which are currently not accounted\nfor in the NAEI emission estimates.\nAcknowledgements.
