INTRODUCTION\nThe expanding applications for microwave communication\nsystems have generated a need for compact, high-performance\nmicrowave circuits with integrated antennas. In this paper, we\npropose a novel antenna structure capable of high radiation\nefficiency suitable for use in multilayer microwave circuits.\nThe traveling wave feed system offers high quality circular\npolarization which is a key requirement for many existing and\ndeveloping mobile communication systems. The proposed\ndesign can be fabricated using thick film technology, thus\nsatisfying the demand for high volume microwave circuits at\nlow cost.\nThe proposed antenna uses a low permittivity dielectric\nlayer printed on a high permittivity substrate, as shown in fig.\n1, to improve the fringing fields at the edges of the radiation\npatches. The work is an extension of the concept using strips\nof low dielectric constant material underneath the radiation\nedges of a patch to enhance radiation efficiency [1]. In the\nproposed design the low dielectric constant material is placed\non top of the high permittivity substrate, thus forming a\nmultilayer structure. The antenna comprises three substrate\nlayers with a patch array fed by two half circular microstrip\nchannels, compensating for the progressive loss in signal. A\ntheoretical investigation based on electromagnetic simulation\nwas performed to validate the new radiation efficiency\nenhanced antenna at 20GHz.\nII. ANTENNA THEORY AND STRUCTURE\nThe structure of the radiation enhanced CP antenna is\nillustrated in fig. 2. The antenna is composed of 8 planar\nrectangular radiating patches. Each patch is linearly polarized\nand has dimensions Lp and Wp, where Lp is the resonant\nInput Port 1 4 Output Port 3\nr~~~~~~~~Z ii iY\nMicrostrip Feed Line -=sicrostrip Feed Line\nBottom Layer Middle Layer\nI. ..\n... 1\nIL i g<Distance- Patch\nI\n.... ..\ncentreto Patch\nn cent re - ?8\nWs2 !L 4\n..JLp\nRadiating |\nPatche s - To pN\nLayer 'C\nOutput I\nPor: 2 ti g Via- Inpujtforthe second\n;lel half of the rincg\nFigure 2.

The patches are excited with a progressive\nphase lag of 450 because there is an annular spacing of )\/8\nbetween the patches, thus leading to circular polarization. The\nbasic design concept of the antenna was originally established\nby K. Lum and C. Free[2].\nThe antenna feed is through a circular 50Q microstrip\nchannel, of width Ws, and Ws2, which runs on top of the first\nsubstrate and on top of the second substrate respectively. The\nfeed is divided into two half rings splitting the power from the\nfeed to the patches. The power in from the feed on the bottom\nlayer is fed through to the feed in the middle layer through a\nvia. Each patch was matched to the respective microstrip line.\nA portion of the signal travelling in the bottom layer feed line\nwill successively excite each patch. The second half of the\npatch array is then successively excited through the middle\nlayer feed line, therefore compensating for the progressive loss\nof signal in the feed.\nSimulated data was obtained for a test antenna made on\nAlumina ADS-96R with the following parameters: substrate\nthickness h = 0.254 mm, substrate dielectric constant Fr = 9.8.\nThe key antenna dimensions were:\nLength of the patch Wp = 6.9mm\nWidth of the patch Lp = 2.9mm\nWidth of the microstrip line Ws, = 0.248mm Ws2 = 0.578mm\nDiameter of the circular microstrip line channel = 16.4mm\nCircuit dimensions = 50.8mm x 50.8mm\nAs illustrated in fig. 3 a low dielectric constant material was\nplaced beneath the patches to improve the efficiency of the\nradiation. One of the key parameters affecting radiation\nefficiency is the dielectric constant. The lower the dielectric\nconstant, the less the concentration of energy in the substrate.\nTherefore more radiation occurs. The high dielectric constant\nsubstrate material reduces the radiation. This is because the\nmost of the EM field is then concentrated in the dielectric\nbetween the conductive patch and the ground plane. The low\ndielectric constant material used was KQ150 (Heraeus Inc)\nwith a dielectric constant of 3.9. Dielectric layer thickness was\nfabricated to be 50pm. The presence of the low dielectric\nmaterial increases the intensity of the electric field distribution\nat the radiating edges of the patch.\nThe coupling between the two microstrip feed lines was\nminimized by a dielectric layer of 100um. The same low\ndielectric constant KQ150 (Heraeus Inc) was used to avoid\ncoupling between the microstrip feed lines whilst contributing\nto the enhancement of radiation.\nRADIATING PATCHES\nSUBSTRATE LAYER 3 -\nKQ150 (50um)\nSUBSTRATE LAYER 2 -\nKQ150(100um)\nMICROSTRIP FEED\nWs2\nVIA-CONNECTING\nWs2TOWsl\nMICROSTRIP FEED Wsl\nSUBSTRATE LAYER 1 -\nALUMINA (254um)\nGROUND PLANE\nFigure 3.

This is\nslightly different from the designed value of 20GHz because no\nmatching was included to account for the reactance presented\nby the patches to the feed line. As seen from fig. 4, the return\nloss of the antenna is -35.58dB at 20.3GHz. In this antenna\nstructure the traveling wave can reflect, radiate or dissipate\npower in the substrate. By determining S21 and S31, we can\nfind the amount of power dissipated in the antenna. If we\nassume that the amount of signal dissipated in the substrate is\nnegligible, then S21 and S31 indicate the percentage of power\nthat is radiated. The reflection is negligible, as shown from the\nhigh return loss in fig 4. Therefore most of the signal traveling\nthrough the feed has been radiated. S21 and S31 were found to\nbe -15.86dB and -11.07dB, respectively, for the above design.\nThus, indicating radiation loss between the input port and the\nrespective output ports.\nFurthermore, from fig 5. the radiated power from the\nantenna design was calculated to be 90% of the input power at\nthe optimum frequency of operation, 20.3GHz. The bandwidth\nof the antenna was 120MHz. Therefore the design is\nconsidered to be useful for practical narrowband applications.\nIV. ANTENNA ON POLYMER\nThis type of antenna structure was also investigated using\npolymer material for all three layers. Simulated data was\nobtained for a test antenna with the following parameters:\nsubstrate thickness for each layer h = 0.127mm and substrate\ndielectric constant Fr = 2.5\nThe key antenna dimensions were:\nLength of the patch Wp = 4.6mm\nWidth of the patch Lp = 4.1mm\nWidth of the microstrip line Ws, = 0.35mm Ws2 = 0.744mm\nDiameter of the circular microstrip line channel = 29.6mm\nCircuit dimensions = 35mm x 50mm\n0S4J-\nD_J-\na_m\n_3-\n0.J-\nmr4\nm5 7 freq2DA0GHz\nfrecq 24G.\nmag()-0701U m,4\nm6\nfreq-21. 4G,Hz\nm mag(x-.83\n.... ... ...... ....\n19.SU 19M 19-i; 19-95 2Sal 2D51 2J1E1 21AS 2J2- 20.5 2J1M 2J- 20AU20AS2J.

This\nis slightly different from the designed value of 20GHz because\nno matching was included to account for the reactance\npresented by the patches to the feed line. As seen from Fig. 6,\nthe return loss of the antenna is -10.92dB at 20.44GHz. The\nreflection is negligible, as shown from the high return loss in\nfig 6. Therefore most of the signal traveling through the feed\nhas been radiated. S21 and S31 are calculated to be -18.02dB\nand -13.895dB respectively for the above design. Thus,\nindicating radiation loss between the input port and the\nrespective output ports.\nFurthermore, using the data from fig 7. the radiated power\nfrom the antenna design was calculated to be 87% of the input\npower at the optimum frequency of operation, 20.4GHz. The\nbandwidth of the antenna is 300MHz.\nV.

CONCLUSION\nThe concept of a novel circular polarized patch antenna has\nbeen established. In this paper an extension to the basic antenna\ndesign was investigated, and was shown to have beneficial\neffects.
