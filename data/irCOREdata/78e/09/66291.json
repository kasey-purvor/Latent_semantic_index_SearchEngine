Three of\nthe dives made a 26-km-long traverse across the ridge during which 14 gravity measurements\nwere made. The observations confirm the presence of active thrust faulting on the 1.1-km-\nhigh south face of the ridge. However, the gravity precludes the existence of a simple low-\nangle thrust, and is only compatible with significant crustal shortening and thickening if the\nblock to the south of the thrust has a lower density than the overriding block. Visual and\nsonar observations of pervasive fine-scale tectonism in this area lend some support to this\nidea. Alternatively, there could be oblique thrusting on a high-angle fault with relatively little\ncrustal shortening. In addition, a small degree of crustal shortening may take place in the form\nof buckling of an elastic or plastic lithosphere, though this cannot explain the strong asymmetry\nof the ridge, which we believe must imply faulting.\nKey words: compression, gravity anomalies, lithospheric deformation, mid-ocean ridges,\noceanic lithosphere, plate convergence.\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe Easter microplate is a small piece of oceanic lithosphere about\n400 km across that is accreting and rapidly rotating between two sub-\nparallel branches of the East Pacific Rise (EPR; Herron 1972; Hand-\nschumacher et al. 1981; Hey et al. 1985; Zukin & Francheteau 1990;\nNaar & Hey 1991; Rusby1992; Rusby & Searle 1995), Fig. 1. Mag-\nnetic anomalies, earthquake mechanisms and kinematic modelling\nshow that it is rotating clockwise relative to the Pacific and Nazca\nplates, which bound it (Anderson et al. 1974; Handschumacher et al.\n1981; Engeln & Stein 1984; Naar & Hey 1991; Schouten et al. 1993;\nRusby & Searle 1995). The Easter\u2013Nazca pole of relative rotation\nis near 22.6\u25e6S, 112.4\u25e6W with a rotation rate of 15\u25e6 Ma\u22121 (Naar &\nHey 1989; Rusby & Searle 1995).\nAlthough most of the neighbouring Pacific and Nazca plates ap-\npear to be rigid and undeformed, a small area some 100 km across to\nthe north of the main northern boundary of the microplate appears to\nbe undergoing diffuse compressional deformation as the microplate\nrotates against the Nazca plate to its north. This deformation is man-\nifested by the production of several major E\u2013W ridges, intraplate\nseismicity, and anomalies in the recent seafloor spreading history\non the East Pacific Rise just to the west of this area (Engeln & Stein\n1984; Hey et al. 1985; Naar & Hey 1989; Searle et al. 1989; Naar &\nHey 1991; Rusby & Searle 1993, 1995; Delouis et al. 1998). Similar\nfeatures exist in the corresponding position north of the nearby and\nsimilarly evolving Juan Fernandez microplate (Larson et al. 1992;\nSearle et al. 1993; Bird et al. 1998).\nRusby & Searle (1993) made a detailed study of this area based\non long-range sidescan sonar (GLORIA), multibeam echosounding\nand seismicity data (Fig. 1). At least 10 E\u2013W ridges are located\nin a broad swathe trending WNW from the northern tip of the mi-\ncroplate\u2019s east rift, of which the most prominent are indicated by\nshading on Fig. 1. All have steep south-facing scarps and gentler\nN-dipping slopes. Relief is substantial, up to 1.4 km. The positions\nof the ridges coincide with a broad cluster of earthquakes, several\nof which have focal mechanism solutions (Dziewonski et al. 1981;\nEngeln & Stein 1984; Delouis et al. 1998, Fig. 1). Three of these\n(1, 5 and 6 in Fig. 1) are strike-slip with their P axes along the pre-\ndicted compressional direction; two (2 and 4) are strike-slip with\nminor compression. For number 3 the best solution is pure thrust\nalong the predicted compressional direction, though there could be\nup to 30 per cent strike-slip (Engeln & Stein 1984). Delouis et al.\n(1998) analysed the 1996 May 9 magnitude 7.1 earthquake (num-\nber 7) using broad-band data. They showed that the best-fit focal\nmechanism is a downdip oblique (N60\u25e6E) rupture on a low angle\n(15\u25e6) NNE-dipping thrust, with a nucleation depth of 1 \u00b1 1 km\nbelow the seafloor.\nThe tectonic spreading fabric on the Nazca lithosphere around the\nridges consists of small-amplitude normal faults and abyssal hills\nthat parallel the present EPR axis. The ridges frequently truncate this\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors 359\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n360 R. C. Searle, J. Francheteau and R. Armijo\nFigure 1.

These swings in the azimuth\nof the fabric are similar to those that are elsewhere associated with\nthe traces of non-transform offsets (Macdonald et al. 1988).\nKinematic modelling using the best-fit Easter\u2013Nazca pole of ro-\ntation (\u221222.7\u25e6, \u2212112.3\u25e6; Rusby & Searle 1995) predicts compres-\nsional relative motion in this region, ranging from very small, N di-\nrected motion near the pole, to a maximum of 54 km Ma\u22121 directed\nalong 024\u25e6 near 22\u25e6S, 114\u25e6W (Fig. 1). The latter would integrate\nto a total of about 50 km over the 0.9 Ma age of this seafloor. In\nfact much of this compressive strain is probably localized along the\n\u2018Pito Fracture Zone\u2019 (Francheteau et al. 1988; Zukin & Francheteau\n1990), which demarcates the main northern boundary of the mi-\ncroplate at 23\u25e6N. Nevertheless, the ridges to the north have compa-\nrable relief to that on the Pito Fracture Zone, suggesting that they\nmay accommodate a significant proportion of the strain, although it\nis probably distributed between them. Opening rates on the EPR fall\nfrom about 152 km Ma\u22121 near 21\u25e6S (Perram et al. 1990; Naar & Hey\n1991; Rusby & Searle 1995) to 130 km Ma\u22121 at 22.6\u25e6S (Naar & Hey\n1991). This 22 km Ma\u22121 difference has been attributed to extended\ndeformation of the Nazca plate immediately north of 23\u25e6S (Searle\net al. 1989; Perram et al. 1990; Naar & Hey 1991; Rusby & Searle\n1993). If the horizontal area of the plate is approximately conserved\nduring deformation, the N\u2013S compressional strain should also be\nabout 22 km Ma\u22121, roughly the average of that predicted by the\npole of rotation. The summed strain over the more westerly ridges\nhas been estimated to be of the order of 10 km (Rusby & Searle\n1993).\nIn 1993 November the French manned submersible Nautile was\ndeployed on a 21-dive programme around the boundary of the Easter\nmicroplate (Francheteau et al. 1994; Cogne\u00b4 et al. 1995; Hey et al.\n2002; Searle et al. 2003; Naar et al. 2004). As part of that pro-\ngramme, four dives were devoted to investigating the compressional\ndeformation in one of the ridges north of the microplate. Major ob-\njectives were to determine the nature of the compressional strain\nusing structural observations and the amount of strain using gravity\nmeasurements, in order to deduce the amount of crustal thickening.\nWe here report the results of that study.\nWe find abundant evidence for active faulting on the south-facing\nscarps, with indications that at least the shallow deformation is by\nthrust faulting. However, the gravity data show that for a constant\ndensity crust the amount of thickening must be quite minor, although\nthe data are compatible with shortening of \u223c3.5 km and consequent\nthickening of \u223c1.2 km if the crust south of the ridge has a slightly\nlower density than that to the north. Alternatively, the ridges might\nhave been formed by oblique, low-rake thrusting along high-dip fault\nplanes. A small amount of compression may be accommodated by\nplate buckling.\nS T U DY A R E A\nOur dives concentrated on the largest of the E\u2013W ridges, which is\nsituated at 21\u25e655\u2032S, 113\u25e640\u2032W (Fig. 2). It is near the northern and\nwestern limits of the deformed area, 110 km north of the main mi-\ncroplate boundary and 60 km east of the East Pacific rise axis on\nseafloor whose 0.9 Ma age is well constrained by magnetic anoma-\nlies (Rusby & Searle 1995). This ridge was chosen because of its\nsize, reasonably good bathymetric coverage, and relatively large\ndistance from the Easter\u2013Nazca rotation pole implying the possi-\nbility of significant crustal shortening and thickening. The ridge is\nabout 40 km long (Fig. 1), approximately 10 km wide, and has a\n10 km N\u2013S jog half way along, which has been interpreted as a\nsinistral transfer zone (Rusby & Searle 1993). It has a maximum\nheight of 1.4 km. Its southern boundary is a steep escarpment fac-\ning south, while the northern flank dips gently to the north; it has a\nbroad, 400-m-deep depression to its south.

The East Pacific Rise to the west shows no un-\nusual features, although there is a small overlapping spreading cen-\ntre at 22\u25e608\u2032S (Rusby & Searle 1995). The tectonic spreading fabric\naround the EW ridges looks normal. Sometimes there is a small\ndextral swing from 10\u25e6 in the north to SSW at the ridge crest; it then\nbecomes N\u2013S south of the ridge (Rusby & Searle 1993). An unusual\nfeature of this area is that the GLORIA acoustic backscatter between\nN\u2013S fault scarps (i.e. what should be normally sedimented seafloor)\nis considerably higher south of the ridge than to the north (Fig. 2b).\nThis would suggest rougher or less sedimented seafloor, and has\nbeen interpreted as evidence of pervasive tectonic disruption in the\nregion (Rusby & Searle 1993).\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n362 R.

Three (dives 12, 13 and 14; observer Searle) to-\ngether constituted a 26-km-long N\u2013S traverse across the ridge at\n113\u25e641\u2032W (Fig. 2). This position was chosen because it is near the\ncentre of one of the linear, E\u2013W parts of the ridge and is covered\nby a Sea Beam data swathe. At this point the ridge is 1.3 km high.\nThe submersible was navigated by occasional fixes from a short\nbaseline acoustic navigation system and (particularly for dives 12\nand 14) by dead reckoning using the submersible\u2019s on-board log\nand gyro between fixes. Gravity measurements were made every\n2 km along the traverse, and visual observations were conducted\ncontinuously en route between the stations, to build up the seafloor\ngeological section shown in Fig. 3. A fourth dive (dive 15; observer\nArmijo) investigated the tectonic structures where the escarpment\nmakes contact with the seafloor to the south, near the transfer zone\nat 113\u25e650\u2032W (Fig. 4). No gravity measurements were made on this\ndive.\nFigure 4. Detailed map of dive 15 along the base of the escarpment, showing depth (contour interval 100 m) and seafloor geology.

It is characterized by a thin drape of\npelagic sediment covering 50 per cent or more of the seafloor, with\noccasional outcrops of pillow basalt, mostly along old, N\u2013S trending\nfault scarps that we interpret as having been formed at the East\nPacific Rise axis. There are small deposits of fresh talus at the feet\nof some of these scarps, and occasional fissures characterized by\nlines of fresh basaltic talus either in shallow linear depressions or\non flat, sedimented seafloor. One E\u2013W fault, offset 50 m down to\nthe north, was encountered about 9 km north of the crest of the E\u2013W\nridge, but with no fresh talus. Thus, any signs of recent tectonism\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nCompressional deformation north of Easter microplate 363\nnorth of the ridge are relatively minor. This situation does not change\nuntil the very lip of the escarpment, where crevasses appear as the\nseafloor breaks away under the influence of gravity at the edge of\nthe scarp.\nSouth of the escarpment: dive 14 and first part of dive 15\nIn contrast, the seafloor south of the escarpment is undergoing ac-\ntive, pervasive, small-scale tectonism. The proportion of sediment-\ncovered seafloor is everywhere less than 50 per cent, with almost\nno sediment between 1.5 and 3.5 km south of the ridge on dive 14.\nBetween here and the base of the escarpment the sediment cover\nincreases somewhat (though always less than 50 per cent), perhaps\nas a result of redistribution from the escarpment itself and ponding\nin the depression at its foot. There are ubiquitous outcrops of pil-\nlow basalts, which often display some local fracturing. There are\noccasional small fault scarps with a variety of trends and some with\nevidence of recent activity. Occasional narrow, partially open, N\u2013S\ntrending fissures occur, ranging from small, centimetre-wide cracks\nin pillows, via shallow trenches full of talus, to linear sheets or \u2018rivers\nof stone\u2019. These latter are linear deposits hundreds of metres long\nand up to tens of metres wide, with no discernible vertical relief,\nand mostly aligned N\u2013S. They are similar to features first seen in\nthe FAMOUS area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and described as fis-\nsures (Ballard & Moore 1977), although there is no indication of a\ngap or down-dropped interior. All these fissures follow a trend of\napproximately 010\u25e6, close to that expected for EPR faults, though\nfew such faults were seen. Possibly the fissures are controlled by or\nmark reactivations of such faults.\nMore common than these fissures are extensive, flat-lying, fresh,\ndiffuse fields of unsedimented talus. Apparently in situ pillows and\nbroken pillows sometimes jut through the talus sheets, giving the\nimpression that the sheets are thin, perhaps only a few metres thick.\nAll of this talus appears to have been formed in situ, and is rarely\nassociated with significant scarps or other topographic relief, which\nis in any case rarely greater than 20 m. The overall impression is\nof vast areas of pillow basalts, of which 80\u2013100 per cent have been\npervasively broken up in situ. We interpret the extensive talus as\narising from numerous recently active fissures and\/or small-scale\nstrike-slip but not dip-slip faulting. This explains the GLORIA data,\nwhich show brighter acoustic backscattering south of the escarp-\nment. Overall, the areas of basaltic outcrop and talus are about equal,\nand together exceed the area of sediment. Except where covered by\nsediment in the shallow trough at the foot of the scarp, the degree\nof tectonism and amount of talus and basalt outcrop all increase\nfrom south to north as the scarp is approached, although even at the\nsouthern end of the traverse, about 8 km south of the scarp, there is\nmore basalt outcrop and less sediment than anywhere north of the\nscarp.\nThe foot of the escarpment: end of dive 14\nand most of dive 15\nApproaching the foot of the escarpment at the end of dive 14, we\nobserved a fine grey dust, inferred to be derived from the break-up\nof igneous rocks in the escarpment. This began to appear on the\nsurface of the normally cream-to-brown pelagic sediment, starting\nabout 500 m to the south of the scarp. At about 400 m from the\nscarp we encountered the first of several occurrences of a distinctive,\npaler, more brown-coloured, finer-grained and blockier talus than\nthe greyer pillow fragments seen farther south. Two samples of this\ntalus taken at station 14-5 at the base of the escarpment proved to be\naphyric basalt. A second occurrence of this talus occurred at the end\nof dive 14 and culminated in a 2-m-high south-facing step\u2014possibly\na pressure ridge (see below) with a small sedimented terrace above.\nThis was followed immediately to the north by the start of the main\ntalus ramp of the escarpment.\nDive 15 approached the escarpment from the south on a northerly\nheading. As on dive 14, the very bottom of the escarpment is marked\nby a small, south-facing, E\u2013W scarp (about 0.5 m high) at whose\ncrest is a rounded and fissured ridge which we interpret as a pres-\nsure ridge (Fig. 4). Again, the main talus ramp begins immediately\nabove this. Above the pressure ridge is a 10-m-high outcrop of older,\nyellowish, slightly consolidated talus in the form of spurs that taper\ndownwards. These have chutes of active talus between them, which\nmerge into a slope of fresh, homogeneous talus at the base of the\noutcrop.\nHereafter the submersible turned onto a variable but generally\neast-north\u2013easterly heading to follow the foot of the escarpment.\nA similar pressure ridge was encountered intermittently along the\nfoot, just above the contact between flat seafloor and the actively\nmoving talus. It usually had a summit fissure, striking parallel or\nsubparallel to the edge of the escarpment. Both the pressure ridge\nand the linear break of slope at the foot of the escarpment were often\nburied under jutting mounds of fresh talus. Small sag ponds and\nobliquely trending fissures (striking between N\u2013S and 075\u25e6) were\nalso encountered. We interpret these observations as indicative of a\nthrust faulting environment.\nThe face of the escarpment: dive 13\nDive 13 climbed the entire face of the escarpment where it strikes\nE\u2013W. As on dive 15, at its foot there is a sharp boundary between a\ntalus wedge and the fairly flat seafloor to the south. The lowermost\n100 m of the escarpment consists of pure, well-sorted, unsedimented\ntalus. This comprises both typical pie-slice-shaped pillow fragments\nand more blocky fragments; samples of both were collected and\nfound to be basalt, not (as initially suspected for the blocks) dolerite\nfrom dykes. Above the basal talus pile the scarp face remains exten-\nsively covered with fresh talus, but talus sheets parallel to the E\u2013W\nscarp face are interspersed with talus streams aligned down-slope in\nthe bottoms of gullies that are bounded by outcropping \u2018buttresses\u2019\nor spurs like those seen on dive 15. The gullies are spaced a few\ntens of metres apart and are several metres deep. As on dive 15, the\nbuttresses appear to consist of indurated breccia of pillow fragments\nin a sediment matrix, but were not sampled. We infer that they are\nthe products of earlier episodes of faulting and mass-wasting. Brec-\ncia outcrops, gullies, and talus sheets paralleling the main slope are\ninterspersed up the escarpment.\nBetween 180 and 750 m above the foot of the scarp, five small,\nsouth-dipping faults were seen. Four were E\u2013W and one struck 060\u25e6.\nThey were usually recognized by terraces or shallow basins at their\ncrests that are a few metres wide and dip northwards into the main\nscarp face, and are partially filled with sediment or talus. Some of\nthese faults had exposed faces of breccia just below their crests. A\nnumber of fissures were seen near the top of the escarpment, but with\nno consistent trend. Rather, they appear to control (or be controlled\nby) the local topography as the top of the slope begins to fail under\ngravity.\nThe lowermost 750 m of the scarp has a mean slope of 31\u25e6. Above\nthis the slope lessens, the proportion of breccia decreases and the\nproportion of sediment increases. The talus becomes less well sorted\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n364 R. C. Searle, J. Francheteau and R. Armijo\nand the largest blocks get bigger, reaching half-pillow size or larger\ntowards the top. The last talus is 1115 m above the foot of the basal\ntalus ramp and only 30 m below the crest of the escarpment. The\naverage slope over the whole 1.1-km-high escarpment is 28\u25e6.\nThe overall impression of this escarpment is that it is characterized\nby extensive, active mass wasting. Its top is collapsing under gravity\nwhile a talus wedge accumulates at its foot.\nG R AV I T Y M E A S U R E M E N T S\nGravity was measured inside the submersible using a portable \u2018small\ncase\u2019 LaCoste and Romberg geodetic gravity meter. Results are\npresented in Table 1. Because the \u2018geodetic\u2019 meters have univer-\nsal scales, there was no need to reset the scale between any of\nthe seabed stations or between ties (for drift) made at the near-\nest port (Hangaroa, Easter Island). Drift from start to end of the\n3-week cruise was 0.2 mGal. At each seafloor station the sub-\nmersible landed and was made negatively buoyant. It took some\n10 min to stabilize, whereupon a reading could be taken. Despite\ntaking great care to minimize movement of personnel, it was hard to\nkeep the submersible completely still, and usually the gravity meter\nbeam retained a residual small oscillation. The estimated reading ac-\ncuracy was \u00b10.5 mGal. As a further check, we attempted to repeat\none station exactly at the foot of the scarp on separate dives (sta-\ntions 13-1 and 14-5, Table 1). Because of navigational uncertainties\nit was impossible to relocate the first station exactly, but post-dive\nanalysis showed they are separated by some 100 m horizontally and\n26 m vertically. Their computed free-air anomalies agree to within\n3.3 mGal, in a position where the regional free-air gradient is about\n38 mGal km\u22121 (Table 1).\nReadings were taken on locally flat areas to minimize the effects\nof poorly known terrain variations near the station. Navigation was\nby a combination of acoustic navigation at the start and end of each\ndive, and dead reckoning based on the submersible\u2019s log in between.\nThe observed gravity was corrected for latitude and the normal\nfree-air variation, to produce a seabed free-air anomaly (Table 1).\nThe tabled anomalies are relative to the southernmost station on the\ntraverse, arbitrarily taken as zero.

Nevertheless, at the ends of the pro-\nfile, where these effects should be negligible, the anomalies for all\ndensities are lower at the southern end than at the north. This is the\nopposite of what would be expected if there were significant crustal\nthickening under the ridge. Applying Nettleton\u2019s (1939) method of\nestimating densities (i.e. seeking the minimum correlation between\nBouguer anomaly and topography), suggests that the most appropri-\nate crustal density is about 2600 kg m\u22123, although as we show below,\ndetailed modelling suggests a somewhat higher density is more ap-\npropriate. However, even with full terrain corrections applied, we\nfind that modelling marine Bouguer anomalies is not particularly\nintuitive, and instead we prefer to model the free-air anomaly as\ndescribed below.\nModelling method\nThe free-air anomaly incorporates corrections for latitude (correct-\ning for the Earth\u2019s ellipticity and centrifugal acceleration) and ele-\nvation or depth (correcting for distance from the Earth\u2019s centre of\nmass, but not for the local effect of the intervening rock or water). We\nmodel the free-air anomaly by computing the complete gravitational\neffect of the model, including rock and water layers, at the positions\nof the observation stations on the seabed. The effect of the overly-\ning water layer is thus explicitly included in the modelling. This is\nequivalent to modelling the seabed Bouguer anomaly as the effect of\nanomalous masses relative to an assumed constant density rock layer\nextending down from sea level but, as stated above, is more intuitive,\nsince the whole model is seen, not just the anomalous masses. Mod-\nelling used the Talwani 2-D algorithm (Talwani & Heirtzler 1964).\nThis can easily compute the effect of the overlying water layer, but\none must ensure that proper account is taken of the quadrant when\ncomputing the arctangent for points above the observation level; we\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nCompressional deformation north of Easter microplate 365\nFigure 5. Gravity anomalies (top) above depth profile along the N\u2013S transect. FWA: free-water anomaly; BA2800: Bouguer anomaly for a crustal density of\n2800 kg m\u22123, etc.\nfound that some common implementations of the algorithm may\nnot do this. By modelling the actual shape of the seafloor profile,\na 2-D terrain correction is automatically included. In view of the\nextreme linearity of the ridge in the region of our profile, any 3-D\neffects should be small. In order to facilitate comparison between\nobserved and computed anomalies, an arbitrary constant has been\nadded to the observed anomalies in each model so that the average\ncomputed anomaly is equal to the average observed anomaly. This\nis equivalent to adding a small layer of arbitrary constant thickness\nand density to the base of each model.\nGravity interpretation is notoriously ambiguous, and it is often\neasy to obtain a good fit by making many minor adjustments to a\nmodel, such as the precise position of the Moho or small lateral vari-\nations in crustal density. We have avoided this by specifying only a\nminimum number of constraints in each model. In all the models,\nsea water and mantle densities were assumed to be 1030 and 3400\nkg m\u22123, respectively. We then explored a range of gravity models\nin which the only variables were presence or absence of a fault, its\ndip, the degree of plate convergence and the densities of the crust\non either side of the fault. Where crustal convergence is a charac-\nteristic of a model, the lower boundary of the crust was determined\nby conserving the volume of crust as convergence occurs. The main\ncharacteristics of typical models are summarized in Table 2, and a\nselection of these are illustrated in Fig. 6. In addition to the observed\nand computed gravity anomalies, Fig. 6 shows the calculated verti-\ncal stress (i.e. the pressure) at the base of the model, ignoring any\ndynamic forces such as bending moments. Any departure from a\nconstant stress is a measure of the degree of departure from local\nisostatic equilibrium.\nModelling results\nFirst, we consider a model in which there is local Airy isostasy ev-\nerywhere (model 7A, Fig. 6a). This under predicts the observed\nanomaly by 16 mGal rms (Table 2), clearly showing that the\nridge is out of local isostatic equilibrium and must be dynamically\nsupported.\nAs stated above, it is hard to predict the exact amount of com-\npressive strain that should be associated with this one ridge. The\nmaximum, if all the strain were concentrated here, would be about\n50 km. A minimum value is that required to produce the observed\n1.1 km of vertical offset. In the latter case, assuming a 20\u25e6 thrust\nwith motion perpendicular to the ridge yields a horizontal shorten-\ning of 3.5 km for local crustal thickening of up to 1.1 km. Such\na crustal section should yield a seafloor gravity anomaly of up to\n21 mGal compared to a uniform crust.\nFig. 6(c) shows such a model (model 3A) with a constant crustal\ndensity of 2800 kg m\u22123, 3.5 km of shortening, and a thrust fault\ndipping at 20\u25e6 to the north. There are rms and maximum misfits\nof 4.9 mGal and 7.9 mGal, respectively, between observed and\nmodelled anomalies, for what was thought to be a realistic, even\nminimal, model of crustal shortening. Using a lower crustal density\nof 2600 kg m\u22123 (model 3E, Table 2) yields a much worse fit (misfit\n12.5 mGal rms, 20.8 mGal maximum).\nSurprisingly, the best fit between observed and modelled anoma-\nlies is for a uniform crust of constant thickness and density (model\n2A, Fig. 6b). This gives rms and maximum misfits of 2.0 and\n5.0 mGal, respectively, which is considered to be acceptable in view\nof the estimated observational errors. The average crustal density\nof 2800 kg m\u22123 in this model is quite high for oceanic crust, but as\nwith the thrust model, lower values give a poorer fit. For example,\na value of 2600 kg m\u22123 gives rms and maximum misfits of 4.2 and\n8.9 mGal (model 1A, Table 2), although this is still marginally bet-\nter than model 3A with crustal thickening. Using a multilayer crust\nmakes little difference to the model fit. Other configurations with a\ncrustal density of 2600 kg m\u22123 also give poor fits (models 3E, 5B,\nTable 2).\nThat the best-fit model would have a constant crustal thickness\nwas completely unexpected, and suggests that the observed ridge\ntopography may be entirely dynamically supported with little or no\ncrustal thickening. However, a possible resolution is suggested by\nthe observation of pervasive tectonism on the seafloor south of the\nridge. If this tectonism has lowered the crustal density of the over-\nridden block by extensive fissuring, the gravity can be successfully\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n366 R.

(c) Model 3A, representing 3.5 km of crustal\nshortening along a 20\u25e6 thrust fault and consequent 1.1 km crustal thickening,\nwith 2800 kg m\u22123 crust.

(d) Preferred model (4B),\nshowing the same shortening and crustal thickening as model 3A, but with\ncrustal density of 2800 kg m\u22123 north of the ridge and slightly lower density\nof 2750 kg m\u22123 to the south. A similar model with the intracrustal density\nboundary along the 20\u25e6 fault plane (model 4E, Table 2) yields a slightly\ngreater rms misfit of 3.7 mGal.

If\nwe retain a density of 2800 kg m\u22123 for the northern (overriding)\nblock and reduce the density of the southern block by 50 kg m\u22123 to\n2750 kg m\u22123, with the boundary between the two densities along a\nFigure 6. (Continued.)\n20\u25e6 N-dipping fault, we achieve a somewhat improved fit with rms\nand maximum misfits of 3.7 and 7.6 mGal (model 4E, Table 2).\nAlthough we might expect this lower density to characterize the\nwhole of the footwall block, a slightly better fit (rms and maximum\nresiduals of 2.8 and 6.1 mGal) is obtained if the low-density crust\nis confined to the area south of the ridge crest (model 4B, Fig. 6d).\nThis degree of misfit is only slightly worse than that for the constant\ncrustal thickness model 2A.\nWe may expect lowered densities in the brecciated crust under the\nescarpment itself. However, modelling this does not improve the fit.\nFor instance, reducing the density of the overriding wedge south of\nthe ridge crest and shallower than the ridge foot to 2600 kg m\u22123\nin model 4B increases the rms misfit from 2.8 to 4.0 mGal; lower\ndensities make the fit even worse.\nSo far we have considered low-angle thrusting, but in theory a\nthrust could dip up to 45\u25e6. Models 5, 5A, 5B and 6 consider this\ncase. The best fit (3.3 mGal rms) is for model 5 with a constant 2800\nkg m\u22123 crust (Fig. 6e), almost as good as model 4B.\nIt is possible that a component of compressional motion can be\naccommodated on a higher angle fault if the net motion is oblique\nto the fault plane, so that the rake (the dip of the component of\nrelative motion along the fault plane) does not exceed 45\u25e6; in other\nwords, transpressional faulting. The predicted relative motion di-\nrection from the Nazca\u2013Easter pole where our traverse crosses the\nridge is 028\u25e6 (Fig. 1), and thrusting at 45\u25e6 dip along 028\u25e6 then re-\nsolves into a dip of 48.6\u25e6 along our traverse, so the difference is not\nvery great.\nIn conclusion, model 4B is our best fit and, therefore, preferred\nmodel, and as such is highlighted on Fig. 6. However, a model with\na higher angle fault such as model 5 cannot be completely ruled\nout.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nWe now compare our results with observed focal mechanisms and\nwith other regions of oceanic intraplate compression, and also\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nCompressional deformation north of Easter microplate 367\nTable 2.

This was obtained\nby careful modelling of broad-band data. In contrast, Delouis et al.\n(1998) report that the routine Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor\nsolution gives a NNE dip of 60\u25e6, but point out that parameters de-\ntermined by this method are less well constrained for shallow earth-\nquakes such as this. Although we did not attempt to model Delouis\net al.\u2019s result explicitly, our preferred model, with a 20\u25e6 N-dipping\nthrust, is in reasonable agreement with their mechanism.\nOther areas of oceanic intraplate compression\nWe consider three areas of significant intraplate deformation that\nmay be relevant to our study area: the Central Indian Ocean, the\nGulf of Cadiz area of the eastern Atlantic, and the southern end of\nthe Juan de Fuca plate. All three display rather greater deformation\nthan exhibited north of Easter Microplate, but similar mechanisms\nmay occur at Easter, albeit at a smaller scale.\nThe Central Indian Ocean is a region of broad lithospheric buck-\nling at wavelengths \u223c200 km with topographic amplitudes \u223c3 km\nand gravity anomalies 30\u201380 mGal (Weissel et al. 1980). There\nis superimposed a smaller-scale deformation (wavelength \u223c7 km)\ncomprising reverse faulting in the igneous crust and sediments and\nassociated folding in the sediment section (Bull et al. 1992; Bull\n& Scrutton 1992; van Orman et al. 1995). The affected plate has a\nrange of ages up to many tens of Ma. The reverse faults dip 30\u201340\u25e6 in\nthe igneous crust and steepen upwards in the sediments to near ver-\ntical (Bull & Scrutton 1992), but many of these may be reactivated\nnormal faults formed near the ridge axis (Bull & Scrutton 1992;\nvan Orman et al. 1995). Lithospheric shortening of between 11 and\n37 km has been estimated at rates of 1\u20137 mm a\u22121 over \u223c1000 km to\ngive total strains of 1\u20134 per cent since the Late Miocene or a strain\nrate of about 10\u221216 s\u22121 (Bull & Scrutton 1992; Chamot-Rooke et al.\n1993; van Orman et al. 1995). Earthquake focal mechanisms are\nmostly strike-slip with a few thrust solutions. The region is gener-\nally considered to be a broad, diffuse plate boundary (Gordon et al.\n1990).\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is a region of Mesozoic lithosphere and has\nalso suffered relatively recent compressional deformation (Purdy\n1975; Hayward et al. 1999). Here too deformation is distributed\nover a wide region (about 300 km), and consists of broad-scale\nlithospheric warping with a wavelength up to 60 km, and superim-\nposed sediment folding and reverse faulting, some of which is rela-\ntively high angle, very similar to the Central Indian Ocean (Tortella\net al. 1997; Hayward et al. 1999). A number of compressional\nridges, of which the largest is Gorringe Bank, occur here. The re-\ngion has been interpreted in terms of faulting (Morel & Meghraoui\n1996; Tortella et al. 1997), folding (Sartori et al. 1994; Girardeau\net al. 1998) or both (Bergeron & Bonnin 1991; Hayward et al.\n1999). Gorringe Bank itself is a linear ridge, some 200 km long by\n80 km wide and 5 km high, and exposes gabbros and peridotites\n(Girardeau et al. 1998). It is associated with a free-air anomaly of\nsome 350 mGal and has an unsupported mass anomaly of some 107\nkg m\u22122 (Sartori et al. 1994; Hayward et al. 1999; Galindo-Zald\u0131\u00b4var\net al. 2003). These authors interpreted the Bank as a large litho-\nspheric block thrust northwestwards over a down-warped plate, with\ntotal convergence\u223c20 km developed over 5 Ma: a strain rate of about\n4 \u00d7 10\u221216 s\u22121. It may be an incipient subduction zone.\nThe southern end of the Juan de Fuca plate (sometimes referred\nto as the Gorda plate), is under shear and compression following\na recent clockwise change to the Juan de Fuca\u2014Pacific relative\nmotion (Silver 1971; Wilson 1989). The age of the deformed plate\nranges from near zero up to about 6 Ma. However, rather than the\nplate deforming by buckling or thrusting, the shortening appears to\nbe taken up by rotation and strike-slip motion along pre-existing\nridge-parallel normal faults (Masson et al. 1989; Wilson 1989) and\npossibly also an antithetic strike-slip fault set (Wilson 1989). The\nstrain rate has been estimated at about 10\u221214 s\u22121 (Wilson 1989).\nThese studies indicate that in some respects the deforming region\nnorth of the Easter microplate has similarities with both the Central\nIndian Ocean and the Gulf of Cadiz. The scale at Easter is consid-\nerably smaller, since the deforming zone there is only about 100 km\nacross and the individual compressional ridges are three to ten times\nsmaller in all dimensions than Gorringe Bank. The lithosphere at\nEaster, with a maximum age of about 5 Ma in the east, is much\nyounger and presumably weaker, and the sediment cover is negli-\ngible. Moreover, the ridge and escarpment that we studied exposes\nonly upper crustal lithologies (basalts), not gabbro or serpentinite.\nNevertheless, as we shall argue below, this area also seems to be de-\nforming under compression by a combination of lithospheric flexure\nand thrust faulting. However, the southern end of the Juan de Fuca\nplate is deforming by a very different mechanism, even though its\nsetting, as young lithosphere near an actively spreading ridge, is su-\nperficially similar to that north of Easter microplate. The difference\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 164, 359\u2013369\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n368 R. C. Searle, J. Francheteau and R. Armijo\nmay be that, unlike Juan de Fuca, there is no strong shear couple\nnorth of Easter, and the required shortening cannot be taken up by\nshear along the existing NNE\u2013SSW tectonic fabric.\nBuckling or thrusting?\nOur gravity results are most consistent with a model in which no\nvariation in crustal thickness occurs, implying pure folding or buck-\nling. If we assume that the whole of the deformation in our studied\nridge results from simple lithospheric buckling, then the amount\nof shortening involved is only about 200 m (i.e. the distance along\nthe seafloor over the ridge compared with the horizontal distance\nacross it), though this occurs over a horizontal distance of about\n12 km giving a strain of 1.7 per cent and a strain rate of about 6\n\u00d7 10\u221216 s\u22121. This strain rate is comparable to estimates from the\nCentral Indian Ocean and Gulf of Cadiz, though all are about two\norders of magnitude slower than the 10\u221214 s\u22121 that Wilson (1989)\nconsidered appropriate for the southern Juan de Fuca plate.\nSeveral authors have modelled the deformation in the Central\nIndian Ocean. A purely elastic plate would reach its fracture strength\nbefore buckling occurred (Weissel et al. 1980), but a faulted elastic\nplate (Wallace & Melosh 1994) or a plastic plate with overlying\nbrittle layer (McAdoo & Sandwell 1985; Bull et al. 1992; Martinod\n& Davy 1992) would buckle first. Numerical modelling suggests\nthat the buckling wavelength is about four times the thickness of the\nbrittle layer (Martinod & Davy 1992), though analogue modelling\ngives a wavelength that is seven times the brittle thickness (Bull\net al. 1992).\nThe wavelength of deformation at Easter is approximately 25 km,\nso using the relationships of Martinod & Davy (1992) or Bull et al.\n(1992) gives a brittle layer thickness of 3.6\u20136.2 km. This would im-\nply that about half to all of the crust has a plastic rheology. This\nmight be true for crust near the spreading centre and actively de-\nforming there, or for the crust south of the ridge where we have\nobserved active deformation. However, the crust north of the ridge,\nwhich nevertheless is flexed up toward it, shows little sign of recent\nfaulting. Alternatively, flexure in this very young (<1 Ma) litho-\nsphere may be at least partly elastic. Neves et al. (2003) used the\nlithospheric age\u2013thickness relationship of Wang & Cochran (1993)\nto show that the elastic thickness in the deforming region north of\nEaster microplate should be about 1\u20132 km; such lithosphere would\nhave a buckling wavelength of 25\u201334 km (McAdoo & Sandwell\n1985 eq. 5), in accordance with our observations.\nDespite these considerations, not all of the deformation in our\nstudy area can be due to buckling alone, for two reasons. First, the\nstructural observations, particularly the existence of pressure ridges\nand sag ponds at the base of the escarpment, directly suggest thrust-\ning. Secondly, in the absence of strong lithospheric heterogeneities,\nbuckling should be roughly symmetric (as it is in the Central Indian\nOcean). It is difficult to see how simple folding could give rise to\na strongly asymmetric structure with a 31\u25e6 slope on one side and\ngentle gradients (\u223c3\u25e6) on the other, without invoking recumbent\n(overturned) folding, which itself would produce significant crustal\nthickening.\nInterestingly, a similar zone of apparent deformation north of the\nJuan Fernandez microplate shows ridges that appear to be more sym-\nmetric (Larson et al. 1992; Bird et al. 1998). It is possible that there\nhas been relatively less thrusting and more buckling there, but we\nnote that, unlike the continuous compression at Easter microplate\n(Rusby & Searle 1995), the northern boundary region of Juan Fer-\nnandez Microplate has suffered episodes of transtension as well as\ntranspression (Bird et al. 1998).\nOne might speculate that deformation in younger lithosphere with\na thinner brittle layer would be by buckling, with more thrusting oc-\ncurring in older, thicker lithosphere. This would suggest that those\nridges nearest the EPR would be predominantly flexural and, there-\nfore, symmetric, but this is not born out by the sidescan data and\nthe fact that the very asymmetric ridge in our study area is the one\nclosest to the EPR.\nIt appears then that the ridges north of Easter microplate have\nformed by a combination of buckling (yielding just a few hun-\ndred metres of crustal shortening) and thrusting, possibly on rel-\natively high-angle faults, accommodating up to a few kilometres of\nshortening.\nFinally, we note that the ridge that we studied is not in isostatic\nequilibrium. A model with local Airy isostasy is a very poor fit to\nthe data. The best-fitting models have unsupported mass loads of\naround 1.6 \u00d7 106 to 2.3 \u00d7 106 kg m\u22122 (equivalent to vertical differ-\nential stresses of 16\u201323 MPa), yielding vertical differential stresses\n\u223c20 MPa, which are readily supportable by the lithosphere. By con-\ntrast, major features such as Gorringe Bank have mass anomalies\nalmost an order of magnitude greater (Hayward et al. 1999).\nC O N C L U S I O N S\n(i) Visual observations confirm that active faulting is associated\nwith the E\u2013W ridge, and that pervasive tectonism characterizes the\nseafloor to its south, but not to the north.\n(ii) Seafloor gravity observations indicate that the ridge is dy-\nnamically supported, but are not consistent with significant crustal\nshortening or thickening unless it is assumed that the tectonized\ncrust to the south is of lower density than the unaffected crust to the\nnorth.\n(iii) We think it most likely that both buckling of the lithosphere\nand faulting contribute to the deformation north of the Easter mi-\ncroplate.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThis work was partly supported by Natural Environment Research\nCouncil grant GR9\/840 to RCS.
