The Heusler alloys Co2MnSi and NiMnSb are predicted to be 100%\nspin-polarized and are leading candidate materials for spin-injection and detection\nin hybrid spintronic devices. Co2MnSi is lattice matched with GaAs, whereas\nNiMnSb is strongly mismatched to GaAs. Here, we study the temperature and\nthickness dependence of the anomalous Hall (AH) effect in a series of textured,\npredominantly (001) oriented, sputter deposited Co2MnSi thin films on GaAs, and\ncompare the behaviour to that of a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown NiMnSb\nfilm on GaAs (001) with low antisite disorder. We show that the Co2MnSi films\nhave temperature independent AH conductivity, even for the thinnest films with\nstrongly temperature dependent saturation magnetization. We discuss whether\na temperature insensitive AH conductivity necessarily indicates that the spin-\npolarization of charge carriers is also temperature independent.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 PII: S1367-2630(07)34448-0\n1367-2630\/07\/010042+10$30.00 \u00a9 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft\n2 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nCo2MnSi and NiMnSb are two of the most promising spintronic injector\/detector materials.\nCo2MnSi is a full Heusler alloy, and NiMnSb is a half-Heusler alloy. Both crystallize in the L21\nstructure (space group Fm3m), and have been predicted to be half metallic ferromagnets [1] with\na large energy gap in the minority band (\u223c0.4 eV for Co2MnSi, \u223c0.5 eV for NiMnSb [2]). Their\nrespective Curie temperatures are 985 K [3, 4] and 730 K [5].\nHeuslers can suffer from antisite disorder [6] because of similar atomic radii of the metal\nions. However, calculations have indicated that in Co2MnSi the bare band structure spin-\npolarization, P0 (the difference of the density of states at the Fermi energy for spin-up and\nspin-down carriers) is robust to the presence of antisite defects. This is in marked contrast to\nmany other Heusler alloys, including NiMnSb [7]\u2013[9].\nThe anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity is well studied, particularly for ferromagnetic metals\n[10]. Empirically, it can be described as being proportional to the magnetization of a sample,\ngiving a total Hall resistivity of \u03c1xy = ROB + RS\u00b50M, where RO and RS are known respectively\nas the ordinary and AH coefficients and \u00b50M is the magnetization. Theory suggests that there\nis a much more general phenomenon, known as the spin Hall effect [11]\u2013[14]. The spin Hall\neffect describes a transverse deflection of current carriers, which can arise from either intrinsic or\nextrinsic processes in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, and results in an off-diagonal carrier\nvelocity which is proportional to (\u03bb \u00b7 E \u00d7 s)where s is the carrier spin-vector, E is the electric field\nvector and \u03bb is the spin-orbit coupling constant. The cross product results in equal and opposite\nterms for spin-up and spin-down carriers and produces a spatial separation of spin-currents\n[13, 15]. This results in an AH charge-current, JAH, proportional to (\u03bb \u00b7 E \u00d7 S) where S is the\ntotal spin-vector of the charge carriers, which is related to Pt. In unpolarized systems JAH = 0\nand there is pure spin-separation, whereas in naturally polarized systems there is concomitant\ncharge separation which results in the readily observable AH voltage. The intrinsic AH current\ndensity has been defined [16, 17] as JAH = 2ne2\u03bbE \u00d7 S where n and e are the density and\ncharge of the carriers, respectively. In the mixed or extrinsic regime, the degree of asymmetric\n(or spin-orbit) and symmetry preserving (or symmetric) scattering within a sample also plays a\nrole in the magnitude of the total AH resistivity measured [18]. Historically, the purely quantum-\nmechanical intrinsic effect has been described as side-jump scattering [16, 19] and this has added\nto the confusion about the mechanism of the AH effect. In this description the AH resistivity was\ndescribed as two components, skew and side-jump terms which are linearly and quadratically\ndependent on the resistivity, respectively [20]. However, recently it was shown [18] that the skew\nscattering (extrinsic) mechanism alone could result in a mixed linear and quadratic dependence,\ndepending on the relative contributions of symmetric and asymmetric scattering in the material.\nHence, we can conclude that it is rather difficult in practice to differentiate between intrinsic and\nextrinsic mechanisms purely from the dependence of the anomalous Hall term (AHT) on the\nresistivity.\nWhen evaluating ferromagnetic materials for ferromagnet\u2013semiconductor hybrid devices,\nthe transport spin-polarization, Pt, which can be dramatically different to P0 [21], is one of\nthe critical parameters that needs to be established. Point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR)\nspectroscopy can be used, but characterizes the near surface properties only and the information\nis restricted to low temperatures. Previously, we demonstrated that Co2MnSi films on sapphire\n[22, 23] and GaAs [24] have a spin-polarization of 55%, significantly higher than other elemental\nand alloy-metal ferromagnets, and aPt of 89% has recently been claimed after annealing at 450 \u25e6C\n[25]. However, recent measurements on Co2MnSi magnetic tunnel junctions [24] and Co2MnGe\nspin-polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs) [26] have shown a significant deterioration of\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nthe tunnel current spin-polarization with increasing temperature. In the light of these results, it is\nimportant to search for other complementary techniques that will measure bulk properties. The\nAH resistivity is attractive because of its simplicity as a method and it is relatively straightforward\nto study film properties as a function of thickness and temperature. For example, the study\ncomparing dilute magnetic semiconductors, itinerant ferromagnets and doped Kondo insulators\nhas shown that plotting the AH conductivity is a useful way to classify magnetic systems [27].\nThe AHT can be used as a gauge of variation of film properties with thickness and\ntemperature but not as an absolute determinant of transport spin-polarization. The combination of\nAHT from base temperature to room temperature with base temperature PCAR measurement of\nthe polarization [21] appears the best available indication of the room temperature spin transport\nin ferromagnetic metals.\nPreviously [28], we demonstrated that in thin films of off-stoichiometric NiMnSb on Si\n(001) the Hall transport properties varied dramatically as a function of temperature and thickness,\nindicating very poor performance as a spintronic injector material. Thickness, orientation and\nsurface termination have been predicted [29] to play an important role in the transport spin-\npolarization of Heusler alloys. Here, we investigate the thickness and temperature dependence\nof the longitudinal (\u03c1xx) and Hall (\u03c1xy) electrical resistivities in highly (001) aligned Co2MnSi\nfilms on lattice-matched GaAs (001). We compare the AHT in Co2MnSi:GaAs (001) to epitaxial\nNiMnSb:GaAs (001) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).\nThe MBE growth of the 330 nm NiMnSb:GaAs (001) film is described elsewhere [30], the\nsubstrate temperature was 300 \u25e6C and the Sb\/Ni flux ratio was ten. There is no reaction zone in\nthis film [30]. With reference to the sputtered Co2MnSi films, we note that a Mn2As interface\nlayer was observed in MBE NiMnSb films grown with a lower antimony flux [30]. The film was\nshown to have a low level of antisite defects (\u00014%) by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques\n[31]. The lattice mismatch is 4.4%.\nThin films of Co2MnSi, with thicknesses of 14, 37, 130 and 260 nm, were grown from three\nelemental dc magnetron sputtering targets onto GaAs (001) substrates at 374 \u25e6C, positioned\ndirectly below the targets on a Ta strip heater. The geometry of the set-up is described elsewhere\n[22]. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Co2MnSi films are consistent with single-phase\nhighly textured Co2MnSi, following the orientation of the lattice matched GaAs (001), with\na lattice parameter of 5.63 \u00b1 0.01 \u00c5, compared to 5.6521 \u00b1 0.0001 \u00c5 for the bulk [32]. No\nimpurity phases were detected in the XRD.\nThe composition, morphology and thickness of the films was studied with a transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM) [24, 23]. Figure 1 shows TEM bright field images of cross-section of\nthe 14 nm (a) and 260 nm (b) thick Co2MnSi films, the zone axis is (110). Reaction zones are vis-\nible at the Co2MnSi:GaAs interface in all films, in the thinner layers (up to \u223c130 nm) the reaction\nzones show faceting down into the substrate, approximately along the (111) direction, while in the\nthicker films the reaction zone appears more continuous. Energy-filtered TEM composition map-\nping using the L3 edges [33] shows that the reaction zone is indistinguishable from the rest of the\nGaAs substrate when mapping arsenic concentration, but gallium is deficient, compared to GaAs.\nManganese mapping shows that it is present, and cobalt could not be detected in the reaction\nzone. However, specific crystalline impurity phases, e.g., MnAs, Mn2As were not observed in the\nTEM or the XRD. We note that the volume of the reaction zone approaches that of the 14 nm film\nHeusler layer, and is well within the resolution of our structural characterization to a crystalline\nsingle phase. Thus, we conclude that the reaction zone is either Mn-doped GaAs or a nanocrys-\ntalline or amorphous mixture of GaAs and a Mn\u2013As compound, such as MnAs or Mn2As.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n4 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nI\nII\nIII\n(a)\n(b)\n\u2191 (001)\u2297(110) \u2191 (111)\nFigure 1.

Regions labelled as follows: I: Co2MnSi\nfilm, II: reaction zone III: GaAs substrate.\nMagnetotransport data were collected in a square geometry by the van der Pauw method.\nThe pure Hall signal was separated from the magnetoresistive contribution by virtue of their\ndifferent symmetries with respect to the inversion of the magnetic field. The field dependence\nof the magnetization of the films was measured at the same temperatures and in the same\ngeometry (field perpendicular to the film surface) as the Hall measurements, in an Oxford\nInstruments vibrating sample magnetometer. In this geometry, the magnetic anisotropy of the\nfilms is dominated by the shape anisotropy.\nThe Hall resistivity was measured for all the films at selected temperatures between 10 K\nand 290 K, the data for the 260 nm Co2MnSi film, which is typical of all the Co2MnSi films,\nare shown in figure 2 together with the 330 nm NiMnSb film. An iterative procedure was used\nto fit the measured Hall resistivity to the expression \u03c1xy = ROB + RS\u00b50M, using independently\nmeasured magnetization, which was measured at the same temperature and in the same geometry\n(with field perpendicular to film surface). With this field orientation, the demagnetization factor\n(N) is unity, hence the flux density, B = \u00b50[H + (1 \u2212 N)M] = \u00b50H , where H is the applied\nmagnetic field in A m\u22121.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n5 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n0 1 2 3 40\n10\n20\n30\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n(b)\n\u00b50H (T)\n\u03c1 x\ny\n(n\u2126\nm\n)\n(a)\n10 K\n290 K\n10 K\n290 K\n \u03c1\nxy\n(n\u2126\nm\n)\n0 1002003000.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nT (K)R O\n(n \u2126\nm\n\/T\n)\nFigure 2.

Inset: ordinary\nHall constant versus temperature for NiMnSb film (solid line) and bulk data taken\nfrom Otto et al [20].\nOne can immediately see from the raw data shown in figure 2 that there are differences\nbetween the Co2MnSi and the NiMnSb films. Both the magnitude of the Hall signal and the\ntemperature dependence are very different between the films. In particular, it is clear from\nthe raw data that RS is approximately an order of magnitude larger in Co2MnSi than NiMnSb,\nwhereas \u03c1xx is only a factor of between two and four larger, depending on temperature and RO,\nthe ordinary Hall component, is immeasurably small in Co2MnSi (the high field part of the\ncurve is effectively completely flat), whereas the high field slope of NiMnSb clearly changes\nwith temperature. In the inset to figure 2(a) we compare the temperature dependence of RO\nof the MBE grown film to previous bulk measurements by Otto et al [34]. We do not observe\nthe sharp increase below 100 K observed in the bulk, but above 100 K the data are in good\nagreement with RO \u223c 0.1 n\u0003 m T\u22121, indicating that there is no significant change in the quantity\nor sign of the dominant carriers. In contrast, we previously used this method to show [35] that in\npolycrystalline NiMnSb films grown on Si, both the quantity and charge of the dominant carriers\nvaried dramatically with temperature and thickness. Using a single carrier model, one could\nobtain carrier concentration and mobility from the Hall coefficient for NiMnSb, and a lower\nbound to the concentration for Co2MnSi, however, it is known that the Heuslers have complex\nFermi surfaces, with both hole-like and electron-like regions, and so this is not appropriate here.\nFor the Co2MnSi films RO \u0003 RS and the high-field magnetic susceptibility of the films could not\nbe accurately determined, so RO could not be precisely determined from the fitting procedure.\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetotransport parameters of all the Co2MnSi\nand NiMnSb films up to room temperature is shown in figure 3, and absolute values of the\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n6 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0 (c)\nT (K)\n\u03c1 x\ny,\nsa\nt\/ \u03c1\nxy\n,\nsa\nt(2\n90\n K\n) 0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0 (b)\n\u03c1 x\nx\/ \u03c1\nxx\n(29\n0 \nK)\n(a)\n260 nm\n130 nm\n37 nm\n14 nm\n330 nm NiMnSbM\nS\/M\nS(1\n0 K\n)\nFigure 3.

(c) Normalized saturation Hall\nresistivity. Symbol shapes are as in figure 3(a).\nrelevant parameters are given in table 1. Figure 3(a) shows the saturation magnetization,\nthe 260 nm film has magnetic properties similar to that of the stoichiometric bulk material\n(TC = 985 K)3 with MS(300 K)\/MS(5 K) = 0.97, whereas it is clear that TC is reduced for\nthe 14, 37 and 130 nm films. This is consistent with increasingly significant loss of Mn from\nthe Heusler phase to the reaction layer as the films become thinner. The observed behaviour\ncould also be explained by a low Curie temperature ferromagnetic impurity phase forming in\nthe reaction zone. The most likely candidate impurity, Mn2As [30], is antiferromagnetic, but\nmetallic ferromagnetic MnAs (TC = 313 K) and dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor Mn-doped\nGaAs (TC = up to 140 K) are plausible phases. However, MS(300 K)\/MS(5 K) = 0.55 for the\n14 nm film, and for this to be caused by impurity phases would require a volume of MnAs\napproximately equal to the volume of the film, or a volume of Mn-doped GaAs more than an\norder of magnitude greater than that of the film. Sufficient quantities of MnAs to cause the\ndifferent temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization cannot be ruled out.\nThe resistivity (\u03c1xx) and saturation AH resistivity (\u03c1xy,sat) are compared in figures 3(b)\nand (c) respectively. The residual resistivity (table 1) of the NiMnSb film is small and the\ntemperature dependence of (\u03c1xx) is significant, the resistivity ratio (300 K\/10 K) is 2.5, so by\nroom temperature thermally activated processes are contributing the majority of the scattering.\nIn contrast, in the thick Co2MnSi films, the residual resistivity much larger and the resistivity\nratio is only 1.3, so temperature independent (defect) scattering dominates all the way up to\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n7 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nTable 1.

The magnitude of the AH conductivity de-\ncreases with decreasing thickness, but it remains relatively temperature independent in the\nthinner Co2MnSi films with strongly temperature dependent saturation magnetization. In the\nthinner films, the reaction zone is largely comprised of island facets, rather than being a\ncontinuous layer, so whilst the volume of the reaction zone is similar to that of the Heusler layer,\nit may not provide a significant conduction path in transport measurements. The difference with\nthe strongly temperature dependent AH conductivity of the NiMnSb film is striking.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n0 20 40 60 80\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nCo2MnSi\nRS\/\u03c1=0.011+0.000481\u03c1\nNiMnSb\nRS\/\u03c1=0.006+0.000015\u03c1\n\u03c1\nxx\n(\u00b5\u2126 cm)\nR S\n\/\u03c1 x\nx\n(T\n\u2212\n1 )\nFigure 5. AH constant divided by resistivity versus resistivity, for the 260 nm\nCo2MnSi:GaAs and 330 nm NiMnSb:GaAs films. Symbols represent data and\ndashed lines linear fit with the fit parameters shown in the figure caption.\nAs previously discussed, \u03c1xy can vary in a complex manner with \u03c1xx when the same physical\nprocesses are contributing to both terms. To determine the precise relationship between the\nresistivity and the Hall term it is customary to plot RS\/\u03c1xx against \u03c1xx where (RS = \u03c1xy,sat\/Msat).\nThis is shown for the thick Co2MnSi and NiMnSb films in figure 5, and an iterative linear fit is\nalso shown for each sample. From this fitting it is clear that both samples can be described by\nthe relationship \u03c1xy = \u03b1\u03c1xx + \u03b2\u03c12xx. The intercept, \u03b1, is positive, and of similar magnitude for\nthe Co2MnSi (0.011 T\u22121) and NiMnSb films (0.006 T\u22121). For NiMnSb the intercept dominates,\nbecause the slope, \u03b2, is negligible (1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125(T \u00b5\u0003 cm)\u22121), in contrast, for Co2MnSi it is the\nslope (4.81 \u00d7 10\u22124(T \u00b5\u0003 cm)\u22121) that dominates RS\/\u03c1xx in the accessible range of resistivities.\nRecently, it was shown that mixed linear and quadratic dependence of \u03c1xy on \u03c1xx can\narise in a purely extrinsic model when symmetric and asymmetric (spin-orbit) scattering occur\n[18]. By Matthiessen\u2019s rule one can describe the resistivity as arising from two components,\n\u03c1xx = \u03c10 + \u03c1S, where \u03c10 and \u03c1S arise from symmetric and asymmetric skew scattering respec-\ntively. This model suggests that the observed behaviour for NiMnSb requires that both \u03c1S and\n\u03c10 are variable functions of temperature and that both asymmetric and symmetric scatterers\ncontribute significantly to the in-plane resistivity. A strong temperature dependence of the\nscattering terms is consistent with the claims of a crossover from half-metallic to ordinary\nferromagnetic behaviour [36], with the onset of spin-flip scattering above 80 K in NiMnSb.\nFor the Co2MnSi film, the predominantly quadratic relationship \u03c1xy\u223c\u03b2\u03c12xx shown in\nfigure 5 can be interpreted as resulting from the same scattering mechanism dominating at\nall temperatures. We note that the results could also be accounted for in a purely intrinsic\nmodel, with robust Pt in Co2MnSi, and a temperature dependent Pt in NiMnSb, but we rule out\nthis scenario on physical grounds, as the resistivity ratio of the Co2MnSi film (see table 1) is\ncharacteristic of \u2018dirty metal\u2019 with strong impurity scattering.\nThus as a result of this analysis, it is now clear that the temperature dependence of the AH\nconductivity when the extrinsic mechanism dominates (as is the case for all the films studied here)\ncan only be used to measure the variation of the underlying polarization of the transport carriers\nin films when the scattering contributions to the resistivity are fully evaluated. A full analysis of\nthe transport parameters, in particular, scattering processes and spin-orbit coupling parameters\nis required to employ AH conductivity as a measure of transport spin-polarization, but trends\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 42 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n9 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nobserved in a systematically varied series can provide valuable information. As we have shown\nhere for the NiMnSb film, a decreasing AH conductivity can result from competing scattering\nmechanisms and the behaviour might be rather subtle and may very well not reflect a declining Pt.\nFor the Co2MnSi it is difficult to imagine how a temperature independent \u03c1xy could be observed in\nthe presence of a declining Pt, although \u03c1xy will also be sensitive to a temperature dependence of\nthe spin-orbit coupling parameter, and it is possible although highly unlikely that these two terms\ncounter-balance each other. The trend of decreasing AH conductivity with decreasing thickness\nin sputtered Co2MnSi films is consistent with increasing spin-polarization as the distance from\nthe interface increases and the manganese deficiency cause by the interface reaction decreases.\nIn summary, the sputtered Co2MnSi films on GaAs (001) have large residual resistivities as a\nresult of temperature independent defect scattering, which is the dominant scattering mechanism\nup to room temperature. This temperature independent extrinsic regime allows much more\ninformation about the spin-polarization to be extracted from the AH conductivity, which is\nsensitive to both spin-polarization and scattering mechanism, than is usually the case. We observe\nthat the AH conductivity, and hence the spin-polarization, is robust up to room temperature\nin all the Co2MnSi films, and its absolute value decreases as the thickness decreases and the\nloss of manganese into the interface reaction layer becomes more significant. This temperature\nindependence in the Hall conductivity of the thinner films is surprising given the decreasing\nsaturation magnetization. This may arise because the magnetization measurement is sensitive to\nthe whole volume, whereas the transport only samples the conducting region, and the faceted\nmorphology of the reaction zone in these films does not provide a good conduction path. The\nimportance of the temperature independent extrinsic regime for the AH analysis is illustrated by\ncomparison with an MBE grown NiMnSb film on GaAs (001) with low antisite disorder. The\nresidual resistivity is far smaller in the NiMnSb film, there is less defect scattering, and there\nis a change in the dominant scattering mechanism between 10 K and room temperature. This\nparticular difference is a result of the different growth methods, not of a difference between the\nmaterials. At all temperatures the ordinary Hall constant is far greater, and the AH constant far\nsmaller than in the Co2MnSi films, and it is quite strongly temperature dependent. Furthermore,\nthe AH constant varies with the square of the resistivity in Co2MnSi, whereas it is nearly linear\nin resistivity in the NiMnSb film. These observations indicate that the higher structural quality\nof the NiMnSb film results in a lower carrier density, higher mobility and reduced impurity\nscattering than in the \u2018dirty metal\u2019 Co2MnSi films. The temperature dependent AH conductivity\nof the MBE grown NiMnSb could be attributed to either the changing scattering mechanism, or\ndecreasing spin-polarization with increasing temperature.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded by the UK EPSRC; WRB is supported by the Ramsay Memorial\nFellowships Trust.\nReferences\n[1] Ishida S, Fujii S, Kashiwagi S and Asano S 1995 J.
