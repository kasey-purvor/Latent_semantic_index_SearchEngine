Introduction\n[2] Based on detailed ray trace modeling in the noon-\nmidnight meridian plane, Bortnik et al. [2008] proposed that\nplasmaspheric hiss originates from lower-band chorus gen-\nerated outside the plasmasphere. The day-night asymmetry of\nhiss was explained as a consequence of weaker Landau\ndamping on the dayside, which allows chorus emissions to\npropagate to high latitude, where they subsequently migrate\nonto lower L-shells and enter the plasmasphere. Observations\non two separate THEMIS spacecraft later confirmed a strong\ncorrelation between amplitude modulation of these two\ndistinct waves [Bortnik et al., 2009]. However, these corre-\nlated observations of hiss emission and chorus emission were\nabout 3 hours apart in magnetic local time (MLT). Further-\nmore, earlier statistical analysis of wave data from the\nCombined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRESS)\nshowed that high latitude lower-band chorus emissions (4 <\nL < 7) are predominately seen on the dayside, over the MLT\nrange between 0600 and 1400 MLT [Meredith et al., 2003].\nIn contrast, whistler-mode hiss inside the plasmasphere\n(2 < L < 4) is generally found between 0600 and 2100 MLT\nduring active periods, with peak emission in the late after-\nnoon or duskside [Meredith et al., 2004]. More recently,\nLi et al. [2009] analyzed wave magnetic fields on THEMIS\nand reported that the global distribution of chorus emissions\ntends to peak in the pre-noon sector at low latitudes.\n[3] To validate the idea that plasmaspheric hiss is a result\nof the evolution of chorus waves that propagate into the\nplasmasphere, one must account for the distinct difference\nin the MLT distribution of hiss and chorus. To examine the\nimportance of off-meridian propagation, a three-dimensional\nray tracing study is performed. As in previous studies [e.g.,\nBortnik et al., 2007], we ignore all the aspects of the wave\nexcitation process, and consider only the Landau damping of\nVLF waves as they propagate away from the their source\nregion near the equator outside the plasmasphere.\n2. Asymmetrical Density Model\n[4] The HOTRAY code [Horne, 1989] is used to perform\nray tracing in three dimensional space. For this study, an\naxisymmetric dipole magnetic field is used and a smooth\nthree dimensional density distribution of the storm time\nmagnetosphere is constructed as follows.\n[5] 1. The equatorial density distribution is simulated\nusing the plasmaspheric density model of Rasmussen et al.\n[1993] which was developed further to use an arbitrary\nelectric field by Jordanova et al. [2006]. In this study the\nplasmasphere model is driven by the electric field output\nfrom Rice Convection model (RCM) for the 2001 April 21st\nstorm. The equatorial density at a specific time during the\nstormmain phase is generated on an L-shell grid from 2 to 6.5\nevery 0.25 and an MLT grid with a grid spacing of 1\/2 hour.\n[6] 2. The discrete equatorial density is interpolated to\ngenerate a smooth equatorial density distribution from L =\n1.2\u201310 by using 2-D Hermite interpolation [Fritsch and\nCarlson, 1980; Phillips, 1973], which maintains monotonic-\nity inMLTand L in almost every spatial bin. Figure 1b shows\nin gray scale the typical stormmain phase density distribution\non the equatorial plane used in our study, which includes a\nhigh-density plume in the post-noon sector.\n[7] 3. The three dimensional density model is completed,\nusing the latitudinal dependence along the magnetic field\nlines, given by Denton et al. [2002].\n3. Three-Dimensional Ray Tracing\n[8] For the purpose of three dimensional ray tracing, we\ndefine the direction of the wave vector k in the local Cartesian\nsystem as shown in Figure 1a. In this system, the z axis is\nalong the direction of the ambient magnetic field, the x axis is\northogonal to the z axis and lies in themeridian plane pointing\naway from the Earth at the equator, and the y axis completes\nthe right-handed set. The wave vector k makes an angle y\nwith the z axis and the projection of k onto the xy plane makes\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L22101, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040451, 2009\n1Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, California, USA.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\n3ISR-1, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040451\nL22101 1 of 5\nan angle h with the x axis. h = 0\u0002, 90\u0002, 180\u0002 and 270\u0002\ncorrespond to k whose component perpendicular to the\nambient magnetic field k? is directed away from the Earth,\ntoward later MLT (eastward), toward the Earth, and toward\nearlier MLT (westward), respectively.\n[9] Since oblique whistler-mode VLF waves are subjected\nto Landau damping by electrons of a few keV, a global\nstatistical model of the suprathermal electron population is\nalso constructed using electron fluxes measured by the Low\nEnergy Plasma Analyzer (LEPA) of CRRES over 939 orbits\nunder geomagnetically active conditions (AE > 300 nT).\nAnalytical power law distribution functions are fit to the\nstatistical suprathermal flux observations outside the plasma-\nsphere [e.g., Bortnik et al., 2007], and the model of Bell et al.\n[2002] is used to model suprathermal electron flux inside the\nplasmapause. The plasmapause location is set to the equato-\nrial density contour of value 50 cm\u00023 in our study. The fitted\ndistribution functions are used to calculate the local Landau\ndamping rate (using Equation (3.9) of Kennel [1966]. It\nshould be noted that there is a typo in that equation, i.e., R\nand L in the fifth line of this equation should be L and R\nrespectively.) The attenuation experienced by a ray is calcu-\nlated by the local damping rate integrated along the ray path.\nRay lifetime is defined as the time when the ray decays to 1%\nof its initial power.\n[10] Figure 1b shows an example of a three dimensional\nray path of a whistler mode wave (labeled as ray 1) launched\noutside the plasmapause near the edge of the plume at L= 5.0\nandMLT= 14, with frequency f = 0.1 fce (696Hz), initialy0 =\n25\u0002 and h0 = 70\u0002, where fce is the ambient electron gyro-\nfrequency. Propagation characteristics of this ray are also\nshown in Figure 2a. The ray propagates outside the plasma-\nsphere for less than 1 second, where most of the Landau\ndamping occurs, and then enters the plasmasphere, where\nthe ray decays much more slowly due to lower suprathermal\nelectron flux. The ray is trapped inside the plasmasphere,\npropagates across the entire range of MLT, and experiences\nrepeated magnetospheric reflection and plasmapause bounc-\ning until it enters the plume again at t \u0003 50 seconds.\nMagnetospheric reflection is characterized by a passage of\ny through 90\u0002, during which the wave can reverse the\ncomponent of its group velocity along the ambient magnetic\nfield. Plasmapause bouncing occurs, according to Snell\u2019s law,\nat the steep density region near the plasmapause. This fea-\nture is indicated by the spikes along the upper envelope of the\nL-shell evolution profile (Figure 2b), taking place at different\nLs at different MLTs because of the asymmetry of the\nplasmasphere. Eventually the ray becomes trapped within\nthe plume, exhibiting only magnetospheric reflections in the\nmeridian plane near MLT= 15.5 due to lack of a steep density\ngradients, which are required for plasmapause bouncing. The\nattenuation rate is a little slower during the early phase when\nplasmapause bouncing occurs, t < 50 seconds (Figure 2d),\nprimarily because plasmapause bouncing keeps the wave\nnormal angle y more field-aligned.\n[11] Figure 2 also shows the propagation characteristics of\ntwo other rays, labeled ray 2 and 3, launched from the same\nsource location, but with different initial propagation angles.\nRay 2 (with y0 = 31\u0002 and h0 = 180\u0002) experiences strong\nLandau damping to 50% of the initial power at t = 0.2 second\nand then enters the plasmasphere. During the following\n10 seconds, this ray also propagates across 3 hours in MLT\ninto the plume region. Soon after that, the ray eventually\nFigure 1.

Ray 3 (with y0 = 59\u0002 and h0 = 180\u0002) also propagates\ninto the plume and eventually migrates toward smaller L, due\nto multiple magnetosphere reflections inside the plume near\nMLT\u0004 17. This ray survives for over 100 seconds because of\nlower the damping rate in the high-density regions. These\nrays (1, 2, and 3) shows three representative, but different,\ntypes of ray trajectories: global propagation, escaping from\nthe plume or plasmasphere, and plume trapping.\n[12] The single ray trajectories illustrated in Figure 2 have\nbeen repeated multiple times, in each case varying one of\ninitial parameters (e.g., L, MLT, f, y, h). For this initial study,\nwe fix the source region at L = 5, and frequency f = 696 Hz\n(0.1 fce) and perform 3-D ray-tracing for whistler-mode\nwaves with different initial MLT, y0 and h0. Figure 3 shows\nthe equatorial projection of each ray path along L-shells (left\ncolumn) and life time (right column) of each ray as a function\nof initial y0 and h0, parameterized into 4 rows representing\ndifferent initial MLT (6, 10, 12, 14 hours from the top to the\nbottom). The thermal electron density distribution is super-\nimposed on the left column in gray scale with white color\nrepresenting the regionwhere density is greater than 50 cm\u00023,\nused to define entry into the plasmasphere in this study. The\ncolored lines in Figures 3a, 3c, 3e, and 3g are ray paths\nprojected onto the equatorial plane for waves with 33 values\nof y0 from 1\u0002 to 65\u0002 at 2\u0002 spacing and 72 values of h0 equally\nspaced over 360\u0002, consistent with a broad range of wave\nnormals observed in the chorus source region [Breneman\net al., 2009]. The colors of these lines represents different\nvalues of y0; lines with the same y0 but different h0 are\nplotted in the same color. For rays launched at MLT = 6\n(Figures 3a and 3b), all rays remain outside the plasmasphere,\nand damp out in less than 0.4 seconds as they propagate\ntoward high latitude due to strong damping in the dawn\nsector. A similar behavior occurs at this L-shell throughout\nthe entire night sector (not shown here). For rays launched at\nMLT = 10, those rays with high wave normal angle y0 (>60\u0002)\nand k? pointing toward the Earth and slightly eastward\n(135\u0002 < h0 < 180\u0002) can penetrate into the plasmasphere\nand endure for over 100 seconds. All of these rays propa-\ngate eastward, due to steep eastward density gradient at\nMLT \u0004 10, and migrate across about 5 hours in MLT on\naverage inside the plasmasphere. Other rays confined out-\nside the plasmasphere generally also propagate across 1 or\n2 hours in MLT, but survive for less than 2 seconds. For\nrays initiated in the noon sector (Figures 3e and 3f), entry\ninto the plasmasphere is greatly enhanced, due to the\nextended plasmapause location and less suprathermal elec-\ntron flux, and extends to smaller y0 (>35\u0002) and a broader\nrange of h0 centered at h0 = 180\u0002. Those rays that enter the\nplasmasphere are able to propagate in both eastward and\nwestward directions, since the density gradient associated\nwith the plasmapause is almost radial at MLT = 12. Most\nrays launched at MLT = 14 (Figures 3g and 3h) are pulled\ntoward the higher density, even those with initial k point-\ning westward, and subsequently propagate eastward because\nof the steep eastward density gradient associated with the\nearly-MLT edge of the plume. A few rays can bounce back\ntoward the west inside the plasmasphere from eastward\npropagation after several plasmapause bounces, due to the\nasymmetry of plasmapause shape during storm conditions.\n[13] A variety of interesting propagation characteristics\noccur for chorus waves launched at 1400 MLT (Figures 3g\nand 3h) near the edge of the plume, which basically fall into\nfour different categories:\n[14] 1. rays with lifetime less than 1 second launched with\n\u000260\u0002 < h0 < 60\u0002 and y0 > 20\u0002 (k directed away from the\nEarth); Such rays are confined to the region outside the\nplasmasphere and damp out within less than a few seconds.\nThey also tend to propagate eastward, indicated by a much\nhigher density of ray paths to the east of the launch point\n(Figure 3g).\n[15] 2. rays with a lifetime of over one hundred seconds\nwith wave vectors pointing toward the Earth with y0 > 50\u0002 or\nwith wave vectors pointing westward with any y0, even\nas low as y0 = 0 (field aligned); These rays (like ray 3 in\nFigure 2) can enter the plasmasphere and propagate westward\nuntil they reach the plume. Subsequently, the rays become\ntrapped inside the high density plume in the meridian plane at\na certain MLT, exhibit multiple magnetospheric reflections\nand migrate toward smaller L-shells.\n[16] 3. rays with a lifetime of about 100 seconds or more\nwith wave vector directed toward the plume (eastward); This\ntype of ray (like ray 1 in Figure 2) can jump over the plume\nand exhibit large migration in MLT, and even global propa-\ngation over all MLT. This type of ray, from a single location\nwith single frequency but a range of wave vector directions,\ncan eventually fill the whole plasmasphere, including the\nnightside.\n[17] 4. rays with a lifetime of about 10 seconds with y0 <\n20\u0002 pointing westward, or 30 < y0 < 50 toward the Earth;\nSuch rays (like ray 2 in Figure 2) are pulled into the plume\nand then escape toward larger L inside the plume, thus\nbecoming damped more quickly than the rays of the second\ntype.\n4. Principal Findings and Future Study\n[18] This initial three dimensional ray tracing study of\nVLF waves has revealed a variety of new propagation\ncharacteristics, which are important for understanding the\norigin of plasmaspheric hiss:\n[19] 1. VLF chorus excited near the equator on the dayside\ncan propagate to high latitude and enter the plasmasphere\nfrom a broad range of MLT source locations. The ability to\naccess the plasmasphere depends on the distance of the\nplasmapause from the wave source region, and the initial\nwave normal direction of emitted waves.\n[20] 2. VLF waves can propagate azimuthally both inside\nand outside the plasmasphere. However, pronounced off-\nmeridian propagation is most effective in the post-noon\nsector, due to the weaker Landau damping rate and larger\nazimuthal density gradients. Off-meridian propagation also\nbecomes more effective inside the plasmasphere than out-\nside, due to internal ray reflection from the plasmapause.\nPlasmapause reflections enable large MLT transport, even\nglobally across all MLT, and such waves may transit from\neastward propagation to westward propagation or vice verse\nbecause of plasmapause asymmetry.\n[21] 3. VLF waves that propagate into the plasmaspheric\nplume tend to remain confined inside the plume, exhibiting\nmagnetospheric reflections with no plasmapause reflection\ndue to the lack of a steep density gradient. Such confinement\nL22101 CHEN ET AL.: THREE-DIMENSIONAL RAY-TRACING OF VLF WAVES L22101\n3 of 5\nis consistent with intense VLF emission observed on the\nduskside during storm times [Thorne et al., 1974; Summers\net al., 2008].\n[22] The initial investigation of the role of azimuthal\ndensity gradient on the ray path of VLFwaves was performed\nfor a specific density model appropriate during the main\nphase of a storm. Nonetheless, we anticipate that some of the\ngeneral features of wave access into the plasmasphere should\nalso be present for any non-axisymmetric density distribu-\ntion. This can be explored in 3D ray tracing studies with a\nFigure 3.
