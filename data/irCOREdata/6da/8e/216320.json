often spatially depend in their policy choices on other\nunits+ This also holds in dyadic settings where, as in much of international relations\nresearch, analysis focuses on the interaction or relation between a pair or dyad of two\npolitical units+ Yet, with few exceptions, social scientists have analyzed contagion in\nmonadic datasets only, consisting of individual political units+ This article catego-\nrizes all possible forms of spatial effect modeling in both undirected and directed\ndyadic data, where it is possible to distinguish the source and the target of interaction\n~for example, exporter0importer, aggressor0victim, and so on!+ This approach enables\nscholars to formulate and test novel mechanisms of contagion, thus ideally paving the\nway for studies analyzing spatial dependence between dyads of political units+ To illus-\ntrate the modeling flexibility gained from an understanding of the full set of specifi-\ncation options for spatial effects in dyadic data, we examine the diffusion of bilateral\ninvestment treaties between developed and developing countries, building and extend-\ning on Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons\u2019s 2006 study+ However, we come to different\nconclusions about the channels through which bilateral investment treaties diffuse+\nRather than a capital-importing country being influenced by the total number of BITs\nsigned by other capital importers, as modeled in their original article, we find that a\ncapital-importing country is more likely to sign a BIT with a capital exporter only if\nother competing capital importers have signed BITs with this very same capital\nexporter+ Similarly, other capital exporters\u2019 BITs with a specific capital importer influ-\nence an exporter\u2019s incentive to agree on a BIT with the very same capital importer+\nPolicy choices of one political unit are often not independent of policies imple-\nmented in other units, in which case they are said to depend spatially on each\nother+ Recently, social scientists have become very interested in analyzing pro-\ncesses of \u201cpolicy contagion,\u201d \u201cpolicy diffusion,\u201d and \u201cpolicy spillover\u201d\nacross jurisdictions+1 The vast majority of these studies have used a monadic data-\nThis article is based on equal authorship+ We thank Zach Elkins for providing the source data for the\nweighting matrices

with more complex link functions, contact the authors+\n1+ We use the terms contagion, diffusion, and spillover interchangeably even if they often represent\nsomewhat different modes of spatial dependence+\nInternational Organization 64, Winter 2010, pp+ 145\u201366\n\u00a9 2010 by The IO Foundation+ doi:10+10170S0020818309990191\nset+2 In contrast, with few exceptions diffusion analysis remains nonexistent in\nstudies adopting a dyadic framework, that is, a setting where, as in much of inter-\nnational relations research, the unit of analysis is the pair or dyad of two politi-\ncal units representing an interaction or a relation between the two units such as\nthe conclusion of a bilateral treaty or the initiation of violent conflict between\ntwo countries+3 This is surprising because spatial dependence exists whenever the\nmarginal utility of one unit of analysis depends on the choices of other units of\nanalysis+ What one unit does in relation to other units, with which it forms a\ndyad, will often influence and be influenced by the relations of other dyads, such\nthat spatial dependence is likely to exist in many dyadic settings+ For example,\nthe conclusion of bilateral treaties by some countries often affects the expected\npayoffs of other countries from entering into similar treaties themselves+\nOne potential reason for the lack of studies analyzing spatial dependence in a\ndyadic framework is that political scientists are not aware of the many specifica-\ntion options for modeling such dependence in dyadic data+ Recognizing the vari-\nous ways in which spatial effects in dyadic data can be modeled will enable scholars\nto formulate and test different and novel diffusion channels, thus facilitating and\nhopefully spurring a whole new generation of studies analyzing spatial depen-\ndence between dyads of political units at all levels of the political system\u2014from\nthe global and international right down to the local+\nThis research note makes two contributions+ First, our analysis enriches the thriv-\ning literature applying dyadic data and calls on researchers to take spatial depen-\ndence in such data seriously+ Spatial dependence often seems to be theoretically\nwarranted but is practically always ignored+ For example, the conclusion of bilat-\neral and multilateral trade, investment, alliance, and other agreements among some\ndyads most likely influences the incentives for other dyads to conclude similar\nagreements+ The conclusion of such agreements often generates externalities,\nincreases competition, induces cooperation, or leads to coercion, learning, emula-\ntion, or other effects by which the policy choices of other dyads are affected+ Yet,\nto our knowledge only three studies analyze spatial dependence in the diffusion of\nbilateral investment treaties ~BITs!, preferential trade agreements, and bilateral alli-\nance formation, respectively+4 Another good example is the democratic peace lit-\nerature+ King argues that \u201cdyadic observations in international conflict data have\ncomplex dependence structures+ + + + @I#n dyadic data, observation 1 may be U+S+-\nIraq; observation 2, U+S+-Iran; and observation 3, Iraq-Iran+ The dependence among\nthese separate observations is complicated, central to our theories and the inter-\n2+ See, for example, Cho 2003; Murdoch and Sandler 2004; Simmons and Elkins 2004; Jahn 2006;\nFranzese and Hays 2006; Gleditsch and Ward 2006; Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006; Swank 2006; and\nBrooks 2007+\n3+ The rare examples of studies analyzing spatial dependence in dyadic data include Porojan 2001;\nManger 2006; Gartzke and Gleditsch 2006; and Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons 2006+\n4+ See Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons 2006; Manger 2006; and Gartzke and Gleditsch 2006,\nrespectively+\n146 International Organization\nnational system, critical for our methodological analyses, and ignored by most\nprevious researchers+\u201d5 We agree with this judgment+ Spatial dependence in inter-\nnational conflict is typically ignored,6 leading to biased estimates of the observed\ndyadic and unit-specific explanatory variables+ However, contrary to King we do\nnot believe that Bayesian hierarchical or random effects models provide the meth-\nodologically optimal solution if researchers are indeed interested in spatial effects+\nRather, the spatial dependence should be modeled directly by the inclusion of spa-\ntial effects in dyadic data analyses+ If theory suggests the existence of spatial depen-\ndence, then modeling spatial patterns as nuisance\u2014as in the \u201cspatial error\u201d model\nor King\u2019s hierarchical model\u2014will be inferior to directly testing for spatial depen-\ndence by fitting a spatial effect model, because none of the different possible \u201cnui-\nsance models\u201d allows for a direct test of the spatial hypotheses derived from the\ntheory+7\nSecond, the few studies that actually do analyze spatial dependence in dyadic\ndata do so in a limited way, focusing solely on aggregate forms of contagion+ A\ngood example is Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons\u2019s study of the diffusion of bilat-\neral investment treaties ~BITs!+8 The authors consider what we define further below\nas aggregate target contagion from capital-importing countries only, where the deci-\nsion of a capital importer to sign a BIT with a capital exporter depends on the\nweighted sum of BITs signed by all other capital importers, regardless of the poten-\ntial capital exporter with which these existing contracts have been signed+ Yet,\nthere is nothing in the theory of BIT diffusion that necessarily suggests such an\naggregate form of contagion being unconditional on the specific dyad under obser-\nvation+ From a theoretical perspective, it seems at least as plausible to argue that a\ncapital importer\u2019s BIT with a specific capital exporter depends on the BITs signed\nby other capital importers with that very same capital exporter\u2014but not with any\nother capital exporting country+\nThis research note discusses all possible forms of channels through which pol-\nicies may diffuse in dyadic data+ We start by briefly discussing spatial dependence\nin monadic settings before categorizing the different and complex ways of mod-\neling spatial effects in dyadic data+ We will show that in undirected dyadic data,\ndyads can spatially depend only on the policy choices of other dyads, which is\nsimilar to the monadic setting in which units can depend only on the policy choices\nof other units+ In directed dyadic data, there is more flexibility+ Here we have of\ncourse the same possibility of dyad contagion as in undirected data+ However,\ngiven that in directed data one can distinguish the source from the target of the\ninteraction, researchers can additionally model four more forms of contagion+ Two\nof these model contagion as emanating from the aggregate policy choices of other\n5+ King 2001, 498 ~emphasis in original!+\n6+ We are not aware of any dyadic conflict study that models spatial dependence+\n7+ Beck, Gleditsch, and Beardsley 2006+\n8+ Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons 2006+\nSpatial Effects in Dyadic Data 147\nsources and other targets, which leads to aggregate source contagion and aggre-\ngate target contagion, respectively+ If, however, contagion does not come from\nthe aggregate policy choices of other sources or other targets, but only from their\npolicy choices with respect to a specific third party, then we get the two remaining\nmodeling options of specific source contagion and specific target contagion, respec-\ntively+ In other words, the probability that source i interacts with target j increases\nif ~but only if ! i already interacts with other targets m similar to j or if j already\ninteracts with other sources k similar to i +\nTogether, there are thus five forms of contagion for directed dyadic data, which\ncan be combined with various specifications of the weighting matrix+ The spatial\nanalysis of dyadic data therefore offers multiple options to researchers and makes\nthe choice of the correct model a difficult task\u2014a task in which theory needs to\ninform the specification of the spatial effects in the empirical model+9\nIn order to demonstrate the full potential of modeling spatial dependence in\ndyadic data, we extend the analysis of Elkins and colleagues on the diffusion of\nBITs by modeling and testing all possible forms of spatial lags+ To our knowl-\nedge, their study was the first published article to include spatial lags in a directed\ndyadic sample and it is also commendable for clearly specifying and justifying\ntheir modeling approach+ Our analysis provides additional insights into the study\nof BIT diffusion+ While we find that Elkins and colleagues were right in arguing\nthat competition among capital-importing target countries drives BIT spillovers,\nour results suggest that a capital importer\u2019s decision to sign a BIT with a capital\nexporter depends only on similar importers\u2019 BITs with the very same capital\nexporter rather than on the similar importers\u2019 total number of BITs with any cap-\nital exporter+ In other words, we find that dyad-specific target contagion matters\nrather than aggregate target contagion+ In addition, we provide evidence that the\ndiffusion process also works through competition among capital-exporting source\ncountries: when other capital exporters have signed a BIT with a specific capital\nimporter, a capital exporting nation is more likely to also seek a BIT with the very\nsame capital importer+ Hence, here again, diffusion is driven by dyad-specific source\ncontagion+ Thus, we reproduce Elkins and colleagues\u2019 finding that the agreement\nof BITs between two countries spatially depends on the choices of other countries,\nbut we come to different conclusions with respect to the channels through which\nBITs diffuse+\nSpatial Dependence in Dyadic Data: A Categorization\nSpatial effects between two jurisdictions occur whenever the marginal utility of\none unit depends on the policy choices of at least one other unit+10 There is no\n9+ See also Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer forthcoming+\n10+ Franzese and Hays 2008, 3+\n148 International Organization\nshortage of theories predicting processes of policy diffusion and spillover across\nunits+11 All of these theories can also be applied to dyadic frameworks+ Moreover,\nthese theories are in principle compatible with all of the types of contagion we\nwill categorize in the sense that, depending on the context and the exact formula-\ntion of these theories, each theory can require one or more of these types of\ncontagion+\nDyadic data allows the modeling of far more complex forms of spatial depen-\ndence than monadic data+ To see why this is the case, we start with a brief expo-\nsition of spatial effects in monadic data, then discuss spatial dependence in dyadic\ndata in more detail+\nSpatial Dependence in Monadic Data\nBesides spatial error models, which are rarely useful for political science research,12\ntwo main ways of modeling spatial dependence exist+ By far the most popular\none, and the one we focus on in this study, is the spatial lag model, which regresses\nthe dependent variable on the spatially lagged dependent variable+ However, every-\nthing we say equally applies to spatial-x models, which regress the dependent vari-\nable on the weighted values of one or more independent explanatory variables\n~other than the dependent variable!, and to spatial error models, which seek to\nidentify spatial dependence in the error term+\nIn its simplest purely cross-sectional form without control variables, spatial lag\nmodels in a monadic dataset can be formulated as:\nyi \u0002 r(\nk\nwik yk\u0003 \u00abi + ~1!\nThe spatial lag (k wik yk consists of two elements, namely what in the following\nwe refer to as the \u201cspatial y\u201d and the spatial weighting matrix wik+13 The spatial y\nis the contemporaneous or temporally lagged value of the dependent variable in\nall units k+ This is multiplied with an N{N block-diagonal spatial weighting matrix,\nwhich measures the relative connectivity between N number of units i and N num-\nber of units k in the off-diagonal cells of the matrix ~the diagonal of the matrix has\nvalues of zero because there i \u0002 k and units cannot spatially depend on them-\nselves!+ The spatial autoregression

the basic model dis-\nplayed in equation ~1!, but they add control variables, use a cross-sectional time-\nseries dataset, control for temporal dynamics,14 control for common trends and\ncommon shocks with period dummies, and sometimes account for unobserved spa-\ntial heterogeneity ~or spatial clustering! with unit fixed effects+ To keep the expo-\nsition simple, in what follows we will ignore everything that distracts from the\nmodeling of spatial dependence itself and therefore employ the most basic cross-\nsectional setting, always keeping in mind that such a model can and should often\nbe extended to include a time dimension, dynamic modeling, control variables,\nand so on+15\nIn monadic data, the specification of spatial lags gives researchers some flexi-\nbility with respect to the variable that measures connectivity among units, but these\nspatial lags leave researchers little choice on the specification of the weighting\nmatrix or on the specification of the spatial y+16 Dyadic data allows more flexible\nand different specifications of both the weighting matrix and the spatial y+ Dyadic\ndata comes in two forms\u2014undirected and directed\u2014and we discuss the different\noptions for spatial lags available in both settings in turn after a brief introduction\nto the differences between monadic and dyadic data+\nDyadic Data\nDyadic data consists of observations in which two individual units form a pair\n~the dyad!+ There exist directed and undirected dyadic data+ In directed dyadic\ndata, the interaction between two dyad members ij initiates with i and is directed\ntoward j+ There is a source and a target, an origin and a destination, a sender and a\nrecipient, a giver and a taker, an aggressor and a victim, or some similar directed\nrelationship+ For example, in international trade one can distinguish between export-\ners and importers+ In foreign investment one can distinguish between home and\nhost countries+ In international migration or remittance flows, one can distinguish\nsending and recipient countries+ In interstate violent conflict, there exist aggressor\nand victim states, and so on+\nIn undirected dyadic data, it is either unclear from the data which of the two dyad\nmembers initiated the interaction or this question is theoretically unimportant+ There-\n14+ See Beck and Katz 1996; and Pl\u00fcmper, Troeger, and Manow 2005+\n15+ We will similarly neglect all issues of estimation of spatial lag models, which is complicated by\nthe fact that with interdependent units of analysis, spatial dependence models typically suffer from\nendogeneity ~see Anselin 1988; Ward and Gleditsch 2002; and Franzese and Hays 2006, 2007, and\n2008!+ There are also important specification choices that researchers need to consider, which we dis-\ncuss in a separate article ~Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer forthcoming!+\n16+ If the weighting variable used is directed, then researchers can specify wki instead of wik+ See\nsection on \u201cChoice of Weighting Matrices\u201d for more details+\n150 International Organization\nfore, while one can still distinguish i from j, one either cannot distinguish between\nij and ji or one does not want to make such a distinction+ Consequently, the vari-\nable of interest is identical for dyads ij and ji and researchers typically keep only\none or the other in their dataset to avoid \u201cdouble counting+\u201d17 Theory can typically\ndetermine the choice between undirected and directed dyadic data+ Take the con-\nclusion of a contract as an example+ If the contract is voluntarily entered or if it is\nof no further interest who was the initiator of the contract, then an undirected dyadic\ndataset suffices+ If, however, researchers have an interest in who initiated the con-\ntract or if contract agreement has not been reached voluntarily or if the contract\nmeans different things to the two contract partners, then this could, and in fact\nshould, be analyzed with a directed dyadic dataset+\nBilateral investment treaties ~BITs! provide a good example of a case in which\ncontracts mean different things to the two contracting partners+ These treaties grant\nforeign investors certain rights by limiting the policy autonomy of the govern-\nment of the country hosting the investment, whereas few, if any, costs are imposed\nby the treaty on either the foreign investor or its home government+18 BITs are, at\nleast putatively, entered voluntarily, and it is not always clear who initiated the\ntreaty+19 Nevertheless, even though in principle BITs are symmetric in that both\ngovernments face the same restrictions, in reality the vast majority of BITs have\nbeen concluded between countries with radically different net foreign investment\npositions+ For the predominantly capital-exporting country, the BIT mainly pro-\nvides rights to its investors with few actual restrictions on its policy autonomy,\nwhereas the predominantly capital-importing country experiences the full restric-\ntions on its policy autonomy ~which can still pay off due to the economic benefits\nof increased inward FDI!+ Because of the asymmetry of the treaty\u2019s effect, it makes\nsense to analyze the conclusion of BITs in a country dyad dataset that is directed\nfrom the capital-exporting to the capital-importing country, as Elkins and col-\nleagues do+ The decision to treat a dyadic relationship as directed or undirected\nthus requires theoretical justification+\nModeling Spatial Dependence in Undirected Dyads\nThe modeling of spatial dependence in undirected data strongly resembles that of\nmonadic data+ The only difference is that instead of contagion stemming from other\nunits, it comes from other dyads+ Hence, to model spatial dependence in undirected\ndyadic data researchers make the dependent variable in a dyad between i and j a\nfunction of the weighted sum of the dependent variable of all other dyads:\n17+ Undirected dyadic data are commonly used in the international conflict literature ~see Russett,\nOneal, and Davis 1998; and Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer 2001!+\n18+ See Guzman 1998; and Neumayer and Spess 2005+\n19+ Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons 2006 argue that capital-importing developing countries are the\nmajor initiators of BITs, whereas Neumayer 2006 argues that BITs predominantly initiate from capital-\nexporting developed countries+\nSpatial Effects in Dyadic Data 151\nyij \u0002 r (\nkm\u0004ij\nvpq ykm\u0003 \u00abij , ~2a!\nwhich due to the undirectedness of the dyadic dataset is equivalent to\nyji \u0002 r (\nmk\u0004ji\nvpq ymk\u0003 \u00abji + ~2b!\nWe have denoted the connectivity or weighting matrix as vpq+ Later we will\ndiscuss six different specifications of the weighting matrix, such that vpq \u0002 $wik,\nwki ,wjm,wmj ,w~ij !~km!,w~km!~ij !% , but these are not exhaustive since combinations of\nthese links can also be theoretically warranted+ We leave a detailed explanation\nand discussion of the weighting matrix until then+\nEquations ~2a! and ~2b! are appropriate if, for example, one thinks that the deci-\nsion of whether country i and country j enter into a voluntary treaty depends on\nthe weighted sum of existing treaties in all other dyads, where the weight is given\nby vpq+ This form of contagion we call undirected dyad contagion+20 It is the mod-\neling strategy adopted in Manger\u2019s analysis of the diffusion of preferential trade\nagreements and in Gleditsch and Gartzke\u2019s analysis of the effect of alliance ties\non international conflict+21\nModeling Spatial Dependence in Directed Dyads\nBoth monadic and undirected dyadic data offer only one option each for modeling\ncontagion+ In contrast, there are five options for modeling spatial dependence if\nwe analyze directed dyadic data+ The reason is that in directed dyads two actors i\nand j have an asymmetric interaction and one can distinguish dyads ij, where unit\ni is the source and unit j is the target, from dyads ji where these roles are reversed+\nThis means contagion can come from other dyads, as in undirected dyadic data,\nbut contagion can also come from other sources or from other targets+ Moreover,\nwhere contagion stems from other sources or other targets, it can be their aggre-\ngate policy choices that matter or their choices with respect to only the specific\ndyad under consideration+\nStarting with the option that directly resembles the modeling of spatial depen-\ndence in undirected dyadic data, dyad ij can be modeled to be more likely to sign\na BIT if other dyads between capital-exporting and capital-importing countries\n20+ Undirected dyad contagion can be further restricted such that all dyads containing either unit i\nor unit j are excluded from having a contagious effect+ Such exclusive undirected dyad contagion would\nbe represented by yij \u0002 r(k\u0004i,m\u0004jvpq ykm \u0003 \u00abij +\n21+ See Manger 2006; and Gartzke and Gleditsch 2006+\n152 International Organization\nhave already agreed on such a treaty+ This form of spatial dependence we call\ndirected dyad contagion+22 Hence:\nyij \u0002 r (\nkm\u0004ij\nvpq ykm\u0003 \u00abij + ~3!\nEquation ~3! describes a situation in which the probability of two countries i\nand j signing a BIT depends on the weighted sum of all other BITs existing between\ncapital-exporting countries k and capital-importing countries m+\nIn directed dyad contagion, the aggregate policy choices of other, similar dyads\nmatter+ In the remaining four forms of contagion in directed dyadic data, one can,\nfirst, assume that the aggregate policy choices of other sources and other targets\nmatter+ In addition, one can also assume that only a subset of the sources ~targets!\ninfluence the dyad under observation, namely those sources ~targets!, which are\nlinked to the target ~source! of the dyad under observation+ If the policy choice of\nthe directed dyad ij spatially depends on the aggregate actions of other sources k\n~\u0004 i !, that is on their relationship with all other targets m, not just the specific\ntarget j, then we get what we name aggregate source contagion:\nyij \u0002 r(\nk\u0004i\n(\nm\nvpq ykm\u0003 \u00abij ~4!\nAlternatively, one can make the policy choice of dyad ij depend on the aggre-\ngate actions of other targets m, that is, on their policy choices with all other sources\nk, not just the specific source i + This leads to aggregate target contagion:\nyij \u0002 r(\nk\n(\nm\u0004j\nvpq ykm\u0003 \u00abij ~5!\nEquation ~5! is appropriate if the BIT decision of dyad ij spatially depends on\nthe aggregate or total number of BITs that other capital importers m ~\u0004 j ! have\nconcluded with any capital-exporting country k+\nAdditionally, instead of policy choices depending on the aggregate choices of\nother sources or targets, they may well depend on the choices of other sources or\ntargets in relation to the specific dyad under consideration+ With\nyij \u0002 r(\nk\u0004i\nvpq ykj\u0003 \u00abij ~6!\n22+ As in the undirected case, directed dyad contagion can similarly be further restricted such that\nall dyads containing either source i or target j are excluded from having a contagious effect+ Such\nexclusive directed dyad contagion would be represented by yij \u0002 r (\nk\u00b0i,m\u0004j\nvpq ykm\u0003 \u00abij +\nSpatial Effects in Dyadic Data 153\nthe probability of, say, two countries i and j signing a BIT depends on the weighted\nsum of BITs signed by other capital-exporting countries k with the very same\ncapital-importing country j+ This we name specific source contagion+ In compari-\nson to the aggregate source contagion represented by equation ~4!, equation ~6!\ndescribes a situation in which other sources k affect i \u2019s interaction with j only if\ncountries k have signed a BIT with the very same target country j+ In other words,\nCanada\u2019s interest in signing BITs with capital importers remains largely unaffected\nby the total number of BITs the United States, Germany, France, and others have\nsigned+ However, if the United States, Germany, France, and others sign a BIT\nwith\u2014say Chile\u2014the incentive for Canada to also sign a BIT with Chile increases+\nLastly, in equation ~7! country j\u2019s incentive to sign a BIT with country i depends\non the weighted sum of BITs signed by other capital importing countries m with\nthe very same capital-exporting country i:\nyij \u0002 r (\nm\u0004j\nvpq yim\u0003 \u00abij , ~7!\nThis type of spatial dependence we call specific target contagion+ Compared to\nthe aggregate target contagion described by equation ~5!, equation ~7! describes a\nsituation in which other targets m affect j \u2019s interaction with i only if countries m\nhave signed a BIT with the very same source country i + In other words, Chile\u2019s\ninterest in signing BITs with capital exporters remains largely unaffected by the\ntotal number of BITs Argentina and Brazil have signed+ However, if Argentina\nand Brazil sign a BIT with\u2014say the United States\u2014the incentive for Chile to also\nsign a BIT with the United States increases+\nThe Choice of Weighting Matrices\nThe specification of spatial effects requires two choices+ First, the researcher needs\nto specify the spatial y, as discussed above+ Second, one also needs to specify the\ntype of weighting matrix used to model the connectivity between units or dyads\nthat form the spatial dependence+23\nIn monadic data analysis, the weighting matrix provides a link between unit i\nand units k+ For each observation yi , the corresponding element of the spatial lag\ngives a weighted sum of the yk observations, with weights always given by the\nrelative connectivity between i and k+ Hence, the spatial effect is a weighted func-\ntion of the dependent variable in all other units k+ The connectivity can be directed\nas with, say, exports+ This leads to two possible link functions, namely, vpq\u0002 wik,\nwhich would measure exports from i to k; and vpq \u0002 wki , which would measure\n23+ We do not discuss the issue of row-standardization here+ It is an important issue ~see Pl\u00fcmper\nand Neumayer forthcoming!\u2014but equally important for monadic and dyadic data+\n154 International Organization\nexports from k to i + If the connectivity is undirected as with, for example, conti-\nguity or geographical distance, then there is only one link function since wik\u0002 wki +\nCompared to monadic data, the choice of weighting matrix becomes more com-\nplicated in dyadic data+ Starting with undirected dyadic data, we distinguish basic\nfrom more complex link functions+As for the basic ones, the effect of the spatial y\nmay be weighted by a link function measuring connectivity between either unit i\nor unit j on the one hand and other units, called k~\u0004 i ! or m~\u0004 j !, on the other\nhand+ Formally, the weighting matrix vpq can thus take the following four differ-\nent forms: vpq\u0002 wik, vpq\u0002 wki , vpq\u0002 wjm, or vpq\u0002 wmj + Note that there are four\n~rather than two! basic link functions because even if the spatial y is undirected,\nthe variable of connectivity can of course be directed+ If connectivity is undirected,\nhowever, then there are only two basic link functions: vpq \u0002 wik \u0002 wki and vpq\n\u0002 wjm\u0002 wmj + More complex functions link dyads rather than units with each other+\nThese will be discussed shortly for directed data+ Finally, one can create further\nlink functions by combining any of these link functions with each other in any\nway+\nIn directed dyadic data, it is useful again to distinguish basic link functions, that\nis, those that link either sources or targets with each other, from more complex link\nfunctions that link dyads with each other+ As for basic link functions, in aggregate\nand specific source contagion the link function can represent connectivity between\nthe source unit i and other source units k ~vpq \u0002 wik or vpq \u0002 wki !+24 Whereas in\naggregate and specific target contagion it can measure connectivity between the tar-\nget unit j and other target units m ~vpq\u0002wjm or vpq\u0002wmj !+25 In directed dyad con-\ntagion, any of the four basic link functions just presented can be used+\nLink functions that represent connectivity between dyads are more complex and\nare bound to be employed far less commonly than the more basic link functions+26\nFor aggregate and specific source contagion, the link function can represent con-\nnectivity between the dyad ij and dyads kj, that is, connectivity between the dyad\nconsisting of source unit i and target unit j on the one hand and dyads made up of\nother source units k and the same target unit j on the other hand+ This leads to\neither vpq\u0002 w~ij !~kj ! or vpq\u0002 w~kj !~ij !+ For aggregate and specific target contagion,\nthe link function can measure connectivity between the dyad ij and dyads im, that\nis, connectivity between the dyad consisting of source unit i and target unit j on\nthe one hand and dyads comprised of the same source unit i and other target units\n24+ Strictly speaking, other link functions are possible ~for example, the weighting matrix could\nmeasure connectivity between i and m!, but these two are the most plausible ones+ A similar point\napplies, mutatis mutandis, to the weighting matrices listed for aggregate and specific target contagion+\n25+ As before, these collapse to one each if connectivity is undirected+\n26+ The reason is that in order to create these complex link functions one needs a dataset that links\ndyads with dyads, that is, a so-called 4-adic dataset with dimension ~Ni{Nj!~Ni{Nj!T, where Ni is the\nnumber of sources, Nj the number of targets and T the number of time periods+ For many applications,\nthis would lead to a dataset too big to be handled by a personal computer+ In contrast, the Stata ado-\nfiles provided by the authors can create spatial lags employing the more basic link functions from a\nsimple dyadic dataset of dimension ~Ni{Nj! T as they parse through a virtual 4-adic dataset+\nSpatial Effects in Dyadic Data 155\nTABLE 1.

Other\nfunctional forms may be theoretically warranted in certain cases+\nSummary\nWe have categorized all possible forms of spatial dependence along the distinc-\ntion between monadic data, undirected dyadic data, and directed dyadic data+ Table 1\nsummarizes all the available specification options for spatial lags+\nClearly, not only does the proper specification of the spatial y become more\nflexible when researchers move from monadic to undirected dyadic data and from\nthere to directed dyadic data28\u2014researchers also gain degrees of freedom in the\nspecification of the weighting matrices+ The increased flexibility means that the\nanalysis of spatial effects in dyadic data sets requires much more theoretical rea-\nsoning than in monadic data+ Researchers need to consider what type of contagion\ntheir theoretical model demands and also justify the specification of the weighting\nmatrix+\nApplication: Spatial Dependence in a Directed\nCountry Dyad Sample of BIT Diffusion\nIn order to demonstrate how the different forms of spatial dependence can lead to\ndifferent insights on the process of policy diffusion, we build on and extend Elkins\nand colleagues\u2019 analysis of the diffusion of BITs over the period 1970 to 2000\nusing a Cox proportional hazard model+29 They argue that competition among poten-\ntial host countries, typically developing countries, for FDI causes the diffusion of\nBITs+30 We restrict our analysis to dyads in which source countries i are Western\ndeveloped countries and countries j ~targets! are developing countries, giving us

the\nweighting matrix: export-market, export-product, and infrastructure competition+\nFor our application we use export-product competition, which we regard as theo-\nretically most plausible+32 The weighting matrix thus measures the extent to which\ncountries export a similar basket of goods+33\nElkins and colleagues analyze a variant of aggregate target contagion by esti-\nmating a variant of equation ~5!, namely\nyijt \u0002 r(\nk\n(\nm\u0004j\nwjmt\u00051 ykmt\u00051* \u0003 \u00abijt + ~8!\nwhere y * is the sum total of BITs in force in each host country in year t\u00051+34 Note\nthat by using y * rather than y in the spatial dependence variable, this is not strictly\nspeaking a spatial lag model+ Spatial dependence derives from the sum total of exist-\ning BITs in other developing countries m in year t\u00051, with connectivity repre-\nsented by a row-standardized matrix that measures connectivity between j and m,\nthat is, by export-product competition among developing countries+ In other words,\na developing country j is more likely to sign a BIT with a developed country i at\ntime t if other developing countries m with a similar basket of export-products have\na larger sum total of BITs in place with developed countries k in the period t\u00051+\nTo this, we add all the other possible forms of spatial dependence, which are all\nconsistent with common micro-foundations seeking to explain the spread of BITs+\nWe do so in order to show what happens to the results of Elkins and colleagues,\nbut also because these other forms can be theoretically justified+ To start, we will\nanalyze aggregate source contagion by estimating a variant of equation ~4!, namely\nyijt \u0002 r(\nk\u0004i\n(\nm\nwikt\u00051 ykmt\u00051* \u0003 \u00abijt + ~9!\nThe

at 10% level; **significant at 5% level; ***significant at 1% level+\nvariables that do not vary across dyads ~the flexible baseline hazard captures their\neffect!+ To be consistent with their analysis we do not instrument for the spatial\nlags or apply spatial maximum likelihood even though this may be warranted given\nserial correlation in the data, in which case the use of spatial lags temporally lagged\nby one time period cannot fully solve the endogeneity problem+ Importantly, we\nnormalize the spatial effect variables to fall into the interval from 0 to 100 by\ndividing each lag by its maximum and multiplying by 100+ We do this because\nbefore normalization the spatial effect variables are in different units, given that\nwe follow Elkins and colleagues\u2019 use of y *, the sum total of BITs in force, rather\nthan y for aggregate target and source contagion+ Normalization allows us to directly\ncompare the relative importance of all the spatial effect variables with each other\nwithout needing to compute conditional effects+\nModels 1 to 5 in Table 2 estimate the effect of each spatial lag separately+ In\ncolumn ~1!, the spatial lag models aggregate target contagion+ The lag coefficient\nis positive and statistically significant, corroborating the finding of Elkins and col-\nleagues that the aggregate past behavior of other developing countries with simi-\nlar export-product structures matters for the conclusion of a BIT between a\ndeveloped and a developing country+ In column ~2!, the spatial lag models source\ncontagion instead+ The lag coefficient is statistically insignificant, suggesting that\nthe aggregate past behavior of other export-competing developed countries does\nnot matter for the agreement on BITs+\nIn column ~3!, we move away from aggregate behavior and the spatial lag mod-\nels specific target contagion+ The lag coefficient is positive and highly significant,\nsuggesting that a developing country is more likely to sign a BIT with a specific\ndeveloped country if other developing countries with similar export-product struc-\ntures have an existing BIT with the same developed country+ Column ~4! reports a\nmodel of specific source contagion+ The coefficient of this spatial lag is again pos-\nitive and statistically significant+ This result qualifies the finding of column ~2!+\nThe aggregate BIT behavior of other competing developed countries as such does\nnot matter, but if other competing developed countries have signed a BIT with a\nspecific developing country, then this makes it more likely that a developed coun-\ntry will also sign a BIT with this specific developing country j+ In column ~5!, we\ntest directed dyad contagion, which does not have an effect statistically different\nfrom zero+ Accordingly, we find no evidence that a developing country is more\nlikely to sign a BIT with a developed country if other developing countries with\nan export-product structure similar to the developing country have previously signed\nBITs with other developed countries that have an export-product structure similar\nto the developed country+\nSo far, we have included the spatial lag variables separately+ However, these\nspatial lags could be correlated with each other+ A harder test of the various diffu-\nsion channels thus requires their joint inclusion in one model+ Unfortunately, the\naggregate source and target contagion spatial lags are so highly correlated with\neach other that their simultaneous inclusion leads to severe multicollinearity prob-\nlems, whereas the correlations among the other spatial lag variables remain mod-\n162 International Organization\nerate+ We therefore present two sets of regressions, one including all spatial lags\nbut the aggregate source contagion one\u2014column ~6!\u2014and the other including all\nspatial lags but the aggregate target contagion one\u2014column ~7!+ Strikingly, with\nthe dyadic contagion spatial lags included, aggregate target contagion no longer\nmatters+ Instead, we find evidence that the diffusion of BITs works exclusively\nthrough specific source and target contagion+ Column ~8! reports the results from\na model which includes only these two significant forms of contagion+\nOne can also compare the goodness of fit of the estimated models with each\nother+ Note that each of Models 1 to 5, which estimate separate and isolated forms\nof contagion, are nested in either Model 6 or 7+ Both the Akaike Information Cri-\nterion ~AIC! and the Bayesian Information Criterion ~BIC! suggest that Models 6\nand 7 fit the data better than the restricted Models 1 to 5+ This suggests that the\nmodels with multiple forms of contagion perform better than all models with indi-\nvidual forms of contagion+ However, Model 8, which includes only specific source\nand target contagion has the lowest AIC and BIC of all the models+ Since Model 8\nis itself nested in both Models 6 and 7, this suggests that aggregate source and\ntarget contagion do not improve the model fit relative to a model that contains\nonly dyad-specific forms of source and target contagion+ From this perspective,\nModel 8 is clearly superior to all other models+\nThe normalization of spatial lag variables allows us to assess their relative sub-\nstantive importance+ We find that the effect of the specific target contagion spatial\nlag is about twice as large as the effect of the specific source contagion lag, sug-\ngesting the former is the substantively more important diffusion channel+ In con-\nclusion, we find that Elkins and colleagues were right in arguing that competition\namong developing countries exerts an important influence on the diffusion of BITs+\nHowever, policies do not diffuse via competition among capital importers at the\naggregate level, but via their competition at the dyad-specific level+ In addition,\nElkins and colleagues neglected competition among developed countries for sign-\ning BITs with specific developing countries, which also has a statistically signifi-\ncant, but substantively less important effect compared to competition among\ndeveloping countries+\nOur findings are consistent with several theories of policy diffusion+ It seems,\nhowever, that theories of policy learning and bargaining theories of policy conces-\nsions explain the specific forms of BIT diffusion better than theories of economic\ncompetition+ If theories of competition were valid, one should find evidence for\nthe aggregate form of diffusion that Elkins and colleagues have modeled+ If other\ncompeting capital importers and exporters agree on BITs, then this should affect\nthe allocation of investment flows across countries since BITs reduce the risk of\nforeign investment, thereby inducing a capital importer or exporter to react by\nsimilarly seeking to conclude more BITs+ Yet, the superiority of specific forms of\ncontagion in our empirical analysis suggests that other governments learn from a\nBIT that the two signatory countries are indeed willing to sign BITs with other\npartners as well+ A capital importer that accepts a BIT with one capital-exporting\ncountry is less likely to resist another capital exporter\u2019s suggestion to also agree\nSpatial Effects in Dyadic Data 163\non a BIT+ The same applies for a capital exporter: having signed a BIT with one\ncapital importer signals willingness to conclude a BIT with another capital importer\nas well+ In addition, our results inform the debate over whether BITs mainly serve\nas a commitment or signaling device+38 If capital importers sign BITs to signal to\nany potential investor an investment-friendly domestic climate, then aggregate tar-\nget contagion should matter: if one\u2019s competitors have concluded more BITs then\none needs to conclude more BITs to send a firm signal to potential investors+ That\naggregate target contagion does not seem to matter suggests that BITs mainly serve\nas a commitment device to protect investment from the specific capital exporter\nwith whom a BIT has been concluded+\nConclusion\nSpatial analyses can be fruitfully extended to dyadic relations between countries\nor other political units+ In particular, we have shown that the menu of choice\nincreases by moving from monadic to undirected dyadic data and increases fur-\nther still when analyzing directed dyadic data+ We have illustrated the modeling\npossibilities in directed dyadic data by extending Elkins and colleagues\u2019 analysis\nof the diffusion of BITs+ Elkins and colleagues correctly argued that competition\namong capital importers determines the spread of BITs, but we conclude that the\ndiffusion of BITs is more specific, with a capital importer\u2019s decision to sign a BIT\nwith a capital exporter depending only on whether other competing capital import-\ners have signed a BIT with this very same capital exporter and not just with any\ncapital exporter+ In addition, we found evidence for similar dyad-specific source\ncontagion working via competition among capital exporters+\nIn our application, all types of contagion have theoretical plausibility and were\ntherefore tested+ In general, however, researchers should not mine the data for poten-\ntial evidence of all types of contagion but test only those types of contagion spec-\nified by their theory+ Aggregate source and0or target contagion will often be a\nplausible diffusion channel, but the specific channels can be equally, if not more\nappropriate+ To give but three examples+ In the bipolar world of the Cold War\nperiod one might theorize that alliances diffused primarily via directed dyad con-\ntagion: if the Soviet Union allied with, say, India this increased the likelihood that\nthe United States would ally with neighboring Pakistan+ With economic sanctions,\none might consider specific source contagion as most appropriate: as some states\nimpose sanctions on a specific target, the likelihood increases that other states will\nfollow suit+ With preferential bilateral trade agreements between developed and\ndeveloping countries, one might theorize that diffusion works mainly via specific\ntarget and specific source contagion+ If, say, Chile has managed to conclude such\n38+ See Neumayer and Spess 2005+\n164 International Organization\nan agreement with the United States, other developing countries such as Peru,\nColombia, and Panama will want to conclude a similar treaty with the United States,\nwhile other developed countries such as Canada, the European Union, and Japan\nseek a similar treaty with Chile+ A better understanding of the full set of options\nof specifying spatial effects in dyadic data will allow formulating and testing novel\nhypotheses predicting dependence of a dyad of two political units on the policy\nchoices of other sources, other targets, or other dyads+\nReferences\nAnselin, Luc+
