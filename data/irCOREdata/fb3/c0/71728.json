The question of who in society \npotentially experiences these impacts through living near to emission sources has been little \nexplored, at least in the UK.  This paper reports on a study carried out for the Environment \nAgency, which examined the distribution of sites coming within the Industrial Pollution Control \n(IPC) regime against patterns of deprivation. Our analysis provides evidence of a socially \nunequal distribution of IPC sites in England, with sites disproportionately located and \nclustered together in deprived areas and near to deprived populations. In discussing these \nresults we emphasise the methodological limitations of this form of environmental justice \nanalysis and the crucial differences between proximity, risk and impact. We also consider the \ndistinction between inequality and injustice and the difficult policy questions which arise when \nevaluating evidence of environmental inequality, including potential grounds for policy \nintervention.   \n   \n 2 \nIntroduction  \n \nIndustrial pollution attracts both intense regulatory attention and, periodically, public anxiety \nand concern. Major industrial installations are a source of a diverse range of pollutants \nleading to potentially significant but disputed health impacts (Bhopal et al 1998, Pless-Mulloli \net al 1998, Dunn and Kingham 1996). When set alongside other negative impacts such as \nnoise, odour and, in some cases, stigmatization of both places and local people (Bush et al \n2001, Powe and Willis 1998, Simmons and Walker 2004), industrial sites may become a \nsignificant burden on local communities.  This burden often fails to be compensated by the \neconomic benefits of local jobs and income, particularly as patterns of traditional association \nand dependency between companies and local communities have broken down (Irwin et al \n1999).   \nWhilst the local burden of potential and experienced industrial pollution is widely recognized, \nthe question of who in society is taking this burden has been less explored, at least in the UK.  \nWhen we talk of impacts on the local public and community, what types of people and \ncommunity are involved?  Are there patterns in the socio-spatial distribution of industrial \ninstallations which mean that certain groups are more likely to experience negative impacts \nfrom such sites than others?  If the pattern of distribution of industrial polluters is socially \nunequal, can this be characterized as a distribution that is also socially inequitable and unjust \nand in need of some form of policy intervention?  Does such environmental inequality \ncontribute to or exacerbate more established and proven concerns about health inequalities \nfor deprived and social excluded communities?   \nSuch questions of environmental equity and justice have been researched for some time in \nthe US (Bryant 2003). Multiple empirical studies at different scales and with varying spatial \ncoverage have examined the distribution of industrial and waste sites principally in relation to \npatterns of ethnicity. The US Environmental Protection Agency has also, over the last decade, \ndeveloped and implemented policies that seek to incorporate environmental justice concerns \ninto regulatory practice and processes of interaction with local communities (Eady 2003).  In \nthe UK, we are at a far earlier stage of analysis and development of policy.  Environmental \n 3 \njustice is emerging as new policy discourse in which the interrelationships between \nenvironmental and social justice are being broadly conceived (Agyeman and Evans 2004) \nand environmental researchers are increasingly turning their attention to questions of \ndistribution, equity and justice (Lucas et al 2004).  However, there are still major gaps in our \nunderstanding of the socio-spatial landscape of environmental benefits and burdens which \nboth empirical and more theoretically-driven research need to address.    \nThis paper reports on a study carried out for the Environment Agency for England and Wales, \nwhich, amongst a number of other analyses, examined the distribution of sites coming within \nthe Industrial Pollution Control (IPC) regime against patterns of deprivation in England and \nWales1 (see Mitchell and Walker 2003 and Walker et al 2003 for a discussion of the overall \nresearch project). Our objective is not just to report on the empirical results of this work, but \nalso to consider the methodological and conceptual issues which complicate the interpretation \nof the evidence produced and the policy implications and complexities that then emerged.   \n \nThe social distribution of industrial pollution: existing research  \n \nMuch of the environmental justice research in the US that has accumulated over the last 20 \nyears, has focused on the locations of industrial and waste installations (Davidson 2003). The \ntotal body of research covers a wide range of scales of analysis (from local to national), \nenvironmental variables (some attempting to take account of different levels or toxicity of \nemissions as recorded in the Toxic Release Inventory) and social variables (largely ethnicity, \nbut also class, income, age, population density) (Liu 2001). There has been much debate \nabout the conclusions that can reasonably be inferred from this research, with a particular \nfocus on allegations of discriminatory siting practices.  Some observers have concluded that, \n                                                     \n1 Whist the research project separately analysed data for England and Wales, this paper considers only \nthe results for England.  However, the differences revealed between patterns of distribution for England \nand Wales are discussed in evaluating evidence and examining issues of scale in environmental equity \nanalysis. \n 4 \ncollectively, these US studies show that the location of polluting factories and waste facilities \nare biased towards areas with a higher proportion of black or hispanic populations, and to a \nlesser extent areas of lower social class (Szasz and Meuser 1997). However, others have \npointed to the existence of contradictory results and the low quality of many of the higher \nprofile pieces of equity research (Bowen 2002, Davidson 2003). Bowen and Wells (2002) are \nparticularly critical describing a 'rhetoric-reality gap' in which the many claims for \nenvironmental injustice, including some which have significantly influenced national policy, \nhave not been adequately supported by evidence from thorough, systematic research.  Liu \n(2001) similarly argues from a US perspective that whilst there has been an improvement in \nthe quality of research, there are still many methodological issues to be wrestled with and that \nconsequently environmental justice analysis should be viewed as in a \u2018pre-paradigm\u2019 stage of \ndevelopment. \n \nIn the UK the range and depth of research examining the location of industrial pollution is far \nmore limited than in the US. At the time of undertaking our research, there were only three \nexisting studies examining the distribution of IPC sites, all of which examine patterns of \ndistribution against social class (measured as income or indicators of deprivation). This focus \non social class is typical of the emerging environmental justice field in the UK generally and \nreflects different political priorities to the US where race has been the dominant concern \n(Ayegman and Evans 2004). The first study by Friends of the Earth (FoE) (2000) was \ngroundbreaking in constituting the first large scale empirical environmental justice study \nundertaken for any topic in the UK. This examined IPC site locations against average income \nestimates for postcode sectors in England and Wales and found a strong bias towards low \nincome areas - 662 IPC sites were located in areas with an annual average household \nincome of less than \u00a315 000, with only 6 factories in areas where average annual incomes \nwere greater than \u00a330 000. A second study by FoE (2001) analysed levels of carcinogenic \nemissions from IPC sites against the index of deprivation at ward level for England and found \nthat 82 % of carcinogen emissions occurred in the most deprived 20% of wards (FoE 2001). A \nsimple analysis undertaken by the Environment Agency (2002) also analysed the locations of \nIPC sites in England against the index of multiple deprivation, using a measure of number of \n 5 \nsites per square kilometre within wards.  In line with the FoE results this found a strong \nrelationship, with the density of IPC sites increasing as deprivation increases.  A later study \nby Wheeler (2004) included IPC sites in a complex analysis of environmental indices against \nvarious indicators of deprivation derived from the census. He found that an emission index \nconstructed for IPC sites was consistently related to deprivation across four groupings of \ncensus wards \u2013 wholly urban, predominantly urban, urban-rural and wholly rural.   \n \nAt the point of embarking on our project the existing evidence base was very limited and \nwhen compared to some of the \u2018better quality\u2019 studies undertaken in the US, exhibited two key \nmethodological weaknesses (Liu 2001, Mitchell and Walker 2005). First, the relationship \nbetween site and surrounding population had been evaluated simply through the location of \neach site in an area delineated for administrative purposes (wards or postcode sectors). \nSecond, all IPC sites had been treated as equal with no differentiation in the analysis to \nreflect the different scale of operations and\/or characteristics of emissions to different \nenvironmental media. Our project research design therefore sought to attend to both these \nmethodological weakness - although as discussed later could not fully resolve either.   \n \nMethods of Analysis    \n \nIn order to relate the IPC and deprivation data two approaches were taken to spatial analysis: \n \n1) a simple \u2018spatial coincidence\u2019 analysis counting sites in census wards; \n2) a buffer analysis, delineating a circle around each site within which population deprivation \ncharacteristics could then be analysed, taking account of population distribution within the \ncircle.  \n \nThe second of these two approaches is superior in that each site is treated consistently in \nterms of the size and shape of spatial unit that is \u2018attached\u2019 to the site, rather than relying \nupon the administrative geography of ward shapes and sizes (Liu 2001).  It also takes \naccount of the fact that some areas around IPC sites may in fact be largely or entirely devoid \n 6 \nof people by using postcode data to estimate numbers of people within the circle around each \nsite (see Walker et al 2003 for a detailed discussion of the method applied). Hence the focus \nin this second method is on numbers of people at risk (and their deprivation characteristics) \nrather than assuming that each IPC site affects similar numbers of people, or that people are \nequally distributed within a ward or buffer area.   In drawing circles around sites we used four \ndistances (500m, 1km, 2km, and 4km) which on the advice of the Agency represented the \nrange of likely spatial extents for airborne emissions.  Using buffers also enabled us to \nexamine the occurrence of site clustering and the characteristics of people living near to \nmultiple IPC sites (analysis which has rarely been undertaken in any previous studies; Krieg \nand Faber 2004). \n \nThree methods were used to differentiate between IPC sites and to explore their salient \ncharacteristics, rather than treating all sites as equal:   \n \n1) data analysis was undertaken not just for numbers of sites, but also for the number of \nauthorizations at these sites and numbers of separate authorized emissions (Each IPC site \ncan have more than one polluting process and each of these processes has to have a \nseparate authorisation). Each authorisation then has an often  long list of permitted emissions \nof different substances to different environmental media.  The significance of these elements \nof the 2001 IPC inventory database can be seen by the fact that it included 1131 sites, but \n1467 authorisations and 11484 emission sources.   \n \n2) the sites were divided into the six main industrial sectors identified in the IPC regulations to \nsee if different patterns existed for different types of polluting industry.  \n \n3) the scores assigned to each IPC sites under the Operator and Pollution Risk Appraisal \n(OPRA) system were used to differentiate between the levels of hazard and noxious \nemissions from each site (Environment Agency 1997).  Scores are given by Environment \nAgency inspectors to authorised processes against 7 criteria (see Table 1) which are \ncombined to give an overall Pollution Hazard Appraisal score.   \n 7 \n [TABLE 1 HERE] \n \nThe PHA score provides a way of differentiating the pollution hazard presented by different \nsites in a qualitative but locally informed and holistic manner \u2013 account is taken not only of \ntotal emissions but also factors of toxicity, the nature of operations and the existence of \npollution control systems. Attempting to differentiate between sites on the basis of substance \nby substance emissions data in the pollution inventory (as for example attempted in a number \nof US studies, Liu 2001) would be far more involved, but also far cruder.   \n \nIn order to relate IPC site locations and characteristics to deprivation, the Index of Multiple \nDeprivation (IMD) for 2000 was used at ward level.  The IMD has become the most widely \nused official data set on deprivation in the UK, and provides a ranked overall deprivation \nscore, constructed from six separate domains addressed by 33 separate indicators (DETR, \n2000). Using this composite index provides a multidimensional measure of deprivation, but \nthere are some limitations arising particularly from the way in which the \u2018access to services\u2019 \ndomain is inversely associated with the other five domains.  Because of the method of \ncalculation, a ward with an IMD rank of 100 is not necessarily twice as deprived as a ward \nwith a rank of 200. For this reason the deprivation analysis was undertaken by dividing all of \nthe wards into ten population weighted deciles, from least to most deprived, which maintain \nthe ranked ordinal form of the data. In order to create these deciles wards were first ranked in \nterms of deprivation, and the deprivation ranked wards placed into deciles of approximately \nequal population (see column 2 in Table 3). Deciles of equal population are preferred to those \nof equal ward count as the analysis then gives a population based, not area based distribution \nof polluting industrial sites.  \n \nGiven the ordinal nature of the deprivation data some of the statistical techniques typically \nused in environmental justice studies (such as correlation and regression analysis) were not \nappropriate.  We therefore calculated the Concentration Index (CI) for each distribution across \nthe deciles in order to provide a comparative statistical indicator of inequality. The CI is \n 8 \nclosely related to the simpler Gini coefficient which has been widely adopted as a measure of \nincome and health inequalities (Wagstaff et al. 1991) and also recently applied to \nenvironmental equity research (Lejano et al. 2002). A value of zero indicates complete \nequality (i.e. the proportion of the population living near to an IPC sites would be identical for \nall deprivation deciles) whilst values of 1 and -1 indicate extreme inequality in positive or \nnegative relationships with deprivation2. \n \n \nSpatial patterns of industrial pollution against social deprivation \n \nThe discussion of results for England begins with an overview of general patterns of IPC site \ndistribution without differentiating between different types of sites or site characteristics.  \nDifferent forms of differentiation and approaches to analysis are then introduced.  \n \nUsing the \u2018spatial coincidence\u2019 method of analysis, Table 2 shows that for sites, authorisations \nand emissions there is a strong relationship with deprivation. Wards in the most deprived \ndecile (number 1) providing the location for five times as many sites and authorisations and \nseven times as many emission sources as the wards in the least deprived decile (number 10).  \nAs indicated by the CI values, counting sites provides the marginally weaker relationship with \ndeprivation, whilst counting emission sources provides the strongest, indicating that the sites \nin the more deprived wards have a greater number of emissions per site (on average) than \nsites in the less deprived wards.   \n \n[TABLE 2 HERE] \n \n                                                     \n2 The CI does not provide an indicator of the significance of inequality, which will always be an ethical \nand political judgement, and is best used in a comparative setting. It is useful to note, however, that the \nvalue for income inequality in the UK from 1979 to 2001 has increased from 0.25 to 0.35 (Shephard \n2003). Gini values for income inequality in the USA, by comparison, are currently around 0.45. \n \n 9 \nRepeating the analysis using the buffer method (Table 3) produces a similar but more \naccentuated relationship with deprivation. The disproportionate concentration of the most \ndeprived populations near to IPC sites is highlighted, with the highest percentage consistently \nin the most deprived decile for all 4 buffer distances, followed by an almost universally \nconsistent fall through to the least deprived decile.   The CI values for the 500m, 1km and \n2km buffers all indicate a greater inequality than the CI value of 0.22 for the site in ward count \nmethod. For the ward count method the ratio between least and most deprived ward decile is \n4:1 \u2013 there are four times more sites in decile 1 compared to decile 10.  For the site buffer \nmethod the ratios are between 5:1 and 6:1 for the buffer distances 500m, 1km and 2km.  The \nfall in CI values between the 500m and 2km distances indicate that the concentration on \ndeprived populations is most acute for the area closest to the site, where some impacts from \nthe IPC site (but not necessarily all) are likely to be the most significant. \n \n[TABLE 3 HERE] \n \nThese patterns can also be seen in Figure 1 which charts an indexed ratio for each buffer \ndistance.  The index is derived by setting the value for the least deprived ward decile at 1 in \neach case.  The relationship between IPC site location and the deprivation characteristics of \nwards near to IPC sites is again starkly clear, as is the close correlation between the 500m, \n1km and 2km profiles.   \n \nThe results from the \u2018counting people\u2019 in buffer method give no indication of those people who \nare living within 1km of two or more sites (i.e. where buffers overlap) and therefore whether or \nnot IPC sites are clustered in areas of higher levels of deprivation.  A further more involved \nanalysis was therefore carried out to examine the deprivation characteristics of people living \nwithin 1km of two or more sites. Contrasting the most and least deprived deciles, Table 4 \nshows that there are 159,031 people in the most deprived decile living near to 2 or more sites, \nand only 13,301 in the least deprived.  There are no people living near to 4 or more sites in \nthe least deprived decile, compared to 11,523 in the most deprived.  As the number of sites \n 10 \nwithin 1km rises the bias towards the more deprived deciles becomes more acute \u2013 as shown \nby the graduation of CI values rising from 0.31 to 0.59.  \n \n[TABLE 4 HERE] \n \nWithin the IPC regime, sites are categorised into one of six industry sectors \u2013 chemical, fuel \nand power, metal, mineral, waste and other.   Figure 2 shows the results of the 1km buffer \nanalysis differentiated by industry sector, using an index ratio standardises upon the lowest \ndecile in each sector (i.e. the lowest decile is given a value of 1).  This enables a comparison \nof the difference between the least deprived decile and other deciles sector by sector.  All of \nthe sectors show an inequality bias towards the more deprived deciles, although for the \nmineral sector this is significantly less marked, whilst the waste sector3 stands out as \nparticularly extreme (CI value of 0.45).  The proportion of the population in the most deprived \ndecile living within 1km of an IPC waste site is 43 times higher (113,768 people) than in the \nleast deprived decile (2,619 people).    \n  \n[FIGURE 2 HERE] \n \nOPRA pollution hazard appraisal (PHA) scores (see above)  for authorized processes were \nnext used to analyse the distribution of pollution hazard. Scores range from Band A, denoting \nlow hazard, to Band E,(High hazard). The majority of authorisations fall into PHA band C with \nvery few in the lowest hazard band A, and none in the highest band E (Figure 3).  The \ndominance of Band C authorisations makes differentiation difficult .  However, the higher \nhazard band C and D authorisations are more prevalent in the more deprived deciles in \nabsolute and relative terms. For example, there are 55 sites with the highest pollution hazard \nrating (Band D) in the most deprived 20% of wards, compared to only 4 in the 20% least \ndeprived. Band A and B authorisations have a more uniform social distribution.   The \ngraduation in CI values also demonstrates the more equal distribution of low hazard sites and \n                                                     \n3 IPC waste sites are mainly incinerators.  Landfills were not included within the IPC regime.  \n 11 \nthe bias towards more deprived deciles for high hazard sites.  There are therefore more IPC \nsites, and more high hazard IPC sites, in deprived wards compared to more affluent wards. \n \n[FIGURE 3 HERE] \n \nAn element of the PHA rating which is particularly relevant to the day to day experience of \nliving near an IPC site is the score given to \u2018offensive characteristics\u2019 that are likely to give \n\u2018local annoyance\u2019. This is measured over a range of 1 (least offensive)  to 5 (most offensive).  \nIn absolute terms there is again a far higher number of authorisations with offensive \ncharacteristics in the high deprivation bands than in the lower ones (Figure 4). For the worst \nscores on the offensiveness rating (4 and 5) there are 52 authorisations in wards in the most \ndeprived decile, compared to 9 in the least deprived decile.  In relative terms there is also a \nbias towards the more deprived deciles \u2013 the CI value for authorisations with a score of 5 is \n0.34 indicating a greater inequality than the value of 0.26 for all authorisations. \n \n[FIGURE 4 HERE] \n \nEvaluating the Evidence \n \nOur analysis provides evidence of a socially unequal distribution of IPC sites in England. \nThese significant sources of pollution are disproportionately located in more deprived areas - \nas measured both by a count of  sites in wards and through analysis of  the deprivation \ncharacteristics of populations living within a range of distances from each site. IPC sites are \nalso more clustered in deprived areas, with the proportion of people living within 1km of \nmultiple sites higher than in more affluent areas. On average, IPC sites in deprived areas \nhave more frequent emissions and present a greater potential pollution hazard, as indicated \nby the Environment Agency authorisation OPRA scores. IPC sites in deprived areas tend also \nto  produce more \u2018offensive\u2019 pollutants which are likely to have an impact on the day-to-day \nquality of life of local people.  Waste sites, in particular, stand out as being disproportionately \nlocated within deprived communities.  \n 12 \n Such evidence is initially compelling and suggests, as in other areas of policy in which striking \ninequalities exist such as for income or health, that there is a case for some form of public \nintervention. However, experience in the US and the methodological issues being \nemphasized in recent discussion (Mitchell and Walker 2005), indicate the need for caution in \nmoving too readily from empirical results to policy prescription.  Whilst the analysis we have \nundertaken provides a significant advance on the existing limited research base, it needs to \nbe evaluated in the light of the complexities involved in undertaking such distributional \nanalysis and in substantiating claims of injustice. These complexities can be most readily \napproached through a consideration of what the evidence is not able to show: \n \nImpact and harm \u2013 the analysis provides evidence of patterns of proximity, it does not show \npatterns of pollution impact and\/or demonstrable harm in terms of human health.  Whilst \nproximity, assessed by a circle drawn around a site grid reference, may be used as surrogate \nfor impact or harm it is a poor one across the range of types of installation included in the IPC \ncategory.  As Davidson (2003) emphasizes, the question of siting is distinct from the question \nof risk, as the risk of harm from any one polluting site is dependent on a wide range of \nvariables such as emission types and levels, patterns of dispersal and distribution and the \nexposure and response of particular people to the pollution.  A circular measure of proximity \ncannot represent this range of variables, which ideally would be evaluated through site by site \nrisk assessments. This would entail much uncertainty and the commitment of very substantial \nresources (Davidson 2003, Bullard 1994). However, for some impacts, such as visual impacts \nand \u2018place stigma\u2019, proximity may be considered a better quality surrogate.   \n \nCausation \u2013 whilst a pattern of unequal distribution has been identified this does not begin to \nexplain why the pattern of unequal distribution exists. It is possible to hypothesis as to \npotential contributory factors which might include: (i) the operation of housing and land \nmarkets over long time scales; (ii) land use planning policies which have agglomerated \nindustrial activities in areas with poorer environmental quality;  (iii) historic patterns of site \nlocation and associated housing for workers and (iv) deliberate targeting of deprived areas by \n 13 \ncompanies seeking to gain planning permission where local opposition is likely to be less \nsubstantial, influential and well organized.  Such processes of causation have been examined \nin US studies through historical and contextual approaches to understanding the development \nof inequity through detailed description of patterns of community and industrial evolution (e.g. \nPulido et al. (1996) and Hurley (1995); and also through longitudinal statistical analyses \ncomparing the social characteristics of nearby populations at the time when installations were \nfirst sited to those of the present day (e.g.  Anderton et al. 1994; Baden and Coursey 2002).  \nHowever, unpicking causative factors beyond the local level and establishing clear \ndiscriminatory intent in siting have in practice proved very difficult to achieve (Bowen 2002).  \n \nInjustice \u2013 the results of our analysis clearly show a pattern of inequality in the distribution of \nIPC sites, but this does not immediately imply a condition of inequity or injustice and the need \nfor policy intervention.  As Low and Gleeson (1998) emphasise both the quality of the \nenvironment and the justice of its distribution may be evaluated in different ways and there is \n\u201cno universal prescription of what is a fair distribution of environmental quality for any scale of \nanalysis\u201d.  Questions of fairness are ethical and political, rather than empirical and statistical, \nand may be judged on factors which are not just distributional but also include issues of \nprocedural equity and the availability and application of personal and\/or communal choice.  \nQuestions of vulnerability and need for protection also interact with issues of fairness where \nhealth concerns are predominant (given that the health impacts of environmental exposure \nmay be modified by socio-economic status; Jerrett et al 2004). Table 5 lists a number of \npossible grounds on which a judgement of injustice in the location of IPC sites and need for \npolicy intervention could be made, emphasising the different factors and perspectives \npotentially involved. Each of these also implies the need for different types of evidence and \nanalysis to inform the judgements that are made, and involve different degrees of concern for \nquestions of causation.   \n \nAs noted by Low and Gleeson scale is also important. Spatial distributions are always \nevaluated at a particular scale, in our case for England as a whole.  However, different results \nmay have been obtained, and different judgements of fairness made, if we had worked at a \n 14 \nregional or city level, evaluating the distribution of a subset of IPC sites across a subset of \nspace and population. The influence of spatial choices was emphasised in our work by the \nfact that we were forced to carry out an analysis separately for Wales because of the different \nstructure of the IMD for Wales (Walker et al 2003).  This showed much weaker relationships \nwith deprivation for IPC site location than for England (and in some cases inverse patterns) \nwhich would have been masked if an analysis combining English and Welsh data, as \noriginally intended, had been possible.   \n \n[TABLE 5 HERE] \n \nConclusion \n \nThe term environmental justice provides a useful \u2018vocabulary for political opportunity\u2019 \n(Agyeman and Evans 2004) providing a means to highlight questions of distribution and \nprocedural fairness across a wide range of environmental policy domains (Stephens et al \n2001, Lucas et al 2004). In the UK, the discourse of environmental justice is beginning to take \nshape and is in many ways distinct from the US experience in terms of its driving forces, \nbreadth and focus.  However, there are still opportunities to learn from the process of \nreflection and re-evaluation that has recently featured in the US literature and the \ncomplexities of methodology, research-policy relationships and policy responses that have \nemerged (Foreman 1998).  \n \nThe analysis of IPC site locations in relation to patterns of social deprivation that we have \noutlined in this paper, incorporates significant methodological advances on previous UK \nresearch and has sought to avoid some of the weaknesses identified in earlier US studies. \nThe results do show distinct patterns of inequality in the distribution of IPC sites when \nanalysed across England as whole and provide empirical confirmation of assumptions that \nhave in the past been too easily made about the social gradient of industrial pollution (Beck \n1995). We have emphasized though, the need to be clear about what the research does not \nshow, particularly in terms of patterns of impact, exposure and risk, processes of causation \n 15 \nand claims of injustice.  There are also specific methodological issues which we have not had \nthe space to discuss in this paper regarding the coverage and accuracy of the IPC database, \nthe choice of wards as the spatial unit and the ecological fallacy of assuming that all people \nwithin a ward are equally deprived (see Mitchell and Walker 2005).    \n \nIn this light, we would argue that empirical research of this form, at a national scale and \nexamining broad relationships between environmental and social variables, whilst having an \nimportant role in the development of the environmental justice field, can only be a starting \npoint in the process of opening up relevant issues, questions and policy debates. Whilst \nmethodological development, as well as the carrying out of studies for different environmental \nand social variables at different scales (regional, local and international) is needed, the policy \ncommunity more fundamentally needs to begin to grapple with some of the difficult \nimplications that arise when issues of social justice are brought to bear on previously socially-\nblind (or agnostic) regulatory traditions.  From our experience of discussing the results of the \nproject with those involved in the management of industrial pollution, both within and outside \nof the Environment Agency, it is clear that justice and equity are not easily assimilated into \ncurrent policy and practice but have difficult, transgressive qualities.  Boundaries of \nresponsibility and remit are challenged and principles of regulation, such as the \u2018level playing \nfield\u2019 treatment of all companies in the same way regardless of location, are potentially \nundermined (Holifield 2004). Whilst we cannot give sufficient attention here to the wide range \nof policy implications involved,  it is clear that environmental justice cannot be treated simply \nas a \u2018technical issue\u2019, amenable to empirical analysis and technocratic resolution (Foreman \n2003). Ethical and political judgments have to be made to, for example, resolve what a \n\u2018disproportionate impact\u2019 might be and how both the national regulatory or land use planning \nsystem and the communities experiencing that impact might wish it to be responded to. For \nas Dobson (1998) and Low and Gleeson (1998) and many others have made clear, polluting \nindustrial sites can never be \u2018equally\u2019 distributed (whatever that might mean) and in this light \nthe pursuit of greater environmental equity or justice must always be partial, relative and \nbrought to bear not on sharing pollution out, but reducing its production at source.   \n  \n 16 \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe research reported in this paper was funded by the Environment Agency for England and \nWales.
