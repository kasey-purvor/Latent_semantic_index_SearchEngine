Stemme2\n1Nanotechnology centre, Department of Materials, Cranfield University, Cranfield,\nBedfordshire, MK43 0AL England\n2Microsystem Technology Lab, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of\nTechnology, SE-100 44 Stockholm, Sweden\nAbstract\nA key issue for the design and reliability of micro devices is process related, residual stresses\nin the thin films from which they are composed, especially for sol-gel deposited Pb(Zrx,Ti1-\nx)O3 ceramics, where use of Pt as a template layer, though essential for the nucleation of the\nperovskite phase, results in structures with levels of stress high and largely fixed by the\nthermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Pt and Si. Here a technique for the\nelimination of this stress is presented, involving the use of adhesive wafer bonding and bulk\nmicromachining procedures to remove the Pt layer following the Pb(Zrx,Ti1-x)O3 deposition.\nInterest in Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT), as a functional material for Micro Electro\nMechanical Systems (MEMS) applications has grown significantly in the past few years. PZT\nceramics in thin film form have already been incorporated into various MEMS devices for\nsensing or actuating purposes, in particular those demanding exceptionally high linearity in\nresponse and\/or high actuation forces. However, the high levels of thin film stress\nincorporated in these structures are a serious problem, as they increase both the likelihood of\nearly device failure and the risk of unwanted deformation of the device after release. The only\napproach to combating these effects available so far, has been stress balancing in which the\nindividual layer stresses and thicknesses are adjusted, so that the null bending moment\ncondition for the equilibrium of the released structure gives zero deformation 1. This has been\npractically realized in a number of ways, at either device or wafer level, such as Ar\nbombardment of the completed device 2 or inclusion of stress compensating layers 3, where\nthe respective adjustments are made by varying ion dose or film thickness- with all such\ntechniques the overall level of thin film stress of course is little changed. In an investigation\ninto the stress in our microstructures using the wafer curvature technique it has been found, in\ncommon with other workers 2, 4, 5, that the stress is largely the result of the thermal mismatch\nbetween the Si substrate and the various device layers and so cannot be reduced by\nconventional means but it is also predominantly localized to the layers beneath the PZT. This\nhas led to the proposal of a technique for the elimination of this stress by the removal of the\nhigh stressed under layers following the PZT deposition step.\nGood quality PZT thin films of uniform thickness can be prepared at relatively low\ntemperatures (~530 oC\u2013 600oC) using the sol-gel deposition method, provided only that there\nis a Pt or other template layer underneath to promote crystallization of the perovskite phase 6.\nIf Pt is used, a barrier layer is also needed, since Pt is not stable in contact with Si at high\ntemperatures and a thermally grown SiO2 layer is commonly used for this, especially when\nelectrical contact between Pt and Si is not desired. Use of Pt as the template layer for PZT\nnucleation gives rise to high mechanical stress in the stack which is mainly attributable to the\nlarge mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between Pt and Si.\nThe wafer curvature technique has been used to investigate the stress in our\nPZT\/Pt\/SiO2 transducer structures. For these trials the PZT stack was fabricated on top of a\n425 \u03bcm thick, 4\u201d Si wafer, coated with a 0.2 \u03bcm thick thermal oxide. The first step was the\nroom temperature RF magnetron sputtering of a 100 nm thick Pt template layer with\nunderlying 8nm Ti adhesion layer. This was followed by deposition of ten layers of\nPb(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O3 by a sol-gel method, which gave a total PZT film thickness of 1 \u03bcm. X-ray\ndiffraction confirmed that the PZT film was well crystallized with the expected (111)\norientation. Finally a 100 nm thick Au layer with thin (8nm) Ti adhesion layer was RF\nmagnetron sputtered for the top electrode. The contribution of the individual layers to the\noverall stress was calculated from the modified Stoney equation 7 in which the stress in a\nparticular layer, \u03c3f, is given by:\n\uf028 \uf029 f\ns\ns\ns\nf t\nt\nRR\nE 2\n0\n11\n16 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf06e\n\uf073 (1)\nWhere Es, \u03bds are the elastic modulus and the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the substrate, ts and tf are the\nsubstrate and film thickness respectively and R0 and R are the substrate radii of curvature\nwithout (R0) and with (R) the particular layer present, as measured using a DEKTAK surface\nprofiler.\nAs PZT crystallization is a high temperature process (530 oC- 600 oC) alterations in\nTi\/Pt residual stress have been reported 4, 8-11 due to interactions between the adjacent films\nand\/or annealing out of the as-deposited stress. Process induced changes were investigated by\ncomparing the stresses in the layers as measured during the building of the PZT stack with\nthose measured for the same layers during their sequential removal. A series of wet etches\nwere used for the stripping process.\nIn the table of results presented in Table I it can be seen that, as deposited, the Au has\na high compressive stress which is very close to the value measured on etch back. This would\nbe expected since the wafer did not undergo any high temperature processing between the\ntwo steps. In contrast, it appears that the stress in both the PZT and Pt have changed\nsignificantly during processing. However, looking more closely at the PZT stress data a high\nvalue close to that shown in column 1 was only measured for the first layer of PZT, all\nsubsequent layers had values similar to that in the second column. It is clear, therefore, that\nonly the residual stress in the Ti\/Pt bottom electrode had changed during PZT crystallization.\nThis change, from compressive to tensile, is mainly attributed to the annealing out of the\noriginal compressive stress and the subsequent introduction of a purely thermal stress due to\nthe large thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Pt and the Si substrate. The\nthermal stress which arises in the Pt film during PZT crystallization, ignoring other\ninteractions and assuming bulk values for the film properties, is given by 4:\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0f2 \uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n0\n1\nT\nT sf\nf\nf\nth\ncrysr\ndT\nE\n\uf061\uf061\n\uf06e\n\uf073 (2)\nWhere Ef=170 GPa and \u03bdf=0.39 are the elastic modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of bulk Pt and\n\u03b1f=9x10-6 deg-1, \u03b1s=2.5x10-6 deg-1 are the thermal expansion coefficients of bulk Pt and bulk\nSi respectively. For T0=30 oC, Tcryst=530 oC, Eq.2 gives a thermal stress equal to 0.91 GPa,\nclose to the value of 0.877 GPa obtained experimentally and consistent with previous works 3,\n4 .\nThere are other changes that take place during processing, such as Ti diffusion into\nthe Pt as well as formation of TiO2 12-14 which since the Ti layer is extremely thin have been\nassumed to have little effect on the calculated stress. Other values to be noted in Table I are\nthe low tensile stress in the PZT and the relatively high compressive stress in the SiO2.\nThe identification of a largely fixed stress in the PZT stack localized in the Pt and (to\na lesser extent) SiO2 layers below the PZT, has led to the proposal of a technique, for the\nelimination of this stress by the complete removal of the under layers. The idea is to attach\nthe wafer by its top face to a second wafer and to remove the initial substrate and the highly\nstressed films using dry etching techniques. At this point processing of the device structure\ncan be resumed using low stress bottom electrode and structural layers.\nThe feasibility of this technique was investigated using 4\u201d wafers containing the same\nAu\/PZT\/Pt\/SiO2 layer structure as described earlier. The main steps in the process are\nillustrated in Figure 1. The attachment of the two wafers was carried out using a recently\ndeveloped transfer bonding technique 15 the key features of which are: the relatively low\nbonding temperature, the ability to bond any kind of wafer material, the high tolerance to 3D\nsurface topographies and the wide range of polymers that can be used for the adhesive layer,\nincluding benzocyclobutene (BCB) 16 and photoresists such as SU8 and the mr-I 9000 nano-\nimprint series resist from Microresist Technology GmBH 17 used in the current work. The\nadhesive was spun onto the wafer (Figure 1(b)) and also onto a second wafer Figure 1(c) with\nspin speed adjusted to give a nominal thickness of 2.5 \uf06dm. Then, using a Karl Suss SB6\nsubstrate bonding tool, the wafers were bonded together (Figure 1(d)) at a chuck pressure of 4\nbar and a curing temperature of 200\uf0b0C for 50 minutes 17.\nFigure 1 (a) Ferroelectric stack (b, c) Coating of adhesive on both wafers (d) Adhesive wafer bonding\n(e) removal of Si, SiO2 and Pt layers.\nFigure 2 The Pt base layer revealed after Si substrate and SiO2 layer removal. The black markings at\nthe edges are areas of Si remaining under the supporting fingers needed to clamp the wafer, during the\nDRIE process.\nThe SiO2 and Pt films were then removed using plasma etching to expose the back\nsurface of the PZT: Figure 2 shows the Pt surface, exposed after the removal of the SiO2 layer\nand Figure 3 the PZT surface after Pt etch.\nFigure 3 Full view of the base of the back etched PZT supported by the backing wafer.\nThe effects on the stress in the remaining layers caused by the removal of the silicon\nsubstrate were measured by the wafer curvature technique and the results are presented in the\nlast column of Table I. Once the Pt is released from the substrate the Pt layer is under a low\ncompressive stress while the PZT is again under tensile stress, though less than in the initial\nstack. This can be explained by assuming that removal of the Si eliminates the force\nconstraining the Pt, dictated by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients (Eq 2), so\nallowing the Pt film to relax. As expected the stress in the Au top electrode is unaltered.\nIn order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Pt layer removal technique in\nlowering stress and hence distortion in piezoelectric microstructures a comparison has been\nmade of the tip deflections to be expected from two micromachined cantilevers, one\ncomposed of the above Au\/PZT\/Pt\/SiO2\/Si structure and the other with the Pt, SiO2 and Si\nlayers removed and replaced by low stress Au and SiNx for the bottom electrode and\nstructural layers, respectively, giving a Au\/PZT\/Au\/SiNx structure. The stress values used for\nthe Au, PZT, Pt and SiO2 were those which had been measured on the real structure during\netch back i.e. those given in column 4 of Table I. The SiNx was assumed to have negligible\nstress with Young\u2019s modulus E=290 GPa and was given the same thickness (10\u00b5m) as the Si\nstructural layer: a 10\u00b5m beam width was assumed in both cases. The analysis generally\nfollowed the treatment by Pulskamp et al.1 which was based on the well known Bernoulli-\nEuler beam bending equation:\n\uf028 \uf029\nEI\nxM\ndx\ndw\ndx\nwd\n\uf03d\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n1\n(3)\nIn Eq. (3), w is the vertical deflection as a function of the distance along the beam, x; M(x) is\nthe total bending moment due to the residual stresses in the films comprising the beam and E\nand I are the composite Young\u2019s modulus and moment of inertia with respect to the beam\u2019s\nwidth, respectively. In both cases the elastic properties of the films were assumed to be\nconstant and equal to their bulk values while stress gradients in the films were assumed\nnegligible. The equation was solved numerically using a Runge-Kutta method of fourth order\naccuracy.\nFigure 4 Static tip deflection of a cantilever beam as a function of the beam\u2019s length. Red curves\ncorrespond to a beam fabricated from a pzt stack on top of a 10 \u00b5m thick Si substrate. Blue curves\ncorrespond to a beam fabricated from a back etched stack using a SiNx low stressed 10 \u00b5m thick film\nas the structural layer (SL) and a sputtered Ti\/Au film as the top electrode (TE).\nThe resulting beam tip deflections as a function of beam length are given in Figure 4 which\nalso shows for comparison the result to be expected in the limit of small displacements. In\nthis latter case it is assumed that (dw\/dx)2 is small compared to 1 in Eq (3) and so can be\nignored thus rendering the equation amenable to analytical solution. It can be seen that the\nassumption of small displacements is not valid for the full range of beam lengths investigated\nin the present work but both approximate solutions show clearly the great reduction in beam\ndeformation achievable by replacement of the high stress layers.\nThis demonstrated ability to remove the Pt and SiO2 base layers in a PZT stack\nfollowing PZT deposition is a significant milestone towards achieving truly low stress\/low\ndeformation piezoelectric microstructures. Work is currently underway in applying this\nprocessing concept to the fabrication of piezoelectrically actuated RF MEMS switches.\nThis work is part of the Q2M project and receives research funding from the European Commission,\nthrough the sixth framework program.
