This \u2018intelligence\u2019 problem may be distinguished from the \u2018evidence\u20194\nproblem where we need to evaluate the grounds for believing that some soil material is5\nderived from one site rather than another. There is interest in the use of soil databases6\nto solve intelligence problems. This paper proposes a geostatistical method to tackle the7\nintelligence problem. Given data on a sample of unknown provenance, and a database8\nwith the same information from known sites, it is possible to define a likelihood function,9\nthe argument of which is location in space, which is the likelihood that the sample is10\nfrom that location. In this paper we show how an approximation to this likelihood can11\nbe computed, using a principal component transformation of the data and disjunctive12\nkriging.13\nThe proposed likelihood function is tested using a geochemical database on the soil14\nof the Humber Trent region of north-east England. This shows that the function is a15\nuseful way to make a statistical prediction of the provenance of a soil sample. The region16\ncan be stratified according to the value of the likelihood function. A validation data set17\nshowed that if we defined a stratum with the top 4.5% of values of the likelihood function,18\nthen there was a 50% probablity that it included the true provenance of the sample, and19\nthere is a 90% probability of finding the true provenance of the sample in a stratum with20\nthe top 30% of values of the likelihood function. Note also that the spatial likelihood21\nfunction could be integrated with other sources of information on the likely provenance22\nof the sample by means of Bayes law.23\nWe conclude that this approach has value for forensic problems. The main difficulty24\nis how to define the geostatistical support of the forensic specimen, and the reliability25\nof analytical data on relatively small forensic samples, but this is a generic problem for26\nforensic geoscience.27\n2\nIntroduction28\n\u2018You have come up from the south-west, I see.\u201929\n\u2018Yes, from Horsham.\u201930\n\u2018That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinc-31\ntive\u2019.32\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Five Orange Pips.33\nSince most of the earth\u2019s surface is covered by soil it is not surprising that there is a34\nlong-standing interest in the use of soil evidence for forensic purposes (Pye, 2007). In this35\npaper we consider the case when soil has been found on a vehicle, a tool or some other36\nexhibit, and the aim of the forensic investigator is to identify the likely provenance of this37\nsoil, or to exclude potential provenance regions from an investigation. Since the soil is38\nvery variable at all spatial scales neither the matching of a specimen to a provenance, nor39\nthe exclusion of possible provenances, which forensic scientists often wish to achieve, can40\nusually be absolute. For this reason we set the task of inferring forensic intelligence from41\nsoil data in a statistical framework. This may be problematic for presenting evidence42\nin court, but may be useful for forensic intelligence (i.e. as a guide to police during an43\ninvestigation).44\nForensic scientists have to make inferences of this kind for real problems. For ex-45\nample, in 2000 three people were reported missing in South Australia. Their vehicle was46\nlater recovered; a shovel was in the boot with a lot of soil on it. Examination of the soil,47\nits chemical properties, lithology, mineralogy and organic status, allowed soil scientists to48\nnarrow down its likely provenance, and this led directly to the discovery of the remains49\nof the missing persons in a quarry (CAFSS, 2006).50\nThe problem of how best to determine the provenance of soil material for forensic51\npurposes is a matter of considerable interest. For example, Rawlins et al. (2006) conducted52\na study in which four experts used different technologies (X-ray diffraction, scanning53\n3\nelectron microscopy, palynology and molecular characterization of organic matter) to54\nexamine soil specimens from different settings and identify their likely provenance. Two55\nsites, with distinctive vegetation and parent material, were easily characterized, but a56\nthird was not.57\nAn alternative approach would be to compare forensic specimens with existing soil58\ndatabases. In the UK, and in many European countries, there are substantial databases59\non the soil which have been collected to characterize soil resources, and as a baseline60\nto monitor their quality (e.g. McGrath & Loveland, 1992). This raises the question of61\nwhether a comparison of soil material from a forensic exhibit with soil in such a database62\nwould allow the provenance of the forensic specimen to be narrowed down to a useful63\ndegree. Soil scientists have made substantial use of such databases to undertake classical64\ngeostatistical inference about the soil (spatial prediction). In such inference we start65\nwith a body of data on the soil at known discrete sample points, and proceed to predict66\nsoil properties at unsampled points. Locations are given at which the values of the soil67\nproperties are unknown. If these unsampled points consitute a grid, then the predictions68\ncan be used to produce an isarithmic map of soil properties (Burgess & Webster, 1980).69\nIn addition we can make other inferences at unsampled sites, we might compute the70\nprobability, conditional on our data, that the true value of a variable at some site exceeds71\na regulatory threshold. This can be done by disjunctive kriging (Matheron, 1976).72\nThe inference for forensic intelligence is rather different. Again, we have the database,73\non which our inference will be conditioned, but this time we know the values of key soil74\nvariables from a specimen of unknown provenance. What we want to do is to predict75\nthat provenance, or alternatively, to exclude sites of potential provenance, as a guide to76\ninvestigators. We use \u2018prediction\u2019 in this paper in a statistical sense. A prediction of an77\nunknown variable is value that is inferred, conditional on some data and some statistical78\nmodel, that is \u2018best\u2019 by some appropriate criterion. Such a prediction has an attendant79\nuncertainty, which may be quantified, and should not be treated as an unconditional80\n4\nstatement of fact. It is our contention in this paper that a geostatistical inference of the81\nprovenance of a soil sample, conditional on a spatial database, is possible via a spatial82\nlikelihood function. We present this likelihood function, and suggest how it might be83\napproximated in practice. We then use an existing geochemical database on the soil to84\nillustrate how the spatial likelihood function might be applied.85\nTheory86\nThe concept of a spatial likelihood function.87\nLet S be a random variate (e.g. a set of geochemical soil properties), let s (X) be a set of88\nobservations of this variate at locations in X, let x0 be some unsampled location and let89\n\u03c6 be a vector of (cross) covariance parameters for S. These parameters may be estimated90\nfrom the data s (X).91\nThe conditional probability density function (pdf) for S at x0 is92\nP {S |s (X) ,x0,\u03c6} . (1)\nNow, if we consider an observed variate, of unknown provenance, s\u2032 we could evaluate93\nthe probability density at any x0 given the data and covariance model. If we think of94\nthis conditional probability density as a function of location, conditional on a particular95\nobservation, it is a likelihood function:96\nL{x0|s (X) , s\u2032,\u03c6} = P {s\u2032 |s (X) ,x0,\u03c6} . (2)\nIf we evaluated this likelihood function over a grid of locations it could be used to make97\ninferences about the provenance of the soil sample. For example, a prediction of its98\nprovenance might be the location where the likelihood is largest. Alternatively, we might99\nintegrate the spatial likelihood function with a spatial prior probability density function100\nfor the provenance of the sample (which might reflect other evidence which is available)101\nand then renormalize the result to obtain a spatial posterior probability density function.102\nAgain, while a prediction of the provenance could be obtained as the site where the103\n5\nposterior probability density is largest, a map of the posterior probability density will104\nbe of most value for intelligence purposes, indicating those regions where searches or105\nother investigations should be focussed. However, the evaluation of the spatial likelihood106\nfunction is not a trivial task, and we now consider how it could be done in practice.107\nDistributional assumptions.108\nIn geostatistical prediction we do not generally evaluate the full conditional pdf at some109\nlocation x0. Rather we estimate the best linear unbiased predictor, which is the mean110\nof the conditional pdf if the spatial (cross) covariance is known correctly. In the simple111\ncokriging case (where the expectation of S is assumed to be known and constant, the112\ncross-covariances of the kriging estimates are the covariance matrix of the conditional113\npdf, so, subject to assumptions of normality, the conditional pdf could be specified.114\nIn practice we do not proceed in this way when conditional probabilities for a random115\nvariable are required at unsampled locations, since our conclusions will be sensitive to the116\ndistributional assumption which is often not plausible. This is why the methods of non-117\nlinear geostatistics have been developed (Rivoirard, 1994). These entail simple kriging118\nprediction of non-linear transforms of the data, such as the indicator transform (indicator119\nkriging) or a Hermite transform (disjunctive kriging). We now consider the latter in more120\ndetail.121\nDisjunctive kriging (DK) entails the assumption that our data are a realization of a122\nprocess with a second-order stationary bivariate distribution. The assumption of second-123\norder stationarity means that the covariance function exists and that the variogram is124\ntherefore bounded. It is also assumed that the data are from a Gaussian random process.125\nSince data may often not resemble a Gaussian random variable the first step in DK is126\nto transform the data with Hermite polynomials, which Rivoirard (1994) describes in127\nmore detail. The Hermite coefficients are then kriged to target locations of interest. A128\nprediction of the original soil variable, S\u02dc(x), is obtained from these and the conditional129\nprobability that S(x) occurs in specified intervals. Here we assume that the range of130\n6\na variable is divided into bins, and denote by \u03c8k (x0) the probability that S(x0) is in131\nthe kth bin. Note that if we develop this approach, we obtain not a probability density132\nfunction, but rather probabilities for discrete intervals of the variables. This is one sense133\nin which the proposal developed in this paper provides us with an approximation to a134\nspatial likelihood function.135\nThe problem of many variables.136\nWe have described disjunctive kriging above with respect to predicting a single variable,137\nbut in a forensic context we will probably want to evaluate a spatial likelihood function138\nthat is based on a random variate which represents several soil properties. Disjunctive139\ncokriging is possible (e.g. Finke & Stein, 1994). However, all cokriging requires that we140\ncan model the spatial covariation of a variate in terms of an admissible model such as141\nthe linear model of coregionalization, LMCR (Journel & Huijbregts, 1978). While the142\nLMCR can be fitted automatically (Lark & Papritz, 2003) which means that it is feasible143\nto fit it for variates with many dimensions, it does impose strong assumptions of linearity,144\nand as a result the fitted covariance matrices for the nested components of the model145\n(coregionalization matrices) may often be positive semi-definite only, which represents146\nthe best admissible solution, but clearly implies some \u2018strain\u2019 in the fit of the model147\n(since it implies that some of the variates are perfectly correlated). We would therefore148\nprefer to avoid cokriging techniques that require these constraints.149\nA proposal.150\nWe therefore propose the following approach.151\nFirst, we transform our m-variate data set, s (X) , = {s(x1), s(x2), . . .}, to its m152\nprincipal components, which we denote by a (X) , = {a(x1), a(x2), . . .}. We propose that153\nthe principal components analysis (PCA) is based on the sample correlation matrix of154\ns (X) so that the transform is independent of the units in which the original variables are155\nexpressed. Any new vector, s\u2032 (x0) can then be transformed to a\u2032 (x0), a projection of the156\nvector onto the same rotation of the original variables computed from the correlation ma-157\n7\ntrix of the data s (X). The principal components are uncorrelated, and so we will assume158\nthat they are a realization of m mutually independent random variables, A1, A2, . . . , Am.159\nBy reference to the eigenvalues from the PCA we can identify how many of the principal160\ncomponents are needed to represent some adequate proportion of the variation of s (X),161\nwe assume that m\u2032 \u2264 m are selected.162\nThe next step is to undertake DK estimation of them\u2032 selected principal components163\nat a set of target sites. We divide the range of values of each component into intervals, so164\nby DK we can estimate for any unsampled site, x0, a set of probabilities: \u03c8i,k (x0) , i =165\n1, 2, . . . ,m\u2032; k = 1, 2, . . . , Ki, where \u03c8i,k (x0) denotes the probability that Ai (x0) is in166\nthe kth inteval for the ith principal component out of Ki such intervals. Note that167\nthe intervals are non-overlapping and cover the full range of values so that, for any i,168 \u2211Ki\nk=1 \u03c8i,k (x0) = 1.169\nWe now consider a sampled variate, s\u2032 of unknown provenance. First, we transform170\nit to a vector in the principal component space, a\u2032. For each of the m\u2032 principal com-171\nponents we can then identify the interval in which the corresponding variable in a\u2032 falls,172\nwe denote this interval by the index k\u02c6. On the assumption that the random variables,173\nA1, A2, . . . , Am\u2032 are mutually independent, the approximate spatial likelihood function174\nat x0 for observed variate s\n\u2032 is then computed as:175\nL\u02d8 (x0|s\u2032) =\nm\u2032\u220f\ni=1\n\u03c8i,k\u02c6 (x0) , (3)\nwhere the dependence of this likelihood on the data, on the covariance models used to176\ncompute the DK estimates and on the selected principal components is implicit.177\nCase Study.178\nIn the case study we used soil geochemical data from the G-BASE project from179\nacross the Humber-Trent region of north-east England. These data were collected and180\nare maintained by the British Geological Survey, and a large proportion of these data have181\nbeen described in detail elsewhere (Rawlins et al., 2003). In a previous study Rawlins &182\n8\nCave (2004) used them to study geochemical variability of soils, and their implications183\nfor forensic problems. In summary, the data were obtained by a non-aligned sampling184\nscheme. The strata were 2-km squares of the Ordnance Survey grid. Every second square185\nwas sampled at a random location. This gave 6411 sites in total. At each site five soil186\ncores were collected from the centre and corners of a 20-m square; they were then bulked.187\nThe cores were 15 cm long and excluded surface litter. The bulked material was air-dried188\nthen seived and a 50-g subsample was ground. The total concentrations of 24 major189\nand trace elements were determined in each sub-sample by wavelength dispersive XRFS190\n(X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry).191\nRawlins & Cave (2004) concluded that, of the 24 elements determined on these192\nsub-samples, 6 were not suitable for further analysis since many of the observations were193\nbelow the detection limit of the XRFS system. We followed them in using the following194\n18 determinations for our analysis, with major elements expressed as weight percent of195\ntheir oxide: As, Ba, CaO, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe2O3, MgO, MnO, Mo, Pb, Rb, Sr, TiO2, U, V,196\nZr.197\nWe removed 1000 observations from the data set by simple random sampling. These198\nwere for later use as a validation subset. We then computed a principal components199\nanalysis of the correlation matrix of the remaining prediction data. Figure 1 shows a plot200\nof the accumulated eigenvalues. We selected the first 7 principal components for further201\nanalysis, these account for 80% of the variation of the full data set between them.202\nWe then found a Hermite transformation of each of the principal components to203\na new normal variable, as described by Webster & Oliver (2007). We then computed204\nempirical variograms of the new transformed variables and fitted models to them. Figure 2205\nshows the variogram and fitted model for the transformed values of the first principal206\ncomponent. Note that the sill variance for the transformed variable should be 1.0. In207\nthis case the sill of the fitted model is slightly larger than this (1.04). The variogram is208\nautomatically rescaled to a sill of 1 by the disjunctive kriging program.209\n9\nWe then used disjunctive kriging to predict at the nodes of a square grid (interval210\n1 km), and for each of our seven principal components, the conditional probability that211\nthe value of the principal component falls in each of 20 intervals. These intervals were212\ndefined by the 20-percentiles of the prediction data for each principal component. The213\ncode that we used was based on that of Yates et al. (1986).214\nWe then considered each of the 1000 validation data in turn. For each sample site215\nwe transformed its values for the 18 elements to the principal component scores of the216\nPCA carried out on the prediction data set (i.e. we used the statistics of the prediction217\ndata, and the eigenvectors of their correlation matrix). We then approximated the spatial218\nlikelihood function for the sample at each node of the 1-km grid on which DK predictions219\nwere obtained. For each of the 7 principal components we identified the interval (out220\nof 20) to which our validation sample corresponded. We then extracted the conditional221\nprobability for each of these seven intervals, and then computed the approximate spatial222\nlikelihood using Equation (??).223\nFigure 3a shows the spatial likelihood function for one of the validation sample224\npoints. It also shows the actual location of this point, note that here the true location225\nof the point coincides with the maximum of the spatial likelihood function. However,226\nFigure 3b shows another case where the true value did not coincide with a marked peak227\nin the spatial likelihood function. To give an overall evaluation of the predictions by the228\nlikelihood function we proceeded as follows. First, for each validation observation we eval-229\nuated the spatial likelihood function at each of the 1-km grid nodes. We then identified230\nthe node which was closest to the actual location of the validation observation, and iden-231\ntified that quantile of the set of likelihoods, qo to which the nearest node corresponded.232\nWe then computed the complement of this quantile (cq = 1 \u2212 qo), this will be zero if233\nthe nearest node is the one of maximum likelihood. We obtained cq for each validation234\nobservation, and then plotted the empirical cumulative distribution function of this vari-235\nable for the whole validation set. These numbers may be interpreted as estimates, from236\n10\nthe random validation sample, of the probability of including the grid node nearest to237\nthe true provenance of a sample within a subset of nodes. This subset, which constitutes238\nproportion cq of the full set, is designated as likely to contain the sample because the239\nnodes have the largest values of the spatial likelihood function. The CDF of cq is plotted,240\nwith axis labels reflecting this interpretation, in Figure 4. The solid line shows this plot241\nfor spatial likelihoods computed with 7 principal components, and the dotted line shows242\nthe effect of reducing this to the first three principal components. The dashed line is the243\nbisector, the expected form of this plot if the spatial likelihood is only randomly related244\nto the true location of the observation.245\nThe plots show that the probability of including a site in a region designated from246\nthe spatial likelihood is always substantially larger than would be expected if the spatial247\nlikelihood were only randomly related to the provenance of a sample. In fact, when 7248\nprincipal components were used to determine the spatial likelihood, then if we select the249\ntop 4.5% of nodes on spatial likelihood then there is a probability of 0.5 that one of250\nthese is the nearest node to the true provenance of the sample. This proportion has to251\nbe increased to 10.9% if we only use the first three principal components. To have a252\nprobability of 0.9 that the node nearest to the true sample is included, the designated253\narea must be 30% when we use all 7 principal components.254\nDiscussion and Conclusions.255\nThe case study shows that the approximate spatial likelihood has considerable po-256\ntential for predicting the likely provenance of a soil sample by comparison to observations257\nin a spatial database. It should be noted that the likelihood function may only be part258\nof the process of inferring the provenance of soil material. Other evidence might provide259\nus with a prior spatial probability density function. This function might, for example,260\nexclude the possibility that the soil material came from locations further than some max-261\nimum distance from where the soil-covered exhibit was found. Integration of this prior262\n11\nprobability function with the likelihood function, and renormalization, would then pro-263\nduce a posterior probability density function which reflects how the prior distribution is264\nrationally modified by the soil evidence expressed in the spatial likelihood function.265\nThe case study also raises some practical issues. It is clear that there is substantial266\nloss of information when we use just three principal components rather than 7. However,267\nthere are 18 components in total, and the plot of accumulated eigenvalues (Figure 1)268\nshows that the variability explained by components increases more or less smoothly as269\nthe number of components is increased. It is therefore quite possible that using more270\nthan 7 principal components would give still better results. However, the process of271\ncomputing Hermite transformations and modelling the variogram of many components is272\ntedious, and is not readilly automated. Alternatively we might use indicator kriging to273\ncompute the conditional probabilities. This makes the transformation step quicker and274\neasier; and although in theory DK retains more information, in practice little difference275\nhas been found between the estimated conditional probabilities by the two methods (Lark276\n& Ferguson, 2004).277\nTwo further issues require careful consideration. First, in our case study all data,278\nboth those used to estimate the spatial likelihoods (representing a database), and those for279\nwhich a prediction of provenance was obtained (representing forensic specimens), had been280\ncollected on the same spatial support. The support is the particular volume, shape and281\norientation of the soil sample; in this case a set of five cores from the centre and vertices of282\na square, sampled to 15 cm depth. In practice a soil database is likely to contain data with283\na support similar to this, but the support of the forensic specimen is essentially unknown,284\nsince it is collected by a suspect walking over bare soil, or transferred, for example, to285\nthe wheel-arches of a vehicle from the vehicle\u2019s tyres. We distinguish, here, between286\nthe problem of unknown support and the problem of soil accumulation and mixing on287\nan exhibit before, during and after a crime, although the latter is certainly important.288\nEven if we could be confident that a soil specimen is from a single site the problem of289\n12\nsupport remains. Is it soil accumulated on the specimen while walking across the site,290\nor is it a single clod? This problem of the unknown support of soil material on forensic291\nexhibits is of more general importance to forensic science, and Rawlins & Cave (2004)292\ndrew attention to it. In the geostatistical context it means that the probabilistic model293\nbased on soil data from a standard support will not strictly apply to the forensic data of294\nunknown support, and since the variability of measurements will decrease as the volume295\nof the support increases, the uncertainty attached to our statements about the forensic296\nmaterial is likely to be an underestimate. Further work is needed on the implications of297\nthis, and on how we might tackle the problem. It might be possible to supplement a soil298\ndatabase with material collected on smaller supports, to provide a variance model that299\ncan then be regularized (Journel & Huijbregts, 1978) to represent variability on a larger300\nsupport as deemed appropriate.301\nFurther, there is another potential limitation to practical implementation of the302\napproach described in the case study. The quantity of soil retrieved from forensic items303\nis typically very small; often less than 1 g. Significantly larger quantities of soil (ca. 12 g)304\nare required for accurate, laboratory-based XRFS analyses reported in the case study. So305\nin many real investigations it may not be possible to compare the geochemistry of the306\nforensic sample to the database using the same analytical method. An alternative is to307\ndissolve the sample in strong acid and analyse the resulting solution composition by ICP-308\nMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry); see Jarvis et al. (2004), but also309\nnote their reservations about ICP-MS when only small samples are available, and those of310\nBull et al. (in press). However, with the exception of the recent Tellus geochemical survey311\nof northern Ireland (Tellus, 2007) we know of no other high-resolution soil geochemistry312\ndatasets, based on acid digest and ICP-MS analysis, which could be used as the spatial313\ndatabase. The general problem is whether we can reasonably compute a spatial likelihood314\nfunction for a sample where the chemical analysis has been done by one method, which315\nis different to the method used to obtain the spatial data.316\n13\nTo conclude, the spatial likelihood function seems to be a fruitful way of applying317\ngeostatistical inference to certain problems in forensic soil science. It provides a natural318\nway to integrate soil with other evidence. The main problem, and one which is common319\nto any forensic inference from soil, is how to relate the variability of reference material320\ncollected on a standard support to forensic specimens where the support is unknown and321\nuncontrolled.322\nAcknowledgements323\nR.M.
