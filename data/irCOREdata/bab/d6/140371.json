INTRODUCTION \nThe simultaneous determination of several chemical components of low concentrations in gas mixtures or in the liquid \nsolutions, is the actual task for today and covers the very wide applications area of an ecological monitoring, biomedical \nresearches, and is also useful for determination of parameters of the environments in various technological processes. The \nmost important stages for the development of measuring systems are the choice of elements sensitive to the influence of \nchemical components, the principles and scheme of measurement.  \nFrom the point of view of practical application of separate chemical sensors the most convenient are the fiber-optical \nsensors1. Using several sensors simultaneously, each of which is selectively sensitive to the particular chemical component, \nconsiderably enhances possibilities of the measuring system. The most attractive system of fiber-optical sensors is that, in \nwhich the principles of measurement of each sensor coincide. In this case, usually, in the role of sensitive elements the \nmaterials of one class are used2-4.\nThe advantages of using one class materials for determination of chemical components of solutions or gases are: \n- possibility to use the unified technology for obtaining the sensitive elements; \n- investigated properties and characteristics of these materials; \n- possibility to adjust the parameters with the help of introduction of the chemical additives and operating practices of \nobtaining these sensitive elements. \nVery often interaction of a sensitive elements with the chemical solutions leads to simultaneous change of different optical \nparameters (for instance, transmission spectrums, coefficient of refraction, temporary characteristics of optical processes), \nand various chemical components of a solution influence various optical parameters in a different way. Several \nmeasurements schemes are necessary for their registration, which makes the system of measurement technically more \ncomplicated, but enhances its possibilities and application areas in several times. \nBacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a perspective material for creation of sensitive elements of fiber-optical chemical sensors. \nBacteriorhodopsin is a photosensitive protein, on the base of which films are created, and which optical parameters can be \nchanged, depending on matrixes, chemical additives and the technology of films obtaining. Due to its nature, structure and \nchemical composition, BR and films on its base are sensitive materials to the external physicochemical conditions, and this \npredetermines possibility of using it as sensitive element for optical sensors. \n17th International Conference on Optical Fibre Sensors, Marc Voet, Reinhardt Willsch,\nWolfgang Ecke, Julian Jones, Brian Culshaw, eds., Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5855\n(SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2005) \u00b7 0277-786X\/05\/$15 \u00b7 doi: 10.1117\/12.623662\n411\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 20 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

DESCRIPTION OF FIBER-OPTIC SYSTEM OF CHEMICAL SENSORS \nA Fiber-optic sensor system for measurement of quality and quantity of composition of solutions is offered and approved. \nThe system is constructed with N+1 fiber-optical sensor (where N- number of registered chemical components), with \nsensitive elements as film deposited at the optical fibers end. Each separate film element is selectively sensitive to a \nparticular chemical component. In the offered system two types of measurement techniques - amplitude and (or) interference \nare possible. The principle of work of each sensor is measurement of change of the reflection index on the border of a fiber \nend-film interface (for amplitude type sensor) or change of interference signal, caused by change of  refraction index or \nthickness of a film (for interference type sensor), due to the selective interaction  with one of the components of a chemical \nsolution. Except of N selectively sensitive sensors, the system contains one amplitude optical-fiber end sensor without a \nchemically sensitive film element. The specified sensor, amplitude type, registers the change of reflection index on fiber \nend\u2013investigated medium interface caused by change of refraction index of medium due to changing of common chemical \ncomposition. \nDepending on the measured chemical component, the films with compositions sensitive to this component were deposited by \nappropriate technology as described below. \nFor the experiments with the amplitude fiber-optical sensors with films based on BR, the blue and yellow-green LEDs were \nused.\n3. PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SESNITIVE ELEMENTS \nBacteriorhodopsin was extracted as purple membrane fragments (pmf) from Halobacterium salinarum, strain S9 cultured in \nour laboratory, according to standard procedures5,6.  A suspension of BR and gelatin was prepared from 0.168 ml BR from a \nsuspension of 0.5 mM\/ml; 0.248 ml of 6% w\/v hide gelatin (GE) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Sigma) and tridistilled water to \ngive a final volume of 0.5 ml7. Triethanolamine (TEA) (Sigma), dodecyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide (DTMAB), L-\nargininehydrochloride (AGH) was chosen as a sensitizing additives; the concentration of the chemical additives were in the \nrange of 0.01-0.4 M. Film samples 10-20 Pm thick were prepared by depositing the suspension onto 5 cm2 glass substrates or \nthe end faces of 600 \u00b5m quartz fibers by layering and drying, giving a sample of about 1 optical density, and kept at room \ntemperature.\nPorosity is an important parameter of film sensitive elements for gas sensors which defines the efficiency of sensors. \nTherefore, measurements of porosity of films used as matrixes for films based on BR were carried out. \nThe experiments were held using \u201cSorptomatic 1990\u201d which is a completely computerized instrument based on a static \nvolumetric principle to characterize solid samples by the technique of gas adsorption. The values of a specific surface area \ncomputed by a BET method8, for the gelatin films and PVA was 2,63 and 1,68 m2\/g correspondingly. The values of a \nspecific surface area computed by a BJH9 method were 3,45 and 2,93 m2\/g correspondingly and are shown in the table 1. \nFrom the obtained results it is evident that the specific surface area of GE films is larger than for PVA films, therefore the \nusage the gelatin matrixes is preferable due to higher porosity which allows more gases (or steams) penetrate into a film and \nthis is very important for the sensors performance. The pore sizes distribution determined by the method of nitrogen \ndesorption using the BJH method9. The pores sizes in gelatin and PVA films varies from 1 up to 200 nm, and, the pores of \n1,5 up to 50 nm predominate mainly. The films have strongly developed micro- and mesoporosity.  The size of the pores in \nthese films is small enough to make light scattering negligible.  \nTable 1. Specific surface area and pore volume of gelatin and PVA films. \nWith the purpose to check the quality of a surface of obtained films based on BR, the analysis of surface morphology with \nthe help of atomic-force microscope JSPM- 5210 is done. Results show that the surface of films based on bacteriorhodopsin \nis uniform for both GE (Fig. 1a) and for PVA (Fig.1 b) matrixes. \nSample name Specific surface area, \nm2\/g, B.E.T \nPore specific \nvolume, cm3\/g\nSpecific surface area, \nm2\/g, B.J.H \nGelatin film 2,63 0,003 3,45 \nPVA film 1,68 0,001 2,93 \n412     Proc. of SPIE Vol. 5855\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 20 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

Surface morphology of films based on bacteriorhodopsin in a gelatin matrix (a) and PVA matrix (b).           \nThe results obtained before7, have shown that the atmosphere humidity considerably influences the transmission and half-\ntime of M412 and BR570 intermediates. These changes significantly depend on composition of the chemical additives in films \nof bacteriorhodopsin in polymeric matrixes. The similar measurements of influence of gas-vapor components (Ammonia, \nH2O2, and Chlorine) on the photocycle parameters of films based on BR without and with various photosensitizing additives \nare shown below.\nThe presence of ammonia in the atmosphere surrounding the film resulted in changes of the optical transmittance and the \nphotocycle parameters for both bacteriorhodopsin in a gelatin matrix and bacteriorhodopsin in a gelatin matrix with added \nTEA.  The magnitudes of these changes were significantly different, however.  Figs. 2 and 3 show the time dependence of \ntransmission at 412 and 570 nm upon turning the actinic LED illumination on and then off.  The kinetic changes at 412 and \n570 nm confirm that the presence of ammonia results in changes in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle for all the films \ninvestigated, but the sensitivity depends on film composition; in contrast to the humidity result, films without chemical \nadditives are more sensitive to ammonia.  \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n40 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360 400\n490\n500\n510\n520\n530\n540\n550\n560\n570\nOFF\nON\n1\n2\nT \n, r\nel\nat\niv\ne \nun\nits\nt \/ s\n                           \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n100 200 300 400 500 600\n200\n210\n220\n230\n240\n250\n260\n270\nON\nOFF\n2\n1\nT \n, r\nel\nat\niv\ne \nun\nits\nt \/ s\nFig. 2.
