Charnley\u2019s low-frictional-torque small-\ndiameter metallic head articulating against a poly-\nethylene liner has been successfully implanted for\nmany years [1\u20133]. However, periprosthetic osteoly-\nsis, caused by polyethylene particles released dur-\ning the wear process, has emerged as a major factor\nresulting in the need for revision surgery [4\u20138].\nHard-on-hard bearings are thought to reduce the\nproblems associated with osteolysis by eliminating\npolyethylene wear particles. An increased desire for\nimplantation into younger patients has resulted in a\nsurge of interest in hard-on-hard bearings, which\nhave emerged as a promising alternative bearing\ncombination. The first-generation metal total hip\nreplacements implanted in the 1960s initially indi-\ncated low wear but they were found to produce\nhigh frictional torque due to the lack of knowledge\nof tribological factors such as joint clearance and\nthe requirement for high-quality metallurgical pro-\nperties. Improved manufacturing techniques and\nthe correct choice of clearances resulted in im-\nplants of superior designs during the 1990s such as\nthe Birmingham Hip Resurfacing, which has had\nexcellent medium-term success in young patients\nover a 10 year period [9]. Reports have suggested an\ninherent stability of the device and the likelihood\nthat it will perform well over time [10]. However,\nconcerns regarding the dispersion of metal ions\nthroughout the body are also being voiced. Carci-\nnogenic effects and hypersensitivity reactions have\n*Corresponding author: Centre for Biomedical Engineering,\nSchool of Engineering, Durham University, South Road, Durham\nDH1 3LE, UK.\nemail: junjie.wu@durham.ac.uk\n941\nJEIM590 Proc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\nbeen discussed as potential adverse effects [11] but\ncurrently little evidence has been found to show\nthat elevated metal ions result in a statistically\nsignificant increase in risk of cancer [12] or other\nundesirable conditions.\nBecause of the lack of long-term knowledge\nregarding metal ions, researchers are continuing to\ninvestigate material combinations in the quest to\nreduce the wear and volume of metal ions released.\nFirst-generation ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) pros-\ntheses implanted in the 1970s [13] were unsuccessful\nowing to the large grain size, high porosity, and poor\nsurface finish, all of which had a negative impact on\nthe already low fracture toughness of ceramics.\nHowever, improvements in manufacturing such as\nhot isostatic pressing allowed more recent ceramic\nprostheses to be successful because of the enhanced\nsurface finish and a reduced grain size and porosity.\nThis promoted full fluid-film lubrication and lower\ncoefficients of friction, both of which act to reduce\nwear and particle formation. Nevertheless the under-\nlying problem of the inherent brittleness of the\nceramic remains, and there are reports in the\nliterature of catastrophic failures in vivo [14\u201316].\nIn recent years, ceramic-on-metal (CoM) combina-\ntions have been tested in vitro [17\u201328], with a limited\nnumber being implanted in vivo [29\u201331]. Advantages\nof CoM over metal-on-metal (MoM) and CoC pros-\ntheses included a reduced volume of metal wear\nparticles [26, 31] and a reduced tendency for fracture\nof the ceramic component due to the softer metallic\ncup. The observed reduction in adhesive wear is also\nbeneficial. An additional advantage over a polyethy-\nlene acetabular cup is that increased hardness of the\ncup is expected to promote a reduction in wear, since\nwear is inversely proportional to hardness.\nThe available literature regarding CoM pairings\nhas covered a range of diameters (namely 22mm,\n28mm, 32mm, 36mm, 38mm), and 54mm compo-\nnents [17\u201324, 28], with a range of radial clearances.\nWear, friction, and particles produced during simu-\nlation have all been investigated [17\u201328, 31, 32].\nFirkins et al. [20] in 2000 reported the first\nsimulator study investigating the CoM combination.\nOverall for alumina of 28mm diameter against Co\u2013\nCr alloy, a very low wear rate of 0.01mm3\/106 cycles\nwas found. A higher rate of 0.04mm3\/106 cycles was\nfound in one component after 0.56106 cycles. Dif-\nficulties in measuring the wear using gravimetric\ntechniques were noted and attributed to material\ntransfer and the very small amount of wear itself.\nLow wear rates have also been found for alumina\nheads of 38mm diameter against Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo cups\n[17] with running-in (RI) and steady state (SS) wear\nrates of 1.01mm3\/106 cycles and 0.10mm3\/106 cycles\nrespectively. The overall wear rate was 0.39mm3\/106\ncycles, with the majority of the wear due to the\nmetallic cup. In comparison with their standard\n32mm MoM joints, the wear of the CoM was seen\nto give a fourfold reduction.\nA recent study [28] compared larger-diameter\n(54mm) MoM and CoM implant bearings. The com-\nbination of an alumina head against as-cast Co\u2013Cr\u2013\nMo alloy was found to exhibit the least wear, namely\n0.018mm3\/106 cycles. In addition a differential-\nhardness MoM joint was investigated and compared\nwith a \u2018like\u2019-hardness MoM pairing. The differential-\nhardness MoM joint was found to exhibit 68 per cent\nless volumetric wear than the \u2018like\u2019-hardness MoM\npairing (steady state rates of 0.060mm3\/106 cycles\nand 0.011mm3\/6106 cycles for differential-hardness\nand \u2018like\u2019-hardness MoM pairings respectively). This\nsuggests that it is advantageous to have a femoral\nhead with a greater hardness than the cup.\nExperiments other than simulator wear tests have\nalso provided corroborative evidence. A very short\nstudy investigating a Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo pin articulating\nagainst an alumina plate over 90 000 cycles [25]\nand a further pin-on-plate study [32] testing both\nMoM and CoM combinations found a decreased\noverall wear rate and metallic ion release for the\nCoM combination compared with the MoM pairing.\nTwo retrieval studies have been published regard-\ning CoM pairings. These were a Metasul cup against\na Biolox alumina head [29] and a stainless steel head\nagainst an alumina cup [30], both of which were\nrevised owing to pain. The latter was replaced 1 year\nafter the primary operation by a metal-on-polyethy-\nlene (MoP) joint owing to pain and a growingmass on\nthe proximal thigh. The Biolox head of the Metasul\u2013\nBiolox combination was inserted on revision 1 year\nafter the primary operation. After 1 year and 6\nmonths, a polyethylene inlay and metal head were\ninserted owing to pain and the detection of noises by\nthe physician on examination. Following the failure\nof the Metasul socket against the Biolox aluminium\noxide ceramic head, Hinrich and Griss [29] ex-\npressed concerns over a number of issues regarding\nCoM combinations. They felt that the wear pattern\nraised suspicions that sphericity and matching of the\nheads and cups may be more important than in\nMoM and CoC. They also questioned what would\nhappen to CoM components when an incorrectly\npositioned component was implanted, and recom-\nmended that further research and development of\nCoM components should be undertaken. Although\n942 S R Williams, J J Wu, A Unsworth, and I Khan\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine JEIM590\nthese reports highlighted negative results for CoM\ncombinations, a detailed study by Williams et al.\n[31] has revealed promising in-vitro and in-vivo\nwear results for the CoMcombinations. Short-term stud-\nies of 31 people at 6 months after implantation\nshowed lower metal ion levels in those with a CoM\njoint in comparison with those having MoM bear-\nings. Also the cumulative volumetric wear of MoM\nwas found to be greater than those of CoC and CoM\npairings where no difference in volumetric wear was\nfound.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Materials\nThe prostheses used in this study consisted of six\nRecapH Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo as-cast acetabular cups of 38mm\ndiameter, and six hot isostatically pressed alumina\nfemoral heads supplied by Biomet UK. The heads\nwere mounted onto poly(methyl methacrylate)-\ncoated stainless steel tapered stems, and the cups\nmounted into ultra-high molecular weight polyethy-\nlene (UHMWPE) holders for simulator and friction\nmeasurement. Components were matched to give\nsimilar radial clearances of approximately 100 mm, as\nshown in Table 1.\n2.2 Lubricant\nA solution of new-born calf serum (Harlan Sera-Lab\nLimited; total protein content, 7.5 g\/dl) was diluted\nto 25 per cent using distilled water with additions of\nboth 0.2 per cent sodium azide to prevent bacterial\ngrowth and 20mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA) to prevent calcium phosphate precipitation\nonto the bearing surfaces [33]. Friction tests were\ncarried out using viscosities of bovine serum (BS)\nmixed with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) of\n0.125 Pa s, 0.0315 Pa s, 0.0085Pa s, and 0.0039 Pa s,\nand 25 per cent diluted BS with a viscosity of\n0.0013 Pa s. Aqueous solutions of CMC were also\nused as a lubricant at viscosities of 0.092 Pa s,\n0.0275 Pa s, 0.0095Pa s, 0.0030 Pa s, and 0.001 Pa s.\nCMC was chosen because of its similar rheological\nproperties to synovial fluid. The joints were cleaned\nbetween friction tests using a weak solution of\nNeutracon, followed by propan-2-ol. The same batch\nof lubricant was used throughout all tests to reduce\nvariability.\n2.3 Wear simulator experiments\nWear experiments were carried out on the Mark II\nDurham hip wear simulator, which has two axes of\nmotion: flexion\u2013extension and internal\u2013external ro-\ntation. This was achieved using a crank and con-\nnecting-rod arrangement driven by an a.c. motor at\n1Hz, to oscillate the femoral component with an\napproximate sinusoidal motion through +30u and\n215u. A second similar mechanism directly drove the\ninternal\u2013external rotation drive bar, causing the\nacetabular component to oscillate with approximate\nsinusoidal motion in the internal\u2013external rotation\nplane through \u00a15u. A square-wave loading cycle (a\nminimum and a maximum of 300N and 2600N res-\npectively) was applied across the joint. The direction\nof load varied as the angle of flexion\u2013extension.\nAcetabular components were mounted at 33u to the\nhorizontal in all five articulating wear stations as well\nas the loaded soak control station.\nWear tests were carried out to 56106 cycles,\ninterrupted at 0.56106 cycle intervals to measure\ngravimetric wear of both the acetabular and the\nfemoral components. The protocol to clean the pro-\nstheses ensured total protein removal from the\ncomponents between measurements. Briefly, the\ncomponents were removed from the wear simulator,\nand bulk contaminants removed by flushing with\nwater. Following this a series of washes in an\nultrasonic bath was carried out. The middle time\nperiod used a weak solution of Neutracon to remove\nany grease or dirt from the surfaces. After this, the\njoints were rinsed in propan-2-ol and dried in a\nvacuum oven at 40 uC for 30min. The components\nwere allowed to acclimatize to room temperature in\nthe metrology laboratory before being weighed using\na precision balance. Throughout the cleaning pro-\ntocol a soft brush was used on the back of the\nTable 1 Ceramic heads against metal cup pairings and clearances\nStation Co\u2013Cr cup number Alumina head number Clearance (mm)\n1 9 4 100\n2 6 2 98\n3 5 9 99\n4 2 35 98\n5 3 6 97\nControl 4 10 99\nTribological and surface analysis of total hip arthroplasties 943\nJEIM590 Proc.

The loaded soak control was used to\ntake account of any variation due to fluid absorption\nand environmental changes such as changes in\nhumidity and temperature. Volumetric wear rates\nwere calculated using 3.98061023 g\/mm3 and 8.2876\n1023 g\/mm3 for the densities of the alumina fem-\noral head and the Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo alloy acetabular cup\nrespectively.\n2.4 Friction: theoretical and practical\nResults of friction measurements using the Durham\nhip function simulator were used to indicate the\nlubrication regime under which the joints were\noperating, through Stribeck analysis. The friction\nfactor was plotted against a modified version of the\nSommerfeld number which was calculated using\nz~\ngur\nL\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere g is the viscosity of the lubricant, u is the\nentraining velocity, L is the load, and r is the radius\nof the femoral head. A falling trend in friction factor\nis indicative of mixed lubrication, and a rising trend\nof full fluid-film lubrication. The friction factor itself\nis given by\nf~\nT\nrL\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere T is the frictional torque generated between\nthe bearing surfaces, r is the radius of the femoral\nhead, and L is the applied load.\nTests were performed with flexion\u2013extension of\n\u00a123u at a frequency of 1Hz. Tests were performed\nusing simple harmonic motion of amplitude 25u and\na frequency of 1Hz. The load cycle was approxi-\nmately a square wave with a maximum and mini-\nmum of 2000N and 100N respectively. Each test was\nperformed in the normal and inverse directions in\norder to eliminate any residual error from misalign-\nment of the bearing components. Data were logged\nat the 21st and 41st cycles, providing six data points\neach of which were an average of five points taken at\nthe peak-load and high-velocity phase of the cycle.\nEach joint was tested three times and an average and\nstandard deviation calculated for each data point\n[34, 35].\nThe theoretical lubrication mode was also calcu-\nlated using the predicted minimum film thickness\nand recorded the average r.m.s. roughness of the\nbearing surfaces, as recorded using the Zygo non-\ncontacting three-dimensional profilometer.

If\nl, 1, then the bearing would theoretically operate in\nboundary lubrication.\nThe minimum-film-thickness calculation, taking\ninto account the importance of elastic deformation\nof the bearing surfaces as determined by Hamrock\nand Dowson [37], is\nhmin\nRx\n~2:798\ngu\nE\n0\nRx\n\u0001 \u00020:65\nL\nE\n0\nR2x\n\u0001 \u0002{0:21\n\u00f04\u00de\n2.5 Wear track experimental detection\nDuring wear testing, a deposit formed on the bear-\ning surfaces surrounding the contact area. Digital\nimages of the Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo acetabular cups were taken\nto visualize the deposition; however, it was not\nvisible using a digital camera on the alumina fem-\noral heads. Because of the fluorescent nature of\nthe deposit, an ultraviolet (UV) source and charge-\ncoupled device (CCD) camera were used to image\nthe heads. Images were taken through 360u to\nvisualize the complete head and then analysed using\nLabVIEW 8 and a program written by the School of\nChemistry, Durham University.\n2.6 Surface analysis\nSeveral surface-analytical techniques were used to\nmonitor changes in the surface topography of the\ncomponents.\nSurface topography was measured throughout the\ntest using a three-dimensional non-contacting op-\ntical interference Zygo profilometer (NewView 100,\nZygo, Middlefield, Connecticut, USA). Measure-\nments were taken at 06106 cycles, 26106 cycles,\n36106 cycles, and 56106 cycles. At least ten meas-\nurements were taken in the contact area for both\nthe head and the cups, with additional measure-\nments taken at 26106 and 56106 cycles in the non-\ncontact areas.\nOptical micrographs were taken at 2.56106 cycles,\n36106 cycles, and 56106 cycles to monitor the top-\nography of the surface throughout the wear test.\n944 S R Williams, J J Wu, A Unsworth, and I Khan\nProc.

The overall RI\nwear rate of 1.04\u00a10.293mm3\/106 cycles (mean,\n\u00a195 per cent confidence interval) was measured;\nhowever, the heads experienced a gravimetrically\nnon-detectable change in wear throughout the\n56106 cycle test. After the initial higher wear rate\nexperienced by the cups a wear rate of 0.0209\u00a1\n0.004mm3\/106 cycles (mean, \u00a195 per cent con-\nfidence interval) was seen from 0.56106 cycles to\n56106 cycles. The greater wear seen by cup 9 at\n36106 cycles arose because the joint ran dry, after\nwhich the joint returned to the lower wear rate.\n3.2 Friction\nFigure 2 shows a typical Stribeck plot of an alu-\nmina head against a Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo cup worn to 56106\ncycles in a standard wear simulator. The joint was\nlubricated in a range of viscosities of both CMC\nfluid and BS with the addition of CMC fluid. After\n56106 cycles of wear testing, the friction factor of\nthe prostheses when lubricated in BS was found to\nbe higher than when lubricated in CMC fluids. A\ndistinct difference could be seen between the fric-\ntion factors resulting from lubrication with the two\ndifferent fluids. The friction factor in 25 per cent BS\nwas 0.052 and with distilled water was 0.017.

Engineering in Medicine\ntors, indicate that the joint is working close to full\nfluid-film lubrication in parts of the walking cycle.\nThe theoretical lubrication modes shown in\nTable 2 support the experimental results. The calcu-\nlations show that the joints were operating close to\nor within full fluid-film lubrication for the majority\nof 56106 cycles of standard walking-cycle wear. This\nis supported by both the wear rates and the top-\nography images, which show low wear on both the\nbearing surfaces.\n3.3 Surface analysis\nAnalysis of the bearing surfaces during wear simu-\nlator testing revealed a white deposit on both\ncomponents, as shown in Figs 3 and 4. The deposit\non the ceramic heads was difficult to see by eye and\ntherefore was visualized using a UV light and a CCD\ncamera. The deposit was clearly visible on the\nmetallic cups and therefore was recorded using a\ndigital camera. The deposit was situated on the pole\nof the head, leaving a clear circular contact area\nwhere no deposit was present. Many abrasive\nscratches protruded into the deposit, revealing the\nunderlying ceramic material. There was no evidence\nof deposited material on the surface of the loaded\ncontrol sample.\nSurface analysis of the ceramic heads using a\nwhite-light profilometer showed minimal wear or\nsurfaces changes. Small quantities of metal transfer\ncould be seen on the heads, the majority deposited\noutside the contact area, which is a result of setting\nup the simulator. Analysis showed the transfer to\nbe nanometres thick. ESEM analysis of the heads\nrevealed visible grains in the centre of the wear\npatch with occasional grain removal (Fig. 5(a)). Faint\nmulti-directional scratches were also visible. Regular\ndirectional scratching was seen outside the wear\npatch; however, the grains were much less obvious\nunless a single grain or cluster of grains had been\npulled out (Fig. 5(b)).\nGrain pull-out could clearly be seen when the\nsurface ceramic femoral head was analysed with an\natomic force microscope. Micrographs were taken in\nthe wear patch on the pole of the head. Figure 6(a)\nshows a 100 mm scan of the surface on the pole in\nwhich pulled-out grains appear to be to 5 mm in\nsize.

IMechE Vol. 223 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine JEIM590\nconfirms this and clearly shows abrasive scratches.\nThe grains were clearly visible on the pole of all\nheads but generally not away from the wear track.\nImages of the loaded control head and unworn areas\nof the worn components revealed multi-directional\npolishing scratches, where grains were not visible\nand grain pull-out was not observed. This is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 6(c).\nPitting, carbide pull-out, and matrix removal were\nprogressively seen in the metallic cups throughout\nthe wear testing, with increased amount of scratches\nseen in the wear track. The width of the scratches\nappeared to be similar in size to the pits formed\nduring material pull-out. By contrast, images taken\nout of the wear patch remained constant throughout\nthe test.\n3.4 Surface measurements\nThe average r.m.s. roughness (Fig. 8) of the ceramic\nheads at 0 cycles was 0.010mm, which was almost\ninvariant throughout the wear test. Similarly, the\nr.m.s. roughness for the cups maintained a relatively\nconstant value between 0.016 mm and 0.017mm up to\n56106 cycles (see Table 2).\nThe peak-to-valley values (Fig. 9) for both the\nhead and the cup were initially similar because the\nmanufacturing finishing process produces a micro-\nscopically smooth surface. At 26106 cycles and\n36106 cycles, the cups revealed a greater peak-to-\nvalley value than the heads; however, at 56106 cycles\nthe peak-to-valley value of the heads was consider-\nably greater than that of the cups.\nThe cups initially had a positive skewness value\n(Fig. 10); conversely the heads had a negative\nskewness. As the test progressed the skewness of\nthe worn cup became consistently negative; how-\never, the control cup remained positive. The head\nskewness did not change much until 56106 cycles\nwhereas both the control and the worn heads\nbecame noticeably negatively skewed, which indi-\ncates deeper valleys than peaks.\n4 DISCUSSION\nThe aim of this study was to carry out a thorough\nexamination of the wear and friction of six alumina\nheads of 38mmdiameter against Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo alloy cup\ntotal hip replacements provided by Biomet UK. Wear\nwas determined gravimetrically up to 56106 cycles\nin an attempt to indicate the performance of CoM\ncombinations. Various surface-analytical techniques\nwere undertaken to monitor the changes in the\nsurfaces throughout the wear test. Friction measure-\nments were used to determine the lubricating mech-\nanism prevalent between this material combina-\ntion as indicated by the Stribeck plot, in which\na falling trend in friction factor with increasing\nSommerfeld number is indicative of mixed lubri-\ncation, and a rising trend is indicative of full fluid-\nfilm lubrication. The optimum result would be a\nmaterial combination which exhibits full fluid-film\nlubrication; this would then be likely to exhibit\nlower wear.\nKnowledge of CoM prostheses is growing rapidly,\nand the majority of work to date has revealed a\npositive outcome for CoM combinations. Joint\ndiameters from 28mm to 54mm have been inves-\ntigated, giving steady state wear rates in the range\nof 0.01\u20130.1mm3\/106 cycles. Ranges of diametrical\nclearances, types of simulator, and lubricants have\nbeen used, all of which result in similar wear rates. In\nthe current study the five pairs of joints were found\nto experience similar wear rates throughout the test.\nHowever, the wear of the femoral heads was found\nto be undetectable using the current gravimetric\nFig. 5 Typical ESEM images of the alumina head (a) in\nthe wear track and (b) out of the wear track\nTribological and surface analysis of total hip arthroplasties 947\nJEIM590 Proc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\nmethod; therefore the wear rates are presented for\nthe metallic cups only.\nOpinions are divided as to whether a biphasic\nwear pattern is observed for wear of CoM combina-\ntions. Firkins et al. [20] presented the first simulator\nstudy regarding CoM pairings and did not find an RI\nphase. Smith et al. [18] reported a biphasic wear rate\nonly for the larger-diameter (28mm rather than\n22mm) prostheses and suggested that the RI phase\nwas faster in the CoM pairing than in the MoM\nreplacements. It was proposed that this was due to\nboth the replacement of the metallic head with a\nceramic component, which introduced an initially\nsmoother material that was not likely to undergo a RI\nphase, and accelerated polishing of the metallic cup\nby the smoother harder ceramic component. How-\never, Ishida et al. [17] presented a biphasic wear\npattern for 38mm and 32mm CoM joints tested in\nan orbital simulator to 3.56106 cycles using a calf\nserum as the lubricant. In the current study a higher\nwear rate was found for the metallic cups between\nzero and the first measurement at 0.56106 cycles,\ncompared with the rest of the test. This RI phase was\nlikely to be due to polishing of the metallic cups by\nthe ceramic head, causing flattening or removal of\nthe carbides and raised matrix material of the metal\ncup during wear. Initially the theoretical calculations\nof l gave values between 3.3 and 3.7, indicating little\nasperity contact with behaviour towards full fluid-\nfilm lubrication. As wear progressed, the theoretical\ncalculations indicated a move towards full fluid-film\nlubrication.\nThe wear of the CoM pairings was found to be\nsimilar to fully ceramic replacements presented in\nthe literature, a selection of which is shown in\nTable 3. The low wear of CoM joints as shown in this\nstudy is an attractive option for total hip replace-\nments, as the replacement of the ceramic cup with\na metal cup reduces the chances of fracture or\nchipping of the ceramic when in vivo.\nThe current study revealed the ceramic head wear\nrate to be too small to measure using the gravi-\nFig. 6 AFM image of a ceramic head (a) in the wear track (pole) showing individual grain\nremoval, (b) at a greater magnification in the wear track (pole) showing individual grain\nremoval and abrasive scratches, and (c) in an unworn area of the head\n948 S R Williams, J J Wu, A Unsworth, and I Khan\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine JEIM590\nmetric method; however, a change in surface topo-\ngraphy was noticed, indicating that some wear had\noccurred. A change in r.m.s. roughness was not\nobserved; however, a change in skewness was\nnoticed when analysed using a profilometer. Grain\npull-out and a change in the orientation and\nregularity of the scratches was found during ESEM\nand AFM analysis, indicating wear, albeit an ex-\ntremely small amount. The wear that did occur was\nimportant, as some generated third-body wear of the\nmetallic cups.\nIn the current study, a white deposit was also\nnoticed on both the ceramic head and the metallic\ncup. Digital images were taken of the cups, in which\nthe deposit can be seen in the superior quadrant of\nall cups, with the exception of the control, where no\ndeposition was found. The wear patch can clearly be\nFig. 7 Optical image of a Co\u2013Cr\u2013Mo alloy in the wear\ntrack after 56106 cycles in a standard walking-\ncycle simulator showing (a) abrasive wear\nwhere the carbides in the matrix can be seen\nfaintly and (b) pitting of the matrix and abrasive\nwear where the flattened carbides can be seen\nfaintly\nFig. 8 Average change in r.m.s. roughness with num-\nber of cycles of the 38mm alumina against Co\u2013\nCr\u2013Mo alloy joints worn in a standard walking-\ncycle simulator\nFig. 9 Average change in peak-to-valley height with\nnumber of cycles of the 38mm alumina against\nCo\u2013Cr\u2013Mo alloy joints worn in a standard\nwalking-cycle simulator\nFig. 10 Average change in skewness with number of\ncycles of 38mm alumina against metal joints\nworn in a standard walking-cycle simulator\nTribological and surface analysis of total hip arthroplasties 949\nJEIM590 Proc.

Scratches protrude into the\ndeposit, showing that abrasive wear was occurring;\nhowever, these scratches are not noticeable on the\nunderlying metallic surface. The deposit was located\non the top of the ceramic heads in a u-shaped\npattern which was evident on all heads except the\ncontrol. As with the cups, scratches were visible in\nthe deposit but not the actual ceramic surface. The\narea with no deposition on the cup corresponded to\nthe area on the head and was therefore expected to\nbe the wear patch. On the cups, the wear patch was\nevident owing to visible carbide pull-out and\nabrasive wear. This can be seen from the optical\nimages of the cup where the carbide and matrix\nmaterial was pulled out, and corresponding scratch-\ning of the matrix material is obvious (Fig. 7(a)). It\ncould be concluded that third-body particles may\nhave caused the damage, as these are possibly due\nto carbides or alumina grains removed from the\nfemoral heads. The scratches seen were continuous\nover the harder carbide components within the\nmatrix; therefore a material of similar or greater\nhardness is likely to have caused the damage. The\nparallel regular scratches in the pole indicated that\nwear was due to repetitive movement during\nsimulation, which was not present outside the wear\npatch (Figs 7(a) and (b)).\nFor the ceramic femoral heads, no noticeable\nchanges in surface roughness were found through-\nout the tests, indicating little wear. Although ESEM\nand AFM images showed occasional grain pull-\nout in the wear track (e.g. Figs 6(a) and (b)), there\nwas no macroscopic damage on any worn head.\nGrains were visible on the wear patch but, outside\nthe wear patch,multi-directional polishingmarks res-\nulting from manufacture were observed (Fig. 6(c)).\nChanges in the surface topography were found.\nThe peak-to-valley value of the cups was greatest at\n26106 cycles (Fig. 9). This may be due to carbide\npull-out during the first stages of the wear testing. A\nsmall decrease between 36106 cycles and 56106\ncycles was probably caused by polishing of the metal\ncup by the harder ceramic head. Conversely the\nceramic heads were found to have their greatest\npeak-to-valley value at 56106 cycles, possibly owing\nto grain pull-out in the wear track. As polishing is\nless likely to occur on the ceramics, the holes left by\npulled-out grains would remain at the original depth,\ntherefore resulting in a large peak-to-valley value.\nHowever, it must be noted that small defects on the\nsurface can lead to artificially large peak-to-valley\nvalues; the peak-to-valley value is not an average of\nthe surface, but the largest distance between the\nhighest and lowest points within the examination\narea. A low surface roughness with a large peak-to-\nvalley value can indicate an individual feature on the\nhead, rather than the large peak-to-valley value\nrepresenting the dominant surface feature. The\nskewness values were as expected, with initially both\nhead and cup showing skewness values close to zero\n(Fig. 10), indicating that the surface is equally as\nlikely to have asperities above and below the mean\nline. However, as the test progressed, the skewness\nvalues for the metallic cups became more negative,\nindicating deep troughs compared with shallow\npeaks. This is consistent with the proposal that\ncarbides are pulled out of the surface during wear\ntesting. The ceramic heads produced low skewness\nvalues throughout testing until 56106 cycles, where\nthe worn heads became largely negatively skewed.\nThis is consistent with the increase in the peak-to-\nvalley value, and the observation of some grain pull-\nout, causing an increased change in the surface\ntopography generally below the mean line. The\nstandard deviation of the skewness of the worn\nheads at 56106 cycles is large, and some heads had\npositive skewnesses. The result for the control at\n56106 cycles is surprising.\nThe present study observed some material transfer\nonto the ceramic heads; however, currently no\nanalysis of the elemental composition has been\nundertaken. It is thought that the deposition re-\nvealed in the current study is not composed of\ncalcium phosphate, owing to the addition of EDTA\nto the BS which acts to bind the calcium in solution,\ntherefore preventing deposition of calcium onto the\nsurfaces. Thus deposition is likely to be predomi-\nnantly due to albumin and a, b, and c globulins.\nScholes [43] reported the deposition of protein on\nMoM, MoP, and CoC material combinations, which\nwas analysed using sodium dodecyl sulphate poly-\nTable 3 CoC literature review\nStudy Materials Size (mm)\nClearance\n(mm) Steady state (mm3\/106)\nNevelos et al.

However, the\nanalysis was carried out on the deposition which\noccurred during soaking in bovine serum for 24h,\nand not on the deposition caused during wear\nsimulation. Therefore the composition of the two\ndepositions may differ. In previous studies, Firkins et\nal. [20] reported that surface analysis showed no\nsigns of wear or changes in surface roughness after\ntesting; however, metal transfer (less than 20nm\nthick) and calcium phosphate deposits were found at\nthe edge of the contact area. It was concluded that,\nas this was not in the wear track, it had no effect on\nthe wear of the bearing surfaces. Energy-dispersive\nX-ray analysis confirmed that it was Co\u2013Cr alloy with\nan elemental composition similar to that of the main\nmatrix; however, it was found that it did not appear\nto accelerate the wear of the metal cups.\nFriction was used to indicate the lubrication\nregime which was prevalent in the joints under\ninvestigation. The CoM combinations worn to 56106\ncycles showed low friction factors below 0.052 with a\ncurve shape indicating that the joints were likely to\nbe operating in full fluid-film lubrication. The joint\nshowed a decrease in friction factor from 0.052\u00a1\n0.007, when proteins were present, to 0.017\u00a10.017\nin the absence of protein (Fig. 2). The results when\nemploying CMC fluids as a lubricant are similar to\nthat found for CoC joints, which typically produced\nfriction factors of 0.002 compared with 0.004 for\nCoM (except for distilled water, which was 0.017\u00a1\n0.017) [44, 45].\nIt has been hypothesized that the proteins which\nadsorb onto the surface are responsible for the\nchange in lubrication, in addition to the surface\ntopography of the bearing contact. Scholes and\nUnsworth [46] investigated the effects of proteins\non the friction and lubrication of hip joints. They\ncompared the hip material prostheses of MoP, MoM,\nand CoC lubricated in CMC fluids, and BS, with\nthe addition of CMC. Their results showed that,\nfor MoM, BS produced the lower friction factors\nbetween 0.09 and 0.15, while the CMC fluids pro-\nduced friction factors between 0.2 and 0.3. Con-\nversely the CoC components produced friction\nfactors less than a hundredth (0.001\u20130.006) of the\nvalues given by MoM pairings when proteins were\nabsent. When proteins were present, the friction\nfactors were found to be between 0.02 and 0.06.\nTheir reasoning for the CoC result was that, when\nprotein was absent, the bearing surfaces, having\nl. 3, allowed full fluid-film lubrication, and so the\nfriction in the joint was due to shearing of the\nlubricant film. When proteins were introduced into\nthe lubricant, they adsorbed onto the surface,\nintroducing a molecule which is greater in size than\nthe fluid film thickness; therefore the proteins\nadsorbed to the surface were sheared in addition to\nthe proteins and constituents of the lubricant film.\nCurrently, to the present authors\u2019 knowledge, there\nare no published data which quantify the size of the\nprotein layer which adsorbs to the surface during\nsimulator testing that uses BS as a lubricant. A report\nby Spikes [47] in 1996 discussed that adsorbing\npolymer solutions are able to form viscous surface\nlayers at least 20 nm thick, which is thought to\ninteract during boundary lubrication conditions.\nAlthough these data are not known, it can be\nhypothesized that the adsorbed proteins created a\ngreater friction factor than when the friction was\nsolely caused by shearing of the CMC lubricant film.\nIn addition, adsorption of proteins onto the surface\nmay act to alter the surface properties, reducing the\nhydrophilic nature of the ceramic surfaces, and\ntherefore reducing the effectiveness of the lubri-\ncation. By contrast, the MoM joints were found to\nhave lower friction factors when the proteins were\npresent. The interactions between asperities was a\nmixture of metal against metal and protein against\nprotein, which lowered the friction produced (com-\npared with just metal-against-metal contact).\nThe results of the present study support these\nhypotheses. The metallic cups had a low average\nsurface roughness; therefore the CoM pairing showed\nresults with the same trend as CoC pairings, with an\nincrease in friction factor when proteins were present.\nGrain pull-out seen on the alumina femoral head\nand carbide pull-out of the metallic acetabular cup\nprovided a topography with a negative skewness,\nwhich is more favourable than a positive skewness\ntowards fluid-film lubrication. The friction factors for\nCoM are higher than CoC joints, owing to the small\namount of metal-against-ceramic asperity interaction\nwhich occurred. These friction factors were lower\nthan with MoM joints as the adhesive forces between\nmetal-against-metal interactions are much greater\nthan those of ceramic-against-metal interactions. It\nmust be noted, however, that the difference between\nthe friction factors when protein is or is not present is\nconsiderably less than that seen for other material\ncombinations\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe wear rate of the metallic cups was discovered\nto be 1.04\u00a10.293mm3\/106 cycles and 0.0209\u00a10.004\nmm3\/106 cycles for the RI and SS phases respec-\nTribological and surface analysis of total hip arthroplasties 951\nJEIM590 Proc.

This\npull-out is likely to cause the decreased surface\nroughness and the scratching in the wear track. The\nsmooth surface finish and greater hardness of the\nceramic component are likely to have caused polish-\ning of the scratches during continued wear testing,\ntherefore resulting in a lower surface roughness\nthan may be expected for metal in MoM combina-\ntions. The friction results of joints tested at 56106\ncycles suggested that the joints were tending\ntowards full fluid-film lubrication, with the results\nshowing a similar trend to CoC combinations with\nan increase in friction found when lubricated in BS\ncompared with CMC fluids. A white deposit was\nseen on both components after each phase of wear\ntesting, which was removed every 0.56106 cycles to\nallow for gravimetric analysis. In summary, the\nwear of CoM components was found to be gra-\nvimetrically undetectable on the ceramic compo-\nnent, and very low on the as-cast metallic cups.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council and Biomet UK Ltd for\nfunding this research, and also thank the latter for\nmaterial provision.
