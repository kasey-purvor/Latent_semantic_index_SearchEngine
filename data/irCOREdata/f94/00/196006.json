Introduction \n \nThe Ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n Resonator (IAR) results from the vertical structure associated with the \ndecay in plasma density going from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere, whose existence was first \npredicted by Polyakov, (1976).  The lower boundary region occurs in the ionospheric F-layer. The \nupper boundary of the IAR corresponds to the region where Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating along the \ngeomagnetic field lines are partially reflected by large Alfv\u00e9n velocity gradients, caused by the \nrapid decrease in plasma density above the F-layer density peak.  At this upper boundary (defined \nby a sharp peak in the Alfv\u00e9n velocity profile at an altitude of ~0.5 RE) energisation of electrons \noccurs, which ultimately leads to the excitation of aurora.  These energised particles can also be \ndetected by orbiting spacecraft.  As such the IAR holds great promise for revealing important \nphysics in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and auroral particle acceleration. The characteristic \nsignatures of the resonant IAR cavity were first observed by Belyaev et al. (1987) in the form of \nmultiple horizontally banded spectral resonance structures (SRS) in dynamic spectra of mid-latitude \nmagnetic background noise between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz derived from pulsation magnetometer data.  \nSuch signatures are weak, and easily masked by other wave phenomena, but may be observed over \nseveral hours on geomagnetically quiet days.  Strong diurnal control of the SRS signatures is \nusually observed, with the lowest frequencies observed when solar illumination and hence \nionospheric density are the strongest.  Here we review recent progress in understanding the IAR at \nhigh latitude.  This review is divided into four sections; naturally occurring resonances in the \nauroral zone; naturally occurring resonances within the polar cap; artificial stimulation of the IAR \nin the auroral zone; and finally artificial stimulation of the IAR within the polar cap. \n \n2.  Natural resonances of the IAR at high latitude \n \n2.1  The auroral zone \n \n 2 \nIAR resonance features at high latitudes were first observed as SRS signatures between 0.2 and 5 \nHz by Belyaev et al., (1999).  In order to understand the controlling factors in the observed SRS \nfrequencies, Hebden et al. (2005) investigated the evolution of the resonant frequencies with local \ntime for days when they were clearly visible. Spectra from a whole month of pulsation \nmagnetometer data from Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland were considered, during which ten clear intervals of \nSRS were identified.  Dynamic spectra of the magnetometer data were produced by applying a Fast \nFourier Transform (FFT) to a sliding window of 100 s of data, with a slip of 100 s, producing a \nfrequency resolution of 0.01 Hz and a time resolution of 100 s.  Figure 1 presents an average of 24 \nsuch spectra, in order to highlight persistent SRS features over more ephemeral noise signals, \nreducing the time resolution to 40 min. \nWhen the diurnal variation of the frequencies of the SRS signatures such as those illustrated in \nFigure 1 were examined, a strong linear relationship was found between harmonic frequency and \nharmonic number, consistent with the simple 1-D vertical model of Trakhtengerts et al. (2000), in \nwhich the IAR consists of 3 layers of constant density. The middle layer represents the standing \nwave cavity which is bounded below by a conduction layer and above by a low density layer \nleading to the wave trapping and resonance features of the IAR.  This model was thus used for \ninterpretation of the signatures.  For resonances characterised by wave speed va, and cavity scale \nsize L, the frequency f of the harmonic signature number N is given by \nL\nvNf a\n2\n)( \u03a6+= , (1)  \nwhere \u03a6 is the wave \u201cphase factor\u201d and N =0, 1, 2\u2026 (based on Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981, but \nadopting the terminology used by Hebden et al., 2005).  The value of \u03a6 is controlled by the \nreflection coefficient at the lower IAR bounbdary, which is given by \n ,\n1\n1\n+\u03a3\u03a3\n\u2212\u03a3\u03a3=\nPw\nPwR  (2) \nwhere \u03a3P is the height integrated Pedersen conductivity and \u03a3w is the wave impedence (Lysak, \n1991), \nIAR\n1\nvo\nw \u03bc=\u03a3 . (3) \nFor a wave node at the lower reflecting boundary, as expected for high \u03a3P, then R=-1 and \u03a6 will \nbe half integer.  Conversely, for a wave antinode at the lower reflecting boundary, as expected for \nlow \u03a3P, then R=1 and \u03a6 will be integer (Lysak, 1991).  The upper boundary is always an antinode.  \nThis arrangement is illustrated in Figure 2.  Hebden et al. (2005) performed an analysis comparing \nmodel and data for 10 SRS intervals, and concluded that the average value of \u03a6 was 0.61, close to \nthe value expected for the high Pedersen conductivity limit.  An average value of the scale length of \nthe cavity, L was also calculated at L=530 km, 2-3 times the typical plasma scale height in the \nionosphere.  They concluded that changes in the observed SRS frequencies were dominated by \nchanges in the ionospheric plasma density, and hence the Alfv\u00e9n velocity, rather than changes in the \ncavity size or lower reflection boundary condition, which were considerably more stable with time \nof day. \n \n2.2  The polar cap (Barentsburg) \n \nWhilst the characteristics of the IAR at auroral latitudes have come under detailed scrutiny over \nrecent years, the polar cap region is much less studied.  Recently natural SRS have been observed in \npulsation magnetometer data from Barentsburg, Svalbard at L-shells of 15 (Semenova et al., 2005). \nIt was found that the characteristics of SRS within the polar cap were similar to those observed in \nthe auroral zone and that they could be explained by similar IAR theory.  An example of polar cap \nIAR signatures is presented in Figure 3.  Observations from the D component on 15 August 2005 \n 3 \nare presented from the pulsation magnetometer of the Barentsburg Observatory of the Polar \nGeophysical Institute.  Here a sampling rate of 40 Hz and a 1024 point FFT analysis provides a \nspectrum every 25.6 s, with a frequency resolution of 0.04 Hz.  The top panel of Figure 3 presents \naverages of 20 such spectra, resulting in an 8.5 min FFT window, which is slipped by 25.6 s in the \ndynamic spectrum, and normalised to the peak power at 3 Hz.  Clear signatures of SRS are seen, but \nwith less of a diurnal variation of the SRS frequencies than is observed in the auroral zone, as a \nresult of the very high latitude and permanent solar illumination during August.  As discussed in \nSection 2.1, the harmonic spacing of the SRS is vital when comparing observations with model \nresults.  The lower panel presents an analysis of the SRS signatures to determine the harmonic \nseparation of the SRS in order to facilitiate such a comparison with IAR models.  Here the averaged \nspectra in the upper panels are bandpass-filtered between 0.2 -1 Hz in the frequency domain, and \nthen subjected to an autocorrelation analysis.  This clearly illustrates the frequency separation of the \nSRS harmonics as a function of time.  Analysis of such polar cap data is ongoing, both in terms of \nnatural resonances of the IAR, and artificial stimulation experiments, as reported in section 3 below. \n \n3.  Artificial stimulation of the IAR \n \n3.1  The auroral zone \n \nFigure 4 presents a summary of the first 10 years experiments aimed at the generation of artificial \nmagnetic disturbances with the EISCAT heater.  The average amplitude of EISCAT heater-induced \nartificial magnetic disturbances as detected on ground magnetometers in the vicinity of the heater is \nplotted as a function of the modulation frequency of the RF power.  The induced signals are clearly \nstrongest at the lower end of the frequency range, but significant signals are also indicated in the \nfrequency range 1 -10 Hz, which covers the expected frequencies of the first few harmonics of the \nIAR. \n \nB\u00f6singer et al., (2000) reported on a series of experiments, using the high power RF facility at \nTroms\u00f8, designed to produce artificial magnetic pulsations in the frequency range of the lower \nharmonics of the IAR.  The experiments involved a stepwise sweep of the modulation frequency \nfrom approximately 0.1 to 3 Hz.  The results of one of these experiments are presented in Figure 5, \nwhere the artificial signal is clearly discernable above the background noise at frequencies of 1.5 -\n2.5 Hz, from 12:40 \u2013 12:55 UT.  Although the sequence of experiments were of variable success, on \none occasion a clear enhancement of power was observed in a narrow region of the modulation \nfrequency sweep, centred at 1.9 mHz.  This occurred at a time of day when IAR effects are \ngenerally clear, and was taken as evidence that the modulation frequency at 1.9 mHz was close to a \nnatural resonant frequency of the IAR, thus the response to the modulation was strongest at this \nfrequency, and the IAR was driven to resonance by the high power ionospheric modification \nexperiment. \n \nWhilst B\u00f6singer et al. (2000) investigated the ground magnetic signature of the IAR during \nartificial stimulation experiments, Cash et al. (2002) presented a quantitative analysis of the electric \nfield and particle flux data from the Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST, Carlson et al., 1998) spacecraft \nin order to investigate the in situ particles and fields in the IAR.  The spacecraft data were examined \nduring a transit of the spacecraft footprint over the ionosphere overlying the Troms\u00f8 heater during a \nmodulated X-mode heating experiment at 4.04 MHz, as described by Robinson et al., (2000).  The \nTroms\u00f8 heater was transmitting at high power with a 3 Hz modulation, and this resulted in the \nlaunch of Alfv\u00e9n waves from the lower ionosphere into the magnetosphere, allowing the first \nobservations of electron acceleration within the IAR.  Cash et al., (2002) established the time-\nevolution of the 3 Hz signals in the electric field, and the downgoing electron flux at 32.3, 64.7, and \n129.4 eV.  A clear dispersion was observed in the times of detection of the energetic electron \nsignals, which was demonstrated to be consistent with an electron acceleration region between 3250 \n 4 \nand 3550 km altitude.  A simple model of this acceleration region was developed in order to \ninvestigate the electron measurements on more detail.  The altitude variation of the accelerating \npotential above the FAST altitude (z1) was assumed to be \nt\nH\nzz\nztz \u03c9\u03d5\u03d5 cosexp)(),( 11 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212= , (4) \nwhere H is the characteristic height of the plasma density inhomogeneity and \u03c9 the angular \nfrequency of the 3 Hz wave.  As the time taken for the electrons to traverse this region is short \ncompared to the wave period, this potential was taken to be quasi-static, and would then shift the \nelectron energy distribution according to  \n)()( EEfEf \u0394+\u2192 , (5) \nwhere f(E) is the phase space density and \u0394E is the energy gained across the potential drop.  For a \nparticle distribution which follows a power law as  \nn\nE\nE\nEf\nEf\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\n00 )(\n)( , (6) \nwhere E0 is a constant, then the observed fluxes should be obtained by shifting the power law \nparticle distribution by \u0394E.  This process is detailed in Figure 6 for the three downgoing electron \nenergy channels measured by FAST, and for three observed peaks in the oscillating electron fluxes \nobserved during the experiment.  The values of \u0394E for each peak vary across the flux tube traversed \nby FAST in a fashion consistent with a potential with a horizontal Gaussian cross section of width \n~10 km, implying parallel electric field strengths of ~10-2 mVm-1 (Cash et al., 2002). \n \n3.2 The polar cap  \n \nWhilst well-established high power ionospheric modification facilities such as the EISCAT heater \nat Troms\u00f8 have demonstrated the ability to perform controlled active experiments on the IAR at \nauroral latitudes, as detailed in section 3.1, until recently it was not possible to do such experiments \nat higher latitudes on the polar cap.  SPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar) is a new \nhigh-power radar system located at 78.15\u00b0 N latitude, 16.05\u00b0 E longitude, located adjacent to the \nEISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) in the vicinity of Longyearbyen (Spitzbergen) and is designed to \ncarry out a range of space plasma investigations of the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere, \nincluding experiments to stimulate the IAR. The SPEAR antenna system comprises a 6\u00d74 array of \nfull-wave, crossed-dipoles, 16m above the ground, with an antenna spacing of 48.4m, allowing the \ntransmission of both linear and circularly polarised signals. The individual dipoles are rhombically \nbroadened to allow operation between 4 and 6 MHz. The resulting beam has a quasi-elliptical cross-\nsection, with an average half-power width of 21\u00b0 along its major axis and 14\u00b0 along its minor axis. \nThis results in an overall antenna gain of 21 dB.  During the operations reported here the complete \n6\u00d74 SPEAR array was available (48 transmitters), operating at 4.45 MHz. The transmitters were \noperated at 2kW, resulting in an ERP for SPEAR of ~ 15 MW.  On 2 December 2005, as recently \nreported by Scoffield et al. (2006), a modulated X-mode ionospheric modification experiment was \ncarried out at SPEAR, with the intention of artificially stimulating the Ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n \nResonator. A modulation frequency of 3 Hz was superimposed on a 20 minute on\/off cycle.  The \nmagnetic field changes due to this experiment were recorded on the nearby Barentsburg (BAR) \nstation of the University of Oulu pulsation magnetometer chain located at the Barentsburg \nObservatory of the Polar Geophysical Institute  \nData from the BAR magnetometer are presented in dynamic spectral form in for the H and D \ncomponent respectively in Figure 7 a and b. Each data point plotted represents the mean of 20 \nFourier spectra, created from consecutive, independent 25.6 second (1024 point) spectral windows \ncentred at that time. The slip distance between data points is 6.4 seconds (256 points). The \n 5 \nfrequency resolution of the dynamic spectra is 0.04 Hz. In order to draw out SRS features each \nspectrum was filtered in the frequency domain. The mean power of each spectrum was removed and \na Lanczos squared filter, with a high frequency cutoff of 1.0 Hz and a low frequency cutoff of 0.2 \nHz was used. The colour scale shows the Fourier power as a fraction of the maximum power \nobserved at 3 Hz during the interval. The bar at the top of Figure 7 and the vertical dashed lines \nindicate the times when SPEAR was turned on. The red shading of the bar indicates \u201con\u201d and the \nblue shading indicates \u201coff\u201d, with the intervals labelled 1 to 7. The horizontal white lines mark the \nfrequencies 2.9 Hz and 3.1 Hz where, if the ionospheric conditions are favourable, one might expect \nto see an enhancement in power at 3 Hz during the times when SPEAR is turned on (intervals 2, 4, \nand 6). Indeed there is an enhancement of the D component during interval 2 between 1800\u20131820 \nUT and also during interval 6 between 1920\u20131940 UT. During interval 4 (1840\u20131900 UT) the \nconditions become quite disturbed. No D component enhancement at 3 Hz is observed during this \ninterval, but such an enhancement is seen in the H component. These enhancements may indicate \nartificial stimulation of the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator at or near one of the harmonics of its \nresonant frequency. During interval 4 the IMAGE magnetometer data show a disturbance in the \ngeomagnetic field at all stations, indicative of substorm activity. It is possible that the polarization \nof the oscillation is related to the background ionospheric electric fields, which have been altered by \nthe disturbed conditions during intervals 3\u20135. The magnetic field changes measured by IMAGE \nindicate a transient rotation of the ionospheric electric field during intervals 3\u20135, as a westward \nelectrojet is established.  \n \n4.  Summary \n \nAlthough first proposed some 30 years ago, by Polyakov (1976), and confirmed observationally a \ndecade later by Belyaev et al. (1987), the existence of the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator at high \nlatitudes was only confirmed by Belyaev et al. (1999).  The upper boundary of the IAR, where the \nAlfv\u00e9n velocity profile reaches a maximum, is a region where electron energisation occurs, and thus \nholds important information on the physical processes involved in magnetosphere-ionosphere \ncoupling and auroral particle acceleration. Since the first detection of the IAR considerable progress \nhas been made in characterising and understanding the IAR, both in the auroral zone and the polar \ncap.  A combination of pulsation magnetometer data and modelling have established the basic \nmorphology of the IAR, and how it is controlled by the dimensions, boundary conditions and \nplasma density of the resonant cavity.  Recent improvements in high latitude instrumentation will \nlead to further improvements in our understanding of this important magnetospheric region.  Recent \ndevelopments in active experiments designed to stimulate the IAR offer a new insight into the \nstructure and physical processes of the IAR.  Combined with spacecraft data such experiments offer \nthe chance to explore the role of the IAR in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes and \nauroral particle acceleration. \n \nAcknowledgments.  \n \nSPEAR is supported by PPARC grant PP\/E002544\/1, HCS and LJB are supported by PPARC grant \nPPA\/G\/O\/2003\/00013.
