I suggest \nthat in this aim, intuition is, necessarily, an intimate research method.  Rather than apply \nBergson\u201fs argument to this area of social research, I examine the resonances between his \nphilosophical method and moves within social research to attend to the performativity, \ncreativity or inventiveness of research methods.  With a focus on my own research, which \nexplored the relations between thirteen girls\u201f bodies and images from a feminist-\nDeleuzian position, I argue here that the interconnected issues of becoming, uniqueness \nand coincidence that Bergson raises connect with concerns in social research about \nontology, concepts and methods.  In particular, I suggest that relationality is crucial to \nthese connections.  Drawing through the significance of relations, I argue that intimate, \nintuitive research is desirable because of the ethics that it opens up and enables; ethics \nwhich are intimate in their attention to the becoming unique to the object at stake in \nresearch and in their attempt to coincide with this uniqueness.   \n \nKeywords \nIntuition; relationality; ethics; bodies; images \n 2 \nWord count \n8697 \n \nBiographical note \nRebecca Coleman is a lecturer in the Department of Media, Film and Cultural Studies, \nLancaster University.  She is currently extending research on bodies and images through \na project on weight, temporality and visual technologies, with a particular focus on hope, \ndieting and practices of measurement. \n--- \n \n \nTo try to fit a concept on an object is simply to ask what we can do with the \nobject, and what it can do for us. To label an object with a certain concept is to \nmask in precise terms the kind of action or attitude the object should suggest to us \n(Bergson, 1912\/1999: 39). \n \nThe method of intuition explored in this article is one which emphasises the relations \nbetween social researcher(s) and researched, subjects and objects, bodies and images.  It \nis also a method which highlights, necessarily I suggest, the ways in which intimacy \nmight be produced through these research relations.  My exploration of intuition emerges \nout of an empirical research project in which I explored the relations between the bodies \nof thirteen 13 and 14 year old girls and images (see Coleman, forthcoming) but my \ndiscussion of the ways in which intuition might be an appropriate method for this project \n 3 \nintersects with a more general series of moves concerned with metaphysics, ontology and \nperformativity currently being worked out in social research.  The relations between \n(young) women\u201fs bodies and images is an area of central importance to contemporary \nfeminist theoretical and empirical studies concerned with such wide-ranging issues as \nfemininity (Gill and Arthurs, 2006), sexualisation (Gill, 2003), post-feminism and neo-\nliberalism (McRobbie, 2004), eating disorders and \u201ebody-hatred\u201f (Frost, 2001) and the \ninfluence of popular media on how girls and young women feel about their bodies \n(Grogan, 1999; Grogan and Wainwright, 1996; Duke, 2000; Durham, 1999; see also \nColeman, 2008)1.  My research, however, approached this area from a feminist Deleuzian \nperspective and, in particular, explored bodies as becomings.  That is, rather than \nunderstand bodies and images in terms of a distinction between subjects and objects, my \nresearch suggested that the girls\u201f bodies become through images.  Or, put another way, \nmy research focused on the relations of becoming between the girls\u201f bodies and images, \nnot as traversing a \u201egap\u201f between pre-existent bodies\/subjects and images\/objects but as \nproducing the bodies and images.  This focus on relationality and becoming is central to \nthe argument I make here regarding the method of intuition, and the relationship between \nintuition and intimacy. \n \nIntuition is a method2 developed through Henri Bergson\u201fs discussion in An Introduction \nto Metaphysics3 (1999) of \u201etwo profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. The first \nimplies that we move round the object; the second that we enter into it\u201f (1999: 21).  \nBergson\u201fs argument is, for me, compelling in its conviction that the only way to know a \nthing is to \u201eenter into it\u201f intuitively. However, it is unclear how such a method, developed \n 4 \nphilosophically, might work as and for social research.  My argument here is that the \n\u201eenter[ing] into\u201f an object in order to know it is a method of \u201egetting close to\u201f, or intimate \nwith, a research object.  An intuitive method, I suggest, is a relation of intimacy between \nthe researcher(s) and researched in which the dichotomy between subject\/object, \nbody\/image is reconceived.  As I will discuss, \u201eenter[ing] into\u201f is not a method \ndetermined by researcher(s).  Instead, intimacy is relational, that is, is produced through \nthe relations between things.  The \u201eentering into\u201f the object that a method of intuition \nimplies is a relation of intimacy between the researcher(s) and researched, indeed, the \nrelation of intimacy produces the researcher(s) and researched.   \n \nIn this article, then, intimacy is understood to refer not so much to research topics that \nmight be considered intimate (\u201ethe familiar spaces of friendship, love, sex, family and \nfeeling \u201cat home\u201d [Berlant, 2000], for example), nor to how researchers might feel \nintimate with their fields of research (it is not, for example, that researchers should only \ninvestigate the areas with which they feel \u201eat home\u201f).  While intimacy in research may \nwell emerge in these two ways, I suggest that intimacy is produced through methods of \nknowing an object intuitively.  Intimacy is not to be found in an area of research and \nneither is intimacy inherent to a particular research topic.  Rather, understood as and \nthrough intuition, intimacy is a research relation, a method, in the most open sense of the \nterm.  As such, a method of intuition does not \u201euncover\u201f intimacies but invent ways of \nbecoming intimate with objects of research.  This article reflects on the invention of \nintimacy through considering a number of inter-connected issues that are raised by a \nmethod of intuition.  The method of intuition that Bergson outlines is, as I have noted, \n 5 \ndeveloped as a philosophical method.  My intention here is not to apply Bergson\u201fs \nphilosophical method to social research but rather to explore the resonances between my \nresearch \u2013 carried out through taking seriously and putting to work Deleuzian concepts \u2013 \nand Bergson\u201fs (1999) argument.  This exploration is in the context of debate within social \nresearch concerning the ways in which research methods should be considered as \nperformative (for example, Law, 2004; Law and Urry, 2004) or creative (Massumi, 2002) \nof the social realities being investigated.  In focusing on the invention of research \nrelations, this article is also concerned with the relevance of philosophical enquiry into \nthe metaphysical and ontological to social research.  \n \nThe article is focused on three interconnected issues that a method of intuition raises: (i) \nmovement, or becoming; (ii) uniqueness and; (iii) coincidence.  These \u201ephilosophical\u201f \nissues, I suggest, have implications for social research in three ways: (i) movement or \nbecoming raises questions of the ontology of social research; (ii) uniqueness raises \nquestions of the production of concepts in social research and; (iii) coincidence, or the \ncoinciding with an object in order to know it, raises questions for social research method. \nCentral to my argument is a consideration of the relationship between intuition, invention \nand ethics and I conclude the article by suggesting, through Deleuze\u201fs (1970\/1988) \nreading of Spinoza, that intuitive research is ethical in its coincidence with the uniqueness \nof the movement of an object.  Ethics, therefore, are inventive; that is, ethics are not \n(only) a set of pre-existent conventions and obligations into which research relations can \nbe fitted, but rather ethics emerge \u2013 become \u2013 through the relations between and \nconstitutive of researcher(s) and researched.   \n 6 \nBodies, images, becoming \nAs briefly outlined above, the research at stake in this article explored the relations \nbetween bodies and images as becomings.  It is important to note that this exploration \nwas through a feminist Deleuzian perspective and its methodology developed concepts \nand arguments that can be located within Deleuze\u201fs work and within feminist theory \nmore general.  As such, the philosophical arguments made by Bergson which are in focus \nhere did not constitute the methodology that was followed through in the research.4  It is \nperhaps especially important to recognise this in terms of ways in which bodies and \nimages are discussed here.  The starting point of my research was a concern with bodies \nand embodiment and the research explored the ways in which bodies become through \nimages.  This might seem at odds with the Bergsonian approach I take here, as, for \nBergson, a body is an image (see Matter and Memory 1908\/2002).  It might be suggested, \nthen, that while a Bergsonian approach to the research might be that bodies are images, \nmy approach is that images are bodies.  While I do not want to play down the differences \nbetween these two approaches \u2013 indeed examining the research through Bergson\u201fs \nmethod of intuition produces the possibility that the research was also (or instead?) \nconcerned with how images become bodies \u2013 what I am intending to emphasise here is \nthe inextricable connection between bodies and images.  Bergson\u201fs argument concerning \nintuition as method is a means of thinking through in more detail some of the \nmethodological implications of the conceptual moves made in the research.   \n \nThe girls who participated in the research came from two schools, one in south east \nLondon and one in Oxfordshire, were self-selecting, and were white.  Drawing on the \n 7 \ndifferent kinds of interviews the research involved (focus groups, individual interviews \nand an \u201eimage-making\u201f session), and on a Deleuzian ontology of becoming \u2013 where \n\u201ethings\u201f are not separate but inextricably linked and, moreover, are constituted through \nthese connections (see for example Deleuze and Guattari, 1987; Deleuze, 1992) \u2013 I \nargued that underpinning much (but not all) feminist work on the relations between \n(young) women\u201fs bodies and images is a framework of subject(ivity)\/object(ivity) where \nbodies and images are mapped on to a prior distinction between subjects and objects and, \nas such, are conceived as mutually different and incompatible entities.  This framework \nof subject(ivity)\/object(ivity) has also been challenged by feminist work in this area for \nits problematic rendering of women\u201fs bodies as discrete from images.  Feminist work on \nvisual culture, for example, has argued that in contemporary culture, where images of \nwomen\u201fs bodies are pervasive, it is difficult, if not impossible, to define where women\u201fs \nbodies begin and images end; as Mary Ann Doane suggests, \u201e[f]or the female spectator \nthere is a certain over-presence of the image \u2013 she is the image\u201f (1992: 231, see also \nBetterton, 1987, 1996; Pollock, 1987; Mulvey, 1989; Stacey, 1994; Coleman, \nforthcoming).  One of the consequences of this blurring of the distinction between \nwomen\u201fs bodies and images is that feminist work has also argued that, for women, access \nto full or secure subjecthood is unattainable and that the subject\/object distinction is an \ninherently masculine one. \n \nAlthough the subject(ivitiy)\/object(ivity) dichotomy has clearly been at issue in feminist \nwork on the relations between women\u201fs bodies and images, I argued that it is not \ndislodged altogether. It is blurred, but it remains a central organising principle of \n 8 \nconceptions of bodies and images.  In ontological terms, the subject(ivity)\/ object(ivity) \nframework can be understood as grounded in Being, that is, as Deleuze and Guattari \n(1987) put it, an ontology organised by binary oppositions and concerned with form \n(\u201ebeing\u201f one or other, for example).  Deleuze and Guattari propose an alternative \nontology of becoming where things are constantly transforming, not from one thing into \nanother but as beginning-less and endless processes of change (Deleuze and Guattari, \n1987: 277).  As may be clear, the emphasis a Deleuzian approach puts on \u201ethe in-\nbetween\u201f has been important to my research.  Shifting from a concern with \u201ebeing\u201f or \n\u201eforms\u201f (bodies, images, subjects, objects) to becoming involved focusing on the \nrelations between the bodies of the girls who participated in my research and the images \nthat were significant to them.  Indeed, my research argued that the girls\u201f bodies become \nthrough their relations with images and that, therefore, it is these relations that define, or, \nbetter, create or invent, the girls\u201f bodies. In the rest of this article I want to pull through \nthis interest in relations, and explore it more thoroughly in methodological terms.   \n \nAnalysis and intuition \nBergson (1999) explains the distinction he makes between knowing a thing through either \nmoving around it or entering into it in terms of a difference between a method of analysis \nand a method of intuition.  Analysis \u201edepends on the point of view at which we are placed \nand on the symbols by which we express ourselves\u201f (1999: 21).  That is, analysis begins \nfrom a position outside of the thing and understands that thing through a system of \ninterpretation.  In distinction, Bergson proposes intuition, a method of knowing a thing \nthat \u201eneither depends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol\u201f (1999: 21).  He argues \n 9 \nthat whereas \u201e[t]he first kind of knowledge may be said to stop at the relative; the second, \nin those cases where it is possible, to attain the absolute\u201f (1999: 21).  Using the example \nof \u201ethe movement of an object in space\u201f, in the following passage Bergson outlines what \nhe means by \u201erelative\u201f and \u201eabsolute\u201f and how the methods of analysis and intuition \napproach and \u201eknow\u201f the thing differently: \n \nMy perception of the motion will vary with the point of view, moving or \nstationary, from which I observe it. My expression of it will vary with the system \nof axes, or the points of reference, to which I relate it; that is, with the symbols by \nwhich I translate it. For this reason I call such a motion relative: in the one case, \nas in the other, I am placed outside the object itself. But when I speak of absolute \nmovement, I am attributing to the moving object an interior and, so to speak, \nstates of mind; I also imply that I am in sympathy with those states, and that I \ninsert myself in them by an effort of imagination. Then, according as the object is \nmoving or stationary, according as it adopts one movement or another, what I will \nexperience will vary (Bergson, 1999: 21). \n \nBy \u201erelative\u201f, then, Bergson means to draw attention to what he sees as the limits of \nknowing a thing from a position \u201eoutside the object itself\u201f. Knowing the motion of an \nobject as it moves through space is relative in two ways; in terms of both the position of \nobservation, which results in varying perceptions, and the expression, which emerge not \nfrom the object itself but from an external \u201esystem of axes, or [\u2026] points of reference\u201f.5  \n 10 \nAs such, the movement of the thing is not appreciated from the thing\u201fs point of view, nor \nexpressed through the thing itself.   \n \nIn contrast, \u201eabsolute\u201f refers to a way of knowing the movement of an object through \nspace \u201efrom within\u201f, from a position, as Bergson goes on to write, \u201einside the object \nitself\u201f (1999: 21).  It refers to the experience of the movement of the object itself, an \nexperience which is absolute or \u201eoriginal\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 21), and which rejects an \nexternal observational point of view and framework of translation.  The object is \n\u201egraspe[d]\u201f and experienced \u201efrom where it is, from within, as it is in itself\u201f (Bergson, \n1999: 22: my emphasis).  Such a way of knowing the absolute movement of an object is \npossible, Bergson suggests, through being (or rather becoming) \u201ein sympathy with\u201f the \nobject, through the \u201einsertion\u201f into the object \u201eby an effort of imagination\u201f.  Bergson \nexpands on what such an effort of imagination might involve by explaining the methods \nof intuition and analysis.  Arguing that \u201ean absolute could only be given in an intuition, \nwhilst everything else falls within the province of analysis\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 23), he \nwrites: \n \nBy intuition is meant a kind of intellectual sympathy by which one places oneself \nwithin an object in order to coincide with what is unique in it and consequently \ninexpressible. Analysis, on the contrary, is the operation which reduces the object \nto elements already known, that is to elements common both to it and to other \nobjects. To analyse, therefore, is to express a thing as a function of something \nother than itself. All analysis is thus a translation, a development into symbols, a \n 11 \nrepresentation taken from successive points of view from which we note as many \nresemblances as possible between the new object which we are studying and \nothers which we believe we already know (Bergson, 1999: 23-24). \n \nAnalysis begins with a system of expression in which the object is \u201ealready known\u201f and \nthe object is thus \u201ereduce[d]\u201f to its \u201eresemblance\u201f to other objects, \u201ewhich we believe we \nalready know\u201f, and is \u201etranslat[ed]\u201f, \u201edevelop[ed] into symbols\u201f or portrayed as \u201ea \nrepresentation\u201f.  The problem of translation, then, as indicated in Bergson\u201fs discussion of \nabsolute versus relative knowledge, is the problem of thinking that objects can already be \nknown (from a position outside of them) and, consequently, the expression of the objects \nin terms which are not \u201ein sympathy with\u201f the object as it is in itself.  Symbols, in this \nsense, are a form of representation which are removed from the object itself, which exist \nexternally to the object at stake and which can be applied to any object regardless of its \n\u201euniqueness\u201f.  The project of translating, symbolising, representing the objects, in \nBergson\u201fs words, \u201emultiplies without end the number of points of view in order to \ncomplete its always incomplete representation, and ceaselessly varies its symbols that is \nmay perfect the always imperfect translation. It goes on therefore to infinity\u201f (Bergson, \n1999: 24).   \n \nWhat might a method of intuition do? \nBergson\u201fs distinction between and discussion of methods of analysis and intuition is \nclearly intricate and multifaceted.  In the rest of this article I consider in more detail some \nof the implications of his suggestion that an object can only be known through coinciding \n 12 \nwith the uniqueness of its movement.  Such a proposition raises the notions of movement, \nor becoming, uniqueness, or \u201ein-itself-ness\u201f, and coincidence, or \u201esympathy with\u201f, as \nimportant philosophical issues.  However, I suggest that these issues raise questions not \nonly for philosophical knowledge but also for the ways in which social research might \nknow an object.  In this section I follow through the questions that these issues raise for \nresearch ontologies, concepts and methods.  In particular, I concentrate on how \nrelationality is integral to each of these research issues.  My discussion of these questions \nthrough a focus on feminist social research on the relations between (young) women\u201fs \nbodies and images is not to suggest that this area, more than others, should consider the \nsignificance of a method of intuition.  Neither is it to establish an antagonism between \ntendencies within such research and what might be considered intuitive research.  Rather, \nis to begin to think through how intuitive research might work in practice by reflecting \non, and situating my argument within, my own research intimacies. \n \nAn ontology of movement \nBergson argues that absolute movement will only be \u201egiven\u201f by the intuitive method.  \nIntuition is not to reduce the object to what we believe to be its resemblance with other \nobjects, but rather is \u201eto coincide with what it unique in it and consequently \ninexpressible\u201f.  Whereas analysis begins with \u201eelements in common\u201f, intuition assumes \nthat objects are \u201eunique\u201f and \u201einexpressible\u201f.  This is an important point, and one which \nhas, potentially, many implications for social research.  Indeed, I argue, drawing on \ncommentators on Bergson\u201fs philosophy (Mullarkey, 1999; Worms, 1999; Deleuze, 2002; \nGuerlac, 2006), that Bergson\u201fs notion of intuition produces not only an alternative \n 13 \nmethod but also an alternative ontology.  It is, for instance, no accident that the example \nthrough which Bergson explicates the difference between intuition and analysis is the \nmovement of an object in space.  What is important to note here is that this example \nemphasises not an object in space, nor an object in space, nor how an object is moved in \nspace.  The emphasis here is on the movement of an object in space.  This emphasis is \nimportant to recognise because Bergson\u201fs philosophy is underpinned by an ontology of \nmovement, transformation and process.  The example that Bergson discusses, then, and \nhis method of intuition, is designed to draw attention to how the object in space is not a \nstatic or inert entity, or form, but is always moving, is always becoming.  Such an \nontology of becoming is an understanding of the world as fundamentally dynamic.  In \nterms of Bergson\u201fs object, it is not that, in moving, the object changes from one fixed \nthing to another fixed thing (which is what an ontology of being might assume).  Instead \nit is that what constitutes or characterises the object, what the object is, is movement; the \nobject is (always) becoming.   \n \nI have outlined above that my research worked through an ontology of becoming rather \nthan being and I have discussed how this involved an understanding of relationality as \nproductive rather than as emanating from one pre-existent thing (a subject or an object for \nexample) to another.  In its shift to an ontology of becoming, my research critiqued the \nargument that there is a causal relationship between, for example, popular media images \non the one hand, and girls\u201f and young women\u201fs bodies on the other.  Such an argument \nwas made by the Body Image Summit, held by the British government in June 2000 to \ninvestigate and intervene in the links between images in media and fashion industries and \n 14 \nan increase in girls and women involved in practices of dieting, eating disorders, self \nharm and generally feeling unhappy with their bodies.6  The Summit concluded that, \nwhile not wholly responsible for these trends, the overwhelming depiction of (young) \nwomen\u201fs bodies as thin, young, white, healthy and beautiful in popular media and fashion \nimages are a significant factor in the pressure to be thin that young women in particular \nencounter.  One solution to this problem, the Summit argued, was to replace \u201eimpossible\u201f \nimages of women\u201fs bodies with a greater range and diversity.  Such an argument is also \ncommonly made by academic feminism, for example, from a social psychology \nperspective, Sarah Grogan and Nicola Wainwright (1996) suggest \u201e[i]t is a matter of \nconcern that the images presented in teen magazines present such a restricted range of \nmodels for young women. If women\u201fs body image can be bolstered by alternative sources \nof information, they may be more resilient against influences such as teen magazines, \nbecause young women who grow up with a more positive body image are less likely to be \naffected by cultural messages\u201f (1996: 672).   \n \nIn working through an ontology of becoming, it is clear that such arguments are made \npossible through an ontology of being and a framework of subject\/object whereby \n(young) women\u201fs bodies are conceived as entities (subjects) which are necessarily \nseparate from and different to images (objects).  Such a framework casts the relations \nbetween bodies and images as linear and causal; \u201ebad\u201f or \u201eimpossible\u201f popular media or \nfashion images are the causes of \u201ebad\u201f or \u201eunhealthy\u201f bodies.  Following through the \nontological basis of Bergson\u201fs method of intuition, however, suggests that (young) \nwomen\u201fs bodies and images can be understood differently, not as static and discrete \n 15 \nentities but as constantly changing processes of becoming.  In particular, I suggest, an \nontology of becoming fundamentally re-conceives the relations between bodies and \nimages.  Relations are not causal, nor do they traverse the gap between a pre-formed \nbody\/subject on one hand and an image\/object on the other.  Rather, these bodies and \nimages become through the relations between them.  Relations of becoming are therefore \nproductive of \u201ethings\u201f rather than produced by things.  In the case of my research, popular \nmedia and fashion images are not separate from, and therefore do not effect bodies, but \nrather the girls\u201f bodies become through their relations with images. \n \nThe uniqueness of concepts   \nThe ontology of becoming discussed so far is crucial in order to understand intuition.  Put \nsimply, an ontology of movement assumes that the object is unique in its becoming and \ntherefore can only be conceived through this unique becoming and not through a pre-\nexistent system of symbols and translations.  Uniqueness in Bergson\u201fs sense attends not \nonly to the difference of objects but also to the relations between the difference of \nobjects.  For example, Bergson describes \u201etrue intuition\u201f as an empiricism \u201ewhich \nproposes to get as near to the original itself as possible, to search deeply into its life, and \nso, by a kind of intellectual auscultation, to feel the throbbings of its soul\u201f (Bergson, \n1999: 36-37).  This task of empiricism, he goes on to write, \u201eis an extremely difficult one, \nfor none of the ready-made conceptions which thought employs in its daily operations \ncan be of any use\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 37).  Such an empiricism, \n \n 16 \ncuts out for the object a concept which is appropriate to that object alone, a \nconcept which can as yet hardly be called a concept, since it applies only to this \none thing. It does not proceed by combining current ideas [\u2026]; but it leads us, on \nthe contrary to a simple, unique representation, which, however once formed, \nenables us to understand easily how it is that we can place it in the frames [\u2026] all \nmuch larger than itself (Bergson, 1999: 37). \n \nHere, Bergson explains that the concept the empirical method of intuition \u201ecuts out\u201f for \nthe object is unique in that it \u201eis appropriate to that object alone\u201f.  In this sense, the \nunique concept is grasping the object \u201eas it is in itself\u201f.  However, and further, the unique \nconcept is in a relational field with other concepts.  From a \u201eunique intuition\u201f of one \nobject, \u201ewe can descend with equal ease to different concepts\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 37), we \ncan \u201eplace\u201f the unique intuition \u201ein the frames [all] much larger than itself\u201f.   \n \nBergson\u201fs \u201eunique intuition\u201f, then, which not only distinguishes one object from others \nbut also connects it to them, is close to the notion of \u201esingularity\u201f developed in the work \nof, for example, Brian Massumi (2002).  Massumi explains singularity through an \n\u201eexemplary\u201f method, distinguished from a method of \u201eapplication\u201f.  \u201eIf you apply a \nconcept or system of concepts\u201f, he suggests, \u201eit is the material you apply it to that \nundergoes change much more markedly than do the concepts. The change is imposed \nupon the material by the concepts\u201f systematicity and constitutes a becoming homologous \nof the material to the system\u201f (Massumi, 2002: 17).  Massumi\u201fs comments here can be \nunderstood in light of Bergson\u201fs distinction between analysis and intuition.  Analysis \n 17 \ninvolves a concept or system of concepts being \u201eimposed upon\u201f material; the concept(s) \n\u201efit\u201f the material into its system and, therefore, changes the material rather than the \nconcepts.  And, the method of examples, with its emphasis on the uniqueness of the \nobject, has similarities with Bergson\u201fs method of intuition, whereby the example is \n\u201eneither general [\u2026] nor particular\u201f but \u201esingular\u201f (Massumi, 2002: 17); unique.  Indeed, \nat another point, Massumi writes in a discussion of colour, \u201e[b]y \u201csingular\u201d is meant \n\u201cincomparable\u201d\u201f (Massumi, 2002: 162): \u201eThe singular is without model and without \nresemblance. It resembles only itself. In this precise and restricted sense, what is actually \nseen is absolute: \u201ccomparable only to itself\u201d (Massumi, 2002, 163).  However, as \nMassumi goes on to suggest, while what is seen of colour is comparable only to itself, \n\u201e[w]hat is singular about colour is the relationality of its ever-varying appearing\u201f \n(Massumi, 2002: 163).  The singularity of colour, its \u201ein-itself-ness\u201f or uniqueness, is \nrelational, produced and \u201eknown\u201f not in its resemblance to other things but through its \nemergence or becoming through its relations with other singularities; \u201eAs anyone who has \never dressed himself [sic] knows, \u201cwe judge colours by the company they keep\u201d\u201f \n(Massumi, 2002: 163).   \n \nTaken as singularity, the uniqueness of an object which Bergson points to is what is \n\u201einteresting\u201f (Massumi, 2002: 84) about it \u2013 is what should be coincided with \u2013 but what \nis also \u201esimultaneously an extendibility to everything else with which it might be \nconnected\u201f (Massumi, 2002: 17).  The uniqueness of an object, then, sets it apart and also \nconnects it with other objects through its relations with them.  One way in which the \nfeminist research explored here might be understood, then, is in terms of its knowledge of \n 18 \nthe relations between bodies and images through a pre-existent and external system of \nconcepts.  The subject\/object dichotomy, for example, onto which bodies and images are \nmapped, emerges not through the uniqueness of the object at stake but is a framework \ninto which the object is fitted.  The relations between girls\u201f bodies and images are not \n\u201eunique\u201f, in Bergson\u201fs sense, but \u201ealready known\u201f; girls\u201f and young women\u201fs bodies are \neither vulnerable to and easily effected by impossible images in popular media and \nfashion, or not.  There is no other way of explaining the possible relations between bodies \nand images.  In Massumi\u201fs words, the concept is \u201eimposed on\u201f the material and the \nmaterial undergoes change rather than the concept.   \n \nAs Bergson suggests, the empiricism he proposes is difficult because \u201e[t]hinking usually \nconsists in passing from concepts to things, and not from things to concepts\u201f (Bergson, \n1999: 38).  It is difficult, therefore, to consider how social research might \u201ecut out\u201f \n\u201eunique concepts\u201f \u2013 unique in their emergence through the specific movement of the \nobject and in their connection with other objects.  In holding in suspension the ways in \nwhich the relations between girls\u201f bodies and images are thought to be \u201ealready known\u201f, \nmy research might be understood as attempting to engage in the production of unique \nconcepts.  This involved, for example, not presuming what images the girls would \nconsider most important to their experiences of bodies and asking them to think about \nand explore what \u201eimages\u201f meant to them.  As well as popular media images emerging as \nimportant, other images such as those produced through people\u201fs comments about their \nbodies, mirror images in shops and at home, glimpses in car windows, were also made \nevident.  As such, the concepts that were produced in this research involved relationality \n 19 \n(it was the relations with images through which bodies become that were significant \nrather than the bodies\/subjects and images\/objects themselves), affect (how were bodies \nand images in relations of affect, rather than how did images effect bodies?) and intensity \n(how were certain relations between bodies and images more intense than others?).  \nWhile these concepts can clearly be attributed to a Deleuzian approach which prioritises \nbecoming, they also attend to the uniqueness of the becomings of the girls\u201f bodies \nthrough images.  For instance, in producing concepts which attend to relationality, affect \nand intensity, the relations between the girls\u201f bodies and images were understood as \nspecific and particular but also as fundamentally connected with other relations.  \n \nCoinciding with an object \nBergson argues that the movement or becoming of an object is known through coinciding \nwith its uniqueness; becomings are unique and can only be known through this \nuniqueness.  One way to understand the coincidence of research with the uniqueness of \nan object is through Deleuze\u201fs (2002) discussion of Bergson\u201fs method of intuition, and in \nparticular the first \u201erule\u201f he identifies concerning \u201ethe stating and creating of problems\u201f \n(2002: 14).  Deleuze argues that the method of intuition shifts philosophical attention \nfrom solutions to problems.  Analysis is a method in which solutions are prioritised; \nsymbols, for example, can be understood to be a pre-occupation with \u201esolving\u201f the \nproblem of the object at stake in that they (i) exist in advance of the object and (ii) can \nincorporate any object into their system of translation and representation.  Intuition, on \nthe other hand, is a method in which a problem must be encountered and correctly posed.  \nEncountering and correctly posing a problem through intuition refers to how the object of \n 20 \nresearch may not be, or may not involve, the problem which analysis believes it to be or \nto have in advance.  Finding and correctly stating a problem is, for Deleuze, a \u201etrue \nfreedom\u201f rather than a task which is always-already determined.  This means that \nproblems must be created or invented:  \n \nInvention gives being to what did not exist; it might never have happened. \nAlready in mathematics, and still more in metaphysics, the effort of invention \nconsists most often in raising the problem, in creating the terms in which it will be \nstated. The stating and solving of the problem are here very close to being \nequivalent: The truly great problems are set forth only when they are solved\u201f \n(Bergson quoted in Deleuze, 2002: 15-16).   \n \nFinding and stating the problem correctly provides the terms in which the solution will \nemerge, as Deleuze argues: \u201ethe problem always has the solution it deserves, in terms of \nthe way in which it is stated (i.e., the conditions under which it is determined as \nproblem), and of the means and terms at our disposal for stating it\u201f (2002: 16).  In \ncoinciding with what is unique in an object then, and in understanding this uniqueness in \nterms of movement or becoming, problems must not be presumed in advance.  That is, in \norder to grasp the uniqueness of the becoming of an object, as it is in itself, problems \nmust be invented in and through coinciding with that object.  Inventing problems, as \nDeleuze suggests, \u201egives being to what did not exist\u201f; correctly stated problems are \nnecessary to, but cannot exist prior to, coincidence with the object.   \n \n 21 \nIn attempting to correctly state a problem through the coincidence with an object, \nfeminist research on the relations between bodies and images must suspend what it \nbelieves it \u201ealready knows\u201f.  For example, intuitive research would not know in advance \nwhat images are important to girls\u201f and young women\u201fs experiences of their bodies \nthrough images or the relations between them; images are not necessarily popular media \nimages and do not necessarily effect bodies in negative or damaging ways.  Instead, and \nin suspending such assumptions, research coincides with the uniqueness of the relations \nand correctly states a research problem.  For research on the relations between bodies and \nimages, developing visual methods might be one way of attempting this coincidence with \nthe object.  Indeed, visual methods are a feature of much feminist empirical research; \nGrogan and Wainwright (1996), for example, used pictures of food cut from magazines \nto focus the girls involved in their interviews and other projects similarly use visual \nstimulants in interviews and focus groups (for example Duke, 2000; Durham, 1999).  \nHowever, visual methods in social research might also extend from stimulants for the \nproduction of verbal-based data to involve the production of image- or visual-based data.  \n \nIn my own research where the object at stake was the relations between a number of \nwhite British teenage girls\u201f bodies and images, I attempted to incorporate images into the \nresearch itself through an image-making session.  Given the research had examined what \nkinds of images the girls experienced as important to their knowledges and \nunderstandings of images in focus group and individual interviews, I was interested in \nexploring what kinds of images the girls might create.  The images the girls created \nassembled Polaroid photographs, sweet wrappers, craft material, make-up and magazine \n 22 \nimages and suggest, I argued, that bodies constituted through multiple and diverse \nimages.  Understood in terms of a method of intuition, I was asking the girls to attempt to \nrender their bodies as images and not to \u201etranslate\u201f their bodies into \u201esymbols\u201f or \n\u201erepresentations\u201f.  As such, the understanding of images as \u201erepresentations\u201f of bodies \nwhich is central to arguments such as those proposed by the Body Image Summit, is also \nchallenged; a representational model of images is replaced with an understanding of \nimages as part of, or better constitutive of, bodies.  In this sense, I was attempting to \ncoincide with the uniqueness of the object of research not only in the questions I asked in \ninterviews about experiences of bodies through images but also through the methods \nthemselves.   \n \nWhy might social research want to be(come) intuitive?   \nIn exploring Bergson\u201fs method of intuition in more detail, and in considering the ways in \nwhich movement, uniqueness and coincidence resonate with and contribute to questions \nof ontology, concepts and methods, a number of questions are raised for how intuition \nmight be practised as social research.  These include, although are not restricted to: How \nmight research become with the movement of an object?  How might research produce \nconcepts unique in their peculiarity and relationality?  How might research methods \ncoincide with an object? Assembled together these questions indicate for social research \nthe need to move, transform, become with the unfolding of the object at stake. I would \nsuggest that not only does this require inventive research problems, methods and \nconcepts, but that it also changes what social research might be(come).  For example, \nintuitive research makes it difficult to see research as having predictable aims, procedures \n 23 \nor outcomes as research, and the effects that it might be hoped to have, is understood to \nbe produced through the becoming of the object itself.  For example, the aims and \nsolutions of projects such as the Body Image Summit to investigate and intervene in \nrelations it believes it already knows are questioned.  Does this change social research \nwhich has, since its emergence, had a close relationship with desire for social change?  If \nso, in what ways?  Of what use can intuitive social research be?  These questions, of \ncourse, have many different potential answers.  The way in which I want to address some \nof the concerns raised is to turn now to the ethics of intuitive research and suggest that \nunderstanding ethics as becoming might open up possibilities of doing research and of \nknowing things.  \n \nThe notion of ethics on which I am drawing here comes, fittingly, from Deleuze\u201fs (1978, \n1988) reading of Spinoza7 and the distinction Deleuze argues that Spinoza makes \nbetween ethics and morality.  Not only is this fitting in that, for Deleuze, Spinoza along \nwith Bergson is a key figure in the \u201ecounter history\u201f of philosophy (Tomlinson and \nHabberjam, 1988: 7), but also because the distinction between ethics and morality echoes \nthe distinction Bergson makes between intuition and analysis. Deleuze summarises this \n\u201efundamental difference between Ethics and Morality\u201f (1978: 9) as such: \n \nSpinoza doesn\u201ft make up a morality, for a very simple reason: he never asks what \nwe must do, he always asks what we are capable of, what\u201fs in our power, ethics is \na problem of power, never a problem of duty. In this sense Spinoza is profoundly \nimmoral. Regarding the moral problem, good and evil, he has a happy nature \n 24 \nbecause he doesn\u201ft even comprehend what this means. What he comprehends are \ngood encounters, bad encounters, increases and diminutions of power. Thus he \nmakes an ethics and not at all a morality (Deleuze, 1978: 9). \n \nDeleuze (1988) argues that Spinoza makes a shift from a system of Good-Evil to good-\nbad.  An act is not inherently Evil but rather is a bad encounter through which the \naffective capacities or power of a body are limited or diminished.  Good, or rather a good \nencounter, is \u201ewhen a body directly compounds its relation with ours, and, with all or part \nof its power, increases ours\u201f (Deleuze, 1988: 22).  A good encounter, then, is a relation \nbetween one body and another (a girl\u201fs body and an image for example) whereby the \npossibilities of becoming are extended (Coleman, forthcoming).   \n \nWhereas Good-Evil is a system of Morality, good-evil is ethical: \n \nEthics, which is to say, a typology of immanent modes of existence, replaces \nMorality, which always refers existence to transcendent values. Morality is the \njudgement of God, the system of Judgement. But ethics overthrows the system of \njudgement. The opposition of values (Good-Evil) is supplanted by the qualitative \ndifference of modes of existence (good-bad) (Deleuze, 1988: 23). \n \nWhat is interesting in Deleuze\u201fs argument here is that Morality is \u201ethe system of \njudgement\u201f, the system of \u201etranscendent values\u201f set by God.  Ethics, on the contrary, is \n\u201ethe qualitative difference of modes of existence\u201f.8  The distinction here between \n 25 \ntranscendent values (Morality) and immanent modes of existence (ethics) is resonant with \nthe distinction that Bergson makes between analysis as a system which exists prior to and \nregardless of the thing and intuition as the method through which a thing is grasped as it \nis in itself.  That is, Morality as a \u201esystem of judgement\u201f of transcendent values can be, in \nthe terms of this article, likened to the analytical framework by which things can be \ncompared to what we believe we already know of it and of other things.  Ethics, on the \nother hand, is immanent to the thing itself, that is it is within the thing, at the core of the \nthing, unique to the thing: intuitive. Indeed, to push this association of Morality\/analysis \nand ethics\/intuition further, Deleuze goes on to argue that, \u201e[l]aw, whether moral or \nsocial, does not provide us with any knowledge; it makes nothing known\u2019 (Deleuze, 1988: \n24, my emphasis).  Here, law, in the shape of Morality, is like analysis; it \u201edoes not \nprovide us with any knowledge\u201f.  \n \nCoinciding with the specificity of the thing, being immanent to it, is therefore, both \nintuitive and ethical.  Moreover, intuition and ethics necessarily involves becoming in \nsympathy with the thing.  This is central to the argument I am making here regarding the \nethics of the method of intuition and to the relationship between intuition and intimacy.  \nThe method of intuition, as Bergson\u201fs example of the movement of the object in space \nindicates, is a method which emerges through an ontology of movement and becoming.  \nThings \u2013 the  object of research and the researcher for example \u2013 are not static, \nautonomous entities but rather are always moving, changing, transforming.  As such, for \nresearch to grasp this movement, it must also move with the becoming of the thing; \nresearch must become in sympathy with the thing.  In terms of intimacy, what this \n 26 \nimplies is that it is not the researcher(s) who moves close to the research object, becomes \nintimate with it, and, in so doing, coincides with it and \u201euncovers\u201f what is unique about it.  \nSuch an understanding of method relies upon and reinforces a distinction between \nsubject(ivity) and object(ivity) whereby the reseacher(s), as subject(s), has the capacity to \nmove, discover and reveal the inert object.  Rather, what is a stake here is the becoming \nof research, a process of transformation where researcher(s) and researched are in \nproductive relations with each other; researcher(s) and researched change each other.  \nUnderstood in terms of a method of intuition, then, intimacy is relational; it is invented \nthrough its relations of becoming.  Drawing on Deleuze\u201fs discussion of Spinoza, the \nrelationality of a method of intuition is what makes it ethical.  Put another way, ethics are \npossible not through the imposition of an already-existing, transcendent system of \njudgement (i.e. Morality), but through the coincidence with, the relationality of, the \nimmanent becoming of the thing.  \u201eEthics\u201f is not, therefore, a static system (of Good-\nEvil) into which things can be fitted but, rather, ethics are emergent, dynamic and \ntransformative. Integral to both Deleuze\u201fs reading of Spinoza\u201fs ethics and Bergson\u201fs \nmethod of intuition is the assumption of the capacity of things to change and unfold.  \nWhereas analytical research is moral \u2013 that is, it \u201eknows\u201f the \u201eproblem\u201f of the research \nobject prior to and in spite of its becoming \u2013 what is ethical about intuitive research is not \nonly its attention to the uniqueness of things but also its mobility, its ability to become as \nand through the relations between researcher(s) and researched.  \n \nHow, then, is a method of intuition ethical in the case of social research on the relations \nbetween girls\u201f and young women\u201fs bodies and images?  First, I would suggest, \n 27 \nconceiving the bodies and images as becoming through their relations, rather than as \nseparate entities, is ethical in its shift of emphasis away from the bodies and images \nthemselves and towards their relationality.  This limits the potential of seeing the bodies \nand\/or images as \u201ebad\u201f (or, rather, \u201eevil\u201f) and of expecting some kind of \u201eGood\u201f bodies \nand\/or images to instead be possible.  Second, and drawing on the understanding of ethics \nas the affective capacities of bodies, the emphasis on relationality is ethical in its \nattention to how encounters are increased or decreased in power; thus, there are not \n\u201egood\u201f or \u201eevil\u201f bodies and\/or images but good or bad encounters between bodies and \nimages.  Third, in seeing the ethics of intuitive research as immanent, in contrast with the \nMorality of transcendent analysis, the relations between bodies and images cannot be \nknown, prior and external to, their specificity.  This is ethical, I suggest, because rather \nthan interpreting these relations in terms of what is believed to be known about them, \nknowledge must be created through coincidence, through what these relations are in \nthemselves.  And fourth, it is ethical not to know the relations between bodies and images \nin advance because something (rather than nothing) can therefore be made known.  \nInventing ways of knowing the relations between bodies and images does not so much \n\u201emultipl[y] without end the number of points of view [of an object] in order to complete \nits always incomplete representation\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 24), as create a multiplicity of \ndifference, an \u201eabsolute\u201f knowledge which might complement and\/or contradict other \nknowledges of an object.   \n \nIn beginning to answer the question asked in the subtitle to this conclusion, then, social \nresearch might want to become intuitive because of the version of ethics that opens up.  \n 28 \nThat is, in questioning, and in some ways challenging, what is known by social research, \nits ethical relationship with its objects and intentions is invigorated rather than lost.  For \nexample, while it queries the use of social research by making difficult its relationship \nwith social change, intuitive research might, at the same time, invent different ways of \npractising social research and different kinds of (social) transformation.  In the case of \nfeminist research on the relations between bodies and images, the ethics produced \nthrough an intuitive method both contribute to and extend what we \u201ealready know\u201f about \nthis area. Indeed, intuitive research can be understood not as necessarily antagonistic to \nexisting research, as Bergson\u201fs distinction between intuition and analysis might imply, \nbut as both complementary and challenging.  And thus, while intuitive research and the \nethics it demands is undoubtedly, an \u201eextremely difficult\u201f (Bergson, 1999: 37) task, it is \nalso a worthwhile one. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to the editors of this journal for allowing me the opportunity to develop these \nideas.  Particular thanks to Mariam Fraser, Adrian Mackenzie, Monica Moreno-Figueroa \nand the two anonymous reviewers who have read the article at various stages and whose \ncomments have been instructive to the version that is published here. \n \n                                                     \nNotes \n1 As noted, then, this is a research area in which work is conducted within a range of \ndisciplinary backgrounds; psychology, media and cultural studies, education, sociology \nfor example and many of the issues of concern I pinpoint intersect.  I use the term \u201esocial \n 29 \n                                                                                                                                                              \nresearch\u201f in this article in order to draw attention to this trans-disciplinary field, and to \nraise the question below of what the purposes of social research might be. \n2 I use the term \u201emethod of intuition\u201f to refer to Bergson\u201fs argument concerning the \ndistinction between intuition and analysis.  This term comes from Deleuze\u201fs (1988) \nchapter on \u201eintuition as method\u201f.  However, as discussed below, the term should be \ndistinguished from \u201emethod\u201f in social research. \n3 An Introduction to Metaphysics is also sometimes titled, The Creative Mind: An \nIntroduction to Metaphysics. \n4 Bergon\u201fs work on duration, however, was important in the research (see Coleman, \nforthcoming, chapter 6).  \n5 \u201ePoint of view\u201f in this sense refers not to partial, situated knowledges that feminist \ntheorists such as Haraway (1991) propose, but rather to knowledges of an object which \nare external to that object.  In a similar vein, \u201erelative\u201f knowledge refers not to a \nknowledge which recognises its partiality but to a knowledge that believes it already \nknows the object it is studying.  \n6 I am focusing on the Body Image Summit here because I think it raises interesting \nquestions concerning for what, and for whom, social research is intended.  These \nquestions are returned to towards the end of the article. Information on the Body Image \nSummit was from a website (www.cabinet-office.gov.uk\/women\u201fs-\nunit\/WhatWeDo\/BodyImage) which is no longer live (last accessed in autumn 2001).  \nFor recent British statistics on dieting and eating disorders, see for example the Eating \nDisorders Association\u201fs website: http:\/\/www.b-eat.co.uk\/Home, accessed 7th May 2008. \n 30 \n                                                                                                                                                              \n7 It should be noted that, for reasons of space, and in keeping with my Deleuzian \napproach to intuition and to my empirical research, I focus here only on Deleuze\u201fs (1988) \nreading of Spinoza in Spinoza: Practical Philosophy (1988).  It should also be noted that \nthe notions of intuition are developed differently by Spinoza and Bergson and that here I \nam concerned with the complementary reading of these notions in the work of Deleuze.   \n8 For an extended discussion of \u201equalitative difference\u201f, see Deleuze\u201fs \u201esecond rule\u201f in \nBergsonism (20002).   \n \n \nBibliography \nBergson, H.
