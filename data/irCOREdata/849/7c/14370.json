At one level RWFS takes the form of a sophisticated game in which different\noutcomes to the interview are possible according to the learner's degree of skill. At another level,\nRWFS is designed to encourage the language learner's awareness and understanding of the\npragmatic features of conversation. RWFS runs on HyperContext, a hybrid hypertextlexpert\nsystem developed in Pavia by two of the authors, Marco Piastra and Roberto Bolognesi, and\nwhich supports dynamic hypermedia units. HyperContext's dynamic linking capacity plays a vital\nrole in simulating significant conversational features such as the conditioning of a current move in\nthe conversation by information acquired much earlier in the course of the interview. In this\nconnection, the paper discusses the contribution of RMCI (Re-usable Model of Conversational\nInteraction), a re-usable application-independent applied model of interaction on which the game\nis based, and which links a tactical level (the conversation) to a metalevel which provides a move-\nby-move commentary on interactional theory. In its turn, RMCFs metalevel is linked to a\nstrategic level which interprets the structure of the conversation in terms of a pyramid-like\nhierarchy of increasingly abstract theoretical concepts.\nIntroduction\nAssume a lawyer is interviewing a client. For the participants in the interview, the interaction\nwill probably be seen in its simplest form, namely as achieving certain goals and overcoming\nobstacles that would otherwise prevent these goals from being achieved. For an outside\nobserver, examining the conversation will be a more complex process that takes into account\nthe interactants' behaviour, their social status, and knowledge and perception of each other, as\nwell as their perception of what it is possible and appropriate to say and do at any point in the\nconversation. Although many excellent theoretical models exist that interpret these\ncharacteristics (see, for instance, Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975; Coulthard, 1977; De\n27\nAnthony Baldry, Marco Piastra and Roberto Bolognesi Retraction with Face Saving\nBeaugrande and Dressier, 1981), an application-independent applied model of interaction that\ncan be used in a variety of computer applications to encourage a student's awareness and\nunderstanding of the pragmatic features of conversational encounters still needs to be\ndeveloped. Since its educational success depends on its potential to interpret the work being\ndone in a conversational encounter, such an application must contain a metalevel that\nsystematically comments on the tactical level, i.e. what is actually happening in the\nconversation. In its turn, the tactical level must be related to a higher level, the strategic level\nwhich characterizes goals, constraints, identities and other ingredients in the encounter in\nterms of specific theories of interaction. The resulting application will thus provide a\ncommentary that interprets the tactics that the participants adopt in pursuit of their\nconversational goals, but which in its turn is linked to a more theoretical account of how the\nparticipants' tactics are achieving these goals and coping with the social and behavioural\nconditions placed on their attainment.\nRWFS (Retraction With Face Saving) is designed to fulfil these objectives. It simulates a\nlawyer-client consultation in which the goal of the lawyer (LW) is to get his client, a lorry\ndriver (LD), to rectify a misleading statement made to the police following a road accident.\nThe description given in this paper relates to the tactics needed to complete the first stage in\nthe game, namely the LW gets the LD to agree to retract his statement without humiliating\nhim in the process. As the introductory case notes (Figures 1 and 2) show, RWFS implements\nthe strategic level in terms of intentionality and acceptability (De Beaugrande and Dressier,\n1981; Searle, 1983; Searle et al, 1992).\nThe simulation takes the form of an adventure game with rules that must be respected. In\norder successfully to negotiate the individual stages in the LWs conversational plan, the\nstudent must respect the conditions placed on the LW in the conversation by the LD's\npersonality, by the social conventions that operate in a lawyer-client consultation, and more\ngenerally by the structure of conversation itself. The student is required to follow a tactical\nprogression that keeps the LD's willingness to participate in the dialogue alive. The tactical\nprogression consists of a series of moves made by the LW (a multiple-choice option selected by\nthe student). The LW has to adopt tactics that fall within the range of (psychological)\nacceptability to the client, since each move causes the LD's degree of 'one-up\/one-down'\ndomination (Watzlawick et al, 1967), co-operation and trust (Grice, 1975) to be modified.\nAs Figure 3 indicates, there is no single winning path through the materials. In order to\nproceed to the second stage in the game, a student must achieve the interactional goal (the\nLD's ADMIT), respecting social conventions and norms, in particular the need to preserve the\nLD's face. Visual and textual clues relating to the LD's reactions (and hence to the student's\nskill in handling the interview) are given as the game proceeds. With the exception of three\n'fatal' moves, marked Exit in Figure 3, no single move will cause the LD to seek another\nlawyer, and provided the tactics fall within a range of acceptability to the LD, the first stage in\nthe game can be taken to a successful conclusion. There are many possible outcomes, each\nassociated with different conversational and psychological states. Some of these outcomes\nmean that the student wins the game; others that he or she has failed.\nFive basic problems face the researchers wishing to model a simulated interview which, though\nimplemented as an adventure game, still remains sophisticated enough to act as an\nintroduction to conversational theory for students of linguistics:\n(i) scripting the simulated interview in such a way as to provide for convincing alternative\nconversational states during the proceedings, as well as a convincing outcome;\n28\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nDrawing up a conversational strategy\nYou are a lawyer (LW). A few days ago you were contacted by a lorry driver (LD)\ninvolved in a road accident. While you are waiting for him to arrive, you decide your\nconversational strategy and tactics. You suspect that your client will lose his licence, at the\nvery least. You also realize that the statement he has made to the police is inaccurate and\nmust be rectified. By all accounts, he is clearly an irascible person so you must tread\ncarefully. You must do four things in this interview:\n(1) make sure your client tells you the truth about the accident;\n(2) get your client to withdraw from his current position;\n(3) tell your client the truth about his licence, if he asks you;\n(4) show the client various documents at the right time and in an appropriate order: these\ninclude police reports, medical examinations, newspaper reports, statements and\ndocuments relating to previous cases.\nDividing up the conversation into sub-goals and sub-sub-goals\nIn order to proceed to the second sub-goal you must successfully complete the first sub-\ngoal: ADMIT.\nThis requires the LD to recognize that certain passages in his statement are not in his\nfavour. This is divided into four sub-sub-goals. Each establishes a desired state whose\nachievement requires you to adopt specific tactics. Your plan is to establish:\n(1) a starting point in the discussion: by selecting which documents to leave in full view on\nthe table, you decide to reveal how much you know about the case; by setting the declared\n(as opposed to real) shared information, you also implicitly establish your subsequent\ntactics by choosing one of four initial conditions: Hide newspaper; Hide statement; Hide\nboth; Hide nothing. Your choice of initial condition will influence the dialogue, but you\nshould attempt to manipulate these conditions to your advantage as the game goes on.\n(2) recognition of stress by the LD: the LD's actions (and in particular his statement) were\nthe result of the stressful circumstances at the time; you use the newspaper article and\/or\nthe information it contains to achieve this recognition; decide your tactics carefully.\n(3) an acceptable pre-retraction state: namely the idea that because the statement was given\nunder stressful circumstances, it contains errors and ambiguities; you get the LD to agree\nthat a misleading statement is understandable but regrettable; you use his statement - but\nwhat are your tactics in using it?\n(4) an admission that retraction is necessary: having established that (a) the statement was\ngiven under stressful circumstances - almost under duress - and that (b) there are\ninaccurate and misleading details in the statement, your tactics now require you to get the\nLD to agree to retract; you decide to play your ace, showing the LD the confidential report\nand\/or the information it contains in an appropriate way - how in practice will you play\nthis ace?\nThe phone rings and your receptionist tells you that your client is on his way to your office\nFigure 1: Case notes: the lawyer's conversational plan\n29\nAnthony Baldry, Marco Piastra and Roberto Bolognesi Retraction with Face Saving\nCoping with the lorry driver's conversational plan\nIt will be hard to stop the client from trying to impose his own conversational plan on you.\nHe wants to find out whether he will lose his licence. He is not an easy client, and there will\nbe times when he will be dominating, uncooperative and highly suspicious - the very\nopposite of what you want. The trick is to make sure these attitudes are kept within an\nappropriate range so that you keep the conversation going, steering it towards your own\nconversational goals. You cannot simply ignore your client or simply lay down the law\nwith him; any conversation is a process of negotiation. In this chess-like game, you need to\nwork out tactics that take into account the possible responses that your client will make\nboth immediately and at a later stage in the conversation as the result of your current\nmove.\nAnticipating the lorry driver's probable reactions\nGood and bad moves are defined in terms of their acceptability or otherwise to your client.\nThe range of acceptability is defined numerically in terms of three parameters: dominance,\nco-operation, trust. These function independently of each other, and each move you make\nwill cause the current state of each parameter to go up or down or stay the same. Ideally,\nyou want dominance to decrease, co-operation and trust to increase. The feedback from\nthe client - his reaction to your move - will, of course, influence and become part of the\nsubsequent conversation. Use your common sense and knowledge of the previous, current\nand probable subsequent states in the conversation to keep the conversation going.\nFigure 2: Case notes: the lorry driver's conversational plan and likely reactions\n(ii) getting the computer to simulate the behaviour of one of the parties in a two-party\nconversation, and that party's reactions to the conversational tactics and strategies adopted by\nthe other party, played in a chess-like game, by the student;\n(iii) capturing the dynamic nature of conversation, a process in which the decisions made by\nthe parties place constraints on their subsequent conversation;\n(iv) defining mechanisms by which to associate an amusing game to rather more serious\ntheories of conversational interaction;\n(v) creating a re-usable model of conversational interaction that can be used as a basis for\nsubsequent related applications. Because of the complexity of these issues, and restrictions on\nspace, most of what follows relates to the tactical level, and only a brief reference is made to\nthe metalevel and the strategic level.\nRWFS and the definition of the tactical level\nScripting and the problem of modelling dialogue pathways in hypertext\nAs mentioned above, the first problem relates to the scripting of an interview in such a way as\nto provide for convincing alternative conversational states during the proceedings, as well as a\nconvincing outcome. Figure 3 gives an overview of the tactical level (limited to the first sub-\ngoal) which shows that the set of possible hypertext pathways coincides with an equivalent set\nof dialogue pathways: the user impersonates one of the two interactants and at each step\n30\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nmakes a choice as to the next move to make along the dialogue pathway. The nodes are\ndivided into four sections corresponding to each of the four sub-sub-goals (hence nodes LW\n1.1,2.1,3.1,4.1 etc.).\nSimulating the other party's behaviour\nRWFS relies on a working memory, a means by which the history of the moves along the\ndialogue pathway and the current state of the exchange between the two interactants are\nrecorded. As indicated in the second paragraph of Figure 2, simulating the other party's\nbehaviour is achieved in terms of three parameters - co-operation, dominance and trust - that\nchange the state of the working memory in such a way that a visual and textual response can\nbe given to the student. These parameters are expressed as conditions associated with each step\ntaken along the dialogue pathway. In Figure 3 they are marked respectively as C, D, T; the\nsymbols + and - represent changes in their values associated with a given choice of move in\nthe dialogue. In other words, the LD's linguistic-pragmatic interpretation of the LW's moves\nis associated to each step in the dialogue. But this association is carried out dynamically.\nIn order to understand the concept of dynamic management of dialogue, a key concept in\nRWFS is the following theorem:\na conversational state = the current hypertext node + the state of the working memory\nWhen an application is authored in HyperContext, rules are associated by the author to every\npossible hypertext move. These rules provide for the updating of the working memory. The\nhistory of the student's passage along a dialogue pathway recorded in the working memory is\nin reality a synthesis of the major events which may affect the entire history (previous, current\nand subsequent) of the dialogue. The working memory update is not directly perceived by the\nuser, but its effects are constantly present. The modelling of the conversational and\npsychological state of the other party in RWFS, i.e. the LD, is managed through the working\nmemory. Hence the presentation of the LD with an angry or happy face depends entirely on\nthe state of the working memory. Similarly, as Figure 3 shows, the initial conditions (Hide\nnewspaper, etc.) are recorded in the working memory (+HN or +HS, etc.). A question mark\nindicates a consistency check. In other words, according to the way the game is played, the state\nof the working memory will be checked against the rules associated with a particular node.\nConversational exchanges and moves\nThe best-known theoretical model of conversational interaction is the rank-and-scale model\nassociated with Coulthard, Sinclair and their colleagues (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975;\nCoulthard, 1977, 1981, 1992) which provides for five levels of analysis, and in which each\nhigher level consists uniquely of elements taken from the level immediately below. Thus an\ninteractional encounter contains one or more transactions, a transaction one or more\nexchanges, an exchange one or more moves, a move one or more acts. The tactical level of\nRWFS is systematically and exclusively defined in terms of exchanges and the moves they\nconsist of. A hypertext node in the tactical level corresponds to a move in the rank-and-scale\nmodel. As Figure 3 shows, the symbol \u2022 represents an LW node, and hence an LW move,\nwhile the symbol Q, represents an LD node, and hence an LD move. All the exchanges in the\ncurrent version of RWFS are made up of an LW move followed by an LD move.\n31\nAnthony Baldry, Marco Piastra and Roberto Bolognesi Retraction with Face Saving\nThe concept of different conversational states despite apparently identical\ncircumstances\nLike other hypertext units, the nodes in RWFS contain text and images. These are static\nnodes: the texts, the images and their composition do not change as the student progresses\nalong a dialogue pathway. The nodes in the tactical level are not accessible in a completely free\nway: the sequences linking nodes at the tactical level (see Figure 3) are the only sequences\nwhich form a coherent dialogue pathway. The coherence of the pathways at the tactical level is\nguaranteed by the arrangement of the hypertext links and by the consistency rules affecting\nthese links. The consistency rules are established by the author (in the same way as specified\nabove under Simulating the other party's behaviour, namely by associating rules to every\npossible hypertext move). In most nodes, the user can choose between different moves. The\nconsistency rules make the links dynamic, thus governing access between the nodes. To\nsimplify the work of the author, different dialogue pathways may share one or more hypertext\nnodes. This means that there is no need to author each dialogue pathway separately. As\nmentioned above, the way in which a node is accessed determines the state of the conversation\nin that node and the possible continuation of the conversation subsequently. Thus the user\nmay find himself or herself in apparently similar circumstances (i.e. the presentation of the\nsame text and images) and yet be faced with conversational states that are entirely different.\nTake, for example, the node marked LW 2.1 (Show the article). This may be accessed from:\n(a) node LD 1.1.2(1);\n(b) node LD 3.1.1(1)\n(c) node LD 3.1.1 (2).\nIn contrast to case (a), access from (b) or (c) entails a reversal of the order in which the sub-\nsub-goals are achieved, with sub-sub-goal 3 preceding sub-sub-goal 2. In other words,\naccessing the same node through two different pathways means having two different states in\nthe working memory.\nDynamic interpretation\nThe previous section describes the tactical level. This provides the game component. But we\nneed something that associates an amusing game to rather more serious theories of\nconversational interaction and that views a conversation as a dynamic, on-going process in\nwhich the decisions made by the parties will place constraints on their subsequent\nconversation. How does a researcher keen to create an applied model of interaction go about\nthis particular task?\nThe need for a connection between the game level and the theoretical models\nClearly there is a need to link up the tactical level to the strategic level in a context-dependent\nway in order to establish what specific aspects of conversational theory are being illustrated at\na given point in a conversation. But it is also necessary to organize the strategic level in a non-\ncontext-dependent way such that the student can browse through the materials and gain a\ngeneral overview of the conversational theory being presented. How can these conflicting\nprinciples be resolved? The strategic level itself is organized as a pyramid in which the\ncharacterization of, for example, sub-sub-goals is the lowest level, linked to a higher set of sub-\ngoals, in turn linked to a still higher level of goals, and so on until the top of the pyramid is\n32\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nJSJi\n1 O -a\nr\nO \u00ab 3 O\n*| III\nIipH |\ngo|i\n=\n!TL,\ngcbl- O \u00a7I\n|i.\nI\ni\u00b0Is\no\n3 -t-\ns O\n\u2022 _ t\nI ?

Students can browse through the pyramid at will. However, access to the strategic\nlevel can be gained only from the tactical level and this link is made to specific points in the\nstrategic level, the point of access changing as the game proceeds. Access to a specific strategic\nlevel node is achieved by clicking on a highlighted keyword in the metalevel commentary\nassociated to a particular move. It may well be that a different choice made at the same node\nwill require access to a different point in the strategic level. This is one reason why the link\nbetween strategic and tactical levels is made through a separate level: the metalevel.\nProviding a dynamic interpretation environment\nThe link between a move and a strategic level node is achieved by associating interpretive\nhypertext nodes (the metalevel commentary) to the dialogue pathway nodes (the tactical level).\nThis association also has to be dynamic to work properly. Access to the interpretive nodes\ndepends on the state of the conversation, i.e. on the node reached in the dialogue pathway and\nthe state of the working memory. The interpretive nodes explain, in a context-dependent way,\nthe theoretical significance of a conversational state vis-a-vis a possible model of dialogue\ninterpretation. Because of the complexity of authoring such a representation of interaction,\nwhere a change at one level has consequences at the other levels, it was decided in the early\n(prototype) design stages to consider a single feature as primary at all three levels, from a\ntheoretical standpoint. The choice fell on the exchange, as this ensures the necessary focus on\nthe relationships between the participants in a conversational encounter. Thus, although the\ntactical level is organized in terms of moves and exchanges, the links with other levels are\nachieved in terms of exchanges. Other interactional features, such as the individual moves\ncontemplated by each participant, their speech acts, their decisions as regards turn-taking and\nnext-speaker selection, changes in mood and body language, are considered essential but\nsubordinate. With its focus on the notion of exchange, the proposed applied model of\ninteraction takes changes in the state of the shared information, the mutual recognition of the\nroles and identities of participants and their mutual perception of other participants' moods\ninto account. More significantly, the model captures the constraints imposed on subsequent\nexchanges by the previous history of the conversation.\nConnecting the tactical level to the strategic level through the metalevel\nIn just the same way as the dialogue pathway nodes collectively make up the tactical level, so\nthe interpretive nodes collectively make up the metalevel. The strategic level consists of\nhierarchically organized hypertext nodes in which the author describes and interprets the\nsequences in a dialogue pathway according to the chosen theoretical model. The strategic level,\nmoreover, has the goal of justifying the alternative sequences of moves and exchanges in the\ndialogue pathways and illustrating the restrictions on the possible continuation introduced by\nthe choices made. The interpretive nodes (i.e. the metalevel) serve to correlate each accessible\nconversational state with the theoretical explanations contained in the strategic level.\nModel re-usability\nEven authors may well get lost in hyperspace\nThe construction of a hypermedia unit like RWFS can require the author to create hundreds,\npossibly thousands, of different nodes. The organization into three distinct levels helps the\nauthor to dominate the complexity of the application. Within certain limits the three levels can\n34\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nbe subdivided and managed separately. Each level can be further organized (e.g. a flow chart\ncontaining possible dialogue pathways for the tactical level, a hierarchical pyramid structure\nfor the strategic level). Hence the conception of RWFS as being based on a more abstract\napplication-independent applied model of interaction denominated RMCI (Re-usable Model\nof Conversational Interaction).\nThe RWFS paradigm can be re-used\nThanks to the RMCI, the material contained in RWFS can be re-used in other units. The\nmetalevel nodes act in such a way as to separate the tactical level and the strategic level, thus\nenhancing the possibility of re-use. The tactical level may be interpreted in terms of one or\nmore theoretical interpretive models, and vice versa the strategic level can be linked to\ndifferent tactical levels. Thus, for example, although the current model of interaction is heavily\ngeared towards an understanding of the concept of exchange, there is no reason why the\ntactical level could not be linked to an entirely different theoretical interpretation. Indeed, the\nreversal in the order in which sub-goals are tackled (see above under Conversational exchanges\nand moods) indicates RMCI's capacity to manage whole chains of exchanges as a separate\nblock. In other words, RMCI already contains the wherewithal to handle conversational units\nhigher than the exchange. It may well turn out to be the case that RMCI can be used in\nconjunction with end-applications that require, for example, the incorporation of Coulthard\nand Sinclair's concept of transaction (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975; Coulthard, 1992).\nRWFS, RMCI and HyperContext\nAlthough both RWFS and RMCI represent a simplified interpretation of interaction, many of\ntheir features cannot be captured with the current generation of commercially available\nhypertext tools. The design criteria of HyperContext, a hybrid hypertext\/expert system, are\nsuch as to take into account the complex work of tracking and updating changes that occur at\nall three levels in the applied model of interaction. This is in itself a complex game of mutually\nconditioning and interlinked actions. Since the description of RMCI and HyperContext in this\npaper is necessarily reductive, readers are referred to the technical report on HyperContext\n(Piastra and Bolognesi, 1993). It is hoped to publish a fuller account of HyperContext's\npotential value in applied linguistics at a later date. This will indicate how important it is to\ndevelop re-usable applications that represent an intermediate level between an authoring\nsystem and an end-user application.\nConclusion\nThe description given above is technical, but shows how dynamic hypermedia can present\nconversation in a holistic way and from many different viewpoints - an essential requirement\nif conversational theory is to be tackled properly. In this respect, the goal of RWFS is to\nencourage students to acquire the following skills:\n\u2022 relating the surface structure of the conversation (the tactical level) to the underlying\nbelief and behavioural systems (accounted for in the strategic level);\n\u2022 the constraints - social and linguistic - placed on the interactants;\n\u2022 the changing relationship between the interactants and the changes in the roles that they\nplay;\n35\nAnthony Baldry, Marco Piastra and Roberto Bolognesi Retraction with Face Saving\n\u2022 changes in the shared information as the conversation proceeds;\n\u2022 turn-taking and next-speaker selection;\n\u2022 other factors affecting the course of the conversation such as the need to preserve face.\nWe may view these skills as relating, at least in part, to a student's metapragmatic competence\n- taken here as being a student's ability to describe what is going on in a conversation and\nrelating it to theoretical models of interaction. Such skills can be secured only with the\ndevelppment of specialized techniques and frameworks in which they can be practised. A\ndynamic hypermedia model of at least some aspects of conversation seems to be effective. In\npursuing the goal of creating suitable computer-based techniques and frameworks, research is\nneeded in specialized Melds, like the one proposed here, which entail the modelling of the\ninterplay of many linguistic phenomena from many different standpoints. This project thus\nrepresents a specialist approach to multimedia in which the relationship of data to a critical\nand theoretical interpretive framework is an overriding consideration.\nBut will it help students? How do students react to the view of pragmatics as presented in\nRWFS? Will they find it as dull as ditchwater or will it help them to pin down the eel-like,\nmultifaceted interplay of factors in conversation which are so hard to cope with? It must be\nstressed that RWFS is an alpha-prototype application, based on an alpha-prototype applied\nlinguistics model of interaction which in turn runs on an alpha-prototype system whose\neducational validity is in the alpha-stage of evaluation. The application has all the weaknesses\nof a prototype, most seriously that it does not use authentic interactional data. It is also a\nheavily simplified model of face-to-face interaction, which takes the form of an interview made\nup of a series of exchanges, each consisting rigidly of a client move followed by a lawyer move.\nThe work of experimentation and validation of the application may well indicate a need for\nchanges to be made. But, in focusing on pragmatic principles RWFS does make students more\naware of the nature of interviews as a social activity; it does relate interviews to other types of\nconversational interaction; it does focus on the asymmetries that occur in interviews, and it\ndoes highlight the consequences when a particular exchange sequence is adopted. It is a start\n(but only a start) to the complex work of realizing the potential of computers to relate the\nstudy of language more fully to social behaviour and cross-cultural differences.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Lavinia Merlini Barbaresi, University of Pisa, and Carol Taylor\nTorsello and Franco Crevatin, University of Trieste, for their help during the development of\nRWFS.
