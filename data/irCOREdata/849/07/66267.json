Our result is complete at next-to-leading-logarithmic\naccuracy and includes some known contributions at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.\nCompared to finite order computations, the reliability of the theoretical evaluation is greatly im-\nproved, resulting in a substantially reduced scale dependence and a faster convergent perturbative\nseries. This allows us to significantly improve over previous determinations of the MS bottom quark\nmass, mb, from non-relativistic sum rules. Our final figure reads mb(mb) = 4.19\u00b1 0.06 GeV.\nProcesses involving a bb\u00af quark pair close to threshold\nare very sensitive to the bottom quark mass, mb, and\noffer a unique opportunity to accurately determine its\nvalue. One of the cleanest observables where this depen-\ndence on mb shows up is the non-relativistic sum rule [1]\nMn \u2261 12pi\n2e2b\nn!\n(\nd\ndq2\n)n\n\u03a0(q2)\n\u2223\u2223\nq2=0\n=\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\nds\nsn+1\nRbb\u00af(s),\n(1)\nwhere Rbb\u00af(s) \u2261 \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 bb\u00af)\/\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212), \u03a0(q2)\nis the vacuum polarization and eb = \u22121\/3 the elec-\ntric charge of the bottom quark. The typical scale is\np \u223c 2mb\/\n\u221a\nn and, provided n is not chosen to be too\nlarge, the left-hand side of Eq. (1) can be reliably com-\nputed using a weak coupling analysis (the right-hand side\ncan be determined from experiment). To describe such\nprocesses theoretically, a standard fixed-order calculation\nin the strong coupling \u03b1s is insufficient due to the pres-\nence of terms (\u03b1s\/v)\nn \u223c 1 at each order in perturba-\ntion theory, where v \u223c 1\/\u221an \u226a 1 is the velocity of the\nheavy quarks. Such terms appear because there are sev-\neral scales involved in the problem. There is the hard\nscale \u00b5h \u223c mb, the soft scale \u00b5s \u223c mbv of the order\nof the typical momentum and, finally, the ultrasoft scale\n\u00b5us \u223c mbv2 of the order of the typical kinetic energy of\nthe heavy quarks. Using effective field theories (for a re-\nview see [2]), the perturbative expansion can be system-\natically reorganized into an expansion in the two small\nparameters of the problem, \u03b1s and v, and the bb\u00af cross\nsection can be written as\nRbb\u00af(s) = v\n\u2211\nn\n(\u03b1s\nv\n)n\n(2)\n\u00d7{1(LO);\u03b1s, v(NLO);\u03b12s , v\u03b1s, v2(NNLO) . . .} .\nThe coefficients of this series can be computed most effi-\nciently using the threshold expansion [3].\nAt present, non-relativistic sum rules have been com-\nputed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [4, 5].\nThis allowed for a precise determination of the bottom\nquark mass using a well understood perturbative ap-\nproach. Unfortunately, in the on-shell scheme, the NNLO\ncorrections turned out to be much larger than anticipated\nand, moreover, very strongly scale dependent. The use of\nthreshold masses [6, 7, 8], which account for the cancel-\nlation of the pole mass renormalon in the observable, do\nnot really solve these problems, specially for the strong\nscale dependence. Overall, this produced a very slowly\nconvergent series, being the dominant source of error in\nthe determination of mb. Non-perturbative corrections\nare known in the limit mb\/n \u226b \u039bQCD [9]. Even though\nthis limit does not hold for large enough n, we can take\nit as an order of magnitude estimate. Numerically, these\ncorrections are very small and can be neglected in com-\nparison with other sources of errors.\nThe situation is very similar in the case of tt\u00af pair pro-\nduction near threshold. In this case the use of threshold\nmasses results in a well behaved perturbative series for\nthe position of the peak of the tt\u00af cross section and, there-\nfore, may enable a precise determination of the top quark\nmass, once experimental data is available. However, the\nlarge theoretical uncertainty in the normalization of the\ncross section remained (even if the series is more conver-\ngent than in the bottom case). It has been claimed [10]\nthat the source of this uncertainty is due to potentially\nlarge log v terms, which arise due to the presence of sev-\neral scales and take the form log\u00b5h\/\u00b5s and log\u00b5s\/\u00b5us.\nAlthough it has been shown later [11, 12] that some ex-\npressions used in that paper were incorrect and that the\nfinal error claimed was somewhat over optimistic [13], the\nmessage that the resummation of logarithms improves\nthe scale dependence has gone through.\nGiven the importance of the log v terms for the tt\u00af cross\nsection, it is natural to ask whether their inclusion also\nimproves the situation in the bb\u00af case. In our case we have\nto replace the expansion of Eq. (2) by\nRbb\u00af(s) = v\n\u2211\nn\n(\u03b1s\nv\n)n\u2211\nm\n(\u03b1s log v)\nm\n(3)\n\u00d7{1(LL);\u03b1s, v(NLL);\u03b12s , v\u03b1s, v2(NNLL) . . .} .\nAs we will see, these logarithms are extremely important\nnumerically and substantially improve the reliability of\nthe theoretical evaluation of the moments.\n2The n-th moment, Mn, as defined in Eq. (1) is com-\nputed in the usual way. First we match QCD to non-\nrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) at the hard scale which we\nset to \u00b5h = m. This theory is then matched to poten-\ntial NRQCD (pNRQCD) [14]. Solving the correspond-\ning non-relativistic Schro\u00a8dinger equation perturbatively\nwe obtain ImG(0, 0, E), the imaginary part of the Green\nfunction at the origin. Mn can then be written as\nMn = 48pie\n2\nbNc\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndE\n(E + 2mb)2n+3\n(4)\n\u00d7\n(\nc21 \u2212 c1c2\nE\n3mb\n)\nImG(0, 0, E),\nwhere E =\n\u221a\ns \u2212 2mb, Nc = 3 and c1 and c2 are the\nmatching coefficients of the currents, normalized to 1 at\nleading order. In a strict non-relativistic expansion one\nalso expands\n1\n(E + 2mb)2n+3\n=\ne\n\u2212n E\nm\nb\n(2mb)2n+3\n(\n1\u2212 3E\n2mb\n+\nnE2\n4m2b\n. . .\n)\n(5)\ntreating nE \u223c mb. We also remark that the loga-\nrithms involving \u00b5s always appear in the combination\nlog(\u22124mbE\/\u00b52s). This confirms that the natural scales\nare given by E \u223c mb\/n and \u00b5s \u223c p \u223c 2mb\/\n\u221a\nn. To en-\nsure the applicability of perturbation theory, we cannot\nchoose n too large and will restrict ourselves to n \u2264 14.\nThe matching coefficients of pNRQCD depend on the\nscales \u00b5h = mb, \u00b5s and \u00b5us. In solving the renormal-\nization group equations we have set \u00b5us = \u00b5\n2\ns\/m. The\nexpressions we use are complete at NLL and NNLO.\nAt NNLL they are also complete (in particular we in-\nclude the insertions of the renormalization group im-\nproved potentials to G(0, 0, E) up to the desired order\nin the MS scheme) except for c1. For c1 we are using the\nknown NLL [11] expression as well as some partial NNLL\ncontributions, which include the spin-dependent correc-\ntions [15], the NNLL ultrasoft corrections to the Green\nfunction, the corrections due to the two-loop beta run-\nning, and some contributions coming from the introduc-\ntion of partial higher-order terms in the renormalization\ngroup improved potentials that appear in the anomalous\ndimension of c1. For details we refer to Refs. [5, 16]. In\nparticular we stress that not all the ultrasoft related log-\narithms are included in our analysis. With this caveat in\nmind, we still refer to our full result as NNLL.\nWe also include QED corrections in our result. Count-\ning \u03b1 \u223c \u03b12s , these corrections enter already at NLO, due\nto a single exchange of a potential photon, but they have\nonly a minor numerical impact. They increase the ex-\ntracted bottom quark mass by less than 10 MeV.\nThe threshold masses we consider in this analysis are\nthe potential subtracted (PS) massmb,PS(\u00b5f ) [7] and the\nrenormalon subtracted (RS) mass mb,RS(\u00b5f ) [8]. The\nsubtraction scale \u00b5f that is needed for the definition of\nthe PS\/RS mass is set to \u00b5f = 2 GeV, to ensure it does\nnot exceed the characteristic scale \u00b5s. Once the PS\/RS\nmass is determined, we convert it to mb, the MS mass\nat the renormalization scale mb. We use the three-loop\nconversion [17] of the pole mass to mb and for the PS\nand RS mass a \u2018large \u03b20\u2019 [18] and renormalon-based [8]\napproximation respectively for the four-loop term.\nThe moments are evaluated by performing the energy\nintegration in the complex energy plane using a strictly\nexpanded form as indicated in Eq. (5). The difference\nbetween this evaluation and using Eq. (4) is NNNLO\nand, therefore, beyond the accuracy we are aiming at.\nHowever, for small values of n, this difference is sizable.\nIn fact, for n = 6 the resulting values for mb,PS\/RS may\ndiffer by up to 45\/60 MeV depending on how we expand\nthe prefactor Eq. (5), for n = 8 the difference is up to\n15\/25 MeV, whereas for n \u2265 10 the values for mb agree\nwithin 10\/15 MeV.\nThe experimental moments are determined as de-\nscribed in Ref. [5]. The moment is split into the con-\ntribution due to the six \u03a5 resonances and the open bb\u00af\ncontinuum. The main uncertainty comes from the rather\npoor knowledge of the latter, which we parametrize as\nRcont\nbb\u00af\n= 0.4\u00b1 0.2 [19]. Since the continuum contribution\nis suppressed for larger values of n, resulting in a smaller\nexperimental error, we refrain from using n < 6.\nThe main theoretical uncertainty in previous determi-\nnations of the bottom quark mass was due to the huge\nscale dependence of the NNLO result, which made it\nrather difficult to find a reliable procedure for estimat-\ning the theoretical error. It is the main result of this\nwork to show that the situation improves considerably if\na renormalization group improved analysis is performed.\nTo illustrate this, in Figure 1 we show the dependence\nof the theoretical value for M10 (evaluated at LO\/LL,\nNLO, NLL, NNLO and NNLL respectively) on \u00b5s. For\nthe purpose of illustration we also plot the experimen-\ntal value of the moment including its error. We set the\nstrong coupling to \u03b1s(MZ) = 0.118 and use three-loop\nevolution to determine it at lower scales. For the plot\nshown in Figure 1 we set mb,PS(2 GeV) = 4.515 GeV\nand mb,RS(2 GeV) = 4.370 GeV and vary the soft scale\naround its characteristic value \u00b5s \u223c 2mb\/\n\u221a\n10 (indicated\nby a dashed vertical line). Note that in this region the\nsize of the NNLL corrections (even if large) is consider-\nably smaller than the corresponding fixed-order NNLO\nones. Moreover, contrary to earlier analyses, the NNLL\nresult is now more stable with respect scale variations\nthan the NLL one (for the range of scales for which the\ncomputation is trustworthy). This is of course what one\nwould expect and indicates that the inclusion of the log-\narithms substantially improves the reliability of the theo-\nretical prediction. Only for scales \u00b5s < 2 GeV the situa-\ntion gets out of control, but for these scales the ultrasoft\nscale is below 1 GeV and we can not really rely on our\ncomputation.

The experimental\nmoment with its error is also shown (grey band).\nCoulomb potential also seem to be important in this re-\ngion [20].\nThe situation is similar for other values of n. As a\ngeneral feature, for increasing n, the scale dependence\nincreases slightly. This is not surprising since larger n\ninduce smaller scales and at some point the applicabil-\nity of perturbation theory is questionable. On the other\nhand, as mentioned above, smaller values of n have the\ndisadvantage that the non-relativistic approximation be-\ncomes less reliable.\nThese findings show that it is possible to improve the\naccuracy of previous determinations of the bottom quark\nmass from non-relativistic sum rules if the renormaliza-\ntion group improvement is applied. In order to deter-\nmine the MS mass we first determine the PS\/RS mass\nwith its error, proceeding as follows: we consider Mn\nfor n \u2208 {6, 8, 10, 12, 14} and obtain our central value by\nequating the theoretical and experimental value of the\nmoment at the standard scale \u00b5s = 2mb\/\n\u221a\nn. For the\nerror in the determination of the threshold masses we\nconsider three sources: the experimental error, the error\ndue to the uncertainty in the strong coupling and finally\nthe theoretical error.\nThe experimental error, \u2206exp, is simply determined\nby extracting the value for mb for the two extreme val-\nues of the experimental moment. The error due to the\nuncertainty in the strong coupling, \u2206\u03b1, is obtained by\nstudying the effect on the extracted bottom quark mass\nif we vary 0.115 < \u03b1s(MZ) < 0.121. Following common\npractise one would estimate the theoretical error, \u2206th,\nby variation of the scale by a factor of two. As is obvi-\nous from Figure 1, for small scales the theoretical result\ncannot be trusted. Therefore, in previous analyses, the\nscale variation was limited to scale choices above a cer-\ntain cutoff, typically set to a value around 2 GeV. In the\ncurrent analysis we refrain from using such an estimate.\nThere are several reasons. First, such an error estimate\ndepends crucially on the somewhat arbitrary lower cutoff\nof the scale variation. Second, it does not take into ac-\ncount the fact that the higher-order corrections are siz-\nable. Given that the scale dependence is very modest\n(for reasonably large scales) compared to the size of the\nNNLL corrections, we think that such an error analysis\nwould considerably underestimate the theoretical error in\nthe present case. Finally, the scale variation as depicted\nin Figure 1 does not take into account the independent\nvariation of the ultrasoft scale, since in our analysis the\nlatter is determined by the soft scale. It would be prefer-\nable to be able to vary all scales independently to ob-\ntain a better estimate of the uncertainty, in particular\nsince some ultrasoft logarithms are missing in our result.\nWe have verified that a naive variation of \u00b5us results in\na rather large uncertainty which, however, is consistent\nwith the final error estimate we propose. Therefore, we\nprefer to determine the theoretical error by taking half\nthe size of the highest-order correction that is included in\nour result. More precisely, we determine two values for\nmb by equating the experimental and theoretical value\n(at the scale for which it reaches its maximum) of the\nmoment at NNLL and NLL respectively. The error is de-\ntermined as half the difference between these two values.\nThis procedure assumes a perturbative series where suc-\ncessive terms become less and less important. For this\nto hold we have to use a threshold mass, since for the\npole mass the NNLL corrections are much larger than\nthe NLL ones. In this respect moments with low val-\nues of n and\/or threshold mass definitions with values\nclose to the MS mass are better behaved. On the other\nhand, the actual size of the correction, and therefore the\nassigned error, increases for such mass definitions.\nWe summarize our results in Table I, where we also\nshow the combined error, \u2206tot, which is obtained by\nadding the various errors in quadrature. As expected, the\nexperimental error decreases with increasing n. The re-\nsults are all consistent with each other, in particular if we\ntake into account the additional uncertainty mentioned\nabove for Mn with n \u2264 8, due to the non-relativistic\nexpansion in the energy integration.

The corresponding value for the MS mass with\nits error is given in the last column.\nwe note that in computing the moments we do not use\nthe exact fixed-order coefficient at O(\u03b12s ), since we drop\nterms of O(\u03b12s \/(\n\u221a\nn)k) with k \u2265 1. Again, this neglect is\npotentially more of a problem for smaller moments. Let\nus also reiterate that for too large values of n the applica-\nbility of weak coupling perturbation theory is question-\nable. We thus combine the results of Table I by simply\ntaking the value obtained by the tenth moment\nmb,PS(2GeV) = 4.52\u00b1 0.06 GeV, (6)\nmb,RS(2GeV) = 4.37\u00b1 0.07 GeV. (7)\nNote that the PS value is consistent with the result of\nRef. [5], but prefers smaller values for mb and has a re-\nduced error.\nConverting the PS and RS mass to the MS-mass we\nobtain mb = 4.19 GeV with an error of 55 MeV and\n60 MeV respectively. However, we also have to take into\naccount the error in the conversion itself. We consider\ntwo sources, the dependence of mb on the threshold mass\nused in the analysis and second, the error due to miss-\ning higher-order corrections in the conversion formula it-\nself. To determine the first error, we start by noting\nthat the mb values obtained with the PS and RS scheme\nare very similar. We also extract the central value of\nmb,PS\/RS(1 GeV) for the moments and convert these re-\nsults to mb. These values of mb differ at most by around\n20\/15 MeV from the corresponding results obtained via\nmb,PS\/RS(2 GeV). To obtain an estimate for the error\ndue to missing higher-order corrections in the conversion\nformula we drop the fourth order terms in the conversion\nand take as error the difference in the value of mb thus\nobtained. This error is about 10\/5 MeV. We thus asso-\nciate a total error of 20\/15 MeV to the conversion. If\nadded in quadrature to the 55\/60 MeV error, we obtain\na total error for mb of around 60 MeV in both cases.\nIn conclusion, we have studied the effect of resumming\nlogarithms for non-relativistic sum rules. The logarithms\nturn out to be numerically very important and improve\nthe reliability of the theoretical computation. This man-\nifests itself in a reduced scale dependence and an im-\nprovement of the convergence of the perturbative series.\nIt allows us to obtain an accurate value for the MS bot-\ntom quark mass using a credible error estimate\nmb(mb) = 4.19\u00b1 0.06GeV. (8)\nAt this stage, the main problem appears to be the large\nsize of the perturbative corrections and to understand its\norigin. Further improvements require the full NNLL com-\nputation of the sum rule, especially the potentially large\nultrasoft effects. Obviously, the inclusion of all NNNLO\neffects will also be important and might lead to a better\ncontrol of the strong scale dependence for small values of\n\u00b5s and the large size of the perturbative corrections.\nAcknowledgements.
