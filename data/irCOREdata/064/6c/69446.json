In the European Union, for \nexample, the requirement agreed on by the Community in 1995 is that all its citizens \nshould acquire proficiency in at least two foreign languages. It is therefore of great \nrelevance that learners with special educational needs are also provided with equal \nand appropriate opportunities to learn a second or foreign language. Most language \nteachers, however, are not in the position to cope with the special needs of these \nstudents for several reasons. First of all, they frequently lack the knowledge about the \nnature of their students\u2019 special educational needs. Secondly, they are not aware of \naffective and cognitive strategies which disadvantaged students use to overcome the \ndifficulties that language learning poses for them. Finally, teachers are not equipped \nwith the appropriate language teaching tools including techniques, tasks and \nmaterials, to help these learners (Smith 2008). Despite the apparent need for studies \non the process of language acquisition for learners with special needs, the field of \nsecond language acquisition has neglected language learners with dyslexia. Most of \nthe research in this field has concentrated on the cognitive and linguistic differences \nbetween students with learning disabilities (LD) and learners with no apparent sign of \nLD and has been quantitative in nature (for recent studies see Ndlovu and Geva 2008; \nSparks, Ganschow, and Patton 2008). Although it is important to understand the \nlanguage processing differences between students with LD and no LD, gaining an \ninsight into the language learning experiences of dyslexic students also has great \n 3 \nrelevance for the language teaching profession. The perspectives of students with \ndyslexia can help teachers understand what kind of experience it is to study a foreign \nlanguage when one has reading disability and what kinds of teacher behavior, \nteaching techniques and methods of assessment might assist these learners to \nsuccessfully acquire an L2. \n The situation of dyslexic students Hungary is interesting for a number of \nreasons. First of all, the orthography of the Hungarian language is highly transparent; \ntherefore a high number of dyslexic students with good compensatory skills remain \nundiagnosed, and their reading disability only becomes apparent when they start \nlearning foreign languages, especially English (Gyarmathy and Vassn\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs 2004). \nThe other reason is that Hungary is largely dependent on international investments \nand foreign trade; therefore it is almost impossible to find a well-paying job if one \ndoes not speak at least one foreign language. In addition, a certificate of intermediate \nlevel of proficiency in a foreign language is also a pre-requisite for obtaining a \nuniversity degree.  \n The aim of our study was to provide an insider\u2019s account of the language \nlearning experiences of Hungarian students with dyslexia. For this purpose we \nconducted long qualitative interviews with 15 students who studied foreign languages \nin a variety of educational settings such as mainstream schools, schools specialized in \nlearning disabilities and courses in language schools. The participants also varied as \nregards their age, profession and the time of diagnosis of their dyslexia. We hope that \nthe large variety of participants can give a comprehensive overview of what kind of \nexperience it is to study an L2 in a foreign language setting when one has dyslexia. \nWe also believe that since language teachers in many other parts of the world rarely \nreceive training in teaching foreign languages to students with LD (see Smith 2008), \n 4 \nour results are also relevant for the field of language pedagogy in a number of \ncountries.  \nBackground to the study \n \nAlthough the field of dyslexia and learning disability research has been \nplagued by a lack of agreement on what dyslexia and learning disabilities are, the \ndefinition of the International Dyslexia Association, which we endorse for the \npurposes of the present study, seems to represent a consensus in the field (see e.g. \nFletcher, Lyon, Fuchs, and Barnes 2007): \nDyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin. It is \ncharacterized by difficulties with accurate and\/or fluent word recognition and \nby poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from \na deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in \nrelation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom \ninstruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading \ncomprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of \nvocabulary and background knowledge (cited in Lyon, Shaywitz, and \nShaywitz 2003, 1). \n \nDyslexic learners are likely to encounter a large number of problems when \nlearning foreign languages (Downey, Snyder, and Hill 2000; Ganschow, Sparks, and \nJavorsky 1998; Kormos and Kontra 2008; Sparks et al. 2008). Moreover, students \nwith dyslexia often suffer from their environment\u2019s reaction to their special situation \nas well. Ignorance about learning disabilities also aggravates the situation of dyslexic \nstudents. Most people have vague ideas about the causes of dyslexia, and they often \nconsider it a sign of low intelligence (Ranaldi 2003), which results in the \n 5 \nstigmatization of dyslexics (Gyarmathy and Vassn\u00e9 2004). Edwards\u2019 (1994) study \nillustrates the negative experiences of dyslexic students at school and reveals that \neven successful and confident dyslexic students experience unfair treatment, \ndiscrimination, neglect and humiliation during school years (see also Sarkadi 2005).  \nLinguistic problems and the negative experiences in the foreign language \nlessons also decrease the language learning motivation of students with dyslexia \n(Kormos and Kontra 2008). As \u2018the education-friendly\u2019 approaches in motivation \nresearch emphasize, teachers play an essential role in motivating students (Brown \n1990, 1994; Crookes and Schmidt 1991; D\u00f6rnyei 1994, 2001a; Oxford and Shearin \n1996; Schmidt, Boraie, and Kassabgy 1996; Williams and Burden 1997). Empirical \nevidence for teachers\u2019 behavior affecting students\u2019 motivation was provided by Noels, \nCl\u00e9ment and Pelletier (1999), who investigated how teachers\u2019 communicative style \nwas related to L2 motivation. Their results showed that extrinsic and intrinsic \nmotivation was influenced by the teacher\u2019s communicative style to a different degree. \nIn a longitudinal qualitative study conducted in a Hungarian primary school, Nikolov \n(1999) found that that children were mainly motivated by factors associated with the \nclassroom situation (i.e., positive attitudes towards the learning context and the \nteacher as well as intrinsically motivated activities, tasks, and materials). In \nconnection with students\u2019 losing their motivation to learn the foreign language, \nD\u00f6rnyei (2005) pointed out that \u201cthe majority of demotives identified in past research \nconcern some aspects of classroom experience \u2018owned\u2019 by, or under the control of, \nthe teacher\u201d (p. 90). In line with this, one of the aims of the \u2018educational shift\u2019 in the \nL2 motivation field has been to give teachers practical help on how to arouse and \nsustain students\u2019 motivation. To fulfill this aim, various lists of motivational strategies \nwere compiled based on teaching experience and existing literature (e.g., Brown \n 6 \n1994; Dodick 1996; D\u00f6rnyei 1994, 2001b; D\u00f6rnyei and Csiz\u00e9r 1998; Oxford and \nShearin 1994; Williams and Burden 1997).  \nOur study is novel in several respects. Language learners\u2019 perspectives of the \ncircumstances of their learning processes in foreign language classrooms have not yet \nbeen explored despite the fact that information about students\u2019 learning experiences \ncan greatly contribute to effective and motivating instructional practices. Our \nparticipants constitute a special group of students: learners with dyslexia, for whom \nmotivational teaching is highly relevant in order to compensate for their effortful and \noften problematic language learning processes. The research presented in this paper \nseeks to answer the following questions: \n1. What characterizes the language learning experiences of dyslexic \nstudents concerning the group they study in? \n2. How do dyslexic students view their teachers\u2019 general behavior and \ninstructional and assessment methods? \nResearch method  \nParticipants \n \nSome of the participants volunteered for the interviews in response to an \nadvertisement recruiting dyslexic language learners who were willing to speak about \ntheir language learning experience. Other respondents were recommended by teachers \nor speech therapists working with dyslexic students. All students held an official \ndocument that certified the diagnosis of dyslexia. The students\u2019 dyslexia was \nidentified with the use of the GMP test (G\u00f3sy 1995) and Meixner\u2019s reading test \n(published in Juh\u00e1sz 1999).1 Meixner\u2019s reading test consists of a letter naming, a \nsyllable reading, word reading and a short-text reading task, which are all scored in \n 7 \nterms of speed and accuracy. The criterion for being identified as dyslexic is that the \nstudent achieves a score that is below the established standard on both of these tests. \nIn the interviews the participants all reported experiencing severe difficulties in \nacquiring literacy skills in their first language, which further supports the fact that \nthey can indeed be considered dyslexic. We tried to achieve maximum variety in \nsampling the participants; therefore in selecting the interviewees, we considered their \nage, age of identification, level of language knowledge and the therapy they received \nin their native language. The participants also differed in whether their problems were \nattended to by their foreign language teachers. Table 1 summarizes the relevant \ncharacteristics of the participants. Out of our 15 respondents five were girls, 10 boys \nwith an average age of 18. The majority of them (12 participants) was learning \nEnglish as a first foreign language, and the three participants whose first L2 was \nGerman also took up English during their studies. Despite foreign language learning \ndifficulties, there was only one student who did not study a second foreign language \n(L3). It has to be noted that in Hungary students in elementary school (between the \nages of 7 and 14) are obliged to study one foreign language, and above the age of 14, \nin secondary school they have to choose an additional foreign language.2 Dyslexic \nstudents can, however, be exempted from studying a second foreign language. The \naverage age of diagnosis was 13.7 years, which indicates that most of our respondents \nhad to study a foreign language at school without their and their teachers\u2019 being fully \naware of their dyslexia. As can be seen in Table 1,  8 participants attended mainstream \nprimary and secondary schools, and  one student went to a mainstream primary \nschool, which, however,had special classes for students with LD. One of the \nparticipants studied in a mainstream secondary school, in which there was a special \nlanguage teaching program for learners with LD. Two interviewees attended a special \n 8 \ncombined primary and secondary school for learners with LD, and three students \nattended a special secondary school for learners with LD.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \nProcedures \n \nThe research presented in this paper is part of an extensive interview study, \nwhich investigated Hungarian dyslexic students\u2019 feelings and experiences about \nlanguage learning and examined the language learning strategies these students \napplied to overcome their difficulties in language learning. The interview guide used \nin the extensive research was compiled on the basis of the relevant literature \nconcerning the experiences, difficulties and learning strategies of dyslexic learners \n(Kormos and Kontra 2008; Ormos 2004; Schneider and Crombie 2003; Sparks and \nGanschow 1993). \nThe interview guide consisted of 15 questions, which focused on four main \ntopics: participants\u2019 problems in every day life and in the native language resulting \nfrom their dyslexia, language learning experiences, language learning difficulties and \ncoping strategies and motivational characteristics. The instrument was piloted with \ntwo students, and minor modifications were made to the interview guide after \npiloting. The interviews were conducted in Hungarian and lasted for approximately 40 \nminutes. The interviews were recorded and transcribed by one of the authors and a \ntrained research assistant. \n The interview transcripts yielded about 60,000 words of data, which were first \nanalysed independently by the three authors for the themes related to our research \nquestions. Once the themes found relevant by all the researchers were agreed on, \n 9 \ndefinitions of the categories of analysis were worded based on the analysis of the first \nfive interviews. The first two authors then coded all the utterances separately, \nfollowing which certain modifications were made in some of the categories, and the \nwording of the definitions was fine-tuned. Discrepancies between the analyses of the \ntwo authors were discussed until a full agreement was reached. In analyzing our data \nwe used the data analysis software MAXQDA 2007. The analyses yielded the \nfollowing categories: \n1. Experiences in the learning group \u2013 students\u2019views and experiences with other \nlearners in the group, their role in the group e.g. \u201cI was afraid of making \nmistakes in front of the others and being laughed at\u201d (L1767). \n2. Attitudes to the teachers  \na) The teacher\u2019s general behavior in class \u2013 overall opinion about the \nteacher\u2019s personality and general conduct in class e.g. \u201cShe only liked \nstudents who were bright and easy to deal with, and those who were \nthe difficult cases were failed.\u201d (P82) \nb) The method of teaching\/tasks\/materials used in class \u2013 comments \nrelated to what methods, tasks and materials the teacher used in the \nforeign language class e.g. \u201cThe lessons were not interesting; we \nalways followed the book and sometimes we solved tasks on \nphotocopied sheets.\u201d (P102) \nc) Assessment \u2013 grading, error correction, dyslexic accommodations e.g. \n\u201cMy teacher deducted points in tests for incorrect spelling, but I did not \nmind because I usually got good grades anyway.\u201d (B327) \nResults and discussion \n \nExperiences in the learning group \n 10 \n \n Due to their dyslexia, many of our participants had negative experiences in the \nlanguage learning group, which in the Hungarian context generally means half of a \nclass as students study foreign languages in groups of 10-15. The students\u2019 difficulties \nin learning in groups in mainstream education were mainly caused by their different \npace and style of learning. One of the participants told us that:  \nI have attended various courses. In groups where there were many students no \nattention was paid to individual needs; the teacher taught the material and \neverybody tried to learn as much as they could. After a while I was the last one \nin the group, and I said thank you, I am not coming any more. Then I went to a \ncourse with a small group. There the problem was that we were not at the same \nlevel. So people who had no difficulties learnt the material very easily, and \nthen I was lagging behind the others again. (B477-478) \nThis quote suggests that many students with dyslexia find it difficult to follow the \ngeneral pace of teaching in language courses because \u201cstudents with dyslexia have \ndifferent abilities and skills than other learners, and therefore they acquire the same \nknowledge in different ways\u201d (D647). Therefore they feel that they lag behind the \nothers, and that they are left alone in this difficult and effortful learning process. The \nconstant sense of failure in a group might finally result in giving up learning \nlanguages altogether or in a better case, students might continue studying with a \nprivate tutor, which as shown below, many of our participants found useful and \nenjoyable. Being paid attention to is an aspect of teaching that students with dyslexia \nregard very important (see below), therefore the participants who were learning in \ngroups at school preferred small group size. \nIn elementary school there were 25-30 students in the German group, and the \nteacher could not pay close attention to individual students. So I like English \n 11 \nbetter because here there are only 11 students, and the teacher pays more \nattention. (M2142) \n The experiences of some of our participants who study in schools specialized \nin LD are slightly different. Two of our interviewees in specialized schools did not \nmention any problems they experienced in learning in groups, which in all likelihood \nis due to the fact that their special needs and individual strengths and weaknesses \nwere taken into account. Two of the students in a specialized school setting, however, \n had relatively higher levels of proficiency than their peers due to family resources \nand their increased interest in languages. These learners could not participate in the \nlife of the group because the language teacher did not use differential teaching in the \nclassroom. As one of them told us, \u201cif I was asked questions, I answered, otherwise I \nslept, I was daydreaming and sometimes studied other subjects.\u201d (N1513).  This \nindicates that dyslexic students have different language learning profiles and abilities, \nand even if they study in compensatory classes and in specialized schools, their \nindividual needs and proficiency level need to be taken into consideration.  \n Another student who was exempted from the evaluation of her performance in \nforeign languages in a mainstream school complained about the lack of understanding \non the part of her peers. This quote below illustrates that for many dyslexic students \nwho study in mainstream classrooms exemption from language learning is not a relief, \nbut an emotional burden: \n It is not the teachers who are upset about my exemption but the students. They \nthink that this is a kind of alibi, and it is easier for me. This is not true, it is \nreally a burden that there is a thing that you will never really be able to do well \nin your life. (H1130). \n 12 \n Positive experiences relating to the language learning group were hardly ever \nmentioned by our participants in mainstream education. Only two interviewees \nexpressed the view that the group they study in is motivating, and as their peers take \nlearning seriously, they also invest a sufficient amount of energy into studying. \n The interview data indicate that the different learning profile of the \ninterviewed dyslexic students causes problems for most of them when they study in \ngroups. If they learn in a mainstream school or in a commercial language course, they \ncannot keep pace with other group members, and they lack the attention of the \nteacher. In mainstream schools, students also experience the lack of understanding on \nthe part of their peers, which might seriously undermine their self-confidence and \nmight finally lead to giving up language learning. On the other hand, in specialized \nschools the needs of proficient learners are not catered to. It is probably partly due to \nthese group-related experiences that most of our interviewees preferred learning \nlanguages with a private tutor (see below).  \n \nTeachers\u2019 general behaviour, instructional practices and assessment \n \nWhen examining students\u2019 views of their language teachers\u2019 general behaviour and \ninstructional practices in class, we analyzed the students\u2019 comments concerning their \nprivate tutors and their language teachers at school separately. First we discuss \nstudents\u2019 general experiences with their language teachers at school.  \nOur data reveal that dyslexic students have a \u201cblack-and white\u201d picture of their \nteachers, they either display a rather negative attitude to them or a fairly positive one. \nStudents\u2019 utterances concerning their teachers\u2019 personality and general conduct in \nclass either fell in the category that denoted students\u2019 approval and appreciation of \n 13 \ntheir language teachers (positive attitude e.g. \u201cI have a private teacher, who is \nexcellent. I really like her. (H1092)), or in the one that contained comments \nexpressing disapproval and dissatisfaction (negative attitude e.g. \u201cThe teacher does \nnot like me because I am not good at English. So I don\u2019t like her either\u201d (J1393)). No \nneutral comment was found in the data set. Our interviewees made exactly the same \nnumber of positive and negative comments concerning their language teachers at \nschool (& = 28). If we examine the number of respondents\u2019 comments individually, \nwe can see that altogether 3 out the 15 students did not express negative attitude to \ntheir teachers. It seems that probably due to their learning problems, our participants \nare very sensitive to their teachers\u2019 general behaviour in class. As we will show \nbelow, if they find that their teacher accepts their dyslexia and is helpful, they have \npositive attitude towards them, but when they experience lack of understanding, \nintolerance and sometimes humiliation, they display negative views. \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \n Students\u2019 negative views concerning their teachers\u2019 behaviour covered a range \nof issues. One of the participants told us that his language teacher recommended that \nhe got an exemption from language learning. The teacher\u2019s referral to the educational \nadvisory centre was made due to the student\u2019s behaviour in language class (\u201cThe \nGerman teacher said that she cannot tolerate my and three of my mates behaviour \nanymore, and we should go and get an exemption in this and that street where the \neducation advisory centre is\u201d A43-44). The situation of this student illustrates that \nstudents with dyslexia often misbehave in foreign language classes due to their \nconstant experience of failure and the teacher\u2019s inappropriate reaction to their learning \ndisability (Kormos and Kontra 2008). One possible reaction on the part of the teacher \n 14 \nto this situation can be exempting the student, which solves the problem of \nmisbehaviour for the teacher, but it seriously disadvantages the student.  \nTeachers\u2019 negative reaction to dyslexia manifested itself in different ways. \nOne of the interviewees who was a late identified dyslexic recounted the experience \nwhen his first teacher told him \u201cthat\u2019s it for you, you are going to fail\u201d (F816). This \nincident had serious detrimental effect on the student\u2019s attitude to language learning \nand his motivation to study English. Another student explained that \u201cthey did not try \nto help me, but they emphasized that I am having problems, but not like wanting to \nhelp me but as a kind of humiliation\u201d (H1061). She also mentioned that her language \nteacher regarded her exemption from language learning as an excuse that she did not \nhave to deal with the student\u2019s language learning problems. One participant told us \nthat despite the fact that his parents consulted with the English teacher concerning his \ndyslexia, she still did not take it into consideration; in the student\u2019s words: \u201cshe did \nnot care\u201d (J1407). These instances of negative teacher behavior illustrate the lack of \nthe teacher\u2019s awareness of the nature and severity of problems dyslexia can cause in \nlanguage learning, which in turn can increase the stress and anxiety a dyslexic student \nmight experience in the foreign language classroom.  \nIn contrast with the varied nature of negative views concerning the teachers\u2019 \nbehavior, the positive comments centered around very similar themes. Several \ninterviewees mentioned that their teacher was helpful (& = 4), kind and friendly (& = \n3) and paid special attention to them (& = 4). From the comments it is apparent that a \nhelpful attitude and special attention to the student was very highly valued by the \nparticipants. Other positive characteristics of teachers included being reasonably strict \nand demanding. The characteristics the students listed mainly belong to what Brophy \n(1987) calls essential pre-conditions for motivational teaching practice and indicate \n 15 \nthe importance dyslexic students attribute to supportive teacher attitude in the \nlanguage learning classroom. \nAs regards their private teachers\u2019 general behavior, all the comments of the \neight students who had private tutors were positive. The participants found that the \npace of learning was adjusted to their needs: \u201cI could study at my own pace, and the \nteacher adapted to me, and it was not me who had to adapt.\u201d (N2242) The importance \nof being able to study at their own pace is also confirmed by interviews conducted \nwith language teachers, who all mentioned that students with dyslexia are slower in \nlanguage learning in general due to problems in memorizing L2 words, word \ndecoding, global text comprehension, writing and  spelling (Kormos and Kontra, \n2008). As we have shown above, the learning experiences of dyslexic students in a \ngroup are often negative because they cannot keep up with the progress of their peers, \nand therefore it is understandable that they enjoy learning with a private tutor, from \nwhom they get all the attention and who adjusts the pace and teaching materials to \ntheir needs.  \n Among the utterances describing the language teaching methods of school \nteachers, we find negative comments concerning the teacher\u2019s ability to explain \nlinguistic rules (& = 3) and the lack of interesting tasks and texts (& = 2). Two \nstudents mentioned that they only studied grammar, which they found very boring, \nand another two participants noted that they had to rote learn a lot of irrelevant words \nout of context. Three participants told us that the school teacher was progressing too \nfast, and they were unable to acquire the taught material within such short period of \ntime. The positive comments expressed exactly the opposite, namely the teacher\u2019s \nskill in explaining the rules of the language, interesting tasks and materials, and slow \npace of learning.  \n 16 \n Concerning their private teachers, the participants also noted that what they \nvalued was that their tutor could explain things very well. They also mentioned that \ntheir teacher helped them to achieve that \u201cwhatever they study is really deeply \nlearned, and it does not become some sort of superficial knowledge\u201d (B464). Another \nparticipant explained that she liked that \u201cthe teacher revises the material several \ntimes\u201d (H1093). Three of the participants had a private tutor, who had formal training \nin teaching languages to students with dyslexia, and these interviewees all found that \nthe \u201cdyslexic teaching techniques\u201d such as multi-sensory instruction (MSL) (Sparks et \nal. 1998; Nijakowska 2008) were very helpful. The students\u2019 views of what they \nconsider important and useful in the teaching practice of their private tutors are very \nsimilar to what language teachers working with dyslexic students regard as essential \n(Kormos and Kontra, 2008): namely slow, step-by-step acquisition of linguistic \nconstructions and L2 vocabulary, and constant revision. These essential components \nof teaching foreign languages to dyslexic students are also part of MSL instruction. \nStudents\u2019 enhanced need for clear explanations both in school and private language \nlessons can probably be explained with reference to the fact that students with \ndyslexia find it very difficult to deduce linguistic rules from the input (Schneider and \nCrombie 2003). Therefore whether they understand the use of a given linguistic \nconstruction is largely dependent on how their teacher can explain it to them. \n As regards the assessment of the performance of students with LD, we found \nseveral different cases. In the case of two participants, teachers did not take into \nconsideration the student\u2019s dyslexia in assessment, which resulted in low grades and a \nlarge discrepancy between their performance in written and oral tests. Among the \nparticipants whose dyslexia was identified only when they finished their studies in \npublic education, one student compensated for her dyslexia by studying extremely \n 17 \nhard, therefore she did not mention negative experiences with assessment. The other \ninterviewee told us that despite being an excellent student in other subjects, she failed \nin English in secondary school. She had to retake all the subjects of the second year of \ngrammar school just because she was not able to pass the end of year retake exam in \nEnglish. She described the experience in the following words, \u201cIn the other subjects I \nhad really good grades, so the teachers did not understand this whole situation. \nNeither did my school-mates.\u201d (C468). There was only one student who despite being \nentitled to accommodations in language learning, did not take advantage of them \nbecause he felt that he did not need them.  \nAs we mentioned above, the teacher of one of our participants did not consider \nthe student\u2019s dyslexia in assessment despite the recommendations of the educational \nadvisory center and the parents\u2019 explicit request. As a result of this unfair treatment, \nthe student started to develop classroom language learning anxiety (Horwitz, Horwitz \n& Cope, 1986): \nBefore the lessons I always look for the teacher in the corridor. I always hope \nthat she won\u2019t come. The other thing that I always check is whether she has \nbrought some tests with her. (J 1352) \n Three of our participants were completely exempted from the evaluation of \ntheir performance in language classes. Only one of the teachers of these three \nparticipants made the student write the tests in class and corrected them without \ngrading them. The rest of the teachers regarded exemption as an official excuse not to \nhave to deal with the student in the foreign language class, which reveals that a \nnumber of language teachers are not prepared to handle the problem of exemption in a \nway that benefits the learners. Five of the students received accommodations, which \neither entailed an exemption from the evaluation of their written work in general or \n 18 \nnot considering spelling in evaluation. All the participants who received these \naccommodations found them as means of appropriate help in their language studies. \nOne of our interviewees expressed her opinion about this in the following way: \nMy Hebrew teacher did not get any training in teaching dyslexics, but he does \nnot consider spelling and that\u2019s it. This was all I needed and now I can speak \none more language\u2026 So if your spelling is not assessed, it will be easier for \nyou, and you don\u2019t have butterflies in your stomach anymore that my God, I \nhave to get this right. Once you are relieved of this stress, you will do better. It \nwill be much better. (I1286-1288)   \nThe comment of this participant reveals that for dyslexic students written assessment, \nespecially the grading of spelling, might be an important source of language learning \nanxiety, and often once this stressor is removed, they can achieve success in language \nlearning.  \nOur participants\u2019 views concerning their language teachers\u2019 general behavior, \nteaching and assessment practices reveal that students with dyslexia are very sensitive \nto and well aware of what constitutes effective teaching practice. If we compare \nfeatures of teacher behavior and instructional methods mentioned by our interviewees \nwith the list of elements of motivational teaching practice (D\u00f6rnyei 2001a) and \neffective teaching (Brophy 1987; Creemers 1994), we can find a large overlap. From \nthe lists proposed in the general educational literature and language pedagogy, our \ndyslexic participants highly value teacher enthusiasm, supportive attitude, opportunity \nto learn, appropriate goal setting, relevant and interesting teaching materials, clarity of \npresentation, appropriate pace of learning and assessment methods that are adjusted to \ntheir disability. The interviewees also discussed how teacher behavior and \ninstructional practices affected their attitudes to language learning and self-perceived \n 19 \nrate of progress. When working with a teacher, whom they considered effective, a \nnumber of participants (& = 4) expressed that the teacher had a positive effect on their \nattitudes to language learning and in turn on their self-perceived rate of progress \n(e.g.,\u201cI had an excellent language teacher. When she was my teacher, I really liked \nEnglish and I progressed a lot.\u201d (J1341).  \nWhen conflicts arise, we can see the opposite effect: \nI did not get on well with the German teacher. It was not only me who had \nproblems, but the whole class. Her methods of teaching were not the best. This \nis why I found German classes difficult to follow, and learning the language \nwas difficult overall. So I did not like learning German\u201d (F587).  \nAnother participant used even stronger words to explain the relationship between \nteacher behavior and language learning attitudes: \u201cShe does not teach well. She kills \nthe love of the language in the students.\u201d (H1149). Our qualitative data indicates a \nstrong causal relationship between teacher behavior and language learning attitudes \nand also reveal that language learning attitudes influence motivated behavior (for \nmore detail on the relationship of motivation and teacher behavior, see Kormos, \nCsiz\u00e9r and Sarkadi, submitted ). As one of our interviewees said, \u201cI lost interest in the \nlanguage due to the teacher in secondary school, and so I did not really study much\u201d \n(D532).   \n \nAn emerging model of the language learning experiences of students with dyslexia \n \n From our analysis of the interview data, we can see an emerging model of the \nlanguage learning experiences of dyslexic students. Our qualitative results suggest \nthat the major factor that serves as primary determinant of the language learning \n 20 \nexperiences of dyslexic students is the teacher\u2019s attitude to dyslexia. This includes the \nteacher\u2019s awareness of the nature of problems dyslexia causes in language learning \nand attitudes to accommodations and exemptions available for dyslexic learners. The \nteacher\u2019s attitude to dyslexia influences the basic motivational conditions that are \ncreated by the teacher in the language classroom (see D\u00f6rnyei 2001b). Among the \nbasic motivational conditions, supportive atmosphere and special attention to the \ndyslexic students as well as the methods of assessment and teaching were perceived to \nbe the most important by our participants. From the students\u2019 experiences it is \napparent that if teachers are unaware of the problems dyslexia causes or refuse to take \ninto account the students\u2019 reading disability, the basic motivational conditions cannot \nbe established and testing and instructional procedures cannot be tailored to the \nstudents\u2019 needs.3 Based on the literature on language learning motivation (e.g. \nGuilloteaux and D\u00f6rnyei 2008; Nikolov 1999) and on our interview data, we can also \nhypothesize that the extent to which teachers are able to employ elements of \nmotivational teaching practice has an influence on students\u2019 self-confidence and \nlanguage learning anxiety (Price 1991) and through these on their language learning \nattitudes (see also Kormos et al., submitted). Finally, language learning attitudes \naffect motivated behavior, that is, the effort and energy students are willing to invest \nin language learning (see also D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r, and N\u00e9meth 2006). \nINSERT FIGURE 1 AROUND HERE \n \nConclusion and implications \n \nIn this paper we investigated the language learning experiences of Hungarian dyslexic \nstudents by means of long interviews. Our data reveal that the participants generally \n 21 \nhad negative experiences when studying in groups especially if the number of \nstudents in the group was high. They explained that due to their specific difficulties \nwith language learning, they could not keep pace with the other group members; \ntherefore they often felt isolated and sometimes even opted out from learning. A \ncomplementary finding of our research is that most participants enjoyed working with \na private tutor because they received special attention and the rate of progress was \nadjusted to their needs. The students\u2019 own perceptions of how they can learn an L2 \nmost effectively are in line with language teachers\u2019 views in another Hungarian study \n(Kormos and Kontra, 2008). On the basis of both the present study and the one \nconducted with teachers, we can conclude that it is highly important that special \ncompensatory groups should be formed for dyslexic learners where they can gain \nenough input, practice, knowledge, positive feedback and confidence (see also \nNijakowska 2008 for similar views in the Polish context). In mainstream education, \ncompensatory classes in a foreign language should be provided for students with \ndyslexia at the primary and secondary school levels and in higher education if the \ninstitution sets foreign language proficiency as a requirement. Alternatively, dyslexic \nstudents should be taught foreign languages in special groups where specific methods \n(e.g. multi-sensory instruction) that foster the development of L2 competence of \ndyslexic students are applied. \nThe interview data reveal that students with dyslexia are highly appreciative of \npositive teacher behavior and motivational instructional processes. Negative teacher \nattitudes and inappropriate teaching methods, however, can seriously undermine \nstudents\u2019 self-confidence and might cause language learning anxiety. The \ndeterioration of self-esteem and an increased level of anxiety might in turn result in \nnegative attitudes to language learning and lack of motivated behavior. The students\u2019 \n 22 \nviews confirm the high importance of applying motivational teaching strategies in \nteaching foreign languages to students with dyslexia and the existence of a an indirect \nlink between teachers\u2019 attitude to dyslexia, teacher behavior and language learning \neffort. In all probability, these results are not unique for students with dyslexia. Our \nresearch, however, suggests that among components of effective teaching practice, \nclear and well-structured explanations and constant revision received special emphasis \nin dyslexic students\u2019 evaluation of their language instruction.  The students\u2019 views \nalso show that adjusting the assessment procedures to the nature of the learner\u2019s \ndisability is also important as even minor accommodations can help students to \nachieve to their best potential, which in turn reduces their anxiety and enhances their \nattitudes to language learning. \nOur study highlights that it is of vital importance that language teachers be \naware of the fact that a child or an adolescent is dyslexic and that they also know what \ndifficulties dyslexia causes in the language learning process. Therefore, language \nteacher education should include at least a brief introduction to the nature of learning \nand more specifically reading disabilities and an overview of instruction and \nassessment techniques that can be used in teaching foreign languages to students with \ndyslexia. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors are grateful to the participants who devoted their time to sharing their \nexperiences with us. We thank \u00c9va Gyarmathy and Eszter Bakos for recruting \nparticipants. The research reported in this paper has been sponsored by the Equal \nRights in Foreign Language Education project of the Hungarian National Bureau of \nResearch and Technology (NKTH B2 2006-0010). \n 23 \n \n \n+otes \n1. The Hungarian data protection law does not allow access to student\u2019s psychological \ntests for out-side school use. Therefore we could only verify the existence of the \ndiagnosis but were not able to collect information on diagnostic test scores. \n2. Many of our participants gave up learning one foreign language in the hope that \nthey will succeed in the other one. Some of the interviewees had to choose another \nlanguage because they changed school, and the new school did not offer the language \nthe student previously studied. This explains the high number of students who studied \ntwo foreign languages. \n3. There was only one exception to this among our interviewees: a late identified \nstudent who was driven by her intrinsic motivation to acquire English, and who \ndespite the fact that her teachers were unaware of her dyslexia, enjoyed language \nlearning and compensated for her difficulties by studying extremely hard. She was, \nhowever, provided a lot of help in her family. \n \nReferences  \n \nBrophy, J. E. 1987. Synthesis of research on strategies for motivating students to \nlearn.
