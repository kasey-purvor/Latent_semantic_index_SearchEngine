The preferred regions within a \nscene are often inspected earlier and attract more fixations and longer viewing time \n(Henderson, 2003). This preference-biased gaze distribution is shown to have a causal \neffect on conscious preference decision making (Shimojo, Simion, Shimojo, & Scheier, \n2003). Gaze patterns hence provide a real-time behavior index of ongoing perceptual and \ncognitive processing, and could be sensitive indices of our attention, motivation, and \npreference, especially when exploring scenes of high ecological validity (Henderson, \n2003; Isaacowitz, 2006; Rayner, 1998).  \nCompared with those well studied cognitive processes, such as saccadic eye \nmovements in reading, scene perception and face perception, the gaze pattern in the \nprocess of body perception and sexual preference is less well documented. Sexual \npreference refers to a dispositional sexual attraction, usually towards mature humans, but \noccasionally directed to children, animals and non-living objects (Chivers & Bailey, \n2005). Assessing an individual\u2019s sexual preference is important for experimental research \nand clinical applications, for example, evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and \npredicting the likelihood of offence\/re-offence for individuals with a sexual offending \nhistory (Hanson & Morton-Bourgon, 2005). The conventional measurements, such as \nphallometric assessment and self report, often attract criticism that they are intrusive \n(e.g., phallometric assessment), susceptible to deception (e.g., self-report), and that they \nlead to high levels of false negative and false positive identifications (Flak, Beech, & \nFisher, 2007; Kalmus & Beech, 2005). Given the aforementioned unique characteristics \nPage 2 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 3 \nof gaze patterns, including its advantages over currently established methodologies \n(naturalistic and automatic, difficult to be inhibited or altered consciously) (Nummenmaa, \nHyona, & Calvo, 2006), it can help us to understand cognitive processing of visually \nsalient sexual information and may be a useful measure of sexual interest\/preference. \nAfter all, we need to attend to something before we can assess it for its attractiveness.  \nSeveral recent eye-tracking studies have suggested the use of gaze pattern \nanalysis (allocation of fixation and viewing time within images) in sexuality research. \nLykins, Meana and Kambe (2006) first revealed a different viewing pattern towards \nerotic and non-erotic images, with participants dedicating more fixations and longer \nviewing time to the bodies within erotic photos in comparison to non-erotic photos. They \nand other researchers later demonstrated a gender difference in visual processing of same \nand opposite sex bodies. The heterosexual men looked significantly longer at opposite \nsex figures in both erotic and non-erotic images, while heterosexual women distributed \ntheir visual attention evenly between opposite and same sex figures (Lykins, Meana, & \nStrauss 2008). Additionally, Rupp & Wallen (2007) demonstrated that women spent \nlonger viewing same-sex figures than men when presented with erotic photographs. \nThese findings demonstrate that cognitive differences in the way men and women \nappraise sexual stimuli can be evidenced at the visual level. Body region analysis further \nrevealed that both men and women tend to gaze at the chest and abdomen area when \njudging females\u2019 attractiveness and body fat (Cornelissen, Hancock, Kiviniemi, George, \n& Tovee, 2009; Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, & Miltner, 2008). Male observers also \ndirected more attention towards the waist-hip region in females with lower waist-to-hip \nratio, suggesting the importance of this region in body viewing (Suschinsky, Elias, & \nPage 3 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 4 \nKrupp, 2007). However, it remains unclear which specific body parts are crucial for \ninducing different gaze patterns in men and women, how viewers\u2019 gaze patterns vary as a \nfunction of gender and age of the viewed human figure, and to what degree the \ndifferential gaze distribution to the same and opposite sex figures could be accounted for \nby low-level local image properties and the role of attraction. \nIn this exploratory study we examined whether we could explicitly differentiate \nan individual\u2019s natural gaze pattern in viewing plain-clothed, full figure images of \ndifferent gender and age groups (infant, child, young-, middle- and older-adults), and to \nwhat degree this spontaneous gaze behavior is related to high-level mental process such \nas attractiveness judgments. As our gaze behavior is closely linked with perceptual and \ncognitive processing, it is likely that viewing of sexually preferred figures would elicit a \ndifferent distribution of fixations and viewing time within the figure images. We \nhypothesized that men and women would show a differential gaze strategy when viewing \npreferred and non-preferred figures, with this strategy also associated with body regions \nimportant for assessing sexual interest, and being related to the age of the viewed figure. \nFurthermore, we predicted that this differential gaze distribution would not be solely \ndetermined by low-level image salience (such as local image contrast and structure), but \nwould be associated with high-level cognitive processing such as judging attractiveness.  \nPage 4 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 5 \nMethod \nParticipants \nFifteen male and fifteen female undergraduate students, aged between 18 to 23 \nyears old (M = 19.94 years, SD = 1.05), participated in this study in return for course \ncredit. All participants were white and British ethnic origin with uncorrected normal \nvisual acuity. All Participants reported heterosexual orientation and a preference for age-\nmatched sexual partners (assessed by self-report). To control for possible hormonal \ninfluences on visual attention (Rupp & Wallen, 2007), all women were using oral \ncontraceptives. Informed consent was obtained from each participant, and ethical \napproval was obtained from a departmental ethics committee. \n \nProcedure \nDigitized grey scale images were presented through a ViSaGe graphics system \n(Cambridge Research Systems) and displayed on a gamma-corrected color monitor (30.0 \ncd\/m2 background luminance, 100 Hz frame rate, Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2070SB) with \nthe resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels. At a viewing distance of 57 cm the monitor subtended \na visual angle of 40 \u00d7 30\u00b0.  \n Presented images, sampled from fashion catalogues, were 50 full-body figures of \nwhite ethnic origin and included five age groups: babies, pre-pubescent children around \n10 years old, adults in their early twenties, adults in their late thirties or early forties, and \nadults in their sixties (10 images per age group with equal proportion of each gender). All \nfigures were plain-clothed in summer or sports wear and portrayed with either neutral or \nhappy facial expressions. We did not choose naked figures as clothed pictures are more \nPage 5 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 6 \ncommon in our daily environment, and most individuals\u2019 first feelings of romantic \nattraction towards someone occur when the person is clothed (Lykins et al., 2008). All \nthe images were gamma-corrected and displayed once in a pseudo-random order at the \ncentre of the screen with a resolution of 600 \u00d7 300 pixels (22 \u00d7 11\u00b0). \nDuring the experiments the participants sat in a chair with their head restrained by \na chin rest, and viewed the display binocularly. To calibrate eye movement signals, a \nsmall red fixation point (FP, 0.2\u00b0 diameter, 15 cd\/m2 luminance) was displayed randomly \nat one of 25 positions (5 \u00d7 5 matrix) across the monitor. The distance between adjacent FP \npositions was 6\u00b0. The participant was instructed to follow the FP and maintain fixation \nfor 1 s. After the calibration procedure, the trial was started with a FP displayed on the \ncentre of monitor. If the participant maintained fixation for 1 s, the FP disappeared and a \nimage was then presented for 5 s. The participant passively viewed the images with the \ntask instruction of \u201cviewing the pictures as you normally do\u201d. It was considered that in \nthe absence of instrumental responding, our participants\u2019 viewing behavior should be as \nnatural as possible. The inter-trial interval was set to 1.5 s. \nHorizontal and vertical eye positions were measured using a Video Eyetracker \nToolbox with 50Hz sampling frequency and up to 0.25\u00b0 accuracy (Cambridge Research \nSystems). The software developed in Matlab computed horizontal and vertical eye \ndisplacement signals as a function of time to determine eye velocity and position. \nFixation locations were then extracted from the raw eye tracking data using velocity (less \nthan 0.2\u00b0 eye displacement at a velocity of less than 20\u00b0\/s) and duration (greater than 50 \nms) criteria (Guo, Mahmoodi, Robertson, & Young, 2006).  \n \nPage 6 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 7 \nData Analysis \nWhile determining fixation and viewing time allocation within images, we \ndivided each figure into four different feature regions: face (including hair and neck), \nupper body (from the base of the neck to the end of the rib cage), waist-hip region \n(including the stomach, hips and pubic region) and limbs. Each fixation was then \ncharacterized by its location among feature regions and its time of onset relative to the \nstart of the trial. To calculate the proportion of fixation and viewing time allocated at \neach feature region, two commonly used measurements in eye tracking studies to indicate \nthe amount of interest and processed information by the viewers (Henderson, 2003), the \nnumber of fixations and associated viewing time (sum of individual fixation durations) \ndirected at each feature region, was normalized to the total number of fixations and total \nviewing time sampled in that trial.  \nAs the same feature region across different figures may vary in size (i.e., babies \nusually have larger \u2018face\u2019 area than adults), the proportion of the areas of a particular \nfigure feature relative to the whole image was subtracted from the proportion of fixations \nand viewing time directed at that figure feature in a given trial. Any difference in fixation \ndistribution and viewing time from zero means that this particular figure feature attracted \nmore or less fixations than predicted by a uniform viewing strategy (Dahl, Wallraven, \nBulthoff, & Logothetis, 2009; Guo, Tunnicliffe, & Roebuck, 2010). Thus, negative \nvalues demonstrate less viewing than predicted by region size, and positive values \ndemonstrate more viewing than predicted by region size. \nDuring the analysis, for each participant we averaged fixation and viewing time \ndistribution sampled from figures with participants\u2019 preferred gender and non-preferred \nPage 7 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 8 \ngender, and\/or preferred age and non-preferred age. All our 20-year-old participants \nreported heterosexual orientation and 20-year-old as their preferred age of sexual partner. \nPreferred gender referred to the opposite sex image to the participant, and preferred age \nreferred to results from 20-year-old images. Unless specified in the results section, a \nseries of repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to compare \nfixation and viewing time allocation across different types of figure images. Typically, \nparticipant gender was the between-subjects variable, with gender preference, age, and \nbody region as within-subjects variables.  For each ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser \ncorrections were applied where sphericity was violated. Follow-up tests were conducted \nin the form of planned comparisons to investigate interaction effects, and post-hoc test \nwith Bonferroni correction for main effects where necessary. For the analysis applied in \nthe study of image attractiveness, we utilised a Friedman test. \n \nPage 8 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 9 \nResults \nDifferential gaze pattern to preferred and non-preferred images \nWe first examined whether figures of different gender and age group presented in \nthe free-viewing task attracted a similar amount of fixations from men and women. As \nshown in Table 1, on average our viewers allocated 8.7 \u2013 10.6 fixations to explore \ndifferent images, of which at least 97% of fixations were located on the figures. A 2 \n(participant gender) \u00d7 2 (gender preference) \u00d7 5 (age group of figure)  ANOVA with \naveraged number of fixations attracted by each type of figure as  the dependent variable \nrevealed a significant  effect of  age group (F(4, 112) = 10.44, p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .27) and \npreference (F(1, 28) = 5.05, p < .05, \u03b7p\u00b2  = .15). Specifically, regardless of participants\u2019 \ngender, the viewers tended to make more fixations while viewing figures of their \npreferred gender and preferred age (20-year-old). The least number of fixations were \nshown when participants explored the youngest and oldest aged bodies (babies and 60-\nyear-olds).  \n[TABLE 1 HERE] \nWe then examined whether men and women demonstrated the same gaze pattern \nin viewing figures of their preferred age (20-years-old) and gender in comparison with \nthose of their preferred age but non-preferred gender.

The clear interaction between participants\u2019 gender, their preferences and figure \nregions (fixation F(3, 78) = 24.25, p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .46; viewing time F(2, 54) = 24.66, p < \n.001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .47) further indicated that such differential gaze pattern could be reflected by \ndifferent fixation and viewing time allocation to different figure regions.  \nPlanned comparisons were used to compare men and women viewing the same \nfigure region of their preferred gender figure (e.g., men viewing the upper-body of female \nfigures and women viewing the upper-body of male figures). It was evident that in \nrelation to participant gender, when exploring images of their preferred gender, women \ndedicated more fixations and longer viewing time to the face region than men (p < .04), \nwhereas men directed more attention to the upper-body (p < .001) and waist-hip of their \npreferred image (p < .008) than women. In contrast, while viewing their non-preferred \nfigures, women allocated more gaze to the upper-body and waist-hip regions than men (p \n< .02), whereas men looked more often at the limbs than women (p < .05). \nIn relation to gender preference, compared with non-preferred images, men \ndirected significantly less attention to the face (p < .02) and limbs area (p < .04), but \nPage 10 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 11 \nsignificantly more fixations and longer viewing time to the upper body (p < .002) and \nwaist-hip region (p < .01) of preferred figures. For women, the trend was reversed. They \ndedicated more attention to the face (p < .01) and limbs region (p < .002), but less \nattention to the upper body (p < .001) and waist-hip region (p < .006) of preferred \nimages. It seems that men and women tend to adopt distinctly different and almost \nopposite gaze strategies in viewing figures of preferred and non-preferred gender, \npossibly to facilitate the process of sampling visual information related to sexual \npreference. \n \nRelationship of gender- and preference-related gaze strategy to the age of viewed \nfigures  \nThe above analysis revealed that exploring figures of preferred age could induce a \ngaze pattern which is sensitive to viewers\u2019 gender and their preference of image gender. \nTo assess whether this participant gender- and preference-sensitive gaze pattern reflects a \ngeneric oculomotor strategy in viewing the opposite sex or a more specific oculomotor \nstrategy in viewing sexually preferred figures, we examined participants\u2019 gaze patterns in \nviewing figures of different age groups (baby, 10-year-old, 20-year-old, 40-year-old and \n60-year-old). \nTwo 2 (participant gender) \u00d7 2 (gender preference) \u00d7 5 (age group) \u00d7 4 (figure \nregions) ANOVAS with proportion of fixations and viewing time allocated at each figure \nregion as dependent variables revealed significant main effects of participant gender, age \ngroup, and figure regions (all ps < .05), suggesting that gaze allocation in figure viewing \nwas influenced by participant gender and age of viewed figures (i.e. the face area in 20- \nPage 11 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 12 \nyear-old tends to attract a lower proportion of fixations and viewing time in comparison \nwith the face area in babies and 60-year-old). Furthermore, irrespective of viewed figure, \nin comparison with other figure regions, a disproportionate amount of fixation\/viewing \ntime was always directed at the face area (Figure 1). \nWe then focused our analysis on the comparison of gaze patterns induced by the \nmale and female figures within the same age group. There was a clear interaction \nbetween participant gender, gender preference, figure age group, and figure regions on \nfixation distribution (F(7, 188) = 10.44, p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .19) and viewing time distribution \n(F(7, 187) = 6.68, p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .27), suggesting that differential gaze patterns towards \n20-year-old preferred and non-preferred figures were not consistent across all age groups \n(Figure 1). Further planned comparisons demonstrated that except for 20-year-old \nfigures, men directed indistinguishable amount of fixations and viewing time towards the \nfemale and male upper-body or waist-hip regions of other aged images (p > .05), and \ndedicated more viewing to the 20-year-old female upper-body and waist-hip regions than \nany other female images (p < .001). It seems that compared with non-preferred figures, \nthe increased gaze allocation towards the upper-body and waist-hip of preferred figures is \nunique to 20-year-old images for men, further indicating that men\u2019s gaze behavior to \nfigures may reflect their sexual preference. \nIn contrast to men, the gaze allocation to preferred and non-preferred figures from \nwomen viewers was less specific and less age-sensitive. They demonstrated different \ngaze distribution at the upper-body area of preferred and non-preferred figures for all \nadult (20, 40 and 60-year-old) image categories; in all cases more fixations and longer \nviewing time were directed towards the non-preferred female upper body (p < .005).

Specifically, men showed an increased \nproportion of fixations and viewing time towards the upper-body and waist-hip regions \nonly when they viewed female figures of their preferred age. It could be argued that the \ndifferences in gaze allocation to relevant figure region across image categories were \ndriven by low-level image salience (i.e. local image contrast, intensity and structure) \nrather than top-down processes, such as sexual interest. To examine this possibility, we \ncalculated the top ten salient regions within each image using the most widely used \nsaliency model of Itti and Koch (2000), with the authors\u2019 original parameters and \nimplementation (obtained from http:\/\/ilab.usc.edu). This procedure was conducted for \neach of the fifty images. The model compares local image intensity, colour and \norientation, combines them into a single saliency map, and then produces a sequence of \npredicted fixations that scan the scene in order of decreasing saliency. We chose to \ncalculate the first ten salient regions within the image because our participants on average \nmade 10 fixations per image in figure viewing. The salient regions were defined as all \npoints within 2\u00b0 of the salient midpoint indicated by the model (2\u00ba is considered an \naverage estimate of foveal size) (Foulsham & Underwood, 2008; Tatler & Vincent, \n2009).  \nPage 13 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 14 \nThe procedure for analysing real fixation distributions was then employed to \nanalyse the distribution of salient regions (predicted fixations) within the figure. Briefly, \nfor each image, the predicted fixations were grouped together according to their locations \nwithin defined figure features (face, upper-body, waist-hip and limbs). The number of \npredicted fixations within each figure feature was normalised to the total number of \npredicted fixations. Finally, the proportion of the area of a particular figure feature \nrelative to the whole image was subtracted from the proportion of predicted fixations \nallocated at that figure feature. \n A 2 (figure gender) \u00d7 4 (figure regions) \u00d7 5 (age group) ANOVA with proportion \nof predicted fixations within each figure region as dependent variables revealed no \nsignificant main effect of figure gender and age, and no significant interaction of Figure \nGender \u00d7 Age, Figure Gender \u00d7 Figure Region \u00d7 Age (all ps > .13). Clearly, for each \nindividual figure feature, its saliency was consistent across all image categories. \nTo further determine to what extent local image saliency could account for real \nfixations, we directly compared the proportion of predicted and real fixations allocated to \neach figure feature for all the images. A 2 (predicted vs real fixations) \u00d7 4 (figure regions) \nANOVA demonstrated a significant interaction effect (F(2, 240) = 50.9, p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = \n.34; Figure 2), suggesting the amount of fixations directed at individual figure region by \nthe viewers was different to those predicted by local image saliency. Planned \ncomparisons further revealed that participants allocated more fixations to the face (p < \n.001), upper-body (p < .004) and waist-hip (p < .001) than predicted, but less to the limbs \n(p < .001). \n[FIGURE 2 HERE] \nPage 14 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 15 \n Considering the differences in exact location between predicted and real fixations, \nour saliency analysis overestimated the predictive power of local image saliency. For \ninstance, up to 90% of the predicted fixations were located on or close to the edge of a \nfigure feature, whereas real fixations tended to lie on the central part of the figure region. \nThus, although the predicted and real fixation may be in the same figure region, they are \nlikely to be located at different parts of this region. Consistent with previous studies that \nlocal image saliency cannot account for fixations to people in real world scenes \n(Birmingham, Bischof & Kingstone, 2009), our analysis indicated that differential gaze \npatterns towards preferred and non-preferred figure images could not accounted for by \nlow-level image salience. \n \nContribution of image attractiveness \nTo examine whether image attractiveness could be associated with distinct gaze \npattern towards preferred and non-preferred figures, we recruited another 30 \nundergraduate participants (15 men and 15 women, white, heterosexual and of British \norigin aged between 19-23 years (M = 19.78 years, SD = 1.02)). These 30 participants \nand the participants reported in the above studies were from the same academic \ndepartment. Participants were asked to rate how attractive they found each figure on a 7-\npoint Likert scale, with 7 representing \u2018very attractive\u2019 and 1 representing \u2018very \nunattractive\u2019. Given the ethical issues involved in rating \u2018sexual\u2019 attractiveness of baby \nand child figures, participants were simply asked to rate how generally attractive they \nfound each image. Scores for each image are listed in Table 3.

Planned comparisons revealed that \nwhen judging 20-year-old figures, both men and women rated figures of their preferred \ngender as more attractive than those of their non-preferred gender (p < .04, Figure 3); \nmen also judged 40-year-old female figures more attractive than 40-year-old male figures \n(p < .04) . \n[FIGURE 3 HERE] \n Although different groups of participants were recruited for the eye-tracking and \nattractiveness rating studies, there was a strong correlation between the two \nPage 16 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 17 \nmeasurements. For instance, the figures with age (20-year-old) and gender matching our \nparticipants\u2019 preference were rated as the most attractive, and they attracted the highest \nnumber of fixations and different gaze distributions (more evident for men). The oldest \nand youngest figures, on the other hand, were judged as the least attractive and attracted \nthe least number of fixations irrespective of image gender (see Tables 1 and 3). Taken \ntogether, gaze distribution in figure viewing could reflect the assessment of body \nattractiveness, as least for men. \nPage 17 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 18 \nDiscussion \nMotivated by the suggestion that our gaze behavior in viewing scenes of high \necological validity is guided by interest (Henderson, 2003; Issacowitz, 2006) and \nimplicated in preference formation (Shimojo et al., 2003), here we demonstrated that \nyoung, heterosexual men adopted a distinctive gaze pattern when viewing 20-year-old \nfemale figures. Significantly more fixations and longer viewing time were directed at \nfigure regions considered informative for fertility and sexual attraction, such as the upper \nbody and waist-hip region (Singh & Young, 1995). This gaze behavior was not replicated \nwith images of females of other age groups or with images of males, suggesting that the \nmen\u2019s viewing pattern to human figures could be linked with their sexual preference.  \nA few recent studies also observed that heterosexual men directed more visual \nattention to opposite sex figures in both erotic and non erotic stimuli (Lykins et al., 2006, \n2008; Rupp & Wallen, 2007). However, some of these studies used relatively crude \nmeasures to define where the observer was viewing (i.e., face, body, genitals, \nbackground) (Lykins et al., 2006, 2008; Rupp & Wallen, 2007), offering little insight into \nwhich body regions were crucial in this visual assessment. Other researchers did not \ncompare viewing strategies to different aged figure images (Hewig et al., 2008) or gender \n(Cornelissen et al., 2009). This limits their ability to demonstrate whether this viewing \nstrategy reflects a more generic gender-specific strategy or is specific to viewing sexual \ntargets (i.e. age and gender appropriate). Our study is the first to demonstrate that \ndifferentiated gaze pattern in viewing male and female figures was localised in regions \ncrucial for sexual arousal, and was age-specific, which is consistent with the notion that \nage is particularly important for men when choosing a mate (Menken, Trussell, & Larsen, \nPage 18 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 19 \n1986). It is likely, therefore, that our male participants engaged a unique cognitive \nprocess to assess mate value while viewing 20-year-old females. Such a process, even \nwith a free viewing task, could be manifested in their distinctive gaze patterns with \nincreased attention to the upper body and waist-hip regions. Given that observers directed \nmore fixations to these two regions than predicted by a saliency-map technique (see \nFigure 2), clearly low-level image properties could not account for this observation, \nsuggesting that bottom-up processes have limited impact when assessing figures.  \nWomen did not show a unique gaze pattern towards 20-year-old male images. On \nthe contrary, they tended to direct more fixation and longer viewing time to the upper \nbody and\/or waist-hip region of sexually developed females, especially for those of 20-\nyear-old, which may serve frequently-engaged processes of body comparison (Lykins et \nal., 2008) and emphasis on other women\u2019s physical appearance (Fisher, 2004).  \n Our findings are consistent with previous research showing heterosexual women \ndo not demonstrate as strong a visual preference to opposite sex figures as do \nheterosexual men, with past findings demonstrating women show more viewing to the \nsame-sex figure than men (Israel & Strassberg, 2009; Lykins et al., 2008) and indeed \nlook as much at the female figure as men (Rupp & Wallen, 2007). Building on this, our \nfindings illustrate that when viewing same-sex figures, women are attending to the same \nfigure regions as men; however, unlike men, women employ this gaze strategy regardless \nof the age of the viewed figure, supporting a lack of specificity in women\u2019s gaze pattern \nwhile exploring sexually preferred and non-preferred figures.  \nIn general, our findings are in agreement with previously observed gender \ndifferences in arousal. Heterosexual men have consistently been found to report more \nPage 19 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 20 \ngenital and subjective arousal to their preferred gender (Chivers & Bailey, 2005; Chivers, \nReiger, Latty, & Bailey, 2004) and age (Blanchard, Klassen, Dickey, Kubam, & Blak, \n2001; Seto, Lalumiere, & Blanchard, 2000). Heterosexual women, on the other hand, \nreported genital and subjective arousal to same-sex stimuli (Chivers & Bailey, 2005; \nChivers et al., 2004; Chivers, Seto, & Blanchard, 2007). Thus, our observed gender \ndifferences in gaze strategy techniques may reflect organisational differences in sexual \narousal, with men\u2019s arousal dependent upon stimulus-specific features, and women\u2019s  \ngenital arousal a more automatic response to stimuli categorised as \u2018sexual,\u2019 although not \nnecessarily consistent with their subjective arousal (Chivers & Bailey, 2005). Our results \nmay also be taken to support previous findings that demonstrate heterosexual women are \nmore likely to engage in same-sex activity than heterosexual men (Baumeister, 2000). \nAdditionally, our results may reflect differences in men and women\u2019s pre-\noccupation with sex. It is often reported that men experience more sexual desire (Regan \n& Atkins, 2006), engage in more sexual practices (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, & \nMichaels, 1994) and report more interest in sexual stimuli than women (Janssen, \nCarpenter, & Graham, 2003). As such, whereas our male participants may have been \nviewing the figures for sexual interest, our women may have been using another strategy \nunrelated to sexual interest (for example, body comparison). \nIt could be argued that the increased proportion of fixations directed to the waist-\nhip region of 20-year-old females is due to this region being more distinct at this age than \nany other. Although it is difficult to control for this variable in realistic figure images, \nour analysis of local image saliency (including local image curvature) indicated that the \nnumber of predicted fixations directed at the female waist-hip region was \nPage 20 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 21 \nindistinguishable across the five age categories. Therefore, it is unlikely that visual \ndistinctiveness of the waist-hip region in young female figures could solely account for \nthis increase in gaze distribution. Recent gaze pattern studies in face or body perception \nalso suggest that local image regions with high image salience (based on the calculation \nof local image physical properties) are not correlated with the gaze distribution \nin viewing images with high biological relevance (Birmingham et al., 2009; Dahl et al., \n2009; Guo et al., 2010) (also see our analysis in Figure 2).  Hence the gaze distribution \nwithin a human figure is more likely to be dependent upon the amount of available task-\nrelevant information contained within each figure region, rather than constrained by their \nsimple physical properties. \nAlthough due to our relatively small sample size we cannot generalise these \nfindings to a broader population, the results show supportive evidence for eye-tracking as \na measure of sexual interest. As this was an initial, exploratory study we controlled for \npotential confounds such as age, race, and culture. For women we also controlled for \npotential influence of menstrual cycle on gaze behavior in viewing images of sexual \ninterest, thus we cannot generalise our results to normally ovulating women. Future \nstudies may wish to build upon our findings by investigating for differences in a more \nvaried population.  \nMen showed a distinct and sexual attraction assessment-related gaze pattern while \nviewing figures of their reported sexual interest (women) in their age range (20-year-old), \nsuggesting gaze pattern in men could reflect their sexual preference explicitly. Our \ncurrent findings indicate that gaze behaviour to clothed figures is a promising \nmethodology for the assessment of male sexual interest; it will be intriguing to extend \nPage 21 of 33 PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 22 \nthis study to other men with different sexual orientation, and correlate their gaze behavior \nwith other measurements of sexual preference (e.g. phallometric assessment, self report).  \n \n \nPage 22 of 33PDF proof only--The Journal of Sex Research\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n 23 \nReferences \nBaumeister, R.
