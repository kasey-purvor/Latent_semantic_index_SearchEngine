The Letter [1] therefore aims to\ncalculate the temporal growth rate s\u00f0k\u00de of modes with wave\nnumber k, when the electric field far ahead of the ionization\nfront is E1. In earlier work [2\u20134], s\u00f0k\u00de was determined in a\npure reaction-drift model for the free electrons, i.e., in the\nlimit of vanishing electron diffusion De \u00bc 0. For negative\nstreamers in pure gases like nitrogen or argon, electron\ndiffusion De > 0 should be included into the discharge\nmodel. This is attempted in [1] in the limit of large field\njE1j ahead of the front. A different, extensive analysis with\ndifferent results can be found in [5]. Below we show that\nthe expansion and calculation in [1] are inconsistent, that\nthe result contradicts a known analytical asymptote, and\nthat it does not fit the cross-checked numerical results\npresented in [5]. Furthermore, we find in [5] that the\nmost unstable wavelength does not scale as D1=3e as\nclaimed in [1], but as D1=4e .\nIn [1], ionization fronts are only considered in the limit\njE1j \u0001 1 ahead of the front which amounts to a saturating\nimpact ionization cross section \u0001\u00f0E\u00de ! 1. For jE1j \u0001 1,\nplanar fronts obey [[1], Eq. (7)] after all fields are rescaled\nwith E1. For any finite E1, a diffusive layer of width\n1=\u0001\u0002 \u00bc \ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03De=\u00bdjE1j\u0001\u00f0E1\u00de\u0003\np\nforms in the leading edge of\nthe front [6]. (We denote the diffusion constantD from [2\u2013\n6] by De to distinguish it from the D \u00bc De=jE1j in [1].)\nFollowing the calculation in [1], Eq. (8) reproduces the\ndiffusive layer for large jE1j, but the nonlinear term is\nincomplete. Then the dispersion relation is calculated by\nthe expansion (11)\u2013(13) about the planar ionization front.\nHere the expansion of the electron density ne starts in or-\nder \u00022 (where \u0002 is the small expansion parameter), while\nthe expansions of ion density np and field E start in order \u0002.\nThe absence of order \u0002 in the expansion of ne is un-\nexpected, not explained, and in contradiction with the\ncalculation for De \u00bc 0 in [4].\nJumping to the result of [1], the dispersion relation in\nEq. (21) is given as s \u00bc jE1kj=\u00bd2\u00f01\u00fe jkj\u00de\u0003 \u0004Dek2 in the\npresent notation. The small k limit s \u00bc jE1kj=2\u00feO\u00f0k2\u00de\nof [[1], Eq. (21)] is consistent neither with the limit De \u00bc\n0, where the asymptote s\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc jE1kj for jkj \u0005 \u0001\u00f0E1\u00de=2\nwas derived in [4], nor with the case De > 0 where\nthe asymptote s \u00bc c\u0002jkj, c\u0002 \u00bc EdEv\u0002jE1 , v\u0002\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc jEj \u00fe\n2\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\nDejEj\u0001\u00f0E\u00de\np\nwas proposed in [2] and analytically con-\nfirmed in [5].\nFurthermore, in [5], dispersion curves s\u00f0k\u00de for a range of\nfields E1 and diffusion constants De are derived as an\neigenvalue problem for s; they are plotted in Fig. 1. In\none case, the curve is confirmed by numerical solutions of\nan initial value problem; the curves are also consistent with\nthe analytical small k asymptote. The results for positive s\nare conveniently fitted as s\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc c\u0002jkj\u00f01\u0004 4jkj=\u0001\u0002\u00de=\u00f01\u00fe\najkj\u00de with a \u0006 3=\u0001\u00f0E1\u00de [5]. Figure 1 also shows the\nprediction from [1] for E1 \u00bc \u000410 and De \u00bc 0:1; here\nthe reduced diffusion constant De=jE1j is as small as\n0.01, and the assumptions jE1j \u0001 1 and De=jE1j \u0005 1\nfrom [1] hold. However, Fig. 1 shows that the data of [5]\nand the prediction of [1] clearly differ. Therefore also the\nscaling prediction [[1], Eq. (23)] for the spacing of emer-\ngent streamers does not hold; rather our physical argu-\nments and the numerical data in [5] suggest that the\nfastest growing mode is kmax \u00bc \u00f0\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n1\u00fe a\u0001\u0002=4p \u0004 1\u00de=a \/\nD\u00041=4e for \u0001\u0002 \u0001 1.\nUte Ebert1 and Gianne Derks2\n1CWI\nP.O.Box 94079, 1090 GB Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n2Department of Mathematics\nUniversity of Surrey\nGuildford, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\nReceived 15 June 2007; published 23 September 2008\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.101.139501\nPACS numbers: 52.80.Hc, 05.45.\u0004a, 47.54.\u0004r\n[1] M.
