Previous studies of escape in chaotic systems have rather focused on the case of unbounded\nnoise, usually assumed to have Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we address the problem of escape induced\nby bounded noise. We show that the dynamics of escape from an attractor\u2019s basin is equivalent to that of a\nclosed system with an appropriately chosen \u201chole.\u201d Using this equivalence, we show that there is a minimum\nnoise amplitude above which escape takes place, and we derive analytical expressions for the scaling of the\nescape rate with noise amplitude near the escape transition. We verify our analytical predictions through\nnumerical simulations of two well-known two-dimensional maps with noise.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevE.82.046217 PACS number\u0001s\u0002: 05.45.Ac, 61.43.Hv, 02.50.Ey\nThe escape of trajectories from attracting sets due to the\neffect of noise has been a central issue in various branches of\nscience for a long time. From a fundamental perspective, the\nstudy of the dynamics of escape includes the fundamental\nwork by Arrhenius on chemical reactions \u00031\u0004, passing\nthrough ideas of Kramers from the 1940s \u00032\u0004, the escaping\non chaotic dynamics \u00033\u20136\u0004 to very recent work on statistical\nmechanics \u00037\u0004. Notwithstanding this long history, an impor-\ntant case has mostly been neglected, namely, the dynamics\nunder bounded noise. In fact, the vast majority of theoretical\nworks in this area is heavily dependent on the assumptions of\nunbounded noise, almost always assumed to have a Gaussian\ndistribution \u00033,7,8\u0004. Thus, they are not applicable to other\ncases. In particular, very little is known about the dynamics\nof systems with escape in the presence of bounded noise. As\nfor many applications a bounded perturbation is arguably\nmore realistic than unbounded ones, this is an important gap\nin our understanding. For example, in neuroscience one may\nbe interested in the minimum energy for bursting to take\nplace \u00039\u0004, in geophysics one may consider the overcoming of\nsome potential barrier just before an earthquake \u000310\u0004, or the\ncritical outbreak magnitude for the spread of epidemics \u000311\u0004,\namong others.\nIn this paper, we investigate escape in dynamics perturbed\nby bounded noise using a different approach. We describe the\nnoisy dynamics in terms of a family of random maps, whose\niteration gives rise to a discrete Markovian process with tran-\nsition probability supported in the neighborhood of the\npoints generated by the iteration of the deterministic dynam-\nics. The dynamics near an attractor is then described using\nthe formalism of conditionally invariant measures. We show\nthat the dynamics of the escape is determined by the measure\nof a subset I\u0001 of the phase space, which we call conditional\nboundary. It consists of those points lying close enough to\nthe basin boundary such that they are subject to escape under\nthe effect of random perturbation in one iteration of the map,\nand intersecting the support of the conditionally invariant\nmeasure of the system. Therefore, the dynamics is mapped\nonto the dynamics of a closed system with a hole\u2014I\u0001 being\nthe hole. We show that there is a minimum noise amplitude\nfor the escape to take place, which is the critical noise am-\nplitude \u0001c that makes I\u0001 nonempty. We show that the mean\nescape time is determined by the measure of the conditional\nboundary and use this to derive a power-law relation be-\ntween the average escape time \u0005T\u0006 and the noise amplitude \u0001,\nfor \u0001 close to \u0001and higher than\u0002 \u0001c:\n\u0005T\u0006 \u0007 \u0001\u0001 \u2212 \u0001c\u0002\u2212\u0002, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0002 depends on the dimension of the system. We show\nthat for dimension 2, \u0002=3 \/2, and we verify that this predic-\ntion is correct by comparing with the results of numerical\nsimulations for two maps from different families. This result\nis independent of any particular system and holds universally\nfor bounded noise. Equation \u00011\u0002 is in contrast with the case\nof Gaussian noise, where an exponential scaling is observed\n\u00031\u20138\u0004. Furthermore, although the noise-induced escape from\nattractors may seem to be very different from that of systems\nundergoing a boundary bifurcation, we show that our ap-\nproach allows us to establish a connection between these two\nprocesses and to explain why we find the same time scaling\nin both cases.\nTo get started, first consider a deterministic dynamics\nxn+1= f\u0001xn\u0002 given by the iteration of the map f , a smooth\nfunction whose inverse is differentiable, in the phase space\nof the system M \u0001i.e., the iteration of a diffeomorphism\nf :M\u2192M\u0002. Our main focus will be on invariant subsets \u0003 of\nM which attract their neighboring points, that is, fn\u0001x\u0002 tends\nto \u0003 as n\u2192\u0004; these are the attractors of the system. The\nbasin of attraction of \u0003 is the open set Ws\u0001\u0003\u0002, the set of\npoints eventually coming close and converging to \u0003. The\nnext ingredient is the boundary of the basin of attraction, a\nzero Lebesgue measure ergodic component of the phase\nspace which we denote by \u0001.\nWe shall consider a random perturbation of the determin-\nistic system introduced above \u000312,13\u0004, so that our perturbed\nsystem is described by a family of random maps, which in\nour context can be written as*christian.rodrigues@mis.mpg.de\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 82, 046217 \u00012010\u0002\n1539-3755\/2010\/82\u00014\u0002\/046217\u00015\u0002 \u00a92010 The American Physical Society046217-1\nF\u0001xj\u0002 = f\u0001xj\u0002 + \u0005 j , \u00012\u0002\nwith \b\u0005 j\b\u0006\u0001, where \u0005 j is the vector of random noise added to\nthe deterministic dynamics at the iteration j, and \u0001 is its\nmaximum amplitude. In this way, F is a continuous applica-\ntion \u000314\u0004. We illustrate this in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. As it is shown in the\npicture, the perturbed dynamics can be thought as follows.\nImagine that we iterate the point xj by the deterministic sys-\ntem f . Then, let say that at the moment that we take f\u0001xj\u0002 to\nevolve our dynamics again, we make a small error given to\nour limited precision. Nevertheless, we can assure that the\nerror is always less than \u0001. Then we ask whether the attrac-\ntors for the system with no error are still attractors when a\nsmall error is considered. If so, how large can our error be\nsuch that the attractors will still be preserved? Above this\nthreshold, how does the escape of orbits scale? These natural\nextensions of deterministic processes are exactly the sort of\nproblems we shall be interested in.\nFrom the probabilistic perspective, the idea of orbits con-\nverging to some attractor is represented by the concept of\nphysical \u0003or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen \u0001SRB\u0002\u0004 measures \u000313,15\u0004.\nSuppose initially that we compute the time average,\n1\nn\n\t j=0\nn\u22121f j\u0001x\u0002, along the orbit for a given initial condition as n\nevolves. This quantity, the time average, is expected to con-\nverge to some invariant value as the orbit approaches the\nattractor. If we extend it for a large number of initial condi-\ntions, then the time averages that we compute along different\norbits are also expected to converge to an invariant value as\nthese orbits approach the attractor. It turns out that such\nvalue defines the so-called SRB measure, which character-\nizes the attractor. The set of initial conditions that we chose\nfor computing such time averages along the orbits is exactly\nwhat we call the basin of the measure, which we represent by\nB\u0001\u0007\u0002. Since we want to statistically characterize the behavior\nof the attractor, it is desirable for the set of initial conditions\nfor which we compute such time averages to have positive\nLebesgue measure. That is, there is a non-negligible number\nof initial conditions whose time averages along the orbits\nconverge to such invariant quantity and thus characterize the\nattractor. Therefore, we say that a measure is physical if its\nbasin has positive Lebesgue measure. More precisely, the\nbasin B\u0001\u0007\u0002 of such measure is the set of points whose time\naverages along the orbits weakly converge to the space av-\nerage, limn\u2192\u0004\n1\nn\n\t j=0\nn\u22121\b(f j\u0001x\u0002)=\n\bd\u0007, where \b represents our\nmeasurements of an observable \u000316\u0004. Here, a physical mea-\nsure of a set A\u0001M is an invariant ergodic probability mea-\nsure \u0007 supported on A. Therefore, such measures are closely\nrelated to the so-called natural measures. Note that as a con-\nsequence of the Birkhoff\u2019s ergodic theorem,\n\u0007\u201eB\u0001\u0007\u0002\u2026 = 1. \u00013\u0002\nIn other words, Eq. \u00013\u0002 just says that we are normalizing such\nmeasure on the total set of initial conditions whose time\naverages converge to the invariant one. For most known\ncases the basin of the physical measures supported on the\nattractors coincides with the basins of the attractors \u000313\u0004, so\nwe assume here that Ws\u0001\u0003\u0002=B\u0001\u0007\u0002. This is known as the\nbasin property.\nDespite the complications introduced by the presence of\nnoise in the dynamics, for continuous random maps with\nsmall amplitude of perturbation an invariant probability mea-\nsure is guaranteed to exist. This is due to the Krylov-\nBogolubov theorem \u000317\u0004, which ensures that every continu-\nous application in a compact measurable space has an\ninvariant probability measure. For randomly perturbed sys-\ntems, we expect that the perturbed orbit will densely fill up\nthe neighborhood of the attractor. This property is called ran-\ndom transitivity \u000312\u0004, and under general conditions it can be\nshown that these measures are ergodic \u000312\u0004. As an example,\nwe can think of an attractive fixed point for a deterministic\nsystem and the perturbed version of that system. In the per-\nturbed dynamics, there is a density of probability around the\nfixed point. When we increase the amplitude of the noise, the\ndensity of probability becomes more spread around the origi-\nnal fixed point. Conversely, decreasing the amplitude of\nnoise, the support of the invariant measure tends to the point\nattractor.\nNow consider a subset I\u02dc\u0001 of the phase space neighboring\nthe basin boundary, defined by the set of points x whose f\u0001x\u0002\nis within a distance \u0001 from some point in the boundary \u0001,\nI\u02dc\u0001 = \u000bx\u0001M ;B\u201ef\u0001x\u0002,\u0001\u2026\u0002 \u0001 \u0002 0\u201d\f , \u00014\u0002\nwhere B(f\u0001x\u0002 ,\u0001) is the ball of radio \u0001 around f\u0001x\u0002. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. In addition to being close enough to\nthe boundary, another important condition for the escaping\nprocess to take place is that the intersection of the support of\nthe invariant physical measure of the system under stochastic\nperturbation, supp \u0007\u0001, overlaps the set I\u02dc\u0001. That is, the density\nof probability around the attractor needs to be spread over a\nregion close enough to the boundary. We thus define the set\nI\u0001 by\n\u2202\nW (\u039b)s\nx\nf(x)\n\u03be\nf(z)\n\u03be\nz\nM\\W (\u039b)s(b)\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Illustrative picture of the perturbed dynamics with\namplitude of noise \b\u0005 j\b\u0006\u0001. \u0001b\u0002 A basin of attraction Ws\u0001\u0003\u0002 and its\nbasin boundary \u0001 \u0001dashed line\u0002.

Therefore, the random perturbation\napplied to f\u0001z\u0002 with some \b\u0005\b\u0006\u0001 could push the random orbit out-\nside the basin.

But as the amplitude of the noise is increased, we\nexpect that for a certain critical amplitude \u0001=\u0001c, we have\nI\u0001\u00020\u201d , and escape takes place for any \u0001\t\u0001c. We call I\u0001 the\nconditional boundary. The importance of I\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002 stems from\nthe fact that it represents the set of points in which one it-\neration of the map f can potentially send close enough to the\nboundary \u0001, such that a random perturbation with amplitude\n\u0001 may send them out of the basin of attraction. The dynamics\nof escape is thus governed by this set, and it can be under-\nstood as a hole which sucks orbits from the basin if they land\non it.\nDue to property \u00013\u0002, we have that I\u0001\u00020\u201d for \u0001\t\u0001c, and\nthus \u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002\t0. We can therefore think of the system with\n\u0001\t\u0001c as a closed system with a hole \u0001or leak\u0002 \u000318\u0004, where I\u0001\nplays the role of the hole. The idea of a system with a hole\nhave been used in different context before, for example \u000318\u0004.\nFurthermore, note that the measure \u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002 is not in fact invari-\nant because of the loss caused by escape. However, it is\npossible to describe such escape problem in terms of condi-\ntionally invariant measure \u000318,19\u0004. We say that a probability\nmeasure \u0007c is conditionally invariant with respect to F if\n\u0007c\u201eF\u22121\u0001X\u0002\u2026\n\u0007c\u201eF\u22121\u0001A\u0002\u2026 = \u0007c\u0001X\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nfor every measurable subset X\u0001A, where A\u0001M is a nonin-\nvariant region of the phase space M. The conditional mea-\nsure is defined in a way that, for each iteration, when the set\nA loses a fraction of its orbits to the hole, we renormalize its\nmeasure by what remains in A. It is defined in terms of\npreimages \u0001or more generally using push forward measures\n\u000318\u0004\u0002. In our context, the hole is the set I\u0001, and therefore\n\u0007c\u0001I\u0001\u0002\t0 is preserved by the dynamics because of the com-\npensation factor \u0007c(F\u22121\u0001A\u0002) \u000318,20\u0004. Due to the random tran-\nsitivity of the conditionally invariant domain, we expect no\nparticular dependence on the density of points in A. In this\ncase, a random trajectory diffuses through the support of \u0007c,\nuntil it eventually comes inside I\u0001. Once in this set, there is a\nprobability that it will permanently escape. Indeed it is the\nmeasure of I\u0001 which controls the escape rate. Because we are\ninterested in the regime of \u0001\u0001\u0001c, hence small leaks, we can\nassume \u000320\u0004\n\u0007c\u0001I\u0001\u0002 = \u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002\t 0. \u00017\u0002\nSince there is a certain probability that a particle escapes if it\nfalls into I\u0001, we expect from Kac\u2019s lemma \u000321\u0004 that the av-\nerage escape time satisfies\n\u0005T\u0006 \n\n1\n\u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002\n. \u00018\u0002\nRigorously proving the existence of and calculating \u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002\nis not an easy task. We use here a heuristic approach to\nobtain the scaling of \u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002 for \u0001 close to \u0001c \u000322\u0004. For simplic-\nity we focus on the two-dimensional case. For \u0001\u0006\u0001c, we\nexpect the probability distribution to be relatively concen-\ntrated on the attractor, thus having support with Lebesgue\nmeasure \u0001area\u0002 smaller than that of the basin of attraction. As\na first approximation, we image the edge of the support as\nbeing a smooth closed curve. As \u0001 is increased, the mean\nradio of the distribution grows, but it needs to be less than\nthat of the basin of attraction; otherwise, we would have the\ninvariant measure supported outside the basin of attraction.\nWhen \u0001\u0001\u0001c, we picture it as a generic intersection of two\ncurves of different radios.

Note\nthat although we use the approximation to describe the\nboundary \u0001 locally as a smooth curve, it might actually be\nfractal. Therefore, if the random orbit falls into I\u0001, there is\nonly a probability that it will escape due to the fractal prop-\nerty of \u0001. This fact is subtly incorporated by Eq. \u00018\u0002 in the\nproportionality rather than the equality to the inverse of the\nmean escape time.\nIn order to check this prediction we numerically obtained\nthe scaling of the distribution of escaping times with ampli-\ntude of noise for two distinct two-dimensional systems. The\nfirst perturbed systems we have chosen was the randomly\nperturbed single rotor map \u000323\u0004, defined by\nF\u000fxjyj\u0010 = \u000f xj + yj\u0001mod 2\r\u0002\u00011 \u2212 \u000e\u0002yj + 4 sin\u0001xj + yj\u0002 \u0010 + \u000f\u0005xj\u0005yj\u0010 , \u000112\u0002\nwhere x\u0001 \u00030,2\r\u0004 and y\u0001R, and \u000e represents the dissipation\nparameter. As a second testing system, we have chosen the\nperturbed dissipative H\u00e9non map, in the form\nG\u000fxjyj\u0010 = \u000f1.06xj2 \u2212 \u00011 \u2212 \u000e\u0002yjxj \u0010 + \u000f\u0005xj\u0005yj\u0010 , \u000113\u0002\nwhere x and y are real numbers and, again, \u000e represents the\ndissipation parameter. We used \u000e=0.02 for both maps, as for\nsuch value they present very rich dynamics \u000324\u0004. We also\nassumed, for the purposes of this numerical experiment, the\nnoise to be uniformly distributed in each variable; but we\nstress that this is just a numerical convenience. For each\nmap, we computed the time that random orbits took to es-\ncape from their respective main attractors for a range of\nnoise amplitudes. In each case, the mean escape time was\nobtained for 103 random orbits for each value of \u0001. The re-\nsults are shown in Fig. 3. For the parameter used here, we\nobtained \u0001c=0.086\u000f0.006 for the perturbed rotor map and\n\u0001c=0.021\u000f0.002 for the perturbed H\u00e9non map, which is\nshown in the insets. In both cases, we obtained a good agree-\nment between our simulations and the predictions of our\ntheory for a range of decades. An important remark is regard-\ning the precision of \u0001c. For the one-dimensional case, for\nexample, it has been proved that similar power laws in the\nunfolding parameters are in fact lower bounds for the aver-\nage escape time scale \u000319\u0004. Therefore, even from the numeri-\ncal perspective, it is difficult to accurately estimate the value\nof \u0001c. Indeed, in our case we observe when increasing \u0001 near\n\u0001c some transient irregular bursts regime before the escape\nphenomena becomes robust. For a number of initial condi-\ntions, we have thus a distribution of values of critical noise\naround \u0001c that is expected to become sharper as the number\nof initial conditions is increased. As a direct implication, the\nexponent obtained in our numerical simulations also varies\nwithin some range. For example, for the rotor map, if we\nchoose \u0001c=0.086+0.006, we obtain \u0002=1.5, and for \u0001c\n=0.086\u22120.006, we have \u0002=2.0. For the H\u00e9non map, we ob-\ntained \u0002=1.3 for \u0001c=0.023 and \u0002=2.1 for \u0001c=0.019.\nNote also that, in principle, a much larger number of ran-\ndom orbits would be necessary for one to be able to observe\na \u201cperfect\u201d power law. This is because most of the theoretical\narguments used here, such as the convergence of time aver-\nages, are obtained in the asymptotic limit. Furthermore, we\nnotice that for \u201clarge\u201d values of \u0001\u0001\u2212\u0001c\u0002, meaning large holes,\nour simulated results differ appreciably from our theoretical\nprediction. This is due to the fact that \u0007c\u0001I\u0001\u0002=\u0007\u0001I\u0001\u0002 is valid\nonly for small leaks \u000320\u0004. In addition, for large amplitude of\nnoise, the dynamics is totally dominated by the noise and is\nnot well described as a small perturbation around the deter-\nministic motion. We note here that the exponential distribu-\ntion reported in \u00034\u0004 for a particular case of bounded noise\nwas obtained for values of \u0001 much greater than the critical\namplitude \u0001c, which is outside the range of validity of our\ntheory.\nAs the last consideration, we want to call attention to the\ncase where noise is applied on bifurcating systems \u00037,25,26\u0004.\nIn our approach we consider \u000b to be increasing. In Fig. 2,\nthis corresponds to moving the parabola upward until it in-\ntersects the \f curve, when the transition to escape takes\nplace. We can easily see that we should expect an equivalent\ntransition to escape by moving \f instead, as a result of\nchanging a bifurcating parameter while keeping the noise\namplitude constant. Therefore, the exponent obtained for the\ncase of bifurcating systems is expected to be the same as\nours, and this is indeed the case \u00037,25,26\u0004.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the problem of escap-\ning orbits from attractors due to the effect of bounded ran-\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n10\n-7\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n10\n0\n1\/\u2329T\u232a\nRotor-map\nH\u00e9non-map\n(\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n)\n3\/2\n0 0.02 0.04\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n0\n0.001\n0.002\n1\/\u2329T\u232a\n0 0.01 0.02\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n0\n0.001\n0.002\n1\/\u2329T\u232a\n(a)\n(\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n)\n1.6\n(\u03be \u2212 \u03be\nC\n)\n1.7\n(b)\n\u03be\nC\n= 0.086\n\u03be\nC\n= 0.021\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 The inverse of the mean escape time\nscaling with amplitude of noise for map \u000112\u0002 \u0001black circles\u0002 and for\nmap \u000113\u0002 \u0001blue squares\u0002.

We\nidentify the subset of the phase space that is responsible for\nthe escape and acts as a hole, and we show that the measure\nof this set determines the escape rate. We have shown that\nthere is a critical amplitude of noise in order to such escape\nhappens. When the amplitude is just above this critical value,\nwe derived a universal power-law relation of escape time\nwith respect to the amplitude of noise, in contrast with the\ncase of Gaussian noise.\nThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for\nvaluable suggestions to increase the value of this paper.\nA.P.S.d.M. and C.G. have been supported by the BBSRC\nunder Grants No. BB-F00513X and No. BB-G010722.\n\u00031\u0004 P.
