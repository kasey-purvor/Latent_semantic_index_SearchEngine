PULFORD \n \n Psychology Division                  School of Psychology \nUniversity of Wolverhampton   University of Leicester \n \nSummary.- The development of a taxonomy of expressions expressing the degree \nof confidence or certainty felt in the correctness of one\u2018s judgments, knowledge, or \nbeliefs is reported. 30 phrases expressing confidence and doubt were rated by 96 \nBritish participants on a 7-point scale to indicate how much confidence or doubt \nthey felt each phrase expressed. The expressions were rank ordered, based on their \nmean ratings, to produce a continuum of cues expressing confidence, ranging from \nhigh to low. 9 of the 30 expressions were rated as expressing lower confidence \nwhen phrased in the past tense than in the present tense. The expressions reported \nin this study form a useful tool for researchers who are investigating the \ncommunication of confidence and degrees of belief, especially in relation to giving \nadvice, influence, and persuasion.  \n \nThe word confidence is used to describe a person\u2018s strength of belief about \nthe accuracy or quality of a prediction, judgment, or choice (Peterson & Pitz, 1988; \nSniezek, 1992), and confidence can thus be described on a continuum ranging \nfrom total certainty to complete doubt. In recent years researchers have become \ninterested in how the confidence that people generally express in specific pieces of \ninformation influences the recipient of that information (Zarnoth & Sniezek, 1997; \nSniezek & Van Swol, 2001; Pulford, 2002; Pulford & Colman, 2005; Wesson & \nPulford, 2006), especially in judge\u2013advisor systems and group decision making, \nand have found expressed confidence to be an influential factor. Even children as \nyoung as four years old can understand words that express confidence and use \nthem as a basis of their choices (Moore, Harris, & Patriquin, 1993).  \nThe influence of a speaker\u2019s confidence, as a form of social influence in \ncomputer-mediated communication, has recently been investigated by Lee (2005). \nLee found that men were persuaded by an anonymous on-line partner\u2019s high \nconfidence when it was expressed in numbers (but not words), whereas women \nwere more likely to conform to the high-confidence advice that was expressed in \nwords and were less influenced by numbers. Lee used several cues to express the  \n \n1\n Address correspondence to Dr Briony D.

The research \nreported in this article was funded by a research studentship awarded by the University of \nWolverhampton to the first author and research grant RES-000-23-0154 awarded by the \nEconomic and Social Research Council of the UK and University of Leicester study leave to the \nsecond author.  \n \nverbal confidence of the advisor, such as \u2015I am slightly confident\u201d and \u2015I am \nsomewhat confident\u201d to express low confidence and \u2015I am quite confident\u201d and \u2015I \nam very confident\u201d to express high confidence. Lee used verbal cues to indicate \nhow confident a speaker felt, and assessed the effect on the listener. In more true-\nto-life experiments where participants actually interact and discuss problems or \nscenarios with each other (Sniezek & Henry, 1989; Zarnoth & Sniezek, 1997), \npeople are free to switch between numerical and verbal reports of confidence, or to \nlimit themselves to one mode.  \nIn a related field, researchers such as Paese and Kinnaly (1993) and Price and \nStone (2004) have used numbers to represent the speaker\u2018s estimate of the \nprobability of their chosen answer being correct. In the field of probability \ncommunication, which bears strong similarities to the area of confidence \ncommunication, the mapping of quantitative terms to qualitative terms has \nestablished the numerical values placed on different verbal expressions of \nprobability (see Druzdzel, 1989; Clark, 1990, for reviews). Phrases such as \n\u2015absolutely impossible,\u201d \u2015rather likely,\u201d \u2015very probable,\u201d and \u2015almost certain\u201d have \nbeen researched in detail and ratings of the values assigned to each phrase have \nbeen observed (Hamm, 1991). Kahneman and Tversky (1982) pointed out that \nthere are different expressions in natural language reflecting the internal or \nexternal source of the uncertainty. For example, uncertainty can be either internal \n(epistemic) uncertainty, relating to a subjective state of incomplete knowledge, or \nexternal (aleatory) uncertainty, which is due to the chance nature of external \nfactors. Teigen (1988) concludes \u2015the term \u2018uncertainty\u2019 refers primarily to states \nof mind, whereas \u2018probabilities\u2019 have in the course of history increasingly been \nused to describe the occurrences of external events\u201d (p. 33). In previous research, \nthe authors have examined the phrases that people use to communicate an internal \nstate of mind and how uncertain, or certain, they feel in their knowledge or beliefs. \nResearchers often use the terms confidence and subjective probability \ninterchangeably, but here the word confidence is used to refer to the internal \nuncertainty that the person feels. Doubt\u2014the opposite of confidence\u2014fortunately \nis usually more clearly understood to refer to internal feelings of high uncertainty.  \nWhen communicating about probabilities, listeners tend to show a preference \nfor numerical probabilities, but speakers often feel more comfortable \ncommunicating probabilities by using verbal expressions (Brun & Teigen, 1988; \nHamm, 1991). Given this preference for communicating such information \nverbally, it is perhaps surprising that research has focused so heavily on numerical \nexpressions, but understandable since they are clearly ordinal in nature. As \nRenooij and Witteman (1999) point out, \u2015words are, in comparison, vaguer, they \ndo not allow calculations and they are more variably interpretable\u201d (p. 3). Renooij  \n  \nand Witteman developed a probability scale that rank ordered verbal probability \nexpressions such as \u2015certain,\u201d \u2015probable,\u201d \u2015improbable,\u201d and \u2015impossible,\u201d which \nexpress the likelihood of events occurring, and mapped those words to numerical \nvalues.  \nPrevious studies have ranked verbal expressions of probabilities. In this \nstudy, instead, participants ranked examples of verbal expressions of confidence \nand doubt that are commonly used to indicate their strength of feeling or belief in \nthe correctness of the information they are giving. Druzdzel\u2019s (1989) and Clark\u2019s \n(1990) reviews of the literature on expression of verbal uncertainty concluded that \nalthough there is a great deal of between-subject variability in the numerical values \nassigned to expressions of probability, the ordinal relations between these \nexpressions are more or less consistent. It was expected that this would also be the \ncase for verbal expressions of confidence. For example, people might assign \ndifferent numerical values to expressions such as \u2015I am certain\u201d and \u2015I think,\u201d but \nthey should always tend to rank \u2015I am certain\u201d as indicating more confidence than \n\u2015I think.\u201d Feezel (1974) suggests that terms of confidence lie along a continuum, \nand consistent results have been found for the positioning of words along this \ncontinuum, with terms such as suppose, think, sure, certain, and positive indicating \nincreasing certainty (Foley, 1959; Berry, 1960; Fabre, 1991). These early studies, \nhowever, did not examine in depth how people express very low confidence, i.e., \ndoubt. This study is an attempt to fill this gap.  \nWhen expressing uncertainty, people\u2019s speech is characterised by the more \nfrequent use of tag questions and disclaimers (Bradley, 1981). However, Bradley \npoints out that whilst there are many kinds of disclaimer, only two are associated \nwith uncertainty: hedges and cognitive disclaimers. Hedging indicates that a given \nstatement is tentative, and communicates uncertainty about how it will be received, \nwhereas cognitive disclaimers may be used when people expect that their opinions \nmay be questioned, or they have doubts about their understanding of a given issue. \nHence, a lack of confidence may be expressed with the use of tag questions (I think \nit\u2019s\u2026, isn\u2019t it?), hedges (I could be wrong, but\u2026) and cognitive disclaimers (I \ncould be mistaken, but\u2026).  \nMaking comparisons between studies may become problematic owing to the \nwealth of expressions people can, and do, use in everyday conversation to express \ndegrees of belief (Astington & Olson, 1990). Therefore, it may be advantageous \nfor researchers examining the influence of verbal expressions of confidence to \nhave access to a taxonomy of verbal expressions of confidence, to ensure \nconsistent usage of terms and to know in advance how these terms are likely to be \ninterpreted. With this aim in mind, a list of confidence expressions  \n  \n(interchangeable statements that are used either before or in conjunction with \nexpressed judgments) was constructed using qualifiers and phrases identified in \nprevious research as indicating different degrees of confidence, such as I know and \nI think (Foley, 1959; Berry, 1960; Feezel, 1974; Bradley, 1981; Westney, 1986; \nFurrow & Moore, 1990; Fabre, 1991; Pulford, 2002), akin to lists that have been \ncreated for verbal expressions of probabilities. The list incorporates hedges and \ndisclaimers which occur in everyday language, covering the continuum from \nabsolute certainty to complete doubt. The aim was not necessarily to be able to \nassign precise numbers (probabilities or ratings) to these expressions, but to \ndemonstrate where the expressions fall on a confidence\u2013doubt continuum. Of \ncourse, researchers who want to make numerical ratings of people\u2019s speech would \nbe able to use this taxonomy to consistently code phrases expressing confidence, \nand it has already been successfully used this way in a recent study by Pulford and \nEvans (2006). This taxonomy should help researchers create more consistent \nexperimental materials in future research.  \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants  \nBritish undergraduate psychology students (N = 96; 17 men and 79 women), \nranging in age from 18 to 49 years (M = 21.1, SD = 5.9), completed the study as a \ngroup in a lecture theatre, in return for course credit. All were native speakers of \nEnglish. No attrition occurred; the sex imbalance was representative of the \nstudents in the course. Participants were blind to hypotheses.  \n \nMaterials  \nA list of 30 confidence expressions was constructed. In addition to the \nexpressions noted above, further expressions that are commonly used in natural \nlanguage to express confidence and uncertainty were added to the list to create a \nbroader and more naturalistic list (see Table 1). These were taken from various \nsources including conversations, television quiz shows, and court transcripts. Each \nexpression was then modified to change the tense, so that two lists were produced, \none phrased in the past tense (e.g., \u2015I\u2019m confident that it was\u2026\u201d) and the other \nphrased in the present tense (e.g., \u2015I\u2019m confident that it is\u2026\u201d). This check was \nnecessary because in earlier experimental research using confidence expressions \n(e.g., Wesson & Pulford, 2005), some sentences needed to be phrased in the past \ntense and some in the present, for variety and because of the context. Here, the \ntense of the expressions was investigated as an independent variable, to assess \nwhether referring to confidence in the past or present tense influences the \nperceived confidence ratings. This would also allow for greater future flexibility in \nusing the expressions.  \n \n  \nTABLE 1 \nRATINGS OF EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE AND DOUBT, OVERALL AND FOR PAST \nAND PRESENT PHRASINGS \n Past  Present   \nExpression M SD  M SD t d \nI'm not sure, it's kind of\u2026 2.88 1.08  2.91 1.24 -0.104 0.03 \nOh, I don't know, I suppose it's\u2026 2.94 1.07  3.02 1.25 -0.339 0.07 \nI suppose it could be\u2026 3.13 1.12  3.34 0.96 -2.149* 0.44 \nI'm guessing, but I would say it's\u2026 2.92 1.06  3.39 1.04 -0.958 0.20 \nI think it's\u2026. isn't it? 3.08 1.31  3.48 1.41 -1.442 0.29 \nI think, I think it's\u2026. 3.19 1.03  3.61 1.37 -1.719 0.35 \nI could be wrong, but I think it's\u2026 3.67 1.32  3.68 1.38 -1.411 0.29 \nI guess it's\u2026 3.56 1.13  3.75 1.14 -1.602 0.33 \nIt's\u2026.

Forty-four of the participants rated expressions \npresented in the present tense while 52 participants rated expressions presented in \npast tense. The unequal samples were not due to attrition, only an uneven \ndistribution of materials in the large testing session. The expressions were \npresented in a random order, not the order shown in Table 1.  \n \nRESULTS \nThe mean rating of each confidence expression was calculated and cues were \nthen rank ordered from low to high (see Table 1). A mixed-design ANOVA was \ncomputed with the expressions as the repeated measure and tense as the between\u2013\nsubjects variable. A main effect of expression was found, reflecting the fact that \nfor some, confidence was rated significantly higher than for others (F29, 2726 = \n122.46, p < .001; \u03b72 = .57). A main effect of tense showed that when participants \nrated expressions stated in the past tense, they rated them to be expressing \nsignificantly less confidence (M = 4.42, SE = .07) than when they were phrased in \nthe present tense (M = 4.76, SE = .08; F1, 94 = 10.05, p = .002; \u03b72 = .097). The \nratings for the past tense expressions tended to be lower than the ratings for those \nin the present tense. This was the case for 29 of the 30 cues, although only \nsignificant for nine (see Table 1 for between-subjects t test results). There was no \nsignificant interaction between expression and tense.  \nTo assess how well the assumed ordinal relation between verbal expressions \nheld up, four cues were selected from the list, shown in Table 2, to represent \nexpressions at different points along the continuum (with average ratings in Table \n \nTABLE 2 \nPERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS RATING EXAMPLE PHRASES IN PREDICTED DIRECTION \nLower confidence \nphrase \nHigher  \nconfidence  \nphrase \nRated in \npredicted \ndirection \nRated  \nequal \nRated in \nopposite \ndirection \nI suppose it could \nbe\u2026 \nI think it's\u2026 68.75 25.00 6.25 \nI suppose it could \nbe\u2026 \nI'm fairly confident \nit's\u2026 \n90.63 6.25 3.13 \nI suppose it could \nbe\u2026 \nI'm absolutely \ncertain it's\u2026 \n93.75 2.08 4.17 \nI think it's\u2026 \nI'm fairly confident \nit's\u2026 \n61.46 23.96 14.58 \nI think it's\u2026 \nI'm absolutely \ncertain it's\u2026 \n87.50 7.29 5.21 \nI'm fairly \nconfident it's\u2026 \nI'm absolutely \ncertain it's\u2026 \n83.33 8.33 8.33 \n \n1 just above 3, 4, 5 and 6). Then, for each pair of expressions, the percentage of \nparticipants who rated one higher than the other in the predicted direction was \ncalculated, along with the percentage who rated them equally, and finally the \npercentage who rated one higher than the other but in the order opposite that \npredicted. Table 2 shows that most participants\u2019 ratings rated the expressions in the \npredicted direction. When there was less clarity and some people rated the two \ncues as equal, the expressions compared were only one rating unit apart on the \nrating scale. One comparison, between \u2015I think it\u2019s...\u201d and \u2015I\u2019m fairly confident \nit\u2019s...\u201d, resulted in around 15% of people rating the expressions in the direction \nopposite to that predicted. These expressions are in the middle of the scale, and it \nappears that there may be more ambiguity there about the degree of confidence \nthat they express.  \nAnalyses for sex differences for each individual expression (past and present \ntense) were not performed because of the small number of men in the sample (n=5 \nmen were in the present tense condition). An overall analysis examining sex \ndifferences, with expressions as the unit of analysis rather than participants, was \nperformed and this showed that there were no significant sex differences between \nmen (M = 4.39, SD = 1.42) and women (M = 4.42, SD = 1.11) in their ratings of \nthe past tense expressions (t58 = -0.097, p = .92). A similar analysis also showed no \nsignificant sex differences in ratings of the present tense expressions (men: M = \n5.10, SD = 1.09; women: M = 4.72, SD = 1.25; t58 = 1.255, p = .21.)  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe rank ordering of the confidence expressions developed in this study \nsupport previous research finding that expressions of certainty fall along a \ncontinuum (Foley, 1959; Berry, 1960; Feezel, 1974; Fabre, 1991). The higher-\nranked expressions convey greater confidence in a statement \u2014what one knows to \nbe true\u2014and can be represented by expressions such as \u2015I\u2018m absolutely certain \nit\u2018s....\u201d The more moderately-ranked confidence expressions convey less certainty \nin the accuracy of the statement, and are thus conveyed through expressions such \nas \u2015I believe it\u2018s\u2026.\u201d The lowest-ranked confidence expressions convey the most \nuncertainty in the accuracy of the statement; hence, expressions such as \u2015I suppose \nit could be\u2026\u201d are used to communicate doubt or low confidence.  \nIn addition to the expressions falling along a continuum of confidence, the \nordering of the words positive, certain, sure, think, and suppose, in terms of the \nrated confidence, was consistent with other studies (Foley, 1959; Berry, 1960; \nFabre, 1991). Finally, similarities in the ordering of the cues developed in the \npresent study can be drawn with the smaller pool of cues used by Pulford (2002), \nwho investigated their persuasiveness.  \nOverall, the confidence expressions developed in this study have been found  \n  \nto cover a wide range of degrees of confidence and doubt, and the ratings are in \nagreement with previous findings that had used a much smaller set of phrases. \nWhen considering cues for use in research it should be noted that previous \nresearch has found there to be a great deal of overlap between terms of uncertainty \n(see Druzdzel, 1989; Clark, 1990). For this reason, if researchers are to investigate \nthe influence of degrees of confidence, such as the relative influence of high, \nmedium, and low confidence, expressions should be selected that are rated \nsufficiently far apart from each other to eliminate ambiguity.  \nIn selecting expressions for use in future research, consideration should also \nbe given to the past- or present-tense phrasing, as some expressions appear to \nconvey slightly different degrees of certainty, depending on the tense. There are, \nhowever, many expressions which do not result in different ratings according to \ntheir tense and these could be selected for research if so desired. Whether the tense \nretains some influence when the expressions are attached to actual information \nremains to be studied. Findings indicate that speaking about confidence in the \npresent tense usually conveys greater confidence and certainty than when using \npast tense, although the effect was weak. Examining Table 1 indicates that most of \nthe significant differences in tense are in the middle of the range of confidence \nrange, where there may be more ambiguity about the degree of confidence, as \ncompared to the top and bottom of the scale where certainty or doubt is less \nmistakable. The present-tense phrase \u2015it is\u201d may sound more certain than the past-\ntense phrase \u2015it was,\u201d perhaps because it implies a current judgment rather than a \nmemory, which is possibly more fallible. The directionality of the expression may \nalso be important, as research in the field of verbal probability expressions has \nshown that there are different effects of positive and negative expressions of \nuncertainty and how they are interpreted (Teigen & Brun, 1995, 1999). The \nparallel in confidence communication is worthy of future investigation.  \nFinally, whether these results remain consistent when translated into other \nlanguages, or even in other English-speaking cultures, is something worth \ninvestigating. The persuasive effect of confidence expressions on listeners also \nremains an intriguing question, and authors such as Blankenship and Craig (2006) \nhave concluded that \u2015it is clear that linguistic cues have distinct and important \neffects on message processing\u201d (p. 126). It is hoped that this set of expressions will \nprove useful for researchers who are studying how people\u2019s expressions of \nconfidence influence such things as impression formation, attitude change, and \nadvice taking in experimental and applied settings.  \n \n  \nREFERENCES \nAstington, J.
