Large European companies increasingly \ndisclose equality and diversity policies in statements on websites. Such statements may be used to \npromote an ethical image of the company in terms of how well it manages diversity and guards \nagainst discrimination. In this paper we argue that diversity statement discourses are important as they \nplay a key part in socially constructing how diversity should be regarded in the company by minority \nand majority groups, as well as indicating corporate values to external stakeholders (investors, \ngovernment, community, press etc.). Sometimes, the notions of gender or ethnic diversity are \npositioned as a liability in need of protection, whilst in others, as a source of competitive advantage. \nWe find evidence of use of discursive tools such as problematisation, rationalisation, fixation, \nreframing and naturalisation of the notions of gender and ethnic diversity, reinforced by use of \nsymbols, such as statistics, photographs, membership badges and awards. Few statements directly \nassociate gender and ethnic diversity with enhanced corporate performance. We found that diversity \nstatements sometimes appear to be reinforce existing business stereotypes of women and people from \nethnic minorities, and in a few discourses, create new ones, particularly evident in photographs \nillustrating the diversity web pages.  \nKey words: Diversity, Gender, Ethnicity, Discourse, Corporate Websites, Europe \n \nIntroduction \nCorporate websites provide a useful means of \ncommunicating corporate values and policies, \nand recently many large companies have started \nto include \u201cdiversity statements\u201d on their \nwebsites. They are akin to mission statements, \nand are increasingly used as \u201cwindow-dressing\u201d \nto highlight the employer\u2019s good corporate social \ncitizenship and ethical management practices \n(Winter, Saunders and Hart, 2003). They may \nbe viewed as artefacts that reveal information \nabout the corporate culture and play a dynamic \nrole in the realisation of values (Hatch, 1993). \nDiversity statements are important because of \ntheir role in the social construction of diversity, \nthrough their discourses helping to shape how \ndifferences are to be considered, valued and \nmanaged in companies and the business world. \nApart from Kirby and Harter (2003) and Bellard \nand R\u00fcling (2001), there are very few studies of \nthe use of diversity discourses in the new \nmedium of the internet, which is of increasing \nimportance for stakeholders to gather \nknowledge and for companies to disseminate \ninformation. Diversity issues in Europe have \n 2\ngained much publicity over the last two years, \nwith increased pressure from governments and \nthe European Commission (EC, 2004) for \ndiscrimination to be tackled. Point and Singh \n(2003) highlighted the increasing trend for \nEuropean companies to promote diversity on \nwebsites, and noted that of the 27 diversity \ndimensions mentioned in diversity statements, \ngender and ethnicity were the most frequently \ncited, usually in a long list of anti-discrimination \npolicy dimensions.  \nThe aim of this paper is to unravel the specific \nnotions of gender and ethnicity promoted by \ncompanies in web-based \u2018diversity statements\u2019 \nto see how they are positioned within the \nmanaging diversity discourses. The specific aim \nof our analysis is to uncover the micro-level \ndiscursive practices that form part of the social \nconstruction of diversity, in particular gender and \nethnic diversity. The paper is structured as \nfollows: first we consider the social construction \nof gender and ethnicity, and then the role of \ndiversity discourses in that process. We review \nthe few existing empirical studies of diversity \ndiscourses. Critical discourse analysis focuses \non the relationship between discourse (usually \ntexts) and other elements of social change \n(Fairclough, 2005). Our theoretical framework \ndraws on Vaara, Kleymann and Serist\u00f6 (2004), \nwho developed a typology of discourse framing \nprocesses (problematisation, rationalisation, \nfixation, reframing and naturalisation). We then \noutline our methods of data gathering and \nhandling, and present our empirical analysis of \ndata from 241 websites of large companies in \neight European countries. Finally we consider \nthe implications for practitioners and make \nsuggestions for further research. \nThe Social Construction of Gender and \nEthnicity \nWhilst individuals in most countries are assigned \nas either male or female at birth, their gender is \ndeveloped to a great extent by the way in which \nmale and female roles are promoted by \nsignificant influences in society. Such gender \nrole socialisation starts in the family, but carries \non into adulthood within various institutions of \nsociety. In the organisational world, the \nconstructs of leadership and management have \nbeen developed by males for male patterns of \nemployment. Hence organisations can be said \nto be gendered, producing and reproducing \ngendered relations where the female is seen as \nless suited for senior roles, and as in need of \nprotection (Acker, 1990; Benschop and \nMeihuizen, 2002). However, there are not only \ngender inequalities but ethnic inequalities too. \nThe patriarchal system privileges the dominant \nethnic group, which in Europe is white as well as \nmale. Equality and diversity policies help to \nshape gendered and ethnic roles by indicating \nhow such differences are to be treated and \nmanaged. In this process, diverse individuals \nexperience their roles and expectations about \nthose roles, which in turn influence how they see \nthemselves and how others see them. \nFairclough (1995) argues that organisational \ntexts (in our study, diversity statements) have \ntwo subfunctions: a role in the constitution of \npersonal and social identities, and a relational \nfunction that helps to constitute relationships \nbetween them. One way to gain insight into this \nphenomenon is to analyse the language used in \ncorporate policy and public relations documents, \nto see how the notions of gender and ethnic \ndiversity are portrayed on corporate websites, a \nnew arena for such disclosures. \nDiversity Discourses \nDiscourse is a term used for linguistic and other \nsemiotic elements (such as visual images) of a \nsocial phenomenon. Discourse \u201ccontributes to \nthe construction of social identities, social \nrelations and systems of knowledge and \nmeaning\u201d in organisations (Phillips and \nJ\u00f8rgensen, 2002, p.67). Diversity discourses are \nconveyed therefore through language, symbols \nand images, which signal the way it is to be \ninterpreted, managed and valued by \nstakeholders of the company, including diverse \npresent or future employees. Hence we will \nexamine diversity statements mentioning gender \nand ethnic diversity as texts, as processes of \ncommunication and as agents in the \nconstruction and maintenance of the meaning of \ndiversity in the business world (Fairclough, \n1995; Hardy et al., 2000; Alvesson and \nKarreman, 2000). In organisational life, senior \nmanagement has the power to define the \ndesirable traits and behaviours that lead to \nrecruitment and promotion of junior staff. In the \nEuropean business world, senior management \nmeans white males. That power is expressed in \nlanguage, whether in the description of job \nadvertisements, policies and codes of practice \nor the sponsorship of applicants for promotion. \nLorbiecki and Jack (2000) suggest that even in \nthe new philosophy of managing differences, \ncertain differences are feared and hence have to \nbe controlled. However, gender and racial\/ethnic \nconflicts and tensions might be depoliticised by \ndiversity management policies, as the business \nface of diversity management may be more \nacceptable than equal opportunities to the \ndominant group of white males. \nMany companies publicly commit themselves to \nchange, to welcome diversity and to encourage \n 3\nmore women and members of ethnic minorities \nto join them. In a study of business codes of \nmultinational firms, Kaptein (2004) revealed that \n44% of 200 large companies reported formal \nanti-discrimination codes of practice, 31% \nmentioned valuing diversity or equality, 35% \nmentioned respect, 26% mentioned not allowing \nsexual harassment and 12% not allowing \nracism. Bellard and R\u00fcling (2001) examined the \nmanaging diversity discourse on US, French and \nGerman company websites, finding that the \nbusiness case perspective was not yet \nembedded in discourses of the European \ncompanies. Kirby and Harter (2003) surveyed \ntexts in a small number of diversity consultant \nwebsites, finding that discussions of diversity \nand equality were mainly focused on exploitation \nof diversity for the employer\u2019s advantage. \nIndeed, they comment that the very term \n\u201cdiversity management\u201d is a metaphor where \npeople have been removed. The discourse of \ndiversity as something to be harnessed indicates \nthat the company is the intended beneficiary, \nrather than the diverse individual. Half of top \nEuropean companies use equality or diversity \ndiscourses by putting diversity or equality \nstatements on-line, ranging from 86% of top UK \nfirms to only 21% of those in Finland (Point and \nSingh, 2003). Diversity discourses can also be \ncommunicated through photographs, which are \nsymbolic artefacts of the organisational culture, \nmanifesting the values of the company and \ndynamically creating and setting expectations \nabout how diversity is to be dealt with (Hatch, \n1993). Benschop and Meihuizen (2002) found \nevidence of reinforcement of gender role \nstereotyping in the photographs in Dutch \ncompany annual reports, serving to prolong the \nprocesses of domination of those who are \nvisually different. Similarly, in a study of \nexecutives portrayed in the US business press, \nKrefting (2002) reported problematization of the \nwomen as leaders in comparison to male \nexecutives, echoing as well as reinforcing \ngendered social relations. \nMany leading companies have recognised the \nneed to consider the relative positions in their \nworkforce of women, those from ethnic \nminorities, and disabled people. In France, for \nexample, there are recommendations for a \ndiversity charter to recognise companies that \nsupport cultural and ethnic diversity. \nConsequently, many European companies, and \nparticularly those in the UK, have adopted the \nmanaging diversity discourse \u2013 to value and \nutilise differences within the work place. That \ndiscourse can be used as a strategic resource \n(Hardy et al., 2000), enabling the policy to be \ndesigned, promoted and embedded to create \nthe desired change from the earlier discourse of \nequal opportunities and anti-discrimination.  \nCritical Discourse Analysis \nTaking a social constructionist perspective, we \nfollow Fairclough\u2019s (1995, 2005) critical \ndiscourse analysis approach, concerned with \nrelations between social events (such as the \nadoption of new diversity management \nphilosophies) and the discourses that shape and \nare shaped by these relationships. Fairclough \nsees discourses not just as texts but as \u2018orders \nof discourse\u2019 contextually ordered in time and \nspace, and subject to social interaction. Thus, \ndiscourses belong to genres, and diversity \nstatements would be situated in and limited by \nconventions both for managing diversity and for \ndisclosures of corporate values and policy on \nwebsites, at a given point in time. However, the \nstyle of the disclosure would vary depending \nupon the various instigators of the discourse and \nthe media in which it is disclosed. Each of these \nconstituents of the order of discourse may be \ninfluenced by the interactions between them, \nand the sources of power that sustain or change \nthem. Hence critical discourse analysis seeks to \ninvestigate the interdiscursive elements of texts: \nthe linguistic and semiotic elements, the social \nproduction and consumption of the texts and the \nsocial practices that change and are changed by \nthe discourse.  \nWe will analyse diversity discourses embedded \nin corporate policy pages on websites. Rather \nthan undertaking a linguistic approach to \nanalysing these texts, for our analytical \nframework, we focus more on the promotion of \nthe discourses. We draw on work by Vaara, \nKleymann and Serist\u00f6 (2004), who identified five \ntypes of discursive practices in texts containing \ndiscourses on airline alliance strategies: \nproblematisation, rationalisation, fixation, \nreframing and naturalisation. Vaara et al. \ncomment that agents use discourses in the \ncontext of power relations, sometimes switching \ndiscourses to suit or legitimise their actions, not \nnecessarily believing in the content of their \ndiscourse. These discursive practices are \nutilised by actors, who influence others, who in \nturn influence the discursive practices, such as \npromotion of diversity management discourses, \nreformulating corporate objectives and policies \nand changing identities. This analytical \nframework allows us to examine the method of \nsocial production of the texts, and to consider \nthe impact upon the consumption of the \ndiscourses. \nProblematisation is the \u2018construction\u2019 of a \nproblem via the discursive framing of an object \n 4\nin a negative way. In terms of diversity, this is \nrelated to the discrimination and fairness \nperspective that sees difference as a cause of \nproblems (Dass and Parker, 1999). This often is \nevidenced in website statements revealing anti-\ndiscrimination and equal opportunities \nmanagement policies (Singh and Point, \n2004).This policy positions those who are \ndifferent as in need of protection, unless more \npositive messages are also given about valuing \ndiversity. Rationalisation means providing a \nexplanation for the treatment of the \nphenomenon, here the justification and \narguments for managing diversity. This \napproach is related to the access and legitimacy \nperspective that frames diversity as creating \nbusiness opportunities (Dass and Parker, 1999). \nIt also leads into the argument for particular \nbenefits from managing diversity, such as better \nperformance, enhanced reputation and an \ninclusive workplace (Singh and Point, 2004). \nFixation refers to the persistence of particular \ndeeply-held values and views that are \nexpressed even as other arguments are made \nthat are incompatible with those views. As far as \ndiversity discourses are concerned, the liberal \nview that the cream will always rise to the top \nand so only minimal interventions are needed to \naddress discrimination may be a fixation that \ncould explain why so little progress has been \nmade by equal opportunities management \npolicies.  \nReframing refers to the change in positioning of \nthe issue, identifying the problem but focusing \non solutions, for example. In the Vaara et al. \nstudy, reframing occurred by setting out the \nproblems of airline alliances, but focusing on \nputting the new strategies into practice. The \ncriticism of the initial idea (the alliances) was \ndeflected into criticism of the execution of the \nnew discourse, protecting the new idea from \ndirect critique. The naturalisation of a discourse \nmeans that it has been so deeply embedded into \ndiscourses about the way forward that \nalternatives are no longer under discussion.  \nMethodology \nEarly in 2003, we downloaded web pages from \nthe top 241 companies from eight countries \n(Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, \nNorway, Sweden, Switzerland and UK), selected \non the basis of their inclusion at the top of their \nrespective national stock exchange lists. We \nsampled top companies as they would be likely \nto be among the first to face the impact of the \nshrinking talent pool, globalisation and increased \ncalls for transparency of corporate governance \nand social responsibility. A key advantage of the \nuse of websites is that data can be collected \nfrom every company in the sample, in contrast to \nuse of a survey where a low response rate \nwould be likely, given the sensitive nature of the \nissue under enquiry. However, we are limited to \nanalysis of the actual discourses presented, and \nconsideration only of the potential impact on \nsocial relations, as we do not know to what \nextent these discourses were enacted, nor the \nactual impact upon audiences other than \nourselves. Nonetheless, as reflective \nresearchers, in the act of deconstructing the \nwebsites statements, we are also part of the \naudience, as we have considered the embedded \nmeanings within these discourses and the \nreadings which we would understand from them. \nEvery company in our sample had a corporate \nwebsite with similar pages in English and in the \nhome languages (except for one Finnish \ncompany with just Finnish pages). We found \ndiversity and\/or equality mentions at various \nlocations, ranging from corporate values pages \nat high levels to corporate social responsibility \npages, and careers or human resource \nmanagement policies, often buried down several \nlevels on the websites. The location of the \ndiversity statement was itself a property of the \ndiscourse, as high page level is an indicator of \nthe importance with which the company views \nthe issue of diversity (Lymer, 1996), and the \npage positioning such as \u2018Careers\u2019 indicated the \ntarget group of stakeholders for the message. \nWe also used the search engines in both \nEnglish and the home languages. \nWe downloaded all the relevant material, and \nprepared the texts for analysis using QSR \nNudist 5. Together, we set up a detailed coding \nscheme, defining and structuring our nodes, \nadjusting coding through frequent joint \ndiscussions for consistency. Main coding \nbranches contained the properties of the \ndiversity statements themselves, the dimensions \nof diversity, the drivers for diversity and the \nstage of the journey from equality to diversity \nmanagement. (These findings are reported \nelsewhere.) Next, we decided to undertake a \nseparate critical discourse analysis of the texts, \ntaking an in-depth look at the micro-level \ndiscourses around gender and ethnicity. Within \nan overall realist perspective which allows for a \nsocial constructionist approach (Fairclough, \n2005), we deconstructed the diversity \nstatements again, using critical discourse \nanalysis to examine the texts, the contexts and \nthe visual images. We re-read the texts looking \nfor elements of discourses suggested by \nFairclough (1995), and constructed a coding \nbranch which eventually had nodes for the \n 5\ndiscursive practices outlined in Vaara et al. \n(2004), i.e. problematisation, rationalisation, \nfixation, reframing and naturalisation, and a \nbranch for other discursive tools supporting the \ndiscourse (images, symbols, statistics).  \nFINDINGS \nFirst we present the international differences in \nmentions of gender and ethnic diversity on \ncorporate websites, before examining the ways \nin which these particular categories of diversity \nwere presented. Analysis of diversity statements \nrevealed that companies use a variety of \ndiscursive tools, including framing their \ncompany\u2019s particular approach to managing \ndiversity, and supporting these by symbolic \ndepictions (photographs, awards etc) and \ncareful use of statistics. \n \n \nTable I: Companies mentioning gender and ethnic diversity in diversity statements  \nSample (241 Companies) Finlan\nd \nFrance Germany Netherland\ns \nNorwa\ny \nSwede\nn \nSwitzerlan\nd \nUK \nMentioning gender and ethnicity 12% 5% 11% 44% 6% 20% 8% 62%\nMentioning gender 23% 13% 29% 44% 17% 33% 20% 72%\nMentioning ethnicity 12% 5% 11% 44% 5% 23% 16% 70%\n  \nWebsites mentioning Gender and Ethnic \nDiversity  \nWe found that 174 of the 241 websites gave \nsome dimensions of diversity especially in their \nanti-discrimination lists (stating that \ndiscrimination would not be allowed on grounds \nof a number of dimensions) of which 48% of \nthose mentioned gender\/sex and 37% \nrace\/ethnicity. Table I shows the results for \ncompanies by country. It is interesting that Dutch \ncompanies either mention both gender and \nethnicity, or neither, whereas only 8% of Swiss \ncompanies mention both but 20% mention \ngender. Almost as many UK companies mention \nboth gender and ethnicity (62%) as the single \ndimensions of gender (72%) and ethnicity \n(70%). \nGender\/sex equality was the most common \ndimension noted, particularly for the UK, \nSweden and Finland, but this was mentioned \nonly by a fifth of French companies with diversity \nor equality statements. We coded both sex and \ngender to one node, but sex was mentioned by \n27 companies, 49 preferred to use the term \ngender, and the remaining seven used both \nterms.  \nFollowing practice in the UK, where \u201cethnic \nmonitoring\u201d is recommended by the Commission \nfor Racial Equality to identify any instances and \nconsequences of racial discrimination in the \nworkplace, we coded race and ethnicity together \nas one category of difference. Race\/ethnicity \nwas mentioned by 64 websites, with three sites \nincluding colour as a separate dimension. \nHowever, 51 sites mentioned nationality or \ncountry of origin, which may or may not be \nclosely associated with race and ethnicity. \nFrench and German companies were more likely \nto use the term \u201cculture\u201d without defining what \nthey meant by the term, so we are unclear \nwhether they intended \u2018culture\u2019 to include race \nand ethnicity dimensions.  \nThe Diversity Discourses \nFrom Vaara et al.\u2019s (2004) typology of \ndiscourses, we identified four different \ndiscourses promoting gender and ethnicity in \nEuropean corporate websites. These were \nproblematisation, rationalisation, reframing and \nnaturalising. We will examine each of these in \nturn. \nProblematisation of Gender and Ethnic \nDiversity  \nSometimes diversity and its management were \nproblematised. One could argue that the very \nabsence of the term \u2018diversity\u2019 was a \nproblematisation, in that the issue was not even \non the agenda for the commissioners or authors \nof web pages for the 68 companies (28%) with \nno statement on diversity or equality on their \nwebsites. This ranged from 2% of top UK \ncompanies to 43% of Finnish companies. We do \nnot know who was responsible for this omission, \nnor whether the head of strategic management, \nthe HR department or public relations \ndepartment were involved in the corporate \nwebsite texts. The most common way of \nproblematising diversity was to present diversity \nonly as something in need of policing and \nprotection, with no mention of respecting, \nvaluing or utilising diversity. Sixteen companies \nreported only that they would not allow \n 2\ndiscrimination on a range of diversity \ndimensions.  \nHennes, Sweden: No worker should be \ndiscriminated against because of race, \ngender, religion or ethnic background. \nEven though the statement was made with \npresumed good intentions, there is still a \nnegative association, which may be picked up \nby the reader, if that is the only mention of \ndiversity.  \nRationalisation of Gender and Ethnic \nDiversity  \nMany companies presented a rationale as to \nwhy gender and ethnic diversity were important. \nThis allowed for justification of the company\u2019s \ndecision to value diversity, i.e. wider \nlegitimisation of the strategy of those with the \npower to make such a decision, and a tool to \nconvince those resisting the new approach by \nproviding a rational argument for it (Suchman, \n1995).  \nNokia, Finland: We must always hire the \nbest people we can find. By definition, this \nincludes people of diverse nationalities \nand cultural backgrounds. \nB\u00e2loise rationalised the need for equal \nopportunities for men and women, but also \nindicated their progressive facilitation of work\/life \nbalance by provision of support systems for \nwomen with children.  \nB\u00e2loise, Switzerland: An environment \nconducive to top-notch performance \nincludes equal opportunities for men and \nwomen, evidenced by practice. Women \nwith children are offered flexible working \nhours and the use of a cr\u00e8che at the \nGroup's Head Office in Basel, which \nfacilitates a satisfactory combination of \ncareer and family. \nThey did not, however, state that men were also \noffered flexible working and use of the cr\u00e8che \nfacilities. Perhaps men at work are not \nassociated with family responsibilities, in a \ncountry where women often do not return to \ndevelop careers, but provide support to their \ncareer-oriented husbands. In this discourse, only \nfemale employees were constructed as \u2018parents \nwho need childcare support\u2019. However, \nSwisscom, took a slightly different approach in \nexplaining that they did not need special \ntreatment for women because they had \nadequate equality policies, with 14% of senior \nmanagers being female in relation to their 36% \nfemale workforce. Commerzbank revealed that \nthey had been helping parents to gain work\/life \nbalance since 1989, unusual policies at that \ntime. They provide a strong rationale, using the \nmetaphor of the level playing field, \nacknowledging that equal opportunities \nmanagement had not provided an adequate \nstructure for women to develop and make a full \ncontribution. They appear to be proactive in their \nmanaging diversity strategies, and acknowledge \nthat diversity includes women who want careers, \nand men and women with various lifestyle \nresponsibilities and choices.  \nSome companies painstakingly set out their \narguments for diversity including gender and \nethnicity, particularly about the need to reflect \nthe diversity of the market \u2013 the business case \nrather than the social justice or moral case. A \ngood example is the Electrolux statement, where \nthere is reinforcement of the message after the \ncase has been explained, to remind readers that \ndiversity is an asset. They used a rhetorical \ndevice at the end of the statement, challenging \nreaders to consider their own perspective. \nElectrolux, Sweden: At Electrolux, we are \nmaking constant efforts to improve our \nperspectives on global business \nmanagement and to broaden our \nrecruiting base. We have a diversity of \ncustomers in nationality, age, gender and \nethnic background. In order to serve them \nwell, we aim to reflect market diversity \nwith internal diversity. This will help \nincrease our sensitivity to local needs and \ncultural biases. Diversity, in other words, \nis an asset. It provides productive \ntensions and creativity in our \nmanagement, process and development \nteams. It is at the core of our recruitment. \nWe encourage diversity. Do you? \nFixation \nWe found little direct evidence of fixation of the \ndiversity discourse. Fixation means the retention \nof former discourses and resistance to the new. \nWe found no statements rejecting equality or \ndiversity management. However, it could be held \nthat the absence of any mention of diversity or \nequality on 28% of the 241 websites indicates \nlack of appreciation of its importance in the \nsocial construction of diversity relations in those \ncompanies, and perhaps fixation on liberal views \nthat the best talent will always come through \nregardless of gender, diversity etc. There were a \nnumber of statements reinforcing the message \nthat the companies were solid meritocracies, \nwithout indicating any strategies for valuing or \nmanaging diversity.  \n 3\nSulzer, Switzerland: Co-workers can \nexpect salaries based on performance \nand success, opportunities for personal \ndevelopment and individual support, free \nof discrimination. \nReframing of Diversity Problem as \nImplementation Issues \nThe actors involved in creating the discourse of \ndiversity management often locate this within the \ncontext of an earlier discourse, equal \nopportunities, but move the arguments forward. \nFor example, Adecco reported that they were \nrunning workshops on discrimination and \ndiversity awareness. \nAdecco, Switzerland: Based upon the \nsuccess of its Diversity programme, \nAdecco in France signed an agreement \nwith FASILD and the French Labour \nMinistry to work together with companies \nto support the spread of diversity 'best \npractice' to other sectors. This involves \nproviding expertise for activities such as \nstaff meetings focused upon \ndiscrimination issues, implementing task \nforces to identify and address possible \ndiscrimination risks, sensitise companies \nand colleague training.  \nSimilarly, the UK retail chemists, Boots, reported \non the website that they had set up a series of \nbriefings, and that they monitored the \ndemographic composition of their workforce, \nwhilst Alliance & Leicester stated that they \nsought to improve the diversity \u2018problem\u2019 via \nconstructive discussions, indicating that perhaps \nthere had been less constructive discussions in \nthe past. Another example is Kingfisher, who \nreferred to potential damage to reputation from \nnot managing diversity well. However, the \nsecond sentence associates diversity with the \npositive benefits in terms of improved customer \nservice, so the statement is framed to end on \nthe positive side of the business case. \nKingfisher, UK: Any organisation that has \ndiscrimination in its workforce based on \ngender, colour, race or physical ability is \nat the very least in danger of harming its \nreputation, and may be liable to \nprosecution. In today's retail environment, \na business that understands and respects \nthe diverse needs and values of its \nemployees and customers has a \ncompetitive edge. \nTelenor grounds its approach in a social justice \nrationale, indicating that they still had work to do \nto achieve the desired state. This would be a \njoint action for management and unions, the \nstated agents for implementation of dialogue. \nTelia makes a statement about working towards \na more balanced work\/leisure environment for \nemployees, rather than work\/family balance \u2013 \nthus avoiding potential backlash from men and \nwomen with no childcare responsibilities. \nTelenor, Norway: The Group has an equal \nopportunities policy. The aim of this policy \nis to ensure that no job application or staff \nmember receives less favourable \ntreatment on the grounds of race, colour, \nreligion, nationality, ethnic or national \norigin, sexual orientation, marital status or \nphysical disability. The Group continues to \nparticipate in a joint management\/union \nequal opportunities forum to better \nfacilitate constructive dialogue on equality \nissues.  \nTelia, Sweden: Since the beginning of the \n1990s, we have endeavoured to improve \nthe balance between women and men in \nvarious positions within the Group. We \nhave also been working toward an \nenvironment in which employees can feel \nthat it is acceptable to combine their \ncareers with their leisure activities.  \nIndeed, discourses are always located within a \ncontext of earlier discourses, but the link is not \nalways explicitly made. However, the Dutch \ncompany ING first define what they mean by \ndiversity, and what valuing diversity means in \npractice. The view of diversity for competitive \nadvantage is then spelt out, and embedded \nwithin HR policy commitments.  \nING, Netherlands: We define 'valuing \ndiversity' as accepting and respecting \nindividual differences arising out of \nvariation in race, ethnicity, gender, age, \nsexual orientation, socio-economic status, \nphysical abilities, religious beliefs, or other \nideologies. For ING this implies a balance \nbetween men and women, young and old, \nand between different ethnic groups and \nnationalities. We also want to offer a good \nworking environment for part-timers and \nemployees with a disability. We consider \ndiversity to be not only a social \nresponsibility but a long-term business \nadvantage. Encouraging diversity at all \nlevels of the organisation is therefore an \nimportant theme in our human resources \npolicy, in our commitment to socially \nresponsible entrepreneurship, and in our \nbusiness strategy. \n 4\nSimilar statements were found from other \ncompanies, including the Swedish \nHandelsbanken. \nNaturalisation of Diversity as Competitive \nAdvantage \nAs the discourses are promoted, and begin to \nresonate with the audiences, the companies can \nstart to present their diversity policies as the \nnatural and obvious way forward, sound \ncommon sense, and not to be challenged. This \nmay be done by pointing out the obvious, as \nABB does, very similar to the statement of Nokia \nabout cultural diversity. \nABB, Sweden\/Switzerland: ABB wants to \nachieve the best performance possible in \nall areas of the company. To do this, it \nneeds the best people in the market. And \nobviously the best people will consist of \nboth men and women. \nNokia, Finland: We must always hire the \nbest people we can find. By definition, this \nincludes people of diverse nationalities \nand cultural backgrounds. \nAnother way of naturalising the discourse is to \nindicate very high levels of support for it. \nBarclays does this by indicating that very senior \nexecutives have signed a charter, whilst Phillips \ninforms the reader that ethnic diversity fits with \nthe company\u2019s general business principles, in \nboth cases leaving little uncertainty about the \nimportance of this discourse to those in power.  \nBarclays, UK: Our view is that Equality \nand Diversity must be integrated into \neverything we do and to achieve this we \nhave put in place a demanding global \nstrategy. Our most senior executives have \npersonally signed a charter entitled \n\"Success through Inclusion\" setting out \nour vision and commitment to equality and \ndiversity for our employees, our \ncustomers, for the community and for \nshareholders.  \nSometimes the diversity statements are made \nwith incontestable panache \u2013 as is the case of \nNobel Biocare. After confirming that gender \nissues are of central importance, they inform us \nthat women hold the two most senior executive \npositions on the board. \nNobel Biocare, Sweden: To ensure the \navailability of competence inside the \ncompany, Nobel Biocare strives to give all \nemployees the same opportunities to \ndevelop. Gender equality issues are \ntherefore of central importance to Nobel \nBiocare, 50 percent of whose employees \nare female. The central role played by \ngender quality issues is demonstrated not \nleast by the relatively large and growing \npercentage of women in leading positions. \nOf recent managerial appointments, 90 \npercent involved women. This includes \nthe CEO and CFO. \nThe Discourse of Gender Diversity as \nCompetitive Advantage \nInterestingly, only 15 of 241 companies (6%) \nreferred specifically to gender diversity as a \nsource of competitive advantage and improved \nperformance. Four of these referred to the \nrecruitment and talent management aspects, but \nfocused on different aspects. Fortum and ABB \nemphasised better performance. \nFortum, Finland: Women account for \napproximately 10% of the top \nmanagement. At Fortum, we believe, \nhowever, that a more even breakdown by \ngender will give us a competitive edge in \nthe future, both on the market and in \ncompeting for the possible personnel. \nHowever, the French engineering company, \nAlstom, emphasised the enhanced creativity and \nbetter decision-making that come from gender \ndiversity, but as is common in French \nstatements, they did not mention ethnic \ndiversity. \nAlstom has several reasons to recruit \nwomen into its teams, because it is a \ncompany that: is constantly on the lookout \nfor new expertise, is rapidly developing its \nservice business, and needs diversity to \npromote creativity and decision-making. \nWe have thus decided to actively promote \nthe recruitment of women. It's not by \nchance that the companies doing best are \nalso the ones that have the most women \nin key positions!  \nFraming gender diversity in an equal \nopportunities discourse, Nobel Biocare reported \ntheir rationale for this as a competence \ndevelopment issue for the organisation. The UK \nretail company GUS indicated that it saw gender \nand race as characteristics from which others \ncould learn, indicating that they fell into the \nproactive learning category identified by Dass \nand Parker (1999). \nNobel Biocare, Sweden: To ensure that \nNobel Biocare can recruit, keep and \ndevelop the right competence, it is a pre-\nrequisite that all employees are given the \nsame opportunities within the company. \nThus, gender equality and respect for \n 5\npeople regardless of age, cultural and \nethnical background is of central \nimportance to Nobel Biocare. \nGUS, UK: We believe that companies \nbenefit from a diverse workforce, with a \ngood mix of gender, ages, races and \nbackgrounds. It means that people can \nlearn from each other.  \nThis is in contrast to the way that most of the 88 \ncompanies in the sample mentioning diversity \nfor competitive advantage positioned this at the \nmore general level of diversity, seemingly \nignoring the fact that the largest minority group \nunder-represented in management in these \neight countries is likely to be female employees. \nPerhaps this is seen as a more acceptable or \nless threatening management approach, as \nmany other minority groups will form a much \nsmaller percentage of the workforce and hence \nwill not be competing with white males on the \nsame scale. \nTo determine whether espoused gender \ndiversity policies are manifested by gender \ndiversity on the corporate board, we can use \naccurate secondary data on the same 50 UK \nfirms (in this study) gathered for the Female \nFTSE 100 Index 2003 (Singh and Vinnicombe, \n2003). We found diversity or equality statements \non 49 of the top 50 company websites, and 44 \ncompanies had female directors. Indeed they \nhad 68 (67%) of the total 101 female directors in \nthe FTSE 100 Index. Of these 44 companies, 38 \npromoted diversity management strategies, 34 \nof them suggesting competitive advantage \nrationales. Importantly, only five companies \npromoting diversity management had no women \ndirectors in 2003. Therefore it would appear that \n38 of the 50 top UK companies, by their \nappointments at board level, are starting to \nenact the valuing gender diversity discourse. \nThe Discourse of Ethnic Diversity as \nCompetitive Advantage  \nOnly ten companies (4%) specifically referred to \nethnicity as a source of competitive advantage, \nincluding nine of the companies identifying \ngender diversity too. This is in stark contrast to \nits very prominent listing in the anti-\ndiscrimination lists, usually in first or second \nposition, indicating that ethnic diversity still is \nmainly considered as in need of protection. \nExceptionally, the chemicals company, BOC, not \nonly promotes ethnic diversity in its web \nstatements for contributing through the company \nto improvement of people\u2019s lives but this \ncompany reflects diversity in the composition of \nits board, with 17% of their board from ethnic \nminorities as well as having a female director \n(Singh, 2004).  \nBOC, UK: The BOC Group is truly global \nand values the rich ethnic and cultural \ndiversity of its people. Their dedication, \ncommitment and talent have made a \ndifference to the lives of ordinary people \nacross the world for over a hundred years. \nThe Norwegian company, Orkla, was one of the \nfew to be specific about both gender and ethnic \ndiversity in terms of competitive advantage, \nalthough Orkla takes a very normative approach \n(it \u201cmust be valued and utilised\u201d) and does not \nstate why. Phillips has a more vague statement \nabout the enrichment of society rather than the \ntheir own business, but it is powerfully \npositioned as a company business principle. \nOrkla, Norway: Personal differences in \nage or gender and ethnic, national and \ncultural differences constitute a valuable \ndiversity that must be respected and \nutilised in the best interests of the \ncompetitiveness of the Group. \nPhillips, Netherlands: The company's \ngeneral business principles hold that \n'Ethnic and cultural differences throughout \nthe world enrich society'.  \nFrench and German companies in particular \nseem to avoid the term ethnic\/racial diversity, \ndespite both countries having large populations \nof immigrants from different ethnic backgrounds. \nSometimes the discourse is non-specific about \nethnicity but does specify gender diversity. \nInfineon, Germany. The diversity in our \npeople\u2019s cultural and educational \nbackgrounds, gender and age is an \nexceptional advantage and a great \nchallenge. In determination to make this \ndiversity one of our key factors, we do \neverything we can to create an \natmosphere where awareness of, and \nrespect for individual differences is \npromoted. \nElectrolux of Sweden, cited earlier, does make \nan explicit link, albeit focused on exploitation of \nthe resource of diversity to improve service \ndelivery. The frequent omission of these terms \nindicates that racial equality in management \nmay be a discourse too far \u2013 the \u201cold guard\u201d may \nbe protecting their power base, presenting a \ngeneral impression that different cultures are \ngood, but avoiding the explicit promotion of \nracial equality. This could be because these \ncompanies want to take a \u201csoftly, softly\u201d \napproach to moving the diversity agenda \n 6\nforward without causing a backlash from the \ndominant white male majority. Alternatively, they \nmay not yet be aware of the benefits of \nmanaging diversity, may not yet have faced up \nto the issue, or do not want to face the issue. \nSuch framing of desirable forms of diversity as \ncultural rather than gender and racial diversity \nmay well reflect the low employment status of \nwomen and those from ethnic minorities, as few \npeople from these minorities reach senior \nmanagement level positions, even in large \ncompanies doing international business. But \nthere is a strong valuing of international \nbackgrounds in the European discourses \nevidenced in these diversity statements. Nokia is \na good example. \nNokia, Finland: Not only is the world our \nmarketplace, it is our talent pool as well. \nTherefore diversity is an important aspect \nof our business for many reasons but \nespecially the following: To succeed in a \ndiversified market place, creativity is a key \nfactor for success. Diverse teams are \nmore creative and find better solutions \nthan homogenous teams. We must mirror \nthe diversity of the marketplace in our \norganisation to ensure that we understand \nour customers\u2019 needs. We must always \nhire the best people we can find. By \ndefinition, this includes people of diverse \nnationalities and cultural backgrounds. \nAlthough Nokia\u2019s statement does not explicitly \nmention ethnicity, the author may have assumed \nthat people would read ethnicity as included. \nThe findings that international and cultural \ndiversity are valued specifically, but not ethnic \nand racial diversity may reflect very forward-\nlooking views, which ignore racial and colour \ndifferences, or may be evidence of other \ndiscourses working to maintain social relations \nbased on the power of majority groups to define \nwhat is to be valued in future. Certainly we see \nan increasing Europeanisation and \ninternationalisation of directors in top UK \ncompanies (Singh, 2004) whereas the \nphenomenon appears to be emergent in other \nEuropean countries such as Sweden or the \nNetherlands (Heijltjes et al., 2003).  \nOther Tools for Promoting Diversity \nDiscourses \nImages of Gender and Ethnic Diversity  \nHowever, it is not only through texts that \ndiversity is promoted. There are other artefacts, \nincluding photographs and symbols. The design \nof the web pages on which diversity is \nmentioned has symbolic significance, as well as \nthe actual scripts. Of the 174 company websites \nthat mentioned diversity or equality or anti-\ndiscrimination policies, a quarter had a single \nphotograph relating to gender and ethnicity, \nusually on the careers or HR\/People pages. A \nfurther 14 companies had two photographs, and \n18 had three or more.  \nThe most popular image was that of a young \nAsian woman (24 sites), followed by 21 sites \nshowing a racially\/sexually diverse group. An \nAsian male was shown on 14 sites, a black male \non 12 sites, and a white female on ten sites. The \nUK, German and Swedish companies had the \nwidest variation in their choice of images for the \ndiversity sites. Figure 1 shows that the image of \nthe black woman was absent from Norwegian, \nFinnish and Swiss company diversity \nstatements\u2019 photographs, whilst European \nwomen were shown on Swedish, Finnish, Swiss \nand UK company sites. One UK company \nportrayed a pregnant young woman, but it was \nnot clear whether she was intended to symbolise \nthe future, good maternity leave conditions or a \nconstruction of women as \u201cmothers\u201d. \n \n \nFigure 1: Photograph types used by companies by country  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nFr\nan\nce\n n=\n10\nHo\nlla\nnd\n n=\n8\nGe\nrm\nan\ny  \nn=\n8\nSw\nitz\nerl\nan\nd n\n=6\nUK\n  n\n=2\n9\n Sw\ned\nen\n n=\n22\nNo\nrw\nay\n n=\n1\nFin\nlan\nd n\n=7\nWh\nole\n sa\nmp\nle \nn=\n91\n%\n o\nf s\nta\nte\nm\nen\nts\n w\nith\n p\nho\nto\ns\nDisabled person\nEuropean women\nPregnant Woman\nDiverse Group\nAsian man\nAsian woman\nBlack man\nBlack woman\n 2\nVisual images revealed new constructions of the \n\u201cdesirable\u201d diverse employee, most often the \nfemale Asian technical expert. It is interesting \nthat many of the Asians were depicted as \nserious technical experts in white coats and \nlaboratory\/hospital workplaces, in contrast to \nsome of the black subjects who were shown in \ninformal clothes with full smiles, including one \ngroup of black workers in boiler suits and \nSwedish company hats. Previous research by \nAnderson and Imperia (1992) shows that male \nexecutives are less likely to be portrayed smiling \nthan male workers, indicating that in such social \nrelations, the smiling was a feature of the \nsubordinate being anxious to please. The wide \nsmiles in some photographs may also be \nindicative of the use of diversity as a device for \nmanaging social relations, with photographs as \nartefacts supporting moral regulation of happy \nco-existence between groups. In some group \nphotographs, a European male is shown \nsurrounded by or leading a group of ethnically \ndiverse young workers, suggesting the \ncontinued domination of the white middle-aged \nmale stereotype leader. The Swedish company, \nSandvik, showed a mixed group of executives \nstanding around a very senior-looking white \nmale and a black male executive. The \nimpression is given that the tall silver-haired \nEuropean male is the dominant person in the \ngroup, and that the black executive is making a \nserious point; perhaps he is the leader of the \nteam behind him. The photograph used by the \nFinnish company, Ahlstrom, presents a group of \nphysically attractive young professionals on a \nbeach playing volleyball. The group has males \nand females, black and white, dressed in \nmodern business clothes with a hint of sexuality \n(the women\u2019s long but split skirts) with everyone \nsymbolically striving for goals, and the black \nmale reaching highest \u2013 perhaps a sporting \nstereotype but nonetheless powerful. \nAnother image was that of a successful mid-\ncareer Asian female entertaining another woman \nin a restaurant business meeting, implying \nseniority, access to financial resources and \nnetworks. Renault showed two young female \nsharp-suited executives, moving up an escalator \nat pace, one blonde, the other Asian, highly \nsymbolic, fresh and modern. HBOS, the UK \nbank portrayed a youngish black female \nexecutive, very confident, very professional \u2013 \nbut such images were more frequently of \nEuropean or Asian women. The images used of \nonly European females suggest that the focus is \non gender diversity, but only for white women, \nagain sustaining the stereotype of whiteness as \nprivileged over non-whiteness. \nWe would expect that close attention would be \ngiven to the selection of appropriate \nphotographs for the diversity pages of the \ncorporate web site. They are visual \nrepresentations of social and power relations \naround gender, ethnicity and other dimensions \nthat the company wishes to promote. However, \nsome of these findings echo those of Benschop \nand Meihuizen (2002), that women and men in \nannual reports were portrayed in ways that \nreinforced gender role stereotypes and \nmaintained traditional power bases. Old gender \nand ethnic stereotypes are sometimes \nsustained, whilst new ones are created in other \ncompanies, particularly the professional Asian \nfemale, the businesswomen conducting \nbusiness in the restaurant, and the confident \nyoung ethnic executives (who are missing from \ncompany websites in some countries).  \nSymbols \nSometimes images were of prizes or symbols of \nawards, such as the best place for mothers at \nwork (eg Pearson). This indicates that not only is \nthe employer open to diversity in terms of \nparental responsibility, but also that it is proud to \nbe associated with such diversity. In other \nwords, there is some normalising of the \nemployee with these diverse characteristics, \nthrough communication to the reader, whether \nmanager, employee or potential recruit, or to \nshareholders and potential investors. Schering \n(Germany) is a good example. The company \nwas awarded the EU Gender Equality at the \nWorkplace Award 2003. In its website, Schering \nemphasises that it has a long history of equality, \nmaintaining a policy unit for women\u2019s affairs, \npromoting dialogue between men and women, \ndiscussing rather than ignoring the issue. \nSeveral other companies mention awards for \ngender diversity on their websites, including \nAviva, Barclays, Deutsche Telekom, HBOS, \nLloyds TSB and Prudential. As well as prizes, \nother symbols were those associated with \nparticular memberships, for example, in the UK, \nOpportunity Now (gender) and Race for \nEquality.  \nDiversity Statistics \nTo enhance the strength of the message about \ntackling inequalities, 21 companies (9%) provide \nstatistics for female staff, and less frequently, \nseven (3%) give figures for ethnic minority staff \nand management. Thirteen companies indicate \nthe proportion of women in the company, two \nshow the proportion of women entrants, twelve \nreveal the percentage of women in \nmanagement, and seven indicate proportions of \nwomen at senior management. At Carrefour, the \nproportion of women employees is 54%, and \n 3\nthey report that in their Thai subsidiary, half of \nsenior managers are female, but interestingly do \nnot reveal statistics for French-based branches. \nAt Marks & Spencer, the overall proportion of \nwomen employees is 81%, but they have the \ndistinction of 62% female senior management, \nand a third of the board is female. There were \nbig variations in reported levels of women in \nmanagement. Nobel Biocare reported that 47% \nof top management was female (including chief \nexecutive and chief finance officer), whilst at \nReed it was 22% and at Sainsbury, 9%, but of \ncourse, definitions of \u2018top management\u2019 would \nbe needed for comparisons to be made.  \nTo underline successful efforts in promoting \nwomen to key positions, some companies \nprovide comparative figures. Hence, Bayer \nshows that women now form 10% of managers \ncompared to 5% ten years ago. Two UK \ncompanies highlight targets for the coming \nyears. In Shell, women represent 7.9% of senior \nexecutives, with a target of 20% by 2008, whilst \nBarclays states that women hold 11% of senior \nexecutive positions, with a target of 22% in \n2006. Another device used by Kingfisher is to \nexplain that the proportions of women employed \nas senior executives\/senior managers, and as \nmiddle managers are part of their performance \nindicators, showing transparency on targets and \nprogress towards gender equality.  \nOnly seven companies gave statistics for ethnic \ndiversity. Ethnic diversity is a sensitive subject, \neven in the UK. Many companies do not gather \nethnicity statistics despite recommendations \nfrom advisory bodies (e.g. the Commission for \nRacial Equality in the UK), and hence would not \neven have the data to be able to reveal \nstatistics. An exception was HBOS, with an \noverall ethnic representation in the UK retail \nbank over 7%, but with over 30% in some towns. \nHBOS actively portrays ethnic diversity in \nphotographs on its website, including black male \nand female executives. Also revealing ethnicity \nin management were two UK high street \nretailers, Marks and Spencer (6%, compared to \n11% overall, and close to the national ethnic \nminority population of 7%) and Sainsbury (9% of \nstore managers, of 12% overall). Companies \nsuch as Shell and BP give statistics for non-UK \nnationals in management but are not specific \nabout ethnicity. \nDiscussion \nClearly some top companies are using the \nnotions of gender and ethnicity in diversity \nstatements as strategic resources (Hardy et al. \n2000). According to Kirby and Harter (2003), \ncompetitive advantage represents a key driver \nfor promoting diversity \u2013 revealed in practitioner-\noriented books, diversity training and \nconsultants\u2019 websites. Our results have shown \nthat some companies have used the weight of \nsupport from top executives to make sure that \nthere is no resistance to the discourse. Others \nhave used common sense arguments that leave \nlittle room for challenge by resisters, such as the \nfact that half of the available talent is located in \nits women employees. Furthermore, it is \nsomewhat surprising that only fifteen (6%) of \n241 companies specifically promoted the gender \ndimension of diversity on-line as part of the \ndiscourse of \u2018diversity for competitive advantage\u2019 \nand that even fewer (4%) included ethnicity. \nGiven that women make up half of the workforce \nin most of these countries, and given the \ndemographic changes fast approaching, more \nexplicit reference to those dimensions could \nhave been expected. It is even more surprising \ngiven that EU member states have had to \nintroduce or tighten anti-discrimination measures \nrecently on grounds of sex and race as well as \nnew protection for religious beliefs, disability, \nage and sexual orientation (EC, 2004). As for \nethnicity, even in those European countries \nwhere traditionally the population was \nhomogenous, there have recently been large \nincreases in immigration. Economists \nemphasise the urgent need for more workers to \ncontribute to meeting increasing demands for \npensions and health benefits in the future. But \nincreased immigration is not a popular cause, \nand ethnic minorities are not usually being \nassociated with increased work performance in \nthe new diversity discourses.  \nThere is another aspect of the valuing diversity \nissue, evidenced by the study of Kochan et al. \n(2003). Whilst gender diversity does appear to \nbring enhanced team performance, ethnic \ndiversity without active and good diversity \nmanagement may lead to poorer performance, \nbecause of increased conflict with the majority \nand withdrawal of involvement by minority \nindividuals. Few companies mentioned the \nchallenge that this presented \u2013 Telenor of \nNorway being an exception \u2013 \u201cdiversity puts new \ndemands on our managers and our employees\u201d. \nIn the very few cases where gender and ethnic \ndiversity are explicitly linked with the \u2018diversity \nfor competitive advantage\u2019 discourse, the \ndiversity statements are socially constructing \nmeanings of gender and ethnicity as objects in \nthe discourse. These notions are portrayed as \nresources to be harnessed for the organisation, \nparticularly in terms of helping it to understand \nand meet its customer needs. In addition, in \nsome web statements, women and ethnic \n 4\nminority groups are identified as valuable \nindividuals, the best of the talent pool, who could \nenable the organisation to learn to do its work \nbetter (the learning perspective mentioned by \nDass and Parker, 1999). In other companies, \neven though women are often identified as being \nin an unequal position, at least diversity \nmanagement is on the agenda, through the \nrevelation of statistics and occasionally targets, \nand there is public commitment to implement \nchange. Legitimacy theory (Suchman, 1995) \nwould explain the use of diversity statistics, \ntargets for minority groups in leadership, prizes \nand memberships of gender and ethnic diversity \nlobby organisations, as companies seek to show \nevidence of their corporate social responsibility. \nThe gender and ethnicity categories sometimes \nintersect when it comes to the visual \npresentation of diversity through photographs, \nwith the new image of the preferred female \nAsian technical expert. We find old stereotypes \nin some group photographs with senior white \nmale managers surrounded by young diverse \nindividuals. Photographs can be very influential - \nas the saying goes, pictures can speak louder \nthan words. The fact that Scandinavian and \nSwiss companies often use photographs of \nEuropean women indicates that for them, \ndiversity is mainly about white women. The \ndiversity as competitive advantage discourse is \nmost strongly used in top UK companies, where \ngender and ethnic diversity are more often \nexplicitly addressed. In contrast, the discourse of \ndiversity used in Germany and France is seldom \nexplicitly related to gender and ethnicity, but to \ncultural and international diversity (Bellard and \nR\u01d6ling, 2001). \nThese findings reflect Kaptein\u2019s (2004) survey of \nmulti-national company employment codes, \nwhich showed that companies are more likely to \nfocus on anti-discrimination codes of practices \nthan valuing diversity. Hence, they are \nproblematising and rationalising gender and \nethnicity rather than naturalising diversity as \ncompetitive advantage. Our results also reveal \nthat often gender, and usually ethnicity are not \nspecified as valuable characteristics for \ncompetitive advantage, echoing comments \nmade by UK FTSE 100 chairmen (Russell \nReynolds, 2002) that in the selection of \ndirectors, gender and ethnicity did not matter a \ndamn, but nationality (meaning international) \nwas good. There is evidence that international \ndiversity and cultural diversity are highly valued \n(at least in these discursive on-line statements \nabout diversity), especially by French and \nGerman companies Where that is coupled with a \npromise of an inclusive culture, this would a \npowerful and welcoming message to those who \nare from minority groups. However, given that \ngender and racial equality have not yet been \nachieved, certainly at board level, and often at \nmiddle management level, then the absence of \nthese characteristics in so much of the discourse \nof diversity and competitive advantage can be \nread in two ways. People with those differences \nare not highly valued; or those various \ndifferences are valued and have been \nincorporated into a new discourse of general \n\u201ccultural diversity\u201d. Are the general statements \nsaying that every individual is not only welcomed \nbut also is seen as bringing significant \nadvantages from that diversity, from which \neveryone including managers should learn, \ngrowing a culturally aware, diverse and \ncompetitive organization? Further evidence is \nneeded to explore this issue. \nConclusions \nThis study extends the work of Kirby and Harter \n(2003) on diversity discourses on diversity \nconsultants\u2019 websites by taking a European \nperspective on the discourse associated with \ndiversity for competitive advantage, across a \nlarge number of important companies, and by its \nfocus on gender and ethnic diversity. This paper \nextends previous work on overall diversity \ndimensions (Point and Singh, 2003) and on \ndiversity management strategies and stages \n(Singh and Point, 2004) in its focus on the \nstrategic use of the discourses of gender and \nethnic diversity for competitive advantage. Only \na small number of top European companies are \nusing diversity discourses specifically in terms of \ngender and ethnicity as strategic resources, \nsending the message that diversity is linked to \ncorporate advantage. In terms of promotion of \nthe discourse of \u2018diversity for competitive \nadvantage\u2019, the UK is way ahead of the rest of \nEurope, as well as in terms of explicit reference \nto gender and ethnicity. Importantly, the UK \ncompanies are demonstrating far more than just \nlip service to diversity, evidenced by the \nrelatively high number of female directors on \ntheir main boards.  \nThis study adds to the debate as to whether \ndiversity management is the best way forward in \nachieving equality of outcomes for diverse \ngroups such as women and those from ethnic \nminorities (Liff, 1999; Lorbiecki and Jack, 2000), \nby identifying what companies say they believe \nabout diversity, equality and competitive \nadvantage, and why they say they believe it, in \nthe new digital medium of the corporate website. \nTheir reasons are to enhance their company \ncompetence, cultural learning, talent \nmanagement and better recruitment, as well as \n 5\nincrease creativity. In addition, gender and \nethnicity are said to bring competitive advantage \nthrough mirroring and understanding the \ncustomer base. Although a few companies still \nframe diversity as a problem or in need of \nprotection as was the case particularly for ethnic \ndiversity, more companies use a rationalisation \ndiscourse, explaining why diversity is an \nimportant issue. The discourses are often set \nexplicitly in a change context, with the issue \nbeing reframed in enactment mode, with new \nsocially responsible policies aiming for a better \nenvironment for everyone. As Liff (1999) \nindicated, companies are still drawing on earlier \nequality and social justice discourses at the \nsame time as promoting the new diversity \ndiscourse. Some companies have come further \nstill, presenting their diversity discourses as the \nnatural and only way forward, strongly \nchampioned by senior executives. For them, \ngender and ethnic diversity relations have been \nembedded within the corporate discourse, new \npower relations have emerged, and the business \ncase has taken over the earlier equal \nopportunities discourse. We found that the \ndiscourse analysis framework (problematisation, \nrationalisation, fixation, reframing and \nnaturalisation) suggested by Vaara et al. (2004) \nto be a useful tool for analysing texts in terms of \nthe ways in which the discourses were framed. \nThe study also adds to work by Benschop and \nMeihuizen (2002) in identifying the use of \nphotographs that in some cases create new \nmodels such as the desirable Asian female \nexpert employee, but in others, serve to \nreinforce existing stereotypes of leaders as \nwhite males. In the process of promoting this \nrhetoric on corporate websites, companies are \nreframing how diverse characteristics are to be \nvalued by their stakeholders, or supporting old \nstereotypes and unequal gender and ethnic \ndiversity power relations in organisations. \nImplications for Practitioners \nThe key point for practitioners is that close \nattention needs to be paid to the design of the \non-line diversity statement, and to its \npresentation, after clarity has been reached \nabout the particular philosophy for managing \ndifference, the rationale, and the goals of the \npolicy. The language associated with diversity is \nextremely important in constructing more \npositive views on what diversity means, why it is \nimportant, what needs to be done, who is to do \nit, and crucially, how much commitment there is \nfrom senior management to drive the change. \nCareful consideration should be given to \nclarifying the ethnicity dimension, because of the \nambiguity of possible euphemisms such as \n\u2018cultural diversity\u2019 or \u2018different backgrounds\u2019 \nwhere readers may make other assumptions \nthan those intended by the company. Ignoring \ndiversity is a message in itself, telling \nstakeholders that diversity is not sufficiently \nvalued to merit mention in the new digital \nmedium. Statement designers should consider \nhow the new discourse of managing diversity \nsits in relation to earlier discourses of equality \nespoused by the company. They should identify \nthe intended stakeholders, as well as the \naudience and the actors. The managing diversity \ndiscourse would be more powerful and more \nlikely to lead to acceptance of the new \nphilosophy as a genuine wish to be more \ninclusive, if the two largest minority \ncharacteristics of gender and ethnicity\/race were \nspecifically mentioned in a positive and forward-\nlooking approach, rather than as a problem \nneeding policing and protection. Only a few \ncompanies are doing this for gender and \nethnicity. The selection of accompanying \nphotographs is critical, if old stereotypes of \nleaders as white males and women as auxiliary \nsupport are to be eliminated. \nLimitations and Suggestions for Further \nResearch \nThis research explored only the presentation \nand discourses of diversity statements on-line, \nbut did not consider evidence of the enacted \ndiversity policies of these companies. We \nsuggest further research where access can be \ngained to some of the companies sampled here, \nto evaluate the struggles and achievements that \nthey have made to develop the next generation \nof leaders from a more diverse pool of talent.  \nOur study is based on voluntary statements of \ncompanies on corporate websites. We excluded \nstatements in annual reports, even where \navailable on-line, as in some countries, there \nwas a legal obligation to disclose human \nresource management policies in annual \nreports. Further research should examine \ndiversity discourses in annual reports, taking into \naccount varying legal requirements for \ndisclosures. We sought permission to use some \ndiversity photographs from the websites but \nsuch images were owned by webpage designers \nand therefore could not be reproduced for this \narticle. \nThere is inevitably bias from our position as \nresearchers, in terms of our skills at negotiating \npaths through complex websites, through our \nworld-views as we analysed the data, through \nour skills as discourse analysts, and in our \npresentation of results. Our own diversity \n(gender, age, nationality, language and \n 6\ninternational backgrounds) was an asset, as we \nhad to challenge our shared and individual \nassumptions and understandings of our data. \nWe also impacted the websites visited, leaving \ntraces of search terms that website managers \nmight examine in their intelligence gathering for \nmarketing purposes. On revisiting websites, we \noften found changes, with some companies \nintroducing or revising diversity statements after \nour data collection date.  \nThis brings us to another key limitation of our \nresearch, that it is only a snapshot view early in \n2003. Websites are frequently updated, and \nhence these disclosures of diversity policies play \nonly a time-limited role in the social construction \nof diversity. Nonetheless, as the web begins to \nplay an increasing part in constructing meanings \nin our lives, it is important that social inequalities \nin the workplace based on gender and race are \nnot reinforced by empty rhetoric on websites. \nCompanies could use this new digital medium \nmore effectively if they were to give increased \nattention to the framing of diversity in their public \nrelations material, aligning it with their corporate \nphilosophy for managing, respecting, valuing \nand utilising difference to the benefit of the \ndiverse individuals as well as the company\u2019s \ncommercial success. \nReferences \nAcker, J. , 2002, \u2018Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A \ntheory of gendered organisations, Gender and \nSociety 4 (2) 139-158. \nAlvesson, M. and D.
