This paper deals in depth with some of the emotions that play a role \nin a group recommender system, which recommends sequences of items to a \ngroup of users. Firstly, it describes algorithms to model and predict the satisfac-\ntion experienced by individuals. Satisfaction is treated as an affective state. In \nparticular, we model the decay of emotion over time and assimilation effects, \nwhere the affective state produced by previous items influences the impact on \nsatisfaction of the next item. We compare the algorithms with each other, and \ninvestigate the effect of parameter values by comparing the algorithms\u2019 predic-\ntions with the results of an earlier empirical study. We discuss the difficulty of \nevaluating affective models, and present an experiment in a learning domain to \nshow how some empirical evaluation can be done. Secondly, this paper pro-\nposes modifications to the algorithms to deal with the effect on an individual\u2019s \nsatisfaction of that of others in the group. In particular, we model emotional \ncontagion and conformity, and consider the impact of different relationship \ntypes. Thirdly, this paper explores the issue of privacy (feeling safe, not acci-\ndentally disclosing private tastes to others in the group) which is related to the \nemotion of embarrassment. It investigates the effect on privacy of different \ngroup aggregation strategies and proposes to add a virtual member to the group \nto further improve privacy. \n \nKey words. Group modelling, affective state, satisfaction, recommender systems, privacy \n1 Introduction \nInspired by Interactive TV, we are interested in recommending sequences of items \n(e.g. news stories, music clips) to groups of users. In (Masthoff, 2004a), we have dis-\ncussed ten group aggregation strategies to combine individual ratings into a single \ngroup rating.  For example, consider the set of individual ratings of items in Table 1, \nranging from 1 (really hate) to 10 (really like). Assuming time to see six items, an Av-\nerage strategy would recommend sequence EFHDJA by averaging over ratings. A \nLeast Misery strategy would recommend sequence FEHJDG, taking the minimum of \nratings. Empirical evaluation showed that the Multiplicative strategy, which multiplies \nratings, was most successful in satisfying all individuals. \n \nThis paper (or a similar version) is not currently under review by a journal or conference, nor will it \nbe submitted to such within the next three months. \n  2 \nTable 1. Example of individual ratings for ten items (A to J) for a group of three \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nAverage 7 6 4.3 7.3 8.7 8.7 5.7 7.7 6.7 7.3 \n \nThis paper investigates how to predict the satisfaction of individuals during a se-\nquence of items. For instance, how satisfied will Adam be at each point during the se-\nquence EFHDJA? A recommender system that adapts to individuals can focus exclu-\nsively on maximizing individual satisfaction and for this it suffices to always \nrecommend the item with the highest rating. So, there is no need to predict satisfac-\ntion accurately. However, if we are interested in keeping a group satisfied, accurate \nprediction of individual satisfaction becomes crucial. To keep the rest of the group \nhappy, an individual might need to be confronted occasionally with items they do not \nlike. An accurate prediction of satisfaction would help to (a) ensure no individual gets \ntoo dissatisfied, by presenting unliked items at appropriate times (e.g. when they are \nin a good mood), (b) evaluate group aggregation strategies under various conditions \nwithout the need for real users, (c) inspire a new optimal group aggregation strategy. \nThis paper extends the modelling of satisfaction in (Masthoff, 2004a) by treating \nsatisfaction as an affective state and incorporating (a) emotional decay and assimila-\ntion and (b) the influence of the group on individual satisfaction. We also explore the \nissue of privacy. \nThe paper is organised as follows.1 Section 2 discusses existing literature on affec-\ntive state. Section 3 proposes three satisfaction functions based on this literature. Sec-\ntion 4 compares the predictions of these functions with the results from an earlier em-\npirical study, and investigates which parameter values are most appropriate. Section 5 \ndiscusses the difficulties of empirically evaluating affective models. Section 6 pre-\nsents an empirical study of our satisfaction functions. Section 7 discusses literature on \nhow the satisfaction of others may influence an individual\u2019s satisfaction (focusing on \nemotional contagion and conformity), and proposes modifications to the satisfaction \nfunctions. Section 8 presents an empirical study into the effect of different relation-\nship types on emotional contagion. Section 9 discusses the privacy issues of group re-\ncommender systems. Section 10 presents an empirical study into the effect on privacy \nof different group aggregation strategies. Finally, Section 11 presents our conclusions.  \n2 Individual Satisfaction \nThe satisfaction functions proposed in (Masthoff, 2004a) were based on the summa-\ntion of satisfaction on preceding items and the impact of a new item. In the simplest \nsatisfaction function, the impact of an item was taken to be its rating. Three factors \nwere found to improve the functions: (1) inclusion of low ratings (noting dissatisfac-\ntion); (2) normalization, which takes into account ratings of not chosen items; and (3) \n                                                          \n1\n An earlier version of Sections 1 to 4 has appeared as (Masthoff, 2005). \n  3 \na quadratic, rather than a linear estimate of impact, which makes the difference be-\ntween ratings of say 9 and 10 more significant than that between 5 and 6.  \nA limitation of these functions is that satisfaction is modeled as increasing with se-\nquence length, and being independent of item order. Nevertheless, several reasons \nwere given that suggest that order may be important (some related to advertising re-\nsearch, others to comments of subjects in experiments like \u201cit is better to end on a \nhigh\u201d). In this paper, we will refine the satisfaction function to take this into account.  \nIt seems reasonable to regard satisfaction as an affective state or mood. Since the \nseventies, psychologists have researched the cognitive effects of mood, finding that it \nsignificantly impacts perception, attention, memory, information processing, and \njudgement (Oatley & Jenkins, 1996). More recently, psychologists and economists \nhave started to research Affective Forecasting: how accurately people can predict \nwhat will make them happy, by how much, and for how long. Many studies have \nfound that while people tend to be good at predicting whether they will be happy or \nunhappy, they are bad at predicting by how much and for how long (Wilson & Gil-\nbert, 2003). Additionally, our own field has evinced a lot of interest into Affective \nComputing (e.g. Picard, 1997): how computers can recognize and respond to users\u2019 \nemotions, and how computers can simulate having emotions and portray these. We \nwill briefly discuss the results out of these areas that seem most relevant to this paper.  \n2.1 Mood impacts judgment \nResearchers have consistently found an impact of mood on evaluative judgement (for \nreviews see Oatley & Jenkins, 1996; Schwarz & Clore, 1996). For instance, Isen et al. \n(1978) found that people in a shopping mall who received a small gift that pleased \nthem, reported in an unrelated survey a few minutes later that their cars and television \nsets were working better than did people who had not received that gift. \nMuch research has been done in the context of persuasion: people in a happy mood \nare easier to persuade than those in a neutral or sad mood (see e.g., Mackie & Worth, \n1989). Mood effects are studied and used in commercial and political advertising \n(e.g., Aylesworth & MacKenzie, 1998; Isbell et al., 2003) with a view to influencing \npeople\u2019s mood to make them judge a subsequent ad more favourably. In particular, a \nviewer\u2019s mood (as induced by watching the preceding program) has a significant ef-\nfect on brand evaluations (Gardner, 1985; Meloy, 2000), with the viewer responding \nmore positively if they were in a more positive mood. The liking of a television pro-\ngram has a similar significant effect (Murry et al., 1992; Schumann & Thorson, \n1990). So, when a recommender system presents a sequence of items, viewing the \nfirst items could induce a mood, which could impact opinions on the next items.  \nFilm clips are often used to elicit emotions in a laboratory setting, and a number of \nthese have been empirically tested and found to consistently induce an emotion \n(Gross & Levenson, 1995;  Rottenberg et al., in press). Researchers comment on the \ndifficulty of finding clips that strongly elicit one emotion rather than a blend of sev-\neral emotions. We will need to differentiate between the emotions elicited by the con-\ntent of a clip, and the satisfaction with having seen it. For instance, one might be re-\nvolted by the content of a news item (e.g. on happenings in Iraq), but still be satisfied \nwith having seen it. For our modelling, we will for now ignore the emotion elicited by \n  4 \nthe content, and concentrate on satisfaction in isolation. However, this issue will need \nto be addressed in future, and it will also complicate evaluation.  \n2.2 Retrospective feelings can differ from feelings experienced \nA series of studies by Kahneman and colleagues (as reported in Wilson & Gilbert, \n2003) found that the actual feelings experienced (e.g., self-reported pain during a \ncolonoscopy) differed from those reported retrospectively. For instance, in one \ncolonoscopy experiment, half the subjects were given a small additional period of \npain after the end of the normal procedure, but surprisingly reported significantly less \npain than the other subjects (Redelmeier et al., 2003). The retrospective reports were \nheavily influenced by the intensity of the emotional experience when it ended and the \npeak intensity of the experience. This is important to take into account when we try to \nmeasure satisfaction in an empirical study (to evaluate our models), and poses ques-\ntions regarding what kind of satisfaction we ought to model (for instance, satisfaction \nat the end of a sequence of items versus at each point during the sequence).  Note that \nwe do not intend to make a recommender system that purposely \u201cleaves the needle in \nlonger\u201d (gives additional small misery) to make the experience feel better while ob-\njectively being worse. However, we could change the order of items in the sequence, \nto take these kinds of effects into account.  \n2.3 Expectation can influence emotion \nPeople\u2019s affective forecasting can change their actual emotional experience (e.g., Wil-\nson & Klaaren, 1992). Several studies have shown that if you expect to like some-\nthing, then you might end up liking it more than if you did not have any expectations. \nFor instance, subjects who were told that jokes were going to be funny, found the \njokes funnier than subjects who had not been told this. This is called assimilation. So, \nif our recommender system has presented several items you liked, than you might ex-\npect to like the next item as well, and therefore your perceived satisfaction with that \nitem might be higher than its actual rating merits. It has been suggested that the oppo-\nsite can also happen (Wilson & Klaaren, 1992): if you expect to like something, you \nmight end up liking it less. This is called contrast. Since, according to Wilson and \nGilbert (2003), hardly any studies support contrast, while several support assimilation, \nwe will focus exclusively on the latter. \n2.4 Emotions wear off over time \nPeople\u2019s emotional reactions become less intense with time, a phenomenon called \nEmotional Evanescence (Wilson et al., 2003). When something has made you happy, \nthis happiness does not last, but wears off. This is explained in (Wilson & Gilbert, \n2003) as needed to save energy and to protect the emotions\u2019 role as a signalling de-\nvice. Another explanation of Emotional Evanescence is given by adaptation-level the-\nory, which claims that an emotional reaction depends on how the current experience \n  5 \ncompares to similar past experiences. The example given in (Wilson & Gilbert, 2003) \nis that of temperature: if you have been used to low temperatures, arriving in Florida \nto a temperature of 15\u00b0 C might please you. After staying for a while, 30\u00b0 C becomes \nyour standard, and a day with the same temperature of 15\u00b0 C might displease you. \nNote that this is subtly different from the idea of contrast. Adaptation level theory \ndoes not assume you will expect the weather to be good, and compare the actual \nweather to your expectation, but rather that you will compare it to your standard of \nwhat constitutes good weather, a standard which has been influenced by your experi-\nences in the past. So, if you were watching a sequence of items, the items you have \nwatched so far would give you a standard to compare the next item to. \nAs noted by Wilson & Gilbert (2003), a limitation of adaptation-level theory is that \nit does not specify what the comparison point should be. Should we only look at the \nlast item or take the average over the last, say five, items? It also does not explain the \ndecrease in emotions over time evoked by a single isolated event. For this paper, it is \nsufficient to note that a decrease of emotions over time happens; we will not try to \nmodel adaptation level theory yet.  \n2.5 Ideas from affective computing \nPicard (1997) discusses the use of emotions and moods in computer systems. She de-\nscribes emotions as being regulated by moods: for instance, a good mood increases \nthe impact of relatively small positive events. She proposes to model mood as a \nweighted summation of the impact of positive events and subtraction of the impact of \nnegative events, with the impact of recent events receiving extra weight. She argues \nthat mood can not be of unbounded intensity, so a limit should be used (or a saturation \nfunction). Elliot & Siegle (1993) also mention that prior mood should contribute to \nemotion intensity. They further mention that the relationship between users can influ-\nence emotions (we will return to this issue in Section 7).  \n3 Satisfaction Functions Chosen \nIn (Masthoff, 2004a), satisfaction with a (fixed-length) sequence of items was calcu-\nlated as the sum of the impact on satisfaction of the individual items of the sequence: \n \n     )Impact(   )Sat(  )Sat( iitemsiitems +=><+ ,    for item i and item sequence2 items.  \n Sat(<>) = 0 \n \nBased on the literature review above, we will henceforth assume that Satisfaction will \ndecrease in intensity over time. Also, we give more weight to recent items3. \n \nVariant 0   1\u03b40with  ),Impact(   )Sat(  )Sat( \u2264\u2264+\u00d7=><+ iitemsiitems \u03b4   \n                                                          \n2\n Whenever we talk about an item sequence, we mean a sequence of distinct items. \n3\n This deviates from the proposal in (Picard, 1997) of a linear decrease in weight, and only con-\nsideration of the last four events.   \n  6 \n \nWith \u03b4=1 no decrease of satisfaction over time occurs, and with \u03b4=0 no memory of \npast items would be used. The value of \u03b4 is likely to depend on personality, as advo-\ncated in (Picard, 1997; de Rosis et al., 2003), and item duration. \nThe impact of an item depends on the individual\u2019s liking of that item, as captured \nby a preference rating4. Rating(i) will denote the preference rating for item i. To cal-\nculate the impact, we perform three steps. \n1. Normalization. In (Masthoff, 2004a), satisfaction produced was normalized, as op-\nposed to individual rating, using for item sequence items: \n \nNormSat(items) = )PossSat(\n)Sat(\nitems\nitems\n \nwith  PossSat(items) = )(SatMax\n)length()length(sequenceitem\ns\nitemsss =\u2227\n    \nOur introduction of \u03b4 into the Satisfaction function means that normalization now \nneeds to be handled differently. We apply normalization to the rating, not to satis-\nfaction as a whole, to make it independent of the selections so far. For rating r, \n Normalized(r) = \ngsPossibleTotalRatin\ngsExpectedTotalRatin\n\u00d7r ,  \nwith TotalRatingsExpected = \u2211\njitem\ningAverageRat   \nTotalRatingsPossible  = \u2211\nj\nj\nitem\n)( Rating  \nRather than taking AverageRating to be the midpoint of the scale (5.5), we use the \naverage rating over all individuals in the group over all items (6.93 in Table 1).  \nNote that normalization results in ratings 10-10-10-10 being treated as the same \nas 5-5-5-5. This was also the case in the normalization in (Masthoff, 2004a). In a \nsense, this is also a form of assimilation.  \n \n2. Rebalancing. We rebalance the rating scale by subtracting its midpoint (5.5 for our \nscale), so that negative ratings imply dissatisfaction. \nRebalanced(r) = r \u2013 midpoint,    for rating r \n \n3. Making the impact quadratic. We will use the following formula5: \n \nQuadratic(r) =   r2,     if r \u2265 0;         - r2,  if r < 0,   for rating r \nCombining these three steps, we obtain: \n \nImpact(i) = Quadratic(Rebalanced(Normalized(Rating(i))) , for item i \n                                                          \n4\n How ratings have been obtained is beyond the scope of this paper, but they are likely to have \nbeen inferred rather than explicitly given (see Masthoff, 2004a). Here we assume ratings to \nbe accurate. \n5\n This deviates from (Masthoff, 2004a), where no rebalancing occurred and Quadratic(r) was  \n(r-5)2, if r \u22656, and -(r-6)2 if r<6. This simplifies dealing with the new normalization of ratings. \n  7 \nThe satisfaction function discussed above sums the (weighted) satisfaction so far \nwith the impact of the new item. The upshot is that satisfaction is predicted to keep \nincreasing if a series of items is consistently pleasing. The question arises whether \nsummation is indeed the right operation, given that some of the literature discussed \nabove says that mood cannot be of unbounded intensity. An alternative would be to \ntake the average. We therefore propose the following variant: \n \nVariant 1   \n\u03b41\n)Impact(   )Sat(\u03b4\n  )Sat(\n+\n+\u00d7\n=><+\niitemsiitems   \n \nWe divide by 1+\u03b4 rather than 2, to get Sat(items+<i>) = Impact(i) when \u03b4=0.  \nAlthough the satisfaction function takes decay of emotion into account, it does not \nyet take into account that mood can alter judgement, and that expectation can influ-\nence emotion. Since the literature suggests that impact of an item depends on mood, \nshowing an assimilation effect, we propose the following variant:  \n \nVariant 2     ))(Sat\u03b4,Impact(  )Sat(  )Sat( itemsiitemsiitems \u00d7+\u00d7=><+ \u03b4   \nwith        \u03b5))Impact(()Impact(),Impact( \u00d7\u2212+= isisi ,       for all s and 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u22641 \n \nThis variant ensures for instance that the impact of an item is higher than it would nor-\nmally be, if the user\u2019s mood (in terms of satisfaction with the sequence so far) is high. Pa-\nrameter \u03b5 models the extent to which the user\u2019s mood influences that user\u2019s evaluative \njudgement: with \u03b5 = 0 there is no such influence (and we have the same satisfaction \nfunction as Variant 0), with \u03b5 = 1 the influence is so immense that the new item cannot \nhave any impact on the user\u2019s mood. \nIt is easy to come up with more variants (e.g. combining Variants 1 and 2), but we \nwould first like to understand the effects of the satisfaction functions proposed so far. \n4 Simulations \nTo gain insight into how the variants differ in their predictions, we ran simulations: \ntaking Table 1\u2019s ratings for John, Adam and Mary, and eight different item sequences \n(e.g. FEAHD), each variant predicted how satisfied each individual would be at each \npoint during each sequence. Varying values of \u03b4 and \u03b5 were used. Figure 1 shows ex-\nample results for Variant 0 (for full results see Masthoff, 2005). As can be expected, a \nlower value of \u03b4 tends to result in a lower predicted satisfaction. Comparison of the \nresults for sequences AIEFD and AEFID shows the impact item order can have, par-\nticularly for small \u03b4. Figure 2 shows example results for Variant 1 (for full results see \nMasthoff, 2005). The \u2018averaging\u2019 used in Variant 1 has resulted in a nice limitation of \nsatisfaction, rather than an infinite increase. The value of \u03b4 clearly has less impact on  \nsatisfaction for Variant 1 than for Variant 0. Figure 3 shows example results for Vari-\nant 2. There is a large impact of \u03b4: with \u03b4=0.9, all individuals are about equally satis-\nfied and the impact of \u03b5 is low. With \u03b4=0.2, the individual satisfaction profiles are \nquite different, and the impact of \u03b5 is high. \n  8 \n \nJohn Adam Mary \nFEHJDI \n \nMulti- \nplicative \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n \nEFHDJA \n \nAverage \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n \n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nAEFID \n \nPlurality \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n \n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nAIEFD \n \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n -30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n \nFig. 1.

Y-axis shows satisfac-\ntion, X-axis time (first item shown, second shown, etc) \nThe same ratings and sequences had been shown to participants of an experiment \npublished in (Masthoff, 2004a), who were asked to predict how satisfied each indi-\nvidual would be with the sequence as a whole6. We compared the predictions of the \nvariants with those by the participants (as given in Masthoff, 2004a) in order to de-\ntermine what values of \u03b4 and \u03b5 best matched the human predictions. As participants \njudged the sequences as a whole, we compared their opinions with the complete satis-\nfaction curves produced by the Variants, rather than just the end point. So, we regard \nVariant 0\u2019s prediction for AEFID to be that it dissatisfies Adam, as he is predicted to \nbe dissatisfied after the presentation of the first and fourth item (for any \u03b4). \nFor low values of \u03b4, Variant 0 predicts sequences FEHJDI and EFHDJA to dissat-\nisfy Adam, and EFHDJB to dissatisfy John. This contradicts the opinion of partici-\npants, who predicted these sequences to satisfy Adam and John. We therefore con-\nclude that a higher value of \u03b4 (0.8, 0.9, 1) is more in accordance with the participants\u2019 \nbehaviour. This is also supported by the predictions of Variant 2: with \u03b4=0.2, Adam is \npredicted to be dissatisfied at the end, independent of \u03b5. As participants predicted \nAdam to be satisfied, again a higher value of \u03b4 seems better. It is harder to see which \nvalue of \u03b5 produces the best match with participants\u2019 behaviour. Participants predicted \nAdam and Mary to be equally satisfied with FEHJDI, and John to be slightly more \nsatisfied. When looking at the end of the sequence, a lower value of \u03b5 seems to match \nparticipants\u2019 opinions slightly better. When looking at the curves as a whole (e.g., av-\neraging satisfaction over the sequence), John would be more dissatisfied than Adam, \nindependent of \u03b5. \nThe eight sequences used are those recommended by various group aggregation \nstrategies (as described in Masthoff, 2004a). We investigated whether the simulation \nresults could provide insight into the suitability of these strategies. Variants 0 and 1 \nboth predict Adam to be dissatisfied with sequences FEAHD, AEFID and AEIBDF, in-\ndependent of the value of \u03b4. Hence, the strategies that recommend these sequences \n(Borda,Plurality and Most Pleasure as described in Masthoff, 2004a) can be excluded. \n                                                          \n6\n Reasons for the indirectness of that experiment are given in (Masthoff, 2004a) and Section 5. \n  10 \nThis is in-line with the conclusion in (Masthoff, 2004a), which was based on partici-\npants\u2019 opinion. Restricting ourselves to higher values of \u03b4, if we take the satisfaction \nof the group to be the minimum of the satisfaction of the individuals, then in Variant 0 \nFEHJDI clearly performs best: for each moment in the sequence, it gives the highest \nsatisfaction (except after the second item for \u03b4 is 0.8 and 0.9). This sequence was rec-\nommended by the Multiplicative strategy, which was also the strategy preferred by \nthe participants. However, if we take the satisfaction of the group to be the average of \nthe satisfaction of the individuals, then the Average strategy performs best. Taking the \nminimum corresponds better to the predictions of our subjects. \nVariant 1 also predicted Adam to be dissatisfied with EFHDJA independent of \u03b4. \nThis contradicts the opinions of participants, who predicted this sequence to satisfy \nAdam. There are three possible explanations. Firstly, the \u2018averaging\u2019 in Variant 1 may \nbe wrong. Secondly, participants\u2019 predictions may be wrong. Thirdly, both the \u2018aver-\naging\u2019 and subjects\u2019 predictions may be correct, but something else in the satisfaction \nfunction is wrong, like the normalization (or the constant used in it), or the use of \nquadratic ratings.  \n5 Inherent Complexity of Empirical Evaluation \nWe have shown how we can use satisfaction functions to reason about group aggrega-\ntion strategies, even when these functions are not yet completely validated. For in-\nstance, several strategies performed badly, independently of \u03b4, and of whether \u2018aver-\naging\u2019 was used. Comparing the satisfaction functions with predictions by subjects, \nallowed us to conclude that \u03b4 should have a high value (for this particular task), and \ngiven such a high value, the Multiplicative strategy performed best. However, there is \na problem: the empirical data used comes from an indirect experiment, where subjects \nwere not shown items, but only ratings, and had to predict satisfaction. As discussed \nabove, the Affective Forecasting literature shows that people are very poor at predict-\ning the intensity of emotions7. So, a next step should be to empirically compare the \nreal satisfaction experienced by subjects with that predicted by the satisfaction func-\ntions. However, this is particularly challenging; indeed it was the topic of an \u201cevalua-\ntion challenge\u201d for the 2005 UM workshop on the Evaluation of Adaptive Systems.  \nFirstly, as pointed out by David Chin\u2019s entry to the competition, items can evoke a \nwide range of emotional responses (Chin, 2005). It may be hard to distil satisfaction \nfrom these. Secondly, accurate ratings for the individuals are needed. We could ask \nsubjects to rate items, but if our assumption is right, then their rating would depend on \npresentation order. Although this could be avoided by introducing long intervals be-\ntween items, this would increase the likelihood that subjects\u2019 moods vary. Attempts to \niron out these issues through items that elicit identical ratings for all subjects failed \n(Masthoff, 2004a). This individual variation in the emotive value of items is also \nnoted by Chin (2005), who points out that a song that instils happiness in the majority \nmay evoke sadness in someone whom it reminds of a deceased friend. A further com-\nplication is that such associations vary over time: the appraisal of a song that reminds \n                                                          \n7\n People are, however, good at predicting valence, so this does not invalidate our conclusions \n  11 \nsomeone of their spouse will depend on the state of the marriage, making it hard to \nask subjects to rate items on one day, and then to do the experiment on a later date.  \nThirdly, items should be unrelated, as topical relatedness can influence judgement \n(e.g. an item about an earthquake in Bulgaria getting a higher rating after an item on \ntheir team playing Bulgaria) (Masthoff, 2004a). In the case of music recommenda-\ntions the tempo and genre of the songs is likely to have such an impact (Chin, 2005).  \nFinally, we need to know how satisfied each subject is after each item has been \npresented. Though self-reporting has been suggested as a convenient and relatively \naccurate way of measuring affective state (de Vicente, 2003), it poses two potential \nproblems. Firstly, if subjects are asked at the end of an experiment to judge their satis-\nfaction at preceding time points, reports are likely to be inaccurate, given the differ-\nence between retrospective and experienced emotions. Secondly, asking subjects to \nreport satisfaction during the experiment takes time and may influence the results \n(given the decrease in emotions over time). Using sensor data has been suggested as a \nmore accurate way to determine affective state as it avoids introspection (for an over-\nview see Picard et al., 2004). However, if we determine satisfaction on the basis of \nsensor data (e.g. heart rate as suggested by Chin, 2005), the emotional content of \nitems can influence results. Also, as indicated by Chin (2005) sensor data seems better \nat spotting the absence or presence of an emotion (e.g, like or dislike) than the actual \nstrength of the emotion, which is most relevant for evaluating our models. Finally, \nsensors tend to be both costly and intrusive. \n6 Experiment 1: Empirical Evaluation on a Learning Task \nAs discussed above, empirical evaluation of our satisfaction functions is inherently \ncomplex. In this section, we nevertheless present a first empirical study8, the purpose \nof which is (a) to yield insight into our satisfaction functions and (b) to explore how \nstudies of this kind can be conducted.  \nTo overcome some of the problems discussed above, the study was conducted in a \nlearning domain, rather than a recommender domain. A learner\u2019s affective state is \nlikely to be multidimensional: Kort et al. (2001) distinguishes between the dimensions of \nanxiety-confidence, boredom-fascination, frustration-euphoria, dispirited-encouraged, \nterror-enchantment. Heylen et al. (2003) adds social emotions, like embarrassment and \npride. We focused on  satisfaction with performance,  using our satisfaction functions to \nmodel learners\u2019 satisfaction with their performance on a sequence of tasks. J\u00e4rvenoja \n& J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (2005) found that performance is an important source of emotion in secon-\ndary school students.  \nFor this experiment, a learning domain was chosen over a recommender domain \nfor a number of reasons. The setup of the experiment required items for which we \ncould accurately predict satisfaction. As discussed above, such items are hard to ob-\ntain in a recommender domain. In contrast, we hypothesised that we could accurately \nmodify task difficulty, and that task difficulty would correlate with satisfaction with \n                                                          \n8\n This experiment happened  before the Evaluation of Adaptive System challenge. \n  12 \nperformance. It also seemed easier in a learning domain to avoid the topical related-\nness problems discussed above, and to keep the tasks free of emotional content. \nWeiner (1995) distinguishes between two affects relating to achievement: \u2018out-\ncome-dependent\u2019 (how well you did) and \u2018attribution-linked\u2019 (was it because of what \nyou did or not). So, it may be that a learner\u2019s satisfaction with their performance de-\npends not only on how well they performed, but also on how difficult they perceived \nthe task to be. If they perceive the task to be very difficult, then they could be satisfied \nwith a lower score than if they perceived the task to be easy. This is not covered in the \nmodels above, and it will be part of the evaluation to see if such an effect does occur.  \n6.1 Adjustment and addition to the models \nBefore performing the experiment, two changes were made to the modelling. First, we \ndefined a learner\u2019s satisfaction with a task t as:  \n Sat(<t>) = Impact(t). \n \nThis is a slight variation on the models given in Section 3, as it results in a different \nvalue of Sat(<t>) for Variants 1 and 2. After all, in Section 3, we had defined Sat(<>) \n= 0  rather than defining  Sat(<t>). This resulted in  \n \nSat(<t>) = Sat(<>+<t>) = \n(\u03b4\u00d7Sat(<>)+Impact(t)) \/ (1+\u03b4) = Impact(t) \/ (1+\u03b4)          for Variant 1 \n= \u03b4\u00d7Sat(<>) + Impact(t,\u03b4\u00d7Sat(<>)) =  \n  Impact(t,0) = Impact(t) + (0-Impact(t))\u00d7\u03b5 = (1-\u03b5)\u00d7Impact(t)    \n \nfor Variant 2 \nThis seems counter intuitive, hence we now define Sat(<t>) instead. Secondly, a vari-\nant of the models was added, which basically combines Variants 1 and 2:  \n \nVariant 3    \n\u03b41\n))(Sat\u03b4,Impact(  )Sat(\u03b4\n  )Sat(\n+\n\u00d7+\u00d7\n=><+\nitemsiitemsiitems   \n6.2 Experimental Design \n6.2.1 Method and Procedure \nFor the purpose of this experiment, it was essential to have a carefully controlled task \nsetting, allowing an accurate a priori estimate of task difficulty. For this reason, a \nlexical decision task (a standard paradigm in psycholinguistic research, see e.g. \nHarley, 2001) was administered, using DMDX, a software package for running reac-\ntion time experiments (Forster & Forster, 2003). In each task, subjects were exposed \nto twenty letter strings flashing for short intervals in succession on a computer screen, \nand asked to decide whether the string was a real English word or not by pressing a \ndesignated \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d key. In each task, ten word and ten non-word strings were \nused in a randomized order. Error rates and reaction times were recorded; however, \nwe will only discuss error data below. Before the start of the experiment, a practice \n  13 \ntask, using numbers instead of words, was administered to familiarise them with the \nsoftware. \nTask difficulty depends on at least two factors. The first is the time window in \nwhich subjects are exposed to a string and have to respond. Our experiment kept this \nconstant across tasks: strings were flashed on screen for 800ms and a response had to \nbe made within 2000ms from the onset of each string. An inter-stimulus interval of \n750ms was also provided, during which the screen was blank. The second factor af-\nfecting task difficulty, and the one manipulated in our experiment, is the familiarity of \nthe words presented. Familiarity of words was systematically varied across tasks, such \nthat one task was \u201ceasy\u201d, one \u201cmedium\u201d and one \u201cdifficult\u201d. \nSubjects were divided into two groups (A and B), differing only in the order in \nwhich the difficult and easy tasks were presented. Both groups did the medium task \n(M) last. Group A subjects saw the other tasks in the order difficult (D) \u2013 easy (E), \nwhile Group B had the opposite order (E \u2013 D). Our satisfaction functions imply that \nthe order of tasks impacts satisfaction. Our between subject design allows us to inves-\ntigate this. Best values for \u03b4 and \u03b5 will be investigated across the sample as a whole. \nIn order to assess their affective state at the start of the experiment, subjects were \nfirst asked to rate their current mood, using a slider going from a sad face to a happy \nface. The slider position returned a value in the interval (1,100). This method makes \nthe \u201cmood\u201d variable continuous (i.e. it is measured on a ratio scale). Thus, it permits \nexplicit comparison of different measures, which is not the case with nominal or ordi-\nnal scales (such as \u201cLikert-type\u201d measurements). The latter are rather coarse-grained \nin that (a) they restrict subjects to predefined measures; (b) the distance between adja-\ncent points on the scale is unknown. \nAfter each of the three tasks, subjects received feedback on the number of correct \nanswers (e.g. \u201cyou answered 15 from 20 correctly\u201d), followed by two questions to as-\nsess their affective state, namely:  \n\u2022 \u201cHow satisfied are you with your performance on the last task?\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cHow satisfied are you with your performance so far?\u201d \nThe questions were answered using the same type of slider as per the initial mood rat-\ning. There was an inter-task interval of 2.5 minutes.  Each task took about 1 minute. \n6.2.2 Subjects \nTwenty-two students of the University of Aberdeen participated in the experiment in \nexchange for entry in a prize draw. Eleven subjects were randomly assigned to each \nexperimental condition. Subjects self-rated their fluency in English, choosing from \n\u201cnative\u201d, \u201cnon-native but fluent\u201d and \u201cnon-fluent\u201d.  \n6.2.3 Materials  \nEach task consisted of 10 words and 10 non-word strings, all of five characters in \nlength and composed of two syllables. For each real word, there was a non-word \nstring with an identical initial character. Non-words were selected from the database \nof the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2002). Real words were selected from \nthe MRC psycholinguistic database, a machine-readable dictionary containing psy-\ncholinguistic norms for English words (Wilson, 1988), including norms for subjective \nfamiliarity ratings obtained from native speakers. The normalised scale for subjective \n  14 \nword familiarity in MRC ranges from 100 to 700. Under the assumption that word \nrecognition would be more difficult for less familiar words, task difficulty was opera-\ntionalised by identifying the following three intervals on this scale: \n\u2022 easy (E): 450- 600; medium (M): 300 \u2013 450; difficult (D): 200 - 300 \nThe frequency of the words selected, obtained from the British National Corpus \n(BNC; Aston & Burnard, 1998), correlated significantly with subjective familiarity. In \nfact, the log-transformed frequency and the subjective familiarity ratings of the se-\nlected words presented a near-perfect correlation ( r = .946; p < .01 ). \n6.2.5 Research Questions \nThe aim of the experiment was to answer the following research questions:  \n\u2022 Is it possible to reliably manipulate satisfaction with individual tasks by manipulat-\ning task difficulty? In particular, we need to establish  \n\u2212 whether task difficulty can be reliably manipulated, that is, whether D is more \ndifficult than E, and M of intermediate difficulty  \n\u2212 that a higher score results in higher satisfaction, and that task difficulty does not \ninfluence subjects\u2019 satisfaction with their score (to exclude the \u2018attribution-\nlinked\u2019 sense of achievement discussed above). Are subjects indeed more satis-\nfied with their (higher) score on E than their (lower) score on D?  \n\u2022 Which variants of the satisfaction function perform best? Emotion wearing off pre-\ndicts that having the easier task first would result in lower satisfaction after two \ntasks (given that satisfaction with task 1 will have decayed). Assimilation predicts \nthat having the easier task first would result in higher satisfaction after two tasks, \nas satisfaction with good performance on the first task would increase expectations \nof good performance on the second, resulting in higher satisfaction overall. Vari-\nants 0 and 1 do not model assimilation, so if they are correct then we should find \nthat group A (who had the easier task last) is more satisfied after two tasks than \ngroup B. Variants 2 and 3 model emotions wearing off as well as assimilation, so \nthey may be true regardless of whether we find a difference or not.  \n\u2022 What values for \u03b4 and \u03b5 produce the best fit? Do we indeed need values per user? \n6.3 Results and discussion \n6.3.1 Task difficulty \nTable 2 shows the average performance over all subjects on tasks D, E, and M. In this \nsection, we report p-values on pairwise t-tests unless otherwise stated. The manipula-\ntion of task difficulty proved reliable, with D more difficult than E (p<.00001), and M \nat an intermediate level significantly below D (p<.00001) and above E (p<.05). Inde-\npendent samples t-tests confirmed that Group A and B differed reliably on their first \n(p<.005) and second (p<.005) tasks. \nTable 2. Correct responses over all subjects. \n Task D Task E Task M \nAverage  12.2 17.1 16 \nStandard Deviation 2.8 2.6 2.7 \n  15 \n6.3.2 Comparability of groups: performance and initial mood \nTo ensure that the groups were homogeneous, we compared initial mood and task per-\nformance. Table 3 shows the correct responses per group. No significant differences \nwere observed between groups on D (p>.7), E (p>.1), M (p>.1), and all tasks com-\nbined (p>.3). Thus, group performance was homogeneous and independent of task order. \nTable 4 shows the self-reported initial mood of subjects in both groups. Slider re-\nsults were transformed by deducting the midpoint of the scale (50), dividing by ten \n(obtaining a scale from -5 to 5), and squaring while maintaining the sign (obtaining \nresults between -25 and 25). All other slider results will be transformed in the same \nway. One subject in group B was an outlier in the initial mood rating (-19.22) and was \nexcluded from all subsequent analyses regarding satisfaction. No difference was \nfound between the groups\u2019 initial mood (t-test, p>.7), suggesting homogeneity.  \nTable 3.

Self-reported satisfaction of subjects with individual task performance.  \nAll subjects Group A Group B  \nAverage STDEV Average STDEV Average STDEV \nTask D -3.14 4.86 -3.40 4.55 -2.86 5.40 \nTask E 8.66 9.97 7.50 10.21 9.94 10.09 \nTask M 5.63 7.24 6.38 8.44 4.81 5.98 \nOver all tasks 11.15 16.33 10.48 18.42 11.90 14.64 \n \nSatisfaction with performance on E and M was significantly greater than for D \n(p<.0001), but no significant difference was found between satisfaction for E and M \n(p>.06), despite a significant (but small) difference in their performance between those \n  16 \ntwo tasks. The trend is however in the right direction, suggesting that task difficulty can \nindeed predict individual satisfaction, in that increased difficulty results in lower individ-\nual satisfaction. There were no significant differences between groups on satisfaction \nratings for individual tasks or in the overall satisfaction ratings (p>.5 for all compari-\nsons).  \n6.3.4 Satisfaction with overall performance \nFigure 4 shows subjects\u2019 satisfaction with overall performance. We focus on subjects\u2019 \nsatisfaction after the second and third tasks, as both groups have had the same two (or \nthree) tasks by then. Variants 0 and 1 of the satisfaction function would predict that \nGroup B subjects, who had the easy task first, would have lower overall satisfaction \nafter the second task (as a consequence of emotions wearing off). However, the trend \nin the graph is in the opposite direction, though the difference is not significant (p>.2). \nThis may be due to assimilation, as modelled in Variants 2 and 3. Another feature of \nFigure 4 is the apparently steeper slope in change of satisfaction for Group B after the \nfirst task, compared to that for Group A. This difference also failed to reach signifi-\ncance (p>.2).  \n \nOverall satisfaction after  Average STDEV \nGroup A -3.40 4.55 First task  \nGroup B 9.94 10.09 \nGroup A 1.12 5.08 First  \ntwo tasks  Group B 2.87 4.29 \nGroup A 2.53 4.82 All three \ntasks  Group B 3.36 5.47 \n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n1 2 3\nGroup A\nGroup B\n \nFig. 4. Satisfaction of subjects with overall performance after each task. \nComparing subjects\u2019 satisfaction with their performance on the third task on its \nown (Table 5) to the increase in their overall satisfaction due to the third task, it is \nclear that the increase is a lot smaller than it would have been if a simple addition was \ntaking place. Similarly, for group B, the decrease in overall satisfaction due to the \nsecond task is a lot larger than subjects\u2019 dissatisfaction with their performance on this \ntask9. The most obvious explanation of both these observations is that rather than \nsummation, some kind of averaging is taking place, suggesting that Variants 1 and 3 \nare to be preferred to Variants 0 and 2. Combined with our earlier observation that the \n                                                          \n9\n In contrast to the first case, this can not have been caused by emotions wearing off over time. \n  17 \nresults conflict with the predictions of Variants 0 and 1, and favour the assimilation \nmodelled in Variants 2 and 3, this may mean that Variant 3 models satisfaction best. \n6.3.5 Comparison with Variants 1 and 3 and parameter values \nTo analyse this further, we investigated how well Variants 1 and 3 (the two variants \nthat used a form of averaging) can fit the data, for varying values of \u03b4 and \u03b5.  \nFirst, we investigated the value of \u03b4 that yields the optimal fit of Variant 1 to the \nexperimental data. As we suspect \u03b4 to be different per subject, we compared predicted \nand actual satisfaction for each subject for varying values of \u03b4. Since after one task \nthe predicted satisfaction equals per definition the reported satisfaction, we made \ncomparisons after two and three tasks, calculating the error rate as the sum of squares: \nErrorRate =  (PredictedSat(<T1T2>) - ReportedSat(<T1T2>))2 +  \n  (PredictedSat(<T1T2T3>) - ReportedSat(<T1T2T3>))2 \nWe considered calculating predicted satisfactions based on subjects\u2019 reported satis-\nfaction with each individual task only. According to Variant 1, with Sat being the sat-\nisfaction predicted by the model: \n\u03b41\n)(Impact)Impact(\u03b4\n\u03b41\n)(Impact)Sat(\u03b4)Sat( 212121\n+\n+\u00d7\n=\n+\n+><\u00d7\n=><\nTTTTTT  \n\u03b41\n)(Impact)Sat(\u03b4)Sat( 321321\n+\n+><\u00d7\n=><\nTTTTTT  \nAssuming Impact(T) = ReportedSat(<T>) for all tasks T, this will allow us to calcu-\nlate Sat(<T1T2>) and subsequently Sat(<T1T2T3>).  \nA problem is that Sat(<T1T2 T3>) and Sat(<T1T2>) are not independent, the former \nis calculated using the latter. So, any errors in the modelling early on will be propa-\ngated. Therefore, we have used an alternative method. To calculate Sat(<T1T2 T3>), \nwe use ReportedSat(<T1T2>) instead of Sat(<T1T2>). Similarly, to calculate \nSat(<T1T2>), we use ReportedSat(<T1>)10. This means that we are focusing on the ex-\ntent to which the models correctly predict changes in satisfaction. So, we calculate \npredicted satisfaction as: \n\u03b41\n)t(ReportedSa)t(ReportedSa\u03b4)at(PredictedS 2121\n+\n><+><\u00d7\n=><\nTTTT   \n\u03b41\n)t(ReportedSa)t(ReportedSa\u03b4)at(PredictedS 321321\n+\n><+><\u00d7\n=><\nTTTTTT  \nFigure 5 shows the error rate for subjects in both groups for varying values of \u03b4. \nVariant 1 seems very bad at predicting the satisfaction of some subjects. For those \nsubjects a higher value of \u03b4 produces a lower error rate, with \u03b4=1 producing the best \nresults for eleven subjects (six in group A, five in group B). What may not be clearly \nvisible in the graphs is that for eight subjects (four in each group), \u03b4 of 0.4 or below \nproduces the best results, confirming the suspicion that \u03b4 is user dependent.  \n                                                          \n10Though this does not make any difference, as PredictedSat(<T1>)=ReportedSat(<T1>). \n  18 \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n \nFig. 5. Error rate as a function of \u03b4, for \u03b4 between 0 and 1. Each line represents a subject. \nGraph on the left shows subjects in group A, graph on the right shows subjects in group B. \nTo bring the error rate down further for many subjects a value of \u03b4 greater than 1 \nwould be required. However, this conflicts with the idea that \u03b4 models the wearing off \nof emotions over time. Hence, Variant 1 seems implausible. Once again, the suspicion \narises that we are seeing an assimilation effect. We will investigate this below, by see-\ning whether \u03b5 in Variant 3 can substantially improve the fit.  \nNext, we will investigate which values of \u03b4 and \u03b5 produce the best fit of Variant 3 \nto the experimental data, using the same procedure as for Variant 1. Using the for-\nmula from Variant 3, we calculate predicted satisfaction as: \n \n=>< )at(PredictedS 21TT\n \n\u03b41\n\u03b5))(tReportedSaMood()t(ReportedSaMood 22\n+\n\u00d7><\u2212+><+ TT\n  \nwith  )(tReportedSa\u03b4Mood 1 ><\u00d7= T  \n=>< )at(PredictedS 321 TTT\n \n\u03b41\n\u03b5))(tReportedSaMood()t(ReportedSaMood 33\n+\n\u00d7><\u2212+><+ TT\n  \nwith  )(tReportedSa\u03b4Mood 21 ><\u00d7= TT  \n \nTable 6 shows the values of \u03b4 and \u03b5 that produce the best fit of Variant 3 to the \ndata, and the error rate for those values. There are still some subjects with a rather \nhigh error rate, but overall Variant 3 has improved the error rate substantially. For in-\nstance, compare the error rate of subject A10 from Variant 1 (138.46) with that from \nVariant 3 (0.14). The assimilation parameter \u03b5 seems to be useful. So, overall Variant \n3 is best. The results also confirm our suspicion that both \u03b4 and \u03b5 are user dependant.  \n  19 \nTable 6.

In a follow-up \nexperiment, we will use longer task sequences, for instance with six tasks, determine \nvalues of \u03b4 and \u03b5 based on the first three tasks, and then investigate how well Variant \n3 fits the data of the last three tasks. The best value of \u03b4 may well depend on the time \nduration of the tasks: if tasks are longer, emotions could wear off more. Since this ex-\nperiment had a short duration, lasting approximately 15 minutes in total, we need to \ninvestigate the effect of longer task durations. We note, however, that whilst the lim-\nited task duration may have reduced emotional decay, we found \u03b4<1 in Variant 3 to \nprovide the best fit to the experimental data for most subjects, suggesting that emo-\ntional decay did occur. The inter-task interval will also have contributed to this. \nMoreover, this work is inspired by interactive TV, and the length of news items and \nmusic clips is rather limited as well, so, it is interesting for us to investigate how good \nour satisfaction functions perform under those conditions.    \n7 Group influences on satisfaction \nUntil now, we have assumed that an individual\u2019s satisfaction only depends upon the \nexperiences of that individual (their liking of items and the item order). It is, however, \nlikely that the feelings of others in the group may influence an individual\u2019s satisfac-\ntion. Research in organizational behavior and social psychology has highlighted the \nroles of emotional contagion, the influence of an individual\u2019s affective state on that of \nothers in the group (Barsade, 2002; Hatfield et al., 1994), as well as conformity, \nwhereby judgments are influenced by those of others. This potentially impacts satis-\nfaction, an issue we turn to below.  \n  20 \n7.1. Emotional Contagion \nEffects of emotional contagion have been found in both field and laboratory studies. \nTotterdell et al. (1998) and Bartel and Saavedra (2000) found evidence of mood con-\nvergence within groups, and Barsade (2002) showed that emotional contagion hap-\npens for negative as well as positive emotions.  \nEmotional contagion does not affect everyone to the same degree (Doherty, 1997; \nLaird et al., 1994). Doherty proposed and validated a 15-item scale for measuring this \nsusceptibility. Emotional contagion seems also to depend on the attention that is being \npaid to others (Hatfield et al., 1994), and non-verbal cues seem particularly important \nin \u201ccatching\u201d others\u2019 emotions (Mehrabian, 1972). This may mean that emotional \ncontagion is more likely to happen in a music recommendation system, than a TV \nnews recommendation system, as people may be more aware of others in the group \nwhen their eyes are not fixed on a television screen.  \nMost evidence on emotional contagion points to its being a sub-conscious, auto-\nmatic process (e.g. Hatfield et al., 1994). In addition, there is some evidence (as re-\nported in Barsade, 2002) that comparison of one\u2019s emotions to those of others may \nmotivate conscious emotion adaptation, changing the real emotion felt rather than just \nthe display of it.  \nIt is rather difficult to model emotional contagion, as the satisfactions of users are \ninterdependent: the satisfaction of a user and the group she is in will be mutually rein-\nforcing. For simplification, we will assume that contagion happens simultaneously, \nand that the satisfaction of each user is only influenced by the \u201cindependent\u201d satisfac-\ntion of the other users, i.e. their satisfaction before contagion happened. So, we define \nthe satisfaction of an individual user u with a sequence items in the context of a group \ng as the independent satisfaction of that user ( Sat(u, items)11 ) summed with the con-\ntagion from other users\u2019 independent satisfaction:  \n \nSat(u, items, g) = Sat(u, items) + \u2211\n\u2208g\nitemsvitemsu\n v\n )) ,Sat( ), ,Sat(Contagion(  \n \nThere seem to be two obvious ways of modelling the contagion of the satisfaction \nof a user u\n \nby the satisfaction of a user v. Either we assume that the contagion only \ndepends on the other person\u2019s satisfaction, and define: \n \nContagion(Sat(u, items), Sat(v, items)) = \u03b6 * Sat(v, items) \n \nOr we assume that it depends on a comparison between an individual\u2019s satisfaction \nand another user\u2019s, defining:  \n \nContagion(Sat(u, items), Sat(v, items)) =  \u03b6 * (Sat(v, items) - Sat(u, items)) \n \n                                                          \n11\n We will use Sat(u, items), though we only defined Sat(items) before. This enables us to dis-\ntinguish between multiple users\u2019 satisfaction, and to have parameters (like \u03b4 and \u03b5) dependent \non the user.   \n  21 \nThe value of \u03b6 depends on the susceptibility of the user to emotional contagion. Until \nnow, we have assumed the user will \u201ccatch\u201d the other users\u2019 emotions, becoming hap-\npier if the group is happier, and sadder if they are sadder. This would mean \u03b6 \u2265 0. \nHowever, resentment and gloating (e.g., Ortony et al., 1988) may play a role, in which \ncase \u03b6 could be negative (for instance, a child may feel devastated when its siblings \nget a larger piece of cake)12. The true nature and extent of contagion is in any case \nlikely to depend on the relationship of an individual and her cohorts.  \n7.2 Types of relationships \nAnthropologists and social psychologists have found substantial evidence for the exis-\ntence of four basic types of social relationships: communal sharing, authority ranking, \nequality matching, and market pricing (Fiske, 1992; Haslam, 1994). In communal \nsharing relationships, all group members share in the group\u2019s resources as needed and \ndepend on one another for mutual support. Authority ranking relationships are asym-\nmetric: one person has precedence over the other (e.g., because they are your boss, \nparent, older, or somebody you respect). In equality matching relationships, everyone \ngets the same, takes turns, independent of needs or status. In market pricing relation-\nships a kind of bartering takes place, and tradeoffs are made (for instance, you can \nwatch television, if you have done the washing-up first). The question is how these \nkinds of relationships might impact the influence others\u2019 emotions have on your own.  \nIn a communal sharing relationship, you are likely to feel empathy with others. \nThis empathy would mean that others\u2019 satisfaction affects your own satisfaction posi-\ntively, and others\u2019 dissatisfaction affects it negatively. Therefore, for communal shar-\ning relationships, a positive value of \u03b6 seems most likely.  \nIn an authority ranking relationship, you are likely to be influenced a lot by the \npeople above you due to respect (or fear). However, depending on personality, it may \nalso be possible to feel pity for the people below you. Therefore, for authority ranking \nrelationships, a higher positive value of \u03b6 seems likely for users ranking above you, \nand a low or close to zero positive value of \u03b6 for users ranking below you. \nIn a market pricing relationship, you are likely to mainly care about yourself, \nwhether you are getting a \u201cgood deal\u201d. This could either lead to indifference regard-\ning others (as you only care about yourself) or to jealousy (as you compare the deal \nyou got to the deal others got). If somebody else seems happier, you might feel that \nthey got a better deal and feel resentment, reducing your satisfaction. Similarly, if \nsomebody else seems less happy, your satisfaction may go up. Therefore, for market \npricing relationships, a value of \u03b6 close to zero (to model indifference) or a negative \nvalue (to model jealousy) seems most likely13. \nIn an equality matching relationship, you are unlikely to have strong views on the \nother person. Emotional contagion could occur as it happens with strangers. There-\nfore, a low positive value of \u03b6 seems most likely.  \n                                                          \n12\n Contagion may not be the best term for negative \u03b6, but we kept this for the sake of simplicity. \n13\n Above we have modeled the contagion of an individual by a group as the summation of the \ncontagion by others in the group. For market pricing relationships, an alternative way of \nmodeling would be to count the number of others that \u201cbeat\u201d us.  \n  22 \nGiven that we believe \u03b6 to depend on both the susceptibility of the user and their \nrelationship with each other user, we will replace \u03b6 in the models above with \u03b6uv. To \ndistinguish between the two factors that influence the value of \u03b6uv , we define: \n\u03b6uv = \u03c3u \u00d7 \u03c1uv,  \nwhere  \n\u2022 \u03c3u (0\u2264\u03c3u\u22641) models the susceptibility of the user to emotional contagion, inde-\npendent of the other user involved, and  \n\u2022 \u03c1Relation(u,v) (-1\u2264 \u03c1Relation(u,v) \u22641) models the contribution to contagion of the rela-\ntionship between users u and v.  \nIn an ideal world, four values of \u03c1 would suffice for all users, one for each type of re-\nlationship. A complication, however, is that relationships are not often clear-cut; they \ncan have elements of multiple types in them and can change per day. \n7.3 Conformity \nMany experiments have provided evidence that humans adjust their opinions to con-\nform with those of a group when the majority or all of the group expresses a different \nopinion than the individual originally had. For instance, Asch (1951, 1956) showed \nthat subjects confronted with a very easy judgment task (the control group had only \n0.7% errors) were influenced by the \u2018obviously\u2019 incorrect judgments of other (fake) \nsubjects, producing 37% errors. There have been many studies showing that adding \nmore members to the majority does not lead to a linear increase in conformity. While \nAsch (1951) found that a majority of three (i.e. one individual with three others who \nall disagreed) gave maximal conformity, later studies have shown that adding more \nmembers to the majority increases conformity, but with diminishing increments per \nadded member (Latan\u00e9 & Wolf, 1981). Latan\u00e9 & Wolf proposed to model this effect \nas a power function: \n  \nInfluence(g) = \u00b5 \u00d7 |g|\u03bb   0 \u2264 \u03bb < 1 \n \nwith  \u00b5 a scaling constant that reflects the influence of a single person, and |g| the \nnumber of people in group g.  \nA series of studies have found that having a social supporter, somebody whose \njudgment matches your own, decreases conformity substantially (Allan, 1975). It has \ntherefore been proposed to divide the influence of the group by the number of indi-\nviduals being influenced (Latan\u00e9 & Wolf, 1981).  \nTwo main reasons have been given for conformity (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). The \nfirst is informational influence: individuals may conform because they trust other \npeople\u2019s judgment more than their own. The second is normative influence: individu-\nals may conform because of group pressure, wanting others to like them. Informa-\ntional influence may cause individuals to change both their public and private opin-\nions. Normative influence is more likely to change only the individuals\u2019 public \nopinions, keeping their private opinions the same.  \nWhen predicting satisfaction, we are mainly interested in individuals\u2019 real satisfac-\ntion, so using their private judgments. Therefore, informational influence is the one \n  23 \nthat is most likely to affect our predictions. Above, we defined the impact on user u\u2019s \nsatisfaction of a new item i given this user\u2019s pre-existing satisfaction s  as: \n \nImpact(u, i, s) = Impact(u, i) + (s-Impact(u, i)) \u00d7 \u03b5,         for 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u22641 \n \nTo make impact reflect the informational influence of a group g, we define:  \n \nImpact(u, i, s, g) = Impact(u, i, s) + InformationalInfluence(u, g, i)14 \n \nTo calculate the informational influence, we will use Latan\u00e9 & Wolf\u2019s (1981) pro-\nposal. Since group g may be composed of multiple subgroups with different opinions,  \nthe informational influence of all subgroups is summed. The informational influence \nof a particular subgroup is a function of (1) its influence factor (as defined by Latan\u00e9 \n& Wolf), multiplied by (2) the difference in opinion of the subgroup and the user, and \ndivided by (3) the number of people in the group outside the subgroup. This last ac-\ncounts for the social supporter effect proposed by Latan\u00e9 & Wolf. Hence, we define \nthe informational influence on a user u of a group of others g  for item i as: \n \nInformationalInfluence(u, g, i) =  \n   \u2211\n\u2227\u2286 \u2212\n\u2212\u00d7\u00d7\n),,(Faction\n\u03bb\n ,\n)),(Impact),(Impact(\u00b5\nigsggsg\nsgu\nsgg\niuisgsg\n \nwith Impact(sg, i) = Impact(v, i) for v \u2208 sg, and \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2260\u2200\u2227=\u2200\u2203\u2261\n\u2208\u2208\n),Impact(  ),Impact(),,Faction(\nsg-gv\nivopinionivopinionigsg\nsgvopinion\n  \nInformational influence is likely to depend on the personality of the individual, for in-\nstance, their level of susceptibility to others\u2019 opinions (Asch, 1951; 1956). Mausner \n(1954) also found self-confidence and perceived competence relative to others to have \nan impact on informational influence in a judgment task. Thus, a would-be expert on \nclassical music is less likely to be influenced on classical music items than somebody \nwho sees himself as a novice. This is why we have made \u00b5u sg dependent on u. Infor-\nmational influence is also likely to depend on the relationship between an individual \nand their group, particularly on how much the others\u2019 opinion is trusted. This is why \nwe have made \u00b5u sg dependent on sg as well.   \nAlthough we have suggested that normative influences may not change individu-\nals\u2019 private judgments, fake emotions expressed due to normative influences could \nexert contagion on the group. So, others may feel better because they wrongly believe \nthat somebody else is happy. Above, we defined \nSat(u, items, g) = Sat(u, items) + \u2211\n\u2208gv\nitemsvitemsu )) ,Sat( ), ,Sat(Contagion(  \n  \n                                                          \n14\n We are assuming that subjects can somehow deduct other people\u2019s judgments from their re-\nactions, separated from the mood they are in (so independent of s).  This is a simplification, \nas the formulas become too complex if we have to take s into consideration as well.  \n  24 \nTo deal with normative influences, we change this to: \n \nSat(u, items, g) = Sat(u, items) +            \n \u2211\n\u2208\n\u222a\ngv\nitemsvugvitemsu )) },{ - }){ ( ,at(PortrayedS ), ,Sat(Contagion(  \n \nAs in the case of emotional contagion, it is rather difficult to model portrayed satisfac-\ntion, as the portrayed satisfactions of users are interdependent. For simplification, we \nwill assume that the normative influence happens simultaneously, and that the por-\ntrayed satisfaction of each user is only influenced by the real satisfaction of the other \nusers, i.e. their satisfaction before normative influence happened. We define the por-\ntrayed satisfaction of a user u with sequence items given a group of others g as \n \nPortrayedSat(u, g, items) = Sat(u, items) + NormativeInfluence(u, g, items) \n \nwith (similar to the definition of InformationalInfluence above): \n \nNormativeInfluence(u, g, items) =  \n  \u2211\n\u2227\u2286 \u2212\n\u2212\u00d7\u00d7\n),,(Faction\n\u03ba\n ,\n)),(),(Sat(\u03b8\nitemsgsggsg\nsgu\nsgg\nitemsuSatitemssgsg\n \nwith \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2260\u2200\u2227=\u2200\u2203\u2261\n\u2208\u2208\n),(S  ),(S),,Faction(\nsg-gv\nitemsvatopinionitemsvatopinionitemsgsg\nsgvopinion\nand  Sat(sg, i) = Sat(v, i) for v \u2208 sg.  \n8 Experiment 2: Emotional Contagion \nThe goal of this experiment is to shed some light on how emotional contagion might \ninfluence the emotions of individuals in a group, and what effect the type of relation-\nship might have.  \n8.1 Experimental Design \n8.1.1 Method \nThe experiment consisted of a number of fictional situations. In each one, subjects \nwere asked to imagine that they would be watching television with someone, and that \nthey liked the program a little. Two within-subjects variables were manipulated: (1) \nthe emotions of the other person, which were either happier or unhappier; (2) the type \nof relationship the subject had with their imaginary partner, one of (a) Authority \nRanking, with the other person higher in rank, (b) Communal Sharing, (c) Market \nPricing and (d) Equality Matching. The combination yielded eight fictional situations, \nin each of which subjects were asked to rate how the other person\u2019s emotion would \n  25 \ninfluence their own. Before the tasks, subjects\u2019 susceptibility to emotional contagion \nwas measured. \nThe reasons why a scenario of watching TV was selected were twofold: (a) the \nmeasure of satisfaction should be independent of abilities (so that e.g. real world \nknowledge about their partner\u2019s relative intelligence would not interfere), (b) the \ncauses of satisfaction should not be transferable, that is, subjects should not be able to \nprofit from another person\u2019s gain (as they would in a lottery). Since it seems awkward \nto express level of satisfaction with TV programs using numbers, vague descriptions \nsuch as \u201cyou enjoy it a little\u201d were used. \n8.1.2 Subjects \nTwenty-four undergraduate students of the University of Aberdeen participated vol-\nuntarily in the experiment, which took place in a classroom setting. Subjects were \npredominantly male (2 female, 18 male, 4 did not disclose their gender).  \n8.1.3 Materials \nWe used an adaptation of Doherty\u2019s (1997) validated scale for measuring the sub-\njects\u2019 susceptibility to emotional contagion. This scale consists of 15 items (three \nquestions each related to the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, happiness and love). \nThis was modified to exclude all items related to love, which were deemed unaccept-\nable in a classroom setting. Each item had five answer categories (\u201cnever\u201d, \u201crarely\u201d, \n\u201cusually\u201d, \u201coften\u201d, \u201calways\u201d).  \nTo measure subjects\u2019 believed emotional contagion, we asked eight questions of \nthe form:  \n \n\u201cThink of somebody [who meets some criterion]. Assume you and this person are \nwatching television together. You are enjoying the program a little. How would it \nmake you feel to know that the other person is [other\u2019s emotion]?  \nMy enjoyment would\u201d \n \nEach question had five answer categories (\u201cdecrease a lot\u201d, \u201cdecrease slightly\u201d, \n\u201cremaining the same\u201d, \u201cincrease slightly\u201d, and \u201cincrease a lot\u201d). Negative and positive \nemotional contagion was simulated by stating that the other person was \u201cenjoying it \ngreatly\u201d or \u201creally hating it\u201d. The different relationships were distinguished using the \nfollowing criteria: \n \n\u2022 Authority Ranking: \u201cyou respect highly (maybe your grandfather, your boss, ..)\u201d  \n\u2022 Communal Sharing: \u201cyou share everything with (maybe your best friend)\u201d  \n\u2022 Market Pricing: \u201cyou do deals with (like, if you do the cooking, I will do the wash-\ning up)\u201d  \n\u2022 Equality Matching: \u201cyou are on equal footing with, you tend to get the same treat-\nment (maybe a cousin or a class mate)\u201d \n \nThe questionnaire used is shown in Appendix 1.  \n  26 \n8.1.4 Research questions \nThe aim of the experiment is to answer the following research questions: \n\u2022 Do subjects predict emotional contagion to happen when two people are watching \ntelevision together? And if so, is there a difference between positive and negative \nemotional contagion, or do both happen to the same extent? \n\u2022 Does emotional contagion differ depending upon the relationship type? In particu-\nlar, do Authority Ranking and Communal Sharing relationships indeed lead to \nmore emotional contagion than Equality Matching and Market Pricing relation-\nships? \n\u2022 Does a Market Pricing relationship lead to a small or to an inverse emotional con-\ntagion? So, if the other person\u2019s enjoyment is higher than yours, does yours stay \nabout the same or decrease further (and similarly, if the other person\u2019s enjoyment \nis lower than yours, does yours stay the same or increase further)? \n\u2022 Does emotional contagion differ depending upon the susceptibility to emotional \ncontagion, and is there an interaction with relationship type? \n8.2 Results and discussion \nOne subject was omitted as they failed to complete the experiment, leaving 23. \n8.2.1 Susceptibility to emotional contagion  \nWe transformed the scale into numbers, using \u201cnever\u201d=0, \u201crarely\u201d=1, \u201cusually=2\u201d, \n\u201coften\u201d=3 and \u201calways\u201d=4. Analysis was carried out by averaging over these num-\nbers. Despite its not being an interval scale, this was the way Doherty used the scale, \nand as he has validated his scale, we used it in a similar way. Subjects\u2019 susceptibility \nto negative emotional contagion, was interpreted as the average score of the sadness, \nfear and anger questions, while the average over the happiness questions indicates \nsusceptibility to positive contagion. To determine subjects\u2019 overall susceptibility, we \naveraged their susceptibility to positive and negative emotional contagion.15 One sub-\nject did not answer the last of the fear related questions, and one subject did not an-\nswer the last of the happiness related questions. One subject answered \u201cnever\u201d to all \nquestions, resulting in susceptibility scores of 0. The results suggest that subjects are \nmore susceptible to positive than to negative emotions (two-tailed t-test, p<.0001).   \n8.2.2 Emotional Contagion \nFigure 6 shows positive emotional contagion, that is, subjects\u2019 reported changes in en-\njoyment when the other person was happier than they, and negative emotional conta-\ngion. To be able to analyze the data using parametric tests, we treated each answer \ncategory of question Q1-Q8 as a separate variable coded 1 or 0 depending on whether \nthe answer was chosen or not, performing pairwise two-tailed T-tests.  \n \n \n                                                          \n15\n We could have averaged over all questions, but decided not to do this, as this would give a \nlot more weight to negative emotions, as we had to remove the love related questions.  \n  27 \nPositive emotional contagion Negative emotional contagion \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nDecrease\na lot\nDecrease\nslightly\nRemain\nthe same\nIncrease\nslightly\nIncrease\na lot\nDecrease\na lot\nDecrease\nslightly\nRemain\nthe same\nIncrease\nslightly\nIncrease\na lot\n \n \nAuthority ranking Communal sharing Market pricing Equality matching\n \nFig. 6. Results of Experiment 2 on questions Q1-4 (Positive emotional contagion), and Q5-8 \n(negative emotional contagion). Y-axis shows number of subjects who replied as indicated.  \nThe distinction between different relationships influences positive emotional con-\ntagion. Significantly more subjects responded that their enjoyment would remain the \nsame in the Market Pricing scenario compared to Communal Sharing and Authority \nRanking (p<0.05 for both tests). Similarly, more subjects responded that their enjoy-\nment would remain the same in Equality Matching compared to Communal Sharing \n(p<0.05). The difference between Equality Matching and Authority ranking was not \nsignificant. Reliably more subjects reported that their enjoyment would increase in the \nAuthority Ranking and Communal Sharing Scenarios, compared to Market Pricing \nand Equality Matching (p<0.05 for all four tests). The differences between Authority \nRanking and Communal sharing were not significant. These results indicate that the \npositive emotions of people you respect (Authority Ranking) or love (Communal \nSharing) impact your emotion more than those of people you are in a more indifferent \n(Equality Matching) or competitive (Market Pricing) relationship with.  \nThe distinction between different relationships also influences negative emotional \ncontagion. Significantly more subjects responded that their enjoyment would remain \nthe same in the Market Pricing and Equality Matching scenarios, than Communal \nSharing (p<0.05 for both tests). No significant differences were found with Authority \nranking. Moreover, more subjects\u2019 responded that their enjoyment would decrease in \nthe Communal Sharing scenario, compared to Market Pricing and Equality Matching \n(p<0.05 for both tests). The differences between Authority Ranking and the other sce-\nnarios were, however, not significant. \nWe found no real difference between negative and positive contagion. Despite our \nsubjects, according to Doherty\u2019s scale, being more susceptible to positive contagion, \nwe did not see any difference in the results. One possible explanation is that the dif-\nference between \u201cyou enjoy a little\u201d and \u201cthe other person is enjoying it greatly\u201d is \nsmaller than the difference between \u201cyou enjoy a little\u201d and \u201cthe other person really \nhates it\u201d. So, according to our proposed models, we would expect more contagion in \nthe latter case, and this could counterbalance the smaller susceptibility. Another pos-\n  28 \nsible explanation is that subjects are bad at predicting the size of a change in emotions \n(as confirmed by the affective forecasting literature discussed above), though they are \ngood at predicting the direction of a change in emotions (so, our analysis of the rela-\ntionship impact remains valid). In addition, the scale might not have given enough op-\ntions to make small distinctions in the size of the change.  \n8.2.3 Effect of susceptibility on emotional contagion \nWe next investigated whether the subjects\u2019 susceptibility to emotional contagion (as \ndetermined using Doherty\u2019s scale) affected the reported emotional contagion. Figure 7 \nshows the results of negative emotional contagion in two groups: one of subjects \nhighly susceptible to negative emotional contagion, and one with the remaining sub-\njects. The highly susceptible group contained the 11 subjects whose susceptibility to \nnegative emotions was above 1.5, meaning that on average they replied \u201cusually\u201d \n(which had a value of 2). At a glance, a higher percentage of subjects who were \nhighly susceptible indeed showed negative contagion happening. The only substantial \ndifference, however, is for the Communal Sharing relationship. \nA similar division into High and Low susceptibility groups for positive emotional \ncontagion proved harder, since almost all subjects were highly susceptible, if we were \nto use the same cut-off point as before. We would be left with only 5 subjects in the \nLow group, which is too few to reason sensibly with percentages. We would have to \nraise the cut-off point to just above 2, in order to get sensible group sizes. However, \nthis seems rather arbitrary, particularly as six subjects have a score of exactly 2, and it \nseems hard to defend an average of \u201cusually\u201d as indicating low susceptibility. \n \nHigh susceptibility group Low susceptibility group \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nDecrease Remain the\nsame\nIncrease\n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nDecrease Remain the\nsame\nIncrease\n \nAuthority ranking Communal sharing Market pricing Equality matching\n \nFig. 7. Percentage of subjects who answered that their enjoyment would decrease, remain the \nsame, or increase for questions Q5-Q8 for High and Low susceptibility groups. \n8.2.4 Answers to research questions \nFrom the analysis above, we find the following answers to our research questions: \n  29 \n\u2022 Occurrence of emotional contagion. Most subjects do think that emotional conta-\ngion will happen, but only for certain situations (see below).  \n\u2022 Difference between positive and negative contagion. We did not find a difference, \nbut this may be due to the experimental setup (as explained above).  \n\u2022 Effect of relationship type. There is a clear effect of relationship type on emotional \ncontagion. We did indeed find that Authority Ranking and Communal Sharing re-\nlationships lead to more emotional contagion than Equality Matching and Market \nPricing relationships.  \n\u2022 Market pricing. Hardly any subjects showed inverse contagion, and the data seems \nto point more to a very small positive value of \u03c1Market pricing  than a negative one. \n\u2022 Effect of susceptibility. There is some indication that susceptibility to emotional \ncontagion has an effect for Communal Sharing relationships. Given that \u03c1Market pric-\ning and \u03c1Equality matching seem close to zero, it would have been hard to find an effect \nfor those (as susceptibility is multiplied with \u03c1 in our models). We do not have \nenough data to draw strong conclusions here, but it seems wise to leave the suscep-\ntibility parameter in the model. \n9 Embarrassment and the issue of privacy \nLorrie Cranor, in her invited talk at UM2005, mentioned the case of a user whose \nTivo caused him considerable embarrassment when it wrongly assumed he was gay \n(having observed him watching gardening and cooking programs), and started re-\ncording gay programs for him (Zaslow, 2002). In a group recommendation situation, \nthis would be worse. Imagine your embarrassment if the TV started showing erotic \nitems to you and your friends, because it has wrongly assumed you are interested in \nthem. Particularly if, for the sake of transparency, it explained that it was showing \nthem, because of your interests. This is not merely a question of the system making \nwrong inferences, since it is possible that a user is interested in such items, but would \nrather their family or friends did not know. So, while the issue of privacy is regarded \nas increasingly important in the user modeling community (Kobsa & Cranor, 2005), it \nbecomes additionally important when recommendations are made to groups.  \nTo improve privacy in a group recommender, each item could have a privacy \nmeasure associated with it, in addition to a rating. This measure could be modeled as \na number between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning complete disclosure (the user does not \ncare whether others know this rating) and 0 meaning complete privacy (the rating can \nonly be used for personal recommendations). The group aggregation strategies could \ntake this measure into account (e.g. attaching less weight to ratings the user wants to \nkeep private).   \nA complication is that privacy is not only important to hide facts that are inherently \nembarrassing (like somebody wanting to hide their interest in building explosives). \nWhen discussing conformity above, we mentioned normative influences: people \nchanging their judgment to fit in with the group, to be liked. So, teenagers might want \nto hide far more innocent things, such as a preference for a particular band, when it is \nclear that all their friends detest it. When a recommendation is made to a group, we \nhave to ensure that individuals still have this option to conform, to hide the fact that \n  30 \nthey are different. One way to achieve this may be to let users have separate ratings \ndepending on the circumstances. For instance, the user could have a rating for private \nuse, one for their family, another for their friends, etc, allowing them to have different \npersonas in different settings as advocated by various privacy researchers (e.g. Kay et \nal., 2003). This is backed up by a world-wide-web poll which showed that almost \n60% of users would value being able to assume different aliases\/roles on the Internet \n(GVU 1998, as reported in Kobsa & Schreck, 2003). An advantage of the multiple \npersonas idea is that it extends to implicit modeling: when observing user actions, \nonly the user model of the active persona could be updated.  \nA limitation of the different personas approach is that humans are fallible, and it is \nquite possible that a user would occasionally forget to switch from his family persona \nto his private persona, when starting to watch some late night programs. Some seem-\ningly obvious ways to prevent this unfortunately do not work: \n\u2022 Always using a private persona when the user is alone would not give the group \nrecommender any implicit data about individual user preferences to work from. A \npossible workaround may be to have the user give explicit permission to transfer \ndata between user profiles, but this would require quite some effort from the user \nas it needs doing regularly in order to keep the profile up to date. \n\u2022 It is cumbersome to ask users which profile they would like to use whenever the \ngroup changes (assuming this is automatically detectable). Moreover, switching \npersonas may provoke suspicion (\u201cmy husband is hiding his tv preferences from \nme, so he must be a pervert or a maniac\u201d).  \n \nAnother limitation of using different personas is that an individual might not know \nbeforehand what the opinion of the others will be, making it harder to conform.  \nBecause of these two limitations, we will assume that even when users are using \nmultiple personas, they may occasionally want to hide the preferences of their per-\nsona. This means that scrutability in a group recommender with varying groups \nshould never go as far as divulging the details of the individuals\u2019 ratings to the group. \nIn the movie group recommender system PolyLens, where inferred ratings are option-\nally visible to the group, 93% of users preferred to share their ratings with the group, \nsuggesting that utility outbalances privacy (O\u2019Connor et al., 2001). However, \nPolyLens is a special case, as users would normally be members of only one group, \nand that group tends to be based on a similar taste in movies or a close friendship.  \nWe will use anonymity: when telling the group why a certain recommendation was \nmade, individual ratings and identities are not divulged, avoiding such explanations as \n\u201cThis was recommended because Pete really likes it\u201d. Instead, we could use explana-\ntions like \u201cThis was recommended because one of you really likes it\u201d. However, in \nsmaller groups, and particularly if groups vary regularly, it may still be quite easy to \nfigure out who is meant (e.g. one might notice that whenever Pete is present, chil-\ndren\u2019s movies are recommended, or the Rolling Stones are not played). Knowing that \nsomebody really likes something would allow a group to apply social pressure or to \nuse deduction to find out who the culprit is.  \nIt therefore seems wise to hide the existence of strong individual preferences that \ngo against the majority of the group. At least we should avoid explanations like \u201cThis \nwas recommended because one of you really likes it\u201d. We assume that users will \n  31 \nknow what group aggregation strategy is being used, to make the system more trans-\nparent. The question then arises whether the aggregation strategies differ on how \nmuch they protect privacy. For instance, the Least Misery Strategy selects items no-\nbody really hates. So, if you notice that an item you really like is not selected, and \nperhaps note that many other people in the group seem to regret its omission, you may \nget suspicious that somebody else hates it. The Average Strategy, by its nature, would \nonly give the information that most people probably like or dislike an item. So, we as-\nsume that the Average Strategy will protect privacy better. In theory, it seems that \nMultiplicative Utilitarianism (the strategy which performed best keeping users satis-\nfied in Masthoff, 2004a) and Average Without Misery would protect privacy some-\nwhere between the Least Misery and the Average strategy. In Experiment 3 below, we \nwill investigate users\u2019 views on this. The protection of privacy could then be an im-\nportant aspect of deciding which aggregation strategy to use. \nIn order to disguise user preferences further, we could add an additional, virtual \nmember to the group, clearly a different one for each group. This could be an embod-\nied agent presenting the recommendations. Users would be told that the virtual mem-\nber has tastes of its own, and that these tastes will influence the recommendations as \nwell, making it harder to attribute tastes to individuals, as they could always blame \nthe virtual character (who could be quite vocal about some of its tastes). It would also \nadd a bit of serendipity to the system. Rather than always showing the group what \nthey clearly will like, items can be thrown in for which it is unknown whether they \nwill be liked.  The virtual member could also impact conformity, since normative in-\nfluences diminish when another member of the group is shown to share your opinion. \nAn individual with a taste deviating from the group might feel less lonely, and more \nlikely to express an opinion, though this depends on them trusting the virtual member.  \n10 Experiment 3: Privacy of Group Aggregation Strategies \nIn this experiment, we investigate the impact different group aggregation strategies \nmay have on privacy. We are mainly interested in the extent to which users may think \na group aggregation strategy could betray their tastes to others, assuming they will be \nmost anxious to hide strong opinions (that they really like or really hate an item) and \nopinions that deviate from those of others in the group.  \nWe assume that a group recommender potentially betrays someone\u2019s taste if from a \nrecommendation given (in particular, from the inclusion or absence of an item in the \nrecommendation) others in the group are quite sure that somebody in the group likes \nor hates the item. Note that this does not necessarily betray who likes or hates the item \n(unless the group has only two members). That information could be obtained through \nsocial pressure, or knowledge gained from different (sub)groups. In this experiment, \nwe will investigate to what extent users feel sure about the existence of somebody in \nthe group with a taste opposite to their own. Note that \u201cfeel sure\u201d is different from \n\u201care sure\u201d. We could of course theoretically analyze the aggregation strategies, to de-\ntermine which strategy provides most privacy, but it seems equally important to de-\ntermine which strategy is regarded as providing most privacy.  \n  32 \n10.1 Experimental Design \nTwelve graduate students and staff of the University of Aberdeen\u2019s computing sci-\nence department participated in the experiment. Subjects were predominantly male \n(11 male, 1 female). We used a within-subjects design. Subjects were told to assume \nthat they were going to listen to music together with a group of other people, that the \nDJ had everyone\u2019s opinions on songs as ratings between 1 (really hate) to 10 (really \nlike), and that the DJ would use the individual people\u2019s ratings to calculate a rating of \neach song for the group. As a within subject variable, four hypothetical situations \nwere sketched, each corresponding to a group aggregation strategy. All situations \n(with a small exception, see below) followed the format:  \n\u201cThe DJ has calculated ratings for the group by [group aggregation strategy].  \n1. A song your really like has not been played. \n\u2212 How sure are you that somebody in the group hates it?  \n\u2212 How sure are you that most of the group hates it?  \n2. A song you really hate has been played.  \n\u2212 How sure are you that somebody in the group likes it?  \n\u2212 How sure are you that most of the group likes it?\u201d \nWe used a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from \u201cnot sure at all\u201d to \u201cextremely sure\u201d. \nFrom the group aggregation strategies described in (Masthoff, 2004a), the four we \nused were: \n\u2022 Average: \u201caveraging all individual ratings.\u201d \n\u2022 Least Misery: \u201ctaking the minimum of individual ratings.\u201d \n\u2022 Multiplicative Utilitarian: \u201cmultiplying the individual ratings.\u201d \n\u2022 Average Without Misery: \u201cremoving all songs anybody really hated and averaging \nthe individual ratings for the remaining songs.\u201d \nA slight modification to the question was made for Average Without Misery. As \nthis strategy makes it impossible for an item you really hate to be selected, we re-\nmoved the word \u201creally\u201d from the sentence \u201cA song you really hate has been played.\u201d \nSee Appendix 2 for the exact wording of the questions.  \n10.2 Results and Discussion \nIt should be noted that none of the aggregation strategies should really produce cer-\ntainty on any of the questions. We left the description of the situation purposely \nvague: subjects did not know anything about the ratings given by others (we had no \nchoice on this, given the questions we were going to ask). Any of the strategies could \nresult in a song an individual really liked (or hated) not being played (or being played) \nwithout anybody in the group having the opposite opinion. For instance, if everybody \nin the group liked all the songs, then a lowest rating of 7 (somebody still quite liking \nit) might result in it not being played. Therefore, theoretically subjects could have an-\nswered 1 (not sure at all) to all questions. However, as would happen in a real life \nsituation, subjects seemed to assume that everybody would have some songs they \nliked and some they hated. Also, their answers may have been relative: indicating that \nthey thought a statement more likely to be true for one strategy than for another. \n  33 \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nSomebody\nhates\nMost hate Somebody\nlikes\nMost like\n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nSomebody\nhates\nMost hate Somebody\nlikes\nMost like\nAverage\nLeast Misery\nMultiplicative\nAverage Without Misery\nFig. 8. Left-hand side: Average over subjects of the certainty scores (1=not sure at all, \n7=extremely sure) Right-hand side: Percentage of subjects being certain (score of 5 or above). \nTwo subjects were puzzled by the \u201ca song you hate has been played\u201d questions for \nAverage Without Misery. They did not answer these, stating \u201cThis can\u2019t happen\u201d and \n\u201cDJ cheated\u201d. One of these subjects also did not answer the \u201ca song you really hate \nhas been played\u201d questions for the Least Misery strategy. They are right that these \nsituations would be unlikely to happen, though both situations can theoretically occur.  \nFigure 8 shows the average over subjects of the certainty scores, and the percent-\nage of subjects who were sure (i.e., had a score \u2265 5). The only strategy that clearly \nseems to evoke different responses is Least Misery: all subjects were sure that when a \nsong they really liked had not been played somebody hated it, with an average score \nof 6.5. They also were very unsure that most hated it (average of 2.25). This is exactly \nthe kind of situation where tensions in a group might arise: an individual being upset \nbecause one of his favorites has been skipped, being extremely sure that somebody \nelse hated it (and therefore caused the skipping), and not believing that everybody \nelse hated it (so, feeling free to prosecute the \u201csinner\u201d). Thus, Least Misery seems bad \nat protecting privacy. Although the inferences being made may well be wrong, they \ncan cause distress when they are right (as they often will be).  \nWe assumed in the previous section that the Average Strategy would protect pri-\nvacy better than the Multiplicative and the Average Without Misery strategies, as the \nlatter both prevent misery. This was not confirmed by the results. The trend was for \nthe Multiplicative Strategy to perform slightly (but not significantly) better than the \nAverage Strategy. This shows that users are not very good at grasping the implica-\ntions of the strategies. As one subject commented \u201cI have no intuitive feeling for the \ndifference between averaging and multiplying when non-zero numbers are involved\u201d. \nThis corresponds with findings by a.o. Tversky and Kahneman (as discussed in \nCarofiglio & de Rosis, 2001) on how bad people are in probabilitistic reasoning. \nThough one may expect our subjects to be better at this than the average population, \ngiven their computing science background, Barwise (as discussed in Carofiglio & de \nRosis, 2001) found that even mathematicians are not better at such tasks.  \n  34 \nOverall, we conclude that Least Misery should be avoided for privacy reasons, but \nthat it is fine to use the Multiplicative strategy. \n11 Conclusions \nThere has been little work so far on computational models of affective state that can \npredict (rather than measure) how the user of a recommender system will be feeling. \nGonz\u00e1lez et al (2004) have worked on the modelling of affective state for a recom-\nmender system, but their model is mainly based on an emotional intelligence test \ncombined with updating of emotional values based on feedback to recommendations. \nThere has been more research on the modelling of the affective state of artificial \nagents, where emotions are often related to plan completion and goal attainment, and \nmodelling often happens using belief networks (e.g. de Rosis et al., 2003; Grath, \n2000). Users in a recommender system do not really have plans (unless it is to be en-\ntertained or informed), so this research does not tend to generalize to recommender \nsystems. This paper tries to fill the gap. Modelling affective state is particularly im-\nportant when adapting to groups of users, as a group adaptation system will not be \nable to please all of its users all of the time. In such a case, an accurate prediction of \nthe affective state of individual users can be helpful to prevent any user becoming too \ndissatisfied. Models of affective state can also be used to evaluate group aggregation \nstrategies (Masthoff, 2004a).  \nWe have proposed four different functions for modelling user satisfaction in a \ngroup recommender system that recommends sequences of items, incorporating as-\nsimilation and decay of emotions with time.   \nThe evaluation of models of affective state is particularly difficult. In this paper, \nwe have explained the issues involved, and have shown how evaluation is possible via \nindirect experiments, simulations, and experiments in another domain. In the process, \nwe have found that Variant 3 of our satisfaction functions seems to perform best, and \nconfirmed that time decay and assimilation parameters (\u03b4 and \u03b5) depend on the user.  \nUnfortunately, modelling affective state becomes additionally complex when deal-\ning with groups, because of members of the group influencing each other\u2019s emotions, \nvia emotional contagion and conformity. We have shown how this can be incorpo-\nrated into the models. We have also shown that the type of relationship the user has \nwith others is important to take into account. In particular, Authority Ranking and \nCommunal Sharing relationships seem to evoke more emotional contagion then Mar-\nket Pricing and Equality Matching relationships.  \nModels of individual satisfaction are not only useful when adapting to groups. As \nargued in (Masthoff, 2003; 2004b), adaptation to individuals can sometimes also \nbenefit from group aggregation strategies, for instance, when ratings on multiple crite-\nria need to be combined, or when virtual group members are added, e.g. representing \na teacher. \nModels of affective state are not only useful for recommender systems, but also for \nother adaptive systems such as intelligent tutoring systems. While initially most of the \nfocus in intelligent tutoring systems was on modelling of and adapting to cognitive as-\npects of the learner, gradually interest has increased in modelling of and adapting to a \n  35 \nlearner\u2019s affective state (see for instance Picard et al., 2004; del Soldato, 1994; de Vin-\ncent, 2003). Wosnitza & Volet (2005) discuss the importance of human teachers having \naccess to their students\u2019 affective states. Understanding a student\u2019s affective state can al-\nlow an intelligent tutoring system to adapt its instruction, material selection and feedback \nto keep the learner sufficiently motivated and challenged; it can also be used to teach \nlearners how to deal with failure and frustration (Burleson & Picard, 2004). While exist-\ning work tends to measure affective state, rather than calculating it, and this can be done \ntheory-neutrally (Picard et al., 2004), a theory is required to predict changes in affective \nstate. For instance, if you want to select the next exercise for a student to do, it would be \ngood if you could predict how the student would be feeling after each possible exercise. \nWe believe that the work presented in this paper can be adapted to do this. It would also \navoid the need for continuous self-reporting which interrupts the learning experience and \nthe need for intrusive and costly sensors.  \nA lot of work on group modelling has been on modelling common knowledge be-\ntween group members (e.g. Introne & Alterman, 2006; Suebnukarn & Haddawy, \n2006), modelling how a group interacts (e.g. Read et al, 2006; McLaren et al., 2006) \nand group formation based on individual models (e.g. Read et al., 2006; Alfonseca et \nal., 2006). The affective state of the group members is normally not taken into ac-\ncount. It would be interesting to explore how affective state can be used as part of \ngroup formation (or group break up), and to model not just how individuals are con-\ntributing and how their knowledge deviates from the group\u2019s, but also how they are \nlikely to feel because of this.  \nOne might think that accurate predictions of individual satisfaction can also be \nused to improve the transparency of adaptive systems: showing how satisfied others \nin your group are, or how satisfied criteria are, could improve the users\u2019 understand-\ning of the working of the system and perhaps make it easier to accept items they do \nnot like. This may be a good idea for a system that adapts to individual users. How-\never, in a group adaptation system, users\u2019 need for privacy is likely to conflict with \ntheir need for transparency. An important task of a group adaptation system is to \navoid embarrassment. Users often like to conform with the group to avoid being dis-\nliked. We modelled this normative conformity as part of our modelling of how others \nin the group can influence individual affective state. We may be able to use this to \npredict how embarrassed a user would be with disclosure of their judgement, and base \nour explanation of system recommendations on this. We have also investigated how \ndifferent group aggregation strategies may affect privacy. \nThis paper has discussed many of the issues involved in modelling affective state \nin recommender systems. We hope it will inspire a lot more research into this area.  \nAcknowledgements \nJudith Masthoff\u2019s research is partly supported by Nuffield Foundation Grant No. \nNAL\/00258\/G.
