ESMA AND SUPERVISION \n1.1 Introduction \nThe January 2011 establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority \n(ESMA)1 was an epochal moment for EU financial market regulation. ESMA, \n                                                                                                                                               \n\u2217\u2217  N. Moloney, \u2018The European Securities and Markets Authority and Institutional Design for \nthe EU Financial Market \u2013 A Tale of Two Competences: Part (1) Rule-making\u2019, 12 European \nBusiness Organization Law Review (2011) p. 41 (Part 1). \n1 Regulation (EU) No 1095\/2010, OJ 2010 L 331\/84. The 2010 Omnibus Directive sets out the first \nset of delegations to ESMA under pre-existing EU rules: Directive 2010\/78\/EU, OJ 2010 L 331\/120. It is \nto be implemented by 31 December 2011. ESMA\u2019s first official publication took the form of an FAQ \ndocument: ESMA, Frequently Asked Questions. A Guide to Understanding ESMA (2011). \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 179\ntogether with the two other European Supervisory Authorities or \u2018ESAs\u2019 (the \nEuropean Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational \nPensions Authority (EIOPA)),2 the European Systemic Risk Board (the ESRB, which \nhas overall responsibility for monitoring systemic risk.3) and Member State \ncompetent authorities, forms part of the new European System of Financial \nSupervision (ESFS). The ESAs replace the networked-based and unstable \u20183L3\u2019 \ncommittees (CESR (in the securities field), CEBS (in the banking field) and CEIOPS \n(insurance and occupational pensions)) which previously advised the Commission on \ndelegated rules and engaged in a range of supervisory coordination and convergence \nactivities. \nThe purpose of this article is to examine ESMA\u2019s likely impact on \u2018rules in \naction\u2019 or on the supervision of EU financial markets. The notion of rule-making, \ncanvassed in Part 1, is relatively intuitive. But an initial definitional issue arises with \nrespect to supervision. The border line between rules and supervisory practices is \nblurring as rules become more focused on outcomes and as operational supervisory \npractices are shaped by process-based rules.4 But as suggested in Part 1, the \ndistinction remains valid and useful in the EU context. So what is supervision?5 The \n2009 de Larosi\u00e8re Report suggests that \nthe prime objective of supervision is to ensure that the rules applicable to the \nfinancial sector are adequately implemented, in order to preserve financial \nstability and thereby to ensure confidence in the financial system as a whole and \nsufficient protection for the customers of financial services.6 \nBut the \u2018adequate implementation\u2019 of financial market rules presupposes that optimal \ndecisions are made with respect to a host of determinative factors. These include: the \nparticular outcomes which rules should pursue and the style of rules (whether rule or \n                                                                                                                                               \nOn ESMA, see further E.

Teixeira, \u2018The New Financial \nStability Architecture in the EU\u2019 (2009), available at: <http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=1509304>. \n4 E.g., the emerging concern with product governance rules, noted infra. \n5 This discussion is concerned with ex ante supervision rather than with ex post enforcement, \nin part as enforcement is also a function of private action and is not the exclusive domain of the \nsupervisor. But the balance between ex ante supervision and ex post enforcement has significant \nimplications for the achievement of good supervisory outcomes. \n6 The High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU, Report (2009) (the DLG Report), \nat pp. 38-39. \n180 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nprinciples-based, process or standard-based, for example.7); the institutional structure \nof supervision; the supervisor\u2019s organisational incentives and internal structures; the \nsupervisory style adopted (whether supervision is risk-based, for example.8); the \nintensity of supervision (including the extent to which internal firm processes are \nrelied on by the supervisor, or whether the supervisor second-guesses and\/or models \nthe impact of firm practices); the quality of the information sources available to the \nsupervisor; and the allocation of resources.9 Market features (including the \ndominance or otherwise of retail investors) and political factors also determine the \nnature of supervision and the outcomes it achieves. This complexity is reflected in \nthe IMF\/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Programme\u2019s characterisation of \nsupervision in terms of the authority and tools of the supervisor to monitor and verify \ncompliance and to remedy, enforce, take control and restructure;10 this approach \nassociates supervision with the supervisor\u2019s overall \u2018capacity to act\u2019.11 \nThe notion of supervision is further stratified in the EU. First, and traditionally, it \nis concerned with the coordination and organisation of supervision across the internal \nfinancial market, whether through, for example, the allocation of home\/host \nsupervisory jurisdiction, cooperation and information-sharing obligations, delegation \nstructures, voluntary cooperation and coordination devices, colleges of supervisors, \ncross-border resolution and rescue mechanisms, or, ultimately, through the allocation \nof supervision to a central authority. The coordination element has long been a \nfeature of EU intervention. The second element, which, for the most part, is new to \nthe EU, concerns the operational business of supervision and how the achievement of \nparticular outcomes by Member State supervisors and\/or pan-EU coordinating \nstructures can be supported. Here, the spectrum of potential EU intervention ranges \nfrom soft guidance on how supervision should be carried out, to EU intervention \nconcerning the different elements which shape supervisory decision-making and, \nultimately, to the transfer of operational supervisory control to a central authority. \n                                                                                                                                               \n7 For an early discussion of rule design and its impact on outcomes, see J.

Well-canvassed difficulties \narise in the cross-border supervision of financial market actors, the management of \ncross-border risk transmission, and the construction of effective coordination \nsystems, as the financial crisis has made clear.13 The questions which operational \nsupervision and the achievement of outcomes raise are challenging, as discussed \nbelow. The difficulties are all the greater in the EU context. \n1.2 The sharpened focus on achieving outcomes through supervision \nWhile the EU now controls the financial market rule-book, supervision (and \nenforcement) of rules has long been a Member State competence. Since the outset, \nefforts have been made to ensure some degree of supervisory coordination and to \nallocate supervisory jurisdiction.14 But practical convergence on operational \nsupervisory practices has been given little attention. The last great reform period, the \nFinancial Services Action Plan (FSAP)\/Lamfalussy era, was characterised by a concern \nto enhance law-making and to streamline the cumbersome Treaty-based procedures for \nlegislating. Supervision was a concern of the Lamfalussy process through \u2018level 3,\u2019 \nwhich addressed coordination and practical supervisory convergence. But despite \nCESR\u2019s initial efforts in this direction, including the important 2004 Himalaya Report \nwhich considered the supervisory \u2018tool box\u2019 that CESR would use to promote \ncoordination,15 it would not be until the 2007 Lamfalussy Review.16 that serious \nattention was given to supervision. The Review was not, however, ambitious and \nfollowed the soft \u2018supervisory convergence\u2019 model which CESR had promoted. Peer \nreview, mediation, support of delegation, best practice sharing, institutional support of \ncross-border cooperation concerning market abuse (through CESR-Pol) and the \nenforcement of financial reporting (through CESR-Fin) were all features of this \n                                                                                                                                               \n12  E.g., CESR, First Progress Report on Supervisory Convergence in the Field of Securities \nMarkets for the Financial Services Committee (2005) (CESR\/05-202) and CESR, 2006 Report on \nSupervisory Convergence in the Field of Securities Markets (2006) (CESR\/06-259b). \n13  From the large financial crisis scholarship, see, on specific coordination mechanisms, D. \nAlford, \u2018Supervisory Colleges: The Global Financial Crisis and Improving International Supervisory \nCoordination\u2019 (2010), available at: <http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=1545291>, and, on the underlying \nproblems including divergences in national policy preferences, C.

Immediately prior to the financial crisis, the EU\u2019s supervisory agenda \nwas therefore framed in terms of better coordination and a gradual hardening of the \nsoft powers of the 3L3 committee network.17 \nThe network model which characterised international supervisory coordination \nstruggled over the financial crisis.18 It came under much greater strain at EU level \nwhere, although it was institutionally and legally significantly more sophisticated, it \nwas subject to intense pressure from the banking crisis and from poor coordination of \npan-EU banking group supervision. While severe weaknesses were revealed in the \nEU\u2019s rule-book, the fiscal risks to Member States from poor supervisory \ncoordination and operational management of cross-border risk transmission in an \nintegrated market were laid bare.19 The importance of effective operational \nsupervision, on a micro level as well as with respect to overall systemic risk and \nmacro-prudential supervision, was a recurring theme in the seminal February 2009 \nDLG Report.20 It highlighted the lack of adequate macro-prudential supervision, \nineffective early warning systems and the inability of supervisors to take common \ndecisions. But, and of more direct relevance for financial market supervision, it also \nnoted more micro-operational failures, including problems of competence, failures to \nchallenge supervisory practices and a lack of consistent supervisory powers. Similar \nthemes emerged in the Commission\u2019s Communication on Driving European \nRecovery,21 the June 2009 European Council endorsement of the establishment of a \nnew system of financial supervision.22 and the European Parliament\u2019s 2008 call for \nsupervision to be strengthened.23 More recently, CESR\u2019s 2010 \u2018mapping exercise\u2019 on \nemergency powers revealed considerable differences between the powers exercisable \nby competent authorities in different Member States.24 \n                                                                                                                                               \n17  Moloney, supra n. 14, at pp. 1152-1167. \n18  Particularly in terms of the inability of IOSCO and the Basel Committee to respond to the \ncrisis: D.

More \nsophisticated mechanisms have been developed to support cross-border coordination \nunder the 2009 UCITS IV Directive, for example.27 A new generation of EU rules \nwhich sit much closer than previously to the difficult boundary where rules and \nsupervision interact is emerging and is likely to have \u2018spill-over\u2019 effects for \nsupervision. This is particularly the case with respect to product regulation. \nTraditionally eschewed by regulators as generating, inter alia, obsolescence, \ninnovation and moral hazard risks, product regulation is experiencing something of a \nrenaissance in the EU. In early 2011, for example, the UK FSA produced a major \nassessment of the role of retail product regulation which calls for a much more \nprescriptive approach to product design and for a closer supervisory focus on how \nproducts are designed.28 While considerably less radical, the MiFID Review.29 has \nsuggested that the organisational and risk management requirements which apply to \nMiFID-scope product providers be enhanced and extended to capture the particular \nrisks raised by product design.30 While novel in itself, this approach will demand \ngreater convergence in how competent authorities approach supervision. The FSA\u2019s \nmodel, on which the MiFID Review is based, reflects parallel changes to how the \nFSA approaches retail market conduct risk under its Intensive Supervision model;31 \nthe largest firms can expect a \u2018very intensive and intrusive assessment of their \ngovernance processes and the products that these deliver\u2019.32 If this approach is to be \n                                                                                                                                               \n25  E.g., European Commission, Communication on Crisis Resolution (COM(2010) 579), \nsetting out the Commission\u2019s agenda for crisis resolution mechanisms, and DG Internal Market and \nServices, Working Document, Technical Details of a Possible EU Framework for Bank Recovery \nand Resolution, January 2011. \n26  Directive 2009\/111\/EC, OJ 2009 L 302\/97. \n27  Directive 2009\/65\/EC, OJ 2009 L 302\/32, Arts. 19 and 20. \n28  FSA, Discussion Paper 11\/1, Product Intervention (2011). \n29  European Commission, Public Consultation.

It is the establishment of ESMA, \nhowever, which has the most significant implications for supervision (section 2). \n1.3 The implications \nPart 1 suggested that the primary question for EU financial market scholarship with \nrespect to law-making concerns the relative efficiency of the EU and its Member States \nas law-maker(s) for the EU financial market. Supervision prompts the same question, \nalthough difficult issues of task allocation also arise, given the different operational \nsupervision, crisis management and supervisory convergence aspects of supervision. \nWhile a strong case can be made for the EU to act as the primary rule-maker for EU \nfinancial markets, the intensification of the EU\u2019s influence on supervision and on how \noutcomes are achieved poses a number of challenges. Efficiencies follow from a more \neffective system for supervisory coordination given the prevalence of pan-EU actors \nand heightened possibilities for risk transmission. Competent authorities may benefit \nfrom importing a set of harmonised operational supervisory practices as rules become \nmore complex and the political demands on supervisors, facing a \u2018never again\u2019 \nzeitgeist, become more intense. ESMA may prove efficient in discovering optimum \nsupervisory practices, and may cut through the pre-ESMA informal network-based \nsystem which allowed for flexibility, experimentation and learning, but which took \ntime. But there are significant challenges. \nThe EU\u2019s experience with operational supervision and with related institutional \nreform is limited. CESR is the obvious precedent. While CESR was largely focused \non \u2018rules on the books\u2019, its guidance had implications for operational supervision. \nCESR recommended, for example, that a mixed risk-based and sampling approach \nshould be adopted with respect to financial information rules.33 But CESR was \nlargely concerned with establishing the reach of EU rules and consensus positions on \ntheir interpretation and not with how to achieve convergence on the granular \nelements of supervision. Its peer review exercises, for example, mostly aimed at \nassessing formal powers on the books rather than at operational supervision,34 and \ndid not yield strong results.35 With respect to coordination, while CESR made efforts \nin the field of mediation, delegation and information sharing, and established \nstructures for supporting supervisory coordination in regard to market abuse (CESR-\nPol) and financial information (CESR-Fin),36 its activities were generally limited. As \na result, the EU has little to draw on in terms of prior experience either with \n                                                                                                                                               \n33  CESR, Standard No. 1 on Financial Information, Principle 13 (CESR\/03-073). \n34  The market abuse regime exercises (CESR\/10-262, CESR\/09-1120 and CESR\/07-380), e.g., \nfocused for the most part on the formal powers which supervisors can exercise, rather than on the \noperational exercise of these powers. \n35  Infra n. 109. \n36  Moloney, supra n. 14, at pp. 1127-1132. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 185\ncentralised models for coordination or with the setting of standards for operational \nsupervision. \nFew international templates are available as to how coordination and operational \nconvergence can be organised cross-border. International bodies have traditionally \nnot overly concerned themselves with operational supervision. \u2018Big ticket\u2019 \ncoordination issues, including crisis management and the operation of international \ncolleges of supervisors, and with respect to systemically important financial \ninstitutions, have received close attention in the wake of the crisis in a number of \nfora, most notably the Financial Stability Board. But there has been less interest in \nthe day-to-day business of financial market supervision and in the implementation of \nstandards,37 perhaps as the soft law standards produced by international standard-\nsetters might be regarded as popular precisely because they allow states and \nregulators to \u2018under-enforce\u2019 and so defect from these commitments.38 IOSCO has \nbeen primarily concerned with cross-border supervisory cooperation and \ncoordination (through its multilateral Memorandum of Understanding in particular).39 \nWhile a more operational theme is emerging from IOSCO initiatives,40 particularly \nwith respect to emerging markets,41 it has generally not engaged closely with \noperational matters. The Financial Stability Board may play a larger role in the \ndevelopment of supervisory best practices, particularly through its evolving role in \npeer review of standard implementation.42 But the array of local and path-dependent \nfactors which feed into the achievement of supervisory outcomes make it unlikely \nthat sensible templates can be developed internationally. \nESMA\u2019s adoption of operational standards for Member States\u2019 competent \nauthorities and for the exercise of its direct powers raises further difficulties.

But the way in which supervision is delivered reflects a range \nof different factors (from an institutional perspective, these include organisational \nstructure, degree of independence, nature of powers, organisational dynamics and \nincentives, and resourcing, for example), which differ across supervisory regimes.43 \nThe outcomes achieved from the mix may not necessarily be the product of clearly \nobservable factors, but can reflect how the supervisor engages with the regulated \nsector and the wider environmental factors which bear on this relationship.44 The UK \nFSA\u2019s Turner Review, for example, attempted to benchmark the FSA\u2019s post-crisis \nsupervisory model against international comparators, but concluded that the crisis \nhad not identified which supervisory models were best equipped to deal with the \ncrisis, given the range of political, market, regulatory, societal and other variables \nwhich influence supervision.45 It is therefore difficult to ascertain which factors lead \nto strong supervisory outcomes. It is likely to be perilous to export models to \ndifferent jurisdictions and, in particular, to detach different elements from a \nparticular supervisory matrix and to apply it on a pan-EU basis. For example, \nsupervision is currently delivered across the EU through a wide range of institutional \nstructures (consolidated, twin-peak-based and sectorally split structures).46 These are \nexposed to different effectiveness risks (including with respect to organisational \ndynamics and incentives)47 and will engage with supervisory practices in different \nways.48 \nFurther difficulties arise. Nimble and imaginative supervision can act as a safety \nvalve which releases some of the pressure generated by regulatory homogeneity. \nFinancial market regulation is becoming more homogenous, both in the EU and \ninternationally. Supervision may therefore become a defence against systemic \nregulatory error, as well as a key instrument of competition between and discipline \non supervisors. While it has since come under pressure,49 the UK FSA\u2019s \u2018Treating \nCustomers Fairly\u2019 supervisory model,50 for example, allowed the FSA to calibrate the \nimpact of MiFID on the UK\u2019s retail investment product market, which has distinctive \n                                                                                                                                               \n43  Supra n. 9. \n44  R.

Careful and calibrated supervision may also provide some protection against \nfirms, in an increasingly standardised regulatory environment, adopting in response \nsimilar business models which can generate systemic risk; the large-scale \nhomogeneity of losses from exposure to securitised debt was a major source of \nsystemic risk over the crisis. Although structures are being put in place post-crisis to \nmonitor systemic risk, they remain untried, and much will depend on the \neffectiveness of local supervision and on its ability to respond to particular firm \nrisks.52 \nExperimentation and flexibility are all the more necessary as effective supervision \nis not easy to achieve. The different elements of effective supervision in practice are \nmany and complex and reflect local experience and supervisory learning. The FSA\u2019s \nsupervisory approach, for example, has changed significantly in the wake of the \ncrisis following the adoption of the Intensive Supervision model. Retail markets \nsupervision has undergone a related radical change from a predominantly disclosure \nand distribution-based approach to a more intensive and intrusive one which is \ndesigned to lead to early risk identification and proactive intervention.53 The \nproposed Financial Conduct Authority (previously termed the Consumer Protection \nand Markets Authority and which, with the proposed Prudential Regulatory \nAuthority, will shortly replace the FSA) will be charged with undertaking \ncomprehensive risk analysis in the retail markets and with following an issues-based \napproach to supervision, in parallel with intensive firm-facing supervision.54 The \nparticular elements of this approach are many and sophisticated. The UK FSA\u2019s \nrecently unveiled product intervention strategy, for example, highlights early \nidentification of conduct risk (conduct risk specialists have been recruited.55), retail \nconduct risk outlook analysis, business model and strategy analysis, and an intensive \nsupervisory approach.56 But this new approach, which promises much for the retail \nmarket and elements of which are appearing in the MiFID Review, reflects long \ndifficulties with mis-selling in the UK retail markets, the spill-over of the Intensive \n                                                                                                                                               \n51  N.

Principles-based regulation, for example, now faces an uncertain \nfuture.57 \nDifficult choices must also be made as to resource allocation. Supervisors \noperating with finite resources, subject to information asymmetries, and in a complex \nregulatory and market environment must, for example, make choices about the extent \nto which they will \u2018enrol\u2019 market actors in the supervisory process.58 Prior to the \nfinancial crisis, considerable weight was given by some supervisory models to \ninternal systems-and-controls-based supervision. The FSA\u2019s supervisory model, for \nexample, largely focused on ensuring that firms had appropriate systems and \ncontrols. This model was based on the assumption that primary responsibility for risk \nshould lie with senior management of financial institutions and that supervision \nshould focus on systems and processes rather than on overall business models.59 In \nthe wake of the crisis, however, the FSA moved to its Intensive Supervision model, \nwhich involves a shift away from relying on internal systems and controls and on \nmanagement judgment and towards challenging business models and modelling, and \nreacting to, potential risks.60 \nWhere operational standards are harmonised it becomes all the more difficult for \ncompetent authorities to experiment, learn and adapt. Recent statements in the UK \nare revealing. In 2010, FSA Chief Executive Sants noted that \u2018the FSA\u2019s \neffectiveness should thus [given international rule harmonisation] primarily be \njudged on the effectiveness of our supervision and not the quality of the rules\u2019.61 In \nthe 2011\/2012 FSA Business Plan it was noted that the ESAs had left \u2018the FSA and \nits successor bodies primarily acting in a policy-influencing and national supervisory \nrole\u2019 and that the FSA had become \u2018the supervisory arm of a European rule-making \n                                                                                                                                               \n57  On the risks of different styles of regulation, and lessons from the crisis, see J.

But the potential \ninfluence of ESMA on supervision may limit local operational discretion and \nflexibility considerably in practice, as now seems to be recognised within the FSA.64 \nAll these difficulties are exacerbated as complex questions of degree arise with \nrespect to the institutional shape of EU-led supervision, given the \u2018top down\u2019 and \n\u2018bottom up\u2019 dynamics and the related momentum effects. From a \u2018top down\u2019 \nperspective, the financial crisis has exposed the risks which follow where cross-\nborder actors are not subject to coordinated supervision, coordinated emergency \naction cannot be taken and pan-EU monitoring of risk is limited. But the \ncentralisation of emergency powers demands an institutional structure of some sort. \nConsiderable momentum risks then arise in relation to the more workaday \noperational powers which can be subsequently granted to, or organically acquired by, \nthe new structure. From a bottom-up perspective, greater sharing of best practices \nand stronger peer discipline can strengthen pan-EU financial market supervision. But \noperational supervision of market actors should remain at Member State level \n(section 2.10 below). Designing a system which supports some degree of operational \ncentralisation, retains the power of national supervisors and supports greater \nconvergence, all the while preventing an undue leakage of power from the Member \nStates, was never going to be easy. \nThe difficulties are all the greater given the financial stability agenda which has \ndriven the new structure. ESMA is a product of an institutional and political concern \nto manage the wider prudential and systemic risks which the financial crisis exposed; \nthe final institutional trilogue (Commission\/Council\/Parliament) negotiations over \nsummer 2010, for example, focused on the EBA template. But securities markets \nremain different to banking markets,65 and the financial stability risks which \ncurrently frame the scholarly and policy debate, while common to all market \nsegments, are stronger in the banking markets than in the securities markets. As the \ncrisis has made clear, the risks which cross-border banking can generate, including \nwith respect to a withdrawal of liquidity from host states and risk transmission across \n                                                                                                                                               \n62  FSA, Business Plan 2011\/2012, at pp. 9 and 25. \n63  Supra n. 54, para. 7.7. \n64  Ferran has noted the FSA\u2019s concern on this point: supra n. 1, at pp. 44-45. \n65  D.

Securities \nmarkets can also transmit systemic risk. Different practices, such as proprietary \ndealing, and different structures, such as central clearing counterparties (CCPs), have \nbeen associated with the financial crisis; so too has the wider failure of securities \nmarkets to price risk effectively.67 It is also the case that silo-based regulation \nstruggles to capture the interconnected and complex nature of risk and that securities \nregulators need to become better at managing systemic risk.68 Nonetheless, certain \ncross-border financial market actors (such as issuers) do not transmit systemic risk \ncross-border to the same degree as systemically important financial institutions. But \nreflecting the spill-over dynamics which are a long-standing feature of EU financial \nmarkets law, the financial stability agenda will lead to ESMA exercising significant \noperational control over all aspects of the securities markets, including the \ndisclosure, transparency and market abuse spheres which have been less to the fore \nover the financial crisis. \nIt seems reasonable, accordingly, that ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers should be \ncarefully confined and national supervisory discretion protected. But the hesitancy \nwhich characterises ESMA\u2019s law-making powers is not in evidence with respect to \nits supervisory powers. In terms of coordination, it wields an array of powers of \nincreasing intensity which culminate in ESMA\u2019s ability to supplant national \nsupervisors. In terms of operational convergence, ESMA\u2019s ability to shape \nsupervisory practice is considerable. Ultimately, local supervisory discretion and \nflexibility may be placed under undue pressure to the detriment of effective local \nsupervision and pan-EU supervisory learning. ESMA\u2019s extensive direct supervisory \npowers may also lead to sub-optimal outcomes. ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers are \nexamined in the following section. \n2. ESMA\u2019S SUPERVISORY POWERS \n2.1 Coordination: in crisis and in normal conditions \nInitiatives to ensure better supervisory coordination in a crisis are a central element \nof the financial stability agenda.

Its related responsibilities include monitoring market developments \nand, in coordination with the ESRB, initiating and coordinating assessments of the \nresilience of market participants (Article 32). It has a general coordination role under \nArticle 31, which empowers ESMA to promote a coordinated EU response to crisis \nsituations by, inter alia, facilitating information exchange, verifying the reliability of \ninformation and notifying the ESRB of potential emergency situations. In an \n\u2018emergency\u2019 situation under Article 18(1) (section 2.5 below) ESMA is to facilitate \nactively and, where necessary, coordinate competent authority action in cases of \nadverse developments which may seriously jeopardise the orderly functioning and \nintegrity of financial markets or the stability in whole or part of the EU financial \nsystem. \nCrisis coordination apart, ESMA is to \u2018stimulate and facilitate\u2019 the delegation of \nsupervisory tasks and responsibilities between competent authorities (Article 28). \nThe \u2018supervisory culture\u2019 activities engaged in by CESR are also ESMA\u2019s \nresponsibility. Under Article 29 it is to play an active role in building a common EU \nsupervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices through, for example, \nproviding opinions to competent authorities, supporting information exchange and \nestablishing training programmes. \nReflecting current EU policy, and by contrast with CESR, ESMA will also have a \nprominent operational role in colleges of supervisors.69 The 2009 CRD II requires \nthat supervisory colleges be established, their roles be clarified and a larger role be \ngiven to the supervisors of systemically significant branches in colleges,70 while the \nCommission\u2019s 2010 Communication on crisis resolution proposes \u2018resolution \ncolleges\u2019.71 ESMA is likewise conferred with a range of powers to support supervis-\nory colleges. It is to contribute to promoting and monitoring colleges of supervisors \nand to participate in college activities, including on-site examinations (Article 21(1) \nand (2)). ESMA may establish and manage information systems for colleges, initiate \nEU stress tests and evaluate systemic risk, and oversee the tasks carried out by \ncompetent authorities. ESMA may also request further deliberation by a college \nwhere it considers a college decision would lead to an incorrect application of EU \nlaw or not contribute to convergence in supervisory practices (Article 21(2)). As \ndiscussed in section 2.5, ESMA has the power to address decisions to supervisors \nwhere mediation fails (Article 19). The 2010 Omnibus Directive also revises the \nmain financial market measures to confer on ESMA a range of powers to support \nsupervision by colleges, including direct participation in joint investigations.72 \n                                                                                                                                               \n69  The ESMA FAQ highlights ESMA\u2019s \u2018important role\u2019 in colleges of supervisors (at p. 8). \n70  Directive 2009\/111\/EC, OJ 2009 L 302\/97. \n71  COM(2010) 579. \n72  E.g., Prospectus Directive (Omnibus Directive, Art. 5(10)) and MiFID (Omnibus Directive, \nArt. 6(22)). \n192 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \n2.2 Operational convergence and direct supervision \nBut it is where ESMA\u2019s powers move beyond coordination and into day-to-day \noperational matters that the real impact on local supervisory powers can be seen and \nwhere Member State safety valves in the form of operational supervisory discretion \nand decision-making are being closed. Although ESMA forms part of the ESFS, \nwhich includes the local competent authorities (Article 2) that are responsible for \nday-to-day supervision (recital 9), the extent of ESMA\u2019s powers raises the risk that \nlocal competent authorities may, in time, become technical functionaries of ESMA. \nESMA looks set to develop a best practice model for operational supervision. The \nDLG Report, for example, called for competent authorities\u2019 competences and powers \nto be aligned to the \u2018most comprehensive system in the EU\u2019,73 the European Council \ncalled for an upgrading of the quality and \u2018consistency\u2019 of national supervision,74 \nECOFIN charged the new Authorities with ensuring that \u2018consistent supervisory \npractices\u2019 are applied and with ensuring \u2018a common supervisory culture and \nconsistent supervisory practices\u2019,75 and the Commission\u2019s original proposal for the \n2010 ESMA Regulation called for it to take an active role in ensuring uniform \nprocedures and consistent supervisory practices. On the Parliament\u2019s September \n2010 vote to adopt the new structure, a combined statement from the Chairpersons of \nthe 3L3 committees noted their commitment to upgrade the quality and consistency \nof supervision.76 Similarly, Commission President Barroso highlighted that the new \nAuthorities would work with national supervisors \u2018to improve the day to day \noversight of individual firms\u2019.77 While an improvement in supervisory practices is a \nlaudable aim, the extent of ESMA\u2019s convergence powers (outlined in the following \nsections), combined with its direct supervisory powers, may lead to a loss of \ndiscretion, flexibility, innovation and experimentation in the supervisory system. \n2.3 Convergence: supervisory practices \nThe power to propose binding technical standards (BTSs) gives ESMA considerable \npotential to shape operational decision-making. Hitherto, EU rule-making has not \nclosely engaged with process, although elements of process-based harmonisation, \nfrom a firm-facing perspective, can be seen in MiFID\u2019s best execution regime and in \nthe proposed new regime for product governance in the MiFID Review. CESR was \nbeginning to promote convergence in supervisory decision-making through, for \nexample, its \u2018Accepted Market Practices\u2019 regime which governs how supervisors \n                                                                                                                                               \n73  Supra n. 6, at p. 49. \n74  European Council, Presidency Conclusions, 18-19 June 2009. \n75  2948th ECOFIN Meeting, June 2009. \n76  CESR, CEBS and CEIOPS, \u20183L3 Committees Welcome European Parliament Landmark \nVote to Reform Financial Supervision in Europe\u2019, 22 September 2010. \n77  Commission Press Release, MEMO\/10\/436, 22 September 2010. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 193\ndecide which practices can be deemed \u2018AMPs\u2019 and so exempt from the market abuse \nregime.78 Its efforts to promote convergence with respect to how issuers\u2019 financial \ninformation is reviewed were similarly concerned with supervisory decision-making \nand the use of risk-based techniques.79 The new generation of BTSs are likely to drill \nmuch deeper into supervisory practices. Many delegations to BTSs under the \nOmnibus Directive are concerned with supervisory coordination and information \nsharing.80 But many involve local supervisory decision-making. BTSs will be \nproduced, for example, on the detailed information which competent authorities \nshould require prior to investment firm authorisation and on when supervisors should \ndemand a supplementary prospectus under the prospectus regime.81 ESMA\u2019s ability \nto request information from local competent authorities will also strengthen its \nability to produce operational BTSs by enhancing its local knowledge. Competent \nauthorities are subject to extensive obligations to provide information to ESMA \nconcerning their practices,82 including with respect to all administrative measures and \nsanctions imposed.83 \nESMA\u2019s specific coordination powers are also likely to influence operational \ndecision-making and supervisory practices at national level. MiFID, for example, \nwill require that Member States, coordinated by ESMA, are to ensure that \nappropriate measures are in place to enable competent authorities to monitor the \nactivities of investment firms to ensure they act honestly, fairly and professionally \nand in a manner that promotes the integrity of the market (Omnibus Directive, \nArticle 6(9)). \nThere is also some evidence emerging that ESMA may have a more general \nability to shape supervisory practices with respect to the emerging \u2018crisis era\u2019 \nmeasures. The Short-Selling Proposal requires that ESMA be notified in advance \nwhere a competent authority plans to impose exceptional disclosure obligations on \nholders of short positions, restrict or prohibit short sales, or restrict credit default \n                                                                                                                                               \n78  CESR\/04-505. \n79  CESR, Standard No. 1 on Financial Information, supra n. 33. \n80  E.g., BTSs are to be adopted specifying the templates for information to be transferred in the \ncontext of home\/host notification of passporting firms under MiFID (Omnibus Directive, Art. \n6(12)). \n81  Omnibus Directive, Arts. 6(2) and 5(7). \n82  The information transmittal obligations are extensive. Under the Short-Selling Proposal \n(COM(2010) 482), e.g., ESMA must be notified of: the short-selling and credit default swap (CDS) \nnotifications made to competent authorities (Art. 11); prohibition decisions and other enforcement \nmeasures, before the decision is intended to take effect (Art. 22); and cooperation agreements with \nthird countries (Art. 32). The Prospectus Directive, e.g., will require, inter alia, that prospectus \napproval decisions and transfers of home authority approval powers are notified to ESMA \n(Omnibus Directive, Art. 5(5)). \n83  The Market Abuse Directive, e.g., will require that ESMA be provided with aggregated \ninformation concerning all administrative measures and sanctions imposed (Omnibus Directive, \nArt. 3(4)), as will MiFID (Omnibus Directive, Art. 6(18)). \n194 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nswap (CDS) transactions, in each case in accordance with the proposed new regime. \nESMA must issue an opinion (publicly disclosed) within 24 hours on whether it \nconsiders that adverse developments have arisen which constitute a serious threat to \nfinancial stability or market confidence, whether the measure is proportionate and \nappropriate, and whether its duration is justified (Articles 22 and 23). Where the \nauthority proposes to take action contrary to the ESMA opinion (or declines to take \nmeasures), it must publicly disclose its reasoning for doing so. Article 23 similarly \nrequires ESMA to facilitate and coordinate action by local competent authorities \nunder the Proposal and to ensure that a \u2018consistent approach\u2019 is adopted. ESMA is \nalso empowered to conduct enquiries into issues related to short-selling and CDSs \n(Article 28). In addition to its powers of direct intervention (section 2.9 below), \nESMA is accordingly placed at the centre of highly sensitive decisions by competent \nauthorities with respect to short-selling and is likely to have significant influence on \nhow the regime develops operationally. \nA similar effect may flow from the proposed 2011 AIFM Directive.84 The highly \nsensitive regime for alternative investment fund leverage includes a direction to \ncompetent authorities to impose leverage limits where necessary under the terms of \nthe Directive (Article 25). ESMA, however, must be notified before the limit is \nimposed and is to perform a facilitation and coordination role in order that a \nconsistent approach be adopted by competent authorities. ESMA must also issue \nadvice to the competent authority concerning the limits; where this advice is ignored, \nESMA may make public disclosure to this effect. The Directive also gives ESMA a \nsignificant role with respect to the supervision of non-EU alternative investment fund \nmanagers (AIFM). In particular, ESMA must advise on authorisation decisions \nconcerning non-EU AIFM and, where a competent authority proposes to authorise \ncontrary to ESMA\u2019s advice, this course of action must be publicly disclosed by \nESMA (Article 35d). \nESMA\u2019s potential influence on supervisory decision-making can also be seen from \nits insertion into cross-border inspections and investigations. The Short-Selling \nProposal, for example, requires that ESMA coordinate any investigation or inspection \nwith cross-border effects (Article 31), while the Prospectus Directive, following the \nOmnibus Directive reforms, will empower ESMA to participate in on-site inspections \ncarried out by two or more competent authorities (Article 5(10)). Similarly, its role in \ncolleges of supervisors is likely to increase its influence on supervisory practices. As \nnoted above, ESMA is to participate in the activities of colleges of supervisors (ESMA \nRegulation, Article 21). It is also being conferred with more specific powers in colleges \nof supervisors. The OTC Derivatives Proposal.85 gives ESMA a central role in the \n                                                                                                                                               \n84  T7-0393\/2010 (first Parliament reading, November 2010, based on the previously brokered \n\u2018political agreement\u2019), based on Commission Proposal COM(2010) 289.

Operational decision-making may be subject to further standardisation as \na result of the peer review mechanism, outlined in the next section. \n2.4 Convergence: peer review \nReflecting international trends post crisis and in particular the work of the Financial \nStability Board,86 ESMA is conferred with peer review powers. Under ESMA \nRegulation Article 30, ESMA is to engage in peer review of competent authorities\u2019 \nactivities to further strengthen consistency in supervisory outcomes. ESMA peer \nreview is also becoming a feature of EU financial market regulation more generally; \nthe proposed 2011 AIFM Directive grants ESMA a specific peer review function \nwith respect to how competent authorities supervise non-EU alternative investment \nfund managers (Article 35e). The 2010 Communication on sanctions similarly calls \non ESMA to include sanctioning powers as a priority area for review.87 \nESMA peer review is concerned with the \u2018capacity of supervisors to achieve high \nquality supervisory outcomes\u2019, including with respect to the adequacy of resources \nand governance arrangements, capacity to respond to market developments, degree \nof convergence in the application of EU law and in supervisory practices, and best \npractices (recital 41 and Article 30). Competent authorities are under an obligation to \n\u2018endeavour to follow\u2019 the outcomes. The results of the peer review may also be \ndisclosed publicly, subject to the agreement of the relevant authority. \nA peer review function appears relatively benign, but it may lead to undue \nstandardisation. The different supervisory styles, for example, employed by \nsupervisors are context dependent. The FSA\u2019s post-crisis Intensive Supervision \nmodel reflects, variously, relatively long experience with the risk-based ARROW \nmodel for supervision, the deterrent effect of a potential (now actual) FSA \nrestructuring in the wake of the crisis, and long struggles with achieving effective \n\u2018law in action\u2019 in the retail markets given an array of mis-selling scandals. As \napplied in the retail markets, it reflects a change in the FSA\u2019s tolerance of the amount \nof detriment which consumers can be expected to bear,88 as well as a sharper focus \non the retail markets generally, with the proposed Financial Conduct Authority being \ndesignated a \u2018consumer champion\u2019.89 Transplantation of this model would be neither \n                                                                                                                                               \n86  Supra n. 42. \n87  COM(2010) 716, at p. 16. \n88  See, e.g. FSA, supra n. 28, at pp. 20-21. \n89  HM Treasury, supra n. 54, at p. 60. \n196 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \ndesirable nor possible, not least given the different priorities which different \nsupervisors attach to different market segments and the different approaches they can \ntake to the degree of risk and failure they are prepared to tolerate.90 Similarly, risk-\nbased supervision.91 is common across Member State supervisors,92 with the FSA93 \nand the Dutch prudential regulator.94 being well-known exponents of this model. But \nrisk-based supervision requires the supervisor to make sensitive decisions as to the \nlevel of failure it is prepared to tolerate; ESMA intervention to this effect could be \ntroublesome, not least as fiscal risk-bearing remains at national level. \nSimilar concerns arise with respect to resourcing. It is clear from recent annual \nreports of the EU\u2019s major supervisors that resources are being increased; the French \nAMF (along with CONSOB.95 and BaFIN.96) is recruiting more and specialised staff,97 \nwhile FSA resources have been significantly increased.98 But it is happening to \nvarying extents, in different ways, and reflecting how supervisors, in distinct market \nand political contexts, have reacted to the crisis. The recent increase in the FSA\u2019s \nstaffing, for example, is related in part to the demands of its Intensive Supervision \nmodel.99 Internal organisational dynamics are also key to effective resourcing; the \nFSA\u2019s 2010-2011 Business Plan underlined the need for it to embed the \norganisational and cultural change needed to implement Intensive Supervision and to \ndevelop a more responsive, decentralised decision-making structure.100 Institutional \ndesign and the related institutional culture similarly play a very large role in the \neffective deployment of resources; no single model prevails across the EU. Simple \nincreases in staff numbers alone will also achieve little where staff are poorly \n                                                                                                                                               \n90  At an early stage, CESR noted divergences across the national competent authorities with \nrespect to the purposes of financial market regulation: Himalaya Report, supra n. 15. \n91  E.g., supra n. 8. \n92  CESR\/08-220, at pp. 7-8 (in the context of the MiFID mapping exercise and reporting that \n19 supervisors adopt some form of risk-based supervision).

The Annual Report for 2009-2010 reported that 537 staff had been added to \nsupervisory and specialist units: at p. 11. \n99  \u2018This proactive approach to supervision requires significantly more people than the old \nreactive model and those individuals must be of a higher quality and supported by more \nsophisticated systems. If society wants a more proactive approach it must accept that it will have a \nlarger and more expensive regulator\u2019: FSA Chief Executive Sants, commenting on the 2010-2011 \nBusiness Plan. \n100  FSA, Business Plan 2010-2011, at p. 11. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 197\nqualified and have few positive incentives.101 The range of difficult issues which \noptimum resourcing generates suggests that peer review in this area will demand \nconsiderable sensitivity to local supervisory contexts. \nVery large questions also arise as to how the outcomes against which peer review \ntakes places are set in an environment characterised by diverging market profiles, \ndifferent national priorities, and potential tensions between competent authorities, the \nESAs and the ESRB, particularly given the failure to identify any of the governing \nprinciples of EU financial market law.102 (although ESMA\u2019s list of objectives \nrepresents an improvement in this regard (ESMA Regulation, Article 1(5))). \nCompetent authorities are subject to a range of similar, but subtly varying, \nsupervisory mandates which shape outcomes.103 The FSA\u2019s statutory objectives, for \nexample, have shaped the UK regulatory environment while broader goals, including \nwith respect to redistribution, have influenced the development of the US system.104 \nHow is peer review best conducted with differing supervisory mandates, given the \nimpact different objectives can have on supervisory approaches? Will it, for \nexample, be legitimate for competent authorities to prioritise certain market \nsegments, reflecting local market conditions, including variations in the strength of \nmarket discipline?

It empowers ESMA to undertake investigations, make recommend-\nations and ultimately address decisions to market actors, subject to strict time limits. \nAs interpreted by ESMA, the new procedure \u2018is intended to place the national \ncompetent authority under considerable pressure more quickly\u2019.110 ESMA is first \nempowered to investigate alleged breaches of EU law by a competent authority (on \nits own initiative or following a request by a national authority, the Parliament, \nCommission, Council or its stakeholder group). Not less than two months after \ninitiating the investigation, ESMA may issue a \u2018recommendation\u2019 to the authority, \nsetting out the remedial steps necessary. Where the authority does not comply within \na month of the recommendation (it should inform ESMA of the steps it is to take \nwithin ten days of receipt), the Commission (on its own initiative or after notification \nby ESMA) may issue a formal opinion (within three months of the ESMA \nrecommendation), taking into account ESMA\u2019s recommendation, requiring the \nauthority to take the necessary remedial action. Within ten days of receipt of the \nopinion, the authority must inform the Commission and ESMA of the steps it has \n                                                                                                                                               \n108  Speech by FATF President Vlaanderen on \u2018The Challenge of Compliance with the FATF \nStandards\u2019, 3 June 2010, available via: <http:\/\/www.fatf-gafi.org\/pages\/0,3417,en_32250379_3223 \n6879_1_1_1_1_1,00.html>. \n109  Reviews of the UCITS passporting regime (CESR\/09-1034) and CESR\u2019s Standards \nNumbers 1 and 2 on financial information (CESR\/09-374, CESR\/09-188 and CESR\/09-212) were \ndisheartening. The UCITS peer review, e.g., revealed low levels of compliance, with only 5 \nMember States fully applying the guidelines and 20 Member States not applying at least 1. \nPrevious CESR Chairman Wymeersch (in a personal capacity) described the outcomes of the peer \nreview as \u2018often appalling\u2019: supra n. 1, at p. 248. \n110  ESMA FAQ, at p. 5. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 199\ntaken. Where the authority does not comply with the formal opinion, ESMA may \naddress a decision to a financial market participant, as outlined in section 2.6 below. \nArticle 18 governs ESMA\u2019s controversial emergency powers. These powers are \ntriggered where the Council determines that an \u2018emergency situation\u2019111 exists, and \nwhen exceptional circumstances arise such that coordinated action by national \nauthorities is necessary to respond to adverse developments which threaten the \norderly functioning and integrity of markets or financial market stability. ESMA is \nnot, however, granted the wide-ranging powers which this context might suggest. \nLike the Article 17 enforcement power,112 it is confined in that ESMA may only \nadopt individual decisions requiring competent authorities to take the necessary \naction in accordance with ESMA-scope legislation to address the situation by \nensuring that financial market participants and competent authorities comply with the \nrelevant legislation. \nArticle 19 empowers ESMA to impose decisions on competent authorities in \ncases of disagreement and represents a considerable step up from CESR\u2019s soft \nmediation powers; ESMA has highlighted the difference between CESR\u2019s mediation \npowers and its new powers to \u2018settle sectoral disputes\u2019.113 In the cases specified in the \nOmnibus Directive,114 and where disagreement arises between authorities, ESMA \nmay, on its own initiative or at the parties\u2019 request, facilitate a mediation process. \nWhere the authorities fail to reach an agreement, ESMA may take a decision \nrequiring them to take specific action or to refrain from action.115 This regime is \nconstrained: mediation power must be given to ESMA in the relevant delegating \nmeasure or the competent authorities must request ESMA\u2019s assistance (Article 19); \nparticular voting rules apply to ESMA decision-making (Article 44); and the \ndecision must be proposed by an independent ESMA panel (Article 41). \nIn principle, it is hard to argue against powers which may, finally, deal with the \nlong-running problem of poor implementation of EU law (Article 17), allow for \nmore coordinated action in a crisis (Article 18) and break through supervisory \ndeadlock (Article 19). It is also the case that these powers relate to exceptional \ncircumstances, are restricted in their terms and contain interinstitutional oversight \n                                                                                                                                               \n111  In consultation with the Commission, the ESRB and, where appropriate, the ESAs, and \nfollowing a request by an ESA, the Commission or the ESRB. \n112  Although this procedure is not tied to a Commission opinion: Ferran, supra n. 1, at p. 52. \n113  ESMA FAQ, at p. 6. \n114  E.g., under the Market Abuse Directive, Art. 19 will apply where requests for information, \nto open an inquiry, or for its officials to take part in on-site inspection by a competent authority are \nrefused (Omnibus Directive, Art. 3(6)). Under the Prospectus Directive, it will apply where \ninformation requests are refused (Omnibus Directive, Art. 5(11)). Art. 19 applies to a range of \nsituations under MiFID, including with respect to information and inspection requests and the \napplication of precautionary powers (Omnibus Directive, Art. 6(24)). \n115  A discrete voting regime applies to this procedure under Art. 44; Arts. 17 and 18 are subject \nto a simple majority vote. \n200 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nmechanisms.116 While Article 18 seems to grant ESMA extensive powers, ESMA\u2019s \npowers are restricted as noted above and Article 18 forms part of a larger super-\nstructure which has been put in place post crisis to prevent and contain crisis. Its \npractical significance may be limited. Article 17 provides a solution to the long-\nstanding problem of non-compliance by significantly strengthening the reputational \ndynamics which characterised CESR\u2019s peer review activities. Article 19 activates in \nthe context of inter-authority mediation. Mediation between supervisors will often \nrelate to operational questions where there is genuine uncertainty as to the \ninterpretation of a rule or standard, or uncertainty as to supervisory jurisdiction. In \nthese circumstances, ESMA intervention may be efficient and may also allow \nnational competent authorities to achieve practical solutions without reputational \ndamage. There are also a number of braking influences which will apply, in addition \nto the formal restrictions placed on these powers. The legal uncertainties are \nconsiderable, and ESMA may be reluctant to test the robustness of these powers, \nabsent powerful cause (section 3.2). ESMA also has strong incentives to maintain \ngood relations with its constituent members (section 3.1), which may temper \noverenthusiastic wielding of these powers. Articles 18 and 19 are also subject to the \nArticle 38 fiscal safeguards clause (section 2.9). \nUltimately, despite the prominence they had over the negotiations, these powers \nmay not prove, in practice, to be overly troublesome and may prove useful. Much \ndepends, however, on ESMA\u2019s competence, which remains problematic as discussed \nin section 3. These powers may also have a chilling effect on the exercise of local \nsupervisory discretion, as discussed in the following section. \n2.6 Direct supervision: the ESMA Regulation and supervision of \nmarket participants \nIn a \u2018boundary-stepping\u2019117 change to the CESR model, ESMA is empowered to \naddress decisions to financial market participants under Articles 17-19, subject to a \nseries of conditions. \nUnder Article 17, where a competent authority does not comply with the \nCommission\u2019s formal opinion and where timely remedying of the non-compliance is \nnecessary to maintain or restore neutral conditions of competition or ensure the \norderly functioning and integrity of the financial system, ESMA may address a \ndecision to a financial market participant, requiring the action necessary to comply \nwith its obligations under EU law; the relevant EU measures must, however, be \ndirectly applicable. This regime allows ESMA to bypass the considerable difficulties \n                                                                                                                                               \n116  ESMA\u2019s Art. 17 powers, e.g., reflect the constitutional pre-eminence of the Commission \nwith respect to enforcement. Any ESMA action after the initial recommendation to the non-\ncompliant competent authority is dependent on a Commission \u2018formal opinion\u2019 being issued. The \nArt. 18 regime depends, e.g., on the declaration of an emergency by the Council. \n117  Ferran, supra n. 1, at p. 49. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 201\nraised where a competent authority ignores ESMA decisions addressed to it. \nAlthough a peer pressure mechanism is available (under Article 17(8), non-\ncompliance with ESMA decisions or Commission opinions must be reported in \nESMA\u2019s annual report to the institutions), it is unlikely to be effective in a situation \nwhere a competent authority is in open defiance of ESMA. Formal enforcement \npowers lie with the Commission under Article 258 TFEU (against the relevant \nMember State), but this cumbersome procedure is ill-equipped to deal with fast-\nmoving financial markets and related difficulties arising with the application of EU \nlaw. \nA similar regime applies under Article 18 where a competent authority does not \ncomply with an Article 18 ESMA decision. The rule to which the ESMA decision \nrelates must be directly applicable, it must be the case that the authority has not \napplied the rule or has applied it in a manner which appears to be a manifest breach, \nand urgent remedying must be necessary for orderly market functioning and integrity \nor financial system stability. Under Article 19, where an authority does not comply \nwith an ESMA mediation decision and thereby fails to ensure that a financial market \nparticipant complies with directly applicable ESMA-scope rules, ESMA may adopt \nan individual decision addressed to a financial market participant, requiring the \naction necessary to comply with its EU law obligations. \nReflecting these powers, and the legal models established for earlier EU agencies \nwith decision-making powers,118 the ESMA Regulation establishes a review system \nto protect third-party interests. Addressees of a decision must be informed of \nESMA\u2019s intention to adopt a decision and given an opportunity to respond; decisions \nmust also be reasoned (and, absent exceptional circumstances, made public), \naddressees must be informed of their legal remedies under the Regulation and \ndecisions must be reviewed at appropriate intervals (Article 39). Decisions can be \nappealed (by addressees and by those directly and individually concerned by the \ndecision) to the independent ESA Board of Appeal (Article 60)119 and to the Court of \nJustice under Article 263 TEU (Article 61). Subsequent measures, notably the \nproposed 2011 Credit Rating Agency (CRA) Regulation,120 have reinforced third-\nparty rights with respect to specific ESMA powers. The CRA Regulation requires, \nfor example, that ESMA highlight the ability of persons to appeal monetary penalties \nimposed by ESMA and provide hearings prior to taking enforcement action and\/or \nimposing monetary penalties. \n                                                                                                                                               \n118  D.

CESR had taken only very \ntentative steps in the direction of direct supervision of financial market participants, \nmost notably perhaps with respect to the agreement between CESR members that \nCESR would approve waivers for MiFID\u2019s equity market transparency \nrequirements.121 Internationally, there are few templates; international standard-\nsetters do, on occasion, speak directly to market participants (the IOSCO Code on \nRating Agencies, for example, is directed to the industry) but direct market \nintervention sits uneasily within the inter-authority, consensus-based model which \ncharacterises these bodies.122 \nAs with ESMA\u2019s powers to address decisions to competent authorities, these \npowers over financial market participants are activated in unusual circumstances and \nare generally concerned with escalating circumstances, whether emergency-driven or \nwhere relations between competent authorities, and between ESMA and competent \nauthorities, have broken down to a very significant degree. Their practical impact \nmay also be moderated by the legal certainty risks attendant on these powers, \nESMA\u2019s need to maintain good relations with competent authorities, and resource \nlimitations (section 3 below). The opacity of the powers may also cause difficulties. \nIt is not clear, for example, what follows where a competent authority defies an \nESMA Article 18 or 19 decision or Article 17 recommendation, thereby exposing a \nfinancial market participant to local enforcement action or retaliation where it \ncomplies with a related ESMA decision addressed to it.123 The Regulation provides \nthat ESMA decisions under Articles 17-19 prevail over previous decisions by \ncompetent authorities on the same matter, but a financial market participant may be \nplaced in an invidious position in the admittedly highly unusual situation where its \ncompetent authority is in open conflict with ESMA. These uncertainties may, \nhowever, lead ESMA to be circumspect in using these powers indiscriminately. \nAssuming ESMA\u2019s competence (section 3 below), the greatest risks from the \nArticles 17-19 powers may lie in their potentially chilling effects on market and \ncompetent authority challenge, and in their related potential to lead to a general \n\u2018hardening\u2019 of ESMA\u2019s ability to shape supervisory practices. Given the complex \ndynamics which are likely to characterise relationships between ESMA and its \nconstituent competent authorities (section 3 below), authorities may have strong \nincentives to support ESMA even if the immediate outcome is a loss of supervisory \npower. Market actors may accordingly find it politic not to challenge ESMA in the \nearly formative stages. This is all the more likely given ESMA\u2019s potential to be \nalmost omnipresent in major supervisory decisions (should it choose to, and where \n                                                                                                                                               \n121  Infra n. 146. \n122  Brummer, supra n. 13, at pp. 281-282. \n123  See also Financial Markets Law Committee, infra n. 191, at pp. 14-15, noting that political \ncircumstances may lead to non-compliance by competent authorities with EU law and to competent \nauthority action to incentivise the market participant to act in breach of the ESA decision. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 203\nresource constraints and the need to preserve good relations with national competent \nauthorities permit) and the extent to which it will be in receipt of information from \ncompetent authorities. In the competition field, from which ESMA\u2019s powers over \nmarkets actors are drawn, the Commission has suggested that its related powers to \nintervene in national proceedings under the European Competition Network, which \nhave not been used, have served \u2018to impose discipline on the system\u2019.124 \nThe hardening effect will be all the more intense as ESMA, through a range of \ninformation-related powers, may become close to individual market actors. Under \nthe prospectus regime, for example, it will publish lists of approved prospectuses \n(Omnibus Directive, Article 5(6)), be empowered to inform home competent \nauthorities of the need for a supplementary prospectus (Article 17(8)), and be \nnotified where a host Member State finds that irregularities have occurred under the \nProspectus Directive (Article 5(12)). Similarly, under MiFID, ESMA is to maintain a \nregister of authorised investment firms which will record withdrawals of \nauthorisation and sanctions (Omnibus Directive, Articles 6(1) and (3) and 18); a \nsimilar ESMA register is also envisaged under the proposed 2011 AIFM Directive \n(Article 5(5)). \n2.7 Direct supervision: the ESMA Regulation and product prohibition \nSpecific powers are also conferred on ESMA with respect to the prohibition of \nproducts and services. Under Article 9(3), ESMA may issue warnings where a \nfinancial activity poses a serious threat to its Article 1(5) objectives. ESMA may also \ntemporarily prohibit or restrict certain financial activities that threaten the orderly \nfunctioning of financial markets or the stability of the whole or part of the financial \nsystem in the Union; this power applies to particular cases specified in EU law and \nalso, if required, in Article 18 emergency situations (Article 9(5)). \nAlthough the Article 9(5) prohibition power was originally conceived as a means \nof addressing short-selling (section 2.9 below), the potential for activist ESMA \nintervention is considerable \u2013 assuming it is given the requisite powers under the \nrelevant legislative measure. The potential in the retail markets, in particular, is \nsignificant given the persistent difficulties generated by product sales in the EU and \nweaknesses in distribution-related regulation.125 and some enthusiasm, notably from \nthe European Parliament which championed the addition of Article 9 (it confers \ngeneral retail market powers on ESMA126) but also from the Commission,127 for \ncloser intervention in the retail product markets. But it is doubtful whether ESMA is \nsuitably equipped to prohibit products. Product regulation is notoriously complex, \n                                                                                                                                               \n124  E.g., House of Commons, Commission Written Evidence, infra n. 158. \n125  Moloney, supra n. 51, ch. 4. \n126  ECON Legislative Report, February 2010 (Giegold Report) (PE.438.409 and A7-0169\/ \n2010) and Parliament Partial First Reading, July 2010 (T7-0270\/2010). \n127  Infra section 3.2. \n204 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nwith considerable difficulties arising with respect to moral hazard and innovation \nrisks in particular. The EU product market is highly fragmented, with product design \ntypically reflecting long-standing retail market demand patterns in particular \nmarkets.128 It is difficult to see what efficiencies an ESMA power to prohibit would \nbring, given ESMA\u2019s distance from local retail markets and its inexperience as a \ndirect market supervisor. The potential costs are significant in terms of reputational \ndamage to the local supervisor, market uncertainty and the \u2018chilling\u2019 effect which a \nbroadly cast ESMA power to prohibit might generate. Careful coordination with \nEBA and EIOPA would also be required through the Joint Committee of Supervisors \n(section 3.1 below), given that retail market products, as the popularity of unit-linked \ninsurance and structured deposits attests, do not sit neatly in particular supervisory \nsilos. The risks may be more potential than real, as it is hard to envisage the \ncircumstances in which the marketing of a retail product would have the systemic \nimplications on which the application of Article 9 is dependent. Nonetheless, the \nArticle 9(5) prohibition power may be a hostage to fortune, particularly given recent \nevidence that ESMA may take a keen interest in the retail markets (section 3.1 \nbelow). Recent statements by ESMA\u2019s newly appointed Chairman suggest that \nESMA would be willing to take action against high-commission products where \nnegative outcomes for investors are likely.129 \n2.8 Direct supervision: the credit rating agency template \nThe Articles 17-19 and 9 powers are default and exceptional powers. But with the \nproposed 2011 CRA Regulation, a direct transfer of more workaday supervisory and \nenforcement competence from the Member States will take place. There are particular \nspecificities to rating agencies. They represent a small (if influential) section of the \nfinancial market, they have extensive cross-border reach (some rating agencies have up \nto 14 supervisors in their colleges.130), the impact of ratings extends beyond territorial \nboundaries and they do not generate material fiscal risks for the Member States, \nmaking the transfer of supervisory power a less risky proposition. Nonetheless, the \n                                                                                                                                               \n128  E.g., BME Consulting, The EU Market for Consumer Long-Term Retail Savings Vehicles. \nComparative Analysis of Products, Market Structure, Costs, Distribution Systems, and Consumer \nSavings Patterns (2007). \n129  N.

The proposed regime for \nESMA\u2019s supervision of trade repositories under the OTC Derivatives Proposal (section \n2.9 below), notably, is modelled on the 2011 Regulation. \nThe 2011 Regulation is based on a power-sharing arrangement, with power \nshared between ESMA, the Commission and local competent authorities, although \nbudgetary provision has been made to increase ESMA resources.131 First, ESMA will \nhave exclusive competence over the registration and supervision of rating agencies \n(Articles 15 and 16) and to charge registration fees (Article 19); ESMA\u2019s central role \nis underlined by the prohibition placed on it from interfering with the content of \nratings or methodologies (Article 23). Member States\u2019 \u2018sectoral competent authori-\nties\u2019 will, however, retain responsibility for the supervision of the use of ratings \n(Article 25a). \nSecond, ESMA is dependent on the Commission operationally in certain key \nrespects. Its fee-charging powers, for example, will operate within Commission \nparameters (Article 19), and ESMA must adopt technical standards, which are \nsubject to Commission oversight, concerning the registration process (Article 21). \nThird, the competent authorities will be ESMA\u2019s operational arms for direct \nsupervision. ESMA may, where it is necessary for the proper performance of a \nsupervisory task, delegate \u2018specific supervisory tasks\u2019 (including investigations and \non-site inspections) to local competent authorities; local authorities are required to \naccede to ESMA\u2019s requests, although prior consultation must take place between \nESMA and the authority (Article 30). Delegation may not, however, be of such a \nscale as to dilute ESMA\u2019s authority;132 supervisory responsibilities, including with \nrespect to registration decisions, final assessments, and follow-up decisions \nconcerning infringements, must not be delegated. Similarly, competent authorities \u2013 \nsubject to a general cooperation and information exchange obligation (Articles 26 \nand 27) \u2013 must notify ESMA where they are convinced that breaches of the \nRegulation have been committed in their territory or in another Member State \n(Article 31). ESMA is to take \u2018appropriate action\u2019 in response, but is not required to \nfollow the authorities\u2019 requests. Competent authorities may also request ESMA to \nexamine whether the conditions for withdrawal of registration are met (Article \n20(2)). Similarly, competent authorities notifying ESMA under Article 31 may \nrequest that ESMA suspend the use of ratings for regulatory purposes in exceptional \ncircumstances.133 ESMA is not required to follow these requests; under Article 31, it \n                                                                                                                                               \n131  A \u20ac2.5 million increase in ESMA\u2019s budget for 2011 was envisaged: ibid., at p. 33. \n132  Delegation is envisaged where a supervisory task requires knowledge and experience \nconcerning local conditions which are more easily available at national level (rec. 13). \n133  The infringements must be sufficiently serious and persistent to have a significant impact \non the protection of investors or the stability of the financial system in the Member State of the \ncompetent authority in question. \n206 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nmust take \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 to resolve the issue or inform the authority, setting \nout its reasons, where it considers the request is not justified and Article 20 requires \nthat full reasons be provided where the registration is not withdrawn. Some care has \nalso been taken to establish ESMA\u2019s pre-eminence in on-site inspections (Article \n23c): local officials must, for example, \u2018actively assist\u2019 officials and other persons \nauthorised by ESMA, and local enforcement assistance must be made available to \nESMA where necessary. A detailed regime also applies to the respective roles of \nESMA and the competent authority in on-site inspections (Article 23c). The role of \nlocal courts has also been carefully delineated. Where authorisation from a local \njudicial authority is required to, for example, compel telephone and data traffic, the \nnational court is to check that the ESMA decision is authentic and that any related \ncoercive measures envisaged are not arbitrary or excessive. But while the national \ncourt may request an explanation from ESMA as to its grounds for suspecting an \ninfringement of the Regulation and the seriousness of the infringement, the court \nmay not review the necessity of the investigation or require that it be provided with \ninformation on ESMA\u2019s files. Review of the lawfulness of ESMA\u2019s decision is \nreserved to the Court of Justice (Article 23b). A similar regime applies where \nenforcement assistance in the context of on-site inspection requires judicial \nauthorisation (Article 23c). While the supervisory model therefore depends on \nESMA operating through local supervisors, some care has been taken to protect \nESMA\u2019s pre-eminence. \nESMA\u2019s supervisory powers are extensive, including the power to examine and \ntake copies of any relevant records or material, ask for oral explanations, summon \nand hear persons, require telephone and data traffic records, and interview persons \n(Article 23b). The European Parliament\u2019s ECON Committee originally conferred \nESMA with the power to engage in random sampling of ratings to check rating \nquality.134 While during the institutional trilogue negotiations this power was \ndowngraded to a power to examine rating agencies\u2019 compliance with their obligation \nto back-test methodologies (Article 22a), it nonetheless points to ESMA\u2019s potential \nfor direct supervisory action. ESMA is also empowered to take a range of \nenforcement actions directly, including withdrawal of registration, temporary \nprohibitions on issuing ratings, suspension of the use of ratings for regulatory \npurposes, and issuance of public notices (Article 24). It is also, as discussed in \nsection 3 below, conferred with fining powers (Article 36a). Although recital 15e \navers that the Regulation is not to create a precedent for the imposition of financial \nsanctions by the ESAs on financial market participants in relation to other activities, \nthe precedent has been established. In a borrowing from the competition sphere,135 a \nperiodic penalty may also be imposed in order to compel an end to an infringement, \n                                                                                                                                               \n134  ECON Legislative Report, November 2010 (Gauz\u00e8s Report) (PE 448.995 and A7\/340-\n2010). \n135  Council Regulation (EC) No 1\/2003, OJ 2003 L 1\/1. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 207\ninformation to be supplied, submission to an investigation, or submission to an on-\nsite inspection (Article 36b). \nOf particular importance is the Regulation\u2019s delineation of how enforcement \nproceedings will be carried out. The ESMA Regulation does not specify how ESMA \ndecisions addressed to market participants are to be enforced in national courts. \nESMA has legal personality and enjoys \u2018the most extensive legal capacity accorded \nto legal persons under national law\u2019 and can be a party to legal proceedings (Article \n5). But limited guidance is given on how enforcement might proceed; notably, the \nEuropean Parliament addition in its July 2010 position on the ESMA Regulation of a \nrecital reference to ESMA decisions creating direct legal effects and being invoked \nbefore national courts.136 was removed. On general principles, the Treaty loyalty \nobligation (Article 4(3) TEU) suggests that national courts should accept ESMA as a \nparty to any subsequent enforcement proceedings, although Treaty difficulties may \narise given that the Commission exercises direct enforcement powers under the \nTreaty as regards breaches of EU law, as the guardian of EU law with respect to the \nMember States.137 There is precedent for EU institutions acting as parties in national \ncourts; in a recent UK case,138 the Commission appeared as defendant to an action \nconcerning the enforcement of a Commission fine related to the competition \nregime.139 The 2011 CRA Regulation, however, provides that administrative \nsanctioning powers can all be directly exercised by ESMA (for example, relevant \npersons are required to submit to ESMA investigations (Article 23b)), subject to the \ngeneral review and appeal regime which applies under the ESMA Regulation. It also \nspecifies that fines and periodic penalties are to be enforceable and that enforcement \nis to be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in the Member State in the \nterritory of which enforcement is carried out, once the authenticity of the ESMA \ndecision has been verified by the local authority so designated by the Member State \n(Article 36d). In the case of potential criminal prosecutions, ESMA is to refer \nmatters for prosecution to the relevant national authorities where it finds that there \nare serious indications of the possible existence of facts liable to constitute criminal \noffences (Article 23d). \nESMA\u2019s powers over rating agencies are extensive, but they are confined to a \nsmall sector of the capital markets. The wider significance of the Regulation lies in \nits establishment of a template for future grants of direct operational power and in the \nrelative speed and ease with which the EU institutions were able to design this \ntemplate. \n                                                                                                                                               \n136  Supra n. 126, rec. 19. \n137  The Commission\u2019s 2008 report on agencies, e.g., argued that agencies could not be \nentrusted with powers which had been conferred on the Commission by the Treaty: The European \nAgencies \u2013 The Way Forward (2008) (COM(2008) 135). \n138  Conex Banninger Limited v.

The change from CESR\u2019s power is stark; CESR was able only to disclose, \nand to a certain extent coordinate, Member State action.144 \nUnder the proposed 2011 AIFM Directive, ESMA will be empowered to \ndetermine that fund leverage levels pose a significant risk to the stability and \nintegrity of the financial system and to advise competent authorities to take remedial \naction, including with respect to leverage limits (Article 25). In an \u2018emergency \nsituation\u2019 under ESMA Regulation Article 18, ESMA is also empowered to require \ncompetent authorities to take nominated measures, including that restrictions are \n                                                                                                                                               \n140  E.g., DLG Report, supra n. 6, at p. 53. \n141  Giegold Report, supra n. 126, Amendment 76. \n142  E.g., Short-Selling Proposal, supra n. 82, at p. 5, and European Securities Committee, \nMinutes 21 June 2010, noting the \u2018political priority and urgency of the issue\u2019. \n143  ESMA action must address a threat to the functioning, integrity or stability of the market, \ncross-border implications must arise, and the competent authority(ies) must have failed to take \naction (Art. 24(2)). ESMA must also take into account the extent to which the measure will \nsignificantly address the threat, improve the ability of competent authorities to monitor the threat, \nnot create a risk of regulatory arbitrage, and not have detrimental effects on the market, including \nwith respect to liquidity and uncertainty. Notification (to competent authorities), consultation (with \nthe ESRB and relevant authorities) and review obligations are also imposed (Art. 24(3)-(9)). \n144  CESR, Annual Report 2009, at p. 40. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 209\nimposed on non-EU alternative investment fund managers in cases of excessive risk \nconcentrations. Like the short-selling power, this power is confined: a substantial \nthreat to the market must exist, originating from or aggravated by the AIFM, and \nlocal competent authorities must either have failed to act or have taken ineffective \nmeasures; and the measures must effectively address the relevant threat, not create a \nrisk of regulatory arbitrage and not have a detrimental effect on financial markets, \nincluding with respect to liquidity (Article 42a). \nThe OTC Derivatives Proposal contains significant grants of power to ESMA. \nUnder a model similar to the rating agency model, ESMA will register and supervise \ntrade repositories (Article 51). It will also play a central role in moving all \nstandardised OTC derivatives to CCPs, in line with G20 obligations; once a \ncompetent authority has authorised a CCP to clear certain contracts, ESMA will be \nempowered to decide whether a CCP clearing obligation should apply to all of those \ncontracts in the EU. ESMA will also be empowered (with the ESRB) to decide \nwhich contracts should potentially be subject to the CCP clearing requirement \n(Article 4).145 While authorisation and supervision responsibilities remain at Member \nState level, ESMA will participate in the colleges of competent authorities which \nwill coordinate the authorisation and supervision of CCPs (Article 15). In this \ncapacity, it will have the power to request the home Member State to examine a \nCCP\u2019s compliance with the new regime. \nA notable feature of the new generation of measures is the extent to which they \nconfer powers on ESMA not only with respect to third-country supervisory \ncoordination arrangements but also in regard to the registration and supervision of \nthird-country actors. The proposed 2011 CRA Regulation will empower ESMA to \nmake endorsement and certification decisions with respect to the use of ratings by \nthird-country rating agencies (Articles 4 and 5). Under the Short-Selling Proposal, \nESMA is to coordinate competent authority agreements with third countries (Short-\nSelling Proposal, Article 32). The OTC Derivatives Proposal confers ESMA with the \npower to recognise third-country CCPs, subject to conditions, and to recognise third-\ncountry trade repositories (Articles 23 and 24). \nThe MiFID Review has followed this trend. CESR, by voluntary agreement with \nits members, had acquired a role in reviewing the use of pre-trade transparency \nwaivers by its members.146 The MiFID Review proposes that this role be formalised. \nCompetent authorities would be required to notify ESMA of their intended use of a \npre-trade transparency waiver, ESMA would be required to publish an opinion on its \nuse and, where the authority proposed to use a waiver contrary to an ESMA opinion, \nit would be required to justify its action publicly.147 \n                                                                                                                                               \n145  The MiFID Review also foresees ESMA\u2019s ability to decide whether a derivative should be \napproved for trading on different categories of organised market: MiFID Review, at p. 13. \n146  CESR Annual Report 2009, at p. 52, and CESR\/09-324. \n147  MiFID Review, at p. 23. This represents a significant change from the current position. On \noccasion, CESR has not been able to reach the qualified majority necessary to adopt a common \nposition on waivers: CESR\/09-324. \n210 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nThe speed with which ESMA has become a vehicle for institutional interests, \nparticularly the Parliament\u2019s and Commission\u2019s, in centralising supervision is \nremarkable.148 The CESR experience also teaches that the acquisition of supervisory \npowers can be dynamic. CESR did not have formal supervisory powers. Nonetheless, \ntowards the end of its era, it had begun to press on the boundaries of its formal \ncompetences, engaging, for example, in a review of financial disclosures by financial \ninstitutions,149 taking decisions on the waivers issued with respect to transparency \nrequirements under MiFID, and, under a voluntary agreement with leading rating \nagencies, reviewing their compliance with the IOSCO Code.150 It may also be the \ncase that ESMA will prove to be a useful device for resolving politically sensitive \nquestions as well. ESMA\u2019s role under the proposed AIFM Directive with respect to \nthird-country fund managers, for example, facilitated the adoption of the complex \nregime which applies to this controversial question.151 \nBut ESMA has no experience as an operational supervisor and, as outlined in \nsection 1 above, operational supervision is a difficult business. Direct supervision by \nESMA is all the more difficult given the structural and other constraints under which \nESMA operates, as discussed in section 3. \n2.9.2 But a fiscal brake in place \nAs long as fiscal risk-bearing remains at Member State level, there are significant \npolitical limits on the extent to which direct operational power can be conferred on \nESMA. \nThe European Parliament\u2019s efforts to confer ESMA with direct supervisory \npowers over systemically significant cross-border actors, including with respect to a \nproposed ESMA \u2018Resolution Unit\u2019, foundered over significant ECOFIN concern as \nto the asymmetric nature of fiscal risk-bearing were ESMA to exercise supervisory \npowers of this nature.152 ECOFIN\u2019s July 2010 position accordingly downgraded \nESMA\u2019s role to a monitoring and coordinating one with respect to systemic risk; this \nmodel was reflected in the 2010 Regulation (Articles 22-27). Similarly, the \nCommission\u2019s initial suggestion in the ESMA Proposal that ESMA be conferred \nwith \u2018exclusive supervisory powers\u2019 over entities with EU-wide reach or economic \n                                                                                                                                               \n148  The Commission\u2019s FAQ on the proposed 2011 AIFM Directive, e.g., asserted that it \u2018makes \nfull use of the opportunities afforded by the recent reform of Europe\u2019s supervisory architecture\u2019: \nMEMO\/10\/572, 11 November 2010. \n149  CESR\/09-821 and CESR\/10-1183. \n150  E.g., CESR\/09-417 (reviewing compliance with the revised 2008 Code). \n151  See further, E. Ferran, \u2018The Regulation of Hedge Funds and Private Equity: A Case Study \nin the Development of the EU\u2019s Regulatory Response to the Financial Crisis\u2019 (2011), available at: \n<http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=1762119>. \n152  July 2010 Partial Reading, supra n. 126, Arts. 6(1)(fc) and 12a(5) and c. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 211\nactivities with Union-wide reach was removed by ECOFIN in its December 2009 \npolitical agreement, which limited this power to rating agencies.153 \nThe sensitivity of Member States to bearing the fiscal consequences of ESMA \naction is reflected in Article 38. It provides that where a Member State considers that \nan Article 19 mediation decision \u2018impinges on its fiscal responsibilities\u2019, the decision \nis suspended on notification (within two weeks) by the Member State of ESMA and \nthe Commission. ESMA is to consider the decision within one month; where it \nmaintains the decision, the Council may, by a simple rather than the more usual \nqualified majority, and within two months of ESMA\u2019s review of the decision, decide \nwhether the decision is to be maintained and may terminate it. A similar regime \napplies to Article 18 \u2018emergency\u2019 decisions, albeit with shorter deadlines. The \navailability of this get-out clause was contested, and the Regulation takes some care \nto underline its exceptional nature.154 Nonetheless, it underlines the political \nrestrictions on ESMA\u2019s acquisition of direct power. \nThe same concerns are evident in the proposed 2011 CRA Regulation. Rating \nagencies represent a small and discrete section of the financial markets and related \nsupervisory decisions are unlikely to generate fiscal risks for the Member States.155 \nNonetheless, a concern to avoid market instability and related fiscal implications can \nbe seen in the new regime. Where ESMA decides to suspend a rating, the rating can be \nused for ten days after the ESMA decision; where another rating is not available, a \nthree-month period applies and this period may be extended by three months in \nexceptional circumstances related to the potential for market disruption or financial \ninstability (Article 24(3)). The Short-Selling Proposal is more problematic. ESMA\u2019s \nrole with respect to short-selling is largely limited to last resort powers which apply in \ntimes of market turbulence. But it is conceivable that ESMA intervention could lead to \nfiscal risks, particularly were it to intervene in the sovereign debt markets, potentially \nreducing liquidity and generating volatility and, accordingly, increasing Member \nStates\u2019 cost of borrowing. Some sensitivity to fiscal risk is apparent in the Proposal, \nwhich requires ESMA to take into account the extent to which its action will not have a \ndetrimental effect on the efficiency of markets, including with respect to liquidity \n(Article 24(3)). ECOFIN discussions may further limit the scope of this measure.156 \n                                                                                                                                               \n153  ECOFIN Meeting, 2 December 2009: 16571\/1-09. \n154  Any abuse of Art. 38, in particular in relation to a decision which does not have a \nsignificant or material fiscal impact, is to be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market \n(Art. 38(5)). Similarly, rec. 50 states that Art. 38 should not be used where the contested decision \nleads to a reduction of income, following the temporary prohibition of products or activities for \nconsumer protection purposes. \n155  There has been little sign of institutional or Member State dissent. E.g., COM(2009) 252 \n(setting out the Commission blueprint for supervisory reform) and European Council, 18\/19 June \n2009, Presidency Conclusions, No. 20. \n156  The UK government is concerned as to the potential for fiscal risks arising from ESMA \nintervention in the sovereign debt markets: e.g., European Scrutiny Committee, 4th Report, Session \n2010-2011, at pp. 14-15. \n212 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nThe extent to which fiscal risk-bearing is likely to shape ESMA\u2019s destiny can be \nclearly seen in the OTC Derivatives Proposal. There is some strain in the Proposal; the \nCommission has been careful to confer ESMA with significant influence over CCP \nsupervision, including involvement in the related colleges of competent authorities and \nwith respect to the proposing of BTSs concerning the application of the new regime. \nNonetheless, CCP authorisation and supervision will remain at Member State level. \nTrade repositories, however, as data conduits, do not raise fiscal risks and ESMA has \nbeen conferred with exclusive supervisory powers over these actors. \nThus far, there is limited Member State appetite for pan-EU resolution or funding \nmechanisms as the current debate on bank resolution suggests.157 Until these are in \nplace, there are limited incentives for Member States to place themselves at risk by \nfurther extending ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers. Its powers are, however, already \nsignificant and political conditions may change. \n2.10 Squeezing local discretion \nESMA\u2019s direct supervisory powers are considerable. Certain of these powers, such \nas the ESMA Regulation Article 18 power and the proposed powers under the Short-\nSelling Proposal, have the hue of autumn 2008 and are concerned with crisis-driven \nintervention. They may be more radical in their design than in their practical \nramifications. But they are not to be lightly dismissed. Although the Commission has \nsuggested that ESMA\u2019s contested direct decision-making powers over market actors \nwill be \u2018last resort\u2019 powers,158 as has ESMA,159 it would be unwise to assume they are \npaper tigers. This is all the more so given the alacrity with which the institutions \nhave conferred additional supervisory powers on ESMA, even though the 2011 \nESMA FAQ notes that any further grant of direct supervisory powers \u2018is likely to \noccur in very limited circumstances where the entity is pan-European and where \nthere is a clear added value to EU-level supervision\u2019.160 Even allowing for the fiscal \ncheck, the auguries concerning ESMA\u2019s likely trajectory are plentiful. During the \nfinal plenary vote on the ESMA Regulation, the European Parliament noted that the \nESAs \u2018will be able to grow as events\u2019 require. The extensive ESMA Regulation \nreview clause also contains some significant hostages to fortune (Article 81). And \nwhile a case can be made for many of ESMA\u2019s powers, ESMA\u2019s limited experience \n                                                                                                                                               \n157  The Commission\u2019s 2010 Communication on Crisis Resolution (supra n. 25) is largely \nconcerned with establishing common standards and with national crisis resolution funds, although \nthe Commission\u2019s preferred option was for a \u2018Single EU Fund\u2019. \n158  E.g., House of Commons, Treasury Select Committee, 16th Report 2008-2009, The \nCommittee\u2019s Opinion on Proposals for European Financial Supervision, 2008-2009, Commission \nWritten Evidence; ESMA Regulation, recs. 29 and 32. \n159  ESMA FAQ, at p. 9. \n160  Ibid. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 213\nin operational supervision, combined with flaws in its institutional model (section 3 \nbelow), may generate significant risks. \nThe more workaday convergence powers and the indirect effects of ESMA\u2019s \ndirect supervisory powers have real potential to lead to undue standardisation given \nthe pressure they will place on local operational discretion. Under the ESFS model, \nlocal competent authorities remain the default supervisors. ESMA\u2019s powers are as \ndelineated in the ESMA Regulation and related measures. And, for the moment at \nleast, local supervisors are pre-eminent. This division of labour, and the preservation \nof the powers of local authorities, was initially supported by the DLG Report.161 This \nduality also reflects the critical relationship between fiscal risk-bearing and \nsupervisory decision-making and accountability, as well as the multiple efficiencies \nwhich follow from local supervision. It has been important in reassuring local \ncompetent authorities with respect to the new model.162 As outlined in section 1 \nabove, local discretion over operational supervision is likely to become a very \nconsiderable sensitivity given the EU\u2019s control over rule and policy-making more \ngenerally in the wake of the crisis. But ESMA\u2019s powers and its potential to develop \ndynamically may significantly limit local supervisory discretion in practice with \nattendant risks to the quality of supervision. ESMA\u2019s likely effectiveness as a \nnascent supervisor therefore falls to be considered. \n3. ESMA\u2019S EFFECTIVENESS \n3.1 ESMA\u2019s operating model and incentives \nInstitutional design for financial market supervision is a complex process, as the \nconstruction of the emerging UK regime and the new Dodd-Frank Act structure in \nthe US attest. A significant literature charts the forces which shape institutional \ndesign and the difficult choices which arise concerning the (re-)organisation of \nsupervision.163 The difficulties are all the greater in the EU\u2019s internal market with its \n                                                                                                                                               \n161  Supra n. 6, at p. 47, describing the new structure as \u2018largely decentralised\u2019 and proposing \nthat \u2018national supervisors, who are closest to the markets and institutions they supervise, would \ncontinue to carry out day-to-day supervision and preserve the majority of their competences\u2019, and \nthat the ESAs would carry out \u2018a defined number of tasks that are better performed at EU level\u2019. \n162  E.g., FSA Chairman Turner, Speech at the City of London Corporation\u2019s Annual Reception \nfor the City Office, 6 October 2009, available at: <http:\/\/www.fsa.gov.uk\/pages\/Library\/Communi \ncation\/Speeches\/2009\/1006_at.shtml>. Similarly, Turner Review, supra n. 31, at p. 101, noting \n\u2018very strong arguments for keeping the primary responsibility for supervision at Member State \nlevel\u2019. \n163  E.g., Coffee and Sale, supra n. 106; H. Jackson, \u2018A Pragmatic Approach to the Phased \nConsolidation of Financial Regulation in the US\u2019 (2009), available at: <http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract= \n1300431>, and E. Ferran, \u2018The Break Up of the FSA\u2019 (2010), available at: <http:\/\/ssrn.com\/ \nabstract=1690523>. \n214 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nparticular political, institutional and constitutional forces which reflect complex \nsupranational and intergovernmental dynamics. These forces typically operate \nslowly, gradually shaping institutional structures.164 Although ESMA\u2019s supervisory \npowers suggest a radical break with the past, incrementalism has left a significant \nmark. ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers are exercised through a structure which reflects \nlong-standing determinative factors, including Member State and competent \nauthority interests, interinstitutional dynamics and (as discussed in section 3.2) \nconstitutional restrictions. This structure also reflects the \u2018off the shelf.\u2019 model which \nEU agency design provides, as well as the network-based model which CESR \npioneered. Not all of these influences on ESMA\u2019s operating model are likely to lead \nto good outcomes. \nESMA is an independent authority. But it is formed from its constituent \ncompetent authorities and thus continues to reflect CESR\u2019s network-based model. \nThe dynamics of the critical relationship between ESMA and the competent \nauthorities are likely to be complex. \nOn the one hand, ESMA can, inter alia, supplant competent authorities under \nESMA Regulation Articles 17-19, take action where it deems local action is \ninadequate (for example, under the Short-Selling Proposal and proposed AIFM \nDirective), demand justifications of action from competent authorities (for example, \nas envisaged under the MiFID Review and the Short-Selling Proposal) and shape \nsupervisory practices. On the other hand, ESMA\u2019s powers have been carefully \ndelineated and its direct operational powers typically activate in crisis or unusual \nconditions and are restricted. From the competent authority perspective, the loss of \npower is real. But authorities may be able to argue for more resources or powers \nunder the cover of ESMA demands. ESMA may also inject a greater degree of \nrealism into the wider political and policy debate with respect to the limitations of \nsupervision in preventing failure.165 The potential deterrent effects of losing power to \nESMA166 may also drive an enhancement of local supervisory standards. \nMore specifically, the impact of ESMA\u2019s operational model is unclear. ESMA\u2019s \noperating and resource model means that it must rely heavily on the support of its \nconstituent competent authorities. ESMA\u2019s budget is small. Its 2011 budget is \u20ac17 \nmillion and is projected to rise to \u20ac24 million by 2013. Its staffing levels are to rise \nfrom 70 in 2011 to 120 in 2013.167 This limited resourcing is reflected in the \n                                                                                                                                               \n164  M. Thatcher and D. Coen, \u2018Reshaping European Regulatory Space: An Evolutionary \nAnalysis\u2019, 31 Western European Politics (2009) p. 806.  \n165  FSA Chief Executive Sants recently highlighted that \u2018the [proposed Prudential Regulatory \nAuthority] will not be attempting to pursue a \u201czero failure\u201d regime. Persuading society that this is \nan acceptable goal will be a challenge\u2019: Sants, supra n. 31. \n166  These dynamics have been extensively discussed in the US context. E.g., M. Roe, \n\u2018Delaware\u2019s Competition\u2019, 117 Harvard Law Review (2003) p. 588. \n167  ESMA FAQ, at p. 13. By contrast, and even allowing for a very different range of \noperational activities, the FSA\u2019s budget for 2010-2011 was \u00a3458 million. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 215\noperating model adopted under the 2011 CRA Regulation which requires ESMA to \ndepend heavily on competent authorities. It is also reflected in ESMA\u2019s general \nworking model, which is based on standing committees chaired by senior \nrepresentatives of national authorities and composed of national experts and ESMA \nstaff.168 This dependence may lead ESMA to adopt a conciliatory and cooperative \napproach as it tests its powers. ESMA\u2019s working model may also dilute the \ncompetence risks to which it is subject, as long as different national practices are \ncarefully filtered. If the FSA example can be relied on more generally, national \nauthorities are adopting an \u2018open mind\u2019 while remaining careful to protect their \npowers. The FSA has welcomed the ESAs and is \u2018strongly committed to their \nsuccess\u2019.169 One senior FSA official has suggested that \u2018the less mature approach \nwould be to see the ESAs as somehow needlessly encroaching upon our national \nresponsibilities\u2019.170 Considerable emphasis has been placed on ensuring that adequate \nresources are committed to managing the FSA\u2019s relationship with the ESAs.171 But \nthere is a clear concern to emphasise the importance of the competent authorities \u2013 \n\u2018we believe that the ESAs should be strong, independent organisations and that they \nwill best achieve this by working with their members \u2013 the national supervisory \nauthorities\u2019172 \u2013 and nervousness as to the scope of ESMA\u2019s powers.173 Overall, the \nco-dependence of ESMA and its constituent competent authorities may lead to a \nnuanced approach to ESMA\u2019s extensive powers. \nOn the other hand, ESMA\u2019s budget may increase over time, particularly given \nlikely European Parliament support. During the early 2011 fracas concerning the \nappointment of the first set of ESA chairpersons (outlined in Part 1), the Parliament\u2019s \nECON Committee chairperson raised with both ECOFIN and the Commission the \nnecessity for the ESAs to be \u2018always provided with the necessary budgetary and \n                                                                                                                                               \n168  ESMA FAQ, at pp. 13 and 15. A March 2011 speech by FSA Director Sheila Nicoll \nunderlines the importance of the four relevant ESMA task forces in designing the delegated \nmeasures to be adopted under the proposed 2011 AIFM Directive: Speech on \u2018The Alternative \nInvestment Fund Managers Directive \u2013 The Road Ahead\u2019, Brussels, 17 March 2011, available at: \n<http:\/\/www.fsa.gov.uk\/pages\/Library\/Communication\/Speeches\/2011\/0317_sn.shtml>. \n169  FSA, The European Supervisory Authorities, available at: <http:\/\/www.fsa.gov.uk\/pages\/ \nAbout\/What\/International\/european\/esas\/index.shtml>. \n170  Nicoll, supra n. 55. \n171  FSA, Business Plan 2011\/2012, at p. 9, and HM Treasury, supra n. 54, para. 7.9, warning \nthat the new UK authorities should \u2018put significant time and effort into ensuring that the UK\u2019s \nvoice is heard at the European level and that decisions taken by the new authorities are \nappropriate\u2019. \n172  FSA, ibid. Similarly, the FSA has described the ESAs as \u2018member-led\u2019 and as \ncomplementing, not replacing, national authorities: FSA, The FSA\u2019s International Agenda (2010), \nat pp. 5-6. \n173  FSA, Working towards Effective and Confident European Supervisory Authorities.

ESMA Chairman Maijoor has already signalled some \ndetermination to address different supervisory approaches, including with respect to \nlisting.175 ESMA, despite its lengthy objectives (ESMA Regulation, Article 1), is also \nan institution in search of a defining mission. Professor Langevoort has written \nextensively on the importance of the retail investor protection mandate to the SEC.176 \nThere are some signs that ESMA, like CESR before it.177 but with more operational \nmeans at its disposal, may be embracing the retail agenda.178 This may reflect not \nonly potentially attractive political support.179 and support from the retail-friendly \nEuropean Parliament, but also a (very) slowly emerging international agenda,180 \nwhich ESMA may wish to lead in order to reinforce its powers concerning \ninternational engagement and its international position (discussed further below). A \nstrong retail focus may, however, lead to a generally more interventionist approach. \nThe interinstitutional dynamics are also complex and it remains to be seen \nwhether a dependent or antagonistic relationship develops, particularly with the \nCommission (section 3.2); but it does seem clear that ESMA is keen to establish its \nindependence.181 Market stakeholders have incentives to cooperate with ESMA, but \nthey may face troublesome conflicts at national level (section 2.6 above). The impact \nof international stakeholders also falls to be considered. ESMA is empowered to \ndevelop contacts and enter into administrative arrangements with supervisory \nauthorities, international organisations and administrations of third countries (ESMA \n                                                                                                                                               \n174  Letters from ECON Chairperson Bowles to the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council \nand to Commissioner Barnier, both of 1 February 2011, The Hungarian President-in-Office \nresponded that \u2018the Council has put high ambitions in the ESAs \u2026. it now belongs to both \nInstitutions [the Council and Parliament] to ensure that these ambitions translate into appropriate \nmeans each year\u2019: Letter to ECON Chairperson Bowles, 2 February 2011. Documents available via \nthe ECON website: <http:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/activities\/committees>. \n175  Froynovich, supra n. 129. \n176  E.g., D. Langevoort, \u2018Re-reading Cady Roberts: The Ideology and Practice of Insider \nTrading Regulation\u2019, 99 Columbia Law Review (1999) p. 1319. \n177  Moloney, supra n. 51, ch. 8. \n178  Chairman Maijoor is reported to have stressed that ESMA will have a strong consumer \nfocus: Tait, supra n. 129. \n179  Although a retail market focus has long been associated with continental supervisors, the \nUK, traditionally associated with a more market-facing style of regulation, has post-crisis focused \nclosely on the retail markets and has raised the tolerance level for consumer market failures: HM \nTreasury, supra n. 54. \n180  The retail markets have typically been overlooked at international level. A significant \nchange in tone came with the February 2011 Paris G20 Communiqu\u00e9 of Financial Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors, which called on the OECD, the FSB and other relevant international \norganisations to develop common principles on consumer protection: available via: <http:\/\/www. \ng20.org\/pub_communiques.aspx>, para. 6. \n181  Supra n. 129. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 217\nRegulation, Article 33).182 ESMA\u2019s influence on the international agenda is likely to \nbe greater if it is regarded as a robust supervisor. Article 33 may therefore provide \nESMA with incentives to increase its operational powers. This is all the more likely if \ninternational engagement becomes framed, as it was pre-crisis, in terms of \nliberalisation. The SEC\u2019s moves in the direction of a new mutual recognition model \nwere based in part on the \u2018equivalence\u2019 of supervisory regimes.183 While this project \nhas been sidelined, ESMA has some grounds for assuming that an interventionist \napproach to supervision, by a single EU authority, may yield dividends internationally. \nThe adoption of a sectoral model for the ESAs reflects political realities given the \npotentially troublesome federalist symbol which an integrated Authority might have \nbecome. It also reflects practical considerations given the convenient institutional \ntemplate which the 3L3 committees provided and the sectoral split in the wider \nlegislative regime. But the sectoral model injects the risk of silo-based organisation \ninto ESMA\u2019s supervisory activities. ESMA\u2019s silo-based model must work in tandem \nwith, and be cognizant of the impact on supervision of, different institutional \nstructures at national level. These include \u2018twin peaks\u2019 functional supervisors, \nconsolidated supervisors (the dominant model), sectoral supervisors and combination \nmodels.184 Related difficulties may arise with its governance model. ESMA\u2019s Board \nof Supervisors is composed of one national supervisor from each Member State, \nalthough an alternate may sit on the Board where the subject matter demands \ndifferent expertise (ESMA Regulation, Article 40(4)). The current restructuring of \nUK supervision, for example, has considered how ESMA representation should be \norganised, given the split of financial market supervision between the proposed \nPrudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.185 The likely \nshuffling of senior personnel may make it more difficult for ESMA to establish \ncohesion and trust in its highest decision-making body. This is particularly a risk \nwhere ESMA representatives are drawn from new national authorities which may be \n                                                                                                                                               \n182  These arrangements are not to create legal obligations and are without prejudice to the \npowers of the Member States and EU institutions. \n183  As initially outlined in E. Tafara and R. Peterson, \u2018A Blueprint for Cross-Border Access to \nU.S. Investors: A New International Framework\u2019, 48 Harvard Journal of International Law (2007) \np. 31. Similarly, C. Brummer, \u2018Post-American Securities Regulation\u2019, 98 Columbia Law Review \n(2010) p. 327. \n184  The emerging UK model, while broadly based on a twin peaks model, looks set to confer \nprudential supervision over some 18,500 firms on the new Financial Conduct Authority: HM \nTreasury, supra n. 54, at pp. 68-69. \n185  Ibid., paras. 7.11-7.14 and 7.20-7.25. It appears that where a prudential matter is raised by \nESMA, the (proposed) Prudential Regulatory Authority should be invited as a non-voting observer \nand its views taken into account by the (proposed) Financial Conduct Authority. Similarly, FSA \nChief Executive Sants has noted that \u2018it is vital \u2026 that we achieve effective domestic coordination \nand cooperation between the regulatory authorities to ensure the UK\u2019s views are best represented\u2019: \nSpeech on \u2018Creating the FCA\u2019, BBA Conference, 2 March 2011, available at: <http:\/\/www.fsa.gov. \nuk\/pages\/Library\/Communication\/Speeces\/2011\/0302_hs.shtml>. \n218 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \ncompeting for influence at national level and have incentives to take diverging \npositions \u2013 whether sympathetic or antagonistic to ESMA. Coordination between \nESMA, EBA and EIOPA on supervisory matters will also require careful \nmanagement.186 Each ESA will seek to establish its position and turf wars cannot be \nruled out, although the CESR experience with the \u20183L3\u2019 cooperation initiative is \nreasonably reassuring.187 A coordinating Joint Committee of European Supervisory \nAuthorities has been established (Article 54) and the ESAs sit as non-voting \nobservers on each other\u2019s Board of Supervisors (Article 40). As noted in Part 1, \nefforts are also already being made to ensure cross-ESA communication of key \ndecisions;188 there also seems to be some initial determination to ensure efficient \ncoordination.189 Unhelpful institutional tensions may, however, lead to a prejudicial \n\u2018race to the top\u2019 between the ESAs and, accordingly, increase ESMA\u2019s incentives to \ntake a grip over EU markets through its supervisory activities. \n3.2 ESMA\u2019s legal status \nESMA\u2019s legal status is the subject of some constructive ambiguity. The ESMA \nRegulation describes it as a \u2018Union body with legal personality\u2019 (Article 5), but it is \ntermed an Authority. Its structure, however, is closely related to that adopted by the \nEU \u2018agencies\u2019 which exercise powers delegated from, typically, the Commission.190 \nDifficulties with ESMA\u2019s legal status have two consequences in particular for its \neffectiveness as a supervisor. First, doubts as to its constitutional resilience may \ninfluence how ESMA approaches supervision. Second, ESMA carries many of the \nfeatures associated with EU agencies and the related Meroni doctrine. These features \nand the related implications for legal certainty.191 may hinder ESMA\u2019s effectiveness \nas a supervisor. \n                                                                                                                                               \n186  Inter-authority coordination can demand complex coordination models. The emerging \nregime for the proposed Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority will \nhave a variety of elements, including legal coordination duties, MOUs, governance strategies in \nterms of board representation, and specific coordination mechanisms for specific rule-making and \nsupervisory situations: HM Treasury, supra n. 54, at pp. 81-97. \n187  The 2009 CESR Annual Report, e.g., detailed the extensive 3L3 workplan: at pp. 72-80. \nRecent initiatives include a joint 3L3 report on the lessons learned from the financial crisis in the \ncontext of the Commission\u2019s Green Paper on Audit (CESR\/10-1541). \n188  Including under the proposed 2011 CRA Regulation (Art. 21). \n189  The ESMA FAQ notes its role in fostering supervisory convergence by working closely \nwith the other ESAs: at p. 3. \n190  E.g., E. Chiti, \u2018An Important Part of the EU\u2019s Institutional Machinery: Features, Problems \nand Perspectives of European Agencies\u2019, 46 Common Market Law Review (2009) p. 1395. \n191  The UK House of Commons report on the ESAs was of the view that \u2018it is wrong for an \nESA to be given power to override the decision of a national regulator and to direct individual \ninstitutions\u2019: supra n. 156, para. 71. The UK\u2019s Financial Law Committee was less trenchant, \nalthough concerned as to conformity with the Treaty and with the practical implications with \nrespect to enforcement and whether the ESAs\u2019 powers would undermine the ability of national \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 219\n3.2.1 ESMA and the Treaty \nThe constraint which the Treaty represents may temper ESMA\u2019s exercise of its \npowers. Part 1 considered the doubts as to Article 114 TFEU\u2019s (ex Article 95 EC) \nresilience as a basis for ESMA\u2019s quasi-rule-making powers. These doubts are all the \ngreater with respect to operational supervision. The principle that Article 114 does \nnot confer power to regulate the internal market, but supports \u2018approximating\u2019 \nmeasures which remove obstacles to free movement or distortions to competition is \nwell established.192 Plausible arguments can be made that the construction of the \ninternal market requires harmonisation\/approximation strategies which contain the \nrisks of that market; a fragmented supervisory system contributed to the \nretrenchment which occurred across the internal financial market over the crisis.193 \nBut ESMA\u2019s ability to exercise direct operational powers places new demands on \nArticle 114 as a means for managing the pathology, and not simply the benefits, of \ninternal market construction. The ENISA ruling,194 and its support of EU bodies \nbeing constructed under Article 114 in order to support a \u2018process of harmonisation\u2019, \nhas been used in support of ESMA\u2019s basis (ESMA Regulation, recital 17). But direct \noperational intervention on the scale which ESMA brings might be better described \nas a different form of intervention, associated with but distinct from harmonisation. \nThe ENISA agency, by contrast, is concerned with information sharing and \ncooperation. The complexity of ESMA\u2019s accompanying legal regimes in terms of \nthird-party rights\u2019 protection, direct enforcement action, investigations, fiscal \nprotection and shared operational powers points to a new form of intervention. The \nENISA ruling also refers to the adoption of \u2018non-binding supporting and framework \nmeasures\u2019;195 but ESMA\u2019s direct supervisory powers are binding. ESMA also strains \nagainst the Article 5 TEU subsidiarity principle. Is ESMA, distanced from the \nmarkets and dependent on good relations with competent authorities, best placed to \nmake operational decisions? But subsidiarity concerns generally have tended to \nreceive somewhat glancing treatment in the post-crisis legislative agenda,196 leading \nto some concern from the Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board.197 \n                                                                                                                                               \nauthorities to discharge their regulatory functions: Financial Markets Law Committee, Issue 152, \nEuropean Financial Supervision: Legal Risks (2010), at pp. 9-10 and 13-16. \n192  E.g.

E.g., the Board\u2019s assessment of the Proposal to Amend the Deposit Guarantee Directive \n(Ref. Ares(2010)16390). \n220 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nThe current political and institutional consensus on ESMA\u2019s constitutional \nrobustness is holding. This consensus may, as Part 1 argues, fracture as national \nauthorities find their rule-making powers and related ability to build their \ninstitutional position and reputational capital constrained by ESMA. ESMA\u2019s new \nsupervisory powers may place even greater strain on this consensus as rule-making \npower has been draining from the Member States to the EU for some time. \nCompetent authorities are also focusing more closely on supervision. The French \nAMF\u2019s 2008 policy on Better Regulation highlights the AMF\u2019s new focus on risk \nevaluation methodologies, new surveillance tools, more specialised personnel and an \ninternal management reorganisation.198 The 2008 Annual Report by the Italian \nCONSOB highlights its launching of a strategic planning process to define \nsupervisory policies.199 The Dutch AFM\u2019s efforts include a heightened focus on \naudits and a 2010 report calling for a fundamental change to how audits were \nconducted.200 In the UK, operational supervision has become a major preoccupation \nfollowing the Supervisory Enhancement Programme over 2008-2009 and the related \nadoption of Intensive Supervision. ESMA\u2019s supervisory activities may become an \nunwelcome check on supervisory innovation. Supervision is also likely to be an area \nof considerable sensitivity as it represents the only significant lever which local \ncompetent authorities may pull to protect their markets. \nESMA may therefore be sensitive to the potential for a competence challenge and \nof the related need to manage carefully relationships with national authorities as it \ntests its supervisory powers. The risk of constitutional challenge may accordingly \nbrake ESMA. \n3.2.2 ESMA as an agency and the Meroni effect \nThe seminal Meroni ruling.201 provides that discretionary powers involving a wide \nmargin of discretion which may make possible the execution of economic policy \ncannot be delegated by an EU institution. Only clearly defined executive powers, \nsubject to strict review in light of objective criteria determined by the delegating \nauthority, may be delegated. The Meroni ruling is strongly associated with the \nproliferation of agencies over the last twenty years or so and has shaped the structure \nand powers of EU agencies.202 It has also shaped ESMA in that many of ESMA\u2019s \nfeatures are designed to respond to the Meroni constraint.203 But two difficulties in \n                                                                                                                                               \n198  AMF, Better Regulation: Initial Assessment and 2008\/2009 Work Agenda (2008), at p. 16. \n199  CONSOB, Annual Report 2008, at pp. 15-16. \n200  AFM, Report on General Findings Regarding Audit Quality and Quality Control \nMonitoring (2010). \n201  Case 9\/56 Meroni v.

First, it is not clear that the agency\/Meroni model is an appropriate \ndesign for a nascent financial market supervisor. Second, the agency\/Meroni model \nmay generate legal certainty risks which prejudice effective supervision. \nTurning to the first difficulty, a significant EU administrative law literature \nexamines the impact of Meroni on agency design and the different measures \nemployed to bolster agency legitimacy and accountability in a delegation context.204 \nBut there are particular difficulties in using the Meroni\/delegation model, however \nsophisticated (and Treaty-driven), as the blueprint for a nascent supervisor. Many \nMeroni-related agency features are concerned with protecting the Commission\u2019s \nposition as principal with respect to the delegation of executive tasks.205 But the \nCommission\u2019s traditional role in the financial markets area has been to initiate \npolicy, propose legislation and adopt delegated rules. It has little experience with the \noperational business of supervision. It is also not clear that the Commission is the \nprincipal whose interests need to be protected.206 There is a Commission interest in \nmanaging the delegation of executive\/implementing powers. But the co-legislators \n(the Parliament and Council) also have an interest given the norm-setting quality of \nsupervision and enforcement decisions. And although ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers \nare not formally delegated from the Member States (they are not EU institutions \nfrom which powers can be delegated), the Member State interest is considerable. \nAlthough some EU agencies are conferred with new supervisory powers, supervisory \npowers in the financial market sphere lay (and still lie) with the Member States,207 \nbefore their being conferred on ESMA. The concepts of institutional delegation and \ncontrol which have dominated EU agency design do not therefore have the same \ntraction with respect to ESMA and may lead to operational inefficiencies. \nThe proposed 2011 CRA Regulation places tight restrictions, for example, on \nhow ESMA is to impose monetary penalties (discussed below). It represents an \nimprovement on the original Proposal according to which fining power was reserved \nto the Commission under a Meroni-based model.208 which was potentially cumber-\n                                                                                                                                               \n204  E.g., M.

(Cheltenham, Elgar 2005) p. 87, at pp. 93-95. \n206  The particular difficulties which ESMA raises aside, the chain of delegation to an agency is \ngenerally not easy to identify: Curtin, ibid., at p. 90. \n207  Ibid., at p. 94, in the context of the enforcement powers exercised by the (then) proposed \nCommunity Fisheries Control Agency and, similarly, Dehousse supra n. 204, at p. 13, suggesting \nthat implementation powers move from Member States to agencies, and Geradin and Petit, supra n. \n118, examining the transfer of powers to agencies in terms of the extraction of power from national \nauthorities (at p. 15). \n208  European Commission, Improving EU Supervision of Credit Rating Agencies \u2013 Frequently \nAsked Questions (2009) (MEMO\/10\/230). The Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment also argued \nagainst direct ESMA fining power given Meroni concerns: supra n. 130, at p. 30. \n222 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nsome, inefficient and likely to exacerbate tensions between the Commission and \nESMA. But the current detailed model is also troublesome. It limits ESMA\u2019s \ndiscretion and assumes (given the level of detail in the Regulation) that the co-\nlegislators (Parliament and Council) are better placed to deal with granular \noperational matters than ESMA. Given the third-party protections provided under the \nESMA Regulation (section 2.6 above), there seems little reason to restrict ESMA\u2019s \noperational discretion, apart from the apparent constitutional restrictions, institutional \ndeference to Meroni and related earlier agency precedents; the fining regime under \nthe European Aviation Safety Agency Regulation, for example, reserves fining \npowers to the Commission.209 The Commission\u2019s related influence over ESMA\u2019s \nrating agency powers (section 2.8 above) is more generally troublesome. Relations \nbetween the Commission and ESMA are likely to be tense, given that, as argued in \nPart 1, the Commission stands to lose from ESMA\u2019s acquisition of power. But the \nformalisation of Commission oversight over ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers, reflecting \nthe Meroni model, means that tensions may be fed through to operational decision-\nmaking. These tensions may be increased by the European Parliament\u2019s championing \nof ESMA as a supervisor.210 Unlike the Commission, the Parliament has little to fear \nfrom ESMA, particularly given the Parliament\u2019s status as a co-legislator with \nECOFIN with respect to the legislative measures which confer power on ESMA. \nAlso unlike the Commission, constitutionally the Parliament is not directly \nconcerned with implementation. The recent evidence concerning product prohibition \nis revealing. Under the MiFID Review, the Commission has proposed that it be \nempowered to ban products in defined circumstances.211 The ESMA Regulation, \nhowever, contains an enabling clause which empowers ESMA temporarily to \nprohibit products (section 2.7 above). While the chances of such a Commission \npower surviving the legislative process are low given the institutional sensitivities \nand likely Member State hostility, its very articulation by the Commission suggests \nits concern to limit the transfer of supervisory powers to ESMA. \nSecond, once the decision was taken to base ESMA\u2019s design on agency\/Meroni \nlines, legal certainty risks increased. Under Meroni, discretionary decisions which \n\u2018require difficult choices in reconciling various objectives laid down in the Treaty \n                                                                                                                                               \n209  Regulation (EC) No 216\/2008, OJ 2008 L79\/1, Art. 25. \n210  E.g., the Parliament and\/or its ECON Committee: added Art. 9 to the ESMA Regulation and \ncalled for direct supervisory powers over systemically significant actors (supra n. 126); added the \nESMA power to undertake random sample tests on the validity of ratings, later diluted to a power \nto oversee back-testing by rating agencies, to the proposed 2011 CRA Regulation (Gauz\u00e8s Report, \nsupra n. 134); and argued for ESMA (rather than the Commission) to exercise the power to impose \nfines under the Regulation (I. Wishart, \u2018MEPS Want to Give More Power to Securities and Markets \nAuthority\u2019, European Voice, 25 November 2011, available via: <http:\/\/www.europeanvoice.com>); \nand called for additional ESMA information-gathering powers and a hardening of ESMA\u2019s power \nto offer an \u2018opinion\u2019 on a national short-selling decision to the power to make a binding \u2018decision\u2019, \nECON Legislative Report, November 2010 (Canfin Report) (PE.454.372). \n211  MiFID Review, at pp. 80-81. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 223\namounting to the execution of actual economic policy\u2019 cannot be delegated. Most EU \nagencies do not cause difficulties in this regard as they are designed to support \ncooperation between national authorities, collate information or provide \nadministrative support or technical expertise to the Commission.212 A handful of EU \nagencies at the top of the agency \u2018hierarchy\u2019 are \u2018decision-making\u2019 authorities in that \nthey can impose decisions on third parties. But even these advanced agencies \nexercise more limited decision-making powers and typically operate within discrete \nand specialist EU regimes, usually concerned with licensing. The Community Plant \nVariety Office (CVPO) exercises licensing and right conferral powers.213 The Office \nfor Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) administers the Community trade \nmark regime and exercises related trademark conferral powers.214 The European \nAviation Safety Agency (EASA) exercises powers with respect to safety licensing \nunder the aviation regime.215 The European Chemicals Agency registers, evaluates \nand authorises chemicals under the EU\u2019s \u2018REACH\u2019 regime.216 All of these decision-\nmaking powers are limited and closely related to particular EU regimes.217 A step \nchange occurred in 2009 with the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy \nRegulators,218 which can take \u2018individual regulatory decisions\u2019 with potentially \ndiscretionary and economic implications with respect to cross-border energy \ninfrastructures and exemptions from the energy regime.219 \nESMA, however, is particularly vulnerable to challenge for breach of the \nprohibition on delegation of discretionary powers. The sensitive nature of the \neconomic interests potentially at stake is reflected in the Article 38 fiscal safeguard \nclause as well as in the restrictions which apply to ESMA\u2019s direct powers generally. \nSupervisory decisions can also have a norm-setting effect in financial market \nregulation; the FSA\u2019s \u2018Treating Customers Fairly\u2019 supervisory model came to be \nregarded as a form of quasi-rule-making by the FSA.220 It is also not clear that these \npowers are clearly defined. Challenges may follow given the vagueness of the typical \ngoverning terms: when might ESMA safely assume that competition has been \ndistorted, the orderly functioning of the market affected or market stability \nthreatened? The Meroni constraint may therefore lead to a situation in which \nESMA\u2019s powers are unstable and legal certainty is threatened; the FSA\u2019s 2010 \nposition paper on the ESAs is alive to this risk, suggesting that ESMA take care to \nensure that any emergency action is not ultra vires.221 The Meroni constraint may \n                                                                                                                                               \n212  E.g., Chiti, supra n. 190, at pp. 1403-1404. \n213  Regulation (EC) No 2100\/94, OJ 1994 L 227\/1. \n214  Regulation (EC) No 40\/94, OJ 1994 L 11\/1. \n215  Regulation (EC) No 216\/2008, OJ 2008 L 79\/1. \n216  Regulation (EC) No 1907\/2006, OJ 2006 L 396\/1. \n217  Geradin and Petit note the \u2018clear trans-European component\u2019: supra n. 118, at p. 39. \n218  Regulation (EC) No 713\/2009, OJ 2009 L 211\/1. \n219  Arts. 8 and 9. \n220  Black, et al., supra n. 50. \n221  FSA, supra n. 173, at p. 11, calling for a panel of expert lawyers to assess action which \nappears to test the bounds of ESMA\u2019s powers. \n224 Niamh Moloney EBOR 12 (2011) \nalso lead to the risk of ESMA not exercising powers in cases where it should, fearful \nof triggering litigation. \nThe legal certainty risk may diminish in the future as the institutions become \nmore familiar with how to design ESMA powers within the Meroni restriction. The \nproposed 2011 CRA Regulation, for example, generated some considerable \nsensitivity to Meroni requirements on the part of certain Member States.222 as well as \nthe Commission,223 and evolved significantly over the negotiations; the December \n2011 political agreement is considerably more sophisticated than the Commission\u2019s \noriginal Proposal. ESMA\u2019s operational discretion is confined by, for example, \ndeadline controls on the registration process (Articles 15-18), the Commission\u2019s \nsetting of registration and supervisory fees (Article 19),224 and requirements \ngoverning ESMA\u2019s powers to request information (Article 23a), to carry out general \ninvestigations (Article 23b) and to take part in or require on-site inspections (Article \n23c). Particular requirements apply to ESMA\u2019s supervision of back-testing by rating \nagencies of their methodologies (Article 22a). A detailed Annex III sets out the \ncircumstances in which ESMA can take enforcement action. The nature of \nenforcement action, including how the seriousness of an infringement is assessed, is \nspecified in detail under Articles 24 and 36a and b. Procedural requirements apply, \nincluding the requirement for an independent investigation officer within ESMA to \ninvestigate the breach (Article 23d). The fining regime is particularly sensitive to \nMeroni. The power to impose fines (Article 36a) arises only where the Board of \nSupervisors finds that a rating agency has, negligently or intentionally (as defined in \nthe Regulation), committed an infringement identified in Annex III. A minimum and \nmaximum fine range applies to each of the Annex III infringements. The Regulation \nalso sets out how ESMA should decide whether fines \u2018should be at the lower, the \nmiddle or the higher\u2019 end of these limits.225 This highly detailed regime will be \nsupported by delegated rules adopted by the Commission with respect to, for \nexample, defence rights, temporal requirements, limitation periods and the collection \nof fines. A similar design applies to periodic penalties under Article 36b. \n                                                                                                                                               \n222  Notably the UK: European Scrutiny Committee, 7th Report, Session 2010-2011, at pp. 70-\n72, citing the Financial Services Secretary to HM Treasury as noting that \u2018the legality of delegating \ndiscretionary powers to [ESMA] is of vital importance and has been a priority for the Government \nthroughout the negotiations\u2019. \n223  The Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board reports on the proposed 2011 CRA \nRegulation raised Meroni concerns with respect to the justification for ESMA\u2019s supervisory and \nenforcement powers: Ref. Ares(2010)205437, 21 April 2010 (second report on the revised Impact \nAssessment) and Ref. Ares(2010)108790, 2 March 2010 (first report on the initial Impact \nAssessment). \n224  The Commission is to adopt a regulation on fees governing the types of fees due, the \namount, how they are paid and when costs may be reimbursed to national competent authorities \n(Art. 19(2)). \n225  Annex IV provides, e.g., that if the infringement has been committed repeatedly an \nadditional coefficient of 1.1 must apply to each repetition. \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority \u2013 Part (2) 225\nBut the price of Meroni compliance may be inefficiencies given the limitations on \nESMA\u2019s freedom to act. Difficulties also remain. ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers under \nthe 2011 CRA Regulation are less heavily constrained than its enforcement powers. \nNotably, the Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board was not convinced with the \nexplanation of how the supervisory regime met the Meroni doctrine, and requested a \nnew Impact Assessment.226 Its review of the revised Impact Assessment repeated this \nconcern.227 \nThe Meroni constraint may have led to a \u2018worst of both worlds\u2019 scenario. There \nare risks to ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers. But once ESMA became the institutional \nvehicle for pan-EU supervision, certainty and effectiveness were required. The \nMeroni\/agency model, however, is ill-suited to financial market supervision. \n4. CONCLUSION \nThe extent of ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers may have pushed ESMA too high up the \nspectrum from national and towards EU powers, particularly given the likely \nmomentum effects. The ESFS is based on operational supervision remaining at \nMember State level; the danger of this becoming a matter of form rather than \nsubstance is considerable. There are also significant uncertainties as to ESMA\u2019s \neffectiveness as a direct supervisor, which, combined with the current institutional \nenthusiasm for conferring additional powers on ESMA, is troubling. The Meroni \nconstraint, combined with other structural features, may also lead to less than \noptimum supervisory decisions by ESMA. \nThe braver option might have been to limit ESMA\u2019s influence on supervision. It \nmight, for example, have been possible to distinguish between ESMA and EBA, \nwhich currently share the same set of powers, and to limit ESMA\u2019s direct \nsupervisory powers, given that the financial stability concerns which have driven the \nnew structure are, in some respects at least, weaker in the financial market context. \nBut once supervision was placed on the reform agenda, a Pandora\u2019s Box opened. It \nwas always going to be a challenge to draw the dividing line between ESMA\u2019s \npowers and those of national competent authorities. Time will tell, but the line may \nhave been drawn too far on the side of further operational centralisation. \n                                                                                                                                               \n226  Supra n. 223, asking why Meroni issues were only considered with respect to sanctioning \nand not in regard to other supervisory powers, including registration and inspection: at p. 2. \n227  Supra n. 223, p. 2. \n"}
