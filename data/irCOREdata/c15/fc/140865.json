In making this claim, we consider ways in which a somatic sense of\nself contributes to the felt sense of authenticity, and how through engaging with\nsomatic cues, leadership can be performed in a way which is experienced as authentic,\nboth to the leader and to those he or she seeks to lead. In developing our ideas\nfurther, we draw from the acting theory of Stanislavski (1936a, 1936b, 1961) to\nexplore how authentic dramatic performances are created, focusing on the role of\nemotional memory, the magic \u2018if\u2019 and physical aspects of performances. We propose\nthree key components of a resulting theory of how embodied authentic leadership is\ncreated: self exposure, relating, and making leaderly choices.\nKeywords: Authentic leadership, authenticity, embodiment, embodied leadership,\naesthetic leadership\n2ENACTING \u2018THE TRUE SELF\u2019:\nTOWARDS A THEORY OF EMBODIED AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP\nAfter Barack Obama\u2019s surprising win in the Iowa caucus in the early stages of\nthe Democratic primary election in 2008, polls indicated he held a strong lead going\ninto the next primary in New Hampshire. However, the pollsters\u2019 predictions proved\ninaccurate when Hillary Clinton won in New Hampshire by a margin of three\npercentage points. The media largely attributed Mrs Clinton\u2019s victory to a particular\nevent which occurred during the final stages of the New Hampshire campaign,\nsubsequently known as \u2018Hillary\u2019s Tears\u2019. When asked by a sympathetic woman\nsupporter \u2018How she kept going\u2019 in the face of Obama\u2019s upsurge of support, Hillary\nfaltered. As reported on Fox News later that day:\nFor the first time in public Hillary Clinton evidenced the strain and stress\u2026You see\nthe emotion, you see the tears beginning to well in Hillary Clinton\u2019s face, and the\nvoice cracks just a bit\u2026We spoke with women voters after the interview and many of\nthem were moved by Hillary Clinton\u2019s show of emotion. Fox News 8 January 2008\nThis quote highlights a crucial facet of authenticity as it applies to leadership.\nAlthough \u2018authenticity\u2019 may be defined fundamentally in self referent terms (Sartre\n1943, Maslow 1968), it is the way in which that \u2018true self\u2019 is enacted which is critical\nto followers\u2019 experience of authentic leadership. In this way, we would suggest that\nauthenticity could be seen as an aspect of the aesthetic dimension of leadership,\n(Duke, 1986, Hanson et al 2007, Ladkin 2008) and as such includes both the\nembodied, as well as the intentional aspects of a leader\u2019s enactment of their role.\n3To return to the example of Hillary Clinton highlighted above, only Mrs\nClinton herself knows the extent to which her tears were an expression of authentic\nfeeling on her part (and furthermore the particular feeling they may have been\nrepresentative of). However, the amount of media attention this event subsequently\nreceived points to the relevance of the physical, embodied way in which leaders\nexpress themselves in followers\u2019 assessment of a leader\u2019s authenticity.\nOur paper begins from the assumption that the way in which the leader\u2019s\n\u2018self\u2019 is embodied is a critical determinant of the experience of authentic leadership.\nFollowing from this we address the question of how leadership enactments can be\ncreated which express something of that self in a way which can be read and\ninterpreted as \u2018authentic\u2019.\nWithin the growing body of \u2018authentic leadership\u2019 literature there is work\ndevoted to defining authentic leadership (Luthens & Avolio 2003, Chan et al 2005), to\nforging its conceptual relationship with other positive forms of leadership (Avolio &\nGardner 2005, Iles et al 2005) and to linking it to authentic followership and authentic\nleadership development (Gardner et al 2005a, 2005b). Although there is some\nliterature which considers how assessments of authenticity are made by followers,\n(Avolio et al 2004) these studies focus on more readily measurable factors, such as\nthe amount of contact that leaders and followers have (Fields 2007) or the extent to\nwhich leaders adhere to organisational codes of conduct (Six et al 2007). This paper\nmakes a unique contribution to this emergent field by attending to the aesthetic and\nexpressed aspects of leading with the aim of proposing the beginnings of a theory of\nhow embodied authentic leadership is created.\nTo develop this theory we start by considering the nature of the \u2018true self\u2019,\nnoticing in particular the way in which somatic and symbolic knowledge interact in\n4developing a sense of \u2018self\u2019. We explore this interaction further through reference to\na parallel human activity in which the creation of authentic performance is key, that of\nacting. Stanislavski\u2019s (1936a, 1936b, 1961) technique of method acting provides the\ntheoretical ground to consider practices which contribute to the enactment of\nauthentic theatrical performances. Implications of these practices for leaders are\nsuggested and a three-component model of embodied authentic leadership proposed.\nWe begin, however, by placing our argument within the larger literature about\nauthentic leadership.\nAUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP\u2014A CRITIQUE OF CURRENT THEORISING\n\u2018Authentic leadership\u2019 is a relative newcomer to the leadership literature\ncanon, first appearing in the 1990s in the fields of sociology and education (Chan et al\n2005). Given its emergent status as a concept it has attracted a good deal of attention\nfrom the leadership studies community as indicated by three recent special issues\ndevoted to the topic in academic journals, Leadership Quarterly (2005\/1), the Journal\nof Management Studies (2005\/42), and The European Management Journal (2007\/2),\na growing body of work undertaken by the Gallup Leadership Institute (e.g. Gardner\net al, 2005a) as well as a burgeoning of more popular writing bringing attention to this\nconcept (Irvine and Reger 2006, Goffee and Jones 2005, George 2003).\nAs Cooper et al (2005) point out; presently one of the difficulties with the\nconcept from a theoretical perspective is that a unified, agreed definition for authentic\nleadership does not exist. However, our survey of the extant work in the field reveals\nthat although authors do not completely concur on a shared definition, three themes\n5underpin much of the way in which the term is used. Throughout the literature\nauthenticity is seen to be informed by the \u2018true\u2019 self (Avolio & Gardner 2005,\nMitchie & Gooty 2005). Following from this, most authors see self awareness as a\nkey component of authenticity (Lord & Hall 2005, Avolio et al 2004, Silvia & Duval\n2001). Finally, the literature strongly connects authentic leadership with moral\nleadership (Hannah et al 2005, Luthans & Avolio 2003, May et al 2003), and through\nthis connection resembles notions of socialized charismatic leadership (Howell 1988).\nThis may reflect the association of much of the authentic leadership literature with the\npositive organisational studies movement (Cameron et al 2003). In fact, Avolio and\nGardner (2005) make the case for \u2018authentic leadership\u2019 being the \u2018root\u2019 informing\nconstruct of all new positive forms of leadership, including \u2018transformational,\ncharismatic, servant and spiritual leadership\u2019 (p. 328). These three themes therefore,\nthat authentic leadership is the expression of the \u2018true self, that the leader must be\nrelatively aware of the nature of that self in order to express it authentically, and that\nthe self is normatively inclined towards moral virtue form a core of ideas which\ninform current theorising of authentic leadership.1\nThere seems to be an underlying assumption informing much of the authentic\nleadership literature that knowing one\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 and behaving from that self-\nreferential place will automatically be communicated to followers who will\nexperience the leader as authentic. However, as Fields (2007) writes \u2018it is not clear\nfrom authentic leadership theory how deeply self referent aspects of a leader\u2019s self\n(authenticity) and the leader\u2019s underlying moral values (integrity) become apparent to\nfollowers (p 196). Pittinsky & Tyson (2005) echo this, suggesting that interior states\n1 We note that Chan et al 2005 point out the inherently problematic nature of definitions of authentic\nleadership which also include attributes such as \u2018developmental focus and positive psychological\ncapacities\u2019 and that finding a person who would embody all of these would be difficult!\n6are not always readily apparent to observers, yet, \u2018on a practical level, followers\u2019\nperceptions of the authenticity of a leader are as important to consider as are the\nactual thoughts and actions of the leader being perceived\u2019 (p 254).\nAlthough it may be obvious, for the purposes of our argument it is important\nto point out that it is the leader\u2019s body, and the way he or she uses it to express their\n\u2018true self\u2019 which is the seemingly invisible mechanism through which authenticity is\nconveyed to others. Notions of embodiment and how the body functions within\norganisations have received increasing attention within the field of organisational\nstudies (Hassard et al 2000), however the embodied aspect of leadership receives\nrelatively little attention within the leadership canon. Writers such as Sinclair (2005a,\n2005b) and Ropo & Parviainen (1999) are making initial forays into this territory.\nTheir work points to the paradoxical nature of leadership as an embodied\nphenomenon in that it is an omnipresent, and often definitional aspect of leadership,\nyet it is almost taboo to speak of leaders\u2019 physical forms. We believe recognition of\nthe bodily aspect of leadership is critical to understanding how authentic leadership is\nperceived. Before exploring the implications of this idea more fully, we examine\nanother crucial aspect of authentic leadership, the way the notion of the \u2018self\u2019 itself is\nconstructed.\nConstructions of \u2018the self\u2019 within authentic leadership\nThe notion that authenticity is essentially a self-referent concept follows from\nErickson\u2019s definition of the authentic self as existing \u2018wholly by the laws of its own\nbeing (1995, p. 125). The authentic leadership literature is littered with references to\n7authentic leadership being an expression of the \u2018true self\u2019 (Avolio et al 2004, George\n2003, Avolio & Gardner 2005). But what is the nature of that \u2018true self\u2019?\nCertainly, this question has been debated by human beings probably as long as\nthey have had reflexive capacity to pose it. Here, we draw primarily from Western-\nbased psychological literature in considering how the self is constituted. Wilson\n(1988) provides a helpful framing of the distinction between psychological theories he\nlabels \u2018humanistic\u2019 or \u2018essentialist\u2019 in their treatment of the \u2018self\u2019 such as those\ndeveloped by Maslow (1968, 1976) and Rogers (1961), and more \u2018interactionist\u2019\nperspectives such as those developed by Mead (1934), Gergen (1977) and Lewis\n(1979) among others.\nOn first glance, the authentic leadership literature seems to follow the\nessentialist perspective, with the existence of a \u2018true self\u2019 which can readily be\naccessed taken for granted. However, more interactionist perspectives are apparent in\nthe work of theorists such as Lord & Brown (2004) who base their notion of the self\non ideas of \u2018working selves\u2019 and \u2018possible selves\u2019 as advanced by Markus and Nurius\n(1986) and Markus and Wurf (1987). In a similar vein, Sparrowe (2005) calls for the\nimportance of understanding the construction of the self as an ongoing process which\nemerges through self narrative processes. Shamir & Eilam (2005) support this view,\narguing that the self is a \u2018subjective phenomenon\u2019 which develops through\narticulation of \u2018life stories\u2019 conveyed to others as well as to oneself.\nA number of theorists highlight the inherent dilemma between acting\n\u2018authentically\u2019 if that authenticity is grounded in a uni-dimensional view of the self\nand the role requirements of leadership. For instance, although Sosik et al (2002) are\nspecifically referring to charismatic leadership, it is interesting to note that their idea\nof a \u2018variety of identity images\u2019 allows for the reading of more \u2018authentic\u2019 enactment\n8within different contexts. A concept which might further elucidate how a variety of\nidentity images may contribute to authentic enactment is that of \u2018situated identity\u2019.\nSchlenker (1985) defines identity as being \u2018one\u2019s true self, which is socially\nconstructed and refined through years of social relations and becomes a relatively\nstable part of the \u2018self system\u2019. One\u2019s \u2018situated identity\u2019, on the other hand, is how\nthe identity becomes operationalised within particular situations and contexts.\nUnderpinning much of this literature, whether from the psychological or\nleadership domains, is the often ghostly and unacknowledged \u2018choosing\u2019 self, which\nmediates a relationship between an internal personal realm and the external world in\nwhich any possibility of a \u2018true self\u2019 operates. Wilson (1988) engages with this\nparadox head-on and it is worth introducing his argument in more depth because of its\nrelevance for our own work. Drawing from Ginsberg\u2019s writings (1984) Wilson\nproposes that a more inner-oriented experience of self, i.e. a more \u2018essentialist\u2019 sense\nof self, is grounded in \u2018somatic self processes\u2019. This is the realm of emotional bodily\nreactions, such as butterflies in the tummy, the headiness of elation, or the queasiness\nassociated with uncertainty. He suggests that being attentive to these somatic events\nprovides the possibility for \u2018self actualisation\u2019 (Maslow 1976) and is crucial for the\ndevelopment of the true self.\nHowever, the true self also develops within an external context, and Wilson\ngoes on to suggest that this \u2018interactionist\u2019 self results from symbolic interactions\noccurring outside of the internal world. These symbols include the language people\nuse to tell us about ourselves, our location in family and organizational structures, the\ngestures and facial expressions with which our behaviour is received and responded\nto, all of the many ways in which the world tells us \u2018who we are\u2019. The key point\nabout both ways of knowing the self Wilson offers, is that, \u2018although it is useful to\n9distinguish between the symbolic and somatic self processes, the two are clearly\ninterlinked.\u2019 (1988, p.45) Wilson quotes Shibutani (1961) to explicate this point more\nfully:\nAll somatic experiences are somehow related to one\u2019s conception of himself (sic) and\nthere is continuity in his life to the extent that he can organize them into some kind of\nunit. Thus, one\u2019s body becomes the nexus of the various experiences that enable him\nto identify himself as a person of a particular sort. (p. 222)\nThis suggests that the ground for a person\u2019s sense of self, both in terms of the\nsomatic sense but also in terms of the symbolic sense, is negotiated, made sense of,\nand then expressed through the body. Enacting that self is dependent, in the first\ninstance on awareness of the somatic clues the body gives us about how we are\nexperiencing a given situation. Ginsberg (1982) and Sarbin (1968) conclude that our\nkinaesthetic sense of ourselves is our most primordial, and emerges from a level of\nthe self not yet mediated by symbolic interactions. This would suggest that the body\nis a more trustworthy ground for revealing individuals\u2019 deeper, perhaps \u2018truer\u2019\nmotives and emotions.\nSuch an interpretation could account for the raft of leadership studies which\nindicate that charisma is attributed on the basis of the way in which messages are\ndelivered, rather than the actual content of them in followers\u2019 assessment of leaders\u2019\ncharisma (Awamleh & Gardner 1999, Howell & Frost 1989, Holladay & Coombs\n1993, Holladay & Coombs 1994, Kirkpatrick & Locke 1996). Similarly, we would\nsuggest, in assessing a leader\u2019s level of authenticity, in the first instance followers will\nscrutinise their bodily signals. This analysis could explain the high degree of interest\n10\nin \u2018Hillary\u2019s Tears\u2019\u2014their potential for revealing emotions and motives below the\npolished performance people had come to expect from her.\nWe now turn to a critical question this paper raises. If we are proposing that\nembodiment of the \u2018true self\u2019 demands the interaction of an inner-informed somatic\nsense of the body with symbolically mediated sense-making processes informed by\nthe external context, how might that be accomplished in a way that is consistent with\nthe expression of authentic leadership? We propose the possibility of a conscious\nprocess being brought to this mediation, and examine the way actors create authentic\nperformances as a way of illuminating how that might be accomplished.\nACTING AUTHENTICALLY\n\u2018Don\u2019t take a part if it isn\u2019t in you---a part has to be real to you before it can\nbe real to an audience\u2026\u2019 Dustin Hoffman playing Michael Dorsey in the film\n\u2018Tootsie\u2019\nTurning to the literature on acting in order to develop a theory of embodied\nauthentic leadership may at first glance appear to be a contradictory pursuit. Surely\nthe whole point of authentic leadership is that it eschews \u2018acting\u2019, as Sosik et al\n(2002) assert, authentic leaders in fact do not \u2018act\u2019, they score low in terms of self\nmonitoring (Snyder 1987, Snyder & Gangestad 1986) and they are not focused on\nimpression management (Goffman 1959). However, we would argue that the ability\nto convey a leadership performance which is read as authentic is not necessarily\naccomplished through sheer naivety. If that were the case, authenticity would be\ninept as often as it is masterful. The real question is, how does one create a leadership\n11\nenactment, which in some way expresses something authentic about the self in a given\nsituation, which can consequently be read and interpreted as authentic?\nTo further illustrate the seemingly contradictory nature of the terrain, we offer\nanother example from the Democratic primary election; commentary from The\nLondon Times newspaper on 20 March 2008 in response to Barack Obama\u2019s \u2018A More\nPerfect Union\u2019 speech. Benedict Nightingale writes:\nThere\u2019s astonishingly little of the actor about Barack Obama, and that\u2019s meant as a\ncompliment. He doesn\u2019t soar or reach for rhetorical climaxes. He doesn\u2019t twist his\naudiences\u2019 heartstrings even when he\u2019s talking of matters close to his heart. When he\nspeaks of his wife or his \u2018precious daughters\u2019 there\u2019s no throb in his voice. And does\nthis make him bland or dull? Quite the opposite.\nSomehow he has mastered the art of conveying feeling, strong feeling, without\nseeming emotionally manipulative. He stands there in his sober suit. His voice is\nfirm, his body-language surprisingly still. He makes few, if any, movement with his\nhands or arms. In terms of delivery, he\u2019s as far from the Rev. Jermiah Wright, the old\npreacher he manages to berate without disowning, as it is possible to be. And all this\ncombines to reinforce his basic message: I have a black face, but I am capable of\nrepresenting the nation in all its diversity.\nIndeed, you might almost say that he\u2019s leadership incarnate.\nIn this interpretation the Senator\u2019s delivery is noted for its absence of large\narm movements, moderate voice modulation, and lack of animation associated with\nmore \u2018actorly\u2019 performances. Yet, Obama is seen, by this commentator anyway, as\n\u2018authentic\u2019, as \u2018leadership incarnate\u2019. In fact, Nightingale locates the power of the\n12\nspeech in its moderate tones, Obama\u2019s self presentation in his \u2018sober suit\u2019. How is it\nthat Obama has mastered the capacity to express \u2018strong emotion\u2019, without being\n\u2018emotionally manipulative\u2019\u2014and probably more importantly, without being \u2018dull\u2019 or\n\u2018boring\u2019? We turn to the acting literature for clues as to how such a performance\nmight be generated.\n\u2018Acting towards authenticity\u2019\nModern acting in the West is generally based in Constantin Stanislavski\u2019s\n(1936a; 1936b; 1961) system of acting (often called method acting). In the words of\nthe influential American director Harold Clurman, \u201cIt is the only thoroughgoing\nformulation of the actor\u2019s craft\u201d (1972 p. 145). Acting in the East follows much older\ntraditions such as Kabuki and Noh. However, there is a similarity: \u201cWhen one reads\nthe tracts of the actor Zeami (1363-1444), the Noh theatre \u2018Shakespeare,\u2019 one\nimagines one is reading Stanislavsky in poetic apothegms\u201d (Clurman, 1972 p. 147).\nWhat is the Stanislavski system? Again, we turn to Clurman:\nThe system is a technique, it is not an end in itself. Nor is it a theory. . . . it is\na means whereby a particular artist or group of artists may most authentically\nand completely manifest whatever they wish in the theatre.\u201d (italics in\noriginal, Clurman, 1972 p. 147)\nThe key phrase is \u201cauthentically and completely manifest\u201d. This is not acting\nas pretending to be something or someone you\u2019re not, it is not acting as faking it \u2013 it\nis acting as producing real, authentic behavior on stage.\n13\nThis difference between enacting the external manifestations and having the\ninterior experiences that result in those external manifestations is central to the\nSystem and producing authenticity. It is a difference that we have been aware of\nsince long before Stanislavski\u2019s work. Shakespeare has Hamlet speak of this\ndifference when his mother suggests that he seems to be overly taken with his father\u2019s\ndeath. To which Hamlet replies:\nSeems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\nNor windy suspiration of forc\u2019d breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\nNor the dejected haviour of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed seem,\nFor they are actions that a man might play:\nBut I have that within which passeth show --\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\n(Shakespeare, 1936 p. 1150)\nAs Clurman describes it, \u201cWhen an actor exhibits sorrow or rage, nobility or\nexaltation, without our feeling something of their reality within him, we who employ\nthe vocabulary of the System say he is playing the result: he is demonstrating what he\nwants to believe he is expressing. But unless we are guileless we fail to believe him\nthough his demonstration may be executed with remarkable expertise\u201d (1972 p. 148).\n14\nThe difference between playing the result and actually feeling the experience\nis explained by physiology. Neurophysiology indicates that when we are happy,\nhundreds of different muscles in our face move in various ways resulting in a smile.\nSome of those muscles are voluntary and under our conscious control, and others are\ninvoluntary and we cannot consciously control them. If we smile when we do not\nactually feel happy, only the voluntary muscles respond and the resulting expression\ndiffers from that created when both voluntary and involuntary muscles are involved.\nAs humans adept at reading such nuances in one anothers\u2019 expressions, we\ncan readily distinguish between the real, authentic smile involving both the voluntary\nand involuntary muscles, and the fake smile activated by the voluntary muscles alone\n(Ekman, 2003). Thus to be perceived as authentic, an actor needs to express the\nfeelings and emotional state he really feels, i.e. those congruent with his somatic\nclues. Doing so activates the involuntary muscles as well as those consciously\nactivated when one knows one \u2018should\u2019 be expressing a certain emotion. The\nStanislavski system provides further ideas as to how such an effect can be consciously\nproduced.\nThe Stanislavski System\nStanislavski wrote about the technique by telling the story of an actor as he\nlearns to act (1936a; 1936b) and also offering several specific examples of the system\nbeing used (1961). \u201cThrough the System, actors learn natural laws and how to use\nthem consciously in re-creating human behavior on stage\u201d (Moore, 1984 p. 9).\nHowever, as Moore (1991) writes, \u201cHe did not formulate his final technique in any\nwritten treatise. He did not, by any means, record all of his thoughts on paper; and\n15\nwhat he did write did not satisfy him\u201d ( p. 8). Here then, we are at least two steps\nremoved from Stanislavski\u2019s original intent. Firstly, these techniques were to be\npassed from teacher to student in an embodied fashion, rather than through written\ncommunication as we are attempting here. Secondly, there are obvious limitations to\napplying Stanislavski\u2019s ideas holistically to the leadership domain as they were\ndeveloped for theatre. However, we believe there are sufficient parallels between the\nperformative aspects of leadership (Grint, 2001, Vaill 1989) and theatre to make the\ncomparison valid.\nStanislavski started with the observation that some actors occasionally became\ninspired and produced great performance in which they seemed to actually live the\nexperiences and emotions of the character they were playing. How might this\nphenomenon of inspiration come under conscious control? He discovered that\n\u201cEmotions cannot be stirred directly\u201d (Moore, 1984 p. 12), that is, you cannot simply\ntry to be angry or feel love and produce a believable performance. His key insight\nwas that:\nInternal experiences and their physical expression are unbreakably united.\n\u201cThe first fact,\u201d said Stanislavski, \u201cis that the elements of the human soul and\nthe particles of a human body are indivisible.\u201d The thesis of Stanislavski,\nthat human psychological life\u2014moods, desires, feelings, intentions,\nambitions\u2014is expressed through simple physical actions, has been confirmed\nby such scientists as Ivan Pavlov and I. M. Sechenov. (Moore, 1984 p. 17)\nIn this way, Stanislavski focuses on physical actions. It is important to stress\nthe meaning Stanislavski brings to his understanding of what constitutes physical\naction. For him, rather than being limited to isolated movement, physical actions\n16\nincorporate the intention by which they are fuelled, their purposes, as well as the\nsurrounding circumstances of their manifestation. In short, physical actions\nencompass all of the emotional and intellectual material associated with them. In this\nway, Stanislavski works to overcome the tendency we have in the West to sever the\nexternally active physical body from its interior life of thinking and feeling. His\nsystem highlights the inseparability of inner and outer bodily being, and the critical\nnature of that relationship in authentic enactment. In her text on auditioning, Joanna\nMerlin elaborates this point when she writes:\nWhat is an actable choice? It is a choice, rooted in the text, that incites you to\nact, a choice that marshals your intuition, imagination, senses, and reason to\nhelp bring the text and the character to life. An unactable choice maybe\nbased on a correct idea or a reasonable interpretation of the text, but it is\nacting from the neck up; talking\u2014yada, yada, yada\u2014based on a rational\nanalysis and knowledge of the text. It might get you an \u201cA\u201d in a college\nessay but it won\u2019t get you the part. (Merlin, 2001 p. 42)\nThe importance of the intermingling of internal and external aspects of a given\nmoment illustrates Wilson\u2019s (1988) point about the body\u2019s role in mediating somatic,\ninternally generated \u2018body knowledge\u2019 and more externally generated symbolic\nknowledge of the self in context. In order to be read as authentic, enactments,\nwhether by actors or by leaders, must convey congruence between the two as\nexpressed through the topography of the body. Stanislavski\u2019s approach to enabling\nactors to bring that mediation into more conscious awareness evolved through three\nstages; memory of emotions, the \u2018magic if\u2019 and physical problems (Clurman 1972).\n17\nWe introduce each here, briefly considering their implications for leaders as well as\nactors.\nMemory of Emotions.\nThe primary source from which an actor can draw to create the emotional\nworld of their character is their own life. As Shurtleff tells us:\nAnd what does acting turn out to be? Using your own self. Working from\nwhat\u2019s inside you. Not being someone else, but being you in different\nsituations and contexts. Not escaping you, but using yourself naked and\nexposed up there on the stage or on the silver screen. (1978 p. 3)\nIn an analogous way, the authentic a leader must draw from the material of his\nor her own life. In the first instance, this involves \u2018connecting with themselves\u2019\n(Linver & Mengert, 1994), which means drawing from the emotional memories and\ntheir related somatic clues intertwined with key events of one\u2019s life. Working from\nthe authentic leadership perspective, Sparrowe (2005) similarly points to the power of\nrecalling and articulating the narrative of one\u2019s life and particular key incidents in the\ngeneration of one\u2019s leadership identity. This emotion memory must be specific and\ndetailed enough to bring back the physical feelings of the emotion. When the\nmemories restimulate the feelings of the emotion, others can see that we are\nexperiencing emotions (unless we do a great deal of work to conceal them, which is\nseldom completely successful (Stone et al 2000)).\nThe demonstration of emotion can be subtly expressed, as long as it connects\nwith a resonating truth of one\u2019s own experience. Returning to the example of\n18\nObama\u2019s \u2018A More Perfect Union\u2019 speech, perhaps the power of its delivery is in the\nway it quietly connects with truths that are central to who the Senator knows of\nhimself and his experience. He doesn\u2019t have to \u2018act into\u2019 what he is saying, the\ncongruence of his message and its delivery connects with listeners at that kinaesthetic\nlevel of shared human experience of how the kinds of things he is talking about can be\nembodied.\nOf course, experiencing real emotions and letting others see them as such\ninvites vulnerability. Witness the media commentary which berated Hillary Clinton\nfor her expression of weakness, just as it applauded the authenticity of its expression.\n\u2018Hillary\u2019s Tears\u2019 highlights the paradoxical nature of this territory\u2014in exposing your\n\u2018true self\u2019 you become vulnerable, even as the possibility for deeper connection with\nothers is born.\nMagic If.\nThe next stage of the development of the System expanded the focus beyond\nthe actor to the surrounding context with the \u2018magic if\u2019. Although Stanislavski\nbelieved that no sane person could actually believe the events on stage were real, they\ncould act \u2018as if\u2019 they were. The \u2018magic if\u2019 also allows for adaptations or substitutions\nbetween events which evoke powerful emotional memories. For example, if a\ncharacter is embarrassed by something that the actor doesn\u2019t find embarrassing, the\nactor can substitute a moment in their own life which did evoke embarrassment, and\nact \u2018as if\u2019 that were happening instead.\nOne critical way that actors use the \u2018magic if\u2019 is to be in communion with the\nother actors on stage. For Stanislavski it is critical that an actor always be in\n19\ncommunion \u2013 usually with the other actors, but occasionally just with themselves. It\nis just not believable when an actor has gaps in relating to others (such as when they\nstop paying attention while others are talking and think about their own next line).\nInstead, the actor acts \u2018as if\u2019 they don\u2019t know what others on stage will say, which\nenables them to be more present and in communion with the other actors. Moore\nexpresses it this way:\nTo be in communion with another person on stage means to be aware of that\nperson\u2019s presence, to make sure that he hears and understands what you tell\nhim and that you hear and understand what he tells you. That means mutual\ninfluence. (Moore, 1984 p. 35)\nBeing in communion means being in relationship (Halpern & Lubar, 2003)\nwith others, authentically connecting and being influenced by and influencing others\non a moment by moment basis. It is this sense of communion that we take as being\ncritical for leadership authenticity. To be in communion with others on a moment by\nmoment basis requires being present in the moment. Although, for many of us not\nbeing present in the moment (as we are occupied with thoughts of the past or future)\nis completely natural, it does not come across as authentic. It is only when we are\npresent and in communion that others experience us as being authentic.\nPhysical Action.\nStanislavski\u2019s System culminates in the technique of physical action. As\nMoore describes it:\nComment [C1]: Feels slightly\nawkward, but I can\u2019t come up with a\nway of smoothing it, can you?\n20\n...every nuance of emotion is connected with a particular physical action.\nTherefore that action must be carefully selected on the basis of the play\u2019s\ncircumstances. It must be the indispensable physical action connected with\nthe emotion which the actor must bring out (Moore, 1984 p. 19).\nThe technique involves identifying the action, or speech act (Austin, 1962;\nSearle, 1969) that is expressed with the text and circumstances of the play. For\nexample, one character might say to another \u201cI missed you last night.\u201d The action\nassociated with the line could express a reprimand, or friendly interest, or any number\nof other options depending on the situation. Identifying the right action for the part\nrequires analysis, experimentation in the rehearsal process and an actor\u2019s sense of\nartistry and intuition.\nIn order to discover all of the aspects associated with an action, actors play\nwith different actions during rehearsal and learn about the obstacles inherent in\nportraying actions in certain ways. For example, if an actor\u2019s action is to get away\nfrom another character in a scene they could simply walk off the stage, unless there is\nan obstacle that keeps them there, such as needing something the other character can\ngive them. An actor may want to show the other character that they love them, but\nalso be afraid of being rejected. This process is akin to that of finding the competing\ncommitments (Kegan & Lahey, 2001) inherent within the complexity of human\nmotivation. The way in which such \u2018living contradictions\u2019 (Whitehead & McNiff\n2006) are embodied and conveyed actually leads to more authentic enactments. We\nsuggest that similarly, leaders must find ways of expressing the often contradictory\naspects of how they are feeling within certain contexts in order to be perceived as\nacting authentically. We will examine this idea in more detail as part of our theory of\nembodied authentic leadership.\nComment [C2]: Do we need this\nparagraph? Not sure it adds to overall\nargument?\n21\nIn addition to unearthing the complexity and living contradictions inherent in\nthe portrayal of believable characters, actors experiment with different actions in\norder to find those which bring the part, the play, and the entire theatre alive. Some\nactions are uninteresting or disconnecting for the audience. This is not due to their\nbeing good or ethical, but rather to their capacity to resonate with the audience in a\npowerful way. Shurtleff describes making these powerful choices:\n.. finding a reason to express your fullest feelings deeply and importantly,\nsaying yes to the possibilities that are within a relationship. Human beings,\nfortunately, don\u2019t operate out of reason. What motivates human beings are\ndreams. ... This book is about finding the dream in you and learning to put it\nright up there on the stage, where everybody can see (Shurtleff, 1978 p. 5).\nThis quote points to an aspect of authentic leadership which we have not\ntouched on before, but which is related to the role of symbolic, interactionist knowing\nin the enactment of the \u2018true self\u2019. That is the notion of \u2018the dream\u2019. Leader-like\nactions are tied to the motivations and dreams of the group which they lead (Gardner,\n1995). Authentic leaders, whose dreams may be authentic to themselves, but which\nare not shared by those who would follow them, will soon find themselves being\nauthentic individuals, not necessarily authentic leaders. Authenticity is inextricably\nlinked with notions of identity\u2014and in the context of leadership, the salience of that\nidentity must be strong for both the leader as an individual, and importantly for the\ncollective identity of followers as well (Reicher et al 2005).\nWe suggest that these three stages of Stanislavski\u2019s system provide analogous\ninsight into how embodied authentic leadership might be created. We now turn to\n22\nconsider how they might contribute to a theory of how embodied authentic leadership\nis created.\nA THEORY OF EMBODIED AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP\nDrawing upon the issues discussed in the first part of the paper on authentic\nleadership and in the second part on method acting, we suggest that creating\nembodied authentic leadership incorporates three key aspects: 1) Self-Exposure, 2)\nRelating, and 3) Leaderly Choices. We introduce and discuss each in turn.\nSelf Exposure.\nJust as an actor must feel real emotions in order to express them in a way that\nwill be perceived as authentic, similarly a leader must be attentive to the somatic clues\nof their body as they experience situations, and then choose how to express them. We\nhighlight the role of choicefulness in this process, because authentic leadership is\nbased not only on those inner feelings and emotions, but on the requirements of the\ncontext within which one is enacting leadership. For example, when a military officer\nleads troops into battle he is almost certainly feeling a complex set of emotions, which\ncould include fear, resolve, a sense of duty, courage, connection to the soldiers, and so\non. As a leader he can choose to express the resolve and courage, while also\nrecognizing his feelings of fear and anxiety.\nWithout self knowledge he may be unaware of just how afraid he really is and\neven though he tries to present himself as being courageous, the fear will likely be\nvery clear to the men. As Merleau Ponty (1962) tells us, there is \u2018no hidden self,\nentirely hidden and separated from other people; we are \u2018primordially expressive\u2019.\n23\nFurthermore, although someone with very little self knowledge may appear authentic\nas they involuntarily express their feelings, they are like Stanislavksi\u2019s inspired actors\nwho cannot control and reproduce their performance. Finding ways of expressing\nsomething of the cocktail of emotions present will add depth and authenticity to how\nleadership is embodied.\nAlthough the potential drawbacks of expressing the \u2018true self\u2019 have been\nnoted earlier in this paper, a growing number of studies point to the importance of\nleaders expressing their vulnerabilities in order to more fully engage with and\nestablish trust from followers (Luthans & Avolio 2003, Quinn et al 2000, Avolio et al\n2004). In particular, through revealing vulnerability, it is suggested that followers can\nmore readily identify with leaders, resulting in more positive and influential\nrelationships between leaders and followers (Kark & Shamir 2002, Kark et al 2003).\nThis observation leads to the next aspect of embodied authentic leadership, relating.\nRelating.\nRelating starts with the capacity to be present in the here and now, but extends\nbeyond that. It includes Stanislaviski\u2019s communion with self, others, and with the\nparticular context and situation as it presents itself in a given moment. Like the\n\u2018vulnerability\u2019 terrain highlighted earlier, this requirement to relate to the specific\ncontext raises contradictions for the enactment of leadership. By its nature, leadership\noften requires movement into situations beyond the status quo (Bass 1985). How\ndoes a leader relate in an authentic way to a situation that they have never been in\nbefore? How is it possible to enact a desired leadership self (perhaps modelled on\nsignificant others), in never- before-encountered circumstances?\n24\nThis is the issue Ibarra (1999) presents in her study of young consultants and\nbankers moving beyond technical roles to more corporate, leadership positions. In the\npopulation studied, three strategies for enacting \u2018provisional\u2019 selves were employed,\ntwo of which were based on role modelling more senior managers\u2019 ways of being.\nHowever, Stanislavski\u2019s system offers another strategy, that of working with the\n\u2018magic if\u2019 in such situations.\nFor example, imagine a faculty member who has decided they want to be a\nleader and one of their primary leadership values is creating mutuality with their\ncolleagues. Then imagine a colleague making a remark in a Departmental meeting\nthat invokes a strong negative reaction in our would-be leader. Intervening in such an\nincident is uncharted ground, but the faculty member has rehearsed for such an event\nand has a generic script, based on the advice of a colleague that says, \u201cnarrate what is\nhappening for you and inquire what is happening for others.\u201d\nThe faculty member attempts to do so, stumbling along, feeling awkward and\ninauthentic as she attempts to be open about how she is feeling (without blaming the\nother faculty member) and inquires into how her colleague is feeling. In enacting this\nintervention, our would-be leader keeps in mind the \u2018magic if\u2019 \u2013 \u2018what would I do if I\nbelieved the other person truly had the best interests of the department in mind?\u2019 By\nnarrating her own feelings, our leader stays present in the moment and connected to\nthe context. By inquiring she attempts to deepen the relationship with the colleague\nthat has evoked the negative reaction. Although she feels awkward, many of the other\nfaculty perceive her as embodying an authentic reaction to the situation, which also\nconnects to the would-be leader\u2019s deeply held values about creating mutuality\namongst colleagues.\n25\nThis example points to another paradoxical quality of embodied authentic\nleadership\u2014that it does not always feel comfortable. In Ibarra\u2019s (1999) study cited\nearlier, the third, and least successful strategy employed by young consultants and\nbankers moving to managerial positions was that of \u2018being true to oneself\u2019. In\nessence, this meant that rather than mimicking more senior managers, they only relied\non behaviours which they recognised as being part of their existing repertoire. Ibarra\nattributes the relative lack of advancement on the part of these people to their acting\nin accordance with their feelings of immaturity and inexperience, rather than in\naccordance with their current situation and possible selves which could ideally\noperate within the changed situation. The problem was further exacerbated by the\nensuing limited growth of their behavioural repertoires.\nThose who \u2018tried out\u2019 other ways of behaving were in the long run more\nsuccessful at finding ways of being which were not experienced as \u2018fake\u2019, but which\nalso incorporated new ways of being. She writes;\nBy rehearsing these clumsy, often ineffective, sometimes inauthentic selves they\nlearned more about the limitations and potential of their repertoires and thus began to\nmake decisions about what element to keep, refine, reject or continue to search for\n(779).\nSimilarly, we would argue that equating authenticity with a felt sense of\ncomfort or familiarity limits the potential for developing a dynamic and robust\nenactment of the \u2018true self\u2019, which necessarily needs to grow in response to changing\ncircumstances and situational demands. This leads to the third aspect of our theory of\nembodied leadership, which incorporates a fuller appreciation of the \u2018leaderly\u2019 aspects\nof authentic leadership.\n26\nLeaderly Choices.\nHere we suggest that an individual can reveal their \u2018true self\u2019 and relate well to\nothers and the particular moment, but still not be perceived as an authentic leader\nbecause they are not experienced as embodying leadership in a way perceived by the\ngroup to be \u2018leaderly\u2019. This dynamic was alluded to in the discussion of \u2018dreams\u2019,\nwhen the importance of individual and group \u2018identity\u2019 was highlighted.\nFundamentally, a leader embodies the identity story of the group (Gardner 1995) and\nacts in ways that excite others to connect to the leader and follow him or her.\nAccording to Grint (2001) leadership involves the art of articulating a group\u2019s\nidentity, framing a narrative of who they are and how they have come to be, as well as\nwhere they are going. This identification in some way also prescribes the actions\nwhich a leader can embody and still be accepted as leader of a group.\nFor example, in her study of the Australian woman police commissioner,\nChris Nixon, Sinclair (2005b) points to the public outcry that occurred as a result of\nNixon marching in a Gay Rights March. Although her affiliation to Gay Rights was a\ndeeply held, authentic connection on Nixon\u2019s part, in subsequent years she refrained\nfrom marching. For the particular constituency of which she was a leader, supporting\nthe march through her physical presence was not seen to be \u2018leaderly\u2019. Therefore, she\nchose, in that instance, to find other ways of supporting the movement, which still\nenabled her to express her authentic connection, but also enabled her to retain her\nleadership role within her particular constituency.\nCONCLUSIONS AND AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH\n27\nIn this paper we have discussed the centrality of embodiment to the creation of\nauthentic leadership on the part of leaders, as well as the experience of authentic\nleadership on the part of followers. Producing embodied authentic leadership, we\u2019ve\nsuggested, is not a straightforward process of merely \u2018expressing one\u2019s true self\u2019.\nInstead, it involves the balancing and resolution of paradoxes and tensions, many of\nwhich have their origin in bodily and unconscious processes. For instance, a leader\nmay authentically be experiencing fear and uncertainty, as well as excitement and\nhope in the face of organisational catastrophe. Enacting one\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 in such\nsituations calls for leaders to balance how they might express something of the\ncomplexity of their competing emotional and bodily reactions in a way which is\nexperienced as \u2018leaderly\u2019 for those looking for guidance in those situations.\nSimilarly, enacting one\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 necessarily places the leader in a\nvulnerable arena, with the corresponding benefits and difficulties associated with such\npotential insecurity. How does a leader maintain such a position, while\nacknowledging that in doing so, they may leave themselves open to attack? Perhaps\nthe greatest challenge to embodying authentic leadership is faced as leaders resolve\nthe tensions that will occur between their individual, truly felt commitments and the\nidentity needs of the group which they lead.\nOur account presents a myriad of opportunities for empirical research to test\nits applicability to the experience of lived leadership as well as to investigate and\ndevelop its theoretical claims. As a starting point, we would be keen to understand\nmore about the ways in which leaders who are perceived to be \u2018authentic\u2019 actually\nexperience themselves at a somatic level of awareness. What are the strategies they\nemploy for resolving and expressing conflicting emotions? What do they attend to in\n28\nthe external environment which allows them to embody their commitments in a way\nthat is not experienced by others as \u2018impression management\u2019?\nFrom the perceivers\u2019 orientation, it would be interesting to assess how\nfollowers make aesthetically based assessments of their experiences of leaders. How\ndo they differentiate between authentic and inauthentic leadership performances on an\naesthetic basis? And perhaps most importantly, what affect does embodied authentic\nperformance have on them?\nWe also suggest that there are implications for leadership development. There\nis a growing industry in using theatre for leadership development (e.g. Halpern &\nLubar 2003) which, although often very successful, generally lacks a well developed\ntheoretical basis. This work could be the start of a theoretical understanding that\ncould be used to assess and develop theatre-based leadership development. As such,\nit perhaps offers us another small step in understanding the arts of leadership (Grint\n2001).\nFundamentally, we hope the ideas within this paper stimulate further research\nand discussion in this potentially rich, but inherently paradoxical aspect of leadership.\nOur intention is certainly not to produce a \u2018step-by-step guide\u2019 to creating authentic\nleaders. Rather we wish to describe and attend to a way of being in the world which\nholds the power to inspire, encourage and motivate others through its true, yet elusive\nquality.\n29\nReferences\nAustin, J.
