In so doing, it is suggested that\nexecutives contribute more positively to the development of the groups\u2019 of which they are a\npart by being more adaptive and responsive to changes in their surrounding context.\nPage 3 of 14\n1.0 Introduction\nIn this article the authors starting premise is that anyone who presumes to step into a leadership role\ncan learn to distribute and rotate the tasks of leadership, helping create and develop groups to solve\norganisational problems they would find difficult to solve alone. The purpose of this article is to\npresent leadership in terms of complimentary roles, with choice of role being dependent upon\ncontext. The objective in doing so is to make the reader aware of the roles available, and the\nchanging relative importance of those roles as a group develops. The establishment of roles within\na group is dependent upon a measure of self-discovery on the part of its members, combined with a\nperception of both the group\u2019s and wider organisation\u2019s needs as a whole, Sheard (2007), Sheard et\nal (2010).\nIn this article the concepts advanced comprise an extension to a branch of the self development\nschool of leadership known as the \u201cfunctional\u201d approach to leadership. The functional approach to\nleadership focuses on the ability of an individual to influence, and be influenced by, a group in the\nimplementation of a common task (Bass, 1985; Graen, 1976; Graen & Scandura, 1987; House,\n1977). In order for leadership responsibilities to be met, certain functions need to be performed\nwith a function being defined as what you do as contrasted with what you are or what you know\n(Adair, 2003: 36). Aspects of the current study relating to group development and role theory are\nrespectively extensions theory reported by Tuckman (1965) and Parsons (1951).\n2.0 The Study\nThe inquiry into the extent to which a role-based perspective can provide insight into how\nleadership within a group can be shared and rotate was undertaken within a manufacture of rotating\nturbomachinery. The longitudinal study that underpins this articles has been cured out over ten\nyears and respectively employed ethnography, action research and collaborative inquiry\nmethodologies (Sheard & Kakabadse 2002; 2006; 2007).\nPage 4 of 14\nQualitative inquiry uses various techniques in working to capture the nuances and complexity of the\nsocial situation under study (Flick, 1998; Johnson & Harris, 2002). In the current inquiry the social\nsituation under study is the groups\u2019 executives form. Complexity of the social situations of interest\nis the mechanism by which executives share and rotate leadership within those groups.\n3.0 The Six Stages of Role Rotation\nIn this article the authors contemplate leadership in terms of four roles, and group development in\nterms of six stages of group development. Executives consciously choose to adopt one of the roles\navailable, and attempt to remain aware of the stage a group has reached though its development.\nContemplating leadership in terms of role and group development in terms of stage facilitates the\nrotation of leadership within a group, and as a consequence the progression of a group though the\nstages of its development. Before considering how leadership rotates amongst group members\nhowever, it is first necessary to clarify why it is reasonable to conceptualise leadership in terms of\nrole and group development in terms of stages.\n3.1 Group Development\nOver the last five decades, scholars studying group behavior have advocated various models of\ngroup development and whilst these models share some similarities, they also differ quite\nsignificantly from each other (Chimambaram & Bostrom, 1996). The most widely accepted class of\ngroup development models\u2019 is, however, the linear progressive models that advocate a group\ndevelopment sequence. The concept of a group development sequence separates out two aspects of\ngroup functioning; the task activity a group is undertaking and the process of a group\u2019s life. A\ndevelopment sequence focuses on the process of group life, asserting that a common development\nsequence exists for all groups. Different scholars advocate different stages in a group\u2019s\ndevelopment, however the most widely accepted comprises five (Tuckman, 1965; Tuckman &\nJensen, 1977):\nPage 5 of 14\n(1) Orientation \/ testing \/ dependence.\n(2) Conflict.\n(3) Group cohesion.\n(4) Functional role-relatedness.\n(5) Individual loss and mourning.\nThese five stages may be labelled mobilisation, confrontation, coming together, behaving as one\nand mourning the past. During the mobilisation stage group members get to know each other and\nestablish more personable relationships. During the confrontation stage conflict happens. Conflict\ncould emerge over rival leadership challenges or simply because of interpersonal behaviour. The\ngroup could split at this stage. Emerging with a single leader, the group moves into the coming\ntogether stage. Here norms of behaviour and group cohesiveness are established. New group\nstandards are set for members and roles are determined. The behaving as one stage occurs when\nmembers start performing tasks together. Role clarity has been established and members are now\nworking together in a cooperative and complimentary manor. The mourning the past stage occurs\nas members realise that the group is about to complete the task for which it was originally created.\nThey feel a sense of loss at the imminent destruction of the social system that the group has\nbecome.\nThe concept of a linear development sequence in small groups is important as it establishes the\nexistence of generic stages through which all groups pass. During the course of their research\nhowever (Sheard & Kakabadse, 2004), the authors have observed that the vast majority of groups\ndo not pass smoothly through the stages of a linear group development sequence. In practice\nindividuals\u2019 opt-out, groups regress and in many cases never perform. During the course of their\nresearch, the authors recognised that a linear group development sequence could more usefully be\nconsidered in terms of a process, specifically a process with two breakdown points.\nPage 6 of 14\nThe first breakdown point occurs as a group attempts to negotiate the transition out of the\nmobilisation and into the confrontation stage. The breakdown occurs as the extent of the non-\nshared assumptions between members becomes clear and each individual asks themselves \u201cdo I\nagree with what this group is being asked to do?\u201d Not everyone will agree, and some will opt out.\nThe second breakdown point occurs as a group attempt to negotiate the transition out of the coming\ntogether and into the behaving as one stage. Individuals ask themselves \u201cdo I accept the role I will\nhave to play to work in this group?\u201d The sudden realisation of what working in the group will\nactually mean in practical terms results in some instinctively answering \u201cno\u201d. As a consequence\nthe group will slip back into conflict, entering a new stage one step forward, two steps back\n(Kakabadse, 1987a; 1987b; Sheard & Kakabadse, 2004).\nThe one step forward, two steps back stage models the regressive behaviour so often seen in groups\nas in order to leave it all must agree to do so. A reason why many groups never perform to their\nfull potential is that the group members do not wish it to. Many groups never progress beyond the\none step forward, two steps back stage, and that is why they perform so badly compared to the\npotential that capability of individual members would imply the group to be capable of. By\nidentifying two breakdown points and an additional stage, one step forward, two steps back stage,\nthe authors have been able to create an \u201cintegrated\u201d group development process, Figure One.\nIntegrated on the basis that it identifies all stages of, and breakdown points within, a group\u2019s\ndevelopment:\nStage One: Mobilising.\nStage Two: Confrontation.\nStage Three: Coming together.\nStage Four: One step forward, two steps back.\nStage Five: Behaving as one.\nStage Six: Mourning the past.\nPage 7 of 14\nTake in Figure One\n3.2 Leadership Roles\nWhen first working with executives and boards of directors the authors were consistently surprised\nby the poor performance of the groups involved given the potential capability of their members.\nTypically the groups studied would comprise members who were both highly intelligent and hard\nworking. Despite these necessary attributes for success, the majority of groups performed well\nbelow the level anticipated.\nOver time the authors observed that amongst those groups that did perform, a common\ncharacteristic was present: members divided leadership responsibility into blocks of tasks. As the\nauthors studied the highest performing groups, it became apparent that members were not only\ndividing the tasks of leadership, but were also adapting their behaviour. In so doing members were\ncoordinating their leadership action, with specific \u201cbundles\u201d of behaviour being associated with\ngeneric sets of tasks enabling members to \u201cknow\u201d who should do what without the need for\nextensive debate (Sheard & Kakabadse, 2007).\nThe authors realised that members were not just adapting behaviour in response to others who\nhappened to be in one particular group. They were choosing to adopt bundles of behaviours that\ncould be characterised as \u201croles\u201d that were generic across multiple groups with different\nmemberships. The authors realised that just as a group passes through generic stages of\ndevelopment that are applicable to any group, so group members adopt roles that are also applicable\nin any group. The concept of group members choosing roles complimentary to those of other\nmembers therefore separates out two aspects of group functioning; the task activity a group is\nundertaking and the group\u2019s leadership.\nPage 8 of 14\nHaving recognised the existence of generic roles, the authors focused on characterising them. Four\ndistinctly different, yet complimentary, roles emerged from the research, characterised using the\nmetaphors king, tactician, elder and warrior. A group\u2019s king is defined as the member who is\naccountable for delivery of a group\u2019s goal. A group\u2019s tactician is defined as the publicly appointed\nleader of the group who is responsible for delivery of its goal. An elder is a group member who\nundertakes to build a network of relationships with other group members. A group\u2019s warriors\nderive their legitimacy to lead other group members from the formal allocation of responsibility to\ndeliver a specific task by the group\u2019s tactician.\nWhen characterising the four roles the authors observed that the king and warriors consciously\nchoose to give their attention to the group\u2019s goal. In contrast the tactician and elders consciously\nchoose to give their attention to the establishment of good working relationships within the group.\nAs such the king and warriors were focused on goal attainment in contrast to the tactician and\nelders who were focused on relationship building.\nAt the same time elders and warriors were unconsciously attracted to issues within the group. In\ncontrast the king and tactician were seeing the bigger picture as a consequence of their unconscious\ninterest in the group\u2019s impact on the wider organisation. As such elders and warriors were oriented\ntowards the group in contrast to the king and tactician who were oriented towards the wider\norganisation.\nIt is the combination of focus (goal attainment versus relationship building) and orientation (intra\ngroup verse inter group) that define the four roles of leaders, king, tactician, elder and warrior,\nFigure Two. The king, tactician, elder and warrior roles collectively cover the need to attain a goal\nand build relationship plus work both within a group and the wider organisation. Any single\nPage 9 of 14\nindividual would find it difficult to do all four. However, if different individuals choose different\nroles then it is possible for a group to do what no individual within it could do alone.\nTake in Figure Two\n3.3 Role Rotation\nWhilst acknowledging that there are actions leaders take that spring from a flash of genius, the\nauthors\u2019 research has identified that the most effective leaders focus on eight key functional areas\n(Sheard & Kakabadse 2004):\n\uf0b7 Clearly defining goals.\n\uf0b7 Priorities.\n\uf0b7 Roles & Responsibilities.\n\uf0b7 Self awareness.\n\uf0b7 Group dynamics.\n\uf0b7 Communication.\n\uf0b7 Context.\n\uf0b7 Infrastructure.\nThe conceptual foundations of the eight key functional areas, referred to as \u201ckey factors\u201d are rooted\nwithin the work of Adair (1986). It has been postulated by Adair (1986: 112) that \u201cgroups\u201d at the\nmost generic level share certain common needs.\nDuring the course of their research (Sheard & Kakabadse, 2006) the authors have characterised the\nfour roles in terms of the relative importance of the eight key factors, Figure Three. In so doing\ninsight into what group members should do when adopting each role is provided. The authors also\ncharacterised the six stages of a group\u2019s development in terms of the relative importance of the\neight key factors (Sheard & Kakabadse, 2004), Figure Three. In so doing insight is provided into\nwhat is important to a group as it progresses through its development.\nTake in Figure Three\nPage 10 of 14\nIt is the duel characterisation of roles and stages in terms of the importance of key factors that in\nturn provides insight into how leadership should rotate. As an individual joins a group they have a\nchoice of roles, with choice being dependent upon their reading of context. Having chosen a\nparticular role, the key factors associated with that role become the focus of their action. The\nimportance of those key factors changes as a group passes though its development process. By\nremaining aware of the stage a group has reached, the changing importance of key factors\nassociated with the role adopted is highlighted. It is insight into the changing relative importance\nof key factors associated with the role adopted as a group progresses though its development\nsequence that identifies how leadership should rotate and to whom.\n4.0 Conclusions\nA new role-based leadership framework and its practical application are presented. Leadership is\ndescribed in terms of four complimentary roles, king, warrior, tactician and elder with each group\nmember adopting one of the four roles. None are characterised as adopting purely follower roles.\nOnce the responsibilities and tasks of leadership are shared, then the group amongst whom they are\nshared must work together.\nA group\u2019s development is described in terms of six stages, mobilising, confrontation, coming\ntogether, one step forward two steps back, behaving as one and mourning the past. The relative\nimportance of each role at each stage of a group\u2019s development is clarified by characterising both\nin terms of eight key factors. The duel characterisation provides insight into which roles are most\nimportant at each stage of a group\u2019s development, clarifying whom leadership should rotate from\nand too.\nPage 11 of 14\nReferences\nAdair, J.
