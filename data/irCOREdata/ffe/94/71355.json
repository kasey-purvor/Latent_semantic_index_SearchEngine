Generally speaking, the theory is committed to basing grammatical concepts upon more general cognitive principles. In the case of summary and sequential scanning, independent evidence is lacking, but Langacker argues that the distinction should nonetheless be accepted as it buys us considerable theory-internal explanatory power. For example, dynamic prepositions, to-infinitives and participles (e.g., into, to enter, entered) are distinguished from finite and bare verbs in terms of summary vs. sequential scanning. In this paper, we try to show that various theory-internal and theory-external arguments do not seem to support the two scanning modes.

Generally speaking, the theory is committed to basing grammatical concepts upon more general cognitive principles. In the case of summary and sequential scanning, independent evidence is lacking, but Langacker argues that the distinction should nonetheless be accepted as it buys us considerable theory-internal explanatory power. For example, dynamic prepositions, to-infinitives and participles (e.g., into, to enter, entered) are distinguished from finite and bare verbs in terms of summary vs. sequential scanning. In this paper, we try to show that various theory-internal and theory-external arguments do not seem to support the two scanning modes. In particular, we offer a detailed examination of causatives (e.g., get, make) and argue that their complementation patterns are difficult to reconcile with differences in scanning. We conclude that the status of, and need for, summary and sequential scanning in (Cognitive) grammar is doubtful, especially if grammar is approached from the viewpoint of the language learner\/user.

Consid er the ex amples in (1) (see Croft and  Cruse \n2004: 5 6  and  T almy 2000: 3 14): \n(1)  a. T om is near J ohn. \nb. J ohn is near T om. \nc. T he bike is near the house. \nd . ? ? T he house is near the bike.  \n(1a) and  (1b) seem to show that near is a symmetrical preposition. \nIts trajector and  land mark, i.e. Tom and  J ohn respectively in (1a), \ncan be swapped  around  as in (1b) and  the resulting sentence is still \nperfectly acceptable. H owever, if the same operation is performed  \non (1c), the result is, und er normal circumstances, an awkward  \nsentence. T he contrast in acceptability between (1c) and  (1d ) can \nbe motivated  on ground s of figure\/ground  organisation. A ll other \nthings being eq ual, we select a smaller object (e.g. a bike rather \nthan a house in (1c-d )) as figure, that is (roughly) as the focus of \nour attention (see U ngerer and  Schmid  1996 : Chapter 4 for an \noverview on figure selection; see Langacker 1987: 125 , especially \nnote 12, on the d ifference between figure and  focus of attention). \nA mong the linguistically relevant cognitive abilities invoked  by \nCognitive Grammar are also two mod es of cognitive processing for \nthe structuring of complex  events: summary scanning and  \nseq uential scanning, which pertain to processing rather than \nconceived  or objective time (Langacker 1987: 144\u2013145 , 248\u2013\n249).1 In other word s, they concern our conceptualisation of time \nind epend ently of how things might occur in the \u201c real\u201d  world . W e \nwill now move to a closer ex amination of the two types of \nscanning and  their crucial importance for the \u201c architecture\u201d  of \nCognitive Grammar. \nSuppose we have a complex  scene, that is an event mad e up of \nd ifferent configurations (or component states) over time. F or \nex ample, the verb enter evokes a complex  scene in that it d enotes \n(or \u201c profiles\u201d  in Cognitive Grammar terminology) the movement \nof an entity (the trajector) toward s a location (the land mark) \nresulting in the trajector\u2019s end ing up insid e the land mark. T he \nevent is d iagrammed  schematically in F igure 1 below (the d otted  \nlines ind icate referential id entity between the trajectors\/land marks \nof the component states; the three d ots ind icate that only a \nrepresentative subset of all component states has been d epicted ). \n3Cognitive Grammar claims that an event (like enter) is scanned \nsequentially when the conceptualiser (i.e. the language user) views \nthe different facets of the complex scene successively (as in a \nmotion picture). Further, when a relation involves sequential \nscanning we say that the relation has a positive temporal profile\nwhich is indicated by the heavy TIM E  line in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 \nB y contrast, summary scanning obtains when the different facets of \nthe complex scene are made available as a single Gestalt (as in a \nphoto). Suppose a ball falls vertically. Sequential scanning for such \nan event is represented in Figure 2a, while the import of a \nsummary scanning construal is depicted in Figure 2b. A short, \nincremental build-up phase precedes the availability of the final \nGestalt.2 In summary scanning the positions occupied by the ball \nover time are superimposed upon each other so that a holistic \nconceptualisation\u2014all positions are activated simultaneously\u2014\nobtains (the downward arrow in the final component is a visual aid \nrepresenting downward motion explicitly). For discussion of the \npresence vs. absence of a temporal profile (heavy vs. light time \narrow) see our description of Figure 5, below. \nFigure 2  \nIn what follows, we will present evidence against (the need to \nposit) the summary vs. sequential scanning distinction. Section 2 \nshows that the two modes of scanning are important  for theory-\ninternal reasons. The distinction between summary and sequential \nscanning buys the Cognitive Grammarian considerable theory-\ninternal explanatory power in that it allows her\/him to distinguish \non semantic grounds between apparently synonymous verbs and \nprepositions (section 2.1). Further, to-infinitives and gerunds are \nalso neatly classified on the basis of semantic criteria alone if the \ntwo modes of scanning are taken into account (section 2.2). \nHowever, the remaining sections of the paper will discuss issues \nthat challenge the value of the summary vs. sequential scanning \ndistinction. Section 3 is a case study on the issue of variation in \ninfinitival complementation patterns with causative verbs. An \nadequate account can be achieved by relying on the well-\nestablished notions of semantic\/syntactic binding (Giv\u00f3 n 1980, \n1990). That is, we argue that scanning would not increase the \n4explanatory power of our analysis and, if it were invoked, would in \nfact raise questions which may turn out to be very difficult or even \nimpossible to answer. Section 4 presents further problems that the \npostulation of summary and sequential scanning faces. In section 5 \nwe propose that the distinctions that scanning is intended to capture \nshould be rethought from the viewpoint of the language \nlearner\/user rather than the professional linguist and that the \nparcelling of some form-function mappings may prove less clear-\ncut than previously assumed. In section 6, finally, we take sides \nwith Taylor (2003a, b), as regards the potentially conflicting dual \nnature of Cognitive Grammar as an epistemic model and a usage-\nbased model. We conclude the paper by showing that Langacker\u2019s \n(2006, p.c.) position on scanning may actually be considerably \nmore sophisticated than his published discussions would seem to \nsuggest, but we argue that usage should be brought to the fore even \nmore than is presently the case.   \n2. Why scanning is needed in Cognitive G rammar \nIn this section, we will argue that the two types of scanning are \nneeded first and foremost for theory-internal reasons, a point which \nis recognised explicitly by Langacker himself but is usually \nignored in the literature (e.g. Croft and Cruse 2004: 53\u201354, Taylor \n2002). The problem here is that theory-internal coherence does not \nnecessarily guarantee a psychologically plausible linguistic theory. \nIn order to validate the distinction between the two scanning modes \nexternal evidence would be desirable \uf8e7 as is indeed commendably \nprovided for other basic theoretical notions in Cognitive Grammar, \nsuch as figure\/ground segregation (cf. section 1, above). \n2.1. Enter vs. into \nAmong the merits of the postulation of sequential and summary \nscanning is the fact that it allows for the distinction between \nprocesses and atemporal relations. In order to appreciate this point \nfully, readers who are only partially familiar with the theory should \nconsider that Cognitive Grammar defines word classes \nsemantically rather than distributionally. Langacker thus assumes \nthat any element (including morphemes such as \u2013 ing, infinitive \nmarker to, etc., which in more traditional theories such as \nGenerative Grammar are considered to have grammatical rather \nthan semantic import) is meaningful. Every linguistic expression is \nanalysed as a pairing of meaning (its semantic pole) and form (its \nphonological pole). \n5The Cognitive Grammar analysis of (the semantic pole of) word \nclasses is summarised diagrammatically in Figure 3 (shaded boxes \nindicate concepts that are possible semantic poles for word classes; \nfor example, entities, unlike things, do not correspond to any \nparticular word class). We start with the very general category of \nentities, which can be divided into things and relations. A thing, a \ntechnical term in Cognitive Grammar, is a set of interconnected \nentities and is the semantic pole of the noun class. For example, the \nnoun team (see Langacker 1987: 197) profiles a set of entities \n(represented in Figure 4a as the dashed boxes connected to each \nother) rather than singling out any constitutive member. The \nemboldened circle visually represents such a set in Figure 4a. \nR elations, by contrast, profile connections between entities (as well \nas the entities themselves), as is shown for two arbitrary entities e1\nand e2 in Figure 4b. R elations can be either processes or atemporal \nrelations. The former involve sequential scanning, that is, they are \nrelations with a positive temporal profile or, to put it differently, \nthey are relations scanned as a sequence of configurations. \nProcesses, depicted schematically in Figure 4c, constitute the \nsemantic pole of verbs (e.g. enter). Atemporal relations have a \n\u201cnull\u201d temporal profile and come in two types: stative relations and \ncomplex atemporal relations. Stative relations involve a single, \nstable configuration through time and correspond to the semantic \npole of adjectives (i.e. stative relations whose trajector is a noun \nand whose landmark is a region on a scale), adverbs (i.e. stative \nrelations whose trajector is a process and whose landmark is a \nregion along a scale), and stative prepositions (such as in, as \nopposed to into). Complex atemporal relations (e.g. into) are made \nup of more than one configuration over time but such \nconfigurations or facets are scanned in summary fashion. \nFigure 3  \nFigure 4\nLangacker (1992: 290) claims that the contrast between sequential \nand summary scanning is needed, among other things, to \ndistinguish between the verb enter and the dynamic preposition \ninto.3 R emember that since word classes are defined semantically \n(rather than distributionally) and since the scenarios evoked by \nenter and the motion preposition into are intuitively similar (i.e. \none entity moves towards another, which is fixed, and ends up \n6inside it), we need a semantic criterion to distinguish between the \ntwo.\n4\n Cognitive Grammar suggests that, whereas enter profiles a \nsequentially scanned relation, into activates summary scanning, i.e. \nthe various facets of the denoted event are made available as a \nsingle Gestalt. A representation of into along the lines of Figure 1 \nand Figure 2b is offered in Figure 5.  \nFigure 5  \nThere are two obvious (related) differences between Figure 1 (i.e. \nthe schema for enter) and Figure 5. First, each configuration in the \nlatter diagram keeps track of the preceding ones as the \nsuperimposed circles are intended to show. Second, the TIME \narrow is not heavy because sequential scanning is suspended: all \nfacets of the motion event are said to be made simultaneously \navailable, i.e. after the build-up phase.  \n2.2. Infinitives \nThe two types of scanning are also recruited to provide a semantic \ncharacterisation of bare infinitives (e.g. enter) vs. to-infinitives (to \nenter) vs. gerunds or \u2013ing forms (e.g. entering). The rationale is \nalways that differences in form must imply differences in meaning. \nWe have already pointed out that bare infinitives are relations \nscanned sequentially. As for to-infinitives, Langacker observes that \nthey are not in fact verbs by my definition \uf8e7 instead they designate \natemporal relations. They nevertheless derive from verbs [ \u2026 ]  More \nspecifically, the process designated by the verb stem functions as the base \nfor the infinitival [ \u2026 ]  predication overall. The semantic value of the \nderivational morphology (to (\u2026 )) resides in the effect it has on the \nprocess introduced by the stem: [ it]  imposes its atemporal profile on the \nprocessual base provided by the stem. (Langacker 2002: 82)\n5\nFinally, \u2013ing forms are also said to be complex atemporal relations. \nStill, \u201cthey differ from infinitivals by construing the component \nstates of the base process as effectively homogenous and profiling \nonly a representative series of the states\u201d Langacker (1987: 249, \nfootnote 3). \nAlthough Langacker\u2019s theory nicely captures the similarities \nexisting between to-infinitives (and \u2013ing forms) and adjectives, \nother researchers have offered alternative analyses and raised \nproblems for Langacker\u2019s model. D uffley (2003) remarks that the \n7contrast in (2) is left unexplained in Langacker\u2019s analysis. While \n(2a) means that John didn\u2019t forget to lock the door but might have \nno recollection of doing so, (2b) means that he was aware of \nhaving locked the door. The difference between the two sentences \nobtains naturally if to infinitives are associated with some \npurposive meaning due to the possible (ultimately etymological) \nrelation between infinitival to and (motion) preposition to.6      \n(2)  a. John remembered to lock the door. \n b. John remembered locking the door. \nA similar point is made by Pelyv\u00e1 s (2006). He claims that \u2013ing\nforms are not necessarily scanned summarily and, in particular, \nthat \u201csince to highlights path and in an abstract sense intention and \npotentiality, its conceptual structure may not be incompatible with \na similar [i.e. non-summary scanning, CB\/WBH] analysis\u201d. He \nalso remarks (note 11) that his suggestion may be supported by the \nfact that modal ought and should are very similar in meaning \nalthough the former takes a to-infinitive and the latter a bare \ninfinitive (one might, however, argue that to is becoming fused \nwith ought and, hence, no real syntactic difference obtains between \nthe two).  \nDuffley (2006) offers yet more criticism, in observing for \ninstance that in the sentences reproduced below the \u2013ing form \nseems more likely to feature sequential than summary scanning \n(i.e. we intuitively play the events of strolling and tearing in our \nminds as \u201cmotion pictures\u201d rather than perceiving them as \n\u201cphotos\u201d, see section 1 above).\n7\n(3) The woman strolling down the beach is my mother. \n(4) I found my little brother tearing my photo album to pieces \nin my bedroom. \nRecent research into infinitival complementation by Hamawand \n(2002, 2003a, 2003b) takes the existence of and distinction \nbetween the two scanning modes for granted.8 By contrast, in his \nanalysis of \u2013ing complements, Egan (in preparation) suggests the \npossibility that there may be another processing mode, which he \ndubs \u201crecursive scanning\u201d. He argues that some \u2013ing patterns, like \n(5) below, cannot be described adequately by invoking either \nsummary or sequential scanning.   \n8(5) I recall her pacing the sitting-room while I am doing my \nhomework, pausing every so often to stand at one of the \nwindows and look down into the busy street below. (BN C \nHD7 1331)9\nIn Langacker\u2019s theory, an \u2013ing process implies that its component \nstates are always construed as homogenous, i.e. indistinguishable \nfrom each other. Egan observes that the \u2013ing event described in (5) \ncannot be considered homogenous or at least invites a non-\nhomogeneous construal because, for example, pauses in the pacing\nevent are explicitly mentioned. He also seems to suggest that \nsequential scanning cannot be resorted to as the scanning mode for \nthe \u2013ing process because only the central portion of the pacing\nevent, rather than its starting and end points as well, is profiled. \n(Incidentally, it should be pointed out that Egan, by conceding the \npossibility that \u2013ing processes may be compatible with sequential \nscanning, is actually relaxing Langacker\u2019s characterisation of \u2013ing\nprocesses. In Langacker\u2019s theory, \u2013ing processes always involve \nsummary scanning alone.) Egan proposes that the type of scanning \ninvolved in the \u2013ing process in (5) is recursive scanning: we are \nsupposed to go through the event in question repeatedly without \nkick-starting it. \nSince Egan\u2019s research is still in progress, it is premature to \ndiscuss it any further, but it should be clear that not all Cognitive \nGrammarians recognise that the two scanning modes may be \nadequate or sufficient to capture the interpretation of \ncomplementation patterns. \nFinally, it should also be observed that there seems to be \ndisagreement in the case of nominals. Remember (see section 2.1) \nthat nominals always involve summary scanning (since they do not \nhave a positive temporal profile by definition). Matlock (2004b), \nhowever, invokes summary and sequential scanning to explain the \ndifferences in acceptability of nominals in fictive motion \nsentences, i.e. sentences like A trail goes through the desert, where \na motion verb is used to describe a static scene (see e.g. Talmy \n2000). She suggests that the difference in acceptability between \n(6a) and (6b) may depend on whether the subject N P\u2019s referent is \nscanned sequentially (see (6b)) or not (see (6a)).   \n(6)   a. ??The cell phone goes from the cup to the book. \n(phone on desk) \nb.  The cell phone goes from the cup to the book. \n9(phone in ad on billboard) \nMatlock argues that a cell phone is not usually scanned \nsequentially (even if it is unusually long) because \u201ca coherent \nwhole can be obtained with just one glance\u201d (2004b: 228), thereby \nexplaining the oddness of (6a). Since (a sufficiently large amount \nof) spatial extension is crucial to the acceptability of fictive motion \nsentences, only reference to the cell phone on a large billboard can \nresult in an acceptable sentence. Although the confirmation of this \nhypothesis is left to future research, we observe again that the \nnotions of summary and sequential scanning are not always used in \naccordance with Langacker\u2019s theory. \n An additional source of potential confusion is the fact that \nLangacker himself distinguishes various types of scanning other \nthan the summary and sequential modes. First of all, scanning is \nsometimes used in the very general sense of the operation \nconnecting the standard and the target in acts of comparison (see \ne.g. Langacker 1987: 102). Second, in discussing spatial bounding \nand shape, Langacker uses the terms \u201cfield scanning\u201d, \u201cexpanse \nscanning\u201d, and \u201cperiphery scanning\u201d (the interested reader is \nreferred to 1987: Ch. 5, section 4). Third, Langacker\u2019s analysis of \nwhat is widely known as fictive motion (see e.g. Matlock 2004a, b; \nTalmy 1983) involves a contrast between perfective and \nimperfective virtual motion, see, respectively, examples (7\u20138) \nbelow (from Langacker 2005: 175): \n(7) The path is rising quickly as we climb. \n(8) The path rises quickly near the top. \nFor these two sentences Langacker provides the following \nschematic characterisations: \nFigure 6  \nWe note that Figure 6a is similar to the visual representation of \nsequential scanning, and that Figure 6b is similar to summary \nscanning (see Figure 2, above). However, Langacker does not \nmake any overt connection with these two scanning modes. \nMoreover, he does not state explicitly what the diagrams portray: \nthe verb rising\/rises alone or the clause as a whole. This is \nproblematic because in terms of summary and sequential scanning \nwe would expect rising to invoke summary scanning, and rises to \n10\nbe scanned sequentially. In our view, which is agnostic as to the \nstatus of summary and sequential scanning, Langacker nonetheless \nmakes an important point in analysing example (7) as implying a \nlocal view, and example (8) as \u201ctak[ing] a global view\u201d of the \nsituation (2005: 176). This is in line with the standard view that the \nprogressive imposes an internal view on an event in that the \ntemporal boundaries of the event are ignored (see e.g. Comrie \n1976: 4; for an earlier expression of the same view see e.g. \nCharleston 1960: 162).10\nFinally, it could be claimed that summary scanning is also \nneeded to distinguish nominalisations of verbs, see e.g. Something \nexploded vs. There was an explosion (Langacker 2002: 98).11 The \nexploding event in the latter sentence is said to be scanned \nsummarily. We agree with Langacker that \u201c[n]ominaliz ing a verb \nnecessarily endows it with the conceptual properties characteristic \nof nouns\u201d (2002: 98) but we would dissociate reification of events \nfrom the question of scanning. This is also done, for example, by \nCroft (2001: 88), who analyses action nominals as action words \nused in the discourse prepositional act of reference, i.e. without \ninvoking summary scanning as defined by Langacker.12     \n2.3 . Theory-internal reasons \nLangacker himself is aware of the somewhat speculative nature of \nhis analysis (1987: 235\u2013254), see also his more recent reiteration \n(1999: 223) that the distinction between summary and sequential \nscanning has not been verified experimentally yet. Nonetheless, \nLangacker (1987) defends his analysis by claiming that summary \nand sequential scanning are primarily needed in order to achieve \ntheory-internal coherence. The relevant passage is worth quoting \n(almost) in toto: \nA hard-nosed linguist will doubtless ask for evidence to support these \nclaims. How can one prove that the conception of a process (hence the \nmeaning of every verb) requires sequential scanning [\u2026]? The request for \njustification is certainly legitimate, but we must take some care that the \nform of the request does not embody methodologically unreasonable \nexpectations. In particular, one cannot reasonably expect or demand the \nexistence of direct empirical evidence that bears on this question alone \nconsidered in isolation from the overall descriptive context in which the \nanalysis of processes is embedded [emphasis ours]: I can no more \nsubstantiate the claim that verbs imply sequential scanning\u2014directly, and \nwithout regard to how the total descriptive system meshes together\n11\n[emphasis ours]\u2014than the proponent of a more fashionable model can \nprove that movement rules leave traces without explicating the function \nof these constructs as part of a much larger theoretical and descriptive \nframework. The absence of direct and conclusive empirical support is \nunfortunate, but no linguistic theory can provide such motivation for all \nits constructs taken individually. (Langacker 1987: 253) \nIndeed, without recourse to summary and sequential scanning, \nif we only relied on semantic considerations independently of \ndistributional facts, it would be less straightforward to distinguish \nbetween, for example, the motion preposition into and the bare \ninfinitive enter (see section 2.1 above, but also section 5 below for \na semantic account that does take distribution into account). \nWe would like to argue that this is not a sufficient reason to \naccept the a priori existence of the two types of scanning without \nsome (direct or indirect) evidence. In order to achieve external \ncoherence, i.e. a psychologically plausible linguistic theory, all \nlinguistically relevant cognitive abilities postulated by Cognitive \nGrammar must be supported by (direct or indirect) independent \nevidence, or at the very least be in principle amenable to \nexperimental verification. In what follows, we try to show that \nsuch support is lacking at present and that various pieces of \nevidence that are available to us, both theory-external and internal, \nrender the postulated distinction less than obviously necessary, and \nperhaps even problematic.  \n3. A case study: V ariation in causative verbs \nThe discussion so far has not referred to much linguistic data, but \nthe linguistic facts themselves suggest that the sequential vs. \nsummary scanning distinction is problematic \uf8e7 at least the way in \nwhich Langacker has related this distinction to the data. \nSpecifically, the suggestion that bare infinitives (usually called \nstems in Langacker\u2019s work) feature sequential scanning while \nmarked (i.e. to-) infinitives involve summary scanning is difficult \nto maintain in the face of verb (or construction) classes where there \nis variation in complementation patterns (see also Pelyv\u00e1s\u2019s 2006 \nobservations mentioned in section 2.2). Let us consider the \nvariation in causative verbs here:\n13\n(9) He had his secretary order some coffee, then closed the \ndoor and sat down behind his desk. (BNC ECK  2589) \n  \n12\n(10) The police got him to confess to the crime. (BNC HX G \n799) \nOn Langacker\u2019s account, in causative constructions such as have or \nmake the bare infinitive caused event is processed by means of \nsequential scanning, while in get, cause, force or persuade the \nlower clause event is accessed through summary scanning. It is \ndifficult to accept Langacker\u2019s proposal especially in the light of \naccounts of the meaning and form of causatives that are less \nresistant to testing against empirical facts. Giv\u00f3n\u2019s (1980, 1990) \ndiscussion, based on the crosslinguistically valid notion of binding, \nis a case in point. Binding relates not only to causatives but also to \n\u201cmodality verbs\u201d (want, succeed, start, etc.) and \u201ccognition-\nutterance verbs\u201d (think, say, etc.) (Giv\u00f3n 1980: 333). It is defined \nas the extent to which the matrix and lower clause events are coded \nand conceptualised as a single, integrated event. Thus, binding has \na syntactic and a semantic dimension. They correlate as follows: \n\u201cThe higher a verb is on the [semantic] binding scale, the less \nwould its complement tend to be syntactically coded as an \nindependent\/main clause\u201d (Giv\u00f3n 1980: 337). This correlation is \niconically motivated by the proximity principle: linguistic distance \nmay be used to mirror conceptual distance (e.g. Haiman 1985: \n102\u2013147). Regarding the use of subordinating complementisers \nsuch as that, or indeed to, Giv\u00f3n writes: \nAll other things being equal, the use of a subordinating morpheme which \nneatly separates the main clause from its complement clause is a coding \nacknowledgement that the two clauses are semantically still independent \nof each other, at least to some extent. (Giv\u00f3n 1980: 371) \nLet us see how syntactic and semantic binding are defined. \nSyntactic binding is the most straightforward. The cross-linguistic \nfacts suggest that there are three aspects to coding as an \nindependent clause: \n(i) The degree to which the agent\/subject\/topic marking of the \nembedded-clause agent\/subject reflects the marking in \nindependent main clauses. \n(ii) The degree to which independent-clause tense-aspect-\nmodality marking of the verb is preserved in the embedded \nclause. \n(iii) The presence or degree-of-presence of predicate-raising of \n13\nthe complement verb into the main verb; i.e. the degree to \nwhich the complement verb is lexicalized as one word with \nthe main verb (Giv\u00f3n 1980: 337). \nInfinitival complements compared to e.g. that-clauses represent \nrather extreme cases of the reduction of tense-aspect-modality \nmarking (Giv\u00f3n 1980: 337)\uf8e7bare infinitives even more so than to-\ninfinitives. The degree of semantic integration with bare infinitives \nshould therefore be at least as high as with to-infinitives. \nSemantic binding is less straightforward because it depends on \nthe class of complement taking verbs, i.e. causatives vs. modality \nverbs vs. cognition-utterance verbs. For causatives, Giv\u00f3n \noriginally proposed two properties: (i) intended vs. unintended \ncausation and (ii) direct vs. mediated causation, i.e. absence or \npresence of an intermediary party in the causal chain (1980: 336). \nGiv\u00f3n (1990: 520\u2013526) adds two further parameters: unity of space \nand unity of time. (Due to the fact that these two factors hang \ntogether, also with direct vs. mediated causation, these three \nproperties represent the typological notion of directness.) The first \nvalue in each pair represents a higher degree of semantic binding. \n(For modality and cognition-utterance verbs the relevant factors \ninvolve the extent to which the higher clause subject makes a \nstronger or weaker attempt to achieve the lower clause event, and \nthe degree to which they are committed to its success or truth (see \nGiv\u00f3n 1980: 342\u2013347 and passim)).  \nIn connection with the correlation between syntactic and \nsemantic binding it is important to note that the mapping between \nthe two is not a simple one, in the sense that the semantic binding \nscale does not allow any absolute predictions concerning syntactic \nintegration\u2014only relative predictions: \nIf a point on the semantic hierarchy of binding is coded by a certain \nsyntactic coding device, then a semantically higher point cannot be coded \nby a syntactically lower point. Rather, it will be coded either by the same \ncoding point, or by a higher coding point on the syntactic coding scale. \n(Giv\u00f3n 1980: 370) \nSimilar suggestions concerning the form-function mapping in \ncausatives and other complex predicates have been made by other \nauthors, such as Cristofaro (2003), Dixon (2000), Duffley (1992), \nFillmore (1972), Fischer (1992, 1995, 1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 2000), \nJackendoff (1972), Mittwoch (1990), Wierzbicka (1975). \n14\nHollmann (2003: Ch. 5, 2005) surveys the literature and argues that \nGiv\u00f3n\u2019s factors should be supplemented by three more: \n(iv) presence vs. absence of a sphere of control frame (i.e. of \nthe causer over the causee) \n(v) causation type, according to Talmy\u2019s (1976, 1985, 1988, \n2000) four-way typology: affective, physical, volitional \nand inducive causation (see also Croft 1991: 167) \n(vi) punctuality of the causing event \n   \nThe aggregate furnished by these six parameters is referred to as \nthe extended binding hierarchy. As for (iv), the suggestion is that a \ncausative situation where the causer inherently controls the causee \n(e.g. socially or physically) is easier to conceptualise as a single \nintegrated event than a situation where this is not the case.14 Have \ndescribes causation against the background of a control frame: \n(11) John had his daughter tidy her bedroom. \n(12) ?Five-year-old Alice had her father tidy her bedroom. \nForce\u2014which significantly takes a to-infinitive\u2014is the opposite: \nthe reason why the causer resorts to the use of force is that there is \nno implicit relation of superiority between them and the causee. \n To see how Talmy\u2019s causation types are related to binding \nit is necessary to explain this classification a little. The basic \nhypothesis is that causers and causees are analysed according to \ntheir animacy, i.e. animate\/human vs. inanimate\u2014or mental vs. \nphysical, as in the following diagram from Croft (1991: 167): \nFigure 7  \nThe arrows in this diagram represent the manipulative interaction \nbetween causer and causee. V erhagen and Kemmer argue that there \nare differences in the degree of semantic binding (which they refer \nto as directness, notwithstanding the more common use in typology \nreferred to above) between the four types: \nAn obviously important aspect of this model of causation types is the very \nmarked asymmetry between entities with a mental dimension (animates) \nvs. those that are merely physical. Animates can only act on animates via \nthe intervening physical world, i.e. the model implies that one cannot \nreach into another person\u2019s mind and directly cause him or her to do, feel, \n15\nor think something. Physical entities are taken to act directly on other \nthings; hence the straight arrows in the diagram in Fig. [7], vs. the very \nbent arrow for mental-on-mental causation, and the slightly bent one for \nmental-on-physical. (Verhagen and Kemmer 1997: 71) \nIn other words, Verhagen and Kemmer suggest a (partial) ordering \nof causation types such that physical and affective causation are \neasiest to conceptualise as a single integrated event, while \nvolitional causation is seen as less integrated, and inducive \ncausation features the loosest bond between causing and caused \nevents: \nphysical, affective< volitional< inductive \nAs for punctuality, finally, the hypothesis is that this has an impact \non binding in that an instantaneous causing event is construed as \nmore integrated with the caused event than is a causing event that \nis seen as being stretched out over an extended period of time. \nUsing data from the FLOB corpus15 Hollmann (2003, 2005) \nshows that this aggregate of factors adequately \u201cpredicts\u201d the \ncomplementation pattern (bare vs. marked infinitive) in cause, \nforce, have, get, make and persuade. All tokens of these causatives \nwere collected, and scored for the various semantic binding \nparameters. While there was not always complete consistency \nacross instances in terms of their semantics, clear patterns \nnonetheless did emerge. Get and persuade, for example, were \nfound to describe inducive causation most of the time but not \nalways. Causation is of the inducive type in, respectively, 93 and \n95 per cent of the cases, which warrants the conclusion that these \nconstructions are prototypically associated with this type. The \noverall results of the analysis are presented in Table 1 below. \nDirectness is used in the typologist\u2019s sense of the term, i.e. it \nsubsumes unity of time, unity of space, and absence vs. presence of \nan intermediary party. The parameter relationality is a combination \nof intendedness, sphere of control and causation type. The reason \nfor grouping these together also lies in their clear interrelatedness. \nConsider for example that in order for causation to be intended, the \ncauser must be human, or at least animate. They must also be \nhuman if the causee falls within their sphere of control, as \ninanimate objects cannot meaningfully be said to control anything.  \nTable 1  \n16\nThe analysis presented in this table clearly supports the idea that \nsemantic binding motivates syntactic binding: have and make, the \nonly causatives here that take a bare infinitive, are also the only \npredicates with the maximal scores across all three semantic \nbinding parameters. \nAs a final note, we observe that a scanning-based account of \ncomplementation in causatives raises even more questions in \nrelation to the historical development of these constructions. In \nMiddle English there was a considerable amount of variation in \ninfinitival complementation in causatives, see e.g. the examples of \nmake, below, both of which were obtained from the earliest Middle \nEnglish subperiod (1150\u20131250) of the Helsinki Corpus.16 More \ninstances of this variation can be found in e.g. Visser (1973:  2256\u2013\n2284), the O xford English D ictionary (O ED ) and Hollmann \n(2003).  \n  \n(13) Sunnedei aras ure drihten from de\u00f0 e to liue. and makede \narisen mid him alle \u00fe a \u00fe et him efden er ihersumed. (HM1 \nIR HOM LAMB14 141) \n\u2018On Sunday Our Lord arose from death to life. And he \nmade arise with him all those who had formerly obeyed \nhim.\u2019 \n(14) lo \u00fe e sweoke hu he walde makien hire aleast to leapen in to \nprude. (HM1 IR RELT ANCR 121) \n\u2018Lo the traitor, how he wanted to make her at last jump \ninto pride.\u2019 \nAfter Middle English a regulation process set in, whereby \ncomplementation in causatives became more or less fixed. (This \nprocess was completed in c.1800.)  \nLangacker\u2019s characterisation of bare and marked infinitives in \nterms of the two scanning modes is made with reference to \nexamples from Present-day English. One might wish to argue that \nin older varieties this distinction did not obtain, but that \nimmediately raises the question as to how the present-day situation \ncame about. If we assume, by contrast, that the two infinitival \nmodes did correspond to different scanning modes in 18th century \nEnglish and before, then the implication is that speakers had a \nchoice (in some sense) in their construal of the lower clause event, \ni.e. as scanned summarily or sequentially. The problem, once \n17\nagain, is that this claim cannot be tested. Moreover, given that by \naround 1800 the variation in complementation had pretty much \ndisappeared, one would have to explain why this freedom of \nconstrual was lost, taking account of the fact that some causatives \ncame to be associated with lower clause sequential scanning (have, \nmake), while some other causatives (cause, force, get, persuade) \nbecame linked to summary scanning. \nHollmann (2003: Chapter 5) offers a possible explanation that \nmakes no reference to a difference between scanning modes. \nWhilst this is not the place to go into a lot of diachronic detail we \nnote that one factor in the regulation process may have been the \nrelative frequency of the constructions. It is widely accepted in the \nusage-based model and grammaticalisation theory (see e.g. Bybee \nand Scheibman 1999), that high token frequency constructions will \ntend to get reduced more than low frequency ones. Soon after its \nrise in the Middle English period causative make with an infinitive \nbecame the most frequent causative, which may help explain why \nit ended up with the relatively compact bare infinitival pattern as \nagainst the longer to-infinitive complement. (For periphrastic \ncausative have, which has always been less frequent, the \nexplanation must rely more on the semantics of the construction.)    \n4. Further challenges  \nThe previous section has shown that complementation patterns \nwith causative verbs can be explained satisfactorily without \nresorting to the notion of scanning. In fact, if summary and \nsequential scanning were appealed to, the analysis would raise \nvarious questions potentially very difficult to answer. In order to \nshow that the postulation of summary and sequential scanning has \nimportant repercussions not only for specific cases like \ncomplementation patterns but also for the whole theory of \nCognitive Grammar, we now turn to further challenges, both \ntheory-internal and theory-external.  \nLet us first reiterate the point made in section 2, that, to the best \nof our knowledge, no psycholinguistic evidence is available which \nconfirms the existence of the two types of scanning (nor is there \nevidence for Egan\u2019s (in preparation) third mode, of course, since it \nhas just been proposed). For example, experiments carried out by \nCatherine Harris of Boston University proved inconclusive (Harris \n2002, p.c.).\n17\n Matlock\u2019s research on fictive motion, mentioned in \nsection 2.2, may be a potential source for evidence bearing on the \ndistinction between the two scanning modes. Here, we would like \n18\nto make the more general point that, although Matlock (see e.g. \n2004a, b; Matlock et al. 2005) demonstrates that mentally \nsimulated motion is involved in fictive motion processing, she \nobserves that at the present stage of our knowledge the question of \nhow we actually simulate motion while processing fictive motion \nsentences cannot be answered. In fact, she suggests three \npossibilities: (a) we activate a static linear or path-like model and \nlater simulate movement along that path; (b) the path \nrepresentation is built gradually; (c) we do not simulate motion, as \nin (a), or scanning, as in (b), but a state change, i.e. we imagine a \nseries of points along the path, each a few milliseconds after the \nother. To our mind, (a) might correspond to Langacker\u2019s summary \nscanning and (b) to sequential scanning, while (c) does not seem to \nbe contemplated in Langacker\u2019s theory. Importantly, not only is it \nimpossible at present to distinguish among the three options \nexperimentally but Matlock also suggests that people may actually \ncombine the three types.  \nTo throw the lack of experimental evidence into relief, consider \nthat other linguistically relevant cognitive processes, such as \nprototype and schema-based categorisation and figure-ground \nsegregation, have been well-documented prior to their use in \nCognitive Grammar theorising. The summary vs. sequential \nscanning distinction, by contrast, almost twenty years after it was \npostulated, still awaits experimental confirmation. This is \nespecially striking given the status of these modes as basic\ncognitive operations (i.e. they are not regarded as being reducible \nto a complex of more basic cognitive operations, at least in our \nunderstanding of Langacker\u2019s theory). It is perhaps not surprising \nthat summary and sequential scanning have attracted (sometimes \nstrong) criticism before, for instance by Francis (2000), who \ncharacterises these modes as \u201chighly esoteric concepts for which \nthere could be no counterexamples\u201d (ibid: 100, also cited in Taylor \n2002: 516). \nWe would like to point out that the postulation of summary and \nsequential scanning may be an instantiation of the post hoc propter \nhoc fallacy. Sequential scanning in grammar implies that an \nelement X can be inflected (e.g. enter can be inflected for \nperson\/tense as in (she) enters). But, if we do not provide some \nlanguage-independent evidence for its existence, we know that X \nevokes sequential scanning only from the fact that X can be \ninflected. Further, if tense inflections are a valid criterion for \nestablishing whether a form involves sequential scanning, what \n19\ndoes that imply for languages where verbs are not inflected for \ntense, e.g. Thai, Vietnamese and Malay? One suspects that the \nsummary vs. sequential scanning distinction may be hard to \nmaintain in the face of evidence from these languages. \nThe issue of psychological plausibility should also be \naddressed. Consider, for example, Langacker\u2019s (1991: 199) \nanalysis of the verbal group have been being followed of sentence \n(15), which is reproduced in (16):  \n(15)  I may very well have been being followed. \n(16)  (have (PERF4 (be1 (-ing (be2 (PERF3 (V)))))))   \nIn other words, we start with the temporal relation symbolised by \nfollow (i.e. V), which by definition involves sequential scanning, \nand combine it with PERF3, thus obtaining an atemporal relation, \ni.e. the participial form followed, which requires summary \nscanning (for simplicity\u2019s sake we will not offer a detailed \ndescription of the semantic pole of the various (indexed) \nmorphemes contained in (16) since this is not pivotal to our \nargument). Followed combines with be2 to derive the temporal \nrelation be followed. B e followed merges with the morpheme -ing, \nwhich atemporalises the relevant relation again. Sequential \nscanning obtains when being followed fuses with be1, thus giving \nrise to be being followed. Next, PERF4 imposes summary scanning \non the resulting predicate been being followed. Finally, the relation \nis re-temporalised thanks to perfective have. In sum, verb groups \nlike those in (15) originate from the cyclical application of \nsummary and sequential scanning, resulting in the compositional \npath summarised in (16). One may wonder what the psychological \nreality of such cycles is: do speakers really alternate between the \ntwo types of scanning? If much in grammar is accessed as a unit \n(i.e. automatically or without much constructive effort), as \nCognitive Grammar itself claims, speakers could\/should have \naccess to the schematic structure(s) underlining instantiations like \nthe one in (15) without having to go through the \u201cgenerative\u201d \nprocedure elucidated in (16), i.e. without constantly having to \n\u201cswitch\u201d summary and sequential scanning construal on and off. In \nfact, Langacker himself suggests that the pattern in (16) (or some \nof its subpatterns) may be stored as a unit (1991: 227). If we \ninterpret this as an indication that (some?) speakers do not need to \nrun through the entire cycle of alternating scanning modes, instead \n20\nselecting the appropriate scanning mode immediately, the question \nstill remains as to how they acquire this knowledge in the first \nplace if not through instances of this kind of oscillation (see also \nthe point above on the post hoc propter hoc fallacy).\n18\n  \nIt is worth dwelling further on the analysis of (15). As it stands \nin (16), it is also not clear, when the scanning mode oscillation \napplies, whether (16) is intended to capture processing on the part \nof either the speaker or the hearer (or both). Since Langacker\u2019s \ntheory is a cognitive theory of language, any explanation Cognitive \nGrammar offers must be compatible with psycholinguistic \nevidence. Although processing is a highly contentious issue, \nparticularly in the case of speech production, we will try to argue \nthat in either case the evidence available to us casts doubts on the \nappropriateness of Langacker\u2019s analysis for (15) as a cognitively\nplausible processing representation. \nLet us suppose that the analysis offered in (16) applies to \nprocessing on the part of the hearer, i.e. comprehension. This \nwould mean that we, as hearers, would begin processing the verbal \ngroup at the penultimate morpheme (i.e. follow). We would then \nmove to PERF3. But if we have not processed any of the preceding \nforms at that stage, it is not clear how we could analyse followed as \na participle \uf8e7 scanned summarily \uf8e7 , as it is syncretic with the \nsimple past \uf8e7 which involves sequential scanning. A more \nplausible analysis of the way hearers process sentences like this \nstarts from the widespread recognition, in cognitive psychology, of \nthe so-called immediacy of interpretation, i.e. the notion that \nsentence processing is done to a large extent by assigning \nsyntactic\/semantic interpretations to words as they come in, as \nopposed to only at the end of the sentence. Immediacy of \ninterpretation is supported by important experiments carried out in \nthe 1970s and 1980s, see e.g. the study of eye movements by Just \nand Carpenter (1980), or the computational simulation experiments \nby Reddy (1975, 1980). For an overview of the literature the reader \nis referred to e.g. Barsalou (1992: 243\u2013244 and passim) or \nAnderson (1995: 383\u2013385). With reference to example (15), the \npsycholinguistic evidence suggests that already after hearing the \nvery first auxiliary, may, the hearer will hypothesise that this is the \nbeginning of a verb phrase (see also Barsalou 1992: 234 on \nidentifying constituent types in real-time language processing). The \nsubsequent auxiliaries and finally the lexical verb followed will \nconfirm this hypothesis, and in identifying the latter verb as a past \nparticiple rather than a simple past, the hearer is obviously helped \n21\nconsiderably by the knowledge that the preceding verb, being, may \nbe a passive auxiliary, which requires a past participle to \ncomplement it. Thus, if instead of Langacker\u2019s perspective we take \nthe view that is congruent with the experimental evidence available \non speech comprehension, the syncretism problem does not arise.  \nHaving shown that Langacker\u2019s analysis of (15) does not seem \nto be consonant with experimental evidence on comprehension, we \nmay hypothesise that it must apply to production. Due to \nmethodological problems we have far less experimental evidence \nbearing on language production than we do for comprehension. \nMuch of the evidence we do have involves speech errors (e.g. \nFromkin 1971, 1973; Garrett 1975, 1980, 1988). Despite its \nindirect nature, this evidence clearly points in certain directions \nthat suggest that Langacker\u2019s compositional path for sentences \nsuch as (15), above, cannot be assumed for the production \ndimension of usage either. It is not appropriate here to give a full \noverview of the literature on language production (but see e.g. \nClark and Clark 1977: Chapters 6\u20137; Dell 1986; Levelt 1989).19\nSimplifying matters considerably, we can say that, disregarding \nsome differences between the various models, most \npsycholinguists agree that language production involves several \nstages or levels, moving from the purely conceptual (propositional) \nlevel, via semantics and syntax, to phonology and ultimately \nphonetics.20 And, importantly, neither on the conceptual level nor \non the semantic and syntactic levels does it seem to be the case that \nspeakers start out at the lowest level of constituency, and then work \ntheir way up, step by step, in the tree or hierarchy. With reference \nto example (15), when on the conceptual level we form the \nproposition we intend to convey there is no reason why we should \nstart with the event corresponding to follow. Instead, the \nproposition is likely to be a single Gestalt involving (some \nmodalised version of) someone following the speaker. As regards \nthe stages of the process where the message is converted into \nlanguage, the consensus opinion among psycholinguists is that \nhigh-level schemas\u2014such as in this case the transitive frame of \nfollow and of the English passive construction\u2014are evoked very \nearly, and that the semantic representations corresponding to the \nentities and relations of the propositions are slotted into place. \nThese semantic representations are associated with words. \nGenerally, lexical words are assumed to be inserted into the \nstructures\/schemas earlier than function words. This might seem to \nprovide support for Langacker\u2019s suggestion concerning example \n22\n(15), that the compositional path starts at the lexical verb follow. \nHowever, this support is only partial at best, as it is not clear why \nthe speaker should subsequently insert the auxiliaries in the exact \norder Langacker stipulates. Moreover, the fact that a high-level \nschema such as that of the English passive is activated relatively \nearly means that the hierarchy is not assembled in the strictly \nbottom-up manner of the hypothesised compositional path given in \n(16). We thus conclude that from the point of view of the speaker, \ntoo, compositional paths involve top-down processing as well. \nOf course, one could claim that the compositional path in (16) \nis a convenient representation of the interaction between the two \nscanning modes and does not reflect how, for example, speakers \nactually build up (or decode) sentences like (15) \u2013 see above on \nLangacker\u2019s (1991: 227) suggestion that (parts of) (16) may have \nunit status and see e.g. Langacker (1999: Ch. 5) for hints as to non-\nstrictly bottom-up compositionality which may be consonant with \nthe psycholinguistic evidence mentioned here (but note that such \nobservations seem to apply only to production rather than \ncomprehension). However, both unit status and non-strictly \nbottom-up compositionality, presumably two sides of the same \ncoin, are obviously compatible with a model which dispenses with \nthe existence of the two scanning modes. In fact, unit status and \nnon-strictly bottom-up compositionality \u201chide\u201d scanning \noscillations, making it all the more difficult to prove their existence \nand their scope of application (vis-\u00e0 -vis unit status). As was the \ncase with causative verbs (see section 3), the postulation of the two \nmodes does not render our explanations more effective but, rather, \nadds a conceptual dimension for which evidence seems to be very \nelusive (at least at present). \nIndeed, the issue of the postulation of summary and sequential \nscanning may blur the distinction between language as an object of \ninvestigation on the part of the professional linguist and language \nas a cognitive representation in the speaker\u2019s mind (cf. Croft 1988; \nSandra and Rice 1995), although Cognitive Grammar aims at \ndeveloping a psychologically plausible linguistic theory. This point \nis explicitly acknowledged by Taylor: \nAs was the case with vowels and consonants, there is an important sense \nin which the categories of adjective and noun (and indeed the other word \nclasses) must be understood with respect to the constructional schemas in \nwhich they occur (Croft 1999). This is not to deny the possibility of \nentertaining construction-independent characterizations of the word-\n23\nclasses, in terms of the nature of the concepts that the words designate, for \nexample (Chapter 9). Ultimately, however, a word class emerges as a \nfunction of its role within a constructional schema. (Taylor 2002: 563) \nThe quotation, which is consonant with recent, usage-based \nresearch into the acquisition of language by children (see e.g. \nTomasello 2003, who shows that language acquisition relies on \nconstructions), brings to the fore the very notion of distributional \nevidence which Langacker had not used to define word classes (see \nsection 2).  \nMore generally, the combination of the desire to see all \nlinguistic elements as meaningful and the recognition of \nentrenchement (i.e. the view that because of repetition much in \nlanguage is accessed automatically), constitutes a potentially \nproblematic duality in Cognitive Grammar. On the one hand, \nCognitive Grammar is a semiotic model (see also Taylor 2003b) \nwhere all elements are said to be meaningful. This requires \nmaximum parcelling of meaning. On the other hand, Langacker \npresents Cognitive Grammar as a usage-based model (or corpus \nmodel, see Taylor 2003a, b). On this view, grammar is emergent: it \nemerges out of concrete forms which an individual is exposed to \nand can manipulate. The issue here is that entrenchment may \nsometimes be in inverse proportion to analysability (see e.g. Croft \nand Cruse 2004: Ch.9 on the relation between conventionality and \ncompositionality). The semiotic perspective is linguist-oriented \n(and possibly diachronically oriented), in the sense that the linguist \nmotivates the (coming into) existence of a given structure. The \nusage-based view is language user-oriented and may not require \ndetailed representations like the one in (16) above.   \n5. On enter  and into again \nIf we do not accept the existence of the two types of scanning or, \nmore cautiously, remain agnostic about them and recognise the \ncentrality of distributional facts, we can still solve the nagging \nproblem of distinguishing between the verb enter and the dynamic \npreposition into. Distinctions such as those between processes (e.g. \nenter) and atemporal relations (e.g. into) can be regarded first and \nforemost as by-products of distributional facts, i.e. of grammar as a \nusage-based model. The fact that enter is a verb and into is a \npreposition does not (necessarily) either stem from or result in \ndifferent modes of cognitive processing. More important (for the \n24\nlanguage user) may be the differences in the distribution of the two \nelements.  \n We are not suggesting that into and enter, and spatial \nprepositions and motion\/location verbs more generally, are \nsemantically identical. Rather, we are claiming that Cognitive \nGrammar can account for their different categorial status even if \nwe ignore summary and sequential scanning. Specifically, on the \nreasonable assumption that into (in its motion senses, compare \nfn.4) tends to co-occur with a motion (or transfer) verb such as go,\ncome, walk, or put, the usage-based model leads one to expect that \nthe trajector of into is not simply an entity that moves into a \ncontainer (as is claimed by Langacker, see section 2.1), but is \nactually elaborated by an entity involved in a process of motion \nsymbolised by the verb (see also Broccias 2003a: 279\u2013280, \n2003b). Consider Figure 8, below, which represents the semantic \npole of the sentence She walked into the cinema (the notational \nconventions are those used by Broccias 2003a for so-called change \nconstructions). Figure 8b is a compacted version of 8a.  \nFigure 8   \nThe sentence at hand is analysed as involving the conceptual \nmerger of two components, see Figure 8a: one symbolised by the \nsubject-verb string She walked (depicted as the lower box in Figure \n8a), and the other symbolised by the prepositional phrase into the \ncinema (the upper box). Note that the dashed line establishes a \ncorrespondence between the trajector of the preposition into on the \none hand, and the subject of the verb, She, and derivatively the \nwhole event She walked, on the other. Now, given that language \nusers arrive at their semantic analysis of dynamic prepositions such \nas into on the basis of utterances like the one at hand, i.e. \nutterances where the prepositional phrase depends on some motion \nverb, it seems reasonable to suggest that, as a generalisation over \nall these usage events, the trajector of these prepositions is put in \ncorrespondence with the trajector of some (schematic) motion \nevent. In other words, a (unspecified) motion event forms part of \nthe base of into and similar prepositions. This clearly distinguishes \nit semantically from enter and other motion verbs, which \nthemselves foreground the motion event, and thus do not feature an \n\u201cextra\u201d component as part of their meaning.  Figures 9a and 9b \nbelow illustrate our analysis of into vs. enter. The event \nsymbolised by the squiggly arrow is not in bold in Figure 9a (as \n25\nopposed to Figure 8a) because the process it intends to represent is \nnot profiled by into but, rather, is part of its base.\n 21\nFigure 9  \nIt should be clear that while this analysis does not rely on the \ndistinction between summary and sequential scanning, it is \nnonetheless entirely in the spirit of Cognitive Grammar as a usage-\nbased model: the difference in semantics between into and enter, \nand between dynamic prepositions and motion verbs more \ngenerally, emerges in the speaker\u2019s grammar as a result of \ndifferences in usage.22\nSome support for the analysis of into as including reference to a \nschematic motion event is provided by certain \u201celliptical\u201d patterns \nin non-standard varieties of English. Certain regional varieties of \nEnglish may rely on the preposition alone (not necessarily into) to \ncode motion, leaving the verb unexpressed, see examples (17a\u2013b), \nthe former taken from Preston (2005), who comments on some \n(unspecified) dialect of American English, the latter from the BNC. \nThe suggestion that aspects of semantic structure need not always \nbe overtly expressed if they are already schematically present in \nthe utterance, and can be filled in using the linguistic or situational \ncontext, is the accepted Cognitive Grammar perspective on what is \ntraditionally known as ellipsis (see e.g. the account of Jerry will vs. \nJerry will complain in Langacker 1991: 491\u2013492).  \n(17) a. I need in the house. \nb. \u201cAnd you want into his knickers,\u201d he added a little \nlaugh to put Gerry at ease. (BNC BN1 1071) \nThe idiomatic phrases in (18) illustrate the same idea, but in these \ncases the semi-auxiliaries are absent as well: \n(18) a. Off to bed! \n b. Into the fray!23\nAn interesting question is, of course, how the lexemes enter and \ninto arose in the first place, given that they profile the same \ndynamic scenario.24 The issue could be generalised to similar cases \nsuch as cross and across. Our view would simply be that they \nperform different functions. Into allows speakers to talk about \nevents of entering while at the same time specifying manner of \n26\nmotion (e.g. She walked into the cinema). Enter, by contrast, may \nbe used to refer to these events without specifying manner.        \n6. Conclusion \nThe discussion has highlighted the problematic nature of summary \nand sequential scanning, whose existence seems to be needed \nprimarily in order to achieve internal coherence within a lexicalist, \nsemantics-driven linguistic theory. For example, the discussion of \ninfinitival complement patterns with causative verbs may not gain \nany obvious advantage from the inclusion of summary vs. \nsequential scanning as an additional dimension of variation. In fact, \nit would raise questions that are very difficult to answer. The \ncombination of (an improved version of) syntactic\/semantic \nbinding and token frequency seems to provide the necessary and \nsufficient ingredients for a satisfactory analysis. Similarly, enter\nand into can be distinguished without recourse to summary and \nsequential scanning. In the spirit of the usage-based model, the \ncontext of use of the two lexemes in question is incorporated into \ntheir schematic representations, thus allowing us to account for \ntheir different distributions notwithstanding their perceived \nsemantic similarity.     \nCognitive Grammar, although being a lexicalist, semantics-\ndriven model as was shown in section 2, indeed recognises the \nimportance of distributional facts for the emergence of grammar. \nThe case of into vs. enter shows that the view of grammar as a \nsemantics-driven model and the view of grammar as a usage-based \nmodel (or corpus model, in the words of Taylor 2003a, b) may go \nhand in hand, but note that on our analysis the lexical semantics are \nclearly grounded in the constructions in which the words in \nquestion occur. Note, also, that the various infinitival patterns \nobserved for causatives point to the difficulty of always parcelling \nmeaning into minimal discrete components (so that for example we \ncan say that all to-infinitives involve summary scanning and all \nbare infinitives sequential scanning). Taking a lexicalist \nperspective at the expense of attention to the usage data is \npotentially harmful because it may confuse the professional \nlinguist with the language user and result in a theory where internal \ncoherence is no longer guaranteed. On balance, then, the lexicalist \naspect of the nature of Cognitive Grammar (where the dictum \n\u201cevery form has a meaning\u201d holds sway) compares unfavourably \nwith more radically constructional models like Croft\u2019s (2001) or \nGries and Stefanowitsch\u2019s (e.g. Gries and Stefanowitsch 2004; \n27\nStefanowitsch and Gries 2003). Both models recognise a \ncontinuum between lexical and constructional meaning (mediated \nfor example by the strength with which individual lexemes are \n\u201cattracted to\u201d, i.e. occur in, constructions). Furthermore, if the \nproposed meaning of a form escapes experimental validation and \nlacks empirical relevance, then it is probably better not to regard it \nas a cognitively real representation \uf8e7 useful though it might be for \nthe professional linguist\u2019s theory-internal purposes. It is also \nconceivable that some structures cannot (any longer) be assigned a \nwell-defined meaning on their own but are needed simply to \nguarantee the conceptual integrity of a construction. For example, \nit is unlikely that speakers have a representation of an overarching \ncategory \u201csubject\u201d along the lines of Langacker (1987), i.e. as a \nprimary figure (see also Croft 2001 on the lack of a single \nschematic, i.e. globally valid, characterisation of subject; see also \nBroccias 2006). In terms of the linguistic data we have looked at in \nthis paper, to the extent that the loss of infinitival to in some \ncomplements was (partly) the result of high token frequency, that \nseems to suggest that the infinitive marker to was (re-)analysed in \nsuch a way that its link with a discrete bit of meaning (presumably, \na low degree of binding, defined in terms of the parameters \noutlined in section 3, above) was to some extent lost. (For a careful \ndiscussion of the sense in which constructions may be single \nGestalts as opposed to being transparent in a perfect morpheme-by-\nmorpheme way see also the discussion in Croft and Cruse 2004: \n249\u2013254 of Nunberg et al. 1994). In sum, it may be the case that \nabstract representations are sometimes just professional linguists\u2019 \nconstructs. Our position in this connection is thus similar to Croft\u2019s \nsuggestion in the monosemy vs. polysemy debate, i.e. that \n\u201c[s]peakers do not necessarily make the relevant generalizations, \neven if clever linguists can\u201d (Croft 1998: 168).    \nAnother important conclusion stemming from the problematic \nnature of summary and sequential scanning is that, if we do not \ninclude them into the framework, some Cognitive Grammar \nanalyses, e.g. of auxiliaries, adverbs (see Nakamura 1997) and \nlight verbs (see the contrast between take a fall vs. fall mentioned \nin Langacker 1987: 146), need rethinking since they are to some \nextent based on these notions. More in general, the dual nature of \nCognitive Grammar \uf8e7 the contrast between the theory-driven \nrequirement of full semantic analysability and the role of \nentrenchment in the representation of linguistic structures in the \nspeaker\u2019s mind \uf8e7 should be explored in more depth by Cognitive \n28\nGrammar practitioners. This problem, we believe, lies at the heart \nof the construction of a psychologically plausible, and hence truly \ncognitive, grammar.  \nWe would like to conclude by observing that Langacker (2006, \np.c.) suggests that the summary and sequential modes of scanning \nshould actually not be seen as two mutually exclusive cognitive \nprocesses, but rather as opposites on a continuum. Furthermore, he \nargues that while at the highest level of interpretation of a clause \n(i.e. the level of the matrix verb), the difference between the modes \nmay be relatively significant, on lower (embedded) levels the \nmodes play an increasingly less prominent role (see also Langacker \n1991: 440\u2013441). The view of scanning modes as non-discrete and \nas not independent from the clausal context is to some extent closer \nto the more emphatically usage-based perspective we have argued \nfor in this paper, and has far-reaching implications for all the issues \nwe raised. \nIn relation to complementation, which we illustrated mainly \nwith reference to causatives (section 3), Langacker\u2019s (2006, p.c.) \nsuggestion means that bare vs. to-infinitival strategies do not \nnecessarily invoke different representations of the lower clause \nevent at all: the scanning mode is pretty much determined by the \nmatrix verb. This would nullify our objections to different \nconstruals for different complementation modes (synchronically \nand diachronically)\u2014although it would also leave this structural \ncontrast between complements unaccounted for.\nHowever, when we turn to the distinction between dynamic \nprepositions such as into and motion verbs such as enter things \nseem less clear. If the scanning mode of a clause is essentially \ndetermined by the (matrix) verb\uf8e7which is almost always finite \uf8e7\nthen the question arises as to how, in usage, dynamic prepositions \ncould come to be associated with summary scanning. To see that \nthis is so, consider that a preposition such as into will usually co-\noccur with a motion verb, as in She walked into the cinema (see \nsection 5). Now, if the motion verb, in this case walked, effects \nsequential scanning of the situation portrayed by the clause, then it \nis hard to see whence into would derive its summary scanning \nmeaning. One might wish to argue that into in isolation features \nsummary scanning, which is overridden when combined with a \nfinite verb, but we submit that into is not normally encountered by \nthe language user in isolation (see (18b) for an exception), and that \ntherefore an analysis along those lines would be misguided. \n29\nTo sum up, the view of scanning as gradient \uf8e7 both in terms of \nthe summary vs. sequential difference and in terms of decreasing \nprominence from higher to lower levels of clausal organisation \uf8e7\nmay be an important step towards solving some of the problems \nassociated with a more crude interpretation of the distinction \nbetween the two proposed modes, but it remains unclear whether \nCognitive Grammar, as a usage-based model, is well served by \nincorporating the distinction at all.   \n      \n                                                                         U niversit\u00e0  di Genova \nR eceived 19  December 20 0 5                             Lancaster U niversity \nR evision received 8  January 20 0 7   \nNotes \n*\n  We would like to thank Bill Croft, Ewa Dabrowska, Ren\u00e9  Dirven, Adele \nGoldberg, Stefan Gries, Ronald Langacker and two anonymous referees for \ntheir valuable and detailed comments on various versions of this paper. \nThanks also go to Catherine Harris, Thomas Egan, Z eki Hamawand and \nTeenie Matlock for sending us and\/or commenting on some of their recent \nwork. All errors, of course, are our own.     \n1.  Langacker (1987: 251) claims that in the case of sequential scanning \nprocessing time corresponds to conceived time. In summary scanning this is \nnot the case. \n2. Langacker (1987: 251) suggests that the build-up phase may have no great \ncognitive salience. Nor is it necessarily the case \u201cthat any substantial amount \nof processing time is required. The span [\u2026] may well be instantaneous for \nmost practical purposes, and it may be construed as a single point in \nprocessing time with respect to higher levels of organization\u201d (ibid.). \nHowever, anticipating the argument in the main text, we note that it is \ndifficult to see at the moment how such claims can be confirmed empirically.  \n3. Other prepositions that are analysed as profiling complex atemporal relations \ninclude across in sentences such as Harvey crawled across the table\n(Langacker 1991: 217). However, according to Langacker (1991: 217\u2013218), \nacross is polysemous in that it can also profile a simple (stative) relation, i.e. \nin cases where there is no objective motion, e.g. A famous movie star is sitting \nacross the table (1991: 217). \n4. It should be borne in mind that we are discussing concrete (i.e. spatially \ndynamic) uses of the preposition into. Non-motion, non-literal examples like \nShe is into Construction Grammar do not therefore bear on our discussion.  \n5. Ren\u00e9  Dirven (2005, p.c.) sharply observes that Langacker does not always \nsubsume all to-infinitives under this summary scanning characterisation: \u201cin \ncertain of  its uses, including its role in forming noun modifiers (e.g. She was \nthe first person to enter the cave) [to] derives from the processual enter a \npredication that, like nonfinite noun modifiers in general, is both relational \nand atemporal; to enter is thus adjectival rather than verbal, though it clearly \nprofiles all the component states of its base process\u201d (Langacker 1987: 249, \nemphasis added). The emphasised phrase suggests that some to-infinitives \n30\nmay not involve summary scanning. Interestingly, in the next subsection he \nrefers to \u201ccomplex atemporal relations (e.g. to enter)\u201d, thereby apparently \nchoosing not to make this qualification.  \n6. Of course, one could argue that Langacker\u2019s analysis just offers a schematic\ndescription of the three types of non-finite verb forms and that the purposive \nmeaning associated with the to-infinitive might be the prototypical \ninstantiation of the to-infinitive schema. But we will see below that there are \nother reasons to doubt the relevance (and even the existence) of the crucial \ningredient for its schematic characterisation, namely summary scanning. \n7. Duffley goes on to suggest that the connection Langacker (1991: 91) makes \nbetween summary scanning and the ability to function as a noun modifier \nleaves unexplained the ungrammaticality of sentences where the bare \ninfinitive is used in this function, e.g. *The only person be named was \nTheresa. However, as should be clear from the quotation form Langacker \n(2002) above, it is actually to-infinitives not bare stems that are analysed in \nterms of summary scanning. And to-infinitives can indeed function as noun \nmodifiers, cf. The only person to be named was Theresa. Finally, it must be \npointed out that Duffley does not offer any alternative account of the \nphenomena discussed under the rubric of summary and sequential scanning. \n8. It should also be observed that Hamawand uses the terms temporal and \natemporal in a different way from Langacker, i.e. in a more traditional \nfashion. Hamawand, in connection with for-to complements for example, \nclaims that they convert \u201ca temporal relation [e.g. what is expressed as a that-\nclause] into an atemporal one [\u2026]. Atemporal denotes a complement clause \nthat is not grounded in time\u201d (Hamawand 2003a: 176; emphasis in the \noriginal). According to Hamawand\u2019s definition, both to-infinitives and bare \ninfinitives should be classified as atemporal since neither is obviously \ngrounded in time. However, in Langacker\u2019s terminology, to-infinitives are \nsaid to be atemporal (in that they involve summary scanning) and bare \ninfinitives temporal (in that they involve sequential scanning).   \n9. BNC stands for British N ational Corpus, a 100 million word corpus of spoken \nand written Present-day English; for more information see e.g. Aston and \nBurnard (1998). The sequence of letters and numbers following this and \nsubsequent examples identifies the location of the relevant sentence in the \ncorpus. \n10. We are grateful to Nick Smith for drawing our attention to Charleston (1960). \n11. We would like to thank one of the two anonymous reviewers for raising this \npoint. \n12. Two more examples of construction variation are seen in the complementation \nof the verb help, as in Sally helped him (to) do the washing-up, and of \nperception verbs, as in I saw them (to) be obnoxious (Bolinger 1974: 66\u201367). \nAnother instance of variation involves the selection of an infinitive vs. a \npresent participle, e.g. We saw the ship sink\/sinking (Langacker 1991: 442). \nAs Langacker himself points out (1991: 443) the crucial difference between \nthe two variants resides not in scanning but in the perspective taken on the \nlower clause event, i.e. whether it is external\/global, hence requiring an \ninfinitive, or internal\/local, hence requiring a present participle (see also \nsection 2.2, above). \n13. As yet another point of concern, one of the anonymous reviewers and Adele \nGoldberg (2006, p.c.) suggest that summary and sequential scanning are \nessential in Langacker\u2019s account of the difference between each and every. In \nactual fact, Langacker argues that each, unlike every, involves the operation \n31\nof \u201csequential examination\u201d (2003: 6, 2005: 192). Nowhere does he equate \nsequential examination with sequential or summary scanning. \n14. Giv\u00f3n also mentions this factor but he only applies it to non-implicative \ncausatives: \u201cnon-implicative verbs can already be ranked according to \nLikelihood of manipulator\u2019s authority being challenged by the manipulee, \nwith \u2018tell\u2019 coding less challenge and \u2018order\u2019, \u2018ask\u2019, \u2018demand\u2019 coding more\u201d \n(1980: 368). \n15. The FLOB corpus is a 1 million word collection of British English written \nprose compiled in the 1990s. More information can be found at \nhttp:\/\/khnt.hit.uib.no\/icame\/manuals\/. \n16. The Helsinki Corpus (diachronic part) is a 1.5 million word corpus covering \nthe period from c750 to 1710; for an elaborate description the reader is \nreferred to e.g. Kyt\u00f6  (1991). \n17. Harris devised a computer experiment where she asked subjects to hit a key \nwhen they had understood the meaning of a sentence. Her dependent measure \nwas \u201cunderstanding time\u201d. However, this method proved insensitive to \nsubstituting different types of verbs which might be scanned summarily or \nsequentially (under the hypothesis that summary scanning is faster than \nsequential scanning). \n18. We are grateful to Ewa Dabrowska for raising the related question as to how \nchildren succeed in linking relevant linguistic expressions to the appropriate \nscanning mode. More specifically, assuming that summary and sequential \nscanning are innate cognitive abilities, it is not clear how a child could \nactivate the correct scanning mode when, for example, the caregiver says Into \nthe box! \n19. Literate language production is in some ways different from speech; see e.g. \nBereiter et al. (1988), Rosenbaum (1990), Rumelhart and Norman (1982) for \nwriting and typing.  \n20. The fact that different levels, such as semantics, syntax, phonology and \nphonetics are distinguished (contrary to the Cognitive Grammar postulate that \nonly two poles, the semantic pole and the phonological pole, both belonging \nto conceptual space, are needed) is not pivotal to our argument. The crucial \npoint, as is made clear below, is the bottom-up vs. top-down processing issue. \n21. Of course there also exists an intransitive variant of enter (e.g. This word \nentered into the English language in the 14 th century) which necessarily \nincorporates the semantic structure symbolised by into as part of its base. \n22. The proposed analysis of into vs. enter is not intended as a comprehensive \ncharacterisation of (dynamic) prepositions on the one hand, and verbs, on the \nother. For a fuller usage-based account we refer to Croft\u2019s parts-of-speech \nanalysis (1991: Chapter 3, 2001: Chapter 2). Here, the major word classes \nnoun, adjective and verb are analysed both in terms of what they describe-\n\uf8e7viz. objects, properties and actions, respectively\uf8e7and in terms of the \npropositional act they are typically used for\uf8e7viz. reference, modification and \npredication, respectively. Adpositions are not explicitly discussed in these \nsemantic-pragmatic terms (see Croft 1991: 144\u2013146), but one may argue that \nthey refer to relations between entities, and that their propositional act \nfunction corresponds to what Croft calls \u201csituating\u201d (1991: 111\u2013112), i.e. \nconstruing the (literal or metaphorical) position of an entity relative to some \nbackground dimension in space or time. One might wish to observe at this \npoint that Croft draws a parallel between his own analysis of verbs and \nLangacker\u2019s account in terms of sequential scanning (1991: 106\u2013107, 121, \n123), thereby endorsing the sequential vs. summary scanning distinction. \n32\nHowever, note first that this parallel only applies to dynamic non-stative verbs \n(1991: 107). Second, and more important, Croft actually prefers to interpret \nsequential and summary scanning not as the two Langackerian modes of \nprocessing a situation, but instead as terms that may be used to describe the \nephemeral nature, in terms of discourse processing, of an event described by a \nverb, as opposed to the more permanent character of opening and maintaining \na cognitive file, which occurs when nouns are processed (Croft 1991: 121). \nThis is clearly rather different from Langacker\u2019s perspective. \n23. These elliptical patterns are not a novelty in English, see e.g. the following \nexamples from Middle English, taken from Mustanoja (1960: 543, 510, \nrespectively): \ni. \u00feat ever dard To hym (Pearl, 609\u2013610) \n\u2018that ever dared (to go) to him\u2019  \nii. and took hire leve, and hom \u2026(Chaucer, Troilus and Criseyde, i, 126) \n\u2018and took her leave, and (went) home\u2019 \nIn other Germanic languages such as Dutch and German the elliptical \nconstruction is probably even the preferred pattern with modals, at least in \nspoken varieties: Du. Nu moet ik naar huis, G. Jetz t muss ich z u Hause \u2018I must \ngo home now\u2019. \n24. We are grateful to one of the two anonymous reviewers for pointing this out \nto us. \nReferences \nAnderson, John R.  \n1995 Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications.
