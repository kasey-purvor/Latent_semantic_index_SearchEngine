Introduction \nTo date, much work has been carried out to study the effects of laser wavelength variation for \nmedical and surgical applications, revealing clear differences in the performance and effectiveness of \nmany different lasers for such applications. In contrast, comparisons of the differences in the beam \ninteraction characteristics with various materials of the predominant materials processing lasers, the \nCO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer laser, are limited. Previously the main fundamental differences \nresulting from wavelength variations of CO, CO2, Nd:YAG and excimer lasers for a number of \nmaterials processing applications have been detailed [1-4]. Likewise, such practical comparisons \nbetween these traditional materials processing lasers and the more contemporary high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) are even fewer in number [5, 6]. However, in comprehensive investigations, Lawrence \net al. compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and HPDL radiation on the wettability \ncharacteristics of an Al2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic [7, 8], and a mild steel [9, 10], noting that changes in \nthe wettability characteristics of the ceramic and the steel varied depending upon the laser type. \nIn general, polymer materials posses poor adhesion characteristics. Consequently it is very difficult to \nwet, and therefore bond, almost all polymer materials to adhesives without modifying their surface in \norder to improve their wettability characteristics. Traditionally a number of surface modification \ntechniques have been employed to achieve such ends. Previously Fourche [11] investigated a number \nof mechanical and flame methods which essentially roughened the polymer surface thus promoting \nimproved mechanical bonding. A number of workers have developed chemical treatments to \nprimarily increase the surface O2 content of various polymer materials [12, 13]. However, these \nchemical treatments are often accompanied by an undesirable loss in strength. Kaplan et al. [14] used \nthe corona discharge treatment to modify the surface of ultra-high strength polythene (UHSPE) \nfibres. Plasma treatments have also shown a good deal of promise for polymer material surface \nmodification. Holmes and Schwartz [15] studied the effect of ammonia plasma on UHSPE fibres and \nconcluded that the adhesion of the fibres to epoxy resin was improved without the usual detrimental \nreduction in fibre strength. Li and Netravali [16-18] also investigated the effects of plasma \n(allylamine and ammonia) on UHSPE fibres and found that huge increases of over 300% in the \ninterfacial shear strength were occasioned after some plasma treatments. Similar large increases in \nthe interfacial shear strength of UHSPE fibres after plasma treatment were also observed by Nguyen \net al. [19]. Despite the very beneficial improvements in interfacial shear strength that can be obtained \nfrom such plasma treatments, the actual process itself is extremely complex and consequently \nsomewhat difficult to control. \nLasers, on the other hand, can offer the user not only and exceedingly high degree of process \ncontrollability, but also a great deal of process flexibility. Lawrence and Li have amply demonstrated \nthe practicability of employing different types of lasers to effect changes in the wettability \n  3 \ncharacteristics of ceramics [7, 8, 20] and metals [9, 10] for improved adhesion and bonding. In the \ncase of polymer materials, excimer laser radiation has been shown to be a very effective means of \nenhancing their wettability characteristics. First demonstrated in 1982 by Srinivasan and Mayne-\nBanton [21], the excimer laser is typically used to remove thin surface layers of polymers. In recent \nyears this technique has been applied to precisely control and later the surface characteristics of a \nnumber of polymer materials. Much research has been carried out to study the effects of excimer \nlaser radiation on the wettability characteristics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in both film [22], \nfibre [23] and sheet [24] form, as well as polyparaphenylene terephthalamide (PPTA) [25]. \nImprovements in the adhesion strength of excimer laser treated polypropylene (PP) films was \nreported by Breuer et al. [26] when using certain optimum laser parameters. It was proposed that such \nimprovements were the result of the laser generating a more polar surface. Laurens et al. [27, 28] also \nconcluded that a more polar surface resulted from the excimer laser treatment of polyether-etherketon \n(PEEK). Furthermore, these workers found that the choice of laser wavelength has a crucial influence \non the resultant wettability characteristics of the PEEK. Comprehensive and detailed investigations \nby Song and Netravali [29-31] into the effects of excimer laser radiation on the interfacial \ncharacteristics of UHSPE fibres and epoxy resin revealed a considerable increase in the interfacial \nshear strength resulted after laser treatment. This enhancement in the interfacial shear strength was \nattributed to the increase in surface roughness, the increase in surface O2 content and the increased \npolar nature of the fibres after excimer laser treatment. Yet, despite the large amount of work \nconducted with excimer lasers, no published literature to date exists pertaining to the use of other \nindustrial lasers to modify the wettability characteristics of polymer materials. \nThis present work describes the beam interaction characteristics with the bio-material polymethyl \nmethacrylate (PMMA) of a 1 kW CO2 laser, a 400 W Nd:YAG laser, a 5 W KrF excimer laser and a \n120 W HPDL, concentrating principally on the differing effects thereof on the wettability \ncharacteristics. These chiefly incorporate contact angle variations, the differences in morphological \nand microstructural features, the chemical composition of the surface and the surface energy changes. \nDespite the fact that PMMA is used extensively in surgery as bone cement, no published literature \nexists regarding enhancement of the wettability characteristics using lasers or other means. \n2. Experimental procedure \n2.1. Materials processing procedures \nThe solid materials used as substrates in the wetting experiments were square blocks (50 mm x 50 \nmm with a thickness of 10 mm) of PMMA. The contact surfaces of the materials were used as-\nreceived in the experiments. The general laser processing experimental arrangement comprised of the \ndefocused laser beams being fired back and forth across the surfaces of the PMMA by traversing the \n  4 \nsamples beneath the laser beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table. The general \noperating characteristics of the lasers used in the study are detailed in Table 1. Both pulsed and CW \nlasers were used in the study, therefore, both the average power and the peak power of each laser will \ndiffer. So, in order to reasonably compare the effects of each laser on the wettability characteristics of \nthe PMMA, the laser energy density (fluence) of each laser beam incident on the PMMA surface was \nset by manipulating the laser power density and traverse speed in the case of the CO2 laser and the \nHPDL, and the laser power density, pulse width and frequency in the case of the Nd:YAG and \nexcimer lasers, such that the energy density of each of the four lasers incident upon the PMMA \nsurface was around 300 mJ\/cm2. \n2.2. Contact angle and surface energy analysis procedure \nTo investigate the effects of laser radiation on the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the \nPMMA wetting experiments were conducted. The experiments were comprised of control \nexperiments carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of test liquids with known \nsurface energy properties. Thus it was possible to quantify any surface energy changes in the PMMA \nresulting from laser interaction. The sessile drop control experiments were carried out, using glycerol, \nformamide, ethyleneglycol and dimethylsulphoxide. Details of the test liquids are given elsewhere \n[32]. The experiments were conducted in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The \ndroplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the test substrate materials (laser \ntreated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being \napproximately 6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the \nsessile drops being obtained every minute. The contact angles were then measured with a mean value \nbeing subsequently determined. The standard deviation due to experimental error was calculated as \nbeing \u00b10.20.  \nIt was observed during the wetting experiments that, throughout the period of the experiments, no \ndiscernible change in the magnitude of the contact angle was observed, indicating that \nthermodynamic equilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the \nexperiments. This is perhaps surprising when one considers the temperature effect on surface tension \nas described by Mayers [33]. However, results similar to those observed in this study have been \ndescribed by Agathopoulos et al. [34]. \n3. Theoretical background \n3.1. Contact angle and wettability \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread to \ncover (wet) the solid surface [35]. The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is known as the \n  5 \ncontact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle is less than 900. If the contact angle is \ngreater than 900 then the liquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs [35]. When a drop of \nliquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus \nwhether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces \nthat exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) [35]. The index \nof this effect is the contact angle \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid \nand liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle \nof virtual work expressed by the rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system [36]. This is due to fact that the molecular adhesion \nbetween solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid [35]. \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion) Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \nIt is also important to consider the influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact \nangle. Rough grooves on a surface, which may contribute to the influence of contact angles, can be \ncategorised as either radial or circular grooves. Any practical rough surface can be represented by a \ncombination of these two cases [37]. In fact two roughness parameters can be defined: the Wenzel \ntype, DR [38] and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR [39] In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the \nlikely case with the laser treated PMMA, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the \ntheoretical contact angle, \u03b8th, by \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (3) \nAccording to Neumann [40], only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for heterogeneous \nsolid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (4) \nwhere r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the \ncontact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line [37]. Nevertheless, it is evident from Eq. (4) that if \n  6 \nthe roughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will become small, thus, a \nreduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the liquid if \u03b8w<90\n0. Conversely, if \n\u03b8w>90\n0 then the opposite will be observed. \n3.2. Surface energy and the polar\/dispersive characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [35]. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; \nsince van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, \nthe surface energy of any system can be described by [35] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (5) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [35]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (6) \nBy equating Eq. (6) with Eq. (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the \nsurface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (7) \n4. Effects of laser radiation on contact angle characteristics \nAs one can see from Table 2, under the experimental laser parameters employed, laser irradiation of \nthe surfaces of the PMMA samples resulted in changes in the contact angle. Table 2 shows clearly \nthat such changes were dependent upon the laser used. It can be seen that in general, interaction of \nthe PMMA with CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation resulted in decreases in the contact angle \nbetween the PMMA and the control liquids. In contrast, interaction of the PMMA with the excimer \nlaser beam resulted in the contact angle between the PMMA and the control liquids reducing.   \n4.1. Variations in surface roughness characteristics \nThe various surface effects of the respective lasers on the PMMA are clearly discernible from Fig. 1. \nFrom the micrographs shown in Fig. 1 it would appear that in the instances where CO2, Nd:YAG and \nHPDL radiation was incident with the PMMA surface, surface melting and resolidification to varying \n  7 \ndegrees was induced. On the hand, Fig. 1 shows that interaction of the PMMA with excimer laser \nradiation resulted in surface ablation. Analysis of the PMMA surface roughness (using a Taylor-\nHobson Surtronic 3+ profileometer) after treatment with these lasers revealed the surface roughness \nto have increased from 1.95 \u00b5m to 2.18 \u00b5m (CO2), 2.22 \u00b5m (Nd:YAG), 2.24 \u00b5m (HPDL) and 3.85 \n\u00b5m (excimer). Feng et al. [41] noted that under certain surface conditions, contact angle is inversely \nproportional the surface roughness. Clearly this proposal is borne out somewhat by the CO2, Nd:YAG \nand HPDL\u2019s, but does not hold in the case of the excimer laser. It is believed that the increase in \nsurface roughness of the PMMA after excimer laser treatment is counteracted by increases in the \nsurface O2 content and the surface energy changes (as discussed later).   \n4.2. Variations in surface oxygen content \nThe O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is an influential factor governing the wetting performance of \nthe material [42, 43]. Wetting is governed by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material. Thus, \nin order to determine element content of O2 at the surface of the PMMA it was necessary to examine \nthe surface using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Only very marginal differences in the \nsurface O2 content of the PMMA after interaction with the CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL beams were \nobserved. After treatment with these lasers the surface O2 content of the PMMA altered slightly from \nan initial value of 14.7at.% to 14.5at.% (CO2), 14.9at.% (Nd:YAG) and 14.7at.% (HPDL). \nConversely, interaction of the PMMA with excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 content \nof the PMMA increasing markedly to 37.7at.%. \n5. Surface energy and the dispersive\/polar characteristics \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [35] and Agathopoulos et al. [34], it is possible to \nestimate reasonably accurately the dispersive component of the PMMA surface energy, \u03b3 sv\nd\n, by \nplotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Eq. (7) [35], with the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n \nbeing estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with \nthe intercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1. Fig. 2 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv for the untreated and \nlaser treated PMMA-experimental control liquids system.  \nBy comparing the ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated PMMA-liquid systems \ngiven in Fig. 2, it is evident that the best-fit straight lines for the PMMA-liquid systems of the CO2, \nNd:YAG and HPDL intercept the ordinate at similar points. Indeed, the intercept points of these \nPMMA-liquid systems for these lasers are close the ordinate intercept point of the untreated PMMA. \nConversely, the ordinate intercept point for the excimer laser PMMA-liquid system is considerably \n  8 \nhigher above the origin than those of the untreated, CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL PMMA-liquid systems. \nThis is of great importance since interception of the ordinate well above the origin is indicative of the \naction of polar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved \nwettability and adhesion is promoted. On the other hand, as the ordinate interception points \napproaches the origin, the influence of polar forces diminishes and dispersion forces begin to \ndominate [35, 44]. Thus, from Fig. 2 it can be asserted that polar forces are in attendance more in the \nexcimer laser treated PMMA samples than those either untreated or treated with the other lasers. \nFurthermore, because none of the best-fit straight lines intercept below the origin, then it can be said \nthat the development of an equilibrium film pressure of adsorbed vapour on the PMMA surface \n(untreated and laser treated) did not occur [35, 44]. \nAgain, in accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [35] and Agathopoulos et al. [34], it is not \npossible to determine the value of the polar component of the PMMA surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, directly \nfrom Fig. 2. This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at \n( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system as \na whole. However, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due to \ndispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [35, 45]. \nAs such, it is possible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n, using only \nthe relevant part of Eq. (6) thus \n ( )Wadd svd lvd= 2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\/\n (8) \nThe results reveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser \ntreated PMMA surfaces, both Wad  and Wad\nd\n are related by the straight line relationship \n  W aW bad ad\nd= +  (9) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. Also, for the control test liquids \nused, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the control test liquids \nsurface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n                                  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n0 45 185\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (10) \nBy introducing Eq.

(11) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then the following \ncan be derived: \n                   ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n0 45\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (12) \nAlthough Eqs. (9) -(12) were originally introduced by Agathopoulos et al. [34] for use with \nceramic\/biological liquid systems, they have, nonetheless, been used previously by Lellig and \nOndracek [32] to study the wettability characteristics of a number of polymer materials, revealing \nthat the use of these equations for such an analysis is valid. Thus, from the best-fit straight line plots \nof Wad  against Wad\nd\n for the PMMA when it is both untreated and laser treated, it was possible to \ndetermine the constants a and b for each separate condition of the PMMA (see Table 3). Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n \nhas already been determined for the untreated and laser treated PMMA from Fig. 2, then it is possible \nto calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated PMMA using Eq. (12). The values for both \u03b3 sv\nd\n \nand\u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated PMMA are given in Table 4. For the untreated PMMA the \nvalues of \u03b3 sv\nd\n and\u03b3 sv\np\n are in close agreement with those found by Lellig and Ondracek [32]. As one \ncan see from Table 4, whereas CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL treatment of the surface of the PMMA \neffected only a small increases in \u03b3 sv\np\n, excimer laser treatment of the surface of the PMMA \noccasioned a marked increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n. Such an increases in\u03b3 sv\np\n of the PMMA is bound to have a \npositive effect upon the action of wetting and adhesion [35].  \n6. Discussion of laser effected wettability characteristics modification \nThe results detailed previously show clearly that interaction of the PMMA with the selected \nindustrial lasers has resulted in the contact angle formed between the control liquids altering to \nvarious degrees depending upon the laser type. Under the selected experimental laser operating \nparameters, interaction of the PMMA typically with the CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL beams effected \nvery little change in the measured contact angles, whilst interaction of the PMMA with the excimer \nlaser radiation occasioned considerable decreases in the measured contact angles. Such changes in the \nvalue of the contact angle are influenced, depending upon the laser used, primarily by: changes in the \nsurface morphology, changes in the surface O2 content and changes is the surface energy. \nFrom Fig. 1 it can be seen that the morphologies of the CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL treated samples \nappear to be indicative of melting and resolidification. As is evident from the analysis of the surface \nroughness, the melting and subsequent resolidification after treatment with these lasers appears to \nhave had very little effect on the surface roughness. In contrast, as one can see from Fig. 1(e), \n  10 \ninteraction of the PMMA with excimer laser radiation under the chosen operating parameters did not \ncause melting of the surface, but instead induced surface ablation which consequently resulted in a \nslightly rougher surface. Similar observations were made by Lawrence et al. [7-9] during surface \ntreatment of ceramics and metals with excimer laser radiation. Additionally, Kokai et al. [46] have \nconcluded that, with excimer laser parameters which are conducive to the production of a plume, as \nwas the case with the PMMA, then the surface roughness is increased as a result of plume induced \ndebris redepositing on the surface and excessive thermally induced surface fractures and porosities. \nSince plume generation was observed, then surface roughening after excimer laser irradiation was \nperhaps to be expected. However, Liu et al. [47], Nicolas et al. [48] and Henari et al. [49], have \nreported that irradiating ZrO2 with excimer laser radiation with energy densities in excess of 2.7 \nJ\/cm2, resulted in a reduction in surface roughness. Such reductions were attributed to the fact that at \nthese levels of energy density, melting of the ZrO2 surface occurred. \nAccording to Eq. (1) and the work of Feng et al. [41], an increase in the contact angle would be \nexpected after interaction of the PMMA with the excimer laser. However, this is clearly not the case \nas is apparent from Table 2, which shows that significant reductions in the contact angle were \nobserved after excimer laser treatment. It is postulated that the increase in surface roughness of the \nPMMA after excimer laser treatment is counteracted to a large degree by the increases in the surface \nO2 content and the surface energy changes. As was discussed earlier, the surface O2 content of the \nPMMA before and after treatment with the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the HPDL\u2019s altered very little. But, \nafter interaction with the excimer laser beam the surface O2 content of the PMMA increased \nmarkedly. Such a finding is contrary to those of a number of workers [50, 51] who have noted that for \nceramics, irradiation with an excimer laser beam creates defective energy levels, in particular the \nformation of O2 vacancies. Nevertheless, the increase in surface O2 content of polymer materials after \nexcimer laser interaction is well documented [26-31]. Such an occurrence is due to the fact that \npolymers undergo main-chain scission when subjected to concentrated levels of UV radiation in air \n[52]. Thus, when exposed to the excimer laser radiation under the selected laser operating \nparameters, the PMMA can easily generate free radicals as transient species. The O2 in the air can \nthen react readily with the free radicals under the high temperatures generated on the surface of the \nPMMA. It is suggested that oxidation in this manner is the reason for the observed increase in the \nsurface O2 content of the PMMA after excimer laser treatment. Furthermore, the exhibited increase in \nthe surface energy, in particular the increased polar nature of the PMMA after excimer laser \ntreatment, can also be attributed to this photo-oxidation on the PMMA surface. As such, it is \nreasonable to assume that this surface oxidation will result in the generation of some surface O2-\ncontaining polar functional groups [31]. On the other hand, it is asserted that the decreases in contact \n  11 \nangle experienced by the PMMA after treatment with the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the HPDL are due in \nno small measure to the decreases in the surface roughness after treatment with these lasers. \nBy means of cross-sectional SEM analysis it was possible to determine the laser melt\/ablation depth \nin the PMMA samples for each laser. It was found that the depth of the laser melting, and in the case \nof the excimer laser, the ablation region, varied significantly according to laser type. For the CO2, \nNd:YAG and HPDL the melt depths were measured as 56 \u00b5m, 24 \u00b5m and 53 \u00b5m respectively, whilst \nfor the excimer laser the ablation depth was measured as 12 \u00b5m. As one can see, the differences in \nlaser melt\/ablation depth obtained with the Nd:YAG and particularly the excimer laser, were smaller \nthan those of the CO2 or HPDL. The main reason for these differences is thought to be due to the \npulsed nature of the beams of the Nd:YAG and excimer lasers, as opposed to the CW nature of the \nCO2 or HPDL beams. Since the interaction time of a pulsed beam with a material is much shorter \nthan that of a CW beam, then consequently the depth of the laser melt\/ablation region will be much \nsmaller owing to the reduced time afforded for heat transfer. \nThe excimer laser aside, the morphology of the PMMA generated after treatment with the CO2, the \nNd:YAG and the HPDL was very similar. It is therefore possible to conclude that a wavelength \ndependence of the change of the wetting properties cannot be deduced from the findings of this work. \nThis is apparent from the very similar properties of the surfaces irradiated with the CO2, the Nd:YAG \nand the HPDL, the wavelengths of which vary by more than an order of magnitude. Nonetheless, the \nwork has shown that under the chosen experimental laser operating parameters, changes in the \nwettability characteristics of the PMMA were seen to alter to various degrees depending upon the \nlaser type. In particular, whether the laser radiation had the propensity to cause melting or ablation of \nthe surface. \n7. Conclusions \nInteraction of CO2 laser Nd:YAG laser, high power diode laser (HPDL) and excimer laser radiation \nwith the surface of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet was found to effect varying degrees of \nchange to the wettability characteristics of the material. It was observed that interaction of the \nPMMA with CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation resulted in very little change in the contact angle, \nand therefore the wettability characteristics, with the control liquids used. In contrast, interaction of \nthe PMMA with excimer laser radiation occasioned a marked decrease in the contact angle, and \ntherefore the wettability characteristics, with the control liquids used. Such changes after excimer \nlaser treatment were identified as being primarily due to the increase in the surface O2 content of the \nPMMA and the increase in the polar component of the surface energy. These occurrences are \nbelieved to be the result of photo-oxidation on the PMMA surface which, in turn, is assumed resulted \n  12 \nin the generation of some surface O2-containing polar functional groups, thus effecting the observed \nchanges in the wettability characteristics of the PMMA after excimer laser treatment. \nA wavelength dependence of the change of the wetting properties cannot be deduced from the \nfindings of this work. This is apparent from the very similar properties of the surfaces irradiated with \nthe CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL, the wavelengths of which vary by more than an \norder of magnitude. Nonetheless, the work has shown that under the chosen experimental laser \noperating parameters, changes in the wettability characteristics of the PMMA were seen to vary \nsomewhat depending upon the laser type. In particular, whether the laser radiation had the propensity \nto cause surface melting or ablation.  \n  13 \nReferences \n1. F.
