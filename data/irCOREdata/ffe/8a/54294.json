A handler sends a signal (e.g. a command), to which their dog responds. This response is dependent on the dog\u2019s perception of the signal rather than the intention of the sender. Previous research has shown that a dog\u2019s response can be influenced by specific changes in the verbal and non-verbal qualities of signals (i.e. the commands) used, but there has been little scientific evaluation of what happens in practice. Therefore in a first study, 56 dog handlers were videotaped giving their dogs a \u201csit\u201d command and the significance of verbal and non-verbal factors on response was analyzed. Two factors were associated with a significant decrease in obedience: the dog\u2019s attention to its handler and the handler giving additional verbal information preceding the actual verbal command. Based on these results, a second more controlled study was run with 12 dogs that were trained to a new (\u201cuff\u201d, i.e. jumping onto a raised surface) and a known (\u201csit\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d or \u201cpaw\u201d) command. Once trained to predefined criteria, dogs were tested for their responsiveness with each of three additional types of verbal information preceding the command: the dog\u2019s name, the dog\u2019s name followed by a pause of 2 seconds and a \u201cnovel word\u201d, i.e. a word with no established relationships in this context (\u201cBanane\u201d). The results suggest that the addition of the novel word significantly reduced response to both the known (p = 0.014) and the new (p = 0.014) commands. The name plus a pause preceding the command significantly reduced the response to the new command (p = 0.043), but not the known one. The use of the name before the command without a pause had no significant effect on performance. The dogs\u2019 ability to generalize learned commands from the training context to a new context was tested by going through the same procedure in an unfamiliar environment.

Two factors were associated with a \nsignificant decrease in obedience: the dog\u2019s attention to its handler and the handler giving \nadditional verbal information preceding the actual verbal command. Based on these results, a \nsecond more controlled study was run with 12 dogs that were trained to a new (\u201cuff\u201d, i.e. \njumping onto a raised surface) and a known (\u201csit\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d or \u201cpaw\u201d) command. Once trained \nto predefined criteria, dogs were tested for their responsiveness with each of three additional \ntypes of verbal information preceding the command: the dog\u2019s name, the dog\u2019s name followed \nby a pause of 2 seconds and a \u201cnovel word\u201d, i.e. a word with no established relationships in this \ncontext (\u201cBanane\u201d).

There was a significant reduction in correct responses only to the new \ncommand independent of the preceding verbal information (name (p = 0.028), name plus pause \n(p = 0.022) and novel word (p = 0.011)). This suggests that dogs may have more difficulties \ngeneralizing a less well-established command than an already known command.  \nKeywords \ncommunication, dog, human, obedience, generalization, training \n1 Introduction \nCommunication has two components: 1) the signaller who is responsible for encoding and \ntransmitting the information within a signal sent to the receiver, and 2) the receiver, who \ndecodes the information within the message according to their own perceptual biases (Shanker \nand King, 2002, Rowe and Skelhorn, 2003). Therefore the information extracted by the receiver \nis influenced by many factors ranging from the psychology, sensory and perceptual properties \nof the receiver him\/herself to properties of the environment. The interspecific communication \nthat occurs between handlers and their dogs has been described by Pongracz and colleagues as a \nform of \u201csocial understanding\u201d (Pongracz et al., 2001). However, they emphasise that the social \nunderstanding is a concept in the handler\u2019s mind as opposed to a cognitive process in the dog. \nTraining has been defined as \u201ctechniques used to ensure that learning comes about in a \npredictable way in response to human intervention\u201d (Mills, 2002) and is a particular, controlled \nway of communication, which should ideally consist of the transmission of a clear signal from \nthe human trainer to the trained individual to enable learning that will reliably elicit the desired \nlearned response. To be clear, signals should be congruent and unambiguous even when \noriginating from different modalities. The animal must be able to discriminate specific key \nelements of the command (signal) from more variable elements (noise) both in training as well \nas in every day situations, (Mills, 2005). \nAlthough common in the laboratory study of learning, simple unisensory signals (i.e. signals \nthat are very consistent and which relate to a single sensory channel such as a tone of specific \nfrequency, volume and duration) are rare in real life situations. Multimodal signals, i.e. those in \nwhich information is conveyed through several sensory channels (visual, acoustic, olfactory, \ntactile, chemical) are the norm (Partan and Marler, 1999, 2005, Partan, 2004, Rowe, 2005). \nSeveral studies have examined the importance of variations within specific modalities on dogs\u2019 \nresponses; for example the effect of nonverbal variations in a command on the obedience of \ndogs (Fukuzawa et al., 2005a, Fukuzawa et al., 2005b, McConnell and Bayliss, 1985, \nMcConnell, 1990, Pongracz et al., 2003), or the influence of giving a dog visual communicative \nsignals (Miklosi et al., 2000, Miklosi et al., 2005) or a choice of visual and\/or olfactory \ninformation (Szetei et al., 2003). These studies illustrate the importance dogs give information \nfrom different modalities. Dogs appear to be particularly skilled at \u201creading\u201d the visual \ninformation conveyed by human gaze and pointing gestures, outperforming wolves and some \napes (Soproni et al., 2001, Soproni et al., 2002). This is thought to be due to their close \nassociation and possible co-evolution with humans during their domestication. Dogs and wolves \nalso differ in what signals they choose to focus on as a source of information. Miklosi et al. \n(2003) compared the reactions of dogs and wolves to an insoluble problem and found that dogs \ntend to look at humans for help, whereas wolves continue to try to solve the problem on their \nown. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the understanding of verbal language by \ndogs (Cracknell et al., 2008, Kaminski et al., 2004, Markman and Abelev, 2004), although it has \nbeen an area of scientific interest since at least the nineteen twenties and thirties (Sarris, 1931, \nWarden and Warner, 1928).  \nGiven that most signals are multimodal, it is important to understand the factors affecting an \nanimal\u2019s choice of information to follow when the signs from different channels are \nincongruent, such as a friendly voice combined with a potentially threatening body posture, or \nwhen incongruent information is conveyed within the same channel e.g. an angrily spoken \n\u201ccome\u201d command. Szeitei et al (2003) found that if a dog is confronted with contradictory \ninformation about the location of hidden food, one olfactory (food odour) and the other visual (a \nhuman pointing to another location), it is more likely to follow the human pointing gesture, \nhighlighting the importance that some dogs tend to place on information coming from people \nrather than the physical environment. \nThese studies provide insight into what dogs might focus on and react to when interacting with \nhumans. However, most of these studies were conducted in artificial, controlled settings. This \ndoes not necessarily relate to what actually happens in normal daily situations (Kingstone et al., \n2003). Therefore, the aim of this study was first to use a field-based methodology to evaluate \nthe significance of a range of verbal and nonverbal interactive factors, which might influence a \ndog\u2019s obedience, and then to evaluate the robustness of these findings in a more controlled \nexperimental setting.  \n2 Study I: Field study \n2.1 Animals, Materials and Methods \nThe aim of Study I was to identify, in a field setting, common significant nonverbal and verbal \nfactors that might influence a dog\u2019s obedience to a command given by its handler.  Fifty-six dog \nhandlers agreed to be videotaped (using a Sony DCR-HC90E video camera) giving their dog the \ncommand \u201csit\u201d during normal weekly training classes. The dog-handler teams were observed in \nfour dog training schools (one in Switzerland, three in England). One of these classes was a \n\u201cleisure\u201d class (i.e. handlers wanting to do some basic obedience, but not interested in \ncompeting), two were obedience classes and one an agility class. Since we were interested in \nthe most prevalent factors affecting dogs in a range of training settings, we did not control for \ndemographic factors relating to the dogs or training experience, and sought a range of \npopulations to sample. The first suitable situation recorded was chosen for analysis in all cases. \nThe distance to the filmed individuals was variable since it was important not to interfere with \nthe ongoing activity, however it usually measured several meters with a zoom option on the \nvideo camera used as necessary. \n \nOf the 56 dogs, 33 were male (18 entire) and 22 were female (12 entire, 1 of unknown neuter \nstatus). The dogs\u2019 ages ranged from 4 months to 9.7 years with a mean of 2 years, (age of one \ndog unknown). The dog breed groups, using the FCI classification, were: 10 sheepdogs and \ncattle dogs, 5 Pinscher and Schnauzer or molossoid breeds, 6 Terrier breeds, 2 Dachshunds, 1 \ndog belonging to the Spitz and Primitive types, 1 scent hound breed, 2 pointing dog breeds, 20 \nretriever, flushing dog and water dog breeds, 2 companion and toy dogs, 1 sight hound and 6 \nmongrels. The ages of the handlers varied from one person just under 10 years, four people aged \nbetween 10 and 20 years, 39 people between 21 and 60 years, and nine people over 60 years of \nage. The age of three handlers was not declared. Nineteen of the subjects attended leisure \nclasses, 18 obedience classes, 7 agility classes, 5 obedience and agility classes and 2 dogs were \ninvolved regularly in other types of training. Twenty of the handlers had less than a year \nexperience with dogs, 17 had between 1 and 5 years of experience, 2 between 5 and 10 years \nand 12 had more than ten years of experience handling dogs. \n \nAs the aim was to observe handler-dog interactions in an everyday setting, the handlers were \ninformed about the general aim of the project, but were not told which exact command was the \nfocus of interest. Handlers were asked about the commands known by their dogs and the signals \nused to control this behaviour. The interactions filmed were not staged and the experimenter \nfilmed throughout the training sessions. The behaviour on which the study focussed (\u201csit\u201d) was \nnot a behaviour that was being trained, but a command with which all the dogs were familiar. \nWhether the dog obeyed or not was noted as well as the sequence of instructions used before the \ndog responded with the desired response. If the command was repeated, the first command was \nused for analysis. Hence the focus of this study was not on analysing factors that influence the \nlearning of the \u201csit\u201d command, but on identifying the most significant general interactive \nfactors which influence obedience to a given command or not.  \n \nThe parameters were analysed for the \u201csit\u201d command of all subjects using the media-tagging \nprogram ELAN 2.5.0 (http:\/\/www.lat-mpi.eu\/tools\/elan\/elan-description) and are given in Table \n1. These were limited to clearly observable behaviours, since identification of more subtle non-\nverbal signals (such as type of eye gaze, facial expressions, etc.) was not feasible. Analysis \nfocused around the first verbal command whereby information preceding the command within a \nfew seconds was noted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken using a \ncombination of the statistical software packages Minitab 13.0 and SPSS 11.0. \n \nThe study was approved by the relevant University ethics committee. All handlers provided \nwritten informed consent and in the case of minors, the consent was signed by the parents who \nwere present during the class.  \n \n2.2 Results \n2.2.1 Intra-observer reliability of assessment \nAll 56 dog-handler interactions were coded twice by the same observer several weeks apart. \nThe intra-observer reliability of the results was evaluated using Spearman\u2019s correlation \ncomparing \u201cobservation one\u201d and \u201cobservation two\u201d.  There was a significant and acceptable \npositive correlation between the two observations (rho = 0.886, p < 0.01, two-tailed). \nObservation two was then used for further analysis, as this data was associated with the greater \nexperience of the observer. \n \n2.2.2 Descriptive Analysis \nSixty-eight per cent (n=38) of dogs obeyed on first command, i.e. before additional instruction \nwas given or the dog did not respond appropriately. Forty-eight percent had their face turned \ntowards their handlers, which was coded as \u201cpaying attention to their handlers\u201d, however, all \nhandlers were paying attention to their dogs when giving the command. Sixty-eight percent of \nthe handlers did not give any additional verbal information preceding the actual verbal \ncommand. Verbal information preceded nonverbal information in 14% and followed the \nnonverbal information in 61% of the cases. Twenty-three percent of the handlers gave \nadditional information simultaneously with the command. Sixteen percent of the handlers gave \nthe command using only a single obvious stimulus modality (i.e. verbal, visual or tactile). \nHandler accuracy regarding their descriptions and implementation of the commands was as \nfollows: 61% gave the \u201ccorrect\u201d verbal command (i.e. the command they said they used), 30% \nthe correct visual command and 61% the correct tactile command (i.e. touch signal). Twenty-\nfive percent of dogs and handlers were oriented towards each other. Thirty-two percent of the \ndogs showed at least one of the additional behaviours recorded (i.e. lip licking, etc). Thirty-four \npercent of the handlers tugged on the lead and 32% used a treat.  \nFor analysis, the original categories describing the sequence of information were pooled to \ncreate the following categories (see Table 2): (1) \u201cverbal information preceding nonverbal \ninformation\u201d, (2) \u201cverbal information\u201d, (3) \u201csimultaneous information\u201d, (4) \u201cnonverbal \ninformation preceding verbal information\u201d and (5) \u201conly one type of command\u201d, as the data in \nthe specific categories was insufficient for appropriate statistical analysis.  \n \nSixty-one percent of handlers gave their dog some nonverbal information before giving it verbal \ninformation. Twenty-three percent of the handlers gave the dog simultaneous verbal and \nnonverbal information, whereas 16% of the handlers used verbal information preceding \nnonverbal information. Of the 16% who used a single command modality, 78% used a verbal \ncommand. Thirty-four percent of handlers gave the dog verbal information, such as the dog\u2019s \nname, before giving it the command.  \n \n2.2.3 Factors affecting obedience \nAn initial univariate chi-squared test was used to determine factors to be considered in a \nmultivariate binary logistic model of the dog\u2019s obedience. Factors examined were whether the \ndog was paying attention to its handler or not and whether the owner was paying attention to the \ndog or not, the sequence of information given focussing on verbal and nonverbal information, \nthe sequence of commands given (if two modalities were used), whether a treat was used to lure \nthe dog, whether the handler tugged on the lead, used their arms or hands or showed any other \ndetectable nonverbal information, whether the given commands (verbal, visual, tactile) were the \nones the handlers had previously stated to be the commands used, proxemics (orientation and \ndistance) of the dog and the handler, and additional behaviour information shown by the dog. \nAssociations with p-values less than 0.2 were considered for inclusion and are given in Table 3. \nIn order to reduce the number of factors to include in the multivariate model, associations \nbetween the independent variables were assessed by means of a further chi squared test. The \nfollowing had a high level of statistical significance (p < 0.005, 1 df in all cases): \u201cdog\u2019s \nattention\u201d and \u201ctactile agreement\u201d (Chi = 17.352, p <0.001), \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d and \u201cdog \nbehaviour\u201d (Chi = 13.103, p<0.001) \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d and \u201corientation\u201d (Chi = 14.900, p \n<0.001), \u201cverbal O preceding verbal C\u201d and \u201cverbal agreement\u201d (Chi = 33.836, p < 0.001), \n\u201conly one command used\u201d and \u201cnonverbal information followed by verbal information\u201d (Chi = \n16.673, p <0.001), \u201ctactile agreement\u201d and \u201corientation\u201d (Chi = 12.078, p = 0.001), \u201ctactile \nagreement\u201d and \u201cdog behaviour\u201d (Chi = 8.828, p = 0.003), \u201ctactile agreement\u201d and \u201clead\u201d (Chi \n= 44.442, p <0.001), \u201corientation\u201d and \u201clead\u201d (Chi = 9.586, p = 0.002). \n \nIn the interest of parsimony, the independent factors \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d, \u201cverbal information \npreceding verbal command\u201d, \u201csimultaneous verbal and nonverbal information\u201d, \u201cNonverbal \ninformation preceding verbal information\u201d, \u201conly one command\u201d, \u201corientation\u201d, and \u201cdog \nbehaviour\u201d were then used in the binary logistic regression model predicting obedience.   \n \nVariables were initially included in a forward stepwise analysis in increasing order of their \nsignificance in the Chi-square test. The model achieved most efficient reliability (92.1% \npredictability of obedience and 66.7% predictability of failure to respond, 83.9% overall) after \nthe sequential inclusion of \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d, \u201cverbal information preceding verbal command\u201d \nand \u201csimultaneous information\u201d (Chi-square 24.269, df = 3, p < 0.001), additional factors \nreduced the log-likelihood by less than 0.01%. The Wald statistics (1 df in all cases) confirmed \nthat the factors \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d (8.384, p =0.004) and \u201cverbal information preceding verbal \ncommand\u201d (7.550, p = 0.006) significantly predicted the outcome of obedience (simultaneous \ninformation Wald 3.344 p=0.067). A backward stepwise procedure was then undertaken, using \nthe same criterion for termination. The proposed model (89.5% predictability of obedience and \n61.1% predictability of failure to respond, 80.4% overall) was extracted after 6 steps (Chi-\nsquare = 28.870, DF = 4, p < 0.001), when it included \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d,  \u201cverbal information \npreceding verbal command\u201d, \u201cnonverbal information preceding verbal information\u201d and \u201conly \none command\u201d, suggesting similar convergence. The Wald test (1df in all cases) confirmed the \nsignificance of all of these factors  (dog\u2019s attention: 8.034 p=0.005, verbal information \npreceding verbal command: 5.507, p=0.019, nonverbal information preceding verbal \ninformation: 4.827, p=0.028, only one command: 5.101, p=0.024).  \nFrom this it was concluded that \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d and \u201cverbal information preceding verbal \ncommand\u201d i.e. whether the dog was paying attention to his or her handler and whether the \nhandler gave additional verbal information prior to the actual verbal command, were the most \nconsistent factors affecting response in this study, with the nature of verbal information \npreceding the command taken forward for further investigation in Study II. \n3 Study II \nThis study aimed to test the hypothesis that \u201cdog\u2019s attention\u201d and \u201cverbal information preceding \nverbal command\u201d affected response to an obedience command.  \n \n3.1 Animals, Material and Methods \nTwelve dogs of various breeds (one Labrador retriever, one Spanish Waterdog, one Cavalier \nKing Charles, one English Springer Spaniel, one Jack Russell Terrier, one Staffordshire \nBullterrier, one Border Terrier, one Soft Wheaten Terrier, and four mixed breeds) were used. \nSeven were male (3 entire) and 5 female (1 entire). The ages of the dogs ranged from 6 months \nto 10.5 years with a mean of 2 years. The dogs were voluntarily recruited through local \nadvertising at the University of Lincoln.  \n \nThe choice of additional verbal information was based on the previous study, and consisted of: \n1) the dog\u2019s name, 2) the dog\u2019s name followed by a pause of about 2 seconds, and 3) a novel \nword the dog was unlikely to have encountered in combination with the commands, in this case \nthe German word \u201cBanane\u201d was used.  \nThe same experimenter trained all dogs, wearing the same types and colour of clothes for all \nsessions, standing in the same position, hands behind her back and looking straight ahead (while \nthe dog was seated to her left on a mat) whilst giving the command. This minimized the impact \nof inadvertent instructor related variables. \n \nIn order to reduce command predictability and to evaluate the effect on two different types of \ncommand, two commands were chosen for each dog, (a) a known command (KC) with which \nthe dog was already familiar. This was a \u201cdown\u201d for 10 dogs, a \u201cbeg\u201d for one dog and a \u201cpaw\u201d \nfor another dog, and (b) a new command (NC) unfamiliar to all dogs which was taught by the \nexperimenter. The owners were not present during the training sessions and were not informed \nabout the command or behaviour being taught until after termination of the test in order to avoid \nthe risk of them undertaking any training of this command at home. The word \u201cuff\u201d, unknown \nto any of the participating dogs, was used to signal jumping up onto an elevated surface for a \npotential reward.  \n \nThe dogs were trained in a 10m x 8m room in the middle of which there was an elevated \nplatform (~ 1m x 1m raised 30cm). All training sessions were videotaped using a Sony DCR-\nHC90E video camera over a period of 4 months from June 2006 to September 2006 at the \nUniversity of Lincoln, UK. \n \nDuring the training phase, dogs were trained to their two commands using positive \nreinforcement. Once a dog passed an acceptable threshold for each of the responses, it entered \nthe test phase, which consisted of a random sequence of commands including eight \ncombinations with different adjunctive information to the trained command (Table 4).  \n \nDogs had to pass a pre-test check of reliable responding to the commands alone (i.e. as trained) \nat the start of every weekly or bi-weekly session (referred to as \u201cbasic command\u201d) before \npassing on to the test with commands rendered \u201ccomplex\u201d with either the dog\u2019s name (n), the \ndog\u2019s name and a pause (n + p) or the novel word (b). This required the dog to respond \nacceptably to at least 5 out of 6 (83%) KC and at least 4 out of 6 (67%) NC given in random \nsequence within one session (Research Randomizer, www.randomizer.org, 2006). The dogs\u2019 \nbehaviours were scored using a 5-point scoring system adapted from Fukuzawa et al. (2005b), \nwith 0 being the \u201clowest\u201d score and 4 being the \u201chighest\u201d (Table 5). Scores 3 and 4 were \nconsidered acceptable responses to the command, i.e. the dog obeys, whereas scores 0 to 2 were \nconsidered as \u201cincorrect responses\u201d. Different thresholds were used to complement \ndifferentiation between the two types of command and the effects of the variables of interest on \nthese (i.e. the new command was less well established).  The sequence of the combinations (n, n \n+ p, b) used in the tests was varied between subjects by using a double Latin square to control \nfor sequence order. \nThe training phase and initial test took place in the same room (\u201cRoom A\u201d). After completing \nthese, the dog was run through the same pre-tests in Room A and, if it passed, it was then \nmoved into a novel environment (\u201cRoom B\u201d) of similar size and arrangement, but with \nadditional furnishings. The dogs had neither been trained in Room B nor had the opportunity to \nfamiliarize with it in advance. This allowed assessment of the impact of the novel environment \non performance. An additional test, giving the dog only the \u201cbasic command\u201d (C) in Room B \nwas added to the combination, which assessed the ability of the dog to generalise the commands \nto the new context. A different sequence in the Latin Square was used for each subject in Room \nB compared to Room A. \n \n3.2 Analysis and Results \nThe number of training sessions necessary for the individual dogs varied from five to nine, with \nan average of 6.9 sessions required. \n \nA Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to compare the following situations within subjects: 1) \nRoom A: comparison of the number of correct responses in the pre-test (basic commands) and \nthe test (complex commands) in Room A, both for the KC and the NC; 2) Room B: comparison \nof the number of correct responses to the pre-test in Room A and the test in Room B, both for \nthe KC and the NC. 3) Comparison of the corresponding complex command contexts in Room \nA and Room B, both for the KC and the NC. \n \n1) Room A, i.e. training room (Fig 1) \nThe responses to the basic commands were compared with the responses to the complex \ncommands in the same room. A significant decrease in correct responses was found for \u201cb\u201d \npreceding the KC (p = 0.014) and \u201cn + p\u201d (p = 0.043) and \u201cb\u201d (p = 0.014) preceding the new \ncommand (NC).  \n 2) Room B (Fig 2) \nThe responses to the simple commands in Room A were compared with the responses to the \nbasic commands and complex commands in Room B. A significant decrease in correct \nresponses was found for the following complex versions of the KC: \u201cn + p\u201d (p = 0.043) and \u201cb\u201d \n(p = 0.036). The correct responses to the basic NC were significantly decreased in Room B \ncompared to Room A (p = 0.013) as well as when preceded by the \u201cn\u201d (p = 0.013) \u201cn + p\u201d (p = \n0.008), and by \u201cb\u201d (p = 0.008) (Fig 2).  \n \n3) Comparison Room A and B (Fig 3) \nIn order to examine possible influences of the location on the dogs\u2019 responses to the basic and \ncomplex commands, the average number of correct responses (scores 3 and 4) within the \nfollowing situations: command only; command preceded by the dog\u2019s name (n); command \npreceded by the dog\u2019s name and a pause (n + p); and command preceded by the novel word (b); \nwere compared for both the KC and the NC in Rooms A and B. A significant difference \nbetween Room A and B was found only for the NC, not for the KC. The situations \u201cn\u201d (p = \n0.028), \u201cn + p\u201d (p = 0.022) and \u201cb\u201d (p = 0.011) preceding the NC resulted in significantly fewer \ncorrect responses in Room B than in Room A for all three situations.  \n4 Discussion \nThe aim of this study was first to use a field-based methodology to evaluate the significance of \na range of verbal and nonverbal interactive factors which might influence a dog\u2019s obedience, \nand then to evaluate the robustness of these findings in a more controlled experimental setting.  \nThere are many factors that can influence a dog\u2019s obedience including its training history (Hiby \net al., 2004, Pongracz et al., 2001, Rowe and Skelhorn, 2003), the experience of the dog handler \n(Lynge and Ladewig, 2005) and the familiarity of the dog with its handler (Coutellier, 2006, \nLefebvre et al., 2007). The current study suggests that two immediate factors are the focus of \nthe dog\u2019s attention and verbal information preceding the command, and that the effect of the \nlatter may at least in part be affected by how well established the command has become. Many \nhandlers will \u201cchat\u201d to their dogs in quite a complex way (Mitchell and Edmonson, 1999). \nHowever, the influence of this \u201cchatting\u201d on obedience, has not, to our knowledge, been \nexamined experimentally previously. Pongracz et al. (2004) reported that one of the most \nimportant factors for a dog to successfully follow a human demonstrator was for there to be \ncontinuous talking directed towards the dog during the task. In this case, talking may be a way \nof keeping the dog\u2019s attention on the handler, rather than a process of specific information \ntransfer, since Pongracz\u2019s aim was for the dog to learn by observation and not respond to a \nverbal instruction. There is therefore a need to distinguish between verbal utterances, which \nserve as an attention getting mechanism and verbal utterances, which convey important \ncommunicative information. In obedience work, the dog is expected to respond reliably to an \nidentifiable spoken command, and in this context it seems that additional verbiage may be \ncounterproductive, especially if the animal\u2019s attention is already on the handler. Our results \ndraw attention to the importance of the content of the acoustic exchange associated with \nobedience instruction, but it is important to emphasise that non-verbal signalling also plays an \nimportant role in practice.  For example, Fukuzawa et al. (2005a, 2005b) found that a dog\u2019s \nobedience could decrease if a command was given by a handler wearing sunglasses, changing \nposture, visibility or at varying distance from the dog.  Pongracz et al. (2003) found that dogs \nare less likely to follow verbal commands alone (i.e. with no visual information) than verbal \nsigns combined with visual signs. Soproni et al. (2002) found that the position of a pointing arm \nwas more important for showing the dog the direction to a food source than the direction of \nmovement of the arm. If the pointing gesture became unclear for the dog for any reason, it \ntended to rely on the body position rather than the direction of the arm.  \nPongracz et al. (2001) stated that \u201cthere is no evidence for the role that actual utterances might \nplay in eliciting actions from the dogs. It is possible that the effect of verbal commands is \nmarginal in most situations, and that dogs cannot discriminate between human verbal signals \nsuch as humans do\u201d. The results of this study support the suggestion that dogs do not generally \nunderstand words in the same way as humans.  Although they can discriminate between human \nverbal signals (Fukuzawa et al., 2005b), the current results suggest that responsiveness is \naffected by familiarity with the verbal information in both its verbal and geographic context. \nSince attention capacity is limited, it might be suggested that these factors reduce the signal : \nnoise ratio within the message trying to be conveyed.   Response appears impaired particularly \nwhen additional verbal information precedes a less well established command, as both the \n\u201cname and pause\u201d (n + p) and the \u201cnovel word\u201d (b) preceding the new command (NC) \nsignificantly decreased the number of correct responses. The known command (KC) was only \ninfluenced by \u201cb\u201d. The name preceding the command did not significantly influence the \nprobability of a correct response for either the KC or the NC.  It seems reasonable to assume \nthat a dog\u2019s name is often used in every day life situation and so dogs might learn to \ndiscriminate this element of any instruction. In this case, hearing its name preceding a command \nhas no influence on the information that follows, i.e. it does not have a \u201cconfusing effect\u201d on the \nfollowing instruction. However, response to both commands declined significantly when the \nnovel word was inserted prior to the command, suggesting that the type of verbal information \npreceding a command is important. By contrast, Sarris (1931) observed that his dogs were \ncapable of recognising important information (i.e. a command) within a series of words (in \nSarris\u2019 study the German command was embedded in a Greek song). However, teasing out the \nimportant information seems to be even more difficult in a new and unfamiliar context, as \ndemonstrated by the results from Room B.  \n \nAdding an arbitrary pause between the dog\u2019s name and the command can lead to a further \ndecline in performance. Although the KC was not influenced by the \u201cn + p\u201d in the familiar \ncontext, it was in the unfamiliar one and the NC was affected in both situations. As already \nnoted, the NC was, in general, influenced more by extraneous factors. This may relate to \nfamiliarity with the command and\/or the degree to which it had become established.   Overall, \nthe results of this study support the supposition by Pongracz et al. (2001) that \u201chuman-dog \nacoustic communication could be highly situation-dependent\u201d.  \nAlthough dogs are able to generalise a command from one signaller to another, e.g. from the \nhandler to another person giving the same command (Miklosi et al., 1998), the current study \nindicates that they might have trouble generalising from one location to another and that this \nmay be a function of experience.  \n5 Conclusion \nThe results suggest that the focus of a dog\u2019s attention and additional verbal information given \nprior to the command can decrease its apparent obedience. In particular responsiveness may be \naffected by non-informative verbiage preceding important information. The change in response \nis also affected by the novelty of the environment relative to where it was taught and also \nfamiliarity with the command, with less well established commands being more susceptible to \neven familiar preceding verbiage such as the dog\u2019s name.  In practical terms, these findings \nsuggest that there might be a difference in the usefulness of additional verbal information in an \nobedience context. These results are consistent with the experience of dog trainers and handlers.  \nDog handlers should be aware of how different types of verbal information and the change of \ncontext can influence their dog\u2019s responsiveness and of the extent to which dogs need to be \ntaught to generalize command stimuli to novel contexts. \n6 Acknowledgements \nThis study was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.  \n7 References \nCoutellier, L. 2006.

The duration of the \ntwo information forms was not included in this analysis.  \n\u2022 \u201cOnly one command was given\u201d: this refers only to C, not \nto any other information (verbal, visual or tactile) the \nhandler might have given during the interaction.   \nnonverbal \ninformation \nshown by the \nhandler apart from \nthe commands \nThis information was categorised as follows:  \n\u2022 \u201ctreat\u201d: which included moving a hand to where the treat \nwas kept (pocket, bag, etc), holding a treat in his\/her hand \nthroughout the command and luring the dog with a treat.  \n\u2022 \u201clead\u201d: which was defined as tugging on the lead ranging \nfrom a gentle movement to a rough tug.  \n\u2022 \u201cOther\u201d: which included possible information given by the \nhands or arms, such as lifting a finger or an arm; by the \nhead, such as nodding; by the legs, such as taking a big step \nback, or bending down over the dog. \nrelative \norientation of the \ndog and handler to \neach other \nthe relative orientation refers to the orientation of the body, not \nthe head, hence differs from points 1 and 2, which refer to \nattention. Hence, a dog might be evaluated to be oriented \ntowards the handler, but not looking at its handler. \ndog\u2019s behaviour \nbefore, during and \nimmediately after \nthe command \nit was noted whether the dog showed one or several of the \nfollowing behaviours: lip licking, blinking, yawning, \nscratching, sniffing, turning head away from handler, turning \nback to handler, slow movements, shaking, other. \nusing the \n\u201ccorrect\u201d \ncommands \nin a questionnaire preceding the taping, the handlers were asked \nto describe their usual verbal, visual and tactile commands for a \nseries of behaviours, including the command \u201csit\u201d. This \ninformation was then compared with what they actually did and \nscored as either being \u201ccorrect\u201d, i.e. what the handler had said \nagreed with what he\/she did, or \u201cother\u201d. A correct score \nincluded both giving the correct command as well as not giving \n any other command, if previously noted in the questionnaire \nthat this was the case. If the information given by the handler \ndiffered from what they had predicted in the questionnaire, it \nwas labelled as \u201cother\u201d, independent of whether this was giving \nanother command, giving other verbal, visual or tactile \ninformation or not giving a command when claimed to give one \nin this situation.  \nThis category was subdivided into \u201cverbal agreement\u201d, i.e. the \nhandler gave the actual verbal command he\/she had predicted \nand \u201ctactile agreement\u201d, i.e. the handler gave the actual tactile \ncommand he\/she had predicted.)\n \n \n9.1.1 Table 2  \n9.1.2 Category Details Frequency % Total Total (%) \nVerbal C -> nonverbal C 1 1.8 \nVerbal C -> nonverbal O 4 7.1 \nVerbal O -> nonverbal C 2 3.6 \nVerbal \ninformation \npreceding \nnonverbal \ninformation \nVerbal O -> nonverbal O 2 3.6 \n9.0 16.1 \nVerbal C -> verbal O 1 1.8 Verbal \ninformation Verbal O -> verbal C 18 32.1 \n19.0 33.9 \nSimultaneous C 4 7.1 \nSimultaneous verbal C -> \nnonverbal O 9 16.1 Simultaneous \ninformation \nSimultaneous verbal O \u2013 \nnonverbal C 0 0.0 \n13.0 23.2 \nNonverbal C -> verbal C 3 5.4 Nonverbal \ninformation \npreceding verbal \ninformation  \nNonverbal O -> verbal C 31 55.4 \n34.0 60.7 \nOnly verbal C 7 12.5 Only one type of \ncommand Only nonverbal C 2 3.6 9.0 16.1 \n \nCategory = new category; Details = old categories, Frequency = number of participants showing the \nbehaviour in absolute numbers and as percentage (%); Total = number of participants showing \nbehaviour of new category in absolute numbers and as percentage (Total (%)); C = command; O = \nother information \n \nTable 3 \nObedience Chi square DF p-value \n(2-sided) \ndog\u2019s attention 10.574 1 0.001 \nverbal information preceding verbal command 10.206 1 0.001 \nsimultaneous information 3.656 1 0.056 \nonly one command 2.175 1 0.14 \nverbal agreement 2.944 1 0.086 \ntactile agreement 2.944 1 0.086 \norientation 2.729 1 0.099 \ndog behaviour 5.38 1 0.02 \nnonverbal information preceding verbal information 2.944 1 0.086 \nlead 1.309 1 0.253 \ntreat 1.197 1 0.274 \n \n Table 4 \ncombination name \u201cnonsense\u201c word pause \nknown  \ncommand \nnew  \ncommand \n1    x  \n2 x   x  \n3 x  x x  \n4  x  x  \n5     x \n6 x    x \n7 x  x  x \n8  x   x \n \nTable 5 \nScore Explanation  \n0 No response within 5 seconds of the command  \n1 A nonspecific response to the command; for \nexample the dog orients towards the trainer, raises \na paw or wags its tail, or the dog shows the \nbehaviour that corresponds to the other command \nResponses 0 to 2 are \nconsidered as \u201cincorrect \nresponse\u201d \n2 An incomplete response to the command; e.g. the \ndog may stop a started command, \u201cchange its \nmind\u201d \n \n3 A complete but delayed response to the command, \nwith the delay to completion not exceeding 5 \nseconds, correct response to repetition of the \ncommand (max 1 repetition) \n \n \nResponses 3 and 4 are \nconsidered as \u201ccorrect  \n4 A complete and instant response to the command response\u201d \n \n \n \n"}
