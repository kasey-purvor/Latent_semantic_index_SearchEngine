INTRODUCTION\nThere is currently a great deal of interest in group-III\nnitride compounds and alloys due to their potential techno-\nlogical importance, particularly for blue-green light emitting\ndevices.1 As an aid in the optimization of the electronic\nand\/or optical properties of optical sources, accurate band-\nstructure information is required for the various layers of\nmaterial, under the appropriate strains, which make up the\ndevice. Unfortunately, there is limited experimental informa-\ntion available on the electronic structure of the alloys rel-\nevant to the devices that are currently the center of attention.\nIt would, therefore, be particularly helpful to obtain theoret-\nical band structure, as well as parameters for band-structure\nmodels which can form the basis for calculations of the op-\ntical properties and for device modeling and design.\nDespite the problems with the growth of group-III ni-\ntrides, there has been much improvement in the quality of\nsamples of the compounds. As a result, increasingly accurate\nmeasurements of some physical quantities have been made\nincluding lattice parameters,2\u20134 principal band gaps,5\u20137 and\nsplitting energies of bands.8\u201310 The experimental activity has\ncontinued to stimulate theoretical studies of the electronic\nstructure of these materials.11 There have been a large num-\nber of theoretical studies of the compounds, including\nfirst-principles,12 semi-empirical pseudopotential,13 and\nk\u0096p14,15 calculations. However, there has been much less\nwork on the GaAlN and GaInN alloys, and little information\non their band-structure exists.\nIn this theoretical work, a semi-empirical pseudopoten-\ntial method is used to obtain potentials for the compounds\nthat form the basis of band-structure calculations for the al-\nloys. In this article we report the results of calculations of the\nprincipal band gap of GaAlN and GaInN alloys over the full\nrange of possible compositions and for both wurtzite and\nzinc-blende structures. In addition, k\u0096p parameters have been\nobtained for a number of wurtzite alloys that are relevant to\ndevices.\nII. RESULTS\nIn earlier work, the authors performed band-structure\ncalculations on bulk nitride materials11 using the semi-\nempirical pseudopotential method. Here, we use a similar\napproach to study the electronic structure of GaInN and\nGaAlN alloys in both the zinc-blende and wurtzite forms.\nThe theoretical framework used is essentially the pseudopo-\ntential method of Cohen and Chelikowsky.16 Supporting\nfirst-principles calculations have also been performed using\nVASP, a density functional theory-pseudopotential based\ncode.17\u201319\nThe semi-empirical pseudopotential form factors, V(G),\nare derived from a suitable constructed V(q) function. This\nfunction is obtained for GaN, AlN, and InN using a Monte\nCarlo approach which adjusts the parameters of the function\nuntil the band structure is in good agreement with experi-\nmental and first-principles results for unstrained material.\nThe advantage of using such a function is that it provides a\nversatile platform for deriving pseudopotentials representing\nstrained materials and alloys. The equations describing the\nsymmetric Vs and antisymmetric Va parts of the pseudopo-\ntential ~in Rydbergs! are defined in Eq. ~1!, in which q is in\nunits of (2p\/azb) where azb is the equilibrium lattice param-\neter in zinc-blende.\nVs5\na1q21a2\n11exp~a3@a42q2# !\n,\nVa5~a1q1a2!exp~a3@a42q2# !.\n~1!\nFor each of the three compounds GaN, AlN, and InN, in\nboth crystal structures, semiempirical pseudopotentials have\nbeen generated by fitting energy eigenvalues to band-\nstructure data from experiment and first-principles calcula-\ntions ~notably Rubio et al.12! through variation of the ai , i\n51...4. This is the same procedure described in our previous\nwork,11 and the pseudopotentials used here for zinc-blende\nare identical. New sets of values of ai have been obtained for\nthe wurtzite structures. The coefficients of the V(q) func-\ntions obtained are shown in Table I.a!Electronic mail: D.J.Dugdale@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 86, NUMBER 7 1 OCTOBER 1999\n37680021-8979\/99\/86(7)\/3768\/5\/$15.00 \u00a9 1999 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

These are\ndefined as\nag5\ndEg\ndlogV , ~2!\nwhere Eg is the band gap, and V is the unit-cell volume.\nUsing the continuous V(q) description for the pseudopoten-\ntial, a set of form factors can be obtained which represent the\nhydrostatically strained bulk material. This is achieved by\ndetermining the values of the scaled V(q) function for the\nstrained unit cell volume, at the associated strained G values.\nFor comparison, the deformation potentials were also calcu-\nlated from first principles, using VASP. The results obtained\nusing the two theoretical approaches, together with those\nfrom the literature, are shown in Table II. They show that for\nthe zinc-blende materials, our semi-empirical approach tends\nto produce larger values than the first-principles calculations.\nFor the wurtzite materials, there is close agreement for AlN\nbut the semi-empirical result for GaN is rather smaller. How-\never, there is little reliable information available from experi-\nment, and the theoretical results are not always consistent.\nIn order to calculate the band structure of our virtual\ncrystal ternary alloy, appropriate form factors are derived\nfrom the V(q) functions for the relevant binary compounds.\nThe alloy lattice constant, and hence, the appropriate unit-\ncell volume and G values for the alloy, are obtained using\nVegard\u2019s Law, and represent unstrained material. Both the\nsymmetric and antisymmetric form factors for the A12xBxN\nalloy at a given G are given by the expression\nValloy~G !5VA~G !~12x !1VB~G !x , ~3!\nwhere the individual VA(G), VB(G) are obtained using Eq.\n~1! at the alloy G values. In effect, due to the different lattice\nconstants of the original A, B compounds and the binary\nalloys, this amounts to a shift along the V(q) curves from the\noriginal VA,B , followed by a weighted averaging.\nFor the case of Ga0.5In0.5N, Fig. 1 shows the antisym-\nmetric form factors obtained as pluses and the symmetric\nform factors as crosses. Also shown are the compound form\nfactors ~indicated by circles and squares for InN and GaN,\nrespectively!, and the V(q) curves from which the alloy form\nfactors are derived.\nTABLE I.

For GaAlN and GaInN, the\nin-plane lattice parameter a has been held at the GaN value\n~3.19 \u00c5!, corresponding to the situation of the alloy being\ngrown on a GaN substrate. The corresponding perpendicular\nlattice parameter c was calculated using the first-principles\ncode. The values of c obtained with a53.19 \u00c5 were: for InN,\nc56.288 \u00c5; and for AlN, c54.736 \u00c5. The c parameter for a\ngiven alloy was then obtained by a linear interpolation.\nForm factors for the full range of Ga12xAlxN and\nGa12xInxN alloys have been calculated, and are used in the\nband-structure calculations. For the zinc-blende materials,\nthe unstrained alloys only have been considered, but for\nwurtzite, both strained and unstrained calculations have been\nperformed. Of particular interest are the band gaps as a func-\ntion of alloy composition x, and these are shown in Fig. 2 for\nthe GaAlN alloy, and Fig. 3 for the GaInN alloy.\nOur calculations predict that the band gap varies almost\nlinearly with composition in zinc-blende Ga12xAxlN. As the\nconduction band energy at the X point is also plotted on this\ndiagram, the direct-indirect crossover can be seen. It is found\nthat this occurs at an Al fraction x50.57, in agreement with\nother calculations.13,22 In the wurtzite case, the inclusion of\nstrain has little effect on GaAlN but somewhat more for\nGaInN, where there is significant bowing as in the zinc-\nblende case. Also shown on this figure are some experimen-\ntal data ~labelled A! compiled from various sources,23 and\nfurther experimental data ~labelled B! valid for strained\nGa12xInxN grown on GaN, with x<0.12.24 Note that there is\na slight offset in the value of Eg at x50 due to our original\nFIG. 2.

Recent additional experimental results for\nsmall x25,26 show similar trends. Other theoretical work27 at-\ntributes the large band-gap bowing to In-localized hole states\nin the upper valence band rather than the large lattice mis-\nmatch between the two materials. Our model cannot repre-\nsent this, but nevertheless appears to give a good description\nof the band-gap bowing.\nThe k\u0096p band-structure method15 is particularly useful\nfor modeling the electronic structure and optical properties\nof simple heterostructures and devices. A set of k\u0096p param-\neters have been derived for each of the three wurtzite com-\npounds using our pseudopotential results. These consist of\nAi (i51...7) parameters which determine the shape of the\nbands, and D i (i51...3) parameters which determine split-\nting energies. The parameter A7 if often neglected but Ren,\nLiu, and Blood27 have recently shown how the lifting of the\ndegeneracy of the valence bands near the anticrossing feature\ncan be modeled extremely well by its inclusion, and hence, is\nalso used here.\nThe technique involved using a Monte Carlo approach to\nfit the k\u0096p parameters to the semi-empirical band structure\nfor each material. The k\u0096p parameters used for the wurtzite\nmaterials are shown in Table III, and a plot of the band\nstructure for GaN near the G point is shown in Fig. 4.\nFor several specific wurtzite alloy concentrations, the\nband structure was studied in more detail and a set of k\u0096p\nparameters derived, using a method identical to that for the\ncompounds. The alloys chosen were of small Al or In frac-\ntion, as these are the most commonly used in quantum well\ndevices. For Ga12xInxN, the In fractions considered were\nx50.05, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.15. For Ga12xAlxN, the Al frac-\ntions chosen were x50.05, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20. The\nk\u0096p parameters are shown in Table IV for GaAlN and Table\nV for GaInN. In addition, band-structure plots for\nGa0.80Al0.20N and Ga0.85In0.15N are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\nThe original pseudopotential band structure and fitted k\u0096p\nresults are in good agreement in most cases, and particularly\nso at small wave vector. Note that there is a flip over in the\nnormal ordering of the bands for Ga0.85In0.15N.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nA series of semi-empirical pseudopotentials have been\nderived which correspond to a range of GaAlN and GaInN\nalloys of wurtzite and zinc-blende structure.
