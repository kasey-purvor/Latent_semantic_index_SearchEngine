These la-\nsers are being developed for ultrasensitive spectroscopic ap-\nplications and free space communications. This requires di-\nrect and reproducible wavelength tunability for a signal\naveraging over a specified temporal and spectral interval. At\npresent, the narrow-band-gap semiconductor lasers have\nstrong nonradiative recombination and are being aggres-\nsively developed towards improving laser operation tempera-\nture and output power.1\u20134 Among them a laser tunability and\nstable single-frequency continuous wave ~cw! operation are\nthe subjects of investigations since they are important param-\neters for the laser applications. A laser tunability over 1.1\u2013\n1.9 cm21 with a rate of 0.02\u20130.03 cm21\/mA has been re-\nported for InAsSb cw lasers.5 A single-frequency tunable cw\nemission with a side mode suppression ratio ~SMSR! down\nto 229 dB has been obtained at 3.4 mm where the laser tunes\nover a range of 1.2 cm21 with a rate of 0.032 cm21\/mA.6 The\nmodulation bandwidth of InAsSb cw laser is compatible with\nthat of available photodetectors.7 The lasers are optimized\nfor high modal power.8\u20139 The application of an external\ngrating-tuned cavity to the InAsSb cw lasers improves the\ntuning range up to 48 cm21.10 The potential for extending the\ntuning range of Fabry\u2013Pe\u00b4rot devices has been demonstrated\nunder pulsed operation: The tuning without mode hoppings\nup to 4.4 cm21 with a rate of 0.018\u20130.078 cm21\/mA was\nobtained under 0.3\u201320 ms width current pulses.11 The 14 ms\nwidth pulsed and quasi-cw InAsSb lasers tune over 10 cm21\nwith a rate of 0.03\u20130.21 cm21\/mA.12,13 The pulsed lasers\ntuned in both the long- and short-wavelength direction. How-\never, detailed data about the temperature and current depen-\ndencies of the wavelength tuning of InAsSb cw lasers are\nstill not reported.\nIn this letter, we investigate a tuning behavior of a\na!Electronic mail: a.krier@lancaster.ac.uk3670003-6951\/2002\/80(20)\/3676\/3\/$19.00continuous-wave InAsSb single-frequency lasers emitting at\n3.3 mm. The laser mode shifts and tuning rates are examined\nagainst injection current and heat sink temperature. Blue-side\ntunability of InAsSb cw lasers by both the injection current\nand the heat sink temperature is discussed.\nThe lasers used in the tests were a double heterostructure\n~DH! with a ternary 0.8-mm-thick InAs0.95Sb0.05 active layer\nand 3-mm-thick InAs0.48Sb0.17P0.35 cladding layers grown on\nan ~100! oriented InAs substrate by liquid phase epitaxy. The\ncap was 1-mm-thick InAs layer. The undoped InAsSb active\narea had n-type background electron concentration of lower\n1016 cm23. The devices were 10-mm-wide, 250\u2013275-mm-\nlong ~5\u20135.5 cm21 mode spacing!, deep-mesa-stripe, and\nFabry\u2013Pe\u00b4rot diode lasers in which the active layer thickness\nand the chip geometry were chosen for a single-frequency\noperation. The chips were mounted epi-side up on a cooper\nheat sink block and placed inside a cryogenic laser Dewar\n~Laser Photonics, L5736!. The laser power was measured by\nan electronically calibrated pyroelectric power meter ~Laser\nPrecision, RS5900A, and 1% absolute accuracy!. The longi-\ntudinal mode structure is investigated by a 1\/2 m Czerny\u2013\nTurner monochromator. The signal was processed by a high\ndynamic range data acquisition system. The laser tuning was\ncalibrated with a Fabry\u2013Pe\u00b4rot E\u00b4 talon ~0.0307 cm21 free\nspectral range, 3.0 fitness!. Reflective optics were used to\nminimize back reflections into the laser cavity.\nAt 82 K, the cw threshold current I th was 19\u201321 mA,\ncorresponding to a threshold current density of 700\u2013750\nA\/cm2. The temperature dependence of the threshold current\nreveals a characteristic temperature of 21 K ~between 78 and\n100 K!. An output power is in the range of 0.3 mW. The laser\nemits in the vicinity of 3.28 mm ~3047 cm21!. Figure 1 rep-\nresents the three-dimensional-contour lasing spectra versus\nthe injection current at a temperature of 82 K. Between 1.6\nand 5.5 of the threshold, the side mode suppression ratio\n~SMSR! is of 223 to 27 dB and corresponds to a single-\nfrequency operation. In the vicinity of the mode hopping and\nin the presence of a sufficient side mode, the SMSR is at6 \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics\n3677Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 80, No. 20, 20 May 2002 Sherstnev et al.least 213 to 15 dB. As the injection current changes between\n1 and 8 I th , the main longitudinal, mode shifts from 3.2834\nto 3.2763 mm.\nFigure 2 shows the lasing wave number against the in-\njection current at heat sink temperatures in the range of\n82\u201398 K. At each temperature over the entire current range,\nthe wave number exhibits a nonlinear shift with increasing\ncurrent to the blue side. Below 92 K, the current tuning\nexceeds the temperature tuning and vice versa above 92 K.\nThe current tuning range decreases linearly with an increas-\ning of temperature from 7.5 to 2.2 cm21 at 82 and 98 K,\nrespectively. The temperature tuning depends on the current.\nAt lower currents, the wave number shifts with the tempera-\nture to the blue side. At higher currents, the shift is observed\nto the red side at temperatures below 92 K and to the blue\nside above. In the inset in Fig. 2, the shift of wave number\nwith temperature at constant current of 90 mA, changes di-\nrection: The red side is observed below 90 K, but the blue\nside above 92 K. The small temperature tuning range was a\nresult of a large band filling as a result of the increase in I th\nwith temperature and very small T0 . The dependence taken\nat constant pumping above the threshold (2I th) demonstrates\na linear shift towards the blue side.\nThe current tuning rates change nonlinearly against the\nFIG. 1.

The temperature dependence of the laser mode shift taken at\n90 mA dc and at 2I th shown in the inset.current ~the plot at 82 K is presented in the inset in Fig. 3!\nand consist of three regions. Below the 1.5 I th rate and above\n3.6 I th , the rates slightly increase with current in the range of\n0.015\u20130.017 cm21\/mA. The maximum rate of 0.089\ncm21\/mA is obtained at 4.1 I th . The similar current depen-\ndences are observed at higher temperatures but the maximum\nrate ~Fig. 3! is decreased with temperature from 0.089 to\n0.029 cm21\/mA at 82 and 98 K, respectively. Figure 3 dem-\nonstrates the dependence of the temperature tuning rate at\n100 mA dc versus the heat sink temperature. The redshift\nbelow 92 K has a rate of 20.19 to 20.27 cm21\/K at 82 and\n86 K, respectively. The blueshift above 92 K has a rate up to\n0.27 cm21\/K at 98 K. Note that a rate of the red-side tem-\nperature tuning is less than the tuning to blue side and the\ntemperature dependence of the band gap ~22.8 cm21\/K!.\nThe most important feature of the laser is the blue-side\ntuning around 1.5\u20135 I th ~at 82 K!. This allows us to extend\nthe continuous tuning range over the Fabry\u2013Pe\u00b4rot mode\nspacing, from a value of 2 cm21 typically reported for\nInAsSb cw lasers5,6 to above 7 cm21.14 The blue-side tuning\nby current in InAsSb DH cw laser is commonly explained by\nthe bandfilling. Band filling has been observed in III\u2013V di-\node lasers with a high level of internal losses and low char-\nacteristic temperature T0 even above the threshold.15 The\ncurrent tuning to the blue side was observed previously in\npulsed11\u201313 and cw5 InAsSb lasers. It is explained by inter-\nvalence band absorption ~IVBA! which caused an increase in\nthe carrier density and, hence, decreased the effective refrac-\ntive index in the active region above the threshold.5,11,13,16\nRecently the shift was attributed to the forming of a smooth\noptical waveguide across the laser cavity that radiation flux\noscillates maintaining its own frequency and intensity.12\nFigure 4 shows the differential quantum efficiency hd\nversus current. The efficiency is a nonlinear function of a\ncurrent and reaches a maximum at ;1.5\u20131.6 I th , decreases\nrapidly, and saturates at currents over 4 I th at 82\u201392 K.\nAbove 92 K, hd decreases to negative values without satu-\nration. Over the entire region the hd is below 1%\u20132%. This\nlow value is due to the narrow stripe geometry of the laser\ncavity and long interband relaxation time of 0.1\u20130.6 ps9\nwhich was applied to obtain a single frequency lasing with a\nhigh SMSR. For comparison, a hd as high as 30%, a mode\nFIG. 3.

For a\nlow hd , most of the current becomes heat. From Fig. 4, the\ncarrier heating can be roughly estimated to be as high as\n0.8\u20131.5 K\/mA ~between 1.5 and 4 I th at 82 K!. As the heat-\ning reduces the gain, increases the IVBA and enhances Au-\nger recombination, it makes the hd nonlinear. A reduction of\nthe efficiency is observed above 1.7 I th . As the efficiency\ndrops above 2I th , the effective carrier temperature saturates\nat high pumping rates. Therefore, in cw operation with the\nheating under saturation, a change in a pumping rate changes\na carrier concentration above the threshold. Thus it affects\nthe band filling and the refractive index. Carrier heating\ngives rise to a blue-side tunability which quickly increases\nwith the current. The tunability is limited by the generated\nheat. A simplified calculation of the tuning, resulting from\nthermal expansion of the laser crystal and the tuning, result-\ning in a variation of the refractive index,17 show that under\nthe heating they would be of similar magnitude at 0.085\ncm21\/mA but opposite in the tuning direction and counteract\neach other. From Figs. 1\u20134, we can see that the current tun-\nability is low in the regions corresponding to the mode com-\npetition and a low SMSR. The most significant tunability\nwas achieved in the region of a decrease of hd ~at 82 K,\nbetween 1.5 and 4 I th! where strong heating occurs.\nFIG. 4. The cw differential quantum efficiency against normalized injection\ncurrent taken at heat sink temperatures between 82 and 98 K. The depen-\ndence of hd vs inverse temperature taken at maximum is included in the\ninset.In summary, we present a detailed analysis of the tuning\ncharacteristics of InAsSb continuous-wave single-frequency\nlasers emitting at 3.3 mm ~3050 cm21! versus current and\ntemperature. The lasers demonstrate a continuous tuning\nrange of 27.5 cm21 by changing the current and 23.5 cm21\nby changing the heat sink temperature without mode hopping\nover the mode spacing. The laser tunes to the blue side with\nincreasing both injection current and heat sink temperature\nwith rates of 20.015 to 20.089 cm21\/mA and 20.19 to 0.27\ncm21\/K. The laser can tune to the red side by changing the\ntemperature only inside a narrow temperature interval. The\nextended tunability is attributed to the carrier heating effect\nin the cw operation and the band-filling effect in the presence\nof strong losses.\nA.P. wishes to acknowledge the Alexander von Hum-\nboldt Stiftung for a fellowship.
