INTRODUCTION\nMonitoring the status of wild bird populations at a national (or even higher) level\nis becoming increasingly common (Sauer, Hines, Gough, Thomas and Peterjohn, 1997;\nVan Strien, Pannekoek and Gibbons, 2001). Surveys on this large geographic scale tend\n1CREEM, University of St Andrews, Buchanan Gardens, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9LZ, UK.\n2Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Crowmarsh Gifford, Wallingford, Oxfordshire OX10 8BB, UK.\n\u2217Corresponding author (vanessa@mcs.st-and.ac.uk)\n1\n2 V. M. Cave et al.\nto require volunteer-based input at a sample of sites selected either according to a for-\nmal design or ad hoc by the volunteers themselves. Such projects are usually orientated\ntowards gathering data to estimate either abundance or various demographic parame-\nters (survival, or components of the productivity of young). This information forms the\nknowledge base that underpins conservation action, for example in the UK the value of\nabundance indices is illustrated by their use in the establishment of Biodiversity Action\nPlans (Gregory, Noble and Custance, 2004).\nOf increasing interest is the relationship between abundance and the underlying de-\nmographic parameters. This relationship is usually expressed mathematically in the form\nof a matrix-based population model (Caswell, 2001), which serves to relate the abundance\nin a given year as a function of that in the previous year(s) and the intermediate vital\nand reproductive rates. Many papers have been published in which abundance and demo-\ngraphic parameters are simultaneously estimated using data from two or more different\nsurveys (Brooks, King and Morgan, 2004; Besbeas and Freeman, 2006; Schaub, Gimenez,\nSierro and Artellaz, 2007; Reynolds et al., 2009). Such analyses, which combine different\nsources of data, are generally referred to as \u201cIntegrated Population Models\u201d.\nTypically, indices of abundance are derived from annual counts at a series of sites\n(Underhill and Pry\u02c6s-Jones, 1994; Peach, Baillie and Balmer, 1998; Fewster, Buckland,\nSiriwardena, Baillie and Wilson, 2000), and survival estimates from ringing data (Peach,\n1993; Siriwardena, Baillie and Wilson, 1999; Brooks, Catchpole and Morgan, 2000). Pro-\nductivity rates in integrated models have been previously estimated either as a free param-\neter in the population model (Besbeas, Freeman, Morgan and Catchpole, 2002; Besbeas\nand Freeman, 2006; King, Brooks, Mazzetta, Freeman and Morgan, 2008), or by including\nestimates of breeding success (at least on a per nesting attempt basis) from nest record\ndata (Freeman, Robinson, Clark, Griffin and Adams, 2007; Reynolds et al., 2009).\nIn this paper we describe the first integrated model to adopt a different source of\ninformation, namely annual survey data from \u201cConstant Effort\u201d ringing programmes, for\nexample the British Trust for Ornithology\u2019s (BTO) Constant Effort Site (CES) scheme\nand the North American Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) pro-\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 3\ngram (DeSante, O\u2019Grady and Pyle, 1999). Such schemes provide information on the key\ndemographic parameters: abundance, productivity and adult survival, making them par-\nticularly amenable to an integrated approach to population modelling. In order to obtain\nestimates for these demographic parameters independent models have been developed.\nBuilding upon these existing models, we formulate an integrated model by specifying\na meaningful functional relationship between these demographic parameters. This inte-\ngrated approach has the advantage of producing estimates that are consistent with both\nthe data and, according to the relationship imposed by the underlying population dynam-\nics, with one another. In addition, measures of productivity over an entire season (uniting\nmultiple broods, and allowing for immediate post-fledging mortality) are available.\nSurvival rates have long been estimated from the live-recapture type of data gathered\nin a Constant Effort scheme. Indeed, they are particularly valuable for this, although\nonly rates for adult birds tend to be estimable. However the presence of transient birds\nin the catch data (i.e. non-resident birds observed only once as they pass through the\ncatch site) produces a negative bias in the estimates of survival (Pradel, Hines, Lebreton\nand Nichols, 1997). We build upon the model of Pradel et al. (1997) to estimate the\nproportion of transient birds in the sample, making use of specific advantages in this\nrespect customarily provided by Constant Effort data, and one that can be adopted\neither in isolation or as part of an integrated analysis.\nDespite adult birds exhibiting strong breeding philopatry (Wernham et al., 2002) some\npermanent emigration from the site of breeding, but within the domain of the population\nis expected, the extent of which is typically unknown. The integrated model enables both\nthe magnitude of permanent emigration to be assessed and the estimates of adult survival\nfrom Constant Effort data to be adjusted accordingly.\nThe high dispersal of juvenile birds usually prevents accurate estimation of survival in\nthe first year of life using Constant Effort data on live-recaptures in subsequent ringing\nsessions. Separate information, from an entirely different data source, can however be\nobtained from models for recoveries of dead birds, for which there is again a long history\n(Seber, 1971; Burnham, 1990). For most small passerine species, especially long-distance\n4 V. M. Cave et al.\nmigrants, these data are however too few to provide precise survival estimates when\nanalysed in isolation. Only by integration with other sources of data can juvenile survival\nbe usefully calculated. We show that an integrated approach has an additional advantage;\nit gives precise inference on juvenile survival even with limited ring-recovery data.\nIn Section 2 we introduce the methods underlying Constant Effort ringing, and the\ntheory underlying an Integrated Population Model for such data. In Section 3 we fit the\nmodels to a set of data describing captures of Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenabaenus\nunder the longest-running such scheme, overseen by the BTO. The paper concludes with\ndiscussion in Section 4. Throughout we assume the population monitored is closed, with\nall emigration and transient movements between breeding sites occurring within the UK.\n2. DATA AND STATISTICAL MODELS\n2.1 \u201cConstant Effort\u201d Data\nThe BTO\u2019s CES scheme is a volunteer ringing programme conducted annually at a\nlarge number of sites. Volunteers aim to visit their particular site on twelve separate\noccasions that span the breeding season (May-August), and use a standardised mist-\nnetting procedure, within and between years, to capture birds. Captures include both\njuvenile birds (i.e. those born within the current CES season that are a few weeks old at\nmost), and adult birds (i.e. those born in a previous CES season). All birds caught are\nfitted with individually identifying aluminium rings. Over 100 sites now provide data to\nthe scheme annually, and from these the scheme routinely monitors 25 species (Baillie et\nal., 2009). Note that each CES visit is limited to one of 10-11 possible days, and successive\nvisits to the same site are never less than 3 days apart, usually more. More comprehensive\ndescriptions of the history and field procedure are given by numerous sources (Peach et al.,\n1998; Robinson, Freeman, Balmer and Grantham, 2007). We consider in detail data for\nSedge Warblers, one of the most frequently encountered species under the CES scheme.\nStudies of Sedge Warblers are particularly interesting as this species is known to be\nsusceptible to environmental change (Peach, Baillie and Underhill, 1991).\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 5\nA typical segment of CES data giving the full capture history for an individual bird\nwould be:\nA334831 SEDWA AD 301 1995 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nA334831 SEDWA AD 301 1996 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nA334831 SEDWA AD 301 1997 9 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 9\nFrom left to right the columns represent the ring ID, species, age, site of capture, year\nof capture and the twelve-visit capture history in which \u201c9\u201d denotes a missed visit, and\notherwise, \u201c1\u201d denotes capture and \u201c0\u201d that the bird was unobserved. For example, Sedge\nWarbler A334831 was caught as an adult at site 301 in 1995, 1996 and 1997. At site 301,\nin 1997, mist-netting was not carried out at visits 1 and 12, but for those visits made\nA334831 was caught only at visits 4 and 6.\nWe consider here data for which the full 12 visits are made within each year, 56% of\nthe total data set. For example, in the above segment of data records from site 301 in\n1997 would be excluded. When one or more visits are missed an incomplete capture record\nresults, and the assumption of constant annual effort for that year is violated. This lack\nof constant effort requires special treatment, and methods for dealing with missed visits\nin the separate modelling of survival and abundance are discussed in Cave, Freeman,\nBrooks and King (2008) and Cave, Freeman, Brooks, King and Balmer (2009).\nThe full data set of complete capture records contains 192 sites at which Sedge War-\nblers have been ringed, however many of these have been operated for few years, and\/or\ncaught only a few Sedge Warblers. Sites with such sparse data contribute little infor-\nmation to the analyses at the cost of extra site-specific parameters. Therefore we work\nwith a slightly reduced data set which contains only those sites with complete capture\nrecords for 4 years or more that caught appreciable numbers of Sedge Warblers (at least\n10 adults, and at least 10 juveniles over the duration of its operation). This reduced,\n\u201cbest\u201d sites data set contains 71 sites which, between them, contribute 78% of the total\nnumber of captures (Table 1).\n[Table 1 about here.]\n6 V. M. Cave et al.\n2.2 Estimating Abundance and Productivity\nWe are interested in making inference regarding the population of adult birds breeding\nin the UK, and the numbers of juvenile birds they produce. Strictly, the CES scheme\nprovides data on adult and juvenile birds at the sites surveyed, however these birds can\nbe assumed to be representative of the wider UK population (Peach et al., 1998).\nGiven that the full complement of 12 visits is carried out at site g in year t the\nnumbers of unique adult and juvenile birds caught are denoted by nagt and n\nj\ngt respectively.\nA natural estimate of the trend in adult abundance follows by assuming that the nagt\nare independent, random variables from a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bbagt. We\nexpress \u03bbagt as a log-linear combination of an intercept term, \u03b2\na, plus site- and year-specific\neffects, sag and y\na\nt respectively (Peach et al., 1998; Cave et al., 2009). Mathematically,\nln(\u03bbagt) = \u03b2\na + sag + y\na\nt . (1)\nAn estimated index of adult abundance in year t is given by At = exp(y\na\nt ).\nSimilarly, for juveniles, we assume that the njgt are independent, random variables\nfrom a Poisson(\u03bbjgt) distribution and form the analogous log-linear model to (1) for \u03bb\nj\ngt:\nln(\u03bbjgt) = \u03b2\nj + sjg + y\nj\nt . (2)\nAn estimated index of juvenile abundance in year t is given by Jt = exp(y\nj\nt ).\nFor identifiability, the first year effect and an arbitrary reference site effect in both\n(1) and (2) are constrained to zero.\nWe define the true seasonal productivity in year t, P st , as the ratio of juvenile to adult\nbirds in the population. The capture probabilities of adult and juvenile birds are likely to\nbe unequal due to behavioural differences, but under the assumption of constant effort,\nthese differences are expected to remain constant over time (Peach, Buckland and Baillie,\n1996). Therefore, we let k denote an unknown positive scaling factor that quantifies the\nextent to which juvenile birds are more or less catch-able than adult birds, and write\nP st = kPt = k\nJt\nAt\n. (3)\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 7\nPt (an index of productivity) is a more useful parameter biologically than Jt itself as it\nadjusts for the numbers of adult birds producing young.\nLikelihoods La and Lj under models (1) and (2) are easily formed and fitted, re-\nspectively, to the observations nagt and n\nj\ngt. Estimates of the unknown parameters are\nobtainable either by maximum likelihood (as conventionally) or from their posterior dis-\ntributions calculated via MCMC techniques, as in the present paper.\nJuvenile Sedge Warblers are dependent upon their parents only for up to a fortnight\nafter fledging (Alker and Redfern, 1996). Then, the adults depart first for pre-migratory\nfeeding grounds in July (Cramp, 1992). Assuming therefore that the Poisson distributions\nfor the adult and juvenile counts are effectively independent, it can be readily shown that\nn\nj\ngt | (n\nj\ngt + n\na\ngt) \u223c Binomial(n\nj\ngt + n\na\ngt, \u03b8gt) where \u03b8gt =\n\u03bb\nj\ngt\n(\u03bbjgt + \u03bb\na\ngt)\n,\nthe conditional distribution typically specified for juvenile counts (Julliard, Jiguet and\nCouvet, 2004; Robinson et al., 2007). Note, under the assumption logit(\u03b8gt) = \u03b2\np+spg+y\np\nt ,\nwhere \u03b2p is an intercept term and spg are y\np\nt are site and year effects respectively, it can be\nreadily shown that Pt = exp(y\np\nt ). However, although this Binomial model based on the\nconditional distribution for njgt produces analogous productivity indices to those derived\nfrom the Poisson models (1) and (2) via equation (3), in the integrated context the Poisson\nformulation is preferred since here the joint likelihood for adult and juvenile counts is\nsimply the product of their individual likelihoods.\n2.3 Integrated Models for CES Data\nClearly the adult and juvenile abundance parameters are estimated independently.\nThe integrated approach involves creating a meaningful functional relationship between\nthese parameters and, assuming independence, multiplying La and Lj to form a single\njoint likelihood.\nWe assume that all Sedge Warblers breed after their first winter, aged around one\nyear, and every year thereafter (Cramp, 1992). Furthermore, we assume that there is\nno net immigration or emigration from the UK population. Let \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t denote the\n8 V. M. Cave et al.\nprobabilities of survival for an adult and a juvenile bird from year t to t+ 1 respectively.\nWe define the deterministic population model for the index of adult abundance as:\nAt = At\u22121\u03c6a,t\u22121 + kJt\u22121\u03c6j,t\u22121\n= At\u22121\u03c6a,t\u22121 + kAt\u22121Pt\u22121\u03c6j,t\u22121. (4)\nThis expression gives the abundance index of adult birds in year t, presumed to be breed-\ning, as a function of the abundance index, productivity index and survival probabilities\nof juvenile and adult birds in the previous year (see Freeman and Crick, 2003).\nRecursively:\nAt = g(A1, k,P1...t\u22121,\u03c6a,1...t\u22121,\u03c6j,1...t\u22121). (5)\nSubstituting (5) into La we write a joint likelihood for the adult and juvenile counts as:\nLjoint = La \u00d7 Lj\n= f(na|A1, k,P1...T\u22121,\u03c6a,1...T\u22121,\u03c6j,1...T\u22121, \u03b2\na, sa\n1...G)f(n\nj|J1...T , \u03b2\nj, s\nj\n1...G), (6)\nwhere T and G denote the number of study years and sites respectively.\nThere is no direct information in either the juvenile or adult CES count data to\nestimate the constant k, instead it is estimated indirectly via (6) and its role in the\ndeterministic population model (4).\nFully time-varying demographic parameters clearly cannot be estimated from (6)\nalone. Thus we consider additional data, which provide direct information on survival\nrates, augmenting the joint likelihood (6) by multiplication with further likelihoods for\ndata on recoveries after death of largely different birds from the BTO\u2019s National Ring-\nRecovery (NRR) database (Ldead), or live-recaptures of birds during the CES itself (Llive).\n2.4 Ring-Recovery Data\nThe likelihood for ring-recovery data in two age classes is well documented (Freeman\nand Morgan, 1992; Vounatsou and Smith, 1995). However, as is frequently the case in\nEuropean bird studies, the number of Sedge Warblers ringed in the BTO\u2019s NRR database\n(Coiffait et al., 2008) is not available so we adopt a parameter-reduced form, conditional\nupon the numbers of dead birds recovered (North and Morgan, 1979; Burnham, 1990).\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 9\nAnnual totals of recoveries in year t from each ringed cohort i, separately for birds ringed\nas adults and juveniles, denoted by Dait and D\nj\nit respectively, form a collection of indepen-\ndent Multinomial distributions. Recovery probabilities of passerines are widely believed\nto have declined over time (Baillie and Green, 1987). However Sedge Warblers are short-\nlived birds hence, for example, those ringed in the early years will have died long before\nlower rates applicable to recent cohorts become prevalent. Thus we adopt the common\npractice of ignoring temporal variation and assume that the probability a dead bird is\nrecovered remains constant within each cohort. Therefore, the conditional probability of\nrecovery in year t from cohort i is given by the probability of a bird dying in year t\ndivided by the complement of the probability of its still being alive at the end of the\nrecovery period (North and Morgan, 1979). The likelihood for the ring-recovery data,\nwhich is simply a product of Multinomials for both juvenile and adult recoveries, is given\nby\nLdead = f(D\nj|\u03c6j,1...T ,\u03c6a,2...T )\u00d7 f(D\na|\u03c6a,1...T ). (7)\nWe consider dead recoveries of birds ringed in Britain during the summer months\n(May-August), only a small number of which were ringed on CES sites. Those few re-\ncoveries of birds ringed in the nest are excluded. The BTO\u2019s NRR database contains\nrecoveries of 294 Sedge Warblers ringed as fledged birds from 1987 to 2005, of which 257\nwere ringed as juveniles.\n2.5 Capture-Recapture Data\nThe capture-recapture data consist of live resighting histories for individual birds\nover the study period and fall into the category of mark-recapture models (Lebreton,\nBurnham, Clobert and Anderson, 1992; Williams, Nichols and Conroy, 2002). An asset of\nthe Constant Effort design is that probabilities of recapture (at a site) can be considered\nconstant over time, simplifying the model structure (Peach, 1993; DeSante et al., 1999).\nHowever the temporary presence of transient birds (migrants not resident near the site)\nneeds to be accounted for by explicit probabilities within the analysis, and we now describe\na modified approach in detail. Note, on account of the high dispersal of juveniles we\nrestrict the analysis to the capture histories of adults.\n10 V. M. Cave et al.\nFollowing Pradel et al. (1997) we assume that at the time of ringing a bird has a\nprobability \u03c4 of being a transient. That is, it does not breed at the site and is merely\ncaught in transit so that its effective chances of being available for subsequent recapture\nare assumed to be zero. Pradel et al. (1997) assumed that all birds caught in more than\none year were, by virtue of the fact, resident birds (for the duration of the breeding\nseason), but those caught in only a single year were a mixture in unknown proportion\nof resident birds that evaded future recapture, and transients. The CES design, however,\nmeans that we also know how many times within a year any individual was encountered.\nGiven that successive visits are at least 3 days apart, usually more, this enables us to\nextend Pradel\u2019s et al. model by considering those caught in a single year, but repeatedly,\nalso as residents.\nConceptually we can break the capture histories into 2 segments:\n1) From ringing to first recapture which may occur within the year of ringing or in a\nsubsequent year. If never seen again, from ringing to the end of the study.\n2) From first recapture onwards, at which point the resident status is confirmed.\nTo model the data in the first segment, for a single site, we define:\n\u03c8a,t - Pr(resident bird alive and present at the site in year t, survives and is present in\nyear t+1),\nc - Pr(surviving resident bird is recaptured in any given year),\n\u03b5 - Pr(resident bird, caught and ringed, is caught only once within its inaugural year),\nfit - Pr(bird ringed in year i is first recaptured in year t),\nxi - Pr(bird ringed in year i is never seen again).\nPermanent emigration away from the site of initial ringing to another breeding site\nwithin the UK is accommodated by apparent survival, \u03c8a,t. Note that as a consequence\nof design c and \u03b5 are assumed to be time invariant. Further, the assumption that a bird\nis caught independently at successive within-year visits is questionable, thus \u03b5 and c are\nestimated freely of one another.\nDenoting the number of years of the study by T , for i \u2208 [1, T ], we derive\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 11\nfit = (1\u2212 \u03c4)(1\u2212 \u03b5) i = t \u2264 T,\nfit = (1\u2212 \u03c4)\u03b5 c \u03c8a,t\u22121\nt\u22122\u220f\nk=i\n(1\u2212 c)\u03c8a,k i < t \u2264 T,\nand xi = 1\u2212\nT\u2211\nt=i\nfit i \u2264 T. (8)\nLetting Fit denote the number of birds ringed in year i first recaptured in year t, t \u2265 i,\nand Xi the number that were never seen again, the histories up until the first recapture\ncan be summarized in a matrix where the rows have independent multinomial distribu-\ntions with the cell probabilities above. We denote the Multinomial based likelihood by\nf(F,X|\u03c4, \u03b5, c,\u03c8a,1...T\u22121).\nClearly all birds contributing to the second segment are residents and thus a familiar\nCormack-Jolly-Seber type model, with temporal survival, is appropriate. The probability\nthat a resident bird recaptured and released in year i is next recaptured in year t, t > i,\nis:\npit = c\u03c8a,t\u22121\nt\u22122\u220f\nk=i\n(1\u2212 c)\u03c8a,k. (9)\nWe let Rit denote the number of resident birds recaptured and released in year i that are\nnext recaptured in year t, and Zi the number released in year i that are never seen again.\nThe Multinomial based likelihood is denoted by f(R,Z|c,\u03c8a,1...T\u22121).\nThe model is completed by recognising that we have further information on the pa-\nrameter \u03b5 arising from multiple within-year encounters from the data in segment 2. Under\nthe assumption of \u201cconstant effort\u201d the probability a resident is only caught once within\nits ringing year, \u03b5, equals the probability a resident is caught exactly once (given that it\nis caught at all) in any other year. Thus for t \u2208 [2, T ] we define:\nMt - the number of ringed resident birds that are recaptured in year t exactly once; and\nM \u2032t - the number of ringed resident birds recaptured repeatedly in year t.\nTherefore Mt \u223c Bin(Mt + M\n\u2032\nt , \u03b5), and the Binomial based likelihood, f(M|\u03b5,M + M\n\u2032)\nresults. Note that Mt + M\n\u2032\nt =\n\u2211\ni Rit.\nThe full likelihood for the capture histories of all birds (at a site) is then given by a\ncombination of the above component likelihoods. A total likelihood for multiple sites fol-\nlows by assigning each site g its own recapture probability, cg, and \u201cevasion\u201d probability,\n12 V. M. Cave et al.\n\u03b5g, and multiplying the likelihoods for the independent sites. The same apparent survival\nrates \u03c8a,t are adopted across all sites, as these sites are assumed to sample with varying\neffort the same wider population of birds. If each site were only visited once per year,\nthat is \u03b5=1, our extended model is equivalent to the original Pradel et al. (1997) model.\nTrue survival, \u03c6a,t, cannot be estimated from the CES live-recapture data alone but\nby setting\n\u03c8a,t = \u03b3\u03c6a,t, (10)\nwhere 1\u2212 \u03b3 is the probability of permanent emigration, information from CES data can\nbe used to estimate \u03c6a,t in the integrated model. Here information pertaining to \u03b3 arises\nfrom Ldead and through the population model (4). The full likelihood, for all G sites, is\ngiven by:\nLlive =f(F,X|\u03c4, \u03b51...G, c1...G, \u03b3,\u03c6a,1...T\u22121)\u00d7 f(R,Z|c1...G, \u03b3,\u03c6a,1...T\u22121)\n\u00d7 f(M|\u03b51...G,M+M\n\u2032).\n(11)\n2.6 Bayesian Model Fitting\nUsing Bayesian methodology the integrated model is readily fitted (King, Gimenez,\nMorgan and Brooks, 2009). The combination of the underlying abundance and survival\nmodels in the fully integrated model is summarised by the Directed Acyclic Graph given\nin Figure 1.\n[Figure 1 about here.]\nVague, independent, priors are specified for all parameters. In particular, for the real-\nvalued parameters in the abundance models, and the log-transformed constant k, we\nspecify a Normal prior with mean 0 and variance 10,000. For the survival, transience,\nrecapture, evasion and emigration probabilities we assume a Uniform[0,1] prior. We use\nrandom walk Metropolis-Hastings updates, with a Normal proposal for real-valued pa-\nrameters, and a Uniform proposal, appropriately truncated, for the unknown probabil-\nities. Proposal variances and step lengths are tuned a priori. The simulations are run\nfor 200,000 iterations with the first 100,000 iterations discarded as burn-in. Essentially\nidentical posterior estimates are obtained from independent replications with different\noverdispersed starting points, so that we assume the chain has converged.\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 13\n3. RESULTS\nThe analyses below demonstrate that integration of the individual demographic mod-\nels, La, Lj , Llive and Ldead, can lead to a substantial improvement in precision. This\nis particularly true for juvenile survival in which there is very sparse direct informa-\ntion available. Furthermore, for parameters for which direct information is limited, the\nunderlying demographic model (4) will drive their estimation.\n3.1 \u201cBaseline\u201d Models\nWe begin by separately estimating trends in adult abundance, At, and juvenile abun-\ndance, Jt, via models (1) and (2) respectively. These are not restricted by any demographic\nassumptions, thus they serve as a \u201cbaseline\u201d for similar estimates derived under popula-\ntion models such as (4). Baseline estimates for the productivity indices, Pt, are derived by\ncalculating the ratio of Jt to At using samples drawn from their posterior distributions.\nAs estimates of true survival, \u03c6j,t and \u03c6a,t, are not obtainable using CES data alone, base-\nline values are obtained from the ring-recovery data. In addition, a baseline for apparent\nadult survival, \u03c8a,t, is estimated from the CES live-recapture histories via the extended\nPradel et al. (1997) model augmented with the Binomial terms as in Section 2.5.\n3.2 Integrated Model with Ring-Recovery Data\nA wide range of analyses are possible in the integrated context. Initially we form\na model by multiplying the likelihoods La and Lj for the adult and juvenile counts\nfrom the CES data with the information from the ring-recoveries via Ldead. These two\ndata sets are fully independent. Posterior means of Jt, \u03c6a,t, \u03c6j,t and the derived At and\nPt parameters are shown in Figure 2. Comparisons with the baseline estimates reveal\nthat although the derived adult abundance indices from the integrated model are very\nsimilar to their baseline (Figure 2a), the adult survival estimates (Figure 2d) and the\njuvenile survival estimates (Figure 2e) are quite different. Therefore the adult abundance\ndata, through the recursive equation (4), seems to be driving the estimation of adult\nand juvenile survival, which is expected as the ring-recovery data are relatively limited.\n14 V. M. Cave et al.\nConversely, as the derived adult abundance indices and its baseline are almost exactly\nthe same, this suggests that Ldead has practically no influence on the recursive equation.\n[Figure 2 about here.]\nFigure 2 illustrates the changes in the estimates of adult and\/or juvenile survival in\nthe integrated model, not reflected in their baseline models, to produce derived adult\nabundance indices that correspond to the adult count data. Note that productivity, and\nconsequently juvenile abundance, is much reduced after 1995, and that since then only\nthree years have been followed by an increase in adult abundance - 1998, 1999 and 2003\n(Figure 2a). These years (along with the imprecise terminal years) are also those in\nwhich adult and juvenile survival is greatly increased under the integrated model. Here,\nestimates of Jt and Pt arise from considerably more data than those of \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t,\nthus the former are more resistant to change once the component models are integrated.\nPt and\/or Jt in these three years is not sufficient so the integrated model increases the\nestimates of \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t to account for the greater number of adult birds caught.\nIntegration noticeably improves the precision in the estimates of adult and juvenile\nsurvival (Figure 2d, e). In the baseline \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t are freely estimated from ring-recovery\ndata unrestricted by any assumptions relating them to adult abundance. In the integrated\ncase, however, the limited information on \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t from the ring-recovery data is\naugmented by the population model (4) which relates the number of adults in consecutive\nyears to productivity and survival. This extra information improves the precision in the\nestimates of \u03c6a,t and \u03c6j,t.\n3.3 Including Capture-Recapture Data\nThe much greater amount of adult survival information in the live-recapture likelihood\nLlive makes it appealing to further multiply this into the joint likelihood. However, as\nLlive is drawn from the same data as La the likelihoods are not independent. Therefore\nwe initially split the data into two groups (one of 35 sites and the other of 36 sites); one\nis then used to derive Llive and the other independent set to form La. To ensure both\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 15\nsplit data sets provide good coverage over the duration of the study, sites are stratified\naccording to when they joined the CES scheme, and within each of these strata half the\nsites are randomly assigned to each group. Secondly, we ignore the issue of dependence\nand derive La and Llive from the full 71-site data. In both cases Ldead is also incorporated\nto provide more direct information on \u03c6j,t so that:\nLjoint = La \u00d7 Lj \u00d7 Ldead \u00d7 Llive.\nLj , which is independent of La and Llive, is derived from the full 71-site data in each case.\nThe posterior means of key parameters, At, Jt, Pt, \u03c8a,t and \u03c6j,t from the full and\nsplit data analyses are compared to each other, and their baseline estimates, in Figure\n3. There are considerably more data on adult survival from the live-recaptures than the\nlimited ring-recoveries, but as the live-recapture data alone cannot provide a baseline for\n\u03c6a,t, we present estimates of \u03c8a,t.\n[Figure 3 about here.]\nConcentrating initially on the full 71-site integrated analysis we note that At, Jt, Pt\nand \u03c8a,t are all very similar to their baseline estimates. Conversely there have been some\nbig adjustments to \u03c6j,t. This is to be expected, since baseline data on \u03c6j,t is limited\nthe integrated model alters \u03c6j,t to make the derived At correspond to the adult count\ndata. For example, in Figure 2a the integrated model has explained the increase in adult\nabundance from 1998, 1999 and 2003 by increasing both adult and juvenile survival\n(Figures 2d, e), for which little is otherwise known. This does not happen in Figure 3d\nbecause the baseline likelihood Llive is now also a part of the integrated model, bringing\nin substantially more information about adult survival. There is still a paucity of direct\ninformation on juvenile survival hence now the integrated model responds to account for\nthe increase in adult abundance by just increasing \u03c6j,t in these three years (Figure 3e).\nThe integrated approach also tends to result in an improved precision. This is most\nnoticeable for juvenile survival (Figure 3e). Here the very limited direct information on\n\u03c6j,t from the ring-recovery data is augmented in the integrated model by the information\nfrom the deterministic population model, (4).\n16 V. M. Cave et al.\nThe full and split data analyses produce consistent results (Figure 3). Using the\nCES data as two independent groups of 36 sites and 35 sites, we find At, Pt and \u03c8a,t,\nresemble their baseline, though slightly less so than previously (Figure 3a, c, d). This\nis to be expected as fewer data are now used to form Llive and La. For \u03c6j,t (Figure 3e)\nboth integrated models produce trends more similar to each other than to the imprecise\nbaseline estimates. As the full data are used to derive Lj in both the integrated models\nJt is virtually unchanged (Figure 3b).\nFor the integrated models, the 95% symmetric credible intervals for At, Pt, \u03c8a,t, and\n\u03c6j,t from the split data analysis are wider, but not dramatically so, than those from the\nfull data analysis (Figure 3a, c, d, e). This is to be expected as these parameters are being\nestimated from less information when the data are split. However, even under a split data\nanalysis including the CES live-recapture data substantially improves the precision in the\nestimates of both adult and juvenile survival (Figure 2d, e and 3d, e).\nTo investigate the sensitivity to the split the analysis is repeated with the data sets\nused to form Llive, or La, swapped over. The trends in the indices between the two split\nanalyses are similar as indicated by the high correlation in their posterior means (At:\n\u03c1=0.86, Jt: \u03c1=1.00, Pt: \u03c1=0.67). Likewise, the estimates of \u03c8a,t, and \u03c6j,t, are similar\nbetween the two split analyses (see Appendix A).\nThe proportion of transients \u03c4 also requires estimation under the integrated model.\nThe posterior mean (standard deviation) of \u03c4 from the full data analysis is 0.37 (0.0138),\nand from the two split data analyses is 0.36 (0.0207) and 0.38 (0.0176) respectively. The\nestimate is more precise under the full data analysis due to the greater amount of data.\nThe integrated model produces estimates of \u201ctrue seasonal\u201d productivity, the number\nof young per breeding pair, through the combination of k and Pt, which are consistent\nwith published analyses of nest record data. Assuming an equal proportion of female and\nmale birds, the integrated model estimates, on average, 2.7 young per pair per year. For\nSedge Warblers nest failure probabilities, the proportion of nests failing completely due\nto predation or desertion for example, are approximately 0.015 per day at the egg stage\nand 0.018 per day at the chick stage (Baillie et al., 2009). As the duration of incubation\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 17\nand fledging are typically 17-19 and 13 -14 days respectively (Cramp, 1992), this gives a\nproportion of successful nests of about 0.60. With an average clutch size of 5 eggs, and\ntypically 1 brood per year (Cramp, 1992), this corresponds to 3.0 young per pair. Though\nthis figure ignores the (unknown) number of second broods, the losses of individual chicks\nup to (and shortly after) fledging in otherwise successful nests and the uncertainty in the\nestimates, the correspondence with the integrated model is reassuring.\n3.4 Adult Site-Fidelity\nThe posterior mean (95% symmetric credible interval) of \u03b3, the probability of not\npermanently emigrating, from the analysis of the full 71-site data is 0.82 (0.696, 0.956),\nand the two split data analyses is 0.89 (0.755, 0.982) and 0.80 (0.675, 0.951) respectively,\nindicating a high, but importantly not a total, degree of site-fidelity.\nA Reversible-jump MCMC algorithm (Green, 1995), used to assess the importance of\nallowing for permanent emigration, provided some posterior support for the hypothesis\nthat \u03b3 \u0006= 1, with a Bayes factor equal to 2.3 (Kass and Raftery, 1995) (see Appendix B).\n4. DISCUSSION\nPrevious research has used population modelling to combine data from several long-\nrunning bird monitoring schemes. The earlier approaches, including Peach, Siriwardena\nand Gregory (1999) and Siriwardena, Freeman and Crick (2001), fitted population models\nto indices of abundance derived beforehand from census data. The demographic parame-\nters in their deterministic population models were fixed at their estimated values derived\nfrom nest record and ring-recovery data.\nBesbeas et al. (2002) furthered the deterministic approaches above, although their\nmethod still modelled an index derived from census data rather than the raw data. They\nused a state-space model for this index in combination with the usual Multinomial-based\nmodels for the ring-recovery data, forming a combined likelihood that integrates both\ncensus and ringing information. Brooks et al. (2004) and King et al. (2008) demonstrated\nhow the model could be re-cast in a Bayesian framework.\n18 V. M. Cave et al.\nFreeman et al. (2007) fitted demographic population models directly to the raw counts\nbut again fixing the demographic parameters to previously estimated values. Besbeas and\nFreeman (2006) essentially combine the methods of Besbeas et al. (2002) and Freeman\net al. (2007) thereby correctly accounting for both the correlation and sampling variance\nin both the demographic parameters and the derived abundance indices.\nWe provide a new approach to Integrated Population Modelling which combines, for\nthe first time, the Bayesian approach of Brooks et al. (2004) and King et al. (2008),\nand the fitting to site-specific data arrays of Besbeas and Freeman (2006). The various\nanalyses outlined above use partial census data, i.e. territory counts at a sample of sites,\nto gain information about abundance, whereas our analysis employs ringing data for\nthis purpose. An advantage of using the CES data is that for certain species, like Sedge\nWarbler and Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), which occur in specialised habitats,\nthey provide possibly the best information available with regards to abundance. For the\nmajority of passerines CES live-recaptures also provide better survival estimation than\nthat obtained from ring-recoveries, at least for adult birds. In addition it is perhaps the\nonly practical means of indexing true seasonal productivity (fledged young per breeding\npair per year), rather than fledged young per breeding attempt as nest record data do.\nThis paper also introduces a new method for dealing with transients that can be\nused within, or outside, the integrated context, using the extra information contained\nwithin the 12 annual visits. Should only a single visit be made annually, the integrated\napproach remains viable, and Llive is formed exactly as described by Pradel et al. (1997).\nMoreover, the extended Pradel et al. (1997) model is not limited to CES data alone but\ncan be applied to other \u201cRobust design\u201d (Pollock, 1982) style data, for example Hines,\nKendall and Nichols (2003). By allowing temporal variation in c and \u03b5 it generalises to\nany two stage capture-recapture study where transients are believed to be present, and\ninference on the primary sampling period is of interest, providing an efficient model.\nTemporal, or site, variation in \u03c4 is also possible but not considered here for simplicity.\nThe integrated approach provides a ready means of assessing the degree of site-fidelity\nto the breeding grounds of adult birds, or strictly speaking to the area surveyed by the\nAn Integrated Population Model from Constant Effort Data. 19\nmist-net. By utilizing both the ring-recovery data and the deterministic population model,\nthe integrated analysis enables true adult survival, \u03c6a, to be separated from emigration,\n\u03b3, in the CES live-recapture data.\nIn general, CES data alone will not enable accurate estimation of juvenile survival,\nas these birds, unlike adults, are not sufficiently site faithful. By integrating the ring-\nrecovery data, albeit limited, in the integrated models for Sedge Warbler we produce\nthe first precise estimates of juvenile survival for this species with any practical value.\nFurthermore, being able to estimate the productivity scaling factor, k, means that for\nthe first time we can estimate productivity in terms of young per adult, rather than an\nindex merely proportional to it. Typically Sedge Warblers lay one clutch per year, but\noccasionally two (Alker and Redfern, 1996). The integrated model enables estimation\nof the true seasonal productivity which includes these multiple attempts, as will be the\nnorm for many other species.\nThe issue of independence between Llive with La can be overcome by randomly split-\nting the CES data, prior to analysis, into two sets at the cost of a small increase of\nvariance. Such an approach will not introduce bias, however the resulting split may be\nsub-optimal in terms of precision. Currently no effort has been made to find the opti-\nmal split, and further research is needed to develop a more rigorous approach in this\nrespect. Using the full data to derive Llive and La seems to result in unbiased estimates\nof the demographic parameters, however variability estimates are likely to be slightly\nunder-reported as a result of, essentially, using the same data twice.\nA key advantage to the integrated approach is that it produces estimates of abun-\ndance, productivity and survival consistent with both the CES and NRR data sets, and\naccording to the relationship imposed by the population model (4), with one another.\nFurthermore the estimates are robust across both sources of data. Previous integrated\nmodels combine demographic information from entirely separate sources of data, requiring\nthe need to ensure that these relate to the same population. By using CES data to pro-\nvide direct information on abundance, productivity and adult survival, augmented with\nadditional information on juvenile and adult survival from the NRR database, enables\n20 V. M. Cave et al.\nmore consistency in the sources of information employed.\nThe integrated approach presented here has a much wider applicability than that of\nSedge Warbler CES data alone. Not only does the CES scheme provide sufficient data\nto monitor other species, but there are many other Constant Effort ringing programmes\ndirectly modelled on the BTO\u2019s CES scheme in Europe, and the MAPS scheme in the\nUSA, that generate similar data.\nThe current analysis provides wide scope for future work. Of particular interest is the\ninclusion of environmental covariates and the investigation of their relationship with the\nunderlying demographic rates, for example that found by Peach et al. (1991) between\nSedge Warbler adult survival and Sahel rainfall. Similarly, productivity or juvenile sur-\nvival may be related to the weather conditions during the British summer. To date we\nhave restricted our analysis to the subset of complete capture records. The ability to\nimprove precision by including additional data for years with missed visits is very ap-\npealing, however for these years the assumption of constant effort is violated and requires\nspecial treatment. Extension to include data with incomplete coverage using the methods\nof Cave et al. (2008) and Cave et al. (2009) in an integrated context is an area of ongoing\nresearch. Further, overdispersion of count data relative to the Poisson distribution is a\ncommon problem. Failure to address this leads to an over-reporting of the precision in the\nparameter estimates. The abundance models for adult and juvenile counts can be readily\nadapted to incorporate overdispersion, either following the approach of Link and Sauer\n(2002) or by specifying a Negative Binomial distribution in place of the Poisson.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the CES ringers for the effort they spent collecting\nthe data.

The estimates for the indices of adult abundance,\njuvenile abundance and productivity (Figure 4a, b, c) are similar between both analyses,\nas are the estimates of adult and juvenile survival (Figure 4d, e). The main discrepancy\noccurs in 2002; under the first split analysis an increase in \u03c6j,t and a decrease in \u03c8a,t\nare estimated, whereas the converse is the case when the data sets are swapped over\n(Figure 4d, e). However, the majority of the differences are minor, and the analysis seems\nrelatively insensitive to the split.\nInterestingly the 95% symmetric credible intervals of At and Pt from the first split\nanalysis are narrower than those when the data sets are swapped over (Figure 4a, c).\nThis is because the indices are relative to a reference year (1987) and site. The two\nsplit analyses were required to have a different reference site, and this change affects the\nposterior variation of \u03b2a and consequently the precision of At and Pt. Note that posterior\nvariance of \u03b2a was lower in the first split analysis (0.0100) than in the second (0.0839)\nresulting in the observed improvement in precision.\n[Figure 4 about here.]\nAPPENDIX B\nThe importance of allowing for permanent emigration away from the CES sites in Llive\nis assessed using a Reversible-jump MCMC algorithm (Green, 1995) that distinguishes\n22 V. M. Cave et al.\nbetween the integrated models with and without permanent emigration. Both models are\ngiven an equal prior weighting. In the model updating step the probability of proposing\na move between models is set to 1, and normal proposal for \u03b3, appropriately truncated\nand tuned a priori, is used. The algorithm is run for 500,000 iterations with the first\n300,000 discarded as burn-in, and uses the full 71-site data to derive both Llive and La.\nEssentially identical results were obtained from multiple runs with overdispersed starting\npoints, so that we assume the chain has converged. With a Bayes factor equal to 2.3, our\nresults provide weak posterior support that, due to a lack of site-fidelity in adult Sedge\nWarblers, \u03b3 \u0006= 1 (Kass and Raftery, 1995).\nREFERENCES\nAlker, P.J. and Redfern, C.P.F.
