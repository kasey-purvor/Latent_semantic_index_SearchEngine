Our attempt to develop a program for applying audit and certification \nprocesses and tools took as its starting point the RLG-NARA Audit Checklist for Certifying \nDigital Repositories [8]. Our intention was to appraise critically the checklist and conceive a \nmeans of applying its mechanics within a diverse range of repository environments. We were \nstruck by the realization that while a great deal of effort has been invested in determining the \ncharacteristics of a 'trusted digital repository', far less effort has concentrated on the ways in \nwhich the presence of the attributes can be demonstrated and their qualities measured. With \nthis in mind we sought to explore the role of evidence within the certification process, and to \nidentify examples of the types of evidence (e.g., documentary, observational, and \ntestimonial) that might be desirable during the course of a repository audit1.\nIntroduction\nDigital repositories have become a focal point of institutional development [1]. Numerous \nactivities from eprint services to institutional repositories to developments at national \nlibraries and archives reflect the recognized need to develop, deploy, and maintain digital \nrepositories that are worthy of trust. At the same time within our community our outlook\nappears to be shifting from optimistic trust behaviour to pessimistic trust behaviour. That is, a \nhealthy level of pessimism has emerged that has led many to recognise that digital \nrepositories are only worthy of trust if they can demonstrate that they have the properties of \ntrustworthiness. The desire to construct a robust audit, certification, and accreditation \nprogramme for digital repositories arises because as a community we acknowledge the \nuncertainty as to whether repositories can secure the authenticity, integrity, and accessibility \nof digital materials over the long term. As a result we aim to put in place mechanisms to\nreduce uncertainty and the anxiety associated with it; establishing evidence of trust is an \napproach to handling uncertainty. Programmes such as audit and certification allow us to \nrestrain uncertainty and to transform it to risks that can be measured and managed. TheThe Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n2 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nreasons why independently measuring and validating the trustworthiness of repositories is \nessential have been the focus of earlier discussions [5, 9, 10]. For the purposes of this study \nwe have taken as axiomatic that certification is one marker that helps users to establish the \nlevel of trust that they might reasonably have in a particular digital repository. Audit is a\ncritical step in establishing whether certification of a particular repository should be granted.\nHere we aim to open the debate on the types of evidence needed if digital repositories are to \nbe effectively and transparently audited.\nFunded jointly by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)2 and the core e-Science \nProgramme, the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) aims to support and promote continuing \nimprovement in the quality of data curation and digital preservation, within the United \nKingdom. The four partners, the University of Edinburgh,3 HATII4 at the University of \nGlasgow,5 UKOLN6 at the University of Bath7 and the Council for the Central Laboratory \nof the Research Councils (CCLRC)8 have collaborated to build the DCC on the international \nexpertise and renown of the partners in research, development, service, and training delivery \n[11]. The DCC has four fundamental priorities: to establish a vibrant research programme, to \nbuild and foster strong community relationships, to explore innovative development activities \nthat lead to tangible heavily used services, and to achieve a virtuous circle whereby every \naspect of our own outputs and community input feeds into and informs our existing activities \nand shapes emerging ones.\nSince it is anticipated that the successful development of accreditation, audit, and \ncertification will depend on international consensus, the DCC has developed relationships \nwith the leading audit and certification efforts in this area [10]. Much of the effort to date \nappears to have concentrated on defining the characteristics of a 'trusted digital repository'; \nconsiderably less effort has been committed to establishing a context in which these \ncharacteristics can be shown to be present and, if they are present, how their qualities can be \nmeasured and evaluated. Although here we focus on approaches to audit and certification \nwithin the archives and library community and how they might be enhanced, we have \nrecognised elsewhere [10] that this work must not be conducted in isolation and that there is \nmuch to be gained from building on the work of other audit and certification organisations \nand their methods and approaches (e.g., ISACA,9 Information Systems Audit and Control \nAssociation). As we argued earlier, 'digital curation and preservation is a risk management \nactivity at all stages of the longevity pathway' [10]. Many other communities have developed\nstrategies for identifying, monitoring, and managing classes of risk that are directly relevant \nto our work.10\n2. Defining Activities\nThe generally accepted starting point for much of this work is the 2002 Research Libraries \nGroup (RLG)11 and Online Computer Library Centre (OCLC)12 Working Group paper, \nTrusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities [9]. Subsequently, the RLG and \nUS National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)13 Digital Repository \nCertification Task Force published in late 2005 a draft Audit Checklist for Certifying Digital \nRepositories [8], comprising just under ninety criteria for determining whether a digital \nrepository should be trusted. These criteria are organised into four categories: organisation; \nfunctions, processes and procedures; the designated community and information usability; \nand, technologies and technical infrastructure. The principles, terminology, and functional \ncharacteristics outlined in the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System \n(OAIS) [7], published by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and \nsubsequently galvanised as international standard ISO14721, form the bedrock on which the \nchecklist, at least in its draft form, is built. Together, these three documents have provided a \nfoundation for activities that are being undertaken within the Center for Research Libraries' The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n3 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\n(CRL)14 Certification of Digital Archives15 project with support from the Andrew W. \nMellon Foundation. This project is currently conducting pilot audits of digital archives \nincluding the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB),16 the Inter-University Consortium for Political \nand Social Research (ICPSR),17 and Portico.18 In addition, the CRL team will audit the \ndistributed archiving system LOCKSS19 (\"Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe\"). The overall aim \nof the CRL work is to evaluate in as formal a way as possible the audit and certification \nchecklist proposed by the RLG-NARA Certification Task Force, and to offer some insight \ninto the applicability of their proposed metrics. The DCC collaborated with the CRL on the \nKB audit in April 2006 as a way to ensure comparability of practice during the pilot between \nDCC and CRL approaches.\nA comparable German initiative, the Network of Expertise in Long-term Storage of Digital \nResources (nestor), aims to raise awareness for digital preservation issues, promote best \npractices, and foster the development of an associated community of expertise.20 A nestor\nworking group is exploring the development of a procedure for certification as well as a \ncriteria catalogue for characterising \"trustworthy archives\".21 Nestor has conceived its own \nchecklist for repository audit; this work covers the technical, organisational, and financial \ncharacteristics of a digital repository. Stefan Strathmann, G\u00f6ttingen State and University\nLibrary (Germany) provided us with access to an early draft of the nestor checklist [6]. One \nstrength of the nestor work is that the criteria are well founded on broad thinking in digital \npreservation, and the criteria catalogue itself has been built on the rich literature base related \nto digital preservation. Recent discussions with Suzanne Dobratz indicate that nestor is \nworking to develop mechanisms to assess a repository's fulfilment of the criteria.22\nAnother German example, the Deutsche Initiative f\u00fcr Netzwerkinformation (DINI)23 has \nestablished a certification approach covering institutional document and publication \nrepositories focused on examining quality of service, visibility, interoperability, and reliance \non standards [3, 4]. The DINI certification process starts with a repository completing an \naudit template. Following submission of the completed questionnaire an information \nspecialist and a technical expert evaluate the responses and assess whether certification \nshould be granted; this process often involves communication with the repository seeking \ncertification to ask it for additional information. The DINI certificate, launched in 2003 by \nthe Electronic Publishing working group established a minimum set of requirements for \nrepositories and the institutions that administered them, covering such issues as server \npolicies, legal matters, and long-term availability and sustainability. Although, so far, \nrestricted to a single class repository, DINI in 2006 runs the only functional digital repository \ncertification scheme.24\n3. Planning Pilot Audits\nTo further clarify how repository audit and certification should be conducted, the DCC is \nengaged in a series of pilot audits that will complement ongoing work in Germany and the \nUSA. DCC audits will take place during July and August of 2006 at three UK organizations, \nand the outcome of these audits will be published later in 2006. In preparation for these \naudits we recognise the need to establish an understanding of what represents an evidence \nbase for repository audit, define a list of classes of individuals who should participate in the \nprocess of gathering and presenting the evidence, assist other initiatives in defining the \nmetrics and strategies that should be used to evaluate documentary, system and testimonial \nevidence, and contribute to the refining of the thinking on audit criteria and processes.\nThe evaluation process begins prior to the site visit, with initial research into the institutional \ninfrastructure of the repository, the nature of its collections, and the demographics of its \ndepositors and consumers. As a second stage in audit planning, a pre-visit questionnaire will The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n4 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nbe sent to and returned by the target repository to provide auditors with a profile of the \ninstitution's technical architecture, organisational structure, and financial position. It will give \nauditors information concerning such areas as security, performance, and management \ncontrol. Supporting documentation will be requested and reviewed in advance of the on-site \naudit. These materials will, for instance, give auditors material to support decisions about \nwhere and how to probe during a visit, and in some cases evidence to ascertain where \nprocesses, procedures, and practices are adequate. It will enable the audit team to establish an\n'Audit Plan'. This will facilitate the identification of areas where observation of practice,\ninterviews, checking of documentation and testing (e.g., disaster recovery tests, evaluation of \nstratified random samples of digital objects at different points in their lifecycle) should be \nused. The scope and nature of these data collection instruments and the types of\ndocumentation requested will be refined as the DCC and others working in this area, such as \nRLG\/NARA and nestor, develop a richer understanding of the information requirements \nnecessary to assess repositories as an outcome of pilot audits.\nEach of the three DCC pilot audits will produce three types of output, each meeting a \nparticular need:\nFirst will be a 'confidential report' for the participating repository itself, detailing the \nresults of the evaluation, offering suggestions for future developments that might \nimprove their effectiveness, processes, and documentation procedures, giving guidance \nas to how the repository could use the audit tools to manage regular internal audits, and \nindicating how the repository could better prepare for future externally run audits.\nSecond, in consultation with the audited repository the DCC audit team will make\npublicly available a report appraising the audit approaches it employed and indicating \nthe kinds of improvements that should be made to the process. \nRevised criteria and descriptions of the audit process will be delivered to RLG\/NARA \nand nestor as the third anticipated outcome of each pilot audit. \n4. What Is the Evidence Base?\nSignificant intellectual effort has been committed to the identification of the necessary \ntechnological, organisational, and financial characteristics repositories must have if they are \nto be granted a kite-mark of trustworthiness. This is perhaps realised most notably within the \nnestor and RLG-NARA audit checklists [6, 8]. The issue of the categories of evidence \nnecessary to facilitate audits and enable certification needs to be given adequate \nconsideration: any tool that omits to describe the evidence that will contribute to the audit \nprocess is incomplete. If an audit checklist has aspirations of practical applicability, its \ncriteria must detail not only the expected and required standards, but also the means by \nwhich their attainment can be demonstrated and assessed. Similarly, if such tools are to \npromote self-assessment of a rigorous and reliable kind, and to be likely to provide a good \npredictor for the outcome of an independent external audit, then they must be comprehensive, \neither independently or in combination with one or more linked resources. With no indication \nof its acceptable evidence base a checklist for structuring and guiding the audit and \ncertification of a repository has mainly theoretical value. It lacks practical applicability and \ndoes not support unbiased measurement. It becomes too open to interpretation, and a risk \narises that it will be extrapolated to endorse even those repositories with recognisable \nshortcomings. Current work does not, so far, focus adequately on the evidence base; a further \ndevelopment stage is necessary to conceive a document that is practically useful within an \naudit. Efforts must probe for evidence of concrete processes, structures, and functionality.\nIn reviewing the audit tools that are being developed [6, 8] we have identified and reported a \ngap in the documentation requirements necessary to provide an evidence base for measuring \nrepository compliance with the expectations for best practices as outlined in the checklists.The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n5 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nThe types of evidence likely to be of value to an auditor will be drawn from a range of \nsources: information services, finance, human resources, and many others. The methods for \nselecting and evaluating the evidence need to be regularized. For example, presence or \nabsence of a particular class of evidence is not necessarily a sufficient metric. Here we only \nseek to highlight the relevant questions and concerns, offer a series of common sense \nsolutions, and prompt further exploration; we do not aspire to examine the issue as \ncomprehensively as it needs to be. So we have not suggested methods for evaluating the \ndocumentary evidence. The most immediate barrier is establishing an understanding of the \nkinds of documentary and testimonial evidence that an auditor would seek to accumulate in \nconsidering a repository's case for certification. From this, a series of sub-questions follow:\nIn what circumstances can quantitative metrics be established for assessing whether \nindividual criteria have been adequately satisfied?\nHow might the qualitative merits of evidence be assessed consistently by different \nauditors?\nWhat organisations and types of skilled professionals should be responsible for \ngathering information and conducting a dialogue with repository representatives? \nWhat document procurement powers should be conferred to auditors?\nWhat assurances must be given to institutions concerned about disclosing sensitive \ninformation? (For example, will non-disclosure agreements be necessary?)\nWhat external benchmarking evidence might be available to auditors that could \ncontribute to their forming a view as to whether an institution is compliant and \ncertifiable?\nThe initial starting point though is the evidence itself; we accept the checklist format that has \nbecome de rigueur, but propose that at all times evidence requirements ought to be detailed \ninline alongside each certification criterion. Needless to say, the means of their satisfaction \nwill be determined in part by the character and services of the particular repository \nundergoing audit. We favour a simple system of classification of the evidence, with \nconformance information categorised as documentary evidence, observation of practice \nevidence, or testimonial evidence. Here we would propose that observation can be much \nmore than a passive activity, it might include such proactive steps as sampling, scenario \nsequencing, tests, and simulations.\n5. Documentary Evidence\nSome repository characteristics can be objectively assessed through the provision by the \nrepository of documentary evidence and its analysis by the auditors. Insights into technical \ninfrastructure, financial management, resource allocation, and user relationships can all be \ngained from the existence and analysis of a range of documentary evidence. Numerous types \nof documentation of value to the audit and certification process exist within repositories; for \nsome, their presence alone will be encouraging, and in other cases their content will require \nscrutiny if its role in fostering organisational compliance is to be assessed. To promote an \nimproved understanding of the kinds of documentation that might be used to support audit \nand certification we suggest that the following be considered as an initial list:\nRepository Mission Statement: This is the statement of the repository's mission and, \nif the repository is part of a larger organisation, its 'spacing' within the parent \norganisation. This provides auditors with evidence of institutional commitment to the \nlong-term retention and management of digital information on behalf of depositors.\nExample Deposit Agreements: Examination of these agreements would enable \nauditors to assess the relationship between depositor and repository, the responsibilities \nof both parties, the level of service expected, and the legal rights and obligations of the The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n6 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nparties involved. This can help auditors to assess the suitability of repository functions \nand contractual controls. \nJob Descriptions: As these detail the duties and responsibilities of each member of the \nrepository staff, they give auditors evidence of the existence of capacity to deliver the \nkinds and levels of service outlined in the mission statement and depositor agreements. \nIn addition they provide a mechanism for mapping between the organisational \nobjectives and the means to deliver them.\nOrganisational Chart: Documents detailing the roles and responsibilities of staff and \nhow they interrelate offer evidence of the existence of appropriate management \nstructures and support validation of quality control mechanisms.\nStaff Profiles\/CVs: Overviews of experience, expertise, and qualifications of staff \nshould be provided, as these will offer an indication of the capabilities and \nbackgrounds of individuals performing key tasks within the repository and assist in \ngiving auditors evidence as to whether the right staff mix is available.\nAnnual Financial Reports: Details of income and expenditure as well as project \nincome and expenditure provide evidence as to the financial footing and planning of \nthe repository. This evidence should be considered for at least the three previous years.\nFor example, the historical data will enable auditors to assess how good the repository \nis at predicting its future income and expenditure. This will be valuable in enabling\nauditors to assess repository financial risk. \nBusiness Plan: This document details the financial, organisational and methodological \nbasis for the repository, providing a justification for its existence and a plan to ensure \nits persistence. The Business Plan offers evidence of organisational approaches to \nsustainability, projected developments, and plans for exploiting emerging market \nopportunities.\nRisk Register: How repositories approach risk management will be a central concern \nto auditors. They will wish to review any risk registers and assess the repository's\napproaches to them: is the register appropriately scaled and detailed; does it indicate a \nproactive or reactive approach to risk; and is it likely to help the repository manage \nrisk? A detailed list should indicate the risk, its likelihood, what actions are being\ntaken to avoid it occurring, how the repository will respond if the risk were to occur, \nand what the impact of its happening would be. For example, how would the\nrepository approach accidental disclosure of some of its holdings?\nPolicy Documents: Documents detailing the repository's policy in key areas, such as \nacquisitions, preservation strategies, guidelines for selecting and ingesting digital \nobjects, and access and disaster recovery, provide a range of insights illustrating the \nmeans by which the repository performs particular functions, the way it provides \nspecific services, the processes by which it manages its relationships with the user, and \nhow it responds to such extrinsic factors as legislation and regulation. \nProcedure Manuals: This class of documentation gives evidence of the procedures \ncarried out by the repository in such areas as methods for validating submissions, \nbackup, data checking, storage media change, system maintenance, and destruction of \nold media.\nWorkflow Models: These indicate the level of understanding and management of the \nprocesses applied by the repository. They also give auditors an indication of pressure \npoints that can be tested as part of the audit visit.\nTechnical Architecture: Documentation of the repository's hardware and software \ninfrastructure provide evidence to enable auditors to validate suitability of hardware \nand software infrastructures to support effectively the functions and services aspired to \nin both the mission statement and agreed in the individual depositor agreements.\nMaintenance Reports: These documents describe maintenance that has been The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n7 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nundertaken within the system, including the application of security and functionality \nupgrades and the repair or replacement of corrupt or lost data objects. This enables the \nauditors to evaluate the effectiveness of the team and to make an assessment of the \nquality of service that the repository can provide.\nResults of Other Audits: The results of other audits are of value, such as Information \nSecurity, Health and Safety, and even evidence of areas in which the repository was \nacknowledged by other independent auditing regimes and particular audits to have \nbeen successfully conducting its business.\nOther Documentation Records: During the process of managing digital materials, \nrepositories will produce other documentary 'fingerprints'. These will need to be\nidentified on a repository by repository basis.\nEven the processes by which these documents are managed will provide auditors with \nvaluable insights into the running of the repository. It will be useful to know how decisions\nare taken to draft them, how their change is reviewed, how new versions are approved, and \nhow staff are made aware of changes to procedures and policies.\nAssociated with many forms of physical documentary evidence will be fears over\nconfidentiality and privacy \u2013 every organisation has documentation that it regards as\nsensitive, whether for financial or business planning reasons, or those more attributable to\nrelationships with depositors. Auditing teams need to put appropriate non-disclosure\nagreements in place to secure the confidence of repository representatives that privacy and\nconfidentiality agreements will not be breached by the audit process. The processes and\npractices of conducting audits are, moreover, governed by a range of professional practices.\nThese types of documentation must be subjected to consistent and unbiased evaluation. The \nmethods for evaluating documentation and reporting on their evaluation require further \nconsideration. Moreover the evaluation of the submitted documentation may result in\nsubsequent requests for additional written documentation, or the collection of evidence \nthrough observation of practice or by means of interviews.\n6. Observation of Practice Evidence\nWitness accounts describing existing processes within the repository represent a key means \nof determining whether certification criteria are being met. In most cases this represents the \nmost straightforward way in which repository workflow and good practice can be evidenced. \nWithin the context of an institutional audit, auditors themselves will expect to be exposed to \nthe processes of ingest, archiving, and dissemination. This might be most fruitfully achieved \nby following the passage of a single digital object throughout the full process, or through the \nselection of different evidence points related to the passage of different objects through the \nprocess while observing what happens at each of these points. As well as processes, technical \ncharacteristics of the repository can be assessed in this way. While observation may appear \nless objectively quantifiable than documentary evidence, it nonetheless represents an \nimportant part of the organisational assessment and is used in other types of audit. In such\nareas as procedures and workflow models, auditors can test how well the repository \nunderstands what it does and does what it says it does, its relationship with its users, and how \nit has planned to handle disasters. These observations might include walkthroughs or testing \nand measurement of the presence of essential characteristics of digital objects against \nanticipated or projected characteristic survival after preservation action (e.g., after \nregularisation, migration, emulation) has been carried out. Here again our community needs\nto define what practices it should adopt to document these audits; there are practices we can \nadopt from other communities.\n7. Testimonial EvidenceThe Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n8 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nInterviews with stakeholders and repository staff will allow the auditor to assess internal \nmechanisms and organisational processes. Inevitably, documentary evidence offers \nincomplete insights. In most organisations there is a degree of knowledge that is locked away \n'in the heads' of experienced repository staff. This in itself is a concern in terms of \ncertification, and every repository should have mechanisms in place to mitigate risks posed \nby this situation. Interviews are an effective means of highlighting the omissions that exist \nwithin formal documentation and to validate whether the aspirations of the documents are \nachieved in reality.\nA key step is to identify the particular individuals to be included in the interview process. \nInitial considerations suggest that interviews with staff fulfilling a representative sample of \nroles within the repository are sensible. This could stretch from Director to janitors \n(cleaners). For instance, a casual chat with a janitor might reveal that, although the\nrepository's documentation states that to avoid data leakage all media from CDs to tapes are \nshredded or crushed before disposal, this does not happen in practice. Of course, in many \nsmaller organisations different activities that might in larger organisations be handled by \ndifferent individuals might be handled by a single person. The discussion should certainly be \nstructured in terms of roles, and not people. A series of example roles are described below:\nRepository's Administrators: Those in charge of the repository's operation provide \nan obvious starting point, and they ought to be capable of offering an institutional \noverview, as well as expert insight into the repository's mission, staff appointment \ncriteria, financial policy, and risk management strategies. While perhaps insufficiently \nhands-on to offer specific technical insights, they will have the greatest sense of the \noverall workflow that is undertaken from an object's ingest through to its subsequent \nretrieval. This broad view ought to be exploited.\nHardware and Software Administrators: Interviews with the individual(s) \nresponsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of repository hardware \nand software will assist in assessment of the appropriateness of technologies, and \nsecurity, disaster recovery or integrity measures.\nIngest, Archive and Preservation, and Access Officers: Those responsible for key \nfunctional units within the repository will be able to offer more in-depth insights into \nday-to-day operations than senior administrators. Interviews with these classes of staff \nshould facilitate the understanding of the way procedures and policies are developed \nand implemented. \nDepositors: While there may be practical concerns associated with securing depositor \ntestimonies, their views will contribute to establishing the repository's success in \nachieving the targets set within its depositor agreements. For instance, depositors will \nbe able to verify whether they are adequately informed when processes are completed \nand consulted about changes to repository procedures and services. The significance of \ntheir role will be determined in many cases by the nature of the repository and its \nrelationship with depositors. \nInformation Seekers: Similarly, interviews with information seekers may be difficult \nto set up, but they will support assessment of whether users are satisfied with the \nworking of the repository. This would complement or provide validation of user-based \nevaluation work. While it is true that most validation of user evaluation can be done\nthrough assessment of protocols, processes, and outputs, there are circumstances where \nauditors will find it appropriate to gather their own evidence from the community.\nAs vital as determining the list of potential interviewees is the identification of the core set of \nquestions that will direct the dialogue and effectively marry it with the checklist being used. \nCurrent DCC research is committed to the development of a semi-structured interview \ntemplate to facilitate the process of interview and personal engagement. This will be \ndesigned in a way that makes it extensible so that when issues arise as part of the pre-audit The Role of Evidence in Establishing Trust in Repositories http:\/\/www.dlib.org\/dlib\/july06\/ross\/07ross.html\n9 of 13 01\/08\/2006 17:25\nplanning or the documentary review, the template can be adjusted on an audit-by-audit basis \nto allow the auditors to probe for the necessary information.\n8. Conclusion and Next Steps\nEvidence will play a crucial role in the process of repository certification. Without an agreed\nbase of evidence against which to validate the checklist criteria, audits are likely to lack \nconsistency and will depend too much on judgement(s) that may prove difficult to replicate, \nsubstantiate, or validate. Unless, therefore, a checklist is associated with a defined evidence \nbase, its usefulness is diminished. Here we have considered the kinds of evidence that might \nprovide auditors with necessary information to assess the levels of risk associated with a \nparticular repository and to determine whether it should be certified as worthy of trust. In \norder to conceive an 'objective' and usable resource it is vital that any checklist offers \nrepositories and auditors the means to understand the criteria necessary to achieve a 'worthy \nof trust' status in measurable (although not necessarily quantifiable) terms, and offers clear \ninsights into how they might determine whether their own institution meets the criteria. This \napproach will not only facilitate the audit process, but will also assist institutions engaged in \nestablishing new repositories in defining the processes and types of documentation they \nshould put in place and maintain if they are to ensure that their organisation is 'working \nsmart' and that it is 'audit ready'. Even existing repositories may benefit from guidance on the \nkinds of documentation that auditors are likely to seek when assessing levels of trust.\nAlthough the community is a year or more away from spinning out audit and certification \nprocedures, it is not too early to consider the kinds of documentation that a repository should \nbe keeping.\nWhile we have suggested kinds of evidence that might underpin the use of repository \nchecklists, metrics for measuring compliance or the level25 at which a repository meets a \nparticular criterion require more research. As a corollary we might consider Chapin and\nAkridge's reflection that '[t]raditional security metrics are haphazard at best; at worst they \ngive a false impression of security that leads to inefficient or unsafe implementation of \nsecurity measures' [2]. This is a scenario that the repository community should wish to avoid.\nAnd, if we are to avoid it, we need to establish a secure evidence base and agree metrics for \nevaluating it.\nThere is a downside to considering the repository audit and certification process from the\npoint of view of evidence \u2013 it makes it readily apparent how much effort will be involved in\nthe audit process and how high the cost is likely to be in a way that checklists alone do not.\nOn the other hand, by considering the evidence and underlying processes, at an early stage,\nrepositories will be able to contain costs through adopting best practices.\nFinally as a community we need to consider how other audit and certification tools might be \nintegrated with our emerging checklists or tailored to meet our needs. As Hans Hofman, of \nthe Dutch National Archives, has observed on many occasions, any new methods need to be \nplaced in the larger audit context that includes such approaches as the COSO framework for \naudit,26 COBIT framework (Control Objectives for Information and Related \nTechnologies),27 ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) service management,28 ISO 9000 family of \nquality management and assurance standards,29 and ISO 17799 for information security.30\nThe digital repository building and management community, such as libraries and archives, \ndoes not appear so far to have paid sufficient attention to these other strands of activity and \ntools. They do have much to offer us and, we believe, we have much to learn from them.\nThis work should be undertaken alongside further refinement of evidence requirements and \ndevelopment of metrics for assessing and measuring checklist compliance.\n9.
