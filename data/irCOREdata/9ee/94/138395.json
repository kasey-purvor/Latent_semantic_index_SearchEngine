Introduction37\nSalt (NaCl) is generally added to foodstuffs to 1. improve taste and 2. as a preserving38\nagent. Indeed, historically, salt was among the very few effective preserving methods39\nknown. With the advent of refrigeration, better processing, packaging, transport and40\nstorage, there is less need for high salt levels to maintain product integrity. Furthermore,41\nconsumers want products with reduced sodium levels (e.g. due to its relationship with42\nhypertension), but where salt has been added as a preservation hurdle, removal or43\nreduction of the salt will reduce shelf-life and could affect safety in more microbiologically44\nfragile products.45\n46\nThe most obvious replacement for salt (NaCl) in food products is potassium chloride47\n(KCl). Strong, Foster and Duncan (1970) reported that for the growth of Clostridium48\nperfringens, solute identity had a bearing on the amount of growth for a given aw, with49\nKCl having a demonstrably greater effect than NaCl. Beuchat (1974), however, reported50\nthat at equivalent aw NaCl and KCl had equivalent effects against Vibrio51\nparahaemolyticus; it was reported that in fermented meat products, the replacement of52\nNaCl with KCl did not affect the degree of inhibition and or inactivation, but did alter the53\ntaste of the foodstuffs (Gimeno, Astiasaran, and Bello 1999; Gimeno, Astiasaran, and54\nBello 2001). More recently, Boziaris, Skandamis, Anastasiadi, and Nychas (2007) have55\nreported that equal-molar concentrations of NaCl or KCl exerted similar inhibitory effects56\nagainst Listeria monocytogenes in terms of lag phase duration, growth or death rate and57\nthat NaCl can be replaced by KCl without risking the microbiological safety, with respect58\nto L. monocytogenes, of the product. They also stated that in order to confirm this59\nobservation as general, a greater number of organisms needs to be studied.60\n61\n4In the work reported herein, we simply wanted to answer the following question: can KCl62\nbe a direct or partial replacement for NaCl? Since the area of investigation is potentially63\nvast, we concentrated our initial efforts on a few species of pathogenic bacteria with which64\nwe already had extensive modelling expertise on and which complimented other published65\nwork.66\n567\n2. Materials and methods68\n69\n2.1. Culture Preparation70\nAeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7092), Enterobacter sakazakii (1387-2NL), Staphylococcus71\naureus (ATCC 6538, ATCC 25923 (labeled as ST121 in this report), ST55 (isolated from72\npasta)), Yersinia enterocolitica (ATCC 9610) or Shigella flexneri (ATCC 12022) was73\ngrown overnight in a flask containing 80 ml tryptone soya broth (TSB; Oxoid CM 129)74\nshaking at 30oC. The cells were harvested, centrifuged to a pellet (512g, 10 mins, 15oC),75\nwashed and re-suspended in peptone water (0.1%). A standard inoculum was produced by76\ndiluting the culture to an OD of 0.5 at 600nm. This standardized culture was then further77\ndiluted in TSB to produce the starting inoculum (approx 1x105 CFU ml-1 in the microtitre78\nplate).79\n2.2. Experimental method80\nExperiments were carried out either using half-fold dilutions using the method of Lambert81\n& Pearson (2000) or by using linear dilutions from stock solutions of sodium chloride or82\npotassium chloride for the effect of individual inhibitors or the method of Lambert and83\nLambert (2003) for combined inhibitors.84\n2.3. Data analyses and model fitting85\nThe data obtained from the Bioscreen are tables of optical density (OD) and time. The time86\nto detection was defined as the time to produce an OD =0.2 at 600nm. The assumption87\nbeing made was that at an OD =0.2, each well had identical numbers of microorganisms.88\nFurthermore, microscopic checks were performed to see if cell elongation occurred at the89\nhighest salt levels used: no such elongation was observed. Data were transformed to the90\n6reciprocal in order to stabilise data variance. Wells which showed no visible growth during91\nthe period of the experiment were removed from the analysis (censored data).92\nPrevious publications (e.g. Lambert and Bidlas 2007) had used a general model for the93\nfitting of time to detection data (TTD). A modified form of this model, which allows for a94\ndefinitive MIC for individual inhibitors - the linear-exponential model (E-L), was used to95\nanalyse the data obtained, Eq.(1).96\nIf [x] = 0 , RTD = P097\n98\nElse if [x] < [P1],99\n100\nthen RTD= \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\n2\n1\n0\n][\nexp\nP\nP\nx\nP (1)101\nElse, RTD \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029120 log][log1 PxPe\nP\nee \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d102\n103\nWhere [x] is the concentration of the inhibitor, Pi are experimental parameters and e104\nis the exponential, RTD is the reciprocal of the time to detection (min-1).105\n106\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration was calculated from the parameter values obtained107\nfor each inhibitor using108\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d\n2\n1\n1\nexp\nP\nPMIC (2)109\nFor combined inhibitors (combinations of NaCl and KCl) the model of Lambert110\nand Lambert (2003) was modified in a similar way to Eq.(1) allowing a definitive growth-111\nno growth boundary to be constructed for combinations, Eq.(3)112\n7\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf03c\n\uf03d\uf03d\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n])ln[1(\n][exp\n0]ln[\n,0][\n0\n0\n0\n1\nEffCP\ne\nP\nRTD\nelse\nEffCPRTD\nthen\nEffC\nelse\nPRTDxif\nc\nP\nn\ni\ni\nc\nif\n(3)113\nWhere [EffC] = \uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6n\ni\nP\ni\ni\ni\nP\nx\n1 12\n2][\nand Pc is the multinomial exponent for the combined system114\n(Lambert and Lambert 2003).115\nData were fitted to the equation using non-linear regression using the minimised sum of116\nsquares as the search criterion.

Growth inhibition by sodium chloride and potassium chloride121\nThree species \u2013 the Gram negatives E. sakazakii and A. hydrophila and the Gram positive122\nS. aureus are used below to highlight the results obtained. Three strains of the latter123\norganism were used, due to the importance of humectant activity to control the growth of124\nthis organism. The results from these and the other two organisms examined in this study125\nare summarised in Table 1.126\n127\n3.2 Enterobacter sakazakii128\nOptical density\/incubation time data were collected using half-folded dilutions of NaCl or129\nKCl. When analysed using the modified RTD model there was an excellent fit; Figure 1130\nshows the results for the effect of KCl on the RTD. At KCl concentrations less than 1x104131\nmg l-1 (1 %), there is little effect on the rate to detection, i.e. shows uninhibited growth.132\nAbove 1%, inhibition increases and above 1.2x105 mg l-1 ( 12%) KCl no growth was133\nobserved.134\n135\nTable 1 gives the experimental parameters found in percent and in mol l-1. In terms of mol136\nl-1 the MIC of NaCl and KCl are within the 95% confidence interval of the mean137\n(calculated from the parameters P1 and P2) given for each humectant. Figure 2 compares138\nthe observed and fitted data for both the NaCl and KCl inhibition. From these results, when139\nexpressed in mol l-1, there is no evidence that NaCl and KCl have different inhibitory140\neffects against E. sakazakii. It was also found that in both cases there was evidence of a141\nthreshold concentration of approx. 0.1M added salt before any observation of growth142\ninhibition.143\n9144\n3.3. Staphylococcus aureus145\nComparison of NaCl and KCl were carried out on three strains of S. aureus (two standard146\nstrains and a factory isolate). Figure 3 shows the results of both experiments in terms of147\nmol l-1 for strain ST121. The time to detection was transformed using the natural logarithm.148\nThe curvature observed in Fig. 3 is typical for salt inhibition. Similar results were found149\nfor the other two S. aureus strains examined.150\n151\nIt can also be observed from the figure that as conditions become more harsh, the152\nvariability (or observed error) in the time to detection also increases, even although the153\nlogarithm transformation has been used. There is a general observation throughout154\npredictive microbiology that the variance increases as conditions become harsher and155\nwithout variance stabilisation the accuracy of models is reduced the closer they approach156\nthe MIC of the preservative. In this particular case the reciprocal transformation performs157\nbetter than the logarithmic.158\n159\n3.4. Combination NaCl and KCl experiments160\nIf the hypothesis that NaCl and KCl are mutually replaceable is correct, then the161\nantimicrobial effect of combinations of NaCl and KCl should be predictable. If the162\ncalculation is performed using a combined humectant concentration in terms of mol-1 then163\nthe modelling is facile. If, however, the separate identities are kept, then a complication164\narises due to the non-unity dose response. Previous work done on combined hurdles has165\nused the following equation to describe the effect on RTD (Lambert and Bidlas 2007)166\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf03d \uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf02d\nn\ni\nP\ni\ni\ni\nP\nx\nPRTD\n1 12\n0\n2][\nexp (4)167\n10\nFor combined NaCl and KCl equation (4) will only give an approximation to the observed168\npattern of inhibition because the parameter P2i for both humectants is approximately 2 and169\nthe above equation ignores the binomial expansion of the combined response. Equation (4),170\nwhich takes this into account was used to examine the observed RTD data for A.171\nhydrophila from a chequerboard of NaCl\/KCl mixtures (observed data Figure 4, modelled172\ndata Figure 5). There is a very good fit of the model to the observed data. Figure 6 shows a173\nplot of the observed and modelled RTD against the Effective Concentration; that the EffC174\nis made up from any combination of NaCl and KCl and that the observations all lie on or175\nclose to the modelled line is a simple graphical representation to show that there is no176\nsynergy between the two inhibitors, since any \u2018true\u2019 synergy would cause a mismatch.177\nFurther, the predicted values for the combined experiment (as opposed to the direct178\nmodelling of the observed data) are given in Table 2 for both the A. hydrophila and the179\nidentical E. sakazakii experiments. The predicted parameters are in agreement with those180\nmodelled from the observed data.181\n11\n4. Discussion182\nThis work focuses on the ability of potassium chloride to replace salt as an antimicrobial183\nhumectant. From this study KCl is a direct 1:1 molar replacement for the antimicrobial184\neffect of common salt. This study enhances the work done by Boziaris et al. (2007) and185\ndelivers the same conclusion for a larger spectrum of pathogens. There is still, however,186\nclarification required for some of the other common pathogens as the paper by Strong et al.187\n(1970) would suggest. There is also one point which needs to be made: there is no188\ndifferentiation in this hypothesis of the equivalence of KCl and NaCl for the antimicrobial189\neffect to be due to the chloride ion. The use of calcium chloride and other similar salts190\nwould immediately differentiate these two possibilities.191\n192\nThe model and the definition used for the effective concentration are direct applications of193\nthe Gamma hypothesis (Zwietering, Wijtzes, De Wit and Van\u2019t Riet 1992) - that individual194\ninhibitors act independently against the growth of microorganisms. Recently, attempts had195\nbeen made to expand the hypothesis to include the possibility of factor interaction, based196\non the observation of the shape of the Growth\/No growth boundary for combined197\nantimicrobials (Augustin and Carlier 2000; Le Marc, Huchet, Bourgeois, Guyonnet, Mafart198\nand Thuault 2002). The model described here adequately describes the shape of these199\nG\/NG boundaries without recourse to altering the Zwietering hypothesis.200\n201\nFigure 7 shows the calculated Growth\/No Growth boundary for combinations of NaCl and202\nKCl for the organisms studied. From equation (3) when the effective concentration is203\ngreater than 1, the linear function takes over the description of the level of inhibition. For a204\ngiven RTD this describes a contour for a twin-mix of inhibitors, a surface for ternary-205\nmixes and hypersurfaces for mixtures with greater numbers of components. The RTD = 0206\ncontour, i.e. the absolute growth\/no growth boundary is given by207\n12\n)\/1(\n])ln[1(0 0\nc\nc\nPExpEffC\nEffCP\ne\nP\nRTD\n\uf03d\n\uf05c\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d\n208\nFor any combination of inhibitors where the calculated effective concentration is equal to209\nExp(1\/Pc), this combination will define a point on the MIC contour (surface, etc). Any210\ncombination with EffC > Exp(1\/Pc) lies in a NG zone, and any with EffC < Exp(1\/Pc) lies211\nin a G zone. For a given organism, conditions beyond the calculated boundary line will212\nresult in no growth. If total salt concentrations, for a given product, are within a boundary213\nline, then other preservative factors (e.g. temperature or weak acid preservatives) have to214\nbe used to ensure no growth.215\n216\nMost antimicrobial hurdles examined previously such as pH and weak acids give a linear217\nrelationship between the log of the time to detection and the concentration, hence the dose218\nresponse parameter P2 \uf0401 (Lambert and Bidlas 2007). Combinations of such hurdles will219\nalso give Pc \uf040 1. The humectants used in this study, NaCl and KCl are unusual in that the220\ndose response of each was approximately 2. Dose responses of other antimicrobials can221\nvary substantially e.g. phenolics have dose responses (or dilution coefficients) >6,222\n(Lambert and Johnston 2000; Lambert and Lambert 2003).223\n224\nModelling offers a cost-effective approach to understanding the microbial growth response225\nin foods. Indeed Zwietering (Zwietering et al.1996) has said that using a model to predict226\nthe consequences of changing a formulation on microbial growth is a factor of 1000227\nquicker than attempting a large scale storage trial. Of course the formulator needs access to228\nthe model in the first place and must also have an idea of its robustness. However, the use229\nof mathematical models can help to reduce the need for storage trials, challenge tests,230\nproduct reformulations and process modifications, which are labour intensive, time231\n13\nconsuming and expensive. The above example of NaCl vs. KCl is an example whereby a232\nrelatively rapid method of obtaining relevant information in conjunction with a robust233\nmodel leads to a simple algorithm for NaCl replacement, allowing a product developer to234\ngain insight perhaps 1000 times faster.235\n14\n236\nReferences237\n238\nAugustin, J-C. and Carlier, V., 2000.
