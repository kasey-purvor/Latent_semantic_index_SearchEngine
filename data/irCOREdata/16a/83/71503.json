It addresses the problem of active sensing, i.e.\nthe selection of a robot motion or sequence of motions, which make the robot arrive in its desired goal\nconfiguration (position and orientation) with maximum accuracy, given the available sensor information.\nThe optimal trajectory is parameterized as a linear combination of sinusoidal functions. An appropriate\noptimality criterion is selected which takes into account various requirements (e.g. maximum accuracy\nand minimum time). Several constraints can be formulated, e.g. with respect to collision avoidance. The\noptimal trajectory is then determined by numerical optimization techniques. The approach is applicable to\nboth nonholonomic and holonomic robots. Its effectiveness is illustrated here for a nonholonomic wheeled\nmobile robot (WMR) in an environment with and without obstacles.\nKeywords: active sensing, mobile robots, uncertainty, trajectory generation, information gain\n1 Motivation\nMany applications in mobile robotics have sophisticated motion requirements. A successful task completion\nis often related to reaching quite accurately a goal while processing noisy sensor data under uncertainties.\nThis refers to active sensing, the main question of which is: \u201cWhat motion should the robot execute in\norder to gain (the most accurate) information about its environment?\u201d. Active sensing is a challenging\ntopic for different reasons. The solution depends on the optimality criterion. This should be such that\nmaximum information is extracted from the sensor data. At the same time computationally efficient sensor\ndata processing is needed for the on-line execution of the generated motions. Obstacle avoidance adds an\nanother level of difficulty [12]. Uncertainty (e.g. in the model and sensor data) call for stochastic estimation\nand control techniques. The nonlinear character of the problem adds further difficulty to this. Finally, for\nnonholonomic systems nonholonomic constraints have to be taken into account, so that the generated path\nfrom the admissible configuration space corresponds to a feasible trajectory [22], [13].\nThis paper introduces an approach for trajectory optimization based on information gain. A mobile\nrobot is moving in the Cartesian plane starting from an initial configuration to a desired goal configuration\nwhich has to be reached with maximum accuracy. While moving around, the robot can make use of\nuncertain sensor data to improve the estimate of its configuration (position and orientation). The sensor data\nconsist of distance and orientation measured with respect to one or more beacons. Hence, the optimization\nproblem consists in finding the path that minimizes the uncertainty of the configuration estimate at the goal\nconfiguration.\nBetween two points there are an infinite number of trajectories. The key idea is to represent them by\na parameterized family of possible trajectories. This way the infinite-dimensional optimization problem\nis reduced to a finite-dimensional, parameterized optimization problem. We propose to use multisine\ntrajectories: deviations from a nominal trajectory are represented by linear combinations of a limited\nnumber of sines. Active sensing is considered as a global optimization problem subject to constraints.\nSeveral optimization criteria are possible, such as entropy [23] or a weighted trace of the covariance matrix,\nrespectively the Fisher information matrix at the final configuration estimate. The covariance matrix results\nfrom a stochastic estimator: standard linear Kalman filter (KF) [11], extended KF [1], unscented KF [10],\nor other Kalman filtering technique.\nOne feature of our approach is that the optimal trajectory is generated as a linear combination of sine\nfunctions. This parameterization is appealing because: 1) the complete path can be characterized by a\nlimited number of parameters; 2) all primitives satisfy, at least partially, the boundary conditions in initial\nand goal configuration; 3) the harmonic content of the motion, hence the maximum maneuvering frequency,\nis explicitly kept under control. On the other hand, the disadvantage \u2013 as opposed to e.g. splines \u2013 is that\nit is a global parameterization. In particular, modifications of the path, e.g. to avoid an obstacle, have a\nglobal effect. Multisines are rich excitation signals which are often used in experimental system identification\n[24, 6]. And in fact, system identification and active sensing can be considered as one and the same problem.\nMultisines have also proved to offer advantages for nonholonomic control systems (they assure smooth\nstabilization), which could be interesting if tracking control is added later on to the estimation problem\nconsidered here. It should be noted that within our approach other parameterizations are also possible.\n1.1 Related Work\nActive sensing corresponds to a constrained optimization of a multi-objective criterion with respect to a\nsequence of actions. Different kinds of problems arise and the methods for their solution can be classified\nin two groups: i) the sequence of actions is restricted to a parametrized trajectory or trajectory represented\nby some functions [4], [12], [18], [2], [3]. To this group belongs the approach, proposed in the present paper.\nIn [7] the choice of \u201cwhere to look next\u201d is treated as a special case of an optimal experiment design.\nMinimization of the weighted trace of the estimation error covariance matrix is chosen as a criterion to\nperform the next motion. ii) The sequence of actions is not reduced to a parametrized trajectory. Then\nMarkov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs optimization problems need to be solved\n[25, 5]. The robot actions and the environment are modeled in a statistical framework. Solutions proposed\nin [21, 5, 8] are based on minimization of a probabilistic metric (entropy). The method developed in [5]\nis applied under positional uncertainty; the approach proposed here is suitable under both positional and\norientation uncertainty.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the motion and measurement models\nof the considered nonholonomic WMR. The proposed approach for trajectory optimization is introduced\nin Section 3. Simulation studies illustrating its effectiveness are presented in Section 4. Finally Section 5\ndiscusses the results and Section 6 summarizes the conclusions.\n2 Motion and Measurement Models\nThe following active sensing task is considered. The WMR starting from a configuration (position and\norientation) (xs, ys, \u03c6s)\nT is required to reach a desired goal configuration (xg, yg, \u03c6g)\nT moving around a\nknown, nominal reference trajectory (xr,k, yr,k, \u03c6r,k)\nT . k represents the discrete time index. The actually\nexecuted, modified trajectory is determined by (xk, yk, \u03c6k)\nT . The WMR generates its actions by processing\nmeasurement data originating from one or more beacons.\nThe vehicle motion is described by the model [17]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed xk+1yk+1\n\u03c6k+1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edxk + vk\u2206Tcos(\u03c6k + \u03c8k)yk + vk\u2206Tsin(\u03c6k + \u03c8k)\n\u03c6k +\nvk\u2206T\nL sin\u03c8k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u03b7x,k\u03b7y,k\n\u03b7\u03c6,k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ,\nwhere xk and yk denote the WMR position coordinates with respect to a fixed frame (Fig. 1), and \u03c6k\nrepresents the orientation angle with respect to the x axis. They form the state vector xk = (xk, yk, \u03c6k)\nT . L\nis the wheel base (the distance between the front steering wheel and the axis of the driving wheels), \u2206T is the\nsampling time, and \u03b7k = (\u03b7x,k, \u03b7x,k, \u03b7\u03c6,k)\nT represents the process noise. The WMR is controlled through a\ndemanded velocity vk and a direction of travel \u03c8k, i.e. the control vector is uk = (vk, \u03c8k)\nT . Due to physical\n101\ny\ny\nx\nk\u03c8 k\u03c6\nky\nkx\nL \u03b1k\nreference trajectory\n\u03b2k\nmodifed trajectory\nBeacon\n)( BB y,x\nk\u03b8\n\u03b2kkl\nFigure 1: WMR coordinates\nconstraints, both the velocity vk, and the angle \u03c8k cannot exceed boundary values, namely vk \u2208 [0, vmax],\n\u03c8k \u2208 [\u2212\u03c8max, \u03c8max] (\u03c8max \u2264\npi\n2\n). The WMR can only perform forward motions.\nThe vehicle is equipped with a sensor measuring the range rk and bearing \u03b8k to a beacon B, located at\nknown coordinates, (xB , yB)\nT . The observation equation for the beacon is given by [17]\n(\nrk\n\u03b8k\n)\n=\n(\u221a\n(xB \u2212 xk)2 + (yB \u2212 yk)2\narctan( yB\u2212ykxB\u2212xk )\u2212 \u03c6k\n)\n+\n(\n\u03ber,k\n\u03be\u03b8,k\n)\n,\nwhere \u03bek = (\u03ber,k, \u03be\u03b8,k)\nT is the observation noise. The measurement vector is further denoted by zk =\n(rk, \u03b8k)\nT . The noise vectors \u03b7k and \u03bek are assumed Gaussian, zero mean, mutually uncorrelated, with\ncovariances Qk and Rk, respectively.\nThe relative location of the beacon with respect to the moving WMR is of paramount importance for the\nactive sensing task, for providing accurate and informative sensor data. If more (nB) beacons are available,\nthe observation equation acquires the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nr1,k\n\u03b81,k\n...\nrnB ,k\n\u03b8nB ,k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u221a\n(x\u02dc1,k)2 + (y\u02dc1,k)2\narctan(\ny\u02dc1,k\nx\u02dc1,k\n)\u2212 \u03c6k\n...\u221a\n(x\u02dcnB ,k)\n2 + (y\u02dcnB ,k)\n2\narctan(\ny\u02dcnB,k\nx\u02dcnB,k\n)\u2212 \u03c6k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n+\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03ber1,k\n\u03be\u03b81,k\n...\n\u03bernB ,k\n\u03be\u03b8nB ,k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n,\nwhere x\u02dci,k = xBi \u2212 xk, y\u02dci,k = yBi \u2212 yk, i = 1, . . . , nB and with a measurement covariance matrix\nRk = diag{R1,k, . . . , RnB ,k}.\n3 Trajectory Optimization\nConsider the case when the optimization starts from a known, nominal reference trajectory between the\nstarting and the goal configuration.\nThe problem of determining the \u2018best\u2019 trajectory q\u2217 with respect to an optimality criterion J can be\nformulated as to find\nq\u2217 = argmin(J) (1)\nsubject to constraints\n|ci,k| \u2264 ci,thr, (2)\n102\nkl\nR e f e r e n c e  t r a j e c t o r y\nG e n e r a t e d  t r a j e c t o r y\nFigure 2: Lateral Deviation lk\nwhere the variables ci,k, i = 1, . . . , r are bounded by threshold values ci,thr (e.g. maximal lateral deviation\nfrom a reference trajectory, maximal velocity and acceleration, maximal steering angle, minimum distance\nto obstacles, etc.). The optimality criterion to be minimized is a measure of the accuracy of the robot\u2019s\nconfiguration estimate.\nThe approach is based on a parametrization of the class\nQ = Q(p), p \u2208 P, (3)\nof harmonic functions, where p is a vector of parameters obeying to preset physical constraints. With N the\nnumber of harmonic functions, the new (modified) robot trajectory is generated on the basis of the reference\none by the lateral deviation lk (lateral is the orthogonal robot motion deviation from the reference trajectory\nin y direction, Fig. 2) as a linear superposition\nlk =\nN\u2211\ni=1\nAisin(ipi\nsr,k\nsr,total\n), (4)\nof sinusoids, the amplitudes Ai of which are constants, sr,k is the path length up to instant k, sr,total is the\ntotal path length, and r refers to the reference trajectory. Expressed as a function of the time, the lateral\ndeviation is\nlk =\nN\u2211\ni=1\nAisin(ipi\ntk\nttotal\n), (5)\nwhere tk is the current time, and ttotal is a preset time for reaching the goal configuration.\nClearly, the problem described above can be cast into the problem of trajectory generation of a system\ndescribed by equations of the form\nxk+1 = f(xk,uk,\u03b7k) (6)\nzk+1 = h(xk+1, \u03bek+1) (7)\nwith f and h nonlinear functions. In this formulation active sensing is a global optimization problem (on the\nwhole robot trajectory) with a criterion to be minimized\nJ = min\nAi,k\n{a1U + a2C} (8)\nunder constraints (2). U characterizes the expected uncertainty to be minimized (or information extraction\nand accuracy to be maximized), C is the cost part. As U could be chosen any information function, e.g. the\nentropy, or a scalar function of the covariance matrix of the estimated states. Information functions (like\nthe logarithm of the determinant of the covariance matrix and the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance\nmatrix) possess the properties of nonnegativity, concavity, etc. that make them suitable for ranking [7].\nHere U is in the form\nU = trace(WP ), (9)\nwhere P is the covariance matrix of the estimated states (at the goal configuration), W is a weighting\nmatrix; trace(\u00b7) denotes the matrix trace; a1 and a2 above are dimensionless positive weighting constants,\n103\ngiving different weight to the information and cost terms of J . C accounts for losses such as time, traveled\ndistance, etc. Here C is assumed to be the relative time\nC = ttotal\/tr,total, (10)\nwhere ttotal is the total time for reaching the goal configuration on the modified trajectory versus the\nrespective time tr,total over the reference trajectory. Minimization of J with respect to parameters of\nthe modified trajectories guarantees trajectories with minimal uncertainty bounds. Within a statistical\nframework the covariance matrix P represents an information criterion. The weighting matrixW is presented\nas a product of a normalizing matrix N , and a scaling matrix M , W = M N . The normalizing matrix\nN = diag{1\/\u03c321 , 1\/\u03c3\n2\n2 , . . . , \u03c3\n2\nn}, (n is the state vector dimension) transforms the criterion into a measure\nwhich is invariant to different physical units. \u03c3i, i = 1, . . . , n, are assumed here to be the standard deviations\nat the goal configuration on the reference trajectory. Depending on the particular task, they could be chosen\notherwise. The scaling matrix M = diag{m1, . . . ,mn} gives different weights to the separate terms of the\ntrace. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that\n\u2211n\ni=1mi = n. The criterion J is a dimensionless scalar.\nAs \u2018good\u2019 are considered trajectories which at the goal configuration have U \u2208 [0, n], i.e. less than for the\nreference trajectory.\nWhen importance is given to accuracy of both the goal configuration, and the intermediate configurations,\nthe optimization could be performed by averaging over an interval [ka, kb],\nU =\n1\nkb \u2212 ka\nkb\u2211\nk=ka\ntrace(WkP k). (11)\nThe \u03c3i, participating in the normalizing matrix N could then be the average standard deviations with\naveraging performed on the whole reference trajectory or over a part of it. Other choices of \u03c3i are possible,\ndepending on the task.\nFor the considered WMR the constraints (2) are of the form\n|lk| \u2264 lmax, (12)\nvk \u2264 vmax, (13)\n|\u03c8k| \u2264 \u03c8max, (14)\n|\u03c6end \u2212 \u03c6g| \u2264 \u03c6error, (15)\ndoj ,k \u2265 doj ,min, (16)\nwhere lk is the lateral deviation of the optimal trajectory from the reference one, lmax is the maximum allowed\nlateral deviation. A constraint is introduced for the goal orientation angle, \u03c6g. The WMR orientation angle\n\u03c6end at the end of the path should be close to \u03c6g, with accuracy, preset by an acceptable error \u03c6error.\nThe distance doj ,k =\n\u221a\n(xk \u2212 xo,j)2 + (yk \u2212 yo,j)2 from the WMR to the j-th obstacle, j = 1, 2, . . . , nobs\n(xo,j and yo,j are the obstacle coordinates, nobs is the number of obstacles) should be bigger than a preset\nthreshold doj ,min. Other constraints could also be taken into account in a similar way, e.g. about the rate\nof change of vk, the rate of change of \u03c8k, or some of the constraints could be omitted, [15, 16]. The problem\nof trajectory optimization without a reference trajectory can be solved in a similar way to the case with a\nreference trajectory.\n4 Simulation Studies\nThis Section presents simulation results showing the performance of the multisine approach.\nThe state estimation used throughout the present paper is based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)\n[10], [26]. The unscented transformation approximates a probability distribution based on a small number\nof deterministically chosen test points, referred to as sigma points which have the same first, second and\npossibly higher moments, as the estimate. The UKF is implemented here in its form with an augmented\nstate vector (a concatenation of the states and the noises) [26]. The sigma points and their weights are\n104\ncalculated using the more accurate scaled Unscented Transform [9]. It does not require linearization, nor\nexplicit calculation of Jacobians and Hessians and it is numerically stable due to its factorization-based form.\nExample 1. The WMR is moving in the presence of a reference trajectory straight line in an obstacle-\nfree environment between starting and goal configurations, respectively xs = (1 m, 15 m, 0 deg)\nT , xg =\n(12.84 m, 15 m, 0 deg)T with a constant velocity v = 0.12 m\/sec. The beacon is located in a point with\ncoordinates xB = 9 m, yB = 19 m. It is assumed that vmax = 0.2 m\/sec, \u03c8max = 60 deg, lmax = 3 m and\nL = 0.5 m.\nThe UKF is implemented with the following parameters, recommendable for systems with Gaussian noises\nand of order n = 3 (so that \u03ba + n = 3) [9, 26] : \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 2, \u03ba = 0. The sigma points and their weights\nare calculated using the Scaled Unscented Transformation [9], [26]. The initial state estimate vector and\ncovariance matrix are: x\u02c60\/0 = (1 m, 15 m, 0 deg)\nT and P 0 = diag{0.3 m\n2, 0.3 m2, 0.0025 deg2}. The system\nand measurement noise covariance matrices are taken as\nQk = diag{10\n\u22126 m2, 10\u22126 m2, 10\u22124 deg2},\nRk = diag{0.0004dk\n2 m2, 100 deg2},\nwhere dk is the distance from the WMR to the beacon. Measured distances dk are used for simulating\nthe measurements, estimated values are used in the UKF (like in [20]). The covariance matrix P k of the\nestimation error xk \u2212 x\u02c6k defines an uncertainty ellipsoid (xk \u2212 x\u02c6k)\nTP k(xk \u2212 x\u02c6k) = 1 that, with respect to\nthe positions only represents a confidence ellipse, characterizing the performance of the active sensing.\nThe reference trajectory and modified trajectory, generated with different numbers of sinusoids N (in\naccordance with (4), criterion (8) with terms (9) and (10) ) together with the uncertainty ellipses are shown\non Fig. 3.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n14\n14.5\n15\n15.5\n16\n16.5\n17\n17.5\n18\n18.5\n19\nBeacon\ny \npo\nsit\nio\nn, \n[m\n]\nx position, [m]\nN=0\nN=2\nN=3 N=5\nFigure 3: Trajectories, generated with (9) and (10), and different number N of sine terms. Uncertainty\nellipses plotted around the trajectories.\nThe evolution in time of the weighted covariance trace is presented in Fig. 4. The multisine approach\ngives faster increase of the information at the beginning of the modified trajectories, than those on the\nstraight-line. Constraints (12)\u2013(15) are taken into account. The normalizing and scaling matrices in\nthe criterion J are chosen in the form: N = diag{1\/\u03c32x, 1\/\u03c3\n2\ny, 1\/\u03c3\n2\n\u03c6}, M = I, where I denotes the\nidentity matrix. The generated optimal trajectory is required to have a value of J that is smaller than\nthe straight line trajectory and for this reason it is advisable to choose the elements of the normalizing\nmatrix N equal to the standard deviations of P on the straight line (at the final time step), namely\n\u03c32x = 0.15\n2 m2, \u03c32y = 0.15\n2 m2, \u03c32\u03c6 = 2.16\n2 deg2, computed by setting N = 0. The WMR should finish\nwith an error for the orientation angle less than \u03c6error = 1 deg. The bigger N is, the smaller the value of\nJ is. Table 1 contains the values of U , C, and J (computed with a1 = 1, a2 = 0.1). As is obvious from\n105\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\ntra\nce\n(W\nP)\ntime, [sec]\nN=0\nN=2\nN=3 N=5\nFigure 4: Evolution of trace(WP ) in time\nTable 1: Results with one beacon, U in the form (9)\nN U C J\n0 3.00 1.00 3.10\n2 2.92 1.09 3.03\n3 2.90 1.10 3.01\n5 2.81 1.23 2.93\nFig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table 1 the most accurate results at the goal configuration for U and J are obtained\nwith N = 5 sinusoids. Better accuracy is provided with bigger N , at the cost of increased computational\nload. Nevertheless, even N = 3 terms results in an improved final accuracy. The constrained optimization\nis performed using the \u201cFMINCON\u201d function of the Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB [14]. This function\nmakes use of a sequential quadratic programming method.\nOther amplitudes and trajectories have been generated using the criterion (11), by averaging within the\ninterval [30sec, 100sec]. The normalization is performed with respect to the average standard deviations\nsquared of the straight line. The trajectories are shown in Fig. 5, the average information criterion (11) is\ngiven in Table 2. For comparison, criterion (9) is also computed (with the obtained optimal amplitudes)\nand given in Fig. 6. Evidently, the general performance is considerably improved compared to the reference\ntrajectory by using (11).\nResults with two beacons are given in Fig. 7 and in Table 3. All initial conditions are the same as in the\none beacon experiment, including the beacon position. Additionally another beacon is added. The plotted\nellipses are 3\u03c3 uncertainty ellipses.

Obviously, more beacons placed in an appropriate way\nto cover well the whole area lead to considerable accuracy improvement. On the other side the computational\nload is augmented proportionally to the number of beacons.\nExample 2. This example illustrates the approach application for a more complex trajectory. It is a point-\nto-point optimization. The initial and goal configurations are respectively xs = (1 m, 15 m,\u2212155 deg)\nT ,\nxg = (8 m, 18 m,\u221250 deg)\nT , keeping the same initial conditions and constants as in Example 1. Because\nthe starting and goal orientation angle differ considerably, the WMR trajectory is generated as composed of\ntwo arcs and a straight line between them. There are few groups of possible robot trajectories, composed of\nstraight line segments and tangential circular lines [19]. Two circles are passing through the starting point\nwith a radius R = L\/sin(\u03c8max). At the beginning the WMR performs a turn with a maximum steering\nangle, after that it moves on the trajectory, around the straight line connecting the two tangential points,\nand finally it turns again on a circular arc. So, this more complex trajectory is generated similarly to the\nstraight line case, incorporating two extra circular segments. In general, to find the best path for each group\nof trajectories an optimization is performed and between the optimized trajectories (possible combinations\nof arcs and straight lines) could be chosen the one with the smallest criterion value. Fig. 8 shows one such\ngenerated trajectory, with criterion U in the form (9).

As it has been shown the generated trajectories are smooth, always obeying the\nposition constraints at the starting and goal configurations. The approach has been applied with landmarks\n(beacons) with known positions. Nevertheless, generalization for the case of unknown beacons\u2019 positions is\nstraightforward. The beacons\u2019 positions then should be estimated together with the system states like in\n[20]. By active sensing the robot is approaching to the beacons (obvious from the results in the examples),\nthat is a distinction from a movement over a reference trajectory.\nA performance criterion has been defined and applied to trajectory optimization. The criterion for active\nsensing has the following features:\n\u2022 it incorporates information and cost parts;\n\u2022 the influence of the different factors is decoupled;\n\u2022 the information term characterizes information extraction and accuracy at the goal configuration, which\nthe WMR is required to reach;\n\u2022 it is invariant to physical units and is formulated in an appropriate way to gain information from the\nmeasurements;\n\u2022 the cost term represents the ratio between the final time for reaching the goal configuration and the\nrespective time for moving over the modified trajectory;\n\u2022 observing the criterion, conclusions can be drawn about the accuracy, as well as the convergence rate\nof the optimization procedure;\n\u2022 it provides an optimization over the whole trajectory (global optimization procedure);\n\u2022 the criterion is minimized, while satisfying nonholonomic, physical and boundary constraints;\n\u2022 the presence of known obstacles is accounted by adding additional constraints to the optimization;\n\u2022 the simulation results obtained even with small number of sine functions, N = 3, show very good\naccuracy at the goal configuration;\n\u2022 the approach has been applied to a nonholonomic WMR, but it is general and can be implemented to\nother systems. It is suitable both for simple trajectories (line segments or arcs), and more complex\nones. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through simulation studies. A next step for future work\nis to implement it in a real experimental set up.\n109\n6 Conclusions\nThis paper introduces an information-based approach for trajectory optimization of a robot moving between\ntwo configurations. The solution is searched within a preset class of functions, namely those of the harmonics.\nThe optimal trajectory represents a linear combination of sine functions. The problem has been examined as\na global optimization subject to constraints. Both cases with and without reference trajectory, with one and\nmore sensors have been considered. It is shown that more sensors located in an appropriate place improve\nconsiderably the accuracy. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by different simulation results\nwith a WMR in environment with and without obstacles.\nAcknowledgments.
