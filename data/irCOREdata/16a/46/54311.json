We investigated \nthe effect of switching environmental contexts on the ability of adult laboratory rats, \nRattus norvegicus, to recognize and habituate to repeated presentations of juvenile \nconspecifics. Adults were exposed to juveniles for four periods of 5 min, separated by \na 15-min interval. Rats either received all four exposures in the same context, or the \nfirst three in one context and the fourth in a different context. Half the rats in this \nlatter group were familiarised with both contexts prior to testing, the other half had no \nexperience of either. In all groups, the adults reduced their investigation of the \njuveniles over the three initial exposures. Mild aggression increased over the same \nperiod for the context-unfamiliar rats. A significant reduction in investigation by these \nrats between the third and fourth exposures, when the context was changed, suggested \nthat the context switch further increased habituation to the juveniles. However, the \ncontext-familiar rats showed no such change, indicating that the changes observed for \nthe context-unfamiliar rats were due to the effect of context novelty. This was \nsupported by the finding that, during the first exposure, context-familiar adults \ninvestigated juveniles more and were more aggressive than those for which the \ncontexts were novel. These results suggest that familiar contextual cues play only a \nminor role in the short-term social memory of laboratory rats. \n22 \n24 \n26 \n28 \n30 \n32 \n34 \n36 \n38 \n40 \n \n 1\nIntroduction 42 \n44 \n46 \n48 \n50 \n52 \n54 \n56 \n58 \n60 \n62 \n64 \n66 \nThere is increasing evidence that the environmental context in which an experiment \ntakes place can have a substantial influence on the learning and memory of the \nsubjects involved (e.g. Spear 1973; Bouton & Peck 1989; Bouton & Swartzentruber \n1989). Contextual cues play an important role in the ability of human subjects to \nrecall previously learnt information, with information more accurately recalled if the \ntest context is the same as that for training (e.g. Gordon & Klein 1994). The evidence \nfor context specificity in non human animals has often been contradictory, however, \nand this has resulted in a more confused picture of how environmental context may \ninfluence memory formation, retention and recall (e.g. Marlin & Miller 1981; Evans \n& Hammond 1983). Nevertheless, if contextual cues play a role in non-human animal \nmemory, then this could have important consequences for animal welfare. If both \nexternal (e.g. Rodriguez et al. 1993) and internal (e.g. Holloway & Wansley 1973) \ncontextual cues are able to influence animal learning and memory, then aspects of \nanimal memory may be disturbed by routine husbandry procedures. For example, the \nmixing of familiar conspecifics in the novel context of an unfamiliar pen may lead to \na failure of social recognition, and subsequent inappropriate aggression. It is, \ntherefore, of both fundamental and applied interest to investigate the influence of \ncontext specificity on animal learning and memory. \n \nSocial memory, the ability to form, retain and refer to information related to a \nconspecific, is  a key area for trying to determine if, and to what extent, contextual \ncues might be involved. For instance, in social memory and recognition research there \nmay be difficulties in determining whether a subject is recognizing an individual \nconspecific independently of the context in which that individual has been introduced \n 2\n(e.g. Falls & Brooks 1975; Snowdon & Cleveland 1979; Waas & Colgan 1994). To \ninvestigate this issue we used a social recognition test based on a natural propensity of \nlaboratory rats to investigate other individuals. In this test the duration of \ninvestigation of a conspecific declines with the repeated presentation of that \nconspecific to the subject animal (e.g. Sekiguchi et al. 1991). This habituation is taken \nas an indication that the conspecific is recognized, because dishabituation occurs \nwhen a novel conspecific is presented. \n68 \n70 \n72 \n74 \n76 \n78 \n80 \n82 \n84 \n86 \n88 \n90 \n \nPrevious investigations of whether habituation shows context specificity, have \nrevealed conflicting results. Some researchers have found that habituation does \nsuccessfully transfer across contexts (e.g. Marlin & Miller 1981); others have \nobserved dishabituation following context change (e.g. Evans & Hammond 1983). \nSuch studies have been criticized, however, for being inadequately controlled (e.g. \nHall & Honey 1989; Gordon & Klein 1994). A lack of context specificity might have \narisen only because the subject has failed to discriminate between the two contexts, \nwhilst any apparent context specificity could just be due to generalization decrement, \nwith the perception of the stimulus being altered by the change in context (Hall & \nHoney 1989). More recent and controlled studies (e.g. Hall & Channell 1985; Hall & \nHoney 1989; Honey et al. 1992) have concluded that habituation does not show \ncontext specificity. These studies of habituation have focused on unconditioned \nresponses such as orientation towards light (Hall & Channell 1985), consumption of a \nnovel flavour (Honey et al. 1992) and disruption of an appetitively rewarded response \nby stimulus (either light or tone) presentation (Hall & Honey 1989).  \n \n 3\nThe aim of this experiment was to produce further evidence on whether \nhabituation shows context specificity, and to extend previous work by focusing on the \nsocial behaviour of the laboratory rat, particularly the habituation of investigative \nbehaviour after repeated presentations of a conspecific. We also aimed to separate the \neffects of environmental context per se, from the potentially confounding influence of \ncontext novelty. The results of this experiment can therefore be applied directly to \nsituations in which environmental context may be having an influence on an animal\u2019s \nsocial learning and memory. \n92 \n94 \n96 \n98 \n100 \n102 \n104 \n106 \n108 \n110 \n112 \n114 \n \nMETHODS \n \nSubjects, Housing and Care \n \nWe used 36 adult (3 months old at start of study) and 24 juvenile (28 days old \nat start of study) male lister hooded rats (Harlan UK Ltd.). All the rats were housed \nindividually in standard laboratory cages (33 x 50 x 21cm) with sawdust litter and an \nenrichment toy. Food (Harlan Teklad Laboratory Diet) and water were freely \navailable. All the rats were housed in the same room in which they were tested, with \nthe juveniles and adults kept at opposite ends. The room was temperature controlled \n(20\u00b0c \u00b1 1) and maintained on a reverse lighting schedule (lights on 1900-0700 hours), \nwith red light (60 Watt) providing visibility for the researcher. Dim \u2018white\u2019 light (10 \nWatt) was provided during testing. \n \nExperimental Design \n \n 4\nWe used the social recognition test (Thor & Holloway 1982), which is based \nupon a comparison of behaviour, particularly investigation, between two exposures of \nthe same individual to a subject animal. A reduction in investigation in the second \nexposure implies recognition of the individual, whereas no change suggests that the \nsubject\u2019s social memory of that individual has decayed over the interval between \nexposures. This latter response is the same as that seen when a novel individual is \nintroduced in the second exposure. We also used elements of the habituation-\ndiscrimination technique (e.g. Halpin 1986; Johnston 1993; Johnston & Jernigan \n1994), in which a subject animal is repeatedly presented with the odour from one \nindividual, which should lead to habituation, before being presented with the odour of \na novel individual, which may or may not result in dishabituation. \n116 \n118 \n120 \n122 \n124 \n126 \n128 \n130 \n132 \n134 \n136 \n138 \n \nAs an index of habituation, we used the decline in investigation of a juvenile \nby an adult. Previous research has demonstrated habituation for multiple short term \nexposures, such as six bouts of 5 min, separated by short IEIs of 10 min (Sekiguchi et \nal. 1991). Social memory after short term exposures appears to be relatively brief, \nwith no apparent recognition by a male adult rat of a juvenile previously introduced \nfor 5 min, after an interval of 120 min (e.g. Thor & Holloway 1982; Dantzer et al. \n1987). We exposed juveniles to adults for four consecutive 5-min exposures each \nseparated by a 15-min interval, during which the juveniles were returned to their \nhome cages. The fourth \u2018test\u2019 exposure allowed us to determine if habituation to the \nstimulus remained, or if the treatment, such as a change in context, resulted in \ndishabituation.  \n \n 5\nAll the adults were introduced to juveniles in a pre test training experiment in \norder that any overtly aggressive adults could be excluded from the experiment. This \ntraining took the form of two exposures of 15 min to the same adult by a particular \njuvenile, separated by 48 hrs. Observations were made of the total amount of \ninvestigation and mildly aggressive behaviour during the introductions. Investigation \nof the juvenile included sniffing, grooming and following within a distance of 1cm \n(Thor & Holloway 1982), and mild aggression consisted of rolling\/standing over the \njuvenile, and\/or pushing it away. Any overtly aggressive behaviour, such as biting, \nresulted in the session being abandoned immediately. We recorded these categories of \nobservations continuously throughout the experiment, collecting them using a hand \nheld event recorder (Psion Organiser II) with Noldus Observer software, and also by \nvideo camera. \n140 \n142 \n144 \n146 \n148 \n150 \n152 \n154 \n156 \n158 \n160 \n162 \n \nWe used 8 of the juveniles as social stimuli in the pre-experimental training, \nand these individuals were not used again. The remaining 16 juveniles were used only \nin the actual experiment itself. Four of the adult rats were excluded from the \nexperiment owing to overt aggression during pre test training. We randomly divided \nthe remaining adults into three treatment groups (six sub treatment groups, see Table \n1), with 10 rats each in treatments D1 and D2, and 12 rats in treatment S1 (although \nseven were later excluded from the analysis: See Results). Four adults were tested per \nday for 8 days, with treatment order balanced over time. \n \n*Table One* \n \n 6\nThese different treatments allowed us to observe whether: (1) habituation \noccurs over the first three exposures to the same stimulus; (2) whether there was any \ndifference in the amounts of behaviour displayed by the rats in those treatments with \nexperience, compared with those without; (3) whether the behaviour of the rats \nchanged in those treatments that changed context for the fourth \u2018test\u2019 exposure; and if \nso, (4) whether previous experience of both contexts affected this result. \n164 \n166 \n168 \n170 \n172 \n174 \n176 \n178 \n180 \n182 \n184 \n186 \n188 \n \nA frequent criticism of context experiments is that, depending on the \nparticular results, the chosen contexts are either insufficiently distinguishable or so \ndifferent that they interfere with the subjects\u2019 ability to carry out the learning task. For \nthis experiment the two different contextual environments, context A (white) and \ncontext B (black), were designed to take into account the potential confounding \neffects that any physical modifications, such as differences in overall surface area, \nmight have on subject behaviour (see Table 2). \n \n*Table Two* \n \nRats in treatment D2, which required experience of both contexts before the \nfirst exposure to a juvenile, were given a total of 80-min experience of both contexts. \nThis involved a 20-min session in both contexts every day for 4 days, with the final \nsession of context familiarization being completed 24 h before the first exposure of \nthe experiment itself.  \n \nAll exposures of the juvenile to the adult rat lasted for 5 min, with both the \njuvenile and the adult removed to their home cages during the 15-min intervals. We \n 7\ncleaned both contexts with a mild disinfectant before each encounter to limit the \neffect of olfactory cues. All the rats had been given previous experience of handling \nto reduce any possible effects on behaviour. \n190 \n192 \n194 \n196 \n198 \n200 \n202 \n204 \n206 \n208 \n210 \n212 \n \nEthical Note \n \nAlthough this study was not designed to promote aggression between animals, \nthere was a risk of aggression occurring in the social recognition test. To minimize \nthis risk, juveniles were used as stimuli because they elicit little or no aggressive \nbehaviour from adult rats (Thor 1979). Although juveniles can be intimidated by \nadults, physical injury is rare (Lore & Flannelly 1977). At no point in this study was \ninjury caused by mild aggression. If there was any overt aggression we stopped the \nencounter immediately, and separated the individuals before any injury could occur. \nThose juveniles who had experienced overt aggression appeared to show no \nsubsequent long term effects, with normal behaviour and food\/water consumption \nobserved.  \n \nThe rats were individually housed to prevent the formation of group odours \n(e.g. Barnett 1963) and to try to standardize pre experimental experience. All the rats \nwere therefore individually housed for 1 week prior to the start of the experiment to \nallow familiarization, and they remained individually housed for the duration of the \nexperiment. Research has indicated that social isolation can reduce social tolerance \n(Brain et al. 1980; Niesink & Van Ree 1982), but this effect can be ameliorated by \nallowing some degree of contact with neighbouring rats (Hurst et al. 1997), and this \nwas the case for these experiments in which some olfactory and visual contact was \n 8\nalways possible between neighbouring cages, in addition to interactions during test \nsessions. A researcher was always present during the direct introduction of one rat to \nanother so that any overtly aggressive encounters could be terminated immediately. \nInitial pre test \u2018training\u2019 also provided the opportunity to remove any overtly \naggressive rats from the experiment. \n214 \n216 \n218 \n220 \n222 \n224 \n226 \n228 \n230 \n232 \n234 \n236 \n238 \n \nRESULTS \n \nAll the subjects in treatment D1 (N=10 tested, N=10 analysed) successfully completed \nthe four separate exposures, and in treatment S1 only two subjects were removed from \nthe experiment because of aggression (N=12 tested, N=10 analysed). For treatment D2 \n(N=10 tested, N=5 analysed), in which the rats had undergone familiarization training \nin both contexts prior to testing, five rats were overtly aggressive and the encounters \nwere abandoned. Thus of 32 rats tested, the data from 25 were analysed. The data \nconsisted of the total duration (s) of investigation and mild aggression directed \ntowards the juveniles by the adult subjects, recorded during each of the 5-min \nexposures. Data from the different contexts were analysed together for each treatment, \nand the effects of context taken into account. The statistical package used was \nMinitab (version 11). \n \nWe compared the three treatments for differences in the total amount of \ninvestigative and mildly aggressive behaviour exhibited during the first exposure. The \nmild aggression data were transformed logarithmically to meet requirements for \nnormality and homogeneity of variance. Analysis of investigation was performed on \nthe raw data. For both investigative behaviour (one-way ANOVA: F2,22=9.47, \n 9\nP=0.001) and mild aggression (F2,22=5.45, P<0.05) there was a significant effect of \ntreatment. A Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparison revealed that this difference between \ntreatments was due to rats in treatment D2 showing more investigation (T=12.3, \nP=0.05) and mild aggression (T=0.25 (transformed), P=0.05) than those in the other \ntreatments. \n240 \n242 \n244 \n246 \n248 \n250 \n252 \n254 \n256 \n258 \n260 \n262 \n \nTo determine whether habituation to the introduction of the juvenile stimulus \nhad occurred, we compared the duration of behaviour in the initial three exposures in \nthe three treatments. The problems with aggression in treatment D2 meant that there \nwere insufficient data to include context into the analysis. For this reason, we \nanalysed treatment D2 separately using a balanced ANOVA for repeated measures, \nwith only exposure (1-3) as a factor. For both investigation and mild aggression we \nanalysed the raw data. This analysis revealed a significant reduction in investigation \n(F2,8=13.28, P<0.01) over the three exposures, but no significant change in mild \naggression (see Fig. 1). Post hoc analysis (Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparison) of this result \nrevealed that, although the treatment means for investigation decreased across \nexposures one, two and three (means: 94; 55; 47.2 respectively), only the decreases \nbetween exposures one and two, and exposures one and three were significant \n(T=27.8, P=0.05). \n \nTreatments S1 and D1 were analysed using a balanced ANOVA for repeated \nmeasures (N=20): with treatment (S1, D1) and context (A, B) as between factors, and \nexposure (1-3) as the within factor. The mild aggression data were transformed \nlogarithmically, with analysis of investigation performed on the raw data. No \nsignificant difference was found between treatments S1 and D1 for either \n 10\ninvestigation or mild aggression, and there was also no significant interaction between \nthe factors, but there was a significant effect of exposure on both investigation \n(F\n264 \n266 \n268 \n270 \n272 \n274 \n276 \n278 \n280 \n282 \n284 \n286 \n288 \n2,32=6.3, P<0.01) and mild aggression (F2,32=22.13, P<0.001; see Fig. 1). No \ndifferences in either investigation or mild aggression were observed between context \nA and context B. Post hoc analysis (Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparison) of the observed \nbehavioural changes revealed that, although the means for investigation of the \ncombined treatments (S1& D1) decreased across exposures one, two and three \n(means: 56.6; 50.2; 41.95 respectively), only the decrease from exposure one to three \nwas significant (T=10, P=0.05). For mild aggression (means (transformed): 0.25; 0.7; \n0.8 respectively), there was a significant increase from exposure one to two, and from \nexposures one to three (T=0.21, P=0.05). \n \n*Figure One* \n \nFinally, we investigated whether there was any change in behaviour between \nthe third exposure and the fourth \u2018test\u2019 exposure. This would reveal whether or not \nrats in treatments D1 and D2, in which the context had been switched for the fourth \nexposure, showed evidence of the dishabituation which would indicate a failure to \nrecognize the familiar conspecific in a different context. The data failed to attain the \nrequirements of normality and homogeneity of variance after transformation, and \nwere therefore analysed using the non parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (two \ntailed). No significant changes in either investigation or mildly aggressive behaviour \nwere observed for treatments S1 and D2 between the third and fourth exposures. \nHowever, treatment D1 showed significant reductions in the amount of both \ninvestigation (T=47, N=10, P<0.05) and mild aggression (T=42.5, N=9, P<0.05) \n 11\nelicited by the juvenile stimuli between the third and the fourth \u2018test\u2019 exposure (Fig \n1.). 290 \n292 \n294 \n296 \n298 \n300 \n302 \n304 \n306 \n308 \n310 \n312 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nHabituation, in terms of declining amounts of investigation, occurred over three \nseparate encounters with the same individual, despite the increasing familiarity with \nan initially novel environment. This habituation is interpreted as resulting from the \nrecognition of the same conspecific (Thor & Holloway 1982). In direct contrast to this \ndecline was an increase in mild aggression over the three exposures. For the fourth \n\u2018test\u2019 exposure there was no change in the amount of either investigation or mild \naggression directed towards the juvenile by the rats in treatment S1, which had not \nundergone a change in context. This suggests continued recognition of the stimulus \njuvenile, i.e. no dishabituation was observed, and that after three exposures the adult \nrats may have already attained a \u2018baseline\u2019 level of behaviour, with no further \nreduction in investigation, or increase in mild aggression, occurring on the subsequent \nfourth exposure. For treatment D1, in which the rats were switched to novel contexts \nfor the final exposure, a significant drop in both investigation and mildly aggressive \nbehaviour was observed. This suggests that the change of context has not interfered \nwith the memory of the adult rat, as this would have resulted in an increase in \ninvestigation and a decline in mild aggression. This decrease in investigation could \ntherefore be interpreted as further habituation towards the juvenile. But, the fact that \nthere was also a significant reduction in mild aggression, which would be expected to \nrise as the juvenile becomes increasingly familiar, suggests that it is not just further \nrecognition of the conspecific that is affecting the amount of behaviour directed \n 12\ntowards the juvenile. This is confirmed by comparing treatment D1 with treatment S1, \nwhich showed no further reduction in investigation to the juvenile stimuli after the \nthree initial exposures. \n314 \n316 \n318 \n320 \n322 \n324 \n326 \n328 \n330 \n332 \n334 \n336 \n338 \n \nThe results from treatment D2, those rats with experience of both contexts, \nreveal that it was the effect of context novelty that influenced the behaviour of the rats \nin treatment D1. Thus, if the rat was switched to a familiar context (D2), then the \nchange in context had no effect on behaviour, i.e. it had the same effect as if context \nhad not been changed (treatment S1). This implies continued recognition of the \nconspecific in a different context and suggests that environmental context, in this \nexperiment, had little influence on short-term social memory in adult male laboratory \nrats, as long as the contexts were familiar. Because the results suggest that the novelty \nof the test situation had such a marked effect on behaviour, this emphasizes the \nimportance of disentangling the effect of novelty from that of context per se. Analysis \nof the first exposure to the juvenile social stimulus provides further evidence of the \ninfluence of context novelty on behaviour. The rats in the treatment D2, who had been \nprovided with previous experience of both the different environmental contexts, \ndisplayed more investigation and mild aggression than those rats to whom the \ncontexts were novel. It could be that novelty has a suppressive effect on general \nbehaviour, resulting in lower levels of all categories of observed behaviour. But it \nmight also be that the increased time spent exploring a novel environment simply \nresults in less time available for interaction with the juvenile. \n \nThese results confirm work by Hall & Channell (1985) and Honey et al. \n(1992). Honey et al. (1992) found that although consumption of a novel flavour by \n 13\nrats increased in one context and then fell when the context was changed, this \ndishabituation of a neophobic response only occurred if the context was novel. When \nthe second context was familiar, the context change had no effect on the level of \nconsumption of the flavour by the rats. The assertion that unlike other types of \nlearning, such as classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and latent inhibition, \nhabituation does not appear to show context specificity (e.g. Hall & Channell 1985; \nHall & Honey 1989; Honey et al. 1992) is therefore also found to be true for the \nsocial recognition of conspecifics, as determined by observed levels of investigation. \n340 \n342 \n344 \n346 \n348 \n350 \n352 \n354 \n356 \n358 \n360 \n362 \n \nIt could be argued that the apparent failure of memory to be affected by the \nchange in context was actually because the two contexts were insufficiently \ndistinguishable (e.g. Hall & Honey 1989; Gordon & Klein 1994). However, the fact \nthat behaviour was significantly affected by the context change when the context was \nnovel (treatment D1) argues against this. The contexts must have been sufficiently \ndifferent to allow recognition of the new surroundings. Another problem with context \nbased experiments is the risk of \u2018generalization decrement\u2019 (e.g. Lovibond et al 1984). \nThis occurs when the two different contexts allow contrasting levels of stimulus \nrecognition. If this discrepancy results in a different response rate between the two \ncontexts, then the results could be misinterpreted as being caused by context \nspecificity. We did not observe any difference in behaviour between context A and \ncontext B. There was therefore no one context in which interaction with the juvenile \nwas more frequent, implying that the juvenile was no more difficult to locate in one \ncontext than in the other. \n \n 14\nThe rats in treatment D2, which had been given familiarization training in the \ntwo different environmental contexts before exposure to the juveniles, were \nunexpectedly aggressive. This may have implications for animal welfare if experience \nof a context prior to the mixing of unfamiliar animals results in an increase in \nobserved aggression. A possible explanation for this aggression is that because the \nrats in treatment D2 were familiar with the contexts, more of their behaviour could be \ndirected towards the juvenile than into exploration of a novel environment. Increased \nfamiliarity with the contexts could also result in territory formation of some kind. Yet \nresearch using the social recognition test (e.g. Perio et al. 1989), involving the direct \nintroduction of a juvenile into the home cage of an adult, has reported far lower levels \nof aggression than observed in this experiment. The finding that environmental \ncontext does not appear to influence social recognition, at least in the short term, \nsuggests that mixing previously familiar animals in a novel context may not disrupt \nrecognition. If so, this might help decrease the aggression and related animal welfare \nproblems that sometimes arise when previously familiar animals are reunited (e.g. \nEwbank & Meese 1971), and that may be caused by a failure of recognition. \n364 \n366 \n368 \n370 \n372 \n374 \n376 \n378 \n380 \n382 \n384 \n386 \n \nTo conclude, we have shown that social recognition, in terms of the declining \ninvestigation of a familiar conspecific, does not appear to show context specificity \nprovided that the subject animal is familiar with the context to which it is transferred. \nMore research, however, needs to be undertaken to allow further definition of the role \nthat contextual cues might play in social recognition and memory in non human \nanimals, particularly when this involves long-term memory. \n \n 15\nAcknowledgments \n 388 \n390 \n392 \n394 \nThis research was supported by a University of Bristol Postgraduate Scholarship.
