In a four-generation family\nof English descent, we mapped dominant congenital posterior polar cataract to chromosome 11q22-q22.3. The\nmaximum LOD score, 3.92 at recombination fraction 0, was obtained for marker D11S898, near the gene that\nencodes crystallin alpha-B protein (CRYAB). By sequencing the coding regions of CRYAB, we found in exon 3 a\ndeletion mutation, 450delA, that is associated with cataract in this family. The mutation resulted in a frameshift\nin codon 150 and produced an aberrant protein consisting of 184 residues. This is the first report of a mutation,\nin this gene, resulting in isolated congenital cataract.\nInherited cataract accounts for up to half of all congen-\nital cataract, and the most common mode of inheritance\nis autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC). Au-\ntosomal recessive and X-linked forms are also seen but\nare uncommon. Inherited cataract is clinically hetero-\ngeneous, and, thus far, 14 distinct loci in humans have\nbeen identified, for 11 phenotypically distinct forms of\nADCC (Ionides et al. 1999; Francis et al. 2000).\nCataract mutations have been found in genes encod-\ning lens connexins on 1q (Shiels et al. 1998) and 13q\n(Mackay et al. 1999), aquaporin 0 on 12q (Berry et al.\n2000), cytoskeletal protein CP49 on 3q (Jakobs et al.\n2000), and lens-developmental protein PITX3 on 10q\n(Semina et al. 1998). Mutations in five different crys-\ntallin genes that encode 190% of lens cytoplasmic pro-\nteins have been identified as a cause of dominant disease;\nthese genes include CRYAA (Litt et al. 1998; Pras et al.\n2000), CRYBA (Kannabiran et al. 1998), CRYBB (Litt\net al. 1997), CRYGC (He\u00b4on et al. 1999), and CRYGD\n(He\u00b4on et al. 1998). Furthermore, mutations in CRYAB\nReceived July 9, 2001; accepted for publication August 31, 2001;\nelectronically published September 27, 2001.\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Dr. S. S.

Dominantly inherited\nposterior polar cataract has been linked to the haptoglo-\nbin locus on 16q (Richards et al. 1984), as has the dom-\ninant Marner congenital cataract (Marner et al. 1989).\nBoth are described as progressive, but, in the Marner cat-\naract, the opacities initiate in the nucleus rather than at\nthe posterior pole of the lens, suggesting either allelic het-\nerogeneity or that two distinct cataract genes exist at the\n16q locus.\nA four-generation family of English descent with au-\ntosomal dominant posterior polar cataract underwent a\nfull ophthalmological examination. The opacity (fig. 1),\nwhich was bilateral in all cases, consisted of a single\nwell-defined plaque that was confined to the posterior\npole of the lens and that was 0.5\u20133 mm in diameter.\nHospital records indicated that usually the opacity either\n1142 Am. J. Hum. Genet. 69:1141\u20131145, 2001\nFigure 1 Direct illumination (A) and retroillumination (B) of\nposterior polar cataract observed in the 11-year-old boy (V:1) in the\nfamily with CPP2.\nwas present at birth or developed during the first few\nmonths of life but did not progress, with age, to other\nregions of the lens. There was no evidence of posterior\nlenticonus or high myopia, and there was no family his-\ntory of other ocular or systemic abnormalities.\nLinkage analysis was performed in this family, and,\nafter the exclusion of a number of candidate loci for\ncataract, we obtained a positive two-point LOD score\n(3.92 at recombination fraction 0) for the marker\nD11S898, flanked by D11S4176 and D11S908, on chro-\nmosome 11q21.2-q22.3, encompassing the CRYAB lo-\ncus. CRYAB encodes aB-crystallin (CRYAB [MIM\n123590]), a member of the small heat-shock protein\n(sHSP) family of molecular chaperones (de Jong et al.\n1998). CRYAB comprises three exons and encodes a\nprotein of 175 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis\nof the CRYAB gene revealed, in exon 3, a deletion mu-\ntation, 450delA, that cosegregated with disease in the\nfamily (fig. 2). It resulted in a frameshift in codon 150\nand produced an aberrant protein consisting of 184 res-\nidues (fig. 3). The mutation was not found in a panel of\n100 normal unrelated individuals, excluding the possi-\nbility that it is a rare polymorphism.\nIn the lens, aB-crystallin is found associated with aA-\ncrystallin, another sHSP, which shares 55% amino acid\nsequence identity with aB-crystallin. The two \u223c20-kD\nsubunits together form soluble complexes comprising\naA- and aB-polypeptides in a 3:1 ratio, with an average\nmolecular mass of 600\u2013800 kD. The a-crystallins are\nsome of the most abundant soluble proteins in the lens\nand, along with the other lens crystallins, play an im-\nportant role in establishing and maintaining the optical\nproperties of the lens (Delaye and Tardieu 1983). Like\nother sHSPs, aA- and aB-polypeptides can act as mo-\nlecular chaperones in vitro, preventing protein aggre-\ngation induced by heat and other stresses (Horwitz\n1992).\nA missense mutation, R120G, in CRYAB has already\nbeen reported to cause desmin-related myopathy and\ncataract. The mutation reported here is the first of its\nkind that has been shown to cause isolated congenital\ncataract. The effect of the mutation is the production of\nan aberrant protein of 184 residues with 35 novel amino\nacids at the C-terminus, starting at codon 154 of the\nprotein, replacing several highly conserved residues (fig.\n4). This may affect functionally important posttransla-\ntional modification reactions and may cause aberrant\nfolding of the protein. It is known that both aA- and\naB-crystallins undergo posttranslational modifications,\nincluding truncation of both the N terminus and the C\nterminus, deamidation, racemization, phosphorylation,\nmethionine oxidation, glycation, disulfide formation,\naddition of O-GlcNAc, and the addition of 72mass units\nto the C-terminal lysine of B-crystallin (Chiesa et al.\n1987; de Jong et al. 1988; Roquemore et al. 1992; Smith\net al. 1992; Groenen et al. 1994; Lin et al. 1997). Some\nof these activities, such as phosphorylation and specific\ncleavage, may be functionally important; others are\nlikely the result of aging and detrimental stresses. As\nwith modifications related to aging and stresses, the de-\nletion mutation is also likely to alter the protein con-\nformation, which, in turn, could alter the aggregate size\nand\/or the function of a-crystallin in the cell. If there is\naberrant aggregation of mutant protein, it may cause\nlight-scattering and cataract and would explain the con-\ngenital phenotype of the mutation.\nThe mutation, which affects the C-terminal\u2013extension\nregion of the protein, is also likely to affect the chaper-\none function of aB-crystallin. Both aA- and aB-crystallin\nhave polar, flexible C-terminal extensions that are thought\nto contribute to the solubility of these crystallins and that\nhave been implicated in the chaperone-like activity of\nthese crystallins (Carver and Lindner 1998). Substitution\nof Lys174\u2013Lys175 of aB-crystallin by Leu-Leu signifi-\ncantly diminished chaperone-like activity; however, re-\nFigure 2 Family with CPP2. Square symbols denote males; circles denote females; affected individuals are denoted by black symbols. Autosomal dominant inheritance is suggested both by the\npresence of affected males and females in each generation and by male-to-male transmission.\n1144 Am. J. Hum. Genet. 69:1141\u20131145, 2001\nFigure 3 Sequence analysis of CRYAB in an unaffected individ-\nual (A) and an affected individual (B), both from the family with CPP2.\nFigure 4 Protein alignment depicting similarity of human aB- and aA-crystallin with those of mouse, cow, rabbit, and chicken. Human\naB-crystallin shows the highest homology, over its entire length, to aB-crystallins of rabbit, cow, mouse, and chicken, with identity scores of\n98%, 97%, 97%, and 76%, respectively. Human aB-crystallin has 55% amino acid identity with aA-crystallin of human and of cow. Amino\nacids that exhibit complete identity across species are boxed. The aberrant protein produced as a result of the deletion mutation, 450delA, is\nshown with its 35 novel residues (blue) after the 149th residue of the wild- type aB-crystallin (arrow). The amino acid residue mutated (R120G\n[red]) in desmin-related myopathy is also shown.\nmoval of the last five residues had little effect on chap-\nerone-like activity (Plater et al. 1996). Likewise, in\naA-crystallin, the introduction of tryptophan at the C\nterminus and removal of 17 C-terminal residues dimin-\nished chaperone-like activity (Takemoto 1994; Andley et\nal. 1996). The deleted 17 C-terminal residues in aA-crys-\ntallin include residues 156\u2013167, which are highly con-\nserved between aA- and aB-crystallins, a result that is\nsuggestive of common functionality in chaperone-like ac-\ntivity (fig. 4). Since the 450delA mutation in CRYAB also\nleads to the replacement of these residues by novel resi-\ndues, it is very likely to compromise the chaperone-like\nactivity of aB-crystallin.\nIn conclusion, we have identified, in aB-crystallin, a\nnovel mutation causing posterior polar cataract. We\nspeculate that the cataract in this family may result from\nan increased tendency of the mutant polypeptide to ag-\ngregate and\/or from loss of chaperone-like activity. This\nmutation may help delineate the functional domains of\naB-crystallins, which are important both as structural\nproteins contributing to the refractive index of the lens\nand for their protective role as molecular chaperones\nsuppressing aggregation of denatured proteins. Further-\nmore, biophysical studies of the mutant aB-crystallin\nmay elucidate the mechanism of cataract formation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by The Wellcome Trust project\ngrant 063969\/Z\/01.
