Scope: popular survey. Level: general reader.\nHow can one make science interesting for non-scientists and, even more important, for\nyoung potential scientists? At a time of disappointing science enrolments in universities,\nwhen science often seems to be misunderstood and generally under-appreciated by jour-\nnalists and opinion-formers in the press and other mass media, and when much of the\nphysics teaching in our schools is having to be carried out by non-physicists, the question\nis of crucial importance.\nOne answer is to try to \u201cwow\u201d the audience by descriptions of the counter-intuitive\neffects and strange phenomena observed in, and predicted by, modern physics \u2013 quantum\nentanglement, black holes, wormholes in space-time, cosmic strings, and so on. A well-\nknown popular science magazine that formerly provided clearly-written factual articles\nexplaining how things work, is now largely given over to material of this kind. The\ndifficulty of this approach \u2013 apart from the often speculative character of the subject\nmatter and the tedium involved in the endless repetition of the same themes in slightly\ndifferent guises \u2013 is that these topics are totally unreal to most of the readers. There is\nno way they can set them in context, and they lack the basic scientific background to\nhave any intuitive gut-feeling for the significance of what is being presented. They might\nas well be reading fairy stories, or fantasy novels, because of the utter remoteness of the\nmaterial from everyday experience. It may provide a form of light entertainment, but it\nis unlikely to inspire future scientists. Nor does it give the general public much idea of\nwhat science is about or of what scientists actually do.\nAdam Hart-Davis adopts a totally different approach. He has produced a popular\nscience book that concentrates on observable phenomena, many of which will be familiar\nto readers from within their own experience. It takes the form of 101 questions and\nanswers, divided into sections covering air, earth, water, fire (i.e. the ancient \u201celements\u201d)\nas well as light, ice and rain, mathematics, technology, plants, animals and health. Many\nof the questions are ones that an inquisitive child might ask, for example: What is the\ngreenhouse effect? How old is the Earth? How are rocks made? How do water drops\nbounce? Why is a shower warmer in the middle? Why does a match catch fire? What\nare firework sparks? Why is the sky blue? How do TV programmes travel down a cable?\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 47, 238 (2006).\nWhy does ice cool your drink? Why do some icicles have bubbles in the middle? Why\ndon\u2019t knots come undone? How do radar guns work? How do nettles sting? What\u2019s the\noldest thing alive? Could dinosaurs swim? How do diseases spread? What happens in a\ncardiac arrest? And many, many others. The answer to each question is given across two\npages: one page of text and one with an interesting image or picture in full colour. The\nwords are carefully chosen, easy to read and understand, devoid of jargon, and provide\na huge amount of information. Sometimes they diverge interestingly away from a strict\nanswer to the question asked. Additional asides, placed in \u201cDid you know?\u201d boxes, are\noften intriguing.\nThe book is attractively produced in hardback with high quality paper and graphics.\nDespite the huge scope of the work, the bits I know something about are accurate and\nwell-described \u2013 and I note from the Acknowledgements that the author had taken the\ncare to have parts of the text checked by an assortment of distinguished experts. There\nis an excellent index. Why Does a Ball Bounce will make an ideal present for a bright\nchild, with much material to inform as well as to stimulate the scientific imagination.\nAdult non-scientists will find it equally entertaining and there is not the slightest trace\nof condescension in the exposition. Above all, the book is fun to read. I suspect it may\nin practice do as much to help draw schoolchildren into science as any number of worthy\ngovernment initiatives.\nPeter V. E.
