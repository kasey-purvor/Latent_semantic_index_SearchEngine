Lanham-New1\n1University of Surrey, Guildford, UK and 2Guildford Nuffield Hospital, Guildford, UK\nThe principal objectives of the D-FINES study are to compare vitamin D status, food intake, bone health indices and sunlight exposure in\nCaucasian and Asian women living in Southern England. It is known that in women both muscle and fat mass influence whole-body\nBMD(1) and the aim of the present subsidiary study was to examine for differences in body composition and compare the relationship\nbetween body composition components in Asian and Caucasian women.\nMeasurements of body composition were undertaken in seventy-two Asian and 227 Caucasian women in autumn\u2013winter (A\/W) with a\nfollow-up assessment in spring\u2013summer (S\/S) by dual X-ray absorptiometry (QDR-4500; Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). Measures of\nwhole-body bone mineral density (BMD), whole-body bone mineral content (BMC), fat mass and lean mass were undertaken. Regional as\nwell as total measurements were available.\nCaucasians Asians Significance of difference\nbetween groups: PMean SD Mean SD\nAge (years) 51.2 13.7 50.5 1.1 0.3\nWeight (kg) 69.0 12.3 68.0 14.1 0.5\nHeight (m) 1.63 0.06 1.56 0.05 <0.0001\nBMI (kg\/m2) 26.0 4.79 27.9 5.95 0.01\nCaucasians Asian\nA\/W S\/S A\/W S\/S\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nWhole-body\nBMD (g\/cm3)\n1.13 0.10 1.12*** 0.10 1.10\u2020 0.09 1.09* 0.10\nWhole-body\nBMC (kg)\n2.20 0.31 2.19** 0.31 2.01\u2020\u2020\u2020 0.26 2.00 0.28\nTotal fat (kg) 24.5 8.23 24.9* 8.34 26.5 8.91 27.4 9.48\nTotal lean (kg) 40.8 4.83 41.0 5.50 37.8\u2020\u2020 5.26 38.5 5.14\nValues were significantly different from those for A\/W within ethnic group: *P = 0.04, **P = 0.002, ***P = 0.0001. Values were\nsignificantly different from those for A\/W for Caucasians: \u2020P = 0.032, \u2020\u2020P = 0.056, \u2020\u2020\u2020P = 0.008.\nAs shown in the Table, the age and weight of the two groups of women were not significantly different (P>0.05). However, height was\nlower and BMI significantly higher in the Asian cohort. Whole-body BMD, whole-body BMC, lean mass and fat mass were significantly\ndifferent between the two groups; fat mass was greater in Asian women, whereas the other three variables were lower. The difference in\nfat mass was not retained when adjusting for age. The difference in BMC remained even when measurements were standardised for height\n(and age).\nWhole-body BMD and whole-body BMC decreased over winter in Caucasian women, whereas fat mass increased. Lean mass remained\nstable. In Asian women only whole-body BMD showed a significant decrease. BMD and BMC were positively correlated with total lean\ntissue in Asian (R 0.3; P = 0.01 and R 0.5; P = 0.0001 respectively) and Caucasian women (R 0.4 and R 0.6; P = 0.0001). In Asian women a\ngreater baseline fat mass correlated with a positive change in whole-body BMD over winter (R 0.03; P = 0.035). This relationship was not\nseen in Caucasian women.\nBody size is known to account for much of the difference in bone density between Asian and Caucasian women; however, in the\npresent study the differences were maintained when standardising for height and also age. A meta-analysis of exercise programmes has\nindicated that exercisers can gain 1% BMD over 1 year(2). Thus, losses of a similar magnitude in just a few months perhaps put the\nchanges measured in the current study into context. The potential protective effect of fat mass against bone loss in Asian women will be\ninvestigated further by examining the regional body composition differences between these two cohorts.\nThis work was funded by the Food Standard Agency (N05064).
