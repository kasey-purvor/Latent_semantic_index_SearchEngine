Many explained away their former allegiance by depicting themselves\nas having arrived on the wrong side by accident, stratagem, or necessity. Choices of\nallegiance during the civil wars were not simply snap decisions of the summer of\n1642. Many who took sides, reluctantly or not, subjected themselves to years of\nsoul-searching thereafter. An examination of how gentry defectors fashioned their\nchange in allegiance takes us to the heart of elite notions of loyalty, honor, and\npolitical identity. It also builds upon the growing interdisciplinary engagement with\nthe self-fashioning of early modern elites. Literary scholars have pointed to an in-\ncreased self-consciousness in contemporaries\u2019 letters and essays, while the urge to-\nward autobiographical writing was often triggered by the traumatic experience of\nchanging sides.1 Such self-reflection \u201ccertainly served some individuals as a means\nof easing tensions in their lives,\u201d and for some it became a balm for injured honor.2\nThe problem of choosing sides has long defied precise categorization, but his-\ntorians now increasingly recognize that allegiance was not a fixed, unchanging\nmatter but rather one that shifted and fluctuated.

In\n1994 Mark Stoyle argued that defectors met with derision, which suggests that\n\u201cturncoats were the exception rather than the rule.\u201d5 While this is true in many\ncases, David Smith and Jason McElligott\u2019s recent collection on royalism has sug-\ngested that shifts in allegiance were more common than scholars realized. My\nresearch on Yorkshire, a county where turncoats were particularly prevalent, sup-\nports this assertion.6 Barbara Donagan has argued that varieties of royalism were\nso wide-ranging that they presented a \u201crainbow coalition\u201d and that there was\nmuch common ground between moderates on both sides.7 The parliamentarian\ncoalition was equally broad, and many felt closer to moderates among the enemy\nthan the most zealous on their own side. Army officers on opposing sides main-\ntained amicable correspondence, particularly as many were friends before the war.\nMany gentry on both sides also shared a political culture that was equally distrustful\nof popular insurgency and the royal excesses of the 1630s. Alongside a bipartisan\ncode of soldierly honor and professional conduct, such shared ground, Donagan\nargues, \u201cameliorated relations between enemies.\u201d8 In an important recent mono-\ngraph, Donagan has pointed out how this common gentry culture facilitated side-\nchanging.9\nOlder, traditional conceptions of honor stressed ancient lineage, blood, pedigree,\noutward display, and hunting. These ideas persisted alongside a more recent tra-\ndition that stressed virtue, education, sobriety, restraint, magistracy, godliness, and\npublic service.10 Yet these traditions were not mutually exclusive, and they were\noften blended or appropriated for different purposes and audiences. Richard Cust\nhas recently contended that, by the 1620s, Renaissance humanism, classical re-\npublicanism, and English Calvinism had blended to generate an image of the\nvirtuous, incorruptible \u201cpublic man.\u201d Drawing upon the writings of the Stoics,\nsuch as Plutarch, Seneca, and Cicero, this political culture stressed virtue and\nconstancy as paramount determinants of nobility.

Edward, earl of Clarendon, elu-\ncidated this by arguing that few turncoats prospered in their new allegiance: \u201cWe\nscarce find, in any story, a deserter of a trust or party he once adhered to, to be\nprosperous, or in any eminent estimation with those to whom he resorts . . .\nneither hath it been in the power or prerogative of any authority to preserve such\nmen from the reproach and jealousy and scandal that naturally attend upon any\ndefection.\u201d12 Penetrating how turncoats sought to circumvent such difficulties\nmight contribute much to the historiography on rhetoric, self-fashioning, and\nhonor among the notoriously status-obsessed English gentry.13\nThe archival sources for studying the self-representation of gentry turncoats are\nscattered but plentiful. Many wrote letters to justify their side-changing to friends\nand contemporaries or corresponded with enemy officers in attempts to coordinate\ndefections. Extensive legal notes survive from trials of recaptured turncoats, such\nas Sir John Hotham and Colonel John Morris, providing insights into how they\ndefended their actions.14 The Hotham papers are currently being edited for pub-\nlication and contain plentiful material relating to the trials of both father and son.\nParticularly rich sources are the memoirs of turncoats such as Sir Hugh Cholmley.15\nSeeking to defend reputations for posterity, the memoirists were prone to selective\nmemory as they set about constructing how they wished to be remembered by\nfamily and friends. There are also the several thousand cases dealt with by the\nCommittee for Compounding.16 This committee set composition fines for royalists\nto pay to free their estates from sequestration. Cases before this committee in-\ncluded parliamentarians ordered to pay fines for their former royalism. Their\npetitions provide a further source, once allowance is made for their shaping by\nlegal counsel and committee procedure. They naturally minimized the royalism\nof their earlier careers. For example, Thomas Simpson of Bishop Auckland pe-\ntitioned that he had spent over \u00a3400 in raising his troop for Parliament in 1644,\nbut he played down his earlier royalism as short-lived and forced on him for\nrefusing to pay royalist taxes. His conversion narrative recounted his escape from\nhanging by the royalists, and this was endorsed by his parish minister and the\n11 Richard Cust, \u201cThe \u2018Public Man\u2019 in Late Tudor and Early Stuart England,\u201d in The Politics\nof the Public Sphere in Early Modern England, ed.

It will go on to examine the significance of print culture in the repre-\nsentation of turncoats and then analyze in two case studies the self-fashioning of\nSir Hugh Cholmley and the Hothams, governors of Hull.\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nBefore the civil wars, most English notions of changing sides during wartime\nentailed changing one\u2019s religion. This view was nurtured by a popular and influential\nliterary genre of printed accounts that claimed to represent the confessions of former\nBritish Catholics who had converted to Protestantism.18 Robin Clifton has argued\nthat these tracts vulgarly pandered to Protestant prejudices about the superstitious\nnature of Catholicism and \u201cwere presented as lively and truthful accounts of the\nenemy camp written by men familiar with its workings.\u201d19 Subsequent propaganda\nnarratives of civil war turncoats built on this tradition, fulfilling a similar function\nby maligning the side they had deserted. Notions of side-changing were also in-\nformed by the realities of continental warfare. During the French Wars of Religion,\nCatholic aristocrats placed prices on the heads of their Protestant counterparts,\nthereby encouraging Protestant soldiers to change sides and murder their own com-\nmanders. The sieur de Maurevert, who shot Admiral Coligny in 1572, had changed\nsides three years earlier, shooting his Huguenot captain in the back as he did so.20\nChanging sides might entail abandoning Christianity entirely. Approximately eight\nthousand British captives were seized by Barbary corsairs in the early seventeenth\ncentury, and large numbers of them apostatized and defected to Islam.21 Anxieties\nwere voiced from the Privy Council to the theatre that Christians so enslaved\nwould turn \u201crenegado\u201d and become Muslims. Robert Daborne and Philip Mas-\nsinger wrote plays depicting such renegades as violently quarrelsome and treach-\n17 The case of Thomas Simpson of Newton Capp, Bishop Auckland, co.

The stereotype of the hard-\ndrinking, dueling, and swearing professional officer forged in Germany during the\nThirty Years War hardly inspired expectations of constancy.23 The multiple defec-\ntions of these professional officers, or \u201cswordsmen,\u201d soon after civil war broke out\ndid little to undermine the stereotype.

With a pen-\nchant for fighting duels and raping women, Fantom allegedly declared: \u201cI care\nnot for your Cause: I come to fight for your halfe-crowne, and your handsome\nwoemen: my father was a R. Catholiq; and so was my grandfather. I have fought\nfor the Christians against the Turkes; and for the Turkes against the Christians.\u201d26\nCivilians feared that such officers might import frightful continental practices into\nthe English civil wars. The words turncoat and renegado, with the latter also\nimplying apostasy, were in considerable use by the early seventeenth century, and\nboth carried deeply negative connotations. The former was employed in John\nFoxe\u2019s Acts and Monuments by 1570 and on the stage in Thomas Middleton\u2019s\nGame at Chess by 1624.27 The civil wars made these terms more widespread, and\ndefectors among the English gentry clearly did not wish to be associated with\nthem.\nGentry turncoats may have acted to protect themselves, family, and estates, as\nwell as to profit by victory, but most denied such self-interested motives. They faced\npopular suspicions that many soldiers sought to side with the strongest. For instance,\nin 1646, Welsh parliamentarians maintained that the royalist Colonel Howell Gwinne\nhad declared upon the king\u2019s surrender: \u201cHeigh God, heigh Devil, I will be for the\nstronger side.\u201d28 Such sentiments found frequent expression in newsbooks, the Per-\n22 Nabil I.

This article\nexplores the ways they sought to accomplish this, whether through appealing to\ncontemporaries in print or by penning their memoirs for posterity.\nThe early Stuart gentry self-consciously fashioned their public reputations, par-\nticularly through the manipulation of ritual, rhetoric, and print. They compared\npolitical activity to \u201cascending the stage\u201d and worried about humiliation in the\neyes of a \u201cnews-hungry public.\u201d30 The civil wars amplified these concerns. Facil-\nitated by a proliferation of cheap print, the cult of personality among rival com-\nmanders flourished, and officers on both sides became subjects of life narratives.31\nSide-changers were victimized by printed character assassinations, which utilized\nthe well-crafted insult typical of contemporary litigation over slander and defa-\nmation. Many gentlemen initiated prosecutions in the Court of Chivalry during\nthe 1630s, demanding reparation for insults that slighted their honor.32 Terms\nsuch as base, knave, rascal, lying, stinking, cheating, scurvy, beggarly, and unworthy\nfeatured in these insults. During the 1640s, a deserted side would inflict these\nsame insults upon its backsliders. Anxious to show that defectors did not prosper,\npropagandists sought to strip turncoat officers of their gentility. In extreme cases,\nthis degradation became physically enacted when turncoat officers were manacled\nand hanged like plebeians; the unfortunate Colonel John Morris complained in\n1649 that this \u201cshame and dishonour\u201d was more troublesome to him than losing\nhis life.33 As well as implying a forfeiture of gentle status, the term turncoat became\na powerful term of political abuse. In 1643 the Perfect Diurnall defamed the\nRecorder of Poole as \u201cturncoat Mr Constantine,\u201d while in 1647, John Lilburne\nwarned Sir Thomas Fairfax that he would not comply with Cromwell and Ireton\u2019s\n\u201cturncoat Lordly interest.\u201d34 The war also rendered the term more prevalent in\neveryday conversations and legal disputes. For example, Henry Cholmley, the\nconstable of Tunstall, North Yorkshire, was accused of berating his neighbors for\nsupporting parliament, \u201ccalling them Turn Coats, saying they were not worthy to\ncome into honest mens company.\u201d35\n29 BL, TT E256(12), A Perfect Diurnall of Some Passages in Parliament, 23\u201330 September (London,\n1644), 486.\n30 Richard Cust, \u201cWentworth\u2019s \u2018Change of Sides\u2019 in the 1620s,\u201d in The Political World of Thomas\nWentworth, Earl of Strafford, 1621\u20131641, ed.

When the earl of Holland defected to the king in August 1643, he\nrefused to apologize for his previous parliamentarianism or to admit any offense\nwhatsoever. This refusal proved a major obstacle to his integration into the royalist\ncause despite his armed attendance at the first battle of Newbury.36 In November\n1643, he returned to Parliament and published a tract to justify his return, in\nwhich he compared himself to rivers and streams: \u201cNaturally are they inclined to\nrevert, and to looke backe to their Channells, and long-kept course againe.\u201d37\nWhen he was executed on 9 March 1649, for a second bout of armed royalism,\nhe argued that he had always been faithful to Parliament, a remarkable claim for\na man who had deserted them twice. Yet, for Holland, it was essential to craft a\nself-narrative of constancy to protect not only his self-regard but also his posterity.\nHe argued that the cause, not he, had changed. He claimed, quite sincerely, that,\n\u201cI have never gone off from those Principles that ever I have professed.\u201d38 Indeed,\nby 1649 Holland could claim greater constancy to Parliament\u2019s war aims of 1642\nthan the regicides, whom the majority of parliamentarians considered had per-\nverted the cause. Holland constituted an extreme example of how this process left\nindividuals vulnerable to the slur of being turncoats. As the parliamentarian co-\nalition fractured in the later 1640s, there were many like him, left disenfranchised\nand unrepresented by a cause whose politics grew ever more radical.\nIn order to consolidate support in changing political circumstances, both sides\nresorted to political and religious oaths to bind supporters to them, minimize\nturncoating, and prevent backsliding. Yet the meanings of oaths of allegiance\nbecame more widely interpreted and contested, posing problems for those striving\nfor political constancy. Royalists held that the traditional oaths of supremacy and\nallegiance were adequate for their supporters, but occasionally royalist generals\nimposed additional oaths upon people to oppose Parliament.39 In Oxford, the\ncity\u2019s regiment swore an oath to defend the king.40 Parliamentarian propagandists\nvilified royalists for forcing oaths upon helpless prisoners, John Vicars blasting the\n\u201cOxonian Protestation or Covenant against the Parliament.\u201d41 However, the suc-\ncessive oaths Parliament imposed upon the people were much more far-reaching.\nEdward Vallance has argued that they met with equivocation in many quarters,\nnot through political hostility, but because people feared forswearing themselves\nin an uncertain future or contradicting previous oaths. The first of these, the\nProtestation of 1641, pledged to protect the king\u2019s person, the privilege of Par-\nliament, and the Protestant religion.

Despite making his peace with the king, Chudleigh\u2019s printed de-\nfense maintained that he had \u201cdone my utmost faithfully according to my Prot-\nestation.\u201d43 Parliament\u2019s second oath was the Vow and Covenant, administered\nfrom June 1643 in an attempt to isolate royalists and commit the people to war\nagainst the king. From October 1643, Parliament imposed a third oath, the Solemn\nLeague and Covenant, to pledge its supporters to a Scottish alliance and a Pres-\nbyterian church settlement. The earl of Holland took this Covenant as a means\nof reconciling himself with Parliament after returning from his first defection to\nthe royalists in November 1643.44 On 5 February 1644, an ordinance directed\nthat the Solemn League and Covenant should be taken by every adult male in\nEngland and Wales.45 Parish ministers were ordered to send lists of refusers to\nParliament, although the strength of enforcement in the localities was patchy.46 It\nwas also pressed on royalist prisoners of war and those compounding for their\nestates. During the first civil war, most gentry defections to the king took place\nbefore the Solemn League and Covenant was in place, but the minority of turncoats\nwho became royalists having previously taken the Covenant might face execution\nas oath-breakers.47 The parliamentary newsbook The Moderate declared, in August\n1648, that any royalist who had previously taken the Negative Oath or the Cov-\nenant could be executed without mercy.48 Parliament had put to death many\nrecaptured turncoats from 1643, but this declaration was a violent reaction against\nthe increasingly serious defections that threatened to reverse Parliament\u2019s victory\nin the first civil war.49 Recaptured turncoats, such as Colonels John Poyer and\n42 Edward Vallance, \u201cProtestation, Vow, Covenant and Engagement: Swearing Allegiance in the\nEnglish Civil War,\u201d Historical Research 75, no. 190 (November 2002): 408\u201311, 417\u201319.\n43 BL, TT E247(21): A Perfect Diurnall of the Passages in Parliament, 3\u201310 April (London,\n1643); BL, TT E37(20), A Declaration Published in the County of Devon by that Grand Ambo-\ndexter, Sir George Chudleigh Baronet (London, 1644), 3.\n44 Some royalists had wanted an oath of allegiance imposed upon Holland after his arrival at Oxford,\nand when he returned to parliament, Holland had to declare that he had taken no royalist oath: Macray,\nThe History of the Rebellion, 3:146\u201347; Parliamentary journal of Sir Simonds D\u2019Ewes, BL, Harl.

Parliamentarians were uncomfortably aware that the Covenant required\nits takers to preserve the king\u2019s person, a pledge which defectors in 1648 could\nforcefully argue that Parliament had broken. So, despite their contested nature,\nclaims to political constancy would be arbitrated by the victors of the second civil\nwar as factional politics at Westminster came to define and determine who would\nbe stigmatized as turncoats and oath-breakers.\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nThis article will now examine the self-representations of the professional army\nofficers who deserted Parliament for the king during the early stages of the first\ncivil war. Most of these officers claimed that they had never intended to participate\nin rebellion. Although this seems suggestive of royalist propaganda, it remains\npersuasive because, until September 1642, it was doubtful if civil war was possible\nowing to the king\u2019s failure to recruit an army capable of facing the earl of Essex.\nOfficers who had enlisted in Parliament\u2019s army for Ireland found themselves chan-\nneled into Essex\u2019s army, and their terms of service changed without consultation.\nThis prompted several high-profile incidents of turncoating, beginning with the\nspectacular defection of Sir Faithful Fortescue\u2019s troop to the royalists during the\nBattle of Edgehill. Raised in summer 1642, this troop was intended for Ireland,\nand Fortescue could reasonably argue that it had never been his intention to oppose\nthe king\u2019s person on an English battlefield. He became a committed royalist there-\nafter and fought at Worcester in 1651.51 Another defector from the army for Ireland\nbecame the civil wars\u2019 most notorious multiple turncoat. Sir John Urry, a Scotsman\nwith continental military experience, was often depicted as the classic example of\nthe professional whose own interests outweighed service to either side. His cornet\nadopted the motto of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan: \u201cNemo me impune la-\ncessit\u201d (No one attacks me with impunity).52 This motto suggests an aggressive\nattachment to his martial honor. Nevertheless, when Urry defected in June 1643,\nhe carefully \u201cprofessed repentance for having been in rebellion,\u201d probably through\nconcern that his low rank slighted his reputation. He was then \u201cmagnified and\nextolled\u201d at Oxford, where he was commissioned and knighted. Importantly, Urry\nsought to protect himself from charges of betraying trust by resigning his parlia-\nmentarian commission a month before he defected. He also claimed to have refused\nan oath not to enter royalist service.53 Although Urry\u2019s successful negotiation of\nhis defection owed something to professional codes of conduct, it was more firmly\n50 Ashton, Counter Revolution, 406, 421, 465\u201366.\n51 Basil Morgan, \u201cSir Faithful Fortescue (b. in or before 1581, d.1666),\u201d in The Oxford Dictionary of\nNational Biography (Oxford, 2004) (ODNB); Newman, The Old Service, 57\u201358, and Royalist Officers,\n142; Macray, The History of the Rebellion, 2:360, 363.\n52 Ian Gentles, \u201cThe Iconography of Revolution: England, 1642\u20131649,\u201d in Soldiers, Writers and States-\nmen of the English Revolution, ed.

Clarendon recalled that Chudleigh had originally offered his\nservices to the king in December 1642 but that he had been rebuffed because of\nhis parliamentarian family and his part in revealing the Army plot of 1641.56\nLondon propagandists praised Chudleigh\u2019s \u201cimmortal Fame,\u201d for \u201chis discreet\nand valient carriage\u201d against the Cornish, and he was appointed sergeant-major-\ngeneral to the earl of Stamford\u2019s parliamentarian army in the west.57 After a series\nof engagements, Chudleigh was eventually captured at the battle of Stratton on\n16 May 1643. The royalists maintained that he changed sides several days later,\nbut parliamentarians claimed that Chudleigh had defected during the battle itself.\nThis enabled Stamford to divert attention from his own ignominious flight to\nreproach Chudleigh\u2019s treachery for the defeat. Chudleigh\u2019s self-regard did not take\nkindly to such treatment; his military reputation had hitherto been promoted in\nprint by boastfully exaggerating his successes while blaming others for reverses.58\nHoping to utilize Chudleigh\u2019s example to provoke further defections, the royalist\npress at Oxford printed his self-defense. The tract blended Chudleigh\u2019s fiery in-\ndignation with personal attacks on Devon parliamentarians to fashion his defection\nas motivated entirely by conviction. Chudleigh maintained that his captors treated\nhim honorably and that their commanders persuaded him that the royalist cause\nwas just. He argued that his new Cornish gentry friends were more inclined to\npeace than those he termed \u201cthe factious Tumult of the Citty of Exeter,\u201d who\nmaintained their cause through abusing religion. He urged his former comrades\nto negotiate a treaty. Clearing himself of treachery, he maintained that he had led\nDevon\u2019s parliamentarians in good faith, declaring: \u201cTwas not without excessive\ncontinued paines, that I had put that Tumultuous body into a serviceable posture\nin the field.\u201d He claimed that, while he lay wounded at Stratton, other parlia-\nmentarian commanders \u201cthat I am never likely to meet with in the field\u201d fled to\nExeter \u201cto passe the time in making Aldermen, and women believe them valiant,\nwhiles all the world knows the contrary.\u201d59 Diverting attention from his own\ninconstancy, he contrasted himself with former colleagues, whom he depicted as\ncorrupted by urban and feminine influences and therefore incapable of masculine,\nmilitary honor.

By November, he had penned a self-defense \u201cto satisfy\nhis friends\u201d that was quoted approvingly by Mercurius Aulicus. The London press\nresponded in March 1644 by blasting his claim to constancy in a popular eight-\npage pamphlet, amusingly titled \u201cthe Grand Ambo-dexter.\u201d61\nThese officers who returned from Ireland to desert Parliament for the king\nstressed their military skill and personal worth, and they expressed an aggrieved\nsense of betrayal or injured honor. Sir Richard Grenville remains their most no-\ntorious exemplar. Having served against the Irish rebels, he returned in 1643 and\nbecame lieutenant-general to the parliamentarian Sir William Waller. He joined\nthe king at Oxford on 7 March 1644, with 36 troopers, a large consignment of\nsoldiers\u2019 pay, and the parliamentarian plans for the spring campaign. Grenville\u2019s\ntreachery was particularly flagrant because he had taken the Solemn League and\nCovenant and had reportedly pledged within the House of Commons that \u201che\nwould never take up Arms against, but for the Parliament, and die in the defence\nof them with his last drop of blood.\u201d62 In response, London\u2019s press termed him\n\u201cTurk,\u201d \u201cinfidel,\u201d \u201cJudas,\u201d and \u201cSkellum\u201d for years afterwards.63 A confounded\nparliament ordered proclamations against him to be nailed to gibbets at Palace\nYard and the Royal Exchange, leaving no doubt about his fate should he fall into\nparliamentary hands. Writing to Speaker Lenthall on 8 March, Grenville justified\nhimself in a mocking and self-congratulatory tone. He declared that Parliament\nhad slighted him by deliberately thwarting the settling of his legal affairs, accusing\nthem of \u201ca design to have a hold and engagement on me in a service I was so ill-\nsatisfied in.\u201d Then he argued that parliament\u2019s imposition of unlawful oaths, over-\nstepping precedents, and confiscation of delinquents\u2019 estates had driven him to\nthe king. If, as Clarendon maintained, Grenville later hinted that he planned this\ndefection before he left Ireland, Grenville\u2019s claim that his parliamentarianism was\na ruse to deceive the enemy was well calculated to mitigate his guilt and ingratiate\nhimself with his new friends.64 On arriving in Devon, his letter urging the garrison\nof Plymouth to surrender explained his defection further. It insisted that he had\nwanted to keep out of the war, initially refusing parliament\u2019s \u201cgreat tokens of favour\u201d\nto serve them. It argued that he had been provoked into turning on Parliament,\nand it then fell into customary royalist arguments that parliamentarians had used\nreligion as \u201cthe cloak of rebellion\u201d and that they were directed by \u201csectaries of\n60 Mary Wolffe, Gentry Leaders in Peace and War: The Gentry Governors of Devon in the Early\nSeventeenth Century (Exeter, 1997), 158\u201364.\n61 BL, TT E75(37), Mercurius Aulicus, 29 October to 4 November (Oxford, 1643), 625; BL,\nTT E37(20), A Declaration Published in the County of Devon by that Grand Ambo-dexter, Sir George\nChudleigh Baronet, 3\u20137.\n62 Keith Lindley and David Scott, eds., The Journal of Thomas Juxon, 1644\u20131647, Camden Society,\n5th ser., 13 (1999), 48; BL, TT E250(16), A Perfect Diurnall of Some Passages in Parliament, 25\nSeptember to 2 October (London, 1643), 88.\n63 The term skellum had been used by Ben Jonson in 1611 and signified a rascal, scamp, scoundrel,\nor villain: Simpson and Weiner, The Oxford English Dictionary, 15:590.\n64 Miller, Sir Richard Grenville, 67\u201370.\nchecked 12 \u0002 HOPPER\nThursday Dec 31 2009 09:46 AM JBS v49n2 85 BBS\ninfinite kinds which would not hear of a peace.\u201d Grenville reflected on having broken\nhis Covenant oath by enclosing a tract entitled \u201cThe Iniquitye of the Covenant,\u201d\nbut the parliamentarian governor ordered it to be burned in Plymouth marketplace\nby the common hangman.65\nThereafter, Grenville proved an energetic royalist commander, albeit with a\ntendency to inflame conflict within the royalist command. On 20 January 1646,\nhe was arrested for refusing a commission from the Prince of Wales, and within\na year he penned an immodest manuscript defense of his conduct that exaggerated\nhis successes while blaming others for royalist setbacks.66 Despite his previous\nallegiance, this defense boldly declared his \u201csirvisses and intention was ever found\nfaithfull to his mag[es]tie and to the contrary can noe man take him in any kind.\u201d67\nHe even complained to the prince\u2019s council that Lord Goring\u2019s men would rather\n\u201ctake to the enemyes party, then to bee Subiect to my course of discipline.\u201d68 He\npresented himself as the victim of conspiratorial lords on the prince\u2019s council and\na sufferer for unsullied loyalty. This was a very different image to his previous\nposturing as the champion of Cornish particularism in attempting to promote a\nseparate negotiated peace between Cornwall and Parliament.69\nGrenville penned another manuscript self-justification in January 1654, which\nagain avoided mentioning his parliamentarian service. By then, Grenville had ac-\ncused Clarendon of plotting with Cromwell, for which the exiled prince forbade\nGrenville from his presence. This affront robbed Grenville of the spiritual comforts\nof other exiled royalists, who at least enjoyed the consolation of reputations for\nconstancy and integrity. Grenville remonstrated that his loyalty was \u201csufficiently\ntried\u201d and that he was one of the crown\u2019s \u201cfaithfullest servants,\u201d adding: \u201cI pray\nGod it be not made a crime to be Loyall.\u201d He declared \u201call yt know me rightly,\nhave known experience of my impartiality in service of his matie.\u201d70 In further\nprotest, Grenville drafted an embittered manuscript autobiography that placed\nmilitary service and loyalty to the crown at the heart of his professed concept of\nhonor.71 It made the remarkable claim: \u201cMy former time spent hath binne as a\nSouldier, (as were all my Auncestors, since the Conquest of England, Anno 1066)\never constantly for services of the Crown of England.\u201d72 Espousing older, tradi-\ntional notions of honor, he held that his pedigree, blood, and martial valor were\n65 Journal of the civil war by John Syms, 18 March 1643\/4, BL, Add.

He recounted his military success against the Irish rebels in\n1642 and claimed to have been invited by letters to return to serve the king in\nEngland. He completely passed over his service under Waller and again failed to\nexplain how he joined the royalist cause. His final response was to adopt the tone\nof stoic forbearance and retirement that it was customary for the English gentry\nto employ during their moments of political failure.73 He wrote that he would\n\u201cmake my peace with god and man: and to finde a quiet dying place in my native\nland: and never againe touch with any kinde of worldly affaires.\u201d Yet his bitterness\noverwhelmed his attempt at forbearance. Intimating that it was now too late for\nhim to continue in royalist service, he echoed the earl of Strafford\u2019s reported\ndisillusion with the Stuarts, quoting Psalm 146, \u201cO put not your trust in Princes,\nnor in any Childe of man, for there is no helpe in him.\u201d74 Grenville\u2019s attachment\nto his lineage and martial honor left him ill-equipped to engage in a service suf-\nfering from contested command structures, imploding factional politics, and a\ncollapsing war effort. His language of loyalty and service scarcely suppressed his\nvitriol, providing a thin veil for his inconstancy and the conditional nature of his\nallegiance.\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nThis section examines the many ways in which print culture influenced the\nprocess of changing sides, making the meaning of defections increasingly public\nand contested. The proliferation of print in the 1640s provides a rich but prob-\nlematic source for the self-representation of turncoats. Printed propaganda fueled\nthe conflict and promoted infighting as both sides sought to capitalize on defec-\ntions in their favor and revile those who deserted them.75 Gentlemen remained\nfashionably disdainful of cheap print and newsbooks, yet many recognized the\nimportance of engaging with this powerful new arena for building and destroying\nreputations. Print increasingly shaped how notions of turncoating were con-\nstructed, while newsbooks\u2019 coverage of side-changers influenced the self-fashioning\nof turncoats and their expectations of future treatment. The press propagated much\nfictitious material in vilifying turncoats, turning individuals like Sir Richard Gren-\nville into celebrated hate-figures for popular consumption.76 This shift to a public\ndiscourse raises methodological problems, as printed narratives adopted a variety\nof different forms, from character assassinations to self-defenses. Some turncoats\naddressed their self-justifications for a gentry audience, while others produced\ncheaper pamphlets for a more popular audience. On occasion, the turncoat\u2019s new\nmasters might try to dictate what form these took or edit the text for polemical\npurposes, making it difficult to trace how far a turncoat\u2019s supposed self-narrative\nwas actually being composed by others.\n73 Ann Hughes, \u201cMen, the \u2018Public\u2019 and the \u2018Private\u2019 in the English Revolution,\u201d in Lake and\nPincus, The Politics of the Public Sphere, 201\u20132.\n74 \u201cSir Richard Grenviles Single Defence,\u201d Bodl., Clarendon MS 47, fol. 316r-v; Ronald G.

These texts ranged from a passage in an established serial newsbook\nto a fully dedicated pamphlet, and they were often published as soon as possible\nafter the defection.77 Their production became obligatory as propagandists sought\nto maximize the damage that defections inflicted upon the enemy. For this purpose\nthey tended to echo the propaganda of both sides. Declarations of parliamentarians\nwho became royalists stressed how low-born social subversives, anarchy, and re-\nligious confusion dominated the parliamentary ranks, while their opposite coun-\nterparts trumpeted disgust at the Cessation in Ireland and the strength of popery\nat court.\nSergeant-Major Robert Kirle and Sir Edward Dering constitute telling examples\nof each. Kirle\u2019s lengthy declaration encompassed an eight-page pamphlet that\nclaimed to publish a letter he had written to a friend at Windsor in February or\nMarch 1643, soon after his defection to Oxford. His avowed purpose in writing\nfor a supposed parliamentarian audience was to \u201cfree myself from the imputation\nof dishonour, and undeceive others.\u201d He excused his previous parliamentarianism\nby claiming that, having recently returned from soldiering abroad, his ignorance\nof events led him unwittingly into Parliament\u2019s army. He argued that it was not\nnecessity, ambition, or malice that motivated his defection, but rather \u201ca perfect\ndiscovery of those false lights, that have hitherto misled me, and a deep appre-\nhension of the horrour which attends the persevering in such errors.\u201d Then he\nstressed the link between religious plurality and social subversion that became the\ncornerstone of royalist propaganda: \u201cCertaine I am, that all the Officers of no one\nCompany were of the same Opinion what religion they fought for . . . . Some\nliked the Chaplain of the Regiment, another thought his Corporall preached better\n. . . and one would thinke, that every Company had been raised out of the severall\nCongregations of Amsterdam . . . if they cannot prove any of quality to be a\nPapist, yet as he is a Gentleman, he shall want grace; and that is title enough to\npossesse the estates of all that are more richer then themselves.\u201d78 How, if at all,\nKirle explained this pamphlet when he returned to his parliamentary allegiance in\nSeptember 1644 remains unknown, but his case illustrates how effectively self-\ndefenses could be turned to the purposes of partisan propaganda.79\nThis process grew more sophisticated as the war lengthened. Jason Peacey\u2019s\nextensive research on Sir Edward Dering has recently shown that, when Dering\ndeserted Oxford for London in February 1644, Parliament forced him to issue a\ndeclaration explaining his defection. An ailing Sir Edward had wished to accept\nParliament\u2019s offer of a pardon in order to return home to settle his personal affairs\nbefore he died.80 He was granted liberty upon submitting an apologetic petition,\nbut its contents were humiliatingly made public, and the county committee of his\n77 BL, TT E244(30), Mercurius Aulicus, 1\u20137 January (Oxford, 1643), 6.\n78 BL, TT E246(35), A Copy of a Letter Writ from Serjeant Major Kirle, to a Friend in Windsor\n(London, 1643), 2\u20133.\n79 Newman, Royalist Officers, 219; John Webb and T.

Dering expressed disgust at Catholic officers\ndominating the king and abhorrence of the Cessation in Ireland. Dering\u2019s con-\ndemnation of the Oxford Parliament as \u201can anti-Parliament\u201d was conveniently\ntimely, while his tirade against Laudian-popish ceremonies and the \u201cDionysian\nOrgy\u201d of organ music at Oxford was surely calculated to appeal to the godly:\n\u201cOne single groan in the Spirit, is worth the Diapason of all the Church-Musick\nin the world.\u201d82\nDespite attempts at a constancy narrative, Dering admitted to a genuine con-\nversion, comparing himself with Saint Paul, \u201cfrom a Persecuter, I was made a\nConvert.\u201d He joined the king in summer 1642 as \u201cthe most unwilling man that\never went,\u201d even making the dubious claim that he had advised the king to return\nto Westminster with just forty servants accompanying him. Dering stressed that\nhe returned out of choice, not compulsion, and \u201cprofessing my self very sorry for\nbearing Arms against the Parliament.\u201d83 This was a godsend for parliamentary\npropaganda. Dering had been a vocal member of Parliament, renowned for court-\ning popularity by circulating his speeches. It was widely anticipated that reports\nof his defection would precipitate other royalists to change sides or withdraw their\nallegiance.84 Indeed, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper was among several who changed\nsides soon after, surrendering himself to the parliamentary garrison at Hurst castle\non 24 February 1644. Like Dering before him, he emphasized political principles\nbefore his personal interests, remarking that the influence of Catholics at court and\nthe Cessation in Ireland were \u201cdestructive to religion and state.\u201d Ashley Cooper\nhad resigned his royalist commissions well before changing sides, and he maintained\nthat he had therefore not acted dishonorably or been unfaithful to the king. Par-\nliament evidently considered his principled conversion genuine; by August 1644, he\nwas commissioned as parliamentarian field marshal-general in Dorset, remaining a\nloyal and energetic commander thereafter.85\n81 Jason Peacey, \u201cPopularity and the Politician: Sir Edward Dering and the Public, 1640\u20131644,\u201d\npaper presented at the Early Modern British History Seminar, University of Cambridge, 2007.\n82 BL, TT E40(5): A Declaration by Sir Edward Dering Knight and Baronet, 1 April (London,\n1644), 8\u201311.\n83 Ibid., 2\u20133, 6, 7\u20138.\n84 C.

Cholmley\u2019s memoirs and memorials set about justifying his defection\nin a much different way from the pamphlets and newsbooks discussed above.\nCholmley wrote these manuscript memoirs in the changed circumstances of 1656,\nand the passage of time allowed greater opportunity for refashioning and self-\ndeception.86 Kevin Sharpe and Steven Zwicker have discussed how the writers of\nsuch memoirs were concerned to produce exemplary accounts, \u201cwritten for use\u201d\nand designed as a counsel and guide for others.87 Cholmley addressed his memoirs\nto his sons for the defense of his good name. They made several false claims,\nincluding that, when he changed sides in March 1643, the whole garrison of\nScarborough \u201cwas immediately settled for the King without the least mutiny or\ndisturbance.\u201d88 He remained anxious that posterity would regard him as inconstant.\nHe maintained that he did not break his trust with Parliament. Instead, it had\nbroken its trust with him by altering the grounds of the war, failing to supply him\nproperly, and allowing his name to be slandered in London. His memoirs claimed\nthat his motives were not \u201cfor any perticuler ends of my owne, but merely to\nperforme the duty and alleagance I owed to my Soveraigne, and which I did in\nsuch away as was with out any deminution of my honour either as a gentleman\nor souldier.\u201d89\nDuring 1648 Cholmley had written an earlier retrospective justification for Clar-\nendon entitled \u201cMemorialls tuching Scarbrough.\u201d This prose sought to explain\nhis former parliamentarianism as having arisen from an \u201capprehension that persons\nill affected to the peace of the kingdome did intrude themselves into imployment.\u201d\nHe contended that, by undertaking the governorship of Scarborough, he kept out\nmore dangerous alternatives, while his more impartial disposition enabled him to\npromote peace from a position of armed strength. He claimed that his Protestation\nand allegiance oaths required him to defend the king and that he twice urged\nSpeaker Lenthall to negotiate a peace treaty, lamenting that the \u201ckings faire and\nreasonable propositions\u201d went unheeded.90 Cholmley had indeed complained to\nLenthall, and when the Commons responded by ordering him to quit Scarbor-\nough, he refused.91 Instead, he traveled in disguise to York, on 20 March 1643,\nto secretly negotiate his defection with the queen. One of his initial conditions,\nlater overtaken by events, was that he be granted three weeks to return his\ncommission to Essex so that when he turned royalist he might not be charged\nwith betraying his trust.92\n86 Glaser, The Creation of the Self, 5.\n87 Sharpe and Zwicker, Writing Lives, vi, 4, 13, 19.\n88 Binns, Memoirs and Memorials of Sir Hugh Cholmley, 144.\n89 Ibid., 105.\n90 Ibid., 143.\n91 For Cholmley\u2019s complaint to Speaker Lenthall, see TNA: HMC, Portland MSS, 29, 13th\nReport, appendix, part 1 (London, 1891), vol. 1, 90; York Minster Library (YML), Civil War\nTract (CWT), 43-01-18, Newes from Yorke.

In December 1642, he was chastised in Parliament for\ndisobeying Lord Fairfax\u2019s orders, and by January 1643, he bitterly complained of\nhis treatment in the press, warning Lenthall that \u201cmy former actions did never\ndeserve those representations of them which were in print, nor any belief of\nthem.\u201d93 In March, he lamented that Parliament had slighted him by not sending\nhim sufficient supplies.94 Cholmley\u2019s sensitivity was partly due to his upbringing.\nHe admitted that his father was of a \u201chaughty sperret and chollericke,\u201d swore too\nmuch, and was prone to duels and rude behavior toward his servants and the\ncountry people. His father struck a gentleman in Star Chamber, and Sir Hugh\nhimself struck down a trained bandsman for insolence in 1639.95 A close attention\nto lineage, reputation, and local standing shaped Cholmley\u2019s notion of honor. For\ninstance, his pew at Whitby, which \u201ccompletely straddles the chancel arch,\u201d has\nbeen described as an \u201cincredibly vulgar\u201d display of status.96\nCholmley\u2019s representation to his sons of selfless cavalier loyalty is less than\nconvincing. His defection was dictated by the local military situation, for he sought\nto prevent Scarborough being besieged.97 If the northern royalist army was not\nso large and threatening to his estates, Cholmley\u2019s royalism may have been less\nforthcoming. Furthermore, his honor was soon questioned by comrades who had\ndeserted. Fearing to come abroad, his terms with the queen insisted that he remain\nScarborough\u2019s governor. He surrounded himself with servants armed with pistols\nand almost came to blows with his officers, at least six of whom deserted him with\nabout one hundred troopers. In endeavoring to dissuade him from changing sides,\none of his captains claimed to have warned him \u201cwhat a dishonour it would be\nto himselfe, and what a stain to his posterity.\u201d98\nCholmley was ordered to be impeached for high treason in the Commons on\n2 April 1643. In October 1645, his exemption from pardon was proposed.99 The\npress, whose invective against him was vicious, amplified the condemnation. He\nwas nicknamed \u201cJudas Cholmley,\u201d a \u201cbase treacherous (Apostate),\u201d who \u201cdeserves\nnot the name of a gentleman,\u201d and he was accused of putting Whitby civilians to\nthe sword.100 Compelled by this savaging, Cholmley crafted a self-image of personal\n93 Journals of the House of Commons, 2:893; Letter of Sir Hugh Cholmley to William Lenthall,\n16 January 1642\u201343, TNA: HMC, Portland MSS, HMC, 29, 13th Report, appendix, part 1, vol.\n1, 90; Parliamentary journal of Sir Simonds D\u2019Ewes, 16 February 1642\u201343, BL, Harl.

This constitutes a recurrent notion among sympathetic representations\nof side-changing. His protestations persuaded Clarendon, who clearly admired\nhim, and even Gardiner, who compared him favorably with the Hothams, saying\nhe appeared \u201cto have had the nobler nature, and to have been actuated by the\npurer motives.\u201d101\nOur final case study for the self-fashioning of turncoats examines the corre-\nspondence of disaffected officers with enemy commanders, a perennial fear of\nleaders on both sides. A large number of such letters survive between the earl of\nNewcastle and the two greatest failed turncoats of the war: Sir John Hotham,\nParliament\u2019s governor of Hull, and his eldest son, deputy governor, and namesake\nLieutenant-General John Hotham. Their conspicuous role in denying the king\nentrance to Hull in April 1642 made them national figures, but their parliamen-\ntarianism cooled thereafter as, like Cholmley, their estates were threatened by the\nearl of Newcastle\u2019s large royalist army. Fearful of religious radicalism and social\nsubversives among the West Riding\u2019s populous clothing districts and angered at\nthe eminence of their rivals the Fairfaxes, the younger Hotham entered into a\nfrequent, friendly correspondence with Newcastle from December 1642. He even-\ntually pledged to Newcastle that he would defect at an opportune moment and\nbring with him his father, Hull, Beverley, and Lincoln, along with disaffected\nparliamentarians in Lincolnshire and the East Riding.102\nIn these letters the younger Hotham presented himself to Newcastle as trust-\nworthy, honest, constant, and an effective military commander who might be\nbrought to change sides if Parliament should err: \u201cI am very sorry you should\never harbour such an opinion of me as to thinke that any motive whatsoever could\never move me to betray the publicke trust I have undertaken.

The younger Hotham knew of such rumors, for he pledged to\nNewcastle, on 4 May 1643, \u201cI am as much your servant as ever, and twenty such\nbusinesses as Reading shall make no alteration.\u201d105 He indicated his desire to\nchange sides but to do so in such a way \u201cas not to bring upon me the odious\nname of knavery.\u201d He held out the hope that Parliament\u2019s mistreatment of him\nwould permit a change of sides without staining his honor, which he remarked\nwas \u201clike a woman\u2019s honesty, not to be repaired if once toucht.\u201d Meanwhile he\nsought to ingratiate himself by warning Newcastle that he was mocked at court\nby Lady Cornwallis, who said, \u201cthat you were a sweet General, lay in bed until\neleven o\u2019clock and combed till 12, then came to the Queen, and so the work was\ndone, and that General King did all the business.\u201d He warned Newcastle, \u201cYou\ncan expect nothing at court, truly the women rule all.\u201d106 By pointing to the\ninversion of gender roles at court, he shrewdly appealed to Newcastle\u2019s frustration\nwith gossips jealous of his success in raising a large army. Here the concept of\nwomen\u2019s unnatural engagement in high politics blended with notions of secrecy,\nintrigue, and deception as feminine attributes.107 The younger Hotham contrasted\nthis with the virtues of the open, masculine friendship, personal loyalty, and con-\nstancy that he offered the earl. His repeated self-justificatory references to his\nhonor strung Newcastle along and were intended to protect the Hotham estates\nfrom royalist soldiers, until, prepared with strong arguments against having broken\ntheir trust, his family was ready to defect. Hotham knew well that, since his father\nrefused the king at Hull, they would need to defect spectacularly by drawing a\nlarge force and territory into royalist control. This procrastination led to wide-\nspread speculation about the betrayal of Hull weeks before their final arrest on\n29 June 1643.108 They remained untried for seventeen months, but Sir John\nHotham\u2019s defense for his trial at the Guildhall in December 1644 provides another\nexcellent source for a turncoat\u2019s self-fashioning.\nWritten to save his life, the dramatic language of the defense magnified Sir John\u2019s\nformer services in securing Hull and emphasized the danger to his person. As in\nother contemporary prison writings, Sir John sought to validate his conduct and\noverturn the suspicions that led to his confinement.109 Referring to his refusal of\nthe king, Sir John declared he did not seek \u201cto have a part to play unpresidented\nby any,\u201d adding, \u201cI satt downe with joy under the name and hazard of a Traytor.\u201d\nHe argued that his \u201csingle endeavours\u201d had raised, paid, and maintained over\n3,000 men.

Sir John also criticized the \u201cill management,\u201d and \u201cback-\nwardnesse\u201d of the Fairfaxes for having brokered a treaty of neutrality in September\n1642, and for failing to reinforce him to contest the Queen\u2019s passage to York in\nFebruary 1643.110\nYet, despite this forceful defense, what doomed father and son was their shared\ntendency, common among turncoats, to respond impulsively to perceived slights.\nWhen the younger Hotham returned to Hull after escaping from his first arrest\nat Nottingham, Sir John Hotham procured the signatures of his council of war\nto a strikingly peremptory letter to Parliament, demanding that Cromwell and his\n\u201cAnabaptist rogues\u201d \u201cbe delivered to justice\u201d for causing his son\u2019s wrongful im-\nprisonment. The letter prepared the ground for their long-considered defection,\nstating explicitly that their sense of injury freed them from the obligations of their\nformer allegiance:\nThere is nothing in this world, next to their duty to God Almighty, dearer to men\nof honour than their reputations; neither is there any thing that falls out with more\nregret to them, than to have that violated by those whom they esteem their friends,\nand of whom, they conceive, they have had just right to expect other dealings. This\nletter is occasioned by the most unjust and perfidious wrong offered to one of our\nsociety here, which, as we conceive, was ever put on any man; and, we are further\npersuaded, that no age or history can produce the like example: and truly, it gives us\nall just cause to look to our own conditions, who are by the king esteemed traitors;\nand if we shall be subject to be abused by such mischievous instruments as these are,\nwho have been the cause of this gentleman\u2019s wrong, we certainly remain in a sad\ncondition; and, we think, we shall be excused before God and man, to do the best\nwe can for our own preservation.111\nThe Hothams stressed blood, pedigree, and lineage in their ideas about honor\nbecause their capacious kinship network, provided by eight ill-fated wives, related\nthem to all the East Riding\u2019s leading parliamentarians.112 Since the Hothams could\nboast an unbroken lineage of succession from father to son since the twelfth\ncentury, it was hardly surprising that their concept of honor stressed pedigree.\nSuch continuity of lineage was held to prove a family\u2019s virtue, since longer, purer\npedigrees concentrated levels of noble blood.113 Partly due to this, they had grown\nnotoriously sensitive to perceived slights.

They also considered their York-\nshire baronetcy equal or superior to Fairfax\u2019s Scottish barony. A letter among the\nHotham papers concerning John Hotham and Lord Fairfax lamented of the \u201cun-\nhappy difference twixt men soe equally worth.\u201d116 Only a family particularly stri-\ndent about its status would acclaim an esquire the equal of a baron, while Sir John\nwarned the Fairfaxes to \u201cgive not law to those from whom you ought to receive.\u201d117\nThe hostility toward the Fairfaxes in Sir John\u2019s defense also reflected how the\nHothams\u2019 trials became entwined with factional power struggles at Westminster\nover new-modeling the parliamentary armies.118\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nFrom the wavering of county magnates like Sir John Hotham to the businesslike\ntransactions of career soldiers like Sir John Urry, gentlemen changed sides for a\nvariety of reasons. They communicated their defections in widely differing ways\nto vindicate themselves and establish the \u201ctruth\u201d of their actions. It remains difficult\nto disentangle their self-interest from political loyalties, and contemporaries may\nnot always have envisioned such distinctions. Yet, despite these differences, several\ncollective similarities emerge from the individual cases discussed. Few defections\noccurred among godly parliamentarians, while the Hothams, Chudleigh, Cholm-\nley, Grenville, and Urry were hardly noted for attachment to Puritans. Although\nturncoats had been brought up with civic humanist notions of serving the public,\nwhich some of them vocalized in their self-justificatory narratives, many defections\nappear to have been grounded upon older concepts of honor, placing lineage,\npedigree, and martial values at the heart of the defectors\u2019 sense of self-worth. This\nsupports Richard Cust\u2019s arguments that the early Stuart gentry were adept at\nemploying a variety of concepts of honor in their self-representation to meet\nchanging needs, occasions, and audiences. For example, the composition narratives\ntend to emphasize their faithfulness to the parliamentary cause from the outset,\npropaganda conversion narratives focused most on the alienating features of the\nenemy, and memoirs and autobiographies for posterity were most inclined to stress\nprinciple and constancy.\n114 John Morrill, The Nature of the English Revolution (London, 1993), 184; Heal and Holmes,\nThe Gentry in England and Wales, 171; Stirling, The Hothams, 1:96\u201397.\n115 Philip Saltmarshe, History and Chartulary of the Hothams of Scorborough in the East Riding of\nYorkshire, 1100\u20131700 (York, 1914), 112; Letter of John Hampden to Sir John Hotham, 4 October\n1642, HHC: HUA, Hotham MS, DDHO\/1\/8.\n116 Draft letter concerning John Hotham and the war in Yorkshire, n.d., 1643, HHC: HUA,\nHotham MS, DDHO\/1\/60.\n117 YML, CWT, 1642\u201343(2), Reasons Why Sir John Hotham, Trusted by the Parliament, Cannot\nin Honour Agree to the Treaty of Pacification made by some Gentlemen of York-shire at Rothwell, 29\nSeptember (London, 1642), 2, 8.\n118 Andrew Hopper, \u201cBlack Tom\u201d: Sir Thomas Fairfax and the English Revolution (Manchester,\n2007), 60\u201362.\nchecked 22 \u0002 HOPPER\nThursday Dec 31 2009 09:46 AM JBS v49n2 85 BBS\nThe status-obsessed nature of the English gentry may well have inclined those\nmost sensitive about perceived slights to be more prone to side-changing.119 Those\nmore temperamental about standing and rank appear more conditional in their\nallegiance and less able to fully commit to serving a cause. It is revealing just how\nmany turncoats argued that they were slighted by their comrades before they\nchanged sides. Defections were rarely hasty decisions but more usually the cul-\nmination of a growing sense of disillusionment. Although both sides developed\nmechanisms for redressing slighted honor and containing factional conflict, when\nthese failed, changing sides became the ultimate sanction for those snubbed by\ncolleagues or marginalized by internecine politics.120 As Patrick Little has observed,\nit was often \u201ca reaction against the old masters, not a sudden burst of enthusiasm\nfor the new ones.\u201d121 However, turncoats nearly always claimed to be following\ntheir consciences and therefore to be acting with due principle and constancy.\nSensitive about defending reputations for their descendants and posterity, they\nfashioned their retrospective narratives of constancy through selective memory and\navoidance of compromising details. Some resigned their commands weeks before\ndefecting to protect themselves from charges of betraying their trust. Many pro-\nfessed or experienced genuine political conversions, seeking to play down the\nsignificance or explain away the reasons for their former allegiance. Others displaced\nthe slur of inconstancy onto former comrades; it was not the turncoat but they\nwho had changed. This confirms that, by the 1640s, the English gentry had grown\nremarkably adept at projecting a variety of self-representations for different pur-\nposes and audiences.\nAlthough primary sources such as Clarendon and recent historians such as Mark\nStoyle agree that defectors were scorned, this reaction was not universal. Some\ndefectors remained true to their new allegiance in the face of unfavorable subse-\nquent circumstances, so we should be wary of discountenancing all declarations\nof principle in self-justificatory statements. Neither should all turncoats be inter-\npreted as cynical political opportunists; many defections followed tortuous and\nongoing dilemmas of conflicting loyalties. Most of those parliamentarians who\njoined the king in 1643 stood by their decisions, and their steadfast royalism\nthereafter remains striking.122 Some defectors became valued and trusted by their\nnew comrades, and Barbara Donagan has argued that, despite many being exe-\ncuted, \u201cthe record is dotted with turncoats who survived and prospered.\u201d123 Those\nable to persuade themselves and enough others that they changed sides from\nconscience might retain their own sense of honor and public reputation despite\nbitter condemnations from those they deserted.124\n119 Hopper, \u201cFitted for Desperation,\u201d 153\u201354.\n120 Ann Hughes, \u201cThe King, the Parliament, and the Localities during the English Civil War,\u201d\nJournal of British Studies 24, no. 2 (April 1985): 259\u201363; Ian Atherton, \u201cRoyalist Finances in the\nEnglish Civil War: The Case of Lichfield Garrison, 1643\u201345,\u201d Midland History 33, no. 1 (Spring\n2008): 66\u201367.\n121 Little, \u201cFour Dorset Turncoats.\u201d\n122 Newman, The Old Service, 40\u201341, 121.\n123 Prominent examples included in the ODNB are Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, Bussy Mansell,\nSir Edward Massey, Sir Trevor Williams, and Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough.\n124 Donagan, \u201cThe Web of Honour,\u201d 382\u201383.\n"}
