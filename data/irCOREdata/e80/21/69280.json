An analysis of interviews with 28 students constituted four qualitatively \ndifferent conceptions of the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f. These ranged from the tutorial involving \nthe tutor explaining to the student what the student did not know, to the tutorial involving \nthe tutor and the student in exchanging different points of view and both coming to a new \nunderstanding of the topic under discussion. These different conceptions also appeared to \nbe related to variations in students\u201f views of the role of the work done in preparation for \nthe tutorial, their view of the student\u201fs and tutor\u201fs roles in the tutorial, and the conception \nof knowledge that students adopted in relation to the tutorial. The implications of this \nstudy are discussed in terms of the relations between students\u201f conceptions of tutorials \nand their anticipated learning outcomes and its implications for contexts outside of \nOxford in terms of students\u201f conceptions of academic tasks.   \n \nKey Words \nTutorials \nStudents \nPhenomenography \nConceptions of learning \nApproaches to Studying \n  3 \nVariation in Students\u2019 Experiences of the \u2018Oxford Tutorial\u20191 \nIntroduction \nThe tutorial systems at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge can be argued to have \nhad a huge impact on the way in which teaching and learning is thought about in British \nuniversities and beyond.  For example, Rose and Ziman (1964) argued that: \n \nOxford and Cambridge are the most famous universities in the English-\nspeaking world. In particular they are the most famous teaching universities. \nThey are supposed to possess some special and unique method for getting \nintellects to sparkle, for filling heads with knowledge, for making \nundergraduates big with wisdom (p.59). \n \nTapper and Palfreyman (2000) argue further that it was the tutorial systems at Oxford and \nCambridge that led to the subsequent development of group work in English-speaking \nuniversities in a way that was different from universities in mainland Europe. \n \nDespite this impact, there has been a paucity of research into the Oxbridge tutorial \nsystems and where these systems have been considered, they have largely been \nconsidered from the perspective of those who teach, rather those who learn, within that \nsystem. For example, Palfreyman (2001) offers a number of different accounts of the \ntutorial system from the perspective of tutors. This paper seeks to look at the tutorial \nsystem, and in particular, the Oxford tutorial system from the perspective of students. A \nstudy is reported that focused on developing an understanding of the different ways in \n  4 \nwhich students understand the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f. It is argued that this study has relevance \noutside of the University of Oxford because it adds to a growing literature on students\u201f \nconceptions of their academic tasks, which suggests that these conceptions are related to \nthe quality of their learning.\n \nThe \u2018Oxford Tutorial\u2019\nThere are two factors that differentiate the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f from tutorials in other UK \nuniversities, apart from Cambridge, and, therefore, make the literature on these tutorials \n(for example, Anderson 1997) less relevant to the Oxford context. The first is that at \nOxford the tutorial is a part of a learning system and the second is the size of the tutorials. \n \nThe \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f is part of a learning system that involves a period, usually a week, \nof intensive study, the preparation of some work, whether an essay or completion of a \nproblem sheet, followed by the tutorial itself. Students usually have about 3 tutorials a \nfortnight and report spending about 13 hours preparing for each tutorial. First year \nstudents report spending less time preparing than final year students (11 hours compared \nto about 14 hours) and arts and social science students report spending longer preparing \nthan science students (about 15 hours compared to 9 hours) (all figures from the \nCommission of Inquiry 1997). \n \nThe size of tutorials varies with 1 tutor working with between 1 and 6 students. The \nCommission of Inquiry (1997) found that the most common size of tutorial was 2 \nstudents but that tutorials in social sciences, sciences and engineering tended to be bigger \n  5 \nthan those in the arts. This is smaller than tutorials in other institutions in the UK. For \nexample, Tapper and Palfreyman (2000) report that \u201etutorials\u201f at the University of Sussex \ninvolve 12 or more students.   \n \nThe structure of tutorials vary; tutors have autonomy in deciding how to structure them \nand what content to focus on in tutorials. However, a general structure appears to be that \nthere will be an interrogation, whether questioning or discussion, of the work that the \nstudent(s) have completed in preparation for the tutorial. This work may be handed in \nbefore hand, in the case of an essay it may be read out in the tutorial, or the tutor may \ntake in the work at the end of the tutorial or not at all. The discussion usually starts with \nthe student(s) being given the opportunity to ask any questions they have about the \nsubject matter and proceeds from there.  \n \nDifferent commentators have had very different views of the effectiveness of the tutorial. \nMoore (1968), based on his experience as a tutor at Oxford, emphasised three cardinal \nprinciples of the tutorial: catering for the individual, the co-operation between tutor and \nstudent and a particular view of knowledge.  He argued that the individual nature of the \ntutorial allows each student to learn at their own pace and to ask any questions they may \nhave. It also allows the tutor to adapt the process to the student\u201fs learning needs and to \ngive students immediate feedback on their performance. He argued that the tutorial \nrelationship should be one in which two minds worked on the same problem and that it is \nan opportunity for intellectual growth for the student and the tutor, in which the student \nshould gradually acquire independence from their tutor. Finally, Moore argued that, in \n  6 \nthe tutorial, knowledge is seen as contested. The undergraduate has the opportunity to put \nforward his or her own ideas and present a critical analysis of a particular problem or \nproposition. Moore felt that his view of the tutorial system was best summed up by \nReeves:  \n  \n\u201c[T]here is no substitute for the individual tutorial, either singly or in pairs. \nIt\u201fs function is not to instruct: it is to set the student the task of expressing his \nthought articulately and then to assist him in subjecting his creation to critical \nexamination and reconstructing it. The charge of spoon-feeding so often \nlevelled against the tutorial method implies a complete misunderstanding of \nits function\u201d (Dr Marjorie Reeves, Vice-Principal of St Anne\u201fs College, \nOxford quoted in Moore 1968). \n \nIn contrast to Moore, Elton (2001) has argued that tutorials at Oxford, as well as \nCambridge, are centred around the tutor rather than on the discussion of students\u201f ideas \nand that they do not normally result in high quality student learning. He argued that \u201cIt \nmay be noted that the famous Oxbridge tutorial is firmly teacher centred and, except for \nthe most able students, may not normally lead to deep learning\u201d (Elton 2001). \n \nHowever, the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f has not been examined from the perspective of students. \nThis study sought to examine the following questions: What do students understand to be \nthe role of tutorials in their learning? Are there relations between their conceptions of the \ntutorials and their understanding of the role of the work they complete in preparation for \n  7 \nthe tutorial? Do students\u201f understandings of their own role in the tutorial and the role of \nthe tutor vary with their conceptions of the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f? Are the conceptions of \nknowledge that students adopt in the tutorial related to their conception of the tutorial?  \n \nMethod \nIn examining students\u201f conceptions of their tutorials, this study sought to examine their \nconceptions of a particular academic task. Whilst students\u201f conceptions of the \u201eOxford \nTutorial\u201f have not been examined before, other studies have looked at students\u201f \nconceptions of other academic tasks. For example, Hounsell (1997) examined students\u201f \nconceptions of essay writing, whilst Light (2002) has examined students\u201f conceptions of  \ncreative writing. These studies draw on work on students\u201f conceptions of learning (S\u00e4lj\u00f6 \n1979, Marton et al 1993) for both their methods (semi-structured interviews) and their \napproach to analysing these interviews (phenomenographic). This was also the approach \ntaken in the current study. \n \nTwenty-eight undergraduates from a variety of disciplines and all years of study were \ninterviewed about their experience of studying at Oxford. The students were volunteers. \nThey were asked to describe a typical, but actual, week of study. The interviews were \nthen structured around this description, with particular attention paid to the meaning to \nstudents of various activities that they engaged in, in their studies. In all cases this led to a \ndiscussion about the tutorial system.  \n \n  8 \nThe interviews were taped and transcribed. They were analysed using a \nphenomenographic approach (Marton and Booth 1997). The unit of analysis was \nstudents\u201f conceptions of their tutorials and thus the focus was on qualitative variation in \nthe ways in which the students experienced tutorials at Oxford. The different meanings \nthat students assigned to tutorials were used to form categories of description. The aim \nwas to offer a hierarchy of empirically grounded and logically consistent categories of \ndescription of the different ways in which students experienced tutorials. The analysis \nwas carried out by the author, with a colleague who verified that the categories could be \nsubstantiated using the interview data.  \n \nResults \nFour qualitatively different ways of understanding the role of tutorials were constituted in \nthe analysis of the interviews: \n \n1. Tutorials as the tutor explaining to the student what the student does not \nunderstand \n2. Tutorials as the tutor showing the student how to see the subject in the way that \nthe tutor does \n3. Tutorials as the tutor bringing things into relation to each other to help the student \ndevelop a new perspective in the wider context of the discipline \n4. Tutorials as the tutor and the student exchanging different points of view on the \ntopic and both coming to a new understanding. \n \n  9 \nAs with students\u201f conceptions of learning (for example see Marton et al 1993), the four \nconceptions of tutorials formed a nested hierarchy. This implies that a student who adopts \nConception 4 will also be aware of the other three conceptions. However, if a student \nadopts Conception 1, it cannot be inferred that they are aware of Conceptions 2, 3 and 4. \n \n These qualitatively different understandings of the tutorial were found to be related to \ndifferent student understandings of the role of work that was completed in preparation for \nthe tutorial, the role of the student and the tutor in tutorials, and the conception of \nknowledge that students adopted in the tutorial. These dimensions are included in \ndescriptions of the categories below. The descriptions of categories are illustrated with \nquotations from students. It should be noted that, as the conceptions that are constituted \nby phenomenographic analysis are based upon an analysis of all of the interview \ntranscripts within a study, it is unusual to find quotations that perfectly illustrate each \nconception. The student quotations given in this paper were selected because they give \nsome sense of the conception they are illustrating, it is certainly not suggested that they \nwill provide readers with a complete sense of each conception.  \n \nConception 1: Tutorials as the tutor explaining to the student what the student does not \nunderstand \nStudents adopting this conception saw the purpose of tutorials as being to check their \nprogress and to ensure the efficient transfer of information relevant to the topic\n2\n that was \nthe subject of the tutorial. The role of the preparation work was for the student to produce \nan artefact, whether an essay or solutions to a series of problems, that would be used by \n  10 \nthe tutor to assess how much the student knew, to help the student gain knowledge that \nthey could use in the tutorial and to help them develop an overview of the topic. The \nstudents adopting this conception saw that their role in the tutorial was to be tested by \ntheir tutor, to use the information they had gained to answer the tutor\u201fs questions, and to \nabsorb information from the tutor. They saw that the tutor\u201fs role was to test the student \nand to provide the student with new information on the topic. Thus under this conception \nof tutorials, students\u201f perceived knowledge as accumulative and uncontested. This is not \nto say that they felt the truth could always be found but rather that they felt that new \nknowledge could be added to old knowledge unproblematically and that, given a certain \nset of facts, there was a \u201ecorrect\u201f way to interpret them.  Two quotes from students \nillustrate some of these dimensions.   \n \nDoing the [preparation] work is the important thing, then what you get out of \nthe tutorial is 1) you see whether you\u201fve done it right or not, 2) you\u201fre \nlearning whether you\u201fve done it in an efficient way or whether there\u201fs a better \nway of doing it, 3) you learn whether it\u201fs really that relevant or not. . . So the \npurpose of them is to make sure you know it, teach you the good ways of \ndoing it, giving you more information, telling you what\u201fs relevant, and that\u201fs \nabout it. \n(Fourth Year Physicist) \n \nIt varies very much between tutor and tutor, some tutors\u201f tutorials are like a \nlecture, you come away with very organised notes, adding a lot to the \n  11 \ninformation you didn\u201ft know before, which is very useful. Other times you \nleave the tutorial not feeling like you\u201fve gained a lot from it \u2026 Some people \nwrite essays on a very high theoretical plane where I just couldn\u201ft follow \nthem, and some people, like me, try to stick to facts and relatively simpler \nideas. So the type of tutorial that suits you depends on that a lot. I like dealing \nwith facts, I like information I can say \u201eI know this is true, or within \nreasonable doubt I know this is true\u201f because you can\u201ft know for certain in \nhistory.  \n(Second Year Historian) \n \nConception 2: Tutorials as the tutor showing the student how to see the subject in the way \nthat the tutor does \nStudents adopting this conception of tutorials considered the purpose of tutorials to be for \nthe student to get to understand the topic in the way that the tutor did. They saw the role \nof the preparation work was for the student to show the tutor how much they had \nunderstood the material that they had studied for the tutorial. They perceived that their \nrole was to discuss the tutor\u201fs ideas in relation to the ideas they had gained from their \npreparatory work, whilst they saw the tutor\u201fs role was to ask students questions that took \nthem beyond their initial understanding of the topic and to explain the topic in the way \nthat they viewed it. In this case, students saw knowledge as uncontested but it was not \nseen as accumulative as, under this conception, an understanding of the topic was based \non more than an accumulation of facts. It was rather concerned with seeing the material \n  12 \nin the \u201ecorrect\u201f way. Again, quotes from two of the students interviewed are used to \nillustrate this conception. \n  \n[The purpose of tutorials is]  to put forward the things that I\u201fve discovered \nfrom the reading that I\u201fve done, to ask questions of areas that I\u201fm not too sure \nabout and to have my knowledge of the subject probed by the tutor through \ntheir questions and then have them explain the way that they view it and \ndiscuss those interpretations of the particular topics, and then get a better \nunderstanding of the topics as a whole, and a much deeper understanding . . . \nThe tutors tend to explain the slightly more subtle aspects of the different \nparts of the work that we\u201fre investigating. They tend to ask questions, rather \nleading questions, and then they lead you though the answers that they want \nyou to come to until you come to the conclusion that they hope you do come \nto, and by then you tend to understand what they\u201fre trying to get you to \nunderstand and it just gives you a better understanding of the topic. \n(First Year Biochemist)  \n \nBasically, I\u201fll ask him a question \u2013 often it\u201fll be that he works through it on \nthe board and he just keeps on working through it . . . I basically write down \nwhat he is doing and try to understand what he is doing. Sometimes it\u201fs just \nthat I haven\u201ft got a picture in my mind of what is happening \u2013 I can do all this \nmaths, but I don\u201ft have an image. I\u201fm not very good at drawing graphs of \nthese things in my mind and I can\u201ft just see what would happen say to a \n  13 \nbilliard ball in a field and I can\u201ft see why it\u201fs flying a particular direction, \nwhereas he\u201fll be able to visualise what it\u201fs doing \u2026 I get a lot of new ways of \nthinking about problems out of them basically. I get a lot out of them because \nI pick up their ways of approaching problems.  \n(Third Year Physicist) \n \nConception 3: Tutorials as the tutor bringing things into relation to each other to help \nthe student develop a new perspective in the wider context of the discipline \nStudents adopting this conception saw the purpose of tutorials as developing their ideas \nto gain a new perspective on the topic, and this new perspective may also have been new \nto the tutor. They saw that the role of preparation work was for them to develop an \nargument about the topic that was then the focus of the tutorial. They saw that their role \nin the tutorial was to discuss the relations that the tutor developed in relation to the \nstudents\u201f preparation work, whilst they saw that the role of the tutor was to develop these \nrelations. Under this conception of the tutorial, knowledge was seen by the student to be \ncontested in that they no longer appeared to perceive that there was one correct way to \nthink about issues within their discipline.  Two illustrative quotes are given below. \n \nI see it [the tutorial] as an opportunity really to show off a bit, show him what \nI can do, and then get his better and more learned ideas for where I could be \ngoing in the future. They are your opportunity to talk to this very wise person, \nwho knows all the answers, and you don\u201ft want them giving you the answers, \n  14 \nbut you want them to make you think differently, and that\u201fs what it\u201fs about, \nthinking differently.  \n(First Year English) \n \nThe most scary tutor I ever had was quite terrifying actually. He was very nice \nbut his tutorials, you used to come out of them like you\u201fd forcibly rearranged \nthe ideas in your head, and you\u201fd actually understand it in the end. He\u201fd pick \nout things you didn\u201ft even realise you\u201fd misunderstood and interrogate you \nabout it until you knew what you\u201fd misunderstood. That\u201fs what tutors should \ndo really otherwise you don\u201ft learn anything from them, so there\u201fs not really \nmuch point in them teaching you really. They may as well give you a list of \nbooks to read for the term and that\u201fll be it. If they don\u201ft question you and find \nout what you haven\u201ft understood, then you tend not to learn anything new \nfrom them. You might learn new facts, but you won\u201ft gain any new \nunderstanding. By being asked questions you find out what you have and \nhaven\u201ft understood, and are pushed into understanding things yourself, as \nopposed to just told what your tutor thinks about them . . . If the tutor asks you \na factual question they probably know the answer. If they ask you what you \nthink about something, they generally don\u201ft know the answer. Well obviously \nthey don\u201ft know what you think about it, but they also don\u201ft know what you \nshould think about it.  \n(Second Year Experimental Psychologist) \n \n  15 \nThe quotation from the psychology student is interesting because it gives evidence for the \nfour conceptions forming a nested hierarchy. The first part of the quotation focuses on the \ntutor\u201fs role in the tutorial being to ask questions that takes the student beyond their initial \nunderstanding as in Conception 2. However, the second part of the quotation moves to \nfocus on the student developing their own understanding of the topic that may differ from \nthe understanding of the tutor. \n \nConception 4: Tutorials as the tutor and the student exchanging different points of view \non the topic and both coming to a new understanding \nStudents adopting this conception of tutorials saw that the purpose of tutorials was for the \nstudents and tutors to develop their ideas about the topic. As with Conception 3, they \nperceived that the role of their preparation work was for them to develop an initial \nargument about the topic that was then the focus of the tutorial. The role of both student \nand tutor was to discuss their ideas about the topic in relation to the students\u201f preparatory \nwork, whilst the tutor had an additional responsibility to chair the discussion. Here the \nrelationship between the student and the tutor was seen as more reciprocal, whilst, as with \nConception 3, students saw knowledge as contested.  \n \nIt will often involve a discussion of both the plays\u201f relation to each other and \nit\u201fs basically a discussion where you can either agree or disagree with \nwhoever and it keeps going until the tutor says \u201eright, that\u201fs the end\u201f. In that \nrespect it doesn\u201ft particularly have a conclusion to it like an essay would, it \njust gets you thinking and often leaves you with a different perspective at the \n  16 \nend of it, which is pretty much what I would want to get out of it. . . The \nwhole idea is that it will prompt you to re-think what you\u201fve written or to add \nsomething new to it.  \n(Second Year English) \n \nThe apogee of the tutorial is where you don\u201ft know, the tutor doesn\u201ft know, \nbut between the two of you you\u201fre going to analyse this thing. I love it when \nyou\u201fre in with someone like Professor X and he\u201fs just whacking books off the \nshelf, getting maps out. He\u201fs there on his hands and knees and between the \ntwo of you, you manage to clarify something and that\u201fs a tremendous \nexperience. \n(Third Year History) \n \nRelations between students\u2019 conceptions of tutorials and other factors \nThere are many factors that may impact on students\u201f conceptions of tutorials. Prosser and \nTrigwell\u201fs (1999, Figure 2.2, p.17) model of student learning suggest a number of type of \nfactors that might relate to students\u201f conceptions of tutorial. These include aspects of \nstudents\u201f prior experience, such as their social class and schooling, students\u201f perceptions \nof their learning environment including their perceptions of the expectations of their \ntutors and their tutors\u201f approaches to and conceptions of tutorials, and aspects of the \nteaching and learning context, such as students\u201f discipline and their year of study. In this \nsmall-scale qualitative study with purposive sampling, it is not possible to generalise \nabout any of these important relations.  \n  17 \n \nHowever, it is possible to comment on the relations between students\u201f conceptions of \ntutorials and their discipline and year of study. Tables 1 and 2 show the relations between \nthe highest conceptions of tutorials that students appeared to express and their broad \ndiscipline\n3\n and year. The tables show that there are no strong relations between these \nvariables, with the results spread across most of the categories. In this small sample, there \nare no students in the Sciences or in in the first year of their studies who expressed the \nfourth conception of tutorials\n4\n (the tutorial as a joint enterprise between tutor and \nstudent). Whether these differences are related to the structure of disciplines, in the case \nof students\u201f studying the Sciences, and to students learning to engage with tutorials over \ntheir time at Oxford, in the case of students in their first year of study, are interesting \nquestions that are certainly worth examining in future studies. However, given the small \nnumber of students involved in this study, these relations are inconclusive \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nDiscussion \nTo return to the differing views of the tutorial of Moore and Elton, it seems that both are \nheld by some students but not by others. Some students, in accordance with Elton\n5\n, \nconceive of the tutorials as a teacher-centred learning environment in which they are \ninstructed by their tutors (conceptions 1 and 2), whilst others, in line with Moore, see that \ntutorials offer an opportunity for their ideas to be subjected to critical examination \nthrough which these ideas are reconstructed (conceptions 3 and 4).  \n \n  18 \nThis study is the first to examine students\u201f conceptions of the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f and, as \nsuch, had a number of potential limitations. The sample was selected to be large enough \nto maximise the variation in students\u201f conceptions of tutorials, although it was not \nselected in a way that makes the results generalisable. However, Trigwell and Ashwin\u201fs \n(2002) quantitative study of the Oxford learning environment more generally, which used \nquestionnaire items based on this study, suggests that the variation in the ways students\u201f \nconceive of tutorials constituted in this study works for a larger, generalisable, sample. \nSecond, unlike Anderson\u201fs (1997) study, this study was not designed to offer an insight \ninto how students\u201f understanding of tutorials developed over time and, unlike Mann\u201fs \n(2000) study of students\u201f experiences of reading, it did not seek to give a full and rich \ndescription of the meaning of the phenomena for each of the students. Rather, the focus \nwas on the variation in the ways a group of students\u201f conceived of tutorials rather than on \nfully describing individual students\u201f views or examining how these developed over time. \nThis approach was adopted because if an understanding of the critical aspects of variation \nin the ways that students\u201f experience tutorials can be developed and these can be related \nto the quality of students\u201f learning, then this can offer a way in which the learning of \nthese students can be improved.  \n \nThe results of Trigwell and Ashwin\u201fs (2002) study cited above, which used items \ndeveloped from the findings of this study, seem to suggest that this approach is a fruitful \none. In their sample of 155 students from one Oxford College, they found that the \nstudents with more sophisticated conceptions of tutorials (Conceptions 3 and 4) were \nmore likely to perceive their learning environment as supportive, engage in higher quality \n  19 \nlearning (as measured by their approaches to learning), and to anticipate a higher learning \noutcome. This suggests that students\u201f conceptions of tutorials, that is their understanding \nof the academic task undertaken as part of the tutorial system, is related to their \nsuccessful engagement in that system. This presents the possibility that, if students can be \nhelped to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the role of tutorials, or academic \ntasks more generally, in their learning, then the quality of their learning can be improved.  \n \nThe suggestion that students\u201f understanding of their academic tasks are related to their \nsuccessful engagement in that system, is echoed in literature looking at other higher \neducation contexts; for example, Mann\u201fs (2000) work on students\u201f experience of reading \nand Laurillard\u201fs (1997) work on problem solving.  This work, along with Hounsell\u201fs \n(1997) findings on students\u201f conceptions of essays and Light\u201fs (2002) on students\u201f \nconceptions of creative learning, seems to be part of a growing literature on students\u201f \nconceptions of academic tasks. When placed in the context of this literature on students\u201f \nconceptions of academic tasks, the current study begins to have implications for teaching \nand learning situations outside of the \u201eOxford Tutorial\u201f. For example, peer learning and \nICT systems are often suggested to offer ways of improving students\u201f learning because of \nthe individualised attention that they can offer students. In the case of peer learning, \nTopping (1996) argues that peer learning in reducing the student-to-peer tutor ratio offers \nincreased \u201etime on task\u201f and increases students\u201f opportunities to respond to their peer \ntutor and to have their errors corrected. However, the current study suggests that \nstudents\u201f conceptions of the academic task that they are engaged in will affect the way \nthey engage in it and the quality of their learning outcomes. Thus, in the case of peer \n  20 \nlearning and ICT-supported learning, the ways in which students understand these \nactivities will impact on the ways in which they engage in them and the quality of their \nlearning from their involvement in these activities. This suggests that any system of \ninstruction, whether individualised or group based, will still need to take account of \nstudents\u201f differing conceptions of their academic task and attempt to address them if they \nare to lead to higher quality student learning.  \n \nNotes \n1. An earlier version of this paper was presented in at the Improving Student \nLearning Symposium (Theory and Practice \u2013 10 Years On), Brussels, 4 \u2013 6 \nSeptember 2002. \n2. The words \u201etopic\u201f and \u201ematerial\u201f are used generically in this paper to denote the \nbody of knowledge that is the focus of a particular tutorial. \n3. This was defined based upon the University of Oxford\u201fs five divisions. Students \nfrom degree courses within the divisions of \u201eHumanities\u201f and \u201eSocial Sciences\u201f \nwere allocated to \u201eHumanities and Social Sciences\u201f, whilst students from degree \ncourses within \u201eMathematical and Physical Science\u201f, \u201eMedical Sciences\u201f and \n\u201eLife and Environmental Sciences\u201f were assigned to \u201eSciences\u201f. \n4. Of the 11 students in the first year of their studies six were from the Sciences and \nfive from the Humanities and Social Sciences. \n5.
