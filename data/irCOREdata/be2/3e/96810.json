Without economic\ngrowth there would be no profits, hence no\ntaxes, no public services, no pensions or\nstate benefits \u2014 and no research grants!\nJohn Wright \nDepartment of Earth Sciences, Open University,\nMilton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK\nDNA committee is model\nfor bioterrorism debate \nSir \u2014 There is much debate about how to\nprotect the public from bioterrorism while\nmaintaining the open exchange of\nbiomedical research findings (see, for\nexample, Nature 419, 99 and 769; 2002).\nThere have been several calls by scientists\nand science journalists in the media for a\n\u2018summit conference\u2019 to discuss these\nconcerns and to establish a US national\nforum to guide federal policy on scientific\nresearch with possible bioterrorism\napplications. \nFortunately, a highly effective model\nalready exists. The 1975 Asilomar\nconference led to the establishment of the\nNIH Recombinant DNA Advisory\nCommittee (RAC) to provide guidance\nand oversight of research using\nrecombinant DNA (see, for example, \nR. M. Atlas Science 298, 753\u2013754; 2002). \nPiecemeal regulation will harm the\nadvancement of science and wreak havoc\non national security. Already the US Office\nof Management and Budget is planning to\ndraft rules on the publication of some\nfederal research classified as \u201csensitive\nhomeland security information\u201d, but these\nrules will apply only to US government\nlaboratories. In testimony before the\nHouse of Representatives Science\nCommittee, several university officials said\nthe proposed new rules would not serve\nthe best interests of science. \nA broadly based committee modelled\non the RAC should be established now\nunder the aegis of the NIH to develop\nguidelines for biomedical research with\npossible bioterrorism applications. A\ncomparable committee should be formed\nin the US Department of Agriculture to\ndeal with agricultural research. An\ninteragency coordinating committee\nwould be needed for supervision on\nsecurity concerns related to government-\nsponsored research.\nAn agenda for an RAC-like committee\nhas been laid out by questions raised since\nlast year\u2019s anthrax attacks. First, should\naccess to genome databases be restricted?\nWould such restrictions prevent bio-\nterrorism? More than 60 microbial\ngenomes have already been deposited in\npublicly available genome databases and\nwork is actively progressing on more than\n150 more, as well as on several parasitic,\nfungal, plant and insect genomes. \nSecond, should scientists and scientific\npublishers practise self-censorship? For\nexample, we now know that live poliovirus\ncan be synthesized and that mail-order\ncompanies will provide the building-blocks\nnecessary to reconstruct the virus in a\nlaboratory. What, if any, restrictions on the\npublication of scientific findings are\nlegitimate? \nThird, should the training of scientists\nin the United States, whether US citizens\nor foreign nationals, be restricted? New \nUS legislation requires universities and\nlaboratories dealing with \u201cselect agents\u201d \nto be registered with the US Department \nof Health and Human Services or the \nUS Department of Agriculture and\nrequires individual scientists to submit to\nbackground checks by the Department of\nJustice. Will an increasingly perilous legal\nlandscape discourage legitimate scientists\nfrom engaging in research on infectious\ndiseases?\nThe RAC model has served us well in\nthe past; we should use it as the starting\npoint for addressing these key policy\nquestions to achieve effective and optimal\nguidance for the future.\nJoseph G. Perpich\nJG Perpich, LLC , 7315 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 500\nEast, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA\nModelling a new angle\non understanding cancer \nSir \u2014 There was a striking absence of\ndiscussion of quantitative methods in the\nrecent interesting theoretical debate on the\ntiming and nature of mutations\ncontrolling acquisition of the metastatic\nphenotype in invasive cancers (R. Bernards\nand R. A. Weinberg Nature 418, 823; 2002\nand Correspondence Nature 419, 559\u2013560;\n2002). Without the discipline imposed by\nmathematical rigour, the arguments have\nto rely on intuitive reasoning and small\npieces of data singled out from the vast\nextant literature. The reader is unable to\nindependently evaluate the hypotheses or\nunderstand them in the context of all\navailable experimental information \nor of theoretical models that organize\ninformation in integrally related\nphenomena such as carcinogenesis and\ntumour invasion. Although this state \nof affairs is normal in some disciplines\nsuch as tumour research, it would be\nunthinkable in the physical sciences.\nMedical investigators often eschew\nmathematical models as too \u201csimplistic\u201d\nfor the dynamics governing processes such\nas those in tumour biology. Instead, the\ngeneral underlying principles in complex\nbiological processes are expected to\nbecome apparent, as if by magic, once\nsufficient data are accumulated. Not\nsurprisingly, this passive approach has\nfailed to yield a comprehensive theoretical\nframework of understanding carcino-\ngenesis, tumour invasion and metastatic\nbehaviour. Clinical therapy thus remains\nlargely empirical, based more on trial and\nerror than a comprehensive understanding\nof biological first principles.\nIn most other scientific disciplines,\nthere is an active search for broad general-\nizations through hypotheses framed in\nmathematical models that can be examined\nfor internal consistency and compatibility\nwith extant data. Predictions from these\nmodels can be tested by experiment and\nrevised when necessary. Surely the success\nof this integrative approach, combining\nquantitative theoretical methods and\nexperiment in highly complex systems in\nphysics (including biophysics), chemistry,\nengineering and biological disciplines, such\nas ecology or structural biology, should\nmotivate its enthusiastic application to\nother nonlinear biological processes such\nas carcinogenesis and tumour invasion. \nIn the absence of consistent application\nof rigorous mathematical models,\ntheoretical medicine will largely remain\nempirical, phenomenological and\nanecdotal, successful only in linear systems\nthat can be defined by a single experiment or\na few experiments. Until the quantitative\nmethods of the physical sciences are applied,\nmany difficult and clinically important\nproblems in tumour biology, including the\ndynamics that give rise to the metastatic\nphenotype, will remain unresolved.\nRobert A.
