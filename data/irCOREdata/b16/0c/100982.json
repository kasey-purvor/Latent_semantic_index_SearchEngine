The rate of nanotube growth on this ternary oxide is greatly reduced as compared to\nthat of silicon dioxide and glass substrates enabling a high degree of control over nanotube height.\nThe strong potential of this nanostructured semitransparent substrate as an interpenetrating\nhole-extracting electrode in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells is also demonstrated. \u00a9 2007\nAmerican Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2431437\u0004\nIn recent years, organic solar cells have been the focus of\nsignificant research interest owing to their potential as a low\ncost path to harvesting energy from sunlight. At present, the\nefficiencies and lifetimes are inferior to their conventional\nsemiconductor counterparts and too low for commercial vi-\nability. To date, the most efficient low cost organic solar cells\nhave been built upon the bulk-heterojunction concept, com-\nprising phase separated blends of solution processed donor\nand acceptor molecules.1,2 Power conversion efficiencies as\nhigh as 5% under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination have\nbeen reported,1 with several reports showing that processing\nparameters such as drying time2,3 and postdeposition\nannealing1 are key to realizing high efficiency.\nOne of the limiting factors affecting power conversion\nefficiency is the low short circuit current density \u0001Jsc\u0002 which\nrelies on the ability of the photoactive material\u0001s\u0002 to effi-\nciently absorb photons, dissociate excitons, and transport\ncharge carriers to the respective electrodes. Disordered or-\nganic materials are, however, widely known for their poor\nexciton diffusion lengths and low charge carrier mobilities,4\nwhich seriously limit the Jsc. While the issue of short exciton\ndiffusion length is largely solved in bulk-heterojunction\nstructures exhibiting nanoscale phase separation,5 the low\ncharge carrier mobility\u2014particularly that of holes\u2014remains\na limiting factor. The simplest means of overcoming this\nproblem is to reduce the active layer thickness. Unfortu-\nnately this approach reduces the optical absorbance resulting\nin a commensurate reduction in the light harvesting capabil-\nity of the device.6 An alternative approach is the use of an\ninterpenetrating electrode which extends into the active or-\nganic layer, extracting charge carriers close to the point of\ngeneration.\nCarbon nanotubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 offer a possible route to real-\nizing high area, interpenetrating electrodes in organic solar\ncells. Multiwall carbon nanotubes \u0001MWCNTs\u0002 confined to\nthe donor layer of bilayer solar cells have been utilized as the\nhole-extracting electrode,7,8 where they have been shown to\nreduce cell series resistance and increase fill factor.8,9 Con-\nversely single wall carbon nanotubes \u0001SWCNTs\u0002 have been\nutilized as the electron acceptor and electron extracting elec-\ntrode in heterojunction organic solar cells.10,11 Freestanding\nSWCNT films have also been demonstrated as a low cost\nalternative to indium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002 glass in bulk-\nheterojunction organic solar cells.12\u201314\nThis letter reports the controlled growth of MWCNTs\ndirectly onto ITO coated glass using chemical vapor deposi-\ntion \u0001CVD\u0002 to realize large area electrodes with high optical\ntransparency suitable for organic solar cell applications. The\nprimary advantages of this approach over simply mixing\nMWCNTs with the active organic matrix are threefold: \u0001i\u0002\nthe MWCNTs are directly bonded to the ITO substrate en-\nhancing the mechanical stability of the contact; \u0001ii\u0002 this ap-\nproach guarantees that all MWCNTs are in direct contact\nwith the underlying ITO electrode ensuring a continuous\npathway to the external circuit; \u0001iii\u0002 since the MWCNTs are\nof controlled dimensions and are not randomly distributed\nwithin the active organic matrix it is possible to avoid prob-\nlems associated with electrical shorting, such that the\nMWCNTs penetrate the photoactive layer without compro-\nmising the integrity of the diode. Previous reports pertaining\nto CNT growth on ITO glass used a thick \u0001\u000515 nm\u0002 catalyst\nlayer rendering the substrate virtually opaque, and therefore\nunsuitable for optoelectronic applications. In addition to en-\nabling MWCNT growth on solid supports, CVD of MWCNT\nis arguably best suited to large area electronic applications\ndue to the ability to produce high yields with relatively few\nimpurities.\nDevices were fabricated on commercially sourced ITO\ncoated aluminosilicate glass \u00015\u201315 \u0001 sq\u22121\u0002 which ensured\nits resistance to the elevated temperature used during nano-\ntube growth. The ITO substrates were cleaned using a three\nstage ultrasonic cleaning procedure: toluene, an aqueous so-\nlution of decon-90, and acetone. Immediately prior to use,\nsubstrates were suspended in the vapor of refluxing acetone\nfollowed by microwave oxygen plasma treatment. A 5 nm\nfilm of nickel catalyst was sputter coated onto the ITO sub-\nstrates. MWCNTs were grown via acetylene pyrolysis at\n550 \u00b0C for 50 min at 0.68 Torr using hydrogen as the carrier\ngas. Substrates were allowed to cool to room temperature\nunder nitrogen before solar cell fabrication.\nPoly\u00013-hexylthiophene\u0002 \u0003P3HT\u0004:\u00036,6\u0004-phenyl-C61 butyric\nacid methyl ester \u0003PCBM\u0004 18 mg ml\u22121 :18 mg ml\u22121 blends in\n1,2-dichlorobenzene were spin cast at 650 rpm and allowed\nto dry for 1 h in a covered Petri dish.

Film thickness was moni-\ntored throughout deposition using a quartz crystal microbal-\nance. The photoactive device area was typically 8 mm2. De-\nvices were tested using an Oriel solar simulator under AM\n1.5 D spectral illumination of 100 mW cm\u22122 \u00011 sun\u0002 imme-\ndiately after device fabrication.\nThe growth of CNTs on ITO glass was very sensitive to\nthe catalyst layer thickness. A minimum Ni layer thickness of\n\u00055 nm was required to achieve growth due to the rapid dif-\nfusion of Ni into the polycrystalline ITO substrate at the\ntemperatures required for acetylene pyrolysis. Notably, we\nalso observe that the rate of CNT growth on ITO was very\nmuch slower than that of glass substrates, as shown in Fig.\n1\u0001a\u0002. We suggest that this is due to the contamination of the\nNi catalyst by In and Sn from the underlying ITO, since ITO\nglass is known to contaminate the active organic layers in\norganic light-emitting diodes with these metals,15 neither of\nwhich are known to catalyze CNT growth. This reduced\ngrowth rate is advantageous in the present context since it\nenables the very high degree of control over CNT height\nrequired for utility in organic solar cells \u0001\u0002200 nm\u0002.\nThe scanning electron microscopy \u0001SEM\u0002 image in Fig.\n1\u0001b\u0002 and cross-sectional image in Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002 show that the\nMWCNTs grow in an unorientated fashion on ITO to form a\ndense mat. The transmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002 im-\nages in Fig. 2 confirm the multiwall, defective structure of\nthe CNTs. For the current application, defective MWCNTs\nare ideal since MWCNTs are intrinsically metallic in nature\nand the defective structure is expected to facilitate adherence\nto the adjacent organic semiconductor. Figures 1\u0001c\u0002 and 2\u0001a\u0002\nalso show that the MWCNTs are sufficiently short so that\nthey penetrate extensively into the P3HT:PCBM layer with-\nout extending all the way to the counter-electrode.\nThe optical transmission of the ITO substrate, a 5 nm\nnickel coated ITO substrate and the substrate after MWCNT\ngrowth are shown in Fig. 3. The optical transmission of the\nITO coated aluminosilicate glass at the maximum absorption\nof the P3HT:PCBM blend: \u0005550 nm, was \u000590%. The trans-\nmission of the Ni coated substrate and MWCNT coated sub-\nstrates at the same wavelength were \u000575% and \u000560%, re-\nspectively. Despite the \u000530% reduction in the light intensity\nreaching the P3HT:PCBM layer in the cell incorporating\nMWCNTs, as compared to cells utilizing unmodified ITO\nglass, Jsc remains unchanged at \u00054 mA\/cm2. This result\ncannot be attributed to a difference in the thickness of the\nP3HT:PCBM layer, which was measured to be \u0005150 nm in\nall cell structures using cross-sectional SEM and profilom-\netry. This is compelling evidence that the loss in efficiency\ndue to the 30% reduction in light entering the cell is offset by\nefficient hole extraction by the large area interpenetrating\nelectrode. It is possible that geometric electric field enhance-\nment at the MWCNT ends and sidewalls\u2014estimated to be as\nmuch as four times the built-in electric field\u2014may facilitate\nenhanced hole extraction. In addition, the 50%\u201360% increase\nin the \u201cnanotextured\u201d area of the MWCNT-ITO glass com-\nposite electrode, as compared to planar ITO glass, reduces\nthe average distance holes need to travel before extraction to\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 SEM image showing that MWCNTs grow very slowly on ITO as\ncompared to the growth rate on glass under identical growth conditions\n\u00014 min, 550 \u00b0C, 2 nm Ni\u0002; \u0001b\u0002 SEM image showing the uniform coverage of\nMWCNTs on ITO grown under optimized growth conditions \u000150 min,\n550 \u00b0C, 5 nm Ni\u0002; \u0001c\u0002 Cross-sectional SEM of MWCNT mat shown in \u0001b\u0002.\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 TEM image showing an individual MWCNT removed from the\nITO substrate. \u0001b\u0002 A higher magnification TEM image of \u0001a\u0002 where the\ngraphitic fringes can be observed.\nFIG. 3.

The combination of these two effects is likely to\ncompensate for the 30% loss in light absorption and clearly\npoints the way to improve charge transfer efficiencies in fu-\nture cells.\nThe inclusion of MWCNTs into the cell structure re-\nsulted in a very small \u0001\u00050.05 V\u0002 decrease in Voc as com-\npared to cells utilizing unmodified ITO glass. This is consis-\ntent with the comparable work function of MWCNTs\n\u0001\u00054.3 eV\u0002 \u0001Ref. 16\u0002 and the microwave plasma treated ITO\nglass, measured in our laboratory using ultraviolet photo-\nemission spectroscopy to be \u00054.4 eV \u0003Fig. 4 \u0001inset\u0002\u0004. De-\nvices fabricated with a 5 nm Ni layer on the ITO surface\nexhibited a large \u0001\u00050.2 V\u0002 reduction in Voc. This result is\nsomewhat counterintuitive since Ni would be expected to\nincrease Voc on account of its relatively high work function\n\u0001\u00054.7 eV\u0002. However, since abrupt negative vacuum level\nshifts at metal-organic interface are known to modify the\ninterfacial energy level alignment by as much as 1.5 eV,17\nthis result it is not entirely unexpected. Notably, Fig. 4 also\nshows that Jsc is essentially independent of Voc.\nThe fill factor \u00010.47\u0002 and overall efficiency \u00010.93%\u0002 of\nMWCNT devices were reduced as compared to the reference\n\u0001fill factor=0.61, efficiency=1.37%\u0002, largely due to a reduc-\ntion in cell shunt resistance. From the gradient of the fourth\nquadrant response where it crosses the y axis, it is evident\nthat this reduction in power conversion efficiency can be\nattributed to a reduction in cell shunt resistance. We suggest\nthat through the judicious selection of an appropriate elec-\ntron injection buffer layer,18 this small reduction in shunt\nresistance is likely to be greatly reduced in optimized cell\nstructures.\nIn summary, we report the growth of MWCNTs directly\nonto ITO coated glass using CVD to realize large area elec-\ntrodes with high optical transparency. Crucially, the\nMWCNT growth rate is much slower than on glass or silica\nenabling a high degree of control over nanotube dimensions.\nWe have also demonstrated the utility of this nanostructured\nelectrode as efficient hole-extracting electrodes in organic\nsolar cells. Importantly, the transparency of this electrode is\nhighest at longer wavelengths, making it well matched to the\nsolar spectrum. With the ability to pattern substrates with\ncatalyst particles and to tailor ordered and vertically aligned\narrays of CNTs, it is envisaged that this approach is a prom-\nising path to enhancing the efficiency of bulk-heterojunction\norganic solar cells.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the EPSRC for\nfunding via the Portfolio Partnership scheme and Damitha\nAdikkari and Vlad Stolojan for their help with sputtering and\nTEM, respectively.\n1M.
