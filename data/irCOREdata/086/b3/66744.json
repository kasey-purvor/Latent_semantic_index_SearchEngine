Multiaxial compression .\n41 Concrete . Elevated temperature\n42Introduction\n43The lack of a comprehensive database of stress and\n44strain measurements on structural concrete under true\n45multiaxial compression is one of the main obstacles\n46preventing the development of reliable constitutive\n47models for this important engineering material. Cur-\n48rent design methods typically assume that the concrete\n49in a column, beam or slab-like structural member is\n50under essentially a uniaxial state of stress. The one-\n51dimensional stress-strain relationship under such con-\n52ditions is often idealised as following a parabolic form,\n53broadly fitting data from uniaxial compression tests.\n54However, in many safety-critical structures (such as\n55nuclear reactor vessels, nuclear containment vessels,\n56offshore platforms and arch-gravity dams) the stress\n57state is most certainly not uniaxial throughout. Engi-\n58neering precision and understanding is lost when the\n59effects of confinement and the deformation behaviour\n60in the other two principal directions are ignored.\n61Furthermore, a constitutive model embracing the full\n62three-dimensional behaviour is a requirement when\n63attempting accurate continuum FE simulations.\n64Although the differences between the uniaxial and\n65biaxial compressive strengths are not so marked, the\n66fracture modes can be quite different [1-3]. Yet it is\n67when all three principal stresses are compressive that\n68very significant differences in strength, deformation and\n69apparent ductility are seen. Most of the knowledge on\n70the behaviour of concrete under multiaxial compression\n71has been gathered from axisymmetric triaxial tests on\n72cylindrical specimens. Triaxial rigs using the Hoek cell\n73[4], originally developed for testing rock, provide\n74simple and inexpensive devices that have proved pop-\n75ular for researchers investigating the response of con-\n76crete under confinement [5\u20137].

The strains he\n81 measured at peak stress were over 57 times larger than\n82 those seen under uniaxial compression. The triaxial cell\n83 tests performed by Jamet et al. [9] showed that with the\n84 increase of confinement the post-peak behaviour of\n85 micro-concrete gradually changed from brittle to duc-\n86 tile. Similar change in behaviour was observed in tests\n87 on concretes with three different strengths carried out\n88 in the Colorado triaxial cell [10]. These tests indicated\n89 that for higher strength concretes the transition from\n90 brittle to ductile behaviour occurred at higher levels of\n91 confinement. In 1999 Lee and Ansari [11] calibrated\n92 their constitutive model using data from tests on high-\n93 strength concrete in a cell allowing up to 83 MPa con-\n94 finement and 574 MPa axial stress. In 2002 Sfer et al.\n95 [12] tested larger (150 mm diameter, 300 mm long)\n96 cylinders in a triaxial cell with a capacity of 4.5 MN axial\n97 load and 140 MPa confinement pressure. These tests\n98 confirmed the transition from brittle to ductile behav-\n99 iour and suggested that with the increase of confine-\n100 ment the rupture mode changed from a diffuse\n101 distribution of microcracks to a mechanism involving\n102 fewer macrocracks separating the specimen into two or\n103 three blocks. This was in contrast to the earlier findings\n104 of Newman, which suggests that a particular care is n-\n105 eeded in interpreting the effects of the boundary cond-\n106 itions at the specimen-platen interface. Other triaxial\n107 cells introducing improvements of the original Hoek\n108 Cell design include the facilities in Milan and Bergamo\n109 [13] and the recently developed GIGA triaxial cell in\n110 Grenoble, a rig capable of delivering up to 2500 MPa\n111 axial stress on 70 mm diameter, 140 mm long cylindrical\n112 specimen, at confinements of up to 850 MPa [14].\n113 While providing important information on the effect\n114 of confinement, the triaxial cells are constrained to\n115 operate on the compression and extension meridians\n116 (that is, the Lode angle is either \u00fe\u0002=6 or \u0001\u0002=6). The\n117 first efforts in true multiaxial compression testing of\n118 concrete were made over thirty-five years ago by\n119 researchers at the University of New Mexico [15].\n120 They developed an apparatus comprising three inde-\n121 pendent frames with rigid platens, using polyethylene\n122 pads and grease to reduce the platen constraint.\n123 Manually operated, pressure controlled actuators with\n124 a load capacity of 270 kN were used to test 57 mm cubic\n125 specimens under stresses of up to 105 MPa. These\n126 findings were valuable, although comparisons with\n127 conventional triaxial results suggested that the New\n128 Mexico rig did not adequately remove platen friction. In\n129 the most comprehensive study of concrete under true\n130multiaxial compression, Scavuzzo [16] performed 67\n131tests in a fluid platen rig at the University of Colorado.\n132In addition to simple triaxial compression, triaxial\n133extension and multiaxial compression with three differ-\n134ent principal stresses, the cubic specimens were tested\n135under cyclic, staircase, piecewise-uniaxial and circular\n136loading paths. However, the Colorado stress-controlled\n137rig was unable to capture any possible strain softening\n138in the material. The stress range of this impressive\n139apparatus was further limited by the use of leather pads\n140inserted between the fluid cushions and the concrete\n141specimens, which led to stress concentration and de-\n142velopment of diagonal cracks near the corners of the\n143specimens at relatively low stress levels. It was at the\n144University of Eindhoven that the post-peak response of\n145conventional structural concrete was captured using\n146brush platens within a rig employing three suspended\n147independent loading frames [17]. Although only a few\n148experiments close to the biaxial regime were reported,\n149that careful work clarified the role of local fragmenta-\n150tion and macroscopic dilation on the loss of load-\n151carrying capacity. The results obtained from using\n152different boundary conditions in the Eindhoven rig\n153suggested that PTFE-coated platens provided the\n154lowest friction restraint in the post-peak region [18].\n155If there exists limited multiaxial data under ambient\n156conditions, then the position is far worse under\n157elevated temperature. The majority of the experiments\n158performed on hot specimens have been restricted to\n159uniaxial compression. The exceptions are the biaxial\n160studies performed in Braunschweig [19, 20] and the\n1618 torsional confined cylinder tests at Northwestern\n162University [21]. In the latter tests, the aim was to\n163identify the short-term creep response under controlled\n164moisture conditions at temperatures of up to 200oC.\n165Cylindrical specimens with 152 mm diameter were\n166loaded under axial compression (< 10 MPa), lateral\n167confinement (< 10 MPa) and torsionally induced shear\n168(< 4 MPa). Although these experiments were operat-\n169ing in the relatively low-stress range, the apparatus has\n170the capacity to deliver an axial load of 5 MN, a torque\n171of 5.6 kNm and a fluid cell pressure of 138 MPa.\n172This lack of data on concrete under high levels of\n173multiaxial compression at elevated temperature led to\n174the development of mac2T, the new experimental rig at\n175The University of Sheffield (Fig. 1).\n176Test Facility for Multi-Axial Compression of Concrete\n177at Elevated Temperature (mac2T)\n178The apparatus for Multi-Axial Compression of Con-\n179crete at Elevated Temperature (maccet ! mac2T; pro-\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n180 nounced masset) was designed to satisfy four key testing\n181 criteria:\n182 (i) Multiaxial compression of 100 mm cubic speci-\n183 mens up to 400 MPa at any Lode angle\n184 (\u00011 6\u00bc \u00012 6\u00bc \u00013 ). Delivery of stresses up to 400\n185 MPa was required to allow structural concretes\n186 of the type used in existing nuclear power plant\n187 reactor and containment vessels (typical uniaxial\n188 compressive strength fc =50\u201360 MPa) to be\n189 loaded to peak under high levels of hydrostatic\n190 confinement (over 100 MPa). The specimen size\n191 was fixed at 100 mm to ensure that a represen-\n192 tative volume was tested when using 20 mm\n193 coarse aggregate. These constraints led to a\n194 design solution incorporating three independent\n195 loading frames each of 4 MN load capacity.\n196 (ii) Ability to test in the post-peak range. Valuable\n197 information on the effective ductility and frac-\n198 ture energy can be obtained by monitoring the\n199 post-peak response. However, once the maxi-\n200 mum stress is attained, there can be a sudden\n201 release of energy stored in the loading frames\n202 and the specimen. This can lead to an uncontrol-\n203 lable disintegration of the specimen, with loss of\n204 load and displacement measurements. In mac2T\n205 this effect was minimised by using a combination\n206 of compact, stiff loading frames (reducing the\n207 elongation of the tensile bars and bending of the\n208crossheads) and a fast, displacement-controlled\n209servo-hydraulic system that is able to unload the\n210actuators rapidly as the specimen fragments. A\n211disadvantage of rigs where displacements are\n212measured using strain gages bonded to the spec-\n213imen surface (typical for triaxial cells) is that the\n214large cracks that develop in the post-peak range\n215can fracture the gauges, or local spalling occurs\n216leaving the gauge intact but useless in terms of\n217capturing the global response. This is avoided in\n218mac2T by using un-interruptible laser interferom-\n219eters that allow an accurate, continuous displace-\n220ment signal throughout the test.\n221(iii) Multiaxial compression at temperatures up to\n222300oC. The high temperature practically elimi-\n223nates the fluid platen option and introduces addi-\n224tional requirements on the data acquisition\n225system, such as minimising the effects of temper-\n226ature variations on strain measurement. In mac2T\n227the loading platens are made of temperature re-\n228sistant steel (Durehete 1055, 20CrMoVTiB4-10),\n229whereas the thermal effects on the strain mea-\n230surements are minimised by using a contactless,\n231laser interferometer system.\n232(iv) Complex multi-stage experiments following arbi-\n233trary pre-programmed loading paths with simul-\n234taneous temperature cycling. This requirement\n235reflects the desire to generate experimental data\n236for calibrating generalised 3D models able to sim-\n237ulate the response of the material to any combi-\n238nation of loading paths and temperature histories.\n239This was achieved by a custom built system for\n240data acquisition and control with dedicated con-\n241trol software specially developed to meet this\n242requirement.\n243Other important design requirements were: (v) to\n244minimise the friction on the platen-specimen interface,\n245and (vi) to ensure that the three stresses are delivered\n246centrally on the six faces of the specimen.\n247Loading and Load Measurement\n248The load in mac2T is delivered by three 4 MN hydraulic\n249actuators installed in independent, diagonally inter-\n250laced loading frames (Fig. 2). This design was chosen to\n251minimise the snap-back potential of the loading frames\n252without increasing the demand on the unloading speed\n253of the servo-hydraulic control system. The high stiff-\n254ness of the frames was achieved by keeping the tensile\n255bars and the crossheads as short as possible, while\n256allowing sufficient room for the specimen to be installed\n257and removed. Each frame comprises two 200 mm\nFig. 1. mac2T apparatus for multiaxial compression of concrete at\nelevated temperature\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n258 diameter steel tensile bars and two 550 mm thick, rolled\n259 steel crossheads, one solid, used as a reaction block\n260 (supporting the load cell), the other containing the fluid\n261 chamber for the hydraulic actuator (Fig. 3). This rep-\n262 resents an alternative design solution to that adopted in\n263 the six-actuator 250 kN ASTREE apparatus at LMT-\n264 Cachan [22].\n265 The load to the specimen is delivered by 200 mm\n266 diameter rams, through a system of cooling, heating\n267 and loading platens. In each test, a set of six new 1 mm\n268thick steel tiles with 0.25 mm PTFE pads are placed\n269between the loading platens and the concrete speci-\n270men to reduce friction-induced shear stresses at the\n271interface. The loading platens have a spherical seat\n272arrangement to accommodate minor departures in the\n273specimen from a right-regular cube. The 95 mm square\n274loading surface is smaller than the surface of the\n275specimen to prevent contact between adjacent loading\n276platens.\n277One of the actuators (X) has a 180 mm stroke which,\n278when fully retracted, leaves enough space for installing\n279and removing the specimen. The stroke of the other two\n280actuators is 60 mm. The pressure in the system is\n281provided by a 30 MPa hydraulic power unit, which can\n282generate loads up to 3.61 MN (or \u0001 \u00bc 400 MPa over a\n28395 \u0002 95mm2 area).\n284A nominally uniform stress field in a (homogenous)\n285specimen can only be achieved by (i) eliminating the\n286friction on the platen-specimen interface, (ii) ensuring\n287that the central axes of the loading platens always\n288cross at the centroid of the specimen and (iii) using\n289precisely machined, right regular cubic specimens. In\n290previous rigid-platen rigs the friction has been reduced\n291by using either greased polyethylene pads (New Mexico\n292[15]) or brush platens (Eindhoven [17]). Polyethylene\n293pads cannot sustain the high temperature levels\n294required in mac2T and, although brush platens have\n295been successfully applied in high-temperature testing\n296(in the biaxial Braunschweig rig [19]), they would not\n297be suitable for post-peak testing where large post-\n298peak deformations may lead to bending and buckling\nFig. 2. mac2T loading frames and 4th actuator\nFig. 3. Cross-section of loading\nframe X\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n299 of the brushes. PTFE remains stable at temperatures\n300 up to 400oC, with very little change in the friction coef-\n301 ficient for temperatures between 20oC and 327oC . The\n302 0.25 mm PTFE pads, eventually selected for mac2T,\n303 showed no signs of damage at temperatures up to 300oC\n304 and stresses of up to 330 MPa.\n305 It would be inappropriate to attempt a highly de-\n306 tailed FE prediction of the actual stress field operat-\n307 ing within a specimen, as the heterogeneity resulting\n308 from the stiff aggregate particles (of unknown posi-\n309 tion) creates local stress gradients that mask any non-\n310 uniform effects from the platen-specimen contact. The\n311 decision taken here (common to all such multiaxial ex-\n312 perimental work with structural concrete) has been to\n313 report nominal stress and strain measures when pre-\n314 senting the results.\n315 Eccentric loading is prevented by supporting the\n316 two horizontal frames (X and Y) on low friction roller\n317 bearings, which allow free movement of the crossheads\n318 in the horizontal plane. Movement of the centroid of\n319 the specimen in the vertical direction (as a result of\n320 elastic deformations of the load cell, platens and\n321 loading frame) is prevented by active control of the\n322 vertical loading frame (Z) position during the tests.\n323 This is achieved by an array of 4 linked servo-hydraulic\n324 actuators (collectively known as the 4th actuator,\n325 installed beneath the Z frame (see Fig. 2) and con-\n326 trolled by the difference in the displacements mea-\n327 sured at the opposite faces of the specimen. This\n328 system contrasts with the ASTREE rig at LMT-\n329 Cachan [22], where an actuator and a load cell are\n330 used to control\/monitor the position\/load on each side\n331 of the specimen. mac2T lifts\/lowers the entire Z frame\n332 to ensure that the specimen centroid remains at the\n333 same position within the laboratory throughout the\n334 test. Differences in the axial forces from one side of\n335 the specimen to the other are minimised through the\n336 use of the low friction membranes at the platen-\n337 specimen interfaces.\n338 The crossheads of the X and Y load frames are\n339 supported on 4 reinforced concrete seats bolted to a\n340 heavily reinforced concrete slab (Fig. 4). The effects of\n341 vibrations induced by machinery operating in the\n342 laboratory are reduced by supporting the slab on three\n343 columns founded at the lower level (basement) and\n344 completely isolated from the floor. Two reinforced\n345 concrete columns and an upper crossbeam support\n346 vertical guides which keep the Z frame in a vertical\n347 plane during re-positioning by the 4th actuator.\n348 The applied forces are measured by using three 4\n349 MN rated, high precision (\u00034 kN) load cells, installed\n350 on the reaction side of each frame. These are low-\n351 profile (150 mm), shear-type, 400 mm diameter units,\n352each equipped with two full-bridge strain gauge\n353arrangements. The signal from each bridge is acquired\n354independently and then averaged to provide the\n355process variable for the closed-loop control system\n356(when an axis is under load control). The three load\n357cells are calibrated in the rig, using a separate 3.5 MN\n358load cell, which is itself regularly calibrated at the UK\n359National Physical Laboratory.\n360Displacement and Strain Measurement\n361Positioning of the actuators, all the strain measure-\n362ments and the strain control during the tests are\n363realised by using a system of 6 laser interferometer\n364units. Each unit comprises a laser head (Hewlett\n365Packard, model 5529), a linear interferometer, a linear\n366retro-reflector and a programmable PC calibrator\n367board installed in a dedicated (slave) PC.\n368The retro-reflectors are installed in 18 mm diameter\n369stainless steel tubes, evacuated to 10\u00015 bar, inserted in\n370the 25 mm diameter holes which run through the\n371actuator rams and platens (Fig. 5), as well as through\n372the load cells and crossheads on the reaction side. The\n373vacuum is necessary to reduce turbulent movement of\n374hot air which disturbs the laser beams and may\n375interrupt the measurements. At the specimen end of\n376each of these tubes there is a 5 mm diameter steel pin,\n377which protrudes through the loading platens (including\n378the 1 mm protective steel tile and 0.25 mm PTFE pad)\n379and contacts the face of the specimen directly. Within\n380the tube, the retro-reflector is secured in position at a\n381distance of 47 mm from the tip of the pin. It is just over\nFig. 4. mac2T load frames and supports\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n382 this length that thermal expansions and contractions of\n383 the pin and the tube have to be calibrated-out during\n384 the heating\/cooling phases of a test. This setup gives\n385 more accurate and reliable results than systems in\n386 which the strains are calculated from displacements\n387 measured at the ends of long rods [19, 20].\n388 This system is capable of measuring large displace-\n389 ments with 10\u00016 m accuracy, making it suitable for\n390 positioning of the actuators (controlling up to 150 mm\n391 of pre-contact movement) and the vertical frame (using\n392 the 4th actuator) as well as for strain measurements and\n393 strain control during the tests (with displacement rates\n394 as low as 10\u00015m \u0004 min\u00011). In both cases the values ob-\n395 tained from the displacement measurement system are\n396 used to calculate the process variables for the servo-\n397 control system. Strains in the specimen are calculated\n398 from the difference between the displacements mea-\n399 sured on the opposite faces of the specimen.\n400 Heating and Cooling\n401 Heat in the rig is generated by a set of six 240 W\n402 ceramic band heaters wrapped around the 140 mm\n403 diameter steel heating platens [Fig. 5(a)]. Heat is\n404 transferred by conduction through the Durehete 1055\n405 (20CrMoVTiB4-10) steel loading platens to the speci-\n406mens. The load-cell and actuator are kept cool by\n407flushing cold water through a network of holes cross-\n408drilled through the 200 mm diameter steel cooling\n409platens [Fig. 5(a)].\n410Data Acquisition and Control\n411The system for data acquisition and control of mac2T\n412is integrated into a PC-based solution built around\n413National Instruments hardware and MCC (mac2T\n414Control Centre), a dedicated LabVIEW program for\n415data acquisition and control developed by the first\n416author. The master PC used in the tests is a dual Athlon\n4172 GHz platform equipped with one 24 bit digital input\/\n418output board (DIO), two 16 bit multifunction boards\n419(MIO) and one 12 bit analogue output module (AO).\n420All tests in mac2T are monitored by using a total\n421of 49 sensors: (i) 3 load cells (each with 2 indepen-\n422dently monitored full-bridge sensor arrangements),\n423(ii) 6 laser interferometer systems for displacement\n424measurement (both position and specimen deforma-\n425tion), (iii) 1 pressure transducer for monitoring the\n426pressure in the 4th actuator, (iv) 6 linear variable\n427displacement transducers (LVDTs) used as a backup\n428displacement measurement system, (v) 6 LVDTs\n429used to monitor the position of the crossheads and\nFig. 5 System for strain measurement\nand displacement control: (a) platens\nwith installed vacuum tubes,\n(b) mounting of lasers and (c) schematic\ndiagram of laser interferometer system\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n430 (vi) 24 K-type thermocouples installed on the heating\n431 platens (4 per platen).\n432 The signals from all analogue devices (LVDTs, load\n433 cell bridges, pressure transducer and thermocouples)\n434 are first conditioned, then passed to the analogue IO\n435 boards where they are converted into digital data at a\n436 rate of 500 samples\u0004s\u00011 (multiplexed over 43 channels).\n437 In MCC, the acquired data are then averaged in\n438 packages of 100 samples at a time. The signals from\n439 the laser interferometers are generated as digital data\n440 by the six PC calibrator boards installed in the slave\n441 PC and transferred to the master PC by the means of\n442 digital IO communication controlled from MCC.\n443 The averaged input values and the test control param-\n444 eters are used for calculating the control variables in the\n445 PID (proportional, integral, derivative) modules in\n446 MCC. The program outputs are the values of the\n447 signals to be sent to the 4 actuator servo-valves and\n448 6 temperature controllers. The analogue (voltage)\n449 signals are generated by four 16-bit D\/A converters of\n450 the MIO boards, for the actuators, and six 12-bit D\/A\n451 converters of the AO module, for the control of the\n452 heaters.\n453 Operation of the Rig\n454 The process of acquiring the data, averaging the\n455 values, calculating the control variable and sending\n456 the control signal to the servo-valve or temperature\n457 controller represents a fully closed control loop. The\n458 mac2T rig is operated by 10 independent control loops:\n459 3 for the main actuators, 1 for the 4th actuator and 6 for\n460 the temperature controllers. The actual time for clos-\n461 ing the loops depends on the ratio between the sam-\n462 pling rate and the number of averages (0.1 s, for the\n463 current hardware and software configuration).\n464 In essence, the operation of the rig is controlled by\n465 defining three sets of parameters for each of the four\n466 actuators: (i) control mode, (ii) process variable (PV),\n467 and (iii) rate of change of the PV; and the rate of\n468 change of the PV for the temperature controllers.\n469 Control Loops\n470 The three load frame actuators can be operated in\n471 either load (LC) or displacement control (DC) mode.\n472 The process variable for load control is the load L\n473 calculated as an average of the readings from the two\n474 bridges of each load cell. The displacement control can\n475 be performed by using one of the three different values\n476 as process variables: (i) V-the laser measurements of\n477 the actuator position, (ii) dV-the laser measurements\n478of the specimen deformation (difference between the\n479displacements measured at the two opposite faces of\n480the specimen), and (iii) U-the LVDT measurements of\n481the position of the actuators. The diagram of the\n482control loops is shown in Fig. 6.\n483The V-control is used for positioning the actuators\n484before the beginning of the tests (loading) and after the\n485completion of the tests (unloading). The dV-control is\n486used for displacement control during the tests. The\n487U-control is used in a backup (safety) procedure that is\n488automatically triggered in case any of the laser signals is\n489interrupted. Each load frame is controlled indepen-\n490dently, which means that each of the actuators can be\n491under L, V, dV or U-control, regardless of the control\n492mode of the others.\n493The 4th actuator only operates in displacement con-\n494trol, using one of the three process variables. The six\n495heaters are controlled independently with process\n496variables obtained as average values of the temperature\n497measurements obtained from the 4 thermocouples\n498installed on each of the 6 heating platens.\n499Modes of Operation and Test Stages\n500The MCC software is designed to provide two basic\n501modes of operation of the rig: (i) interactive and (ii)\n502automatic. In the interactive mode, the operator con-\n503trols the rig either by manually setting the control pa-\n504rameters (control modes, PV and rates) for each\n505actuator and temperature controller, or by activating a\n506range of different pre-programmed procedures. In the\n507automatic mode, the program reads an input file at the\n508beginning of the test and performs a series of opera-\n509tions, without the need for further intervention from\n510the operator. The automatic procedure can always be\n511overridden by the operator and switched into interac-\n512tive mode.\nFig. 6. Operation of mac2T: diagram of control loops\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n513 The changes between the control modes are bump-\n514 less and can be performed at any time during the\n515 execution of the test as prescribed by the input file,\n516 triggered by the MCC automatically (in case of certain,\n517 pre-programmed conditions) or by the operator (in\n518 interactive mode). The process variables and rates for\n519 each control loop can be also prescribed in the input\n520 file, defined by the operator during the test or triggered\n521 by the MCC automatically.\n522 Each test is performed in three stages: (i) loading,\n523 (ii) testing, and (iii) unloading. Once the specimen is\n524 installed in the rig, the operator activates the auto-\n525 matic loading procedure in which the Z frame is lifted\n526 into position and the three actuators are extended until\n527 the specimen is loaded to contact stress (pre-defined,\n528 typically 0.5\u20131.0 MPa) in all three directions, first Z,\n529 then X and finally Y. During this stage, the movement\n530 of the Z-frame (4th actuator) and the three loading\n531 actuators is controlled by displacements (V-control)\n532 with rates decreasing gradually as the platens approach\n533 the specimen. Once the contact stress is detected in\n534 any of the three directions, the control of that actuator\n535 switches to load and the rate of the process variable is\n536 set to zero. When all axes are in load control the\n537 operator can start the testing stage. Similarly, when the\n538 test is finished, the unloading procedure starts by\n539 switching the controls to displacement (V) and retract-\n540 ing the actuators in a reverse order: Y, X, Z and finally\n541 the 4th actuator, until the Z-frame rests on its base.\n542 In the testing stage the three main actuators are\n543 either under load or dV-control, with load\/displace-\n544 ment rates prescribed by the pre-programmed test\n545 procedure or set by the operator. The 4th actuator is\n546 always in dV-control, with variable displacement rates\n547 calculated by an MCC module programmed to keep\n548 the centroid of the specimen at the same level with the\n549 horizontal loading axes during the tests.\n550 Programmed Test Sequences\n551 All mac2T tests can be composed by using six test\n552 sequences (procedures) programmed in MCC. Each se-\n553 quence contains predefined criteria. When these criteria\n554 are met, the sequence is completed and the program\n555 moves on to the next sequence. The modular structure\n556 of the program allows other sequences to be added in\n557 the future.\n558 The load cycling in each test is performed by using\n559 one of the three different loading\/unloading proce-\n560 dures: 3LC, 1DC or 2DC.\n561 1. The 3LC procedure, in which the three main\n562 actuators are controlled independently in load\n563control, is used for loading\/unloading under spec-\n564ified stress conditions at a safe distance from the\n565peak nominal stress (PNS) surface. The sequence\n566is completed when the load in one axis (leader)\n567reaches a pre-defined level.\n5682. 1DC is a procedure in which one axis (\u00011) is under\n569displacement control with a prescribed displace-\n570ment rate (RD), whereas the other two axes are in\n571load control, following \u00011 at preset ratios \u00032 and \u00033.\n572The change of \u00011 is monitored at regular time in-\n573tervals (tc), and, assuming that the stress rate re-\n574mains unchanged during two successive intervals\n575($ \u0001i\u00fe11 \u00bc $ \u0001i1), the loading rates for the other two\n576directions (k \u00bc 2; 3 ) are calculated as: Rk \u00bc\n577\u00bd\u0003k\u00f0\u0001i1 \u00fe $ \u0001i1\u00de \u0001 \u0001ik\u0005=\u00f0tcA\u00de; where A is the loading\n578area. This procedure is used for experiments in\n579which one stress (\u00011) is close to the peak, such as\n580triaxial compression (\u00011 > \u00012 \u00bc \u00013), or tests in which\n581the three stresses are different (\u00011 > \u00012 > \u00013).\n5823. 2DC is similar to the 1DC procedure, but with two\n583leader axes in displacement control (with pre-\n584scribed rates RD1 and RD2) and one in load con-\n585trol. The loading rate in the third axis is\n586calculated in the same way as that in the 1DC\n587procedure, but with the stress rate taken as an\n588average of the stress increments measured in the\n589two leader axes.\n590This procedure is used for close-to-peak testing\n591near the extension meridian, where the stresses in\n592two directions are similar while the stress in the\n593third direction decreases or remains constant\n594(\u00011 \u0006 \u00012 > \u00013).\n595The two DC procedures are used for testing\n596close to peak and in the post-peak region. They are\n597not suitable for lower stress levels where the\n598specimen is still relatively stiff and even low\n599displacement rates in the leader axes can produce\n600high loading rates in the load-controlled axes,\n601possibly resulting in serious over\/under shooting\n602of the PID controllers and, ultimately, to loss of\n603control. The execution of the DC sequences is\n604controlled by setting limits to the values of (i) the\n605loading stiffness S \u00bc $\u00011=$ \"1 and (ii) ratio be-\n606tween the current stress and the maximum stress\n607recorded during the sequence \u0004 \u00bc \u00011= \u0001^1; calculated\n608for the leader axis (or average of the two leader\n609axes in 2DC) at the end of intervals with a pre-\n610defined duration tc. The limit of the stress ratio \u0004\n611is always set between 0 and 1. If Slim > 0, then the\n612sequence is terminated when S < Slim , before the\n613specimen starts softening (pre-peak tests). If\n614Slim < 0, then the sequence is terminated when the\n615stress \u00011 drops below \u0004lim \u0001^1 (post-peak tests).\nExp Mech (2006)\nSEM\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nEC\nTE\nD\nPR\nO\nO\nF\n616 Stress probing procedures are test sequences in\n617 which the specimen is loaded\/unloaded by a small\n618 stress (typically $ \u0001P \u00bc 2 \u0001 3MPa )in each of the\n619 three directions, while the strains in the other two\n620 directions are kept constant. The results are used\n621 to determine the values of the tangent stiffness and\n622 elastic unloading stiffness matrices of the material\n623 for a given stress state (at the start of the probing\n624 procedure).\n625 4. P3LC is a stress probing procedure in which the\n626 three stress probes are performed in load control.\n627 When the stress in the probing direction i increases\n628 by $ \u0001Pii ; the strain in this direction changes to\n629 \"i \u00fe $ \"Pii . The strains in the other two directions are\n630 kept constant ($ \"Pij \u0006 $ \"Pik \u0006 0) while the stresses\n631 change by $ \u0001Pij and $\u0001\nPi\nk ; as shown in Fig. 7(a).\n632 When the three probes are completed the tangent\n633 stiffness matrix D is calculated from the stress and\n634 strain increments measured during the loading\n635 parts of the three probes [see Fig. 7(b)]. The elastic\n636 unloading matrix Du is calculated in a similar way\n637 from the values recorded in the unloading branches\n638 of the three probes. After completing the three\n639 probes, the stresses are returned to their initial\n640 levels recorded at the start of the probing sequence,\n641 and the program moves on to the next test\n642 sequence.\n643 5. P1DC is a probing sequence in which the loading\n644 part of the probe in one direction (\u00011) is performed\n645 under displacement control with a given rate RD:\n646 This procedure is used in tests where the major\n647 principal stress is greater than the other two stress-\n648 es and close to the PNS (\u00011 > \u00012 U \u00013). If \u00011 is close\n649 to the peak, the loading stiffness of the specimen in\n650 the probing direction can be very low (often\n651 associated with stress relaxation in the other two\n652 directions) and loading to \u00011 \u00fe $\u0001P11 can take a long\n653 time. If the specimen is softening, then \u00011 will de-\n654 crease under displacement control. To avoid very\n655 slow loading or softening, the time for the loading\n656 part of the probe is limited, resulting in $\u0001P11 < $\u0001\nP\n657 or even $\u0001P11 < 0 (stress relaxation).\n658 6. P2DC is similar to P1DC, but with two stress probes\n659 performed under displacement control. This proce-\n660 dure is used in triaxial extension tests where\n661 \u00011 \u0006 \u00012 > \u00013 , and the two larger stresses are close\nto the peak stress levels.\n663\n664 The temperature in the specimen is controlled in all\n665 test sequences by specifying the heating rate RH (in\noC \u0004\n666 min\u00011) and limit temperature TL . When TL is reached\n667 the program sets RH to 0.\n668Experimental Testing in mac2T\n669A typical elevated temperature test in mac2T is per-\n670formed in two phases: (i) conditioning and (ii) devia-\n671toric loading.\n672Conditioning Phase\n673In the conditioning phase the specimen is subjected to\n674temperature changes with or without load. When\n675loaded, the specimens are subjected to moderate\n676(service) stresses, typically no higher than 50% of the\n677uniaxial compression strength of the material (fc). The\n678temperature is either increased monotonically to\n^\nT\n679(up to 300oC) or applied in cycles between ambient\n680and\n^\nT, at constant heating\/cooling rates between 0:1\n681and 3oC \u0004 min\u00011. During the heating and cooling stages\n682the temperature inside the specimen lags behind that\n683measured in the platens. Calibration tests on speci-\nFig. 7.

After maintaining the platen\n692 temperature at 250oC for 2 hours, the specimen centre\n693 reached 236oC. All conditioning phases in the elevated\n694 temperature tests performed in mac2T included a period\n695 of at least 24 hours holding at constant temperature of\n696 250oC, at which time the specimen attained a steady\n697 state \u0006 248oC.\n698 Load-then-heat (L-H) tests are used for investigat-\n699 ing the load induced thermal strains (LITS), a phe-\n700 nomenon of particular importance for fire engineering\n701 and design of concrete structures in nuclear power\n702 plants. After each heating and cooling cycle the\n703 specimen is held under steady state conditions for\n704 short periods until it reaches thermal and hygral equi-\n705 librium. In some tests the heating to\n^\nT is followed by\n706 longer periods of steady state (up to 5 days), in order\n707 to measure creep at constant (elevated) temperature.\n708 Heat-then-load (H-L) tests are used to determine\n709 drying shrinkage (needed for separating LITS from\n710total strains) and to provide a reference for assessing\n711the effects of heat-load regimes on the material be-\n712haviour under multiaxial stress.\n713The time histories of temperature, stress and strain\n714from a typical mac2T L-H test are shown in Fig. 8. The\n715specimen is first loaded in uniaxial compression to 26\n716MPa, then heated to 150o C, cooled to 20o C, heated to\n717250o C, and held under steady-state conditions for\n7183 days before starting the deviatoric loading phase.\n719Deviatoric Loading Phase\n720The influence of different loading and heating-cooling\n721regimes in the conditioning phase on the properties of\n722the material under multiaxial loading are investigated\n723in the second, deviatoric loading, phase of the tests.\n724In the simplest tests, the specimen is loaded in one\n725deviatoric plane (between Lode angles \u0002=6 and \u0001\u0002=6),\n726in several cycles with gradually increasing stress\nFig. 9.

These tests provide data on the re-\n729 lationship between heating, cooling and loading (\n^\nT,\n730 heating-cooling rates, heat-load sequence, and stress\n731 state during heating-cooling) and multiaxial strength of\n732 the material [23], tangent stiffness, elastic unloading\n733 stiffness, pre-peak volumetric expansion (or OUFP\u2014\n734 onset of unstable fracture propagation), plastic flow\n735 and softening behaviour of the material.\n736 More complex deviatoric loading tests include (i)\n737 deviatoric load cycles at fixed Lode angles but varying\n738 hydrostatic confinement levels and (ii) stress probes at\n739 different stress levels in each deviatoric cycle.\n740 In Fig. 10 are shown the loading path and stress-\n741 strain response recorded in a triaxial compression test\n742 (\u0005 \u00bc \u0002=6 , \u00011 > \u00012 \u00bc \u00013). The load was applied in six\n743 deviatoric planes (normal to the hydrostatic axis \u0006), at\n744 increasing levels of hydrostatic confinement. The test\n745 in each cycle i was carried out in 4 steps: (1) load\n746 hydrostatically to a predefined level \u0001i0 , (2) load in a\n747 deviatoric plane to \u00011 \u00bc 0:975\u0001^ i, (3) perform probes at\n7486 stress levels \u00011 \u00bc 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.925 and 0.95 \u0001^ i ,\n749and (4) unload to \u0001 i0. After completing the six loading\n750cycles, the specimen was unloaded along the hydro-\n751static axis (step 5) and tested under \u00013 compression\n752(\u00011 \u00bc \u00012 \u00bc 3MPa) to determine the residual strength\n753of the material (step 6).\n754Performing a series of small compression probes in\n755each of the three orthogonal directions, while main-\n756taining strains fixed in the other directions, allows the\n757isotropic upper 3\u0002 3 sub-matrix of the 6\u0002 6 constitu-\n758tive [D] matrix to be estimated [Fig. 7(b)]. The re-\n759maining terms of the [D] matrix were calculated by\n760adopting the original elastic shear modulus. This could\n761have been estimated, for an equivalent isotropic ma-\n762terial, from the altered mean Young\u2019s modulus and\n763mean Poisson\u2019s ratio. However, the effect of not\n764changing the shear modulus was shown to be near-\n765negligible when examining an equivalent elasto-plas-\n766ticity model. By calculating the acoustic tensor from\n767this matrix, a measure of impending material instabil-\n768ity can be determined [24]. This measure (the deter-\n769minant of the acoustic tensor) has both direction and\n770magnitude, thus it may be represented graphically\n771(Fig. 11) by a surface which starts out as being spherical\n772and evolves (collapses) into a form where the radius\n773becomes zero in the direction normal to the orientation\n774of a newly formed discontinuity surface. Such results\n775give a detailed picture of the material behaviour under\n776multiaxial compression needed for construction of\n777advanced constitutive models.\n778Conclusions\n779The new mac2T facility was developed to overcome the\n780lack of high quality experimental data on the behav-\nFig. 10.

The fully automat-\n784 ed programmable control system allows multi-stage\n785 experiments to be carried out by following complex\n786 load paths and temperature histories, at any Lode\n787 angle and in the post-peak range. These tests provide\n788 new macroscopic data needed to construct advanced\n789 constitutive models for simulating the response of\n790 concrete under generalised stress states. The observed\n791 effects of different heating and loading regimes on the\n792 evolving mechanical properties provide insight into the\n793 stress and temperature-induced changes in the materi-\nal fabric at a lower, microscopic, level.\n795\n796 Acknowledgments The authors are most grateful to the con-\n797 sortium of companies from the British nuclear industry and the\n798 Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for\n799 supporting the construction and operation of the mac2T facility.\n800 References\n801 1.
