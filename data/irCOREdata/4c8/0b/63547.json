It is believed that \nincreased coastal flooding in both intensity and frequency will occur in response to \nglobal warming (e.g. Houghton, 2005) and climate change (IPCC, 2007).  Sea level \nrise combined with human development on wetlands has lead to increased damage by \ncoastal flooding (IPCC, 2007).  The increasing threat of coastal flooding is therefore a \ncause of great concern for individual citizens, businesses and those charged with \nmanagement and protection of the coast (e.g. Lowe et al., 2001). The Coastal \nFlooding by Extreme Events (CoFEE) project and Morphological Impacts and \nCOastal Risks induced by Extreme storm events (MICORE) project are assessing \npast, present and future flood risk for a range of coastal environments due to extreme \nevents (Brown et al., 2009; Wolf et al., 2008).  Through the use of advanced \nmodelling techniques (described in section 2) an 11-year wave-surge hindcast has \nbeen performed for the Irish Sea (Figure 1).  Here we examine the long-term model \nvalidation (section 3) of both WAM and POLCOMS-WAM at different grid scales.  \nAn initial analysis of the modelling results and data has determined the extreme surge \nlevels and wave heights that occur in Liverpool Bay.  Further investigation will later \nbe carried out to distinguish the different causes of extreme present day conditions in \nthe eastern Irish Sea.  The basic causes are discussed in Section 6.  The most extreme \nevents will be selected to investigate surges within Liverpool Bay (Figure 1) using a \nhigher resolution model.  This area provides a range of different coastal environments, \nproviding examples of most of England\u2019s coastal types, and also has the added benefit \nof a vast and available dataset (POL Coastal Observatory).      \n \nFig. 1.

The vertical dashed line defines the boundary of the eastern Irish \nSea. \n\u22127 \u22126.5 \u22126 \u22125.5 \u22125 \u22124.5 \u22124 \u22123.5 \u22123 \u22122.5 \u22122\n51\n51.5\n52\n52.5\n53\n53.5\n54\n54.5\n55\nDee\nMersey\nRibble\nLiverpoolHolyhead\nFishguard\nDublin\nNorth\nChannel\nSt George\u2019s\nChannel\n The occurrence of extreme high water levels and waves are considered more \nimportant than rising sea level with regard to changes in the dune morphology along \nthe Sefton coast (Pye and Blott, 2008).  More frequent and longer lasting extreme \ntidal levels have occurred in Liverpool Bay since 1990.  Mean high water spring tide \nlevel reaches 4.17m above mean tidal level (MTL) at Liverpool and 4.53m (MTL) at \nHeysham.  At these locations the spring tidal range is 8.22m and 8.47m, respectively \nand the highest astronomical tide is 5.14m (MTL) and 5.62m (MTL), respectively \n(Pye and Blott, 2008).  The largest historical surge reached 2.47m on the 26th \nFebruary 1990.  The five largest observed high water levels occurred in 1977, 1983, \n1990 (two events) and 1997.  The surge levels during these high waters were between \n0.68m and 1.43m (Pye and Blott, 2008).  A longer data set for Liverpool (Woodworth \nand Blackman, 2002) found the most extreme high water levels occurred in 1905.  \nOther long-term records reveal that the worst storm to afflict Liverpool occurred at \nmidnight on the 6th January 1839 resulting in significant localized loss.  While server \ndamage due to coastal flooding throughout Lancaster and Merseyside resulted from a \nsurge driven by SSW winds on the 28th \u2013 29th October 1927 (Lamb, 1991).  For surges \nin Liverpool Bay the flow into the Irish Sea through the North Channel and Celtic Sea \n(the external surge) is about equally as important as the locally generated surge (Jones \nand Davies, 1998). A nested modelling system must therefore be adopted.  Wave \nconditions may also be critical to coastal flooding, through overtopping of sea \ndefences and low-lying areas.  The prevailing winds at this site are south-westerly.  \nThe largest waves and surges in Liverpool Bay are generated by westerly and north-\nwesterly winds which have the longest fetch up to 200m (Wolf, 2008; Pye and Blott, \n2008).  Refraction focuses the waves onto Formby point (Pye and Blott, 2008).  \nLiverpool Bay is sheltered from swell waves from the Atlantic and experiences \nlocally wind-generated sea (Brown and Wolf, 2009).  It is therefore less important to \ninclude external wave forcing with regard to this region, but this is important in \ncentral and southern parts of the Irish Sea.  The wave height typically exceeds 3m \nduring 5\u221210 events per year and exceeds 4m from 1\u22125 times per year.  The extreme 1 \nin 50 year wave height is estimated to be 5.5m (Wolf, 2008).  Wind waves are the \nmechanism through which the wind-stress interacts with the sea surface and the \nsurface roughness is related to wave age. Local conditions may mean that waves are \nnot in equilibrium with the wind so it is of benefit to model surge and waves \nsimultaneously in a coupled modelling system.  We use the Proudman Oceanographic \nLaboratory Coastal Modelling System (POLCOMS) as the surge model and the 3rd-\ngeneration spectral Wave Model (WAM).  The November 1977 and January 2007 \nstorm surge events have been previously used to calibrate the surge prediction in the \neastern Irish Sea using this coupled wave-tide-surge (POLCOMS-WAM) model \n(Brown and Wolf, 2009).   \n \nWithin the study area there is a vast and available data set to validate the modelling \nsystems.  Met Office 12km wind data are available to drive the models and tide gauge \ndata around the U.K. are held at the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) to \nvalidate the surge hindcast.  Wave data have been recorded in Liverpool Bay since \nOctober 2002, and other wave buoy data around the U.K. are available for the decadal \nperiod of interest from the Irish Marine Institute and U.K. Met Office. The main focus \nof the modelling will be to assess the impacts of extreme events on the morphology of \nthe Sefton coastline, north of Liverpool.    \n \nThe aim of this paper is to validate the 11-year hindcast of wave and hydrodynamic \nconditions around the U.K. The modelling methods are presented in section 2, \nfollowed in section 3 by validation of the coarse and medium resolution model results.  \nAn assessment of the wind forcing is also presented in section 3.  The results are \npresented in section 4, followed in section 5 by an estimate of the return period of \nextreme events along the Sefton Coastline.  A discussion of the results and methods to \nassess the model validity is made in Section 6.  The conclusions are finally drawn on \nthe validity of the hindcast modelling results in section 7.    \n \n2 Method  \nThe coupled POLCOMS-WAM system has been under development at the Proudman \nOceanographic Laboratory for the last 6 years. We apply it here, using a parallel \ncomputer system (Ashworth et al., 2004), to the 1.85km Irish Sea model (Figure 1).     \n \nIn order to accurately simulate the waves in the study area, we use the state-of-the-art \n3rd-generation spectral Wave Model (WAM, Komen et al., 1994).  In the coupled Irish \nSea model, a modified version of WAM for shallow water (Monbaliu et al., 2000) has \nbeen applied. Following Osuna et al (2007) WAM simulates the 2D wave spectral \nevolution considering the energy input by wind, energy dissipation by whitecapping \nand bottom friction, and non-linear wave-wave interactions.  Depth-limited wave-\nbreaking has not been included in this simulation, but will later be included in the \nLiverpool Bay model application in which drying areas are included.  Externally \ngenerated waves propagating into the Irish Sea are included by adopting a one-way \nnested model approach.  A 1\u00ba northeast Atlantic model provides hourly boundary \nforcing for the 1.85km Irish Sea model (Figure 2).  This coarse grid model was driven \nby six-hourly, ~1\u00ba resolution ECMWF (reanalyzed ERA-40) wind data.  In the \ncoupled Irish Sea model (detailed in Osuna and Wolf, 2005) WAM uses the same \nwind forcing provided via the surge model, using hourly Met Office mesoscale model \nwinds (see below). \n \nFig. 2. The nested WAM model domains and the locations of the wave buoys and \noffshore platforms used for validation.  The outer boundary of the figure represents \nthe northeast Atlantic model and the inner rectangular box represents the Irish Sea \nmodel boundary.  \n \nTo simulate the tides and surge within the Irish Sea we use the hydrodynamic model \nPOLCOMS (Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal-Ocean Modelling \nSystem), a three dimensional primitive equation numerical model.  The model is \nformulated in spherical polar coordinates on a B-grid with a terrain following (sigma) \ncoordinate system in the vertical (Holt and James 2001). POLCOMS can simulate \nboth the barotropic and baroclinic processes, which arise from the tides, \n24\no\nW 16\no\nW 8\no\nW 0\no\n8\no\nE\n40\no\nN\n45\no\nN\n50\no\nN\n55\no\nN\n60\no\nN\n65\no\nN\nLongitude\nL\na\nti\ntu\nd\ne\nK1\nK3\nK2\nK4\nK5\nSEV\nK7 63113\nK16\nEKO\nAUK\nK17\nK13\nVIT\nEUR\nCHA\nLIV\nGRE\nTUR\nM2\nM5\nmeteorological and riverine forcing (although density effects have not been included \nhere). The turbulence closure scheme (Mellor and Yamada, 1982) has been modified \nto account for surface wave breaking (Craig and Banner, 1994). For the 11-year \nhindcast hourly wind and pressure data were provided by the UK Met Office North \nEast Atlantic (mesoscale) model, with a resolution of 1\/9\u00ba by 1\/6\u00ba (~ 12km).  Such a \nthree dimensional model is required to represent the vertical structure of the wind-\ninduced currents (Jones and Davies, 1998) when modelling surge events.  To capture \nthe external surge generated outside of the Irish Sea a one-way nested approach \n(Figure 3) from the 1\/9\u00ba by 1\/6\u00ba (~12km) operational surge model (run at Proudman) \nto the 1.8km POLCOMS Irish Sea model, has been applied.  The operational surge \nmodel (details of which can be found in Flather, 1994) provided total (tide plus surge) \nhourly elevation and velocity boundary forcing.    \n \n \n10\no\nW 5\no\nW 0\no\n5\no\nE 10\no\nE\n48\no\nN\n51\no\nN\n54\no\nN\n57\no\nN\n60\no\nN\n63\no\nN\nLongitude\nL\na\nti\ntu\nd\ne\nMiPEl\nPR\nBa\nHo\nMH\nFi\nIlMu\nHi\nAv\nNe\nBa\nWo\nLl\nHe\nLi\nPP\nPEr\nFig. 3. The Irish Sea POLCOMS model domain (the inner box) nested within the \nOperational surge model domain (the outer figure boundary).  The locations of the \ntide gauge stations are also represented. \n \nFor the Irish Sea model wave-tide-surge interaction has been taken into account by 2-\nway coupling of POLCOMS and WAM (Osuna and Wolf, 2005).  The coupling is \nachieved through the surface and bottom stress and wave refraction due to the \npresence of time varying current and elevation fields (Wolf et al., 2002).  Presently, \nradiation stress is not included within the coupled model, but is under development.  \nThe surface stress formulation allows waves to influence the surface roughness in the \nsurge simulation using the method of Charnock (1955), with a wave dependent \nCharnock parameter (Janssen, 2004). The effect of waves on bottom friction is \nestimated using the method of Madsen (1994). In the standard POLCOMS-WAM \nmodel the minimum water depth was set to 10m, but for this research, in which we are \nfocusing on Liverpool Bay, improved bathymetric data (NOOS data set: Zijderveld \nand Verlaan, 2004) in the eastern Irish Sea has allowed a 5m minimum water depth to \nbe applied to this region only.  This minimum depth allowed resolution of the coastal \nbathymetric features, but prevented numerical instability with drying areas occurring \nin the model domain due to the tidal variations.  This gave improved surge prediction \nlocally within the eastern Irish Sea (Brown and Wolf, 2009).  The next step in the \nmodel study is planned using a Liverpool Bay model with a \u2018wetting and drying\u2019 \nscheme, which will eliminate the need to fix a minimum depth.   \n \n2.1 Surge definitions \nWe define the filtered surge as the residual obtained by filtering out all periodic signal \nfrom the (modelled and observed) total water elevation.  To do this the Matlab \nfunction \u2018filtfilt\u2019 is used.  The M4 (smallest) and O1 (largest) tidal periods are used to \nset the range of tidal signals that are to be removed in the filtering process.  This \nfiltered surge is the result of the meteorological forcing alone.  However, in the \neastern Irish Sea tide-surge interaction significantly modifies the surge (Brown and \nWolf, 2009).  This modification has significant effect on both the timing and size of \nthe peak surge.  The additional water elevation on top of the predicted tidal elevation \nis commonly known as the surge (residual).  We apply the Proudman Oceanographic \nLaboratory Coastal Observatory tidal analysis program (Titan) to the total elevation to \n\u2018de-tide\u2019 the modelled prediction.  The program is based on the Task 2000 package \nfrom the National Tide and Sea Level Facility (see \nhttp:\/\/www.pol.ac.uk\/ntslf\/software.html).  This extracts surge residuals that are \nconsistent with those provided as part of the tide gauge data set.  Using tidal analysis \nis also less computationally expensive than generating an 11-year hindcast of the \nmodelled tide.   \n \n2.2 Error metrics \nAllen et al. (2007) presents a set of error statistics to use for complex 3D modelling \nsystems.  We use two of these measures of accuracy to validate the 11-year model \npredictions compared to the data.  In the following equations M represents the model \nprediction, D represents the measured data and N is the number of data points in the \n11-year hindcast period.  The first measure is the Percentage Model Bias (Pbias).  \nThis provides a measure of whether the model is systematically under- or over- \nestimating the measured data. This is achieved by normalizing the sum of the model \nerror by the data:    \n( )\n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n=\n\u2212\n= N\nn\nn\nN\nn\nnn\nD\nMD\nPbias\n1\n1100                                                                                            (1) \nThe better the model the closer the value is to zero.  The level of accuracy is \nquantified as follows |Pbias| < 10 excellent, 10 \u2013 20 very good, 20 \u2013 40 good, > 40 \npoor.  Although Equation (1) works well for parameters that always maintain a \npositive value (e.g. Hs and Tp), it can be problematic for parameters which oscillate \naround zero (e.g. tides and surge).  For the validations made here we modify Equation \n(1) to be: \n( )\n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n=\n\u2212\n= N\nn\nn\nN\nn\nnn\nD\nMD\nPbias\n1\n1100                                                                                          (2) \notherwise the summation of the data and the error can create a large Pbias, even when \nthe model is performing well.  Also, the true systematic under- or over-prediction of \nthe model may not be correctly calculated. \n \nThe second metric is the Cost Function (CF).  This non-dimensional measure \nquantifies the \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between the model and the observations.  It is the ratio \nof model mismatch to the variance (standard deviation of the data, \u03c3D) in the data: \n\u2211\n= \u03c3\n\u2212=\nN\nn D\nnn MD\nN\nCF\n1\n1                                                                                                   (3) \n The model performance is classified as follows: CF < 1 very good, 1 \u2013 2 good, 2 \u2013 3 \nreasonable, > 3 poor.  \n \n3 Model validations \nIn this section we present the validation of the 11-year nested model hindcast.  The \nPOL operational surge model is known to give accurate surge predictions (Flather, \n2000), and is regularly validated (monthly) with data from the UK national tide gauge \nnetwork (see http:\/\/www.pol.ac.uk\/ntslf\/surgemonthlyplots) for operational use.  We \ntherefore concentrate on validation of the coarse WAM model of the northeast \nAtlantic and the medium resolution POLCOMS-WAM coupled model of the Irish \nSea.  The data selected to validate WAM are given in Table 1 and the wave buoy and \nplatform locations are shown in Figure 2.  The wave parameters are defined as \nfollows: Hs is the significant wave height, Tz is the zero-crossing period and Tp is the \npeak period.  Hs (Hm0 = 4\u221am0) and Tz (Tm02 = \u221am0\/\u221am2) are both derived from spectral \nmoments (mk, Krogstad et al., 1999).  Tp is a rather unstable parameter compared with \nTz, since for multi-modal spectra the peak can irregularly change frequency (Krogstad \net al., 1999).  Unfortunately, Tp is often the only available observed wave period \nparameter (Table 1) and therefore model validation can show the model to be less \naccurate than if Tz was used.    \n \nCoastal tide gauges around the U.K. were used to validate POLCOMS; the positions \nof the chosen stations are shown in Figure 3.  The periods for which data were \navailable at each tide gauge location are given in Table 2.

We \nfind the model is better as simulating T than Hs (for this metric) at every location.   \nExcellence is also achieved more frequently in T than Hs.  For Hs the model generally \nunder-predicts the measured data, while for T the model often over predicts the \nmeasured data (a result of the inverse relation between the two parameters).  This is \nlikely to be due to the low resolution (in space and time) of the wind forcing.  The CF \nmetric confirms the model performance to be very good, but Hs has a better \u2018goodness \nof fit\u2019 than T.

The \nlocations are given in Figure 2, Hs = significant wave height and Tp = peak wave \nperiod.  \n \nWe find POLCOMS does not consistently under- or over-estimate the water level \nacross the domain, unlike WAM that constantly under-predicts Hs across the region.  \nThis under-prediction could be related to the boundary forcing (negative pbias values \nfor K1, K5, M5, Turbot Bank (TUR) and Seven Stones LV (SEV) in Table 1) or due \nto errors in the wind forcing.  The POLCOMS model performs with a lower error than \nWAM, with the exception of Port Ellen.  At this location the tidal range is noticeably \nover-predicted with much higher high water elevation being predicted.  Removing the \ntidal component from the total water level to obtain the surge improves the validity at \nthis location. This is likely to be due to poor resolution of the coastal bathymetry at \nthis position, especially within the Operational Model forcing the boundary, which is \nclose to this position.  Generally, for POLCOMS the |Pbias| < 30 with CF < 2 and \noften |Pbias| < 10 with CF < 1 for POLCOMS, making this a very good model \nhindcast.  Again WAM provides a good model hindcast with |Pbias| < 38 with CF < \n2. \n \n3.3 Wind validation in the Irish Sea (IRS) \nThe accuracy of any model is dependent on the quality of the input data.  We validate \nthe mesoscale wind forcing for the IRS model using data from the Hilbre met station, \nsituated at the mouth of the Dee Estuary (53\u02da 22.94\u2019N, 3\u02da 13.60\u2019W) .  The data are \navailable from 16th April 2004 so only data between this date and 1st January 2007 are \nvalidated.  The mesoscale winds (~12km) are interpolated by POLCOMS onto the \nIrish Sea model grid (~1.8km).  For the wind speed the pbias = -38.5044 and CF = \n0.7706 and for the wind direction pbias = -21.7814 and CF = 1.9198.  The model \nwinds are classified by the CF metric to be very good and the direction to be good, \nwhile the pbias metric shows the winds are lower than that observed.  This may \nexplain why the (locally generated) wave heights are generally under-predicted in the \nIrish Sea.     \n \n4. Results \nHere we present the statistics of the occurrence of extreme wave and surge events.  \nThe 11-year hindcast and available data sets have been used to determine the most \nextreme peak surge elevations, high water (HW) levels and wave heights in Liverpool \nBay.  Trends in the extreme event are also investigated, but the length of the studied \nperiod prevents any significant long-term trends being determined.  We investigate \nthe observed surge levels, the filtered-surge residual and HW levels at two tide gauge \nlocations, namely Heysham and Liverpool.  These adjacent gauges encompass the full \nextent of the Sefton Coastline, which is the focus of the interest of the research \nprogramme.  The surge residual allows analysis of the additional water level on top of \nthe predicted tide due to a storm event interacting with the tide, whereas the filtered-\nsurge allows analysis of the impact of meteorological forcing at the two locations.  \nThe waves are analysed at the wave buoy location within Liverpool Bay.   \n \nWe find that along the Sefton Coast the extreme surge elevations due to \nmeteorological forcing (filtered surge) can reach 1.2m at Liverpool and 1.4m at \nHeysham (Figure 4).  But when tide-surge interaction is accounted for the peak surge \nincreases and the extremes can reach 2.3m at Liverpool and 2.4m at Heysham (Figure \n5).  The most extreme high water levels are not significantly greater than a typical \nspring tide HW of ~5m (MTL) at Liverpool.  At Liverpool an extreme HW can reach \n5.6m (MTL), while at Heysham, where the tidal range is larger with typical spring \nHW levels of 5.4m (MTL), they can reach 6.2m (MTL) (Figure 6).  In addition to the \nincreased water levels during a storm event, extreme waves of 5.6m (MTL) can also \nbe generated in Liverpool Bay (Figure 7). \n   \n \nFig. 4.

There are more cases for Heysham since the tidal range is larger than at \nLiverpool, so high water more frequently exceeds 5m.  If major wave conditions and \nwater levels occur simultaneously at Liverpool the same is often true for Heysham (8 \nout of 13 events).  Whether both ports simultaneously experience major events for a \ngiven storm depends on the storm track.  This is being investigated further following \nLennon (1963).  When the times of HW coincide at both ports these cases are cause \nthe slightly larger \u2018\u25a0\u2019 to be covered by a \u2018\u25a1\u2019 in Figure 8, creating a thicker outline, but \nif there is a lag in the time of observed high water these symbols align in the vertical.  \nFor Liverpool 13 major joint events occur and at Heysham 23 major joint events \noccur over the 11 year period investigated.  Although Heysham experiences higher \nwater levels the offshore waves during these high water conditions are within the \nsame range as those when Liverpool experiences major water levels.  These joint \nmajor conditions only occur between October and March. Over the 11 year period a \nbimodal cycle is evident (with peaks at the start and end of the study period and a \ntrough early in 2003) in data. The years 2001 and 2003 are the only years when no \nsimultaneous major events happen.  This cyclic trend is not a consequence of the 18 \nyear nodal tide.  The tidal maxima occurred in 1997 and will occur again in 2015 and \nthe tidal minima occurred in 2006 (Pugh, 2004).  The trend could be liked to decadal \ntrends in storm track position and the North Atlantic Oscillation (see Woodworth et \nal., 2007). \n Fig. 8. Periods of coincidental extreme water levels and wave events.  Observed high \nwater (HW) levels exceeding 5m at Liverpool and Heysham, with modelled offshore \nwave heights (Hs) exceeding 2m at the wave buoy location, coincidental with HW at \none of the ports.  \n \nNext we investigate the frequency of extreme events and look for trends over the past \ndecade.  For each year the peak surge level and number of occurrences the peak of a \nsurge event exceeds 0.5m is given in Table 6.  No obvious trend exists over the past \ndecade (Table 6, Figures 4 \u2013 6), due to the short time period to detect long-term \ntrends.  But the greatest occurrence of large surges (>0.5m) occurred in the second \nhalf of the decade.  The largest peaks are more evenly distributed across the years.  \nNeither end of this coastline is consistently experiencing larger tide-surge residuals \nthan the other end.  But there is a slight bias for surge residuals greater than 0.5m to \noccur more frequently at the Heysham (northern) end of the coastline.  This location \nhas also experienced the largest surges over the last decade.

Table 7 shows surges >1m, while Table 8 \nshows surges <1m and Table 9 shows total water level (MTL). Often the frequency of \nseparate surge events above an extreme specified value is less at Heysham than at \nLiverpool (Table 7).  Table 8 shows that the frequency of smaller filtered-surges is \ngreater at Heysham than Liverpool.  Heysham has a greater tidal range than Liverpool \nso achieves higher HW levels (Table 9).  But the three most extreme HW levels for \neach location are generally achieved with a similar number of occurrences at both \nlocations, a consequence of the locations not experiencing independent events.  \n \nSurge level Liverpool Heysham \n>1.0m 100 99 \n>1.5m 19 11 \n>1.7m 10 4 \n>1.9m 6 3 \n>2.1m 2 3 \nTable 7.

The \nmost extreme annual wave event often exceeds 4.0m and is often (6 \u2212 18 times per \nyear) greater than 3.0m.  In 2002 the largest wave height and greatest number of \nextreme events occurred.  There is no obvious trend in the data suggesting a long-term \nincrease in intensity and frequency of extreme wave conditions in relation to climate \nchange over this short period.  The data do imply that there is some inter-annual \nvariability in wave intensity (Fig 7, Table 10) with peak conditions exceeding 5m for \ntwo consecutive years over an interval of 7 years.  A longer time series of data is \nrequired to verify any pattern.  In table 11 we show that waves greater than 4m have \nbeen fairly infrequent over the past decade, whereas 3.0m \u2212 4.0m waves are quite \ncommon.   \n Liverpool Bay wave \nheight \nYear Peak Occurrence >3.0m \n1996 4.50 6 \n1997 5.63 7 \n1998 5.39 7 \n1999 4.02 11 \n2000 4.09 10 \n2001 4.05 3 \n2002 4.09 18 \n2003 3.90 12 \n2004 5.03 9 \n2005 5.46 11 \n2006 4.09 7 \n Table 10.

The number of occurrences the modelled peak significant wave height (Hs) \nfor an event exceeds levels specified in the table in Liverpool Bay. \n \n5. Return periods \nWe use the General Extreme Value (GEV) method with a linear trend to determine \nthe return periods of extreme events in Liverpool Bay.  Table 12 shows the estimated \nhigh water levels and wave heights that are likely to be exceeded once for the given \nreturn period in Liverpool Bay.  We analyse observed high water levels to obtain an \nidea of the most extreme total water level along the Sefton Coast and the wave height \nin Liverpool Bay as this will lead to defence overtopping, especially if combined with \nextreme water levels.  These estimated levels give an idea of the likelihood of extreme \npresent day events causing coastal inundation due to surges increasing the total water \nlevel and wave overtopping.  We see that the 100-year peak total water is 0.8m \u2212 1m \nabove the typical extreme annual storm level.  The 100-year extreme wave height is \n7.3m, 3.2m greater than the typical extreme annual storm level.  Over a long-term \n(100 year period) wave over topping due to extreme waves is more likely to cause \ncoastal flooding compared with extreme total water levels, as significant increases in \nthe extreme wave height occur within low return period.  Large annually occurring \nevents are considered to have total water levels above 5.2m for Liverpool and of 5.6m \nfor Heysham and\/or wave heights exceeding 4m, i.e. a 1 year return period.  Extreme \nevents are defined by water levels and wave heights that exceed the 5 year return \nperiod, given in Table 12.   \n Liverpool Heysham Wave buoy \nReturn \nPeriod, yrs \nHW level, \nm \nError, \nm \nHW level, \nm \nError, \nm \nHs, m Error, \nm \n1 5.22 0.04 5.66 0.05 4.09 0.15 \n2 5.30 0.05 5.79 0.07 4.49 0.22 \n5 5.41 0.09 5.98 0.13 5.05 0.38 \n10 5.52 0.14 6.12 0.18 5.52 0.57 \n20 5.65 0.23 6.28 0.25 6.01 0.83 \n25 5.69 0.27 6.33 0.28 6.18 0.93 \n50 5.84 0.41 6.49 0.38 6.73 1.28 \n100 6.02 0.61 6.67 0.49 7.31 1.72 \n1000 6.82 1.84 7.30 1.02 8.84 3.12 \nTable 12:  The return periods for high water (HW) levels (MTL) at Liverpool and \nHeysham along the Sefton coast and for wave heights (Hs) at the wave buoy location \nin Liverpool Bay. \n \nThe joint probability of major water levels and corresponding wave conditions in \nLiverpool Bay is investigated, using the 11 year data sets.  Over this period data was \navailable for 6919 high waters at Liverpool and for 6306 high waters at Heysham.  \nThe modelled offshore wave heights at the time of every observed high water during \nthe study period are plotted for water levels at Liverpool (Fig. 9) and Heysham (Fig. \n10).  The actual wave heights at the coast will be lower than those presented as the \nwaves will shoal as they propagate towards the coast away from the wave buoy \nlocation.  Using the JOIN-SEA software, freely available from HR Wallingford, the \njoint probability of waves and water levels was determined using the method \ndescribed by Hawkes (2000).  The contours of equal joint exceedance are shown in \nFigures 9 and 10 for different return periods.  The worst case water level \u2013 wave \nheight pairs at Heysham are (4.90, 5.40) and (5.07, 4.81) (Fig. 10).  At Liverpool the \nworst case pairs are slightly lower, taking values of (4.82, 5.40) and (4.50, 4.81) (Fig. \n9).  For both locations these worst case pairs have a return period of over 50 years. \n \nFig. 9.

Discussion \nA nested POLCOMS-WAM modelling system has been run for an 11year period to \nallow long-term validation of the models and provide model data to investigate surges \nin the eastern Irish Sea. \n  \nValidation of the coarse north east Atlantic (NEA) WAM model has show that the \nmodel \u2018goodness of fit\u2019, quantified by CF, is very good around the U.K. and within \nthe Irish Sea, i.e. for locations K1, K5, M5, Turbot Bank (TUR) and Seven Stones LV \n(SEV).  Therefore we find this model to have adequate resolution to provide boundary \nforcing for the Irish Sea model.  At the locations M5 and Turbot Bank (TUR) the \n1.4 1.8 2.2 2.6 3 3.4 3.8 4.2 4.6 5 5.4 5.8 6.2 6.6\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\nHW (m MTL)\nH\ns\n(m\n) r.p = 1\nr.p = 2\nr.p = 5\nr.p = 10\nr.p = 20\nr.p = 50\nmodel accuracy is slightly lower for T (higher CF value) than at the other three \nlocations around the Irish Sea and compared with the Hs accuracy.  At these two \nlocations T is slightly over-predicted (positive pbias T).  The most likely cause of this \nis lack of detail in the bathymetry, which has constant depth of 600m, and coastline in \nand around the Irish Sea allowing more swell into the Irish Sea than would occur in \nreality.    Improved wind forcing (in time and space) and bathymetry would help to \nreduce the systematic under-prediction in Hs and over prediction of T, shown in the \nPbias metric.  \n \nFor the Irish Sea (IRS) the POLCOM-WAM model performs to a \u2018very good\u2019 \nstandard when force by the NEA model and mesoscale wind.  Improvements in the \nresolution of the meteorological forcing in both the IRS and NEA model would \nfurther improve the model\u2019s performance.  Errors in the wind forcing account for \nsome of the discrepancies between the model simulation and the observations, for \nexample, the frequent under-prediction of the wave height. \n   \nSurges >0.5m in the eastern Irish Sea may have become more frequent over the last \ndecade (Table 6), but the annual peak in surge does not seem to be getting more \nintense.  Changes in the wind pattern will have a major influence on the filtered surge \nand wave events.  But the time of the wind event relative to the phase (spring-neap) \nand stage (HW-LW) of the tide will determine the size of the tide-surge residual.  For \nLiverpool the risk of flooding occurs when the total water level exceeds 5.63m.  This \nis the level reached during the November 1977 surge, which caused significant \ndamage to coastal defences along the Liverpool and Sefton Coast.  During LW spring \ntides the largest local surge residual will be generated but the total water level \ncompared to spring HW level will be insignificant, and thus not pose a flood risk.  \nDuring HW spring tide the wind will have least effect locally and the tide-surge \ninteraction can act to reduce the surge at the peak of the tide.  Hence, the likelihood of \nwater levels significantly exceeding the spring HW level is low.   For example at \nLiverpool a 2.26m surge residual occurred on the 27\/10\/02 and a 2.12m surge residual \noccurred on the 24\/12\/97.  The peak HW levels during these events were 3\u22123.7m \n(MTL), which does not pose a flood risk.  The greatest HW level of 5.64m (MTL) at \nLiverpool occurred on the 10\/02\/97.  The surge level at this time was 0.61m and the \npeak in the surge level was 0.76m, 30minutes after HW.  Interestingly, the filtered-\nsurge at the time of HW was 0.755m and at the time of the peak in tide-surge residual \nit was 0.758m.  This demonstrates the tide-surge interaction during the largest HW \nlevels acts to reduce the magnitude of the wind driven (filtered-) surge on the total \nwater level.       \n \nHeysham experiences more frequent smaller (<1m) surges than Liverpool (Table 6 \u2013 \n8, Figure 5) and less extreme (>1m) surges.  But when a large surge does occur it is \noften more intense than those experienced at Liverpool.  Heysham is more exposed to \nsurge-generating wind events (more frequent filtered-surge events >0.5m) than \nLiverpool, but the larger tidal range interacting with the surge seems to reduce the \nfrequency of extreme surge events (>0.5m) and extreme HW (>5.2m, MTL) events.  \nAlthough infrequent, when the peak surge occurs during lower water levels, the larger \ntidal range at Heysham is the cause of the more intense surge compared with \nLiverpool.  Finally the larger tidal range means the maximum HW levels are greater \nat Heysham than Liverpool.  \n \nWaves are locally generated in Liverpool Bay (Brown and Wolf, 2009).  Winds from \nthe northwest and west have the longest fetches, thus generate the most severe wave \nconditions. Hence if winds from these directions become more intense and frequent, \nso will the extreme wave conditions.  Interestingly the most severe surge conditions \noccurred when the winds were from the south west.  Since the external surge has a \ndominant contribution to the surge in the eastern Irish Sea this direction provides \nlongest fetch for surge generation.  The coast is therefore at most risk from flooding \nwhen a south-westerly wind veers to the west during HW spring tide. Under these \nconditions substantial wave heights coincide with a low to moderate surge on top of \nextreme tidal levels.  This leads to a high risk of defences being overtopped (e.g. \nNovember 1977, Jones and Davies, 1998).   \n \nBy classify extreme events as those with a 5 year return period to, we find that for the \nSefton coastline a 5.05m offshore wave height with extreme high water levels of \n5.98m at Heysham and 5.41 at Liverpool is considered extreme (Table 12).  Every \nyear it is likely that a wave height of 2.6m will coincide with a high water level of \n4.4m at Liverpool (Fig. 9) and 4.8m at Heysham (Fig. 9).  An example of the worst \njoint (5 year) extreme conditions is an offshore wave height of 3.0m coinciding with \nhigh water of 4.7m at Liverpool (Fig. 9) and an offshore wave height of 3.25m \ncoinciding with high water of 5.1m at Heysham (Fig. 10).     \n \nThis study shows that in the eastern Irish Sea (locations with large tidal range) the \nsurge residual is a better measure for flood risk management compared with the \nfiltered-surge.  Since the tide can significantly enhance or reduce the surge due to the \nmeteorological forcing alone.  The surge residual represents the additional water level \nthat will be experienced on top of the tidal level, hence allowing assessment of the \nflood risk posed at HW due to enhanced water levels.   \n \nThe medium resolution Irish Sea model applied here has proven to be a valid \nmodelling system for the long-term.  These data will be used to investigate the \nmeteorological conditions that have caused the most extreme surges and waves within \nthe eastern Irish Sea over the past decade.  The worst storm events in this region will \nbe isolated and the model data used to provide boundary forcing for a high resolution \n(185m) Liverpool Bay model.  At this resolution additional physics will be included \nto investigate these isolated extreme events that pose flood risk along the Sefton \ncoastline.  For example, \u2018wetting and drying\u2019 of tidal flats, wave setup, effects of \ndensity stratification on the surge events and the resulting morphological change will \nbe included.   \n \nFinally, we discuss the metrics used to validate the model.  We find that there is \ndiscrepancy between which metric determines which variables are most accurately \nmodelled.  For example, the CF metric finds the wind speed to be more accurately \nsimulated, while the |pbias| metric finds the wind direction to be more valid.  \nConfidence is gained when both metrics agree the model performance to be in similar \ncategories, although the numerical value may disagree. We feel the CF metric is more \nappropriate to determine the validity of a variable since is compares the error to the \nvariation in the observation.  For tide, surges and waves the variation is important as it \ndetermines if a flood risk is posed.  The pbias is a good indicator for over- or under- \nprediction, but the validity is likely to improve for large data sets since the long-term \nerrors cancel each other out and the summation of the data in the denominator will \ngrow larger, reducing the percentage error.  The error is compared to the size of the \ndata, which is more appropriate for variable that have low variability in time.  \n \n7. Conclusion  \nAn 11-year hindcast has been performed using the POLCOM-WAM nested modelling \nsystem for the Irish Sea. The model data has been validated across the Irish Sea using \n19 tide gauges and 22 wave stations. We find that the model hindcast is valid in the \nlong-term. Initial analysis of the data has shown that extreme surges in Liverpool Bay \ncan reach 1.37m as a result of the meteorological forcing alone.  Surge levels due to \ntide-surge interaction can reach 2.41m, demonstrating the importance of the tide in \nthis region.  The largest surge in the past 11 years reached 2.26m at Liverpool on the \n27th October 2002. Since the largest surges do not occur during high water levels the \nmost extreme high water levels only exceed the spring tide high water level by less \nthan a metre. The largest high water levels achieved in the past decade was 6.18m \n(MTL) at Heysham and 5.64m (MTL) at Liverpool.  Over the 11-year hindcast period \nno obvious trend in the intensity and frequency of extreme events is evident as a \nresponse to the changing climate. However, future changes in climate during the 21st \ncentury are likely to be more significant and will be investigated in future work. \n \nThe largest surges are likely to occur during low water levels, thus do not pose \nsignificant flood risk.  Heysham has less frequent but more intense surges, and greater \nflood risk due to a larger tidal range compared with Liverpool.  Waves also pose a \nflood risk due to overtopping.  In Liverpool Bay the largest hindcast waves have \nreached 5.63m in the last decade.  The worst flood risk occurs when a significant \nwind event occurs close to high water.  As any surge increases the high water levels \nand large waves are also generated.  The tidal range at the time of the surge event will \ncontrol the magnitude of the additional water level on top of the tide.  Every five \nyears the extreme high water level likely to be exceeded is 5.41m (MTL) at Liverpool \nand 5.98m (MTL) at Heysham, but will remain below 5.52m (MTL) and 6.12m \n(MTL) respectively.  The extreme offshore wave height likely to be exceeded is \n5.05m, while remaining under 5.52m.  In the past 11 years such extreme wave and \nwater levels have not been achieved simultaneously.  The worst extreme conditions \nfrom the data presented here was a 5.1m (MTL) high water at Heysham coinciding \nwith 4.8m waves offshore.  From the modelling work presented and tide gauge \nobservations there is no suggestion that extreme events (waves, surges, high water \nlevels) are becoming larger or more frequent.      \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe CoFEE project is funded under the NERC Flood Risk in Extreme Environments \n(FREE) program and the MICORE project is funded by the EU FP7 program.
