In\n1972 Berolo and Woolley11 published the first and only mea-\nsured values for \u00020, using electroreflectance on samples\ngrown by the horizontal Bridgman technique.12 Although no\nactual spectra were published, they reported a bowing pa-\nrameter of C\u0002\u00020\u0003= +1170 meV, by far the largest of any\nIII-V ternary alloy.10 They attributed this, and similar trends\nthey observed in other ternary alloys,11 to interband mixing\neffects and disordering within the lattice.13 Subsequently,\nseveral authors have suggested that such bowing \u0005C\u0002\u00020\u0003\n\u00050\u0006 is not predicted by theory for ordered systems: Siggia\nremarks that his calculations for \u00020 in InAs1\u2212xSbx cannot\ndemonstrate the bowing claimed by Berolo and Woolley11\nunless his Kane-formula conduction band effective mass val-\nues are doubled, but that would then disagree with experi-\nmental measurements of the effective mass.14 After several\nexperiments reported C\u0002\u00020\u0003\u00060 in epitaxial quaternary\nalloys,15\u201317 Wei and Zunger18 conducted self-consistent\nelectronic-structure calculations for ordered ternary alloys\nwhich predicted C\u0002\u00020\u0003\u00060. They noted that an unphysically\nlarge interband mixing coefficient of 48% would be required\nto explain the positive bowing in InAs1\u2212xSbx and concluded\ninstead that sample inhomogeneity in Ref. 11 was a more\nlikely cause, with a recommendation to conduct new mea-\nsurements on homogeneous epitaxial samples. Here, we use\nMIR photoreflectance \u0002PR\u0003 spectroscopy to measure the E0\nand E0+\u00020 transitions in high-quality epitaxial InAs1\u2212xSbx\nsamples \u0002of thickness 500 nm, with 300 nm InAs buffer lay-\ners\u0003 grown by molecular beam epitaxy \u0002MBE\u0003, on n-InAs\nsubstrates, with Sb molar fractions of 0\u0003x\u000322.5%\ndetermined from x-ray diffraction measurements. In all these\nsamples the epilayers are thicker than the determined critical\nthicknesses \u0002\u0004100 nm\u0003, indicating that they are likely to be\nfully relaxed. We also study the PR of two InAsSb-rich,\nGazIn1\u2212zAs1\u2212y\u2212xPySbx samples of thickness \u00041.5 \u0004m, grown\nby liquid phase epitaxy \u0002LPE\u0003, lattice matched to GaSb\nsubstrates. These two pentenary alloys \u0002s922 and s923\u0003\nwere determined to have the compositions\nGa0.04In0.96As0.83P0.04Sb0.13 and Ga0.07In0.93As0.82P0.03Sb0.15,\nrespectively.\nThe PR was done using a 0.32 m monochromator with\ngratings blazed at either 1.5 or 5.0 \u0004m to disperse the probe\nbeam from a tungsten filament bulb, and detected by a 77 K\nInSb photodiode. The sample reflectivity was modulated\nwith a mechanically chopped \u0002883 Hz\u0003 HeNe laser \u0002633 nm,\n\u000410 mW\u0003. In some samples strong background signals ne-\ncessitated a reduction of the laser power with neutral density\nfilters.\nFigure 1 shows the PR of all our samples at 10 K, with\nthe exception of the 16.0% Sb sample, which exhibited a\nparticularly weak PR signal: here a better signal to noise\nratio was achieved at 50 K. This decreases its band gap bya\u0003Electronic mail: j.hosea@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 90, 172106 \u00022007\u0003\n0003-6951\/2007\/90\u000317\u0002\/172106\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics90, 172106-1\nDownloaded 11 Mar 2008 to 194.80.32.9.

PR features from\nthe E0 transition in each sample are clearly visible, display-\ning a strong redshift with increasing antimony concentration.\nThe corresponding transition energies were determined pre-\ncisely by fitting all the PR features with third-derivative\nfunctional forms \u0002TDFFs\u0003.19 In the case of the E0 feature, the\nresulting fitted energies agree to within a few meV of the\npeak positions of the corresponding 10 K photoluminescence\n\u0002PL\u0003 spectra \u0002not shown\u0003. We find that the sample with the\nhighest Sb content \u000222.5%\u0003 has E0=261\u00b15 meV \u00024.75 \u0004m\u0003,\nwhich represents the longest wavelength PR signal measured\nso far using grating spectroscopy.20,21 The PR signal gener-\nally gradually decreases with increasing Sb content \u0002see mul-\ntiplication factors in Fig. 1\u0003. However, the E0 PR feature\nremains quite sharp, with width ranging from 7 to just\n23 meV, indicating high-quality epilayers and enabling a\nmore precise determination of E0 than is possible from the\ncorresponding 10 K PL peaks \u0002widths ranging from\n20 to 32 meV\u0003.\nFor all but the highest two Sb concentrations we also\nobserve a PR feature in the 800 meV near-infrared region,\nwhich we believe is associated with the E0+\u00020 transition.\nAgain, the energies of these features were determined pre-\ncisely by fitting with a TDFF, as shown in the example in\nFig. 1 for the 15.5% Sb sample. For InAs1\u2212xSbx samples\ngrown on InAs there is a possibility that these features may\nbe partially, or entirely, due to the E0+\u00020 transition of the\nsubstrate layer, rather than the epilayer. However, we are\nconfident that this is not the case here since the penetration\ndepth of the HeNe laser through the 500 nm thick InAs1\u2212xSbx\nepilayers is \u0004100 nm at 10 K, making modulation of the\nsubstrate unlikely. Furthermore, since we do not observe sig-\nnificant PR signals at 10 K near the InAs band gap\n\u0002E0\u0004415 meV\u0003, we would not expect to observe a corre-\nsponding E0+\u00020 substrate signal since the penetration depth\nof the probe beam in InAs1\u2212xSbx at 800 meV is less than half\nof that at 400 meV.\nThe PR spectra of the two InAsSb-rich\nGazIn1\u2212zAs1\u2212y\u2212xPySbx LPE samples \u0002s922 and s923\u0003 also\nshow features near 800 meV in Fig. 1, similar to those of\nInAs1\u2212xSbx. Since these were grown on GaSb and not on\nInAs, such features cannot arise from E0+\u00020 substrate tran-\nsitions. On the other hand, at 10 K GaSb has a fundamental\nband gap of 812 meV.10 However, this is more than 15 meV\nabove the fitted energies obtained for the PR of s922 and\ns923 in this spectral region. This, combined with the fact that\nthe pentenary epilayers are \u00041.5 \u0004m thick in these LPE\nsamples \u0002over ten times the penetration depth of the HeNe\nlaser\u0003, rules out the possibility that the observed features near\n800 meV arise from E0 substrate signals.\nFigure 2\u0002a\u0003 shows the 10 K values for E0 obtained from\nthe TDFF fits of the InAs1\u2212xSbx PR spectra in Fig. 1, as a\nfunction of Sb content. The straight line shows a linear in-\nterpolation \u0002no bowing\u0003 between the InAs and InSb end\npoints, while the curve represents the accepted bowing of\nC= +670 meV.10 Our values for E0 tend to lie slightly above\nthe accepted bowing curve, by \u000420 meV, similar to Ref. 9\nand other studies on InAsSb samples rich in InAs.7,8 This\nmay be due to a slight overestimation of the Sb concentra-\ntions due to our assumption of full relaxation.\nFigure 2\u0002b\u0003 shows our 10 K \u00020 results for the InAs1\u2212xSbx\nsamples where an E0+\u00020 PR feature was observed. It is clear\nthat \u00020 does not exhibit the strong, positive bowing claimed\nby Berolo and Woolley11 and quoted by Vurgaftmann et al. \u0005\nC= +1170 meV, the curve in Fig. 2\u0002b\u0003\u0006. Our results show no\npositive bowing, and, if anything, may show a slightly op-\nposing trend with a fit of the data in Fig. 2\u0002b\u0003 \u0002not shown\u0003\ngiving C\u0002\u00020\u0003=\u2212225 meV. Although a negative bowing has\nbeen predicted by Wei and Zunger for ordered ternary\nalloys,18 our result provides only tentative supporting evi-\ndence of this due to the range of Sb content studied.

We can test whether these values are also consistent\nwith a negligible \u00020 bowing in InAs1\u2212xSbx by interpolating\nto find the expected pentenary values, P. We do this by treat-\ning these samples as a mixture of two quaternary alloys:\nQ1=GaAs1\u2212y\u2212xPySbx and Q2=InAs1\u2212y\u2212xPySbx. We use the in-\nterpolation formula described by Krijn22 to calculate these\nand then interpolate between them using P=zQ1+ \u00021\u2212z\u0003Q2\n\u2212z\u00021\u2212z\u0003C\u0002, where z is the gallium content and C\u0002= \u00021\u2212y\n\u2212x\u0003CInGaAs+yCInGaP+xCInGaSb. Using parameters from Ref.\n10 and including the value CInGaSb= +1170 meV of Berolo\nand Woolley11 would give \u00020=293\u00b120 and 286\u00b120 meV\nfor s922 and s923, respectively, where the errors arise from\nthe compositional uncertainties of the pentenary alloys.\nThese predicted values are very much lower than our mea-\nsured values. However, a zero bowing, CInGaSb=0 meV,\nyields 415 and 420 meV, respectively, much closer to our\nmeasurements. This is further evidence that \u00020 exhibits neg-\nligible positive bowing in InAs1\u2212xSbx. Note that our tentative\nfitted bowing of CInGaSb=\u2212225 meV predicts \u00020\u0002s922\u0003\n=438 meV and \u00020\u0002s923\u0003=446 meV, equal to the corre-\nsponding measurements within the aforementioned uncer-\ntainties.\nTo put our results into context, we can consider their\nimpact on predicting Auger recombination rates in, say, a\ncryogenically cooled InAs1\u2212xSbx based device for CO2 gas\ndetection at 4.25 \u0004m \u0002E0\u0004290 meV\u0003, which from Fig. 2\u0002a\u0003\nwould be provided by an Sb molar fraction of \u000417%.\nCurrently accepted literature results would predict\n\u00020\u0004295 meV,10,11 within 5 meV of E0. Such a resonance,\nE0\u0007\u00020 would result in very high CHSH Auger losses, since\nnear-vertical transitions could occur between states close to\nthe band edges.3 However, using our result of negligible\nbowing gives \u00020\u0004460 meV, which, since \u00020\u0007E0 would\npredict that the CHSH process is no longer of importance\ncompared to the other processes.3 Therefore, theoretical pre-\ndictions of the performance of such a device would differ\ngreatly in terms of the extent of the different Auger losses,\ndepending on which value for \u00020 was used.\nIn the future we hope to extend these PR studies to even\nlonger wavelengths, in order to quantify C\u0002\u00020\u0003 in InAs1\u2212xSbx\nsamples containing higher antimony fractions.\nThe authors thank EPSRC \u0002GR\/S08817\/01\u0003 for support\nand studentships for two of the authors \u0002S.A.C. and P.J.B.\u0003,\nthe Royal Society UK-Taiwan International Joint Academic\nExchange Project NC\/TW JP03-05\/15628, and the National\nScience Council of the Republic of China \u0002NSC-94-2215-E-\n002-016\u0003.\n1A.
