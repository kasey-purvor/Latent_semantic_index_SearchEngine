Magnetospheric physics (magnetopause, cusp\nand boundary layers; magnetospheric configuration and dy-\nnamics; solar wind-magnetosphere interactions)\nCorrespondence to: N. C. Maynard\n(nmaynard@mrcnh.com)\n1 Introduction\nIt is generally accepted that merging between the interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF) and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\n(Dungey, 1961) is the principal coupling mechanism for solar\nwind plasma entry to the magnetosphere. The nature, loca-\ntion, and temporal dependence of merging remain open ques-\ntions. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence that\nmerging often proceeds away from the equator.\nAccelerated flows of magnetosheath plasma observed near\nthe subsolar magnetopause (near the Earth-Sun line) provide\nin situ evidence of the merging process (Paschmann et al.,\n1979; Sonnerup et al., 1981). Minimum variance analyses\nof magnetic field measurements were employed to show that\nthe magnetopause acted as a rotational discontinuity with a\nfinite Bnormal , proportional to the merging rate. However,\nestablishing an unambiguous finite Bnormal can be difficult.\nJump conditions across the discontinuity satisfy the Wale\u00b4n\nrelationship, indicating that the change in the ion velocity\nis proportional to the change in the magnetic field. Obser-\nvations of accelerated flows, often identified by \u201cD-shaped\u201d\ndistributions in velocity space (Cowley, 1982), have been re-\ngarded as standard signatures of merging (e.g. Gosling et al.,\n1982; Paschmann et al., 1986; Sonnerup et al., 1990).\nX-type merging configurations with oppositely directed\nfield lines (Levy et al., 1964) were generalized by Sonnerup\n(1974) to include merging between the antiparallel compo-\nnents of B, along a line that hinges about the subsolar point\n(Gonzales and Mozer, 1974). Crooker (1979) offered an al-\nternate hypothesis in which merging occurs wherever magne-\ntospheric and magnetosheath field lines are aligned antipar-\nallel to each other. For most IMF orientations the antiparallel\nlocation is at high latitudes on the magnetopause. By high\n(low) latitudes, we mean in the general vicinity of the cusp\n(equator). Both hypotheses locate merging at the poleward\n2234 N. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging\nboundary of the dayside cusp during periods of purely north-\nward IMF. Merging has been definitively identified there by\nScudder et al. (2002a).\nOne difficulty in locating the merging line relates to a\nlack of accelerated particles observed during magnetopause\ncrossings. In fact, decelerated flows are encountered in the\nboundary layer (Eastman et al., 1976). Aggson et al. (1983)\ntransformed electric fields measured by ISEE-1 at the magne-\ntopause into a de Hoffman-Teller (H-T) reference frame (de\nHoffman and Teller, 1950). Data measured by Polar were\nsubjected to a Galilean transformation to a reference frame\nmoving with a velocity VHT . In this reference frame the\nelectric field component perpendicular to the magnetic field\ntransforms to zero. H-T reference frames exist for rotational\nbut not for most tangential discontinuities. The transforma-\ntion will not remove the electric field internal in the layer in\na tangential discontinuity (e.g. Lee and Kan, 1979). Thus,\nthe identification of a H-T frame for ordering satellite mea-\nsurements that holds internally in the current layer implies\nthe traversal of a rotational discontinuity. In the H-T frame\nthe plasma velocity is directed along the magnetic field and\nis equal to the local Alfve\u00b4n speed.\nWhile increased velocities were observed during some\nISEE-1 magnetopause crossings, Aggson et al. (1984) also\nreported decelerated flows. Moreover, they emanated from a\nmerging site poleward of the satellite. Scudder (1984) calcu-\nlated that, as the merging site moved off the equator, the ex-\nhaust velocity from the X-line should equal the sum from the\nmerging acceleration and the local magnetosheath velocity at\nthe merging site. Hence, the outflow velocity in inertial space\nmay be significantly less than the Alfve\u00b4n speed. In a recent\nanalysis of 69 magnetopause crossings, Phan et al. (1996)\nfound that, of the 42 that \u201csatisfied\u201d the Wale\u00b4n test, 21 had\nvelocity changes that produced normalized slopes on the av-\nerage of 0.6, which is less than unity predicted from a single\ncomponent merging X-line. They concluded that (1) merg-\ning sometimes occurs at latitudes higher than the satellite and\n(2) earlier studies that restricted merging sites to only equa-\ntorial latitudes were biased to include only those events with\nsignificant acceleration (e.g. Scurry et al., 1994). Scudder et\nal. (1999) showed that the Wale`n test was better performed\nwith electrons whenever currents were present. Under these\nconditions, the normalized slopes for the ion Wale\u00b4n test de-\ntected during the same crossings were often significantly less\nthan 1, which does not match expectations. They showed that\nduring many of these non-conforming crossings, the normal-\nized slopes of the electrons were consistently near+\/\u22121, as\nneeded for a conclusive rotational discontinuity test.\nIn a recent study Maynard et al. (2001b) correlated\nrocket measurements of electric fields near the Northern-\nHemisphere cusp with geoeffective interplanetary electric\nfields (IEF) measured upstream in the solar wind by the Wind\nsatellite. They found that observed lag times were signifi-\ncantly less than those predicted for simple advection. The\nIMF was dominated by BX and the clock angle in the Y \u2212Z\nplane was near 90\u25e6. The short lag time and the dominant BX\nforced consideration of tilted phase planes of the IEF and\nplaced the location of merging at high latitudes in the South-\nern Hemisphere. Whether merging followed the antiparallel\nhypothesis of Crooker (1979) or whether a small guide field\nwas present could not be ascertained with the available data.\nEither way, a portion of the cusp in the Northern Hemisphere\nwas responding to a merging source in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere. Within the same all-sky picture of the dayside cusp\ntaken at Ny-A\u02dalesund, responses to high-latitude merging in\nthe Northern Hemisphere were also identified. Because of\nIMF BY , the cusp was bifurcated into source regions origi-\nnating from high-latitude merging in the Northern and South-\nern Hemispheres, while IMF BX controlled the timing of the\ninteractions in each hemisphere. Merging rates responded\nto small-scale variations of the IEF, as evidenced by elec-\ntric fields observed at the rocket and by 557.7 nm emissions\ncaptured in the all-sky images. Because of the strong BX,\nthe lag time was 14 min longer for the Northern Hemisphere\nmerging site compared to the Southern Hemisphere site. The\nbifurcation of the cusp with BY and the need for antiparal-\nlel reconnection under those conditions was also deduced by\nColeman et al. (2001).\nWeimer et al. (2002) utilized data from four satellites in\nthe solar wind to show that lag times varied continuously\nand to construct the phase plane in an over-determined way.\nThey demonstrated that the orientations of IEF phase planes\nchange significantly on time scales of tens of minutes, and\nthat the small-scale variations often remained coherent while\npropagating over 200RE in the solar wind. Both factors were\nused by Maynard et al. (2001b) to reach the interpretation\ndescribed above. Variable lag times from the shifting ori-\nentation of the phase plane of the IEF must be considered\nin any assessment of IMF influences on merging processes.\nLag times do not, in general, remain constant.\nProjections of the dayside cusp onto the ionosphere may\nbe quite wide (Maynard et al., 1997). Plate 1 of Maynard\net al. (2001b) indicates that signatures of high-latitude merg-\ning in the local hemisphere may be significantly displaced\nfrom noon when IMF BY is large. Azimuthal plasma ve-\nlocity enhancements may be expected from the merging and\nsubsequent J\u00d7 B acceleration.\nCowley (1982) documented the ion signatures expected in\nthe vicinity of rotational discontinuities that attend X-type\nmerging lines. Near the outer separatrix, transmitted or ac-\ncelerated magnetospheric ions may be found, along with ac-\ncelerated and incident magnetosheath ions. Near the inner\nseparatrix, the incident or cold distribution is of magneto-\nspheric origin, while accelerated distributions from magne-\ntosheath sources may also be observed. Distribution-function\nisocontours in v||\u2013v\u22a5 phase space exhibit \u201cD\u201d shapes when\nacceleration has occurred. Finding a \u201cD\u201d shaped isocon-\ntour displaced from the origin has been cited by Fuselier\net al. (1991) as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that reconnection has oc-\ncurred. Bauer et al. (2001) reported many magnetopause\ncrossings that \u201csatisfied\u201d Wale\u00b4n tests using ion velocities but\nlacked clear \u201cD\u201d-shaped distributions. They attributed the\nmissing \u201cD\u201d to pattern blurring by mirroring particles. By\nitself, a \u201cD\u201d shaped distribution is a necessary but not a\nN. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging 2235\nsufficient signature of merging, since ambipolar parallel elec-\ntric fields associated with electron pressure gradients can ac-\ncelerate ions without merging (Scudder et al., 2002b).\nA second signature of merging may be identified from\nwave Poynting fluxes (1E\u00d71B)\/\u00b50, where 1E and 1B are\nthe fluctuations as described below. When merging occurs,\nAlfve\u00b4n waves are launched to communicate information to\nmagnetically connected regions (Atkinson, 1992). The as-\nsociated wave Poynting vector is directed away from the\nsource since it represents escaping electromagnetic energy.\nThis electromagnetic energy flux should be strongest along\nthe separatrices. Again, this is a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for identifying merging events, since other mecha-\nnisms can generate Alfve\u00b4n waves that carry parallel Poynting\nflux.\nGeotail was the first satellite to skim along the magne-\ntopause, while moving parallel to the equatorial plane. Dur-\ning multiple crossings, Nakamura et al. (1998) observed\nincreased speeds accompanied by ion heating and inferred\nthem to have come from distant merging sites. More recently,\nKim et al. (2002) observed accelerated flows at the magne-\ntopause near the subsolar equator. They interpreted changes\nin direction as evidence for component merging, with the\nseparator moving north and south relative to the spacecraft.\nPhan et al. (2000) used Geotail and Equator S measurements\non the dawn flank of the magnetopause to provide nearly si-\nmultaneous observations of bi-directional flows from an X-\nline between the spacecraft in the equatorial region. This was\nfor a nearly pure BZ south condition.\nIn the 2000\u20132002 period, the 9RE apogee for the Polar\nsatellite orbit has been close to the equator. On many days it\nspent long periods skimming along the magnetopause from\nsouth to north, roughly at quadrature to the Geotail orbital\nplane. Often the satellite either traversed the magnetopause\nvery slowly, or failed to cross it completely. Thus, temporal\nvariations may be clearly identified, but spatial scales are not\nas easily determined. If current layers are crossed slowly and\nmerging occurs at high latitudes, one should not assume that\nobservations of an inner separatrix near the equatorial plane\nwill be followed by an observation of an outer separatrix.\nWith the merging line located far from the spacecraft it is\nprobable that only one separatrix will be observed. Merging\nmay vary both temporally and spatially, occurring simulta-\nneously at multiple sites. High-latitude merging is expected\nto be more temporally variable, since an X-line will not be\nintrinsically stable when the tangential magnetosheath flow\nis super-Alfve\u00b4nic (Cowley and Owen, 1989; Rodger et al.,\n2001).\nEvidence that merging proceeds away from the equator\nplane at high latitudes is seen in a number of the Polar skim-\nming passes. In the following sections, we present time-\nvarying observations from Polar, Cluster and SuperDARN\nacquired on 12 March 2002, to establish the temporal and\nspatial variability of the merging process. Using other events\nand comparisons to simulation results, we extend these ob-\nservations to show that high-latitude merging is more com-\nmon than generally thought when the clock angle is less than\n150\u25e6 and may occur at even greater clock angles.\n2 Measurements\nSeveral Polar instruments contribute to this study. The Hydra\nDuo Deca Ion Electron Spectrometer (DDIES) (Scudder et\nal., 1995) consists of six pairs of electrostatic analyzers look-\ning in different directions to acquire high-resolution energy\nspectra and pitch-angle information. Full three-dimensional\ndistributions of electrons between 1 eV and 10 keV and ion\nfluxes with an energy per charge ratio of 10 eV q\u22121 to\n10 keV q\u22121 were sampled every 13.8 s. The electric field in-\nstrument (EFI) (Harvey et al., 1995) uses a biased double\nprobe technique to measure vector electric fields from po-\ntential differences between 3 orthogonal pairs of spherical\nsensors. In this paper we present measurements from the\nlong wire antennas in the satellite\u2019s spin plane. The Mag-\nnetic Field Experiment (MFE) (Russell et al., 1995) consists\nof two orthogonal tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers mounted\non nonconducting booms. Electric and magnetic fields were\nsampled at a rate of 16 s\u22121. Most of the presented data were\nspin averaged using least-squares fitting to sine waves.\nThe Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft is\nlocated in a halo orbit around L1 in front of the Earth to\nmonitor interplanetary conditions. The solar wind velocity\nwas measured by the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Al-\npha Monitor (SWEPAM) (McComas et al., 1998). A tri-axial\nfluxgate magnetometer measured the vector interplanetary\nmagnetic field (Smith et al., 1998). We also use data from\nthe Magnetic Field Investigation (Lepping et al., 1995) and\nthe Solar Wind Experiment (Ogilvie et al., 1995) on Wind for\ncross-checks. Wind was executing a distant prograde orbit;\nhence, it generally had large Y coordinates in this interval.\nOn one of the studied days the 4 Cluster spacecraft passed\nthrough the cusp while Polar was skimming the magne-\ntopause. Magnetic field measurements were made on each\nof the Cluster spacecraft by tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers\n(Balogh et al., 2001).\nIn addition to the measurements of the vector magnetic\nfield, the configuration of the 4 Cluster spacecraft allowed\nestimates of \u2207 \u00d7 B to determine local current flows. The\nnominal separation distances between the s pacecraft at this\ntime was \u223c 600 km. The electric field and wave instru-\nment (EFW) monitored both electric field components in the\necliptic plane using biased double probes (Gustafsson et al.,\n1997). The Cluster Ion Spectrometer (CIS) experiment pro-\nvided 3-D ion distributions with mass per unit charge com-\nposition using the Composition and Distribution Function\n(CODIF) analyzer (Re`me et al., 1997). Ion measurements\nare available only from spacecraft 1, 3, and 4.\nIn addition to the satellite measurements, the Super-\nDARN coherent backscatter radar network provided infor-\nmation about ion convection in the high-latitude ionosphere\nover a wide range of local times (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nSingle-component drift measurements from each of the radar\n2236 N.

In panel c the insert shows the configuration of the 4 Cluster\nspacecraft, with Cluster 3 leading and Cluster 4 trailing. The tetrahedron configuration is maintained quite well during the interval of interest.\nSpacecraft separation is of the order of 600 km.\nsites were iterated with an empirical model to estimate\n2-dimensional vector drifts (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998).\n3 Analysis methods\nOur analysis concerns large-scale aspects of coupling be-\ntween the IMF and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system,\nfrom global- to meso-scale perspectives, where electron gy-\nrotropy applies and merging actually occurs (Scudder et al.,\n2002a). We do not consider the microphysics of the merg-\ning process. Addressing problems with simultaneous obser-\nvations from diverse locations properly constrains our inter-\npretations. Analyzing Polar skimming passes presents chal-\nlenges and advantages. Since the magnetopause expands\nand contracts with changing solar wind conditions, multiple\ncrossings often occur. Polar sometimes remains in the vicin-\nity of the magnetopause for hours. While this reduces our\npresent knowledge about spatial structuring, it allows us to\nfollow temporal responses to changes in the IMF and solar\nwind dynamic pressure, and thereby establish close correla-\ntions with external drivers. We correlate observed behaviors\nwith temporal variations in other regions, such as in the iono-\nsphere as measured by SuperDARN, or in the outer cusp as\nmeasured by Cluster.\nInterpretations of satellite measurements were tested for\nreasonableness through comparisons with predictions of sim-\nulations using the Integrated Space Weather Model (ISM).\nISM is a large-scale magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) code\ndeveloped by Mission Research Corporation to simulate the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system from its front boundary\nN.

Traced magnetic field lines from a MHD simulation using the Integrated Space Weather Model (ISM). Figure 2a shows a set of field\nlines flowing away from a high-latitude merging site. Trace 0 is closed, and its origin in the Northern Hemisphere is shown in Fig. 2b to be\nbetween 15 and 16 MLT and 71\u25e6 latitude. All others are open. Figures 2d\u2013f show three views of these same field lines colored with the Y\ncomponent of the velocity.

Lacking the microphysics and resolution\nneeded to accurately portray merging, ISM accomplishes\nthe process through dissipation, either explicitly introduced\nby current dependent resistivity, or introduced by the code\nthrough the partial donor method (PDM) of Hain (1987),\nto maintain stability in the presence of steep gradients (see\nWhite et al., 2001, for more details). Through simulations\nof steady-state conditions or of responses to step-function\ndriver variations, cause and effect relationships are easily iso-\nlated. This approach was used successfully by Maynard et\nal. (2001a; 2003a), to establish the sash (originally identi-\nfied in the simulations by White et al., 1998) as a reconnec-\ntion site, and to provide an explanation for short-lived, sun-\naligned arcs emanating from the high-latitude open-closed\nboundary of the nightside auroral oval. Synergism between\ndata analysis and the simulations provides a powerful tool\nfor understanding the complex interactions of the solar wind\nwith the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.\nPolar often fails to traverse the magnetopause current layer\ncompletely. Hence, we use two markers to identify occur-\nrences of merging. The first is to demonstrate the presence\nof accelerated parallel ion fluxes. Guidance comes from\nthe interpretation of distribution functions given by Cowley\n(1982). Our second marker is the presence of parallel Poynt-\ning flux. Active merging must be communicated away from\nthe site to other regions along the magnetic field lines by\nAlfve\u00b4n waves. Parallel Poynting flux, carried by waves prop-\nagating away from a source, can indicate where active merg-\ning is proceeding. Whereas the dc Poynting flux specifies\nthe transport of energy by convective flow, the wave Poynt-\ning flux, determined from 1E \u00d7 1B, measures energy flow\ncarried by Alfve\u00b4n waves. To calculate the wave Poynting\nflux we subtract the average magnetic field (B0) and elec-\ntric field (E0), determined using a sliding boxcar average of\n3 min, from the measured field quantities. The above cross\nproduct is then taken. When the sharp changes in B occur as\nthe magnetopause current layer is traversed, boxcar averages\ncan allow variations from large-scale changes to contaminate\nthe results. To avoid this problem we terminate the wave\nPoynting flux calculation at the edge of the current layer\n2238 N. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging\nFigure 3\nFig. 3.

(e)\u2013(g) The comparison is\nmade using the variable lag time, calculated using the technique of\nWeimer et al. (2002) and shown by the red trace in panel (d). The\nregion of particular interest is highlighted by the blue box. Note\nthat the lag time is increasing prior to 10:40 UT, then levels off, and\nlater decreases as the directional discontinuity is approached near\n11:00 UT.\nand resume the calculation when the major change in B has\nbeen completed. Calculations using spin-averaged data have\na resolution of 6 s on Polar and 4 s on Cluster. Since there\nare other ways to generate Alfve\u00b4n waves, we look for the\ntemporal concurrence of accelerated ions and parallel Poynt-\ning flux, coming from the same direction, as the signatures\nof merging and indicators of its location with respect to the\nspacecraft.\nTo aid interpretation we establish the variable lag times\nfor IMF features between ACE and Polar. The tilts of phase\nplanes in the solar wind can change on short time scales\n(Maynard et al., 2001b; Weimer et al., 2002). The proper\nlags from ACE to Polar are adjusted by requiring that the\nIMF clock angle in the Y \u2212 Z plane be maintained across\nthe bow-shock (Song et al., 1992). Whenever Polar is in the\nFigure 4\nFig. 4. ACE magnetic field data between 10:00 and 13:00 UT in\nminimum variance coordinates, where i is the direction of maxi-\nmum variance and k is the direction of minimum variance.\nmagnetosheath, this technique can be used. When Polar is in\nthe boundary layer or cusp, we must rely on the availability\nof at least two satellites in the solar wind, to apply the tech-\nnique described by Weimer et al. (2002) and to determine\nhow lag times change.\nWherever possible we look for corroborating data from di-\nverse sites, such as SuperDARN or DMSP satellites in the\nionosphere and\/or Cluster in the cusp. An example in which\ndata from all three sources can be utilized comes from the\n11:00 to 13:00 UT interval on 12 March 2001.\n4 Observations from 12 March 2001\n4.1 Overview\nOn 12 March 2001, the Polar orbit skimmed the subsolar\nmagnetopause while Cluster passed through the Northern\nHemisphere cusp. Figures 1a and b show the X \u2212 Z and\nY \u2212 Z solar magnetospheric (SM) projections of the Polar\norbit. Arrows indicate the direction of spacecraft motion.\nThe region of interest lies inside the red ovals. Polar crossed\nit between 11:00 and 13:00 UT. At 12:00 UT the dipole was\ntilted tailward 0.3\u25e6. Hence, the subsolar point is very close to\nthe XSM axis. Figures 1c and d present the X\u2212Z and X\u2212Y\nprojections of the Cluster orbits in GSE coordinates. Cluster\ncrossed from the lobe to the magnetosheath above the cusp\nbetween 12:00 and 12:30 UT. Red ovals mark the period of\ninterest. The insert in Fig. 1c depicts the tetrahedral config-\nuration of the Cluster satellites at 12:00 UT. Cluster 3 is in\nfront, while Cluster 4 trails the other three. All spacecraft\nwere located slightly post-noon. In addition, SuperDARN\nradar provided estimates of the ionospheric convection pat-\nterns. Thus, we can trace ionospheric responses to activity in\nthe high-altitude cusp and on the dayside magnetopause, and\nfrom there to its sources in the solar wind.\nFigure 2 provides a conceptual context for measurements\nacquired in the various regions. Traced field lines come from\nan ISM simulation using an IMF clock angle of 135\u25e6, similar\nto the angle of 140\u25e6 for the 12 March magnetopause cross-\nN. C.

Comparisons of the components, magnitude and clock angle of the magnetic fields measured at ACE (red and blue) and at Polar\n(black). The lag time is set at 70.5 min for the red ACE traces, which is appropriate for the magnetopause crossing observed at 11:48 UT and\nthe next 15 min. A lag time of 63.5 min (blue ACE traces) was used to bring into alignment the region around the directional discontinuities.\nThe scale for ACE data is one-sixth of that marked.\ning. Last-closed field lines were found starting from the iono-\nsphere in each hemisphere. By moving poleward 10 km in\nthe ionosphere from the trace point of each closed field line,\nwe define a set of \u201cfirst\u201d open field lines. The last-closed\nand first-open field lines are labeled 0 and 1 in Fig. 2a. They\nmap from the black dot in the potential pattern in Fig. 2b,\nnear 15 MLT and 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude, and pass through the\npost-noon cusp. Field-line 0 also traverses the low-latitude\nregion of the post-noon magnetopause. The closed field line\nmaps to near the zero equipotential line between the two con-\nvection cells in the Southern Hemisphere.\nTo understand how the field lines change after merging,\nwe have traced a number of field lines from a series of points\nalong the Northern Hemisphere equipotential that passes\nthrough the origin of trace 0. The first 4 of these, labeled\n2\u20135 in Fig. 2a, show how a field line evolves as it is dragged\nback over the magnetopause. A similar set of field lines\nwas mapped from the equipotential contour in the Southern\nHemisphere at the end of trace 0 and is labeled 2\u2019\u20135\u2019. Line 2\u2019\nprobably pairs best with 2, although there is no way to trace\nthe evolution of exact pairs from a merging site. A high-\nlatitude merging site can be inferred to be located close to\nwhere line 1 bends. Subsequent field lines show how they un-\nbend and traverse back through the cusp, as they are dragged\nantisunward by the solar wind.\nFigure 2c shows the complete set of first-open field lines\ntraced from each hemisphere. The field lines are colored ac-\ncording to VY . The Northern Hemisphere set of field lines\nin Fig. 2a are colored red in Fig. 2c to show their position\nrelative to the first-open field lines. The arrow points to the\napproximate locations of merging. Sharp bends in open field\nlines from the Northern Hemisphere indicate the general lo-\ncations where merging is occurring. Most pre-noon (post-\nnoon) field lines have a negative (positive) VY . Exceptions\nto this are in the cusp, where J\u00d7 B forces from the currents\nassociated with the curvature of newly-merged field lines to\ndrive the flow westward (eastward) in the Northern (South-\nern) Hemisphere (Siscoe et al., 2000). Note that the velocity\nseparator is not the merging separator. The more vertical ve-\nlocity separator results when the merging J\u00d7 B forces over-\ncome the normal hydrodynamic flow away from the nose.

The circles highlight parallel or antiparallel accelerated ion fluxes associated with a contact and a crossing of the\nmagnetopause.\nfield lines in the upper left indicate that most are pulling away\nfrom high-latitude merging sites in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe fact that the velocity separator is so much different from\nthe separation of traced field lines is further evidence that\nlow-latitude component merging is not a dominant process\nin the simulation. Figures 2d\u2013f display the front, top, and\nside views of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s closed and open\nfield lines in Fig. 2a, colored with VY . Plasma flow in the\nboundary layer on the closed field line (0) is toward dusk.\nFlow above (in) the cusp on line 1 is toward dusk (dawn).\nSubsequently, the flow is toward dawn, both above and in the\ncusp, as the field line is dragged back through the mantle.\nThe primary flow direction near the magnetopause and in\nthe outer portion of the boundary layer is determined by the\ndiversion of flow from pressure gradients away from the stag-\nnation region. Cowley and Owen (1989) have provided a\nmodel of the flow, which combines the effects of the hydro-\ndynamic diversion of flow from a stagnation point with the\nmagnetic tension effects from merging. Siscoe et al. (2002)\nargue that the stagnation point should, in fact, be a stagna-\ntion line along the magnetic field line that passes through the\nnominal stagnation point at the nose.\nThus, ISM suggests that with merging at high latitudes in\nthe Northern Hemisphere, Polar should observe flow away\nfrom noon at its post-noon location. In the post-noon cusp,\nthe open boundary layer can maintain movement toward\ndusk, corresponding to the flow in the magnetosheath. Due\nto merging, the outer separatrix should initially continue to\nmove toward dusk (applicable to Cluster as it passes through\nthe magnetopause above the cusp), while the inner separatrix\n(as well as the foot of the field line) is pulled toward dawn.\nN. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging 2241\n4.2 Interplanetary conditions\nIMF measurements were made by the Wind and ACE space-\ncraft located near (\u221237,\u2212165, 8) and (227,\u221238, 4)RE , re-\nspectively. Figures 3a\u2013c show the three IMF components ob-\nserved at the locations of the two spacecraft. Data are refer-\nenced to the UT of ACE measurements. Wind data (green)\nwere lagged according to advection times based on the solar\nwind velocities measured at ACE (plotted as the green trace\nin Fig. 3d). The agreement between the traces in Figs. 3a\u2013c is\nonly moderate. This is especially evident beyond 10:00 UT.\nHowever, Weimer et al. (2002) showed that agreement could\nbe improved by allowing for the lag time to vary on a minute-\nby-minute basis. Figures 3e\u2013g show the same data (Wind\ndata is colored red) using the calculated variable lag, which\nis plotted as the red trace in Fig. 3d. The variable lag reflects\nconstantly changing tilts of IEF phase planes.\nOur analysis focuses on the interval 10:00\u201312:00 UT. This\ninterval is dominated by a large decrease in magnetic field\nstrength between 11:12 to 11:50 UT (magnetic hole), shown\nin Fig. 4. A directional discontinuity occurs, probably ro-\ntational, during which GSM BY goes from positive to neg-\native, and at 11:08 UT BZ becomes less negative, preced-\ning the sharp drop in B and reversal of BZ by a few min-\nutes. The combined structure bears resemblance to a con-\nfiguration observed in the interplanetary medium in front\nof a magnetic cloud on 24 December 1996, by Farrugia et\nal. (2001). The magnetic field decrease was interpreted as\na slow shock, which, coupled with the preceding rotational\ndiscontinuity, could be the signature of an upstream recon-\nnection layer. The structure at ACE is approximately planar.\nMinimum variance analysis of the 3-h interval found a well-\ndefined maximum variance plane with a normal component\nof \u22121.64\u00b10.66, consistent with the reconnection interpreta-\ntion advanced by Farrugia et al. (2001) for the 24 December\n1996 event. Figure 4 displays the three components and mag-\nnitude in principal axis coordinates. Polar observations at the\nmagnetopause were acquired before and near the directional-\ndiscontinuity passage.\n4.3 Polar observations\nPolar encountered the magnetopause current layer several\ntimes before crossing the magnetopause at 11:48 UT. Vari-\nable lags help to establish the applicable solar wind condi-\ntions at that time. Figure 5 compares the three components\nand magnitude of B, along with clock-angle measurements at\nACE and Polar during the interval from 11:00 to 13:00 UT.\nPlot scales were adjusted to reflect the factor of 6 increase\nafter traversing the bow-shock. The ACE data were lagged\nby 70.5 min (red traces). The lag was determined by best\nmatching the Polar and ACE clock angles between 11:50\nand 12:05 UT. Note that it is different from the lag between\nACE and Wind, displayed in Fig. 3, because of the differ-\nent locations. This lag is good through 12:08 UT, when the\nfirst of the two directional discontinuities seen in the ACE\nand Wind data were sampled by Polar in the magnetosheath.\nAccelerated\nmagnetosheath\nBackground\nmagnetosphere\na\nb\nc\nFig. 7. Ion distribution plots for the interval of first contact with the\nmagnetopause indicated by the first circle in Fig. 5.\nThe lag time decreased as the directional discontinuity struc-\ntures approached. The variable lag time shown in Fig. 3d\nbetween ACE and Wind also was decreasing before the time\nof that structure, apparently due to the changed BX. In Fig. 5\nthe blue traces represent the ACE data with a 63.5-min de-\nlay, which is more appropriate for times at the arrival of the\ndirectional discontinuities. The decreased lag significantly\nimproves the fit between 12:10 and 12:18 UT. The fit in the\ncenter of the magnetic hole has further variations in lag. The\ndirectional discontinuities have similar normals to those de-\ntermined at ACE and at Wind, showing that they have main-\ntained coherence while passing through the bow-shock. Far-\nrugia et al. (1991) found that the planarity is maintained in\nthe magnetosheath but the orientation may change somewhat\n2242 N. C.

Ion distribution plots for the magnetopause crossing interval indicated by the second circle in Fig. 5.\non the passage through the bow-shock. Coherent passage\nthrough the magnetosheath is important for establishing the\nrelative timing and interpretation of Cluster measurements.\nNote the presence of a magnetic hole centered at\u223c12:30 UT,\nwhen the magnitude of B measured at Polar is less than the\nexpected shocked and lagged magnitude from ACE. We note\nin Fig. 3 that B was also smaller at Wind in the middle of\nthis structure, and suggest that ACE did not sample the mini-\nmum B within the magnetic hole. The clock angle at the time\nof the magnetopause crossing was approximately 140\u25e6, sim-\nilar to that of the ISM simulation discussed above relative to\nFig. 2.\nFigures 6b\u2013e depict the energy spectra for the parallel, per-\npendicular, antiparallel and total ion energy flux. To place\nthese particle measurements in context, Fig. 6a shows Po-\nlar measurements of BZ (red for positive and blue for neg-\native) and BY (green trace). The first contact with the mag-\nnetopause occurred at 11:39 UT, as indicated by a burst of\nantiparallel ions (Fig. 6d). These fluxes occur while BY re-\nversed to positive (Fig. 6a) and BZ (as well as the magnitude\nof B) dipped. This is a good example of a partial entry into\nthe magnetopause layer. Note too that bursts of parallel and\nantiparallel ion fluxes were seen during the magnetopause\ncrossing at 11:48 UT. Both of these regions are highlighted\nby circles and are discussed in more detail below.\nTwo additional unique features of the spectrograms should\nbe noted. First, there is a lack of plasma in the magne-\ntosheath just outside the magnetopause. In a separate pa-\nper, Maynard et al. (2003b) establish that this is a depletion\nlayer. It is one of two types for southward IMF predicted by\nISM simulations. Second, magnetosheath particles, includ-\ning parallel and antiparallel fluxes, are also seen during the\npassage of the directional discontinuities. These fluxes are\nintense and have higher energies in the parallel components.\nMagnetosheath ions are often more biased toward perpen-\ndicular \u201cpancake\u201d distributions as the magnetopause is ap-\nN.

The dominance of the perpendicular fluxes is seen\nin low fluxes of the depletion layer region between 11:50 and\n12:00 UT. The various regions are noted at the top of the plot.\nFigure 7 shows 3 ion-distribution plots accumulated be-\ntween 11:39 and 11:44 UT, within the first circle of Fig. 6d.\nThe ion fluxes were shifted in velocity space by the perpen-\ndicular electron velocity, as the best proxy for the magnetic\nfield line velocity. To create the distributions, symmetry was\nassumed around the parallel axis. Points of actual measure-\nment are indicated by black dots (above parallel axis). No\nmeasurements exist between the white lines and the parallel\naxis, as this marks the closest approach of the particle detec-\ntors to the magnetic field direction in the analysis interval.\nFor this time when Polar was on the magnetosphere side of\nthe current layer, Fig. 7a shows a cold central core and an\naccelerated population, well displaced from zero, moving in\nthe negative B direction, or coming from north of the space-\ncraft. From expectations for locations on the inner separa-\ntrix (Cowley, 1982), we interpret the accelerated population\nas being primarily of magnetosheath origin, but with a cen-\ntral core of reflected, accelerated, magnetosphere ions. Fig-\nures 7b and c also show similar distributions but with smaller\ndisplacements. These distributions indicate a merging-line\nsource to the north of Polar\u2019s location.\nFigure 8 displays 4 ion-distribution plots at the time of\nthe 11:48 UT magnetopause crossing. Figures 8a and b were\ntaken at locations on the inside of the current layer, while\nFigs. 8c and d are from locations on the outside of the cur-\nrent layer. Figures 8c and d indicate pancake-like magne-\ntosheath distributions, centered about the origin. An acceler-\nated, cold magnetospheric population is seen along B, com-\ning from poleward of the spacecraft. Observed perpendic-\nular energies are comparable to the unaccelerated magneto-\nsphere distributions seen in Fig. 7. Figure 8a depicts an ac-\ncelerated magnetosheath distribution with the cold magneto-\nspheric background. Again, the acceleration is from north of\nthe spacecraft, which was located at \u223c 16\u25e6 magnetic latitude\nand 13:10 MLT. In Fig. 8b the distinctions are blurred; how-\never, we suggest that the ion acceleration was weaker and\nparallel to the magnetic field, or comes from a location equa-\ntorward of the spacecraft. How far from the spacecraft is not\ndiscernable.\nTo strengthen our interpretation that these two magne-\ntopause encounters reflect merging events located poleward\nof the spacecraft, the three components of the wave Poynting\nvector (S) are plotted in Fig. 9. The background magnetic-\nfield components are provided as red lines for reference.\nPlots in Figs. 9a\u2013d show the three GSM components and the\n2244 N. C.

Between 11:39 and 11:44 UT\nSZ was negative (as was S||), in agreement with the direc-\ntion of the ion acceleration. In the traversal of the magne-\ntopause current layer the calculation was interrupted to avoid\ncontamination. The negative SZ on the outside of the layer is\nagain in agreement with the direction of particle acceleration.\nThus, these two encounters pass our empirical tests for merg-\ning events at locations poleward of the spacecraft. In fact, we\nsee enhancements in S at 11:39, 11:43, and 11:48 UT, sug-\ngesting intensification in the merging rate at those times.\nThe normal direction for the full magnetopause crossing\nwas found using the minimum variance technique of Son-\nnerup and Ledley (1974). The normal component was small,\nbut directed outward from the magnetopause, consistent with\nthe merging occurring to the north of the spacecraft. As a\nfurther check on the rotational nature of this crossing, a suc-\ncessful Wale\u00b4n test across the full current layer using electrons\n(Scudder et al., 1999) resulted in a slope of nearly \u22121, indi-\ncating that the source of the rotation is above the spacecraft.\n4.4 Cluster observations\nNearer to perigee, Cluster crossed spatial regions more\nquickly than Polar. Figure 10 presents the three GSM compo-\nnents, and the magnitude of the magnetic field measured by\nthe 4 Cluster spacecraft between 12:00 and 12:30 UT. Cluster\nexited the mantle into the high-altitude cusp near 12:05 UT\nand crossed the magnetopause current layer out of the cusp\ninto the magnetosheath between 12:13:50 and 12:15:00 UT.\nThe magnitude of B increased as the satellites exited the\nhigh-altitude cusp. The biggest change during this crossing\nevent was in the Y component. Each of the spacecraft saw\nthe change at slightly different times, with Cluster 3 (Cluster\n4) observing the change first (last), indicating that the change\nis primarily of a spatial nature. The order of crossing (3, 1,\n2, 4) is consistent with the spacecraft configuration shown in\nFig. 1c, showing Cluster 3 (4) leading (trailing). The subse-\nquent BY reversal between 12:16 and 12:17 UT did not result\nfrom Cluster crossing back into the cusp. Rather, it reflects\nthe encounters with the first of two IMF directional disconti-\nnuities observed earlier by Polar. Note that all four spacecraft\nN. C.

Note that once Cluster has exited the\ncurrent layer at the boundary the measured magnetic fields in the magnetosheath match in magnitude, direction and clock angle.\ndetected the negative shift in BY at nearly the same time, in-\ndicating that this change is temporal. For a magnetosheath\nvelocity of 100 km\/s it would take 6 s for a feature to cross\nthe satellite configuration. In fact, with a 4-min lag Clus-\nter and Polar data are in excellent agreement after 12:15 UT.\nFigure 11 compares Cluster 3 and Polar magnetic field data\nwith this lag applied to the Cluster measurements. BZ sub-\nsequently also reversed polarity as it did at the location of\nPolar. At that time the magnitude of B also decreased. Be-\ncause Polar saw the same directional and magnitude changes\nin the magnetosheath, we can safely conclude that these ex-\nhibit magnetosheath features rather than a reentry into the\ncusp. Key features of the combined data set are marked by\narrows. As the constellation penetrated further into the mag-\nnetosheath, the lag between Polar and Cluster observations\ndecreased slightly. This fits expectations, since the obser-\nvations are made before the structure fully draped over the\nmagnetopause. Minimum variance analysis of the magnetic\nfield from each of the Cluster spacecraft at the magnetopause\ncrossing and the directional discontinuities provided normals\nthat were stable between the spacecraft. They were also sta-\nble between the magnetopause crossing and the BY reversal,\nindicating that the discontinuity was draped along the mag-\nnetopause orientation. All of the structure detected between\n12:13 and 12:17 UT was planar on the scale of the spacecraft\nseparation and aligned parallel to the magnetopause bound-\nary. The normal to the BZ reversal near 12:20 UT was simi-\nlar, but slightly tilted.\nFigure 12 presents spectrograms of ion energy fluxes\nmeasured in the antiparallel (140\u25e6\u2013180\u25e6) and perpendicular\n(80\u25e6\u20131\u25e6) direction by CIS on Cluster 3, Cluster 1 and Clus-\nter 4. In all cases the parallel flux (not shown) was much\nweaker. Three distinct features, which occur at staggered\ntimes, are highlighted by dashed lines. The first is an increase\nin energy seen at 12:06 UT by Cluster 3, 12:06:10 by Clus-\nter 1 and 12:06:50 UT by Cluster 4. The increase is more\npronounced in the antiparallel fluxes. The second feature\nis similar, occurring between 12:10:50 and 12:11:30. The\n2246 N. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging\nFigure 12\nFig. 12. Ion energy spectrograms measured by the CIS instruments on Clusters 1,3 and 4. Antiparallel and perpendicular fluxes are shown\nfor each spacecraft. Cluster 3 is shown first as it is the lead spacecraft (see Fig. 1c).\nthird feature was seen in the perpendicular fluxes starting at\n12:14 UT at Cluster 3. In this case the intensification starts at\nlow-energies, then spreads to higher energies. From Fig. 10,\nwe see that this increase started as each spacecraft exited the\ncurrent layer. After this time ion fluxes are more typical of\nmagnetosheath flowing away from the subsolar stagnation re-\ngion. Subsequently, measured energies were generally lower\nand the spectral width broader. Based on ion spectral charac-\nteristics, and the clear correlations of the magnetometer mea-\nsurements with those from Polar, the features subsequent to\n12:16 UT are of magnetosheath and solar wind origin. Be-\ntween 12:14 and 12:15 UT the antiparallel fluxes are intense\nand higher in energy at Cluster 4, as expected from an active\nmerging site located equatorward of the Cluster spacecraft.\nFigures 13b\u2013d show from Cluster 4 perpendicular H+ ve-\nlocities (VH in blue) overlaid onto E \u00d7 B velocities (VE in\nmagenta) in GSM coordinates for the interval between 12:00\nand 12:20 UT from Cluster 4. The velocities compare very\nclosely. A 1.5 mV\/m sunward electric field offset has been\nsubtracted from the GSE X-axis EFW electric field data to\nmake this comparison. The magnitude of the offset was se-\nlected to maximize the correlation. Sunward directed er-\nror fields are related to asymetries in the spacecraft sheath\ncaused by photoemission (Cauffman and Maynard, 1974).\nN. C.

From Fig. 2 we expect that the ve-\nlocity in the boundary layer was northward and toward dusk,\nexcept where active merging is occurring. Newly-merged\nfield lines are pulled toward dawn soon after the merging\ntakes place. Plasma velocities in the mantle have an anti-\nsunward component. Three regions of negative excursions\nin VHY and VEY are seen and are marked by black under-\nscores. Spacecraft 4 was the last of the Cluster spacecraft to\ntraverse the boundary. VE from all four spacecraft are shown\nin Figs. 13e\u2013g. Similar offset corrections have been made on\neach of the other spacecraft. On Cluster 3 a negative excur-\nsion in VEY (green) was briefly seen just before 12:14 UT,\nindicating that this apparent temporal enhancement in merg-\ning lasted for over 1 min and had spatial scales on the or-\nder of the satellite separation. Other negative excursions in\nVHY occurred near 12:06 and 12:11 UT, in addition to the\nlarger one between 12:14 and 12:15 UT. Note also the signif-\nicant positive VZ , along with the enhanced VY that occurs as\nthe spacecraft exit the current layer into the magnetosheath.\nThese velocities are consistent with the pictures in Fig. 2.\nFigure 14\nPoynting flux - Cluster - March 12, 2001\na\nb\nc\nd\n1200 1210 1220\nTime (UT)\nFig. 14.

Figure 14d shows the parallel components. The\nwave Poynting flux is in the antiparallel direction, with peaks\nin the interval between 12:11 and 12:11:40, indicating that\nthe satellite was above the source. Note the variability be-\ntween the 4 spacecraft, which indicates that the structure had\ndimensions of the order of the spacecraft separation. En-\nhancements are also seen after 12:13:50 UT, but the proxim-\nity to the major current layer prevented the determination of\nthe flux through the third region of velocity enhancement in\nFig. 13. Small variations were also seen in the first inter-\nval of velocity enhancement. All three intervals have been\nhighlighted by the black bar for comparison to Fig. 13. The\nvariability in both time and space suggests that the merging\nprocess is non-steady. Considering both the accelerated ions\nand the Poynting flux, we infer that Cluster is near the outer\nseparatrix of an active merging site equatorward of the space-\ncraft.\nThe Cluster configuration was favorable for determining\nthe currents from curl B (Dunlop et al., 2002). Figure 15\ndisplays local currents derived using a GSM coordinate sys-\ntem centered on Cluster 2. Also plotted are the divergence\nof B as a percentage of curl B and the magnitude of B at\nthe locations of the four spacecraft. If the calculations were\nperformed without error, Maxwell\u2019s equations demand that\n\u2207 \u00b7B = 0. Currents determined where the divergence-to-curl\nratio exceeds 50% should be treated with caution. In general,\nfor this configuration, the expected error in J is at minimum\n20%. Most of the large values of the divergence occur when\nthe currents are small, highlighting their uncertainty. How-\never, when the currents are large, the divergence ratio is, in\ngeneral, small, indicating where the calculated currents are\n2248 N. C.

The curl B calculation integrates the cur-\nrents over the scale size of the tetrahedron (\u223c 600 km). The\nlargest current was detected between 12:14 and 12:15 UT and\nis primarily in the+Z and\u2212X directions, noted by the green\nbars. It takes the four spacecraft over a minute to cross the\nmain current layer, indicating its temporal stability. Thus,\nthe center of this current should be well resolved. Coun-\nterclockwise Chapman-Ferraro currents on the dusk edge of\nthe cusp have the anticipated direction. Note that between\n12:16 and 12:17 UT, when the directional discontinuity was\ncrossed, the current determination was less accurate; how-\never, the direction was\u2212Z, opposite to the Chapman-Ferraro\ncurrents, confirming our interpretation that Cluster did not\npass back through the boundary current layer.\nJY is the most variable component showing both polari-\nties, although the strongest are currents in the \u2212Y direction.\nSome of the variability could occur if the current scale size\nwas less than that of the Cluster configuration. Currents from\nstructures of scale size less than 600 km may suffer from this\nerror. Attention is directed to negative JY excursions ob-\nserved between 12:06 and 12:07, 12:11 and 12:11:40, and\n12:14:30 and 12:15 UT, marked by red bars. There is also\nan associated smaller \u2212JX excursion. These correspond to\ntimes when negative VHY and VEY excursions were observed\nby the Cluster spacecraft (black bars in Fig. 13). This sug-\ngests that these currents are related to temporally varying\nmerging. Close to these times enhanced parallel ion and\nPoynting fluxes, our indicators of merging, were detected.\nThe merging site must be south of the spacecraft, and the\nmerging rate must be varying on minute scales to produce\nthe observed three pulses. When we consider that Polar was\nshowing temporally varying merging at high latitudes 20 min\nN. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging 2249\nprevious, the implications are that this also involves time-\nvarying high-latitude merging. The next section relates these\nenhancements to intensification of ionospheric plasma veloc-\nities measured by SuperDARN radars.\n4.5 SuperDARN measurements\nEach SuperDARN radar measures the velocity component\ntoward and away from the transmitter. To infer the large-\nscale flow pattern, the Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998) \u201cmap\npotential\u201d technique was employed. Line-of-sight (l-o-s) ve-\nlocity measurements from multiple radars are fitted to an ex-\npansion of the electrostatic potential in spherical harmonics,\nto yield large-scale global convection maps. First, the l-o-s\ndata are filtered and mapped to a polar grid. These \u201cgrid-\nded\u201d measurements are then used to determine a solution\nfor the electrostatic potential distribution that is most consis-\ntent with the available measurements. Velocities should fall\nalong plasma streamlines in the modeled pattern. Backscat-\nter targets within the radar field-of-view are not always avail-\nable, and significant areas exist outside the reach of the radar\nsystem. The statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Green-\nwald (1996), parameterized by IMF conditions, is used to\nstabilize the solution in regions where no measurements are\nmade. Figure 16 presents dayside Northern Hemisphere\nionospheric convection patterns, each averaged over the in-\nterval given at the top. Dotted concentric semicircles indicate\nlines of constant magnetic latitude in 5\u25e6 increments. Noon is\nlocated at the top of each pattern. During the period from\n11:00 to 12:15 UT, SuperDARN was observing velocity en-\nhancements in the 14 to 15 MLT region between 70 to 75\u25e6.\nFigures 16a and b show these enhancements by comparing\ntwo consecutive patterns near the 11:48 UT Polar magne-\ntopause crossing. The orange circle highlights the region of\nvelocity enhancement, indicated by increased numbers of red\ndrift vectors in the right pattern compared to the left. Note\nthat the enhancement is localized, in the same region that\nthe open-closed field line pair is mapped to in the simulation\ndepicted in Fig. 2b, and occurs 1\u20132 min after the enhanced\nparallel fluxes were seen at Polar. We suggest that the delay\nis related to differences in Alfve\u00b4n travel times. The signature\nin the ionosphere should lag that in the outer cusp by the or-\nder of a minute, due to Alfve\u00b4n wave propagation time. The\nSuperDARN patterns show numerous increases in velocity in\nthis general area over the hour-plus period.\nTo show the time variability, a search was made in the\nSuperDARN data for the largest velocity in the region and\nits location. The magnitude, the components, and the loca-\ntion are plotted in Fig. 17. The time of the three enhance-\nments in merging observed at Polar are noted by the verti-\ncal red lines. The corresponding velocity peaks at Super-\nDARN are highlighted by the red dots. Within the interval\nthat Polar was probing the magnetopause, these are the only\npeaks. Subsequent peaks starting at 12:06 UT correspond\nto the interval where Cluster observed evidence of merging.\nFigures 16c and d show SuperDARN potential patterns and\nvectors for intervals that contain the first 2 velocity and cur-\nrent enhancements at Cluster, depicted in velocities in Fig. 13\nand currents in Fig. 15. Returning to Fig. 17, the velocity and\ncurrent enhancements observed by Cluster and noted by the\nblue dots correspond to three velocity enhancements seen at\nSuperDARN. Those periods are noted by the blue ovals in\nFig. 15. Since Cluster observations come from above the\ncusp on the outer separatrix, while SuperDARN is looking at\nthe response at the foot of the field line, we suggest that the\ndifference in times from Alfve\u00b4n wave propagation may be\nless than those observed by Polar. Note that no peaks above\n800 m s\u22121 occur after 12:15 UT. The velocity enhancements\nare in the region predicted by the simulation as being tied\nto high-latitude merging. The correspondence with the Po-\nlar magnetopause merging encounters suggests that Super-\nDARN and Polar are observing the opposite exhaust regions\nof a time-varying active high-latitude merging line. Continu-\ning the correlation with Cluster, we are able to relate 3 more\npeaks in the SuperDARN velocities to time varying merging.\nThe implications from considering the 2-h period of Super-\nDARN velocities is that the rate of merging varies often and\nconsiderably. The location may be just as variable.\n4.6 Summary of the 12 March observations\nFrom the observations presented above we may conclude for\nthis day when the IMF clock angle was about 140\u25e6 that:\n1. Polar, while skimming the nose of the magnetosphere,\nobserved the effects of merging at high latitudes. Ac-\ncelerated ions and wave Poynting flux were used as dis-\ncriminators for the existence of merging. While the ex-\nact location of merging is not discernable from the data,\nit was above the spacecraft, which, in turn, was well\nabove the component merging line location of Gonza-\nlez and Mozer (1974).\n2. The merging rate was temporally varying, as indicated\nby both Polar and Cluster measurements.\n3. SuperDARN observed enhancements in the flow in the\nionosphere associated with these time-dependent merg-\ning events observed at Polar. Polar, near the subso-\nlar magnetopause and SuperDARN in the high-latitude\nionosphere, monitored both exhaust regions. From Su-\nperDARN observations we may also infer that varia-\ntions in the merging rate occurred continuously for more\nthan an hour.\n4. Cluster continued the correlation, placing the merging\nlocation below the satellite, which was located above\nthe cusp. Both SuperDARN and Cluster observed ef-\nfects of time-varying merging.\n5. Flow in the boundary layer and adjacent magnetosheath\nwas generally away from the sub-solar region unless\nspecifically diverted by merging. In a time dependent\nprocess, boundary layer flows vary continuously.\n6. Two directional discontinuities and an associated mag-\nnetic hole were imposed on the magnetosphere system\n2250 N. C.

Adjacent to the magnetopause, Polar observed a deple-\ntion layer, implications of which are further discussed\nby Maynard et al. (2003b).\n5 Other events\nTable 1 summarizes all of the merging events investigated\nto date, using wave Poynting flux and accelerated ions as\ndiscriminators. The events are organized according to the\napplicable IMF clock angle (third column). The fourth col-\numn lists our best estimates of the merging locations. Note\nthat the measurements provide information about whether\nthe site is to the north or south the spacecraft. For a number\nof events we calculated the difference between the spacecraft\nlocation and the component merging line of Gonzalez and\nMozer (1974). The differences are listed in the last column.\nDuring periods when the ions and Poynting flux propagated\nfrom north of Polar and the differences are significant, we\nlabeled the merging location as being at high latitudes. The\nlast column also comments on special circumstances prevail-\ning during each pass. If the ions and Poynting flux originated\nsouth of Polar, we were unable to discern from the mea-\nsurements alone, whether the merging line is near the equa-\ntor or at high southern latitudes. Question marks indicate\ninstances when assigned merging locations are ambiguous.\nThe event of 05:48 UT on 1 April 2001 is labeled \u201cclose\u201d\nbecause Mozer et al. (2002) interpreted signatures obtained\nduring this magnetopause crossing as indicating proximity to\nthe separator. In some cases we relied on SuperDARN mea-\nsurements and ISM predictions to identify merging locations.\nThese are noted in column 5. The event at 05:05 UT on 16\nApril 2000 included episodic encounters with fluxes from the\nnorth and south of the spacecraft. We address this further in\nthe discussion. During the two passes of 31 March 2001, Po-\nlar did not enter the dayside magnetosphere because of the\nhigh activity and very compressed conditions. In each case\nPolar crossed from the mantle to the magnetosheath above\nthe cusp as noted in the comments.\nFor applicable clock angles of 150\u25e6 or less in the events of\nTable 1, merging generally occurred poleward of the space-\ncraft and was inferred to be at high latitudes. This conclusion\nshould be substantiated in the analysis of more events; how-\never, it is clear that one must consider high-latitude merg-\nN. C.

Our measurements suggest that low-latitude\nor component merging is indicated only when BZ was the\ndominant IMF component.\n6 Discussion\nWe have used observations of accelerated particles and wave\nPoynting vectors as our primary indicators as to whether\nmerging has occurred and, if so, where. As demonstrated\nabove, both flux types provide necessary, but not sufficient,\nconditions for identifying merging events. Establishing that\nthe boundary is a rotational discontinuity adds a third nec-\nessary indicator of merging. Since rotational discontinu-\nities may be found in any magnetohydrodynamic flow, in-\ncluding those that do not involve reconnection, a success-\nful Wale\u00b4n test, by itself, is not a sufficient test to conclude\nthat merging geometries have been encountered. However,\nthe magnetopause-sheath interface is generally thought to in-\nclude such a structure to form a locally open boundary. In\nthis spirit a successful Wale\u00b4n test (with electrons) with slope\n\u00b11 is associated with a potential merging site, whose X-line\nseparator will, in general, be well removed from the space-\ncraft\u2019s trajectory. Successful Wale\u00b4n tests to establish the ro-\ntational discontinuities, in conjunction with observations of\naccelerated particles, have been the primary empirical cri-\nteria for identifying merging events. Recently, Scudder et\nal. (2002a) reported small-scale breaking of both ion and\nelectron gyrotropy, as well as parallel electric fields within\nmerging regions poleward of the cusp during an interval of\nnorthward IMF. In the events considered here, observations\nwere made away from the separator region. Thus, we rely\non signatures recognized as strong indicators, but not con-\nclusive proof, that merging has occurred. With this caveat in\n2252 N. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging\nTable 1.

We first comment on the use of\nPoynting flux as a discriminator. We next comment on some\nspatialtemporal implications of the observations.\n6.1 Wave Poynting flux as a merging discriminator\nWhen electron gyrotropy is broken and merging takes place\nat an X-line (Scudder et al., 2002a), magnetic field energy is\nconverted into particle kinetic energy, and the magnetic field\nconfiguration in the \u201cdiffusion\u201d region changes. This infor-\nmation must be conveyed away from the separator along the\nmerged field lines. Atkinson (1992), following earlier cal-\nculations by Sonnerup and Wang (1987), showed that Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves propagate away from the diffusion region, carrying the\nfield-aligned currents (FAC) needed to discharge Hall elec-\ntric fields that develop in the collisionless merging process.\nThese FACs are carried by electrons (since the ions cannot\nrespond in these thin layers) with relatively large drift speeds\nparallel to B, having parallel electron Alfve\u00b4n Mach num-\nbers as high as 4, as recently been reported by Scudder et\nal. (2002a). These parallel currents can be seen to flow along\nthe separatrices in the Hall MHD simulations of Ma and\nBhattacharjee (2001). FACs are carried by obliquely prop-\nagating Alfve\u00b4n waves (Siscoe, 1983). We expect to detect\nAlfve\u00b4n waves propagating away from active merging sites\nalong the separatrices.\nWave Poynting vectors were calculated using CRRES\nelectric and magnetic field data by Maynard et al. (1996a),\nto determine locations of energy release at substorm onset.\nWhile most calculations were performed with spin-averaged\nmeasurements, Maynard et al. (1996b) were able to achieve\nhigher time resolution using despun data acquired during one\nCRRES pass. No significant power was found at frequencies\nabove the Pi-2 range, covered by spin-averaged electromag-\nnetic fields. A similar test was performed here. The power\nlevels in both the high resolution E and B were significantly\nless at higher frequencies than at frequencies below the ion\ngyrofrequency. A check of the angle between S and B in-\ndicated that S was nearly field-aligned during the enhance-\nments at the magnetopause. Thus, the data are consistent\nwith Alfve\u00b4n waves occurring at the magnetopause encounters\nwhere merging is claimed. The magnitudes of wave Poynting\nvectors generally peak below one-third to one-half of the to-\ntal Poynting flux values. The peaks occurred at places where\nPolar encountered accelerated ions.\nA further example of wave Poynting flux observations at a\nmerging separatrix, from 31 March 2001, is given in Fig. 18.\nIn this pass Polar crossed from the Southern Hemisphere\nmantle directly into the magnetosheath, without encounter-\ning the dayside magnetosphere. Figure 18a displays the par-\nallel wave Poynting flux. The magnitude and Y and Z com-\nponents of B are shown in Figs. 18b and c. Figures 18d\u2013f\nshow the parallel, perpendicular and anti-parallel ions. Note\nthat strong fluxes of accelerated parallel ions occurred in co-\nincidence with the parallel wave Poynting flux. Three exam-\nples of ion distribution plots are given in Figs. 18g\u2013i. Strong\nacceleration appears in each spectrum. After encountering\nthese fluxes, Polar entered the magnetosheath, characterized\nby weak, perpendicular fluxes, identified as a depletion layer\n(Maynard et al., 2003b). The accelerated particles are in-\nN. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging 2253\na\nb\nd\nc\ne\nf\ng h i\nFigure 18\nFig. 18. Correlation of the wave Poynting flux measured by Polar above the cusp on 31 March 2001, with accelerated particles associated\nwith the outer separatrix separating open magnetic field lines from IMF magnetic field lines in the magnetosheath.\nterpreted as moving along the outer separatrix from a low-\nlatitude merging site, that divides newly-opened field lines\nbeing added to the mantle, from magnetosheath field lines\ntied to the IMF on both ends.\nWe conclude that the wave Poynting flux provides a good\ndiscriminator to indicate when merging takes place and the\ndirection of the merging site with respect to the measuring\nspacecraft. However, sources of Alfve\u00b4n waves other than\nmerging may be available. Thus, their presence must be clas-\nsified as necessary but not sufficient as a condition to estab-\nlish that merging is occurring.\n6.2 Location\nThe 12 March data indicate that Polar detected signatures\nof merging events, far removed from a near equatorial com-\nponent merging line (Gonzalez and Mozer, 1974). This is\ntrue for many events listed in Table 1 with IMF clock an-\ngles < 150\u25e6. The measurements indicate that merging oc-\ncurs at high latitudes under a variety of conditions. In other\nevents the particle and Poynting fluxes were clearly propagat-\ning from south of the spacecraft. These signatures appear to\nbe consistent with either component merging near the equa-\ntor or antiparallel merging at high latitudes in the conjugate\nhemisphere.\n2254 N. C.

Traced magnetic field lines using MHD simulations with three different dipole tilt angles using ISM. Black field lines are closed.\nRed field lines are open with one foot in the Northern Hemisphere. Green field lines have both feet in the solar wind. The results are presented\nin both SM and GSM coordinates.\nAn intriguing event occurred on 16 April 2000, when the\nIMF clock angle was near 180\u25e6, but the inferred merging site\nwas to the north of the Polar\u2019s location. The measurements\nwere made at \u223c05:20 UT, when Earth\u2019s dipole axis tilted to-\nward midnight. We have conducted a series of ISM simu-\nlations with increasing dipole tilts to determine whether off-\nequatorial merging can occur with 180\u25e6 clock angles. Fig-\nure 19 displays traces of magnetic field lines that are closed\n(black), have one foot in the Northern Hemisphere (red) or\nhave both feet in the interplanetary medium (green), for 3\ndifferent dipole tilt angles. Simulation results are presented\nin both SM and GSM coordinates. In both coordinate sys-\ntems the red (open) field lines indicate that for dipole tilts\n\u2265 8\u25e6, merging moves away from the equator to higher lat-\nitudes. These are not extreme tilt angles. These conditions\nare met every day as the dipole rotates with UT. We note\nthat ISM simulations incorporate current-dependent explicit\nresistivity, which typically turns on near the equatorial mag-\nnetopause to force dissipation, to aid merging. The code can\nplace dissipation wherever it chooses via PDM to keep gradi-\nents in check. Thus, ISM predictions of merging away from\nthe equator indicate a clear preference of the code for high-\nlatitude merging. Recall too that BX serves to increase or\ndecrease the effective dipole tilt (e.g. Crooker, 1992). Thus,\nover the course of the day at particular UTs merging may be\npreferred away from the equator, even with a nearly south-\nward IMF. Thus, one should not automatically assume that\nmerging must be confined to low latitudes. We have added\nquestion marks in Table 1 to events with particle and field\nsignatures indicating merging sites south of the spacecraft.\nIn some cases, when BY is significant, we suggest that merg-\ning locations may be southern high latitudes.\nN. C. Maynard et al.: High-latitude merging 2255\nTwo events on 31 March 2001 are called \u201cshoulder\u201d events\nin Table 1, one of which is discussed above relative to Fig. 18.\nThe observations were made near the outer separatrix, pole-\nward of the cusp. Shoulders occur under strongly driven con-\nditions, when the magnetic field poleward of the cusp is in-\ncreased by currents flowing in the Region 1 solenoid. (Sis-\ncoe et al., 2002). These currents close across the polar cap\nand over the high-latitude magnetosphere. The fringing field\nof this solenoid depresses the magnetic field in the subso-\nlar region, creating effective magnetic shoulders above the\ncusp. Other implications of these shoulders are presented in\nMaynard et al. (2003b). Certain dipole tilt angles accentuate\nthese shoulders and, based on the results displayed in Fig. 19,\ncould move the merging site away from the equator.\nThe ISM and observational results suggest that merging at\nhigh latitudes is a common occurrence. Figure 2 illustrates\nhigh-latitude merging in simulations with a clock angle of\n135\u25e6. Component merging exists in that same simulation\nnear the equatorial magnetopause. It was aided by explic-\nitly included equatorial resistivity in the simulation. Over the\npast two decades, component merging was assumed by many\nto be the rule, rather than the exception. A recent study by\nMoore et al. (2002) concluded that merging rates should be\nappreciable near the subsolar magnetopause for most IMF\nclock angles. To explain DMSP particle characteristics in\nthe cusp, Wing and Newell (2001) argued that both subsolar\nand high-latitude sources simultaneously coexist. Two high-\nlatitude sources may also work. The results of Maynard et\nal. (2001b) require high-latitude sources in both hemispheres\nto reconcile the timing differences. Further work is needed to\nestablish how the location of merging varies with IMF input.\n6.3 Temporal characteristics\nTo date, the 12 March event is unique in that measure-\nments from three separate locations were integrated to ad-\ndress the temporal aspects of the merging event. Whenever\nthe merging rate increases, we expect that the magnetopause\nerodes inward slightly. This apparently was true at 11:39\nand 11:48 UT, when Polar observed the effects of merging at\nnorthern high latitudes. The temporal nature of the process\nis further confirmed by the SuperDARN observations. Using\nFig. 2 to understand the global context, we are able to cor-\nrelate the velocity enhancements observed by SuperDARN\nnear 13:00\u201315:00 MLT with the changes observed by Polar.\nThese correlations continued in observations above the cusp\nby Cluster. We infer that SuperDARN observations primar-\nily reflect temporal dependence of merging. Between 11:00\nand 12:15 UT, multiple peaks in ion velocities observed by\nSuperDARN suggest that the merging rate and\/or location\nvaries on time scales of 2 min, to 8\u201310 min, commonly asso-\nciated with flux-transfer and pulsed-reconnection events (e.g.\nCowley and Lockwood, 1992). Maynard et al. (2001b) re-\nported observations of temporal effects of merging processes\non time scales of 1 to 3 minute. The remote observations of\n12 March show effects in both exhaust regions, with merging\nvarying on similar short temporal scales.\n7 Summary and conclusions\nThe location and temporal dependencies of dayside merging\nhave been investigated from a global perspective. Measure-\nments made in diverse regions of near-Earth space constrain\ninterpretations through demands for consistency between ob-\nserved phenomena. Data acquired on 12 March 2001 near the\nsubsolar magnetopause, in the high-altitude cusp, and in the\nionosphere, indicate that merging occurred at high latitudes\nin a time-varying manner. We have used simultaneous de-\ntection of field-aligned wave Poynting flux and accelerated\nions as the primary, remote discriminators of merging. For a\nperiod of time with the IMF clock angle at \u223c 140\u25e6 merging\ndeveloped to the north of Polar, well removed from predicted\nlocations of component-merging lines (Gonzalez and Mozer,\n1974).\nFor more than an hour SuperDARN observed enhance-\nments in ionospheric plasma flows near 14:00 MLT, asso-\nciated with the time-dependent merging observed by Po-\nlar. A comparison of observations with MHD simulations\nof ISM confirms the existence of a high-latitude merging site\nand suggests that SuperDARN and Polar observed effects at-\ntributable to both exhaust regions of a temporally varying X-\nline. This interpretation is further confirmed with enhance-\nments observed by the Cluster satellites.\nFrom these and other observed results during listed mag-\nnetopause encounters, we conclude that merging occurs pref-\nerentially at high latitudes, especially when the IMF clock\nangle is < 150\u25e6. While inferred high-latitude merging sites\nfavor the antiparallel merging hypothesis, our data alone can-\nnot exclude the possibility of a guide field. Merging can\nmove away the equator even when the IMF has a strong\nsouthward component. ISM simulations suggest that this ef-\nfect is due to tilting of the dipole axis away from the Sun.\nWe also found that IMF BX affects merging rates by en-\nhancing\/diminishing the effective dipole tilt angle. Obser-\nvations show that high-latitude merging rates can vary tem-\nporally with periods of 1\u20133 min. These variations appear to\nbe directly driven by variations in the interplanetary electric\nfield (Maynard et al., 2001b), or may arise from unstable pro-\ncesses within the magnetosheath\/magnetosphere interface.\nAcknowledgements.
