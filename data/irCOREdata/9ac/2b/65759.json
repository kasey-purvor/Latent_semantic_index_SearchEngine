The study in question \nwas part of an evaluation of the Lab in a Lorry project, and involved 932 pupils \ncompleting a pre-measure questionnaire containing items looking at six separate attitude \nconstructs.  From this data, two main patterns emerged; pupils\u201f attitudes towards science \ndeclined as they progressed through secondary school, and this decline was more \npronounced for female pupils.  These conclusions are largely in agreement with previous \nstudies in this field.  However, in examining separate attitude constructs, we were also \nable to identify that the sharpest decline occurred specifically for pupils\u201f attitude towards \nlearning science in school.  Furthermore, using linear regression, we identified that as \npupils progress through school, this construct becomes a greater influence on attitudes \ntowards future participation in science.  Therefore, we also concluded that learning \nscience in school is a particular area that needs to be concentrated upon, if we are to \nimprove children\u201fs attitudes towards science.  In the final part of the paper, we drew on \ninterview data obtained from 44 pupils involved in the Lab in a Lorry study.  Pupils\u201f \ncomments in these interviews provided further insight into why pupils are \u201eswitched off\u201f \nby school science. We drew out the most prevalent themes that emerged in the \ninterviews, in order to provide further insight into why pupils do not enjoy science in \nschool. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nAttitudes towards science and science teaching are issues with long standing attention \nand interest in science education research. A concern for many countries is the falling \nnumbers of students choosing to pursue the study of science, alongside the increasing \nrecognition of the importance and economic utility of scientific knowledge. In the \nparticular case of England and Wales, we have experienced a 41% fall in numbers going \non to study Advanced level physics between 1985 and 2006 (AQA, 2006). This has \ncaused concern for the future supply of qualified persons for UK industry and specialist \nphysics teachers for schools and colleges. The situation calls for researchers to engage \nwith the problem, in order to understand its underlying mechanisms and to find ways to \nimprove it. \n \n 2 \nThe current paper offers a study of attitude development during the first years of \nsecondary schooling in England (Years 7 to 9)\n1\n. These are crucial years when adolescents \nform interests and attitudes affecting choices for further education. In order to focus on \nattitude development, we examine the \u201emagnitude\u201f of attitude measures and compare \nthem across year groups using the same scales. The study has also made an effort to be \nprecise about the concept of attitudes, which has been much discussed in science \neducation research literature (Bennett, 2001; Francis and Greer, 1999; Gardner, 1996; \nGerman, 1988; Osborne et al. 2003; Reid, 2006). In a previous paper (Kind et al., 2007), \nwe presented a validation of attitude measures based on six different constructs, \ndeveloped to evaluate the impact of the \u201eLab in a Lorry\u201f initiative developed by the \nInstitute of Physics and the Schlumberger Foundation. In the present paper, we will \npresent findings from the main study of this evaluation using these same measures. The \nissue we examine here is not how Lab in a Lorry affected students\u201f attitudes but how \nattitudes change among males and females during the lower secondary years. In \nparticular, the main research questions that we seek to address in the present study are: \n \n How do attitudes toward science vary as students progress through the lower \nsecondary years in English schools? \n How do attitudes towards science vary with gender in these schools? \n What factors impact on these students\u201f attitudes towards science? \n \nIn addition, drawing on our findings from the attitude measures, we wish to put forward \nsuggestions for improvements in secondary school science, in order to try to bring about \nmore positive attitudes. To provide further evidence to support this discussion, we will \nalso draw briefly on findings from interviews carried out with pupils involved in the Lab \nin a Lorry project. Comments made by pupils referred to their general experience of \nlearning science. Alongside the quantitative attitude measures therefore, we will use this \nqualitative data to gain insight into problems affecting pupils\u201f attitudes towards science. \n \nTheoretical framework and literature review \n \nDefining attitudes \nAttitude can be defined as the feelings that a person has about an object, based on his or \nher knowledge and belief about that object (Kind et al., 2007). This definition is made \nbased on the model that attitudes include the three components of cognition, affect and \nbehaviour (Rajecki, 1990; Bagozzi and Burnkrant, 1979; McGuire, 1985). A person has \nknowledge and beliefs about objects which give rise to feelings about them, and these \ntwo components together may lead the person to take certain actions. The \u201eobjects\u201f can \nbe of any nature and type, and are in this paper restricted to various aspects of \nexperiencing science. It is important to note that attitudes differ from general affects, i.e. \nmoods and emotions. Even if these factors interact with attitudes (Wilson, Lindset and \nSchooler, 2000), attitudes themselves are best thought of as evaluative judgement formed \nby the person (Ajzen, 2001; Crano and Prislin, 2006). \n  \n                                                 \n1\n These are the first three years of secondary schooling in England, with pupils aged from 11 to 14. \n 3 \nAttitude research in science education has focused on a range of aspects (Osborne et al., \n2003). A useful distinction is often made between \u201cattitude towards science\u201d and \n\u201cscientific attitudes\u201d (Gardner, 1975). The latter involves important attitudes or mindsets \nfor working and thinking in a scientific way, and is not considered in the present paper. \nThe former is often treated as one concept, but includes many dimensions depending on \ndifferent meanings of \u201cscience\u201d and in which contexts these occur. For example, attitudes \nmay be very different towards school science and real science. Such differences indicate \nthat attitude measures should be very explicit about what aspects, or attitude objects, they \nmeasure. However, Munby (1982, 1997) and Gardner (1995, 1996) have identified this as \na weakness in research on attitudes towards science, and have called for better statistical \nvalidation of the attitude constructs. Kind et al. (2007) attempted to meet this critique by \ndeveloping a set of attitude constructs that satisfied basic psychometric criteria for \nmeasurements in social research. The study in question developed measures for the \nfollowing attitude constructs: \n \n Learning science in school,  \n Practical work in science,  \n Science outside of school,  \n Importance of science,  \n Self-concept in science,  \n Future participation in science.  \n \nFindings in attitude research \nFindings in attitudes towards science research are difficult to compare across studies, due \nto the lack of standardised definitions and measurement instruments. Although there are \ncommonly used instruments such as the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) \nquestionnaire (Fraser, 1981), problems can be identified with different instruments (Kind \net al., 2007), and we also have the difficulty that different instrument try and measure \ndifferent aspects of attitudes towards science. The research may be analogous to the fable \nabout the blind men and the elephant: the picture looks distorted because researchers \ntouch different parts of the phenomenon and nobody holds a view of the whole. To try \nand take a more broader view, Table 1 summarises some relevant findings from some of \nthe studies that we have examined. The findings are grouped into two main categories: \ngenerally on attitude development and more specifically on gender differences. We have \nnot made any attempt to specify how or what aspects of attitudes have been measured, as \nthis information would have made the table too complicated to read. Two contexts, \nhowever, are taken into consideration; the country where the research was conducted and \nwhat age level (primary or secondary) the research focused on.  \n \n[Insert Table 1 about here] \n \nTwo patterns stand out as possible conclusions from the research. The first is the steady \ndecline in students\u201f attitude towards science over time. This decline is particularly \nemphasised for pupils in secondary schooling. The second finding is the differences \nbetween boys and girls, with boys generally being more positive and with a less negative \ntrend in their development of attitudes. Both conclusions, however, have to be carefully \n 4 \nexamined. First of all, studies have found that it is in fact attitudes towards school science \nthat decline, while attitudes towards real science and the usefulness of science remain \nmuch more stable (Schibeci, 1984; Osborne et al., 2003). Secondly, it is often very \ndifficult to ascertain from studies whether attitudes towards science differ from other \nschool subjects. Some studies which have investigated this directly have found attitudes \nrelatively similar among different subjects (Hendley, Stables and Stables, 1996) while \nothers report a more rapid decline in science than other subjects (Choppin, 1974). \nThirdly, it is also very difficult to tell how negative or positive students are in the various \nstudies. This problem goes back to the measurement problems mentioned earlier, but it \nalso seems that studies are more likely to report negative results. As Osborne et al. (2003) \nask, should 3.26 on a five-step Likert scale be weighted positively or negatively? \n \nFinally, the attitude research shows contradictory results, as both main trends identified in \nTable 1 are challenged by some of the studies included in the table. This may be due to \nthe nature of the attitudes themselves (the studies simply have measured different \nattitudes), the validity of the research instruments (the same attitudes have been \nmeasured, but some instruments have poor validity), or the contexts in which attitudes \nhave been measured (attitudes may develop differently in different contexts). The studies \nreported in Table 1 are, with one exception, taken from the US and UK. This is done on \npurpose as the picture would have been much more complicated in a wider international \nscale. Studies in Papua New Guinea (Maddock, 1982, 1983), for example, report a \npositive trend in students\u201f attitudes toward learning science. However, this result has little \nmeaning without a more in-depth study of the culture in which the study is set. A further \ndemonstration of this is found in the international study TIMSS (Martin et al., 2004), in \nwhich it was found that the four countries with the lowest percentages of students with \nhigh self-confidence in science \u2013 Chinese Taipei, Hong SAR, Japan and Korea - are the \ncountries with the highest science achievement scores. Asking these Asian students about \nhow well they think they do in science is obviously very different from asking the \ncorresponding European students. Asking students how well they like school science \nsimilarly reveals a clear pattern that students in developing countries are most positive, \nWestern developed countries form a mid-group and the top achieving Asian countries \nhave the least positive students (Martin et al., 2004). There are exceptions to this, but \nboth the exceptions and the general pattern illustrate the danger of making simple \nconclusions on students\u201f attitudes. However, an interesting perspective that has come out \nof the international comparisons is found in Schreiner and Sj\u00f8berg (2006). They focus on \nstudents\u201f \u201eidentity construction\u201f, which they claim plays a much stronger role in the way \nyoung people relate to science in the Western societies today than earlier. Young people \ntoday are less focused on \u201ewhat do you want to be\u201f and more oriented towards \u201ewho do \nyou want to be\u201f (Schreiner and Sj\u00f8berg, 2006). This informs us that attitude research \nresults not only are difficult to transfer from one society to another but also from one time \nperiod to another. Students\u201f attitudes must be regarded as a characteristic of the context \nin which it has been conducted. Attitude research for this reason will be an ongoing issue, \nwhere researchers will have to explore students\u201f attitudes towards science in the current \nsocial and educational situation. \n \n \n 5 \nData Collection \u2013 attitude measures used \n \nThe data presented in this paper was collected as part of an evaluation of the Lab in a \nLorry project, carried out on behalf of the Institute of Physics. Lab in a Lorry is an \ninitiative involving the visit of a mobile laboratory to schools, designed to encourage the \nparticipation of pupils aged 11 to 14 in science\n2\n. As part of the evaluation, pupils\u201f \nattitudes towards science were measured before the visit of Lab in a Lorry to their \nschools.  For this purpose, a questionnaire was developed incorporating measures for the \nfollowing areas of pupils\u201f attitudes towards science: Learning science in school, Practical \nwork in science, Science outside of school, Importance of science, Self-concept in \nscience, and Future participation in science.  \n \nFollowing an initial trialling of this questionnaire, it was distributed to five different \nschools (three located in the North East of England, one in the South East of England and \none in the South West) who were being visited by Lab in a Lorry. Pupils from Years 7, 8 \nand 9 from these schools were asked to complete the questionnaire two weeks before the \nvisit of Lab in a Lorry. In total, 932 pupils completed the questionnaire. Analysing the  \nobtained data, we confirmed through factor analysis that each of the attitude constructs \nbeing measured were unidimensional, i.e. one factor was extracted from each measure. \nThe internal reliability of each measure was also found to be greater than the threshold \nlevel of Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.7. Details of this data analysis examining the unidimensionality \nand reliability of these attitude measures are provided in on our previous paper (Kind et \nal., 2007). However, Table 2 below provides a summary of the items comprising each \nattitude measure and the Cronbach \u03b1 values obtained from the data. The previous data \nanalysis also found that the Learning science in school, Science outside of school and \nFuture participation in science measures were all highly correlated with each other (\u03c1  \n0.6). Factor analysis confirmed that items from these three measures also loaded on one \nsingle factor. Therefore, these measures could be brought together to provide a Combined \ninterest in science measure.  Table 2 also provides the Cronbach \u03b1 values for this \ncombined measure. \n \n[Insert Table 2 about here] \n \nIn this paper, we draw on the data obtained from the questionnaire, in order to examine \nhow the different attitude measures vary over the school years and between boys and \ngirls. In addition to the questionnaires, following the visit of Lab in a Lorry, 44 pupils in \nthe five schools were interviewed about their views on Lab in a Lorry and science \ngenerally.  We will draw on some of the comments made by pupils, in order to provide \nsome further insight into some of the issues that emerge from the analysis of the \nquestionnaire data.  \n \n \nData analysis \u2013 average measures \n \n                                                 \n2\n Further information of Lab in a Lorry can be obtained from the website www.labinalorry.org.uk \n 6 \nDrawing on the data obtained from the questionnaire, we first of all examined how the \nattitude towards science measures varied across the different school years involved in the \nstudy.  Figure 1 shows the average Combined interest in science measure for the Years 7, \n8 and 9 pupils. \n \n[Insert Figure 1 about here] \n \nThis sample of pupils was made up of 272 Year 7 pupils, 432 Year 8 pupils and 228 Year \n9 pupils. In finding the average value for a particular attitude measure, the responses \ngiven by pupils to the questionnaire items were coded numerically (5 = Strongly agree, 4 \n= Agree, 3 = Neither agree or disagree, 2 = Disagree and 1 = Strongly disagree; these \nwere reversed for negatively worded items). The average value of a measure for each \npupil was found by averaging over the relevant items comprising this measure.  The \naverage measure for a particular group of pupils was then found by further averaging \nthese pupil average values over the group. Therefore, the values for any of the attitudes \ntowards science measures for any particular group could vary between 1 (most negative) \nand 5 (most positive). \n \nAs can be seen in Figure 1, we observe a steady decline in the average values of the \nCombined interest in science measure as pupils progress through secondary school.  This \nis in agreement with one of the main findings that we drew out from the literature \nsummarised in Table 1. Another indication of the extent of this decline can be obtained \nby looking at the effect size for the difference in the average values between the Year 7 \npupils and the Year 9 pupils.  For the Combined interest in science measure, this is \ncalculated to be -0.89 standard deviations (the minus indicating a decline in the average \nmeasure), a large effect size\n3\n.   \n \nRather than just examining the variation in this Combined interest in science measure, we \ncan look in more detail at the changing attitudes of pupils towards science by looking at \neach of the separate attitude constructs.  Figure 2 below show the variation of each of the \nattitude towards science measures over the school years. \n \n[Insert Figure 2 about here] \n \nOnce again, we can also get an idea of the change in the attitude measures by calculating \nthe effect sizes for the differences between the Year 7 and Year 9 pupils (Table 3). The \nadvantage of examining the individual attitude constructs in this way is that we can see \nthe areas that experience the biggest decline as pupils progress through secondary school.  \nWhat we see in this case is that the largest decline in pupil attitudes was for their attitude \ntowards learning science in school.  In contrast, pupils\u201f attitudes towards practical work \nand also the importance of science only experienced small reductions as pupils \nprogressed from Year 7 to Year 9. \n                                                 \n3\n Cohen (1969) categorises effect sizes of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 standard deviations as \u201esmall\u201f, \u201emedium\u201f and \n\u201elarge\u201f. \n 7 \n \n[Insert Table 3 around here] \n \nIn addition to looking at the variation of the attitude measures over the different school \nyears, we can also examine the differences between boys and girls. Figure 3 below shows \nthe average measure for the Combined interest in science measure, separated for boys and \ngirls as well as for the different school years. \n \n[Insert Figure 3 around here] \n     \nIt is interesting to note that in the first year of secondary schooling, there is very little \ndifference between boys and girls with regards to this Combined interest in science \nmeasure.  However, as we move up through the year groups, the differences between \nboys and girls increase.  Looking at the effect sizes for the difference between Year 7 and \nYear 9 pupils, for the girls, the effect size for the Combined interest in science measure \nwas -1.09, whereas for the boys it was -0.50.  Once again, we can gain more detail by \nlooking at the individual attitudes towards science measures.  Figure 4 and Figure 5 \nbelow show the variation of the average measures over school years, plotted separately \nfor boys and girls. \n \n[Insert Figure 4 around here] \n[Insert Figure 5 around here] \n \nIt is interesting to note once again that differences between boys and girls for any of the \nattitudes towards science measures are small for Year 7 pupils, only becoming \npronounced later on.  To give an idea of the different variations in attitudes for boys and \ngirls as they progress through school, the effect sizes for the differences in the measures \nare presented separately in Table 4. \n \n[Insert Table 4 around here] \n \nThere are a number of issues to note from this table. First of all, for all the attitudes to \nscience measures, girls\u201f attitudes decline more than boys\u201f attitudes as we move from \nYear 7 to Year 9.  This seems to support our second assertion which we drew from the \nliterature in Table 1. Secondly, it is interesting to note the measures for which we see a \nlarge difference between the effect size values for boys and girls.  In science outside of \nschool, whereas the effect size is very large for girls at over one standard deviation, for \nboys, the effect size is quite small at around -0.3.  For practical work in science, there \nwas a medium-sized fall for girls with an effect size of around -0.4, whereas there was \nactually a small increase for boys.  In Learning science in school, both boys and girls \nshowed large declines in their attitude towards this construct, although this was more \npronounced for girls with a fall of around -1.4 standard deviations.   \n \n \nData analysis \u2013 What affects future participation in science? \n \n 8 \nIn addition to looking at the variation of the different constructs over school years and \nbetween boys and girls, we can also examine the relationships between the constructs \nthemselves.  More specifically, we can examine a specific outcome, in this case the \nmeasure for pupils\u201f future participation in science, and see how the other constructs affect \nthis outcome.  By identifying these relationships, we can also identify possible ways of \nimproving pupils\u201f future participation in science. \n \nIn order to examine the relationship between the Future participation in science measure \nand the other constructs, stepwise linear regression analysis was carried out.  Table 5 \nbelow shows the standardised regression coefficients for the five attitude constructs in \ntheir relationship with the Future participation measure.  No regression coefficients are \npresented for those constructs that were excluded from the regression equation as a result \nof the stepwise analysis. \n \n[Insert Table 5 around here] \n \nAs can be seen, the construct that correlates most highly with the Future participation in \nscience measure was the Science outside of school construct. However, a more \ninteresting set of findings is found if we carry out the linear regression analysis for the \nthree school years separately.  Table 6 below shows the results of this analysis. \n \n[Insert Table 6 around here] \n \nAlthough for each year group the Science outside of school construct is most highly \ncorrelated with the Future participation in science measure, there seems to be a pattern in \nthe way that the correlation coefficients vary.  As pupils progress through their schooling, \nthe Science outside of school measure becomes a less important factor, and Learning \nscience in school becomes more important.  This result seems reasonable in that as pupils \nprogress through school, their experience of science is more and more what they have \nexperienced in school.  Therefore, we would expect that their attitude to school science to \nbecome a more important factor in whether they would participate in science in the \nfuture.  It therefore becomes more important that, if we want to encourage pupils to \ncontinue with science, they should be enjoying the experience that they are having in the \nclassroom.  \n \n \nQualitative data \u2013 results of interviews with pupils \n \nIn addition to the quantitative data obtained from pupils in the questionnaire, semi-\nstructured interviews were carried out with groups of pupils from six schools involved in \nthe Lab in a Lorry study. Researchers visited the schools for these interviews \napproximately two weeks after the visit of Lab in a Lorry to the school. Each school \narranged for convenient groups of pupils who had experienced Lab in a Lorry to be \ninterviewed. The sample was therefore neither representative nor random, rather, the \ninterviews allowed the researchers to simply explore issues regarding Lab in a Lorry in \nmore detail. \n 9 \n \nAltogether, 44 pupils of varying academic ability from Years 7 to 9 were interviewed, \nseparated into 16 groups.  In each case, the interview with pupils was recorded at the time \nand transcribed later. Pupils were asked questions about their experiences of Lab in a \nLorry, what they thought the best and worst things were and what they thought of school \nscience in general.  \n \nA number of the pupils\u201f comments in response to these questions gave some insight into \nwhy pupils are \u201eswitched off\u201f by school science. Analysis of the obtained interview data \ndrew out the following most prevalent themes as reasons why pupils do not enjoy science \nin school. \n \n(a) School science is not perceived as practical \nThe pupils commented almost unanimously that they enjoyed Lab in a Lorry because of \nthe hands-on\/practical nature of the experiments and the fact that everyone could take \npart. The least popular experiments were ones with the least practical element.  \n \n\u201c[Lab in a Lorry is] fun and it\u2019s what all children want to learn, because it\u2019s \npractical.\u201d \n \n\u201cLab in a Lorry was really, really great.  I like science when you do \npracticals rather than when you\u2019re just writing stuff.\u201d \n \n\u201cI thought the light (experiment) was the weakest one as well, because there \nwas less practical\u201d \n \nA large proportion of the pupils went on to say that they found school science \u201cboring\u201d \nbecause they rarely did any practical experiments, the element that made school science \nfun for them. \n \n\u201cI like doing experiments but I\u2019m not really enjoying science [in school] that \nmuch at the minute because it\u2019s board work and I prefer hands-on.\u201d \n \n\u201c[Science in school is] alright, it depends what subject you are doing and \nwhether there is any practical involved.\u201d  \n \n \n (b) School science is not perceived as being well explained \nWhether the pupils enjoyed a particular experiment or not seemed to depend heavily on \nwhether they could understand what was being said and whether or not they thought it \nhad been well explained. \n \n[What was the best bit about Lab in a Lorry?] \u201cThey explained it really well \nuntil you understood it\u201d \n \n 10 \n[What was the worst bit about Lab in a Lorry?] \u201cThe sunlight one because \nthere was more going on and you couldn\u2019t understand it.  The other two were \neasier to understand, because the people put themselves in our shoes and \ntalked to us as if we were their friends and they were not like teachers.\u201d \n \nOn the whole, the pupils were very complimentary about the way that volunteers who \nworking on the Lorry talked to them, saying that they explained things well and that they \nchecked whether they had understood what had been said. (Any negative comments \nabout volunteer explanations seemed to be directed at one particular experiment, which \nseemed a difficult experiment to understand). The pupils indicated that this was in \ncontrast to their experience of school science, which was perceived as not being well \nexplained. \n \n\u201cThey explained things more than the science teacher would and helped our \nunderstanding.\u201d  \n \n\u201cThey were different from our normal teachers.  They were younger and they \nexplained things in our language.\u201d \n \n \n(c) School science is not perceived as relevant \nA common finding was that pupils had not made links between school science and \neveryday life. A number of pupils said that Lab in a Lorry made them more interested in \nscience because it made them realise that science was important for \u201ceveryday life\u201d, \nindicating that a more relevant curriculum may spark more interest. \n \n[Did Lab in the Lorry make you more interested in science?] \u201cYes, because it \nmade me realise that science is in everyday life\u201d \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be so exciting and I didn\u2019t know that most everyday \nthings had something to do with science.\u201d \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe present study has highlighted a variety of issues concerning secondary students\u201f \nattitudes towards science.  First of all, looking at the variation of the average measures \nover the different school years, we have observed a steady decline in attitudes towards \nscience as pupils progress through school.  This finding has also been highlighted by \nmany other studies, including Yager and Yager (1985), Doherty and Dawe (1985), \nGeorge (2000 and 2006), and in the review paper by Osborne et al. (2003).  In addition, \nthe study has highlighted that this decline in attitudes towards science is more \npronounced for female pupils. This was in agreement with the previous studies carried \nout in England (Hadden and Johnstone, 1983, Doherty and Dawe, 1985,), but the more \nrecent work carried out in the United States by George (2006) has found that the opposite \nto be true, that male pupils\u201f attitudes decline faster.   \n 11 \n \nOne of the particular advantages of the present study is that we have defined different \naspects of attitudes towards science, and measured these constructs separately with \nreliable, unidimensional measures.   Previous attitude research has been criticised for its \nlack of clarity in defining what we mean by this particular term, and therefore where the \nspecific problems lie with regards to attitudes towards science. Using the separate \nmeasures to look more carefully at secondary students\u201f attitudes, we have highlighted \nthat a particular problem exists with how pupils experience science in school.  Not only is \nthis the area within learning science in which we see the steepest decline in attitudes from \nthe start of secondary schooling, but we have also seen that this seems to be a more and \nmore important influence on whether pupils will pursue science in the future.  Therefore, \nthe main recommendation that we put forward from this study is the need to concentrate \non improving pupils\u201f experience of science in school. \n \nThe qualitative data that we gathered from the interviews with a small sample of pupils \nprovides some insight into areas that could be examined in improving this experience of \nscience in school.   These were the practical content of science lessons, the way science is \ntaught and explained and the way science is made relevant in lessons.  Of course, these \nare areas which have already been raised in previous studies. With regards to the \nrelevancy of what is being taught, Ramsden (1990) identified the relevance and perceived \nusefulness of a taught unit in physics as contributing to its success. Likewise, Stokking \n(2000) identified the perceived relevance of physics for future study or profession as \nbeing strongly related to the choice of physics in higher education. Osborne et al. (2003) \nagain identified the issue of relevancy and the fact that biology was more likely to be \nperceived as being relevant for pupils than the physical sciences. Jones and Kirk (1990) \nidentified that if application of physics is relevant to people generally (e.g. health \napplications), this influences pupils\u201f interest in the application.  Reid and Skryabina \n(2002) found that pupils in Scotland had a more positive view of physics whilst \nundertaking the \u201eapplications-led\u201f Standard Grade course than when taking the more \ntheoretical Higher Grade course.   Therefore, incorporating subject matter that pupils can \nmore easily identify with may therefore be one way of tackling the way that the subject is \nperceived. \n \nWith regards to practical content, Reid and Skryabina (2003), in their survey of Scottish \npupils, found that both male and female pupils on the Scottish Higher physics course \nindicated that they preferred activities such as explaining natural phenomena and doing \npractical work.  With regards to female pupils particularly, Stewart (1998) found that \nfemale students at A-level highlighted medical applications, development of oral skills \nand development of practical skills as features that they would like to see more of in their \nphysics course. Male students preferred more IT and technological applications.  On the \nother hand, looking at how science material is taught, Osborne et al. (2003) argued that \nfor science subjects generally, \u201cresearch evidence shows clearly that it is the teacher \nvariables that are the most significant factor determining attitude, not curriculum \nvariables\u201d (p. 1070).  Nielsen and Thomsen (1988) and Woolnough (1994) have also \nhighlighted the importance of the teacher in enthusing pupils in science.  Therefore, all \nthese factors, relevancy, practical content and the role of the teacher, need to be examined \n 12 \nin order to tackle the perceived decline in pupils\u201f attitudes towards science that we have \nhighlighted in this paper. \n \nFinally, with regards to future research in this area, it also seems important that we look \nmore closely at the combined effects of variables. In most studies, factors involved are \nstudied in isolation without taking into consideration the highly complex situation that \noccurs when they interacts. Our own study, for example, indicates that learning in science \nin school and students\u201f self-concept in science both develop with very similar trends with \nregards to their interaction with future participation in science. To explore such \ninteractions, our research may benefit from more advanced modelling analyses (e.g. \nstructural equation modelling).   This is a direction which we will explore in the future. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAQA. (2006). The number of entries to A-level examinations in sciences and mathematics \n1985-2006.
