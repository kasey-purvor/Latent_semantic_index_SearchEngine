Using data and \u00ae ndings from a range of studies, it describes dominant patterns of\nresponse, and posits reasons for boys\u2019 frequent rejection and disruption of lessons. The relationship\nbetween bodily size and social capital and hierarchies of masculine sexual power and status is\naddressed. Evidence is presented which demonstrates that bravado and disruption are reactions to sex\neducation which fails to address boys\u2019 needs. We need to create learning environments in which they\ncan at least temporarily put to one side the need to behave in rigid sex-stereotypical ways.\nIntroduction\nA few weeks ago I visited a secondary school to talk with teachers about the sex\neducation provision. One teacher was evaluating the programme through a\ndiscussion with Year 9 students; young people aged 13 and 14 years old. There was\na lot of discussion about whether the teachers should teach about homosexuality. All\nthe girls seemed keen; a small group of boys was very hostile. After the lesson, the\nteacher said he thought the evaluation was useful but he felt frustrated that the girls\nseemed to get so much more out of the exercise and the whole programme of sex\neducation than the boys. He spoke about the small group of boys who had been so\nvocal in the discussion about homosexuality. These boys, he said, got nothing out\nof the sex education. They could not engage with it. They were just immature. I\nasked what the girls thought of them. He said they liked them, for being funny and\nchallenging, and some went out with them for short periods, but they thought they\nwere immature too. He pointed to some work the girls had done in a single-sex\ngroup. I copied out the words from the sheets pinned to the wall:\nWhy boys lie about sex \u00bc\nTo impress their partner\nInsecure about their ability\nTo hide the fact that they are gay\nBecause they think all their friends have had sex\nCorrespondence to: Simon Forrest, Department of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, University\nCollege London, 3rd Floor Mortimer Market Centre, off Capper Street, London WE1C 6AU.\nEmail: sforrest@gum.ucl.ac.uk\nISSN 1468-1994 print\/ISSN 1468-1749 online\/00\/030247-15\n\u00d3 British Association for Sexual and Relationship Therapy\n248 Simon Forrest\nTo make girls want to have sex with them\u00d0 it makes them look experienced\nTo feel grown up\nTo impress their friends\nBecause their girlfriend has had sex\nOn the sheet underneath in a box was added the following:\nlook hard\nfeel they need to lose their virginity\nso they\u2019 re not called name e.g. frigid\/bent\nmake them seem mature\nmake them look experienced \u00d0 or their partner has had sex, they don\u2019 t want to\nlook stupid in front of them\ngirls may want sex with them because they think it will be good because the boy\nis experienced\nSchool sex education often seems to exacerbate tensions between girls and boys\ncentred around gender stereotypical attitudes towards the values and meaning\nattached to sexual behaviours and relationships. Work like that of the girls presented\nabove is highly likely to antagonize boys regardless of whether it accurately re\u00af ects\nwhat they say or believe. Consequently, discussions can collapse into arguments in\nwhich girls and boys line up against each other. Sometimes there is a mutual\ndenigration of the other sex; a tit-for-tat exchange of insults and accusations about\nmasculinity and men on the one hand and femininity and women on the other. Girls\nwill call boys immature; boys will accuse girls of trying to annoy them.\nThe principal aim of this paper is explore how boys respond to school-based sex\neducation in England [1], and identify how the framework for that provision, its\nstructure and content may be collusive with gender stereotyping. In addition, it sets\nout to explore how boys\u2019 learning and experience of sex contributes to their\ndeveloping sexual identity and beliefs about sexuality and gender. The paper\nconcludes with some suggestions for sexual relationship counsellors and therapists\nabout how to consider these effects in their work with boys and men.\nThe behaviour of boys in school is often perceived as problematic. With regard\nto secondary school sex education, there are good accounts of their disruptive\nbehaviour, for example the study of sex education in single-sex groups within an\nEnglish co-educational school reported by Lynda Measor et al. (1996). Here, the\nauthors describe the sense of panic, chaos, the horse-play and undercurrent of\ndenigrating joking and bullying violence among boys who are being shown\ncontraceptives by a female nurse. Clearly, this behaviour makes it an unsafe\nenvironment in which to talk about sex seriously. Elsewhere, teachers and trainers\nhave reported their reluctance to engage with boys for fear of encountering this\nbehaviour and their confusion about how to challenge it ( Salisbury & Jackson,\n1996). This has also been the experience of professionals in the rest of the European\nUnion (Forrest & Vermeer, 1997). The overbearing heterosexual machismo which\nMeasor et al. describe also militates against addressing the needs of young gay men\nand young lesbians. Descriptions of the frustration and pain of young people in these\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 249\nhidden minorities is to be found in the accounts of researchers like Marigold Rogers\n(1994) and Jo Frankum (1996). Rogers describes the triple de\u00ae cit of young lesbians:\nbeing young, female and gay. Frankum describes the anxiety felt by gay young men\ndenied any information about same-sex relationships and safer sex. The effect of\ndenying the existence of gay young people is likely to contribute to heterosexist\nprejudices and the victimization of young gay people (Rivers, 1995; 1996), and to\ndamage to their self-esteem which can ultimately be linked to self-harm and suicide\n(Remafedi, 1991).\nThis would be suf\u00ae cient reason to explore the questions boys\u2019 reactions to\nschool-based sex education raise. However, in addition, public policy development\nin England and Wales brings a new focus on sex education, with a renewed drive to\nreduce the number of unplanned conceptions among teenage girls (Social Exclusion\nUnit, 1999) and a proposed revision of governmental guidance to schools in the light\nof the lowering of the age of sexual consent for gay men and the repeal of a statute\n(Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act) forbidding local government, which\ncontrols the majority of schools, from promoting homosexual lifestyles (Department\nof the Environment, 1988) [2]. In addition, schools represent a chief mechanism\nthrough which social values about sex and sexual relationships are expressed to\nyoung people.\nThis paper does not adopt this focus on school experiences with the intention\nof undervaluing the impact of cultural or social norms and representations on sexual\nattitudes and behaviour. Rather, I want to emphasize that maintained schooling\nremains a common experience for the vast majority of young people in the England\nand Wales and is therefore a vector through which we collectively seek to provide for\ntheir nurture and development. In part, this paper sets out to describe this\nsituation\u00d0 both the current guidance and structure of sex education, which it will be\nshown is germane to understanding boys\u2019 reactions to it, and the content which\nbears directly on the performance and development of a multiplicity of\nmasculinities. The scope of the discussion is limited to mid-teenage boys within\nco-educational state-funded schools. The paper does not draw on the \u00ae ndings of any\none empirical study, but on a number of investigations in which I have either been\ninvolved, or which have been undertaken by other researchers. The discursive\nelements of the paper are interwoven with material from these studies and extracts\nfrom literary sources.\nSex education guidance and the structure of provision\nLittle scholarly or concrete had been said about sex education in England and Wales\nprior to Marie-Ann Doggett\u2019s (1987) review of literature in the Appendix to Isobel\nAllen\u2019s book Education in Sex and Personal Relationships (1987). Since then, the work\nof oral historians like Stephen Humphries (1988) has added a great deal in terms of\npowerful, and often moving, accounts of schools days before and after the Second\nWorld War. Michael Reiss (1998a) has described the situation as one in which there\nwas little formal sex education in schools, the main thrust being the prevention of\nconceptions and births outside marriage. He notes a shift post-war towards\n250 Simon Forrest\nabstracted and scienti\u00ae c teaching about reproductive systems of plants and animals\nother than human beings. Reiss goes on to identify a further shift, with a broadening\nof the aims of sex education in the late 1970s and early 1980s, from moral\nreinforcement and reproductive illumination to the development of a repertoire of\nskills like decision making, communicating and negotiating. This, he believes, was\nlargely a product of the in\u00af uence of feminist critiques, which pointed out how\nexisting programmes of sex education reinforced gender inequalities, portraying men\nas active sexual agents and unreliable in terms of their sexual self-control and\nwomen as sexually acted upon and responsible for managing contraception.\nThis situation altered radically in the 1980s with the discovery of HIV. The\neffect, bringing to attention as it did sexual behaviour, lesbian and gay rights and the\nprovision of condoms and other contraceptives to young people, contributed to a\n\u00af urry of political activity and legislation and guidance. Contemporary themes are a\nre-emergence of polarized beliefs that education about sex either corrupts innocent\nchildren and promotes sexual behaviour and experimentation (including exploring\nsame-sex sexual relationships), or that it can positively enhance young people\u2019s\nability to manage their sexual lives for themselves.\nDespite the heat of media and moralistic fury about the allegedly corrupting\nin\u00af uence of sex education, recent research on parents\u2019 attitudes towards\nschool-based provision reports as much support as when Isobel Allen undertook her\npioneering study in 1987. Consistently, between 94% and 96% of parents believe\nschools should provide education about topics in sex and personal relationships\n(Allen, 1987; NFER, 1994). Despite this support and considerable academic\nevidence to show a liberal sex education has positive effects on knowledge, attitudes\nand behaviour (Grunseit & Aggleton, 1998; Kirby et al., 1994), the \u00ae eld remains\ncontroversial and dif\u00ae cult for schools.\nMaintained secondary schools in England and Wales are obliged to provide sex\neducation to all their students. However, beyond a few topics, how provision is\norganized and delivered is very much at the discretion of the school governing body.\nThere is much instruction and guidance to consider, including the National\nCurriculum[3] (revised under the Dearing Review in 1995) and associated\nGuidance on Health Education (NCC, 1990), the Education Acts of 1986, 1993\nand 1996, the framework for school inspection, and the indirect in\u00af uence of the\naforementioned Local Government Act (1988).\nTo summarize, secondary schools are required to provide information, through\nthe National Curriculum for Science, about human sexual reproduction and\ncontraception. It is also anticipated that they will teach about sexually transmitted\ndiseases, including HIV. There is a whole host of additional topics covered in\nGuidance which schools are not obliged but encouraged to teach, including puberty,\nmasturbation, sex and the law, accessing sexual health services, sexuality, resisting\npressure; decision making; communicating; negotiating in relationships; religious\nand cultural diversity in values and views; and self-esteem. It is suggested that these\ntopics are covered in an age-appropriate order and at a level of complexity which\naccords with the needs of the students. Parents at a school have access to the policy\ndocuments describing what is taught by whom and when, and retain a right to\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 251\nwithdraw their children from aspects of sex education not contained within the\nNational Curriculum. Recent research on the state of policy formation has indicated\na high degree of variability in the quality and detail of these policies (Pearson, 1999;\nRegis, 2000).\nThe complexities of the content and organization of sex education bear upon its\nprovision, as do concerns about transgressing the moral precepts laid out in the\nGuidance. Fears about scandals stirred up by the press also operate as an effective\ndeterrent to progression. Sex education outside the core of the National Curriculum\nis vulnerable to erosion by demands to improve academic standards. Both staff and\nyoung people tend to perceive sex education as a non-examinable and hence trivial\ndigression. The lack of specialist initial teacher training reinforces this lowly status.\nDelivery through pastoral tutors, a popular approach, also exposes the provision to\npatchiness and marginality.\nThis brief exploration of policy, structure and organization of sex education is\nhighly relevant to the further consideration of boys\u2019 reactions to the provision. Much\nof the behaviour described and analysed below re\u00af ects the vacuity of the moralism in\npolitical debates about sexuality and young people. Boys\u2019 performances of\nmasculinity seem to show an intuitive grasp of the vulnerability which teachers feel\nin trying to teach them about sex and an ability to twist and invert messages\npresented as ideal social norms into something grotesque and pantomimic.\nThe sexual behaviour of boys and young men\nA censorious social climate militates against investigating the sexual behaviour and\nexperiences of young people who are themselves concerned about disclosing their\nexperiences. Consequently, research on the socio-sexual lives of young people tends\nto be focused on behaviours that relate directly to public health concerns, where\narguments for the bene\u00ae ts from research are regarded as self-evident.\nAmong the 16\u00b1 19 year olds interviewed in the National Survey of Sexual\nAttitudes and Lifestyles (NATSSAL) (Wellings et al., 1994), 19% of young women\nand 30% of young men report their \u00ae rst experience of sexual intercourse occurring\nbefore the age of 16. There were associations between the age of \u00ae rst sexual\nintercourse and both social class and faith. The median ages for \u00ae rst sexual\nintercourse of boys from the highest social class backgrounds was nearly 18 years\nold, and that of boys from the lowest social class backgrounds around 16 years old.\nBoys reporting a religious belief or active adherence to any faith tended to report\nlater \u00ae rst sexual intercourse. About a quarter of black African and Afro-Caribbean\nboys, compared with a \u00ae fth of white and a tenth of Asian boys, reported their \u00ae rst\nsexual intercourse before 16 years old. For boys, their \u00ae rst sexual partners are\ngenerally of the same age, whereas the norm among girls is for older partners. About\n40% of boys and half of the girls reported their \u00ae rst sexual intercourse took place in\nthe context of an established relationship. Among boys, a further 30% reported that\nthey had known their partner for some time, although it was not a steady\nrelationship. This compared with 16% of girls. There are signi\u00ae cant gender\ndifferences when it comes to feelings associated with \u00ae rst intercourse. Eight out of\n252 Simon Forrest\nTABLE I. Main factors associated with \u00ae rst intercourse among\n16\u00b1 24 year olds\nFactor (%)\nBoys Girls\nCuriosity 30.7 In love 37.5\nNatural course 23.1 Curiosity 23.6\nIn love 16.7 Natural course 23.2\nLose virginity 11.2 Carried away 6.3\nPeer group 7.2 Drunk 5.2\nDrunk 6.6 Peer group 4.1\nCarried away 4.5 Lose Virginity 0.2\n10 boys compared with six out of 10 girls felt their \u00ae rst experience of sexual\nintercourse came at the right time and 15% of boys compared with 36% of girls\nregretted their experiences.\nThe NATSSAL study emphaiszed the inadequacy of the dichotomizing\nheterosexual and homosexual identity in mapping sexual behaviour and experiences\nand used a `Kinsey\u2019 scale (Kinsey et al., 1948) to rate experiences of same-sex\nfeelings and sexual experiences. The data collected showed that about 7% of boys\nhad experienced some homosexual attraction, 5% had had some form of\nhomosexual experience and 3% had had some homosexual genital contact between\n16 and 24 years old.\nThe context and meaning of sexual behaviour for boys\nData on the frequency of occurrence of particular sexual behaviours or experiences\nis of fairly limited usefulness outside the context provided by an understanding of\nthe social and personal meanings of the activities. The NATSSAL study, drawing\nupon Scho\u00ae eld\u2019s earlier (1965) work, showed that there were differences for male\nand female teenagers in their main motivations at \u00ae rst sexual intercourse. These are\nreported in Table I below. For both girls and boys, a sense of curiosity, feeling love\nor that to have sexual intercourse was a natural development in their relationship\nwere the highest rating factors. However, only 17% of boys compared with 38% of\ngirls reported being in love as being their main motivation, and 11% of boys\ncompared with fewer than 1% of girls reported losing their virginity as an important\nfactor.\nTaken together, these data suggest that, broadly speaking, boys view sexual\nactivity, especially losing their virginity, as an achievement. Not surprisingly, this\nproduces anxieties about sexual capacity, appetite and performance. This generally\nfocuses on worries about adequacy compared with other boys rather than on\nsatisfying the emotional or physical needs and desires of girls. As Deakin (1988) has\nnoted, this pursuit of `sexual excellence\u2019 by men produces a raft of concerns that can\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 253\nundermine their ability to form intimate emotional bonds. They can end up\npreoccupied with penis size, maintaining an erection, making sexual intercourse last\na long time, and achieving simultaneous orgasm.\nWhile having a sexual career is in itself a positive social attribute for boys, they\nalso build identity through showing off what they are not. A central element in the\nstruggle to build and maintain a good heterosexual reputation with male peers is the\nexpression of violent and physical anti-gay and lesbian feelings (Forrest, 1997). Male\nhomosexuality implies an erosion of the heterosexual male identity and threatens\nmany boys. The direct result is the victimization of other boys who are labelled as\ngay, and those who are gay. The Stonewall survey Queerbashing (Mason & Palmer,\n1996) described the extent of homophobic bullying in school suffered by young\nlesbian and gay people: 90% had been called names; 61% had been harassed; 48%\nhad been violently attacked; and 22% had been `beaten up\u2019 . Of the violent attacks,\n40% had taken place in school, and half of these attacks and 79% of the\nname-calling were by fellow students.\nHeterosexual sex education: the mis\u00ae t between main messages and boys\u2019\nneeds\nThere is a mismatch between the kind of sex education boys\u2019 sexual experiences and\nmotivations imply ought to be provided and that laid out in statutory guidance and\ntaught in schools. Boys identify the censoriousness of sex educators as a major cause\nof this mismatch. Work by the Sex Education Forum (Lenderyou & Ray, 1997) and\nSimon Blake on behalf of the Health Education Authority (1999) reported the\nfollowing criticisms of sex education by boys:\nNormally we are told things that other people think are important;\n(Lenderyou & Ray, 1997: 5)\nIt concentrates too much on women and periods; (HEA, 1999: 1)\nBoys also commented that the content of sex education was mostly negative;\nDon\u2019t do this, or this will happen \u00bc (Lenderyou & Ray, 1997: 5)\nThe perceived focus on pregnancy and women\u2019 s sexual health is not felt to be\nrelevant by many boys. Their main concerns are quite different. Gathering\nanonymous questions from young people via a `suggestion box\u2019 activity is a common\napproach to assessing needs in developing health education interventions. I have\nfrequently observed teachers and health educators asking groups of young people to\nthink of any question they have about sex and relationships, to write it down on a\nscrap of paper and to place it, anonymously, in a box or bag as a means of providing\nideas for topics or issues they would like covered in a lesson. Sorting similar\nquestions together into categories by sex produces interesting, if tentative, \u00ae ndings.\nThe following emerged in the course of work I conducted in three co-educational\ncomprehensive schools between 1997 and 1999. Altogether data were collected\n254 Simon Forrest\nfrom about 500 young people aged either 13 or 14. Eight principal categories of\nquestion emerge.\nAlmost all the questions about the penis and erections were asked by boys. The\nmajority of questions were about the size of the average penis. This was\nsupplemented by questions about whether their own penis was big enough. They\nalso asked if it hard to get an erection, about impotence and ejaculation.\nThe second category of questions was about sexual acts. Again, almost all were\nasked by boys. They asked for descriptions of oral sex, masturbation and anal sex.\nThey also asked about the range and number of possible positions for heterosexual\nsexual intercourse. They asked about which is the most pleasurable position, for\nboth men and women, and how gay men and lesbian women have sexual\nintercourse.\nThe third category, in which almost equal numbers of questions were asked by\nboys and girls, was to do with puberty. The questions were usually seeking\nreassurance that the individual concerned was developing at the normal rate for their\nage. Boys focused on the growth of pubic and body hair and girls asked about breast\nsize and menarche.\nThe fourth category of questions was about conception and contraception.\nHere, questions from girls formed the slight majority. Equal numbers of questions\nwere about the signs of pregnancy and whether it was possible to conceive while\nmenstruating. Others asked about abortion and the relative effectiveness of the\ncontraceptive pill and the male condom. There were questions about the age at\nwhich it is legal to obtain or buy both the pill and condoms.\nA \u00ae fth category of questions, again found nearly as commonly from boys as\ngirls, related to the law. The majority asked for clari\u00ae cation about the age of consent\nto heterosexual sexual intercourse. Boys tended to ask why it only applied to girls\nand what the chances were of conviction if they had sex with a girl under the age of\nconsent.\nThe sixth category of questions were almost all asked by girls and were about\npressure from boys to have sexual intercourse. The penultimate group were all asked\nby girls and related to \u00ae rst heterosexual sexual intercourse. Fears about pain during\nsexual intercourse predominated. The \u00ae nal category was almost entirely from girls\nand was about discomfort and pain during menstruation.\nOverall, the greatest number of questions was asked about sexual acts. Roughly\nequal numbers concerned masturbation, oral sex and other sexual acts, with fewer\non sexual positions and homosexuality. There were nearly as many questions on\nconception and contraception; however, the range was much more limited. The\nthird most numerous group of questions related to the penis and erections. The\nlowest number of questions was asked in the remaining categories and comprised\nabout one- third of the total number of questions.\nOne should of course be cautious about the outcomes of this activity. There\nis no way to assess whether everyone made a contribution, or whether some\nmade no contribution and others submitted two or more questions. Responses\ncannot be differentiated according to ethnicity, religious conviction or social\nclass. Some young people may have submitted questions in order to amuse\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 255\nthemselves or their friends or to try and embarrass the teacher. The relative\nnumbers of questions asked in each identi\u00ae ed category are of less importance\nthan the topics. That said, there is an evident divergence between the concerns of\nboys and girls. For boys, sex is a technical feat to be mastered and a repertoire\nof couplings to be discovered and tried. Girls concern themselves with repulsing\nunwanted sexual attention and harassment from boys and, when they engage\nwith them, taking responsibility for the health and social consequences of\nintercourse.\nSecondary schooling is not the initial source for gender stereotypical attitudes\nand beliefs among boys or girls, nor it is necessarily the main reinforcement\nduring adolescence. Epstein (1997) has vividly described the reinforcement of\nwhat she terms \u00aa compulsory heterosexuality and of conventional gender relations\u00ba\n(p. 107) in her account of children\u2019s memories of a pretend wedding in a\nprimary school. In this pantomime, girls were dressed up as bridesmaids and a bride\nand acted out a marriage ceremony indulging in the explicit reproduction of\nnormative heterosexuality, with its panoply of messages about femininity and\nmasculinity as a desirable fantasy future. Brown (1995) has researched images of\nrelationships, gender and sexuality, and adolescence with a range of primary\nschool-aged children, and has shown that children frequently draw on stereotypical\nimages of heterosexual couples to illustrate concepts of love and intimate\nrelationships.\nIllustrating gender as partly a product of physical differences between men and\nwomen has long been an important part of educating boys. Traditionally, gender\nand sexual roles have been portrayed as the social expressions of a natural order. As\nReiss (1998b) has pointed out in his analysis of the representation of human\nsexuality in some science textbooks, the body remains important in maintaining\nmale conceptions of sex, gender and sexuality. Reiss notes much sexism, usually\ntaking the form of an assumption of heterosexuality and sex equating only with\npenetrative vaginal intercourse, within which women are mostly portrayed as\n\u00aa passive (supine) receptacles into which sperm are deposited\u00ba (p. 145). Much more\ntime is dedicated to describing sexual intercourse from the point of view of the male\nrather than the female, and female orgasm was mentioned in only \u00ae ve of the 15\nbooks reviewed. Bodies are always shown with the male penetrating lying on top of\nthe female. In another study, Jewitt (1997) notes that, while some current sexual\nhealth posters and lea\u00af ets do attempt to emphasize aspects of male sexuality usually\ndisregarded\u00d0 notably sexual responsibility and competence\u00d0 the overwhelming\nmass of images only serves to collude with conventional representations of\nmasculinity. Men are shown as more active than women in the context of sex and\n\u00aa acting on their desire, women enforce sexual protection\u00ba (p. 3); men are also less\nknowledgeable. Jewitt also notes an important gender differentiation around settings\nwhere sexual health is addressed. Men are shown as having sexual control in public\nurban environments, as sexually dangerous, and women are shown in control in\ndomestic settings. Finally, she highlights how male virility and sexual\ncompetitiveness are represented in the frequent symbolic imagery of sports, fast cars\nand motorbikes.\n256 Simon Forrest\nMale sexuality, status, power and control\nProper heterosexual manhood involves being sexually competent and skilled at\nsexual intercourse with women. Boys see the acquisition and display of sexual\nknowledge and experience as lending them status, whereas the main sources of\nprofessional sex education\u00d0 teachers, hearth educators and parents\u00d0 want them to\nbe considerate and responsible sexual partners. Some analysts of boys\u2019 reactions to\nschool-based sex education have concluded that their acting up is an effect of feeling\nthreatened by these messages. This might be so, but, I would maintain, not because\nsuch messages threaten boys\u2019 relationships with girls and femininity, but because\nthey are incompatible with the way they structure relations between themselves. The\nmanagement of discourses and performance about sex and sexuality are used as a\nway of jockeying for status with other boys. School capitalizes on much of the\nresources boys \u00ae nd for this. A major element in this is the body. There is good\nevidence (Peskin, 1967; Mussen & Jones, 1957) to show that boys entering puberty\nearlier than their peers acquire social advantages in terms of their degree of\nself-con\u00ae dence, assurance and popularity. Their appearance is more likely to lead to\nthem being selected or identi\u00ae ed as leaders and given responsibility by adults. This\nreaction to male sexual development may contribute to the confusion experienced\nby young people about whether sexual maturity, including sexual experience, is\nsocially valuable or not.\nThe added value of apparent sexual maturity through body size and early\ndevelopment is an essential component in the formation of male hierarchies in\nschool. Formal and informal activities collude with or become arenas for the\nsubversive establishment of body-based scales of status. Prendergast and Forrest\n(1998: 161) were struck by accounts frequently revolving around football. They\ndescribe one boy\u2019s report of a daily ritual as follows:\nEvery lunchtime a group of small boys played football on the school \u00ae elds.\nThey, like other groups of boys, had their particular patch, their place of\noccupation in the school space. A group of bigger boys often joined in with\ntheir game and took pleasure in getting the ball and keeping if from the\nsmaller boys, who were unable to push them off or catch them when they\nran away. In the game the big boys slid into tackles on the smaller boys,\nknocking them over. Some of the small boys slid into the big boys in return.\nThe big boys laughed and got up. But, sometimes the big boys tackled the\nsmaller boys with real viciousness, intending to hurt them.\nHere, smallness is associated with feeling shame and inadequacy. There is really\nnothing a small boy can do to avoid or challenge the attention of the bigger boys. He\nis likely to become the target in a ritualized form of bullying in which boys learn they\nhave to be submissive to physical power and to control their feelings. If a small boy\nloses his temper and kicks out he is likely to be hurt. The only way to gain status is\nto give in, accommodate and entertain the bigger boys, hoping that some of their\nbodily capital rubs off by association.\nThis kind of mobbing around a ritualised activity to acquire status with other\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 257\nboys is what is going on in disrupted sex education lessons. Here, the main vehicle\nis sexualized joking. The aim is show group allegiance, feel strength and solidarity\nfrom being with other boys. This is achieved by entertaining them through ridiculing\nthe subject, the teacher and other people in the room. A major component of this\nis aggressive heterosexism. This is no doubt stoked up by sex education provision\nwhich, for fear of political repercussions, shies away from correcting fallacious beliefs\nabout homosexuality and instead promotes erroneous models of heterosexual sexual\ninteraction.\nSex education provision and other cultural representations conspire in\nportraying r`eal\u2019 sex as penetrative vaginal intercourse, and investing in this act a\nwhole panoply of stereotypical beliefs, assumptions and attitudes about gender roles.\nHeterosexual male and female bodies are often constructed in the minds of boys as\ncomplementary (Forrest, 1997). Male bodies penetrate and females are penetrated.\nMale sexual desire and activity is hard, thrusting, ready and urgent. Females are\nsofter, receptive, slow to arouse and more passive. Homosexuality comes therefore\nto be understood as a shift in gender constructs to ful\u00ae l these complementary, and\napparently biologically essential, roles (Forrest, 2000).\nThe sum effect of these beliefs is to place sex and gender, especially the pursuit\nof an overt heterosexual masculinity, at the centre of schooling. Being male becomes\nabout the control of self, but also of physical and psychic space. Girls and gays are\nboth edged to the periphery in the pursuit of the trappings of a real manhood. It\nshould be noted, however, that this is contested and engaged with in all sorts of ways\nby boys and girls. Not all boys at all times are caught up in the madness. In fact, it\nseems not to emanate from any one particular source, being the product of\ninteractions between and within groups, and functioning to entertain as well as\ncontrol. At times boys and girls both engage in playful inversions and pantomimes,\nseemingly acknowledging the silliness of the rigidly gendered sexual roles they utilize\nto survive. Rosenthal (1984) nicely dramatized an example of this kind of cathartic\ncarnival in his play P\u2019Tang, Yang Kipperbang, making fun of the powerfulness of\nadolescent masculinity by showing off a ritualized inversion of the rules of male and\nfemale engagement:\nThe routine is this: Eunice stands with her back to the wall, blowing\nbubble-gum, as the boys, their homework in their satchels, form a queue in\nfront of her. Each boy, in turn then presses his body against Eunice\u2019 s for\na moment with complete absence of passion, then wanders from the room\nto go home. As each boy presses against her, Eunice\u00d0 automatically and\nunconvincingly \u00d0 complains: \u00aa Honestly, you\u2019 re terrible\/You boys, really!\/A\ngirl just isn\u2019 t safe!\/You\u2019 re horrible \u00bc it\u2019 s every night, the same\/I\u2019m\ndisgusted with you, truly I am \u00bc \u00ba\nConclusions\nSecondary school sex education in England seems to be regarded by boys as\nincompatible with the stresses and strains placed upon them to express a\n258 Simon Forrest\nburgeoning, bludgeoning masculinity. The ritualized bullying, hectoring,\ndenigration and showing off performed by male groups function as a testing ground\nfor \u00ae xing rigid ideas about gender and sexual roles, and the pattern of relations\nbetween boys and girls, and boys and other boys. Boys\u2019 experience of this proving\nground is complex. They often enter into problematic and challenging behaviour in\nsex education lessons while concealing profound concerns about sex and sexuality.\nTheir behaviour is often understood as a failure to articulate their needs and\nanxieties, a fear of being shamed by showing ignorance or doubt. As Harre and\nParrott (1996) point out, emotions, particularly those like shame and\nembarrassment, are social constructions performing functions of social control. The\nbehaviour of boys in sex education classes can therefore be seen as an attempt to\ndistance themselves from showing feelings which might place them at a social\ndisadvantage with their male peers. Despite the apparent dominance of action over\nwords, boys do express their concerns verbally, and it is through these accounts that\ninsights can be gained into the direction sex education needs to take to engage them\nand address their needs.\nMacLeod and Barter (1996) offer insight into this private world in their\ndescription of boys\u2019 calls to the telephone helpline, ChildLine. They report that few\nboys call in about pregnancy and partner relationships, more about domestic\nviolence, offending and school worries, and a disproportionately high number about\nsexuality, drug use and abusing other children. However, of all calls, only 18% come\nfrom boys. They report that boys talk less when they call; they are less \u00af uent and\neasy; and they are highly self-critical about having to seek help at all: \u00aa Real boys\ndon\u2019 t feel\u00ba (p. 14). MacLeod and Barter conclude that boys feel barred from talking\nbecause talk does not \u00ae t with their ideals of manhood, which run along the lines of\n\u00aa Boys act strong; they think it\u2019 s soft to ask for help; Boys have to be tough, girls are\nmore sensitive; Boys \u00ae nd it embarrassing and think it\u2019s their fault\u00ba (p. 30). Boys\n(mis)behaviour is troubling and dif\u00ae cult. However, as these authors sympathetically\nconclude (p. 32), \u00aa helping boys is important for future behaviour as men, fathers\nand family members\u00ba .\nWhat role can sexual relationships therapy and counselling play in providing\nthis help? The importance to boys of using knowledge, experience and prejudices\nabout sexuality to gain status within their male peer groups is evident. Therapeutic\ninterventions ought to acknowledge that talking about sexuality and gender with\nmen implies addressing their experience of relationships with other men in male peer\ngroups as much as their experience of sexual relationships with individual women or\nmen. In addition, there must be scope for dealing positively with male anxiety about\nsexual performance and showing that there is something enriching to be had from\nengaging in sex as part of emotional relationships. Boys\u2019 reluctance to use to health\nand welfare services suggests that promotional work might be undertaken aiming to\ninform them of the available help and support. There is a special need for\neasy-to-access support for young gay men. The visibility of the gendered body in\nboys\u2019 experiences of school and sex education suggests the need to take experiences\nof being big and small and of feelings of strength and vulnerability into account, and\nto encourage men to explore how their attitudes, beliefs and behaviour are re\u00af ected\nBoys learning about sexuality and manhood 259\nand felt in their bodies. Finally, men might be helped to understand their experience\nof their masculinity and male sexuality by looking back on their experiences of sex\neducation in school. Men could be helped to explore these experiences and see that\nthey were not representative of essential truths about sex and gender, but products\nof a context which militated against showing their needs for fear of being seen as less\nof man.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the Sex Education Forum for inviting me to prepare a\npresentation for the `Let\u2019 s Hear It For the Boys\u2019 conference which took place in\nLondon in April 1998, and which marks the origin of this writing.

I reserve my deepest gratitude for\nthe boys and girls whose lives and experiences I hope I represent with honesty and\naccuracy.\nNotes\n[1] In England and Wales, state school education is organized around three consecutive phases.\nPrimary education begins at about \u00ae ve years old and ends at 10. Secondary schooling begins at 11\nyears old and goes on until 16. From 16 years onwards most young people now undertake further\nstudy in secondary schools or colleges of further education and may go on to higher education,\nusually provided through universities. For most this begins at age 18.\n[2] The majority of state funded schools are managed through local government which is prohibited\nfrom \u00aa intentionally promoting homosexuality as pretended family lifestyle\u00ba . Repeal of this\ntroublesome law, dif\u00ae cult to interpret and not strictly binding on schools but on the layer of local\ngovernmental management responsible for them, was, at the time of writing, undergoing an uneasy\nand uncertain passage through Parliament.\n[3] The National Curriculum provides a framework that describes what subjects should be taught in\nschools and includes targets for achievement at the end of four stages spanning the primary and\nsecondary sectors. The Guidance on Health Education is a detailed plan for the organization of\neducation about a range of health topics, including sexual health, across the subjects in this\ncurriculum.\nReferences\nALLEN, I.
