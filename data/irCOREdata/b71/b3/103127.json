Selecting couples from the German SocioEconomic \nPanel that married between 1990 and 1995 in the former East and West regions of Germany \nand following them until 2000 (N = 348 couples), I find evidence of direct, interaction, and \ncontextual effects predicting husbands\u2019 hours in and share of household tasks, but not \nchildcare. East German men perform a greater share of household tasks than West German \nmen after controlling for individual attributes and regional factors. Childcare remains more \ngendered, and the first child\u2019s age proves the most important predictor of fathers\u2019 \ninvolvement. These findings further our understanding of how the state shapes gender equity \nin the home. \n \nKey words:  cross-national comparative; division of labor; housework; longitudinal analysis \n  3 \nPersistent Policy Effects on the Division of Domestic Tasks  \nin Reunified Germany \n \nThe private sphere of the household nests within broader sociopolitical institutions, \nbut only recently have analyses compared the division of domestic tasks across countries.  \nEarlier analyses found no cross-country differences in men\u2019s domestic share once controlling \nfor individual variables (Baxter, 1997; Kalleberg & Rosenfeld, 1990).  More recent analyses \nfound not only modest cross-national variation (Batalova & Cohen, 2002; Davis & \nGreenstein, 2004), but also interaction effects between individual variables and contextual \nmeasures attributable to the policy environment (Fuwa, 2004; Geist, 2005; Hook, 2006).  This \nevidence suggests policies not only alter women\u2019s level of individual resources, but also \nwomen\u2019s aggregate level of these resources alters the effect of individual resources on couple \nnegotiations. Breen and Cooke (2005) argue this occurs because the larger the proportion of \neconomically autonomous women in a society, the more likely men as a group will believe \nand act upon the belief that more sharing of domestic tasks is necessary for successful \nmarriages.   \nThese studies, however, share similar limitations.  All are based on cross-sectional \ndata, whereas women\u2019s time in paid and unpaid labor varies across union status as well as the \nmarital life course, making panel data more suitable (Gupta, 1999; Kalleberg & Rosenfeld, \n1990).  Cross-sectional data also exclude information from couples divorcing prior to the year \nof survey, potentially overlooking information on almost half of the first-married population. \nThe surveys all use a single respondent for information about the entire household, with \nresults varying with the gender of the respondent. Many studies show women and men \noverestimate their own domestic hours (Coltrane, 2000) and Lee (2005) finds that women \nmight underestimate men\u2019s. Consequently, greater accuracy comes from getting information \nfrom each person in a couple, particularly when comparing relative shares.  The studies also \nonly compare the division of household tasks, which might include some care activities, but \nnone compares couple negotiation of childcare with other domestic tasks. Finally, although \nsome use statistical techniques to account for unmeasured national differences (Batalova & \nCohen, 2003; Fuwa, 2004; Hook, 2006), these cannot differentiate between policy and \ncultural effects.  \nHere I extend our understanding of policy effects on the household division of labor \nby using better data, employing a natural country experiment to differentiate policy from \nunmeasured cultural effects, comparing the husbands\u2019 hours in and share of household tasks \n  4 \nas well as childcare, and examining the persistence of policy effects on gender relations after \nthe policies themselves have changed. I use the longitudinal German SocioEconomic Panel \ndata to compare first-married couples\u2019 divisions of household tasks and childcare across the \nformer East and West Germany during the 1990s.  These two regions provide a natural \nexperiment for differentiating between cultural and policy effects because they are comprised \nof people who shared a common cultural past but were nondemocratically subjected to \nradically different policies after World War II.  West Germany put in place policies \nsupporting women\u2019s responsibility for the home and her economic reliance on a male \nbreadwinner whereas East Germany adopted a Stalinist constitution expecting and supporting \nwomen\u2019s employment with a web of public services and related policies. Time diary data \nfrom the 1960s reveal the division of domestic tasks more egalitarian in all socialist countries \nat that time, and in East Germany as compared with West Germany (Hook, 2006). \nNow the two regions are reunified under the West German state. If what matters is the \nimmediate policy context, the division of domestic tasks should now be similar across the \nregions, varying only in the degree to which previous policy may have altered individual \nlevels of relative resources such as educational attainment (Baxter, 1997).  To the extent the \ndivergent policy paths fundamentally rather than temporally alter relative gender power as \nargued by Breen and Cooke, then a more egalitarian division of domestic tasks should remain \namong East couples once controlling for individual resources. As East Germany provided \nstate support for the care of children and regional differences in this persist, the household \ndivision of childcare is also compared across the two regions. Ascertaining whether effects \nprevail under a shifting policy environment provides an important extension to our \nunderstanding of how the state shapes, rather than simply reflects, societal gender relations.   \n \nPREDICTING THE DIVISION OF DOMESTIC LABOR \nRelative power or resources, time availability, and the gender perspective dominate \nanalyses of the household division of labor.  Time availability and relative resource models \npredict women\u2019s rising employment should have led to a revolution in the domestic roles of \nwomen and men.  Most empirical evidence from the United States suggests that relative \nresources predict some shift in the division of household tasks, but not enough to indicate an \neven exchange of paid for unpaid work (Goldscheider & Waite, 1991; Shelton & John, 1996). \nAs to time availability, men\u2019s domestic hours across industrialized countries increased \nmodestly since 1960, but not sufficiently to countermand women\u2019s increase in work hours \n(Bianchi et al., 2000; Gershuny, 2000; Sullivan, 2006). U.S. men assume more tasks if they \n  5 \nwork different shifts from their wives (Presser, 1994), but in many countries the observed \nincrease in men\u2019s share of domestic tasks over the past 40 years results from women\u2019s \nreduction in their own housework (Bianchi et al., 2000; Sullivan, 2006).    \nSo the revolution in the gendered division of domestic tasks predicted by women\u2019s \nrising employment failed to occur. Controlling for employment or earnings, U.S. women \nincrease their housework hours when partnered with a man whereas men decrease their hours \nwhen partnered with a woman, with the change most acute when children are present (Gupta, \n1999; South & Spitze, 1994).  Evidence from Australia (Bittman et al., 2003) and the United \nStates (Brines, 1994; Fenstermaker Berk, 1985; Greenstein, 2000; Hochschild, 1989) also \nreveals that as a woman\u2019s earnings exceed those of the man, she takes on a greater rather than \nlesser share of housework as predicted by relative resource or time availability models. These \ndynamics support the gender perspective:  A gendered division of labor does not reflect \nsimple exchanges of relative resources or time, but is a symbolic expression of gender \ndifference that produces and reproduces gender hierarchies (Fenstermaker Berk, 1985; Ferree, \n1990; West & Zimmerman, 1987). These gendered hierarchies vary in context and across \ncountries, reflecting gender regimes (Connell, 1987) or cultures (Pfau-Effinger, 1998).      \nOnly recently have studies explicitly compared how the gendered division of labor at \nthe family level varies with the sociopolitical structure in which it is negotiated.  The earliest \ncomparative work reported little cross-country variation in either the gendered division of \nhousework or the effects of relative resources, time availability, and gender ideology on \naltering it (Baxter, 1997, comparing Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, and the United \nStates; Kalleberg & Rosenfeld, 1990, comparing Canada, Norway, Sweden, and the United \nStates).  Baxter (1997) concluded that any gains in gender equality in the home would result \nfrom women\u2019s greater access to individual resources.  \nIn contrast, Davis and Greenstein (2004) used data from 13 advanced industrial as \nwell as transitional economies in the International Social Justice Project and found that after \ncontrolling for individual attributes, indicator variables for each of the countries predicted \nstatistically significant variation in the division of household tasks such as cooking, laundry, \nand cleaning. More egalitarian divisions occurred in some, but not all, of the former socialist \ncountries and the most gendered division in Japan.  They offer that the contradictory results \nfor the former socialist countries might reflect the degree to which citizens responded to \npolitical change by reinforcing gender stereotypes in the home, but they did not speculate why \nthis might occur in only some of these countries.  \n  6 \nUsing the United Nations\u2019 Gender Empowerment Measure, 22 industrial and \ntransitional countries in the 1994 International Social Survey Program, and hierarchical linear \nmodeling, Batalova and Cohen (2002) and Fuwa (2004) found that the Gender Empowerment \nMeasure predicted systematic differences in the division of female household tasks once \ncontrolling for individual variables.  The Gender Empowerment Measure captures the percent \nof parliamentary seats held by women; the percent of women in administrative, managerial, \nand professional or technical positions; and women\u2019s share of earnings income, factors \ndirectly attributable to the gendered extent of national policy regimes (Orloff, 1993).  In all \ncountries, women retained primary responsibility for laundry, shopping, deciding what to \nhave for dinner, and tending to sick family members.  Batalova and Cohen found that couples\u2019 \npremarital cohabitation predicted a more egalitarian division of these tasks.   Once controlling \nfor this individual-level experience, a country\u2019s overall cohabitation rate and the Gender \nEmpowerment Measure also predicted the division of household tasks within married couples.  \nYet again, inconsistencies emerge.  Eastern European countries with high historical \ncohabitation rates did not have as egalitarian divisions of household tasks as these rates \nshould predict.    \nUsing the same data and technique, Fuwa (2004) found interaction effects between the \nGender Empowerment Measure and individual resources.  Time availability and gender \nideology effects proved stronger or weaker for women in more versus less egalitarian \ncountries, respectively, although the substantive differences were quite modest and \ninconsistencies persisted.  With most former socialist regimes, time availability had weaker \neffects than predicted by their Gender Empowerment Measure, whereas liberal regimes such \nas Britain and Australia showed stronger effects of wives\u2019 full-time employment than that \nmeasure would predict.  Fuwa offered no explanation for these inconsistencies.  Geist (2005) \nalso used the 1994 International Social Survey Program data but analyzed 10 more advanced \nindustrialized societies to find ideology effects weaker whereas time availability effects were \nstronger in corporatist-conservative welfare regimes such as Germany.  \nHook (2006) claims policies supporting female employment shift the benefits of \nspecialization. Using a hierarchical linear model and time diary data from 20 countries over \nseveral decades and controlling for the percentage of married women employed, women\u2019s \nwork hours, public childcare slots for infants, and weeks of parental leave, she found \nwomen\u2019s greater aggregate employment rate predicts men\u2019s greater time in domestic tasks \nregardless of an individual woman\u2019s employment. Breen and Cooke (2005) argue where \npolicies enhance women\u2019s economic autonomy, the proportion of women desiring a gendered \n  7 \ndivision of labor declines to the point that men believe any female partner will expect a more \negalitarian division of domestic tasks.  What is necessary to observe greater gender equality is \nthat the proportion of economically autonomous women must be sufficiently high to change \nmen\u2019s beliefs about what a partner would expect in the domestic sphere, and his willingness \nto act on those beliefs so that we evolve away from separate spheres. Such a general shift is \nreflected in Hook\u2019s results for countries with high female labor force participation.  \nAs noted, however, the studies to date share common limitations. All use cross-\nsectional data with a sole household respondent, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of \ncouple negotiations (Gupta, 1999; Kalleberg & Rosenfeld, 1990).  For any given couple, \nemployment, earnings, and time in domestic tasks vary across the marital life course as \npartners accrue work experience, move, lose a job, have children, and so on. Using \nlongitudinal data enables us to control for the effects of such changes in any given time period \non the division of housework or childcare, although trying to assess the specific influence of \nchange in each in any given marital year would quickly prove unwieldy.   \nTaking a cross-sectional sample also yields a biased sample of still-married couples. In \nan analysis of 188 societies, Fisher (1993) finds that the maximum risk of divorce consistently \noccurs two to four years after marriage. The studies above do not report average marriage \nduration, but in one married sample drawn from the National Survey of Families and \nHouseholds, the average marriage duration was 17 years (Greenstein, 2000: p. 327), whereas \nin 1990, the median U.S. first marriage duration was approximately 8 years (National Center \nfor Health Statistics, 1995). In a cross-section of married European couples drawn from the \n1994 European Community Household Panel, the author found the average marriage duration \nranged from 11 years in Great Britain to 18 years in Italy. So cross-sectional results provide \ninsight into bargaining dynamics among only a fraction of all first-married couples.   \nThe comparative studies above focused as well on the division of domestic tasks, at \ntimes including some child-related care in a combined measure (Batalova & Cohen, 2002; \nFuwa, 2004; Hook, 2006). Thus we have no direct evidence of variation in the factors \naffecting the division of care as compared with other domestic tasks. Bargaining models \nassume household tasks are unpleasant activities that individuals wish to avoid, whereas this \nassumption proves untenable when tasks are displays of love and caring (Ferree, 1990). In a \nrecent overview of U.S. time diary data from the 1960s to the late 1990s, Sayer (2005) finds \nthat across the time period women have reduced and men have increased their hours in \nhousework while both have increased their time in childcare. Further, a key family policy \nvariant across countries is the extent to which it relies on women\u2019s unpaid care work or \n  8 \nprovides support for maternal employment, both of which affect the time in childcare either \nparent might spend. Consequently, controlling for the availability of public childcare for very \nyoung children demanding the most parental time is important to our understanding of policy \neffects on the gendered division of labor.  \nConceptually, a much broader range of policies shapes gender relations within a \ncountry. Cooke (2007) extends Orloff\u2019s (1993) dimensions for analyzing gender effects \nwithin welfare regimes to detail how education, labor, tax, and social insurance policies, along \nwith family law, alter women\u2019s relative power in household bargaining.  Labor laws directly \naffect women\u2019s access to paid work and the relative wages earned. Education policies affect \nwomen\u2019s relative power by the degree to which they might pursue careers on a par with men. \nThe structure of public compulsory education systems also inhibits women\u2019s ability to \nparticipate in the labor force if there is little provision of childcare before public schooling \nstarts, or if the scheduling of public schooling includes breaks during the week or long \nvacations between school terms (Gornick, Meyers, & Ross, 1997).   \nEducation and labor laws affect all types of couples, whereas many tax and family \nlaws and social policies differentiate between legally married and other couples. Higher \nmarginal tax rates, where a second earner\u2019s income gets taxed at a higher percentage, \ndiscourage female employment among married couples, particularly high-earning married \ncouples (Jaumotte, 2003). Tax credits for dependent spouses also discourage married \nwomen\u2019s employment, again more markedly among higher earners if calculated as a \npercentage of income rather than at a flat rate.  Paternity leave encourages greater sharing of \nchildcare, but extensive maternity leave and policies encouraging part-time employment \nreinforce a gendered division of labor (Hook, 2006; Jaumotte, 2003).  \nBenefit entitlement such as unemployment or health insurance and family leave can be \nbased on either individual contributions, which encourages dual-earners, or household \nincome, which tends to reinforce a male breadwinner model. Yet the household test does not \nnecessarily apply to cohabiting couples as it would for married couples, and cohabiting \ncouples at times deny their coresidency in order to continue to qualify for benefits as single \nheads of household.  Family law affects women\u2019s rights in the event of marital dissolution and \nher alternatives to a given relationship and, in turn, her relative power under social exchange \nparameters (Blau, 1960).  In many countries such as the U.S., contract rather than family law \ncovers cohabiting couples, so their rights in this regard vary as well (Kamerman & Kahn, \n1997).  \n  9 \nIt proves impossible to capture all of these elements affecting couples in a great \nnumber of countries with three or four policy variables and even the most advanced statistical \ntechniques, so from time to time a more detailed comparison of fewer well chosen cases is in \norder. Here I extend the comparative findings by using the longitudinal German \nSocioEconomic Panel to compare first-married couples\u2019 division of domestic tasks and \nchildcare during the early years of their marriage across the former East and West Germany. \nAs detailed next, young Germans marrying during the 1990s grew up under two different \npolicy structures that varied their reinforcement of separate spheres, but now both negotiate \nthe household division of labor under the West German state. This analysis not only allows us \nto see how different policies affect the division of household tasks and childcare, but whether \npolicy effects enhancing women\u2019s economic autonomy persist after the specific policy \nprovisions cease.  \n \nEAST AND WEST GERMANY: A NATURAL POLICY EXPERIMENT \nAlthough arguably coming from a common cultural heritage, the two German regions \nalso exhibited nonpolitical differences before and after World War II much as we might \nobserve across U.S. states. There was a greater prevalence of Protestantism and living in rural \ncommunities in the East L\u00e4nder and more Catholics and urban dwellers in the West, but there \nis variation in these aspects within each region as well as across them and they evolve over \ntime (Bertram, 1996).  In contrast, a substantial political divide was immediately and \nexternally imposed after the War. In 1949, five L\u00e4nder were formed into East Germany, or \nthe German Democratic Republic, under Soviet occupation, whereas the remaining L\u00e4nder \nformed West Germany, or the Federal Republic of Germany, under British, French, and U.S. \noccupation.  East Germany was forced to constitute a new government following the socialist \nmodel of Stalinist Russia, whereas Allies required that a new West German constitution \ncontaining no vestiges of either the Third Reich or socialism (Moeller, 1993, 1997).   \nWest German Policy:  1949 - 1990 \nThe Allies identified the Catholic Church as an institution that had not succumbed to \nthe Nazi dictatorship, so conservative West German politicians successfully argued that the \nnew political system be founded on the pater familias supported by the Church (Gerhard, \n1992; Moeller, 1993; Ostner, 1992; Zimmerman, 1993). Child allowances (Kindergeld) were \nintroduced in 1954 and payable to wage earners with three or more children.  Although \nfemale heads of households\u2014in the early 1950s, nearly five million out of West Germany\u2019s \n  10 \n15 million households were headed by divorcees or widows\u2014were eligible for these \nallowances, only 13% of single mothers qualified (Moeller, 1997).  Taxation systems and \nrebates benefited high-income, single-earner families. The public health insurance scheme \nalso favored single-earner families, as contributions were based on a percentage of income for \neach adult earner, not on family size, so that partners not employed and children could be \ninsured at no extra cost whereas dual-earner couples paid a percentage on each income (Hohn, \n1990).   \nMothers were deemed the only satisfactory educators of their children, so school \nschedules varied from day to day and children were expected to return home for lunch \n(Ostner, 1993; von Oertzen, 1999).  A report published in 1966 highlighted gender disparities \nin educational attainment and concluded that women were failing to exploit fully their right of \neducation, contrary to the interests of society in terms of educating the next generation (von \nOertzen, 1999).  Until the 1970s, West German women tended to leave the educational system \nearlier than men, although fewer women than men had no degree. \nThe child rebates favoring higher-income households were discontinued in 1975 and \nreplaced by a more generous system of child allowances. During this period, the government \nalso acknowledged the existence of nontraditional families. It was no longer illegal to rent \nrooms to unmarried couples and the legal positions of single mothers and illegitimate children \nwere defined and strengthened in 1970 (Ostner, 1992; Zimmerman, 1993). Yet unmarried \ncouples still pay higher taxes, have no right to be heir to each other, and the biological father \nhas no right to custody of the children, suggesting very different household factors affect \ncohabiting as compared with legally married couples (Kolbe, 1999).  Consequently, out-of-\nwedlock births under the West German state make women more economically vulnerable than \neither divorced or widowed women (Ostner, 1993).  \nDuring the 1980s, a conservative government reinstated several advantages for male \nbreadwinner families, including tax rebates, a new childrearing leave targeted toward women, \nand the baby year pension credit of one year per child for women born after 1921 (Hohn, \n1990; Ostner, 1993; Zimmerman, 1993).  These provisions encouraged women to exit the \nlabor market during the period of high general unemployment Germany began to experience \nin the early 1980s, which both reinforced West German men\u2019s priority claim to employment \nand women\u2019s domestic roles and reliance on a male breadwinner. \n  11 \nEast German Policy: 1949 - 1990 \n The Stalinist constitution adopted by East Germany in 1949 enforced not just \nwomen\u2019s right but also obligation to work (Budde, 1999; Moeller, 1993; Trappe, 2000).  In \n1950, the marriage and family law regulations that had been a legacy of the German Civil \nCode were abolished (Ostner, 1992). In contrast to West Germany, the East German state \nmandated developing the skill credentials of women through education and vocational training \n(Budde, 1999), although most women selected from among 16 training programs in traditional \nfemale occupations out of almost 200 possible vocations open to them (Nickel, 1992). A \nlarger proportion of East German women attended professional colleges and university than in \nWest Germany (Tons & Young, 2001).  \n The 1950 Mother and Child Care and Women\u2019s Rights Acts established a range of \nsocial services in support of full female employment, including plans for a network of public \nchildcare centers, kindergartens, and facilities for free school meals; maternity leave for five \nweeks before and six weeks after delivery at 100% of their take-home earnings; and days off \nto tend sick children (Ostner, 1993; Zimmerman, 1993).   Between 1966 and 1972, specific \npolicies included expansion of childcare facilities, childbirth subsidies, extension of paid \nmaternity leave to 18 weeks, and easier access to housing and pension credits for motherhood \nyears (Gerhard, 1992; M\u00fcnz & Ulrich, 1995; Trappe, 2000; Zimmerman, 1993).  Between \n1972 and 1989, maternity leave was extended to 20 weeks, additional financial support for \nsecond children was introduced, and child and health care services were expanded \n(Zimmerman, 1993).  \n By the time of reunification in 1990, over 90% of married women in the former East \nGermany were employed (a figure including those on maternity leave), more than two thirds \nfull-time. In contrast, just 44% of married women in the West were employed and only half of \nthese employed full time (Ostner, 1993).  The West German rate is very similar to the \nhistorical employment rate for married women in all of Germany up until World War II \n(Bock, 1991).  Although East German women\u2019s educational attainment and employment \nparticipation nearly equaled that of men, the East German pronatalist policies still assigned \nwomen responsibility for the domestic sphere, so maternity leaves, missed days caring for sick \nchildren, etcetera, were costs of female employees (Nickel, 1992).  As a result, women were \nviewed as less productive than male employees and were denied key on-the-job training and \npromotions (Einhorn, 1993; Ferree, 1992).  The centralized wage setting in socialist East \nGermany did nothing to rectify gender wage differentials (Sorensen & Trappe, 1995). \nConsequently, the net wages of East German women working full time were 76% of men\u2019s \n  12 \n(Nickel, 1992), as compared with 65% for West German women working full-time (Frevert, \n1989; Gornick, 1999).   \nEast German policy also failed to promote men\u2019s participation in domestic work. The \n1965 Familiengesetzbuch called for a new male consciousness, but no policies were \nimplemented to encourage it.  The continuing gender differences in the division of paid and \nunpaid labor in the home led to the 1989 founding of the Unabhaengiger Frauenverband to \norganize autonomous women\u2019s groups and be a voice in policy making, demanding the \nestablishment of women\u2019s equality offices and lobbying for full employment, reduced paid \nwork hours, and increased benefits for childrearing for both men and women (Ferree, 1992).     \n The difference in women\u2019s relative resources, however, still yielded a more although \nnot fully egalitarian division of domestic labor in East Germany as compared with West \nGermany prior to unification.  Analyses of time diary data from the 1960s reveal East German \nmen performed an average of 126 minutes per day in all domestic tasks (including 18 minutes \nin childcare), as compared with 92 minutes (including 10 minutes in childcare) for West \nGerman men (Hook, 2006, p. 645).  A 1991 time-budget study by the Federal Statistical \nOffice found a similar regional difference shortly after reunification, with the ratio of women \nto men\u2019s time in housework 2.4 to 1 in the West and 1.8 to 1 in the East (Rosenfeld, Trappe, \n& Gornick, 2004). But many East German women\u2019s policy advantages fell with the Berlin \nWall. \nReunified Germany \nFollowing reunification, the West German policy structure applied to East Germany. \nMany childcare centers were closed, although the supply of public childcare still remains \nsubstantially higher in the East (Wrohlich, 2005).  In 1991, East German firms privatized by \nthe Treuhand granted only 3,400 of 20,800 vocational training places to girls (Ostner, 1993), \nand fewer than one in four new jobs went to women (Gerhard, 1992).  Shifting to a market \neconomy also resulted in severe economic dislocation, with unemployment disproportionately \nhigh among women so that during the decade, women\u2019s employment levels in the two regions \nconverged (Gerhard, 1992; Rosenfeld et al., 2004).   \nDespite these changes, East German women exhibit a stubbornness (Eigensinn) in \nretaining what Adler (2004, p. 1171) terms \u201cthe German Democratic Republic standard \nbiography.\u201d As of 1994, East German women and men reported less ideological support for a \nmale breadwinner model than West Germans (Breen & Cooke, 2005).  Preliminary analysis of \nthe 2002 International Social Survey Program by the author suggests that the East German \n  13 \nideology persists among women, but East German men now report slightly greater support for \nseparate spheres than they did in 1994.   \nThis persistence of women\u2019s ideology despite reunification under a common state is \nconsistent with Therborn\u2019s (1980) notion that ideology is shaped over time by historical \nmaterial relations.  A necessary antecedent to a new social order is the ability to conceive that \nanother way is possible and just.  The policies implemented in East Germany after World War \nII enabled East German women to conceive of an alternative way of dividing paid labor, \nalthough the subsequent pronatalist policies in turn reinforced women\u2019s responsibility for \nchildrearing, East women had already conceived of a more just way and feminist activism \nwithin the country accelerated despite extensive structural barriers (Ferree, 1993).  Not until \nsecond wave feminism of the 1970s and 1980s did West German women begin to gain policy \nsupport in new possibilities for the organization of productive tasks (Tons & Young, 2001). \nAt the time of unification, West German young adults had formed their expectations \nregarding life and relationships under policies supporting separate spheres of a male \nbreadwinner model, whereas East German young adults formed expectations under policies \nsupporting women\u2019s full time employment.  If material relations over time shape gender \nrelations in the private sphere as suggested by both Breen and Cooke (2005) and Therborn \n(1980), then regardless of East German women\u2019s actual educational attainment, work hours, \nor wages under reunified Germany, East couples should display more egalitarian divisions of \ndomestic tasks.  Analyzed next are to what extent these direct and contextual effects predict \nthe postunification division of household tasks and childcare among East and West German \nfirst-married couples.   \nIn addition to individual education and employment-related resources, women\u2019s age, \nnumber and ages of children, couples\u2019 cohabitation history, and marital duration also affect \nmen\u2019s hours or share in housework (Batalova & Cohen, 2002; Coltrane, 2000).  At the \ncontextual level, Fuwa (2004) and Hook (2006) found that aggregate female employment \nrates influenced housework divisions.  Brines (1994) found that U.S. men\u2019s unemployment \nresulted in evidence of gender display, so a higher rate of general unemployment might \nincrease evidence of this in terms of the household division of domestic tasks once controlling \nfor men\u2019s and women\u2019s individual work hours. The availability of public childcare in the \nL\u00e4nder remains one persistent policy difference that encourages female employment and \nreduces the total number of caring hours to be shared within a couple.  \n \n \n  14 \nMETHOD \nData and Sample \nThe division of German household tasks and childcare are analyzed using data from \nthe 1990 to 2000 waves of the German SocioEconomic Panel.  The panel is a longitudinal \nstudy of private German households where each member over the age of 16 is interviewed \nannually.  It began in 1984 with a representative sample of 12,290 people in 5,921 (out of \n7,979 contacted or 74%) West German households.  Sampling extended into the former East \nin June 1990, covering 4,453 persons in 2,179 (out of 3,114 contacted or 70%) households.  \nAs of the 2000 wave, over 68% of West German and 86% of East German households were \nstill in the panel.   \nGerman couples marrying for the first time between 1990 and 1995 are selected and \nfollowed until 2000 to compare household dynamics in the decade following reunification.  \nBy following new couples over time, we are able to incorporate changes as the marital life \ncourse progresses.  This particular sample is chosen because these individuals were socialized \nunder the two different states, but negotiated their married lives under the West German state.  \nCouples already married as of 1990 are excluded from analysis, as their inclusion biases \nresults with marriages of longer duration and would include East German couples whose \nmarriages spanned both state policy structures. Historically, East German couples cohabited \nrather than married at a much greater rate than West German couples, but this difference is \nconverging among the younger cohorts (Adler, 2004). As noted above, West German policy \nand law still favors legally married over cohabiting couples with rights varying across the two \ngroups. Consequently, the analysis of policy effects here is limited to married couples.   \nAn indicator variable differentiates couples when the woman and man were educated \nin the former East, yielding samples of 298 West and 50 East couples, a distribution roughly \nrepresentative of the population distribution across the two regions.  This proxy captures the \nsocial environment young people were exposed to while forming their expectations and \nideologies about women\u2019s and men\u2019s normative roles in society. Further analysis indicates \nthat there is little migration across the regions since that time; by the end of the observation \nwindow, only one couple educated in the East resided in West Germany, and only four West \nGerman couples resided in East Germany. Eight mixed-region couples were categorized with \nWest couples because of the similarities in the averages of their characteristics. Couples are \nfollowed annually until 2000 unless they divorce or otherwise exit the panel, yielding a total \nanalytical sample of 2,142 West and 335 East German couple-years.  Subsequent analyses \nsuggest that younger, lower-income couples were more likely to have missing data for some \n  15 \nof the years that reduces total couple-years in the analysis, but the number of couples \nrepresented remains constant.  Only couples with children are included in the analyses of the \ndivision of childcare: 248 West and 36 East German couples, yielding 1,840 West and 259 \nEast German couple-years, 1,809 total after listwise deletion of missing data. Subsequent \nanalyses again indicate younger, lower-income parents are more likely to have missing data in \nsome years but this does not alter substantive effects. \nVariables \nFour dependent variables cover men\u2019s hours in and share of household tasks and \nchildcare. Every year, each member of the household over the age of 16 is asked, \u201cHow many \nhours per day do you spend on the following activities? Please give only whole hours. Use \nzero if the activity does not apply.\u201d  The activities include \u201cerrands (shopping, errands, \ncitizen\u2019s duties),\u201d \u201chousework (washing, cooking, cleaning),\u201d \u201cchild care,\u201d and \u201crepairs on or \naround the house, car repairs, garden work.\u201d This question is further differentiated depending \non survey year in terms of \u201ctypical weekday,\u201d \u201ctypical Saturday,\u201d and \u201ctypical Sunday,\u201d \nalthough only information on typical weekday is gathered every year. A question regarding \ntime spent on Saturday and Sunday is asked in survey years 1990, 1993, 1995, 1997, and \n1999. As the information thus varies consistently for couples, no effort was made to \ninterpolate weekend time in the interim survey years, particularly as household time varies \nyear-to-year for young couples as they form their families and other family circumstances \nchange, a supposition confirmed by the within-couple variation reported in Table 2. \nA man\u2019s hours in household tasks are calculated as his reported time spent in \nshopping, errands, citizen\u2019s duties, washing, cooking, cleaning, and repairs on or around the \nhouse, car repairs, and garden work. I follow Hook (2006) and Lee (2005) in using this \nbroader definition of household tasks because all are necessary to successful home production \nand must be negotiated, although the time spent in repairs or gardening tends to be limited to \nweekends and therefore these hours are only included every other year when the question \nregarding weekend time was included in the survey. Husbands in both regions report \nperforming slightly more time in gardening and repairs than wives, with time in these tasks \ngreater in the East, but these differences are not the primary source of the ones subsequently \nreported. Husband\u2019s share of household tasks is his reported time divided by the summed \nreports from him and his wife, who reports her own hours in these activities. A man\u2019s \nchildcare hours are those fathers report, with his share calculated as his reported hours divided \nby the total of his and his wife\u2019s reported childcare hours. These data do not allow for \nestimating simultaneity of childcare with household tasks.  \n  16 \nIndependent individual variables capture relative resources and time availability.  The \nGerman educational system is quite complex, as is the way it is assessed and recorded on the \nGerman SocioEconomic Panel, comprised of different types of secondary schools leading to \ndifferent postsecondary opportunities and an extensive vocational and technical training \nsystem. Consequently, a years-of-education variable is not comparable across individuals as \nmight be the case in general education systems such as the U.S. Most research suggests it is \nthe highest educational attainment associated with different domestic divisions, so two \nindicator variables are created: one each for when the woman or the man has a university \ndegree against a referent of less than university, which includes both secondary schooling and \nsome technical tertiary schooling.  A relative measure in terms of women having more \neducation than the man was tried, but proved insignificant. \nAfter exploring different relative measures, employment effects were assessed using \neach partner\u2019s weekly work hours, along with the wife\u2019s hourly wages.  Two interaction terms \nare created to test whether Fuwa\u2019s (2004) employment-related interaction effects are \nreplicated with these longitudinal data: one for (East* wives\u2019 weekly employment hours), and \none for (East* wives\u2019 wages). Ideology measures are not available in these German data, but \nanother recent analysis using cross-sectional data finds that ideology varies across the two \nregions but only proves significant in predicting the division of domestic tasks in West \nGermany, with the magnitude of these effects similar for West German women and men \n(Cooke, 2006a).    \nIndividual control variables include months the couple cohabited prior to marriage, the \nwoman\u2019s age at marriage, marriage duration in years, and indicator variables for key age \ngroups of the first child and whether the couple had a second child to assess father\u2019s absolute \nand relative time in childcare across the child\u2019s early life as well as across children. An \nadditional control for total number of children proved insignificant when modeling effects in \nthis way. The child indicators are one for when the first child is younger than two years of age \nand one when the first child is between three and six years of age (as of 1999, maximum \nmaternity leave ended early during a child\u2019s third year or 162 weeks), against a referent of \nfirst children aged 7 to 9, the oldest child in this group of young first-married couples. The \nthird indicator is whether the parents had a second child against a referent of having only one \nchild.    \nContextual variables include regional unemployment rates, regional female \nemployment rates, and the availability of public childcare slots. The regional employment \ndata are those published by the Federal Statistical Office for each year of the panel.  The \n  17 \nnumber of public childcare slots per 1,000 eligible children under the age of three for each \nyear in each L\u00e4nde is provided by the Deutsches Jugendinstitut in Munich for the years 1991, \n1994, 1998, and 2002. Childcare slots for the interim years were imputed as simple averages \nfrom the available yearly data. \nAnalytic Strategy \nLongitudinal data present special challenges even when used to assess a relatively \nstraightforward outcome such as couples\u2019 division of household labor. The repeated annual \ninquiry of the same couple violates assumptions of ordinary least squares regression that \nobservations be independent and that error terms not be correlated. Consequently, a random \neffects model using generalized least squares is used here to regress husbands\u2019 hours and \nshares of household tasks, and fathers\u2019 hours and share of childcare on the array of individual \nrelative resource, interaction, and contextual variables. Random effects models account for \nthe correlation between successive measurements within a given couple, as well as assess \nvariation resulting from the independent variables across couples. In other words, they \nseparate within-couple changes in the division of domestic tasks over time from differences \nacross couples. Unweighted data are used in the analysis, although substantive differences \nwhen weighting or not are very small. \n \nRESULTS \n Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. An equal percentage of East and West \nGerman women have a university degree (6%), but a larger percentage of East men (16%) \nhave a university degree as compared with West German men (11%).  Men in both regions \nwork comparable full-time hours (40 per week), but a woman\u2019s paid work hours vary across \nregions and her parental status.  Women in East Germany work slightly more weekly hours on \naverage (18 vs. 15 West German women), and among employed women, East German \nwomen work longer hours (40 East vs. 37 West).  The vast majority of these young couples \nhas one or two children and mothers\u2019 weekly work hours are, on average, lower (15 hours \nEast, 13 hours West).   \nThe regional female employment rates converged over the decade to now be only \nslightly greater in the East L\u00e4nder at 69% as compared with the West at 66%.  Not shown is \nhow this ranged in 1999 from a low of 57% in the North Rhein-Westfalen region bordering \nFrance, to a high of 74% in Th\u00fcringen, the former East German L\u00e4nde just north of Bavaria. \nThe regional unemployment rates vary more widely, almost 17% in the East as compared with \n  18 \n11% in the West. Public childcare for the youngest children also remains more widely \navailable in the East, with an average of over 300 places for every 1,000 children younger \nthan 3, as compared with fewer than 20 such places in the West L\u00e4nder. \nThese descriptive statistics suggest that East and West German women\u2019s relative \nresources are more similar postunification than before. Women in the two regions also spend \nsimilar amounts of time in household tasks (25 per week East vs. 27 hours per week West) \nand childcare (34 hours per week in both regions). Despite the current similarity in German \nwomen\u2019s paid and unpaid labor, East German men spend over four hours more each week on \nhousehold tasks (16 East, 12 West) and two hours more on childcare (11 East, 9 West) even \nthough public care is more widely available in the East. These hour differences translate into \nEast German men reporting they contribute 39% to household tasks to West German men\u2019s \n30%, with East German fathers\u2019 share of childcare 16% versus 13% among West German \nfathers. Whether these regional differences in men\u2019s average time and share can be explained \nby the subtle differences in women\u2019s employment across the two regions, or in effect derives \nfrom differences in individual characteristics under time availability or relative resource \nmodels, is explored next. \nPredicting Husbands\u2019 Household Tasks \nTable 2 displays the main effects of women\u2019s relative resources predicting men\u2019s \nhours in and share of household tasks in the first model, those plus the contextual effect for \nbeing an East couple in the second model, and the additional interaction effects from being an \nEast couple and women\u2019s work hours and wages in the third. The R\n2\n statistics at the bottom of \nthe table highlight the insight gained from using longitudinal data to assess couples\u2019 divisions \nof household tasks:  6% of the variation in men\u2019s hours and 14% of the variation in his share \nof household tasks is accounted for by year-to-year changes in the independent variables \nwithin a given couple, suggesting substantial variation in the factors affecting the division of \ndomestic tasks occurs across the marital life course, variation that can only be captured with \nlongitudinal data. Another 15% of the variation in men\u2019s household hours and almost one \nthird of the variation in men\u2019s household share are accounted for by differences in these \nvariables across couples.  \nThat more variation is explained in men\u2019s share than his hours highlights that some \nvariables affect the division of household labor because they predict changes in women\u2019s \nhousework hours, not men\u2019s. On the one hand, both spouses\u2019 weekly work hours shift men\u2019s \nhours in domestic tasks, with each additional work hour of the wife predicting her husband \n  19 \nwill do about four more minutes per week in household tasks (60 minutes x 0.07).  On the \nother hand, the husband\u2019s employment hours decrease his predicted housework hours with the \nmagnitude of the effect almost twice that of the wife\u2019s work hours (- 0.13 vs. 0.07). Work \nhour effects on his relative share are greater and of more equal (albeit opposite) magnitude, \nsuggesting that the primary influence of couples\u2019 employment hours derives from changes in \nwomen\u2019s housework hours as has been found to be the case in several countries (Gershuny, \n2000). In this first model, the regional female employment rate is the only other independent \nvariable that proves significant in predicting both husbands\u2019 hours and share of household \ntasks, and a percentage increase in the female regional employment rate has nearly identical \neffects to an hourly increase in an individual woman\u2019s work hours. These findings concur \nwith those claiming the aggregate female employment rate shifts the division of household \ntasks beyond effects of an individual woman\u2019s employment (Breen & Cooke, 2005; Fuwa, \n2004; Hook, 2006).   \nHusbands with university degrees spend significantly fewer hours in household tasks \nthan less-educated husbands, an effect that becomes insignificant once controlling for wives\u2019 \nhours for predicting his share. This suggests that women married to men with university also \ndo fewer hours of household tasks. A wife with a university degree predicts men\u2019s share but \nnot his hours will be significantly greater (8 percentage points), again suggesting such women \nspend fewer hours in household tasks than women with less education.  Each month the \ncouple cohabited prior to marriage predicts a slight decrease in his hours but not his share, \nwhereas each percentage point increase in the regional unemployment rate predicts an \nincrease in his hours but not his share. The failure of these effects to appear as well in his \nrelative share suggest the effect of premarital cohabitation and regional unemployment on \nhousehold hours is similar for women such that the changes disappear when calculating a \nshare. As the number of children increases, a man\u2019s hours do not change but his share falls \nsignificantly, suggesting the woman does all additional household tasks associated with \nhaving children.  \nThe second model adds the indicator variable for East couples, which significantly \nimproves the fit of the model for men\u2019s hours as well as his share of household tasks. East \nmen do almost 4 more weekly hours in household tasks, representing a 12 percentage point \nincrease over West German husbands\u2019 share. The effects of each spouse\u2019s work hours remain \nthe same, as does the magnitude of university effects, although insignificant effects in the first \nmodel are now significant.  \n  20 \nContextual effects captured by the regional employment rates change. The size of the \neffect of the regional female labor force participation rate dissipates, suggesting these effects \nare stronger in East Germany where women\u2019s employment rates have historically been \ngreater. A higher unemployment rate now predicts a significant decline in husband\u2019s share of \nhousehold tasks rather than the increase in his hours predicted in the first model. This \nsuggests two things. First, that the positive effect for regional unemployment in the first \nmodel came from omitted variable bias, in that the unemployment rate is significantly higher \nin East Germany and East German men do more household tasks, so excluding the indicator \nvariable for them made these effects appear to be associated with unemployment rather than \nthe people living in the area with high unemployment. Second, regional unemployment only \naffects men\u2019s share and is now negative, suggesting that once controlling for East couples, \nwhere unemployment is high, men do not change their housework hours but women appear to \nincrease theirs. Comparing the correlation between the unemployment rate and men\u2019s and \nwomen\u2019s household hours in the two regions (results not shown), we find a slight but \ninsignificant negative association between the unemployment rate and either East or West \nGerman men\u2019s domestic hours. Only the positive correlation between the unemployment rate \nand West German women\u2019s household hours proves significant. Consequently, where the \nthreat of unemployment is higher, West German women spend more hours doing domestic \ntasks.  \nThe third model adds interaction effects with being educated in the East and women\u2019s \nwork hours and wages. The fit of the model does not improve significantly, but both \ninteraction terms are significant when predicting a husband\u2019s share but not his hours, \nsuggesting these differences work through changes in East wives\u2019 housework hours. On the \none hand, the interaction of East and women\u2019s work hours is negative and countervails most \nof the main effect of women\u2019s work hours predicting an increase in husband\u2019s share of \nhousehold tasks. As East men\u2019s hours do not increase for this term, the effect suggests \nemployed East women do not reduce their housework hours as much as do employed West \nGerman women.  On the other hand, as an East woman\u2019s wages increase, her husband is \npredicted to perform a greater share of housework, although again his actual hours do not \nshift. Controlling for the interactions, an East husband still performs a 13 percentage points \ngreater share of household tasks than a West German husband. \n  21 \nPredicting Husbands\u2019 Childcare \nAs evident from the coefficients presented in Table 3, relative resources regardless of \ncontext are poor predictors of fathers\u2019 childcare hours or share. As with the analysis of \nhousehold tasks, three models are presented including main effects, then adding contextual \nand then interaction effects, but the latter two do nothing to improve on the main effects \nmodel. Almost as much variation is explained by changes over time within couples (within R\n2\n \n= 0.21) as by differences across them (between R\n2\n = 0.28). None of the wives\u2019 resource \nvariables proves significant, although a father\u2019s work hours predict he spends less time in \nchildcare, with a commensurate drop in his share. As when predicting household tasks, \ncontrolling for work hours, German fathers with university degrees spend fewer hours in \nchildcare than fathers with less education. Additional analyses (not shown) do not find this \nstems from university-educated men having fewer children, so it would seem these men just \nspend fewer hours with the children. As a man\u2019s university degree does not predict any \ndifference in his relative share of childcare, this again suggests women married to university-\neducated men also spend fewer hours in childcare than women married to less-educated men.  \nFathers spend more time and contribute a greater share when the first child is very \nyoung as compared to when the child is 7 to 9, the maximum age of any child of these couples \nfollowed in the first decade of their marriages. Fathers\u2019 time declines slightly when the first \nchild is a toddler, whereas his share goes up slightly, suggesting mothers\u2019 childcare time \ndeclines at this stage in the child\u2019s life. These results concur with those reported in a 2000 \ncross-sectional telephone survey, concluding that fathers\u2019 share of childcare increases as the \nchildren get older (K\u00fcnzler, Reichart, & Pfister, 2001), but the increase results from mothers \nspending less time in childcare as the children age. The birth of a second child does not \nchange a father\u2019s time or share of childcare, a robust effect regardless of whether the second \nchild\u2019s age was included in the model (results not shown).  As noted in results for household \ntasks, German mothers perform any additional housework associated with having children. \nAmong the regional factors, a high unemployment rate predicts that fathers spend \nmore time in childcare and contribute a greater share. Unlike with household tasks, however, \nthis effect does not alter once including the East couple indicator variable, so it is an effect \nrobust across both regions of Germany. Neither the female employment rate nor the \navailability of public childcare alter father\u2019s time or share of childcare.  \n \n  22 \nDISCUSSION \nAn increasing body of evidence suggests the division of housework varies \nsystematically across countries, being slightly more egalitarian where political and labor \nrelations are more gender-egalitarian (Davis & Greenstein, 2004; Fuwa, 2004; Hook, 2006).  \nWe are only beginning to unravel the mechanisms by which this occurs.  Baxter (1997) argues \nit is via women\u2019s increasing access to economic resources (main effects), whereas Fuwa \n(2004) finds that greater gender empowerment increases the effect of an individual woman\u2019s \nrelative resources (interaction effects). Breen and Cooke (2005) argue that over time, a \nfundamental shift in gender relations occurs beyond the effect of individual resources when \nwomen as a group are more economically autonomous.  This societal situation eventually \nalters men\u2019s beliefs about the desirability of evolving away from separate spheres (contextual \neffects).  Therborn (1980) similarly argues material relations over time shape ideology and the \npower derived from it to fuel social revolution. Hook (2006) finds the overall female \nemployment rate increases men\u2019s domestic participation regardless of an individual woman\u2019s \nemployment, providing evidence of such a contextual effect. \nTo explore further the relationship between policy and the division of domestic labor, \nwe assessed how couples socialized within two divergent policy settings now negotiate \nhousehold tasks and childcare under the same policy structure. East German policies after \nWorld War II enhanced women\u2019s relative resources, whereas West German policies \nreinforced a woman\u2019s economic dependence on a male breadwinner.  We use longitudinal \ndata and select couples marrying between 1990 and 1995 and follow them until 2000 to test \ndirect, interaction, and contextual effects on the division of household tasks as well as \nchildcare across the two regions now reunified under the West German state. Using the \nlongitudinal data reveals that 6% of the variation in household tasks and 21% of the variation \nin childcare is accounted for by changes in the variables within couples over time, \nhighlighting the dynamic nature of the division of household labor across the marital life \ncourse. In fact, the fraction of the variance attributable to changes within a couple over time is \nlarge as or greater than the cross-country variance reported by Fuwa (2004) or Hook (2006).  \nDirect, interaction, and contextual effects all predict significant shifts in the division of \nhousehold tasks, but not necessarily an increase in husbands\u2019 actual hours. Where a factor \npredicts his greater share but no increase in his hours, this indicates the effect derives from \nwives altering their domestic hours.  This appears to be the case for paid employment hours, \nwomen\u2019s education, and the regional employment factors.  A wife\u2019s weekly work hours \nincrease husband\u2019s weekly housework hours slightly\u2014four minutes per week for each hour \n  23 \nshe is in paid employment\u2014but predict a larger share. This indicates as others have found that \nemployed women decrease their housework hours more than men increase their own to adjust \nto wives\u2019 reduced time availability for domestic tasks. East German employed wives, \nhowever, reduce their domestic hours less, as the interaction term with wives\u2019 work hours and \nbeing an East couple was also significant and negative. At the same time, the only significant \nwage effect was again among East German wives\u2019, with wives\u2019 higher wages predicting a rise \nin husbands\u2019 share, but not hours of household tasks. Together these effects suggest that West \nGerman couples with their higher average wages might be purchasing domestic services as \nwomen increase their hours in employment, a possibility feasible only among higher-wage \nEast German women.  An increasing proportion of German couples in both regions utilize \nBuelgelfrau \u2018ironing board woman\u2019 and Putzfrau \u2018cleaning woman\u2019 from Eastern Europe, \nblack-market labor paid very low wages. A similar situation occurs in the United States, \nwhere well paid women ease the domestic burden by paying lower-skilled women to clean, \nwhereas the latter group do not earn enough and so incur the greatest burden of paid and \nunpaid work. This hints that some current equality in the home is gained by leveraging class, \nethnic, or immigrant inequality, a global trend worthy of future research. \nThe regional employment context also shifts the division of household tasks. Greater \nfemale employment predicts husbands perform a greater share of household tasks, similar to \nthe effects found by Hook (2006). This supports Breen and Cooke\u2019s (2005) argument that \nwhere a greater share of women is economically more independent, men take on a greater \nshare of domestic tasks.  But here the female employment rate has no effect on men\u2019s actual \nhours, suggesting women living in regions where more women are employed do less \nhousework regardless of their actual employment hours. The combined individual, wage, and \nemployment rate effects might explain Fuwa\u2019s results that liberal regimes such as Britain and \nAustralia show stronger effects of wives\u2019 full-time employment on men\u2019s share of housework \nthan the Gender Empowerment Measure would predict.  Couples in more advanced \neconomies have access to and the ability to pay for market services such as restaurants, \nprepackaged meals, laundries, and so on, to reduce the total amount of domestic tasks to be \nnegotiated within the household.  So husbands in these liberal regimes might not be \ncontributing more hours than husbands in socialist countries, but their relative share appears \ngreater because the total household time is less as some services are being purchased from the \nmarket.  The effect of the increasing commodification of domestic tasks under advancing \nindustrialization in terms of societal and household divisions of domestic tasks, and what it \n  24 \nmeans for gender as well as other group equality as noted above, are areas not yet explored in \nthe comparative literature. \nHigher regional unemployment rates predict a less egalitarian division of domestic \ntasks, after controlling for East couples where the unemployment rate remains generally \nhigher. This contextual effect of the macroeconomic environment mirrors Brines\u2019s (1994) \nresults found at the individual level where unemployed U.S. husbands contribute a lesser \nshare of housework than employed husbands. She interprets this result as evidence of men\u2019s \n\u201cgender display\u201d reinforcing a masculine identity when not performing their normative \nmasculine economic role. The subsequent work of Bittman et al. (2003) comparing Australia \nwith the United States found the U.S. effect came from men\u2019s reduction in their housework \nhours whereas the Australia effect came from wives\u2019 increasing theirs, suggesting which \npartner in the couple does gender in this way varies in context.  To see which gender does \ngender in Germany, we compared the correlation between the unemployment rate and men\u2019s \nand women\u2019s household hours in the two regions. The only significant correlation was a \npositive one between West German women\u2019s domestic hours and the unemployment rate. \nConsequently, West German women, similar to the women in the strong male-breadwinner \ncountry of Australia, seem to display compensatory domestic behavior when the \nmacroeconomic structure threatens the traditional West German male economic role. This \nconclusion is only conjecture, however; we would gain much insight with future cross-\nnational qualitative research conducted within the home to enable clearer interpretation of \nquantitative results in context.   \nUniversity education effects contrast with those found among U.S. couples. A German \nwife with university predicts her husband\u2019s greater share of household tasks as found for the \nUnited States, but in contrast to U.S. findings, a German husband with university spends \nfewer hours and devotes a lesser share to household tasks than husbands with less education. \nThe U.S. men\u2019s university effect is often interpreted as an education effect on his ideology \n(Shelton & John, 1996), but the German results suggest that higher education does not \nnecessarily impart gender egalitarian ideals. Although university education was the historical \npurview of the male elite in many societies, U.S. women attained higher levels of education \nfar earlier than their German counterparts.  By 1880, one out of every three undergraduates in \nU.S. universities and colleges was female (Sklar, 1993), a proportion of women in university \nthat would not be reached in East or West Germany until the 1970s. Today, a greater \nproportion of all U.S. secondary school graduates go on to university than in Germany, and a \nlarger share of the youngest cohort of U.S. women as compared with men attain at least \n  25 \ntertiary education whereas in Germany, a larger share of the youngest cohort of men still does \n(OECD, 2002). Consequently, in comparative work it is important to assess what gender \nideology a country\u2019s higher education system might reinforce and not assume it is always an \negalitarian one. Future research might explore what structure of education (general education \nas in Australia, Great Britain, or the U.S. as compared with more stratified systems as in \nGermany or the Netherlands), content, or course of study, and proportion of women with \nuniversity education predict more egalitarian ideology for either women or men along with \nthe degree of equity in both paid and unpaid labor. \nOnce accounting for the various individual and regional effects, East husbands spend \nover four hours more per week in household tasks, and their share is over 13 percentage \npoints greater than West German husbands\u2019.  Clearly, then, in the decade following \nreunification, convergence in the two regions did not materialize despite the depressed labor \nmarket conditions and new challenges being faced by East German couples. These results \nhighlight that policy effects on the gendered division of paid labor fundamentally alter gender \nrelations in the home, a point argued from a bargaining perspective by Breen and Cooke \n(2005) and from an ideological perspective by Therborn (1980). Female employment and \nmen\u2019s share of domestic tasks, however, are almost as high in the United States as in East \nGermany (Fuwa, 2004, p. 757). In contrast to East Germany, U.S. policy remains basically \nsilent on the private sphere while simultaneously giving market forces perhaps the greatest \nrein of all industrialized countries. This pattern of findings suggests that policies or pure \nmarket dynamics can both lead to more egalitarian divisions of domestic tasks. Future work \nmight compare and contrast market versus state effects on encouraging greater equity.  \nWhat cannot be differentiated in the analyses here is whether convergence is occurring \nover time for the two regional populations stemming from a confluence of competing effects \nthat the selected sample does not incorporate. Here we observe only couples marrying in the \nearly 1990s and follow them for a decade, not all cohorts of couples marrying since \nreunification. As young people become socialized for more of their lives under West German \npolicies, greater convergence might be apparent in couples marrying since 2000, for example, \nthan in the prior decade. At the same time, West Germany is evolving as well. Numerous \nlegal restrictions on West German women\u2019s employment participation were eliminated \nbeginning in the late 1970s, so ideological power derived from these new material relations \nwould alter West German gender relations as it had East German under former socialist \npolicies, only later in historical time. More recent European Union gender mainstreaming \nobjectives and court decisions have also forced West German policies to move still further \n  26 \naway from a male breadwinner model and instead codify greater gender equity (Tons & \nYoung, 2001). Consequently, greater regional convergence might occur not because the \negalitarianism of East Germany wanes, but because egalitarianism in West Germany waxes. \nThe preliminary analysis of the 2002 International Social Survey Program noted earlier \nsuggests such convergence pressures from both sides; East German men report slightly more \nsupport for separate spheres in 2002 than they did in 1994, but East German women and West \nGerman men and women report more egalitarian attitudes. More waves of longitudinal data \nand cohort analyses controlling for policy changes will be needed to explore German \nconvergence patterns in more detail.  \nThe study here is also limited in that it analyzes married couples, whereas an \nincreasing proportion of young German couples choose cohabitation in lieu of marriage \n(Adler, 2004).  Most research comparing cohabiting with legally married couples finds \ndifferences in the division of domestic labor, but none to date has compared the extent to \nwhich these might be selection effects (e.g., who chooses to cohabit versus marry) or \ncontextual effects on relative power. Many state policies differentiate between de facto and de \njure couples, and even differentiate between de facto couples. For example, married and \ncohabiting couples in Australia must include their partner\u2019s income to determine benefit \nentitlement, unless they happen to be same-gender cohabiting couples.  The complex ways in \nwhich policy discriminates or reinforces family assumptions and affects relative gender power \nunder changing demographics remains a vastly under-researched area. \nAmong the German couples, contextual effects do not apply unilaterally to all \ndomestic tasks.  The second key finding here is that the division of childcare is not amenable \nto modeling with relative resource variables. Men\u2019s hours and share of childcare are highest \nwhen the first child is younger than two years of age; his hours decline a bit and his share \nincreases as children grow older. German men\u2019s hours and share in childcare are also \nappreciably less than their contribution to other domestic tasks. These findings suggest that in \nboth German regions, responsibility for children remains the purview of women.   \nWhat cannot be ascertained with these data is whether this reflects maternal \ngatekeeping among German mothers or resistance of German fathers to devoting more hours \nwith their children. Allen and Hawkins (1999) find that among U.S. dual-earner couples a \nsubstantial minority (21%) of mothers are active gatekeepers of fathers\u2019 access to the children. \nSayer also found that the U.S. gender gap in housework had closed further than the gap in \nchildcare. In 1998, women\u2019s to men\u2019s relative time in housework had shrunk to 1.4, whereas \nU.S. women retained childcare at a proportion of 2.2 (Sayer, 2005, p. 292). Using the means \n  27 \nreported in Table 1, equivalent proportions in East Germany are 1.6 for household tasks and \n3.2 for childcare, whereas in West Germany, domestic tasks remain most gendered at 2.3 for \nhousehold tasks and 4.0 for childcare.  The policy reinforcement of women\u2019s domestic \nresponsibility encouraging maternal gatekeeping appears more acute in Germany than in the \nUnited States.  Until 1977, West German women\u2019s responsibility for the home and children \nwas a legal duty.  The Mommy Politics of the East German maternal support provisions also \nreinforced women\u2019s responsibility for childcare (Ferree, 1993).  We need to explore further \nwith more suitable data policy as well as cultural differences in maternal gatekeeping, in \nconjunction with fathers\u2019 possible resistance to adopting more of the caring role.     \nFinding persistent policy effects is an exciting indication of how the state shapes \ngender relations, but the above proportions also highlight that gendered divisions persist, just \nto varying degrees. This pattern points to another limitation of the research in that policy \ncomprises just one contextual effect. Other important effects derive from organized religion or \nrural versus urban living or whether the respondent is an immigrant from another culture in \nthe host country, none of which are modeled here and can countermand even progressive \npolicy. Only when including measures of a range of institutional effects on the gendered \ndivision of labor can we more confidently assert the extent to which bargaining models or the \ngender perspective appear to explain modern gender relations. \nFinally, we should extend contextual analyses of the household division of labor to \nexplore not only sociopolitical effects on the division, but effects of varying divisions on \nother family outcomes. Some evidence indicates that Hungarian men\u2019s greater involvement in \nhousework and Swedish men\u2019s taking of parental leave both increase the likelihood a couple \nwill have a second child  (Ol\u00e1h, 2003), whereas traditional and egalitarian U.S. couples are \nboth more likely to (Torr & Short, 2004). Other evidence suggests the effect of equity on \nrelationship stability varies in context. Cooke (2006b) finds in West Germany where policy \nsupported a male breadwinner model, any movement away from gender specialization in \nterms of wives\u2019 relative earnings or husbands\u2019 relative housework increases the risk of \ndivorce. In contrast, equitable distributions of the household division of labor predicted under \nsocial exchange models prove optimal in the United States where policy remains silent on the \nprivate sphere. Much more comparative research is needed to understand better the ways in \nwhich policy and the market together shape our gender identities, and the implications of \nthese on family forms and outcomes in postindustrial societies.      \n  28 \nREFERENCES \nAdler, M.
