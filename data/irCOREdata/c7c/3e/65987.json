It is based upon a general synthesis of \npublished information relating to the large number \nof examples of these objects from western Asia and \nsoutheast Europe, as well as a detailed and contextual \nreanalysis of the somewhat overlooked Italian \u2018corpus\u2019 \nof some 60 pintaderas, in particular 17 provenanced \nexamples from the region of Puglia in southeast Italy. \nThe geographical scale of this analysis is intentionally \nbroader than that usually considered for this type of \nartefact, but is justified by the similarities (and dif-\nferences) exhibited by these objects across this large \narea, and by the need to question established regional \ninterpretative terminologies and traditions. The term \n\u2018stamp-seal\u2019 and the study of evolved glyptic art, bu-\nreaucratic sealing practices and traded commodities \nhave, in particular, overshadowed and coloured inter-\npretations of earlier prehistoric stamps, which need to \nbe reconsidered in their own right. Patterns in these \ndata are presented in the first part of the article, which \nemphasizes transformations in their form and function \nacross space and time.2 Related cultural processes of \nproduction and consumption are then discussed in the \nsecond part, with particular reference to the numerous \nexamples of clay stamps with abstract designs. \nDecorated clay stamps carrying a culturally filtered range of abstract designs are one of \nthe most visually striking but problematic categories of portable art found at Neolithic and \nCopper Age sites in western Asia and southern Europe. This article proposes a revised \naccount of their production, consumption and changing values across space and time, by \nemphasizing their biographies, human relations and cultural embeddedness. They were \nsometimes worn as amulets, but primarily designed to be hand-held printing and impressing \ntools, used to reproduce copies of powerful graphic images on the surface of other cultural \nmaterials. It is argued that their potent signatures repeatedly attached, revealed and \nreproduced significant cultural concepts and relations across different people and practices \nand across the material and supernatural worlds.\nThis article is concerned with exploring the material, \nvisual and cultural dimensions of one of the most visu-\nally striking but also enigmatic categories of artefact \nfound at Neolithic and Copper Age sites in western \nAsia and southern Europe, variously described as \nstamps, stamp-seals or \u2018pintaderas\u2019.1 Previous studies \nof these objects have tended to focus on the typo-\nlogical classification and stylistic comparison of their \ndecorative motifs, at the same time as speculating on \ntheir functional and social significance (e.g. Bucha-\nnan 1967; Collon 1990; Cornaggia Castiglioni 1956; \nCornaggia Castiglioni & Calegari 1978; Dzhanfezova \n2005; Makkay 1984; 2005). It has been suggested, for \nexample, that they were used as stamps to print or \nimpress culturally significant patterns onto a range of \nmaterials (e.g. cloth, skin, bread and clay). It has also \nbeen claimed that their repeated application to certain \nkinds of people and property could have been used \neither in socio-economic transactions, to mark iden-\ntity and ownership, or in socio-ritual performances, \nto signify and enhance spiritual potency. Adding to \nthese studies, the goal of this article is to develop a \nrevised account of these material things by exploring \ntheir various biographies, their reciprocal relations \nwith people, and their embeddedness in cultural proc-\nesses (cf. Gosden & Marshall 1999; Meskell 2005), with \nCambridge Archaeological Journal 17:2, 183\u201398     \u00a9 2007 McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research\ndoi:10.1017\/S0959774307000248     Printed in the United Kingdom.\n184\nRobin Skeates\nPatterns: Neolithic and Copper Age stamps, seals \nand sealings\nThe evolving practice of stamping spread westwards, \nfrom the Near East to southeast Europe and Italy, \nbetween the eighth and third millennia bc (Makkay \n1984).3 This diffusion channelled and filtered succes-\nsive waves of culturally significant information and \nmaterial via extended networks of communicative and \nmobile early farming communities, and contributed to \nthe construction of their social relations and distinc-\ntions. Through this process, patterns of resemblance \nand contrast were established over space and time in \nthe form and function of stamps and related objects, \nand in the identities of their owners.\nThe Near East\n\u2018Seals\u2019, characteristically engraved with recessed de-\nsigns, are found widely on prehistoric sites in the Near \nEast (e.g. Buchanan 1967; Collon 1990; Von Wickede \n1990). The earliest examples date from the late eighth \nmillennium bc, at Early Neolithic sites such as Ras \nShamra, Byblos and Bouqras in the Levant, and \u00c7atal-\nh\u00f6y\u00fck in central Turkey (e.g. Hodder 2006; Mellaart \n1964; T\u00fcrkcan 1997; 2003; 2004; 2005). At the Levan-\ntine sites they are made either of baked clay or soft \nstones, including steatite and jadeite. At \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, \non the other hand, all are of baked clay. Their fabrics \nrange from medium to fine, and sometimes contain \nmineral or organic temper. They were moderately to \nwell fired, and some were oxidized. Their surfaces, \nwhich vary in colour from red to orange, brown and \ngrey, were well finished, being either well smoothed \nor burnished. These early Near Eastern examples take \nthe form of \u2018stamp\u2019 and \u2018button\u2019 seals, with a generally \ncircular, oval, rectangular or cruciform body, a curved \nor flat face, and a conical or rounded knob-handle on \nthe back. A few have more irregular forms, including \nexamples from \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck with Z, leopard, bear, hand \nand \u2018quatrefoil\u2019 (four-leaved floral) shaped outlines. \nSome handles are perforated with suspension holes. \nThe faces exhibit simple carved, grooved or incised \nlinear-geometric and dot motifs. These include straight \nor oblique lines, zigzags, triangles, diamonds, squares, \nchevrons, concentric circles, spirals, meanders and \ndots. Such motifs sometimes echo and extend designs \nseen on other contemporary visual media, such as wall \npaintings, wall reliefs and painted ceramic bowls at \nNeolithic sites in central Turkey, although differences \ncan also be noted. They are fairly small, palm-sized, \nobjects. At \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, for example, they range from \naround two to nine centimetres long, one to six centi-\nmetres wide, and one to four centimetres high. None \nexhibit traces of pigments, and it is unclear what ma-\nterials may have been stamped by these early \u2018seals\u2019, \nalthough moveable textiles, leather, human skin and \nbread have commonly been suggested. However, it \nis unlikely that they were used on clay, since no clay \nimpressions or \u2018sealings\u2019 occur in this early period. \nDetails of breakage and wear are incompletely docu-\nmented, although, out of the nine examples found \nduring the 2003\u201304 excavations at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, four \nwere whole, one had a broken handle, one was broken \nin half, two were worn and broken along the edges, \nand another was heavily worn. Their places of deposi-\ntion vary from mundane to explicitly ritual contexts. \nAt \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, for example, they have been found \nin middens, houses and \u2018shrines\u2019, including human \nburials situated below their floors. Of the latter, two \nseals were recently found in a multiple burial. One \nof these, with a broken perforated handle, had been \nplaced between the lower jaw and upper chest of a \nrelatively well articulated body. Their function has \nbeen tentatively interpreted in terms of markers of \nownership, classification or identity.\nThe use of seals developed considerably in the \nNear East from the sixth millennium bc (e.g. Ferioli \net al. 1994). Sun-dried clay sealings with stamp-seal \nimpressions now appear. Hundreds of sealings have, \nfor example, been recovered from the Late Neolithic \n\u2018burnt village\u2019 of Tell Sabi Abyad in Syria, destroyed \nin around 6100 bc (Akkermans & Duistermaat 1997; \nDuistermaat & Schneider 1998). They were all made \nof local clay. The majority had originally been at-\ntached to small, transportable, basketry and ceramic \ncontainers. They were then detached, temporarily \nretained as receipts in one or two \u2018archive\u2019 rooms, \nand later dumped in specific refuse areas. Most dis-\nplay one or more stamp-seal impressions, distinctive \ndesigns being a naturalistic \u2018capricorn\u2019 (horned goat) \nand \u2018bucranium\u2019 (ox-skull) and geometric Z-shaped \nlines and zigzag lines combined with triangles. These \nsealings have been interpreted as simple, local, stor-\nage control devices, which defined the property of a \nperson or group, and assured restricted access to that \nproperty. Cylinder seals appeared later, at around \n3700 bc, in the early Middle Uruk period in southern \nMesopotamia and Khuzistan in southwest Iran, in a \nperiod of profound social change characterized by \nstate formation (e.g. Collon 1987; Pittman 2001). They \nare small cylinders, generally made of stone, around \nwhich the engraved design was carved. Some were \nperforated longitudinally so that they could be worn \non a string or pin. The continuous imprint produced \nby the cylinder seal, when rolled on clay balls, sealings \nor tablets, offered both more space than the stamp \nseal for the visual communication of information, and \ngreater security when rolled over the entire surface \n185\nNeolithic Stamps\nof sealings (Nissen 1977). They sometimes came to \nreplace stamp seals, as at Tepe Gawra, but elsewhere \nstamp seals continued in use, the visual rhetoric of \ntheir stamped impressions being sufficiently different \nfrom that of rolled impressions.\nThe materials, shape, size and designs of the \nevolved seals varied according to period and area. In \nMesopotamia, increasing quantities of exotic coloured \nstones were used, such as black steatite, serpentine, \nlapis lazuli, agate, carnelian, haematite and obsidian, \nalthough examples made of limestone, bone, ivory, \nfaience, glass, metal, wood and terracotta are also \nknown. New and more sophisticated motifs also ap-\npeared on seals alongside traditional linear-geometric \ndesigns, some of which were now drilled rather than \nengraved. These include stylized representations of \nanimal, human and supernatural figures, architecture \nand furniture, and scenes such as temple ritual. In ad-\ndition to being classified as stylistically varied \u2018glyptic\u2019 \nart-works, these visual images can be regarded as a \nlegible, standardized and patterned set of symbolic \nmessages, intended for various audiences in different \ncontexts. At Tepe Gawra, for example, seals and seal-\nings were concentrated in archaeological contexts with \nspecialized productive, religious and social functions, \nto which access was increasingly controlled (Roth-\nman 1994; Speiser 1935; Tobler 1950). These included \nstructures interpreted as craft workshops, temples, \nlarge public buildings, kitchens and storerooms. A few \nexamples were also deposited here in tombs, including \ntwo stamp seals worn suspended from the neck and \nwrist of the deceased. More generally, these evolved \nNear Eastern seals have been interpreted primarily \nas administrative tools, but also as items of jewellery, \nprotective amulets, votive objects and heirlooms, used \nrepeatedly to mark ownership, status, authority, au-\nthenticity, ratification, legality and protection.\nSoutheast Europe\nThe production and use of \u2018seals\u2019 first spread from the \nNear East into southeast Europe, via communicative \nand possibly colonizing early farming communities \nin Turkey, Thrace and eastern Macedonia, in the late \nseventh millennium bc, in association with the Kara-\nnovo I\u2013II, Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s and Greek Early Neolithic \ncultures (e.g. Budja 2003; Childe 1939, 18; Makkay \n1984; 2005; Perl\u00e8s 2001). Clear similarities have been \nnoted, for example, between the material, shapes \nand decorative techniques of the stamp seals found \nat Nea Nikomedeia in Greek Macedonia and earlier \nexamples from \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck (Onassoglou 1996; Rodden \n1965). Following a possible decline in their use in the \nMiddle Neolithic, an innovative new \u2018seal\u2019 tradition \nwas then established in the Late Neolithic and Copper \nAge, from the fifth millennium bc. It spread again from \nTurkey to southeast Europe, via Thrace, and especially \ninto new cultural regions, such as the Lengyel complex \nin central Europe, in association with painted pottery \nand possibly also \u2018secondary\u2019 agricultural products \n(e.g. Budja 1998; Makkay 1984). New seal forms in-\ncluded conical clay stamps with circular or oval bases, \nand clay cylinders.\nIn both phases, seals generally appear in small \nquantities, between one and four per site, although \nlarger numbers occur at a few places such as Nea \nNikomedeia, where 21 examples were recovered. The \nmajority of the 430 archaeologically surviving exam-\nples from southeast Europe catalogued by Makkay \n(1984; 2005) are made of clay, although some polished \nstone examples occur in Greece, made of rocks such as \nserpentine, steatite, marble and alabaster, while others \nmay have been made of wood. They range in size from \naround four to nine centimetres in length or diameter. \nTheir forms also vary. In Bulgaria, for example, their \nflat bases are quadrangular, elliptical, oval, round or \ncross-shaped, and their handles are cylindrical, coni-\ncal, rounded or pointed (Dzhanfezova 2003). Some of \ntheir handles are perforated with a hole. Their faces \nare characteristically decorated with deeply engraved \nand impressed lines and dots. Traces of red, yellow \nand white paint have been identified in the channels \nof four examples from the sites of Olteni-V\u00e1rmege and \nFrumu\u015fica-Cet\u0103\u0163uia in Romania. Geometric motifs \nappear exclusively. These include straight, curving \nand zigzag lines, rows of dots, triangles, rectangles, \ncrosses, chevrons, circles, spirals, meanders, labyrinth- \nor maze-like interlocking rectilinear lines, and steps. \nIn Bulgaria, there is a clear relationship between the \nshapes of the bases and the types of decoration found \non them. Round bases tend to exhibit circles, spirals \nand crosses; oval and elliptical bases have bands of \nstraight and zigzag lines; while quadrangular bases \nare mostly decorated with curvilinear patterns, includ-\ning meanders and combinations of lines and triangles. \nIt is worth noting here that, according to experiments \nundertaken by Dzhanfezova (2003, 103), the \u2018positive\u2019 \nmarks engraved on the stamps would not have been \nsignificantly different to the \u2018negative\u2019 marks made by \nthem. Some of these motifs may have been inspired by \nthe products of basketry and weaving, while similar \ndecorative motifs sometimes appear on contemporary \nceramic vessels, figurines and \u2018altars\u2019. As with decorat-\ned pottery, different combinations of these motifs led \nto a range of decorative patterns, which exhibit both \nsimilarities and differences on different geographical \nscales. At one extreme, some very similar patterns oc-\ncur right across the Balkans, including bands of zigzag \nlines and interlocking rectilinear lines forming a maze-\n186\nRobin Skeates\nlike pattern. At the other extreme, different motifs \nwere combined to such an extent at Nea Nikomedeia \nthat every stamp exhibits a different linear-geometric \npattern. In between, a number of regional distinctions \nhave been noted: between the Balkans and Anatolia, \nwith the latter characterized by more curvilinear pat-\nterns; between the northern and southern Balkans, \nwith horizontal wavy and zigzag lines, spirals and \nimpressed dots specific to the North; and between \nThessaly and the rest of Greece, with a complex design \nof interlocking meanders concentrated in the former. \nThese patterns also evolved over time. In Greece, for \nexample, a small range of geometric patterns was \nemployed in the Early Neolithic, and a range of maze-\nlike patterns then appeared in the Middle Neolithic, \nfollowed by some even more complex patterns in the \nLate Neolithic (Onassoglou 1996).\nThe use of these objects remains difficult to \ninterpret. Most were deposited in the cultural levels \nof settlements, including Star\u010devo and K\u00f6r\u00f6s culture \npits, Cucuteni or Karanovo VI house floors, a \u2018shrine\u2019 \nat Nea Nikomedeia, a \u2018hoard\u2019 at \u010coka I, and graves \nat Pilismarot-Basaharc and Sofia-Slatina. At the latter, \none was found near to the skull of a male skeleton. \nWithin these contexts they are sometimes associated \nwith special fired clay objects, including painted pot-\ntery, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels and \nfigurines, \u2018altars\u2019, pins and \u2018amulets\u2019 (Budja 2003). \nThe majority have been found as complete or only \nslightly damaged objects, although a number of worn \nexamples show traces of heavy use (Chapman 2001). \nIn the absence of any preserved artefacts with positive \nprints, it is widely agreed that they were used to deco-\nrate perishable organic materials, such as human skin, \nleather, textiles and bread. This stamped decoration \nhad the special potential of being repeated and mul-\ntiplied (or \u2018cloned\u2019): on the same and different objects, \nby members of the same and different communities, \nand by successive generations. The presence of some \nperforated examples also suggests that at least a few \nwere suspended on strings, probably to be worn and \ndisplayed about the person. The Greek stone examples \nmay also have been regarded as particularly valuable, \ncompared to their clay counterparts, because of their \nrarity, the quality of the raw material selected, and the \ncare required for their manufacture (Perl\u00e8s 2001).\nOverall, this suggests that, in southeast Europe, \n\u2018stamp seals\u2019 were used and valued in both quotid-\nian and ritual contexts as mark-making tools and as \nornaments, which carried a culturally specific range \nof familiar signs (cf. Winn 1981). More specifically, the \nvisual similarities and differences exhibited, both by \nthe decorated stamps themselves and by the things \ndecorated by them, may have been used actively to \nidentify, highlight and communicate socio-economic \nconnections and distinctions between different objects \nand people, although it is difficult to be more specific \nthan that (cf. Bailey 1993, 212; 2000; Halstead 1989, \n74). Such \u2018messages\u2019 could have been expressed in \nsymbolically-laden cultural activities, performed \nboth within settlements and between more distant \ncommunities. The stamps could also have been used \nto confer magical protection and strength on ritually \nmarked people and property, and, likewise, used as \namulets (cf. Dzhanfezova 2003; Kuncheva-Russeva \n2003). It is, however, unlikely that they were used in \na primarily economic manner to mark and identify \ntraded property, or not at least until their reintroduc-\ntion in the third millennium BC, in the Aegean Early \nBronze Age, along with bureaucratic sealing practices \nfrom the Near East (Younger 1987), although even then \ntheir socio-ritual significance may have continued.\nItaly\nThe westward spread of stamp-related ideas and prac-\ntices from Anatolia via intercommunicating groups \nin southeast Europe culminated in the adoption of \npintaderas by local communities in the Italian penin-\nsula, and in the establishment of two somewhat dis-\ntinct regional traditions (Cornaggia Castiglioni 1956; \nCornaggia Castiglioni & Calegari 1978; Graziosi 1973, \n96\u20137). Here, this process appears to have occurred after \nthe initial introduction of farming and its associated \nmaterial culture, and to have continued throughout \nthe Neolithic.\nIn the south, the oldest examples can be dated \nto the late sixth millennium bc, notably at the site of \nRendina in Basilicata, where the ceramic assemblage is \ncharacterized by evolved impressed and early painted \npottery (Cipolloni Samp\u00f2 1977\u201382, 283\u20135, fig. 78). The \nmajority of southern specimens come from the Adri-\natic coastal region of Puglia (see below). Rare outlying \nexamples have also been found, however, in Sicily, \nincluding on the Acropolis of the island of Lipari, \nin association with south Italian Serra d\u2019Alto style \npainted pottery (Bernab\u00f2 Brea & Cavalier 1956, 31, fig. \n15). A few elaborate forms and motifs, including con-\ncentric rectangles and meanders, appear exclusively in \nthe southern region. However, long-distance stylistic \nconnections can be traced between these examples, \nacross the Adriatic Sea, to the southern Balkans, and \nespecially to the central Greek region of Thessaly, \nwhere some contemporary southeast Italian painted \npottery designs may also have originated.\nIn northern Italy, pintaderas occur in larger \nnumbers. Here, they are mainly associated with \nthe Square Mouthed Pottery culture (VBQ), whose \nearliest phase also dates from the late sixth millen-\n187\nNeolithic Stamps\nFigure 1. Stamps from the Caverna delle Arene Candide, northwest Italy (after Cornaggia Castiglioni & Calegari \n1978).\n188\nRobin Skeates\nnium bc, although they continued to be used during \nthe Final Neolithic in the fourth millennium bc, \nalbeit to a lesser extent. Their distribution extends \nright across northern Italy, together with an outly-\ning example from the Marche region of east-central \nItaly. However, the largest quantities have been \nfound at the two extremes, in the Veneto region \nto the east and in Liguria to the west, especially in \nthe coastal caves of Finale, including the Caverna \ndelle Arene Candide where a total of 26 examples \nhas been recovered from the extensively excavated \nVBQ deposits (Bernab\u00f2 Brea 1946, 203\u20138; 1956, 96\u20137; \nTin\u00e9 1999, 326\u20138) (Fig. 1). The predominant northern \nform is elongated, although circular examples are \nalso present. A few cylindrical \u2018rollers\u2019, perforated \nlongitudinally, have also been found, although these \nmight be interpreted as another category of object \nsuch as beads. Further regional differences can be \nseen in the decorative motifs and patterns on various \ngeographical scales. Rows of impressed points are, \nfor example, an exclusively northern decorative ele-\nment, which predominate in Liguria, but are outnum-\nbered by linear-geometric motifs, including spirals, \nin the Veneto. Transverse bands of straight parallel \nlines and concentric linear circles are also common \nand exclusively northern motifs. Traditionally, the \norigins of these north Italian features (including the \nVBQ style) have been sought in the archaeological \ncultures of the Danube basin in eastern Europe, \nincluding the Vin\u010da culture. However, the Trieste \nKarst arguably played an equally important role in \nmediating contacts between southeast Europe and \nnorthern Italy, including the transmission of pintadera \nstyles, particularly given their presence at sites such \nas the Grotta delle Gallerie near Draga (Battaglia & \nCossiansich 1916, 31\u20133; Greif & Montagnari Kokelj \n2002). Cultural exchanges between the north and \nsouth Italian traditions should also not be ruled out \n(Bagolini 1977; Tin\u00e9 1999, 327).\nAll of the Italian pintaderas are made of fired \nclay, whose fabrics are very similar to all but the finest \nlocal Neolithic pottery. They are clearly hand-made, \nsome rather roughly, leading to slightly asymmetrical \nforms and decorative motifs. Certainly the majority \nare not as skilfully decorated as the finest contempo-\nrary ceramics. They range in size from around three \nto fifteen centimetres in length. Their flat or curved \nbases may be circular, oval, rectilinear or \u2018irregular\u2019 \nin outline. Their lug-handles vary from pointed to \ncylindrical and flattened, and just over a quarter of \nthese are perforated. Their surfaces are smoothed. The \ndecoration was usually deeply indented into the soft \nclay, using tools of varying width to impress, incise \nor groove the surface. However, in a few exceptional \ncases, the decorative surface was cut away to form \na relief pattern. When used to apply paint, excised \nstamps may be more effective than incised stamps, \nwhose grooves can clog up with paint (Cornaggia Cas-\ntiglioni & Calegari 1978, 9). More generally, the Italian \ndecorative motifs form exclusively geometric patterns. \nRelatively simple motifs include rows of dots, zigzag, \nundulating and intersecting straight lines, transverse \nand longitudinal bands of lines, lozenges, and radi-\nals; while more visually complex motifs include con-\ncentric circles and rectangles, spirals, and meanders. \nSimilar motifs occur on various styles of decorated \npottery, from different regions and periods, as well \nas on Neolithic painted cave walls and decorated \nclay figurines in Puglia. However, no exact parallels \nhave been identified, and none of these objects can be \nclaimed to have been stamped by the pintaderas, with \nthe possible exception of a sherd of pottery exhibiting \nwhat is claimed to be the imprint of a two centimetre \nwide pintadera, found on the surface at Ripalta in the \nBari province and assigned to the Neolithic (Caramuta \n2002, 68, fig. 7). Traces of coloured ochre and a white \nplaster-like substance were, however, noted on the \nface and in the holes and grooves of some examples \nfrom the Caverna delle Arene Candide (Bernab\u00f2 Brea \n1946, 119; 1956, 96\u20137).\nIn terms of their deposition contexts, the Italian \npintaderas have been found in settlement deposits, \nincluding a large circular pit on the Rocca di Rivoli \n(Pit V, which may have been deliberately filled with \nfragments of objects chosen to represent culturally sig-\nnificant activities practised in and around the house: \nDalla Riva 2004), in cave deposits, and in a few human \nburials, including an inhumation grave at the Cava \nBassa of Quinzano near Verona (e.g. Barfield 1976, \n66\u20137). Many (just over half) are fragmentary, usually \nbroken in the middle, either side of the handle, or at \nthe ends, and at the base or tip of the handle. A few \nalso display signs of wear, although whether this oc-\ncurred before or after their deposition is unclear. More \ngenerally, they are associated with material assem-\nblages that sometimes also include fired clay figurines, \nwhose ultimate origins can likewise be traced to the \nmaterial cultures of the East. \nLittle is known about the use of the Italian pin-\ntaderas. Their immediate function has been widely \ninterpreted, with reference to ethnographic analogies, \nas stamps used to decorate peoples\u2019 bodies with col-\noured painted motifs of symbolic, ritual, and perhaps \nalso protective, significance (e.g. Barfield 1971, 44; Issel \n1893, 14\u201315). Their use as textile stamps has also been \nsuggested by a few scholars, but rejected by Barfield \n(1976, 67), on the grounds that their surfaces were \ngenerally too rough to be used in this way.\n189\nNeolithic Stamps\nSoutheast Italy\nBy considering the evidence from the region of Puglia \nin more detail, some of these general patterns can be \nrefined. Here, a total of 17 pintaderas has so far been \nfound at Neolithic and Copper Age sites. 15 of these \nhave been published, albeit to varying degrees of \ndetail, while two remain unpublished but on display \nin museums (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). \nTheir fabrics can generally be classed as coarse, \nand only rarely as fine. One example from the Grotta \ndei Cervi (No. 14) also contains some visually distinc-\ntive white inclusions. Their post-firing surface colours \nare uneven and vary, on and between objects, from \nyellow to orange, brown, grey and black. The form of \ntheir bases is predominantly rectangular, either with \nstraight sides and ends, straight sides and curved \nends, or curved sides and ends, of which at least one \nof the latter could also be described as oval. The ex-\nceptional example from the Caverna dell\u2019Erba (No. \n10) can be roughly described as cruciform with two \nrounded and two splayed and slightly curved ends. \nThe bases are generally about 1.5 centimetres thick. \nThey vary in width from 1.5 to 7.2 centimetres, with \nan average of 4.3 centimetres. The intact examples vary \nin length from 5.1 to 8.7 centimetres. However, at least \none of the broken examples could have measured up \nto around 12 centimetres long (No. 1). Their handles \nare positioned centrally, and are either conical or flat-\ntened and placed transversally to the long axis of the \nbase. Only two examples of handles are whole (Nos. \n2, 14). They measure about two centimetres in length. \nThe example from the Grotta dei Cervi is also perfo-\nrated (No. 14). When intact, these pintaderas would \noriginally have weighed between around 50 and \n300 grams. They are clearly hand-made, a few quite \nroughly, which in at least one case resulted in a slightly \nuneven decorated surface. Their surfaces are, however, \nsmoothed, particularly the decorated surface.\n Decoration occurs only on the lower face of these \npintaderas, and is exclusively linear and geometric. \nEight general sets of motifs can be defined. \n1. a band of parallel straight lines, which may also \nserve as a border (Nos. 1, 9, 15);\n2. multiple parallel straight and zigzag or undulating \nlines (Nos. 8, 10, 17); \n3. a band of zigzag or undulating lines, sometimes \nforming a band of triangles or lozenges, which \nmay also serve as a longitudinal border (Nos. 1, 2, \n7, 15); \n4. interlocking angular and slightly curved lines (Nos. \n3, 4); \n5. interlocking parallel rows of repeated meander or \nstep and zigzag motifs (Nos. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16); \n6. a single S-spiral band (Nos. 10, 12); \n7. a band of repeated S-spiral motifs (Nos. 9, 11). \n8. circles (No. 2). \nThe example from the Caverna dell\u2019Erba (No. 10) \nagain stands out as exceptional, in that its decoration \ncuts across these categories, combining a single S-spi-\nral band with multiple parallel straight lines, which \ntransversely fill two opposed triangles (Cornaggia Cas-\ntiglioni 1956, 145). The decorative motifs are generally \nneatly executed, although clearly done by hand and \neye, leading to slight irregularities and asymmetries in \nmost of the patterns. The simpler linear motifs seem to \nhave been applied to the wet surface of the modelled \nclay prior to firing, sometimes leaving slight ridges of \ndisplaced clay along the sides of incised, grooved or \ngouged lines (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17). These \nlines vary in depth from shallow grooves of about 1 \nmillimetre in depth, to notably deeper incisions and \ngrooves, about 1.5 to 4 millimetres deep. However, \nmany of the more complex interlocking meander, step, \nzigzag and spiral patterns stand out in relief, and can \nbe described as excised, probably having been cut out \nwhen the clay surface was harder, but still before firing \n(Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14).\nThese examples of pintaderas come from sites \ndistributed fairly evenly throughout Puglia (Fig. 3). \nAlthough the precise form and decoration of each \nobject is uniquely different, their component motifs \nare more widely shared, both within and beyond the \nregion. Indeed, a few stylistic groupings can be identi-\nfied in different parts of the region, the most notable \nexample being the concentration of the S-spiral motif \nin the southern half of Puglia (Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12). This \nmotif also occurs in the broadly contemporary Serra \nd\u2019Alto style of pottery, both in its painted and relief \ndecoration and in the profile of its most elaborate \nrolled handles, and in the painted cave art of the \nGrotta dei Cervi at Porto Badisco and Grotta Cosma \nin the Lecce province (Graziosi 1973, 97). General \nstylistic similarities in the decorative motifs can also \nbe noted with broadly contemporary examples of \nstamps (as well as pottery and figurine decoration) \nfrom northern Italy, Basilicata (to the west), the east-\nern Adriatic, Greece and the rest of the Balkans (e.g. \nBagolini 1977; Palma di Cesnola 1966, 96). However, \nthe closest stylistic parallels are usually to be found \nwithin the region. For example, the pattern comprising \ninterlocking parallel rows of repeated step and zigzag \nmotifs, exhibited on the example from the Grotta Santa \nCroce in the Bari province (No. 6), is very similar \nto that found on examples from Greece, Serbia and \nHungary (cf. Makkay 1984), although the closest (but \nstill not precise) parallel is provided by an example \nfrom the Grotta delle Venere in the Lecce province to \nthe south (No. 16).\n190\nRobin Skeates\nTable 1.

XII.Pu15\nTable 1. (cont.) \nOn a local scale, three somewhat poorly defined \ntypes of deposition context can be identified for these \npieces. Nine or ten examples were found in cave de-\nposits (Nos. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17), which can be \nbroadly assigned to the Neolithic and Copper Age, \nand especially to the Middle Neolithic phase onwards, \nbetween the sixth and third millennia bc. The precise \nnature of these deposits is debatable: some could be \nregarded as resulting from residential occupations of \nthe caves, while others could be interpreted as result-\ning from more specialized ritual practices, such as \nmortuary or initiation rites. Only one of these exam-\nples comes from a specified stratigraphic context: this \nis one of the examples from the Grotta dei Cervi (No. \n14). This was found during Lo Porto\u2019s 1975 excavations \nin the east entrance to the cave system, in Stratum 3, \nan intact stratified deposit containing hearths, numer-\nous animal bones and much pottery, including Final \nNeolithic Serra d\u2019Alto and Diana style ceramics, which \ncan be broadly dated to around 4000 bc (Lo Porto 1976, \n638). The poorly recorded example from the Pulo di \nMolfetta (No. 5) is included in this group. In the early \ntwentieth century, it was conserved in the Museum of \nthe Episcopal Seminary of Molfetta, (although there is \nno trace of it there today). Mayer (1904, 85) suggests \nthat it comes from the Pulo (a 32 metres deep doline), \nand clearly notes that it did not come from his own \nexcavations in the adjacent Fondo Spadavecchia set-\ntlement site (contra Cornaggia Castigiloni 1956, 143). \nIt was probably found during Giovene\u2019s eighteenth-\ncentury excavations in the base of this doline, under \nthe remains of the more recent nitrate factory, since it \nis the material from this excavation that forms the core \nof the Seminary\u2019s prehistory collection. Other material \nfound by Giovene in the base of the Pulo includes the \nremains of human and animal bones, pottery vessels, \nflint artefacts, polished stone axe-blades, charcoal \nand ashes, which can be broadly assigned to a period \nbetween the Late Neolithic and Early Copper Age, \ni.e. between the mid-sixth and fourth millennia bc. \n192\nRobin Skeates\nFigure 2.

One or two examples also come \nfrom mortuary contexts. The best, but \nstill not precisely, recorded of these is \nthe example from the Final Neolithic \ncemetery site at Cala Tramontana \non the Tremiti island of San Domino \n(No. 1). Here, during Zorzi and \nPalma di Cesnola\u2019s 1958 excavations, \na group of four crouched skeletons \nwere discovered together with \u2018grave \ngoods\u2019, which included Diana style \nceramics, flint artefacts, a miniature \npolished stone axe-blade, and a frag-\nment of a large pintadera (Zorzi 1958, \n209). Another example, from Grotta \nScaloria (No. 4), may also come from \na mortuary context. It probably comes \nfrom Quagliati\u2019s 1932 excavations \nin the vast upper chamber of this \ncave system, known as Scaloria Alta or Camerone \nQuagliati, since it is housed in the Taranto Museum, \nwhere the rest of Quagliati\u2019s excavation material was \nconsigned, and is not mentioned in more recent exca-\nvation reports. The upper chamber contained stratified \ndeposits covering all phases of the Neolithic period. \nIn its Middle and Late phases, the bodies of numerous \nindividuals were deposited in this chamber, buried \naccording to primary and secondary rites, in associa-\ntion with animal bones, pottery vessels, polished and \nchipped stone tools, shell and bone ornaments, and \ncharcoal, radiocarbon dated to between around 5700 \nand 5250 bc. It is possible, but by no means certain, that \nthe pintadera comes from these mortuary deposits.\nHints of the long-term life-histories of these \nPuglian examples are provided by the nature and \nscale of their breakage, which may have occurred pri-\nor to, as well as during and after, their archaeological \ndeposition. None appear to be \u2018wasters\u2019, split apart \nduring the firing process, according to comparisons \nwith the irregular form of such fragments produced \nduring experimental firings (carried out by John \nRobb). The prehistoric examples do, however, exhibit \ndifferent degrees of breakage. Three whole or only \nslightly damaged examples come from cave deposits \n(Nos. 10, 12, 14). That from the Caverna dell\u2019Erba \nwas certainly found intact, as demonstrated by the \npublished photographs of this object (e.g. Cornaggia \nCastiglioni 1956, tav. 15.2), but now lacks the corner \nof one of its \u2018wings\u2019, which may have been broken \noff during the course of its museum care. Three \nmore are broken at one end, perpendicular to the \nlong axis, together with slight or moderate damage \nto the handle (Nos. 2, 7, 9). Two of these come from \nsettlement deposits and one from a cave. This kind of \ndamage may have resulted from their use as stamps, \nparticularly as a consequence of too much pressure \nbeing applied to one end. Five are broken more or \nless in half, also perpendicular to the long axis, and \nat the top or base of the handle (Nos. 1, 6, 8, 15, 16). \nThis kind of breakage may also have resulted from \ntheir use. They all come from caves, with the excep-\ntion of the large specimen from the cemetery of Cala \nTramontana (No. 1), which may represent an example \nof a fragment intentionally deposited as part of a \nmortuary assemblage, and even of an intentionally \nbroken and curated piece (cf. Chapman 2001). Five \nmore examples, comprising irregular-shaped middle \nportions of pintaderas, exhibit more extensive damage \nto their ends, sides and handles, which could have \nresulted from a wide range of processes, in a variety \nof contexts, extending over a wide span of time (Nos. \n3, 4, 5, 13, 17). None of these broken parts look as if \nthey originally belonged to the same object.\n194\nRobin Skeates\nProcesses: material, visual and cultural \nreproduction\nStamps made of baked clay were widespread, but \ngenerally infrequent, material elements of Neolithic \nand Copper Age cultures in the Near East, Balkans \nand Italy. They were composed of unexceptional clays, \nwhich their makers probably obtained from relatively \naccessible local sources, and then worked nearby, per-\nhaps alongside the production of other commonplace \nand more unusual clay-based products such as daub, \npottery vessels, clay tokens and ceramic figurines. \nSmall numbers were quickly modelled by hand, a \nfew quite roughly, and then smoothed. When dried to \nleather-hard, they were neatly engraved using a range \nof simple and familiar cutting tools and techniques, \nperhaps sometimes following the lines of preliminary \nmarkings. They were then converted into a solid state \nthrough firing, probably in simple hearths, ovens or \nbonfires, possibly together with other artefacts, with \nonly loosely controlled oxidizing and reducing con-\nditions, which gave them variable, matt and earthy, \nsurface colours. The general impression is, then, that \nthese baked-clay examples were made by people in \nan unspecialized \u2018domestic mode of production\u2019, with \nonly limited investment in materials, time and skills. \nHowever, other materials were also used to make \nstamps. These included more highly valued exotic, \nrare, very durable, coloured, more skilfully and labori-\nously carved, drilled and polished stones, particularly \nin Mesopotamia from the sixth millennium bc, but also \nfound occasionally as far away as Greece.\nThe engraved faces of the clay stamps exhibit a \nwide but culturally and technically constrained set of \npatterns, based upon subtle permutations of repeated \nelements. These range from simple groups of lines \nand points to more visually and cognitively challeng-\ning geometric and curvilinear shapes and combina-\ntions including spirals, meanders and interlocking \ndesigns. These were carefully organized within, and \nframed by, the outline of the stamp\u2019s face, which was \npredominantly rectilinear, but also took other regular \nshapes and even figurative forms. Like simple relief \nprints today, such designs characteristically form bold, \nclear-cut, shapes and repetitive, balanced, patterns \n(e.g. Martin 1993; Pipes 2003). They often deliver a \npowerful graphic impact, particularly where rhythmic \npatterns, figure-ground tensions and slight asym-\nmetries cause optical dynamism and ambiguity. These \nmemorable visual forms also reproduced the style of \nother stamps, transmitted and transformed across \nlong distances of time and space. Furthermore, they \nalso echo (but do not precisely reflect) the appearance \nof other contemporary, decoratively elaborated and \nculturally significant, products made of plaster, clay \nand coloured pigments. These include house and cave \nwalls, ceramic vessels, clay tokens, anthropomorphic \nfigurines and \u2018altars\u2019, all of which sometimes occur \nin the same archaeological contexts as the stamps, \nbut were not decorated by them. Similarities may \nalso have existed with archaeologically \u2018invisible\u2019 \norganic artefacts, including the products of basketry \nand weaving. (Subtle analogies with the dynamic re-\npetitive symbols, patterned sounds and movements \nof embodied performances may also have existed, \nparticularly in cases where the performers and their \nprops might have been animated by stamped deco-\nration.) These diverse elements of Neolithic material \nculture were unified by the reproduction and display \nof visually striking abstract motifs and compositions. \nAbstract images depend upon agreed social conven-\ntions to encode and express meanings about the world \nor human life. These may be clear and overt, but can \nequally be open, malleable and ambiguous. Either \nway, they have the power to attract, captivate, and \neven dazzle the eye of the beholder, and may well have \nbeen aesthetically perceived as pleasing and potent \nancestral symbols that animated the Neolithic mate-\nrial world with human-like social agency and sacred \npower (Skeates 2005, 53\u20134, 88\u20139; cf. Gell 1992). More \nexplicit, albeit stylized, figurative representations of \nanimal, human and supernatural forms, as well as \nobjects and scenes, were confined to the Near East and \nAnatolia, where they became even more standardized \nfrom the sixth millennium bc.\nIt is above all the forms of the stamps\u2019 bodies that \nset them apart as a distinctive category of artefact. The \nkey component is the flat or curving face which serves \nas the well-proportioned platform for the engravings \nthat cover it completely. The primary importance of \nthis part of the artefact may seem self-evident, but is \nemphasized both by the evolution of cylinder seals \nwhich increased the surface area that could be en-\ngraved, and by the fact that on neither artefact type \nwas the appearance of the engraved surface ever \ncompromised by perforation. The second most im-\nportant component of the artefact is the plain handle \npositioned centrally on the opposite side. \nThese features, combined with the relatively \nsmall size and light weight of the objects, indicate \nthat they were primarily designed to be hand-held \nportable artefacts. Historic and ethnographic paral-\nlels and experimental reconstructions lend weight \nto the traditional archaeological assertion that these \nobjects were primarily tools used by people as stamps, \n(although we do not know this for certain). What sets \nsuch objects apart from other hand-held artistic tools, \nsuch as brushes, gouges and sharp points (which were \n195\nNeolithic Stamps\nalso used in the Neolithic to produce similar images on \na range of media), is their ability to reproduce \u2014 sim-\nply, quickly and manually \u2014 a large number of almost \nidentical copies of an original graphic image, without \nsignificantly compromising the potency or \u2018aura\u2019 of \nthe original (Benjamin 1968). Furthermore, when \napplied to the surface of things as decoration, such \nimages would have been intrinsically functional. As \nanthropologists such as Alfred Gell have emphasized, \n\u2018Decorative patterns applied to artefacts attach people \nto things, and to the social projects those things entail\u2019 \n(Gell 1998, 74; cf. O\u2019Hanlon 1989; Rubin 1988; Schuster \n& Carpenter 1996). In other words, these powerful \ncultural symbols could have repeatedly highlighted \nsocial and cultural relationships between various cat-\negories of object and people, in the variety of mundane \nsituations and more overtly ritual performances where \nthey were displayed to audiences, and over time. \nMore specifically, they could have been used to attach, \nreveal, reinforce and reproduce a range of culturally \nand personally significant concepts: of classification, \nidentity, status, genealogy, production, ownership, \norder, authority, protection, fertility, potency, quality, \nauthenticity, morality and value. The act of stamping \nmay also have been equally significant.\nIt is less clear what kinds of things would origi-\nnally have been marked by the stamps, although it is \nsafe to assume that stamping practices would have \nvaried over space and time. Two alternative techniques \ncan be distinguished. On the one hand, stamps can be \nused to print coloured images (either monochrome or \nmulti-coloured) onto materials such as human skin, \nleather, textiles and paper. This is done by coating or \nfilling the image raised in relief or sunk in hollows with \na sticky or dry pigment, and then transferring this in \nreverse to a dry or lightly oiled recipient surface by \ndirect pressure. In Neolithic Romania and Italy, hints \nof this practice are provided by the traces of pigments \nidentified on the faces and in the grooves and holes of \na few stamps. (Scientific and experimental archaeology \ncould help us here to evaluate the residues of pigments \nand of any stamped materials left in depressions on the \nstamps.) On the other hand, stamps can also be used \nto impress their solid patterns in soft materials, such \nas clay, dough, butter and wax. In the Near East, they \nwere certainly used in this way, to mark clay sealings, \nfrom as early as the sixth millennium bc. Either way, \nthe use of stamps results in the surface of other things \nbecoming loaded with cultural meanings, in varying \ndegrees of permanence.\nOther dimensions of these mark-making tools \nare highlighted by the minority of examples found \nin all regions whose handles were perforated prior \nto their firing. These suggest that at least some were \nintended to be suspended on a string or leather thong, \nincluding from peoples\u2019 necks and wrists, to judge \nfrom their positioning in relation to a few articulated \nbodies in inhumation burials. (Again, scientific analysis \nof any wear patterns, including any on the perfora-\ntions, might tell us more.) From a strictly practical \npoint-of-view, this would have helped people carry \naround and look after these special artefacts, without \nhaving to hold them in their hands, as they engaged in \nvarious activities. However, their attachment to the hu-\nman body, particularly within symbolically significant \nmortuary deposits, also suggests that they may, at least \nsometimes, have been ascribed an added value, as care-\nfully curated, culturally meaningful, tools, intimately \nassociated with the bodies of particular individuals, \nwhich could not be left behind, even in death (cf. Char-\nv\u00e1t 1994, 13). More specifically, they might have been \nused as amulets and perhaps also as body ornaments \n(although their main decorated faces would have hung \ndownwards and hence not been immediately visible). \nIn this way, they could, like the patterns they carried, \nalso have been used as personal markers of protection, \nidentity, or other meanings, which reinforced relations \nbetween different people, their material world and the \nsupernatural. The same could apply to the large and \nperhaps intentionally fragmented example from Cala \nTramontana, one decorated half of which was placed in \na grave, the other decorated half perhaps having been \nretained in cultural circulation, possibly as a symbolic \nindication of kinship links between the living and the \nnewly-dead (cf. Chapman 2000; 2001). Values are, again, \nlikely to have been variable across space and time, with, \nfor example, the lower degree of damage seen in south-\neast Europe compared to Italy, and especially Puglia, \nperhaps broadly reflecting differing degrees of cultural \nvalue and care accorded to these objects.\nThey may have been made to last, given the \nfact that only small numbers appear to have been \nproduced at most Neolithic sites, and in relatively du-\nrable materials, and that some were intended by their \nmakers to be suspended. More specifically, they may \nhave been retained and repeatedly re-used by, and \non, the same and different people and objects, even \nover generations, becoming worn, clogged-up and \ndamaged in the process, either until their use was no \nlonger required or until they were completely broken \n(either accidentally or intentionally). They could then \nhave been discarded or more formally deposited in or \naround the variety of places where they were used, \nending up on the floors of houses, kitchens, work-\nshops, \u2018archives\u2019, storerooms and religious buildings, \nin settlement pits and refuse areas, in cave deposits, \nand in inhumation graves and in a \u2018hoard\u2019, during the \ncourse of an overlapping range of economic, social \n196\nRobin Skeates\nand ritual practices. (The fact that they were never \nrepaired, unlike fineware pots, also indicates that they \nwere replaceable, even disposable.) They then un-\ndoubtedly sustained further post-depositional dam-\nage and wear, right up to the present day. Ultimately, \nhowever, the material biographies of these tools are \nof minimal significance compared to the power of the \nsymbolic messages that they, in their own small way, \nhelped to carry and reproduce.\nConclusions\nBy emphasizing the biographies, human relations and \ncultural embeddedness of clay stamps found in west-\nern Asia and southern Europe between the eighth and \nthird millennia bc, it is possible to propose a revised \naccount of their production, values, consumption and \ntransformation across space and time. They were made \nin an unspecialized manner, using readily available \nresources. They were primarily designed to be hand-\nheld and portable printing and impressing tools. As \nsuch, they were used by people to reproduce copies \nof a powerful graphic image on the surface of other \ncultural materials: simply, quickly and repeatedly. They \nwere also sometimes used as personal amulets. Their \nengraved faces exhibit a wide but culturally filtered and \ntechnically constrained set of patterns. These culturally \nmeaningful and memorable images reproduced those \nseen on other decorated elements of material culture, \nwhich were successively transmitted and transformed \nacross long distances of time and space via extended \nnetworks of early farming communities, to whom \nthe visual expression of social and symbolic relations \nclearly mattered. Their striking abstract designs had the \npower to captivate audiences, particularly as pleasing \nand potent ancestral symbols that animated the Neo-\nlithic material world with human-like social agency \nand sacred power. More specifically, these powerful \nsignatures could have repeatedly attached, revealed \nand reproduced significant cultural concepts and rela-\ntions across different people, their material world and \nthe supernatural, during the course of the overlapping \nrange of social, economic and ritual practices where \nthey were displayed. Ultimately, what seems significant \nis not so much the archaeologically surviving artefacts, \nbut the enduring symbols that they helped people to \ngenerate.\nAcknowledgements\nI am very grateful to The British Academy for sponsoring \nthe Italian dimension of this research, John Robb for his en-\ncouragement, for his editorial comments, and for generously \nsharing the results of his manufacturing experiments, Mark \nPluciennik for lending his support, and John Chapman, \nDavid Wengrow and two thoughtful anonymous reviewers \nfor their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this article.\nRobin Skeates\nDepartment of Archaeology\n Durham University\nSouth Road\nDurham\nDH1 3LE\nUK\nEmail: robin.skeates@durham.ac.uk\nNotes\n1.
