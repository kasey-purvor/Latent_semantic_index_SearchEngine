High-multipolarity M4 and E5 transitions, which\nrepresent the first definitive observation of direct g-ray emission from the isomer, have been identified,\ntogether with other low-intensity transitions. Branching ratios for these other transitions have elucidated the\nspin dependence of the mixing between the two known Kp582 bands. The M4 and E5 g-ray decays are the\nfirst strongly K-forbidden transitions to be identified with such high multipolarities, and demonstrate a consis-\ntent extension of K-hindrance systematics, with an inhibition factor of approximately 100 per degree of K\nforbiddenness. Some unplaced transitions are also reported.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.68.031302 PACS number~s!: 23.20.Lv, 27.70.1qOne of the most remarkable isomers known in the A\n\u2019180 region of deformed atomic nuclei @1# is the second\nmetastable state of 178Hf, commonly referred to as 178Hf m2.\nThis state, which lies 2.4 MeV above the ground state of\n178Hf, has angular momentum and parity Ip5Kp5161 (K\nis the angular-momentum projection on the body-fixed sym-\nmetry axis! and a half-life of 31 yr @2\u20135#. Its four-\nquasiparticle structure is based on a broken neutron (n) pair\nand a broken proton (p) pair, each contributing Ip5Kp\n582. The exceptionally long lifetime of the isomer arises\nnot only because of its high K value and the associated hin-\ndrance caused by the K-selection rule, but also because it lies\nlower in excitation energy than any other states of spin 14 or\nhigher. This yrast trap is forced, therefore, to decay by tran-\nsitions with both high multipolarity and a large change in K.\nOn account of its long half-life and high excitation en-\nergy, the 178Hf m2 isomer has attracted considerable interest\nand experimental investigation. For example, enriched\nsamples have been studied by laser hyperfine spectroscopy\n@6#, and there is evidence that the isomer can be Coulomb\nexcited in a multistep process from the Ip5Kp501 ground\nstate @7#. A more controversial observation is the stimulated\ndecay of the isomer, induced by x rays and synchrotron ra-\ndiation, which has been reported by Collins et al. @8\u201311#, but\nrefuted by Ahmad et al. @12,13#.\nThe high-spin level structure of 178Hf has been studied\nextensively @3\u20135,14#, but basic knowledge gaps remain. Sur-\nprisingly, radiations emitted directly from the isomer itself\nare not yet well established. The problem arises, in essence,\nbecause 99.9% of the isomer decay proceeds through a\nhighly converted, 13-keV E3 transition (161\u2192132) which\nhas not so far been directly detected. The suggestion by\n*Email address: mbsmith@triumf.ca0556-2813\/2003\/68~3!\/031302~5!\/$20.00 68 0313Khoo and Lo\u0094vho\u0094iden @4# that the isomer is at 2447.4 keV,\ndeduced from its population from higher-energy states, is in\nconflict with the singles conversion-electron data of van\nKlinken et al. @5# for a 0.1%, M4 decay branch (161\n\u2192122) which implies an excitation energy of 2446.0 keV.\nAlthough the 1.4-keV difference in proposed isomer energies\nis small, it is well outside statistical uncertainties, and repre-\nsents a basic difficulty with the current understanding of the\nisomer and its decay modes.\nIn the present g-g-coincidence study, the M4 g-ray tran-\nsition has been clearly identified, confirming the interpreta-\ntion of van Klinken et al. @5#. We also establish the compet-\ning E5 g-ray transition (161\u2192112) and additional low-\nintensity transitions that had not previously been placed in\nthe 178Hf m2 decay sequence. The results extend the general\nunderstanding of high-multipolarity, K-forbidden decays, and\nshed new light on the nature of the band mixing between\nmembers of the two Kp582 bands, which are populated in\nthe isomer decay. Although the latter states are well known\nfrom in-beam g-ray spectroscopic studies @4,14#, significant\nadditional band mixing information is now obtained.\nThe radioactive source material was extracted from a tan-\ntalum target, irradiated in 1980 with an intense proton beam\nat Los Alamos National Laboratory. Hafnium isotopes were\nchemically separated @15# and shipped to SRS Technologies,\nAlabama, where a 15-kBq source of 178Hf m2 (T1\/2531 yr)\nwas prepared. On delivery for the present measurement, the\nsource also contained 172Hf (T1\/251.9 yr, in secular equilib-\nrium with its daughter 172Lu, T1\/256.7 days! with a decay\nrate approximately equal to that of 178Hf m2. The source was\nplaced at the center of the 8p spectrometer @16#, an array of\n20 Compton-suppressed n-type HPGe detectors situated at\nTRIUMF-ISAC. The absolute full-energy-peak efficiency\nwas 4% at 426 keV, and at that energy the final full width at\nhalf maximum energy resolution was 1.6 keV, after gain\u00a92003 The American Physical Society02-1\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nM.

The icosahedral ge-\nometry of the 8p spectrometer leads to minimal angular cor-\nrelation effects @17#.\nWhen searching for extremely weak decay branches,\nmany instrumental effects have to be taken into account,\nsuch as germanium x-ray escape events, peak summing, and\nscattering between detectors on opposites sides of the detec-\ntor array. As part of this investigation, copper and lead ab-\nsorbers, of thickness 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, were\nplaced ~separately! in front of the germanium detectors for\nportions of the data taking. Data were acquired over a total\nperiod of 42 days as follows: 8 days with no absorbers,\nfive days with the lead absorbers, and 29 days with the cop-\nper absorbers. Event pairs were sorted into g-g coincidence\nmatrices, with a <20-ns time-difference requirement.\nOther timing conditions were also investigated. Using the\nRADWARE @18# software package, most of the analysis was\nperformed with the data from the 29-day measurement. The\ncorresponding total coincidence spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe data taken with the lead absorbers, and without absorb-\ners, were used independently to verify some of the results,\nand to obtain optimum data where low-energy peak summing\notherwise limited the sensitivity. A major part of the data\nanalysis was concerned with the identification of previously\nunreported g-ray transitions in the complex decay scheme\nfollowing the electron-capture (e) decay of 172Lu to 172Yb\n@19#. More than 100 transitions have been newly placed in\nthis decay ~most being completely new to 172Yb) and the\ndetails of these will be the subject of a separate report.\nThe emphasis of the present work was on the identifica-\ntion and characterization ~in terms of energy and intensity! of\nlow-intensity g-ray transitions. Given the associated inherent\nlimitations in counting statistics, the energy and efficiency\ncalibrations were not themselves needed to very high accu-\nracy. These calibrations were obtained internally from the\nwell-known, intense decay transitions of 178Hf m2 @5,20# and\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nE\ng\n(keV)\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\nCo\nun\nts\n32\n6\n42\n6\n45\n4\n21\n3\/\n21\n7\n89\n\/9\n3\n57\n4\n#\n*\n*\n* *\n*\n*\n#\n53\n5\n*\n49\n5\n*\nFIG. 1.

This is not only a matter of counting\nstatistics. Of the various instrumental effects, the scattering\nbetween germanium g-ray detectors, across the 8p spec-\ntrometer, is perhaps the most serious limitation. The use of a\nmass-separated sample of 178Hf m2 could further improve the\nsensitivity. Within the obtained sensitivity limit, exotic a and\nb decays of 178Hf m2, whose possibility was discussed by\nvan Klinken et al. @5#, could not be detected, nor could any\ndirect g-ray decay into the ground-state band be identified.\nAfter exhaustive investigation of the g-ray coincidence\nrelationships, only one additional source of activity was posi-\ntively identified, close to the limit of sensitivity of the mea-\nsurement. This is a product of the natural 232Th decay series,\nnamely the decay of 208Tl to 208Pb, with (58322615)-keV\ncoincidences @21#. In addition to this, also close to the limit\nof sensitivity, the following g-ray energies were found to be\nin mutual coincidence: 154.4, 212.6, and 958.6 keV; further,\n90.7- and 868.0-keV transitions were in coincidence with\neach other and with the 154.4- and 212.6-keV transitions,\ni.e., they appear to be in parallel with the 958.6-keV transi-\ntion. While a 90.6-keV transition is well known in the e\ndecay of 172Lu @19#, the other four energies are clearly dis-\ntinct from transition energies that can reasonably be associ-\nated with the decay of 178Hf m2 and 172Hf in the present\nsource, though the 212.6-keV transition is close in energy to\nthe intense 213.4-keV transition in 178Hf. The origin of these\nfive transitions is, at present, undetermined. However, their\napparently long-lived (@1 year) parentage, and association\nwith hafnium chemical extraction, makes their origin of great\npotential interest.\nThe partial level scheme of 178Hf deduced from the\npresent work, showing only those states involved in the de-\ncay of the Kp5161 isomer ~together with the Kp582\n2 band-\nhead!, is shown in Fig. 2. Transition energies and relative\nintensities, normalized to the 326-keV transition, are summa-\nrized in Table I. The 178Hf m2 isomer was previously known\nto decay predominantly by an E3 conversion-electron tran-\nsition of energy close to 13 keV @3\u20135#, and evidence for a\nM4, 309.5-keV transition, from detection of conversion\nelectrons in singles mode, was also reported @5#. In the\npresent work, the clear observation of g rays from the direct\ndeexcitation of the isomer is reported for the first time, con-\nfirming the 309.5-keV, M4, 161\u2192122 transition and adding\nthe 587.0-keV, E5, 161\u2192112 transition. These are illus-\ntrated in Fig. 3. In addition, the low-intensity 231-, 343- and\n601-keV g-ray transitions, which link members of the two\nKp582 bands, have been observed in the decay path of\n178Hf m2. These are illustrated in Fig. 4. The latter two tran-\nsitions are known from in-beam studies @4,14#, whereas the\n231-keV E2 transition was previously reported @22# based on\nsingles counting with a 178Hf m2 source. These transitions\nhave now been definitively established in the decay of the\n31-yr isomer, from g-g coincidences.2-2\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\ng RAYS EMITTED IN THE DECAY OF 31-YR 178Hfm2 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 031302~R! ~2003!The expected 515-keV, 82\u219261 transition from the 4-s\nisomer could not be established in this work. However, with\nthe lead absorbers in front of the germanium detectors, the\nsum peak from 89- and 426-keV coincidences was highly\nattenuated, enabling a stringent limit to be placed on the\n515-keV g-ray intensity ~see Table I!.\nPart of the analysis involved searching for the 129.4-,\n210.3-, and 546.2-keV transitions, which Collins et al. @9,10#\nreported as being associated with the stimulated decay of\n178Hf m2, in the presence of a similar proportion of 172Hf. In\nthe present work, these transitions could not be found in the\ncorresponding spontaneous decay. However, transitions at\nthe nearby energies of 130.4 and 544.8 keV have been newly\nidentified as being part of the e decay of 172Lu. It is not\napparent how these might have influenced the earlier inter-\npretation @9,10#.\nIt is well known in 178Hf that two Kp582 configurations,\np$7\/2@404# ,9\/2@514#%, and n$7\/2@514# ,9\/2@624#%, mix\ntogether. ~These are also the four quasiparticles that account\nfor the structure of the Kp5161 isomer.! Earlier work\n@3# established that the 81\n2\n, 4-s isomer consists of 37~2!%\np configuration and 63~2!% n configuration. Also @3,5#\nthere is evidence that the mixing matrix element V decreases\nwith spin. Emery et al. @23# have shown that the conver-\nsion coefficients and branching ratios within the 81\n2 band can\nbe understood with the specific spin dependence VI\n5VI58exp$2b@I(I11)2K(K11)#%, with VI585159.2 keV,\nb50.001 79, and K58.\nFIG. 2. Decay scheme of 178Hf m2 deduced from the present\nwork. The arrow widths represent the relative transition intensities,\nthe unfilled parts corresponding to internal conversion. The dashed\n515-keV, 82\u219261 transition has not been established. The highly\nconverted 13-keV transition is inferred from g-ray coincidence re-\nlationships. Only the 112 member of the 82\n2 band is identified in\nthe present work, though other band members are known from pre-\nvious studies @4,14#.03130It is now possible from the observed intensity of the 231-\nkeV, 132\u2192112, E2 transition, relative to the 574-keV, E2\ntransition, to obtain an independent estimate of the mixing\nstrength between the two 82 structures. The determination of\nthe relevant g-ray intensities from the present coincidence\ndata requires knowledge of other decay branches from mem-\nbers of the 82\n2 band, and for this purpose the intensities of\nMullins et al. @14,24# have been used. ~The intraband transi-\ntions account for about 10% of the decay intensity from the\nI511 member of the 82\n2 band.! It is notable that the 231-keV\ntransition is the only stretched E2 transition established here\nbetween the two 82 bands. While, in principle, the known\nI\u2192I21 and I\u2192I interband transitions can also be used to\nquantify the band mixing, the additional complication of\nM1\/E2 admixtures, and the consequent need to quantify the\nmagnetic and electric moments, limits the utility of that ap-\nproach. Therefore, the identification of an interband I\u2192I\n22, E2 transition can be considered to be especially valu-\nable.\nApplying standard two-band-mixing formulas ~see, for\nexample, Ref. @25#! together with the specified @23# spin-\ndependent mixing matrix element, the predicted 132\u2192112,\nB(E2) ratio is 0.0054 compared with the present experimen-\ntal value of 0.0057~9!.

This disagreement pre-\nsumably results from the poor peak-to-background ratio in\nsingles counting.\nThe M4 and E5 transitions identified in the decay of\n178Hf m2 are the only known examples of such high-\nmultipolarity transitions that are strongly K forbidden. The\ntransitions go from the K516 isomer to members of a K\n58 band (DK58) and the degree of forbiddenness DK\n2l is n54 and 3, for the M4 and E5 transitions, respec-\ntively, where l is the multipole order. If K were a strictly\nconserved quantity, then the transitions would be forbidden\nby angular-momentum vector coupling rules. However, K\nmixing leads to transitions that are hindered, rather than for-\nbidden.

Although the M2\/E3 admixture is un-\nknown for the 178Hf case, the high reduced-hindrance limit is\nremarkable.\nIt is also striking that the Weisskopf hindrance factors FW\nthemselves vary over more than six orders of magnitude for\nthe 178Hf isomeric decays ~discounting the M2 limit!, while\nthe reduced-hindrance values span the relatively narrow\nTABLE II.

These high reduced-hindrance values\nfor the 178Hf m2 decay transitions contrast with transitions\nfrom some other four-quasiparticle isomers in the same mass\nregion @28#, such as the f n52 value for the E2 decay of a\nKp5161, 6-ns isomer in 182Os @29#. For the purpose of\nbuilding an understanding of K-mixing processes, it is im-\nportant to be able to establish any hindrance-factor consis-\ntency, such as for given isomer decays with competing\nbranches. The five E2 branches having f n\u20195, identified in\nthe decay of the Kp5142, 4-ms isomer in 174Hf @30#, pro-\nvide another example. Thus, the picture emerges that isomers\nin a given nuclide may have reasonably well-defined decay\npatterns, but apparently similar isomers in different nuclides\ncan have widely different reduced hindrances. This needs to\nbe the focus of models to describe K-forbidden transition\nrates.03130To summarize, the decay of 178Hf m2 has been studied by\ncoincidence g-ray spectroscopy, with a transition sensitivity\nlimit of about ten parts per million. New information on the\nstructure of two interacting Kp582 rotational bands has\nbeen interpreted using a spin-dependent matrix element. The\nreduced-hindrance values for decays directly from 178Hf m2\nshow good consistency, with f n\u2019100.\nThanks are due to H. Roberts and M.
