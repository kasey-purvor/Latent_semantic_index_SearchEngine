Introduction \nSince December 1999, the UK Government has published university performance \nindicators based on statistics such as drop-out rates from higher education institutions \n(see HEFCE 99\/66). A focus of policy and of analysis on university withdrawal rates \nreflects widespread concern with evidence of a rising drop-out rate among university \nstudents. This has occurred during a period of time in which government policy has \nsucceeded in expanding the size of the university student population in concert with \nstrategies both to shift the financial burden of study on to students and their families (see \nDearing, 1997) and yet to widen access into higher education. Both of these strategies \nhave potential impacts on the university student dropout rate.  \nTo date, most of the analysis of university attrition in the UK has been based on \nuniversity-level data (see, for example, Johnes and Taylor (1989, 1990)). Recently, \nhowever, researchers have gained access to the full set of individual student-level \ninformation stored in the Universities Statistical Records (USR),1 and have used these \ndata to analyse the issue of student withdrawal. For example, Smith and Naylor (2001a) \nanalyse the determinants of dropping out of the degree programme for students enrolling \nin the academic year 1989-1990, while Arulampalam, Naylor and Smith (2001) focus on \nmedical student withdrawal. Johnes and McNabb (2001) examine the attrition of students \nleaving university in 1993, focussing on the influence of student-course matching and of \npeer group effects.  \n In this paper, we extend the previous analyses in particular directions. First, we \nconcentrate our attention on the nature of the impact of prior qualifications on the \n                                                           \n1 The USR preceded the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) as the depository for all the statistical \nreturns from UK universities. \n 3\nindividual\u2019s probability of withdrawing from their university course. We examine the \nsensitivity of the student\u2019s drop-out probability to their relative position in class: that is, \nto their prior qualifications relative to those of fellow students on their university degree \ncourse.2 In particular, we investigate how the extent of student in-class heterogeneity with \nrespect to prior qualifications impacts on the probability of dropping out. Second, we \nanalyse the extent to which differences by gender in the probability of dropping out are \nexplained by gender differences in observed characteristics. Third, we assemble the data \nfor nine entry cohorts between 1984-85 and 1992-93 and investigate the time-series \nrobustness and trends exhibited by the estimated cross-section results. In particular, we \ndecompose changes over time in the probability of dropping out into that part explained \nby changing characteristics and that part attributable to changes in estimated coefficients. \nWe focus on the extent to which changes over time in prior qualifications have \ncontributed to changes in the dropout probability. \n The importance of prior qualifications of students as a determinant of their drop-\nout probabilities is well-established in the literature. In the extensive US literature, one of \nthe most influential theoretical explanations of student attrition is the path analysis model \nof Tinto (1975, 1987). This model suggests that the student\u2019s social and academic \nintegration into university is the major determinant of completion, and identifies a \nnumber of key influences on integration, such as the student\u2019s family background, \nprevious schooling, prior academic performance and interactions between students and \nwith faculty.  \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n \n2 Throughout, 'class' refers to fellow students on the same degree course and at the same university. \n \n 4\nFor UK university students,3 Smith and Naylor (2001a) report that the student's \nprior qualifications have statistically significant effects on both the male and female drop-\nout probabilities. Smith and Naylor (2001a) also attempt to take account of the effects of \nsubjects studied prior to university as a further dimension of academic preparedness.4 \nJohnes and McNabb (2001) find that the probability of quitting university is higher for \nstudents whose prior performance is superior to that of fellow students. This is consistent \nwith the idea that matching is an important element of completion: one could theorise that \nstudents who are much better qualified than their peers might quit in order to search for a \nbetter match. For the US, Light and Strayer (2000) find that the match between student \nability and college quality is a significant determinant of college graduation. \nAmongst other things, we are interested in examining whether the extent of \nvariation across students within a university course with respect to prior academic \nattainment is also an influence on the probability of withdrawal. One of the particular \nmotivations for our concern with this issue relates to the topical debate on policies to \nwiden access into universities in the UK. Policies for widening access \u2013 along with \npolicies more generally to increase the size of the graduate population \u2013 inevitably \ninvolve admitting more students with relatively weak levels of academic attainment prior \nto university.5  \nBroadly, one could think of two contrasting methods for widening access into the \nhigher education sector for students who have performed relatively poorly at A-level, or \n                                                           \n3 Fielding et al. (1998) identify prior educational achievements of students as a major determinant of \ncollege non-retention for the 16-19 age group. \n4 They also investigate the effect of the closeness of the match between the subject studied at university and \nthe prior subjects studied at A-level, but find relatively few significant effects.  \n5 Of course, there are reasons for which prior attainment might be a biased indicator of higher educational \nacademic potential (see, for example, Smith and Naylor (2001b)). \n \n 5\nequivalent. One policy would be based on \u2018specialisation\u2019 whereby poor-performing \ncandidates are sorted into university degree courses with low average levels of prior \nattainment. Such a policy runs counter to Government initiatives to widen access within \ninstitutions. A contrasting policy would be one which gave incentives to all institutions to \nadmit a more heterogeneous population of students. One potential danger of this policy is \nthat it might raise the overall drop-out rate if it is the case that student heterogeneity is \nitself a positive influence on student withdrawal. Research on this issue is therefore \nimportant. If it is the case that student academic diversity has an adverse effect, then this \nwill need to be recognized when setting institutional targets and publishing performance \nindicators. It would also suggest the need for appropriate support policies to accompany \npotential academic diversity. On the other hand, it is not necessarily the case that \ndiversity impacts adversely on withdrawal: this is the issue with which we are \nparticularly concerned in the current paper. \nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief \ndiscussion motivating the hypothesis that in-class variation in students\u2019 prior \nqualifications might impact on the individual\u2019s drop-out probability. In Section 3, we \ndescribe the important features of the data-set and in Section 4 we present the main \nresults of our analysis for the 1993 cohort. Section 5 presents results for earlier cohorts \nand reports on time-series patterns in the results. Section 6 closes the paper with a \ndiscussion and further remarks. \n 6\n2. In-class variation: some hypotheses \nAs we have seen, in the literature on student withdrawal it is generally accepted that prior \nqualifications have significant effects on the probability of non-completion, reflecting the \nimportance of students\u2019 academic preparedness. Both the absolute level of prior academic \nperformance and the relative academic performance of students seem to have an \ninfluence on dropout probabilities. Johnes and McNabb (2001), for example, report that \nstudents are more likely to drop out the better are their prior grades relative to those of \nother students at their university or on their degree course. This can be interpreted as a \nresult of the disutility associated with a poor university match. In the UK, students \ntypically apply for a university degree course before they obtain the pre-university \nexamination results on which any offers of a university place will be conditional. \nFurthermore, students respond to offers of places \u2013 being permitted to firmly accept only \none conditional offer \u2013 before they know their examination results. Students who perform \nbetter than they expect or who are relatively risk-averse are likely to find themselves \ncommitted to beginning a university degree course for which they are relatively over-\nqualified. They may then have an incentive to drop out of the course and seek entry to a \ncourse with a higher entry standard. One incentive for this would be to improve their \nchances in the post-university graduate labour market in which job offer probabilities are \nlikely to be a function of the reputation of the job applicant\u2019s university course. An \nimportant factor determining university reputation is the average score of students in their \npre-university public examinations. \n In our empirical analysis, we allow for the possibility that the effect of a student\u2019s \nprior performance relative to fellow students is not monotonic. We hypothesise that, \n 7\nrelative to students with average prior performance, students in the lower part of the \nperformance distribution are more likely to drop out as a result of their relatively poor \nacademic preparedness. Similarly, for students with relatively high prior grades we \nhypothesise that these students might be more likely than the average student to drop out; \nas a result of superior outside options and the associated incentive to search for a better \nuniversity\/course match. In sum, one possible hypothesis is that the relationship between \nthe withdrawal probability and the prior academic attainment ranking of students might \nbe U-shaped. We allow for this by including dummy variables to indicate the student's in-\nclass ranking with respect to their prior educational attainment. \n We also hypothesise that the degree of heterogeneity among students within a \nuniversity course is likely to influence the individual student\u2019s drop-out probability. \nFurthermore, we allow for the possibility that the influence of heterogeneity on the \nindividual's drop-out probability might itself vary according to the position of the \nindividual in the distribution of students by prior performance. We allow for this by \ninteracting the extent of in-class variation in prior qualifications with the binary indicator \nvariable for the part of the distribution from which the individual is drawn. Our specific \nhypothesis is that students in the lower part of the prior performance distribution will feel \nmore distant from the mean \u2013 and hence potentially be more at risk of failure \u2013 the \ngreater is the variation in prior performance within the university course. Thus, the \nprediction is that such students will have a greater non-completion probability the greater \nis the in-class variation in A-level scores. Conversely, the hypothesis implies that the \naverage student will feel more protected from the risk of failure the greater is the \nvariation in prior qualifications as this will ensure a longer tail of relatively poorly \n 8\nprepared students. Thus, the prediction is that students close to the centre of the \ndistribution will be less likely to drop out the greater is the variation in prior performance. \nThe same argument could apply to the students in the upper part of the distribution, but it \nis also possible that this effect is dominated by a greater propensity of such students to \ntransfer to courses to which they are more closely matched. \n We can consider the effects of in-class variation on students\u2019 drop-out \nprobabilities more formally. Suppose, for the purposes of illustration, that within a given \nuniversity course there is a uniform continuous distribution, f(x), of students by prior \nacademic attainment, x, over some interval, r , normalised such that the mean of r  is \nzero. Suppose that some proportion, say 10%, of these students withdraws from their \nuniversity course for reasons of academic failure or of expected academic failure. If \nsuccess (that is, continuation of studies into the second year) is correlated perfectly with \nprior academic attainment, then the withdrawing students will be the lowest decile of the \nprior performance distribution. If, at the other extreme, withdrawal is randomly assigned, \nthen each individual will have a 10% probability of non-completion. Between these \nextremes, we could assume that the probability of withdrawal is declining with the \nindividual\u2019s rank within the in-class prior performance distribution. Suppose that this \n\u2018conditional withdrawal probability\u2019 function is linear, as represented in Figure 1, and \nthat the probability of withdrawal is zero for the highest ranked individual ( 0=Hp ). \nGiven a range, r , equal to unity, say, the height of the uniform distribution is also equal \nto one, and the area under the linear failure-probability function is 0.1. It follows that the \nprobability of withdrawal, Lp , for the lowest ranked individual will be 0.2 and that, for \n 9\nthe median-ranked individual, the probability of failure, p , will be 0.1. The function cuts \nthe horizontal axis at the upper limit of the range as we are assuming that 0=Hp . \n Consider now what happens to the conditional probability of withdrawal if there \nis a mean-preserving reduction in the variation of the distribution, shown in Figure 1 by a \nhalving of the range of the distribution. The range is now 1\/2 and the height of the \ndistribution is 2. The area under the linear function defining the conditional probability of \nwithdrawal is still equal to 0.1. That is, ==\u2212 1.02\/)22(*5.0 HL pp 1.02\/)( =\u2212 HL pp  \nand hence the previous results that 2.0=Lp  and p  = 0.1 remain unchanged by the \nreduction in variance. The result that the conditional probabilities of non-completion are \nunaffected by the extent of heterogeneity in prior academic attainment is a consequence \nof the assumption of linearity in the relationship between prior performance and the \nprobability of failing to complete.  \n \n[Insert Figure 1 here] \n \nSuppose instead that the conditional withdrawal probability function is convex with \nweaker students disproportionately more likely to fail to complete the course, as seems \nplausible. Then it can be shown that for the median individual the probability of failing to \ncomplete the university course is decreasing in the extent of in-class variation in prior \nperformance. In the current paper, we illustrate this for a specific functional form. \n Consider the convex function xexf \u2212= \u03b1)( , where 0<\u03b1<1. Within the interval,     \n(-1\/2, 1\/2) the area under the function must be equal to 0.1, the student non-completion \nrate. The area under the function is given by \n 10\n Area = \n1\/ 2 1\/ 2 1\/ 2\n1\/ 2\n0.1xe dx e e\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u0001= \u2212 =\u0002\u0001 ,     (1) \nwhich implies the particular solution \u03b1 =\u03b1\u02c6 = 0.096. Consider now the effect of a \nreduction in the variance of prior performance among students within a given class, or \nuniversity course. Again suppose the range is halved, implying the height of the uniform \ndistribution is doubled. Assume that the area under the convex function xexf \u2212= \u03b1)(  \nremains equal to 0.1,  \n Area = \n1\/ 4 1\/ 4 1\/ 4\n1\/ 4\n0.1xe dx e e\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u0001= \u2212 =\u0002\u0001 ,     (2) \nimplying the solution \u03b1 =\u03b1\u02c6\u02c6 = 0.198. Evaluating the function xexf \u2212= \u03b1)(  at 0=x , yields \n\u03b1=)0(f . Thus, at the centre of the range, (-1\/2, 1\/2), \u03b1\u02c6)0( =f  and we infer that for the \nmedian individual the probability of non-completion is given by \u03b1\u02c6  divided by the height \nof the uniform distribution, i.e., \u03b1\u02c6=p = 0.096. Similarly, for the range, (-1\/4, 1\/4), with \nassociated height for the uniform distribution given by 2, the probability of non- \ncompletion for the median individual is given by 2\/\u02c6\u02c6\u03b1=\u2032p = 0.099. It follows that  \n1\/ 2 1\/ 2\n1\/ 4 1\/ 4\n\u02c6\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c62.06e e\ne e\n\u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u0001 \u2212\n= =\u0002\n\u2212\u0003\n \nThus, \u03b1\u02c6\u02c6  > 2\u03b1\u02c6  and hence, under the specific assumption of the convex function, \nxexf \u2212= \u03b1)( , a reduction of in-class variation raises the non-completion probability of the \nmedian individual. This formalizes the hypothesis stated above that students close to the \ncentre of the distribution will be less likely to drop out the greater is the variation in prior \nperformance. Similarly, we would expect the same to be true for students in the top \npercentiles: that is, that the greater is the variance the lower will be their likelihood of \nfailure. The opposite is likely to apply for students in the lowest percentiles of the \n 11\ndistribution by prior performance, as discussed above. Numerical simulation for the \nspecific convex functional form considered in this section corroborates these predictions.6 \n To summarise, under the assumptions specified, the model generates the \nfollowing predictions. (i) The probability of withdrawal conditional on rank performance \nwill be greater for weaker students (Hypothesis 1), (ii) the conditional withdrawal \nprobability of weaker students will be increasing with the extent of in-class heterogeneity \n(Hypothesis 2), (iii) the conditional withdrawal probability of median-ranked students \nwill be decreasing with in-class heterogeneity (Hypothesis 3), and (iv) the conditional \nwithdrawal probability of stronger students will also be decreasing in the extent of in-\nclass heterogeneity (Hypothesis 4). This last prediction, however, is likely to be offset to \nsome extent by the incentive we have identified for the relatively strong students to \nswitch to university degree courses with higher mean scores, generating Hypothesis 5, \nwhich is the converse of Hypothesis 4 and states that the conditional withdrawal \nprobability of stronger students will also be increasing in the extent of in-class \nheterogeneity. If Hypothesis 5 is correct, the relationship between conditional dropout \nprobability and in-class rank will be U-shaped if there is sufficient heterogeneity in prior \nperformance. \n \n3. The data and summary statistics \nThe data-set is based on anonymised individual Universities Student Records (USR) for \nthe full populations of undergraduate students starting a three or four-year degree course \nin a UK university between 1984\/5 and 1992\/3. The data contain information on \napproximately 714,000 students: about 79,000 per cohort. We address the issue of what \n                                                           \n6 Results are available from the authors on request. \n 12\ndetermines whether a student will drop out of their university course during their first \nyear. We focus on first-year dropouts for two reasons. First, previous analysis of student \ndrop-out behaviour both for the US (Tinto (1987, 1988)) and for the UK (Smith and \nNaylor, 2001a) shows that, typically, half of all student dropouts are first-year dropouts \nand also that the determinants of first-year dropout differ from those on later dropout. \nHence, it follows that it is appropriate to analyse first-year dropout behaviour separately, \nas in the current paper. Second, the individual student-level USR data are not available \nbeyond 1993. Smith and Naylor (2001a) restrict attention to the 1989\/90 cohort, which \ncan be followed until 1993 and hence their progression \u2013 completion, transfer, \nwithdrawal, deferral et cetera \u2013 can be observed over an appropriate time frame for \nmodelling behaviour in each year of the degree programme. In the current paper, because \nwe choose to analyse the determinants of dropout probabilities during the first year only, \nwe are able to exploit information for all those cohorts on whom we have first-year \ninformation prior to 1993. This includes all cohorts starting between 1984\/85 and \n1992\/93. The last of these cohorts would have been expected to complete their degree \nprogramme in 1995 (or 1996 in the case of students taking a four-year programme) and \nhence the analysis is for more recent cohorts than would otherwise be possible. \n \nSummary statistics \nTable 1 reports the first-year dropout probabilities and student populations by gender for \neach of the nine cohorts. For the last cohort, 1992-93 entrants, the fist year non-\ncompletion rate is 5.2% for male and 3.8% for female students. The total student \npopulation for this entry cohort is about 100,000 of which 46% is female. The table \n 13\nshows that the size of the student population grew by 48% from 1984-85, with the bulk of \nthe growth occurring after 1988-89. The 65% rise in the female population is particularly \nstriking. Despite the rapid growth in student numbers, the dropout rate for males appears \nto have increased only slightly, while that for females is largely unchanged, remaining \nconsistently below the male rate. Table 2 reports summary statistics for various sets of \nexplanatory variables. Social Class I and II refer to students from professional and \nmanagerial backgrounds. The pre-school school types show that most students went to \nstate-sector (local education authority (LEA), grammar and further education) schools, \nbut that almost one-quarter attended private fee-paying (Independent) schools. \nOur main focus concerns the effects of in-class rank on the student's dropout \nprobability. Students with at least three A-levels are ranked - on the basis of the score in \ntheir best three A-levels7- relative to other students at their university on their degree \ncourse. On the basis of this in-class ranking, students are then allocated to one of five \nrank categories according to their personal A-level score relative to the mean in-class \nscore within their university degree course. The categories are defined according to \nwhether the individual's A-level score is more or less than half a standard deviation and \nmore or less than 1.3 standard deviations (\u03c3) away from the mean score (\u00b5). This choice \nof categories generates bands of approximately equal proportions. We also experimented \nwith alternative classifications and found this choice to dominate in maximising the \nlikelihood values. The reason for the use of the five rank categories defined against the \ncriteria of the mean and the standard, rather than using a simple quantile method, arises \nfrom the clustering associated with the discrete nature of the A-level scores. Such \n                                                           \n7 We consider the best 3 A-levels as this is the basis on which places are awarded by universities. \n 14\nclustering on particular points scores means that it is not always possible to rank students \nin such a way as to define distinct quantiles by university course. \nSpecifically, A-Group 1 (A-Group 5) consists of individuals whose A-level scores \nare 1.3 or more standard deviations above (below) the mean score and A-Group 2 (A-\nGroup 4) comprises individuals between 0.5 and 1.3 standard deviations above (below) \nthe mean. A-Group 3 consists of individuals within half a standard deviation either side \nof the mean. This method of measuring relative performance is not sensitive to the \npossible phenomenon of grade inflation. This would not be the case, for example, if our \nmeasure related to the absolute difference between the individual's A-level score and the \nuniversity course mean. \n For the construction of in-class rank, a student's 'class' is based on the university \nthey attend and the subject they study. There are 56 universities and 19 broad subject \nareas, generating a total of about 1000 'classes', with an average of about 100 students per \nclass for the 1992-93 cohort. In Table 3 we report our estimates for \u03c3 and \u00b5 for 1984-85 \nand 1992-93 averaged across universities for eight aggregated subject areas. The table \nshows substantial variation in both the mean and in the standard deviation both over time \nand across subject areas. Table 4 shows the proportions of students in each of the \ncategories (A-Groups 1 through to 5), separately for males and females: these proportions \nare approximately constant over time. The table also shows the average coefficients of \nvariation. The coefficient of variation is the measure we use to capture the effects of in-\nclass heterogeneity on the dropout probability.8 \n \n                                                           \n8 Use of the coefficient of variation also ensures that our measurement of heterogeneity is independent of \n(uniform) A-level grade inflation. \n 15\n4. Results for the 1992-93 entry cohort \n We conduct a binomial logit regression analysis of the probability that an individual \nwithdraws from their university degree course during their first year of study in 1992-93. \nWe conduct separate analyses for male and female students as, from the summary \nstatistics discussed above, it appears that male and female drop-out behaviour is rather \ndifferent. Indeed, a likelihood ratio test on the equality of the estimated coefficients from \nour separate models for males and females is rejected (p-value = 0.00). \nIn the logit regression analysis, dummy variables are included for A-Groups 1, 2, \n4 and 5 so that the default case is that of an individual with three A-levels and in the \nmiddle of the distribution of A-level scores within their university degree course.9 On the \nbasis of the discussion in section 2 of the paper, Hypothesis 1 predicts that the dropout \nprobability is likely to be negatively related to the student\u2019s in-class rank group, with the \nweakest students (that is, those in A-Group 5) most likely to dropout. The regression \nequation also includes interactions between the A-Group dummy variables and the \ncoefficient of variation for the in-class distribution of A-level scores.10 The interaction \nterms are included in order to test Hypotheses 2 through 5, that the individual's dropout \nprobability varies with the extent of in-class heterogeneity in a way which itself depends \non the student's in-class rank, as measured by the A-Group categories.  \nFor students whose prior qualifications are not A-levels, dummy variables are \nincluded for particular types of alternative qualifications. For students who took Scottish \nHigher qualifications prior to university, dummy variables analogous to the A-Group \n                                                           \n9 Dummy variables are included in the analysis to pick up the effects of having fewer than 3 A-levels. \n10 In the construction of the interactive dummy variables, A-Groups 1 and 2 are aggregated, as are A-\nGroups 4 and 5. \n \n 16\nvariables are included for students with at least 5 Highers and studying at a Scottish \nuniversity. The in-class coefficient of variation for these students is also included, but not \nthe interaction between this and any measure of the student's rank position. Because of \nsmall cell sizes, we have not computed the in-class rank positions of Scottish students \nstudying outside Scotland, but rather include a simple dummy variable for these students. \nFinally, in the light of evidence of a significant effect of prior Mathematics on student \nperformance (see Smith and Naylor 2001a, 2001b) a dummy variable is included to \nindicate whether the student had obtained an A-level (or Higher) in Mathematics.  \nLogit estimates of the probability of dropping out are presented in Table 5, \nseparately for male and female students.11 The equation includes controls for educational \nbackground, personal characteristics, degree subject and related attributes, and university \nattended. For male students, the probability of dropping out of university tends to be \nincreasing in age whereas for women the dropout probability is lowest for students in the \nhighest age category. The effect of fees status also varies by sex, with non-UK fee paying \nmales less likely to drop out than other male students but with no significant effects of \nfees status for women. The effects of accommodation type are similar for men and \nwomen. Relative to a student living on campus, the dropout probability is higher for \nstudents living either at the parental home or otherwise off-campus. This is consistent \nwith Tinto's emphasis on the importance of social integration.  \nStudents with part-time status do not differ from full-time students in their ceteris \nparibus dropout probability. However, the student's social class background has a \nsignificant effect - for both male and female students - with a significantly lower \n                                                           \n11 Note that the definition of the student's in-class rank is not gender-specific. \n \n 17\nprobability of dropping out for students from Social Class I and II parental occupation \n(that is, professional and managerial) backgrounds. School background has significant \neffects only for male students, with a higher dropout probability for students who had \npreviously attended a private Independent school. In general, these results are in line with \nthose of Smith and Naylor (2001a, 2001b), \nTable 5 also reports results for the effects on the dropout probability associated \nwith the individual's performance at A-level as measured by (i) the dummy variables \nindicating the student's in-class rank, (ii) the dummy variables interacting the rank \ncategories with the in-class coefficient of variation, and (iii) the dummy variable for \nMathematics A-level.12  \nWith respect to the effects of the dummy variables indicating the student's in-class \nrank, we see that the majority of the estimated coefficients are significant. The same is \ntrue for the estimated coefficients on the interactive dummy variables indicating the \neffects of heterogeneity and how these vary across the different segments of the prior \nperformance distribution. Because of the presence of the interaction terms in the \nregression equation, we cannot interpret the estimated coefficients on the dummy \nvariables indicating in-class rank in isolation. In order to assess the importance of the \nestimated prior qualification effects, we have calculated the predicted dropout \nprobabilities for each of the A-Groups for different values of the coefficient of variation.  \nFigures 2 and 3 present the plots of the predicted probabilities against the \ncoefficient of variation for the rank groups A-Group 1 through 5, for men and women \nrespectively. The vertical line at 0.2 indicates the mean value for the coefficient of \n                                                           \n12 Results for students who had taken alternative qualifications - not reported for reasons of space - are \navailable from the authors on request. \n 18\nvariation (see Table 4). At this mean value, the predicted probabilities of dropping out for \nthe five A-Groups are broadly consistent with Hypothesis 1, which predicts that the \ndropout probability will vary systematically according to the individual's in-class rank, as \ndiscussed above.  \nSpecifically, we observe from Figure 2 that, for male students, the predicted \ndropout probabilities are monotonically related to the in-class rank groups: with the \nhighest-ranked students (A-Group 1) the least likely to dropout, ceteris paribus. The \npredicted dropout probability for A-Group 1 is 2% and for A-Groups 2-5 is 2.5%, 3.5%, \n4.2%, 5.7%, respectively. The results, then, are consistent with Hypothesis 1 and with the \nconventional wisdom in the literature that relative academic preparedness - as indicated \nby prior performance - is an important determinant of the likelihood of dropping out of \ncollege.  \nFor female students, the picture in Figure 3 is only slightly different. At the mean \nvalue of the coefficient of variation, the lowest-ranked students (A-Group 5) have the \nhighest predicted dropout probability of 3.5%. The next lowest ranked students (A-Group \n4) have the next highest predicted probability of 2.8% and the middle group (A-Group 3) \nhave a still lower predicted probability of 2%, as predicted under Hypothesis 1. However, \nthe predicted probabilities for the higher-ranked students in A-Groups 1 and 2 do not \nconform to a monotonic pattern, as was the case for males. Instead, for female students, \nthe predicted dropout probability for A-Group 2 is 2% - the same as that for the middle \ngroup - and the predicted probability for the highest-ranked students (A-Group 1) is a \nlittle higher at 2.4%, giving a U-shaped relationship between the dropout probability and \nin-class rank. A possible explanation for the behaviour of the higher-ranked female \n 19\nstudents is that these students will have better outside options and may have incentives to \nleave in order to make a better university course match. We also note from Figures 2 and \n3 that there is much less dispersion in the predicted probabilities across the rank groups in \nthe case of women. \nHypotheses 2 through 5 predict that the individual's dropout probability varies \nwith the extent of in-class heterogeneity. This is supported by the fact that interactions \nbetween the A-Group dummies and the in-class coefficient of variation are typically \nsignificant. More specifically, these hypotheses predict that the effects of heterogeneity \nwill vary with the student's in-class rank, as measured by the A-Group categories. \nHypothesis 2 suggests that a greater coefficient of variation will raise the probability that \nthe weaker students will fail to complete their studies successfully. From Figure 2, this is \nconsistent with the estimated effects for males, for whom the predicted probabilities \nincrease with the coefficient of variation in the case of the relatively weak students in A-\nGroups 4 and 5. Similarly, the results for males ranked close to the center of the \ndistribution (in A-Group 3) are consistent with the prediction that these students will be \nless likely to drop out the greater is the degree of in-class heterogeneity. This is consistent \nwith Hypothesis 3. However, contrary to the prediction of Hypothesis 4 - that relatively \nwell qualified students will also be less likely to drop out the greater is the coefficient of \nvariation - the results suggest the opposite. That is, the predicted probability rises with the \ndegree of heterogeneity for these students. Our interpretation of this result is that the risk \nof failure for these students is anyway so low that such considerations \u2013 which form the \nbasis for the analysis described in section 2 \u2013 are dominated by other factors. The result is \nconsistent with Hypothesis 5, that strong students have an incentive to switch university \n 20\ndegree course if they find themselves on a course for which they are relatively over-\nqualified. \nIn the case of female students, Figure 3 shows that, as for males and consistent \nwith Hypothesis 3, the predicted probability of dropping out falls for students in A-Group \n3 \u2013 those ranked close to the centre of the in-class distribution by prior performance at A-\nlevel. Contrary to Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 4, however, the predicted probabilities \nfor the weaker students (in A-Groups 4 and 5) fall as the degree of heterogeneity \nincreases while those for the stronger students (in A-Groups 1 and 2) rise with the extent \nof heterogeneity, as was the case for males. The behaviour of the stronger students may \nbe explicable in terms of the incentive to switch to university degree courses with higher \naverage A-level scores, as predicted by Hypothesis 5. The reasons behind the observed \nbehaviour of the weaker female students are less obvious. \nFinally, we also note from Table 5 that having Mathematics A-level significantly \nreduces the dropout probability for both male and female students. In preliminary \nanalysis, we have also investigated possible effects associated with the extent of the \nindividuals\u2019 integration into the socio-academic life of the university department but \nfound no significant effects. \n \n5. Earlier cohorts and time-series evidence \nThe analysis reported in the previous section for 1992-93 was replicated on data for the \npreceding eight cohorts. Results for 1984-85 are presented in Table 5 and can be \ncompared directly with the results for 1993-93. In terms of the key variables relating to \nthe effects of prior qualifications, Figures 4 and 5 present the predicted dropout \n 21\nprobabilities against entry year for particular values of the coefficient of variation, in the \nrange (0.1, 0.4) for a median male and a median female student, respectively. The results \nare very robust, with the dropout probability falling as the coefficient of variation \nincreases. \nThe estimated effects associated with the other sets of explanatory variables are \nalso reasonably robust over time. For males, the effects of attendance at an Independent \nschool, off-campus accommodation and of part-time status are typically positive and \nsignificant across the cohorts. In addition, there is generally a higher dropout probability \nfor male students aged 21 or above. Conversely, having a Mathematics A-level has a \nconsistently significant and negative effect, as does non-UK fees status and having \nparents from a Social Class I or II background. For females, the same results obtain with \nrespect to the social class, part-time status, Mathematics and accommodation variables. \n On the basis of the results for the both the 1984-85 and the 1992-93 cohorts, we \nhave decomposed the differences \u2013 both by gender and over time \u2013 in the predicted \ndropout probabilities into that part explained by differences in characteristics and that \npart attributable to differences in estimated coefficients. Table 6 presents the results of \nthis Oaxaca decomposition. Consider first the decomposition of the gender differences \nfor 1992-93 cohort. The table shows that the predicted probability of dropping out was \n3.80% for females and 5.22% for males. If females are attributed male characteristics, the \npredicted probability is a little higher at 3.98% and if males are attributed female \ncharacteristics the dropout probability falls slightly - to 4.89%. Hence, the gender \ndifference in the dropout rate in 1992-93 is not explained by differences in observed \ncharacteristics by gender: the difference is attributable to differences in estimated \n 22\ncoefficients. The same picture emerges from a gender composition based on the 1984-85 \ncohort. \nConsider now the decomposition over time. For males, the results presented in \nTable 6 suggest that the reason for the rise in the predicted dropout probability from \n1984-85 to 1992-93 was attributable to a deterioration in characteristics. For example, if \n1984-85 males are assigned 1992-93 male characteristics, the predicted probability of \ndropping out increases from 4.93% to 5.52%, compared to 5.22% for 1992-93 males with \ntheir actual characteristics and estimated coefficients. Thus, changing coefficients acted \nto reduce the predicted male dropout probability over the period, but not sufficiently to \nfully offset the deterioration in characterisitcs. The reverse is true for females: if 1984-85 \nfemales are assigned 1992-93 female characteristics, the predicted probability of \ndropping out increases from 4.09% to 4.66%, compared to 3.80% for 1992-93 females \nwith their actual characteristics and estimated coefficients \u2013 hence the effect of a \ndeterioration in characteristics is more than offset by changed coefficients. \n \n6. Conclusions \nWe have examined the first-year undergraduate university dropout behaviour of \nUK university students from administrative data for full entry cohorts between 1984-85 \nand 1992-93. We have focused on the impact of prior qualifications and on differences by \ngender and over time. With respect to prior qualifications, our theoretical framework \ngenerated a number of testable hypotheses.  \nFirst, we tested the hypothesis that the probability of dropping out is greatest for \nstudents with relatively poor levels of prior attainment. Our method for doing this is to \n 23\nrank each individual in each university and in each degree course on the basis of their \nperformance at A-level relative to their fellow students. Each student is then assigned to \none of five groups according to this rank. Our results show that, for male students, the \npredicted probability of dropping out is related monotonically to the in-class rank group \nto which the individual belongs, with the weaker students more likely to drop out, as \npredicted. For females, the results are the similar, with the exception that the very \nstrongest students are more likely to drop out than are those with close to the mean. One \npossible explanation for this is that the strongest students are likely to have better outside \noptions. In particular, they are more able to switch to a university degree course with \nhigher average levels of prior attainment, which may enhance their labour market \nprospects. \nSecond, we have found that the dropout probability is significantly affected by the \ndegree of in-class heterogeneity of students with respect to levels of prior attainment. \nThird, and in particular, we have found that \u2013 for both male and female students \u2013 the \nprobability of dropping out of a degree course is decreasing in the extent of heterogeneity \nfor students close to the center of the in-class distribution by prior attainment. This is \nconsistent with the predictions arising from the theoretical framework set out in the \npaper. Intuitively, the greater is the extent of in-class variation by prior performance, the \nless at risk of failure are the students close to the mean, for any given failure rate. The \nsame intuition lies behind the converse prediction that the dropout probability is \nincreasing in the extent of in-class heterogeneity for relatively weak students. This \nprediction is consistent with the data on male students, but not supported by the evidence \nfor female students. Finally, the evidence suggests that for the stronger students the \n 24\nprobability of dropping out is rising in the extent of in-class heterogeneity. This is \nconsistent with the view that the over-riding effect of increasing heterogeneity for these \nstudents is to increase their incentives to switch to a university degree course with a \nhigher prior-qualification average score. \n We have also examined the extent to which differences in the predicted dropout \nprobabilities by gender and over time are attributable to differences in characteristics \nrather than to differences in estimated coefficients. Our results imply that differences by \ngender are explained largely by differences in coefficients. We also show that the \nchanges in predicted probabilities over time are attributable to deteriorating \ncharacterisitcs being only partially offset by changed coefficients in the case of males but \nbeing more than offset in the case of females.  \n In terms of government policy to widen participation in higher education in the \nUK, our results indicate that admissions policies which increase heterogeneity within \nuniversity degree courses run the risk of raising the dropout rate. For male students, for \nexample, a higher coefficient of variation raises the dropout rate of all students but those \nclose to the mean. For female students, the effect is less clear: a rise in the coefficient of \nvariation raises the dropout rate of the higher ranked students in the university course-\nspecific distribution, but lowers the dropout rates of the rest. We conclude that policies \naimed at widening participation not through specialisation but through encouraging \nincreased heterogeneity within university courses should be complemented with \nappropriate strategies \u2013 educative, social, financial and pastoral \u2013 to minimise the risk \nthat the dropout will rise as a result. \nAcknowledgement: We acknowledge both the USR, as the original depositors, and the UK Data Archive for \nthe use of the data-set SN:3456 Universities' Statistical Record.
