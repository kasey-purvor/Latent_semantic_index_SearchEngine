We explore market\nsegmentation in the services and product-service systems context through twenty-five\ninterviews in five UK-based companies, highlighting practical considerations in\nimplementing market segmentation programs (see Young, Ott and Feigin, 1978, for a similar\nearly approach). Within this case set, market segmentation, using a variety of segmentation\nbases, is still regarded as essential for customer selection, proposition development and mass\ncommunication. Addressable and interactive communications with individual customers,\nthough, are increasingly based on individualised customer analytics and propensity\nmodeling, which aid the determination of the likelihood of uptake of specific propositions.\nEvents and triggers informing companies of how to deal with customers individually are\nalso considered to be particularly effective rather than simple allocation of the customer to a\nparticular characteristic segment. Implications for theory and practice in market\nsegmentation are outlined and further research is called for to explore this important area\nfurther.\nIntroduction\nAlthough the process of generating market segments has been much studied, what\nsegmentation is actually used for has received relatively limited attention until recently\n(Yankelovich and Meer, 2006). This seems surprising given the common speculations\nthat the role of segmentation is changing due to CRM practices and the wider range of\nanalyses which they enable (Dibb, 2001). The question arises as to what extent one-to-\none techniques such as propensity modeling (which predicts the likelihood of an\nindividual customer acting in a certain way, such as responding positively to an offer)\nmight cast doubt on the ethos and need for segmentation, as it could be argued that they\nperform the same purpose of treating different customers differently but with more\ngranularity (Dibb, 2001; Kumar et al., 2006). However, others argue that the reason for\nCRM\u2019s failure is that it should be based on \u201cgood old-fashioned segmentation analysis\u201d\n(Rigby et al. 2002).\nWhile there are differences in perceptions of the role of segmentation in a marketing\nenvironment which includes CRM, there is at least some consensus that customer insight is a\nkey resource required to achieve effective CRM, although segmentation\u2019s contribution to\nthis insight is still unclear. Customer insight as a term has come into vogue in both academic\nand practitioner discourse (Hirschowitz, 2001; Wills and Williams, 2004; Smith, Wilson,\nand Clark, 2006b; Wills and Webb, 2007) to reflect the multiple informational sources in\nexistence about customers, ranging from market research to transactional data-mining, as\n2well as data from marketplace experimentation and third-party sources (Slater and Narver\n2000). The few empirical studies reviewing customer insight in practice (Wills and\nWilliams, 2004; Wills and Webb, 2007; Smith, Wilson, and Clark, 2006a) concur that\ncustomer insight arises from \u2018multiple data sources\u2019, yet there is a paucity of evidence on the\nforms of insight that companies are generating and from where (Forsyth, Galante, and Guild,\n2006; Langford and Schulz, 2006). Hirschowitz (2001) regards segmentation as a subset of\ncustomer insight, citing such segmentation bases as socio-demographic, geo-demographic\nand value-based as customer insight examples. But is customer insight just a new name for\nmarket segmentation or does it encompass separate sets of activities and processes?\nIn this study, we take the view that the debate on such questions is under-informed by an\nadequate understanding of current segmentation practice, and in particular of the role of\nsegmentation within the wider process of actioning customer insight (Sinkula et al.,\n1997). We consider the question of whether or not market segmentation has been\nsuperseded by other forms of customer insight, and the problem of how companies use or\naction market segmentation programmes. In particular, we seek to explore the following\nresearch questions:\nRQ1: Have market segmentation processes been superseded by distinct customer insight\nprocesses?\nRQ2: How do contemporary companies define their segments?\nRQ3: How is segmentation being implemented or (as we prefer to refer to it) actioned?\nWe focus specifically on services companies, and on companies offering integrated\ncombinations of products and services, as this context provides direct, rich relationships\nbetween the firm and its customers in which the potential, at least, exists for both\nindividualised customer insight and individualised treatment of the customer based on\nthat insight; thereby considering the challenge to segmentation thinking based on the\nnotion of groups of customers posed by CRM scholars to the test.\nLiterature Review\nWendell Smith (1956) first proposed market segmentation as an alternative market\ndevelopment technique to product differentiation in imperfectly competitive markets. Since\nfew markets correspond with an idealized perfect market, and as market-oriented companies\ntend to be more profitable because they define products from the perspective of the customer\nrather than their own needs (Wong and Saunders, 1993; Day, 1994), the rationale for market\nsegmentation seems self-evident. However, to date the literature on market segmentation has\nfocused quite narrowly around what segmentation bases to use, particularly advocating\ncustomer characteristics (Foote, 1969), product attributes (Botschen, Thelen, and Pieters,\n1997), benefits sought (Haley, 1968), service qualities (Gronroos, 1998), values (Claeys,\nSwinnen, and Van den Abeele, 1995), and buying behaviour (McDonald and Dunbar, 2005).\nSuch bases are particularly skewed towards the consumer marketing field, with a more\nlimited treatment in the business to business literature (Verhallen, Frambach and Prabhu,\n1998; Smith, 2002), where implementation problems are equally paramount and less well-\nconsidered (Dibb and Simkin, 1994; Palmer and Millier, 2004; Laiderman, 2005). From the\nservices marketing field, segmentation has been suggested on the basis of customers\u2019\n3propensity to switch suppliers: Payne and Frow (1999), for example, argue for four\nsegments of customers who definitely will not switch, probably will not switch, might\nswitch, and definitely will switch. The main reasons identified when switching behaviour\ndoes actually occur include pricing, inconvenience, core service and service encounter\nfailures (so-called \u2018critical incidents\u2019), competition, ethical problems, and involuntary\nswitching (Keaveney, 1995). Nevertheless, service-based customers can and do frequently\nstay with a service provider despite their dissatisfaction (Kelley, Hoffman and Davis, 1993).\nRecently, the ethos and need for segmentation has been cast into doubt, as it juxtaposes with\nrelationship marketing, where individualization rather than grouping customers is key\n(Coviello et al., 2002). In theory, it has been argued, firms with a direct relationship with\ntheir customers \u2013 as is typically the case in service industries in particular - should be able to\nuse CRM technology to identify the \u2018right\u2019 future customers, understand their needs, predict\ntheir behaviour, develop tailored propositions and have more relevant conversations with\nthem, all at finer levels of granularity than has previously been possible (Payne and Frow,\n2005). However, numerous research studies (Rigby, Reichheld, and Schefter, 2002; Wilson,\nDaniel, and McDonald, 2002; Kale and Sudhir, 2004; Boulding et al, 2005) have found that\nCRM projects have often failed to deliver the expected benefits. Counter to the previous\nargument that CRM replaces segmentation with the segment-of-one, Rigby et al (2002)\nliken implementing CRM without segmentation to \u201ctrying to build a house without\nengineering measures or an architectural plan\u201d.\nCommon to these different views, though, is the assumption that in services contexts, CRM\ntechnology can enable more appropriate customer conversations in which different\ncustomers are treated differently. When ten leading services scholars were questioned on the\ndirection that services marketing research should take in the future (Grove, Fisk, & John,\n2003, p. 116), nearly every panel member challenged scholars to \u201cchart new territory\u201d and\nexamine the impact of technology on services. This addressed Bitner et al\u2019s (2000) concern\nthat the growing role of technology in service encounters has been largely ignored and that\nvirtually all of the service research has instead explored the interpersonal dynamics of the\nencounter. A number of authors (Chase & Hayes, 1991; Kelley, 1993; Evans, Arnold, &\nGrant, 1999; Spencer-Matthews & Lawley, 2006) have suggested that technology-enabled\nservice encounters have the potential to provide a direct financial benefit (Evans et al., 1999;\nSpencer-Matthews & Lawley, 2006). They propose that if agents manage to initiate\nconversations that uncover customer needs, this could lead to cross-selling (selling new\nproducts), up-selling (selling upgrades of existing products), and specific offers that enhance\ncustomer retention. In support of this contention, Beatty et al. (1996) report that investing\nthe time to investigate customer needs may indeed improve both service and sales\nperformance. Cross-selling is attractive to firms because it usually costs less than acquiring\nnew customers (Reichheld & Sasser Jr, 1990). In addition, the more products and services a\ncustomer holds, the more likely they are to develop a more durable relationship with the\nfirm, the less likely they are to consider switching to another provider, and the stronger their\nprofitable lifetime duration (Beatty et al., 1996; Ansell, Harrison, & Archibald, 2007).\nThis link between sales and service was proposed nearly two decades ago, with Zeithaml et\nal. (1988) demonstrating that offers made during service encounters - if underpinned by the\ndelivery of good customer service - can help companies to attract new customers and\n4develop existing ones. Combining sales and service roles extends services operations into\nthe marketing domain (Evans et al., 1999), and indeed practitioners are now frequently\nreferring to this concept of sales through service as \u2018inbound marketing\u2019. The popular press\nsuggests that the growing trend towards such inbound marketing is caused by increased\nrestrictions imposed by data privacy and communications legislation, combined with claims\nof higher conversion rates on offers made on inbound calls as compared with outbound\ncontact by telephone, mail or email. Gartner Group (2006) suggests that companies can\nexpect 10\u201320 times the response rate on analytical inbound marketing compared to\ntraditional marketing and Doyle (2005) hypothesised that response rates are commonly in\nthe 20-30 percent range. However, according to Eichfeld et al (2006, p.1), \u201ccompanies have\nfailed to tap the full revenue potential of their call centres because they just don\u2019t understand\nthe extent of the opportunity\u201d.\nOne issue holding back the adoption of sales through service, according to Maister (1997), is\nthat the accurate picture of customer needs that it requires can only be achieved through\nintensive customer-employee interaction. With advances in the generation of customer\ninsight, though, technology is now enabling contact employees to handle service situations\nwith a complexity that could never be managed manually (Bitner et al., 2000). Advances in\ntechnology have also fuelled a growth in the popularity of customisation strategies aimed at\nproviding customers with individually tailored products and services (Gwinner, Bitner,\nBrown, & Kumar, 2005), and \u2018real-time marketing\u2019 strategies (Oliver, Rust, & Varki, 1998)\nare now being deployed in customer service centres. What place this real-time,\nindividualised world of service leaves for segmentation, though, is left unexplored.\nIn summary, segmentation research has focused around choosing segmentation bases, as\nopposed to how a segmentation programme is used once generated - with some notable\nexceptions (Dibb and Simkin, 1997; Dibb and Wensley, 2002; Dibb, 2005; Laiderman,\n2005) which include how segments may be used in the marketing planning process to\n(in)form propositions (McDonald and Dunbar, 2005). There are few prescriptions on how\nsegments can be used in individual customer interactions, and evidence on what actually\nworks in practice is very limited indeed (Wind, 1978; Wedel and Kamakura, 2002;\nPalmer and Millier, 2003; Laiderman, 2005). The limited understanding of the role of\nmarket segmentation in practice is keenly felt by practitioners, who bewail the lack of\nguidance on actionable segmentation models (Marketing Leadership Council, 2007). This\ntherefore constitutes the raison d\u2019etre of this paper: to inform the development of more\nactionable segmentation models and to inform the reader on the strategic and operational\nrole of segmentation as opposed to how to segment.\nResearch Methodology\nWe used a case-based qualitative research methodology, collecting data through 25 in-depth\ninterviews in five UK-based large companies from multiple industries. This approach was\ndeemed the most appropriate because we are seeking to uncover leading edge practice in an\narea where the theory base is comparatively weak and the environment under study is\ncomplex (McCutcheon and Meredith, 1993; Harrison, 2002). Purposive sampling (Gill and\nJohnson, 1991) was used to select companies using customer insight at all three of Smith,\nWilson, and Clark\u2019s (2006) levels: 1) generating customer insight, 2) actioning insight in\n5service and packaging design, and 3) using insight to tailor the core product\/service itself.\nThe companies selected were predominantly service providers; Cisco and BT are partial\nexceptions, being suppliers of integrated product-service systems (Davies et al. 2006) for\nwhom some customers are intermediated by third party organisations.\nTo identify possible sample cases, we considered: companies speaking on customer insight\nor market segmentation at major industry conferences; member organisations of CRM best-\npractice research centers run by two UK business schools; and clients of a major CRM\nconsultancy. This process resulted in a shortlist of 15 companies. Negotiations with these\ncompanies led to final selection of five organizations (see Table 1). This final selection took\naccount of where access could be agreed, as well as seeking a non-competing set of\ncompanies to ease concerns about confidentiality.\nThe final case study selection comprised Barclays, BT Global Services (Major Customers\nDivision), Cisco Systems, O2 and the Post Office, of which the BT and Cisco cases were\nB2B and the remainder spanned B2B and B2C customers. In-depth interviews with key\npersonnel were adopted as the best format to use when physical and psychological proximity\nto the detail of the subject matter is required (Carson and Coviello, 1996). A balanced group\nof four to six interviewees per company was obtained, involving senior personnel from the\ndisciplines of marketing, customer insight, CRM, call centre and sales management\nfunctions. The data were collected between March and August 2006.\nThe interviews were recorded and transcribed and the information was collated into cases,\nalong with any supporting documentation. Each case was then studied in detail, to ensure a\nrich familiarity. A number of logical sections emerged, each with sub-themes. Sections of\ntext were highlighted and a note of the section\/sub-theme was made in the margin. As every\nnew sub-theme emerged, it was listed in an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet then formed\nthe basis of a coding framework, which was entered into the software programme NVivo.\nHaving imported the documents into NVivo, the highlighted passages were coded in\nbatches, per company. This process led to some nodes being created, re-organised or\ndeleted. In order to write up the findings, a coding report was run for each node, displaying\ncomments across all cases on each section\/sub-theme. This facilitated a cross-case search for\npatterns. The NVivo coding framework resulted in the structure of Tables 2 and 3.\n6Table 1: Case Details\nCATEGORY BARCLAYS BT CISCO O2 PO\nIndustry Sector Financial services Telecommunications Technology Mobile telecommunications Retail & financial services\nMarket Sector Business to Consumer\nand Business to Business\nBusiness to Business Business to\nBusiness\nMostly Business to\nConsumer\nBusiness to Consumer and\nBusiness to Business\nCompany size\n(revenue)\n$44.7bn (year to Dec\n2007)\n$39.3bn (year to March\n2007)\n$34.9bn (year to\nJuly 2007)\n$5.5bn (Telefonica O2 UK,\nyear to Dec 2007)\n$1.7bn (year to Dec 2007)\nInterviewee Job\nRoles\n1.Commercial Manager,\nNorth East\n2.

Table 2 provides an\noverview of how each of our case study companies uses different data types in each of\nthese four broad insight categories. All five of our case study companies were using data\nto make market predictions and were using \u2018events and triggers\u2019 to identify revenue\nopportunities. Each of these four broad areas is explained in further detail below.\nTable 2: Customer Insight Generated\nCATEGORY DATA TYPE BARCLAYS BT CISCO O2 PO\nMarket Predictions Various \u221a \u221a\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nCustomer Segments By Business Type \u221a \u221a\nBy Attitudes \u221a \u221a\u221a\nBy Value \u221a \u221a\nBy Vertical Market \u221a \u221a\nBy Needs \u221a \u221a\nBy Customer Lifecycle \u221a\nBy Buyer Behaviour \u221a \u221a \u221a\u221a\nBy Geography \u221a\nBy Demographics \u221a \u221a\u221a\nOpportunity\nAnalytics\nPropensity Models \u221a\u221a \u221a \u221a\u221a\nEvents & Triggers \u221a\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\u221a \u221a\nCustomer Value\nAnalytics\nCustomer Profitability \u221a \u221a\nProduct Profitability \u221a \u221a \u221a\nCustomer Lifetime Value \u221a\nShare Of Customer Wallet \u221a\nCustomer Lifecycle Analysis \u221a\nNote: One tick \u221a indicates that this type of insight is being generated. Two ticks \u221a\u221a indicates that in\ncomparison to the other cases, this type of insight is being extensively generated.\nMarket Predictions: Traditionally the domain of market research, this area has been\nexpanded to include transactional customer data to help make predictions not just about\nthe total market size but also about the company\u2019s sales potential and the market trends\nand issues likely to affect a company\u2019s ability to achieve this potential. Respondents\nconsidered market predictions to be of greater importance as competition intensifies, as\ncustomer demand shifts, as cost pressures to invest wisely increase, and as a result of the\ngreater need to diversify into new markets.\nCustomer Segments: All companies were dividing up their existing and potential\ncustomers into groups for customer selection purposes, although they took a variety of\napproaches. Although there were several instances of traditional a priori segmentation by\nsize of company, geography and demographics, all of the companies were also attempting\nto segment by needs and behaviour, although they all acknowledged the struggle\nnecessary to implement such approaches.\n8Opportunity Analytics: Two of the companies, Barclays and O2, were able to segment\nright down to the individual level using propensity modelling techniques in their\nconsumer markets, while O2 were also beginning to apply similar techniques to business\ncustomers. These techniques were being used to determine the likelihood of individual\ncustomers buying a cross-sold product or defecting, and were being actioned at the front\nline through proactive sales and retention offers. All the companies claimed that\nidentifying customers\u2019 needs based on events and triggers - unusual occurrences in\ncustomer\u2019s lives or their transactions which impact upon their purchase behaviour - were\nthe most actionable forms of insight, providing actionable opportunities for cross-sell, up-\nsell and retention offers which resulted in high reported conversion rates.\nCustomer Value Analytics: The fourth category of customer insight was customer value\nanalytics. Whereas the previous category focused on the most attractive proposition to an\nindividual customer, this category focuses on the most attractive customers to the firm.\nCompanies undertook analyses to build up profiles of customer value more generally not\nonly for the purpose of segmentation but also for other purposes including marketing\ncommunications, product development and financial planning. Customer profitability and\ncustomer lifetime value are notoriously difficult to calculate in practice, due in large part\nto the difficulty in appropriately allocating costs (van Raaij, 2005; Wang and Hong,\n2006). Only Barclays and Cisco claimed to calculate customer profitability and three\ncompanies calculated product profitability (Barclays, O2 and Post Office). Only Cisco\nmentioned customer lifetime value, and only BT and Cisco are trying to measure \u2018share\nof customer wallet\u2019, a measure of customers\u2019 relative spend amongst competing offers.\nWe next consider the role of segmentation in each of our company cases in greater depth\nfrom the perspective of the process of generating segments and then applying how those\nsegments are used in marketing practice.\nBarclays\nGenerating Segmentation\nIn the past, Barclays, a large UK-based bank, generated attitudinal profiles, but struggled\nto attribute those profiles back to its customer base to allow customers to be served\ndifferently. Barclays now adopts a hybrid segmentation model, incorporating attitudinal\nprofiles and four types of segmentation (see Figure 1):\n1. Business type (personal, premier, private, small business);\n2. Operational segmentation by age and wealth;\n3. Attitudinal segmentation ;\n4. Executional segmentation, operationalised as \u2018triggers, events and propensity\nmodels\u2019.\n9Figure 1: Hybrid Segmentation Model at Barclays\nPersonal\nCustomers\nPrivate\nClients\nSmall\nBusiness\nMedium\nBusiness &\nAgriculture\nLarger\nBusiness\nPremier\nCustomer\nCategories\n(Age by\nIncome)\n5 Groups\n19 Types\nOn demand\nManaged\nGroup\nAttitudinal\n8 Types\nTriggers, events & propensities\nDirect \u2013 Nature of Relationship - Managed\nValue\nSegments\ne.g. deciles\nBusiness\nOperational\nAttitudinal\nExecutional\nRespondents regard the executional segmentation category as increasingly important because\nits focuses on how individual customers are to be treated. The category covers a number of\ncustomer-level analyses which have predictive power as to how a customer might respond in\nthe future to a specific offer. One such analysis is \u2018triggers\u2019, occurrences in dealings with the\ncustomer which are believed to be commercially significant. These include out-of-the-ordinary\nevents that occur on the customer\u2019s account and about which Barclays would want to talk to\ncustomers. For example, if a late payment fee has been charged or if a significant credit has\ncome into the customer\u2019s account, this might indicate that the customer\u2019s needs have changed\nin some way. Similarly, a customer who has just taken out cash on their credit card presumably\nhas an urgent need for credit and can be targeted for a loan. The trigger information usually\nneeds to be combined with additional data such as how credit-worthy the customer is. This\nhelps to determine whether a loan would be an appropriate offer for a customer who has just\nbeen charged a late payment fee or an overdraft extension. Respondents claimed that such an\nanalysis should enhance the customer experience as the bank can actually help customers to\navoid paying fees in the future. Another \u2018trigger\u2019 is evidence of customers\u2019 holdings of\ncompetitor products\/services, obtained through direct debit stream analysis. For example, a\ncustomer with a direct debit for \u2018Halifax home insurance\u2019 might then become a target for\nBarclays\u2019 home insurance products.\nBarclays considers the importance of \u2018events\u2019 on customer accounts as well: for example, when\na customer\u2019s insurance is coming up for renewal, or a mortgage or loan is coming to the end of\nits term. Examples of non-product-oriented events are moving house, getting married and\nhaving children. This approach might be loosely correlated with the more familiar lifecycle\n(now known as lifestage) approach to market segmentation (Wells and Gubar, 1966) but with\none key difference: what is important is the timing of the transition and its implications for\n10\ntime-specific communications, not just in which lifestage category a particular customer\nresides.\nBarclays\u2019 main focus in executional segmentation, though, is on propensity modelling to\ngenerate Customer Service Opportunities or \u2018CSOs\u2019, that indicate the the \u2018next best product or\noffer\u2019 for services representative to talk to customers about, taking into account their contact\nand transactional history. Barclays first combines its own transactional data from current\naccounts and credit cards with external data sources, to give it a rich picture of customers\u2019\nlifestyles, finances, careers, spending habits and travel. It then uses technology to combine\ntwenty propensity models, which predict the customers\u2019 likelihood of responding to particular\noffers, using an \u2018optimisation engine\u2019 to determine what offer to present to the customer. The\nengine takes into account multiple variables including propensity or likelihood to respond;\nvalue of the offer; cost of contact by channel; operational capacity; and target volumes by\nproduct. It can calculate the most profitable product to offer to a customer (if there is more than\none choice), taking into account a variety of contact and business rules, including quarantine\nrules, campaign selection rules, total budgets, campaign volumes, campaign timings, cross-\ncampaign rules and channel priority rules. The engine also takes into account a customer\u2019s\nvalues and behaviour so that each offer can be personalized. The optimization is refreshed\ndaily.\nApplying Segmentation\nGenerally speaking, operational segmentation by age and wealth is used for strategy, marketing\nplanning and evaluation. The attitudinal segmentation is used for proposition development,\nmedia planning and communication treatments, while the executional segmentation is used to\noptimize the management of the existing customer base. The Customer Service Opportunities\nare used for direct mail and bank telephony, both outbound (i.e. telemarketing) and inbound\n(i.e. service call handling). In the case of direct mail, up-sell and cross-sell offers are made\nalongside bank statements. An up-sell offer might prompt a current account holder to upgrade\ntheir basic account with additional services, such as the inclusion of a dedicated relationship\nmanager or a guaranteed overdraft. A cross-sell offer might prompt a mortgage account holder\nto take out home insurance.\nIn outbound telephony, the CSOs drive thousands of calls each day, for example encouraging\ncertain customers to increase their loan the next month, or inviting customers who had been\nregularly overdrawn on their current account to come into a branch for a financial review. More\nrecently, the bank\u2019s focus has shifted from outbound to inbound communications - targeting\ncustomers with a tailored message when they contact the bank. Barclays handles around 35 \u2013\n40 million inbound calls each year, typically with service requests such as to check the account\nbalance or to pay bills. Interviewees reported that since CSOs had been made available to\ninbound call centre agents, the sales ratio had increased from one sale per 14 inbound calls to\none sale per 11 inbound calls. Like many organisations, Barclays\u2019 segmentation efforts are\nhampered by its organisational structure, which is aligned to business unit segments rather than\ncustomer-centric segments, and they face significant operational challenges in responding\nquickly enough to the opportunities provided (although this is a common problem reported\nrecently elsewhere - see Gulati, 2007).\n11\nBritish Telecommunications plc\nGenerating Segmentation\nBT\u2019s Major Customers Division, part of the largest telecommunications provider in the UK by\nmarket share, uses three means of defining customer segments as follows: i) by value \u2013 using\ntiers labelled A, B and C which take into account current and potential value; ii) by industry\nsector; and iii) by business needs for telecommunications, with segments such as expanding,\nserving consumers\/citizens, running the business and low needs\/DIY.\nThe business needs segmentation is calculated using a mixture of customer interviews and\nsurvey questions from BT\u2019s ongoing \u2018client landscape survey\u2019. The CRM system contains\n\u2018smart scripts\u2019 to prompt account managers to ask customers certain questions, which inform\nthe survey procedures and results. The segmentation distinguishes four types of buyer: i) low\ninvolvement; ii) demanding; iii) relationship seekers, who want a dedicated account manager;\nand iv) price-sensitive, relationship-shy, transactional buyers. Account managers run their\naccounts through the segmentation model on an annual basis to determine whether the initial\nallocations still hold true.\nInterviews with BT managers indicated that although BT did not use the terminology of events\nand triggers in connection with their segmentation strategy, they do utilize such an approach\nimplicitly, by prompting account managers to act when there is an opportunity for relevant\ndialogue with the customer whenever such information about a customer\u2019s circumstances\narises.\nApplying Segmentation\nBT has a segmentation governance board which consists of heads of marketing from different\nbusiness units, the segmentation manager, a strategy representative and a sales representative.\nThis board is responsible for agreeing the overall segmentation model, communicating it within\nthe company more generally and gaining buy-in from the sales community. A customer base\nteam runs new accounts through the segmentation model before allocating them to a particular\nsales group which makes recommendations about how the account should be managed. This is\nthen communicated to BT\u2019s service, billing and customer satisfaction teams.\nAlthough the new segmentation model is still in the early stages of development, it\ndemonstrates how BT is beginning to use segmentation not only to determine what to sell, but\nalso how to sell. At the moment, the model is primarily used to develop new propositions, and\nto help in the identification of potential early innovators. The implementation challenge focuses\naround how the sales team learns to identify customer needs and adapt their sales behaviours\naccordingly, a shift from selling based only on product features and benefits.\nThe desk-based account teams currently use the Siebel CRM system to view a matrix of what\nthey have sold, what is outstanding, and what campaigns customers have been included in, as\nwell as what opportunities are open to them at the moment. BT\u2019s CRM system indicates events\nand triggers, such as prompts to indicate a contract is up for renewal or has lain dormant.\n12\nCisco\nGenerating Segmentation\nCisco, a US-based IT networking company, has traditionally segmented by geography and size\nof company, but more recently has started segmenting by technology lifecycle and by\npurchasing method. With this latest approach, Cisco believes that it is at the beginning of\nunderstanding what managers call the customers\u2019 \u2018next best move\u2019. Technology lifecycle\nequates to a customer life-cycle characteristic of the company\u2019s status in adopting new\ntechnologies (Rogers, 1962). Respondents claim that it is now possible to predict whether a\nparticular product is needed for certain types of businesses, depending on where they are in the\ntechnology lifecycle. For example, using data from the UK\u2019s Companies House (or other\nstatutory company accounts-filing sources in other countries), Cisco can pin-point companies\nwith 150% increase in earnings year on year. These companies may need some of the\ntechnologies that commonly help deal with growth and expansion, such as call centre\ntechnology with call-waiting and call-queueing. They may want to introduce workflow\ntechnology so they can start diverting some of the queries onto their website, or to home-\nworkers in other parts of the company who have been hired on a pay-per-call basis. More\nmature companies are more likely to need technologies that help diversification, or entry into\nnew markets.\nWithin the customer lifecycle segmentation approach, Cisco also identifies \u2018events and\ntriggers\u2019 - compelling events that are driving technology purchases. These are categorised as\n\u2018inherent and known\u2019, \u2018inherent but unknown\u2019 and \u2018created and unknown\u2019. \u2018Inherent and\nknown\u2019 events are within the business itself, such as an office move. Many of Cisco\u2019s solutions\napply to companies that are starting up or moving premises, so it purchases lists of office-\nmovers and targets them very successfully with outbound calls. \u2018Inherent but unknown\u2019 events\nare classified as such because they may be known to Cisco, but are not necessarily known to\nthe customer. For example, if the service contract on a product has expired, Cisco could call the\ncustomer with a view to renewing the contract. \u2018Created and unknown\u2019 events are where Cisco\nenvisages and communicates a commercial benefit from technology of which the customer was\nnot previously aware.\nThe purchasing method segmentation acknowledges that customers can buy products in a\nnumber of ways. They can purchase products and install them on their own premises, or they\ncan have the service provided through a third-party distributor such as BT. Either of these\nmodels can be applied with a lease plan as opposed to paying for the product outright.\nApplying Segmentation\nTraditionally a sales-driven company, worsening market conditions prompted sales teams in\nCisco to ask their marketing colleagues for help in defining their markets and segments. At this\nstage, the European HQ was beginning to deliver \u2018customer packs\u2019 to different countries,\ndesigned to help sales teams plan their operations, workforce and activities around market\nobjectives. This segmentation model has to date been launched in six European countries,\nwhere small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) were divided into three tiers using a\nsegmentation model based on technology type. Tier 1 are \u2018experimenters\u2019; Tier 2 companies\n13\nwould be considered the \u2018early majority\u2019 in a typical lifecycle (Rogers 1962); and Tier 3\ntypically purchase from a service provider. The tiers direct Cisco\u2019s approach. For example,\nCisco reports that Tier 2 customers have tended to be the most profitable, so if a country has a\nlimited marketing budget, they would be encouraged to focus on Tier 2 customers.\n\u2018Experimenters\u2019 are service-heavy, so Cisco concentrates on selling a service contract to this\ngroup. To maximize the margin in Tier 3, Cisco has concentrated on working effectively with\nthe service provider to ensure they carry enough stock to service demand.\nCisco\u2019s challenge is to support the data collection which drives segmentation programs and the\nactioning of them, without over-administering the whole process. A secondary problem is that\nbudgets do not stretch to targeting smaller and smaller segments, and the whole ethos of market\nsegmentation, is defeated, because resources are not allocated strategically in such an instance.\nO2\nGenerating Segmentation\nO2 is a UK-based mobile telecommunications provider (originally demerged from BT and now\npart of Telefonica O2 Europe plc). This company has traditionally segmented by value,\nindustry sector, needs and behaviour. Value measures are used to determine the highest value\ncustomers, particularly in the consumer business (e.g., \u2018young socials\u2019). O2 respondents\nbelieved that targeting industry sectors was more appropriate in the corporate business, because\nbespoke solutions are built for them due to the size and scale of their businesses.\nO2 considers the needs and attitudes of customers, particularly in relation to how they use their\nmobile phone, in order to prioritise them based on what managers refer to as their \u2018mind-\nstates\u2019. Segments are created (particularly in the SME business) by analysing the behaviour of\nexisting customers, combined with data from external sources such as CACI, TGI and others.\nO2 also uses events and triggers in the existing customer base - for example, selecting\ncustomers whose contract is up for renewal, or corporate accounts which have not upgraded\ntheir handsets or reviewed their pricing structure for some time.\nUntil recently, the segmentation strategy at O2 has been used predominantly to guide the\ncustomer acquisition process and to assist in outbound activity, rather than to define segments\namongst existing customers. More recently, segmentation of the customer base has moved\ntowards a one-to-one marketing model. Three years prior to the interviews, O2 had a large\ndepartment of analysts carrying out project-based analysis of existing customers in order to\ncreate customer selection models for outbound promotional purposes. However, this approach\nwas felt to be too slow and did not deliver actionable results immediately. Consequently, O2\ninstalled predictive data-mining software, which enabled it to produce large volumes of\ncustomer response predictions very quickly.\nThe resulting system - christened \u2018VISION\u2019 - incorporates 45 propensity models predicting\nacross the product range each customer\u2019s probability of purchasing a particular product if it is\noffered to them, as well as their probability of ceasing to use a product or defecting entirely.\nThe analysis is based on a combination of transactional and externally obtained data. Compared\nto O2\u2019s previous technology, the models can be calculated in one-seventh of the time and\n14\nfurthermore, operate in real-time during a customer interaction, so the estimated propensities\nwill be updated during a telephone call depending on what has happened earlier in the call. The\nsoftware is customized into six versions, aligned to different product lines, sales teams and\nservice call centres. Its goal is to enable front-line staff to make \u201cthe right offer to customers, in\nthe right place, at the right time\u201d to improve the customer experience, as well as their\nengagement and loyalty. The decision logic of the system allows customer service agents to\nassess the callers\u2019 concerns, interests and risk. Propensity models are then constructed using a\ntwo-step analytical approach. Firstly, univariate analysis is used to establish the top ten\nindependent variables for the dependent variable such as propensity to buy a given product: for\nexample, a handset upgrade propensity model might include the time to the end of the existing\ncontract as an independent variable. Secondly, multivariate analysis is used to predict purchase\nor likelihood of defection for a given customer at a given moment.\nApplying Segmentation\nThe needs-based segmentation approach is used at the strategic level, to understand which\nmarkets O2 should operate in. The behavioural segmentation is still used to target some\noutbound marketing communications activity. However, using segmentation insights in this\nway was perceived to be excessively coarse when dealing with individual customers, hence the\nperceived need to develop the VISION system.\nIn the inbound service call centres (handling around 50 million calls per year), the VISION\nsystem offers advice to agents on how to handle service enquiries and problems. For example,\nit alerts an agent if a customer has a high propensity to churn or signifies a payment risk. Once\nthe enquiry or problem has been resolved, the system suggests the top three most appropriate\nproducts or services to discuss with individual customers, and provides a script to help agents\nto discuss the top one.\nThe \u2018VISION\u2019 initiative is perceived as a considerable success within the company, with\nimpressive conversion rates being cited. Use of the system is voluntary and on average, at the\ntime of the interviews, 73% of all customer service calls (from consumer and small-to-medium\nsized businesses) were entered onto VISION. Of those 73% of calls, about 38% of customers\nwere being offered an additional product or service. In 41% of these cases, this resulted in an\nagent processing an order (this figure increasing to 47% if cases are included where a customer\nwas recorded to have taken an action as a result of the offer). Approximately 50% of the offers\nwere non-revenue generating for O2, such as a new handset or extra minutes, but the overall\neffect, respondents claimed, was that bill value increased by an average of 15% in the month\nafter the offer was accepted. Retention costs were also reduced by \u00a3150-200k per month and\ncustomer churn reduced by 3%. All of these results were achieved without an increase in\naverage call-handling time. The outbound sales teams use the system to significantly reduce the\npreparation time for sales calls. Often the sales department would place a call and not get\nthrough, meaning that preparation time had been wasted. As the offers were relevant and\ntimely, it was easier to build rapport and the conversion rate went up consequently.\n15\nPost Office Counters Limited\nGenerating Segmentation\nIn 2003, the UK Post Office, responsible for post and parcel delivery, marketing and logistics\nservices to public and business users, decided that it wanted to develop a detailed strategic\nsegmentation strategy to be used predominantly by marketing teams, but understood and used\nthroughout the business to help design products, size markets, differentiate marketing messages\nand understand their customers. When the segmentation strategy was launched in 2004,\nmanagers had no products for which they owned the customer data, only \u2018anonymous\ntransactions\u2019, relying on external market research data to understand product usage, attitudes\nand behaviour. Based on a customer survey, the Post Office identified 19 segments, organized\ninto 8 groups, which then clustered and mapped onto the general population using data from\ninformation provider Experian.\nBy 2006, according to Experian, major changes were taking place in the UK population and,\nconsequently, new products and new marketing initiatives were launched (e.g. \u2018Ants\u2019\nadvertising campaigns). Additional research was also commissioned. The Post Office had\ndecided it was time to refresh its segmentation strategy by developing its own data sources,\ntogether with those from its market research partners including Hall and Partners (Brand and\nCommunications), Forrester (technology and internet), Millward-Brown International (Post\nOffice usage), Experian Canvasse Lifestyle (UK level database of lifestyle characteristics),\nExperian UKCSD (UK level database of demographics and classifications) and MFS (financial\nservices).\nThe refreshed segmentation strategy contained over 1,000 main variables (compared to just\neight previously), based around three key customer components: i) demographics, ii) attitudes\nand iii) behaviours. For each segment, the Post Office now understands: what percentage of the\nUK population they represent; their dominant age, income and lifestage; their preferred\nchannel, what Post Office products they have purchased and when; how often they visit a\nbranch; and the main reason for their last visit. It is able to list detailed key features of each\nsegment and understands how the different segments relate to each other over time. All adults\nover 18 years old in the UK are now classified into one of the 19 segments or 8 groups, plotted\nagainst two key demographic variables, affluence and lifestage. The eight main groups are\noutlined below as follows:\nA: Maturing Affluence: Technology Embracing Careerists; Conservative Values\nB: Starting Out: Prospering Graduates; Young Active Fun Males, Females Finding Their Feet\nC: Optimistic Families: Aspiring Midmarket; Nestmaking Nuptials\nD: Autumnal Comfort: Contented Retirement; Community Mainstays; Traditional Resistors\nE: Blue Collar Survivors: Burdened Blokes; Hardship Balancing Females; Transient\nDependants\nF: Cash Strapped Youth: Welfare Young Mums; Struggling Singles\nG: Traditional Elders: Industrial Backbone; Dignified Elders; Dependent Elders\nH: Welfare Reliants\n16\nThe eight groups address the consumer side of the business. The Post Office is also starting to\nidentify events and triggers in certain markets: for example, school and public holidays trigger\ndemand for travel products. On the corporate side, The Royal Mail segments by value, by size\nof company, by industry sector and by type of relationship.\nApplying Segmentation\nThe Post Office uses segmentation to drive strategy, marketing and new product development.\nBranch managers use the segmentation tool to determine what products are most likely to\nappeal to the segments that are most represented in their postal area. The segmentation tool is\nused to retrain the sales department to focus on understanding and identifying customer needs,\nrather than selling on features and benefits. The segmentation model also helps to determine\nwhich markets should be tested for which new products. By targeting segments that are likely\nto be receptive to particular new products, Post Office representatives report that the\neffectiveness of pilot launches has much improved.\nHowever, due to an historical operating model, a lack of investment in technology and a culture\nof \u2018serving not selling\u2019, borne of its public sector history, the Post Office is not making use of\nthe segmentation model to create value through inbound contacts. Its inbound call centres are\noutsourced and managed by different suppliers on long-term contracts, aligned to particular\nproducts, making it impossible (from both a technology and a process point of view) for call\ncentre agents to offer products that are managed by a different call centre.\nDiscussion\nWe discuss our findings firstly with respect to the generation of segmentation, and secondly\nwith respect to its actioning. The actioning of customer insight, including segmentation, across\nthe case study companies is summarised in Table 3. For simplicity, only the dominant\napplications of insight, in the perception of the interviewees, are shown in the table.\n17\nTable 3: Applying Customer Insight: Cross-Case Analysis\nPERIODIC TARGET\nSETTING AND\nEVALUATION\nPROPOSITION\nDEVELOPMENT\nEXECUTION\nMarket\nPredictions\nAll cases: targets and\nprogress against plan by\nmarket\nCustomer\nSegments\nBarclays (lifecycle)\nBT (sector; value tier)\nCisco (geography; size)\nO2 (B2B: industry sector;\nB2C: sociodemographic\nvalue clusters)\nBarclays (attitudinal)\nBT (needs-based; sector; value\ntier)\nCisco (technology lifecycle)\nO2 (B2B: industry sector,\nbehaviour segmentation; B2C:\nneeds-based)\nPost Office (integrated\nsegmentation)\nBarclays (attitudinal: mass\nmarcoms)\nBT (needs-based, sector and\nvalue tier: campaign lists,\nadvertising)\nCisco (campaign lists)\nO2 (customer acquisition)\nPost Office (test cell definition,\ngeographic targeting,\nadvertising)\nOpportunity\nAnalytics\nBarclays (propensity, events &\ntriggers to prompt outbound &\ninbound sales offers)\nBT (events & triggers to\nprompt outbound sales offers)\nCisco (events & triggers to\nprompt outbound offers)\nO2 (propensities, events &\ntriggers to prompt outbound &\ninbound sales offers)\nPost Office (limited use of\nevents to prompt sales offers)\nCustomer\nValue Analytics\nBT (value tier)\nO2 (share of wallet and\ncustomer value targets)\nBarclays (customer\nprofitability)\nBT (customer value, sales\nopportunity value)\nCisco (company growth;\nopportunity value)\nO2 (product profitability, not\ncustomer profitability,\ninfluences sales offers)\nGenerating Segmentation\nThe cases suggest that segmentation has not been superseded as an actionable form of customer\ninsight, but indicate instead that segmentation forms a key component of customer insight\nprogrammes. We define customer insight as a broader term encompassing the domains of\nmarket research, segmentation and customer analytics based on a mix of transactional and\nexternal customer data.\nAll the cases in this study were found to be aggregating and synthesizing multiple data sources\nto generate customer insight. However, there is no empirically-derived list of the different types\nof customer insight in the marketing literature, although Wills & Williams (2004) propose the\nfollowing as data sources: customer database analysis, market intelligence, competitor\nintelligence, feedback from sales and customer service staff, including customer complaints,\nand financial and planning data, for examples. We have confirmed these and proposed several\nnew sub-categories. Hirschowitz (2001) cites strategic segmentation, loyalty indicators, channel\npropensity, campaign propensity scores and response value scores as examples of customer\n18\ninsight. We confirm and expand these areas. Only two of the five companies (Barclays and O2)\nmade extensive use of propensity models, confirming previous suggestions that most\ncompanies do a poor job predicting the behaviour of their customers (Reinartz et al., 2005).\nSmith et al (2006a; 2006b) found practice to be hindered by a lack of appropriate data and\nunderstanding of needs-based segmentation: we support this finding, given the patchy\napplication of needs-based segmentation in our sample. We synthesise this discussion into the\nfollowing proposition:\nP1. Segmentation needs to be complemented by other forms of customer insight\nfrom multiple data sources in order to support both strategic and operational\nmarketing objectives.\nIn support of this proposition, we now turn to how companies use or apply segmentation and\nother complementary forms of customer insight.\nApplying Segmentation\nCustomer segmentation, the action of dividing customers into like-minded groups, remains in\nuse in all the case studies for marketing planning purposes: identifying potential target groups,\nprioritising these, and developing propositions for them. How this process works, including the\nsegmentation bases used, differs substantially across the cases, but respondents did not question\nthe need for such a process to be engaged.\nIt is in the communication of value propositions that more significant differences began to arise\nacross the set of cases. While mass marketing communications were reported as benefiting\nfrom attitudinal segmentation in the cases of BT and Post Office, communications through\ninteractive channels showed an interesting trend across all the cases towards the usage of\ncustomer analytics at individual, rather than group, level.\nRespondents in the cases where this trend was most mature, O2 and Barclays, cited impressive\nimprovements in communications effectiveness to support their assertion that this trend was a\nbeneficial one. In both cases, the combination of propensity models, which allow the\ndetermination of likelihood of acceptance of a particular product\/service, and rules which take\ninto account incremental cost\/benefit were used to fine-tune one-to-one communications\nthrough both outbound and inbound channels.\nAll cases, however, claimed substantial benefits from the use of another under-studied insight\ncategory: the use of events and triggers. Gartner Group (2006) has argued that event-triggered\nmarketing (practiced by all the companies in this study to a greater or lesser extent), yields a\nlevel of response rate typically five times greater than that obtained using traditional marketing\napproaches.\nThe above discussion gives rise to some further speculative propositions, which while by no\nmeans proven, are consistent with our data and which deserve further investigation:\nP2. Market segmentation is most appropriate for decisions on customer selection\nand proposition development which need to be taken at the level of a group of\n19\ncustomers \u2013 for example, broad product design, branding, pricing strategy and\nmass communications.\nP3. Where a company is interacting with an individual customer, aspects of the\nproposition that can be tailored to the individual level (such as cross-sale offers\nin inbound channels and outgoing targeted direct mail) will be most effectively\ninformed by one-to-one customer analytics rather than just by using segment\nmembership.\nWith regard to P3, it is worth noting that it is not just cross-sale and retention offers which are\nbeing made on the basis of individualised insight. The cases illustrate tailoring of the customer\nvalue proposition for other aspects of the marketing mix as well: product specification (all\ncases), pricing (Cisco) and the choice of communications and delivery channels (all cases).\nThese findings support various authors who have asserted that technology can play a critical\nrole in the ability of firms to customise their service offerings (Peppers & Rogers, 1993; Pine\nII, 2004). Our findings support Gwinner et al\u2019s (2005) proposal that inbound customers can be\nprovided with individually tailored products and services, and Bitner, Brown, and Meuter\u2019s\n(2000) suggestion that contact employees can handle service situations with a growing\ncomplexity that are incapable of being handled manually, improving performance through the\ntailoring of the customer-employee interaction to a specific customer (Sujan, Weitz and Kumar,\n1994). Maister (1997) has claimed that intensive customer-employee interaction was necessary\nto build an accurate picture of customer needs required for successful cross-selling. Contrary to\nthis claim, our research indicates from two case studies at least that customer insight delivered\nto call centre agents can lead to successful cross-selling without intensive customer-employee\ninteraction.\nThe fine-tuning of this individualised insight was a moving target in several of the case study\norganisations, with continuing refinements and consequent improvements in metrics such as\nconversion rates reported by Barclays and O2, in particular. The need for recalculation of\npropensity models even during an inbound telephone call at O2 is a logical conclusion for the\ninsight-into-action loop once it has been technology-enabled. While the purposes for which the\nuse of market segmentation is proposed, such as product design and the design of mass\ncommunications, have no particular requirement for fast application, this is not the case when\nindividual customers present themselves in an outlet, on the website or in an inbound call\ncentre. We therefore conjecture:\nP4. While segmentation may need to be periodically refreshed, individualised\ncustomer analytics and propensity models are most effective when generated and\nactioned in real-time customer interactions.\nWe note a further implication of P3 regarding customer acquisition versus customer\ndevelopment. Sufficient data are more likely to exist to calculate customer analytics and\npropensity models in the case of existing customers than in the case of new ones, therefore the\nopportunity for individualised interactions is frequently greater in the case of existing\ncustomers. Consequently, we propose that:\n20\nP5. Segmentation is most likely to be applicable to communications with new\ncustomers, while customer analytics and propensity models are most effectively\nused with existing customers where transactional history data are available.\nThis generalisation may prove, however, to be decreasingly the case as interactive IT-enabled\nchannels continue to grow in importance and customer data are increasingly collected at market\nlevel rather than at the customer level.\nNext, we note the implications for measurement of effectiveness. A characteristic of propensity\nmodels is that they embed explicitly an estimate of the effectiveness of the communication\nbased on them. As models are refined, so effectiveness improves. P3 can be tested through field\nexperimentation. The same is not the case, however, for proposition development at the level of\nmarketing planning, the effectiveness of which is famously difficult to assess (Harris and\nOgbonna 2006). We therefore propose that:\nP6: Companies do not directly measure the success of their market segmentation\nprogrammes per se but are increasingly likely to measure the success of CRM\nprogrammes based on individualised customer insight provided by customer\nanalytic data and propensity models.\nIt is difficult to envisage methods by which companies could assess quantitatively the\neffectiveness of their segmentation programmes, and indeed in none of the companies was this\nassessed explicitly. Qualitative evaluation might, however, be feasible, through the use of\nmultiple segmentation approaches in parallel in different business units in order to evaluate\ntheir relative usefulness, but most assessments of effectiveness are based on subjective\nmanagerial perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.\nFinally, we conjecture as to how a possible feedback loop can be incorporated from one-to-one\ncustomer analyses to re(de)fine segmentation approaches. We propose that companies that\ndecide to use propensity modeling to identify customer transaction likelihood indicators can\nthen work backwards, not only estimating customer lifetime values but also re-constructing\ndifferent segment arrangements (thereby incorporating propensities) until they achieve an\noptimal segment configuration. Segmentation in such a situation is not only a process of\nderiving desirable (micro) customer segments from a mass (heterogeneous, macro) market, but\ncould also be the opposite, a process of building-up micro-segments based on transaction\nlikelihoods to form maps of customer groups at the macro-level. We propose that this area of\nmarket segmentation, the link between propensity modeling, customer analytics and the\ndetermination of optimal customer segments over time, is particularly worthy of further\nresearch, given the lack of understanding of dynamism in market segmentation programmes\n(Brangule-Vlagsma, Pieters and Wedel, 2002). We therefore propose that:\nP7: Highly sophisticated companies will not only manage their interactions with\nand tailor offerings to selected customer groups on an individual basis, but will\nalso measure the likelihood of customers taking up new offerings using customer\nanalytic data and propensity modelling, which when combined with segmentation\n21\nprogrammes will allow the measurement of customer lifetime value and the\ndynamic optimization of market segments.\nNevertheless, we recognize that not all companies will be able to undertake the above\napproach since only those companies with a direct relationship with the end-user have the\npossibility of providing one-to-one service interaction, which are not present for FMCG\ncompanies, for example, L\u2019Oreal who deal with trade intermediaries more often than end-\nusers. The act of service provision per se provides both a data collection opportunity at\nthe individual end-user level, and a context in which individualised offers can be made.\nConversely, segmentation \u2013 as practiced in the FMCG context - based on market research\nstudies may be the best available method if a survey is the only way of getting customer\ndata and the means of communication used (e.g. broadcasting) are aimed at groups rather\nthan individual customers.\nManagerial Implications\nOur study demonstrates that in today\u2019s environment of fierce competition and intense cost\npressure, the impact of customer insight extends well beyond the one outcome studied by\nSinkula et al. (1997), that of marketing programme dynamism. Organisations need to develop a\ncommon understanding of what customer insight is and how it is used throughout their\norganization, including the link with market segmentation and CRM. Segmentation continues\nto be vital for marketing planning, but organizations with rich data on individual customers\nshould consider developing and implementing propensity modelling systems (where customer\ndata are available) and the use of triggers and events in individualised customer interactions.\nThis will then provide the possibility of optimizing customer segments using propensity\nmodelling data derived from CRM systems which when clustered can determine the most likely\ncustomers for specific products; an invaluable piece of information to determine the\neffectiveness of segmentation approaches when the two are combined.\nConsequently, marketers\u2019 future skills requirements will change dramatically. Analytical ability\nwill become increasingly imperative as firms shift from defining and actioning marketing\nprogrammes in identified segments to generating individualised customer insight among\ncustomer groups to craft profitable conversations with individual customers. Developing such\nhigh-powered insight is likely to require the development of new relationships with\nsophisticated market research agencies\/IT consultancies to leverage the potential that such\ncustomer knowledge can bestow. The sales role will consequently change as their focus shifts\nfrom selling on product features and benefits to understanding and responding to customers\u2019\nindividualised needs \u2013 for a long time an aspiration, but increasingly becoming a reality.\nFurther Research and Conclusions\nFurther research is needed in several areas. Firstly, the claims from some respondents about the\npromising efficacy of events and triggers require further in-depth qualitative exploration. This\ncould usefully uncover, via in-depth case study work among early adopters, the nature of this\nemerging customer insight technique both analytically and in the processes which apply it to\nform individualised offers. Secondly, similar in-depth exploration with early adopters is needed\ninto the use of propensity models particularly to formulate offers in inbound channels such as\ncall centres and the web \u2013 contexts in which individualisation has in general been less advanced\n22\nthan in outbound direct communications. In both cases, the boundary between group-level\nsegmentation and individual insight needs further elucidation.\nThirdly, these more specific studies would be well complemented by descriptive survey work\nexploring current practice in the generation and actioning of all types of customer insight,\nhence adding granularity on the issue of customer insight to the more holistic study of\ncontemporary marketing practice by Coviello et al (2002). Finally, the efficacy of different\napproaches to the actioning of customer insight might be best explored through field\nexperiments (Ryals and Wilson, 2005) using randomised assignment of customers or\ntransactions to two or more treatments, such as one based on a conventional segmentation\napproach and one based on individualised propensity models. Given the clear benefits to a\ncollaborating company of such action research, this might prove possible in terms of research\naccess.\nIn summary, there is precious little written in the marketing literature on customer insight, or\nthe link between customer insight and market segmentation, or indeed the link between CRM\nand market segmentation. Our study is the first we are aware of to empirically identify different\ntypes of customer insight, and indicate their link to market segment definition and actioning,\nespecially in organizations which have a relationship with their end-users. As this study was\nbased on five largely multinational, mainly service-based companies, it represents only one\nparticular set of practices and concerns regarding the actioning of market segmentation,\nindicating the presence of techniques used to action market segmentation rather than\nconfirming their ubiquity in commerce more generally. We should note that propensity\nmodelling, in particular, might be of much less importance to manufacturers at least in FMCG\nmarkets (although not retailers if product sales and customer data are both collected through\nloyalty cards) because these companies do not tend, at present, to collect data directly from\ntheir end-users. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are another case in point, because they are\nlegally barred from marketing to end-users, although they are starting to collect data on patients\nfor product usage\/informing purposes (e.g. related to the correct use of medications). So, even\nin this area, we may well see change in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank representatives of Barclays, BT Global Services, Cisco\nSystems, O2 and the Post Office for agreeing to take part in the study.\nReferences\nAnsell, J., Harrison, T., & Archibald, T.
