Introduction22\nIt is widely accepted that the current rate of extraction and consumption of finite global23\nresources is unsustainable, and associated with global warming, unsustainable depletion of24\nfossil fuels and, on occasion, localised damage to the natural environment [1]. Of course25\n2economic growth, which usually correlates positively with increased resource extraction and1\nutilisation, is also associated with increased employment, greater societal access to goods and2\nservices and higher standards of living. A key challenge for the 21st Century is to decouple3\nresource consumption from economic growth. One strategy for closing this gap [2] must be4\nin implementing more sustainable patterns and behaviours of production and consumption [3,5\n11]. National environmental policies increasingly focus on the twin goals of improving6\nresource productivity and eco-efficiency. Whilst the former relates the material and energy7\ninputs of production to final industrial output, the latter relates industrial output to the8\nimmediate ecological impacts [4, 5]. The more mature resource strategies have the higher9\nambition of \u2018dematerialisation\u2019; that is, a progressive reduction of material use. Japan and10\nGermany [6], but also the European Union more broadly, are exploring and partly enacting11\nsuch resource policies [7].12\nThe macro analysis of material flows in an economy has been one means of informing13\nthese policies. Tools for materials flow analysis have developed out of associated techniques14\nfor relating resource-use to environmental impact. For instance, life cycle assessment (LCA)15\nis one means of tracking resource use (usually in products) from \u201ccradle to grave\u201d. LCA is16\nusually limited to a single production process, is complex and data intensive for multiple17\nproducts or a whole economy, and so ecological footprinting has been used in an attempt to18\ncollapse multiple environmental impacts into a single sustainability indicator [8]. Hybrids19\nalso exist. Zhao, Li, and Li [9] developed a method that starts from assessing the energy20\nflows of a socio-ecological system alongside its biological productivity. Others have21\nconsidered the flow of carbon during waste generation [10] and the wastes generated within22\nmanufacturing processes [11]. These tools have been used to infer the sustainability of a23\ndomestic economy in its current state, but do not generally allow the forecasting of24\nalternative scenarios in the way some hybrid input-output tables do [17]. Given the pace of25\n3change in the UK with respect to waste and resource management, we have perceived a need1\nfor a flow model capable of forecasting resource use and waste generation under different2\neconomic and social conditions. Accordingly, this paper augments an existing materials flow3\nmodel for the UK economy that relates material flows to waste generation. Scenarios are4\nintroduced in order to explore the model, the results and implications of which are discussed.5\n6\n2 Method and model development7\nThere are two elements of the methodological approach used in this study. The first is the8\ndevelopment of a material flow model with commonly available software (spreadsheet9\nExcel\u2122; mass flow model platform AMBER\u2122); and the second is the construction and10\nexploration of illustrative future scenarios for discussion. Waste flows in the UK economy11\ncan be conceptualised as a materials cycle which, as Matthews et al. [13] have explained in12\ndepth, involves a number of inputs flowing through a domestic economy and its associated13\nenvironment. In brief, direct material and energy input (DMI) enter an economy for14\neconomic processing (Figure 1) either as imported raw materials or as domestically extracted15\nresources.16\n17\n(insert Figure 1)18\n19\nIn doing so, these inputs add to the national resource stock, which comprises goods, buildings20\nand infrastructure, thus representing a net addition to stock, NAS. As a result the21\nmaintenance of the economy is secured and output produced - exports are sent aboard and22\ndomestic processed output (DPO) are goods retained within the domestic environment. For23\nthe domestic environment, as these goods fall out of the chain of utility, they generate24\n4domestic waste streams and thus waste mass (in millions of tonnes, Mt) for waste processing1\nthrough a range of technologies.2\nImported and domestic inputs also have associated \u2018hidden flows\u2019 that result from3\nextraction and processing. Hidden flows are often referred to colloquially as those materials4\nextracted during production, but that are not actually used in the product themselves. An5\nexample of a domestic hidden flow is the material disturbed (overburden) when minerals are6\nextracted from quarries in the UK; for example during china clay extraction. Hidden flows7\nare significant because whilst they may not be accounted for in conventional resource8\nmanagement models, they often have significant environmental impacts because their mass,9\nor volume, may be considerably greater than the material requirement of the product in10\nquestion. In brief, hidden flows do not enter the realm of economic processing. They are11\ncategorised (Figure 1) by whether they enter the domestic environment from abroad (foreign12\nhidden flows, FHF), or as a result of domestic resource extraction (domestic hidden flows,13\nDHF). Taken together and considered alongside the domestic material input (DMI), they14\nconstitute the total material requirement (TMR) of a domestic economy, say the UK.15\nTogether, the total hidden flows (DHF) and the domestic processed output (DPO) from16\neconomic processing represent the total domestic output (TDO) of the economy (Figure 1;17\n[18, 34]). These concepts are now in wide use and the concept of hidden flows has been18\nadopted to illustrate the hidden impacts of waste generation [14, 15, 35, 36]. This conceptual19\nframework (Figure 1) has guided the construction of the materials flow model in our work20\n[37, 38].21\nOur concern here relates to hidden flows and waste generation [38]. The first stage in22\nbuilding a quantitative model was to identify and term the variables involved. Bringezu and23\nSch\u00fctz [16] demonstrated the domestic material input (DMI) is the main input variable in24\nthese models. In order for the model to detail the constituent components of the DMI, as well25\n5as the fate of the materials as outputs which is important for considering waste management1\nimplications, a number of sub-variables were required. These were adapted from Bringezu2\nand Sch\u00fctz [16] performed for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs3\n(Defra, in England) and are explained in Table 1.4\n5\n(insert Table 1)6\n7\nA fundamental assumption concerns the hidden flows. Given our model\u2019s primary concern8\nwith waste flows it was assumed that those fractions of the hidden flows that enter the9\ndomestic environment remain unaltered and as such were represented by a simultaneous input10\nand output. Hence, only the direct waste streams resulting from the FHF were considered11\nhere. In order to explore future waste flows, model assumptions are required with respect to12\ndomestic processed output (DPO) and total domestic output (TDO), including the generation13\nof specific waste streams (Figure 1). To this end, disposal routes were selected and sectoral14\nwaste generation data (2006) employed by the Environment Agency [20]. The total of ca.15\n434 million tonnes (MT) of waste arisings were disaggregated (w\/w) into: 20% agricultural16\nwastes, 21% mineral wastes, 8% dredging, 8% municipal wastes, 13% industrial wastes, 6%17\ncommercial wastes, and 24% construction and demolition wastes. Sewage sludge was18\nestimated at contributing < 1% of the wastes produced in the UK and for the illustrative19\npurposes of simplifying the modelling calculations, was assumed to be zero.20\nWith the wastes designated in the model (Figures 1 to 3) it was necessary to complete21\nthe description with the disposal pathways for each of the wastes. The data on disposal22\nroutes was compiled using figures predominately from the Environment Agency [21] with23\nsupporting data from Defra [22, 23] and, in the case of dredging, from Morris [24]. Simple24\n6linear flow models representing the linear flows in Figure 1 were constructed both in Excel\u21221\nand in the mass balance platform AMBER\u2122.2\n3\n2.1 Scenario development4\nThe modelling approach employed a baseline scenario representing the current economic5\nmetabolism of the UK (2006) and its growth based on the status-quo. Against the baseline6\ncase, the implications of three alternative scenarios were modelled; thus the four scenarios7\nmodelled were: (i) the baseline scenario; (ii) a scenario in which the UK runs out of domestic8\nresources; (iii) a scenario reflecting legislative changes in the UK; and (iv) a technologically9\nadvanced future. Assumptions that characterised these illustrative futures were used to10\namend the model parameters adopted for the baseline scenario, and the results generated,11\nreviewed and discussed.12\n13\nThe baseline scenario14\nThe baseline scenario acted as the reference that all subsequent scenarios were compared15\nagainst, representing a relatively accurate picture of the 2006 situation within the UK. The16\nmodel inputs, including the direct material inputs (DMI) to the model, were adapted from17\nEnviros Consulting [25]. Three time intervals, used for all scenarios, were T1: 2010; T2:18\n2015; T3: 2020.19\n20\nThe UK runs out of domestic resources21\nThe second scenario is a future in which resource issues become a significant problem for the22\nUK, at a time when it experiences poor economic growth. As Enviros Consulting [25] state,23\nthe majority of the UK\u2019s resources are imported. The former government Department of24\nTrade and Industry [DTI; 26] elaborated on the decline of the UK\u2019s indigenous energy25\n7supplies the associated economic consequences. The DTI stated that the UK will have run1\nout of its indigenous energy supplies within a decade and, by 2020, be dependent on other2\ncountries for three quarters of its energy needs. This outlook is expected to impact directly3\non the composition of material flows. The variables requiring alteration in this regard against4\nthe baseline scenario (w\/w) were a decline in domestic extraction (T1: 45.0%, T2: 31.2%, T3:5\n14.0%,) and subsequent increase in imports (T1: 55.0%, T2: 68.8%, and T3: 86.0%).6\n7\nLegislative changes to waste policy8\nThe legislation of wastes is a hugely dynamic domain with the frequent introduction of new9\nregulations and the continual revisions of existing directives and targets. The Chartered10\nInstitute of Wastes Management [27] outline some of the key legislative advances in recent11\nyears. These have been carried forward by the legislator and elaborated on in the Waste12\nStrategy for England [28]. England has targets for recycling and composting, waste recovery13\nand landfill diversion, these supported by (among other regimes) the Landfill Tax escalator14\nthe Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS). Using the above information on regulatory15\nregimes, a small number of changes to the variables, compared with the baseline, were made16\nfor this scenario. According to an EU study [29] biodegradable municipal waste (BMW)17\naccounts for between 60% and 70% of municipal solid waste (MSW) and as such the change18\nin the landfill variable was based on this and the targets identified above. Thus the19\nproportion of MSW going to landfill was adjusted (w\/w) from T1: 48.7%, to T2: 24.4% to20\nfinally T3: 6.1% while the amount processed by other disposal routes increased (w\/w) by T1:21\n26.3%, T2: 50.6%, and T3: 68.9%. The legislative changes did not affect the broader22\neconomic scale variables, which remained the same as for the baseline scenario.23\n24\nA technologically advanced future25\n8This scenario assumes an optimistic future for the UK economy based on sustained economic1\ngrowth, the long-term security of domestic resources and energy supply and technological2\ninnovation that allows resources to be harnessed with increasing resource efficiency.3\nImportantly for modelling this scenario, developments in the new waste technologies are4\nassumed to be moving apace. Technologically advanced and innovative methods for efficient5\nrecycling and recovery become the key solutions to landfill diversion, which is then utilised6\npredominantly used for process residuals and materials with no further use. This is translated7\ninto a series of illustrative changes to the baseline variables presented in Table 2.8\n9\n(insert Table 2)10\n11\n3 Results12\n13\nThe baseline assumptions on resource flow and resulting tonnages of waste flowing through14\nvarious disposal routes in the baseline scenario are presented in Table 3. All other scenarios15\nare discussed against this baseline data set. Where a change in certain variables does not16\nrequire new data, the default values were those adopted in the baseline scenario. These waste17\nmanagement futures are illustrative and somewhat artificial in construct, though they do18\nprovide a valuable basis for discussing future implications below.19\n20\n(insert Table 3)21\n3.1 The baseline scenario22\nPrior to discussing individual scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model was undertaken,23\nillustrating the sensitivity of various model output variables to changes in input data on the24\n9baseline scenario. The key economic parameters were altered in sequence (Table 4),1\nadopting a 10% increase on the baseline value in each case.2\n3\n(insert Table 4)4\n5\nThe dominant parameter and one to which all others were most sensitive, as expected [19],6\nwas DMI input. A 10% increase in DMI generated a change of 642 Mt with the most7\nsignificantly effected parameters being domestic extraction (+100 million tonnes) and TDO8\n(+200 million tonnes). Imports and domestic extraction also exert a direct impact on DHF9\nand FHF. A 10% increase in these parameters exerts significant changes in the other10\nvariables. The sensitivity of individual parameters was low but the overall impact is shown11\nto be significant, as represented by the 295 MT variance for imports and the 596 MT variance12\nfor domestic extraction (Table 4). The variation experienced for imports and domestic13\nextraction are limited since they are directly dependent on DMI. The domestic parameters of14\nNAS, DPO and exports are only influenced by the DMI value. Overall, it is evident that DHF15\nand FHF are extremely sensitive, which is an important observation given their interest here.16\n17\n3.2 The UK runs out of domestic resources18\nHere (Table 5), the main change from the baseline scenario is an increase in foreign hidden19\nflows (940 Mt) resulting from growing imports. In contrast to the baseline, imports and FHF20\ndouble in quantity. Interestingly the FHF now make up 62% of the original DMI and would21\neventually surpass this figure if the trend shown continued. Domestic extraction falls by 46722\nMt, resulting in a total reduction, over T1-T3, of 281 Mt for domestic hidden flows (DHF).23\nAs a result of these impacts the total domestic output (TDO) of the UK increases by 659 Mt24\nwith a total over the three time intervals of 8346 Mt; a 39% increase on the baseline.25\n10\n1\n(insert Table 5)2\n3\n3.3 Legislative changes in the UK4\nThis scenario highlights the changes that occurred through the time period of the model under5\nthis scenario, relative to the baseline. The changes generated by the model are rudimentary6\nand touched on here only briefly. Most critically, with mandatory legislative targets in place,7\nthe amount of municipal waste going to landfill decreases by 68 Mt while other disposals8\nsubsequently increase by 69 Mt [37]. The overall (T1-T3) increased tonnage of wastes9\nthrough other disposal routes, representing that amount diverted from landfill, is 234 Mt over10\nthe T1-T3 period. Inevitably, this raises the issue of how and where to treat the increased11\namounts of biodegradable municipal waste. The UK is already on a strategic trajectory12\ntoward a more technologically advanced future, at least with respect to implementation of the13\nnew waste technologies, and so the key scenario of interest here follows.14\n15\n3.4 A technologically advanced future16\nHere (Table 6), the domestic extraction and net addition to the economic stock (NAS)17\nincreased by the greatest quantity, 640 Mt and 560 Mt respectively, which in turn were 74%18\nand 62% greater than the baseline. This highlights the influence of a growing economy19\ntogether with the presumption of newly obtainable domestic resources. DPO decreases by 9920\nMt, however; the growing DMI acting as a limiting factor. The reduction in FHF is now a21\ndirect result of the decreasing reliance on imported materials. Even though in this scenario22\nthe UK secures domestic resources in the long term and the economy is assumed to grow, the23\nenvironmental impact from TDO is likely to remain. Here, we also assume technological24\nadvancement in implementation of the new waste management technologies (Table 6). These25\n11\nnew technologies are assumed to experience growth over the modelling period with1\nsignificant declines in landfill and other disposal routes at 152 Mt and 246 Mt respectively.2\nThis scenario also assumes a substantive reduction in waste from agriculture and dredgings.3\nThe remaining waste treatments see moderate increases in tonnages treated. Furthermore, the4\ntotal tonnage treated is also reduced relative to the baseline by 497 Mt (30%).5\n6\n4 Discussion7\n8\nThe coding of a rudimentary resource flow model in Excel\u2122 and AMBER\u2122 platforms9\nillustrates that resource flow can be coupled to waste generation and management at the10\nmacro level [37]. Flexibility allows the examination of a wider range of disposal routes over11\ntime, providing the national treatment capacities and statistics are known. There remain data12\ngaps with regard to quantifying hidden flows. As these can have significant impacts on the13\neconomy and environment it is crucial these are well represented in the model. Although the14\nmodel was constructed as closely as possible to the materials cycle represented in Figure 115\n[18, 19], there were areas that were excluded because of their complexity; e.g. the UK\u2019s NAS16\nshould take into account a certain degree of outflow due to end-of-life products and buildings17\nthat are removed from the chain of utility as wastes. Furthermore, the materials cycle18\ndetailed by Matthew et al. [18] included air and water as part of the material flows. Omitting19\nair, whilst acceptable here for the handling of solid wastes flow, may be a critical deviation20\nfrom material flow analysis in a broader context of applications because it distorts the21\naccuracy of carbon counting.22\nGiven these provisos, model improvements are clearly possible. The decay in stock,23\nexcluded from the model could be researched and a reliable figure provided so that an inward24\nflow and outward flow could be attributed to stock giving a more accurate overall picture.25\n12\nSimilarly, the disaggregation of waste by disposal route could also be refined, which we1\nexpect would be particularly useful for local authorities seeking to model future waste2\nmanagement strategies because short falls in available capacity could be identified in this3\nway.4\nCarbon and energy flows are of increasing importance in the waste and resource5\nmanagement sector as Uihlein et al. [30] and Biffaward [15] explain. Developments into6\nthese areas and disaggregating them within the tool, would be of significant use.7\nAdvancements can always be made by improved data to use in the tool. Users will have the8\noption to do this anyway but by improving the underpinning data behind the model\u2019s9\ncalculations the general accuracy and reliability of the tool will be improved. Users could10\nchose to focus on specific waste types such as biodegradable waste or focus on new11\ntechnologies such as pyrolysis, gasification or plasma treatment.12\nThough the socioeconomic scenarios were not produced for their own sake and the13\ngeneral limitations of materials flow accounting apply to this model; i.e. they do not provide14\ninformation on economic development at the business sector level [31], the development of15\nthe tool has still provided insights into alternative development strategies for the UK16\neconomy. The impacts in the depleting-resource scenario will not be restricted to the UK17\n[32]. As these illustrative results have shown, the growth in imports may also increase18\nforeign hidden flows (FHF) and shift the environmental burden of resource extraction abroad.19\nThis is a further component to the issue of hidden flows, already recognised by non-20\ngovernmental organisations seeking to highlight the implications of waste transported21\noverseas for processing in other nations [35]. As the number of trading partners the UK22\nrequires increases, the environmental impacts already occurring in other countries may be23\ncompounded in response to the UK\u2019s higher demands. Unless the trading partners could24\nincrease their extraction efficiency and\/ or process their resources with higher eco-efficiency25\n13\nprior to export, an increase in FHF would occur. Environmental pressures would also1\nincrease in the UK if economic growth continued but in addition to growth the UK\u2019s2\nenvironmental burden would become twofold and expand to that of the trade partners.3\nThe results from the technologically advanced scenario illustrate a positive4\ndevelopment for the UK supporting the analysis of Berkhout et al. [34], who also suggested5\nthat unemployment in a case like this would be low, income would be medium to high, and6\nequity would improve. However, they also pointed to a potential conflict that could arise7\nfrom the change of skills required for such innovation. Nevertheless, of the scenarios8\nexplored in this analysis, this might appear as the ideal path for the UK. The expectation is9\nnow that the UK will develop and use more material- and eco-efficient technologies to10\nsupport the transition to a low carbon future. National, regional and local assessments of11\nhidden flows in the economy [36] will be an important input to informed decisions by the full12\nrange of actors (local authorities, operators, regulators, citizens; [37-39]) on materials13\nmanagement.14\n15\n5 Conclusion16\nIn developing an integrated modelling tool for assessing and specifying the UK\u2019s material17\nand waste flows this research has accomplished its key objective. The modifiable nature of18\nthe parameters in the tool means that specific waste types can be targeted or alternative19\ntechnologies used and for any time period. Thus, the tool can potentially support decision-20\nmaking for resource management as the customisable nature of the model makes it potential21\nvaluable across a full range of scales. Since the model is effectively visualised with built-in22\nvalidity checks it can be fully modified to suit user requirements.23\nThe illustrative scenarios explored here, demonstrate the considerable fluctuations in24\nactual and hidden material flows that can arise from the extremes of reliance on foreign or25\n14\ndomestically extracted materials. Clearly the results are illustrative alone and can not yet, be1\nused to infer actual short term fluctuations, but they can be used to initiate a discussion on the2\ncapacity requirements of the new waste technologies in the UK.3\n4\nReferences5\n6\n[1] Environment Agency, Delivering for the environment, http:\/\/www.environment-7\nagency.gov.uk\/business\/444217\/444661\/571853\/, accessed May 2006.8\n[2] P.
