INTRODUCTION\nIt is more than half a century ago since the publication of the celebrated\npaper by Turing [40] on morphogenesis i.e. the development of patterns,\nshapes and structures found in nature. Turing demonstrated theoretically\nthat a system of two reacting and diffusing chemical concentrations\n(termed morphogens) could give rise to spatial patterns in concentrations\nthrough a chemical instability process, now known as Turing diffusion-\ndriven instability. The novelty of his idea was that by adding diffusion\nto a system of reaction equations with a stable homogeneous steady state\n1 Auburn University, Mathematics Department, 316A Parker Hall, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.\nE-mail: madzva1@auburn.edu\n2 Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24\u201329\nSt Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, UK.\n3 Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford\nOX 13QD, UK.\n247\n0885-7474\/05\/0800-0247\/0 \u00a9 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.\n248 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nsolution, the system could become unstable and evolve to a non-uniform\nspatially varying steady state solution. In most physical systems, diffu-\nsion is by contrast a stabilising mechanism. Typical examples of biological\napplications of reaction\u2013diffusion systems are: pattern formation in hydra\n[12], animal coat markings [27], butterfly wing pigmentation patterns [28],\nskeletal patterning in limb development [21] and shell pigmentation pat-\nterns [22] among many others. Experimental evidence supporting the Tur-\ning instability has been found in chemistry: the chlorite-iodide-malonic\nacid starch reaction (CIMA reaction) was the actual chemical reaction in\nwhich Turing patterns were first observed [8, 11]. Lengyel and Epstein [16],\nproposed a model for this reaction in which the chemical kinetics can be\ndetermined experimentally. It is now known that morphogens exist in biol-\nogy but the whole issue of self-organisation via the Turing instability is\nhighly controversial [4].\nOne of the major criticisms of Turing reaction-diffusion theory for\npattern formation on fixed domains is the sensitivity of the patterns to ini-\ntial conditions and the tight control of model parameter values needed [3].\nHowever, by incorporating domain growth, we have shown that period\ndoubling of patterns can occur [20]. These patterns are insensitive to initial\nconditions thereby enhancing the robustness of pattern selection.\nIn biological species, the role of domain growth in pattern formation\nhas been well illustrated in the paper by Kondo and Asai [14] who show\nexperimentally mode doubling in the circular patterns of the marine angel-\nfish Pomacanthus as it grows. The juvenile Pomacanthus, which is less than\n2 cm long, has three dorsoventral or vertical stripes; however once the fish\ngrows to twice this body length, new stripes emerge between the original\nstripes so that the original wavelength is maintained. Painter et al. [30]\nand Crampin et al. [9] carried out theoretical and computational studies\nof the role of domain growth in pattern generation on regular domains\n(using finite difference schemes for their numerical simulations). However,\ntheir numerical method can not easily describe complicated and continu-\nously deforming shapes. The applicability of the finite element methods to\ncomplicated domains is well known and there is growing realisation that\ncontinuously changing boundaries can be readily handled by moving grid\nimplementations with few changes to the finite element methodology: at\nleast this is true when grid motion is prescribed.\nWe employ the moving grid finite element method in a novel way\nwhich differs substantially from the classical moving finite element method\n[2,23]. The key aspect of the moving finite element method is the assump-\ntion that the solution and the nodal movement are unknown quantities\nwhich have to be solved for simultaneously. In most cases the solution of\nthe partial differential equation and the nodal movement are expanded in\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 249\na piecewise linear finite element approximation space and then the least\nsquares residual is minimised with respect to the time derivatives of the\ntwo unknown quantities. This method thus yields both the solution and\nthe nodal movement simultaneously and directly in terms of the physi-\ncal coordinates. However, the method requires regularisation to cope with\npotential singularities arising from the double minimisation of the solu-\ntion and the nodal movement. Also crucially important is that mesh tan-\ngling is a real possibility and this could greatly reduce applicability. Our\nmethod however differs in that nodal movement is experimentally defined.\nThis is a key advantage in that mesh tangling is therefore not an issue in\nour numerical computations. The mesh movement and the time discretisa-\ntion of the PDE are intrinsically coupled. The boundary is deformed con-\ntinuously in some prescribed fashion (in most cases to mimic biological\nexperiments) and the internal mesh movement is achieved either via a spe-\ncific definition or in some cases, where no such definition exists, via the\nspring analogy described by Blom [5].\nIn Sec. 2 we illustrate one derivation of reaction\u2013diffusion systems on\na continuously deforming domain. The model equations derived are solved\nvia a moving grid finite element method by use of piecewise linear basis\nfunctions in two dimensions as shown in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 we illustrate the\napplication of the numerical method by computing numerical results on\na continuously deforming square domain. Through a specific example we\nshow computationally how period doubling of spots occurs with domain\ngrowth. Finally in Sec. 5 we present conclusions and some future direc-\ntions in this research.\n2. DERIVATION OF REACTION\u2013DIFFUSION EQUATIONS\nON A CONTINUOUSLY DEFORMING DOMAIN\nLet \u2126(t) \u2282 R2 be a simply connected bounded growing domain at\ntime t \u0001 0 with its growing boundary \u2202\u2126(t). Also let u (x(t), y(t), t) and\nv (x(t), y(t), t) be the concentrations of two chemicals, known as morpho-\ngens, at position (x(t), y(t))\u2208\u2126(t) \u2282R2 at time t \u0001 0.1 Consider chemical\nconcentration u (similarly for v), say. According to the law of mass\nbalance, at time t\u00010, the rate of change of the chemical u in \u2126(t) is equal\nto the sum of its net flux, F1, through the boundary \u2202\u2126(t) and the net pro-\nduction, f1, of the chemical within the domain. Therefore by the Diver-\ngence Theorem we have\nd\ndt\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\nu (x(t), y(t), t) d\u2126(t) =\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\n\u2212\u2207.F1 +f1(u, v)\n)\nd\u2126(t), (2.1)\n1This can be generalised to the case of n >2 chemicals.\n250 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nwhere we take into account the limits of integration which are time depen-\ndent. The differential operator can not be passed through the integral\nstraight away since the limits of integration are functions of time. We will\nrefer to the grid deformation of a domain in analogy with a flowing fluid\nwith the aim of preserving the classical terminology [9]. The Reynolds\ntransport theorem states that\nd\ndt\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\nG (x(t), y(t), t) d\u2126(t) =\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\nDG\nDt\n+G(\u2207.a)\n)\nd\u2126(t) (2.2)\nfor any scalar or vector function G(x(t), y(t), t) (see, for example [1]).\nHere DG\/Dt is the material derivative of G and it represents the rate of\nchange of G following the fluid, and a (x(t), y(t), t) is the flow velocity\nfield i.e.\nDG\nDt\n= \u2202G\n\u2202t\n+a.\u2207G. (2.3)\nApplying the Reynolds transport theorem to Eq. (2.1) we have\nd\ndt\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\nu (x(t), y(t), t) d\u2126(t) =\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\nDu\nDt\n+u (\u2207.a)\n)\nd\u2126(t)\n=\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+a.\u2207u+u (\u2207.a)\n)\nd\u2126(t)\n=\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(au)\n)\nd\u2126(t)\n=\n\u222b\n\u2126(t)\n(\n\u2212\u2207.F1 +f1(u, v)\n)\nd\u2126(t). (2.4)\nThis holds for any arbitrary domain \u2126(t) and the integrands are continu-\nous so we have\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(au)=\u2212\u2207.F1 +f1(u, v). (2.5)\nAssuming that the chemical flux of u follows Fick\u2019s law: F1 = \u2212D1 \u2207u,\nthen (2.5) becomes\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(au)=f1(u, v)+D1 \u22072u, (2.6)\nand similarly for v we have\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(a v)=f2(u, v)+D2 \u22072v. (2.7)\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 251\nHere, we have presented a general framework for considering domain\ngrowth which will allow for subsequent inclusion of a detailed descrip-\ntion of the properties of specific tissues. The derivation is considered as a\nkinematic problem and no constitutive equations are proposed. It is sim-\nply assumed that the domain undergoes deformation and expansion result-\ning in the convection of material [10]. Combining (2.6) and (2.7) in vector\nform we obtain:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(a : u)= f(u)+D\u22072u, (2.8)\nwhere a :u= (au,a v)T . One form of non-dimensionalisation [26] leads to\nthe generalised reaction\u2013diffusion system\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(a : u)=\u03b3 f(u)+D\u22072u in \u2126(t) (2.9)\nwith \u2126(t) representing a time-dependent domain. In some situations the\nreaction term \u03b3 f(u) can be re-defined and more helpfully be written as\n\u03b3 f(u)+P3(u) which leads to\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\u2207.(a : u)=\u03b3 f(u)+P3(u)+D\u22072u in \u2126(t), (2.10)\nwhere P3(u) = (p3(u, v), q3(u, v))T with p3, q3 being cubic polynomials\n[17]. We define\nu=\n(\nu\nv\n)\n, f =\n(\nf (u, v)\ng(u, v)\n)\n, D=\n(\nDu 0\n0 Dv\n)\n, and x= (x(t), y(t)) ,\nwhere u , v are the two chemical concentrations under investigation, f , g ,\np3 , q3 are reaction kinetics. D is the diffusion matrix (Du and Dv\nare constant diffusion parameters) and \u03b3 is a scale parameter [26]. In\nMadzvamuse et al. [17] typical classical reaction kinetics are presented,\nincluding the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt [12], the Thomas [38] and the Schnaken-\nberg [35] models. In this paper we use only the Schnakenberg reaction\nkinetics with P3(u)=0 and\nf (u, v)=a\u2212u+u2 v,\ng(u, v)=b\u2212u2 v. (2.11)\nBoundary conditions can be of Dirichlet type or of (homogeneous)\nNeumann type which describe zero-flux of u (or v) out of the boundary.\nInitial conditions are prescribed as small random perturbations about the\nuniform homogeneous steady state of the corresponding reaction systems.\n252 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\n3. THE MOVING GRID FINITE ELEMENT METHOD\nFollowing Madzvamuse et al. [17], let w \u2208H 1(\u2126(t)) be a test func-\ntion. Multiplying the u component in Eq. (2.10) by w leads to the follow-\ning problem:\n(ut +\u2207.(au),w)=\u03b3 (f,w)+Du (\u22072u,w) (3.1)\nfor all w\u2208H 1(\u2126(t)) where\n(u,w)=\n\u222b \u222b\n\u2126(t)\nuw dx (3.2)\nis the L2-inner product. Assuming that homogeneous Neumann boundary\nconditions are used, by Green\u2019s Theorem equation (3.1) reduces to finding\nu\u2208H 1(\u2126(t)) such that\n(ut +\u2207.(au),w)=\u03b3 (f,w)\u2212Du (\u2207u,\u2207w) (3.3)\nfor all w\u2208H 1(\u2126(t)). Here\na= (x\u02d9 , y\u02d9)T (3.4)\nrepresents the grid velocity. Therefore, we seek to find a solution u \u2208\nH 1(\u2126(t)) such that\n(ut ,w)+\n(\nx\u02d9 ux + y\u02d9 uy,w\n)+ (u\u2207.a,w)=\u03b3 (f,w)\u2212Du (\u2207u,\u2207w) (3.5)\nfor all w \u2208H 1(\u2126(t)). Let uh be a moving grid finite element approxima-\ntion to u defined by\nuh =\nn\u2211\nj=1\nUj(t) \u03c6j (x, \u03be(t)), (3.6)\nwhere \u03be(t) represents the finite element moving grid. Then the moving grid\nfinite element approximation seeks to find uh \u2208V h \u2282H 1 such that\n(\nuht ,w\n)\n+\n(\nx\u02d9 uhx + y\u02d9 uhy,w\n)\n+\n(\nuh \u2207.a,w\n)\n=\u03b3 (f,w)\u2212Du\n(\n\u2207uh,\u2207w\n)\n(3.7)\nfor all w\u2208V h \u2282H 1(\u2126(t)). The time-derivative of (3.6) can be expressed in\ntwo dimensions as [7,13]\n\u2202uh\n\u2202t\n=\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\ndUj\ndt\n\u2212 x\u02d9j uhx \u2212 y\u02d9j uhy\n)\n\u03c6j (x, \u03be(t)). (3.8)\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 253\nWithout loss of generality, taking the test function to be w = \u03c6i , i =\n1, . . . , n, the above equation can be written as follows:\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\ndUj\ndt\n(\n\u03c6j ,\u03c6i\n)\u2212(x\u02d9j uhx \u03c6j + y\u02d9j uhy \u03c6j , \u03c6i\n)\n+\n(\nx\u02d9j u\nh\nx + y\u02d9j uhy, \u03c6i\n)\n+\u2207.a (\u03c6j ,\u03c6i) Uj\n)\n=\u2212Du\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\u2207\u03c6j ,\u2207\u03c6i)+\u03b3 (f,\u03c6i) (3.9)\nfor all i =1,2, . . . , n. Similarly for vh we have\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\ndVj\ndt\n(\n\u03c6j ,\u03c6i\n)\u2212(x\u02d9j vhx \u03c6j + y\u02d9j vhy \u03c6j , \u03c6i\n)\n+\n(\nx\u02d9j v\nh\nx + y\u02d9j vhy , \u03c6i\n)\n+\u2207.a (\u03c6j ,\u03c6i) Vj\n)\n=\u2212Dv\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\u2207\u03c6j ,\u2207\u03c6i)+\u03b3 (g,\u03c6i) . (3.10)\nIntegrating over the whole domain gives rise to the following system of\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations:\nM U\u02d9\u2212(P +Q)U+ (U\u00afx + U\u00afy) U+\u2207.aM U=\u2212Du K U+\u03b3 F(U,V), (3.11)\nM V\u02d9\u2212(P +Q)V+ (V\u00afx + V\u00afy) V+\u2207.aM V=\u2212Dv K V+\u03b3 G(U,V), (3.12)\nwhere M is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix, and P , Q, U\u00afx ,\nU\u00afy, V\u00afx , V\u00afy are resultant matrices from domain growth. The terms F(U,V)\nand G(U,V) represent matrices derived from the nonlinear reaction kinet-\nics. For example, for the Schnakenberg reaction kinetics (2.11) we have the\nfollowing:\nF(U,V)=a F\u2212M U+C(U,V), (3.13)\nG(U,V)=bF\u2212C(U,U)V, (3.14)\nwhere M is the mass matrix as before, F is the force vector and C(U,V)\nis the linearised matrix from the u2 v term. Specific details of the integra-\ntions that give rise to these matrices can be found in Madzvamuse [20].\nIn all our simulations \u2207.a is calculated from plausible growth func-\ntions or those derived from biological experiments and therefore is a\nknown quantity (for example, see Sec. 4 for specific details). Finally we\ncan re-write the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in\ncompact form as follows:\nM U\u02d9+Du K U=\n(\nP +Q\u2212 U\u00afx \u2212 U\u00afy \u2212\u2207.aM\n)\nU+\u03b3 F(U,V), (3.15)\n254 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nM V\u02d9+Dv K V=\n(\nP +Q\u2212 V\u00afx \u2212 V\u00afy \u2212\u2207.aM\n)\nV+\u03b3 G(U,V). (3.16)\n3.1. Time-stepping\nWe have developed a variety of time-stepping methods to cater for\ndifferent types of solutions to Eqs. (3.15) and (3.16). If the solutions\nare highly oscillatory with steep gradients, it becomes necessary to use\nhigher order time-stepping schemes [32]. However for solutions with low\nfrequencies such as those in this paper we implement a Picard Iteration\nmethod coupled with an Implicit Backward Euler finite difference scheme.\nThis method allows us to take bigger time-steps than even those required\nfor higher order time-stepping schemes. All the results in this paper are\nobtained by using this method. Also in all our simulations we use a fixed\nconstant time step \u2206t . From a biological point of view, growth occurs on\na very slow time-scale and hence it is plausible to assume that the differ-\nence between the transient solutions between two successive computational\ngrids is negligible. This makes it possible to linearise the nonlinear terms\nin the reaction kinetics by assuming that the term U2, for example, can be\nwritten as a product of UmUm+1 where Um is the known solution calcu-\nlated from the previous time m\u2206t . At each time-step we do not need to\napply a fixed iteration but simply use a single fixed iteration step. In previ-\nous work we have found this to be sufficient [17]. Once linearised the set\nof linear algebraic equations obtained are solved using a Preconditioned\nGeneralised Minimum Residual Method. Preconditioners such as ILU(0),\nILUT, ILUTP, ILUK and MILU(0) can be used with the method [33,34].\nHowever, in all our simulations we have found that the simple ILU(0) pre-\nconditioner is adequate.\n4. TWO-DIMENSIONAL MOVING GRID FINITE ELEMENT\nRESULTS\nIn this section, we show results for a given growth function. Let\nx(t)= (X(0) r(t), Y (0) s(t)) (4.1)\ndefine the grid movement where X(0) and Y (0) represent the initial x and\ny coordinates at time t =0. The functions r(t) and s(t) specify the rate of\ngrowth of the initial grid and satisfy r(0)= s(0)= 1 and r(t), s(t) > 0 for\nall positive time. Differentiating\nx\u02d9 =X(0) r\u02d9(t), y\u02d9 =Y (0) s\u02d9(t) (4.2)\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 255\nand from Eq. (4.1) we have\nX(0)= x\nr(t)\n, Y (0)= y\ns(t)\n(4.3)\nso that\nx\u02d9 = x\nr(t)\nr\u02d9(t), y\u02d9 = y\ns(t)\ns\u02d9(t). (4.4)\nComputing these relations with (3.4) we deduce that\n\u2207.a= r\u02d9(t)\nr(t)\n+ s\u02d9(t)\ns(t)\n. (4.5)\nHere we illustrate results for the exponential growth\nr(t)= s(t)= e\u03c1 t . (4.6)\nLet us consider typical two-dimensional transient solutions for the\nSchnakenberg reaction kinetics with model parameter values a = 0.1,\nb = 0.9, \u03b3 = 1.0, Du = 1.0 and Dv = 0.01. Figures 1\u20133 show results\nobtained by use of the exponential growth (4.6) with growth rate \u03c1=10\u22125.\nHomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are applied to both chemi-\ncal concentrations u and v. Initial conditions are prescribed as small ran-\ndom perturbations around the homogeneous steady state (1.0,0.9) in the\nform of:\nu=1.0\u00b110\u22123 cos\n(\n14\u03c0 x\n2\n)\n, (4.7)\nv=0.9\u00b110\u22123 cos\n(\n14\u03c0 x\n2\n)\n. (4.8)\nThe initial mesh is computed using a Delaunay mesh generator software\n[25]. The mesh connectivity remains constant throughout the growth of\nthe domain, mesh points are not added or removed during the growth pro-\ncess. All the numerical simulations are carried out on a typical mesh of\napproximately 4000 elements with approximately 2000 nodes. A fixed time\nstep of \u2206t = 0.025 is used. The results obtained are independent of the\nstructure of the mesh\u2014regular and irregular meshes yield similar results.\nSimilar results have also been obtained with finer meshes. The transient\nprocess settles down very quickly to being independent of initial condi-\ntions providing they are small perturbations about the uniform steady\nstate. By incorporating growth, the final solutions obtained are robust to\n256 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nFig. 1. Transient patterns generated by the Schnakenberg model as the unit square is grown\nalong the diagonal line x = y in the positive direction with growth rate (4.6). A spot pattern\nre-organises evolving to the centre of the square as the domain grows. Results shown corre-\nspond to the chemical concentration u: the v concentration profiles are 180-degrees out of\nphase with the u profiles.\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 257\nFig. 2. Continuation of the simulation in Fig. 1. With further growth, the spot pattern\nenlarges in size and stretches along the diagonal to form a diagonal stripe pattern. This in\nturn splits into two. The spots align diagonally in the same fashion and split once more\nforming four spots. We observe that the spot doubled into two spots and then further dou-\nbles into four spots as the domain grows so that the side length is approximately twice that\nfor the case when there is a single spot.\n258 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nFig. 3. Continuation of the simulation in Fig. 2. The spots re-oriente to form a symmet-\nrical pattern as the domain reaches approximately four times the size of the unit square.\nFinally we observe how eight spots are going to be formed with continuous growth of the\nsquare. Different random initial conditions have been applied without change in the numeri-\ncal results, one realization of which is shown here.\nMoving Grid Finite Element Method 259\ninitial conditions. In this case domain growth enhances the robust selec-\ntion of patterning. These results agree with theoretical results derived by\nCrampin and others where they carried out studies on period doubling,\npeak insertion and splitting [9]. Period doubling of spots as the domain\napproximately doubles in size is observed as the domain grows. Interest-\ning is the observation that a diagonal stripe (i) is first achieved before\nthis splits into two spots (j). These in turn split into four spots which\nre-organise into a symmetrical pattern with further growth (l)\u2212 (q). The\nlast picture shows how eight spots are going to be formed from four spots\nas the domain continues to grow (r). Although these results are only for\nillustrative purposes, from a biological point of view, period doubling of\ncircular patterns is an interesting phenomenon and has been observed in\nthe marine angelfish Pomacanthus [14].\nWe have illustrated results on growing two-dimensional squares, results\non other polygons such as equilateral triangles, isosceles triangles, hexago-\nnal and on irregular polygonal domains are shown in Madzvamuse et al.\n[17]. In all our simulations we observe numerical results that are indepen-\ndent of initial conditions.\n5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\nExperimentally it has been observed that domain growth plays a\ncrucial role in the emergence of patterns in biological species (see, for\nexample [14]). It is convenient to couple domain growth with reaction\u2013\ndiffusion systems and apply in a novel fashion the moving grid finite\nelement method. This method differs from the classical moving finite ele-\nment method [2,23] in that domain growth is prescribed, in most cases\nto mimic biological experiments. Although we have illustrated numerical\nresults with a defined growth function (4.6) whereby the mesh velocity is\nprescribed throughout the domain, in some biological problems growth\nfunctions are unknown. Instead experiments provide discrete frames of\ndomain growth and shape changes. For this nontrivial case, it becomes\nconvenient to apply a spring analogy to calculate automatically the nodal\npositions of the internal mesh [5].\nThe phenomenon we observe of spot doubling on a growing domain\nis very similar to the process of self-replicating spots observed in compu-\ntations on a fixed domain [31] and later experimentally [15].\nWe have found that in all our simulations transient solution on con-\ntinuously growing domains are independent of initial conditions. In this\npaper we have shown a novel application of the moving grid finite element\ntechnique to solving a system of reaction-diffusion equations on a contin-\nuously growing domain. Intriguingly, we find that by using a finite differ-\n260 Madzvamuse, Maini, and Wathen\nence approach to this problem the mode doubling transitions occur in a\ndifferent sequence (Madzvamuse, in preparation). We believe that this may\noccur because the underlying model equations exhibit multiple solutions.\nThis warrants further numerical and analytic investigation.\nAs part of this research we have developed a computer software pack-\nage that can solve generalised Turing reaction\u2013diffusion systems on con-\ntinuously deforming one- and two-dimensional domains. This software has\nbeen applied to the study of growth patterns in bivalve ligaments [18,39],\nand on fixed domains to color pattern formation in the butterfly wing\nPapilio dardanus [19,29,36]. We are currently computing patterns on grow-\ning imginal wing discs of butterflies.
