In the context of such an \napproach, and also taking account of academic discourse, this article draws \nupon interviews with nearly thirty individuals in leadership positions in local \nauthorities in England, Scotland and Wales to assess their experiences of \nleadership and their views of some aspects of the role and work of councils. It \nsuggests that whilst there is broad convergence between the aspirations of \ngovernment and the narratives that emerge from these leaders on some aspects \nof local political leadership, there are also differences, perhaps most notably \nover the relationship between changes to decision making structures and the loci \nof political power. \n \nFollowing significant structural and other reforms of local government under the \nConservative governments of 1979 to 1997, the past decade has seen central government \nplacing a great deal of emphasis upon the \u2018modernisation\u2019 of local government. In England \nthere have been a number of aspects to these reforms including: new council constitutions and \ndecision making structures (leader and cabinet models, or in some cases directly elected \nmayors) based upon the separation of executive and representative or scrutiny functions, \nintended to provide a clearer linkage of individuals to policy making and outcomes; \nperformance management and enhancement (Best Value, Comprehensive Performance \nAssessment and Beacon Councils); an emphasis upon \u2018community leadership\u2019, particularly in \na host of new partnership arrangements (such as Local Area Agreements); and the promotion \nof citizen participation. These changes have been underpinned by the view that local \ngovernment has been inefficient in providing services and unresponsive to the needs of its \ncitizens, by falling electoral participation, by the continued importance of local government in \nthe delivery of public services, and by a desire for both stronger community leadership (and at \nthe same time involvement in networks and partnership) and for stronger and more \nindividualised leadership of local authorities (for example, Lowndes and Leach, 2004; Laffin, \n2008; Rao, 2006). Whilst the government has tended to utilise terms such as \u2018leaders\u2019 and \n\u2018leadership\u2019 to describe its vision of the role of councils within their communities as well as \nto the political and managerial leadership of individual authorities, it is the elected political \nleadership within councils that is the concern of this article. \n \nThe role of local political leadership has been a key element of the modernisation agenda at \nthe local level, with the government arguing, for example, that \u2018Whatever the causes, the \nGovernment believes that the failure to maximise the potential of locally elected \nrepresentatives to act in a leadership role as advocates and champions of local communities is \na major obstacle to our ambitions for civil renewal and improved public services\u2019 (ODPM, \n2005: 13). The government has clearly linked what it sees as a lack of visible leadership with \nproblems of accountability, including through the assumptions that the public know little \nabout how councils make decisions, or who to complain to or how to hold them to account \nwhen there are problems, so that the question of leadership has been viewed in tandem with \nthat of political structures (Orr, 2004). The separation of decision making and scrutiny roles, \nand the attempts to encourage elected mayors, for example, were intended to respond to this \nperception. In the rest of the United Kingdom the devolved administrations have \nresponsibility for local government, and the pattern of change has been somewhat different, \nso that in Scotland, for example, greater attention has arguably been paid to reforms to the \nelectoral system for local government, with the introduction of the single transferable vote \nsystem for council elections from May 2007, although a number of councils have adopted a \nleader and cabinet model. \n \nIf discourses inform the ways in which policies and solutions are conceived (Bacchi, 1999) \nand also provide legitimacy for particular approaches or forms of decision making (Newman, \n2001) then they are potentially of significant importance in analyses of policy making and \npower relations. A number of authors have examined the discourse of New Labour\u2019s \nmodernisation generally (for example, Newman, 2001) and in relation to local government, \neither directly or indirectly (for example, Coulson, 2004; Orr, 2005). It is also possible to \nidentify a number of key elements of the government\u2019s discourse around modernisation and \npolitical leadership, including the assertions that leadership should be \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018visible\u2019, \nand that councillors as a whole should be more diverse and representative of their \ncommunities. For example, the government has continued to emphasise that it wishes to see \nmore visible local leadership, and Chapter 3 of the White Paper for England, Strong and \nProsperous Communities, included headings such as \u2018More diverse and representative \ncouncillors\u2019, \u2018Councillors as democratic champions\u2019, and \u2018Stronger leadership\u2019, all views \nwhich recur frequently as part of the New Labour discourse around local government. Under \nthe latter heading, the White Paper stated that \u2018The Government believes that it is important \nthat councils move towards having more stable and more visible political leadership. Our \nresearch shows that leadership is the single most significant driver of change and \nimprovement in local authorities\u2019(DCLG, 2006: 55) and contained a promise to legislate to \nintroduce three models of executive arrangement: a directly elected mayor with a four year \nterm; a directly elected executive with a four year term; or an indirectly elected leader with a \nfour year term. In each of these models the government stated that \u2018all executive powers will \nbe vested in the mayor or leader\u2019 (DCLG, 2006: 55), making that leadership position even \nmore important. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 \nenshrined these proposals in legislation and these narratives of reform were again evident in \nthe government\u2019s most recent statements on the subject, Strong and Prosperous Communities \n\u2013 The Local Government White Paper Implementation Plan: One Year On (DCLG, 2007), \nCreating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities: Statutory Guidance (DCLG, 2008) and \nStrong and prosperous communities \u2013 The Local Government White Paper: Final \nimplementation plan (DCLG, 2009).  \n \nHowever, whilst it may be possible to identify the consistent framing of ideas about the role \nand operation of local government in this manner by the government, as Newman notes, \ndifferent narratives, assumptions and expectations are likely to coexist, and to create \n\u2018particularly strong tensions during programmes of reform as deeply embedded institutional \nnorms and rules are challenged by new logics of appropriate action, but no new \u201crules of the \ngame\u201d have yet been established in practice\u2019 (2001: 30-1). One of the questions raised by this \narticle is, therefore, the extent to which the discourse of central government aligns with or \ndiffers from that among local political leaders who are the subject of much of it.  \n \nLocal political leadership has been the focus of an increasingly substantial academic literature \nin recent years, within which in turn, a number of distinctive narratives can be identified, and \nthe next section briefly reviews some of this, national and international, before the article \nmoves on to draw upon in-depth, largely qualitative interviews, conducted face-to-face or by \ntelephone, with twenty-nine individuals in the second half of 2006. Twenty-one were council \nleaders or directly-elected mayors and eight were members of cabinets or executives. While \nnot intended to constitute a representative sample, they were drawn from a variety of types of \nauthorities (English districts, counties, unitary authorities and London boroughs, Scottish \ncouncils and Welsh councils) with different decision making structures, a variety of forms of \npolitical control, and a range of political parties (and Independents). The research sought to \nreveal the views of respondents on some of the challenges facing local political leaders \nfollowing \u2018modernisation\u2019. The article analyses their responses in the context of the \ndiscourses outlined above and concludes with a consideration of how and to what extent these \ndifferent narratives of local political leadership fit together. \n \n \nLOCAL POLITICAL LEADERSHIP \n \nGiven that interest and developments around leadership at the local level have been relatively \nwidespread in Europe in recent years, it is unsurprising that there has been the emergence of a \nconsiderable literature examining these changes, including of a comparative nature. As with \ngovernment policy, it is possible to examine the academic discourse, and Orr (2004 and 2005) \nsuggests that there have been different academic narratives of local government change \n(including the extent to which they are normative and\/or analytical), such as those that \nemphasise continuity between Conservative and New Labour governments and those that \nfocus upon the rhetoric of \u2018partnership\u2019, as well as narratives emerging from within local \ngovernment.  \n \nOne important element of the literature is that which reflects the shift to \u2018governance\u2019 and a \ngreater emphasis upon the role of local political leaders. Borraz and John, for example, \nsuggest that with the shift to \u2018governance\u2019, \u2018Leadership is crucial to the functioning and \nsuccess of local governance\u2019 (2004: 112). They note four, not necessarily incompatible, \nhypotheses that have been put forward to explain changes in local political executives in \nmuch of Western Europe, with the promotion of stronger styles of leadership and local \nexecutive functions: firstly, some have seen strong leadership to be a functional response to \nthe institutional fragmentation that characterises urban politics; secondly, the new structures \ncan be seen as reflecting changing values among elites and citizens; thirdly, the move towards \nstronger local leadership can be seen as providing ideas and models for local elites in the face \nof increasing powers of the European Union; and fourthly, some form of institutional \nmimetism or transfer has seen different institutions adopt similar forms in response to the \nconcerns of citizens and policy makers at higher levels of government. \n \nHowever, whilst each of these hypotheses may have some relevance, they suggest that none \nare entirely convincing on the basis of the evidence available, and suggest instead three \ngeneral features, each of which might arguably be said to apply to the position in the United \nKingdom, and each of which might be seen as fitting with the discourse of central \ngovernment: the shift towards stronger leadership \u2018is first and foremost a response to \nparticular expressions of the \u2018legitimacy crisis\u2019 occurring in local and national politics as \nexpressed by lower electoral turnout and the failure of traditional mechanisms of political \naccountability\u2019 (2004: 108); even if they have increased legitimacy and electoral power, \nchanges in most countries have rarely enhanced the powers of local leaders; \u2018local leaders \nvary in their capacity to manage large and complex networks, sets of issues and interest \ngroups\u2019 (2004: 108). \n \nHaus and Sweeting also note that leadership is closely linked with issues of local governance, \nwith multi-actor networks seeking to address social problems, thus reflecting narratives \naround the role of leadership and partnership arrangements. They differentiate between \nleadership practices (\u2018systematic attempts to enable collective action\u2019) and leadership \npositions (\u2018characterised by institutional provisions of resources and expectations\u2019). As with \nthe discourse that emerges from government, they emphasise the role of leaders, so that \n\u2018Although leadership need not be restricted to the incumbents of formal leadership positions, \nthese positions are of crucial importance. They link fluid and innovative processes to formal \ninstitutions with clearer lines of accountability \u2013 and, of course, they give leaders control over \nconsiderable resources in the construction of governance arrangements and in the \ntransformation of local government institutions\u2019 (2006: 270). \n \nThe appeal of a narrative of \u2018strong leadership\u2019 for governments is further reflected in the \nwork of Mouritzen and Svara (2002), who have argued that it is the form of government that \ndetermines the nature of local political leadership, with strong mayors giving the most active \nforms of leadership, and Goldsmith and Larsen, who suggest that in systems \u2018where the leader \nof the main political party acts as mayor or council leader, the position provides room for \nstrong minded individuals to exploit their role if they so choose\u2019 (2004: 128-9). \n \nWollmann\u2019s work too reflects many of the ideas raised in the government\u2019s discourse, \nsuggesting that reform debates across Europe have been driven by concerns to address \ncriticisms of the lack of transparency and accountability within local government, reflected in \nfalling electoral turnout, and because local government is seen as \u2018less and less capable of \ncoping with evermore complex and wicked social, economic and environmental issues and \nchallenges\u2019 (2008: 280). \n \nIn the United Kingdom, Gains et al have argued that the changing social and economic \nenvironment and the emergence of a networked form of governance is seeing the emergence \nof \u2018facilitative leadership\u2019 which \u2018is not about the direct exercise of detailed influence or \ncontrol over decision making, but rather about giving direction and then mobilizing the \nresources necessary to ensure that the vision is fulfilled (2007: 12). They also suggest that \nwhilst all three executive models chosen by the government may improve the efficiency of \ndecision making, the mayoral model is most likely to deliver \u2018facilitative leadership which \nembraces partnership, is accessible, non partisan and more efficient\u2019 (2007: 44), again, very \nmuch in line with the government\u2019s discourse. \n \nHowever, there are also alternative narratives which do not align so closely with those \nemerging from government. For example, Steyvers et al (2008) raise two questions about the \ntransition to stronger executive leadership. Firstly, they ask to what extent attempts to \nstrengthen the executive institutionally actually lead to stronger leadership in practice, and of \nparticular relevance for this article, to what extent do local leaders adapt to such a new role, \nsuggesting that \u2018it is likely that many leaders still struggle with the challenges these role \ntransformations bring\u2019 (Steyvers et al, 2008: 143). \n \nLowndes and Leach have argued that the structure-led approach to political leadership taken \nin the Westminster government\u2019s reforms \u2018has not proved wholly effective as a basis for \nintroducing the \u2018ideal type\u2019 of leadership favoured by the government\u2019 (2004: 559). Similarly, \ndrawing upon a variety of other work, Leach et al suggest that there are four key elements of \nleadership: leadership context, with both local and national influences; leadership tasks, \nincluding maintaining political support and developing strategic policy directions; leadership \nskills and capabilities; and leadership effectiveness, again influenced by both local and \nnational agendas. Their research highlighted the range of influences and roles played by \nleaders, and the diversity of approaches to leadership, and suggested that from a structuralist \nperspective the new decision making structures \u2018have so far proved less decisive an influence \non political leadership than would have been forecast\u2019 and that \u2018Context and personal \ncapabilities have been equally influential, often more so\u2019 (2005: 68). They note that the \nwishes that are highlighted in the government\u2019s discourse, including for leaders who are \nstrong and visible, an emphasis upon external networking and community networking, and a \nfocus on the strategic agenda, had not been fulfilled. For Leach et al, effective local authority \npolitical leadership can be characterised \u2018by the ability to achieve synergy between two \nseparate agendas \u2013 the political and the managerial\u2019 (Leach et al, 2005: 73) and they argue \nthat the government\u2019s continuing emphasis on \u2018strong\u2019 leadership is both too narrow and \nbased upon a view of leadership that is divorced from the variety of contexts and the \nconsequent leadership responses. \n \nAnother perspective comes from Copus, who has examined directly elected mayors in \nEngland, noting that directly elected mayors can challenge the dominance of party, both in \nrespect of weakening the ties between the mayor and the party, and in seeking alliances and \nsupport for issues beyond the confines of party. However, he has also suggested that while \nmayors may have arisen from changes in political structures, they do not change the power, \nroles and responsibilities of the council, so that, at present \u2018English mayors are of the weak \nvariety and direct election provides little more than a new route into the top political position \non the council\u2019 (2004: 18). \n \nLeach and Wilson (2008) too have highlighted the undermining of the power of local party \ngroups (and indeed local parties) and the increasing power of the leader that has arisen from \nthe government\u2019s desire for strong, visible leaders, rather than for collective approaches to \ndecision making. A survey of councillors in forty local authorities in England by Rao (2005) \nalso showed the extent of divisions over the power of the leader in the new system, with 46 \nper cent agreeing that the leader should decide who is in the cabinet, but 43 per cent \ndisagreeing; 60 per cent felt that the leader should have the power to allocate portfolios, but \n26 per cent disagreed; and only 12 per cent felt that the leader should decide on policies, with \n75 per cent disagreeing. \n \nThis brief overview demonstrates that there is a significant strand within academic work on \nleadership and local government that fits well with the discourse of government since 1997 \naround strong leadership, including in relation to increasing accountability and legitimacy, \nand the need to be able to make and shape decisions in a complex economic and social \nenvironment. However, at the same time, and potentially reflecting alternative narratives from \nwithin local government, there are those that suggest that the government\u2019s approach is not \nunproblematic, for example with regard to the relationship between leadership and decision \nmaking structures. These academic debates serve to highlight some of the challenges and \ntensions that have been faced by the government in its promotion of \u2018strong leadership\u2019 and \nother elements of its modernisation agenda. The remainder of this article examines elements \nof the narratives that emerged from interviews with those in positions of political leadership \nin local authorities and the degree of fit, or otherwise, with those that have emerged from \ngovernment. \n \n \nLEADERS\u2019 NARRATIVES  \n \nLeadership style and structures \n \nGiven the emphasis on \u2018strong leadership\u2019 in the government\u2019s narratives of reform and \nagenda for modernisation, including legislation, one of the areas of interest for this research \nwas in the ways in which local political leaders perceive themselves as exercising leadership. \nInterestingly, among interviewees by far the most commonly used (unprompted) description \nof their leadership style was \u2018inclusive\u2019, used by nearly two-thirds, and this was followed by \n\u2018consensual\u2019, used by around half of respondents, while a number of others also used the term \n\u2018transparent\u2019. These descriptions were used irrespective of party or type of authority, so that \nthe Conservative leader of a county council who described themselves, in a close fit with the \nlanguage frequently used by government, as a \u2018strong, visible leader\u2019 was in a very small \nminority.  \n \nWhilst the political make-up of councils inevitably impacted upon the ways in which leaders \nsaw themselves as operating (\u2018I believe in consensus. We do not have a whip. On a hung \ncouncil you cannot do things confrontationally anyway; you need to discuss things\u2019 \n(Conservative, district council)) even leaders from majority groups chose to describe \nthemselves as inclusive and consensual. In addition, these words were often used in \nconjunction with comparisons with their predecessors, either of different parties, such as, \n\u2018Officers have commented that this administration is less dictatorial than the previous\u2019 \n(Liberal Democrat, Welsh council), or the same party. \n \nHowever, despite the different language used by leaders compared with that from central \ngovernment, and whilst a number clearly felt uncomfortable with their perception of what the \ngovernment had been seeking, \u2018strong leadership\u2019 is not necessarily incompatible with \ninclusive and consensual styles of leadership and decision making, and some respondents \nclearly identified with such a view, for example suggesting that \u2018I am more inclusive than the \nprevious leader, less confrontational and more consensual. But I am willing to have conflict \nand make tough decisions\u2019 (Conservative, county council). Indeed, expressions of being \nconsensual and inclusive were sometimes combined with assertions of leadership that came \nclose to the language used by the government (\u2018Inclusive\u2026 consensual \u2013 we have never had a \nvote in cabinet\u2026 [but] I do have strong opinions and express them\u2019 (Labour, London \nborough) and a willingness \u2018to make tough decisions\u2019, with words such as \u2018tough\u2019, strong\u2019 \nand \u2018assertive\u2019 being used, albeit much less frequently than \u2018consensual\u2019 and \u2018inclusive\u2019. \n \nSeveral leaders observed that they felt an element of accountability and responsibility in their \nleadership, but whilst the government\u2019s discourse around visibility and accountability has \nbeen about the relationship between leaders and the public, these comments were more \nclosely tied to issues associated with collective decision making, so that one Liberal \nDemocrat said, for example, that \u2018I like to be inclusive, consult with people and take a \ndecision. I accept when I make a mistake\u2019 (county council), whilst a Conservative described \ntheir stance as \u2018Tough but fair\u2026 You need to stand by people if things get difficult\u2019 (district \ncouncil). A number also noted the benefits of collective or corporate ways in which the \ncabinets worked, emphasising the \u2018good debates\u2019 and collective decision making. In one \nthoughtful response, the Labour leader of a district council made the point that \u2018You can\u2019t use \nthe same behaviour in every situation, so whilst my natural inclination is towards a \nparticipatory style, sometimes you have to say \u201cThis is what I think you should do\u201d\u2019. \n \nThus it is possible to identify considerable overlap between the narratives of central \ngovernment, and some of those emerging from academic discourse (such as Mouritzen and \nSvara, 2002), and the views of local political leaders on the desirability of \u2018strong leadership\u2019. \nHowever, there is perhaps a greater degree of differentiation in relation to the political \nstructures that are required for \u2018strong leadership\u2019, with council leaders clearly believing that \nit is possible to demonstrate strong leadership within inclusive, consensual and collective \ndecision making mechanisms, and to that extent supporting and reflecting those academic \nnarratives (for example, Steyvers et al (2008) and Leach et al (2005)) that have been \nsomewhat sceptical of the emphasis on structural change. \n \nLeadership skills \n \nWhilst there may be some differences in the narratives around leadership style and decision \nmaking structures, there was a significant degree of convergence between the discourses \nemerging from central government (for example, the Councillors Commission, 2007), from \nlocal government organisations (such as the IDeA (2007) political skills framework) and the \nleaders interviewed, around the type of skills required for councillors and for leadership in \ncontemporary local authorities.  \n \nAmong leaders few phrases came up repeatedly, with the most commonly used terms being \n\u2018managerial\u2019 and \u2018communication\u2019 skills, each cited by around one third of the sample. \nManagerial skills were seen as important for a variety of reasons, including: the need to \nprioritise and set the agenda for authorities, \u2018You need to be an original creative thinker, to be \nable to \u201ccut through the crap\u201d, to identify priorities and issues. You need to be managerial\u2019 \n(Conservative, county council), and several leaders referred to the need to be able to think \nstrategically, in particular in relation to planning and prioritising the work of their authorities; \nmanaging colleagues, \u2018You need to be able to manage politicians; make them feel that they \nare part of a team\u2019 (Independent, Welsh council); and managing officers, \u2018It is important to \nlearn how to handle officers. You need to ensure that you do not get side-tracked\u2019 (Labour, \nunitary council).  \n \nSimilarly communication skills were identified as important, both for specific audiences, \nparticularly the party groups on the councils (\u2018You need to communicate, keep people with \nyou, keep the Group aware of your reasons\u2019 (Conservative, district council)) and for the range \nof different audiences that council leaders are required to address: \u2018You have got to have good \ncommunication skills \u2013 be able to speak on different levels\u2019 (Conservative, district council). \n \nIn this sense, there were also clear reflections of academic narratives that emphasise the \ncomplexity of governance (Borraz and John, 2004) and the need for facilitative leadership \n(Gains et al, 2007) and the type of skills that might be appropriate for these. \n \nHowever, despite this broad agreement, and indeed the greater availability of training for \ncouncillors than in the past, many leaders made clear that they had felt unprepared on \nassuming their roles. For many it was the breadth of the position that was seen as the major \nchallenge: \u2018Initially it was overwhelming \u2013 I needed to know about everything\u2019 (Labour, \nScottish council); others identified particular aspects of the role: \u2018Nothing prepares you for \nbeing a political leader; a cabinet role, and so on, gives you some idea, but you have to \ndevelop a thick skin. You need a combination of managerial skills and political skills\u2026 \nDealing with the media has been difficult\u2019 (Conservative, county council) and \u2018It has been a \nvery interesting experience. You need specific skills which I had not got\u2019 (Independent, \nWelsh council). In some cases the make-up of the council was seen as adding to the problem: \n\u2018I was not prepared for it. It was a hung council and had a new leader and new deputy. We \nhad to start from the beginning. There is so much going on in the council\u2026 You need to \nknow about everything\u2026\u2019 (Conservative, district council). Even for some of those who had \nheld significant posts, such as cabinet membership, prior to becoming leader, \u2018It took four to \nfive months to get familiar with all the roles\u2019 (Conservative, county council). \n \nA number suggested that fora such as the IDeA and CoSLA were valuable, both for the \ntraining that they provided (\u2018the IDEA leadership academy was very useful\u2019 (Conservative, \ncounty council)) and because \u2018You can ask things that you could not ask in your council\u2019 \n(Labour, Scottish council). However, whilst recent years have seen a significant increase in \nand availability of training for councillors, with the growing emphasis upon the executive role \nof leaders, the widespread view among leaders of their inadequate preparation, may raise \nquestions about the efficacy of a system that might accelerate the movement of individuals \ninto positions of local political authority with less experience than has historically been the \ncase, and also suggest the consequent desirability of providing appropriate and timely training \nand support for those affected. \n \nLeadership and power \n \nWhere leaders\u2019 relationships with and powers over cabinets were concerned there was again a \nreflection of the emphasis in the government\u2019s discourse on strong leadership, and the \nexecutive arrangements introduced in the Local Government and Public Involvement in \nHealth Act 2007, and the distinct academic narratives around strong leadership and the \nrelationships between leadership and political structures, in that the narratives emerging from \nleaders tended to emphasise a desire for greater power, but at the same time they suggested \nthat the current reality more closely reflected Leach et al\u2019s (2005) references to the \nimportance of context and to personal capabilities, outlined earlier, as well as the \nconstitutional decisions made by councils and by party groups, and arguably, the realities of \nlocal politics. Whilst a Conservative leader of a county council was able to say that \u2018The \nleader chooses the cabinet. It has been a bit hairy. People do not like losing their say. There \nare discussions about who gets portfolios. Nobody has refused a portfolio. I want cabinet \nskills rather than subject knowledge\u2019, a Labour leader of a unitary authority recognised the \ndifferent interests of leaders and other councillors, and the irony of having previously \nopposed, as a matter of principle, a leader having the power to choose the cabinet: \u2018I wish I \ndid. Now the group decides. The leader\u2019s recommendation is generally, but not always, \naccepted\u2019. Another said that \u2018Our group, or most groups, decided that the executive would be \nopen to election. I often wish, privately, that I had the gift of deciding who my executive \ncolleagues were\u2019 (Labour, district council). Similarly a Conservative county council leader \nargued against the position in his authority where the council had to agree the distribution of \nportfolios: \u2018The Leader has to work with the Cabinet so should have the complete say\u2019. A \nLiberal Democrat had managed to adjust the system: \u2018Prior to my being leader the group \ndecided, but that didn\u2019t always work. I persuaded them to elect nine people to the Cabinet and \nthen I talked to each of them to agree portfolios\u2019 (county council). From another perspective, \na Liberal Democrat cabinet member on a unitary authority, asked whether she had a choice of \nportfolio, responded \u2018Yes and no. It is debated among the group and depends what people\u2019s \ninterests and skills are\u2019; but another was clear that \u2018It is the leader who decides who gets \nwhich portfolio\u2019 (Conservative, county council).  \n \nFor obvious reasons, authorities with no overall control posed particular challenges. On one \ndistrict authority, where three parties and Independents were involved in sharing power, the \nConservative leader of the council said that \u2018the leaders of groups (and deputies) get together \nand put together a proposal for council, then the leader chooses who has which portfolio\u2019. A \nsimilar pattern, with groups making decisions about who should be on the cabinet, but the \nleader determining portfolios, appeared relatively common on many councils, and particularly \nin those with no overall control. In one instance the leader said \u2018I have the power, but have \nalways discussed it with my deputy, and then I have to go to the Liberal Democrats [partners \nin power sharing]\u2019 (Conservative, county council). In Scotland, where the committee system \nremains in place in most authorities, a similar pattern emerged, with sometimes complex \nnegotiations, particularly in authorities with no overall control (\u2018There was negotiation with \nthe Liberal Democrats \u2013 they have [a committee chair]\u2026 We got the Conservatives on side \non non-political issues\u2019 (Labour, Scottish council). The increase in the number of such \nauthorities following the introduction of the single transferable vote in 2007, is likely to have \nreinforced this position. \n \nOverall, the general impression emerging from the narratives of council leaders in this regard \nis, perhaps inevitably, of a considerable degree of discussion and negotiation, even on those \nauthorities where the leader possesses the constitutional power to choose the cabinet and to \nallocate portfolios. There is, therefore a degree of support for the narratives associated with \nSteyvers et al\u2019s (2008) questions about the relationship between institutional reform and \nleadership in practice, and Borraz and John\u2019s view that \u2018stronger leadership models do not \nnecessarily entail systematically a more personal style of decision-making\u2026 Leaders rarely \nact alone and the move towards stronger leadership models could very well foster more \ncollegial practices\u2019 (2004: 113), and perhaps implicitly for Gains et al\u2019s (2007) model of \nfacilitative leadership. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nWhilst the focus of this article has been on the reforms and discourse of the Labour \ngovernment, and its relationship with the narratives that emerge from council leaders, it is \nperhaps worth briefly considering the positions of the other major parties. Perhaps \nunsurprisingly, given that they are in Opposition, there is a lack of specificity in the ideas put \nforward by them. The Liberal Democrats, in their policy paper, The Power to be Different, \nundertook to allow councils to determine their own constitutional arrangements, including \nabolishing the requirement for a split between executive and scrutiny functions and allowing \nfor councils which desired it, to return to a committee based structure (Liberal Democratic \nParty, 2007). It is therefore unclear what the impact of this would be on local political \nleadership. Where the Conservative Party is concerned, their green paper, Control Shift \u2013 \nReturning Power to Local Communities, says relatively little about decision making processes \nand structures. It does, in places, repeat elements of the New Labour discourse, so that \u2018In our \nbiggest cities, there is a strong case for new powers being placed in the hands of a single \naccountable individual \u2013 an elected Mayor who can provide the city with strong leadership. \nIndividual leadership of these councils can benefit local citizens by improving the clarity of \nmunicipal decision-making and enhancing the prestige of their city\u2019 (Conservative Party, \n2009: 20). In others, it follows the Liberal Democrats in proposing to give other councils the \nability to decide what decision making structures they would like to adopt, subject to a local \nreferendum. In reality, given the requirement to hold a referendum, it would seem likely that \nthe status quo would be likely to dominate for a period at least. Whilst in some respects it \nmight therefore be argued that the Conservative narrative is currently broad enough to fit \nmore easily with that of council leaders, outside the major cities it does not appear to reflect \nthe wishes of leaders for greater powers over cabinets, for example, and the likely impact of \nthe implementation of such an approach is far from clear. \n \nThe results of this research demonstrate that there are significant levels of convergence \nbetween the discourses of central government under Labour with regard to local political \nleadership and those that emerge from the narratives of council leaders, as well as academic \nwork that sees strong leadership as an understandable and appropriate response to the \nchanging needs of local and national politics. There also appears to be a broad consensus on \nthe type of skills required by councillors and leaders, although the research highlights the \ndifficulties of providing adequate training and preparation when individuals can be catapulted \ninto positions of leadership with only limited experience and with almost no notice. \n \nAt the same time, there are some areas of divergence, perhaps most notably around the \nrelationship between political structures and political leadership and decision making, where \nleaders tend to produce views that fall somewhat closer to those elements of academic \nnarratives that differentiate between practices and position (such as Haus and Sweeting, 2006) \nand those that are less convinced that structural change will necessarily provide the type of \nleadership sought by the government (including Lowndes and Leach, 2004) . For example, as \nnoted earlier, the great majority of those interviewed clearly see their role and styles as being \nfacilitative and inclusive in at least some respects, whilst the impact of context and personal \ncapabilities discussed by Leach et al (2005), and the potential for conflict with local parties \nand party groups (Copus, 2004; Leach and Wilson, 2008) is also apparent.  \n \n \n \n*The authors are grateful to the Nuffield Foundation Small Grants Scheme for their support \nfor this research under grant number SGS\/32112, and to the councillors who agreed to be \ninterviewed.
