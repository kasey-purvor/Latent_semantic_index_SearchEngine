WORTHMANa AND CATHERINE PANTER-BRICKb\naEmory University; and bDurham University\nAbstract\nAs challenges to child well-being through economic disadvantage, family disruption, and migration or displacement\nescalate world wide, the need for cross-culturally robust understanding of childhood adversity proportionately increases.\nToward this end, developmental risk was assessed in four contrasting groups of 107 Nepali children ages 10\u201314 years\nthat represent distinctive, common conditions in which contemporary children grow up. Relative cumulative burden\n(allostatic load) indexed by multiple dimensions of physical and psychosocial stress was ascertained among homeless\nstreet boys and three family-based groups, from poor urban squatter settlements, urban middle class, and a remote rural\nvillage. Biomarkers of stress and vulnerability to stress included growth status, salivary cortisol, antibodies to Epstein\u2013\nBarr virus, acute phase inflammatory responses (alpha1-antichymotrypsin), and cardiovascular fitness and reactivity (flex\nheart rate and pressor response). Individual biomarkers of risk and allostatic load differed markedly among groups, were\nhighest in villagers, and varied by components of allostatic load. Such data suggest a need for critical appraisal of\nhomelessness and migration as a risk factor to youth, given prevailing local conditions such as rural poverty, and\nrepresents the only multidimensional study of childhood allostatic load and developmental risk in non-Western settings.\nThe impact of adversity on child development\nand well-being commands increasing concern,\nparticularly with regard to the causes of\nheterogeneity in outcomes and identification\nof factors promoting resilience or vulnerability\n(Cicchetti & Walker, 2001; Gunnar, 2000;\nRepetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). Biological\nmarkers have been increasingly used to \u201cget\nunder the skin\u201d of trauma or disadvantage and\nassess the proximal impact of acute and chronic\nstressors (Granger &Kivlinghan, 2003; Gunnar\n& Donzella, 2002; Heim & Nemeroff, 2002;\nLupien, King, Meaney, &McEwen, 2001; See-\nman & McEwen, 1996). Rapidly accumulating\nwork in this area contrasts with a paucity of data\non non-Western settings where the majority of\nchildren live and the exposure to adversity is\nmost prevalent and severe (UNICEF, 2002).\nThese settings present other complexities (mal-\nnutrition, illness, diverse social conditions)\nagainst which existing models of stress and\ndevelopment should be tested and refined\n(Fernald & Grantham-McGregor, 2002; Flinn\n& England, 1997; McDade, 2002; Raine\net al., 2001; Worthman, 1999).\nHowever, the present literature on childhood\nstress focuses on markers of psychosocial stress\nand impairment and neglects the concomitant\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to: Carol\nM.

The potential for addressing\nboth mental and physical burden in children at\nrisk has expanded dramatically as researchers\nbegin to apply a wide range of biomarkers for\nassessment of stress, vulnerability to stress,\nand functional burden. The present study de-\nploys a multidimensional approach to appraise\nthe distribution of burden with assessment of\nsalient physical and psychosocial markers of\nstress in adverse environments. It was provoked\nby a surprising observation: homeless street\nchildren in Kathmandu, whose presence is re-\ngarded by international organizations and wel-\nfare agencies as deeply problematic, were found\nto achieve strikingly better growth outcomes\nrelative to villagers in rural Nepal (Panter-\nBrick, Todd, & Baker, 1996). A subsequent lit-\nerature review (Panter-Brick, 2002) concluded\nthat homeless street children were not necessar-\nily at risk for the worst health outcomes, con-\ntrary to existing literature that characterizes\nthem as \u201cmost at risk of negative physical, men-\ntal and developmental outcomes\u201d (de la Barra,\n1998, p. 46). It is arguable that a more critical\nappraisal of the impact of poverty, homeless-\nness, and social exclusion is required, including\na rigorous evaluation of health outcomes in dif-\nferent environments. Very few studies integrate\nboth the physical and psychosocial dimensions\nof health outcomes to conceptualize the multi-\nfaceted responses to stressors and adversity in\ncomparative perspective. This study takes a\nstep in that direction, aiming to redress the\npaucity of comparative research on adverse\nenvironments and developmental risk in non-\nWestern settings.\nDevelopmental Psychobiology of Stress:\nCurrent Approaches\nAdvances in conceptualization of psychosocial\nstress emphasize its dynamic nature, as arising\nfrom cumulative interactions of the person\nand a specific environment (Cacioppo, Bernt-\nson, Sheridan, & McClintock, 2000; McEwen,\n2000a, 2000b). A rapidly burgeoning literature\non the developmental psychobiology of psy-\nchosocial stress has underscored the moderat-\ning role of temperamental and social factors\non responses to stressful experience (Boyce &\nJemerin, 1990; Gunnar & Donzella, 2002;\nKagan, Reznick, & Snidman, 1987; Lewis &\nRamsay, 1995) and their consequences for\nsociobehavioral andpsychiatricoutcomes (Boyce\net al., 1998; Hart, Gunnar, & Cicchetti, 1996;\nHirshfeld et al., 1992). Research on the devel-\nopmental effects of stressful experiences has\nbeen stimulated by important experimental\nand long-term work with rodent and primate\nmodels (Coplan et al., 2001; Higley et al.,\n1993; Meaney, 2001; Schneider & Moore,\n2000; Suomi, 1991). In humans, the organiza-\ntional impact of traumatic experiences on later\nmental health, even across generations, is re-\nceiving increasing attention (Heim & Nemer-\noff, 2001; Yehuda, 1999; Yehuda, Teicher,\nTrestman, Levengood, & Siever, 1996). Social\necological challenges (poverty, maternal de-\npression, quality of day care) also exert concur-\nrent effects on hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal\n(HPA) activity (Lupien, King, Meaney, &\nMcEwen, 2001; Tout, de Haan, Campbell, &\nGunnar, 1998).\nSuch literature links the features of adverse\nexperiences to cognitive and behavioral out-\ncomes, via the psychophysiological mediators\nof experiential processing. However, research\non children and youth in everyday settings pre-\ncludes experimental and invasive approaches to\ntracing such mediating pathways in detail.\nRather, the study of affective state regulation\nand processing in humans has relied on nonin-\nvasive means to track the physiological markers\nof stress regulation, such as cardiovascular\nautonomic and endocrine changes. Everyday\nnegatively perceived experiences are acutely\nassociated with cardiovascular changes and,\nover a somewhat longer time course, increased\ncortisol (Seeman & McEwen, 1996; van Eck,\nBerkhof, Nicolson, & Sulon, 1996). With\nrespect to cardiovascular changes, \u201creactivity\u201d\n(response latency, magnitude, and trajectory)\nis thought to modulate these associations\n(Cacioppo et al., 1995, 1998; Gunnar, Porter,\nWolf, Rigatuso, & Larson, 1995) and in field\nstudies, pressor response (accommodation of\npostural change, indexed by heart rate [HR])\nis a useful indicator of vagal tone and auto-\nnomic reactivity (Cacioppo, 1994; Cacioppo\net al., 1998; Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, &\nMaita, 1994). With respect to endocrine\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick234\nresponses, central neuroendocrine pathways of\nemotion processing influence cortisol levels,\nmost conveniently appraised from repeated saliva\nsampling. Individual differences in responses\nto stressful experiences have been probed\nby tracking cortisol changes in experi-\nmental or natural conditions (Granger, Weisz,\nMcCracken, Ikeda, & Douglas, 1996; Kirsch-\nbaum & Hellhammer, 1994; Schwartz, Granger,\nSusman, Gunnar, & Laird, 1998). Both per-\nceived chronic stress and constitutional factors\nhave been associated with elevated cortisol\nin the hour after wakening (Wu\u00a8st, Federenko,\nHellhammer, & Kirschbaum, 2000); quality\nof child care has been related to emotional\ndevelopment, regulation, and cortisol responses\nin infants and children (Dettling, Parker,\nLane, Sebanc, & Gunnar, 2000; Gunnar &\nDonzella, 2002; Hruschka, Kohrt, &Worthman,\n2005); and traumatic stress has been linked\nto low as well as to high cortisol values and to\nblunted or exacerbated cortisol responsiveness\nin children and adults (De Bellis, 2002; Heim\n& Nemeroff, 2001).\nLevels of ecological stress, in conjunction\nwith individual responses to stress, have also\nbeen linked to immune function (Boyce,\nAdams, et al., 1995; Boyce, Chesney, et al.,\n1995; Uchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser,\n1996) and consequent vulnerability to infec-\ntions (Cohen, Frank, Doyle, Skoner, & Rabin,\n1998; Glaser, Kiecolt-Glaser, Malarkey, &\nSheridan, 1998; Glaser, Rabin, Chesney, Cohen,\n& Natelson, 1999). Meta-analysis has identified\nthat antibodies to resident viruses (Epstein\u2013\nBarr and herpes simplex) pandemic in humans\nare sensitive indicators of chronic psycho-\nsocial stress, with increased levels of antibodies\nto a resident virus reflecting impaired cell-\nmediated immune function associated with long-\nterm stress (Cacioppo et al., 2002; Glaser,\nKutz, MacCallum, & Malarkey, 1995; Herbert\n& Cohen, 1993). A pandemic herpes virus,\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infects and chronically\ninhabits 80% to 90% of American adults by\nthe age of 40 (Henle & Henle, 1982;\nJones & Straus, 1987), but attains 100%\nprevalence by age 5 years in non-Western\npopulations with greater exposure and\nvulnerability. A fingerprick blood spot method\nfor assessing EBV antibody titers (EBV-Ab),\ndeveloped for field studies, has been used\nto demonstrate the impact of acculturation\nstress on Samoan adolescents as well as of\nfamily stress on American youth (McDade,\n2002; McDade et al., 2000). Yet so far, the\npsychoneuroimmunological literature on psycho-\nsocial stress has failed to consider the impact\nof high pathogen load interacting with\nmarginal nutrition, a condition uncommon in\nEuropean and North American populations but\nprevalent in much of the rest of the world. This\nis the first report in the literature to consider\nsuch immunological correlates of stress for a\npopulation with high pathogen exposure and\nmarginal nutrition.\nAllostatic Load and Cumulative Burden\nA lifespan perspective and emphasis on cumu-\nlative burden increasingly inform views of\nstress and health among adults (Darnton-Hill,\nNishida, & James, 2004). McEwen (2000a)\nhas advanced the concept of allostatic load to\nmaintain a necessary distinction between\nstressors and stress: the former is a property of\ncircumstances to which individuals are ex-\nposed, the latter is the extent to which the indi-\nvidual is challenged to maintain function. The\nabove-reviewed literature on developmental\npsychobiology of stress, for instance, empha-\nsizes the interaction of individual and context\n(Ellis, Essex, & Boyce, 2005). Whatever the\norigins, activation of systems to meet psychoso-\ncial or physical challenges promotes adaptation\nin the short run, but exacts physical costs over\ntime. Allostatic load represents the cumulative\nimpact or functional burden of adjusting to\nperceived or actual challenge and as such,\noffers an integrated developmental, multisys-\ntem approach to understanding the sources of\ndifferential well-being (McEwen & Wingfield,\n2003). Recent reports have used a multisystem\nassessment of allostatic load to predict differ-\nences in functioning and mortality risk in aging\n(Seeman, McEwen, Rowe, & Singer, 2001;\nSeeman, Singer, Rowe, Horwitz, & McEwen,\n1997). Other work on response to challenge,\nparticularly psychosocial threat, allies adapta-\ntionist with empirical approaches to suggest\nnonlinear interactions of adversity with respon-\nsivity to challenge (Boyce & Ellis, 2005).\nHomeless street children in Nepal 235\nTogether the developmental, adaptationist,\nmultisystem approach of allostatic load and\nthe context-dependent perspective on emer-\ngence of response to challenge provide a frame-\nwork for comparative empirical research on the\nimpact of early adversity on mental and physi-\ncal well-being.\nStudies Among Non-Western Children\nand Youth\nAgainst this substantial background of concep-\ntual, methodological, and empirical progress,\nthe dearth of comparative research in non-\nWestern settings stands out. The generalizabil-\nity of existing models for understanding the\ndevelopmental psychobiology of psychosocial\nstress remains untested in the contexts relevant\nto the majority of the world\u2019s children. The few\navailable reports are suggestive. For instance, in\nresearch in Dominica, Flinn, and colleagues\n(Flinn & England, 2003; Flinn, Quinlan,\nDecker, Turner, & England, 1996) found that\nelevated cortisol profiles associated with family\ndynamics also related to subsequent discrete\nillness episodes. In Jamaica, 8- to 10-year-old\nchildren with continuous growth stunting\nfrom infancy (defined as \u00022 SD below US\nreference height for age) showed greater cortisol\noutput, HRs, and pressor responses throughout\na protocol of interview and frustrating tasks.\nStunted children showed a relationship of pre-\ntest cortisol to increased behavioral inhibition\nand reduced vocalization during frustrating\ntasks, diametrically opposite to the cortisol\nprofiles associated with increased vocalization\nand reduced inhibition in nonstunted children\n(Fernald & Grantham-McGregor, 1998). In a\nlater study, similarly aged stunted Jamaican\nchildren exhibited elevated HRs and catechol-\namine production, but not salivary cortisol, during\ntest session. Furthermore in Nepal, stunted 8- to\n10-year-oldschoolchildrenshowedsimilarbaseline\nvalues and a blunted physiologic response (cor-\ntisol and HR) to challenging tasks, compared to\nnonstunted peers (Fernald, Grantham-McGregor,\nManandhar, & Costello, 2003).\nIn contrast to the relative inattention to psy-\nchosocial stress, extensive comparative world-\nwide data are available relating child adversity\nto physical development and health. Indeed,\nchild and maternal malnourishment indexed\nby underweight is estimated to represent the\nsingle largest source of global health burden\n(Ezzati et al., 2002). Morphometric measures\nof child growth and nutritional status provide\nsensitive indices of environmental quality and\ndevelopmental risk, representing the cumula-\ntive impacts of physical adversity such as\nimpaired nutrition and burdens of infection\nand parasites, from gestation onward (Pelletier\n& Frongillo, 2003; World Health Organisation\n[WHO], 1995). Structural factors affecting con-\nditions such as rates of immunization, female\nliteracy, and safe water also drive international\ndifferences in child growth (Milman, Frongillo,\nde Onis, & Hwang, 2005). But political and\nsocial factors related to ethnicity, class, or\nregion contribute to variation within countries\n(Eveleth & Tanner, 1990) and raise public\nhealth concern to detect and ameliorate the\nsources of such health disparities (Ezzati\net al., 2002). Furthermore, the insults reflected\nin poor child growth and nutrition are linked\nto deficits in cognitive\u2013behavioral development\n(Chang, Walker, Grantham-McGregor, &\nPowell, 2002; Li, Barnhart, Stein, & Martorell,\n2003), yet the import of these observations for\nlong-term psychobehavioral risk remains un-\nderstudied (but see Raine, 2003). Advances in\nuse of models and measures of child physical\nwell-being for international public health have\nnot been paralleled by similarly strong\nadvances in assessment of child psychosocial\nwell-being and mental health (Pollitt, 2000).\nFurther, assessment of child psychosocial stress\nhas not been incorporated into measures of\nchild well-being, leaving our global compara-\ntive view of child developmental risk incom-\nplete.\nSelection of Study Groups\nConcern for the physical and mental health of\ndisplaced persons and unaccompanied children\ncurrently leads in many international agendas\n(Desjarlais, Eisenberg, Good, & Kleinman,\n1995; Fazel & Stein, 2002; Saraceno, 2003):\nthere is a rapidly growing number of homeless\nstreet children subsisting in urban centers, of dis-\nplaced children affected by warfare or ecological\ndisasters, and orphans from the HIV\/AIDS\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick236\nepidemic. High rates of adult mortality increase\nthe risk that children experience parent loss,\nfamily disruption, stepparenting, and adoption.\nSuch conditions confront Nepali children,\ngiven high maternal mortality (740 per\n100,000 births in the period of this study\n(1993), compared to 540 in neighboring India\n(UNICEF, 2004, pp. 25\u201326) and overall\nadult mortality (ages 15\u201356: 312 males, 243\nfemales\/1,000 in 1990 (World Bank, 1993).\nWorldwide, such emerging issues intersect\nwith other established and novel challenges to\nfamily and child well-being, including increas-\ning rural poverty and ecological degradation as\nwell as urbanization and economic stratifica-\ntion. At the time of the study, Nepal ranked as\nthe seventh poorest nation in the world; rural\npopulation pressure with environmental decay\ncontributed to rates of urban migration and\nrapid expansion of landless urban poor living\nin marginal conditions (United Nations Fund\nfor Population Activities, 1996, 2000). Since\nthen, as armed conflict between Maoist and\ngovernment forces has flared across the coun-\ntry, increasing numbers of Nepali children are\ngrowing up under challenge from psychosocial\nstress and material hardship.\nStudies in both the developed and develop-\ningworld have emphasized that \u201chomelessness\u201d\nis a risk for child health, but so is \u201cpoverty\u201d\n(Costello, Compton, Keeler, & Angold, 2002;\nDavey Smith, 1998; Luthar, 1999). Yet, rarely\nhas research explicitly compared street children\nliving outside a residential family setting with\ntheir peers growing up under other prevailing\nconditions that also may present distinctive\nchallenges (Panter-Brick, 2001, 2002). There-\nfore, we elected to contrast Nepali street chil-\ndren with children of urban squatter, urban mid-\ndle-class, and rural village families. We thereby\ncompare children who live with or without the\ncare and protection of adults, children who are\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged or secure,\nand children in urban or rural environments.\nSpecifically, we sampled four groups with con-\ntrasting family residence, location, and wealth,\nas follows: two urban poor populations in Kath-\nmandu: homeless children, and squatter chil-\ndren residing at home; the rural poor in a remote\nvillage of central Nepal; and urban middle class\nattending a fee-paying school in Kathmandu.\nHomeless street children come from both\nvillage and squatter populations, namely from\nfamilies who have and have not migrated to\nKathmandu. The middle-class group represents\nrelatively advantaged rearing conditions avail-\nable for Nepali children.\nThis is the first study of homeless street chil-\ndren that uses appropriate local controls, draws\nmultiple indices of physical and psychosocial\nwell-being, and assesses aggregated psycho-\nsocial and physical burden. To date we have re-\nported marked group differences in the physical\nmarkers of well-being indicating that the home-\nless street boys did not have the worst outcomes\nin terms of growth status and pathogen load, and\ndocumenting a marked contrast between urban\nand rural conditions. Height status was worst\nin villagers (Panter-Brick, Todd, & Baker,\n1996) and acute-phase protein indices of\npathogen load were greatest even though vil-\nlagers reported the least morbidity (Panter-Brick,\nLunn, Baker, & Todd, 2001; Panter-Brick,\nTodd, Baker, & Worthman, 1996). Indeed, the\nobserved discordance between self-reported\nsymptoms and infection status raised our interest\nin biomarkers to assess health status. Physiologic\nmeasures can indicate the acute and cumulative\nburden of insult of which individuals may or\nmay not be aware, and are not dependent on\nthe social, cultural, and personal factors that in-\nfluence self-report.\nStudy Aims and Hypotheses\nThe present report aims to integrate measures of\nbiological developmental adversity (growth sta-\ntus, pathogen load indexed by acute-phase pro-\ntein, cardiovascular fitness) with measures of\npsychosocial stress (average cortisol, EBV anti-\nbody values) and indicators thought to mediate\nindividual vulnerability to stress (cardiovascular\nreactivity, day-to-day cortisol variance). Hence,\nthe suite of biomarkers was chosen to represent\nthe confluence of both psychosocial andmaterial\ndeprivation comprising social (socioeconomic\nmarginalization, perceived disadvantage, family\ndysfunction), material (marginal nutrition, work-\nload, poor sanitation, inadequate housing), and\npsychological (insecurity, perceived disadvan-\ntage, lack of social support) dimensions. From\nthese measures we derive an index of allostatic\nHomeless street children in Nepal 237\nload to obtain a locally informed index of\nrelative well-being and evaluate the contribu-\ntions of material and social deprivation to\ndifferential well-being on two levels. From the\nepidemiologic focus on social address and\nexposure to risk (Krieger, 2004), we take a social\necological approach and contrast four groups\nfrom across the range of expectable rearing\nenvironments for children inNepal. From the de-\nvelopmental focus on the individual, we applied\nbiomarkers as sensitive and universal indices of\ndevelopmental risk (e.g., growth impairment,\nnutritional, and infective status) and well-being\n(e.g., HPA, infection).\nHere, we address the question of whether\nchildren living on the streets of Kathmandu in-\ndeed fare worse than their peers living in urban\nsquatter, urban middle-class, or village families.\nFirst, we use biomarkers of mental and physical\nstress and vulnerability to stress to contrast bur-\nden among homeless street boys relative to\npeers. Second, we combine the biomarkers in a\nmeasure of allostatic load to compare overall\nwell-being among groups. By contrast with a\nprevalent concern for homeless children evoked\nby their visibility and perceived vulnerability,\nprevious field work indicates that the gradient\nof deprivation represented in growth and infec-\ntive status across our four populations runs,\nhigh to low, as follows: villager, homeless,\nsquatter, and school children. We test the com-\npeting hypothesis that allostatic load follows\nthis gradient rather than one that places homeless\nstreet children as worst off.\nMethods\nStudy populations\nFour groups of Nepali boys (n \u00bc 107, ages\n10\u201314 years)\u2014homeless street children, urban\nsquatters, urban middle class, and villagers\u2014\nwere drawn from three urban groups represent-\ning contrasting lifestyles and socioeconomic\nstatuses in Kathmandu, a migrant-receiving\ncity of ~450,000 inhabitants at the time of study\n(August\u2013December 1993), and from a fourth\ncontrasting village population in the rural hill\nareas supplying some urban migrants. These\nsamples were selected to represent social ecolo-\ngies, or prevailing conditions related to social\naddress, that characterize the spectrum of\nconditions experienced by Nepali children.\nOur four contrastive conditions represent inter-\nsections of three axes that situate child social\naddress in Nepal: urban\u2013rural, disadvantaged\u2013\nsecure, and street\u2013home. The present data con-\ncern a subsample of participants from a larger\nsurvey (n\u00bc 307, ages 6\u201314 years) that recruited\na representative sample of homeless children\u2014\n23% of the known homeless population of\nKathmandu enumerated by a nongovernmental\norganization (NGO), Child Workers in Nepal\n(CWIN)\u2014and total samples of poor squatter,\nmiddle-class urban and village boys drawn\nfrom a nearby squatter settlement, a private\nschool, and the remote rural area, respectively\n(Panter-Brick, Baker & Todd, 1996). After\nthis survey, participants were recruited for the\nintensive hormonal, immunological, and car-\ndiovascular measurements, for which data\nwere collected both in secure locations (the\nNGO common room, a rented flat, the school,\nthe village home) and in habitual settings\n(e.g., homes, streets) as appropriate. Because\n97% of homeless children in Kathmandu were\nmale, this study focused on boys. The purposes\nof the research were explained by local assis-\ntants well known to the children (NGO staff\nserving both homeless and squatter children,\nschoolteachers, and village leaders), whereas\nrecruitment was facilitated through previous\nfieldwork by Baker et al. (1996) in the street\nand school settings and by Panter-Brick in the\nvillage setting since 1982. The research proto-\ncol was approved by the Ethics Committee of\nDurham University and conducted under re-\nsearch permit from the Research Office, Trib-\nhuvan University, Kathmandu. All aspects of\nparticipation were explained to, and informed\nconsent obtained from, participants and, where\navailable, their parents. At the end of their par-\nticipation, boys were paid a small amount of\nfood or money for the time taken by the study.\nUrban homeless. Homeless children represent\nconditions for children not residing in families\nand without stable abodes who endure the\nsocial and material uncertainty of life on the\nstreets. Homeless street children in Kathmandu\nmay come from rural areas throughout Nepal or\nbe drawn from the rapidly growing squatter\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick238\npopulation in the urban area. They leave home\nmostly to seek independent livelihood and\nescape absolute poverty or family dysfunction\n(Panter-Brick, Todd, & Baker, 1996). They\nsupport themselves both by begging from\nlocals or tourists and by selling metal and\nplastic products scavenged from trash bins\nand city dumps, and taken to junkyards for re-\ncycling. The status of homelessness is rather\nfluid, as some children from rural areas visited\nthe parental home (usually once a year),\nwhereas others retained links with the squatter\nsettlements. At the time of the study, however,\nthese children reported themselves as homeless\nand slept nights alone or in small groups of\nfriends, on pavements, at bus stops, by restau-\nrants or shops, or in a secure common room\nrun by the NGO. Duration of homelessness\namong participants in the initial survey ranged\nfrom 1 week to 9 years, averaging 2.7 years.\nFor the subsample in the present study (n \u00bc\n27), the range was 0.5\u20136 years, on average\n2.85 (SD \u00bc 1.92). The sample of homeless is\ndrawn from both rural immigrant and urban\nsquatter sources.\nUrban squatter. This group (n\u00bc 20) was chosen\nas representative of children of the urbanmigrant\nunderclass who experience material deprivation,\nsocial marginalization, poor housing and sanita-\ntion, but who reside with their families. The\nsquatter boys are also \u201cstreet children\u201d com-\nmonly engaged in similar street-based activities\nby day, but who spend the night with their fam-\nilies in illegally established, indigent, makeshift\nand crowded settlements. The squatter popula-\ntion of Kathmandu has been estimated as grow-\ning at 8% per annum to approximately 10,000\npeople in the early 1990s (Central Bureau of\nStatistics, 1987). Many squatter families have\nmigrated from rural areas during the last 15\nyears, and subsist as low-caste street sweepers,\nstreet vendors, and jewelry makers. The boys,\nrecruited from the squatter settlement closest to\nthe NGO, contributed to their family\u2019s earnings\nand\/or attended school.\nUrban middle class. This group (n \u00bc 30) was\nchosen as representative of relatively favorable\nmaterial conditions for child welfare, benefiting\nfrom relative material and social security, more\nadequate nutrition, urban housing, improved\nschooling, and sanitation. Pupils were drawn\nfrom four classes of a private school in Kath-\nmandu, mostly day students living at home,\nwith some boarders sent from rural areas.\nThey represent a local control group drawn\nfrom relatively affluent middle-class families,\nable to afford private school fees. Middle-class\nfamilies, locally characterized as having at least\none adult with employment providing a stable\nincome, comprise roughly 40% of the popula-\ntion in Nepal\u2019s Central region that includes\nKathmandu.\nRural village. This group (n \u00bc 30) represents\nrural village conditions in which the majority\nof Nepali children grow up, subject to poor\nsanitation, subsistence nutrition, and relatively\nheavy physical workloads, but residing in fam-\nilies within a stable community. The village\nsample comprised all the available 10- to 14-\nyear-old boys residing in the two main hamlets\nof Salme village (central Nepal), comprising\n1,540 inhabitants. The area lacks roads, elec-\ntricity, or public sanitation, and it is the site of\nlong-term ongoing research by Panter-Brick.\nThe villagers are self-sufficient agropastoralists\nwith high workloads involving assistance from\nchildren, whose labor is counted as equivalent\nto that of an adult by 12 years of age (Panter-\nBrick, 1998). Subsistence relies on multiple\ncropping with circannual harvesting, use of\nanimal resources, and occasional wage labor\nand outside remittances. Children attend school\nbut routinely perform subsistence and domestic\ntasks as well.\nBiomarkers and demographic data\nBiomarkers used in this study are listed in\nTable 1, along with the time course and domain\nrepresented by the measure.\nAnthropometry. Growth status was assessed\nusing standard anthropometric techniques and\nportable equipment (Harpenden anthropom-\neter, Salter electronic scale, steel tape, and\ncaliper) as detailed elsewhere (Panter-Brick,\nBaker & Todd, 1996). Measures were taken\nby the same investigator at all four sites. Height\nfor age (HAZ) represents cumulative growth\nHomeless street children in Nepal 239\nTable 1.

Participants contributed\nmorning samples over 7\u201310 consecutive days\nto derive a representative estimate of morning\nHPA activity (Hruschka et al., 2005), having\nbeen habituated to saliva collection by a pre-\nvious week-long round of daily collection not\nconsidered in the present analysis. They were\nmet at prespecified locations, and asked to rinse\ntheir mouth with water, wait 15 min for equili-\nbration, and collect unstimulated 2.5 ml saliva\ninto calibrated Sterilin vials pretreated with so-\ndium azide (one drop 2% aqueous solution [wt\/\nvol], dried). Time of collection, time of waking,\nand whether and when anything had been eaten\nor drunk were recorded. Samples were kept at\nroom temperature in the field, shipped to the\nlaboratory, and then stored at 2268C until as-\nsay. Cortisol determinations were made using\na minimally modified version of a solid phase\nCoat-A-Count Cortisol radioimmunoassay\n(RIA) kit from Diagnostic Products Corpora-\ntion (Los Angeles, CA). Validation analysis\nof matched treated and untreated saliva sup-\nported the expectation that the antioxidant so-\ndium azide does not interfere with this RIA as\nit may with enzyme-linked assays. Antiserum\nis highly specific for cortisol, and it cross-reacts\n1.4% with corticosterone, 1.5% with 11-deoxy-\ncorticosterone, and ,1.0% with most other re-\nlated compounds. Assay sensitivity is 0.06 mg\/\ndl. Intraassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for\nlow, medium, and high commercial controls are\n10.7, 6.2, and 7.7%, respectively. Interassay\nCVs for low, medium, and high controls are\n11.3, 8.2, and 8.0%. The intra- and interassay\ncoefficients of variation for the saliva pool are\n6.0 and 6.8%, respectively. Accuracy of the\nassay is reported as excellent (Raff, Homar, &\nBurns, 2002).\nBlood spot EBV-Ab and acute-phase protein.\nFinger-prick blood spots (one sample per child)\nwere collected onto a standardized filter paper\n(Schleicher and Schull #903, Keene, NH), air\ndried at room temperature, placed in a ziplock\nbag, and refrigerated for up to aweek until ship-\nment to the laboratory, where they were stored\nat 2268C until assay. Details of blood spot\nsampling, handling, stability, and assay of\nEBV-Ab in the paper matrix are provided else-\nwhere (McDade et al., 2000; Worthman & Stal-\nlings, 1997). Levels of EBV-Ab are elevated\nwhen cell-mediated immunity is impaired by\npsychosocial stress, and thus have been pro-\nmoted as a direct biomarker of psychosocial\nstress. An acute-phase protein sensitive to a\nwide range of infections, alpha1-antichymo-\ntrypsin (ACT), was also assayed from the blood\nspots using an automated immunoturbidimetric\ntechnique (Dako, Ely, UK; Cobas Fara centrifu-\ngal spectrophotometer, Hoffman La Roche,\nNutley, NJ). Assay detection limit is 0.02 g\/l;\nwithin- and between-assay CVs for low and\nhigh controls (0.24 and 0.59 g\/l) run 3 and\n4%, and 5 and 8%, respectively. Procedure,\nperformance, and quality control for the results\nreported here are detailed elsewhere (Adelekan\net al., 2003; Panter-Brick et al., 2001). ACT\nrises rapidly and remains elevated in response\nto pathogen exposure, and thus acts as an indi-\ncator of pathogen challenge in subclinical and\nchronic infection (Adelekan et al., 2003;\nThompson, Milford-Ward, & Whicher, 1992).\nAcute immune activation stimulates HPA activ-\nity (Battaglia et al., 1998) but in the present data\nset, cortisol was not correlated with ACT.\nHR measures. Physical fitness and physical\nactivity were assessed by HR monitoring dur-\ning a standard protocol and where possible for\n24 hr (Panter-Brick, Todd, Baker, & Worth-\nman, 1996). A chest strap monitor and wrist re-\ncording devices (Polar Vantage XL, Polar CIC,\nWashington, NY) were worn by participants\nduring a progressive timed protocol of lying,\nsitting, standing, stepping, and jogging. HR\nfor each state was calculated as mean beats\nper minute (bpm) in the last minute of the 4-\nmin recording period at each state. Flex HR\n(flexHR), a measure of cardiovascular fitness,\nwas calculated from the mean of maximum\nrest (lying, sitting, standing) and minimum\nactive (stepping, jogging)HR. Pressor response,\na marker of vagal tone and cardiovascular\nreactivity, was derived as the difference between\nthe maximum sitting HR (entire trace) and the\nHomeless street children in Nepal 241\nmean lying HR (last minute). Cardiovascular\ncapacity to accommodate load shifts during\npostural change from lying to sitting or standing\nreflects vagal tone and other dimensions of car-\ndiovascular fitness (greater tone results in lower\nHR change). Results for the monitoring of\n24-hr and daytime physical activity are reported\nelsewhere (Panter-Brick, Todd, Baker, &\nWorthman, 1996). Logistic constraints preven-\nted collection of HR measures in squatter boys.\nDemographic data. Exact ages of village\nparticipants were known from household\ndemographic records maintained since 1982.\nExact ages were also known from school\nrecords for middle-class pupils. The ages of\nhomeless and squatter boys were based on child\nreports, with repeated corroboration from\ntrusted fieldworkers and parents when avail-\nable. Family composition (nuclear, stepparent,\norphan), size, and birth order were obtained\nfrom household records for the village and\nfrom extensively cross-checked self-reports\nfor urban children (Baker, Panter-Brick, &\nTodd, 1996).\nAllostatic load. Following previous reports\n(Seeman et al., 1997, 2001), we constructed a\nmeasure of allostatic load that summarizes sta-\ntus on biomarkers that index multiple systems\nrelated to child developmental risk and well-\nbeing. Biomarkers included in the index were\nheight for age and weight for height for age Z\nscores (HAZ and WHAZ, respectively, reflect-\ning growth and nutritional status as influenced\ndiet, physical activity, and burden of infection),\ncortisol and cortisol variability (exposure and\nresponsivity to psychosocial challenge), ACT\n(subacute and chronic inflammation), anti-\nbodies to EBV (chronic psychosocial chal-\nlenge), pressor response (cardiovascular\nreactivity, vagal tone), and flexHR (physical\nfitness). Individual scores for allostatic load\nwere calculated by adding the number of indi-\ncators on which criterion for relative risk was\nmet, as listed in Table 2. Because of the absence\nof cardiovascular measures for squatter chil-\ndren, two indices of allostatic load were created.\nIndex 1 excludes cardiovascular measures,\nwhich are included in Index 2. All comparisons\nincluding the squatter group used Index 1. The\nchoice of median cutoffs was dictated by the\naim to represent data distribution across study\ngroups. Measures included in the calculation\nof allostatic load were determined a priori.\nNote that in this population, a combination of\nheavy pathogen load and marginal nutrition re-\nverses the significance of EBV as a marker of\nwell-being. Under these conditions, elevated\nEBV apparently indicates relative immunocom-\npetence rather than chronic psychosocial chal-\nlenge as observed in well-nourished, low patho-\ngen conditions.\nAlternate algorithms for computation of al-\nlostatic load were evaluated; none had substan-\ntial impact on our overall results. One alterna-\ntive was to use the upper quartiles of observed\nrisk as criteria in the summed index, but this\nboth removed most of the data from considera-\ntion, and contravened the aim to assess relative\nwell-being within a normative framework. The\ngoal was to assess sources of normal variation\nrather than of clinical outcomes. Another option\nwas adjustment of the valence for the individual\nbiomarkers. The entire sample showed a\nnegative relationship between HAZ and\nTable 2.

Additionally, chronic psy-\nchosocial stress has been linked to low vari-\nance in cortisol, arguing against attention to\nhigh variance related to variable momentary\nactivation.\nStatistical analyses\nData reduction. Participants contributed a total\nof 784 morning cortisol samples. Group and\nindividual differences in number of samples\n(homeless M \u00bc 9.3, SD \u00bc 1.4; squatter M \u00bc\n9.3, SD \u00bc 1.1; middle class M \u00bc 6.5, SD \u00bc\n2.1; village M \u00bc 10.1, SD \u00bc 3.7), F (3, 820)\n\u00bc 183.35, p , .0001, were taken into account\nby weighting where appropriate in tests in-\nvolving all cortisol values.

Neither meal type (solids,\ndrinks) nor time since meal influenced log\ncortisol once data were corrected for time since\nwaking ( p \u00bc .44). The best fit for cortisol data\nwas obtained by applying two regressions, one\nfor the sharp decline in the first 90 min\npostwaking (log cortisol \u00bc 20.68 \u2013 .30 [time\nawake]), the other for a shallower decline there-\nafter (log cortisol\u00bc20.75 \u2013 .22 [time awake]).\nCortisol variance did not differ in the samples\ncollected before or after 90 min postwaking, F\n(234, 515) \u00bc 0.89, p \u00bc .21. Standardized re-\nsiduals (Z scores) derived from these curves\nwere based on all samples combined and used\nfor all subsequent tests involving cortisol.\nMean and variance of residualized cortisol for\nindividual sample series (cortZ and residual\nSD, respectively) were used as status variables\nfor each case. Thus, cortZ score indicates\nwhether on average a participant has above-\nor below-average cortisol compared to his\npeers, controlling for time since waking.\nResidual SD indicates intraindividual day-to-\nday variation in cortZ or the variation in resid-\nualized cortisol.\nNeither EBV-Ab nor ACT values were nor-\nmally distributed, and were log transformed for\nstatistical analyses. HR measures did not re-\nquire transformation. The anthropometric vari-\nables were expressed with reference to the US\nNCHS 1978 reference population, as standard\ndeviations from median HAZ, weight for age\n(WAZ), and WHZ using the Centers for Dis-\nease Control Anthropometric Software Package\n(CASP 3.1). NCHS standards for WHZ cover\nthrough age 11 years. Calculation of WHZ for\nolder boys is detailed elsewhere (Panter-Brick,\nTodd, & Baker, 1996). For calculation of\nallostatic load, HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ provide\npartially redundant information, so the less\nuniquely informative WAZ was excluded.\nHomeless street children in Nepal 243\nAnalytic strategy. The plan of analysis ad-\ndressed our hypotheses as follows:\n1. Do homeless boys differ from other boys in\nbiomarkers of allostatic load? We used\nANOVA to test the following contrasts,\nand report adjusted R2 (aR2) to indicate\nthe relative importance of group member-\nship in determining the distribution of bio-\nmarkers.

Is overall allostatic load in homeless boys\ngreater than in their urban or rural\npeers? We first assessed whether our com-\nposite indices of allostatic load permit\nmeaningful cross-group comparisons. To\ntest for cross-group homogeneity in pat-\nterns of association among biomarkers,\nwe used the Box test conducted in SPSS\nMANOVA. Similarly, we examined\nwhether group membership modifies the\nassociation of biomarkers with our indices\nof allostatic load. Then, we tested for\ngroup differences in allostatic load, again\nusing univariate ANOVA.\nResults\nPopulation and group characteristics and\nbiomarker status are displayed in Table 3. As\na whole, high physical developmental risk\namong study participants was indicated by\nsevere linear growth loss: HAZ fell well beyond\n2 SD below expected. However, the less severe\nWAZ scores and normative WHZ scores\nsuggest acceptable current nutritional status.\nElevated levels of ACT overall denote high\ninfectious risk and pathogen exposure, but levels\nin villagers stand out as particularly high. The\nnegative relationship between the two immune\nparameters (see lower section of Table 1)\nsuggests that such heavy pathogen loads may\ninterfere with response to EBV antigen. For\nthis reason, we treated EBV as a marker of\nphysical rather than psychosocial burden, where\nincreased values represent lower burden.\nBiomarkers and contrasting lifestyles\nFirst, we undertook a series of group compari-\nsons to address the question of whether bio-\nmarkers of allostatic load differ in homeless\nboys compared to their peers. Overall, groups\nsampled from contrasting living conditions dif-\nfered sharply in study indices, as summarized in\nTable 3. The strength of the differences sug-\ngests that the chronic and concurrent conditions\nexperienced by children in these groups distinc-\ntively affect dimensions of developmental risk\nas reflected in biomarkers, with the sole excep-\ntion of WAZ.\nAverage age was 11.80 + 0.98 years, with\nhomeless and middle-class groups each slightly\nolder than squatter and village groups ( p, .05,\nall post hoc contrasts). Age did not confound\nany of the variables under consideration nor\nfeature as an interaction term in multivariable\nanalyses. In terms of growth status, the respec-\ntive group profiles established for boys sur-\nveyed in the larger sample (N \u00bc 307; Panter-\nBrick, Todd, & Baker, 1996) were replicated\nin the subsample drawn for the present study\n(N \u00bc 107), with one exception.

Urban boys differed\nfrom village boys on all biomarkers included\nin this study. Most notably, urban boys had\nsubstantially lower ACT values, F (1, 101) \u00bc\n327.43, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .76, and somewhat\nhigher EBV-Ab titers, F (1, 101) \u00bc 7.25, p ,\n.01, aR2 \u00bc .06. Urban boys had higher cardio-\nvascular indices: pressor response, F (1, 77)\n\u00bc 26.27, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .28; flexHR, F (1,\n77) \u00bc 24.46, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .26, indicating\nless cardiovascular fitness and vagal tone than\namong village boys. They also had higher\nmean cortisol, F (1, 106) \u00bc 5.68, p , .01,\naR2 \u00bc .06, and less day-to-day variability in\ncortisol values, F (1, 106) \u00bc 10.74, p , .01,\naR2 \u00bc .10, than did villagers. Finally, urban\nboys showed better growth and nutrition out-\ncomes, with greater HAZ, F (1, 95) \u00bc 10.94,\np , .001, aR2 \u00bc .09, and weight for height, F\n(1, 95)\u00bc 4.01, p, .05, aR2 \u00bc .03) than village\nboys.\nHomeless versus squatter and village boys. The\ncontrast between the homeless and squatter or\nvillage boys is particularly informative, given\nthat the homeless population derives largely\nfrom these two groups. Compared to squatters,\nhomeless boys showed both higher pathogen\nexposure: logACT, F (1, 41) \u00bc 15.91, p\n, .001, aR2\u00bc .28; and better current nutritional\nstatus: WHZ, F (1, 40) \u00bc 16.68, p , .001, aR2\n\u00bc .28. They also had higher mean cortisol\nlevels, F (1, 46) \u00bc 7.53, p , .01, aR2 \u00bc .15,\nwhile showing no evidence of greater\nday-to-day variability in cortisol, F (1, 39) \u00bc\n1.79, p , .19. Homeless and squatter boys\nalso showed no differences in EBV-Ab titers\nor growth status (HAZ).\nCompared to villagers, homeless boys\nshowed on average substantially less pathogen\nexposure: logACT, F (1, 51) \u00bc 172.33, p ,\n.001, aR2 \u00bc .77, less vagal tone and cardiovas-\ncular fitness: pressor response, F (1, 53) \u00bc\n42.47, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .49; flexHR, F (1, 53)\n\u00bc 33.22, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .43, and higher\nmean cortisol levels with less day-to-day\nvariability in cortisol: cortZ, F (1, 54) \u00bc 6.70,\np , .05, aR2 \u00bc .11; cortSD, F \u00bc 7.24, p ,\n.05, aR2 \u00bc .14). However, they showed no\nsignificant differences in either EBV-Ab titers\nor growth and nutritional indices.\nFigure 1. Indices of growth and nutritional status for each study group, including height for age (HAZ),\nweight for age (WAZ), and weight for height for age (WHAZ), standardized to NCHS reference values.\nBars denote mean+standard deviations; n \u00bc 107 boys.\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick246\nThus, homeless boys fared worse than squat-\nters, but much better than villagers in terms of\npathogen exposure. They also maintained better\nnutritional status than squatter boys. However,\nthey showed lower vagal tone than village\nboys, and higher mean cortisol levels than\nboth squatter and village boys.\nHomeless versus middle-class boys. The con-\ntrast between homeless and middle-class boys\nassesses the common assumption that by all mea-\nsures, homeless children should manifest more\nallostatic load than their relatively advantaged\ncounterparts. In line with this assumption, home-\nless boys had higher pathogen exposure: logACT,\nF (1, 51) \u00bc 43.49, p , .001, aR2 \u00bc .46;\npoorer growth status: HAZ, F (1, 45) \u00bc 23.61,\np, .001, aR2 \u00bc .34; lower cardiovascular fitness:\nflexHR,F (1, 47)\u00bc 6.03, p, .05, aR2 \u00bc .13; and\nreduced vagal tone: pressor response, F (1, 47)\u00bc\n9.29, p, .01, aR2 \u00bc .19. Unexpectedly, they also\nshowed better current nutritional status (WHZ,\nF\u00bc 9.98, p, .01, aR2\u00bc .17), and showed no sig-\nnificant differences in HPA activity or EBV titers.\nSurvival and exposure effects (newcomers vs.\nestablished). Homeless boys had spent a vari-\nable amount of time living on the streets (range\n\u00bc 0.5\u20136 years). To evaluate the impact of short-\nand long-term exposure to street existence, and\nto probe whether characteristics of the street\npopulation reflect effects of survivorship, we\ncompared newcomers to the street with estab-\nlished street dwellers (homeless for \u00022 years,\nn \u00bc 8 vs. .2 years, n \u00bc 12; 0.88 + 0.23 vs.\n4.17 + 1.27 years, mean + SD). Compared\nto established street children, the newly home-\nless had better nutritional status (WHZ 0.60\n+ 0.50 vs. veteran 0.52 + 0.51, Mann\u2013\nWhitney exact test p\u00bc .05), lower cardiovascu-\nlar fitness (flexHR newcomer 111.6+ 11.4 vs.\nestablished 100.6 + 8.6 bpm, Mann\u2013Whitney\nexact test p \u00bc .04), and marginally higher cor-\ntisol levels (CortZ newcomer 0.441 + 0.209\nvs. established 0.129+ 0.436, Mann\u2013Whitney\nexact test p\u00bc .07). They did not differ in HAZ,\ncortisol variance, EBV-Ab, pressor response,\nor ACT.\nSelection effects (newcomers vs. village and\nsquatters). To examine the effects of self-\nselection, we compared the newcomers to the\ntwo populations from which they originated,\nnamely villagers and squatters. Like all home-\nless boys, newcomers had less exposure to\npathogens, lower cardiovascular fitness, and\nhigher mean cortisol levels than village boys.\nMoreover, newcomers showed the same results\nas all homeless boys in having higher exposure\nto pathogens, higher cortisol, and better nutri-\ntional status than squatter boys. Newcomers to\nthe street, unlike all homeless boys, had better\nnutritional status (WHZ) than did village boys\n(all Mann\u2013Whitney exact tests p , .05).\nBiomarkers and contrasting lifestyles\nNext, we proceeded to test the hypothesis that\nhomeless boys fare worse than their peers, after\nfirst assessing the applicability of our measure\nof allostatic load for cross-group comparisons.\nFigure 2. Cortisol residualized by time of day and study group. Bars denote means+ standard deviations.\nHomeless street children in Nepal 247\nCross-group comparability of composite in-\ndices of allostatic load. Relationships among\nbiomarkers (Table 1, lower section) reflect the\nexpected array of strong and weak covariation,\ngiven the deliberate diversity of time courses,\nsystems, and stressors reflected by the bio-\nmarkers. As such, the complex pattern of covar-\niation seen in Table 1 supports the use of\nmultiple measures to obtain global, rather than\nsystem-specific and hence less broadly\nrepresentative, indices of status.\nIndices 1 and 2 integrate biomarkers to pro-\nvide a global estimate of allostatic burden\nacross several separate though interacting sys-\ntems. For these global estimates to be compa-\nrable across groups, the associations of individ-\nual biomarkers among themselves and with the\nglobal indices may not differ between groups.\nBox\u2019s M test of homogeneity of variances\/\ncovariances across the four groups indicates\nthat the associations between biomarkers do\nnot vary noticeably between groups ( p .\n.30). Moreover, there are no significant effects\nof group on the association of individual com-\nponents with the indices ( p . .10). Although\nthe power to detect differences in associations\namong biomarkers is limited by the small\nsample, these findings tentatively suggest that\nit is meaningful to compare indices of allostatic\nload across groups. These analyses were also\nconducted between two groups of individuals\ndefined by a median split on ACT level, to\nassess the possibility of systemic changes as a\nresult of exposure to pathogens. As with the\nbetween-ecology comparisons, there was no\nevidence that the patterns of association be-\ntween biomarkers were affected by pathogen\nexposure.\nGroup differences in scores for allostatic load.\nScores for each index of allostatic load differed\nsubstantially among study groups: Index 1, F\n(3, 99) \u00bc 11.00, aR2 \u00bc .25, p , .001; Index\n2, F (2, 82) \u00bc 9.74, aR2 \u00bc .18, p , .001), as\nshown in Table 3. Distributions of scores for\nIndex 1 across groups are shown in Figure 3.\nWith respect to the expectation that measures\nof allostatic load would follow a hypothesized\ngradient of ecologic burden with homeless\nhaving greatest load (homeless, village, squatter,\nschool), post hoc analysis identified the gradi-\nent as village, homeless, squatter, school for\nIndex 1. Although adjacent pairs in this gra-\ndient were not significantly different in mean\nscore for Index 1, village\/squatter, and home-\nless\/school showed significant differences\n(F \u00bc 9\u201313, p , .05). By this metric, and con-\ntrary to expectation, village boys had greatest\nallostatic load, closely followed by homeless\nyouth (Figure 3).\nGroup contrasts using Index 2 with cardio-\nvascular markers (Figure 4) yield a slightly\nFigure 3. Frequency distributions of cumulative biomarker Index 1 for allostatic load, accumulated from\nscores for six biomarkers (see Table 2), by study group: (hatched bars) homeless, (open bars) squatter,\n(dotted bars) school, (filled bars) village.\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick248\ndifferent picture, identifying street boys as hav-\ning significantly higher mean scores than both\nvillage and school boys ( p , .05), and village\nboys having marginally higher mean scores\nthan school boys ( p , .1). Thus, both indices\nof allostatic load showed that school boys\n(and to some degree squatters) fared better\nthan homeless and villagers. In addition, home-\nless and village boys alternatively had the high-\nest average allostatic load score depending on\nwhether cardiovascular fitness was included\nin the index.\nFamily composition. Families of homeless boys\nwere more likely to feature a step-parent relative\nto other groups (42 vs. 3%) and less likely to\nfeature both birth parents residing in a nuclear\nhousehold (25 vs. 70%). Similarly, as a group,\norphans and step-children (n \u00bc 17) are more\nlikely to be street children than boys from fam-\nilies with both birth parents (n\u00bc 80; Pearson c2\n\u00bc 30.0, p , .001), to have elevated cortisol\n(Pearson c2 \u00bc 4.04, p \u00bc .04), and show greater\ncardiovascular reactivity (pressor 27.8 + 8.9\nvs. 20.5+ 8.1 bpm, t (1, 63) 2.83, p \u00bc .003)\nas well as lower fitness (flexHR 102+ 10 vs.\n95+ 11 bpm, t (1, 63) 2.29, p \u00bc .01). They\ndid not have greater cortisol variance or levels\nof ACT and EBV. Nonetheless, family compo-\nsition per se did not contribute substantially to\ngroup differences in the variables under consid-\neration, nor did it interact with lifestyle (repre-\nsented by group) in models of allostatic load.\nDiscussion\nThis report addresses the question of whether,\nat the time, homeless street children represented\nthe worst possible condition for children grow-\ning up in Nepal. On a broader level, this ques-\ntion concerns the impact of cumulative expo-\nsure to challenge, and the costs of meeting\nthat challenge, on children growing up under\ngreater social and material disadvantage.\nAnswering this question involves formulating\nmetrics for comparative assessment of burden\nor developmental risk and asking to what extent\nchild burden differs by living conditions. Ac-\ncordingly, we sampled groups representing\nprevalent conditions under which Nepali chil-\ndren grow up, in terms of living with or without\na family, in rural or urban settings, and in\npoverty or relative affluence. We drew multiple\nbiomarkers of developmental risk and biologi-\ncal adversity as well as of psychosocial stress\nand vulnerability, and used them to construct\nan index of allostatic load. Together, contrasts\nof biomarkers and allostatic load across settings\nin which children live permit comparison of the\nsources and extent of developmental risk and\nburden associated with each living condition.\nThis approach provides novel insights into\nFigure 4. Frequency distributions of Index 2 for allostatic load, accumulated from scores for\neight biomarkers (see Table 2), by study group: (hatched bars) homeless, (dotted bars) school, (filled\nbars) village.\nHomeless street children in Nepal 249\ndifferential child well-being that challenge\nsome preconceived notions about categories\nof children at risk.\nOur findings suggest that homeless street\nboys were not the most at-risk group compared\nto others representing prevalent conditions for\nNepali children. Rather, for many measures,\nburden was greatest among village boys. In-\ndeed, the strong urban\u2013rural contrast in bio-\nmarkers of risk and adversity contradicts a\nview that village life is inherently advanta-\ngeous. Markers of physical well-being, infec-\ntion, and nutrition (ACT, anthropometrics),\nwere distinctly unfavorable compared to all\nurban groups, although psychosocial stress or\nactivation indexed by cortisol was indeed low-\nest and cardiovascular fitness highest in the\nrural group. Even the most disenfranchised ur-\nban boys (squatters and street dwellers) fared\nbetter physically and had lower developmental\nrisk (growth and nutrition status) than did vil-\nlage boys, which suggests urban conditions\nprovide concrete advantages despite psychoso-\ncial challenges. In particular, pathogen load\nsharply distinguished village from urban groups.\nHence, our index of allostatic load without cardi-\novascular measures (Index 1) identified village\nchildren as having the greatest burden of cumu-\nlative developmental, psychosocial, and health\nburden. The index that included cardiovascular\nmeasures (Index 2) blunted the urban\u2013rural\ncontrast because all urban groups are relatively\nsedentized and less physically fit. These findings\nalign with multiple lines of evidence identifying\nlower physical fitness and poorer cardiovascular\nhealth, from childhood onward, as a common\ncorrelate of urbanization and changing lifestyles\n(WHO, 2002).\nThe fluidity of homelessness as a status\nheightens the potential for self-selection in\nour study groups, because village or squatter\nboys might leave or return home depending\non current welfare. Our findings suggest that\nhomeless boys share profiles of psychosocial\nand developmental risk that are distinctive\nfrom village and squatter boys: allostatic load\nplaced homeless in a position intermediate be-\ntween a significant village\u2013squatter difference\nin load. Overall, cortisol levels were higher in\nstreet than village or squatter boys, as was nutri-\ntional status. Comparisons of recently homeless\nwith village and squatter boys to assess poten-\ntial selection effects, revealed substantially the\nsame differences in biomarkers as found for\nall homeless boys. Furthermore, a test of survi-\nval and exposure effects that contrasted recent\nwith long-term homeless showed that charac-\nteristic features of homeless boys (increased\ncortisol, lower cardiovascular fitness, better\nnutritional status) were more pronounced in\nthe recently homeless. Thus, boys who become\nand remain homeless may self-select by states\nindexed by greater HPA activity, better nutri-\ntional status, and poor physical fitness, or else\nstreet life very rapidly shapes these dimensions.\nOur data do not permit discrimination between\nthese possibilities.\nRegarding other findings, our observations\nthat boys from squatter families fared better\nthan either their village or homeless counter-\nparts informs widespread concern for develop-\nmental and health risks to children living in in-\ndigent squatter families that have migrated from\nrural to urban settings. Indeed, both homeless\nand urban squatter children are commonly\nincluded by welfare agencies in the catch-all\ncategories of \u201cstreet children\u201d and children \u201cat\nrisk\u201d (Panter-Brick, 2001). Biomarkers of risk\nand indices of allostatic load consistently iden-\ntified squatter boys in our sample as distinct\nfrom villagers as well as their homeless urban\npeers. Boys in squatter families already have\ndaytime experience of the streets, and readily\nmay convert to homelessness when it appears\nnecessary or beneficial. Accordingly, those\nliving with their families exhibited lower allo-\nstatic load than homeless. Findings also con-\nfirmed the anticipated advantage for school\nboys compared not only to homeless, but also\nto all groups regarding overall burden, and\nmost markers of developmental risk and well-\nbeing. That this group showed elevated HPA ac-\ntivity equivalent to homeless possibly reflects\nthe pressure of schoolwork (Panter-Brick &\nPollard, 1999). Equivalent profiles between\nschool and homeless boys underscores both the\nchallenge of interpreting cortisol profiles with-\nout close individual-level contextualization,\nand supports the multidimensional nature of\nwell-being that demands amultimodal approach.\nOur results largely concur with the scant\nexisting literature on the effects of living\nC. M. Worthman and C. Panter-Brick250\nconditions or physical deprivation (stunting) on\nHPA activity in non-Western settings. Prospec-\ntive study of Dominican children has examined\nassociations of adrenal and immune activity\nwith daily family dynamics and household\ncomposition, demonstrating that cortisol in-\ncreases, altered immune function, and subse-\nquent risk for infectious illness paralleled family\nconflict (Flinn & England, 1997, 2003). Reports\nin Jamaican children have identified elevated\ncortisol and resting HRs as correlates of early\ngrowth stunting, implicating stress\/arousal regu-\nlating systems as mediators of long-term effects\nof early deprivation (Fernald & Grantham-\nMcGregor, 1998, 2002; Grantham-McGregor\n& Fernald, 1999). From a further study among\nKathmandu school children (Fernald et al.,\n2003), these investigators reported that a com-\npound measure of stress responsivity was lower\namong stunted than nonstunted controls, al-\nthough associations of stunting with either HR\nor cortisol baselines and responses were slim.\nWe also found no associations of morning corti-\nsol values or variability with stunting (HAZ\n\u20132.0); further, the only significant relationship\nof stunting to cardiovascular response was di-\nminished sitting HR among stunted urban boys\n(86+9 vs. 81+9 bpm, p \u00bc .03).\nThe differences between findings from\nNepal and Jamaica likely are because of the\ncause, extent, and timing of growth retardation:\nNepali children exhibit much greater and per-\nvasive growth impairment, associated with\npathogen burden and nutritional challenges\nfrom gestation onward. Our findings suggest\nthat not all forms of stress (psychosocial,\nenergetic, pathogenic) evoke the same impact\non stress-responsive functions such as attention\/\narousal regulation (Granger, Hood, Dreschel,\nSergeant, & Likos, 2001; Granger & Kivlinghan,\n2003). Nor may the consequent adjustments in\nmetabolic, immunologic, and other endocrine\nfunctions be the same for all sources of stress.\nThus, aswe expand the range of humanvariability\naddressed by research on the causes and conse-\nquences of child stress and adversity, we stand\nto expand and refine our existing models\nconcerning these issues (Heim & Nemeroff,\n2001; Rutter, 1999). Biomarkers help to evaluate\nthe social and economic landscapes of stress and\nreveal that contexts that might be presumed as\n\u201csafe\u201d (rural village, family home) can be\ndeeply challenging to child welfare and con-\nversely, those presumed inherently pathogenic\n(homelessness) can represent individual short-\nterm \u201csolutions\u201d symptomatic of root socioeco-\nnomic problems elsewhere. In the present case,\nto focus attention on homeless street children\nin Kathmandu would be to quit early for re-\ndressing the most pressing challenges to child\nwelfare located in rural poverty and social ecology\nin Nepal.\nTo our knowledge, this report represents the\nfirst application of an allostatic load approach to\nthe multimodal assessment of comparative\nchild stress and developmental risk. We argue\nthat a composite measure is needed to integrate\naspects of mental and physical health risk that\nfrequently co-occur, particularly under the con-\nditions of adversity that many children face\nworldwide. Strong evidence links each of the\nmarkers to health risk and our indices met sta-\ntistical criteria for cross-group comparison.\nBut small differences in our findings using\ntwo slightly different indices illustrate the im-\npact of the choice of markers included in allo-\nstatic load upon study results. Moreover, our\ncross-sectional data preclude prediction of spe-\ncific health outcomes from our index of allo-\nstatic load, as has been done to hone and vali-\ndate the measure as an index of burden in\nstudies of aging (Seeman et al., 2001). Never-\ntheless, as the use of biomarkers and multimo-\ndal research designs expands, development of\nglobal indices such as allostatic load becomes\nincreasingly necessary and merits exploration.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be\nconsidered. First, the broader framework for\nthe work reported here comprised an ethno-\ngraphic evaluation of coping, social compe-\ntence, and life history among homeless boys\n(Baker, 1998; Baker & Panter-Brick, 2000; Ba-\nker, Panter-Brick, & Todd, 1997). The present\nquantitative study was informed by this work,\nbut the design relied on contrasting social\u2013\nmaterial conditions represented by study group\nand included limited individual measures of\ndaily life circumstances or psychological states.\nTherefore, we could not address the role of psy-\nchosocial factors that would drive individual var-\niation and may contribute to the observed group\ndifferences in individual biomarkers or overall\nHomeless street children in Nepal 251\nallostatic load. Such measures should be incor-\nporated in future work that builds on the value\nof a biomarker approach as demonstrated here,\nto examine pathways to individual and group\ndifferences in health or allostatic load. Second,\nour study included only boys and cannot ad-\ndress gender differences in performance of\nour biomarkers. For instance, the genders dif-\nfer in adrenal regulation from birth (Davis &\nEmory, 1995), and in effects of challenging\nor adverse experiences on HPA activity during\nchildhood (Flinn et al., 1996; Tout et al.,\n1998). Nonetheless, much work overlooks or\ndoes not explicitly probe gender in relation\nto the developmental psychobiology of stress;\nhence, gender differences in stress\u2013responsive\nsystems remain an important area for further\ninvestigation. Third, our cross-sectional study\ndoes not permit consideration of effects of\nearly conditions on observed group differ-\nences in biomarker status. Thus, effects of lo-\ncale-specific antigen exposures during devel-\nopment of immune function (McDade, 2005)\nmay explain the profiles of immune markers\nwe observed. Differences in HPA activity\namong our study groups also may reflect con-\nditions of gestation and subsequent develop-\nment that could contribute to variation in\nHPA activity. For instance, chronically\nstressed Dominican children exhibited low un-\nstressed levels of cortisol (Flinn & England,\n1995), orphanage-reared Romanian children\nexhibit altered HPA activity (Gunnar, Morison,\nChisholm, & Schuder, 2001), and gestational\nstress has been associated with increased HPA\nreactivity in children (Clark et al., 1996).\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study suggests the value of\nincreasing the range of human cultural and\nphysical conditions for understanding the\nsources and consequences of childhood stress, of\nboth the acute, traumatic and chronic, everyday\nvarieties. The use of biomarkers, well-selected\ncomparison groups, and close in situ study illu-\nminate the complex developmental pathways\nmediating both vulnerability and resilience to\ndifficult life circumstances. We underscore\nthe importance of such work for enhancing\nthe applicability of developmental research to\nthe substantial worldwide challenges to mental\nand physical health imposed by childhood\nadversity.\nReferences\nAdelekan, D.
