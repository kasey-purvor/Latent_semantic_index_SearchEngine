The formulation makes use of the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) such that\nfunctions obtained from a priori knowledge of the solution space can be incorporated in the\nelement formulation. An enrichment strategy is described, in which boundary integral equa-\ntions formed at additional collocation points are used to provide auxiliary equations in order to\naccommodate the extra introduced unknowns. In addition, an e\u000ecient numerical quadrature\nmethod is outlined for the evaluation of strongly singular and hypersingular enriched boundary\nintegrals. Finally, results are shown for mixed mode crack problems; these illustrate that the\nintroduction of PUM enrichment provides for an improvement in accuracy of approximately\none order of magnitude in comparison to the conventional unenriched DBEM.\nKeywords: BEM, fracture, Partition of unity, enrichment\n1 Introduction\nComputational fracture mechanics, essentially a subject centred on the problem of modelling the\nsingularity created by a crack tip, is a topic which has been studied extensively over recent years.\nMany methods are available, but all share the common goal of determining accurate stress intensity\n\u0003corresponding author: Dr Jon Trevelyan, Durham University, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences,\nSouth Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom. e-mail: jon.trevelyan@durham.ac.uk, tel: (44)191-334-2522, fax:\n(44)191-334-2408\n1\nfactors (SIFs) for each of the modes of fracture (KI , KII , and KIII). These parameters, which\nquantify the strength of the singularity created by the crack tip for a certain geometry and loading,\noften need to be determined to high levels of accuracy. In particular, fatigue crack growth laws\nwhich rely on SIFs raised to certain positive powers magnify any errors obtained in KN (where\nN = I; II; III is the mode of fracture) further exacerbating the problem.\nThe vast majority of computational methods developed for fracture analysis are based on\nthe Finite Element Method (FEM). Watwood [1] demonstrated that if conventional piecewise\npolynomial shape functions are used to analyse bodes containing cracks, then very high mesh\ndensities are required in the region surrounding the crack tip to obtain relatively low errors in\nSIFs. Even so, with large numbers of degrees of freedom (DOF), errors in the region of 5% were\nencountered with di\u000eculties also presented in obtaining reliable KN values using displacements\nand stresses extrapolated to the crack tip. However the implementation did provide a method\nto model general fracture problems. Further improvements to the FEM include special crack-tip\nshape functions that incorporate the required\np\n\u001a (where \u001a is the radial distance from the crack\ntip) variation for displacements around the crack tip and quarter-point elements, independently\nformulated by Henshell and Shaw [2] and Barsoum [3]. These simply require the repositioning of\nthe mid-node to a quarter-point position. However, Ingra\u000bea and Manu demonstrated the size\ndependence of quarter-point elements preventing a general strategy for their use being formulated.\nFurthermore, the extent of the singular region created by the crack tip is restricted to the size\nof the quarter-point element when in reality it may extend further over a larger region. Further\ncomplications arise in the use of quarter-point elements for curved crack geometries.\nOther attempts to improve the FEM for fracture include a hybrid-element approach, \frst\nintroduced by Tong et al. [5] and more recently extended by Karihaloo et al. [6], while a more\nrecent approach, known as the fractal \fnite element method (FFEM) [7] has been developed.\nThe \frst uses a complex variable approach in which a special \\hybrid\" element incorporates the\ncorrect crack tip behaviour. The latter technique models the singular region surrounding the crack\ntip as a self-similar mesh in which several layers, progressively decreasing in size, are used. The\nlarge number of unknowns created are transformed into a small number of global unknowns using\nappropriate interpolation functions. Both methods exhibit accurate results for relatively coarse\nmeshes but do exhibit certain disadvantages. In particular, in the case of multiple cracks with\ncracks tips in close proximity to one another, problems will occur in the formation of the \\hybrid\"\n2\nelement (hybrid-element method) and singular region (FFEM). This would also be the case for any\ngeometrical feature that lay near the crack tip. In these cases Boundary Element Methods, in which\nonly discretisation of the boundary is required, present a distinct advantage in the context of Linear\nElastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). One further note is made where, in the implementation of [6]\nin which hybrid elements are used, much emphasis is placed on the evaluation of higher-order times\nof the Williams expansion. However, current industrial practice in fracture and fatigue assessment\nis almost entirely based on the \frst-order values of KN and it is this approach that is taken in the\npresent work.\nThe Boundary Element Method (BEM) is another computational method that, in recent years,\nhas found a growing popularity. It o\u000bers the advantage that the entire method is based on param-\neters on the boundary, essentially reducing the dimensionality of the problem by one. It too su\u000bers\nfrom the same problems encountered in the FEM in that polynomials are insu\u000ecient when trying to\nmodel a singular problem such as crack, unless a re\fned mesh is used. Quarter-point elements have\nbeen successfully applied to the BEM [8] although these too su\u000ber from the same limitations that\nhave been encountered in the FEM. However, since the BEM represents tractions independently\nof displacements, special crack-tip shape functions [9] are required to capture the \u001a\u0000\n1\n2 variation in\ntractions seen at the crack-tip. Another technique known as the Subtraction of Singularity Method,\noriginally introduced by Papamichel and Symm [10], removes the singular \feld of the crack leaving\nthe non-singular \feld to be modelled numerically. This was extended further by Portela et al. [11]\nwho applied the method in such a way that Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) were output directly\nas unknowns. Excellent results were shown but the method encountered di\u000eculties due to the use\nof the Williams solution which is only valid in a near \feld region. The problem was overcome by\npartitioning the domain into near and far-\feld regions at the cost of ease of implementation. More\nrecently, Watson [12] developed a method in which special singular shape functions are created\nusing eigenfunctions from the Williams expansion [13] that describe a crack tip singularity. In the\nformation of these shape functions, additional unknowns are introduced requiring the use of aux-\niliary Boundary Integral Equations (BIEs). Certain restrictions are made on the type of elements\nused and the implementation of the additional BIEs becomes rather complex, but the method does\nshow an improvement over other boundary element methods. Probably the most popular BEM\nat present used to model fracture problems is the Dual Boundary Element Method originally de-\nveloped by Portela et al. [14]. It overcomes the problem encountered when the conventional BEM\n3\nis applied to a model containing coincident crack surfaces, where a singular system results from\ncollocation at identical nodal positions. The DBEM instead provides a Traction Boundary Integral\nEquation (TBIE) that is independent of the conventional Displacement BIE (DBIE) and applies\nthe TBIE for collocation on one of the crack surfaces while the DBIE is applied for collocation at\nall other points. The DBEM is a robust method that can be applied to various crack geometries\nwhile achieving consistently accurate results, though this comes at the cost of a requirement to\nevaluate some hypersingular boundary integrals.\nAlthough BEM approaches have advanced to provide better than 1% accuracy with compara-\ntively few elements, it is important to strive for greater accuracy still. In particular, SIFs derived\nfrom numerical approximations may be used to determine fatigue lives according to various crack\ngrowth laws. These laws typically give the crack growth rate from expressions containing a term\nKmI , in which the exponent m is typically of value 2 to 4 for metals, but can be considerably\nhigher for polymers and other materials, e.g. as high as 16 for a polyethylene [15]. More accu-\nrate determination of SIFs will therefore be of great value in improving the quality of fatigue life\nestimates.\nA relatively recent research area that has shown considerable success is the idea of applying\nenrichment through the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) [16]. In particular, the Extended Finite\nElement Method (X-FEM) [17] has developed into a prominent computational method, with a wide\nrange of applications and a rapidly expanding research community. Fracture problems, in which\na singularity is found at a crack tip and a discontinuity experienced across the crack face, have\nbeen used to study enrichment with X-FEM. Heaviside functions and a basis that encompasses\nthe solution space of crack tip displacements are introduced through enrichment providing the a\npriori knowledge that leads to higher accuracy. Also, by representing the crack independently of\nthe mesh, crack propagation simulation times are dramatically reduced without the need to remesh\non each crack increment. The use of level sets to represent the crack has been shown to provide a\nuseful methodology for crack propagation studies [18].\nFracture mechanics computations have been considered using meshfree methods from the early\npapers on methods [19]; Nguyen et al. [20] provide a useful recent review and include a discussion\nof the practical use of the methods for cracked bodies. Meshfree algorithms for fracture mechanics\nremain a subject of considerable research activity, with recent work focussing on locally enriched\napproximations for problems containing material and geometric non-linearity [21, 22]. Liew et al.\n4\n[23] extended enriched meshless schemes to a meshless boundary integral formulation, using similar\nenrichment to the current paper.\nIn this paper enrichment through the PUM is applied to the Boundary Element Method to\nallow accurate evaluation of SIFs. The formulation closely follows that of the DBEM to allow\nmodels to contain coincident crack surfaces but does present entirely new terms within the BIEs\nto apply enrichment. The technique used to calculate the singular and hypersingular enriched\nboundary integrals is shown and the method of introducing additional collocation points to solve for\nauxiliary unknowns is described. Finally, Mode I and Mode II SIFs for various crack con\fgurations\nare evaluated and comparisons made with the DBEM and other numerical solutions.\n2 The Dual Boundary Element Method\nThe most widely accepted Boundary Element Method to model general fracture problems is the\nDual Boundary Element Method in which the conventional Displacement Boundary Integral Equa-\ntion (DBIE) is used for collocation on one of the crack surfaces and the independent Traction\nBoundary Integral Equation (TBIE) on the other. We consider a domain \n 2 R2, having boundary\n\u0000 \u0011 @\n. The DBIE is given by\nCij(x\n0)uj(x0) +\u0000\nZ\n\u0000\nTij(x\n0;x)uj(x)d\u0000(x)\n=\nZ\n\u0000\nUij(x\n0;x)tj(x)d\u0000(x); i; j = x; y (1)\nwhere Tij and Uij are the traction and displacement fundamental solutions, x\n0 and x are the source\n(i.e. collocation) and \feld points that lie on the surface \u0000, uj and tj are displacements and tractions\nand Cij(x\n0)uj(x0) represents a jump term due to the singular integral at x0. All integrals are taken\nover the general boundary \u0000 and the integral \u0000\nR\nrepresents a Cauchy Principal Value integral. The\nTBIE is given by\n1\n2\ntj(x\n0) + ni(x0)=\nZ\n\u0000\nSkij(x\n0;x)uk(x)d\u0000(x)\n= ni(x\n0)\u0000\nZ\n\u0000\nDkij(x\n0;x)tk(x)d\u0000(x); i; j; k = x; y (2)\nwhere Skij and Dkij represent fundamental solutions that are derived by di\u000berentiating Tij and\nUij and the integral =\nR\nrepresents a Hadamard \fnite-part integral. In the crack modelling procedure\n5\nproposed by Portela et al. an assumption is made that all elements on which the TBIE is applied\nare discontinuous; these have the property that nodes are not shared between adjacent elements\nbut are instead placed at interior points. This ensures continuity of displacement derivatives at\nthe collocation points (a requirement for the evaluation of Hadamard \fnite-part integrals) and\nforces all source points x0 to lie on smooth boundaries. As a consequence of this, the jump term\nin (2) has been written as 12 tj(x\n0). The form Cij(x0) is retained for the jump term in (1) since the\nDBIE is used when collocating over the non-crack portions of \u0000, and this may be discretised using\ncontinuous elements.\nIn the implementation proposed by Portela et al. a large portion of the e\u000bort required to employ\nthe above equations is focused on the evaluation of the strongly singular and hypersingular integrals.\nIn fact, if \rat elements are used along the crack surface these singular terms can be evaluated\nanalytically using rather simple expressions. Other boundaries can be modelled using continuous\nand semi-discontinuous elements thus creating a robust and accurate method for fracture analysis.\n3 Formulation\nThe Partition of Unity Method, which can be attributed to Melenk and Babu\u0014ska, provides the\nbasis of enrichment in the present paper. It states, that if a set of functions forms a partition of\nunity (that is, the sum of those functions is equal to unity at any point within a domain) then an\narbitrary set of functions can be incorporated within the approximation. Of course, the functions\nare chosen to correspond to singularities or discontinuities in the domain from a priori knowledge\nof the solution space, thus allowing fewer degrees of freedom to capture the required \feld. Using\nthis, displacements for a particular element n can be expressed in the following form\nunj (\u0018) =\nMX\na=1\nNa(\u0018)u\nna\nj +\nMX\na=1\nLX\nl=1\nNa(\u0018) \nU\nl (\u0018)A\nna\njl (3)\nwhere \u0018 2 (\u00001; 1) is the local coordinate, Na is the conventional Lagrangian shape function for\nlocal node a,  Ul is the set of L basis functions used for enrichment and M is the number of nodes\nper element. unaj , formerly a nodal displacement, is now a nodal coe\u000ecient along with A\nna\njl . In\nthe present work where crack tip singularities are encountered, the basis functions are chosen to\ncorrespond to Williams' solution for displacements around a crack tip. If the terms of O(\u001a1=2) are\n6\nconsidered in the expansion, then L = 4 and the following enrichment basis vector can be written\n U (\u001a; \u0012) =\n\u001ap\n\u001a cos\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n\u0013\n;\np\n\u001a sin\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n\u0013\n;\np\n\u001a sin\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n\u0013\nsin(\u0012);\np\n\u001a cos\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n\u0013\nsin(\u0012)\n\u001bT\n(4)\nThis basis, which incorporates both Mode I and II components, is the same basis vector used by\nMoes et al. [17] in the implementation of the XFEM. Thus, displacements are enriched in the\nBEM using the same formulation. However, Boundary Element Methods di\u000ber slightly in that\ntractions are represented independently of displacements creating an opportunity for enrichment\nof tractions.\nIt should be made clear that the enrichment of the displacements in this fashion, using the term\np\n\u001a whose derivative becomes in\fnite at \u001a = 0, therefore implicitly contains the stress singularity\nat the crack tip. It is not necessary to enrich tractions as well as displacements in order to capture\nthe singularity. Indeed, in the present work only traction free cracks are considered precluding the\nneed for traction enrichment, but it would be entirely possible, using the appropriate expressions\nfor stresses around a crack tip given by Williams, to formulate a Partition of Unity using a basis\nvector similar in nature to (4).\n3.1 Enrichment of the Displacement Boundary Integral Equation\nThe \frst step that is required before enrichment can be applied to the DBIE is to express the\nintegral equation (1) in its discretised form. This is given by\nCij(x\n0)uj(x0) +\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nPnaij u\nna\nj =\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nQnaij t\nna\nj (5)\nwhere\nPnaij =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Tij [x\n0;x(\u0018)]Jn(\u0018)d\u0018 (6a)\nQnaij =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Uij [x\n0;x(\u0018)]Jn(\u0018)d\u0018 (6b)\nNe is the number of elements and J\nn(\u0018) is the Jacobian of the transformation (x; y) ! \u0018 for\nelement n. The enriched BIE is then formed by substituting expression (3) for displacements\n7\nwhile also expressing the source point displacement uj(x\n0) in the same manner. The jump term is\nthen distributed across nodes within the element containing the source point using the technique\ndescribed by Perrey-Debain et al. [24] allowing the enriched BIE to be written as\nCij(x\n0)\n \nMX\na=1\nNa(\u0018p)u\nna\nj +\nMX\na=1\n4X\nl=1\nNa(\u0018p) \nU\nl (\u0018p)A\nna\njl\n!\n+\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nPnaij u\nna\nj +\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\n4X\nl=1\n~PnaijlA\nna\njl\n=\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nQnaij t\nna\nj (7)\nwhere n is the number of the element containing x0 and \u0018p refers to the local coordinate of the source\npoint. It will be shown in the next section that the formulation requires collocation at some non-\nnodal locations within the element. This is accommodated in (7) by expressing the displacement\ncomponent in the jump term in the enriched form (3), and interpolating over element n using\nLagrangian shape functions. In this equation, also, the terms Pnaij and Q\nna\nij are unchanged from\nEqns. (6a) and (6b) while the new enriched term ~Pnaijl is given by\n~Pnaijl =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Tij [x\n0;x(\u0018)] Ul (\u0018)J\nn(\u0018)d\u0018 (8)\nBy inspecting the terms within this integral it can be seen that, with kernel Tij of O(1=r) (where\nr := jx\u0000 x0j is the distance between the source and \feld points) and  Ul of O(\np\n\u001a), it is clear that\nan appropriate numerical integration procedure is required that is capable of evaluating integrals\nwhich incorporate fundamental solutions which are strongly singular and basis functions which\nexhibit in\fnite gradients at the crack tip. Details of such a routine are given in section 4.2.\nIt might be noted that the coe\u000ecients Anajl , that multiply the enrichment functions at the node\na on the element n, are each acting as an alias for the stress intensity factors. It is possible to\nadopt a di\u000berent enrichment strategy in which the functions are more directly related to the stress\nintensity factors. Such a basis has been considered in \fnite element context by Benzley [25] and in a\nmeshfree context by Du\rot & Nguyen-Dang [26] and Fleming et al. [27]. The present authors have\nalso considered this approach for enrichment of DBEM approximations, and this is the subject\nof a di\u000berent article. It should be noted that the results of the two enrichment approaches are of\ncomparable accuracy.\n8\n3.2 Enrichment of the Traction Boundary Integral Equation\nThe Dual Boundary Element Method of Portela et al. makes use of an independent BIE known\nas the Traction Boundary Integral Equation (TBIE) formed by di\u000berentiating the DBIE. The cost\nof this is to produce a BIE that contains not only strongly singular integrals of O(1=r) but also\nhypersingular integrals of O(1=r2) that require special consideration. Before enrichment is applied\nto the TBIE, the discretised form of the unenriched boundary integral is\n1\n2\ntj(x\n0) + ni(x0)\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nEnakiju\nna\nk = ni(x\n0)\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nFnakijt\nna\nk (9)\nwhere the terms Enakij and F\nna\nkij are expressed as\nEnakij =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Skij [x\n0;x(\u0018)]Jn(\u0018)d\u0018 (10a)\nFnakij =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Dkij [x\n0;x(\u0018)]Jn(\u0018)d\u0018 (10b)\nThe boundary integral equation given in (10a) is hypersingular of O(1=r2) while that in (10b) is\nstrongly singular of O(1=r) . The enriched form of the BIE is then given by substituting Eqn. (3)\ninto (9), yielding\n1\n2\n\u0012 MX\na=1\nNa(\u0018p)t\na\nj\n\u0013\n+ ni(x\n0)\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nEnakiju\nna\nk\n+ni(x\n0)\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\n4X\nl=1\n~EnakijlA\nna\nkl\n= ni(x\n0)\nNeX\nn=1\nMX\na=1\nFnakijt\nna\nk (11)\nwhere\n~Enakijl =\nZ 1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Skij [x\n0;x(\u0018)] Ul (\u0018)J\nn(\u0018)d\u0018 (12)\nif element n is enriched, otherwise ~Enakijl = 0. Clearly, with the introduction of the term Skij which\nis of O(1=r2), the evaluation of the singular integral becomes more involved than that described\nin the previous section. However, using a convenient technique to subtract the singularity, it will\nbe shown that in fact the singular term can be evaluated without undue di\u000eculty. Notice that,\n9\nalthough enrichment is not applied to tractions, the jump term in (11) is expressed in terms of\nnodal tractions and shape functions. This is exactly the same technique which was applied to\nthe DBIE to allow collocation at any general point. Further explanation of this is given in the\nimplementation section.\nEquations (7) and (11) are fundamental to the enriched BEM where, in the same manner as\nthe DBEM, one is used for collocation on all boundaries including one of the crack surfaces while\nthe other is used solely for the opposite crack surface. What is new in this method is the ability to\nincorporate functions that are known to model the local displacement \feld of a crack tip, thereby\nincreasing accuracy for a given number of degrees of freedom (DOF).\n4 Implementation\nWith each basis function in expression (4) incurring an additional DOF, and each enriched node\npotentially using four basis functions, it becomes clear that a fully enriched model will lead to\na substantial increase in demand for computing resources. Therefore, to optimise both accuracy\nand e\u000eciency a selective enrichment strategy must be employed. We choose to enrich elements on\nor near the crack since it is this local region where the basis functions of (4) are valid. Figure 1\nillustrates a selective enrichment strategy in which elements that lie within a certain distance from\nthe crack tip are chosen to apply the basis functions. In Figure 1 the crack surfaces \u0000+ and \u0000\u0000 are\ndepicted as being separated by a \fnite crack opening displacement. This is for illustrative purposes\nonly; in practice the crack surfaces are coincident, as are the nodes that lie on these surfaces. The\nsystem of equations is then formed by using Eqns. (7) and (11) throughout with (11) used for\ncollocating on \u0000\u0000 and (7) for all other points.\n4.1 Additional collocation points\nDisplacements that lie within the enrichment region are expressed in terms of unaj and A\nna\njl and,\nsince each term Anajl represents an additional degree of freedom, additional boundary integral\nequations are required to yield a square system. Watson [12] derived three additional BIEs by\ndi\u000berentiating the fundamental solutions Uij and Tij with respect to the source points x\n0 but made\nthe restriction that Hermitian elements are used. The Enriched Boundary Element Method makes\nno such restrictions and is therefore much simpler to implement in an existing BEM code. Instead,\n10\nthe method makes use of additional collocation points located on elements where enrichment is\napplied, an approach which has been successfully applied to the PUM boundary element analysis\nof wave problems [24]. Figure 2 illustrates the additional points applied to four enriched elements\n(two on the upper surface and two on the lower) that lie on \rat crack elements. In the case of\n\rat elements aligned with the crack tip, only three additional points are required for each enriched\nelement. This can be explained by considering the basis functions seen in (3) and referring to the \rat\nenriched elements illustrated in Figure 2. All nodes either lie at \u0012 = \u0019 (on the upper crack surface)\nor \u0012 = \u0000\u0019 (on the lower crack surface). The constant \u0012 has the e\u000bect of reducing the basis to\n Ul = f\np\n\u001ag. As a result, since only one additional DOF is introduced for each enriched node, three\nDOF will be introduced for each enriched element, requiring three additional collocation points. In\nthe general case of curved elements, the full set of four basis functions is available requiring twelve\nadditional points to be applied to each enriched element.\nIt should be pointed out that the reduction of the basis to  Ul = f\np\n\u001ag for \rat elements causes\nthe approximation to resemble the use of quarter-point elements. However, the new formulation\nis imposing the enrichment in a more general way that can be readily applied to curved cracks,\nwhich will be the subject of another paper, and with multiple enriched elements. Moreover, we will\nproceed in Section 5 to show that the new formulation provides for improved accuracy and more\nrapid convergence in comparison with quarter-point elements.\nNumerous tests were run to investigate the sensitivity of the SIF results to the positions of\nthese additional collocation points where positions that lay both on the boundary (x0 2 \u0000) and\nexternal to this boundary (x0 62 \n) were tried. These points were also placed on unenriched and\nenriched elements to determine the optimum location. It was found that the best results were\nobtained by placing the points on enriched elements (on the boundary) and that the location of\nthe points within these elements had little e\u000bect on the results. Increased errors arise if additional\ncollocation points are located very close to nodes, where collocation also takes place. This is to\nbe expected, since eventually, in the limit as the additional point approaches a nodal point, two\nidentical equations are produced leading to a singular system.\n11\n4.2 Numerical integration of strongly singular and hypersingular en-\nriched integrals\nMuch of the e\u000bort required to implement the DBEM is focused on evaluating the hypersingular\nintegrals of the TBIE. The same is true in the Enriched Boundary Element Method but with the\nadded complication of developing methods for evaluating singular integrals that not only must\ncope with collocation points lying at any general position within an element, but must also in-\nclude the enrichment functions  Ul . This is true also of the strongly singular integrals seen in the\nDBIE. The evaluation of the non-enriched singular integrals is well documented, with analytical\nexpressions or other singular numerical quadrature techniques available. There are also various\nmethods available for the evaluation of singular and hypersingular integrals. Some use quadrature,\nfor example Ioakimidis [28], but in the present work we use the technique developed by Guiggiani\net al. [29] because it is both computationally e\u000ecient and easily adapted, as we show herein, for\nthe inclusion of general enrichment functions. This draws upon Aliabadi & Hall [30], who were the\n\frst to expand the integrand in a Taylor series, and further works by Guiggiani & Gigante [31] and\nGuiggiani & Casalini [32]. Assuming that enrichment is applied to discontinuous elements along\nthe crack edge, the following formula is used to evaluate the enriched hypersingular integrals (8)\nand (12) which are of O(1=r) and O(1=r2) respectively,\nI =\nZ +1\n\u00001\n\u0014\nF (\u0018p; \u0018)\u0000\n\u0012\nF\u00002(\u0018p)\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p)2 +\nF\u00001(\u0018p)\n\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p\n\u0013\u0015\nd\u0018\n+ F\u00001(\u0018p) ln\n\f\f\f\f 1\u0000 \u0018p\u00001\u0000 \u0018p\n\f\f\f\f\n+ F\u00002(\u0018p)\n\u0012\n\u0000 1\n1\u0000 \u0018p +\n1\n\u00001\u0000 \u0018p\n\u0013\n\u0018p 2 (\u00001; 1) (13)\nwhere the singular integrand F (\u0018p; \u0018) can be expressed as\nF (\u0018p; \u0018) =\nF\u00002(\u0018p)\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p)2 +\nF\u00001(\u0018p)\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p) (14)\n12\nThe terms F\u00002(\u0018p) and F\u00001(\u0018p) are regular functions determined by a Taylor series expansion of\nthe integrand about the source point, and are given by\nF\u00002(\u0018p) =DS\u00002(\u0018p)Na(\u0018p) Ul (\u0018p) (15a)\nF\u00001(\u0018p) =D\n\u0014\nS\u00002(\u0018p)\n\u0012\nNa(\u0018p)h(\u0018p)\nd Ul (\u0018p)\nd\u0018\n+  Ul (\u0018p)\n\u0012\nh(\u0018p)\ndNa(\u0018p)\nd\u0018\n+Na(\u0018p)g(\u0018p)\n\u0013\u0013\n+ S\u00001(\u0018p)Na(\u0018p)h(\u0018p) Ul (\u0018p)\n\u0015\n(15b)\nwhere D is a constant and the functions S\u00001(\u0018p), S\u00002(\u0018p), h(\u0018p) and g(\u0018p) are algebraic expressions\ninvolving the components r;i, n;i and the Jacobian of transformation J\nn(\u0018p). A full de\fnition of\nthese terms is given in the Appendix. Once these expressions are substituted in, the \frst term in\nexpression (13) then becomes regular and can be evaluated using standard quadrature formulae\nwhile the latter two are analytical expressions for evaluating the singular components. Conveniently,\nexpression (13) can be modi\fed easily to cope with integrals of O(1=r) by letting F\u00002(\u0018p) = 0.\nThis allows it to be used for all strongly singular and hypersingular integrals within the enriched\nboundary element method.\nOne feature of using Eqn. (13) to evaluate singular integrals is that, due to its general nature,\nthere are no restrictions on the type of element over which the integral is being taken. Thus, when\nimplementing the method, it is entirely possible to use curved elements along the crack faces.\nA common feature among PUM implementations is the e\u000bect seen on the conditioning of the\nsystem due to enrichment. This was also the case in the present work where it was found that as\nthe number of enriched elements was increased, the conditioning deteriorated. For example, in the\ntypical case containing a crack modelled with four elements on each of \u0000+ and \u0000\u0000 and enrichment\nonly applied to the crack-tip elements, a condition number of 7:9 \u0002 109 was experienced. When\nall elements along the crack edge were enriched this increased to 2:6 \u0002 1014. In the case of a\nfully enriched BEM model, the problem is a serious issue. However, by implementing the selective\nenrichment strategy described previously, the situation is much improved.\nThe above scheme di\u000bers from standard integration schemes used for singular integrations over\nquarter-point boundary elements, which use a vanishing Jacobian to cancel the singularity. It is\nimportant to note that the above scheme allows for collocation of the BIE at non-nodal points on\nthe element, which is a feature of our algorithm, and for the distribution of the associated jump\n13\nterm to the nodes.\n5 Results\n5.1 Mode I problems\nTo illustrate the improvements seen by enriching elements around the crack tip an edge crack in\na square plate was modelled using a geometry a=w = 0:5 and h=w = 0:5 as shown in Fig. 3.\nAll elements are 3-noded, quadratic, discontinuous boundary elements. Initially enrichment was\napplied to elements adjacent to the crack tip, but the enrichment region was increased beyond this\nto other crack elements in subsequent tests. The J-integral technique, as originally developed by\nRice [33], was applied to \fnd stress intensity factors. The boundary of the model was split into lines\nwhere, in each step of re\fnement, additional elements were added to each line with equal element\ndivisions. The crack itself had a minimum of two elements on each surface up to a maximum of\neight, with no grading towards the crack tip. This is in contrast to the previous study by Portela\net al. [14] in which all models were graded; it is expected that similar grading would improve the\nresults of the current algorithm. After varying the enrichment region it was found that optimum\nresults were obtained by enriching only the elements adjacent to the crack tip. As the number of\nenriched elements was increased beyond this, the conditioning of the system degraded adversely\na\u000becting the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, by adopting the strategy of solely enriching\ncrack tip elements, the number of additional DOF introduced was also kept to a minimum. We\nnote that the conditioning may be related to the relationships between the coe\u000ecients Anajl and\nthe SIFs. The errors in normalised SIFs are given by\n\" =\n\f\f\f\f\fKNnorm \u0000K\nref\nNnorm\nKrefNnorm\n\f\f\f\f\f\u0002 100% (16)\nwhere\nKNnorm =\nKN\n\u001b\np\n\u0019a\n(17)\nand KrefNnorm denotes the normalised reference solution. For the edge crack, results evaluated using\nthe DBEM and the enriched BEM with elements adjacent to the crack tip enriched are illustrated\nin Figure 4. For only twelve additional DOF it can be seen that enrichment provides a substantial\n14\nincrease in accuracy of approximately one order of magnitude. For example, with forty nine ele-\nments on the boundary, an error of 0:03% is achieved while the DBEM exhibits an error of 0:49%.\nBoth methods were found to converge to the reference value of 3:0103 [34] while errors for the\nenriched BEM were consistently lower than those for the DBEM.\nThe performance of the PUM enriched DBEM is compared, in Figure 5, against the unenriched\nDBEM and against the use of quarter-point boundary elements, in converging to the reference\nsolution of Civelek and Erdogan [34]. This comparison shows the use of PUM enrichment to have\na striking improvement over both earlier algorithms.\nThe problem of a central crack was also considered where, due to symmetry, only half the\nrectangular sheet was meshed for analysis. Figure 6 illustrates the central crack problem along\nwith a mesh used for analysis indicating the line of symmetry. SIF results are compared to the\nunenriched DBEM in Table 1. In a similar fashion to the edge crack problem, the normalised SIFs\nare consistently more accurate than those evaluated using the DBEM. Even with a coarse mesh of\n17 elements, the enriched BEM is capable of evaluating the SIF to within 1%. The improvement\no\u000bered by the PUM enrichment is not so striking in this example. However, this is not a general\nfeature of enriched DBEM solutions for centre-cracked plate problems, and we will proceed to show\nsome clearer improvements in section 5.2.\n5.2 Mixed mode problems\nIn the previous two studies all cracks were subject to purely mode I loading while in many cases,\nmixed mode loading is more realistic. Before mixed mode problems can be analysed however,\ncertain modi\fcations are made to the J-integral to allow the decomposition into each of the modes\nof fracture. This decomposition technique, illustrated by Aliabadi [36] allows the J-integral to be\nsplit into the following components\nJI =\nK2I\nE0\n; JII =\nK2II\nE0\n(18)\nwhere E0 represents modi\fed Young's Modulus for plane strain or plane stress. In this way, each\nof the two SIFs can determined.\nThe \frst example used to illustrate the accuracy of the enriched BEM for mixed mode fracture\nis that of an oblique edge crack as studied by Wilson [37] using the boundary collocation technique.\n15\nThe geometry of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 7 where crack angles, \f, of 45\u000e and 62:5\u000e were\nanalysed with crack lengths varying from a=w = 0:3 to 0:6. An analytical solution is not available\nfor this problem. Therefore instead of undertaking an error analysis, the results are compared\ngraphically against those presented by Wilson. Both Mode I and II normalised SIFs are plotted in\nFig. 8 for the varying crack lengths where excellent agreement with Wilson's results is observed.\nFinally, a mixed mode problem of an inclined centre crack (see Fig. 9) in a \fnite plate was\nanalysed with accurate results published by Murakami [38] and additional results given by Portela\net al. [14] using the DBEM. In the analysis, various J-integral paths were used to test the robustness\nof the method where in each, the path described a circular contour centred at the crack tip starting\nand \fnishing on nodal points lying on the crack surface. This is illustrated in Fig. 10 along with the\npath numbering used in the analysis. Using a crack length of a=w = 0:5 inclined at 45\u000e, normalised\nKI and KII values were determined for J-integral paths 2 to 5. Two meshes were used with four\nand six elements on each line where, in contrast to the work carried out in [14], no grading of\nthe mesh was used. The results for Mode I and Mode II SIFs are illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12\nrespectively along with the results obtained using the unenriched DBEM in [14] using six elements\non each crack line.\nFor the Mode I and II results, it can be seen that in all but one case the enriched BEM gives\nmore accurate results for both meshes. Bearing in mind that in both meshes uniform grading is\nused, it is expected that even more accurate results would be obtained if grading was used. It can\nalso be seen from the plots that the results of the enriched BEM are more consistently accurate as\nthe J-integral path is varied in comparison to the DBEM, so that no particular strategy is required\nin order to determine the optimum J-integral contour.\nFor the above results, only one crack tip was enriched, but improved results can be gained by\nenriching the elements at both crack tips. Figure 13 shows the convergence behaviour of the mode\nI SIF results for the case h=w = 2, a=w = 2, \f = 45\u000e, comparing the unenriched dual BEM, and\nthe two cases of the enriched dual BEM, i.e. with one tip enriched and with both tips enriched. It\nis evident that the convergence rate is markedly improved when both tips are enriched. This leads\nus to suggest that this is a very promising approach for multi-site damage problems.\n16\n6 Conclusions\nThe Enriched BEM shows an improvement in accuracy over the DBEM for evaluating SIFs at\nthe cost of only a small number of additional DOF. The inclusion of enrichment terms requires\nthe implementation of singular and hypersingular enriched integrals at general collocation points;\na general procedure is given for their evaluation. By using this method, a general basis that is\nknown to model a discontinuity or singularity can be included within the BEM which will return a\nmore accurate solution. The enriched BEM, combined with the path independent J-integral, also\npresents an attractive method for obtaining accurate SIFs for general crack problems using meshes\nthat are considerably coarser that those used in polynomial based element formulations. It has been\ndemonstrated that the method is accurate for both Mode I and II fracture problems. The natural\nextension of the work will be the adaptation of the algorithms presented for the evaluation of SIFs\nfor 3D problems, which the authors believe will be enabled by using the enrichment approach of\nSukumar et al. [39].\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was undertaken under research grant EP\/E12310\/1 from the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK, whose support is gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] Watwood VB.

For 2D elastostatics,\n20\nSkij is given by\nSkij =\n\u0016\n2\u0019(1\u0000 \u0017)r2\n\u001a\n2\n@r\n@n\n[(1\u0000 2\u0017)\u000eijr;k\n+ \u0017(r;j\u000eik + r;i\u000ejk \u0000 4r;ir;jr;k]\n+ 2\u0017(nir;jr;k + njr;ir;k)\n+ (1\u0000 2\u0017)(2nkr;ir;j + nj\u000eik + ni\u000ejk)\n\u0000 (1\u0000 4\u0017)nk\u000eij\n\u001b\n(A.1)\nAll hypersingular integrals involving this term are multiplied by the shape function Na(\u0018) and the\nJacobian of transformation Jn(\u0018). We are then left with an integral of the form\nZ +1\n\u00001\nNa(\u0018)Skij \nU\nl (\u0018)J\nn(\u0018)d\u0018 (A.2)\nwhich is of O(1=r2) when the source and \feld point coincide. The method is based on expressing\nthe integrand seen in (A.2) in a Taylor series form where de\fnitions are made to simplify later\nexpressions.\nIf the components of the \feld and source point locations are expressed as xi and yi respectively\n(in keeping with the notation of [29]), then the following Taylor series expansion about the point\n\u0018p can be written\nxi \u0000 yi = dxi\nd\u0018\n\f\f\f\f\n\u0018=\u0018p\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p) + d\n2xi\nd\u00182\n\f\f\f\f\n\u0018=\u0018p\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p)2\n2\n+ \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n= Ai(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p) +Bi(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p)2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n= Ai\u000e +Bi\u000e\n2 +O(\u000e3); (A.3)\nwhich de\fnes the constants Ai and Bi along with the term \u000e := \u0018 \u0000 \u0018p. The constants A and C\nare also de\fned as\nA :=\n \n2X\nk=1\nA2k\n!1=2\n(A.4)\nC :=\n2X\nk=1\nAkBk (A.5)\n21\nHowever, to determine Ai and Bi (and therefore A and C), the \frst and second derivatives about\nthe source point must be found. This is achieved by utilising the relevant shape functions and the\nnodal coordinates in the following way\ndxi\nd\u0018\n=\ndNa\nd\u0018\nxai (A.6a)\nd2xi\nd\u00182\n=\nd2Na\nd\u00182\nxai (A.6b)\nNow the derivative r;i can then be expressed as\nr;i =\nxi \u0000 yi\nr\n=\nAi\nA\n+\n\u0012\nBi\nA\n\u0000AiAkBk\nA3\n\u0013\n\u000e +O(\u000e2)\n=: di0 + di1\u000e +O(\u000e\n2) (A.7)\nwhile the term 1=r2 can also be rewritten as\n1\nr2\n=\n1\nA2\u000e2\n\u0000 2C\nA4\u000e\n+O(1) (A.8)\n=:\nS\u00002\n\u000e2\n+\nS\u00001\n\u000e\n+O(1) (A.9)\nIt is also useful to express the Jacobian of transformation in terms of its components Ji(\u0018) where\nJn(\u0018) =\np\nJ1(\u0018)2 + J2(\u0018)2 and\nJ1 = A2 + 2B2\u000e +O(\u000e\n2) (A.10a)\nJ2 = \u0000A1 \u0000 2B1\u000e +O(\u000e2) (A.10b)\nAs a generalisation, these are written as\nJk = Jk0 + Jk1\u000e +O(\u000e\n2) (A.11)\nFinally, we express the shape functions Na and the enrichment functions  \nU\nl as Taylor expansions\nNa(\u0018) = Na(\u0018p) +\ndNa\nd\u0018\n\f\f\f\f\n\u0018=\u0018p\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n= Na0 +Na1\u000e +O(\u000e\n2) (A.12)\n22\nand\n Ul (\u0018) =  \nU\nl (\u0018p) +\nd Ul\nd\u0018\n\f\f\f\f\n\u0018=\u0018p\n(\u0018 \u0000 \u0018p) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n=  Ul0 +  \nU\nl1\u000e +O(\u000e\n2): (A.13)\nThe integrand in (A.2) can now be expressed as a Taylor series by substituting in expressions (A.7),\n(A.8), (A.11), (A.12) and (A.13) while also noting that Ji = niJ\nn. By collecting all the terms that\ncontain 1=\u000e2 and 1=\u000e where, due to the use of quadratic shape functions, any higher order terms\nare zero, the following expression can be written for the integrand\nNa(\u0018)Skij \nU\nl (\u0018)J\nn(\u0018) = D\n\u001a\nS\u00002(\u0018p)Na0h(\u0018p) Ul0\n\u000e2\n+\nh\nS\u00002(\u0018p)\n\u0002\nNa0h(\u0018p) \nU\nl1\n+  Ul0 (Na1h(\u0018p) + g(\u0018p)Na0)\n\u0003\n+ S\u00001Na0h(\u0018p) Ul0\ni\n=\u000e\n\u001b\n(A.14)\nwhere the constant D is de\fned as \u0016=2\u0019(1\u0000 \u0017), and the terms h(\u0018p) and g(\u0018p) are given by\nh(\u0018p) = 2\u0017(Ji0dj0dk0 + Jj0di0dk0)\n+ (1\u0000 2\u0017)(2Jk0di0dj0 + Jj0\u000eik + Ji0\u000ejk)\n\u0000 (1\u0000 4\u0017)Jk0\u000eij (A.15)\ng(\u0018p) = 2(dl1Jl0 + dl0Jl1)\n\u0002\n(1\u0000 2\u0017)dk0\u000eij\n+ \u0017(dj0\u000eik + di0\u000ejk)\u0000 4di0dj0dk0\n\u0003\n+ 2\u0017\n\u0002\nJi0(dj1dk0 + dj0dk1) + Ji1dj0dk0\n+ Jj0(di1dk0 + di0dk1) + Jj1di0dk0\n\u0003\n+ (1\u0000 2\u0017)\u00022(Jk1di0dj0 + Jk0(di1dj0\n+ di0dj1)) + Jj1\u000eik + Ji1\u000ejk\n\u0003\n\u0000 (1\u0000 4\u0017)Jk1\u000eij (A.16)\nwhere the summation rule is applied to the \frst two terms in expression (A.16).\n23\nBIOGRAPHIES\nRobert Simpson has recently completed his postgraduate studies in the School of Engineering\n& Computing Sciences at Durham University UK.
