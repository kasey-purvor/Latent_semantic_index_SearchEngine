While the effect is small at tree level, we speculate it will be significantly\nenhanced by loop effects.\nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the main tasks for the experimental and theo-\nretical programme in connection with the CERN LHC is\nto determine whether the breaking of the electro-weak\nsymmetry is due to the Higgs boson of the Standard\nModel. While the production of a Standard Model Higgs\nboson at the LHC is dominated by the process gg \u2192 H ,\ngluon fusion mediated through a top quark loop, the ex-\nact dynamics of the symmetry breaking can be more di-\nrectly extracted by studying the production of the Higgs\nin addition to two jets. This process receives contri-\nbutions from channels of both electro-weak[1, 2, 3] and\nQCD origin[4, 5]. Calculations of the O(\u03b1s) corrections\nto the electro-weak channel indicate that the higher order\neffects are very small, and since the QCD channel can be\nefficiently suppressed, it would seem that the Higgs cou-\npling to electro-weak bosons can be cleanly studied.\nThe purpose of this letter is to explore mechanisms\nwhich could reduce the purity of the extraction of this\nHV V coupling from the Hjj process. We will further\nhighlight the generality of one such observed mechanism.\nHIGGS + 2 JETS IN THE STANDARD MODEL\nWe will consider the production of a Standard Model\nHiggs with a mass between 115 GeV and 200 GeV, in\nwhich case the gluon-gluon-Higgs fusion through a top\nloop can be described accurately by an effective vertex\nof the form[6, 7]\nV (p\u00b5a , k\n\u03bd\nb ) = \u2212i\n\u03b1s\n3piv\n\u03b4ab (g\u00b5\u03bd p \u00b7 k \u2212 p\u03bdk\u00b5), (1)\nwhere v is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs\nfield, and a, b denote the colour index of the gluons.\nWithin this approximation, a possible tree level process\nfor Hjj production is shown in Fig. 1(b). This process is\nconsidered a pollutant in the study of the dynamics of the\nelectro-weak symmetry breaking through the coupling\nVWWH(p\n\u00b5, k\u03bd) = VZZH(p\n\u00b5, k\u03bd) cos2 \u03b8W = gWMWg\n\u00b5\u03bd , (2)\nW,Z\nW,Z\nH H\n(a) (b)\nFIG. 1: Hjj production at tree level by weak boson fusion\nand gluon fusion (where the effective vertex from Eq. (1) is\nused).\nwhich contributes to Hjj\u2013production at tree level\nthrough the diagram in Fig. 1(a). Higher order correc-\ntions from QCD are considered separately[8] for the two\nprocesses, and have been calculated for the gluon fusion\nprocess to order \u03b15\ns\n[9, 10, 11, 12, 13] in the limit of\ninfinite top mass, and to order \u03b13\nW\n\u03b1s for weak boson fu-\nsion (WBF)[14]. Since higher order corrections to WBF\nare found to be small (on the order of 3% \u2212 10% in the\nrelevant kinematic region [15, 16]) and the gluon fusion\nchannel can be suppressed to the same level, it even be-\ncomes feasible to study possible anomalous couplings of\nthe Higgs field to the weak bosons of the form [17]\nV A\nWWH\n(p\u00b5, k\u03bd) = gWMW\n(\na1(p, k)g\n\u00b5\u03bd\n+ a2(p, k)[g\n\u00b5\u03bd p \u00b7 k \u2212 p\u03bdk\u00b5] + a3(p, k)\u03b5\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3q1\u03c1q2\u03c3\n)\n,\n(3)\nwhere a1 = 1, a2 = a3 = 0 corresponds to the Standard\nModel, and any deviation from this is anomalous.\nThe high purity of the Hjj sample in terms of WBF is\nobtained by imposing the following cuts, which are used\nin our numerical studies\nRjj > 0.6 \u03b7j1 \u00b7 \u03b7j2 < 0 |\u03b7j1 \u2212 \u03b7j2 | > 4.2\npT ,j > 20 GeV |\u03b7j | \u2264 5 sjj > (600 GeV)2 .\n(4)\nIn this setting it is worth considering all standard\nmodel contributions which could mimic an anomalous\ncoupling and destroy the pure extraction of the VVH\nvertex.\nOne such contribution, which has been ignored in\nthe literature, is the interference between the QCD and\n2electro-weak generated Higgs production. Usually (e.g. in\nthe effective structure function approach), all contribu-\ntions requiring a t\u2194 u-channel crossing at tree level are\nneglected, since such effects only contribute to channels\nof identical quarks, and furthermore suffer a kinemati-\ncal suppression arising from the crossing. For the ZZH\nfusion process, the channels with identical quarks con-\ntribute a third of the cross section, but the crossed term\nsuffers the suppression of a further 4 orders of magni-\ntude due to the kinematical effects in the crossing. It is\ntherefore valid to ignore such contributions. Within this\napproximation, there is also no interference between di-\nagrams of colour singlet and colour octet exchange, and\ntherefore even the tree-level effects discussed in this letter\nare ignored.\nHowever, by calculating explicitly the interference be-\ntween the QCD and electro-weak generated Higgs pro-\nduction, we find that the (\u03b1W\n\u221a\n\u03b1W\u03b1\n2\ns\n)\u2013contribution from\nthis crossed term is 15 times larger than the neglected\ncontribution from ZZxZZ\u2013interference, even though it\nsuffers the same suppression effects from the requirement\nof a t\u2194 u\u2013crossing and identical quarks.\nWhile this may seem like a small effect, it is about\n1% of the quark initiated pure gluon fusion channel, and\nabout 5%-10% of the NLO QCD corrections to the quark\ninitiated Z fusion channel reported in Ref.[15, 16]. The\nkinematical dependence of the interference term is obvi-\nously different from either of the pure electro-weak and\nthe pure QCD terms, and so the applied cuts do not sup-\npress this term to the same extent as the pure QCD one.\nIn fact, the relative impact of the tree level interference is\nincreased by raising the cut on the transverse momentum\nof the jets.\nMore importantly, the Lorentz structure of the effec-\ntive ggH\u2013coupling could be mistaken for an anomalous\ncontribution to the ZZH\u2013coupling, since such contribu-\ntions are not present in the available NLO calculations\nof this process.\nMost importantly though, higher order QCD correc-\ntions, which take into account the exchange of a gluon\nbetween the quark lines as depicted in Fig. 2, will remove\nthe requirement of a t \u2194 u-crossing in the interference\nbetween the QCD and electro-weak processes, and per-\nmit interference effects in all channels. The indicated\none-loop process is the leading order mechanism for pro-\ncesses not suppressed by crossing, and for all processes\ninvolving non-identical quarks, and quarks of different\nhelicity configurations. The one-loop process is therefore\nnot a higher order correction to the tree-level process re-\nported above, and the size of the one-loop interference\nterm is not indicated by the size of the calculated tree-\nlevel interference term. Rather, the size of the contribu-\ntion from one-loop interference should be comparable to\nthe size of the one-loop (in this case NLO) corrections\nto the weak boson fusion and gluon fusion processes re-\nported in Ref.[9, 15, 16].

The interfer-\nence term has a different kinematic dependence to other\ncontributions previously investigated and is small (but\nstill an order of magnitude larger than the ZZ inter-\nference term) only due to the tree level requirement of\nt \u2194 u-channel crossing, which will be lifted at higher\norders and could lead to a very significant interference\neffect. We speculate that the one-loop corrections of or-\nder \u03b13\ns\n\u03b1W\n\u221a\n\u03b1W could be as important as the one-loop\ncorrections of order \u03b1s\u03b1\n3\nW\nand \u03b15\ns\nalready calculated in\nthe literature.\nIt should be noted that the ideas of interference effects\nbetween electro-weak and QCD generated processes dis-\ncussed in this letter obviously are not confined to Higgs\nmasses in the studied range, nor indeed Higgs production\nitself. Similar effects were reported in Ref.[18].\nWe would like to acknowledge discussions with Alexan-\nder Sherstnev on the efficient use of CompHEP[19, 20].\n3\u2217 Electronic address: andersen@hep.phy.cam.ac.uk\n\u2020 Electronic address: smillie@hep.phy.cam.ac.uk\n[1] R.
