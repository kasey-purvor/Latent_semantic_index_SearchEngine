This is doubling, \nbut with a difference; the map shifts the point of view so that viewers can see the \nwhole as if from the outside, in a way that allows them, from a specific position \ninside, to find their bearings (Buck-Morss 1995: 440).  \n \n1: Introduction  \n \nIt is no longer controversial to assert that the \u2018mainstream\u2019 of economic-geographical \ntheorising, including that which defines itself as \u2018international\u2019, emerges from the \nexperiences of Anglo-American regions and is articulated largely in the pages of \u2018major \ninternational journals\u2019, published overwhelmingly in English in the UK and USA (see Foster et \nal. 2007, Murphy 2008, Rodriguez-Pose 2006, Yeung and Lin 2003). However, what is \nremarkable is that so much economic geography continues to presume that \u2018the economy\u2019 \ncan and should be theorised solely from the perspective of the formal spaces of western \neconomies.  \nThis brief intervention seeks to build on work which identifies and measures the \nAnglo-centrism of economic geography (Rodriguez-Pose 2006) and explores the limits of \nsuch economic-geographical research (see, for example, Pollard and Samers 2007) in an \nattempt to foster what we regard as a long-overdue dialogue between economic \ngeographers and scholars working with postcolonial approaches, broadly defined. It arises \nfrom our ongoing conversations, reflecting the differing theoretical perspectives and \ngeographical contexts of our research, and from a two year ESRC-funded seminar series1, \n                                                 \n1\n Award no: RES-451-26-0123. \n 2 \nwhich sought to explore the potential for, and challenges of, a postcolonial economic \ngeography.  \n \n2: Boundary Crossings \nOne of the attractions of postcolonial approaches is the determined attempt to work across \nboundaries and make critical connections between apparently disparate events and \nexperiences. As a group of geographers interested, in different ways,2 in \u2018the economy\u2019, we \nare all drawn to boundary crossing for a number of reasons. First, we have long been \nfrustrated by intellectual and disciplinary practices that separate those of us researching \neconomic issues in \u2018the global South\u2019 and post-socialist contexts from those researching \nsimilar issues in \u2018western\u2019 capitalist economies. There is still some mutual apathy towards or \neven dismissiveness amongst geographers researching in different parts of the world (see \nJones 2000). This is despite the fact that concentrations of poverty in the North and wealth \nin the South pose significant challenges to the predominant tendency amongst academics \nand policy-makers to compartmentalise in spatial terms. Moreover, while studies of \ntransnational and ethical trade, neoliberalism, Islamic finance, household economies and \ncommodity chains incorporate a multitude of case studies covering the global South and \npost-socialist spaces, these tend to be understood through conceptual lenses that almost \nalways have antecedents in western theorisations. Second, while there have been important \ncontributions to \u2018re-thinking the economy\u2019 in economic geography (notably Gibson-Graham \n1996, 2006, Lee 2006, and Massey 1999, 2004), often borrowing from earlier critiques \nwithin feminist theory and development studies, the uptake of these ideas across geography \nhas been partial and uneven. Although feminist and postcolonial geographers continue to \nproduce a rich literature on economic concerns, such as social capital, neoliberalisation, \ndiverse economies, class identities, and so forth (Bondi and Laurie 2005, Gibson-Graham \n                                                 \n2\n Some of us would be seen unproblematically as \u2018economic geographers\u2019, while others have \nvariously been referred to as \u2018post-socialist\u2019 or \u2018development\u2019 geographers and\/or area specialists.  \n 3 \n2006, Larner  and Craig 2005, Larner 2005, McEwan et al. 2005, Radcliffe 2005, Staeheli et \nal. 2004, Wright 2006), this work is seldom taken up by other economic geographers in their \ntheorisations of the economy. Similarly, postcolonialism has made few inroads into the \ndiscipline of economics (though see Zein-Alabdin and Charusheela 2004). On one side, \neconomics \u2013 in its most orthodox neoclassical variants \u2013 assumes the ontological \nprecedence of modern European societies (ibid.), while on the other, significant concerns \nremain in relation to what Hall (1996) described as the \u2018disavowal\u2019 of economy in much \npostcolonial theorising.  While the economy is present in some postcolonial theory and \npolitics (for example, Spivak\u2019s (1988) ruminations on the global division of labour), explicit \ntheorisation of the economic is rare and tends to remain rooted in variants of dependency \nor world systems theory. Third, we share a growing concern with how we research ethically \nand responsibly in a global world. Although the context of globalisation demands that \ndifferent parts of the world are incorporated into economic geographies, we ask what are \nthe politics \u2013 personal and professional \u2013 of economic geographers parachuting into new \nand unfamiliar terrain armed with little understanding of the specificities of \u2018other\u2019 places \nand with only their western theoretical toolkits?  \nThese shared concerns have encouraged us to consider a broader question, namely \nwhat might postcolonial approaches do to economic geography? As we have suggested, our \nmoves to \u2018postcolonialise\u2019 economic geography rest heavily on other theoretical \nengagements. These approaches \u2013 inspired by queer theory, poststructuralism, post-\ndevelopment, post-socialism, feminism and postcolonialism \u2013 have challenged the way we \nresearch and theorise the economic. They do so by exploring the geographical construction \nand performance of \u2018the economy\u2019, and by envisioning the \u2018whole economy\u2019 and the \narticulations between \u2018the economy\u2019 and its others. While Marxism\u2019s indifference to \ndifference has been \u2018meticulously exposed by postmodern, poststructuralist, and \npostcolonial critics\u2019 (Castree 1996\/7: 45), a postcolonial perspective pushes us to go further \n 4 \nthan traditional geographies of the Left which, though often sympathetic to the needs and \nexperiences of the subaltern, tend to focus on systemic critiques of capitalism and analyses \nof the formal spaces of labour, to the detriment of vivid, complex and embodied accounts of \nlives and livelihoods. In what follows, we focus on developing a dialogue between \npostcolonialism and economic geography whilst recognising the need to maintain and \nfurther develop a dialogue about the importance of the economy in postcolonial \ngeographies. \n \n3: The geographies of economic knowledge and the making of \u2018elsewhere\u2019 \nA conversation between economic geography and postcolonialism should interrogate the \ngeographies of knowledge production about \u2018the economy\u2019. Postcolonialising economic \ngeography is a political project that works against a divisive geopolitics of knowledge. Many \neconomic geographers still unconsciously universalise the western parochial, and thus \u2018non\u2019-\nwestern economies are seen in terms of \u2018a lack, an absence, an incompleteness that \ntranslates into an \u2018inadequacy\u2019\u2019 (Chakrabarty 2000: 32) or, at best, something reduced to \n\u2018varieties of capitalism\u2019. A postcolonial economic geography offers a counter to such visions \nin a number of ways, for example by recognising the multiplicity of worlds that may or may \nnot see themselves as economic in these terms. These may include indigenous forms of \nknowledge (Howitt and Suchet-Pearson 2006) and the ordinary economies of everyday life \n(Lee 2006). \nPostcolonial economic geography makes a call to examine how and where economic \npractices and theories travel (Larner and Laurie forthcoming) and emphasises the \nimportance of exploring the \u2018domestication\u20193 (Stenning and Smith 2008; Smith and \nRochovsk\u00e1 2007) of projects, policies and target groups. The growing body of work that \n                                                 \n3\n Domestication here is used in both a national and household sense. In both settings economic \ntheories and practices are internalised, reproduced and scaled in ways that reflect dominant \nassumptions about places, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and class. \n 5 \nexplores the development industry through institutional and embodied ethnographies is a \ngood illustration of this approach, often drawing inspiration from work that sees economic \npolicies as technocratic projects (Mitchell 2002, Goldman 2005). Although there has been \nwork on, for example, how neoliberalism travels (Peck 2004), much of this has explored the \ncirculation of knowledges within advanced economies and the movement of such \nknowledges out from the west. Less work has drawn attention to the travels of economic \npolicy made elsewhere (Smith, Stenning and Willis forthcoming). Certainly not enough \nanalysis of how neoliberalism travels has acknowledged the ways in which indigenous actors \nhave responded to and remade economic policy.  In contrast, postcolonial critiques reveal \nthe ways in which parallel policy-making circuits have long operated simultaneously but \nseparately, structuring the geographies of learning along clearly defined North-South lines. \nThus, for example, the development of British workfare4 did not benefit from knowledge \nsharing about contemporaneous experiences in the global South, despite the role of \ninternational organisations like the ILO in charting and disseminating their successes (Laurie \n2007).  \nWe argue that there is a lopsided acknowledgement of, and interest in, the \nmovement of knowledge in economic geography. While economic geographers in \nAnglophone contexts sometimes explore flows of knowledge from the west, they do little to \ninterrogate the impact of such knowledges \u2019elsewhere\u2019, and thus rarely engage with the \nextensive work of development and post-socialist geographers. Moreover, despite rich \nethnographic and anthropological work documenting indigenous and alternative community \neconomies around the globe, relatively few economic geographers have examined flows \n                                                 \n4 British workfare was introduced as part of the wide-ranging welfare reforms of the 1990s \nin the UK. It made social security benefits dependent on individual\u2019s take up of government \nemployment schemes. Welfare-to-work programmes in the UK and the USA have been \nstudied by geographers as early examples of welfare policy transfer (see Peck and Theodore \n2001). \n 6 \nthat emanate from non-western and other subaltern settings, or from regions not defined \nas \u2018advanced capitalist economies\u2019. \n \n4. Doing postcolonial economic geographies  \nAn emphasis on diversities must be scrutinized to ensure that we do not miss \u2018the wood\u2019 \nbecause we see too many \u2018trees\u2019. With this in mind a sympathetic critique is offered by \nRoger Lee, who draws our attention to the singularity of economy \u2013 the need to enable \nsocial and material reproduction, that is the need for any economic geography to be \u2018life-\nsustaining\u2019 (Lee, 2006). Lee concedes, of course, that sustaining life is not simply a question \nof material success but also of the performance of other values. Therefore, rather than \nabandoning western economic models, the challenge is, as Spivak (1988: 57) argues, to \n\u2018produce a reading which is politically more useful, rather than a reading that would simply \nthrow away an extremely powerful analysis because it can be given a certain kind of \nreading\u2019.  An emphasis on subalterity within postcolonial approaches inspires analyses not \njust of the iniquities of capitalism but also of other forms of oppression such as patriarchy, \nneo-colonialism and racism (McCall 2005), which intersect to shape the identities and life \nchances of diverse groups of people.  An emphasis on the ruptures, cracks, crevices and \nhappenstance of economies does not equate with contingency and \u2018splitting\u2019. Rather, it \nserves to clarify the mechanisms and power relations in play that permit particular forms of \nrepresentation to take shape, circulate and become \u2018domesticated\u2019. There is political \nimportance to the consideration of difference in this approach; this is not about difference \nfor its own sake, but to counter \u2018the discursive erasure threatened by neoliberal theory\u2019 \n(Gibson-Graham 2008: 8).  \nOur insistence on a recognition of more complex and multi-directional flows of \neconomic knowledge and policy leads us to argue that postcolonialising economic \ngeography is not confined to an engagement with the more obviously postcolonial worlds of \n 7 \ndiasporic communities and the global South. Nor are we suggesting that it is only those who \nwork in area studies who can practice a postcolonial economic geography. Far from it. The \npostcolonial economic geography we advocate is not a geography of \u2018the South\u2019, but an \neconomic geography more conscious of its own perspectives and more open to embracing \ndifferent perspectives through which to view economic practices. It is as important to turn \nthese perspectives on the North to disruptive effect as it is to break the silences from the \nmargins (see Pollard and Samers 2007).  \n \nQuirky case studies \nSuch validation of other economies reinforces the importance of what are often seen as \n\u2018quirky case studies\u20195. Many of us who work beyond the spaces of mainstream economic \ngeography are regularly called upon to justify our focus on what are seen as marginal \npractices and spaces. Yet these practices and spaces are often illustrative of widespread and \n\u2018popular\u2019 economies of everyday importance. This marginalisation of widespread economic \npractices echoes Robinson\u2019s (2003: 278) concern with the way in which research findings in \n\u2018different contexts\u2019 are often incorporated as add-on \u2018case studies\u2019 to interpret or affirm \nwestern knowledge, whilst work in the \u2018heartlands\u2019 is seen \u2018as generative of theoretical and \ngeneral geographical knowledge\u2019. A postcolonial economic geography might, in contrast, \nseek out those case studies which contradict what would seem to be a \u2018logical economic\u2019 \noutcome, or those which \u2018queer\u2019 the interpretations of economic practices elsewhere, \nreflecting varying motivations and values.  \n \nArea studies with a difference? \nThese concerns encourage us to reconsider the place of area studies in economic \ngeography. As Robinson suggests, area studies has been \u2018one of the few serious \n                                                 \n5\n This phrase is borrowed from Wendy Larner (2006).  \n 8 \ncounterweights to the tireless tendency to marginalise huge parts of the world\u2019 (Appadurai \n1996, cited in Robinson 2003: 280). And as Rigg (2007) suggests, there is an ongoing need to \nquestion the apparent (and increasing) parochialism of Anglophone geography. This is not a \nplea for a return to the problematic, bounded areas studies in which unequal North-South \nand East-West power relations went unacknowledged. Rather, it is a concern to open \neconomic geographies to the postcolonialising possibilities of area studies.  These \npossibilities, we suggest, are threefold. First, area studies equips academics with the skills \u2013 \nincluding but not limited to language \u2013 and experience to explore the articulation of the \nlocal and the global, and to develop and analyse case studies, which rest on detailed \nengagements with the region or country of study. Second, it creates an interdisciplinary \narena for analysis. For example, any Latin American or Russian and East European studies \nconference draws in film critics, linguists, social scientists, historians and, increasingly, \nengineers and scientists to debate and explore the region\u2019s engagements with global \neconomies. Finally, research practice in area studies habitually engages with activists and \npolicy-makers able to deploy academic research within their policy and practice. The ways in \nwhich research \u2018gets done\u2019 in area studies settings often blurs the boundaries between \nusers and producers of knowledge. It also has the potential to employ a broader conception \nof where expertise resides through its emphasis on transnational team-building, dialogue \nand equitable forms of knowledge exchange.  \n \nDoing collaboration \nThese possibilities suggest a practice of collaborative research that crosses boundaries \u2013 \nbetween academic disciplines and geographical subdisciplines, between states and regions \nand between academic work and other forms of activism. This commitment to dialogue and \ncollaborative research probably comes closest to meeting the ethical concerns of \npostcolonialism (McEwan 2008), but requires a radical opening up of the research process. \n 9 \nWithout this, there is a danger of appropriating the experiences and knowledges of peoples \nin the South without radically altering the power relations that structure knowledge \nproduction: \u2018the experiences of the marginalized are used in the West, but without opening \nup the process to their knowledges, theories and explanations\u2019 (Briggs and Sharp 2004: 664). \nPostcolonial practice requires holding in tension the mutual constitution of the North and \nSouth and the importance of each for the other\u2019s theorizations, while also acknowledging \nand accepting that the South is not entirely constituted by the North (Raghuram and Madge \n2006).  \nThis also has implications for teaching economic geography. There are signs that the \nproblematic geopolitics of knowledge (Jones 2000) are being addressed in the production of \nundergraduate and postgraduate curricula as new courses seek to internationalize, drawing \non examples from North, South, East and West. There are, of course, different ways in which \nthis can be done, some of which are problematic. For example, economic geographies \nshould avoid the \u2018scholar-as-tourist\u2019 model (Mohanty 2002: 518-24), in which brief forays \ninto the South are subject to a Eurocentric gaze. Similarly, they should avoid the \u2018scholar-as-\nexplorer\u2019 model (ibid.) in which the foreign other is the object and subject of knowledge. \nInstead, internationalising in a postcolonial sense could involve adopting a comparative, \nsolidarity-based model (ibid.), premised on the idea that the local and global exist \nsimultaneously and constitute each other. This foregrounds the material, conceptual and \ntemporal links and relationships between places, and assumes a comparative focus. \nFinally, debates about postcolonial practice inevitably return us to some familiar \nand, perhaps, uncomfortable questions about the geopolitics of academic knowledge \nproduction, what \u2018counts\u2019 (in UK Research Assessment Exercise parlance) as \u2018original, \nsignificant and rigorous research\u2019, and specific institutional understandings of what \nconstitutes \u2018international\u2019 significance (Rodriguez-Pose 2006). As with longstanding debates \nabout geographers and policy-relevance (Martin 2001), what we posit as postcolonial \n 10 \npractice may sit uneasily with institutional forms of evaluation that prioritise specific kinds \nof research.  \n \n5: Concluding thoughts  \nIt is often assumed that there is a mutual antipathy between postcolonial approaches and \neconomic theory. Yet we have suggested that there is already dialogue between economic \nconcerns and postcolonial geographies, most especially in feminism and development \nstudies. This commentary has highlighted the need for another boundary-crossing, one that \ncan facilitate dialogue between economic geographers and others using postcolonial \napproaches to explore economic issues. We are advocating an agenda that enables \neconomic geography to cross boundaries in more innovative and globally equitable ways. \nWe have highlighted how current geographies of economic knowledge are limited because \nthey fail to prioritise the need to seek out and reflect on economic outcomes and quirky \ncase studies that \u2018queer\u2019 mainstream interpretations of economic practices. We have also \noutlined three ways to open up economic geographies to the postcolonialising possibilities \nof area studies.  \nOur discussion in this paper, however, is not intended as a relativising gesture, one \nthat is simply about recognising the \u2018situatedness\u2019 of western (economic) knowledges. \nNeither is it an evangelising mission to turn everyone into area specialists or development \ngeographers. While we confess to a sideways plea for humility in approaching case studies \noutside one\u2019s primary area of expertise, we are mainly concerned with supporting an on-\ngoing call for \u2018provincialising\u2019 (Chakrabarty 2000) the specificity of the putatively universal \nlanguage, categories and tools of economic geography. This we would argue is essential if \ndifferent ways of thinking, writing and talking about economic inequality are the desired \noutcome.  \n 11 \nREFERENCES \n \nBondi L and Laurie N 2005 Working the Spaces of Neoliberalism: Activism, \nProfessionalisation and Incorporation.
