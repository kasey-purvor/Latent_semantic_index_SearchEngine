INTRODUCTION\nWhen forced by a \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 (IS92a) emis-\nsions scenario, a version of the Hadley Centre general\ncirculation model (GCM) (Gordon et al. 2000)\nextended to model the global carbon cycle (including\na dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM)) predicts\nthat climate change could cause a major loss of the\nAmazon rainforest (Cox et al. 2000). Besides acting as a\npositive feedback on climate, whereby additionaltribution of 27 to a Theme Issue \u2018Climate change and the\nhe Amazon\u2019.\nr for correspondence (chg@ceh.ac.uk).\n1carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere,\nthe loss of the rainforest in itself would clearly be a\nsignificant environmental matter. Cox et al. (2004)\nsuggest that the main driver of such \u2018dieback\u2019 could,\nqualitatively, be related to GCM projections of\npersistent \u2018El Nin\u02dco-like\u2019 oceanic conditions, triggering\nmajor rainfall reductions over the Amazon Basin.\nFurther analysis by Harris et al. ( 2008) demonstrates\nthat the changes in rainfall may be more complex and\nthat the modelled GCM drying is also forced by\npredicted changes in the gradient of Atlantic sea\nsurface temperatures between the Northern and\nSouthern Hemispheres.

Quantifying climate-driven Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019evidence that, for that particular year, the north\u2013south\ngradient of Atlantic sea surface temperatures was\nanomalously high. The particular format and timing\nof the drought are consistent with modelled emerging\nsignals by HadCM3.\nIt is important to understand the uncertainties\nrelated to the Cox et al. (2000) prediction of dieback.\nThese can arise through uncertainty in both simulated\nregional climate change and the modelled land surface\nresponse. We use perturbed physics ensembles of\nHadCM3 (part of the \u2018quantifying uncertainty in\nmodel predictions\u2019 (QUMPs) initiative) to explore\nuncertainties in the predicted climate drivers affecting\nfuture Amazon rainforest stability. The ensembles\nextend the Murphy et al. (2004) work to fully transient\nsimulations of historical and future climate (using the\nSRES A1B scenario; Nakic\u00b4enovic\u00b4 & Swart 2000;\nCollins et al. 2006; Murphy et al. 2007). Two\nuncertainties in the structure of the land surface\nmodel are considered, where enhanced ecological\nrealism addresses potential weaknesses in the original\nmodelling system. First, we introduce a more advanced\nrepresentation of canopy light interception containing\nan explicit description of interception for different\ncanopy levels (Sellers 1985), giving a multilayer\napproach to scaling from leaf- to canopy-level photo-\nsynthesis. Second, we consider the contribution of the\nrepresentation of vegetation dynamics to the dieback\nresponse, by replacing the TRIFFID DGVM with the\necosystem demography (ED) model (Moorcroft et al.\n2001). ED is a size- and age-structured approximation\nof an individual-based gap model (Friend et al. 1997),\nmodified to allow the gap model vegetation dynamics\nto be employed at large spatial scales. The ED\nindividual-based model with its enhanced biophysical\nrepresentation of vegetation is a logical step on from the\nTRIFFID model; the latter has a more empirical\nrepresentation of vegetation competition and\ninteraction. As both models are driven with the same\ncanopy photosynthesis and surface exchange scheme,\nthe contribution of modelled vegetation dynamics to\ndieback is isolated from that of plant physiology.2. ANALYSIS\nGCM simulations of century-scale climate change\ntypically take three months to complete, even with\nsupercomputing facilities. They are highly sophis-\nticated numerical models of the climate, but these\ntwo aspects make it difficult to explore new numerical\ndepictions of Earth system processes, such as the land\nsurface response. Hence, a spectrum of modelling tools\nis required where complexity is retained in the\nprocesses of interest, but other components of the\nEarth system are approximated. The Integrated Model\nOf Global Effects of climatic aNomalies model\n(IMOGEN) strives to achieve this, combining the\n\u2018GCM analogue model\u2019 to emulate surface climate\n(Huntingford & Cox 2000) but with the full GCM land\nsurface model. IMOGEN is described in Huntingford\net al. (2004), where it was applied to the early analysis\nof potential Amazonian dieback.\nIn the standard IMOGEN system, CO2 emissions\nare prescribed and the model simulates terrestrialPhil. Trans. R. Soc. Bcarbon fluxes from the land surface scheme and\noceanic fluxes using the impulse response function of\nJoos et al. (1996), generating atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations. Here, we analyse ED model pro-\njections for the Amazon Basin, noting that ED was\noriginally developed with plant functional types\n(PFTs) specific to Amazonia (Moorcroft et al. 2001).\nED is not yet fully tested for temperate and boreal\nregions, preventing predictions of the global land\u2013\natmosphere net carbon exchange and hence atmos-\npheric CO2 content for prescribed emissions of CO2.\nInstead, IMOGEN is run with prescribed CO2\nconcentrations identical to those derived by the Hadley\nCentre GCM contribution to the Coupled Carbon\nCycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project\n(C4MIP; Friedlingstein et al. 2006). Although the\nability of the land surface to affect atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations through large-scale biogeochemical\nfeedbacks is lost, the vegetation change in Amazonia\nwas responsible for only 10% of the total biosphere\u2013\natmosphere positive feedback predicted by Cox et al.\n(2000, 2004).\nHuntingford & Cox (2000) demonstrate that, to a\nreasonable level of accuracy, surface climate (by both\ngeographical position and season) as depicted by\nHadCM3 transient simulations exhibits linearity in\nglobal mean temperature over land. We recalculate\nsuch propagating patterns based on each member of\nthe QUMP perturbed physics ensemble, and hence the\nIMOGEN system explores how Amazon dieback is\nsensitive to different predictions of surface climate. The\nIMOGEN system is also used to consider how altered\nrepresentations of light interception and vegetation\ndynamics influence the rainforest response to simulated\ndrying and raised temperatures.\nFor the IMOGEN simulations we perform, the\ntrajectory of climatic forcing is similar to that of the\nQUMP simulations themselves (so the GCM \u2018analogue\nmodel\u2019 component of IMOGEN could have been\noverridden with direct climatological predictions from\nthe QUMP ensemble). However, the existence of\npropagating patterns of climatological change allows\nextrapolation of existing GCM simulations to a range\nof different emission profiles. Hence, the system\npresented below is now available for future simulations\ncorresponding to a diverse range of future pathways in\natmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, including\nuncertainty bounds based on the QUMP simulations.\n(a) Perturbed physics simulations\nClimatological driving data required by IMOGEN are\ncreated based on 16 perturbed physics transient\nHadCM3 simulations. These simulations translate\nuncertainties first explored in Murphy et al. (2004)\nand extended by Webb et al. (2006) into transient\nclimate responses over the historical period and future\n(to the year 2100, using the SRES A1B scenario) by\nincorporating a dynamical ocean component. The\n16-member ensemble samples uncertainties in cloud\nand atmospheric processes, land surface and sea ice\nparametrizations. The methodology for these\nsimulations is described in Collins et al. (2006),\nalthough our analysis uses a subsequently refined set\nof 16 perturbed physics simulations with reduced\n86\n4\nra\nin\n fa\nll \n(m\nm \nd\u2013\n1 )\nso\nil \nca\nrb\non\n (k\ng \nC \nm\n\u2013\n2 )\nv\neg\net\nat\nio\nn \nca\nrb\non\n (k\ng \nC \nm\n\u2013\n2 )\n2\n0\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1015\n10\n5\n0\n310\n315\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d )\n305\nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (K\n)\n300\n295\n1850 1900 1950 2000 2050 2100\nyear\n1850 1900 1950 2000 2050 2100\nyear\nFigure 1.

The changes in both (c) vegetation and (d ) soil carbon for the Amazon region are derived from\nthe IMOGEN modelling system.\nQuantifying climate-driven Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019 C. Huntingford et al. 3biases in sea temperatures in the Atlantic and Arctic\noceans (Murphy et al. 2007). A limitation of this\napproach is that the model uncertainty is explored\nwithin a single model framework and major structural\nperturbations to the model physics are not sampled.\nHowever, a comparison between this ensemble and the\nmulti-model ensemble predictions used by the Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nFourth Assessment shows a similar spread in the\nregional surface temperature response (Meehl et al.\n2007, fig. 10.30), suggesting that the QUMP ensemble\nexplores a comparable range of uncertainty. Murphy\net al. (2007) present an extended discussion on the\nlimitations and merits of both the perturbed physics\nand multi-model ensemble approaches for quantifying\nmodelling uncertainty.\nA pre-industrial climatology is derived from the\ncontrol state from each of the perturbed physics\nsimulations, corresponding to a \u2018perpetual 1860s\nclimate\u2019. Monthly mean changes in near-surface\nclimate variables are derived for each gridbox from\nthe transient simulations, in an identical way to that\nof Huntingford & Cox (2000), thereby giving the\nanalogue model components for the ensemble of\nIMOGEN simulations. IMOGEN calculates the\nsurface fluxes of heat, vapour and carbon dioxide\nusing v. 2.2 of the Met Office Surface Exchange\nScheme (MOSES; Cox et al. 1998, 1999 for MOSES\nv. 2.1, and extension to v. 2.2, Essery et al. 2003),\ncoupled to the TRIFFID DGVM (Cox 2001), hence\ngenerating a land surface model similar to that of thePhil. Trans. R. Soc. BCox et al. (2000) GCM simulation. A caveat is that\nthe new IMOGEN simulations based on the\nperturbed physics ensembles do not include the\ninfluence of dieback on regional surface climate;\nsuch local biophysical feedbacks can be important\n(see Gash & Nobre 1997; Nepstad et al. 1999; Betts\net al. 2004). Other potential biogeochemical feed-\nbacks (which are not yet in GCMs either) such as\nchanges in emissions of dust (in the event of a\ncomplete loss of vegetation) and isoprenes are also\nneglected (Sanderson et al. 2003; Woodward et al.\n2005; Betts et al. 2008).\nProjections of change in temperature and rainfall for\nthe Amazon Basin by the perturbed physics ensemble\nof transient simulations are presented in figure 1a,b.\nCalculated influence on vegetation and soil carbon\nusing the IMOGEN modelling system is also shown in\nfigure 1c,d. Although the initial vegetation and soil\ncarbon states differ for the 16 perturbed physics\nclimatologies, the temporal dynamic is robust. The\nTRIFFID DGVM driven with all the 16 climatologies\nsimulates large-scale forest dieback across Amazonia,\npredominantly associated with drought-induced\nreductions in plant productivity. There are also major\nreductions in soil carbon (the slight reversal in some\nsimulations of soil carbon content is where dieback is\nsufficiently fast that litter input to the soil \u2018overtakes\u2019\nincreased soil respiration losses due to raised tempera-\ntures). This suggests that predicted Amazonian dieback\nis robust to multiple parameter perturbations in\nHadCM3.\n20(a) (b)\n15\nBeer's law\ntwo stream\nBeer's law\ntwo stream\n10\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nv\neg\net\nat\nio\nn \nca\nrb\non\n (k\ng C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\nso\nil \nca\nrb\non\n (k\ng C\n m\n\u2013\n2 )\n5\n0\n1850 1900 1950 2000 2050 2100\nyear\n1850 1900 1950 2000 2050 2100\nyear\nFigure 2.

Huntingford et al. Quantifying climate-driven Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019(b) Impact of a multilayer canopy light\ninterception model\nThe MOSES land surface scheme used by Cox et al.\n(2000) assumes the functioning of the plant canopy\nscales as a \u2018big-leaf \u2019 and follows Beer\u2019s law. We\nintroduce a more realistic depiction of light levels\nwithin a canopy (Jogireddy et al. 2006; Mercado et al.\n2007), calculate its effect on stomatal conductance and\nthus control on photosynthesis and evaporation, and\ndetermine the impact on modelled vegetation and soil\ncarbon for the Amazon rainforest during the twenty-\nfirst century. We include an explicit scaling-up from\nleaf-to-canopy, using a multilayer canopy radiation\ninterception algorithm based on an analytical two-\nstream model (Sellers 1985). For such a multilayer\napproach, absorption and scattering losses of incident\nradiation, for both direct and diffuse radiation, are\ncalculated at different levels in the canopy. These\ninclude contributions from the visible and near-\ninfrared wavebands, from which the absorbed photo-\nsynthetically active radiation (PAR) is derived. Using\nthe calculated absorbed PAR at each layer of the\ncanopy, leaf photosynthesis, leaf respiration and\nstomatal conductance are calculated and summed to\nprovide canopy values. The parametrization of the\nvertical profile of leaf nitrogen through the canopy has\nalso been modified to follow observations from a site in\ncentral Amazonia (Mercado et al. 2007). The observed\nvertical profile of nitrogen is less steep than that\npredicted under the original Beer\u2019s law (this implies\nhigher total canopy nitrogen when observed profiles are\nused). The improved light interception model has been\nsuccessfully tested against eddy correlation measure-\nments for a rainforest site in Manaus (Mercado et al.\n2007); there the authors found the main improvement\nof introducing the \u2018two-stream\/multilayer\u2019 description\nwas to allow a more realistic modelling of the response\nof photosynthesis to light, and the associated impact on\nthe diurnal cycle of modelled carbon and water fluxes.\nThe MOSES-modelled photosynthesis tends to saturate\nquickly for increasing solar radiation, generating a \u2018flat\u2019\nresponse in the middle of the day, whereas measure-\nments indicate photosynthetic response to varying light\nlevels for the entire diurnal period.\nThe introduced scheme simulates higher gross\nprimary production, but lower net primary productionPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B(and thus lower plant and soil carbon pools relative to\nthe original big-leaf simulation; figure 2). This is as a\nconsequence of significantly higher plant respiration\ncosts associated with the higher canopy nitrogen\ncontents. Overall, this improved treatment of radiation\nabsorption yields little alteration (when using pre-\nscribed patterns of climate change based on the\nHadCM3 simulation of Cox et al. (2000)) to the\noriginal dieback result obtained with the standard\nMOSES model (figure 2). The dominant cause of\ndieback remains to be the prescribed reduced rainfall\ncausing severe soil moisture stress, affecting both\nsimulations (figure 2) independent of the improved\ndescription of photosynthetic behaviour.\n(c) Introduction of the ED model\nCox et al. (2000) used the TRIFFID DGVM, based\non a large-scale competition between trees, shrubs\nand grasses. The dominant cover is determined by\nthe balance between ability to \u2018fix\u2019 carbon by\nphotosynthesis and loss of carbon by litterfall. The\ncombination of both modelled warming and simul-\ntaneous rainfall decreases by HadCM3 means that\ntrees are projected to become unsustainable, and the\ndominant vegetation type then becomes shrubs.\nTowards the end of the twenty-first century, these\nare superseded by first grasses and finally desert. The\nTRIFFID model is described in Cox (2001) and the\nbehaviour of the dominant vegetation class and route\nto dieback is given in Huntingford et al. (2000). We\nreplaced the TRIFFID DGVM with the ED model in\nIMOGEN. The ED model (Moorcroft et al. 2001) is\nunique among DGVMs using a size- and age-\nstructured approximation of a gap model, to allow\nboth operation at a large spatial scale and represen-\ntation of vegetation dynamics, turnover, competition\nand mortality in an ecologically realistic fashion. ED\nis controlled by parameters that are more amenable\nto ground measurements (a criticism of existing\nDGVMs is that their parametrization of vegetation\ndynamics, competition and species replacement is\noften difficult to constrain with ecological data). The\nparameters of the vegetation dynamics component\n(including specific leaf area, wood density, leaf\nlifespan, mortality rates, allocation patterns and\nPFTs) were all derived from ground measurements\n1900 1950 2000 2050 2100\n0\n5\n10\n15\nyear\nv\neg\net\nat\nio\nn \nca\nrb\non\n (k\ng m\n\u2013\n2 \nyr\n\u2013\n1 )\nFigure 3.

Huntingford et al. 5by Moorcroft et al. (2001), and with an emphasis on\nthe Amazon region. The model was verified against\nvegetation composition data, showing that ED can\nsuccessfully predict vegetation growth, composition\nand spatial distribution under contrasting conditions\nwithin the Amazon region.\nIn MOSES\u2013TRIFFID, each sub-grid cell tile\ncontains a single PFT (there are five possible PFTs;\nalso possible are ice, lake, urban and soil\/desert land\nuses). ED, in contrast, defines the sub-grid cell tiles\naccording to a model of ecosystem disturbance\n(caused by either mortality or fire). Each tile consists\nof land area which has a common \u2018age since last\ndisturbance\u2019. Each tile is populated with multiple\n\u2018cohorts\u2019 of trees, which represent groups of individ-\nuals with a common PFT and height class. Cohorts of\ndifferent PFTs may coexist vertically within each tile.\nCompetition for light between different PFTs is\nsimulated, a development which greatly enhances\nthe process representation of vegetation competition\nand dynamics compared with other existing global\nvegetation models. The age-structured model rep-\nresents heterogeneity in the light environment within\na grid cell, and therefore it simulates the dominance\nof fast-growing species with high-mortality rates in\nhigh-light environments that have recently been\ndisturbed, and their successional replacement by\nslow-growing low-mortality species through time.\nThe model can therefore estimate the regrowth of\nbiomass and leaf area after disturbance events such as\nmortality. The ED model used in this analysis uses\nfive PFTs similar to that used in Moorcroft et al.\n(2001); that is, C3 and C4 grasses, plus three types of\nbroadleaf tree: \u2018early successional\u2019; \u2018mid-successional\u2019;\nand \u2018late successional\u2019.\nThe original MOSES gas exchange and photo-\nsynthesis model was retained (Essery et al. 2003), but\nupdated to allow multiple canopy layers. The sub-grid\ncell tiling structure of the vegetated land surface was\nchanged to the age class-defined tiles used in the ED\nmodel. ED has a monthly time step and provides thePhil. Trans. R. Soc. Btiling structure plus the height, PFT and leaf area\nindex of each cohort to the MOSES gas exchange model,\nwhich in turn calculates net primary productivity\n(NPP) for each cohort. These derived hourly values\nof NPP are integrated and passed back to the ED model\nafter each modelled month to update vegetation growth\nand mortality.\nFigure 3 shows Amazon vegetation carbon simulated\nby ED and forced with IMOGEN climate patterns\nbased on the HadCM3 simulation of Cox et al. (2000).\nED was unable to simulate forest until the initial\nclimatology (representative of pre-industrial times) was\nreplaced with the one based on the Climatic Research\nUnit (CRU) climatology (New et al. 2000). It is known\nthat HadCM3 has a slight dry bias in its control climate\nfor Amazonia to which ED was responding. The ED\nmodel simulates future reductions in Amazonian\nvegetation in the twenty-first century in response to\nclimate change modelled by HadCM3. However, the\nrate of dieback is significantly slower than with\nTRIFFID, indicating possibly a greater forest resi-\nlience. Spatial changes in Amazon terrestrial carbon are\ngiven in figure 4.3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe impact of uncertainties in modelled climate\nresponse on Amazon rainforest sustainability for\nincreasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse\ngases has been investigated using a \u2018perturbed physics\nensemble\u2019. In the context of predictions by other\nmodelling centres, the HadCM3 ensemble spans the\nrange of global mean temperature responses in the AR4\nmulti-model ensemble (Collins et al. 2006), but\nsamples a smaller range of the precipitation uncertainty\nin the Amazon region. Cox et al. (2004) suggest a\nrelationship between wet season precipitation and\ntrends in the future El Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO) state. The ensemble members share to a\ngreater or lesser extent the tendency in the original\nHadCM3 response towards an enhanced El Nin\u02dco-like\nstate in the future (and hence wet season reduction of\nrainfall). However, Collins et al. (2005) conclude that\nacross different GCMs, there is a roughly equal\nlikelihood between El Nin\u02dco or La Nin\u02dca trends among\nthe multi-model ensemble. Good et al. ( 2008)\nillustrate further a linkage between shifts in the\nIntertropical Convergence zone and the dry season\nrainfall in this region. That the perturbed physics\nensemble does not capture the full range in future\nrainfall responses is an important caveat that should be\naddressed in future work. Nevertheless, the response of\nclimate drivers in the HadCM3 family of models\nremains credible for the Amazon region and the\nrobustness of the dieback result to the uncertainty in\nclimate drivers for that GCM represents a substantial\nstep forward in predictions. IMOGEN, now calibrated\nagainst the QUMP ensemble, is available to assess the\nlikelihood of dieback for a range of emissions\ntrajectories. These could include pathways to atmos-\npheric stabilization (e.g. those of Wigley et al. 1996) or\nthe emerging concept of climate \u2018overshoot\u2019 (e.g.\nHuntingford & Lowe 2007), whereby a potentially\ndangerous level of climate change is found to have been\n15(a) (b)\n10\n5\n0\n\u20135\n\u201310\n\u201315\n\u201320\n\u201375\n0 10 20\nkg Cm\u20132\n30 40\n\u201360 \u201345 \u201330 \u201375\n0 10 20\nkg Cm\u20132\n30 40\n\u201360 \u201345 \u201330\nFigure 4. Spatial representation of vegetation carbon for the identical simulation with the ED model as given in figure 3.

Quantifying climate-driven Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019passed, followed by massive reductions in emissions in\nan attempt to fall back below that level. For the\nAmazon rainforest, this raises issues regarding hyster-\nesis and recovery from any dieback.\nThe sensitivity of modelled Amazon dieback to the\ndescription of the land surface model has been\nexplored. In parallel calculations (see Sitch et al.\nin press), five DGVMs are coupled to IMOGEN\n(again with patterns of climate change based on\nHadCM3) and forced with four different SRES CO2\nemission scenarios. The quantitative response of the\nDGVMs to drought differs among models, with\nTRIFFID and Hyland DGVMs most sensitive to\nreduced rainfall and elevated temperatures across\nAmazonia, whereas LPJ and Orchidee simulate mod-\nerate forest dieback. Salazar et al. (2007) run the\nCPTEC-PVM (Oyama & Nobre 2004) potential\nvegetation model with future climatologies from 15\nclimate models and for two different SRES emission\nscenarios (A2 and B1). Their results project a reduction\nin forest coverage for all simulations despite large\nuncertainties in both magnitude and sign of climate\nmodel projections of future rainfall across Amazonia.\nSalazar et al. (2007) highlight that for GCMs predicting\nhigher future rainfall amounts across the Amazon\nBasin, elevated temperatures alone are sufficient to\ncause conversion of forest to savannah ecosystems.\nHence, Amazon rainforest dieback may be less sensitive\nto the choice of GCM pattern of changing rainfall than\nhitherto expected. We have targeted two particular\naspects of Amazon\u2019s response: first, the introduction of\na multilayer two-stream canopy light module, thus\nimproving the light response of photosynthesis and\ndiurnal cycles of carbon and water fluxes, and, second,\nthe adoption of ED, a DGVM that represents a first\nstep towards incorporating a greater process-based\nunderstanding of vegetation dynamics, turnover,\ncompetition and mortality. In all circumstances, we\nfind that dieback is still probable by the end of the\ntwenty-first century for the business-as-usual emission\nprofile selected.\nDeforestation has a large impact on tropical forests\n(Achard et al. 2002). The effects of both deforestationPhil. Trans. R. Soc. Band global warming are predicted to negatively impact\nAmazonian forest extent (Cramer et al. 2004; Salazar\net al. 2007) and change both regional and global\nclimate (Sitch et al. 2005; Costa et al. 2007). To further\nimprove our ability to project the fate of Amazonian\nforests, ecosystem models need to incorporate land use\nand cover changes.\nAmazonian ecosystem models need further verifica-\ntion against carbon and water flux data. The majority of\nflux tower and experimental studies in the region do\nnot detect any hydraulic limitation of evapotranspira-\ntion or gross primary productivity in the dry season,\nwith many attributing this behaviour to the existence of\ndeep roots (Hodnett et al. 1995; Grace et al. 1996;\nArau\u00b4jo et al. 2002; Carswell et al. 2002; Saleska et al.\n2003; da Rocha et al. 2004; Goulden et al. 2004; Fisher\net al. 2007; Nepstad et al. 2007). Two examples where\nhydraulic limitation was measured are Malhi et al.\n(1998; which was tested against the IMOGEN surface\nmodel by Harris et al. (2004)) and a more recent\nmanipulation study (Fisher et al. 2007) finding that\nwhen a 50% reduction in through-fall was imposed on\nthe forest, a large (up to 80%) reduction in forest\ntranspiration (by implication, photosynthesis) resulted\nwithin a single year. These results suggest that the deep\nroots do not entirely buffer the forest from the imposed\ndry conditions and comparison of model predictions\nagainst all these observations remains a high research\npriority. It is probable that alterations of modelling\nrooting depths and the responses of vegetation to high\ntemperatures (Salazar et al. 2007) are necessary to\ncorrectly simulate contemporary and future patterns of\ngas exchange. If the total rainfall falls below a threshold\ndefined by the total evaporative demand, the effect of\nrainfall storage in the dry season becomes unimportant,\nso the impact of deep roots will probably delay the\nimpact of any drying and dieback, but not be able to\nprevent it entirely if this threshold is breached.\nWe have shown that the dieback result of Cox et al.\n(2000) is robust within the structural constraints of\nHadCM3 climatology across the existing atmosphere\nparameter uncertainty. Large-scale forest dieback\nacross Amazonia is a robust projection with enhanced\nQuantifying climate-driven Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019 C. Huntingford et al. 7representations of canopy light interception and with a\nmore process-based DGVM, ED. The ED model was\nparametrized independently of any GCM, hence\neliminating the risk of compensating biases between\nthe climate and land surface models. These results,\ntaken together with findings from other recent studies\nusing multiple DGVMs, climate models and pro-\njections of land use and cover change, suggest that\nthe Amazon rainforest must be considered to be highly\nvulnerable to future global change induced by raised\nconcentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases.REFERENCES\nAchard, F., Eva, H.
