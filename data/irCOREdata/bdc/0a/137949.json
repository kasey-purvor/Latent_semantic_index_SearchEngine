The digested sludge was produced in laboratory scale reactors under \ndifferent feed regimes based on a mixture of primary and waste activated sludge.  Laser \ndiffraction proved capable of providing rapid, reproducible results of the particle size \ndistribution of each sample, and highlighted differences between the different treatments.  \nAn increase in the level of waste activated sludge in the digester feed sludge led to a shift \nin the size distribution, with a decrease in the number of smaller sized particles.  \n \nKey words\u23af particle size analysis; anaerobic digestion; sludge; laser diffraction \n \n \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \n \n Anaerobic digestion is widely used in the UK as a method of sludge stabilisation, \nwith >50% of all wastewater sludge produced treated in this way (Davis, 1996).  Changes \nthat occur during the digestion process influence the fundamental characteristics of the \nsludge, e. g. the particle size (Lawler et al., 1986) and solids organic content (Parkin and \nOwen, 1986), which in turn influences properties such as the sludge dewaterability (Karr \nand Keinath, 1978; Lawler et al., 1986; Olb\u001fter and Vogelpohl, 1993).  \n Particle size analysis has a long history (Heywood, 1970) but it was the \ndevelopment of electronic counting instruments, initially the Coulter Counter in the late \n1940\u2019s, that enabled the rapid sizing of individual particles (Lines, 1992).  Technology \nhas since advanced with methods such as laser diffraction (e.g. Olb\u001fter and Vogelpohl, \n1993) and ultrasound (Riebel, 1992) being applied.  The application of electronic \nmeasuring devices to the particle size analysis of digested sludge has been limited to date, \nand focused mainly on the use of the Coulter Counter or similar instrument (Faisst, 1980; \nLawler et al., 1986). \n Faisst (1980) used the Coulter Counter with 6 variations of aperture and \ninstrument settings to obtain the particle size distribution of 2 digested sludges over the \nrange of approximately 1-60 \u03bcm; the majority of the particles present having diameters of \n<5 \u03bcm.  Similarly, Lawler et al. (1986) used an electrozone type instrument to measure \nthe particle size distribution of a number of laboratory derived digested sludges.  The size \nrange in this case was approximately 0.66-125 \u03bcm, with distribution peaks between 40-\n50 \u03bcm depending on the digester feed sludge.  \n 3\nIn order to measure the particle size using electrozone sensing, the sample must \nbe dissolved in an electrolytic solution.  This may affect the size of the sludge particles \nwithin the sample, as flocculation has been shown to be dependent on the interaction of \nmultivalent cations with the microbial extracellular polymer network (Urbain et al., \n1993).  This problem is overcome if laser diffraction is used for particle size \nmeasurement, as the sample can be diluted in a solvent such as tap water.  Laser \ndiffraction is finding increasing popularity as a method of particle size analysis for \nwastewater samples (Friedrich et al., 1993; Olb\u001fter and Vogelpohl, 1993; Neis and \nTiehm, 1997; Biggs and Lant, 2000) but its application to digested sludge has been \nlimited to date (Feitz et al., 2000). \n The aim of this paper was to assess the feasibility of using laser diffraction in the \nform of the Malvern Mastersizer 2000\u00ae (Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern, UK) to \nmeasure the particle size distribution of digested sludge.  Six digested sludge samples \nwere prepared, under controlled laboratory conditions, using different combinations of \nprimary and waste activated sludge as the digester feed.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \nSix laboratory scale anaerobic digesters were constructed from 5 l Quickfit\u00ae \nfermentation vessels as detailed previously (Houghton et al., 2000).  Settled primary and \nwaste activated (WAS) feed sludge was collected from Cambridge municipal wastewater \ntreatment works (Anglian Water plc.).  After collection, the feed sludge was divided into \n0.5 and 1 l aliquots, blended (Phillips Type: HR2845\/AM) for 1 min, and then frozen at   \n 4\n-20 oC until required.  Before use, the sludge was defrosted for 24 h at room temperature, \ncombined to produce the required feed composition (100% primary (100%); 80% \nprimary:20% WAS by volume (80%:20%); 60% primary:40% WAS by volume \n(60%:40%)), and warmed to ~35oC in a waterbath before addition to the digesters.  Seed \nsludge for the digesters was obtained from Milton Keynes municipal wastewater \ntreatment works (Anglian Water plc.).   \n The digesters were run at 35oC and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 d, with \nsludge being wasted\/fed once per day.  Digester performance was monitored on a daily \n(pH; temperature) and weekly (total solids (TS); volatile solids (VS); gas production) \nbasis.  All analysis was carried out as detailed in standard methods (APHA, 1992).  The \ndigesters were operated for 4 full HRT before a sludge sample was removed from each \ndigester for particle size analysis. \n Particle size analysis was carried out using the Malvern Mastersizer 2000\u00ae, \n(stirrer speed = 350; pump speed = 500; ultrasonic = off) at Malvern Instruments Ltd., \nMalvern, U.K..  For analysis, each sample was diluted approximately 500-fold in tap \nwater from Cranfield, before being analysed 10 times.  These results were then averaged \nto produce the particle size distribution.  The results were recorded as the particle volume \npercent in 70 discrete size ranges between 0.45 and 2000 \u03bcm.   \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n Sludge characteristics for both the feed and seed sludge are shown in Table 1.  \nEach of the laboratory scale digesters operated satisfactorily throughout the 80 d \n 5\noperation period, with high levels of volatile solids reduction (VSR) (Table 2).  Each of \nthe different treatments operated in a similar manner, with differences between each of \nthe matched pairs.  At all times the pH remained > pH 7.0 in each digester and the mean \ntemperature ranged from 34.9\u201335.1oC, indicative of normal mesophilic operation (Parkin \nand Owen, 1986)  .  As the concentration of WAS in the digester feed increased, there \nwas a reduction in the TS, VS and VSR of the respective digesters (Table 2). \n The particle size distribution of each digester sludge is illustrated in Figure 1, \nwhich shows the percentage of particles, by volume, between 0.45\u20132000 \u03bcm.  No \nparticles < 0.45 \u03bcm were detected in any of the samples.  A different size distribution was \nobtained for each of the treatment types, with good reproducibility between the matched \npairs.   \nThe digesters that were fed on 100% primary sludge showed one main peak in the \nsize range 22\u201332 \u03bcm.  As the level of WAS in the digester feed increased, there was a \nshift in the particle size distribution towards larger particles with the peak at 22-32 \u03bcm \nbecoming less pronounced, as a new peak developed at 110-140 \u03bcm.  This is likely to be \ndue to the differences in biodegradability of the different types of feed sludge and the \nmethod of storage.  All of the primary and WAS was stored at -18oC prior to use.  As \nreported previously by Knocke and Trahern, (1989) indirect freezing changes the \nstructure of the sludge particles, causing the formation of large, dense particles.  This was \nmost noticeable in the WAS samples. Larger particles, more resistant to degradation are \ntherefore likely to be the cause of the shift in the particle size distribution as the level of \nWAS in the digester feed increased.   Comparison of particle size data obtained by \ndifferent methods is difficult, as the mean particle diameter is derived in different ways.  \n 6\nUsing electrozone sensing, Lawler et al. (1986) reported a distribution peak for digested \nsludge of approximately 40-50 \u03bcm, depending on the digester feed sludge.  This is in-\nbetween the 2 distribution peak values obtained here.   \nThe d(0.1), d(0.5) and d(0.9) values indicate that 10%, 50% and 90% of the \nparticles measured were less than or equal to the size stated.  Where 100% primary \nsludge was used as the digester feed, the digested sludge had the lowest d(0.1) and d(0.5) \nvalues and the highest d(0.9) value, reflecting the one single main peak in the 22-32 \u03bcm \nsize range (Table 3).  Increasing the proportion of WAS in the digester feed sludge \ncaused an increase in the d(0.1) and d(0.5), whilst the d(0.9) tended to decrease.  Ten \nconsecutive measurements were made of each sample, and the results averaged to \nproduce the overall size distribution.  Throughout the ten measurements the d(0.1), d(0.5) \nand d(0.9) remained stable, indicating that the shear exerted by the instrument during the \nmeasurement process was not causing floc breakage. \nThe sludge specific surface area was derived from the particle size distribution.  \nWhilst not a wholly accurate value in that the assumption is made that all of the particles \nmeasured are spherical in diameter, the specific surface area data quoted in Table 3 \nclearly illustrates that the smaller particles contributed more in terms of specific surface \narea than the larger size fractions.  The values obtained for the specific surface area of the \nsludge are less than those recorded by Lawler et al. (1986), and this is again likely to be \ndue to the different method of measurement. \n \n 7\nCONCLUSION \n \n The results presented above indicate that laser diffraction using the Malvern \nMastersizer 2000\u00ae is capable of providing rapid, reproducible results of the particle size \ndistribution of digested sludge, with no adverse shear effect on the floc structure.  Particle \nsize analysis clearly illustrated the differences between the different feed regimes used \nfor the laboratory digesters.  An increase in the level of waste activated sludge in the \ndigester feed sludge led to a shift in the size distribution, with a decrease in the number of \nsmaller sized particles.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nJIH is funded by a UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) \nGrant GR\/L 87255 and supported by Anglian Water plc.
