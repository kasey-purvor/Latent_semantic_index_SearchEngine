The findings are 23 \nexamined with respect to temperate regions through a comprehensive analysis of over 24 \n5000 samples of surface soil from England and Wales taken from a 5 x 5 km grid.  Over 25 \n30 soil and environmental attributes are considered for each sample as proxies for soil 26 \nforming factors.  Measurements of low field magnetic susceptibility (mass specific) and 27 \nfrequency-dependent susceptibility (mass specific and percentage) on each sample 28 \nprovide estimates of the concentration and grain size of ferrimagnetic minerals.   29 \n 30 \nMaps of soil magnetism across England and Wales show non-random distributions and 31 \nclusters.  One sub-set of data is clearly linked to contamination from atmospheric 32 \npollution, and excluded from subsequent analyses. The concentration of ferrimagnetic 33 \nminerals in the non-polluted set is broadly proportional to the concentration of minerals 34 \nfalling into the viscous superparamagnetic domain size range (~ 15 - 25 nm). This set 35 \nshows clusters of high magnetic concentrations particularly over specific parent 36 \nmaterials such as schists and slates, mudstones and limestones.  37 \n 38 \nBivariate analyses and linear multiple regression models show that the main controlling 39 \nfactors are parent material and drainage, the latter represented by soil drainage classes 40 \nand particle-size.  Together these two factors account for ~ 30 % of the magnetic 41 \nvariability in the complete dataset.  A second group of factors, including climate (mean 42 \nannual rainfall), relief (slope and altitude), and organisms (land use, organic carbon and 43 \npH) have subordinate control.  Climate as represented by mean annual temperature and 44 \npedogenic time is deemed not relevant at these spatio-temporal scales. 45 \n 46 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 3\nThe findings are consistent with a largely abiotic system where the role of iron-reducing 47 \nbacteria appears minor.

Introduction and aims 61 \nMagnetic properties of soils are commonly used in earth and environmental sciences in 62 \ndiverse ways (Thompson et al., 1980; Thompson and Oldfield, 1986): as \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of 63 \nsediment sources in fluvial, limnic and marine sediments (eg. Thompson et al., 1975; 64 \nWalling et al., 1979; Dearing et al., 1985; Bloemendal et al., 1988; Dearing, 1999, 2000); 65 \nas records of atmospheric pollution (Oldfield et al., 1978; Hay et al .,1997) as tools for 66 \narchaeological mapping and prospecting (eg. Tite and Mullins 1970; Dalan and Banerjee 67 \n1996); as a climate proxy in loess-palaeosol sequences (eg. Heller and Liu 1986; Liu et 68 \nal., 1995; Maher and Thompson, 1995); as proxies for planetary atmospheric conditions 69 \n(Retallack et al., 2003; Barr\u00f3n and Torrent, 2002); and as an aid to detecting land mines 70 \nusing electromagnetic techniques (Hannam and Dearing, 2008).  Despite the 71 \nwidespread use and application the mechanisms of magnetic mineral formation in soils 72 \nremain ambiguous.   73 \n 74 \nThe most debated concept is \u2018magnetic enhancement\u2019 whereby topsoils in temperate, 75 \nMediterranean, steppe, sub-tropical and tropical zones may show higher values of 76 \nmagnetic susceptibility than subsoils: a feature first observed in temperate soils more 77 \nthan 50 years ago (Le Borgne, 1955).  Since then several theories have sought to 78 \nexplain the chemistry, physics and formation of the minerals that commonly produce the 79 \nenhanced magnetic effect.  Le Borgne (1955), and later Mullins (1977), suggested the 80 \ndominant process was \u2018fermentation\u2019 whereby wetting and drying cycles within the soil 81 \nprofile would allow the bioreduction of Fe in anaerobic conditions, followed by the 82 \nprecipitation of magnetite (Fe3O4) or maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3). Early attempts to simulate the 83 \nprocess in the laboratory (Maher and Taylor, 1988) showed that fine-grained magnetite 84 \ncould be produced in the absence of Fe-reducers, suggesting that magnetic 85 \nenhancement in soils involves the competitive abiotic interplay of mineral formation 86 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5\n(Maher, 1998). Le Borgne (1960) also observed magnetic enhancement by fire and 87 \ndeduced that thermal transformation of weakly magnetic Fe minerals to ferrimagnetic 88 \nmagnetite\/maghemite took place as the soil atmosphere shifted from aerobic to 89 \nanaerobic as the fire developed, and back to aerobic as the soil cooled. Subsequent field 90 \nstudies found evidence for the pedogenic production of bacterial magnetosomes 91 \n(Fassbinder et al., 1990) and the ferrimagnetic iron sulphide, greigite (Stanjek et al., 92 \n1994) in certain poorly drained soils.  93 \n 94 \nDearing et al. (1996a) tested several theories of secondary ferrimagnetic mineral (SFM) 95 \nformation in temperate soils by creating and analysing maps of low field magnetic 96 \nsusceptibility and frequency-dependent susceptibility of soils across England. This study 97 \nwas based on measurements of the UK National Soil Resource Institute\u2019s (NSRI) 98 \nNational Soil Inventory (NSI) sub-sampled at 10 km grid intersections.  The maps 99 \nshowed that the majority of soils had magnetic properties dominated by the presence of 100 \nnanoscale superparamagnetic (SP) and stable single domain (SSD) grains produced in 101 \nsitu, collectively termed SFMs.  Primary ferrimagnetic minerals (PFM) derived from 102 \ngeological sources, the effects of fire, and accumulation of atmospheric pollution 103 \nparticles (Oldfield et al., 1978; Hay et al., 1997) from fossil-fuel burning were found to 104 \ndominate surface magnetic properties in only a minority of localities.   105 \n 106 \nFrom this analysis, a conceptual model of SFM formation in temperate regions was 107 \nconstructed that describes the interactions between different environmental factors and 108 \nbiogeochemical processes responsible for the magnetic patterns observable at different 109 \nspatial and temporal scales (Figure 1).  As with other soil properties, controls on soil 110 \nmagnetic variations may be viewed in terms of environmental factors or boundary 111 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6\nconditions that constrain the dynamic processes of mineral formation and accumulation.  112 \nThe model suggested that at the spatio-temporal scale represented by regional 113 \nlandscapes and glacial-interglacial cycles, the first order factors are climate and soil 114 \nparent material.  Following the work and theories of Schwertmann (1988) and 115 \nSchwertmann and Taylor (1989), these conditions combine to control the flux of soluble 116 \nFe (FeII) and the production of reactive hydrous ferric oxides, such as ferrihydrite (5Fe-117 \n2O3. 9H2O) in the soil.  A second phase, the transformation of ferrihydrite into more 118 \ncrystalline minerals, may involve Dissimilatory Iron Reducing Bacteria (DIRB) in the 119 \nreduction of FeIII to FeII with the interaction of excess FeII and ferrihydrite producing SP 120 \nand SSD magnetite. Maghemite may also be formed through relatively short-term 121 \noxidation and transformation from magnetite.   At local spatial scales, vegetation, land 122 \nuse and relief set conditions for soil chemistry, structure and drainage. These may 123 \noperate positively on the formation and accumulation of SFMs, for example through 124 \nallowing fluctuating redox cycles, or impose constraints through the effects of destructive 125 \nchelating and gleying processes (see Supplementary Information for definitions of soil 126 \nterms).  127 \n 128 \nThese proposed factors and processes are largely in line with the earliest theories that 129 \nrelate to fermentation processes (Le Borgne, 1955; Mullins, 1977), and are also 130 \nsupported by subsequent empirical studies that quantify the secondary ferrimagnetic 131 \ngrain-size using low temperature magnetic measurements (eg. Dearing et al., 1997) and 132 \nconstrain the contributions of bacterial magnetosomes in highly magnetic soils on the 133 \nbasis of soil DNA analysis (Dearing et al., 2001a).  Other workers have followed the 134 \nlaboratory findings of Maher and Taylor (1988) and provided strong evidence from field 135 \nand laboratory studies to counter a dominant biomineralization scheme, especially in 136 \nMediterranean soils.   These studies support a theory of abiotic ageing of ferrihydrite to 137 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7\nhematite through the intermediate mineral hydromaghemite as a major pathway of 138 \nmagnetic enhancement (Barr\u00f3n et al., 2003; Torrent et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008).  139 \nExtrapolation of laboratory studies (Barr\u00f3n and Torrent, 2002) suggests that complete 140 \ntransformation of maghemite to hematite at room temperature takes place within 1 Ma.    141 \n 142 \nThis paper describes the first phase of analysis in a project designed to generate 143 \npredictive modelling tools for SFMs in temperate soils.  It reviews the role of broad soil 144 \nforming factors in constraining the spatial patterns of magnetic susceptibility and 145 \nfrequency-dependent susceptibility in soils across England and Wales, evaluating the 146 \nsignificance of factors in both univariate and multivariate terms. Other national\/sub 147 \nnational scale soil magnetic datasets exist in the Czech republic and\/or Austria (Fialova 148 \net al., 2006; Hanesch et al., 2001; 2007), Germany, Czech republic and Poland (Magiera 149 \net al., 2006), Estonia (Bityukova et al., 1999) but these have been used primarily to 150 \nexamine the applicability of magnetic measures for detecting signs of pollution 151 \n(Bityukova et al., 1999; Boyko et al., 2004; Magiera et al., 2006; Hanesch et al., 2007).  152 \nSeveral of the studies have addressed the contribution of geology and, in the case of 153 \nHanesch et al. (2001), the effect of different land uses is also reported via the use of 154 \nfuzzy c-means cluster analysis.  However, the multivariate nature of relationships 155 \nbetween soil forming factors and soil magnetic properties have not been systematically 156 \nanalysed within these studies.  Here, we utilize the same NSRI soil inventory set for 157 \nEngland used by Dearing et al. (1996a) but at a higher resolution of 5 km grid samples 158 \nextended to cover both England and Wales, and with a considerably extended set of soil 159 \nattributes allowing a more comprehensive analysis of the role of soil forming factors. 160 \n 161 \nAn inductive approach with no a priori assumptions about causality is adopted to explore 162 \nthe relationships between soil forming factors and the production or destruction of SFMs 163 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 8\nin topsoils in England and Wales, primarily at a spatial scale set by the 5 km grid 164 \nsampling interval over a whole area equivalent to  ~150 000 km2.   Datasets of magnetic 165 \nmeasurements and environmental attributes related to each geo-referenced sample 166 \npoint are analysed through ranking, bivariate plots, comparative analyses of sub-sets, 167 \nand where possible through multiple regression statistics. 168 \n 169 \n2. Soil forming factors and magnetism  170 \nFactors of soil formation as outlined by Jenny (1941) are used conventionally to provide 171 \na framework within which to analyse the variability of soil properties.  172 \n 173 \n S = f(Cl,O,R,P,T)  174 \n 175 \nS= Soil, Cl= Climate, O = Organisms\/Vegetation, R = Relief, P= Parent material, 176 \nT=Time 177 \n 178 \nIn theory, the Jenny equation can be used to explain the role of individual environmental 179 \nfactors on a soil attribute but in practice the factors are normally inter-dependent.  The 180 \nfollowing paragraphs review current knowledge about the role of each factor on soil 181 \nmagnetism.   182 \n 183 \n2.1 Parent material 184 \nThere are at least four aspects in which parent material operates as a factor for soil 185 \nmagnetism.  First, a supply of Fe from parent material is essential for SFM production 186 \nwhich is, at least partly, dependent upon the rate of weathering driven by hydrolysis, 187 \noxidation and reductive dissolution. In England, the Fe-rich Jurassic limestones, 188 \nCretaceous Lower Greensands and Devonian slates and were reported by Tite (1972) 189 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9\nas being the geologies likely to produce the most magnetic enhancement.  But parent 190 \nmaterials with low Fe concentrations that are able to weather at a high rate, such as 191 \nchalk, may in theory effectively produce sufficient Fe for substantial ferrimagnetic 192 \nenhancement (cf. Mourkarika, Obrien and Coey, 1991).  Second, high concentrations of 193 \nferrimagnetic minerals in surface soils may result through the accumulation of resistant 194 \nPFMs through weathering of igneous rocks (eg. Singer and Fine, 1989), and even in 195 \nsedimentary rocks (eg. chalk) where magnetic grains exists as inclusions in biogenic 196 \nquartz (Vali et al., 1989; Hounslow and Maher, 1996).  Third, resistant metamorphic and 197 \nsedimentary rocks, as in the UK, are often co-correlated with elevated topography and 198 \nas a result are also associated with lower temperatures and elevated orographic rainfall.  199 \nFourth, parent material influences many of the physical and chemical soil conditions, 200 \nsuch as texture, drainage and pH.   201 \n 202 \n2.2 Climate 203 \nMany studies have attempted to identify the climate controls on soil and palaeosol 204 \nmagnetism, spurred by the potential opportunity to reconstruct palaeoclimate in loess 205 \nsequences. The effects of rainfall have been widely reported as an important causal 206 \nfactor in the magnetic enhancement of paleosols, for example, in the Loess Plateau in 207 \nChina (Maher and Thompson, 1995), the Russian steppe (Maher et al., 2002) and the 208 \nMatmata Plateau, Tunisia (Dearing et al., 2001b). Crucially, these are areas where other 209 \nsoil forming factors are held relatively constant apart from time (Vidic et al., 2004). 210 \nPalaeosol susceptibility records from the N. Hemisphere by Maher and Thompson 211 \n(1995) demonstrated a trend of increasing susceptibility with annual rainfall from 200 mm 212 \nto a peak around 1500 mm, followed by a decline to  ~3000 mm.  A similar peak (~1000 213 \nmm) in susceptibility was observed in soils from Hawaii (Singer et al., 1996).  Increased 214 \nhumidity, resulting from greater rainfall and lower evapotranspiration, in Saskatchewan 215 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10\nwas suggested by de Jong et al. (1999) to be important in determining the highest 216 \nmagnetic susceptibility values found in Gray Luvisols and Dark Gray Chernozems. 217 \nThese observations are consistent with Dearing et al.\u2019s (1996a, 2001b) argument that 218 \nthe major role of rainfall lies in terms of driving hydrolysis reactions and the release of Fe 219 \nfrom primary minerals.  220 \n 221 \nA study of modern soil magnetic variability across four regions of China (Loess plateau, 222 \nSouth China, Qinghai-Xizang and North-west China) was able to demonstrate 223 \ninteractions between mean annual temperature (range -4 to 24\u00b0C) and mean annual 224 \nrainfall (range 10-2000 mm) in controlling modern soil magnetism (Han et al., 1996).  But 225 \ngenerally, the effects of temperature are less well studied and would seem less 226 \npronounced, although laboratory studies by Barr\u00f3n et al. (2003) suggest that 227 \ntemperature may be a key factor in magnetic enhancement driven by ferrihydrite 228 \nconversion to maghemite.  In England and Wales, there are marked gradients of rainfall 229 \nfrom west to east, largely related to both the prevailing westerly airstreams and greater 230 \naltitude in the west. Temperature variations are also related to altitude, together with 231 \nlatitude and the proximity to the coast. However relatively narrow ranges of mean daily 232 \ntemperature between 4.2 \u2013 11.5 0C and mean annual precipitation 517 \u2013 4134 mm (with 233 \n70 % of sites < 950 mm) suggest the influence of climate should be more limited. 234 \n 235 \n2.3 Relief and drainage  236 \nRelief is important with respect to magnetic enhancement because it is intimately linked 237 \nwith soil drainage and translocation of soil particles.  Magnetic studies of catena 238 \nsequences show different relationships depending on the dominant particle size of the 239 \nmain magnetic fraction.  Commonly susceptibility increases down slope on a variety of 240 \nparent materials related to increasing soil fines (eg.

Peak susceptibilities were also observed on slope crests in the English Chiltern 244 \nHills with low values on more eroded steep slopes (Dearing, 2000) suggesting that the 245 \nrates of erosion exceeded rates of magnetic enhancement.   246 \n 247 \nThe degree of drainage controls soil redox conditions, which in turn is expected to affect 248 \nbacterial activity, as well as abiotic chemical reactions affecting Fe-minerals.  249 \nFerrimagnetic minerals in soils experiencing prolonged waterlogging (gleying) appear to 250 \nundergo reductive dissolution under anaerobic conditions (Mullins, 1977; Thompson and 251 \nOldfield, 1986; Maher, 1986; Dearing et al., 1995; de Jong et al., 2000) resulting in 252 \nsubstantial decreases in magnetic concentrations in gleyed horizons.  In contrast, highly 253 \nporous soils appear to constrain SFM production because either the levels of micropores 254 \nare too low to permit fermentation processes or that Fe-minerals are removed from the 255 \nprofile either as a result of excessive Fe leaching or chelation under acidic conditions 256 \n(Maher, 1986; Dearing et al., 1985, 1995, 1996a).  257 \n 258 \n2.4 Soil organisms and vegetation  259 \nWithin the soil profile, organisms may have a variety of effects on magnetic mineral 260 \nformation. The efficiency of a fermentation mechanism is expected to depend on the 261 \npopulation and activity of DIRB. These heterotrophic bacteria require moderate 262 \ntemperature (>10 \u00b0C required for significant activity), adequate moisture, organic carbon 263 \n(acetate and other short-chain fatty acids) as electron donors, and intermediate to 264 \nalkaline pH.  These are conditions that are often best met within the rhizosphere, rather 265 \nthan the bulk soil.   Low levels of organic matter might therefore represent limiting 266 \nconditions, as perhaps illustrated by Neumeister and Peschel\u2019s  (1968) data from 267 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 12\nGermany that show a positive relationship between soil magnetic susceptibility and 268 \norganic levels in arable soils.  Therefore, land use and vegetation may play significant 269 \nroles in determining the nature of microorganism-mineral interaction through controls on 270 \nthe nature and size of the rhizosphere.  Additionally, land use and vegetation are 271 \nexpected to exert a control on chelation and acid weathering, and hence the activities of 272 \ncertain processes, such as podzolisation, that may be detrimental to magnetic mineral 273 \nformation and accumulation.  Macroorganisms, such as earthworms and moles, have 274 \npotentially a large role in controlling the distribution of minerals through continuous 275 \nbioturbation, especially the physical coupling of surface soil and the weathering zone.   276 \nLand use as a major control on vegetation and soil disturbance, especially in a heavily 277 \nmanaged region like England and Wales, may also be expected to control locally the 278 \ndistribution and intensity of fire, soil drainage, soil mixing through ploughing and soil 279 \nchemistry though application of manures and conditioners.  With regards the possible 280 \neffects of fire, Dearing et al. (1996a) found highest mean susceptibility values in ley 281 \ngrassland and arable soils, but were unable to make any link between these spatial 282 \ndistributions and crop burning despite a long history of  this land management practice.  283 \nSubstantial conversion from non-ferrimagnetic to fine grained ferrimagnetic material may 284 \noccur above 400 \u00b0C but most significantly above 550 \u00b0C (Rummery et al., 1979). 285 \nHowever, these temperatures are not always reached (Rasmussen et al., 1986) and 286 \ninsufficient organic matter and soil Fe may mean that the spatial effect is uneven (Maher, 287 \n1986).  The historical contribution of pyrogenic ferrimagnetic particles within the topsoil 288 \nmay also be complicated by bioturbation, ploughing, dissolution, and post-fire erosion 289 \n(Blake et al., 2005) making evidence of fire difficult to separate from that of natural 290 \ntopsoil magnetic enhancement.  Oldfield and Crowther (2007) report that magnetic 291 \nenhancement forced predominantly by fire can be detected using additional 292 \nmeasurements of anhysteretic magnetic susceptibility.  293 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 13\n 294 \n2.5 Time 295 \nLike all pedogenic processes, magnetic enhancement is time dependent but few studies 296 \nprovide conclusive data for rates of mineral formation.  Magnetic measurement of soil 297 \nchronosequences on river and marine terraces in the Mediterranean (Torrent et al., 298 \n1980) and California (Singer et al., 1992) have shown increasing enhancement with age. 299 \nSinger et al. (1992) reported that susceptibility had shown continued enhancement for 300 \nover 240,000 years. These changes were attributed to the greater cumulative effects of 301 \nthe weathering of parent material and release of Fe bearing minerals for potential 302 \nconversion to SFMs.  However, in China, susceptibility values of similar magnitude exist 303 \nfor modern loess soils and palaeosols, the latter often having experienced substantially 304 \nlonger duration of pedogenesis (Maher and Thompson, 1995).  While this suggests that 305 \nmagnetic susceptibility may attain \u2018saturation\u2019 status rapidly within a few hundred to a 306 \nfew thousand years (Maher and Thompson, 1995), other views emphasize the 307 \ninteractions between climate and time (eg. Vidic et al., 2004). Where SFMs form via a 308 \npathway that ultimately ends in non-ferrimagnetic minerals, like hematite (eg. Barr\u00f3n and 309 \nTorrent, 2002), there clearly must be an optimum period for the production of 310 \nferrimagnetic minerals under a given set of environmental factors.   311 \n 312 \nLaboratory experiments run under strictly anaerobic conditions have demonstrated the 313 \nproduction of ferrimagnetic minerals over short timescales (days to months) using both 314 \nFe enriched soil (Hanesch and Petersen, 1999) and bacterial growth media (eg. Hansel 315 \net al., 2003). However, the extent to which these studies are analogues for real soil 316 \nenvironments is not clear.  Attempts to simulate the rate of magnetic enhancement in 317 \nmicrocosms representing ambient soil environments have not been straightforward 318 \n(Hannam, 1999; Dearing et al., 2001a). In contrast, it is fairly easy to show the rapid rate 319 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 14\n(100-101 years) of destructive processes in the laboratory and field caused by permanent 320 \nwaterlogging (Hannam, 1999; Dearing et al., 2001a).  England and Wales have been 321 \naffected by glaciations during which pedogenesis has often been interrupted or 322 \ncompletely halted, yet some of the southern regions escaped ice coverage.  Therefore, 323 \nthere are opportunities in the present study to assume that pedogenic processes and 324 \nmagnetic enhancement were able to start from effectively \u2018time zero\u2019 in different areas 325 \nover different time periods.  326 \n 327 \n 328 \n3. Methods and Techniques 329 \n     330 \n3.1 Field sampling and sample analysis (see also Supplementary Information)   331 \nSoil samples from the NSI archive have been employed in this project. Field sampling of 332 \nsoils for the NSI was originally undertaken at sites 1000 m north and 1000 m east of 5 \u00d7 333 \n5 km grid intersections (based on the UK Ordnance Survey National Grid) across 334 \nEngland and Wales by soil surveyors between 1978 and 1982, with some later re-335 \nsampling in the mid 1990s. At each site, a total of 25 soil cores to a depth of 15 cm from 336 \nwithin a 20 \u00d7 20 m grid were amalgamated together in the field, and a single soil pit was 337 \ndug and described using standard procedures (Hodgson, 1976).  All litter, fermentation 338 \nand humus layers were excluded from the samples.  Samples were air dried, ground to 339 \npass through a 2 mm sieve and subsequently archived in plastic bags at room 340 \ntemperature.  Laboratory analyses were undertaken for soil particle size, pH, organic 341 \ncarbon and 18 chemical elements derived by aqua regia digests (4:1 hydrochloric:nitric 342 \nacids by volume), however for this publication only Fe was employed. pH was measured 343 \nwith a pH meter in a 1:2.5 dilution with de-ionized water (McGrath and Loveland, 1992). 344 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 15\nSoil particle size analysis on the <2mm fraction was achieved using the pipette method 345 \n(Avery & Bascomb, 1974)  346 \n 347 \n 348 \nA previous magnetic dataset (containing susceptibility and frequency dependence 349 \nmeasures) of 1955 samples (Dearing et al., 1996a) has been supplemented by 350 \nmeasurements on 3701 further samples to produce a complete magnetic susceptibility 351 \ndataset at a 5 \u00d7 5 km resolution across England and Wales. In both studies, volume 352 \nbased magnetic susceptibility was measured at both low and high frequencies (470 Hz 353 \nand 4700 Hz) on 10 ml samples using a Bartington Instruments dual frequency MS2B 354 \nsensor, and expressed as mass specific magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7LF  10-6 m3 kg-1), mass 355 \nspecific frequency dependent susceptibility (\u03c7FD  10-9 m3 kg-1) and percentage frequency 356 \ndependent susceptibility (\u03c7FD %). Typical ranges for broad geologies, sediments and 357 \nsoils are quoted in Thompson and Oldfield (1986) and also Walden et al. (1999). Thirty 358 \none archived samples had insufficient material to analyse. Following data entry, values 359 \nwere extensively checked for outliers reflecting possible operator error and, where 360 \nnecessary, samples were re-analysed. Samples from the earlier studies were also re-361 \nanalysed to ensure that no significant changes in magnetic measures were evident due 362 \nto the effects of prolonged storage. Comparison of previous and new measurements for 363 \n70 samples revealed r2 values for \u03c7LF   and \u03c7FD of 0.99 and a slope of 1.0004 for both, 364 \nthus confirming no significant time-related changes.  365 \nThirty repeated measurements of both volume susceptibility (\u03baLF \u00d7 10-5) and \u03c7FD  % 366 \nvalues for 10 samples that represent the range of values across the dataset serve to 367 \nillustrate (Figure 2) the relationship between the magnitude of \u03baLF  and the uncertainty of 368 \ncalculated \u03c7FD % values. The 95% confidence interval widens disproportionately as \u03baLF 369 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 16\nreduces in magnitude.  At \u03baLF = 10, \u03c7FD % values have a precision of \u00b1 2 % units 370 \n(equivalent to a relative uncertainty of \u00b115% assuming maximum \u03c7FD  % = 14). This 371 \ndegree of precision is similar to that set by Dearing et al. (1996a).  We therefore use a 372 \nthreshold value of \u03baLF = 10 to exclude samples with unacceptably low levels of precision 373 \n(n = 377; 7 % of original dataset; n = 5656).  Samples with very high \u03c7FD % values (~ 374 \n14%) were reanalysed and confirmed. 375 \n 376 \nSoils receiving atmospheric pollution may be magnetically contaminated by a range of 377 \nFe-rich particles derived from metalliferous industries (\u010eur\u017ea, 1999) and fossil fuel 378 \ncombustion (Flanders, 1994; Kapi\u010dka et al.,1999; Magiera and Strzyszcz, 2000). 379 \nFollowing the approach taken by Hay et al. (1997), we use the combined thresholds of 380 \n\u03c7FD % <3% and the median of the dataset (\u03c7LF > 0.38) to identify a potentially heavily 381 \npolluted sub-set (n = 637, 11% of original magnetic dataset).   382 \n 383 \n3.2 Datasets of soil factors 384 \nSoil parent material was obtained from Information of both bedrock and superficial cover 385 \nsourced from DiGmAPgb-50 under licence from the British Geological Survey (BGS 386 \nDigital Licence 2006\/134ed). At 1:50 000 not all data are available for Wales and 387 \ntherefore lower resolution data were used to assign data to our soil locations from either 388 \n1:250 000 (bedrock geology) or 1:625 000 for superficial geology where necessary. A 389 \ntotal of 151 rock types and 174 superficial cover types are distinguished, but for the 390 \npurposes of this study these have been aggregated into 44 and 22 broad compositional 391 \ntypes of Parent Material1 respectively (Figure 6a-b).

We refer to a \u2018complete\u2019 dataset, with entries in all the soil and 418 \nenvironmental variables (n = 5538), a \u2018polluted\u2019 dataset (n = 637) defined by two 419 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 18\nthreshold magnetic measurements,  and a \u2018reduced\u2019 dataset that excludes the polluted 420 \nsamples, samples with incomplete soil attribute data entries and five other samples with 421 \nunexplained negative \u03c7LF values.  The \u2018reduced\u2019 subset comprises 4896 samples for \u03c7LF 422 \nmeasurements and 4535 samples for \u03c7FD  and \u03c7FD % measurements and is used for the 423 \nmajority of analyses below. 424 \n 425 \nStatistical transformations of continuous data are used to derive distributions as close to 426 \nnormal as possible.  Thus log(10) transformed variables include \u03c7LF (log\u03c7LF), \u03c7FD +1 427 \n(log\u03c7FD) (Figure 3) logMAR) slope angle +1 (logSlope), %OC + 1 (logOC) and Altitude + 428 \n2 (logAlt). Mean annual temperature MAT data were reflected and then log (b10) 429 \ntransformed (logrMAT). Variables with constant units added to all their values have 430 \nnegative or 0 minimum values meaning that \u2018started log\u2019 transformations are required 431 \n(Cohen et al., 2003). Particle size data (carried out on samples with OC% < 15) have 432 \nalso been transformed as necessary with either log(10) or square root functions. 433 \n 434 \nThe SPSS statistical package is used to determine the directions and strengths of 435 \nrelationships between soil factors and magnetic parameters.  Soil factor variables exist 436 \nas either continuous (eg. MAR) or category (eg. Parent material) datasets.  For some 437 \nanalyses, continuous data are placed into classes to enable the production of box plots.  438 \nThe analyses comprise: A) Soil factor variables are ranked according to mean magnetic 439 \nvalues for each attribute category (text) or percentile class (continuous data).  B) Some 440 \ndata distributions are displayed using box plots and tables derived from classifying 441 \nnumeric continuous data based on percentiles where class 1 is 0 \u2013 < 10 percentile, class 442 \n2 is \u2265 10 percentile - < 20 percentile etc. up to class 9, but where classes 10, 11 and 12 443 \nequate to boundaries dictated by the 90, 95, 98 and 100 percentile values.

C) Relationships between continuous data 446 \n(eg. MAR) and magnetic parameters are examined using standard scatter plots with 447 \nsuperimposed 250 sample running means to show underlying trends together with box 448 \nplots (see Supplementary Information).  D) For some nominal\/ordinal based factors, 449 \nscatter plots of category mean magnetic data versus individual sample magnetic data 450 \nare employed to show and calculate the strength (Pearson moment correlation 451 \ncoefficient) of statistical association.  E) Some analysis of variance (ANOVA), including 452 \npost hoc tests, and t-tests are employed to determine whether differences between 453 \nclass\/category means are significant.  F) In order to determine the degree of linear 454 \ncorrelation, correlation coefficients are also calculated.  G) Standard multiple regression 455 \nmodels are applied to three datasets that vary in sample selection. The nonlinear nature 456 \nof magnetic associations with organic carbon means it was necessary to derive three 457 \nmodels with different data configurations.       458 \n 459 \nIn order to test for correlations between the magnetic parameters and the environmental 460 \nfactors, it is necessary to express the environmental variables in an appropriate 461 \nquantitative form.  For continuous data such as MAR and MAT it has simply been a 462 \nmatter of transformation to avoid skew. However, for the category data this is not 463 \npossible, and we have chosen instead to assign indices to each category calculated 464 \nfrom the observed magnetic parameter values as shown visibly, for example, for Parent 465 \nmaterial (Figure 7). Thus for \u03c7LF, the index for the parent material Chalk is simply the 466 \nmean \u03c7LF value of all samples located on chalk. The relative importance of Parent 467 \nmaterial as a predictor of \u03c7LF can then be tested by the relative magnitude of the 468 \ncorrelation coefficient.  Because magnetic parameters are being compared with both 469 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 20\ncategorical and measured quantitative data, it is important to rule out the possibility that 470 \ncategorisation biases the results. All of the data were categorised and there was no 471 \nsubstantial change in the order of importance of factors with regards to partial 472 \ncorrelations (see Supplementary Information). 473 \n 474 \n   475 \n4.

Values of \u03c7FD (\u00d7 10-9 m3 kg-1) also cover at least 481 \nthree orders of magnitude (0.00 - 2329.32) and are positively skewed. Values of \u03c7FD % 482 \nexhibit a more normal distribution with values between 0 and 13.6 % and are therefore 483 \nnot transformed. The reduced dataset (Table 1) has a lower median \u03c7LF value of 0.32 but 484 \nelevated median values for both \u03c7FD  and \u03c7FD  % of 14.37 and 4.07 respectively. Typical 485 \nranges of \u03c7LF, \u03c7FD and \u03c7FD % measurements for broad geologies and sediments are 486 \nquoted in Thompson and Oldfield (1986) and Walden et al. (1999), but notably the 487 \nranges of data for surface soils from England and Wales span a significant range of the 488 \npublished global range, including soils from Mediterranean and tropical areas (Dearing 489 \net al., 1996b; Dearing and Hannam, submitted).  490 \n 491 \nOnly 5 % of the samples show \u03c7LF < 0.1, indicating that the magnetic susceptibility of 95 492 \n% of soils is dominated by the presence of ferrimagnetic minerals, such as magnetite 493 \nand maghemite, rather than paramagnetic and canted anti-ferromagnetic minerals (eg. 494 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 21\nferrihydrite, goethite and hematite). Of the ferrimagnetic soils, 74.8 %, 44.7 %, 26.3 %, 495 \n12.7 % and 3.73 % have \u03c7FD % values greater than 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 respectively 496 \ndemonstrating that viscous superparamagnetic (VSPM) grains of magnetite\/maghemite 497 \nare present in > 75 % of samples and make significant contributions to the magnetic 498 \nvolume in > 50 % of the whole sample set (cf. Mullins, 1977; Maher, 1986; Dearing et al., 499 \n1996a; Dearing et al., 1997; Dearing et al., 2001a).  500 \n 501 \nBivariate plots (Figure 3a-f) of the three parameters (normal and log transformed) show 502 \npositive associations.  The plots of log\u03c7LF and \u03c7LF versus \u03c7FD % (Figure 3a and b) exhibit 503 \na dominant cluster of points where \u03c7LF < 2 across the whole range of \u03c7FD % values.  Two 504 \nsmaller clusters of points where \u03c7LF > 2 exist for ranges of \u03c7FD % values > 9 and < 3.  505 \nThe latter cluster corresponds to polluted samples excluded from further analysis.  506 \nCorrelations show r2 values of 0.56 (log\u03c7LF) and 0.29 (\u03c7LF) for the non-polluted datasets.  507 \nThe shape of these plots suggests a \u2018saturation\u2019 distribution of ferrimagnetic minerals 508 \n(SP-VSPM-SSD) equivalent to maximum \u03c7FD % values ~12 %.  The plots of log\u03c7FD and 509 \n\u03c7FD versus \u03c7FD % (Figures 3c and d) show r2 values of 0.82 and 0.31 respectively, 510 \nindicating that the distribution of ferrimagnetic grains (\u03c7FD %) is more strongly related to 511 \nthe concentration of VSPM grains (\u03c7FD) than the total concentration of all ferrimagnetic 512 \ngrains (\u03c7LF).  The strongest correlations exist for log\u03c7LF and \u03c7LF versus \u03c7FD (Figures 3e 513 \nand f) at 0.89 and 0.96 respectively. The strength of these relationships confirms that the 514 \ntotal concentrations of ferrimagnetic minerals (\u03c7LF) is very closely related to the 515 \nconcentration of VSPM grains (\u03c7FD).   516 \n  517 \n4.2 Magnetic spatial patterns 518 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 22\nComparison of maps of place names \/ geographical features (Figure 4a) and magnetic 519 \npatterns of \u03c7LF, \u03c7FD and \u03c7FD % (Figure 4b-d) shows a number of regional clusters of high 520 \nmagnetic values (> 1.0).  These features are broadly repeated for each parameter. The 521 \nlargest clusters cover much of southwest England (counties of Devon and Cornwall) 522 \nwhere the mean value (\u03c7LF = 3.04) is more than three times the dataset average.  The 523 \nrelatively high values of \u03c7FD % in Devon and Cornwall (x\u00af  = 7.56) suggest that many are 524 \ndominated by VSPMs (cf. Dearing et al., 1997).  There are smaller clusters of high \u03c7LF 525 \nvalues in lowland England on the Cotswolds Hills, Salisbury Plain, the counties of 526 \nWiltshire, Dorset, and Cambridgeshire, and to a lesser extent the North and South 527 \nDowns, and Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds.  The distribution of \u03c7FD values is similar 528 \nto \u03c7LF but highlights with even more clarity the association with uplands especially in SE 529 \nEngland.

Finally, to address concerns that the impact of some 671 \nenvironmental factors such as MAR is masked by effects of waterlogging, multiple 672 \nregression is also applied to the Model 2b data subset after having removed all but the 673 \nbest drained (Class 4) samples (Model 3). Thus, Model 3 tests, for example, whether 674 \nstronger linear relationships exist between logMAR and soil magnetism in free-draining 675 \nsoils. Multiple regression analyses are carried out for \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % but not mass specific 676 \n\u03c7FD as this parameter shows a close correspondence to \u03c7LF in the England and Wales 677 \ndataset (Figure 3f).  678 \n 679 \n 680 \nZero order correlations  681 \nFor Model 1, and for both \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD %, Parent Material is the highest ranked factor with 682 \n23 - 25 % explanation of variance, followed by Drainage with 14 \u2013 19 %. (Table 8). Of 683 \nthe remaining variables used only four (Land use, Texture, logMAR and Slope) account 684 \nfor \u2265 5 % variation in any magnetic parameter. However, \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % show very 685 \ndifferent environmental associations: Land use and Texture are important explanatory 686 \nfactors for \u03c7LF, while Slope and MAR are substantially more powerful explanatory factors 687 \nfor \u03c7FD % (Table 8). When categorised, (Supplementary Information Table 1) the 688 \nnonlinear variables associated with organic rich soil and peat appear to be more 689 \ninfluential factors upon \u03c7LF. However, the majority of variance is still accounted for by 690 \nParent material, Drainage, Land use and Texture.  691 \n 692 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 29\nWith highly organic samples excluded (Model 2a), there is less difference between \u03c7LF 693 \nand \u03c7FD % with MAR becoming the third ranked factor (after Parent material and 694 \nDrainage) for both parameters (Table 10a - b). This change from Model 1 is explained by 695 \nthe influence of high rainfall peat-rich sites included in the full sample set. Lower ranked 696 \nfactors are also not very different between \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD %.  Although the ranking shows 697 \nslight differences, the amounts of variance explained are similar in all cases, and far 698 \nlower than the top three factors. The similarity of \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % in their relationships to 699 \nenvironmental factors is not affected by the inclusion of particle size data (Model 2b). For 700 \nboth parameters CSand is second only to Parent material as a univariate explanatory 701 \nfactor. Exclusion of poorly drained samples (Model 3) has little impact on the higher 702 \nranked factors, but does markedly increase the fraction of \u03c7LF variance explained by 703 \nlogMAR. 704 \n 705 \nMultivariate regression analysis  706 \nStandard multiple regression analysis is carried out on the same datasets (Models 1, 2a, 707 \n2b and 3) to determine the level of explanation that can be achieved with regard to 708 \nlog\u03c7LF and \u03c7FD %, and to estimate the unique contribution of each environmental factor. 709 \nFurther statistics and figures examining, possible univariate and multivariate outliers are 710 \nconsidered in the Supplementary Information. 711 \n 712 \nModel 1 for log\u03c7LF (Table 9a) shows r is significantly different from zero, F(11, 4884) = 713 \n283.27, p < 0.001, giving an adjusted r2 of 0.39. As measured by the partial and part 714 \n(see definitions in Supplementary Information) r2 values and beta coefficients, the most 715 \nsignificant contributors are Parent material, Drainage, and Land use.  If used together 716 \nwithout the other factors, Parent material and Drainage produce a model with r2 of 0.29 717 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 30\nand RMSE of 0.40. At the p < 0.001 significance level variables Time, logrMAT and 718 \nlogSlope are not significant contributors to the model prediction.  Model 1 for \u03c7FD % gives 719 \nan adjusted r2 of 0.36.  In common with \u03c7LF, Parent material and Drainage are the most 720 \nimportant variables as signified by the largest beta coefficients and account for the 721 \ngreatest unique variance in \u03c7FD % when all other factors are accounted for (Table 9b). 722 \nTexture, Land use and logOC have less predictive power than for log\u03c7LF, but logMAR 723 \nhas greater importance.  These differences in the position of lower ranking factors are 724 \nprobably due to the loss of peat-based samples in the frequency dependent data set that 725 \nreduces the number of sites with very high rainfall and upland land uses.  726 \n 727 \nModel 2a (Table 10 a - b), as with Model 1, employs standard multiple regression and all 728 \nvariables to predict both log\u03c7LF and \u03c7FD %. Model 2a for log\u03c7LF shows r significantly 729 \ndifferent from zero, F(11, 4332) = 261.27, p < 0.001, giving an adjusted r2 of 0.40 and a 730 \nlower RMSE of 0.333.  Parent material has the greatest partial and part r2 values, with 731 \nDrainage as the second most important factor. Only two other factors have partial r2 732 \nvalues of greater than 0.02; Texture and Land use.  In contrast to the zero order 733 \ncorrelation, the partial and part r2 values for MAR are very low, suggesting that MAR has 734 \nlittle unique influence over log\u03c7LF. If Parent material and logMAR are used alone in a 735 \nstandard multiple regression for log\u03c7LF only 1.8 units of the 28 % variance accounted for 736 \nby the total model are unique to logMAR despite a zero order correlation of 0.07, 737 \nsuggesting most of the shared variance can be attributed to Parent material. The partial 738 \nr2 and zero order correlation values for Land use are also far lower than for Model 1, 739 \ndemonstrating that the relationship between Land use and log\u03c7LF in Model 1 is largely 740 \ndue to the effects of peat-based soils with little variation attributable to other land use 741 \ncategories.

All 747 \nfactors change relatively little as a result of removing samples with \u2018unreliable\u2019 \u03c7FD %, 748 \nvalues, equivalent to removing samples with %OC > 12.  749 \n  750 \nModel 2b for log\u03c7LF, r differs significantly from zero, F(12, 4116 df) = 282.41, p < 0.001, 751 \ngiving an adjusted r2 of 0.45 and a RMSE of 0.319 (Table 10c), with CSand making a 752 \nsubstantial contribution, with partial, part and zero order r2 values second only to Parent 753 \nmaterial, with the contributions of all other factors except Texture weakening with their 754 \naddition. The unique impact of logMAR, already small for Model 2a (r2 = 0.011), declines 755 \nsubstantially in Model 2b (r2 = 0.003).  For \u03c7FD %, model 2b has an r value that differs 756 \nsignificantly from zero for Model 2b F(12, 4048 df) = 220.40, p < 0.001, giving an 757 \nadjusted r2 of 0.40 and a RMSE of 2.17 (Table 10d). A weakening of the unique impacts 758 \nof Parent material and Drainage is evident, as the factor of logCSand shares some of 759 \nthese factors with previously unique accounted variance. logCSand now ranks as the 760 \nthird greatest unique contributor (partial and part r2), but in isolation has the second 761 \nhighest zero order r2.

As with Model 2b, 772 \nlogMAR has very little unique impact, despite its relatively large zero-order contribution. 773 \nThis implies, as in Model 2, that virtually all of the variance explained by logMAR in the 774 \nzero order correlation is shared with Parent material.  Model 3 for l\u03c7FD %  has r 775 \nsignificantly different from zero, F(11, 2025) = 111.127, p < 0.001, giving an adjusted r2 776 \nof 0.37 and RMSE of 2.16 (Table 11b). The first two ranked contributors (disregarding 777 \nthe excluded Drainage) are unchanged but now exhibit strengthened contributions 778 \n(Table 11a-b). As with log\u03c7LF , logMAR is elevated to the third most important contributor 779 \nto the regression as judged by zero order correlations.  However, as the part correlation 780 \nshows when using accounting for the effect of other all variables, logMAR only accounts 781 \nfor 0.5 units of the total explained variance of 37 %. Importantly, despite low unique 782 \ncontributions, zero order correlations for LOC and Time increase appreciably for Model 783 \n3, and as with log\u03c7LF, the zero order correlation for logSlope declines.784 \n 785 \n6.0 Discussion 786 \n 787 \n6.1 Magnetism and soil factors 788 \n 789 \nParent material 790 \nBoth bivariate and multivariate analyses place Parent material as the factor with the 791 \nhighest level of explanation at this spatial scale of analysis, reaffirming the ranking of 792 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 33\nparent material as a first order control in the conceptual model (Figure 1).

Indeed, if extreme outliers (n = 81) mostly due to ferruginous parent 804 \nmaterials are removed (untransformed Fe may then be employed) from the reduced 805 \nsubset, total soil Fe (mg kg-1) shows a high correlation with log\u03c7LF (r2 = 0.30, p < 0.05) 806 \nand less positive but still significant correlations with frequency dependent data (Figure 807 \n10; Table 12). The mean \u221a Fe concentration for soils (using all data) on particular parent 808 \nmaterials also shows a positive gradient (Figure 11). This is consistent with the proposed 809 \ncausal links between parent material, soil Fe concentrations and SFM formation 810 \n(Dearing et al., 1996a).  811 \n 812 \nHowever, not all samples with elevated \u221a Fe have increased log\u03c7LF values as shown by 813 \nsoils developed upon Mudstone (M), Mud-rich Limestone, Limestone impure, Halitic 814 \nrocks and Tidal flat (Figure 11 a). In these situations, it could be argued that SFM 815 \nformation is not favoured due to adverse pedogenic conditions. Conversely, it is possible 816 \nto observe relatively low total Fe concentrations associated with moderately high \u03c7LF 817 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 34\nvalues as demonstrated by the mean log\u03c7LF values for soils on parent materials such as 818 \nChalk, Sandstone (P), Granite, and Glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean \u03c7FD % values are also 819 \nstrongly associated with total Fe and show a similar relationship (Figure 11 b), but low 820 \nvalues for Alluvium, despite relatively high mean \u221a Fe, suggest a further a link with 821 \ndrainage.     822 \n 823 \nClimate 824 \nIn the conceptual model (Figure 1), climate is postulated as a first order control on soil 825 \nmagnetism.  In this study, however, the associations between MAR and MAT and 826 \nmagnetic parameters are relatively weak.  Model 1, demonstrates that logMAR shows no 827 \nsignificant linear relationship with log\u03c7LF. However, by restricting samples to %OC < 12, 828 \na large increase in zero order r2 demonstrates its greater ability to predict log\u03c7LF and \u03c7FD 829 \n% despite accounting for very little unique variance when used with the other factors.  830 \nSimilarly, the effect of logMAR is complicated by differences in Parent material and 831 \nDrainage factors. If samples affected by poor drainage are removed, as in model 3 832 \n(Figure 12a and c), the relationship with logMAR strengthens. By restricting the dataset 833 \nfurther to samples that have MAR values < 1500 mm a stronger relationship is evident. If 834 \nthe dataset in Model 3 is constrained for Parent material the relationship between 835 \nlogMAR and log\u03c7LF for a particular parent material is often one of increasing \u03c7LF up to 836 \nlogMAR ~1200 - 1500 mm followed by a decline (Figure 13). However, given the 837 \nimportance of Fe as driver of SFM production, any positive correlation with logMAR 838 \n(Model 3) may well be coincidental as the wettest areas in England and Wales tend to 839 \nhave the more Fe-rich parent materials.    840 \n 841 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 35\nIt has been suggested by Maher and Thompson (1995) that above 1500 mm rainfall soil 842 \nconditions become adverse for pedogenic magnetic enhancement, a finding that is 843 \nlargely supported here.  After removing the effect of parent material there appears to be 844 \na small positive influence from logMAR. This may reaffirm the link between rainfall and 845 \nweathering, but strong bivariate correlations with organic carbon and pH may also point 846 \nto additional roles in magnetic enhancement processes.  In contrast to rainfall, the role of 847 \ntemperature in controlling the magnetic dataset is small: logrMAT, both in the constricted 848 \nand whole data sets, shows little relationship with soil magnetism.  This suggests that 849 \nany effect, if it exists, operates at a continental scale.  850 \n 851 \nRelief and Drainage 852 \nRelief and drainage are viewed in the conceptual model as second order factors, 853 \noperating at more local scales.  Although there are significant associations between 854 \nlogSlope and the magnetic parameters (Supplementary Information, Figure S4), the 855 \neffects of relief, as encapsulated by logSlope and logAlt, are relatively weak when all 856 \ndata are considered (Model 1). Steeper slope angles (especially > 12\u00b0) are more often 857 \nassociated with good drainage and many of these soils are upon parent materials with 858 \nsoils exhibiting higher magnetic values, but they represent only a minority of samples. 859 \nGenerally logSlope, except at relatively high values, gives little insight into levels of 860 \ndrainage in the soil and rarely accounts for additional variance beyond that explained by 861 \nParent material alone. Relief is therefore an influential factor on soil magnetism through 862 \nits inter-correlations with others factors; the relevance of altitude and slope being 863 \nrealised at their upper extremes. High altitude areas, for example, exhibit high rainfall 864 \nand often peaty soils. Steeper slopes, although coincident with greater rainfall are better 865 \ndrained and generally associated with parent materials that in this dataset exhibit soils 866 \nwith greater magnetic values. The clear separation of magnetic values, especially \u03c7FD % 867 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 36\n(Table 2), for the similar parent materials Sandstone and Mudstone (P) and Sandstone 868 \nand Mudstone (M), the former on average associated with steeper and better drained 869 \nslopes (logSlope x\u00af  = 0.85 \u00b1 0.07 and x\u00af  = 0.62 \u00b1 0.1, respectively), suggests that slope 870 \nmay have a stronger effect at sub-regional scales.  871 \n 872 \nThe effect of drainage is explored though the use of Texture and Drainage categories. 873 \nTexture is inter-correlated with Parent material, Land use, pH, OC and MAR, as 874 \nexemplified by the partial correlation between Texture and log\u03c7LF of r = 0.15 (r2 = 0.02) 875 \nafter all other variables are held constant.  However, it retains a significant level of 876 \nexplanation even after parent material is accounted for.  877 \n 878 \nDrainage index ranks second to Parent material when all data are employed for both 879 \nzero order and partial\/part correlations with magnetic parameters (Table 9a-b), but the 880 \nstrength of correlation between these variables is relatively low (r = 0.30, p < 0.05) 881 \nsuggesting some degree of independence. A multiple regression model with only Parent 882 \nmaterial and Drainage as variables is able to account for 29 % (total with all variables is 883 \n39 %) and 31.8 % (total with all variables is 36 %) of the variability in log\u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % 884 \nrespectively, with only 9 % and 16 % common shared explained variance. However, 885 \nDrainage is relegated to third position when CSand is included in Model 2b. The 886 \nimportance of CSand underlines the positive role of free drainage, providing a more 887 \ndiscriminatory variable of drainage than the broad and qualitative drainage classes. The 888 \nsignificance .of CSand might be interpreted in terms of a proxy for primary minerals.   889 \nHowever primary minerals (especially primary magnetite) tend to fall into a silt sized 890 \nfraction (2 - 63 \u00b5m) with which there is no correlation. Also, there are no significant 891 \nassociations between CSand and parent materials expected to contain primary magnetic 892 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 37\nminerals, and such an interpretation would contradict the high correlations between 893 \nCSand and \u03c7FD values.   894 \n 895 \nFigure 14 demonstrates graphically the link between parent material, drainage and soil 896 \nmagnetism. Parent materials ranked according to the frequency of soils with drainage 897 \nclass 4 (free-draining) show a corresponding declining trend in mean \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % 898 \nvalues.  Some Parent material categories show mean magnetic values that lie 899 \nconsistently above the trend: Limestone (Ooidal), Schist and slate, Mudstone (P) and 900 \nMudstone and Sandstone (P).  These are all Fe rich and highly weatherable substrates. 901 \nThis is consistent with the conceptual model that predicts the weathering of Fe and the 902 \nexistence of free-draining soil profiles compound their individual effects to cause the 903 \nhighest rates of SFM production and accumulation.   904 \n 905 \n 906 \n 907 \nOrganisms and Vegetation 908 \nOrganisms and vegetation are considered in the conceptual model (Figure 1) as second 909 \nor third order factors whose effects operate most strongly at local scales.  This idea is 910 \nsupported by the relatively low rankings of Land use, %OC and pH for explaining overall 911 \nvariability in magnetic parameters. For bivariate analyses (Table 8), Land use is the 912 \nhighest ranked for all three parameters and, in terms of land use type, ley grassland is 913 \nthe highest ranked (Table 5b). However, the regression analysis shows that the level of 914 \nexplanation is confounded by the presence of many soils with high levels of organic 915 \ncarbon. The results of regression Model 2a demonstrate that the relationship between 916 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 38\nLand use and log\u03c7LF is largely due to the effects of peat-based soils with little variation 917 \nexplained by Land use when they are excluded from the analysis.  918 \n 919 \nThe association of logOC with magnetic parameters (See Supplementary Information 920 \nFigure S7; Table 6a) shows the greatest positive correlation in samples with %OC < 5.4 921 \n%.  Low to moderate levels of organic carbon suggest a relatively fast carbon turnover 922 \ncharacteristic of a biologically active system.   An assumption that %OC represents 923 \norganic substrate availability for bacterial activity in the rhizosphere is consistent with 924 \narguments for the need for populations of DIRBs to expand during anaerobic episodes. 925 \nThe linear relationship between %OC and magnetic parameters suggests that %OC may 926 \neven represent limiting conditions up to a threshold value of ~ 6 %.  Above this level, the 927 \naccumulation of large amounts of organic matter driven by poor drainage, low 928 \ntemperature and acidic conditions might represent soil conditions inimical to bacterially 929 \nmediated SFM formation or accumulation.  930 \n 931 \nOverall the explanatory power of pH is low, due to bimodal associations with all three 932 \nmagnetic parameters (See Supplementary Information, Figure 8 ). pH is also strongly 933 \ncorrelated with Land use and logMAR (r = 0.53 and -0.60, p < 0.05) and Models 2 and 3 934 \nshow that pH has low explanatory power even when samples from the organic and wet 935 \nuplands are excluded. Thus, it seems that pH is strongly dependent on other factors at 936 \nthis scale although it may be an important contributor to iron transformation processes 937 \nand SFM formation at more localised scales.   938 \n 939 \nAssessment of organisms and vegetation is complicated by studying areas with a 940 \nmillennial-scale history of forest clearance and land use change, which includes the use 941 \nof fire, introduction of agricultural methods and application of manures and soil 942 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 39\nconditioners.  In fact, it is doubtful whether the variability in %OC and pH in lowland soils 943 \n7000 years ago would have been as high under continuous forest cover as it is today.  It 944 \ncould therefore be argued that the presence of strong associations in the modern 945 \nenvironment indicate that soil magnetic properties have tracked changing soil conditions.  946 \nThe evidence here for controls on SFM formation by %OC and to a lesser extent pH, 947 \nrather than Land Use itself, suggest that soil chemistry, rather than broader land 948 \nmanagement scenarios, are important drivers for local variations in soil magnetic 949 \nproperties.  950 \n 951 \nTime 952 \nTime in pedogenesis is probably the most intractable factor. The previous discussion 953 \nsuggests that magnetic properties may be in equilibrium with modern soil conditions, but 954 \ncan we identify longer term controls? A simple comparison across 3 areas (Table 7) 955 \nshows no significant associations between time elapsed for pedogenesis and magnetic 956 \nproperties, and multiple regression Model 1 shows Time with statistically significant but 957 \nlow explanatory power (Table 9). However, Model 3 (Table 11) shows that the factor of 958 \nTime displays an increased zero order correlation for l\u03c7FD %. 959 \n 960 \nOne problem in these analyses is the confounding effects of parent material that is not 961 \nequally represented in each area.  Figures 15 (a \u2013 f) demonstrate the importance of 962 \nparent material between areas through the ability of the mean magnetic value for soils 963 \ndeveloped upon different parent materials to predict the actual magnetic value. It can be 964 \nseen that r2 values increase when predicting both log\u03c7LF and \u03c7FD % from Area 1 to 3 as 965 \nParent material loses explanatory power. In order to control for the effect of Parent 966 \nMaterial, an analysis was undertaken of samples that span all three areas on Chalk.

In contrast means of \u03c7FD % show significant differences between areas for all 973 \nconstraint options (all samples on Chalk, Welch F(2, 47.33df) = 10.25, p < 0.05; 974 \ndominant soil type, Welch F(2, 11.52df) = 13.86, p < 0.05; arable land use, Welch F(2, 975 \n6.965df) = 10.57, p < 0.05). Games-Howell post-hoc tests indicate that Area 1 and 2 976 \nhave significantly different means for all samples, whereas Areas 1 and 2, and 3 and 1 977 \nhave significant differences when constrained by land use and soil type.   978 \n 979 \nThus, these results suggest that the concentration of ferrimagnetic grains is not a direct 980 \nfunction of pedogenic time over timescales spanning the late Pleistocene.  However, 981 \nhigher \u03c7FD % values in chalk soils in Area 1 compared to Area 2 and specifically, at the 982 \nfurther constraining levels, between Area 1 and Area 2, and between Area 2 and Area 3 983 \nprovide significant evidence for a shift in the ferrimagnetic grain distribution, with the 984 \nproportion of VSPM grains to all ferrimagnetic grains increasing with age.  It is not 985 \npossible to identify whether this effect is common across different parent materials or 986 \nspecific to chalk.  If specific to chalk, one plausible explanation would be a shift in the 987 \nferrimagnetic grain size distribution through time as VSPM grains accumulate in the 988 \npresence of SD magnetic inclusions (Hounslow and Maher 1996).    989 \n 990 \nUnexplained factorial variance   991 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 41\nThe multiple regression models account for 36 \u2013 46 % of variance in the two magnetic 992 \nparameters and there are several potential causes for the unexplained variance. First, 993 \nthere are several sources of error and variability. These include compositional categories 994 \n(eg. parent materials) that are not ideally constrained, differences between the scale of 995 \nsome data sets (eg. geological classes taken from Digimap), the inherent large scale 996 \nvariation found in many soil properties at the field scale, and random ferrous materials 997 \nintroduced to the soil system, such as metallic and minerogenic trash, which are not 998 \nexcluded by the criteria used for polluted soils. Second, the contribution by weakly 999 \nmagnetic Fe-bearing paramagnetic minerals increases disproportionately in soils with 1000 \nlow \u03c7LF values.  Third, the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals in a sample is diluted 1001 \nby the presence of diamagnetic (non-magnetic) materials, such as calcium carbonate 1002 \nand organic matter.  This can be expected to suppress \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD values in, particularly, 1003 \nchalk and peat soils though the quantitative effects are estimated not to be significant to 1004 \nthe overall patterns.   Fourth, there are potentially different sets of conditions driving the 1005 \nproduction of ferrimagnetic minerals that are not easily simulated in this study.  For 1006 \nexample, the cluster of high \u03c7LF and \u03c7FD values south of The Wash in eastern England 1007 \n(Figure 4) not associated with Fe-rich parent materials is a potential anomaly. This 1008 \ncluster of over 30 samples has an environmental context quite different from other highly 1009 \nmagnetic clusters as it is  situated at the edge of peatlands over marine sediments.  One 1010 \nplausible explanation that is currently under examination is the formation of greigite 1011 \n(Fe3S4), a ferrimagnetic iron sulphide produced under anaerobic conditions in the 1012 \npresence of sulphur-containing sediments and sulphate-reducing bacteria. 1013 \n 1014 \nOverall the ranking of factors is overwhelmingly dominated by parent material and 1015 \ndrainage, including the significant variable of coarse sand.  A second group of influential 1016 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 42\nbut subordinate factors includes mean annual rainfall, slope and altitude, land use, 1017 \norganic carbon and pH. A third group of factors including mean annual temperature and 1018 \ntime are deemed not relevant at these spatial and temporal scales. 1019 \n 1020 \n 1021 \n6.2 SFM formation 1022 \n 1023 \nSFMs and soil types 1024 \nFindings here are highly consistent with the ranking of soil groups and sub groups (Table 1025 \n13) by mean magnetic values. Soil classification in England and Wales takes into 1026 \naccount a range of factors that are instrumental in the formation of a particular soil. 1027 \nExcluding man-made soils, Lithomorphic, Podzolic and Brown Soils are the three highest 1028 \nranked major soil groups in all three magnetic parameters. Typical Brown Podzolic, 1029 \nBrown Ranker and Brown Rendzina are in the top three positions for all magnetic 1030 \nparameters in the ranking of soil sub-groups. By contrast, the lowest ranked major soil 1031 \ngroups for all parameters are Terrestrial Raw, Raw Gley and Groundwater Gleys, and for 1032 \nsoil sub-groups the lowest positions are dominated by categories such as Stagnogley 1033 \nPodzol, Typical Humic Gley, Raw Oligo-fibrous Peat, Typical Sandy Gley, Pelo-1034 \nCalcareous Alluvial Gley and Cambic Stagnohumic Gley. All these soil types utilise 1035 \nclassification criteria that are strongly linked to parent material type and drainage. The 1036 \ndominant factor in these rankings appears to be drainage, with well-drained soils ranked 1037 \nhigh and poorly drained soils (eg. gleys) ranked low. However, while Typical Brown 1038 \nPodzolics are ranked first, other true podzols (eg. Humo-Ferric Podzol) are ranked much 1039 \nlower suggesting that free drainage that promote incipient podzolisation is positive with 1040 \nregards SFM formation, but extreme chelation and eluviation are destructive. Parent 1041 \nmaterial plays a significant role in identifying young and thin soils (rankers) and 1042 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 43\nlithomorphic rendzina soils on calcareous substrates, both ranked highly. The strength of 1043 \nassociation between soil sub groups and soil magnetism may be gauged by plotting 1044 \nactual observed magnetic values against mean values for each soil sub-group (Figure 1045 \n16). The correlation coefficients (figure 16) are similar or better than explanations using 1046 \nModel 1 (r2 values (0.37 - 0.38) showing that the combination of factors inherent in soil 1047 \nclassification are a strong predictor of soil magnetic properties.   1048 \n 1049 \nSFM concentrations and distributions  1050 \nOne remarkable finding in the study is the strength of magnetic inter-parameter 1051 \ncorrelations (Figure 3). These are partly explained by interrelated expressions, yet for 1052 \nthe majority of non-polluted samples measured the data suggest (Figure 3f) that the 1053 \nconcentration of VSPM grains (\u03c7FD) is directly proportional to the total concentration of 1054 \nferrimagnetic minerals (\u03c7LF).   The weaker relationship between the total ferrimagnetic 1055 \nconcentration (\u03c7LF) and the distribution of ferrimagnetic grains (\u03c7FD %)  indicates (Figure 1056 \n3b) that the highest categories of \u03c7FD % (10 - 14 %) effectively define an 'ultimate' grain 1057 \nsize distribution where the proportion of VSPM grains to the combined total of smaller 1058 \nand larger SP, PSD, SD and MD grains is maximal.  Thus, a key question to ask is why 1059 \nother soils fail to reach this level of \u03c7FD %. There are several possible reasons: 1) 1060 \nprocesses involving abiotic aging of ferrihydrite to maghemite (cf. Barr\u00f3n and Torrent 1061 \n2002) or magnetite crystal growth (e.g. Hansel et al., 2003) may be expected to produce 1062 \nmore SD grains which suppress \u03c7FD %; 2) the balance between formation\/accumulation 1063 \nand destructive processes may be skewed towards destruction, such that the population 1064 \nof the finest grains including VSPM is constrained; 3) the SFM mechanism varies in 1065 \nterms of the grain size distribution formed depending on local soil conditions.  1066 \n 1067 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 44\nSFM conceptual model 1068 \nThe findings from the study essentially confirm the SFM conceptual model as it applies 1069 \nto temperate regions (Figure 1) but with qualifications.  Parent material remains the first 1070 \norder control operating at regional scales providing the source of Fe through weathering 1071 \nfor SFM production.  All other factors being equal, it seems that parent materials that are 1072 \neither deficient in Fe-bearing minerals or typified by very slow rates of weathering will not 1073 \nproduce a rate of Fe supply that is conducive to the production and accumulation of high 1074 \nconcentrations of SFMs. The equally important drainage factor means that good 1075 \ndrainage in surface soils provides the essential anoxic-oxic cycling in the 1076 \nmicroenvironment as the soil changes from wet to dry conditions. Poorly drained soils 1077 \nlack oxic phases and maximise the effects of reductive diagenesis. The subordinate but 1078 \npositive effect of mean annual rainfall suggests that Fe-supply is at least partly driven by 1079 \nthe intensity of hydrolysis. Thus for England and Wales, at least, we may speculate that 1080 \nthere are two critical stages in the process of SFM production and accumulation that 1081 \ninvolve initially the supply of Fe and secondly the presence of free drainage.  These 1082 \nstages are consistent with both the ferrihydrite-maghemite-hematite (Barr\u00f3n and Torrent 1083 \n2002) and ferrihydrite-magnetite (maghemite) (Dearing et al., 1996a) models.  However, 1084 \nthe subordinate role of climate largely through rainfall rather than temperature would 1085 \nargue strongly for the ferrihydrite-magnetite (maghemite) process to be dominant in 1086 \ntemperate regions, particularly as the ferrihydrite-maghemite-hematite process is 1087 \nstrongly temperature sensitive. Additionally, the weak association of low to moderate 1088 \nlevels of organic carbon and pH with optimal distributions of nanoscale VSPM grains 1089 \nmay indicate a minor contribution of DIRB reduction of ferrihydrite to magnetite 1090 \nformation. However, the evidence does not support a major contribution of biotic 1091 \nprocesses to what is dominantly an abiotic steady state mineral transformation.

Mean annual temperature 1103 \nand time (>103 years) do not appear to be significant factors at these spatial and 1104 \ntemporal scales.  About 11% of the samples, mainly from areas close to urban and older 1105 \nindustrial centres, are considered contaminated by atmospheric pollution particles. 1106 \n 1107 \nMultiple regression models show that soil forming factors account for 36 - 46 % of 1108 \nvariance in the two magnetic parameters, with parent material and good drainage 1109 \ntogether accounting for ~ 30 % of the magnetic variability in the complete dataset.  A 1110 \nsurprising and potentially important finding is the relevance of coarse sand which is 1111 \nsecond only to parent material as an explanatory factor of soil magnetic values, 1112 \nunderlining the importance of soil drainage. 1113 \n 1114 \nThe results are consistent with a dominant mechanism of SFM production driven by Fe-1115 \nsupply from weathering, followed by the production of ferrihydrite with conversion to 1116 \nmagnetite\/maghemite minerals within the SP and SSD grain size ranges.  The 1117 \nimportance of organic carbon and pH suggests that biomineralization through bacteria 1118 \nmediated Fe reduction may play an additional role in the production of SFMs. 1119 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 46\n 1120 \nFigure captions 1121 \n 1122 \nFigure 1.
