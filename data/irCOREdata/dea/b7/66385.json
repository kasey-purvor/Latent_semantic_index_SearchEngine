This natural magnification\nprovides the opportunity to study intrinsically faint high\nredshift galaxies with a spatial resolution and to surface\nbrightness limits that cannot be attained via conventional\nobservations. These highly magnified sources can provide\nunique insights into the properties of typical galaxies at early\ntimes in the Universe (Smail et al. 1996; Franx et al. 1997;\nTeplitz et al. 2000; Ellis et al. 2001; Campusano et al. 2001;\nSmith et al. 2002; Swinbank et al. 2003; Kneib et al. 2004).\nThe majority of known galaxy cluster lenses are at z <\u223c 0.3,\nwhich makes them ideal for detailed studies of galaxies at\nz >\u223c 1 (Edge et al. 2003; Sand et al. 2005), i.e. before the\nUniverse had reached half of its current age.\nAt z >\u223c 1 important questions regarding the relation-\nship between the total mass of a galaxy and the bary-\nonic mass locked up in stars remain unanswered. In lo-\ncal rotationally-supported spiral galaxies, this relation is\nbest described by the Tully-Fisher relation (Tully & Fisher\n1977) \u2013 an empirical correlation between the terminal ro-\ntational velocity (or line width) and the absolute magni-\ntude of a spiral galaxy. This relationship may reflect how\nrotationally-supported galaxies formed, perhaps suggesting\nthe presence of self regulating processes for star formation in\ngalactic disks. Measuring the evolution of the Tully-Fisher\n(TF) relation as a function of look back time therefore pro-\nvides important insights into the growth of galaxy mass\n2 Swinbank et al.\n(Vogt et al. 1997; Bo\u00a8hm et al. 2003; Milvang-Jensen et al.\n2003; Bamford et al. 2005). One specific and rather simple\ntest is to determine whether the stellar mass in galaxies\nhas increased in lock-step with the mass of the dark matter\nhalo or whether the stellar mass grows within a pre-existing\ndark matter halo. The former is predicted by \u201chierarchi-\ncal\u201d galaxy formation models (e.g. White & Frenk 1991;\nKauffmann et al. 1994; Cole et al. 2000) since the growth\nof the stellar disk is regulated by the rate at which gas is\naccreted by the halo (the accretion rate is similar for gas and\ndark matter). The latter is characteristic of simple \u201cclassi-\ncal\u201d galaxy formation models such as Eggen et al. (1962).\nIn simplified outline, the hierarchical model predicts that\nthe correlation between the terminal rotation velocity and\nstellar mass should evolve little, while the classical model\npredicts that the stellar mass corresponding to a fixed rota-\ntion velocity should decrease with increasing redshift.\nThis observational test can be made using the galaxies\nphotometry as a proxy for stellar mass. It is now generally\naccepted that the shape, zero-point and scatter of the TF\nrelation depend on bandpass and that a smaller dispersion\nis obtained for near-infrared band-passes (i.e. rest-frame I\nrather than rest-frame B-band). The dust-correction is much\nsmaller in near-infrared photometry and moreover, it is more\nsensitive to the underlying, evolved stellar population which\nbest traces the stellar mass and thus correlates more tightly\nwith the maximum rotational speed (or total galaxy mass;\nVerheijen 2001; Conselice et al. 2005) (we note that, for gas-\nrich systems the bluer pass-bands are more sensitive to cur-\nrent star-formation and therefore may also correlate closely\nto total baryonic mass).\nHowever at z>\u223c1 the small angular size of galaxies means\nthat obtaining spatially resolved rotation curves is extremely\nchallenging (e.g. a typical local spiral has a scale length of\n4 kpc, which corresponds to only 0.5\u2032\u2032 at z=1). One solution\nto this problem is to exploit the magnifying power of fore-\nground galaxy cluster lenses \u2013 for a typical lens magnifica-\ntion factor of ten, 0.6\u2032\u2032 corresponds to an unlensed physical\nscale of just <\u223c0.5 kpc at z = 1. Thus galaxies can be tar-\ngeted that would otherwise be too small. Spatially resolved\nkinematics can also be achieved on spatial scales far greater\nthan otherwise possible due to the increased flux sensitiv-\nity over conventional observations. Moreover, the benefits\nof gravitational magnification are complemented by Inte-\ngral Field Spectroscopy (which produces a contiguous x, y,\nvelocity map at each point in the galaxy) of the target galax-\nies. Clean decoupling of the spatial and spectral information\nis therefore feasible, thus eliminating problems arising from\nmixing of the two in traditional long-slit observations. It is\ntherefore much easier to identify which galaxies have regu-\nlar (bi-symmetric) velocity fields for comparison with local\nspirals.\nIn this paper we present a study of six z=1\ngravitationally-lensed galaxies observed through the cores\nof four galaxy cluster lenses. Five of the targets lie be-\nhind Abell 2390, Cl 2236-04 and RGB1745+398, the sixth\n(Arc#289 at z=1.034 behind A2218) was previously dis-\ncussed in Swinbank et al. (2003). All six targets were ob-\nserved with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph In-\ntegral Field Unit (GMOS IFU) on Gemini-North.

To interpret this field we correct for the magnifi-\ncation and distortion caused by the lensing potential using\nmodels of the cluster lenses. These models are constrained\nby the positions and redshifts of other spectroscopically con-\nfirmed gravitational arcs in each cluster. In a few cases, the\nIFU targets are themselves multiply imaged and the fold-\ning of the velocity field places additional constraints on the\ncluster potential. These lensing corrections allow us to re-\nconstruct the intrinsic (unlensed) properties of the galaxies\nat z=1, including their geometry.\nThe velocity field of systems displaying regular (bi-\nsymmetric) rotational velocity fields i.e. resembling rotat-\ning disks are reduced to traditional one-dimensional rota-\ntion curves. The terminal rotation velocity, indicative of the\ngalaxy mass, is then extracted. All of the targets have been\nimaged in the optical and near-infrared bands. The grav-\nitational lens models allow us to correct the photometric\nobservations for the amplification of the cluster and to es-\ntablish the intrinsic (unlensed) rest-frame B- and I-band\nluminosities of the galaxies. We can then compare the TF\nrelations for our target galaxies with local observations, and\nhence to test the models for the build-up of galaxy mass as\na function of look-back time.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we de-\nscribe the sample selection, observations and the data re-\nduction. In \u00a73 we analyse the data, including photometry,\ngravitational lens modeling and galaxy reconstruction. In \u00a74\nwe present the one-dimensional rotation curves and the TF\nrelation at z=1. Finally in In \u00a75 we discuss our results on\nthe TF relation at z=1 and the implications for galaxy evo-\nlution. We also outline the wider applicability of the grav-\nitational telescope method.

However, we did require that arcs were resolved\nResolved Spectroscopy of z=1 Giant Luminous Arcs 3\nFigure 1. Finding charts for the IFU observations.

This restricted\nour selection to galaxies with moderate magnification.\n2.2 Imaging\nNear-infrared imaging of Abell 2390 was obtained the Wide-\nfield Infrared Camera (WIRC; Wilson et al. 2003) on the\nHale 200\u2032\u2032 Telescope1. The J-band data were taken on 2004\nJune 30, totaling 12.8 ks. The K-band data were taken over\nfour observing runs between October 2003 and June 2004\nyielding a total integration time of 11.5 ks. All of these\ndata were taken when transparency was good, with the J-\nband conditions likely photometric. The seeing was typically\n<\n\u223c 0.85\n\u2032\u2032. The data were reduced using standard iraf2 proce-\ndures. Photometric calibration was achieved using 2MASS3\ndata on stars in the same fields. We also retrieved observa-\ntions of A 2390 from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pub-\nlic archive4. The Wide Field Planetry Camera 2 (WFPC2)\nobservations through the I814- and V555-band filters totalled\n10.5 and 8.4 ks respectively \u2013 the data were reduced using\nthe standard stsdas package in iraf. The final reduced data\nare shown as a colour image in (Fig. 1). A 2390 has also been\nobserved with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) as\npart of the Guaranteed Time Observations (GO: 9292, PI:\nFord). We concentrated solely on the z\u2032-band ACS data, re-\nducing the single orbit (2.2 ks), CR-split, undithered data\nusing multidrizzle with the default parameter set.\nGround-based optical imaging of Cl 2236-04 and\nRGB1745+398 (Fig. 1) is taken from Kneib et al. (1994)\nand Nilsson et al. (1999) respectively. These consist of B,R\nand B,V,R, I-band imaging of these clusters taken with\nthe New Technology Telescope (NTT) and Nordic Optical\nTelescope (NOT) respectively. We supplement these opti-\ncal data with near-infrared J- and K-band imaging of both\nclusters on the UK Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) between\n2004 August 15 and 2004 August 205. The observations were\nmade in photometric conditions and \u223c 0.7\u2032\u2032 seeing using\nthe UKIRT Imaging Spectrometer (UIST) imaging camera\n(Ramsay Howat et al. 1998) which employs a 1024 \u00d7 1024\nInSb detector at 0.12\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 to give a 2\u2032 field of view.\nThe observations were taken in a standard nine-point dither\npattern and reduced using the relevant orac-dr pipeline\n(Cavanagh et al. 2003).

To calibrate our data, we observed UKIRT\nfaint photometric standards (Hawarden et al. 2001). These\nstandards were observed at similar air masses and using the\nsame instrumental configuration as the target galaxies.\nThe most striking feature in the new near-infrared imag-\ning is the discovery of a red triply-imaged galaxy 4\u2032\u2032 to the\nSouth-East of the z=1.056 arc in RGB1745+398 (Fig. 1).\nThis arc is barely detected in the optical imaging, but is\nvery bright in the near-infrared (J = 18.27 \u00b1 0.06 and\nK = 16.32\u00b10.04) and an R\u2212K colour of 6.6\u00b10.2. The ob-\nvious triple image configuration, along with a spectroscopic\nredshift of this arc would provide a new constraint on the\nlens model of this cluster and therefore a more precise recon-\nstruction of the intrinsic properties of the blue arc targeted\nby the IFU observations (\u00a72.3). We describe ground-based\noptical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the red arc in \u00a72.4.\n2.3 Integral Field Spectroscopy\nTraditionally, observations are made with a two-dimensional\ndetector, sufficient for imaging programs. However, for spec-\ntroscopic measurements, one spatial dimension of the sky is\nusually lost in order to allow dispersion of the image across\none axis of the detector. Spectrograph\u2019s placing a long slit\nover the object lose spatial information orthogonal to the\nslit width. In order to faithfully investigate the properties\nof galaxies which are spatially extended, we require spec-\ntroscopic information over the whole of a two-dimensional\nfield. An instrument simultaneously producing both two-\ndimensional imaging data and a spectrum for each point\nin the image provides integral field spectroscopy.\nIntegral field spectroscopy thus allows spectra to be\nsimultaneously obtained for a number of contiguous areas\nacross a two-dimensional field. The spatially resolved spec-\ntroscopy allows the variation with positions of object spec-\ntra to be measured, and this information can be used, for\nexample, to determine the object\u2019s internal kinematics, or\nthe star formation rate within an object, providing insight\ninto its process of evolution. This technique is therefore cru-\ncial in order to investigate the internal properties of distant\ngalaxies.\nOur sample were observed in queue mode with the Gem-\nini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini-North6\nbetween 2003 June 8 and 2003 August 14 in photometric\nconditions and <\u223c0.7\n\u2032\u2032 seeing. Details of the observations and\nsource redshifts are listed in Table 1. The IFU uses a lensed\nfiber system to reformat the a contiguous 7.9\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5.3\u2032\u2032 field\n(comprising an array of 40\u00d726 hexagonal fibres each of 0.2\u2032\u2032\ndiameter) into two long slits (Allington-Smith et al. 2002).\nAll observations were made using an I-band filter in conjunc-\ntion with the R400 grating which results in two tiers of spec-\ntra covering the maximum field of view. The spectral resolu-\ntion of this configuration is \u03bb\/\u2206\u03bb = 2000. Each observation\nwas split into 2.4 ks sub-exposures and dithered by one IFU\nlenslet to account for bad pixels. The data was reduced in\niraf using the GMOS-IFU data reduction pipeline which\nextracts, flat-fields and wavelength calibrates the data.

We also improved the flattening of the data\nby using continuum regions either side of the emission lines.\nThis is achieved by identifying wavelength regions free from\nsky emission lines near the redshifted [Oii] line and averaging\nthe flux in these regions over 200A\u02da. For each fiber, this aver-\nage was divided into the fiber spectrum to improve the fiber-\nto-fiber response map. The output pixel scale is 1.3A\u02da pixel\nand the instrumental profile has a FWHM of 3.4A\u02da (mea-\nsured from the widths of the skylines).

In or-\nder to align and mosaic these two datacubes we constructed\n(wavelength-collapsed) white-light [Oii] emission line maps\nof the two arcs. This was achieved by identifying the central\nwavelength of the [Oii] emission in each galaxy and then\ncollapsing the data-cubes between -300 and +300 kms\u22121.\nThese were then compared and aligned using the HST I-\nband image as a reference to produce the final mosaiced\ndatacube.\nWe also note that the redshift of the arc in\nRGB1745+398 (z=1.056) places the [Oii] emission at\n7660A\u02da; close to the Fraunhofer A-band.

The spectrum is produced by rejecting pixels\ndominated by the strong night sky emission i.e. those regions\nabove the horizontal line in the lower spectrum which shows the\nnight sky spectrum (offset and scaled for clarity). The smoothed\nspectrum is produced by median filtering the raw spectrum with\na boxcar width of 100A\u02da and the error bars represent 1\u03c3 errors in\neach boxcar window. We identify the discontinuity in the spec-\ntral shape at \u03bb8440A\u02da as the 4000A\u02da break which yields a redshift\nof z=1.11 \u00b1 0.05. The blue line shows an Luminous Red Galaxy\n(LRG) galaxy template from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey red-\nshifted to z=1.11.\nand when this criterion is met, we fit the [Oii] emission line\ndoublet with a double Gaussian profile of fixed separation,\nallowing the normalization and central wavelength to vary.\nIf the line is detected at greater than 7\u03c3 significance, we also\nallow the line width to vary. The two lines of the doublet\nare assumed to have the same intensity and width. Whilst\nit is possible for the two emission lines of the [Oii] doublet\nto have different intensities (due to the density and tem-\nperature of the gas), at this spectral resolution and typical\nsignal-to-noise we view it as more reliable to fix the ratio\nof the intensities to unity (we note that in the collapsed\nspectrum from each galaxy there is no noticable difference\nbetween in the fluxes between the two peaks). To calculate\nthe error in the velocity we perturb the wavelength of the\nbest fit profile and allow the signal to drop by a \u03c72 of 9.\nThis corresponds to a formal 3\u03c3 error.\n2.4 Long Slit Spectroscopy\nIn the course of assembling the new and archival imaging\ndata required for this article we discovered a new triply-\nimaged red arc in RGB1745+398 (Fig. 1). We estimate the\nredshift of this arc using hyper-z (Bolzonella et al. 2000)\nand the photometry given in \u00a72.2, obtaining z = 1.1 \u00b1 0.2.\nWe attempted to measure a spectroscopic redshift for this\narc on 2005 February 22. We used the Cooled Grating Spec-\ntrograph 4 (CGS4) and UIST, both on UKIRT to explore\n1.0\u22121.2\u00b5m and 1.4\u22122.4\u00b5m respectively \u2013 the total integra-\ntion times for both of these observations was 1 hour. We de-\ntected continuum emission in these data, but no obvious line\nemission. We therefore also searched for spectral features at\nshorter wavelengths using the red arm of the Low Resolution\nImaging Spectrograph (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995) in long slit\nmode on the Keck I 10-m telescope7on 2005 March 05. The\n831\/8200 grating was oriented at 36\u25e6 to sample the wave-\nlength range \u223c0.75\u22120.9\u00b5m. A total integration time of 3.3 ks\nwas accumulated from three separate exposures with a 1\u2032\u2032\nwide slit. Flux calibration was achieved via observations of\nthe spectrophotometric standard G138-31 (Oke 1990). The\ndata were reduced using standard iraf tasks \u2013 the final re-\nduced 1-dimensional spectrum is shown in Fig. 6. Again, no\nstrong emission or absorption features were found, however\nthere is a continuum break at 8440A\u02da which we interpret as\nthe 4000A\u02da break redshifted to z = 1.11 \u00b1 0.05. The uncer-\ntainty on the redshift is estimated by comparing the data\nwith the mean spectrum of a luminous red galaxy from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey; (Fig. 6).\n3 DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELLING\n3.1 Photometry\nFrom our optical\/near-infrared imaging, we constrain the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy. Since the\narcs usually lie with a few arcs-seconds of nearby bright clus-\nter galaxies, we calculate the magnitude of the arcs in var-\nious pass-bands by masking the arc and interpolating the\nlight from the nearby cluster members. We then use the\niraf imsurfit package with the sky estimated from a 2nd\norder polynomial surface fit. This is subtracted from the\nregions around each galaxy to account for the halo light\nfrom the nearby cluster galaxies. We then use sextrac-\ntor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to estimate the residual back-\nground within the frame and extract the arc photometry us-\ning sextractor. We use the observed colours (at the known\nredshift) to infer the ratio of current to past star formation\nrate and use this to find the best fit SED. At z \u223c 1 the rest\nframe I-band luminosity is approximately equivalent to the\nobserved H-band and so is calculated from interpolating J\nand K photometry. We co-add the J,K images to obtain an\naperture which is used to extract the J+K magnitudes and\ninterpolate for the relevant SED type. We apply the same\ntechnique for the rest-frame B-band magnitude, (at z \u223c 1,\nR and I-bands are the closest match to rest-frame B-band)\nand estimate its uncertainty by computing the magnitude\nfor a variety of SED types which are consistent with the\nobserved optical colours.\n7 Obtained at the W.M.

We estimate the 1\u2013\u03c3 uncertainty in \u00b5 by perturbing the parameters of\nthe best fit lens model such that \u2206\u03c72 = 1 and for each model we recompute the magnification of the arc. The error corresponds to the\nlargest variation in magnification in the source plane photometry. The inclination of the galaxies are measured in the source-frame and\nthe associated error-bars are calculated by determining the inclination in each pass-band and for each of the lens models described above.\nThe rotation velocities (vrot) are corrected for inclination effects. The disk scale lengths are given for the reconstructed I and V -band\nimages as well as the distribution of [Oii] flux.\n3.2 Gravitational Lens Modelling and Galaxy\nReconstruction\nIn order to investigate the source-plane properties of the\nsources we must first correct for the distortion and magnifi-\ncation of the galaxy image by the cluster lens. Although this\ndoes not affect the sign or amplitude of the velocities, we\nmust determine accurately the gravitational magnification\nof each galaxy so that we can recover its intrinsic geome-\ntry and hence estimate the inclination angle. In this section\nwe describe briefly the construction of the cluster lens mod-\nels and their application to derive the intrinsic properties of\nthe galaxies at z=1. The lens modelling techniques are those\ndescribed in detail by Smith et al. (2005), originally devel-\noped by Kneib (1993), and further refined by Kneib et al.\n(1996) and Smith (2002). The primary constraints on the\nlens models are the positions and redshifts of spectroscopi-\ncally confirmed gravitational arcs in each cluster. The IFU\ndata (\u00a72.3) provide additional constraints because the com-\nponents of the observed arcs that are identified as being\nmultiple-images of the same region of the respective lensed\ngalaxies must, within the uncertainties, have the same ve-\nlocity and [Oii] line strength, in addition to the usual broad-\nband flux and colour constraints.\n3.2.1 A 2218\nArc #289 in A2218 was discussed in detail by\nSwinbank et al. (2003). Here we summarize the key\ndetails and use this arc to explain the methods applied to\nthe other arcs.\nA 2218 is one of the best constrained strong lensing clus-\nters, including three multiple-image systems that have been\nspectroscopically confirmed via their line emission. This\ncluster has been modeled on numerous occasions: Kneib et\nal. (1993; 1996; 2004); Ellis et al. (2001); Smith et al. (2005).\nWe use the most recent of these to calculate the luminos-\nity weighted magnification (\u00b5). This was achieved by ray-\ntracing between the image- and source-planes to build up a\nmap across the arc of how the observed flux relates to the in-\ntrinsic (unlensed) flux. The statistical error on \u00b5 was derived\nfrom the family of lens models which adequately reproduce\nthe multiply-imaged arcs. For each model we then recom-\npute the magnification of each arc. The error corresponds to\nthe largest variation in magnification that we found via this\nmethod. The luminosity weighted amplification for this arc\nis \u00b5=4.92+0.20\n\u22120.15 , which translates to a boost in magnitude of\n\u2206m = 1.7\u00b1 0.1.\nThe mapping between image- and source-plane co-\nordinates described above was also used to reconstruct the\nintrinsic morphology of Arc#289 from the flux map of the\narc after lensing correction, (see Fig. 3). The reconstruc-\ntion reveals that Arc#289 is a blue disk-galaxy with much\ninternal structure, resembling a late-type galaxy. This is es-\npecially prominent in the B-band which samples the rest-\nframe UV and is therefore dominated by the star-forming\nHii regions (Fig. 3). To measure the geometry of the disk\nwe fitted ellipses to an isophote in the reconstructed flux\nmaps using the idl gauss2dfit routine (and assume an in-\ntrinsically circular disk). The ellipticity is then e = 1\u2212 b\/a\n(where a and b are the major and minor axis of the ellipse)\nand the inclination, i, is cos i = b\/a. The average axis ratios\nof the ellipses from the various passband are translated into\ninclinations and the error bars on i are computed by apply-\ning the same procedure to each passband and each of the\nlens models described above. The inclination of the galaxy\nis found to be 64\u00b1 6\u25e6.\nWe use the intrinsic velocity field (constructed in a man-\n10 Swinbank et al.\nner similar to that applied to the broad-band imaging above)\nto infer the rotational velocity of the galaxy\u2019s disk. The\nterminal rotation velocity is 186 \u00b1 16 kms\u22121 (i.e. half the\nasymptotic velocity shift across the galaxy). Using the in-\nclination angle derived above, we therefore calculate a cor-\nrected rotation velocity of vrot=(206\u00b1 17) kms\n\u22121.\n3.2.2 A 2390\nA cluster lens model of A 2390 was originally developed by\nPello\u00b4 et al. (1999) who spectroscopically identified two z\u223c4\nmultiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster. The first (la-\nbelled H3 in Fig. 1) has a redshift of z = 4.04 and all three\nimages lie within 10\u2032\u2032 of the cluster galaxy to the West. The\nsecond lies at z = 4.05 (labelled H5-a and H5-b in Fig 1).\nHowever, the third image of this galaxy was not identified by\nPello\u00b4 et al. (1999) because it lies outside of the field of view\nof the HST\/WFPC2 observations available at that time.\nWe have used the larger field of view of the new ACS z\u2032-\nband data (\u00a72.2) to identify the third counter-image of H5 at\n\u03b1=21:53:36.64, \u03b4=+17:42:11.8 (J2000). These spectroscopi-\ncally confirmed multiple-image systems are used to constrain\nthe lens model of this cluster, including the generation of\na family of acceptable models as described in \u00a73.2.1. The\nz = 0.912 critical curve of the best-fit model is shown in\nFig. 1 \u2013 this curve defines where multiply-imaged galaxies\nat z=0.912 will appear in the observed (image) plane. In a\nsimple axi-symmetric system the gravitational magnification\nis infinite along critical curves. This is not the case in the\nperturbed gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster, never-\ntheless magnifications of \u223c10\u221220\u00d7 are routine (Table 2).\nA2390 arcA \u2013 This arc (the so-called \u201cstraight arc\u201d \u2013\nPello\u00b4 et al. 1999) is \u223c10\u2032\u2032 long, has a redshift of z = 0.912\nand lies approximately 40\u2032\u2032 to the West of brightest clus-\nter galaxy (BCG). Based solely on the broad-band imaging,\nthe arc may be multiply-imaged at its southern end, in-\ndeed the z=0.912 critical curve of the best-fit lens model\nis immediately adjacent to the southern portion of this arc\n(Figs. 1 & 3). However the acceptable models include several\nthat predict this arc to be strongly-sheared at its southern\nend rather than multiply-imaged. The velocity field derived\nfrom the GMOS observations supports the multiple-image\ninterpretation: the southern end of the galaxy (S0) has an\nobserved velocity (with respect to the center of the galaxy)\nof \u223c 150 kms\u22121 (Fig. 3). The relative velocity of components\nS1 and S2 also agree within 1\u03c3 with the velocity of S0. We\nconservatively include both multiple-image and strong-shear\ninterpretations when estimating uncertainties below.\nWe use the same methods as described in \u00a73.2.1 to re-\nconstruct the intrinsic properties of this arc, obtaining the\nlensing corrected morphology, [Oii] map and velocity map\nshown in Fig. 3. This galaxy therefore appears to have disk-\nlike kinematics, to be magnified by \u00b5=12.6+0.6\n\u22120.8, (\u2206m =\n2.75 \u00b1 0.07), and have an inclination angle of i=(69\u00b14)\u25e6.\nThe terminal velocity (uncorrected for inclination effects) is\n175 \u00b1 20 kms\u22121, which translates into a corrected rotation\nvelocity of vrot=(187\u00b117) km s\n\u22121.\nA2390arcB \u2013 The GMOS observations of A 2390arcA\nalso allowed us to study the [Oii] emission from a slightly\nhigher redshift (z=1.033) arc, located 2\u2032\u2032 to the South\nof A 2390arcA (Fig. 1 & 3). This galaxy has a com-\npact observed morphology (FWHM<\u223c1.5\n\u2032\u2032). We calculate a\nluminosity-weighted magnification of 18.0 \u00b1 1.0, (\u2206m =\n3.1 \u00b1 0.1) which yields a lensing corrected half-light ra-\ndius of just 2.5 kpc. There is no significant velocity gradient\nalong the major axis of the reconstructed galaxy (Fig. 3),\nhowever we extract the maximum velocity shear from the\ndata to derive an estimated a possible peak-to-peak ve-\nlocity of 60\u00b115 kms\u22121. Moreover, the [Oii] emission dou-\nblet is well resolved with a FWHM of <\u223c60 km s\n\u22121 (decon-\nvolved for instrumental resolution). These estimates place\nA2390arcB comfortably within the scatter of Hii regions\nin the velocity-width versus half light radius from lower\nredshift (z\u223c0.19\u22120.35) narrow-emission line galaxies from\nGuzman et al. (1996).\nA2390 arcD \u2013 This z=0.912 arc lies 19\u2032\u2032 away from\nA2390arcA, their similar redshift suggesting that A 2390\nmay be lensing a group of galaxies. The HST observations\nreveal an irregular morphology and the colours are consis-\ntent with either an evolved stellar population or a dusty-\nreddened star-burst. The strong and spatially resolved [Oii]\nemission revealed by our GMOS data appear to favor the lat-\nter interpretation, and reveal that the galaxy is not relaxed\n(Fig. 3). The mean velocity of the line emission suggests\npossible rotation about the major axis of the galaxy with\npeak-to-peak velocity of \u223c 500 km s\u22121. This is orthogonal\nto the direction of rotation suggested by the galaxy\u2019s mor-\nphology. Furthermore, the line profiles in the central region\nappear clearly broadened, having FWHM\u223c300 kms\u22121. This\nsuggests either (i) a merger between two galaxies, or (ii)\nshock heated, outflowing material from the central regions\nof the galaxy (powered by AGN activity). Our observations\nalso confirm that the (unresolved) bright knot (located 3\u2032\u2032\nto the south) is part of the same system, but show that it is\noffset by \u2243480\u00b160 kms\u22121 in velocity and has an [Oii] line\nwidth of 300\u00b1100 kms\u22121. The magnification of this source\nis \u00b5=6.7+0.4\n\u22120.2 (\u2206m = 2.0 \u00b1 0.1).\n3.2.3 Cl 2236-04\nThe blue z=1.116 arc in Cl 2236\u221204 (Melnick et al. 1993)\nlies between two bright elliptical galaxies (labelled A and\nB in Fig. 1). The arc is almost straight with a length of\n8\u2032\u2032, and was shown by Kneib et al. (1994) to not be part of\na multiple-image system including the blue source labelled\nC in Fig. 1, which is at z=1.334. Kneib et al. also identi-\nfied a velocity gradient along the z=1.116 arc using longslit\nspectroscopic data; but the lack of full two-dimensional data\nlead them to suggest that the arc comprises a pair of closely\ninteracting galaxies. The lack of both high resolution HST\nimaging and integral field spectroscopy of the arc made it\ndifficult for them to test the galaxy-galaxy merger hypothe-\nsis. With the full two-dimensional coverage our GMOS data\nare therefore a powerful tool in this regard because they al-\nlow us to decouple cleanly the spatial and spectral informa-\ntion that are mixed in long slit observations. Fig. 4 shows the\n[Oii] emission line intensity and velocity field of the arc. The\nvelocity field across the arc is seen to be smooth and regular,\nwith the eastern (receding) portion stretched by the grav-\nitational potential of the cluster. There is no obvious sign\nof a galaxy-galaxy merger in these data. The simplest inter-\npretation is therefore that the arc comprises a single disk-\nResolved Spectroscopy of z=1 Giant Luminous Arcs 11\nlike galaxy, the receding portion of which is either multiply-\nimaged or strongly-sheared by the gravitational potential of\nthe foreground cluster \u2013 i.e. a similar interpretation to that\nof arcA in A2390.\nWe construct a suite of nine models that are able to\nreproduce the observed arc morphology and velocity field.\nAll of the models contain mass components for galaxies A\n(the BCG) and B, plus a mass component for the central\ncluster dark matter halo centered on the BCG. Seven of the\nmodels have bi-modal dark matter distribution and contain\na dark matter halo centered on galaxy B. The models with a\nunimodal dark matter distribution (e.g. \u03c3DM,A=930 kms\n\u22121,\n\u03c3DM,B=0kms\n\u22121) shear the galaxy at z=1.116 sufficiently\nto reproduce a symmetric source-plane morphology with\nrespect to the position where the observed velocity field\nchanges sign. The more extreme of the bi-modal mod-\nels (e.g. \u03c3DM,A=750 kms\n\u22121, \u03c3DM,B=500 kms\n\u22121) multiply-\nimage the receding part of the galaxy, but do not have quite\nenough mass to multiply-image the approaching part of\nthe galaxy. The best fit lens model has \u03c3DM,A=875 kms\n\u22121,\n\u03c3DM,B=300 kms\n\u22121. The z=1.116 critical curve of the best-\nfit model is shown in Figs. 1 & 4. All nine models are used\nwhen estimating the uncertainties in the galaxy reconstruc-\ntion.\nFollowing the methods described in \u00a73.2.1, we use the\nsuite of models to obtain a mean luminosity weighted mag-\nnification of \u00b5=11.2+2.8\n\u22122.4 (\u2206m=2.6\u00b10.2) and a lensing cor-\nrected inclination of i=(45\u00b110)\u25e6. The observed velocity pro-\nfile shows a terminal velocity of 68\u00b115 km s\u22121 across the\ngalaxy which translates into an inclination corrected rota-\ntion velocity of vrot=98\n+30\n\u221226) km s\n\u22121.\n3.2.4 RGB1745+398\nRGB1745+398 is qualitatively similar to Cl 2236\u221204 as a\ngravitational lens in that a straight blue arc lies between the\nBCG and the second brightest cluster galaxy (Fig. 1). The\narc was first discovered by Nilsson et al. (1999) and spec-\ntroscopically confirmed to be at z=1.056. Our new GMOS\nIFU observations confirm that the bright source 1\u2032\u2032 to the\nNorth-West of the arc is a foreground cluster galaxy and is\nnot part of the arc.\nWe construct a suite of lens models to explore the\nbalance of mass between the dark matter halos centered\non galaxies A and B in a manner analogous to that de-\nscribed in \u00a73.2.3. The model parameters are constrained\nby the triply-imaged red arc discussed in \u00a72.4, and the\nrequirement to reproduce the observed morphology and\nvelocity field of the blue arc. The best-fit model has\n\u03c3DM,A=560 kms\n\u22121, \u03c3DM,B=400 km s\n\u22121, although formally\na very wide range of parameter space is allowed; the ex-\ntrema models have \u03c3DM,A=660 km s\n\u22121, \u03c3DM,B=90km s\n\u22121\nand \u03c3DM,A=0 kms\n\u22121, \u03c3DM,B=630 km s\n\u22121 respectively. We\nnote that \u03c3DM,A=0 kms\n\u22121 is somewhat unphysical, how-\never rather than invoke a prior we conservatively use the\nfull range of models allowed by the data alone. The critical\ncurve of the best-fit model is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe velocity map of this galaxy exhibits a strong ve-\nlocity gradient. The IFU only covered the central regions\nof the galaxy (as can be seen in Fig. 1) with some low sur-\nface brightness emission lying outside the field of view. How-\never, the velocity field (and rotation curve) is smooth and\ncharacteristic of a rotating system and gives a good indica-\ntion of the terminal rotation velocity, which we determine\nto be 90\u00b120 kms\u22121. Using the family of models allowed by\nthe data we derive a luminosity weighted magnification of\n\u00b5=14.8+4.4\n\u22126.6 (\u2206m=2.9\n+0.3\n\u22120.6), a lensing corrected inclination\nangle of i=(69\u00b14)\u25e6 and an inclination corrected rotation\nvelocity of vrot=103\n+25\n\u221223 kms\n\u22121.\n4 RESULTS\n4.1 One-Dimensional Rotation Curves\nHaving reconstructed the source frame morphologies and\nvelocity fields of the lensed galaxies, we can extract the\none-dimensional rotation curves in order to determine their\nasymptotic rotation speeds as well as more general issues\nsuch as how the rotation curve shapes compare with those\nin the local Universe. Our sample consists of six galaxies, the\nfive presented in this paper, plus A2218 arc#289 presented\nin Swinbank et al. (2003). In four of the lensed galaxies in\nour sample, A 2390arcA, A2218 arc#289, Cl 2236-04arc and\nRGB1745+398arc we identify and extract the major axis\nvelocity profiles to measure the asymptotic rotation speed.\nThis direction coincides with the maximum velocity gradi-\nent as we would expect in a rotating system. The other two\ngalaxies, A 2390arcB and A 2390arcD have velocity fields\nwhich are not aligned with the major axis. Although the ve-\nlocity field is not consistent with a simple rotating disk, we\nare still able to place limits on their masses using the veloc-\nity offsets between merging components (A2390arcD) and\nthe limits on velocity gradients\/line widths (A2390arcB).\nIn Fig. 7 we show the one dimensional rotation curves\nof the galaxies in our sample. These are extracted by sam-\npling the velocity field with a slit approximately 1.5 kpc wide\nalong the major axis cross section, as shown in the recon-\nstructed velocity fields of the galaxies (Figs. 2-6). The zero-\npoint in the velocity is defined using the center of the galaxy\nin the reconstructed source plane image. The error bars for\nthe velocities are derived from the formal 3\u03c3 uncertainty in\nthe velocity arising from Gaussian profile fits to the [Oii]\nemission in each averaged pixel of the datacube. We note\nthat in the one-dimensional rotation curves in Fig. 7 alter-\nnate points show independent data. We also note that the\ndata have not been folded about the zero velocity so that\nthe degree of symmetry can be assessed in these plots. Hor-\nizontal bars show the effect of seeing, transformed into the\nsource-plane. This illustrates how much the velocity field is\nsmoothed by the seeing, and how the smearing varies along\nthe arc.\n4.2 Comparison to Local Populations\nIn Fig 8 we show the Tully-Fisher relation for the\nhigh redshift galaxies as compared to previous measure-\nments of the TF in both low redshift (Pierce & Tully\n1992; Verheijen 2001; Mathewson et al. 1992) and high\nredshift (Vogt 1999) galaxy populations. Whilst Vogt\n(1999) and Mathewson et al. (1992) use optical spectra and\nPierce & Tully (1992) and Verheijen (2001) use Hi line\nwidths to measure the TF relation, as Mathewson et al.\n(1992) show, with high quality observations the rotation\n12 Swinbank et al.\nFigure 7. One-dimensional rotation curves from the galaxies in our sample. These are extracted from the two-dimensional source plane\nmajor axis cross section (and are not corrected for inclination effects). We also show the one-dimensional velocity fields for the two\ngalaxies which do not resemble relaxed systems: A 2390arcD and A2390arcB. We extract two one-dimensional velocity fields from these\ntwo galaxies: the first by collapsing the two-dimensional velocity field along the strongest velocity gradient (black) as well as the one-\ndimensional velocity gradient made by collapsing the two-dimensional velocity field along the major axis seen in the [Oii] emission line\nmap (grey). The solid bars represent 0.7\u2032\u2032 seeing (transformed to the source plane) of each galaxy.\ncurve velocity determinations and Hi line widths are tightly\ncorrelated. Indeed, the scatter between vopt and vHI is typi-\ncally less than 10 km s\u22121 over a range of 60<\u223cv<\u223c300 ( kms\n\u22121);\n(Fig. 5 of Mathewson et al. 1992) and therefore it is useful\nto include the local Hi sets in our analysis.\nThe four galaxies with well defined rotation curves are\nshown as solid points. As can be seen the points suggest\na good correlation between magnitude and rotations speed\nsimilar to that seen in the local Universe. By assuming the\nlocal slope of the TF from Tully & Pierce (2000) we measure\nan offset of MB=0.41\u00b10.34mag of brightening in the rest-\nframe B-band at fixed circular velocity and place a limit of\n<0.10mag of brightening in the rest-frame I-band. As we\ndiscuss below, the small offset in the I-band TF relation is\nconsistent with the evolution expected in heirachical galaxy\nformation models.\nIn order to plot the remaining two galaxies in Fig 8, we\nmust estimate their circular velocity indirectly. A 2390arcB\nappears to be a low-mass Hii region, and we place a limit\nof <\u223c60 kms\n\u22121 on any possible velocity gradient (this is also\ncomparable to the [Oii] emission line FWHM). Since we are\nnot able to constrain the inclination angle on this galaxy,\nwe place this galaxy on the TF relation assuming it is edge\non, but also include an error-bar which indicates a canonical\ninclination of 60\u25e6. In the case of A 2390arcD, the galaxy is\nwell resolved but does not show a coherent velocity field. In\nthis case, we estimate the rotation speed by assuming the\nvelocity gradient across the galaxy will eventually develop\ninto regular rotation (it is also possible that this velocity\noffsets may develop into a velocity dispersion in an elliptical\ngalaxy). The error-bars on the rotation of this galaxy then\nrepresent the uncertainty as to whether this galaxy is relaxed\nor merging, as well as an inclination correction assuming an\ninclination of 60\u25e6 (as above).\nThis procedure allows us to show that the position of\nthese point in the TF relation is reasonable given their opti-\ncal and near-infrared brightness, however, the uncertainties\nin these rotation speed estimates are clearly large. These two\ngalaxies should therefore be interpreted with caution. Nev-\nResolved Spectroscopy of z=1 Giant Luminous Arcs 13\nFigure 8. Left: The arcs from our survey on the Tully-Fisher relation in rest frame B-band compared to high redshift sample from Vogt\net al. (1999). For comparison we show the low redshift local fit from Tully & Pierce (2000). The solid points show the galaxies which\nhave regular (disk-like) kinematics, but we also indicate the two galaxies for which the dynamics are not well defines as open circles. The\nsolid triangle shows field galaxies (L451) at z = 1.34 from van Dokkum & Stanford (2001). Right: The rest frame I-band Tully-Fisher\nrelation compiled from Mathewson, Ford & Buchhorn (1992) (solid points) and from the Ursa-Major Cluster (open circles; Verheijen\n2001).\nertheless, if these two galaxies are included in the analysis\nwe derive an offset of \u2206MB=0.51\u00b10.28 and \u2206MI <0.10.\nA key gain from studying lensed galaxies is the level\nof detail which we can extract from their rotation curves.\nFor the four galaxies with well defined rotation curves, we\ncan also compare the shapes of the rotation curves with\nthose of local (z<\u223c0.03) late-type spiral galaxies by Courteau\n(1997). This sample is dominated by late-type (Sb-Sc) spi-\nrals and therefore should provide a reasonable comparison\nsample. We fit the observed source-plane 1-D rotation curves\nin our sample with the arctan and multi-fit parameter\nmodels from Courteau (1997). Using a \u03c72 method the ob-\nserved rotation curves are best fit with models with high\nvalues of \u03b3 and rt\/ropt; (see Fig. 9). In this formalism, \u03b3\ngoverns the degree of sharpness of the turn over of the\nrotation curve, rt describes the transition radius between\nthe rising and flattening of the curve and ropt is the ra-\ndius enclosing 83% of the light in the source plane pho-\ntometry. We note that the rotation curve from the arc in\nRGB1745+398 is uncertain because the IFU field of view\nonly just reaches the turn over, however, the data is suffi-\ncient to place a lower limit on rt\/ropt and \u03b3. Such models in-\ndicate slowly rising rotation curves and usually favor fainter\n(or low-surface brightness) galaxies, yet the source frame\nsurface brightnesses of the four galaxies are consistent with\nhigh surface brightness (HSB) galaxies (\u00b5b,o=21.5, 21.2, 20.6\nand 21.0 for A2390arcA, Cl2236-04arc, A 2218 arc#289 and\nRGB1745+398arc respectively). In order to investigate how\nsensitive the shape of the rotation curve is to the seeing\nwe perform two checks: firstly, we convolve the rotation\ncurve with a further 0.7\u2032\u2032 seeing (transformed to the source\nplane; Fig. 7) and refit the rotation curve. Whilst the results\nvary between the galaxy rotation curves, the overall effect is\nonly modest at best. Typically, we find that the inner rota-\ntion curve flattens the transition radius by \u2206rt\/\u2206ropt=0.05\u2013\n0.08, and \u2206rt\/\u2206ropt=0.05\u20130.09, and \u03b3=0.18 in the arctan\nand multi-parameter fits respectively. Secondly, we gener-\nate mock rotation curves for both the arctan and multi-\nparameter fits with low values of rt and \u03b3 and convolve\nthese with 0.7\u2032\u2032 seeing. For the values of rt\/ropt and \u03b3 in\nthe rotation curves in our data, we find that they could\nbe affected by upto \u2206rt\/ropt =0.06 (arctan), \u2206rt\/ropt =0.5\n(multi-param) and \u2206\u03b3 =0.09. In Fig 9 we therefore show ar-\nrow which shows the maximum effect which the seeing could\nhave on the measured shapes of the rotation curves. Whilst\nthis contributes to the shape parameters we find that in the\nlocal galaxy population, only about 25% of galaxies have\nsimilarly shaped rotation curves. This could be an indica-\ntion that the inner parts of the galaxy mass distribution are\nless baryonically dominated than in local spirals and could\nbe an indication that the bulge-to-disk mass ratio of these\nhigh redshift galaxies are lower than those of most present\nday galaxies.\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study we have mapped the two dimensional veloc-\nity fields of six z \u223c 1 gravitationally lensed galaxies using\nIFU spectroscopy. Using detailed mass models for the clus-\nters we have reconstructed the source morphologies of these\ngalaxies. The typical boost in magnitude for these galaxies is\n14 Swinbank et al.\nFigure 9. The distribution of rt\/ropt against \u03b3 for the arcs with\nwell defined rotation curves in our sample as compared to local\n(z <\u223c0.03) spiral galaxies by Courteau et al. (1997). The arrow in\nthe lower right hand corner shows the maximum affect the seeing\nFWHM can have on the shape parameters. The rotation curve\nfrom the arc in RGB1745+398 is uncertain because the IFU field\nof view only just reaches the turn over and we therefore place\nlower limits on on rt\/ropt and \u03b3 for this galaxy. The z=1 galax-\nies in our sample have source-frame brightnesses consistent with\nHSB galaxies, yet the rotation curve shapes are more consistent\nwith low-surface brightness galaxies in the local Universe: if the\nmaximum effect the seeing can have on the shape parameters is\ntaken into account, then only about 25% of local HSB galaxies\nhave similarly shaped rotation curves.\n\u2206m = 2, which means the typical (unlensed) R-band magni-\ntude of our sample of mR >\u223c 22. Moreover, the gain in spatial\nmagnification for a typical galaxy in this paper means that\n0.6\u2032\u2032 on the sky corresponds to only \u223c0.5 kpc in the source\nframe which allows us to spatially resolve the dynamics of\nthese galaxies on much smaller scales than otherwise possi-\nble. Our IFU spectroscopy of these distant galaxies allows\nus to test whether these high redshift galaxies have regular\ndisk-like kinematics, or whether velocity offsets come from\nmerging components or other dynamical disturbance.\nWith a small sample of high redshift galaxies which\nshow bi-symmetric (disk-like) kinematics we can measure\nthe evolution of the offset in the TF relation under the as-\nsumption that the slope remains fixed. In Fig. 8, we com-\npare the rotation velocities and source brightness of the arcs\nwhich resemble galaxy disks with that of local and other high\nredshift galaxies in rest frame B and I-bands. We also in-\nclude the A 2390arcB and A2390arcD in this plot. Whilst\nthese two galaxies do not resemble rotating disks and there-\nfore cannot be compared directly to local disks, we show\nthe likely range of equivalent circular velocities based on\nthe upper limit to the velocity dispersion (A2390arcB) and\nassuming that the two components are on a merging orbit\n(A 2390arcD). These data points are of course highly un-\ncertain, not least because we have no way to estimate their\ninclinations on the sky.\nWhilst previous high redshift studies have concentrated\non the rest-frame B-band, rest-frame I-band observations\nprovide a more rigorous test of evolution of the TF rela-\ntion since the corrections for dust and on-going star forma-\ntion are much smaller at longer wavelengths (Conselice et al.\n2005). The rest frame I-band TF therefore gives a clearer\nindication of the true stellar luminosity and hence the ra-\ntio of stellar mass to total halo mass. The position of the\ngalaxies on the TF relation in both the B and I-bands\nshows good agreement with local data (Pierce & Tully\n1992; Mathewson et al. 1992; Haynes et al. 1999; Verheijen\n2001). This data is in agreement with existing intermedi-\nate and high redshift studies, (Vogt et al. 1997; Vogt 1999;\nVogt et al. 2002; Ziegler et al. 2002; Milvang-Jensen et al.\n2003; Barden et al. 2003; Bo\u00a8hm et al. 2003; Bamford et al.\n2005; Conselice et al. 2005). Overall, our observations sug-\ngest a 0.5\u00b10.3mag of brightening in the B-band TF from\nthe local (z = 0) correlation, whilst in the I-band we place\na limit of < 0.10mag between our z = 1 sample and the local\nz = 0 correlation.\nThe theoretical evolution of the I-band TF rela-\ntion from hierarchical models of galaxy formation from\nCole et al. (2000) predict that for any given disk circular\nvelocity, the I band luminosity should decrease by \u223c 0.1\nmagnitudes from z = 0 to z = 1, whilst in the B-band such\nmodels predict an increase in luminosity of \u223c 0.5 magni-\ntude for the same redshift change. It is useful to compare\nthis prediction with the prediction for a simple \u201cclassical\u201d\ngalaxy formation. We consider a model in which all of the\ngalaxy\u2019s mass were already in place at z = 1, but only half of\nthe stars have yet formed (Eggen et al. 1962; Hopkins et al.\n2000). This toy model produces an evolution in luminosity\nof \u223c 0.7 magnitudes from z = 0 to z = 1, during which the\nasymptotic circular velocity remains constant. The small off-\nset of our galaxies from the local I-band TF relation suggests\na preference for hierarchical rather than the \u201cclassical\u201d for-\nmation model. Furthermore, the 0.51\u00b10.28 magnitude evo-\nlution in the rest-frame B-band is in line with the increased\nstar formation activity at z = 1 suggested by studies of the\nB-band luminosity function (Giallongo et al. 2005).\nClearly, it would be dangerous to draw far reaching\nconclusions from a small number of high-redshift galaxies.\nRather this study should be view as a companion to stud-\nies of a larger samples of field galaxies (e.g. Flores et al.\n2004). The advantage of our lensed study is that we are able\nto resolve rotation curves in detail and clearly identify the\nasymptotic velocity of the rotation curve rather than fitting\na model rotation curve (based on local galaxies) convolved\nwith ground based seeing. In contrast to many ground based\nstudies our rotation measurements extend to large radii al-\nlowing asymptotic velocities to be directly measured.\nThe present sample is just large enough to place con-\nstraints on the evolution of the TF relation, but a signifi-\ncantly larger sample of galaxies are accessible to observation\nusing the gravitational telescope technique we have illus-\ntrated (there are currently a further >\u223c10 highly magnified\nand spatially resolved z\u223c1 giant arcs in the literature which\nare suitable for this study; Sand et al. 2005).\nHowever, the principle gain from studying distant galax-\nies using gravitational telescopes is to study the internal\nproperties of the galaxies in detail. In principle, the boost\nfrom gravitational lensing allows us to achieve an angular\nresolution to galaxies observed with classical techniques at\nResolved Spectroscopy of z=1 Giant Luminous Arcs 15\nz \u223c0.1 (e.g. for a typical z \u223c1 gravitationally lensed galaxy\nin this sample, the spatial sampling of a galaxy is a factor\nof three smaller than unlensed galaxies at the same redshift;\nby contrast this spatial sampling is matched to unlensed\ngalaxies at z \u223c0.15). This increase in resolution allows us\nto study the dynamics, metal abundance and star formation\nof z \u223c1 galaxies in detail and hence address why the global\nproperties of distant galaxies differ from their local counter\nparts.\nIn this paper, we restrict our attention to the dynamics\nof the target systems. For those galaxies with well defined\nrotation curves we can use the gravitational magnification\nto compare the shapes of the rotation curves with those of\nlocal (z<\u223c0.03) spiral galaxies observed by Courteau (1997).\nWe fit the observed source-plane 1-D rotation curve with\nthe arctan and multi-fit parameter models from Courteau\n(1997). Using a \u03c72 fit the observed rotation curves are best\nfit with models with high values of \u03b3 and rt\/ropt. The fits\nfrom these models show that the high redshift targets have\nslowly rising rising rotation curves compared to typical lo-\ncal galaxies. In the local Universe, such rotation curves are\nassociated with fainter, low-surface brightness galaxies, yet\nthe source frame surface brightnesses of the four galaxies\nare consistent with high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies.\nIn the local galaxy population, only about 25% of galaxies\nhave similarly shaped rotation curves and could be an indi-\ncation that the bulge masses of these high redshift galaxies\nis somewhat lower than those at the present day.\nThe dynamics of two of the galaxies in our sample\ndo not resemble galaxy disks. The first, A 2390arcB ap-\npears to be a highly magnified Hii galaxy, with a veloc-\nity dispersion of \u223c 60 kms\u22121 and a (source frame) ra-\ndius of \u223c2.5 kpc (FWHM). The other galaxy in our sam-\nple which does not appear to have stable disk kinematics is\nA 2390arcD. This galaxy has a disturbed morphology and\nappears to have several components. When combined with\nthe velocity field from the [Oii] emission, we find some evi-\ndence for rotation or interaction. The large [Oii] line widths\n(>\u223c 300 kms\n\u22121 FWHM) may originate from either outflowing\nmaterial driven by AGN activity, or as a result of two in-\nteracting galaxies. This second scenario is supported by the\nfact that we also identify a bright knot, or companion offset\nby 5 kpc and 480\u00b160 kms\u22121 in projection; the most likely\ninterpretation of the system is that this galaxy has recently\nundergone a tidal interaction\/merger which has produced\nthe disturbed and complex morphology. The selection cri-\nteria for our analysis was simply that the galaxies must be\nhighly amplified, and therefore it is interesting to note that\nalthough we only have a small sample, of the six galaxies\nwe have studied, two do not have disk-like kinematics or\nmorphologies, giving some indication as to the mix of stable\ndisk-like galaxies to currently assembling galaxies at z \u223c1.\nThe next step in this study is to complement these ob-\nservations with similar observations in the near-infrared. At\nz \u223c1, H\u03b2, [Oiii] and H\u03b1 are redshifted to beyond 1\u00b5m and\nuntil recently have been inaccessible to Integral Field Spec-\ntroscopy (IFS). However, recent developments in designing\nefficient image slicing IFU\u2019s allow us to probe beyond 1\u00b5m,\nand therefore we can combine the rest-frame optical emission\nlines to probe the distribution of reddening through the well\nstudied R23 index; R23=([Oii]+[Oiii])\/H\u03b2 (Zaritsky et al.\n1994), as well as the reddening corrected star formation rates\nthrough the H\u03b1:H\u03b2 decrement. For those galaxies which we\nhave identified as disk-like at z \u223c1, such observations will\ngive unique insight into the processes of disk galaxy forma-\ntion, and give important constraints on the assembly on the\ndisks of present day galaxies.\nThe gain in spatial resolution which we have achieved\nby using a gravitational lens to magnify and stretch distant\ngalaxies demonstrates the science that will soon be possible\nwith Adaptive Optics Integral Field Spectroscopy (AO-IFS)\non (non-lensed) galaxies at z = 1 (e.g. OSIRIS on Keck,\nNIFS on Gemini and SINFONI on the VLT). These stud-\nies will probe the structure of young galaxies on 100milli-\narcsecond (mas) scales, although long exposures will be\nrequired to compensate for the lack of lensing amplifica-\ntion. For a non-lensed source at z = 1, this corresponds\nto 600pc. However, the greatest gains will come from com-\nbining AO-IFS with the powerful gravitational lensing tech-\nnique. For a lensed galaxy with magnification factor of ten\nin flux (a factor of three in linear scale), the effective diffrac-\ntion limit of the telescope is reduced by a factor three and\n100mas corresponds to only 200pc in the source frame of the\ngalaxy, sufficient to resolve the star-formation, kinematic\nand chemical properties of individual Hii regions (which\ntypically have sizes less than 400pc in local spiral galax-\nies; Gonzalez Delgado & Perez 1997). We look forward to\nundertaking these studies in the coming years.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are very grateful to the anonymous referee for provid-\ning a number of suggestions which significantly improved\nthe content, layout and clarity of this paper.
