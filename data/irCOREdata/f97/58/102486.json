Further, SWCNTs have been synthesized at low temperature (down to room temperature), where their nucleation cannot\nbe explained via fullerene nucleation. The data point to a nucleation mechanism previously not identified, that places a stable oxidized ring\nas the root cause for the growth of SWCNTs.\nThe impact of nanomaterials is already significant and will\ncertainly have a much greater impact in the future. The\nidentification of SWCNTs1 can certainly be considered as\none of the most significant stimulants for research into\nnanostructures. This is due to their remarkable electronic and\nmechanical properties.2 In turn, this has led to a strong\ndemand of SWCNTs for research and commercial applica-\ntions. Yet, one of the grand challenges associated with\nSWCNTs is to obtain a clear understanding of their growth,\nwhich in turn will allow one to synthesize or isolate\nSWCNTs of a particular electronic form (semiconducting\nor metallic) and of the required diameter and chirality.\nNonetheless, great strides have been made in their production\nover the past decade, and new and exciting findings continue\nto arise. A recent and notable example is (ref 3) where a\nvery high yield (99.98%) of SWCNTs was reported using\nwater vapor in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and this\nwork is clearly a major step forward for SWCNT production.\nIt is argued that O2 selectively burns away amorphous carbon.\nAside from CVD, arc discharge and laser ablation remain\nthe two major synthesis routes for SWCNT production. The\nstrength of laser ablation is that it produces high yield and\nhigh quality SWCNTs.4 The available catalysts for laser\nablated SWCNT production, until now, have been limited\nto the requirement of at least one of a select few transition\nmetals5 (Co, Ni, Rh, Pt) being present in the reaction. These\nrequire a relatively high synthesis temperature. In addition,\na recent number of investigations into nanotube nucleation\nand growth mechanisms point to a dominant role played by\nfullerenes limiting the lower temperature synthesis limits.\nAn external supply of fullerenes lowers this limit6 to\ntemperatures below 600 \u00b0C. So-called low-temperature\nSWCNTs have also been formed using continuous wave CO2\nlasers (e.g., refs 7 and 8) or solar furnaces (e.g., ref 9) since\nno additional heating is required as is usual in pulsed laser\nablation systems. However, in these cases the required heat\nfor SWCNT synthesis and fullerene production is provided\nby the laser or the sun and so differ from low-temperature\nSWCNT reactions using a standard pulsed laser ablation\nsystem, as we report in this letter. Low-temperature SWCNT\nsynthesis is attractive, as it would allow their synthesis to\nbe compatible with microelectronics (below 400-500 \u00b0C)\nor biomolecular electronics (60-100 \u00b0C). The select metals\navailable for laser evaporation SWCNT synthesis can be\n* Corresponding author.

Indeed, our initial studies began by\nadmixing metal oxides with a more standard Co-Ni binary\ncatalyst. The results showed unique processes that, on closer\ninspection, suggested two growth mechanisms were present.\nRegardless of the synthesis technique, it has been shown that\nSWCNT growth proceeds from condensed catalyst nano-\nparticles. If a single mechanism is responsible for SWCNT\nnucleation is not clear, and other studies indicate that\nSWCNT growth can be placed in one of two categories;\ncapped growth and circumference growth (see ref 5 and\nreferences therein). Our study clearly suggests a capped\ngrowth variation, which may also be relevant to other growth\nsystems. The capped growth variation has not previously\nbeen reported and does not require fullerenes for the initial\nnucleation of SWCNTs. We call the nucleation process\n\u201cnucleation via etched carbon shells (NECS)\u201d. In addition,\nthis mechanism has the potential for the controlled formation\nof SWCNTs of a select diameter and chirality. We show,\nfor the first time, that metal oxides can be used for SWCNT\nsynthesis, providing a larger operating temperature range for\nSWCNT production in laser ablation, which has applicability\nin many other growth techniques\/processes too.\nThe SWCNTs were synthesized using a furnace-based\npulsed laser evaporation method. The setup is very similar\nto that described in refs 5 and 12, with the only difference\nbeing that in this case the outer and inner (to restrict the\nreaction volume) tubes are made from alumina since the oven\ncan reach temperatures as high as 1600 \u00b0C. In the present\nstudy, temperatures between 1200 \u00b0C and room temperature\nwere used for the synthesis of the SWCNTs. A Q-switched\nhigh power Nd:YAG laser (2.5 GW per pulse, pulse width\n) 8 ns) was used to evaporate catalyst containing graphite\ntargets using very high purity materials. Table 1 lists the\ntargets used. The evaporated products were then swept away\nby the carrier gas (nitrogen) to a water-cooled copper\ncoldfinger behind the target, which provides a well-defined\nreaction point. Pressures of 1 bar and a gas flow rate of 0.4\nl\/min were used for all experimental conditions discussed\nin this letter. Optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) mea-\nsurements were conducted with the product dispersed in\nacetone in an ultrasonic bath and dropped onto a KBr single-\ncrystal, giving a thin homogeneous film. A Bruker IFS\n113V\/88 spectrometer was used to obtain the optical absorp-\ntion spectrum in the energy range 0.35 eV to 2.35 eV, with\na spectral resolution of 0.25 meV. For transmission electron\nmicroscopy, these films were floated off the KBr crystal, in\nwater, and collected on standard Cu TEM grids (TEM, FEI\nTecnai F30). Raman measurements were performed on a\nBruker Fourier transform Raman spectrometer with a resolu-\ntion of 2 cm-1. In addition, Raman measurements were\nrecorded using a T-64000 spectrometer with a Kr+ laser at\n1.91 eV (Innova 300 series, Coherent).\nTable 1 contains information on the targets used and the\nresultant products. During studies on InC nanostructures\nwe found that the inclusion of In and In2O3 to the binary\nNi-Co catalysts in a laser evaporation target yielded different\nmean diameters and diameter distributions when compared\nto SWCNTs produced by an ablation target containing only\nthe binary catalyst of Ni\/Co under the same conditions. OAS\nstudies revealed that samples with In and In2O3 added to\nthe binary Ni\/Co catalyst the SWCNT diameter distribution\nand mean diameter increased. OAS is now a well-established\nmeans to determine the mean diameter and diameter distribu-\ntion of SWCNTs.5,13 The absorption intensity from SWCNTs\nis dominated by transitions between symmetrical pairs of\nvan Hove singularities (vHS) in the SWCNT density of states\n(DOS). Usually three absorption peaks are observed. The\nfirst two correspond to the first two transitions between vHS\nfrom semiconducting SWCNTs, which we identify here as\nthe S11 and S22 peaks, while the third peak corresponds to\nthe first vHS transition in metallic SWCNT, the M11 peak.\nOAS studies show that samples with In and In2O3 added to\nthe binary Ni\/Co (sample B) catalyst has a larger diameter\ndistribution and larger mean diameters when compared to\nthe reference sample with only the binary Ni\/Co catalyst\n(sample A). Previous studies13 showed that a correction factor\nshould be used due to excitonic effects when determining\nthe mean diameter from the S11 peak. According to this study,\nwe use the following equation to determine the mean\ndiameter from the S11 peak:\nTable 1.

Double mean diameters in square brackets\ncorrespond to values from bimodal diameter distributions.\n1210 Nano Lett., Vol. 5, No. 7, 2005\nwhere X (0.07 meV) is the correction factor, ao (1.407 \u00c5) is\nthe C-C bond length, and \u00e7o (3 eV) is the overlap integral.\nThis yielded a mean diameter for sample A of 1.2 and 1.6\nnm for sample B. Further studies showed that by increasing\nthe distance between the target and the coldfinger, where\nthe produced soot is collected, even larger diameters are\nobtained. In addition, now a bimodal S11 peak is observed,\ncorresponding to two diameter distributions and that the\nhigher energy peak remains close to 1.2 nm. This is a hint\nthat two growth mechanisms are in operation. The stationary\nhigher energy (first) peak can be attributed to the standard\ngrowth mode from Ni\/Co. The second growth mechanism\nis discussed later.\nThe observed bimodal S11 peak could also be found by\nincluding Fe2O3 in the ablation target (sample C) instead of\nIn\/In2O3. However, with Fe2O3, the secondary S11 peak occurs\nat higher energies when compared to equivalent conditions.\nAn example of the split structure of the S11 peak is shown\nin Figure 1. This suggests that SWCNT growth can be\nobtained from metal oxides and that the secondary growth\nmechanism may be related to the carbon-metal eutectics of\nthe metal (oxide) used. In addition to OAS, Raman scattering\ncan yield information on the diameter from the total\nsymmetric radial breathing mode (RBM) in the low fre-\nquency region. The obtained RBM modes can show the\npresence of SWCNTs and double-walled carbon nanotubes\n(DWCNTs). But caution must be observed as only limited\nlaser energies are used. There is a linear relation between\nRBM frequency and inverse diameter VRBM ) C1\/d + C2.\nWhere C1 describes the RBM frequency of an individual free-\nstanding nanotube and C2 takes in to account the interaction\nwith the local environment. In this case we used values of\n234 and 13 cm-1 for C1 and C2, respectively.14 However,\nthe use of Raman spectroscopy is more complicated as\ncompared to OAS for the determination of the mean\ndiameter, the diameter distribution, and yield of a sample.13\nThe observed RBM modes for samples A, B, and C correlate\nwell with the OAS spectra, viz. the relative intensities of\nthe RBM modes for larger diameters are relatively stronger\nfor samples including metal oxides (B, C) when compared\nto the reference sample (A). In addition, samples B and C\nshow the presence of RBM modes between 260 and 300\ncm-1, which could be due to an increase in the narrow\ndiameter SWCNT or in the establishment of DWCNTs. TEM\nanalysis of these samples showed the presence of both large\nand narrow diameter SWCNTs in agreement with the OAS\nand Raman studies.\nWe observed that with reducing temperatures for a given\nsample (B and C), the mean diameter as determined from\nthe secondary mode of the S11 peak (lower energy mode)\nwas reduced. The first mode (higher energy) always remained\nclose to 1.2 nm and so is attributed to the standard SWCNT\ngrowth from Ni\/Co. Further reducing the temperature to 600\n\u00b0C, where no SWCNTs are observed (due to the lack of\nfullerene production) from a pure Ni\/Co catalyst, we did\nobserve SWCNTs when using a target with In\/In2O3 added\n(sample D). In this case only a single S11 peak is observed.\nThe corresponding OAS spectrum is shown in Figure 1. The\nS11 position corresponds to a mean diameter of 1.8 nm and\nis a far higher diameter than that obtained from pure Ni\/Co\ntargets, concomitant with the observed RBM modes in\nRaman spectroscopy. This shows, for the first time, that the\naddition of a metal oxide to a standard catalyst (Co, Ni, Rh,\nor Pt) can yield SWCNTs at lower temperatures than required\nwithout the presence of a metal oxide. It also highlights an\nadditional or altered growth mechanism as suggested by the\nresults at higher temperatures. Furthermore, it strongly\nsuggests a SWCNT growth mode that can be active without\nfullerenes.\nTo better understand the growth mechanism for the larger\ndiameter SWCNTs, we examine first the effect of oxygen\nwhen synthesizing SWCNT using the reference target\n(sample A) at 1200 \u00b0C. This was done by feeding small\nquantities of oxygen gas mixed with the carrier gas during\nablation (up to 5%). To our surprise, despite oxygen levels\nclose to that found in air, we still successfully synthesized\nSWCNTs, and this shows that oxidizing conditions do not\nautomatically suppress SWCNT formation. The correspond-\ning OAS and RBM modes from Raman data showed\nnegligible changes in the mean diameter of the produced\nSWCNT. This shows that the SWCNT secondary growth\nmode (when metal oxides are present) is not a function of\nsome oxygen-modified carbon precursors for SWCNT\nsynthesis. Further, an ablation target (sample E) was prepared\nwith only In added to Ni\/Co and was then ablated at 1200\n\u00b0C in oxygen-free conditions. The resultant soot showed no\nSWCNTs when analyzed in OAS or Raman spectroscopy,\nand TEM studies showed only multiwalled carbon nanotubes\n(MWCNTs) present. This shows that oxygen alters the\ncarbon precipitation process in metals during the laser\nablation reaction. Furthermore, the dilution of the oxide level\nby adding, for example In to In2O3, still yielding SWCNTs,\nshows that only very small quantities of O2 need to be present\nto prevent MWCNT growth and allow SWCNT growth, and\nthis suggests that the growth is not so much due to a metal\nFigure 1.

We measured various samples produced\nat 1200 \u00b0C from targets containing only Fe\/Fe2O3 or In\/In2O3\n(samples F, G respectively) and found no signal correspond-\ning to SWCNTs in the OAS. Raman spectroscopy, which is\nfar more sensitive to the presence of SWCNTs as compared\nto OAS, showed the presence of a very narrow diameter\nSWCNTs. Their RBM modes correspond to diameters in the\nrange 0.8 to 1.0 nm. Such narrow SWCNTs can be attributed\nto nucleation from fullerenes6,15,16 or the presence of DWCNTs.\nThe presence of only narrow-diameter SWCNTs would\nsuggest that an alternative mechanism nucleates the larger\ndiameter SWCNTs. TEM studies showed that the catalyst\nparticles from the combined metal oxide and Ni\/Co ablated\nsamples were far too large (3 to 50 nm) to explain the\nSWCNT growth via circumference growth, as can be found\nin CVD,17 and indicates that the presence of Ni\/Co plays a\nrole in the large diameter SWCNT formation when including\nmetal oxides at a temperature of 1200 \u00b0C. Energy-dispersive\nX-ray (EDX) analysis shows that the catalyst particles are\nprimarily composed of a single metal with only trace\nquantities of other metal species, oxygen\/impurities. This\nwould suggest that O2 is reduced in the reaction, probably\nby C. In addition, this suggests that the growth temperature\nis closer to the carbon-metal eutectic than the carbon-\nmetal-oxide eutectic. Assuming the metal-carbon eutectic\nis connected to the first stable melt and therefore the upper\nSWCNT formation limit,12,16 we tried using temperatures so\nlow that a first possible melt should (to the best of our\nknowledge) be present at somewhat higher temperatures.\nThus, we attempted synthesizing SWCNTs using only MgO\nat 500 \u00b0C (MgO melts at 2830 \u00b0C and Mg melts at 650 \u00b0C).\nThe resultant sample showed the presence of SWCNTs as\nconfirmed by Raman studies, OAS, and TEM (see Figures\n2 and 3). The OAS spectrum showed a mean diameter of\n1.4 nm. Indeed, using MgO as a catalyst, we obtained\nSWCNTs over the three reaction temperatures used (500,\n650, and 750 \u00b0C). As the reaction temperature increased,\nthe mean diameter increased linearly. The diameter distribu-\ntion did not change with temperature and the diameter dis-\ntributions are larger than those obtained with a Ni\/Co catalyst\n(cf. sample A). TEM studies showed the presence of\nSWCNTs, amorphous carbon species, and catalyst particles,\nalong with the presence of some MWCNTs. We also tried\nsynthesizing SWCNTs using only PbO2 and In2O3 at room\ntemperature (PbO2 melts at 290 \u00b0C and decomposes to Pb3O4,\nwhich melts at 830 \u00b0C, In2O3 melts at 1913 \u00b0C, Pb and In\nmelt at 327 \u00b0C and 156 \u00b0C, respectively). OAS and Raman\nstudies showed the presence of SWCNTs for both samples\n(e.g., Figure 2), and TEM studies confirmed the presence of\nSWCNTs as shown in Figure 3. In the case of PbO2, so-\ncalled bamboo-MWCNTs18,19 were also observed, while with\nthe In2O3 sample, no MWCNTs were observed. In addition\nto the use of the metal oxide catalysts at room temperature\nwe repeated the laser ablation experiment with a target\ncontaining only pure indium (sample K). No SWCNT\nsignatures were obtained in OAS studies of the sample.\nHowever, Raman studies did show RBM corresponding to\nSWCNTs and TEM studies confirmed the presence of\nSWCNTs. The presence of SWCNTs when using pure In as\na catalyst at room-temperature we attribute to air trapped in\nthe target. Since the target is not at high temperature, any O\ntrapped in the target is not reduced and thus O will be present\nduring the laser ablation reaction. To reduce the O content\nin the target we annealed the target at 400 \u00b0C for 30 min in\nargon prior to ablation. TEM studies showed that while some\nSWCNTs were still present (due to remaining O), in addition,\nnow MWCNTs were also present supporting the high-\ntemperature results where there is an interplay between the\nO content and the formation of different nanotubes\nDespite the lower SWCNT yield when using metal-oxide\ncatalysts as compared to standard catalysts, the results do\nshow, for the first time, that metal-oxides can be used as\ncatalysts for laser ablated SWCNT synthesis and at temper-\natures well below those normally associated with laser\nablation SWCNT synthesis. Early optimization studies on\nthe reaction parameters such as catalyst composition, gas\npressure\/type\/flow rate, and temperature show the yields can\nbe significantly improved.\nThe results suggest that the inclusion of a metal oxide with\nNi\/Co or a metal oxide alone to an ablation target yield\nFigure 2.

Thus, the growth window for the\nmetal(oxide) catalyst will lie in a cooler region of the oven\n(particularly in the case of In). The results also show that\nthese metal oxide catalysts (with no other catalyst) most\nlikely grow SWCNTs through fullerene nucleation when the\nreaction temperature is sufficiently high to allow fullerene\nformation. At these higher temperatures (1200 \u00b0C), the inclu-\nsion of Ni\/Co allows larger diameter SWCNTs to be grown\nand higher SWCNT yields. Thus, in this case, Ni\/Co also\nplays a role in their growth, and since these particles will be\nsolidified in the cooler growth window of the added metal\n(oxide), this points to solidified particles participating in the\nnucleation or growth of the secondary process in some form.\nThe circumference growth mechanism, as found in CVD\nSWCNT growth,5,17 is unlikely, and all results point to a\ncapping mechanism.5 The actual ablating process from the\nlaser decomposes material from the target in a gaseous cloud\nsuch that the metal oxides are cracked and it is not hard to\nthen see that as clusters and nanosized metal particles form\nafter ablation, the concentration of oxygen is reduced so that\nthe molten metal particles can no longer be considered as\n\u201coxides\u201d. Thus, one can picture the active growth particles\nas more metallic than oxides, and this is substantiated by\nthe low temperatures used. The dilution of O by, say, mixing\nIn with In2O3 already hints that it is not so much the metal\noxide that is important, but that O is present, as indicated\nby the MWCNT obtained in sample E where O is excluded.\nThus, one can conclude that in some manner O prevents\nMWCNT growth. In CVD the fastest SWCNT growth occurs\nduring the early stages of the reaction, when the catalyst is\npresent as an oxide.20 Our studies confirm the importance\nof oxygen for the growth of SWCNTs (for the first time in\nlaser ablation synthesis).\nThe formation of SWCNTs at low temperatures (below\n600 \u00b0C) makes it very unlikely that fullerene nucleation plays\na key role in the formation of SWCNTs at low temperatures.\nThus, some other means must nucleate the SWCNT. The\nhigh temperature studies in which metal oxides are included\nwith Ni\/Co suggest solidified particles are involved alongside\nmolten particles. At lower temperatures with low melting\ntemperature metals, this is perhaps not so easily visualized.\nHowever, the laser ablation reaction is highly dynamic in\nthat the ablated materials from each laser pulse form a vapor\ncloud immediately in front of the target that grows outward\nin a vortex.4 As the cloud grows, clusters and particles form\ncatalysts particles from which SWCNTs stem. These catalysts\nparticles, from which SWCNTs grow, are generally accepted\nto be in a molten state. However the cloud will have a\ndistribution of temperatures and thus the catalyst particles\nsolidify at different times i.e., solid particles are also present.\nIt has been shown that the melting points of nanoparticles\ncan be significantly lower than that of a bulk material (e.g.,\n300 K lower for Au21 and 70 K for Sn22) and carbon-metal\neutectic points are generally lower than the melting points\nof pure metals. In addition, the molten catalyst particles that\ndo solidify do so quickly and can do so at a lower\ntemperature than the normal freezing temperature (recales-\ncence). It is due to these under-cooling effects that the best\nyields of SWCNTs in laser ablation are obtained for\ntemperatures lower than the carbon-metal eutectic points.\nThus, at room temperature (no external heating applied), the\nablation cloud will still contain a mix of both molten and\nsolidified catalysts particles for metals with melting points\nnot too far above room temperature. Interactions of material\nbetween laser pulses (such as remelting of catalyst particles)\nare unlikely in these studies as the time gap used (100 ms)\nis too large for this to be significant.12\nWe propose a growth mechanism, where the above-\ndescribed mixture of catalyst particles in two states (liquid\nand solid) enables SWCNTs to form, and this mechanism is\nillustrated in Figure 4. We argue that solidified catalyst\nparticles form a graphitic shell23 due to precipitating carbon\n(phase separation). These particles can then collide with other\nmetal particles, which are still in a molten state (fully molten\nor in which the surface remains in liquid form) and which\nare supersaturated with C and contain (in some form) oxygen.\nWhether the diffusion of C and O2 occurs throughout the\nwhole molten particle or at the surface24 is not clear. Oxygen,\nwhich is highly reactive, can then etch away part of the\ngraphitic shell surrounding the solidified particle to a point\nwhere a stable oxide ring forms (forming the embryonic stage\nof the SWCNT) and the solidified particle can merge into\nthe molten metal particle. The formation of a stable oxide\nring is not unreasonable and is considered to be the reason\nwhy preferential oxidation of SWCNT caps occurs when\nheated in air (e.g., refs 25 and 26). Mazzoni et al.27 showed\nthat preferential opening of caps as opposed to the walls is\ndue to the release of its strain energy. In addition, they\nshowed that an oxidized rim is stable.\nFollowing the formation of a cap with a stable oxidized\nring, carbon can substitute the oxygen and thus SWCNT\ngrowth takes place. Consequently, the diameter (and chiral-\nity) of the subsequent SWCNT is defined by the graphitic\nshell encapsulating the solid catalyst particle. It is possible\nthat the solidified particle has more than one carbon shell;\nnonetheless, SWCNTs will dominate (as opposed to DWCNT\n& MWCNT) since SWCNT growth can be expected from\nthe first stable oxide ring formed. This means that by\ncontrolling the solidification point of the catalyst particles\none can also control the diameter. This is seen clearly in the\nhigh temperature experiments in which the metal oxide is\nadded to Ni\/Co where the extension of the distance between\nthe coldfinger and the target essentially increases the time\nthat the Ni\/Co catalysts particles remain molten and during\nwhich time they coalesce, forming larger particles. When\nthey reach a cooler zone they solidify and form a carbon\nNano Lett., Vol. 5, No. 7, 2005 1213\nshell before the Fe -or In-based particles solidify. This then\nexplains the appearance of a bimodal diameter distribution\nand the shift of the secondary diameter distribution with\nrespect to the target to coldfinger distance in the OAS results.\nIt also explains the diameter dependence on temperature as\nfound with the studies using MgO as a catalyst.\nIn cases where a bimodal diameter distribution is obtained,\nthe primary diameter distribution does not shift for different\ntarget to coldfinger distances. This shows that the coexistence\nof the metal oxides with Ni\/Co does not adversely affect\nthe growth of SWCNTs due to Ni\/Co (which occurs in a\ndifferent growth window). This is partially supported by the\nstudies where O was added to the reaction with a standard\nNi\/Co catalyst and in the unchanged (primary) diameter\ndistribution. This is further supported by the EDX analysis\nwhich show the catalysts particles to be dominated by a\nsingle metal, and, furthermore, Ni or Co based catalyst\nparticles are on the whole smaller than those of the added\nmetal (oxide).\nThe results also show that O prevents MWCNT formation,\nand although the exact dynamics are not clear presently, this\ncould be due to the reduction of precipitating C from a\nmolten particle, i.e., it leaves as CO. CO can also enter\nmolten catalysts particles and act as a source of C.\nSuch a mechanism can also explain circumference growth\nin CVD SWCNT synthesis. Often the catalysts particles\nreside on an oxidized substrate (e.g., refs 28 and 29), which\ncan then provide oxygen for the formation of a stable\noxidized ring at the interface of the catalysts particles and\nthe substrate viz., the circumference of the catalyst particle.\nWe aim to conduct studies to verify this. The mechanism\ncan also explain SWCNT synthesis where an alternative\n(oxide based) support is used (see, e.g., refs 30 and 31).\nFurther studies are required to verify this mechanism and\nwhether oxygen plays the same roles when using the usual\ncatalysts for laser ablation (Co, Ni, Pt, Rh). Indeed, in laser\nablation the diameter of the synthesized SWCNTs is heavily\ninfluenced by temperature, gas type, pressure, and flow rate.\nThese parameters will directly influence the size of solidified\ncatalyst particles in NECS. Further, oxygen will always be\npresent in the reaction chamber in small quantities, whether\nfrom trapped air in the target or elsewhere. Thus, it may be\na universal necessity that oxygen is present to etch carbon\nshells open and more importantly form a stable oxidized ring\nfrom whence SWCNT growth stems.\nFinally, such a mechanism would allow the controlled\ngrowth of SWCNTs in terms of diameter and chilarity if\none used a SWCNT as a template. Dipping one end into an\nactive catalyst would essentially lead to continued SWCNT\ngrowth with the diameter and chirality defined by the\ntemplating SWCNT.\nTo summarize, we have shown for the first time that metal\noxides can be used as catalysts for SWCNT growth and that\nby selecting a metal oxide (where the metal has a low melting\ntemperature), SWCNTs can be synthesized even at room\ntemperature without the need for fullerenes. The results make\nthe controlled growth (diameter and chirality) of SWCNT\napplications in microelectronics and biomolecular electronics\nmore accessible. The presence of oxygen is key to preventing,\nat least some, metals from precipitating carbon freely and\nso forming MWCNT. In addition, the role of oxygen is vital\nto etch open the nucleating carbon shell and in providing a\nstable oxidized rim, forming an embryonic cap from which\nsubsequent SWCNT growth takes place. The results strongly\nsuggest a growth mechanism previously not identified, which\nwe term nucleation via etched carbon shells (NECS). Future\nstudies should determine how universal such a mechanism\nis both in terms of different synthesis systems and different\ncatalysts.\nAcknowledgment. We thank the DFG PI 440\/1.
