This utilises NLP as a methodology, as a way of inquiring into subjec-\ntive experience, which reflects the originally intended function of NLP. By ex-\nploring an empirical case, the article addresses some of the issues raised by Tay-\nlor (1998) about the understanding of transformative learning related to the field\nJournal of Transformative Education Vol. 3 No. 2, April 2005 140-167\nDOI: 10.1177\/1541344604270233\n\u00a92005 Sage Publications\n140\nMapping Transformative Learning 141\nof management learning. The concept appears highly relevant to this field but to\ndate has received little attention.\nThis interest has arisen through our practice in U.K. higher education and as\ncoaches working with business managers and consultants. We are strongly in-\nvolved in holistic adult education for professional practitioners in the field of or-\nganizational development (OD) and group facilitation, with an emphasis on ex-\nperiential learning and the importance of the affective dimension (e.g., Tosey &\nGregory, 1998).\nTwo of the authors have trained in NLP and are active researchers in the field\n(Mathison, 2003; Tosey & Mathison, 2003). All authors have experience of facili-\ntating what we think of as forms of transformative learning in contexts such as\nmanagement development coaching. We say \u201cthink of\u201d because according to Tay-\nlor (1998), \u201calthough the theory is much discussed, the practice of transformative\nlearning has been minimally investigated and is inadequately defined and poorly\nunderstood\u201d (p. vii). One purpose of this article therefore is to help us tease out\nto what extent or in what respects our practice and experience could be framed\nas transformative learning. Primarily though, we intend to consider the potential\nof NLP for assisting the empirical investigation of transformative learning.\nThe article concentrates on an illustrative case study of a manager reflecting\non his contemporary experience of an organizational change process over time.\nTransformative Learning: Theory and Issues\nDirkx (2000) identified two main strands of transformative learning theory,\nthose of Mezirow (1975, 1981, 1990, 1991, 1997) and Boyd (1980, 1991). Taylor\n(1998) added to these Freire\u2019s model of transformative education. This article is\nconcerned primarily with how NLP relates to the perspectives offered by Mezirow\nand Boyd.\nInfluenced in part by a personal dilemma (Mezirow, 1991), Mezirow built on\nand adapted Habermas\u2019s (1981) theory of communicative action. The formal em-\npirical basis for the theory was a study (Mezirow, 1975) of the learning experience\nof women returning to formal education. This strand of theory concentrates\nmainly on the context of adult education (e.g., Cranton, 1996, 1997; Imel, 1998).\nMezirow (1997) emphasised a view of learning as meaning making and de-\nfined transformative learning as \u201cthe process of effecting a change in a frame of\nreference\u201d (p. 5). He sought to understand processes by which frames of refer-\nence, or \u201cmeaning perspectives,\u201d through which we view and interpret experience\nare changed or transformed. He viewed transformation as a qualitative change of\nAuthors\u2019 Note: Dr. Jane Mathison recently gained her doctorate from the Univer-\nsity of Surrey. At the time of submission, she had no formal affiliation to this or any\nother university. Dena Michelli is a current doctoral student at the University of\nSurrey. This article is based in part on a paper presented at the first International\nConference on Organizational Spirituality, Living Spirit: New Dimensions in Work\nand Learning, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey UK, July 2002.\n142 Journal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\ncognitive perspective and emphasised the development of autonomous thinking.\nTransformation occurs as the self-concept is revised as a result of the new mean-\ning perspective.\nAccording to Mezirow, the mechanism for transformation is the differentia-\ntion and integration of meaning schemes in progressively wider contexts. This\noccurs through attaining higher levels of awareness, critical reflection on and\nreappraisal of assumptions, the ability to reinterpret a previously learned experi-\nence in a new context, and the ability to engage in rational, reflective discourse to\ntake action. Mezirow suggested that transformative learning is relatively rare.\nDirkx (2000) commented that Mezirow\u2019s approach has a strong cognitive em-\nphasis and may neglect modes of knowing such as intuition. By contrast, the sec-\nond strand of theory, labelled by Dirkx as mytho-poetic, is characterised by an in-\nterest in a symbolic dimension of learning. Dirkx referred particularly to the\nJungian approach of Boyd (1991) and others. Boyd\u2019s emphasis has been on trans-\nformation through group work (Boyd, 1980), using the metaphor of a journey\nand framing learning as a developmental process leading toward individuation.\nBoyd, like Frick (1987) and others such as Nelson (1997), emphasised the ho-\nlistic nature of learning, and the focus on the symbolic dimension and on imag-\ninal experience appears important in the case that follows. However, we question\nthe universality of the journey metaphor.\nDespite this literature, empirical understanding and operational definition of\ntransformative learning remain elusive. Although Mezirow\u2019s theory is only one\nstrand of work in this area, it remains the main literature with which one can en-\ngage critically. We are aware (Wiessner, 2004) that there are other recent develop-\nments in the field, however these are yet to be disseminated through pub-\nlished literature.\nTaylor (1998), whose critical review focuses on Mezirow\u2019s strand of theory,\nidentified a range of issues. Among these is the observation that the empirical re-\nsearch base in the literature on transformative learning consists substantially of\nunpublished doctoral dissertations (Taylor, 1998), which Taylor argued is a prob-\nlem for the field.\nTaylor (1998) noted that most of these studies \u201cwere carried out in retrospect,\nwhere participants reflected back on their transformative experience, as opposed\nto observing and recording the learning experience as it was actually happening\u201d\n(p. 22). In contrast, we offer observations of a case where data were collected over\ntime from the participant.\nOther than these studies, the literature seems characterised by writers\u2019 self-\nreferenced accounts of their experiences, interpreted in relation to concepts of\ntransformative learning (e.g., Clark, 1997; Foster, 1997; Wilcox, 1997). These de-\nscriptions of transformative learning, although valuable as learners\u2019 stories, are\nnevertheless highly dependent on their authors\u2019 interpretations of their own ex-\nperiences. They do not make their claims (i.e., to be examples of transformative\nlearning) explicit or subject these to debate; they seem inclined to adopt preex-\nisting concepts of transformative learning uncritically and therefore can appear\nself-sealing.\nMapping Transformative Learning 143\nSuch studies would seem to reinforce the view that it is for learners to define\nwhat is transformative without complementary evidence and critical analysis.\nThis appears to us to leave the concept nebulous. What is it that differentiates\ntransformative learning from other learning? Indeed, should the concept be re-\ngarded as a description of a learning process (such as described by Mezirow\u2019s\n[1991] 10 steps) and not as an outcome or even as a metaphor that is engaging\nattention on a yet to be defined terrain?\nThis situation also leaves the field highly vulnerable to charges of inadequate\ndefinition and oversubjectivity\u2014which we would contrast not with objectivity\nbut with the notion of \u201ccritical subjectivity,\u201d which Reason (1988, p. 13) described\nas being more demanding than orthodox inquiry, involving a high degree of self-\nknowledge, self-reflection, and cooperative criticism.\nSo we only partially support Mezirow\u2019s view that hermeneutic research is ap-\npropriate for this area and contend that Mezirow\u2019s (1991) rejection of empirical-\nanalytic research methods needs to be debated. We support the appropriateness\nof qualitative and naturalistic rather than positivistic research, yet the field seems\nmuch in need of substantive empirical work to support its claims. We also have a\ndesire to understand how we can engage empirically with this notion as facilita-\ntors to articulate and value our practice.\nTaylor (1998) said \u201cthere is a need for research designs beyond the phenome-\nnological approach, so that other paradigms are used from a longitudinal per-\nspective in exploration of transformative learning\u201d (p. 62). It is not clear what\nTaylor meant here by phenomenological approach as this term appears not to be\nused prior to this point (which is the final page of the publication). The present\narticle\u2019s case does offer a longitudinal perspective. It is also phenomenological in\nthe sense that it focuses on the subjective experience and constructed reality of\nthe participant. The contribution of NLP is as a structured and systematic means\nof mapping that subjective experience.\nWe note that Taylor (1998) did not discuss the methodological approaches of\nthe studies he reviewed beyond the aforementioned comment that most were car-\nried out in retrospect. Indeed, it seems surprising that Taylor\u2019s critique did\nnot include consideration of research methodology. This seems to warrant\nfurther exploration.\nNeuro-Linguistic Programming\nNeuro-linguistic programming was developed at the University of California\nat Santa Cruz in the 1970s (McLendon, 1989). Its founders and principal authors\nwere Richard Bandler, a student of (initially) mathematics and computer science,\nand John Grinder, a professor of linguistics.\nNLP has since achieved popularity as a method for communication and per-\nsonal development. There is a need for data to be more precise about the level of\nactivity; as an indication, the Web site of the International NLP Trainers\u2019 Associ-\nation (INLPTA)1 lists trainers in Europe, Australia, South America, and North\n144 Journal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nAmerica. NLP is a recognised mode of psychotherapy in the United Kingdom, ac-\ncredited by the U.K. Council for Psychotherapy (Experiential Constructivist\nTherapies section). NLP is used by professional practitioners of many kinds, in-\ncluding educators, managers, trainers, salespeople, market researchers, counsel-\nlors, consultants, medics, lawyers, and more.\nThe title, coined by Bandler and Grinder, broadly denotes the view that a per-\nson is a whole mind-body system with patterned connections between internal\nexperience (neuro), language (linguistic), and behaviour (programming).\nNLP has been defined in various ways, often in its promotional literature as\n(e.g.) \u201cthe art of communication excellence\u201d or \u201cthe study of the structure\nof subjective experience.\u201d These definitions reflect a tension within NLP in\nthat it is both a technology for communication and personal development\nand (as it claimed to be originally) a methodology or modelling process\n(Cameron-Bandler, Gordon, & Lebeau, 1985; Dilts, 1998).\nThus, although NLP has come to be identified as a mode of psychotherapy in\nits own right, originally it was offered as a method capable of identifying the ef-\nfective aspects of existing models of communication (gestalt, transactional analy-\nsis, etc.) for pragmatic purposes. Initially (see Bandler & Grinder 1975b; Grinder\n& Bandler, 1976), Bandler and Grinder were interested in figures such as Carl\nRogers, Fritz Perls, and Virginia Satir because of their reputation for excel-\nlence. Bandler and Grinder asked what was the difference that made a differ-\nence between these excellent practitioners and others, focusing on what they did\nin practice\u2014on their patterns of communication and interaction\u2014rather than\non the formal theory from which their practice drew.\nNLP writing and practice show influences from a wide array of fields, such as\ngestalt therapy (Perls, 1969), person-centred counselling (Rogers, 1961), trans-\nformational grammar (Grinder & Elgin, 1973), behavioural psychology, cyber-\nnetics (Ashby, 1965), the Palo Alto school of brief therapy (Watzlawick, Beavin, &\nJackson, 1967), Ericksonian hypnotherapy (Bandler & Grinder, 1975a; Grinder,\nDeLozier, & Bandler, 1977), and perhaps most important the cybernetic episte-\nmology of Gregory Bateson (1973; Tosey & Mathison, 2003). The cybernetic as-\npect is reflected, for example, in NLP\u2019s adoption of the TOTE (test-operate-test-\nexit) mode of functioning (Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960), which depends on\nthe dynamics of calibration and feedback (Bateson, 1973; Wiener, 1965).\nWe note that NLP is not a uniform field. For example, since the 1980s, Grinder\nhas concentrated on \u201cnew code\u201d NLP (DeLozier & Grinder, 1987), which takes an\nintentionally more holistic (i.e., whole body-mind) approach than the more an-\nalytical style of early NLP. New code NLP has incorporated interests in (e.g.)\nshamanic practices.\nTo date, NLP seems most welcomed by informal practitioner networks that\nencourage direct use of NLP\u2019s strategies. Academe appears relatively uninterested\nto date. A few experimental psychology studies in the 1980s and 1990s examined\nNLP\u2019s eye movement model (e.g., Baddeley & Predebon, 1991; Farmer, Rooney,\n& Cunningham, 1985; Poffel & Cross, 1985) and found no basis for acceptance of\nthe model. There has since been a sprinkling of academic journal articles report-\ning applications of NLP to various fields of practice (e.g., Field, 1990; Sandhu,\n1994; Trickey, 1997) but little more.\nThe relationship between NLP and academe has been tenuous and somewhat\nstrained, influenced in part by the apparently antitheoretical stance of the\nfounders (\u201cWe have no idea about the \u2018real\u2019 nature of things, and we\u2019re not par-\nticularly interested in what\u2019s \u2018true.\u2019 The function of modeling is to arrive at de-\nscriptions which are useful,\u201d Bandler & Grinder, 1979, p. 7). NLP also appears to\nsuffer (in the eyes of academics) from its Californian origins, and it has acquired\nan unfortunate reputation as a \u201cmanipulative\u201d approach.\nThere are signs of the stirrings of welcome debate about the theoretical status\nof NLP (e.g., Craft, 2001; Tosey & Mathison, 2003), an issue also being addressed\nby some writers in the NLP field (e.g., Young, 2001). Because NLP originally was\na methodology used to identify and code effective practices from a range of prac-\ntitioners and theories, its contents\u2014models and strategies\u2014appear highly eclec-\ntic. This leads some (e.g., Craft, 2001) to the view that NLP, although broadly con-\nstructivist in nature, cannot be considered a theory. Another possible view is that\nit represents a more postmodern, transdisciplinary form of knowledge. Others\n(e.g., Young, 2001) have attempted to identify a unifying theory of NLP. Young\u2019s\n(2001) work views NLP through further maps that offer a valuable perspective (to\nwhich we return later in this article), but in our opinion this offers an alternative\nconceptual description of NLP, not a unifying theoretical explanation.\nTo address this issue in detail, which there is not space to do here, one would\nneed to review what is meant by theory and thus what criteria are being applied.\nOur own view (Tosey & Mathison, 2003) is that the key theory of NLP is that\nwhich pertains to its methodological nature. We argue (Tosey & Mathison, 2003)\nthat NLP is strongly and consistently based on a systemic epistemology, as repre-\nsented in the work of Bateson (1973; Bateson & Bateson, 1988) and as described\nin the field by Dilts (2000). Trying to reconcile the contents of models and frame-\nworks employed by NLP seems unlikely to be as fruitful.\nAlthough NLP is a methodology, it is not a recognised research method, hence\nthe application in this article represents an innovation. We have used NLP frame-\nworks because they appear to us to offer possibilities for finer and more specific\nanalysis of subjective experience than is available from other phenomenological\nmethods. There appears to be broad compatibility between NLP and the various\ntheoretical perspectives contributing to Mezirow\u2019s (1991) notion of meaning per-\nspectives. NLP assumes that people act according to the way they understand and\nrepresent the world, not according to the way the world is, often summed up in\nKorzybski\u2019s (1958) dictum,\u201cthe map is not the territory.\u201d It therefore supports the\nconstructivist principle that people create their own reality while also focusing on\ncommon structures of those constructions\u2014their form rather than their content.\nNLP however typically attends much less to the social dimension, tending to em-\nphasise the uniqueness of individuals\u2019 maps of the world and to underplay the\nrole of social influence and interaction.\nMapping Transformative Learning 145\n146\nWe have used NLP as a framework through which to map changes in the par-\nticipant\u2019s worldview using the following particular models or perspectives.\n1. The meta model (Bandler & Grinder, 1975b; Grinder & Bandler, 1976), which\nclassifies language patterns based on the theory of transformational grammar.\n2. Dilts\u2019s neurological levels (Dilts & Epstein, 1995), which is derived from Bate-\nson\u2019s (1973) notion of levels of learning.\n3. Metaphor and symbol (e.g., Gordon, 1978; Lawley & Tompkins, 2000).\nThe Empirical Study \nThe intention of the case study was to explore what learning a senior manager\nwho was in the midst of an organizational change process could gain from his ex-\nperience. The broad themes of interest were the potential for management learn-\ning from experience and links between individual and organizational change is-\nsues. Although management learning is a significant area of academic concern\n(Burgoyne & Reynolds, 1997), there appears to be relatively little research devoted\nto in-depth understanding of the experience of and learning of managers them-\nselves. Exceptions include Marshall (1984, 1995), through her studies of female\nmanagers, and Stuart (1995), who considered managers\u2019 experiences of organiza-\ntional change through the metaphor of the \u201cchange journey.\u201d\nSTUDY DESIGN\nIn this section, we describe the nature of the study and address methodologi-\ncal features, including the single case study, longitudinal design, and the dual\nanalysis, with both collaborative and researcher-led aspects.\nThe study is the story of Ed, managing director of a European operation\nwithin a global company (ZCo). He was in his 50s and had worked for ZCo for\n30 years. A few months before I (principal author) first met him, he had been ap-\npointed as a new, cross-Europe head of business. Soon after his appointment it\nwas announced that ZCo was to merge with another global company, XCo. Ed\nsaw this as \u201ctantamount to being told that the world is about to change.\u201d\nI met Ed through a student and asked to interview him about his experience\nof and learning from the change process. My offer to Ed was to provide him with\na space for reflection, which he felt would be of benefit. The outer details of the\nchange process were not the focus. The interest was in how Ed perceived and\nframed his experience of change, in how his inner map of change and its mean-\ning for him changed over time, and in what he considered he learned from the ex-\nperience both about himself and about the management of change.\nEd and I eventually met four times over a period of a little less than a year from\none August to the following May. The main method of data collection consisted\nof four conversational interviews lasting at least 90 minutes each, at intervals of\nbetween 3 and 5 months. All the interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed.\nAnalysis procedures are described in the following section.\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nMapping Transformative Learning 147\nThe study may be thought of as a single case study2 (Stake, 1995) where the\nmanager himself was the case. In Stake\u2019s (1995) terms, this case study has both in-\ntrinsic and instrumental aspects. The intrinsic dimension is the intent to under-\nstand Ed\u2019s particular, individual situation. The instrumental dimension is re-\nflected in the desire to illuminate issues of management learning from experience\nand in the desire to apply NLP as an analytical framework.\nThere are precedents for a single case study approach as well as challenges to\nits validity. Silverman (2000) noted that some such challenges are based on the\nstandard of generalisability applied in quantitative research. Yin (1993), although\npreferring the scientific method himself, acknowledged the alternative of a natu-\nralistic approach (e.g., Lincoln & Guba, 1985), which this study adopts. Stake\n(1995) took the view that \u201cthe real business of case study is particularization, not\ngeneralization. We take a particular case and come to know it well, not primarily\nas to how it is different from others but what it is, what it does\u201d (p. 8).\nThe purpose of this case was to develop an illuminative understanding of this\nmanager\u2019s experience for its intrinsic benefit and to generate themes and ques-\ntions that may be investigated in other contexts. The case is used in this article to\nillustrate the application of NLP as an analytical perspective. There is no inten-\ntion to claim that the substantive findings can be extrapolated beyond this case.\nWe also emphasise the longitudinal design. Collins (1998), for example, noted\nthe relative dearth of longitudinal, contextualised studies of organizational\nchange. Here, the series of interviews provides for comparison through time,\nwhich is the basis of the multiple data perspectives in the study.\nTime was a significant dimension also in that the participant\u2019s perception of\nhis learning emerged and changed over time through a process of reflection and\ndialogue rather than through an analysis of data gathered at one point in time.\nMeaning evolved through reflection over time, in sympathy with the idea that\nsense making ripens (Patton, 1990).\nThe research was also collaborative in the style described by Reason (1988) in\nthat the study intentionally engaged the participant in the analysis, interpreta-\ntion, and exploration of meaning. The participant was also invited to but chose\nnot to collaborate in the writing up. In common with many forms of collabora-\ntive research, the research process inevitably constitutes an intervention in the\nparticipant\u2019s life as an event that may lead to change or learning. Therefore, the\nmethodology also has an action research characteristic typical of collaborative-\nstyle studies, and the research aimed to treat the participant as a self-directed per-\nson (Heron, 1996).\nThe surfacing, discovery, and shaping of narratives was itself regarded as a\nlearning process in which we suggest in principle participants are entitled to en-\ngage. This aimed to embody Martin Buber\u2019s \u201cI-Thou\u201d stance, which Maslow\nrecognised as an alternative epistemological stance to that of \u201cobjective science\u201d\n(Rowan, 2001, pp. 18-19). According to procedures for validity in collaborative\ninquiry (Reason, 1988), critical evaluation was enabled in this study through re-\nflective dialogue between researcher and participant and soliciting of independ-\nent third-party perspectives on the data and their interpretation.\n148\nFinally, the study adopted a constructivist perspective by assuming that mean-\ning emerges from sense making through both reflection and the discourses of the\nsocial (interview) context. In this research, we regard the story of the manager\u2019s\nexperience as a series of coconstructed narratives rather than being straightfor-\nward representations of what the manager had already \u201clearned.\u201d\nDATA ANALYSIS \nAnalysis of data included both researcher-led and collaborative review of the\ntranscripts. There were two phases of analysis.\na. Contemporary: The researcher used the NUD*IST qualitative data software to\nperform an inductive analysis (Patton, 1990) by identifying, grouping, and refin-\ning grounded themes from raw data. During this process, I supplied transcripts\nto Ed and fed back to him the themes and categories I had identified in the data.\nAt each meeting we would talk about what he had said the previous time and how\nhe felt about it now.\nb. Post hoc using NLP: After the series of interviews, the first and second authors\ndid a further analysis to explore the potential of neuro-linguistic programming\nfor making sense of the data. We used NLP to identify distinctions and changes\nin Ed\u2019s language patterns over time, utilising the three NLP models noted earlier,\nwhich appeared appropriate to the verbal (transcribed) data.\nDimensions of Transformation\nThe analysis is developed under the following three main headings: (a) char-\nacteristics of the output or of the emergent understanding of the person\/learner,\n(b) characteristics of the person\u2019s inner process or journey, and (c) characteristics\nof the interpersonal process between learner and facilitator. These connect to-\ngether on the map in Figure 1, which we assemble as we describe the various\nparts.\nTHE OUTPUT: CHARACTERISTICS OF \nTHE EMERGENT UNDERSTANDING\nTaylor (1998) stated, \u201cOne of the most elusive concepts of transformative\nlearning is the definitional outcome of a perspective transformation. What is the\nconsequence of changing your world view? What are related outcomes of revis-\ning meaning perspectives?\u201d (p. 42).\nA general feature of transformative learning is that of taking a wider perspec-\ntive, creating an expanded worldview. In Mezirow\u2019s (1991) words, this perspective\nis \u201cmore inclusive, differentiated, permeable, and integrated\u201d (p. 155).\nFor example, successive interviews with Ed are marked by a lessening of anxi-\nety about his own situation and an increasing focus on others: \u201cSo now every-\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nMapping Transformative Learning 149\nthing is much sunnier. . . . I\u2019m not worried about myself any more, I\u2019m much\nmore worried about people out there, how can we deliver to them something in\nterms of either job security or a job.\u201d Within this expanded perspective, we iden-\ntified the following four characteristics: change of identity, change of beliefs\nabout the world, paradoxical thinking, and emergence of a new core metaphor.\nChange of Identity \nHere we used Robert Dilts\u2019s NLP model of neurological levels (Dilts & Epstein,\n1995). Dilts identified six levels (environment, behaviour, capability, belief, iden-\ntity, and spirit). The model is represented as a hierarchical network. This denotes\nthat change at a higher level (e.g., identity) has more far-reaching consequences\nfor the person in that this is likely to affect an increasingly wide range of beliefs,\ncapabilities, and behaviours.\nThe analysis searched for statements that defined or described the self (see\nTable 1).\nSome of the changes over time were in Ed\u2019s perception and definition of self,\nperhaps illustrating tensions between personal and sociocultural definitions of\nidentity. For example, in the first interview his descriptions were of feeling \u201calone\nin the universe\u201d and potentially limited to his \u201cone company career,\u201d asking \u201care\nmy skills transferable?\u201d\nLater, he reported a more detached perspective, asking questions such as \u201cDo\nI want to be doing this for the rest of my life?\u201d His identity toward the end seemed\nfar less strongly identified with his career role, and there was a loosening of attachment\nto the organisational world and its values. His image of himself existing outside\nFigure 1: Synthesis\n150\nTa\nbl\ne \n1:\nT\nhe\nm\nes\n o\nf\nSe\nlf\nan\nd \nId\nen\nti\nty\nT\nhe\nm\nes\nId\nen\nti\nty\nQ\nu\not\nes\nM\non\nth\n 1\nH\now\n t\nh\nin\ngs\n u\nse\nd \nto\n b\ne,\nco\nm\npa\nri\nso\nn\ns \nw\nit\nh\nO\nn\ne \nco\nm\npa\nny\n c\nar\nee\nr\u2014\nar\ne \nm\ny \nsk\nill\ns \n \n\u201cI\n s\nti\nll \nfe\nel\n c\non\nfi\nde\nn\nt \nen\nou\ngh\n t\nh\nat\n I\n\u2019v\ne \ngo\nt\nw\nh\nat\n w\nill\n b\ne \n(e\n.g\n.,\nw\nar\nm\n t\no \nco\nld\n) \ntr\nan\nsf\ner\nab\nle\n?

Ed increas-\ningly said that family was more important than career in the scheme of things.\nChange of Beliefs: Complex Equivalence and Causality \nNLP suggests that a significant change to one\u2019s map of the world may be new\nviews of cause and meaning. This literally means that a person reconfigures the\ncausal relations between the parts of their map, so it is consistent with the litera-\nture in that transformative learning entails change of understandings about the\nworld. It corresponds also to the belief level in Dilts\u2019s model (Dilts & Epstein,\n1995).\nBandler and Grinder\u2019s (1975b) meta-model of language structures calls one\nsuch type of connection \u201ccomplex equivalences.\u201d This is where two elements, cat-\negories, or abstractions are linked together to form new meaning. The simplest\nalgorithm describing this process would be A = B, a linguistic connection indi-\ncating an epistemological linkage in the person\u2019s map of the world.\nIn the transcripts, a number of interesting complex equivalences emerge,\nmany of which are linked to Ed\u2019s views about information. He worked in a large\norganisation in which there was (he reported) little open sharing of information.\nAccess to information seemed an important feature of the situation, reinforced by\nthe outer reality of the involvement of various regulatory bodies and the fact that\nat one stage Ed was required to sign a confidentiality agreement.\nIn the first interview (Month 1), the theme of inclusion in and exclusion from\ngroups with information about the future is prominent. The complex equivalence\nwas that having access to information means being included. Conversely, not hav-\ning access carried with it a sense of being excluded, being an outsider, not being\nvalued, perhaps being thought inadequate, and being frustrated and powerless.\nIn the third interview, Ed had weathered the changes in the organisation and\nhad himself become one of the people who \u201cknow\u201d: \u201cSo now I am in a position\nof knowledge, of where I\u2019m going, but nobody below me knows where they are\ngoing. . . . I do know where they are going.\u201d By now, he was on the other side of\nthe fence, as it were. In other words, he now felt powerful because he had access\nto information that he could withhold from others.\nNote that this example gives some possible counterevidence of transformative\nlearning. Although Ed\u2019s place or position in the complex equivalence has\nchanged, his personal beliefs are still characterised by the same set of complex\nequivalences. In Watzlawick, Weakland, and Fisch\u2019s (1974) terms, this is a\nfirst-order change rather than the second-order change we would associate in\nprinciple with transformative learning.\nA second aspect of beliefs about the world concerns causality. Most significant\nhere, we can consider the extent to which an individual experiences himself or\nherself as being primarily the agent of causality or primarily at the effect of other\nagents.\nInitially Ed was not at cause because he did not perceive himself as having\nagency in the situation (\u201cI guess the frustration is not being able to participate in\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nthe making of the future\u201d). Over time, he seemed to switch to a different concep-\ntual framework in which he seemed more at cause.\nSo my learning . . . is that you can only do what you can do, you can only do\nwhat\u2019s within your reach to do, and . . . choose the thing that is relatively short\nterm, you have control over and that means the most to people you\u2019re actually\nleading.\nParadoxical Thinking\nA third characteristic is paradoxical thinking. People\u2019s thinking may contain a\nnumber of implied or actual opposites (e.g., light and dark) by dilemmas (e.g., \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know whether to do A or B\u201d), by examples of either-or thinking, and some-\ntimes by double binds (Bateson, 1973; Watzlawick et al., 1967). Paradoxical\nthinking is reflected in a movement from either-or thinking, where the two poles\nof a dilemma are seen as in opposition and mutually exclusive, to a capacity\nto hold apparent opposites in tension and eventually to find creative resolu-\ntions to those tensions. This relates, for example, to dialectical thinking\n(Basseches as cited by Mezirow, 1991) and to characteristics of Torbert\u2019s (1991)\nlater stages of development.\nEd\u2019s first interview shows much either-or thinking connected to complex\nequivalences (e.g., Ed initially either had information and therefore was powerful\netc., or he did not and was powerless). \u201cYou know there\u2019s a gap, and the gap is\nwidening all the time in terms of people\u2019s . . . people believing that either you\nknow or you don\u2019t know.\u201d\nEither-or thinking and dilemmas seem to be experienced as frustrating.\nProminent in the first interview is what Ed described as \u201can inside splitting.\u201d\nEither-or thinking occurs much less frequently in the later interviews, when\nEd seems to be developing ways of tolerating the paradoxes and contradictions\nthat appeared as part of the organisation\u2019s transitions. Leadership for him then\nmeans \u201cholding the split\u201d and accepting and managing the contradictions in his\nown position of having information. The focus has also changed from his own\nworld to taking care of others. In that sense, one might argue that there has been\nself-transcendence.\nEmergent Metaphor\nFinally in this section, a feature was the emergence of a new core metaphor.\nThis seems to operate as a basic theme or image around which the new worldview\nconstellates.\nEd\u2019s experience of organisational change was happening alongside a process of\ndivorce and then remarriage in his personal life. As our interviews proceeded, he\nhad a growing sense of these experiences as parallels, reflections of each other in\ndifferent domains of his life with (for him) remarkable similarities between them.\nHe felt, for example, that the divorce was giving him a unique insight into the sep-\nMapping Transformative Learning 153\n154\naration of two parts of his company, which was a prerequisite for the subsequent\nmerger.\nThis may raise the interesting question\u2014to which we have no set answer\u2014of\nthe relationship between Ed\u2019s personal and professional contexts. Were these co-\nincidental or perhaps synchronistic? Was one context primary and the other\nmore a screen onto which the primary transformation became projected and\nacted out? \nWhatever one may speculate, it seems significant that divorce and remarriage\nbecame the organising metaphor for Ed\u2019s experience of change management.\nThis would support Edwards\u2019s (as cited in Taylor, 1998) view that people perceive\ntheir lives to be organized as narratives rather than in rational-logical form.\nSummary of Case Analysis\nIn summary, if we were to extrapolate from analysis of Ed\u2019s transcripts, the fol-\nlowing types of change might indicate that a transformative process has taken\nplace:\n\u2022 the emergence of a capacity for a wider frame or perspective, probably involving\na less egoic, more detached view of a situation (possibly but not necessarily a spir-\nitual perspective), including\n\u2022 a change at the level of identity (in Dilts\u2019s model of neurological levels);\n\u2022 changes also at the belief level in Dilts\u2019s model, represented by changes in what\nNLP calls complex equivalence and cause-effect patterns: and notably a movement\nfrom being at cause to being at effect;\n\u2022 evidence of tolerance of paradox, especially of change toward integrating or re-\nsolving dilemmas, and less use of either-or thinking;\n\u2022 emergence of a (new) core metaphor around which the person\u2019s story (e.g., their\nrevised understanding of themselves and their world) is constellated.\nTHE LEARNING JOURNEY: CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INNER PROCESS \nWe now turn to characteristics of the person\u2019s learning process through time.\nEd\u2019s story could of course be taken just on the level of being a series of events in\nthe outer world. The following two further dimensions were of particular inter-\nest from the analysis:\n\u2022 changes in his inner landscape or mental map of the situation, as delineated\nthrough metaphors of space, time, and motion;\n\u2022 metaphors and symbols, which may indicate a mythic or archetypal dimension to\ntransformative learning.\nHere we are concerned only to give an NLP perspective on Ed\u2019s learning process.\nWe do not intend to develop a model of the process to compare with Mezirow\u2019s\n(1991) 10 stages.3\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nSpace, Time, and Motion\nAn intriguing feature of Ed\u2019s worldview (revealed by the inductive analysis)\nwas that it seemed permeated by metaphors of space, time, and motion.\nThe notion that the representation of space is an important epistemological\norganising principle was put forward by Fauconnier and Sweetser (1996), John-\nson (1987), Lakoff and Johnson (1999), and Fauconnier and Turner (2002).\nWhat emerged here was the sense of Ed metaphorically (and thus literally for\nhim as NLP takes such verbal reports to be literal descriptions of a person\u2019s inner\nmap of the world) moving through a changing space-time continuum.\nWe say changing because space and time were configured differently at each in-\nterview (see Table 2). There were three domains that for Ed had spatial dimen-\nsions, as follows:\n\u2022 the change process itself (e.g., the spatial characteristics of the change process in-\nclude much reference to apparently existential themes; Ed referred to \u201cthe void,\u201d\nlimbo, and \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d),\n\u2022 Ed\u2019s internal experience (e.g., the \u201cinternal splitting\u201d),\n\u2022 the company (e.g., concepts of centrality and distance).\nTo illustrate just the last of these, one of Ed\u2019s main distinctions is between in-\nsiders and outsiders, people who are included in or excluded from information.\nHe also talks about being closer to or more distant from \u201cthe centre\u201d or \u201cthe\nheart\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re not in the real centre but on the sort of the next layer out.\u201d \u201cYou\nare that number of spaces away from the heart.\u201d\nSometimes he used the image of a wall or fence separating him spatially from\nthe centre of power. Exclusion was experienced as \u201ca huge sort of wall that you\ncan\u2019t peer over\u201d and later, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a ladder tall enough to look over the\nfence.\u201d So the metaphorical space also seems to have an architecture.\nThe most noticeable difference in the third interview is that he reports being\npositioned in the metaphorical centre, having survived much of the reorganisa-\ntion and been able to stay in the company. He is now an insider; there are others\nwho are now outsiders. Survival has meant moving from the periphery to the\ncentre: \u201cI guess because the management team is in a different place now because\nwe are knowledgeable, more knowledgeable than the people outside.\u201d\nThe extent and quality of time itself undergoes change according to Ed\u2019s ac-\ncounts. In summary, time was portrayed successively as a period of planned tran-\nsition of finite duration, with emphasis on the present; followed by being \u201cin\nlimbo,\u201d with things \u201cgrinding slowly,\u201d the eventual timescale impossible to pre-\ndict; followed by time \u201ctaking care of itself\u201d in that the process acquired \u201ca\nrhythm of its own;\u201d and finally another transitional period but now with a sense\nof new beginnings (described as a time of \u201cgiving birth\u201d) and with Ed\u2019s personal\nfuture in terms of his role in the company having a known timescale.\nMapping Transformative Learning 155\n156\nTa\nbl\ne \n2:\nE\nd\u2019\ns \nE\nxp\ner\nie\nn\nce\n o\nf\nC\nha\nn\nge\n a\ns \na \nSp\nac\ne-\nT\nim\ne

Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nAlthough we have separated space, time, and motion, their interrelatedness,\nparticularly concerning the change process, is shown by phrases such as grinding\nslowly, being in limbo, suspended animation, and a rhythm of its own.\nIt has been of great interest to notice the possibility of viewing Ed\u2019s experience\nas a changing space-time continuum. The empirical material here about dimen-\nsions of space, time, and motion is to our knowledge original. Obviously com-\nparison with other cases will be helpful. Ed may have a particular preference for\nsuch metaphors, and others\u2019 process may well be portrayed differently. However,\nin tune with the work of Johnson (1987), Lakoff and Johnson (1999), and others\n(e.g., in the field of NLP, Lawley & Tompkins, 2000), there seems merit in con-\nsidering space and time as underlying epistemological metaphors.\nThere also appear to be connections with the output characteristics of trans-\nformation. Thus for Ed, an internal sense of being in the centre appears linked to\nbeing increasingly at cause and suggests an increasing integration.\nA further aspect relevant to the management of change is that Ed\u2019s account\ntold of how he managed with reference to these dimensions, in effect by shaping\nor moving according to their configuration. For example, he was explicit about\nmanaging time in the period of limbo by telling his people to focus on a finite\ntimescale (the next 3 months) and about needing to \u201chold the split\u201d between what\nhe could and could not tell. Again we speculate that this inner dimension of\nchange management could be illuminating to explore in other cases.\nThe Imaginal\/Symbolic Dimension\nThere is also an imaginal, symbolic layer to Ed\u2019s inner process according to his\naccounts that relates particularly to Boyd\u2019s (1991) mytho-poetic perspective on\ntransformative learning (Table 3).\nThe transcripts contain some powerful metaphors, such as being in limbo\n(which clearly overlaps the spatial dimension with the symbolic) and divorce.\nThese illustrate the relevance of the mytho-poetic perspective of Boyd (1991) and\nothers.\nPerhaps the most explicit metaphor is an image that figures particularly in the\nsecond interview, that of a group of outcasts. This arose from a period when Ed\u2019s\nsection of the company was for legal and regulatory purposes out of contact with\nthe main company and had to move to a separate geographical location. This\nmetaphor is a strong image of exclusion. Being no longer a part of the organ-\nisation as it was and waiting for the unknown to reveal itself, he says, \u201cYes,\nwe\u2019re out on a limb . . . we are lepers, the group had to go and reside somewhere\nelse because . . . \u2018they are not as clean as the rest of us.\u2019\u201d\nEd\u2019s experience of going from a familiar, known world into \u201climbo,\u201d surviving\nhis ordeal, and eventually reconciling both the company\u2019s and his own future\nwith new \u201cmarriages\u201d has many potential parallels with the literature. For exam-\nple, Scott (1997) referred to a \u201cmythical journey\u201d (p. 45). Outside the field of\ntransformative learning, there is Campbell\u2019s (1985) notion of the \u201chero\u2019s jour-\nney,\u201d which he said consists of stages of separation, initiation, and return\nMapping Transformative Learning 159\n(Cairnes, 1998). Such transformative journeys are characterised by elements such\nas ordeals (Bartunek & Moch, 1994) and epiphanies, \u201cmoments of truth\u201d that\nhave \u201cthe potential for creating transformational experiences for the person\u201d\n(Denzin, 1989, p. 15), an idea reminiscent of Frick\u2019s (1987) description of a sym-\nbolic growth experience.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERPERSONAL INQUIRY PROCESS\nThe third main category concerns some features of the process of inquiry and\nof the interaction between learner and facilitator as distinct from the learner\u2019s in-\ntrapsychic process.\nThis involved spaces away from the action. In conventional terms, these con-\nstituted research interviews. However, we want to highlight that we regard these\ninterviews as an active and collaborative process of constructing whatever\nthe person came to regard as their learning. This is quite different from\nTable 3: Imaginal Themes\nImaginal Theme Possible Imaginal Roles\nMonth 1 The day of judgement Anticipation of Protector (shielding staff, holding split;\nbeing judged on the \u201cother side\u201d not passing on) \nWeighing up, scales Explorer\/voyager\nInto the unknown (the future) (\u201cI\u2019m \nreally in the unknown; it\u2019s that sort \nof unknown factor that really gets into \nyour belly.

In other words, it would be erroneous to\nsuppose that the person\u2019s learning had been formulated independently of and\nprior to the research.\nSecond, it is a public and relational process. This case involved a learner and a\ncollaborator\u2014a facilitator who supported the person in reflecting on his experi-\nence. Taylor (1998) noted that \u201crelational knowing, the role of relationships in the\nlearning process, has been given only minor attention by Mezirow in transfor-\nmative learning theory\u201d (p. 36). The discourse was by no means confined to the\nrational domain (Taylor, 1998). It was a sustained reflection and shared charac-\nteristics with Boyd\u2019s notion of discernment, especially a sense of grieving for loss.\nThird, time was an important dimension to the research in that the partici-\npant\u2019s perception of learning emerged over time, through a process of reflection\nand dialogue, and what might be termed indwelling, which Moustakas (1990) de-\nfined as \u201cthe heuristic process of turning inward to seek a deeper, more extended\ncomprehension of the nature or meaning of a quality or theme of human expe-\nrience\u201d (p. 24). The longitudinal dimension shows up differences over time rather\nthan relying on an analysis of data gathered at one point in time.\nThis is relevant to debate about the facilitation of transformative learning. For\nexample, how do we differentiate transformative learning in education from\nmodes of personal development such as psychotherapy? Taylor (1998) described\nMezirow\u2019s position as \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d and said \u201che tends to avoid or gives\nminimal attention to the deep analytical challenges associated with personal\ntransformation, such as its inherent emotive nature, the emphasis on personal\nself-awareness, and the need to resolve past life issues\u201d (p. 19). This may account\nfor Mezirow\u2019s (1991) views on ethics and facilitation that depending on one\u2019s\npoint of view might be described kindly as permissive. We note with interest the\nprominent metaphor of \u201cfostering\u201d (e.g., Taylor, 1998, p. 47), with its parental\nconnotations rather than for example \u201cfacilitation,\u201d which Mezirow uses at other\ntimes (e.g., Mezirow, 1997, p. 11).\nDiscussion \nThrough analysis of Ed\u2019s case we have synthesised a tentative map of transfor-\nmative learning through the lens of NLP. If we were to sum up Ed\u2019s learning, it\nappeared to be a process of coming to terms with the way his world changed\naround him and gradually experiencing himself more at cause than at effect. In\nsummary, themes resulting from the analysis comprised the following three main\ncategories:\n1. characteristics of the output or of the emergent understanding of the learner,\n2. characteristics of the person\u2019s inner process or journey,\n3. characteristics of the interpersonal process between learner and facilitator.\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nMapping Transformative Learning 161\nOutput characteristics included the capacity for a wider frame or perspective,\nprobably involving a less egoic, more detached view of a situation, including\n\u2022 a change at the level of identity (referring to Dilts\u2019s model of neurological levels);\n\u2022 changes also at the belief level in Dilts\u2019s model, represented by changes in what\nNLP calls complex equivalence and cause-effect patterns, and notably a movement\nfrom being at cause to being at effect;\n\u2022 evidence of paradoxical thinking, especially of change toward integrating or re-\nsolving dilemmas, and a movement away from either-or thinking;\n\u2022 emergence of a (new) core metaphor around which Ed\u2019s story (e.g., his revised\nunderstanding of himself and his world) could cohere.\nEd\u2019s case appears to match Mezirow\u2019s (1991) description of conditions for\n\u201cperspective transformation\u201d such that his situation can be regarded as an\n\u201cepochal dilemma such as death, illness, separation or divorce\u201d (p. 168).\nThe aforementioned account, especially with regard to the space-time dimen-\nsions, could be regarded as a story of renewed orientation to the world. Ed ap-\npears to have acquired a \u201cmore inclusive, differentiated, permeable (open to other\npoints of view), and integrated meaning perspective\u201d (Mezirow, 1991, p. 7) and to\nsome extent to have learned to \u201cnegotiate meanings, purposes and values criti-\ncally, reflectively and rationally instead of passively accepting the social realities\ndefined by others\u201d (Mezirow, 1991, p. 3).\nThe account also has characteristics relevant to Boyd\u2019s symbolic emphasis. For\nexample, Ed\u2019s process of separating and moving on from the old company, em-\nphasised by the metaphor of divorce as well as Ed\u2019s life stage, seems analogous to\nthe grieving process described by Scott (1997).\nThus, the case draws on both the Mezirow and Boyd perspectives, perhaps il-\nlustrating Grabove\u2019s (1997) view that these are interconnected. Although\nMezirow (1991) emphasised the significance of metaphor, his approach re-\nmains rationalist and ego-centred (Imel, 1998; Taylor, 1998). In tune with our\nexperience and preferences as educators, we support a more holistic perspec-\ntive and strongly support the contention that \u201ctransformation is not a ra-\ntional process . . . and cannot be pushed or planned for as in a goal-oriented,\ntechnical, rational process\u201d (Scott, 1997, p. 44).\nAnother relevant frame is that of Reason and Hawkins (1988), who talked of\nexplanation (an analytical mode) and expression (an aesthetic, meaning-making\nmode) as two complementary paths of inquiry. From this expressive mode, we\npondered what would symbolise the transformative learning process as we have\nexperienced it, and what came to us was the image of a labyrinth. Labyrinths are\nrepresentations of life\u2019s journey and also literally pathways for inner and spiritual\nreflection. They are found in spiritual traditions throughout the world\u2014the leg-\nendary labyrinth at Knossos in Crete, turf labyrinths in England, labyrinths in the\nNazca plain in Peru, and so on. A labyrinth differs from a maze in that a labyrinth\nhas only one path that one follows inward to a centre and then returns to the out-\nside; a maze is a puzzle, with alternative pathways. The image of the labyrinth res-\n162\nonates well for us with the notion of a period of inward focus, culminating in the\nemergence of a new core metaphor and an expanded worldview with which one\nreturns to the outer world. Such a process effectively creates a sacred space. This\nsymbol of the labyrinth may help to differentiate the process from more instru-\nmental models of learning.\nThe NLP frameworks employed seemed to permit both an explanatory\/\nanalytical and an expressive\/symbolic view of Ed\u2019s learning. The perspective of-\nfered by NLP may be elaborated further through McWhinney\u2019s (1997) four real-\nities model based on ancient systems of understanding including the four ele-\nments, represented also in Jung\u2019s map of psychological functions preferences and\napplied to NLP by Young (2001). Adopting McWhinney\u2019s terms for these four re-\nalities (unitary, sensory, social, and mythic), this case as we perceive it has done\nthe following:\n1. Attended in the sensory realm to what we have argued is a lack of evidence or\nempirical data to support concepts of transformative learning and illustrated the po-\ntential of NLP for helping to provide such evidence. The dimensions of space and time,\nalthough metaphoric and thus in principle related to the mythic realm, reflect Ed\u2019s in-\nner sensory world.\n2. Used NLP\u2019s language models to identify rules and beliefs held by Ed (e.g., the\ncomplex equivalences), which relate to the unitary realm.\n3. Included the mythic realm through the notion of emergent metaphor and\nthrough attending to the symbolic aspects of Ed\u2019s language (see Table 3).\n4. Represented the social realm less in the analysis than probably through the col-\nlaborative nature of the inquiry process and the coconstruction of Ed\u2019s stories.\nMcWhinney (1997) emphasised that change involves moving from one mode\nto another. Our reflection on Ed\u2019s experience is that although the mapping of his\nsensory and unitary reality appeared helpful, it was his growing awareness of the\nmythic dimension (catalysed perhaps through the social interaction of the re-\nsearch) and especially the resonance between the personal and organizational ex-\nperiences of divorce that proved most significant for him.\nA final conceptual issue concerns what might be termed a meta-characteristic\nof transformative learning. Transformative changes yield insights into the\nlearner\u2019s own epistemological processes, resulting not only in change to the exist-\ning map but also in change to the mapping process. In Bateson\u2019s (1973) terms,\nthis represents a higher logical level of learning. Possible evidence of this type of\nshift is in Ed\u2019s following statement: \u201cYes, very much so, and the message or the les-\nson from that is, nothing in life is as you think it is because that\u2019s your own per-\nception of what it is.\u201d\nThis reflexive characteristic may be an important aspect of the vexed question\nof how to define transformative learning. We perceive a strong need for the field\nto make use of conceptualisations of qualitative difference, such as Bateson\u2019s\n(1973) seminal paper on the notion of logical levels of learning. This is a model\nfamiliar in NLP as well as one to which Mezirow (1991) made reference and on\nJournal  of Transformative Education \/ Apri l  2005\nMapping Transformative Learning 163\nwhich McWhinney (1997) drew. Bateson\u2019s work has been influential on many\ntheories of change in organisations and human systems, for example Watzlawick\net al.\u2019s (1974) notion of first- and second-order change.\nIn conclusion, this case has illustrated the potential of frameworks taken from\nNLP to identify differences\u2014in this instance, linguistic differences\u2014that may\nhelp to codify transformative learning. These distinctions appear relevant to\nMezirow\u2019s (1991) emphasis on \u201cthe dynamics involved in modifying meanings,\nand the way structures of meaning themselves undergo changes\u201d (p. xii). In\nessence, the article offers a range of possible indicators and perspectives that NLP\nmay provide. We do not regard these as definitive, and we acknowledge the ten-\ntative and contested status of NLP in academic work. Instead, we offer these in-\ndicators as being of potential value in conversations about learning, especially to\ncomplement and perhaps critique different understandings and perceptions of\ntransformation.\nFinally, we reemphasise the issue of the evidence base in the literature of trans-\nformative learning. The literature often seems persuasive to us because we feel an\nintuitive connection with the topic, empathise with the concerns of authors, and\nrecognise the issues. But setting this aside, we cannot avoid feeling skeptical about\nthe concept of transformative learning and the claims made for the field. We hope\nthis article may contribute to the furthering of dialogue about and research into\ntransformative learning.\nNotes\n1.
