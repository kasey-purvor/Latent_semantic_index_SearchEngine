ISBN: 0-7494-2121-5.241 pages. \u00a322.50.\nA rising number of individuals and institutions\nare now developing multimedia courseware, or\ninteractive multimedia (IMM) as Rob Phillips,\ncalls it. This book sets out to offer practical\nadvice in projects focusing on general issues of\ndesign, development and project management.\nAlthough it includes an appendix that describes\nthe characteristics of a number of authoring\ntools, it is largely intended to be independent of\nany particular software.\nThe book is divided into two sections. The first\nseven chapters are devoted to all aspects of the\ndesign, development and production of an IMM\nproduct. The second section (Chapters 8 to 11)\nconsists of a number of case studies of projects\nwith which the author has been involved, and is\ndesigned to offer practical examples of the issues\ndiscussed in Section 1.\nChapter 1 provides an introduction to IMM, its\napplications and some factors to consider when\nconsidering embarking on a project. The second\nchapter focuses on educational and pedagogical\naspects of IMM. I felt that, for a book which is\nexplicitly concerned with the development of\neducational packages, this chapter is rather\nlimited in its scope. It does not pay enough atten-\ntion to this fundamental aspect of the design of\neffective educational courseware, and the treat-\nment of objectivist versus constructivist philo-\nsophy tends to be rather simplistic and polarized.\n74\nChapter 3 provides an overview of the whole\nprocess of IMM production as a precursor to\nthe more detailed coverage of each major\nelement. It covers the design process, the\ndevelopment team, and feasibility studies, as\nwell as a brief section on problems and possible\nsources of funding. This chapter also looks in\ndetail at prototyping methods and the\ndevelopment cycle, focusing on the roles of the\ndevelopment team and the problems generated\nby each individual role within the team.\nVisual and navigational design are covered in\nsome detail in Chapter 4. There is an extensive\nsection on graphic design which will be\nparticularly useful to project teams which do not\ninclude a member with specific skills in art and\ndesign. It presents a number of case studies of\nthe graphic design of some of the projects with\nwhich die author has been involved. There are a\nnumber of screen shots illustrating the case\nstudies, which, curiously for a book on multi-\nmedia, are in black and white. While some\ninclude the URL of a Web site at Curtin Uni-\nversity containing colour versions of the screens,\nI found this a rather cumbersome and incon-\nvenient method of comparing the remarks of the\ngraphic designers with my own evaluation of the\nscreens. I also felt that some attention should\nhave been paid in this chapter to content design\n- the process of taking existing educational\nmaterial and restructuring it for multimedia\npresentation.\nChapter 5, on development, contains fairly basic\ndescriptions of resources and development\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nenvironments. This is followed by a rather more\ntechnical discussion of programming techniques.\nPhillips does, though, acknowledge that this\nsection may. be too technical for non-\nprogrammers.\nThe book emphasizes the importance of an area\nof project management often overlooked by\nnovice developers and students by devoting a\nwhole chapter (6) to the subject, namely that of\nevaluation. The chapter addresses evaluation of\nboth process and product. During the\ndevelopment stage, document evaluation (do the\nprocesses work?) and formative evaluation (can\nusers use the program?) are the key areas\nidentified for analysis. There is some useful\nadvice on possible methods of implementing\nquality assurance procedures, including minutes\nof meetings, personal activity logs, status\nreports, problem reports and budget reviews. In\nterms of formative evaluation, techniques\nincluding expert review, student observation and\ninterview, automatic data collection and alpha\nand beta field tests, are discussed. At the imple-\nmentation stage, summative evaluation (was\nlearning effective in the short term?) and impact\nevaluation (was there long-term retention of\nknowledge?) is covered. For the former, Phillips\nsuggests measures such as traditional tests and\nexaminations, computer-based tests, or simula-\ntion and performance tests. To evaluate long-\nterm impact, he suggests that techniques\nincluding anecdotal records, observations and\ninterviews are employed. Though this advice is\nundoubtedly sensible, I am sceptical that much\nlong-term evaluation will actually be carried out\nin practice, since a developer is likely to have\nmoved on to the next project. However, Phillips\nrightly points out that evaluation is a vital part\nof the IMM development process and, used\nproperly, will enhance the quality of future\nproducts.\nThe final chapter of the first section deals with\nstandard issues of implementation and mainten-\nance. Implementation covers platform consider-\nations, delivery, installation and distribution.\nMaintenance covers debugging, version control\nand back-ups.\nSection 2 reviews four IMM projects carried out\nby the author and his team. These are all\nproducts to support the teaching of a nursing\nprogramme based at Curtin University. Each\ncase study follows the same format. The\nbackground to the project is described, including\nthe teaching context, objectives, feasibility study,\nfunding details and the development team. A\ndescription of the project itself includes the\ndevelopment model used, the content of the\nprogram, the user-interface, and evaluation and\nimplementation of the product. Finally, there\nare individual reviews and opinions of all team\nmembers involved in each project Team member\nreflect on their own experience of the project,\nthe problems and obstacles encountered, how\nthose problems were tackled, and how the\nexperience would inform their approach to\nfuture projects. My main criticism here is that\nthe best way of illustrating multimedia\napplications would have been the inclusion of a\nCD-ROM containing examples of the projects\ndescribed. This has to be a serious shortcoming\nfor a book of this nature.\nNotwithstanding this and some other minor\nreservations, this book will be useful to those\nwith no previous experience who are considering\nembarking on the development of an IMM\npackage. I would also recommend it as a\nsupplementary text to students of multimedia\napplications to provide a comprehensive\noverview, principally of project management in\nrelation to IMM development.\nElaine Pearson, University of Teesside\nAidan P. Moran, Managing Your Own Learning\nat University. A Practical Guide, Dublin:\nUniversity College Dublin Press, 1997. ISBN: 1-\n90062104-5.165 pages. \u00a35.95.\nWhen I received this book to review I wondered\nwhat I was going to be able to say about it - yet\nanother book on study skills. On reading it, my\nproblem was solved.\nThe author is a cognitive psychologist based at\nUniversity College Dublin and Director of its\nPsychology Research Laboratory. He backs up a\nplethora of handy hints about approaches to\nstudy with an extensive list of references and the\nuse of supportive research-based evidence. If, as\na student, your mission (and you must have\nownership of the problem if you want to make it\nhappen) is to be successful at university, you\nneed to get in the driving seat and assume\npersonal responsibility for your learning through\nbecoming an active, independent and self-\nmotivated leamer - this book explains how.\nChapter 1 is the key to the rest of the book,\nproviding a cogent summary of the salient issues\nand presenting a backdrop for the other nine\nchapters. Active learning requires active\n75\nReviews\nquestioning: 'Knowledge produced by deliberate\nintention [...] is richer, better linked to what we\nalready know and more durable than that\nyielded by random discovery'. So 'get real':\nchange your attitude to study, explicitly through\nmodifying your study behaviour, develop a set of\nlearning skills, and make the transition from\nbeing an accidental learner to a deliberate\nlearner.\nChapter 2 is on motivating yourself to study. It\nexplores the issue of motivation and increasing\nmotivation through goal-setting using the\nprinciples of being specific, measurable, action-\nrelated, realistic and time-based. Chapter 3\nexplores the sticky issue of time management and\nof planning and sticking to study timetables.\nChapter 4 covers how to take notes in lectures,\nadvising students to go into 'prospector' mode\nand to pick out the nuggets. Chapter 5 explains\nhow to take notes from books and journals.\nChapter 6 is about improving your concentration.\nChapter 7 is on learning to think critically -\nmaking sense by evaluating new information\nagainst your existing cognitive perspective, and\nstressing the importance of being sceptical. This\nchapter lists questions you can apply to your\nchosen subject and which promote your critical\nthinking. Chapter 8 considers remembering and\nunderstanding, explaining about memory and\nproviding lots of useful tips on how to enhance\nyour ability to remember. Chapter 9 is on\nplanning and writing essays, papers and research\nprojects. Chapter 10 tackles the thorny issue of\ndoing your best in examinations.\nIt is not often that I concur with the publisher's\ncomments, but this time I am forced to: 'Written\nin a lively entertaining style and laced with\ninteresting practical exercises, this book, which is\nbased on solid psychological principles, is\nessential reading for all students who wish to\nfulfil their academic potential in university'. This\nis not just another book on study skills. It is an\nextremely interesting read, and it is well-\nresearched and well-illustrated with lots of\ncartoons, boxes and tables. Whether you sit on\nthe student or a lecturer side of the fence, I\nwould recommend that you read it too.\nEleri Jones, University of Wales Institute, Cardiff\nDavid Little and Bernd Voss (eds.), Language\nCentres: Planning for the New Millennium,\nPlymouth: CERCLES, 1997. ISBN 0-905-227-\n80-8.314 pages. \u00a312.\nThis volume is a collection of papers from the\n76\n4th CERCLES Conference held in Dresden in\nSeptember, 1996. CERCLES is the Confedera-\ntion Europeenne des Centres de Langues dans\n1'Enseignement Superieur (European Confed-\neration of Language Centres in Higher Educa-\ntion - http:\/\/www.cml.plym.ac.uk.cerchp.html),\nand is well known amongst language-teaching\nspecialists for whom this book will have the\ngreatest interest. Others may also find some of\nthe papers of value. Certainly, the opening\nsection on learner autonomy is by no means of\nrelevance only to language learners. Similarly,\nthe sections dealing with study abroad and the\napplication of new technologies may be of\ninterest to a wider audience.\nThe book contains 23 papers organized them-\natically into six sections: Learner Autonomy,\nSelf-access and Counselling; Exploiting New\nTechnologies; Study Abroad; Languages for\nSpecific Purposes; Language Testing; and\nLanguage Centres; Issues and Case studies. The\npapers are by no means evenly distributed across\nthese six sections, and the distribution provides\nan interesting insight into some of the issues\nfacing language centres.\nThe section on learner autonomy has the\ngreatest number of papers (seven), followed by\nthe section on exploiting new technologies (five).\nThis bias clearly reflects the shift that it is going\non in language learning from tutor- to student-\noriented learning. The sections on study abroad\nand language for specific purposes (LSP) have\nthe least number of papers (two and one\nrespectively), and the remaining two sections\nhave four each.\nIt is interesting, too, if perhaps not as\nsignificant, that LSP and study abroad should\nhave been the least popular sections. Interesting,\nbecause in addition to these 23 papers, the\ncollection includes the text of the conference's\nkeynote address by Hans Joachim Meyer, the\nSaxon Minister for Learning and Art. In his\naddress, Herr Meyer takes up the issue of the\nstudy of 'academic language' in its own right. He\nargues, quite convincingly, that in preparing\nlearners for study abroad, we need to better\nunderstand that such preparation is an LSP\nissue. Too often such learners are regarded as in\nneed of remediation, when in reality they have\nnever been given the opportunity to acquire the\nappropriate skills in the first place. Academic\nstudy is a special subset of language usage and\nshould be treated as such. What is needed, Herr\nMeyer argues, is research into the characteristics\nAn-J Volume 6 Number 2\nof this language and then practical application\nof that research in language centres both in\npreparing students for academic study abroad\nand in supporting them when there.\nThis issue is touched upon again in the section on\nstudy abroad. Gilles Couzin's paper, 'Problems\nand difficulties of studying in a foreign academic\nenvironment', considers the impact of foreign\nstudy on the increasingly large number of\nstudents, Erasmus placement students for\nexample, who are not first and foremost linguists.\nThe paper considers a range of questions,\nlinguistic and otherwise, arising from such place-\nments. Similarly, Uwe Zemke's 'An assessment\nand evaluation of student performance on work\nplacements abroad' examines issues that arise\nwhen students undertake work rather than study\nplacements. These issues are further developed in\nthe section on LSP in Susan Price's 'Language\nand business: issues arising in interdisciplinary\nstudies'. Here the concern is expressly with\nproblem of training students, again not first and\nforemost linguists, in the language of their\ndiscipline: in this case, Business.\nThe two areas that account for more than half of\nthe collection, learner autonomy and new\ntechnologies, contain a wide range of materials\nmany of which address some aspect of the use of\nnew technologies'to support learner autonomy.\nIndeed, the alliance between autonomy and new\ntechnology is the express subject of Evelyne\nNamenwirth's paper 'Autonomie et nouvelles\ntechnologies: alliance fortuite?', which considers\nthe value of the new technology as a response to\nthe growing demand for autonomy in learning.\nSeveral papers in the section on autonomy\nconsider specific technological responses\n(Bucher, Poteaux and Frath; Poppi), and others\nconcentrate on the development of strategies for\nautonomous learning (Lutjeharms) or on the\npsychology of such learning (Ushioda;\nSimpson). Perhaps most interesting, however, is\nthe development of the concept of the language\nadviser developed by Marina Mozzon-\nMcPherson. In 'The language adviser: a new\ntype of teacher? An analysis of an emerging\nrole', she reports her work at the University of\nHull in providing an advisory service to students\nseeking to pursue autonomous language studies.\nThe role of the advisor is to help learners assess\ntheir degree of proficiency, identify deficiencies,\nand advise on an appropriate personal learning\nstrategy and the resources to support it.\nThe section on exploiting new technologies\ncontains several reports on the development and\nuse of specific resources. O'Rourke reports on\nthe continuing development of Autotutor at\nTrinity College, Dublin; and Cafazzo: on the\nSTACCATO project at Pisa which is concerned\nwith cataloguing and retrieving multimedia\nlanguage teaching materials. Schwienhorst, on\nthe other hand, reports on the use of a generic\nstrategy, the MOO, to support communication\nand collaborative learning; while Bangs and\nJones in their separate papers consider some\nmore general issues surrounding the use of the\nemerging technologies.\nThe eight papers in the remaining two sections\ntouch upon a range of issues from specialist\ndevelopments in Cloze testing (Grotjahn) and\ncompiling tests to support entrance exam-\ninations in Belarus (Simurova) to developing a\ncertification system for German Universities\n(Voss) and the management of language centres\n(Cecioni).\nOverall, this is a valuable collection of papers\nthat provides a useful insight into the issues and\nconcerns surrounding the role of language\ncentres in higher education at the moment and\nfor the foreseeable future. It is to be\nrecommended to centre managers and tutors\nalike.\nBruce Douglas Ingraham, University of Teesside\nJeroen J.G. van Merri\u00ebnboer, Training Complex\nCognitive Skills - A Four-Component Instruc-\ntional Design Model for Technical Training,\nEnglewood Cliffs, NJ: Educational Technology\nPublications, 1997. ISBN: 0-87778-298-9. 338\npages. $59.95.\nAnyone who is involved in the development of\ncomputer-based teaching and learning materials\nwill probably need to be familiar with four basic\ntypes of model. First, models of how people\nprocess and react to information; second, mental\nmodels that people build 'in their heads' as a\nresult of exposure to various (learning) experi-\nences; third, models about technology uptake\nwithin organizations (particularly, schools,\ncolleges, universities and the training depart-\nments of non-academic establishments); and\nfourth, models relating to instructional design\n(ID) and instructional systems development\n(ISD).\nAccording to the author of this book, its main\npurpose is to give a comprehensive description\nof the 'Four-Component Instructional Design'\n77\nReviews\n(4C\/ID) model. This model presents diverse\nguidelines and heuristics for the development of\ntraining programmes for complex cognitive skills\nin mainly technical domains. It embodies an\nintegration of theoretical developments and\nempirical results originating from a number of\nresearch projects involved with the training of\ncomplex cognitive skills. These projects have\nbeen largely conducted at the author's institution\n(the University of Twente in The Netherlands)\nstarting at the beginning of the 1980s and\ncontinuing through to the present time.\nThe book has 16 chapters. The first provides an\nintroduction to the model and outlines the\nstructure and contents of the book. The\nremaining chapters are organized into three\nparts. Part A (Chapters 2 to 5) deals with the\npsychology of complex cognitive skills. Part B\n(Chapters 6 to 10) is devoted to the analysis of\nsuch skills. Part C (Chapters 11 to 16) deals with\nthe design of training to support the\ndevelopment of complex cognitive skills.\nThe 4C\/ID model is described in terms of four\nbasic layers. These refer to activities or sets of\nmethods and techniques that are typically\nemployed by instructional designers in order to\nproduce effective training. The four layers\ninvolved are: principled skill decomposition (the\nbreaking down of a complex cognitive skill into\na hierarchy of constituent skills); analysis of\nconstituent skills and related knowledge; selec-\ntion and specification of instructional methods;\nand the development of a learning environment.\nNaturally, although the four layers are listed,\npresented and described in a linear order, within\nan actual project many switches and iterations\nbetween the layers usually take place.\nThe 4C\/ID model takes a 'middle' position\nbetween analytical and empirical approaches. It\ntherefore contains both descriptive and\nprescriptive elements. The descriptive elements\nare most discernible in Part A of the book. Here\nthe focus is on describing relationships between\ndifferent aspects of environments in which\nlearning takes place, learning processes and\nlearning outcomes. The prescriptive elements are\nmost apparent in Parts B and C. Part B provides\nmethods and techniques for the analysis of\ncomplex cognitive skills, as well as guidelines\nand heuristics indicating under which conditions\nparticular methods or techniques may be used.\nPart C provides an overview of instructional\nmethods and strategies for the design of learning\nenvironments, as well as guidelines and\n78\nheuristics to support the selection and integra-\ntion of strategies.\nThe book is comprehensive in its treatment of\ncomplex cognitive skills, and makes numerous\nreferences to related work through its extensive\nbibliography. Undoubtedly, it will prove both\nuseful and exciting reading for those who might\nwish to explore the use of the 4C\/ID model\nwithin their own areas of endeavour.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nRobyn Peterson, Training-Needs Assessment:\nMeeting the Training Needs for Quality\nPerformance (second edition), London: Kogan\nPage, 1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2568-7. 147 pages.\n\u00a316.99.\nTraining is the key to organizational and\npersonal growth and development. This book,\npart of Kogan Page's Practical Trainer series, is\naimed at anyone involved in the training process,\nfrom senior personnel, through line managers\nand supervisors to on-the-job trainers. This\nparticular volume will facilitate those involved in\nprovision of advice or consultancy in relation to\ntraining needs assessment. It covers not only the\n'what' and 'how' of training needs assessment,\nbut also gets into the 'why' things are done in\nparticular ways.\nWith a background of over 25 years in training,\nthe author, Peterson, emphasizes the importance\nof sifting organizational politics, irrelevancies\nand sensitivities to focus on the salient issues and\nachieve a thorough and systematic analysis of\norganizational performance requirements which\nshould drive training. Peterson opens with the\nassertion that 'quality training is usually tailored\ntraining', and goes on through seven chapters\n(the Contents page shows two Chapter Ones!)\nand one appendix to concisely present proven\ntips and techniques and guidelines to achieve a\nholistic approach to training-needs assessment.\nChapter 1 covers the process of training-needs\nanalysis, setting out a framework for the process\nto ensure cost-effectiveness, and stresses the\nimportance of feedback throughout the process\nto ensure continuous incremental improvement.\nChapter 2 explores the role of adviser, whether\ninternal adviser or external consultant, in the\ntraining-needs analysis process and issues arising\nfrom fear of change and management of change.\nChapter 3 covers the performance perspective,\ndefining behavioural objectives and the concept\nof performance sets, linking these to training.\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nChapter 4, on planning training-needs analysis\nwork, outlines the use of action appraisal, and\nwith a worked example demonstrates the\nprioritizing of issues using a factors chart in\ngood problem-solving style to develop a\ntraining-needs analysis process plan. Chapter 5,\non conducting the analysis, takes the reader\nthrough the process highlighting potential\npitfalls, and discusses how to present the\noutcome of the analysis to the client or organ-\nization. Chapter 6, on examining the potential\ntraining, provides specific models and guidelines\nfor analysing potential training or educational\neffectiveness, and checkpoints for ensuring that a\ntraining design is appropriate to the identified\ntraining needs. Chapter 7, on information tips\nand techniques, includes a range of practical\nhints on how to make the process more effective\nwhen working with client groups, how to design\na questionnaire as a data-gathering instrument,\nand how dynamic classification charts can be\nused to sort a variety of types of information.\nThe appendix includes a Personal Evaluation\nInventory for Skill with the training-needs\nanalysis process, and consists of 39 questions\nwhich, answered honestly, will generate a\npersonal agenda for action in terms of\nenhancing personal skills.\nWritten in straightforward warts and all, no-\nnonsense style, this book is an invaluable guide\nfor anyone contemplating training-needs assess-\nment, whether as client or consultant. It is an\ninvaluable resource, and even for those who have\nundertaken training-needs assessment pre-\nviously, it will bring together key information\nand issues for consideration in a lively and\ninformative manner.\nEleri Jones, University of Wales Institute, Cardiff\nMillsom Henry (ed), Using IT Effectively: A\nGuide to Technology in the Social Sciences,\nLondon: UCL Press, 1998. ISBN: 1-85728-795-9.\n201 pages. \u00a314.95.\nThis is a selection of papers, with some\nadditional material, presented at the 1995\nSoclnfo (CTI Centre for Sociology, Politics and\nSocial Policy) International Conference on\nTechnology and Education in the Social\nSciences. Despite the book's title, which would\ntend to indicate a broader use if IT within the\nsocial sciences than just in teaching and\nlearning, nearly all of the 16 papers focus on\neducational uses of IT, especially in higher\n. education, and despite the fact that many of the\npapers do deal specifically with the social-science\nissues, the volume will be of interest to readers of\nALT-J in whatever discipline they are working.\nThe book opens with a view of where we have\ncome from and where are heading by Peter\nCochrane which makes interesting (sometimes\nheady) reading. Stephen Heppell follows suit, in\na good piece, highlighting some of the problems\nwe face. Anne Campbell MP gives a (largely\nexpected) governmental view. This is followed by\nan excellent paper by Adrian Kirkwood on the\nsocial aspects of the impact of IT with some\ninteresting data. That ends Section 1, called New\nChallenges for Teaching and Learning.\nThe next section, concerned with developing\ncourseware, consists of some case studies and\nproject reports (Ruth Madigan et al; Stephen\nMorris and Jill Szuscikiewicz; David Garrett;\nStephen Scrivener and Susan Vernon). There is\nnot all that much here that is startingly new, but\nthe pieces are clear and reasonably well written.\nSection 3 offers four papers supposedly on\nimplementing CAL in the social sciences, but\nwhich could easily have been categorized under a\nmore general heading. The first of these, by\nGraham Gibbs and David Robinson, contends\nthat we should avoid the notion that CAL can\nreplace a teacher, and explains why. Vernon\nGayle takes a roughly similar line, arguing that\ntechnology in teaching is not necessarily a Good\nThing, a line also tangentially taken by Danny\nLawrence et al who maintain that we need to be\nwary of IT fanatics in our midst. These three\npartly negative - or at least sceptical - papers are\nfollowed by a generally more positive view, that\nof Ann Wilkinson who describes how CAL can\nbenefit the non-standard student.\nSection 4, on the effectiveness of IT in teaching\nand learning (though, again, not all of the four\npapers in this section fit well into this category),\nopens with a piece by Chris Turner on IT in\nsociology and the TQA in Scotland, arguing,\namong other things, for recognition in terms of\ncareer advancement of staff who successfully\nimplement CAL. I could not agree more, and I\nimagine most readers of this journal would be\nwith me. David Newlands et al give us a welcome\npaper on the difficulties of quantifying the\nfinancial costs of using IT for teaching purposes.\nThis question is rarely tackled directly in the\nliterature, and while the authors of the paper\nreach no hard conclusions, at least some of the\nproblems are identified (half the battle). The\nadvantages of using multimedia technology in\n79\nReviews\ncase studies is the theme of the next paper, by\nDavid Crowther et al, who also take financial\nand other costs into account but conclude that\ncase studies can be a cost-effective way of using\nIT in curricula. The final paper, by Duncan\nTimms, looks generally at obstacles and\nopportunities in teaching social sciences with the\nuse of IT, and draws together many of the points\nmade earlier in the book, ending suitably with a\nlook at future possibilities (by chance, with an\neditorial decision to put this piece at the end -\nwhere it fits best - or was it written after the\nfact?).\nAs with any set of conference papers, the quality\nvaries. There is some really good material which\nchallenges assumptions and puts forward\nexciting ideas without going overboard, and\namongst such material is some which is best\ndescribed as mediocre, but mediocre in the sense\nthat we have heard it many times before rather\nthan because it is poorly written or that the\nopinions and judgements put forward are\nunsupported. On the contrary, in nearly every\ncase the level of Writing is high (a velvet editorial\nglove, I suspect, given my own experience as an\neditor of books and journals), although it is\nirritating to turn to a reference, in the case of\nsome contributions only to find that it was a\nunpublished piece which therefore cannot be\neasily obtained. Still, that it is a very minor\nminus point. On the whole, this is a good set of\ncarefully selected proceedings.\nThere is a short glossary and an index, and a\nstimulating foreword by Howard Newby, Vice-\nChancellor of Southampton University. In it, he\nstates, talking of IT, that 'most developments\nover the next decade are known or knowable' (p.\nix). Of course, it depends on what he means by\n'knowable' (retrospectively, anything might be),\nbut if he means that we are certainly not in for\nany real surprises before the year 2008 ... well,\nonly time will tell. I would not be so sure.\nGabriel Jacobs, University of Wales Swansea\n80\n"}
