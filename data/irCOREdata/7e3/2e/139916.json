Yet, these projects\nand programmes such as the National Health Service national programme or the\nimplementation of the Avis Enterprise resource planning or the Sainsbury supply\nchain system (KPMG Management Consulting, 1994; The Standish Group\nInternational, Inc., 2007) often have a high rate of failure. It could therefore be\nconsidered that despite well-established best practice project management processes,\ncurrent project managers still appear to be ineffective in preventing project failure.\nProject and programme management, in its modern form, began to take root only a few\ndecades ago. Starting in the early 1960s, businesses and other organizations began to see\nthe benefit of organising work around projects and to understand the critical need to\ncommunicate and integrate work across multiple departments and professions. Standards\nin project management are various. Most dominant are those of the Project Management\nInstitute \u2013 PMI (2004) and the Association for Project Management \u2013 APM (2005). Those\noffered by the PMI are widely used and are considered to be a competency standard\n(Pender, 2001). The purpose of these \u201cconventional\u201d project management methodologies is\nto manage entities such as tasks, requirements and objectives in advance, and is reliant on\nhindsight as a predicator for future changes. Williams (2005, p.2) describes these bodies of\nknowledge as a \u201cself-evidently correct\u201d set of processes and techniques, which heavily\nemphasises the action of planning. The fundamental assumption of project management\nstandards such as PMI Body of Knowledge guide is that the project is decoupled from its\nenvironment. That is to say that, once the project is planned, changes should happen only\noccasionally. However, IT project failure is most commonly attributed to a lack of top\nmanagement involvement, a weak business case and inadequate risk management.\nThe highest ranked factor for project failure (Whittaker, 1999) is project risk management,\nthe systematic process of identifying, analysing, and responding to risks as project-related\nevents or conditions which are not definitely known and which have the potential of\nadverse consequences on a project objective (PMI, 2004). Despite well-established and\naccepted project risk management processes such as Prince2 (Office of Government\nCommerce \u2013 OGC, 2007) or PRAM (Chapman, 1997; APM , 2005), project managers\ncommonly perceive these processes as not effective for managing project uncertainties\n(Pender, 2001). Hence, this study addresses the research problem (RP) of whether\nrisk-related interventions influence the application of project risk management by project\nmanagers in the context of IT projects:\nRP. Do IT project managers think that risk-related factors constrain the effective use\nof project risk management?\nThe RP was empirically investigated in the context of IT projects. Organisations\ndelivering IT projects may include computer service providers (CSP). Firms in this line of\nbusiness include Unisys and IBM as stand-alone providers. In addition, many firms have\nthis function provided as an in-house support function. Typical services that are provided\nby include \u201cplanning, operation, implementation and use of computer hardware,\ncomputer software and computer personnel\u201d (Howard, 2001, p. 2). Examples of projects\ninclude \u201cRoll outs\u201d, the implementation of \u201cUser help desks\u201d structures or \u201cOutsourcing\u201d\nprojects. In 2001 in the UK, such services alone represented \u00a320 billion in turnover for\nthe stand-alone CSPs of which approximately 50 per cent of this service volume was\ndelivered through project work (Howard, 2001, p. 8). The strategic importance and\ncosts involved in developing IT systems have raised the stakes associated with the\nproject outcome.\nI empirically investigated the RP and research questions by using a grounded theory-\norientated research approach to explore concepts such as project risk management. The\nfirst phase of empirical research includes the use of grounded theory for exploring project\nmanagers\u2019 experiences in managing risk in IT projects. Unstructured interviews were\nused to enable me to fully understand how IT project managers manage risk, what risk-\nrelated interventions influenced their efforts to effectively and optimally manage risk and\nwhat influence these ultimately had on their achievement to meet project objectives they\nconsidered to be important. The data analysis followed an iterative process of proposing\npatterns from one case and checking these patterns with those in other cases. The\nprocess of proposing and checking came to a conclusive end once new patterns ceased to\nemerge and existing ones were confirmed.\nOnce I understood patterns that emerged about how, for example, which\ninterventions led to sub optimal or ineffective project risk management, a survey to test\nthese patterns on a wider population of project managers was conducted in order to\nfurther explain the relationships between the concepts explored. Overall, over 2,200\nproject managers who were members of the PMI and the APM received an invitation to\nparticipate in the online survey. The data analysis included descriptive as well as\nmultivariate regression techniques.\nThe findings show that IT project managers encountered difficulties in managing project\nrisk because of several risk-related interventions such as denial, characterised by\nanxiety among stakeholders due to the identification and analysis of risk. These\ninterventions tended to influence project risk management in such a way that project\nmanagers overlooked risks that later materialised and resulted in an adverse effect on\nthe project outcome. Hence, these risk interventions contributed to the inability of\nproject managers to prevent risks from materialising and thus negatively influencing\nthe achievement of the project objectives of scope, cost and time and other objectives\nIT project managers consider to be important such as team satisfaction (Table I).\nThis study contributed to our knowledge of managing risks as follows: first, it shed light\non how effectively project managers think they have applied project risk\nmanagement and to what degree risks influenced the project outcome. Second, it\nincreased the understanding of what kind of risk-related interventions prevail in IT\nprojects and how these risk interventions constrain IT project managers in effectively\nmanaging risk These findings are important given the lack of current evidence about\nhow \u201coptimal\u201d project risk management is applied. Through the management of such\ninterventions such as denial and avoidance of uncertainty, the use of project risk\nmanagement may be improved.\nContext of the thesis\nThe research study was part of a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis undertaken at the\nUniversity of Bath in the UK. The PhD was funded by the Economic and Social\nResearch Council (ESRC), one of the UK\u2019s leading research funding and training\nagencys addressing economic and social concerns.\nAs part of fulfilling its mission, the ESRC provides studentships for the support of full- or\npart-time postgraduate courses. In total, + 3 studentships are four year awards\ncomprising of linked Masters and PhDs (applied for together). About \u201c1 + 3\u201d is a\ngeneric term used by ESRC to denote one year of Master\u2019s research training plus three\nyears of study towards a PhD. (For part-time students this equates to a 2 + 5\nprogramme.) About \u201c +3\u201d means that a candidate has already completed the research\ntraining year and is only applying for a three-year period to complete the PhD study.\nThese studentships provide a training programme for full- and part-time students who\nhave not previously completed a programme of substantive research training. Each\nMaster of Philosophy \u2013 MPhil\/PhD student receives personal supervision from one or\nmore members of academic staff with expertise in the relevant area. This relationship\nis a key aspect of the degree. In addition, great emphasis is placed on research training\nto support students throughout their research degree and to build a community of\nresearch scholars. At the University of Bath (School of Management), PhD students were\nexpected to attend the core units of the MPhil and complete five associated assessments\n(5,000-6,000 words long). This research training programme included modules on:\n\uf0b7 research design;\n\uf0b7 research methods (quantitative, and qualitative); and\n\uf0b7 research philosophy.\n\uf0b7\nA range of other training opportunities such as \u201cProject management for PhD\nstudents\u201d or \u201cCommunication skills and assertiveness\u201d were also available through the\nuniversity.\nThe findings of this government funded PhD study were consequently published (Kutsch\nand Hall, 2005). Similar to Pender\u2019s (2001) work, this study offers evidence to counter\nargue the \u201cself-evidently\u201d correctness of deterministic and rational risk management\nprocessed successfully by the PMI (2004), OGC or the APM (2005) and highlights the need\nto include behavioural aspects into the management of risk.\nTable 1 Intervening conditions in project risk management\nDiscussion and conclusion\nResearch has shown that many IT projects fail because scope, cost and time objectives\nare not met despite the existence of \u201cself-evidently\u201d correct best practice project\nmanagement standards. This study aimed to investigate the influence of risk-related\ninterventions on the specific project management process of project risk management\non the outcome of IT projects. Literature indicates that project managers in general\nappear to have problems \u201coptimally\u201d preventing risks from adversely influencing the\nproject outcome. The exploratory and explanatory findings of this study suggest that IT\nproject managers face specific risk mediators which tend to adversely influence the\neffective use of project risk management and which ultimately affect the project\noutcome of IT projects.\nOverall, the key discipline of project risk management lacks the optimality that is\nassumed in best practice standards. Renn (1998, p. 64) argues in this context that the\nset of assumptions of a mainly objective analysis of risk \u201cis a virtue as much as it is a\nshortcoming\u201d. The findings underline the criticism of some researchers such as Ritchie\nand Marshall (1993), that the normative model of expected utility theory (EUT) as an\nunderlying model for project risk management is inadequate to describe how decision\nmakers manage risks. In addition, it appears that the findings of this study about the\ninfluence of interventions on project risk management also apply in a wider context\nand are not confined to the specific context of IT project management. In other areas\nsuch as organisation theory, the resistance to managing uncertainties because of\ndenial, avoidance, delay and ignorance seems to be confirmed through research being\nconducted in various settings. This firstly may underline the robustness of the findings of\nthis research and secondly indicates that the optimal conditions of EUT as underlying\nassumptions of best practice standards in project risk management tend to be violated.\nOn the one hand, an action by an IT project manager to delay risk response actions may\nbe described as irrational, at least under the premise that those mediators may not lead\nto the optimal choice of reducing the impact of uncertainties on the project objectives\nof scope, cost and time. On the other hand, Otway (1992) argues that a person who\nonly focuses on the statistical probability of threats and their impacts and ignores any\nother information would be truly irrational. Hence, a project manager would act\nsensibly by, for example, rating the importance of a long-term relationship between\nprovider and customer higher than the actual short-term avoidance of disruptions\nthrough the management of project risk. Therefore, if people persistently act in violation\nof EUT, the account of rationality according to EUT may be questioned (Anand, 1993).\nFurthermore, the practical implications of the interventions established in this study have\nto be taken into account in order to understand the limitations of project risk\nmanagement and, if possible, to manage them.\nUnder the assumption that risk interventions can be prevented, the influential risk\nmediator of avoidance, ignorance and denial of uncertainty may be averted by risk\nactors through the prevention of decision-maker related factors of uncertainty:\ntolerance of ambiguity, experience and locusof control.\nTolerance of ambiguity refers to the extent to which an individual seeks clarity and\nspecifies vague and unclear information. Research has shown that persons with a\nhigher degree of tolerance towards ambiguity spend more time scanning the\nenvironment for the purpose of uncertainty reduction (Ashill and Jobber, 1999;\nDollinger, 1984; Ramgopal, 2003; Wang and Chan, 1995). In a project environment,\nrisk actors with a higher tolerance of ambiguity may perceive uncertainty as an\nopportunity instead of a threat and may seek to overcome uncertain situations and try\nto seek consensus on conflicting risk-related information with the result that the\nmediators of avoidance, ignorance and denial of risks are decreased.\nA further way of preventing risk mediators from influencing project risk\nmanagement is experience. Ignorance and avoidance of uncertainty may impose fewer\nbarriers to optimal project risk management depending on the amount of variety and\nduration of experience risk actors have gained. The problem of complete unawareness\nof threats as well as conflicts about what risks are \u201ctrue\u201d may be avoided through the\ninvolvement of risk actors with greater experience or the greater accumulation of\nrelevant historic data in the decision-making process in project risk management.\nIn addition, delay, avoidance and denial of uncertainty by risk actors may be decreased\nwith increased locus of control. Locus of control is the amount of control, which an\nindividual has over his life (Miller and Jean-Marie, 1986). In a project, this may be the\nextent to which a project manager has control over internal and external factors. If\nmanagers perceive their environment as more controllable (internal locus of control),\nthey tend to be more proactive (Govindrajan, 1989). Lack of perceived control might arise\nthrough disagreements or lack of consensus, a characteristic of the mediator of\navoidance of uncertainty (Morgan and Henrion, 1990). Furthermore, risk actors who find\ntheir environment to be less controllable may perceive it as more threatening with the\nresult that they may deny risks (Ashill andJobber, 1999; Ashill and Jobber, 2001). Hence,\nin a project environment, risk actors with a high degree of internal locus of control may\ncontribute to reducing the mediator of delay, avoidance and denial of uncertainty.\nRisks may, however, always remain inadequately managed and cause disruptions to\nprojects. Two suggestions to compensate for the impact of materialised uncertaintyis\nthe arrangement of multi-layer reserves to absorb the impact of unforeseen events\n(Pender, 2001) or adding contingencies to establish a fit between the environment and\nthe project\u2019s structural and process characteristics (Barki et al., 2001). The adaptation\nto unforeseen situations may include project managers being flexible and dealing with\nsituations only as they arise and with information only when it becomes available\n(Pavlak, 2004). With the prospect of unsuspected changes in the project, the project\nmanager may want to prepare himself to be able to react to any unpredicted\ndisruptions in the project. In this respect, flexibility is considered an important way of\ndealing with uncertainty (Dreyer and Gronhaug, 2004; Eppink, 1978; Gustavsson, 1984;\nLeuuw and Volbreda, 1996; Carlsson, 1989). In project management, although\nconsidered to be a critical success factor, flexibility is unacknowledged (Hornby, 2001).\nAlthough the concept of flexibility addresses residual uncertainty caused by risk\nmediators on the management of risk, it has been given little attention in project risk\nmanagement literature so far.\nUnless we stop being human and become godlike creatures, our environment is\ncharacterised by interventions such as lack of knowledge, distrust or discomfort.\nThose interventions faced by IT project managers may impose a barrier to effective\nand optimal project risk management. This research leads to a better understanding of\nwhich interventions exist in IT projects and how they influence the effective use of\nproject risk management. Consequently, this understanding may result in an\nimprovement in the application of project risk management by project managers. This\nmeans, that the fundamental principles of an expected utility-based project risk\nmanagement process may have to be taken into account and questioned. As a result,\nIT project managers may have to reduce the impact of risk interventions on the use of\nproject risk management or be prepared for materialising risk in order to minimise the\neffect of uncertainty which materialises during a project with adverse consequences on\nthe achievement of project objectives, and ultimately to avoid project failure.\nReferences\nAnand, P.
