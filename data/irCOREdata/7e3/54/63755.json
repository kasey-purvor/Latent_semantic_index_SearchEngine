It lies within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), with the \nPolar Front (PF) to the north, and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF) looping anticyclonically \naround the island from the south before retroflecting to the east (Meredith et al., 2003b; Orsi et \nal., 1995; Thorpe et al., 2002). A comparatively narrow shelf region (around 50-150 km) \nseparates the island from this adjacent deep ocean regime, and whilst shelf and offshelf waters \nfrequently have different hydrographic properties (Brandon et al., 2000; Brandon et al., 1999; \nMeredith et al., 2005), cross-shelfbreak exchange of waters has been evidenced by drifters and \nvarious other means (Meredith et al., 2005; Meredith et al., 2003a).  \n \nThe waters around South Georgia are characterized by high levels of biological productivity, and \nplay a key role in supporting vast colonies of both marine and land-based predators, including \nAntarctic fur seals, albatrosses, penguins and whales (see Atkinson et al. (2001) for a review). \nLocal availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is key to the success of the South \nGeorgia predator colonies, since it constitutes a primary food source. The krill population at \nSouth Georgia is not self-sustaining however (Everson, 1984), but rather is supplied from \nbreeding grounds farther to the west, with the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Orkney Islands and \nthe Weddell Sea having been highlighted as potential source regions (Murphy et al., 2004b; \nMurphy et al., 2007). The role of advection by the ACC in supplying krill to the South Georgia \necosystem has been postulated by various workers (e.g. Fach et al., 2002; Hofmann et al., 1998; \nMurphy et al., 2004a).  \n 5\n \nInterannual variability in the properties of the waters surrounding South Georgia has been \nobserved by a number of authors. Early observations (1920s and 1930s) showed that extremes in \nocean temperature coincided with those in air temperature as recorded at Grytviken (a whaling \nstation on South Georgia, now disused), suggesting a link to large-scale atmospheric conditions \n(Deacon, 1977). Whitehouse et al. (1996) used data from around South Georgia collected \nbetween 1926 to 1990 to demonstrate a link between anomalous ocean temperature and the \nduration of fast-ice in the southern Scotia Sea (South Orkney Islands) the preceding winter. \nMurphy et al. (1995) noted that the fast-ice record appears to reflect circumpolar changes, and \nobserved a regular precessional pattern in sea-ice distribution that is reflected in the South \nOrkney fast-ice series. These observations again imply the local response at South Georgia to \nlarge-scale (basin- or greater) climatic forcing.  \n \nFollowing these works, an analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) recovered \nimmediately adjacent to South Georgia showed significant correlations with interannual \nvariability in the El Ni\u00f1o regions of the tropical\/equatorial Pacific (Trathan and Murphy, 2003). \nA time lag of around 3 years was obtained for positive anomalies in the equatorial Pacific \nvariability to be reflected as positive anomalies at South Georgia; this was attributed to the \ntimescale involved in the advective transfer of ocean anomalies from the Pacific to this region of \nthe Atlantic. Within the southern parts of the ACC, winter temperatures approach or reach the \nfreezing point, hence winter SST anomalies are limited in their range. However, this does not \ncontradict the apparent multi-year persistence of the SST anomalies, since the winter signals are \n 6\ntransferred to the sea ice field, which shows anomalies in extent and\/or concentration in response \nto SST anomalies \u2013 this is the sea ice \u201cmemory\u201d effect (e.g. Gloersen and White, 2001). \n \nMore recently, however, an analysis of in situ hydrographic data by Meredith et al. (2005) has \nindicated that variability associated with ENSO (the El Ni\u00f1o\/Southern Oscillation phenomenon) \ncan impact on South Georgia on a much more rapid timescale than that highlighted by Trathan \nand Murphy (2003). Meredith et al. (2005) noted a response in ocean temperature around South \nGeorgia to the intense 1997\/8 El Ni\u00f1o event on a short timescale (order of a few months), and \neven an instance of direct atmospheric forcing of the ocean surface temperature (i.e. a zero-lag \natmospherically-forced response in the South Atlantic to ENSO variability). It was noted that the \n1997\/8 event was atypical in terms of intensity, so the high-latitude response associated with it \nmay also have been unusual. Nonetheless, Murphy et al. (submitted) found that ecosystems \nparameters at South Georgia could best be represented in a conceptual model when the possibility \nof direct atmospheric forcing of climate variability was included. It is important to note that all El \nNi\u00f1o events are different, and a comprehensive appreciation of the forcings of the physical and \necological system at South Georgia requires that we develop an understanding that encompasses \nall variability observed. \n \nKwok and Comiso (2002) used a 17-year series of remotely-sensed SST to investigate the high-\nlatitude signature of ENSO in the Southern Hemisphere. They demonstrated that positive \ntemperature anomalies and ice edge retreat in the Pacific sector were associated with El Ni\u00f1o \nepisodes. They also noted that a negative bias in the Southern Oscillation Index during this period \n(i.e. a tendency toward more El Ni\u00f1o events than La Ni\u00f1a events), which will have affected the \n 7\nlong-term mean SST. A larger-scale view of Figure 3c of Kwok and Comiso (2002) is given here \nin Figure 2, which shows correlation of southern hemisphere SST with the monthly Bivariate \nENSO Time Series (BEST) index (Smith and Sardeshmukh (2000); fuller details of the SST data \nand BEST ENSO index are given in Section 2 below).  \n \nOf particular note in Figure 2 are the alternating bands of positive and negative correlation \nextending from the equatorial Pacific to the high-latitude Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. \nThis is a well-known pattern noted previously by many authors (e.g. Trenberth et al., 1998) that \nis associated with a climatological Rossby wave train (see Turner (2004) for a review). The \nmechanisms whereby ENSO can generate SST anomalies in the Southern Ocean have been \ninvestigated by various authors. For example, Li (2000) used an atmospheric general circulation \nmodel coupled to a slab mixed-layer ocean, and found that SST anomalies were generated in the \nPacific sector of the Southern Ocean by modifications to the heat flux balance at the air-sea \ninterface associated with changes in cloud cover and radiation. (Our Figure 2 reproduces the main \nfeatures of Figure 1a of Li (2000)). In particular, it was noted that positive SST anomalies are \nfound in the western part of the South Pacific during the summer months of El Ni\u00f1os. \n \nAlso discernible in Figure 2 is a negative anomaly in the southwest Atlantic (around 50\u00b0S, 30\u00b0W) \nthat coincides with a positive anomaly in the South Pacific. This is a manifestation of what has \nbeen termed the Antarctic Dipole (Yuan and Martinson, 2000), a mode of variability that displays \nan out-of-phase relationship between anomalies (including sea ice cover and air temperature) in \nthe central\/eastern Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean and the Atlantic sector. A number of \nstudies have investigated the mechanisms forcing this dipole, including the relative roles of \n 8\nadvection by the ACC and coupled air-sea-ice interaction, and its connection to ENSO is now \nwell established (e.g. Holland et al., 2005). \n \nIn addition to ENSO, there are other modes of climate variability that have the potential to induce \nsignificant interannual variability in the ecosystem at South Georgia. Of particular interest is the \nSouthern Annular Mode (SAM), the leading mode of extratropical climate variability in the \nSouthern Hemisphere (Thompson and Wallace, 2000). Characterised by a large-scale alternation \nof atmospheric mass between a node centred over Antarctica and an annulus over the lower-\nlatitude Southern Ocean, it is associated with a meridional shift in the position and intensity of \nthe westerly winds (Hartmann and Lo, 1998).  \n \nSeveral authors have noted that impact that the SAM can have on the surface temperature of the \nSouthern Ocean, based on both modeling and observational evidence (e.g. Hall and Visbeck, \n2002; Lovenduski and Gruber, 2005; Sengupta and England, 2006). The results of these studies \nare reprised in Figure 3, which shows the correlation of the SAM index with southern hemisphere \nSST (note that this Figure is for a 1 month lag between the SAM and SST; this is when \ncorrelations are highest, as is demonstrated below. Correlations remain high at marginally longer \nlags, up to around 4 months). Of particular note is the band of positive correlations along \napproximately 40\u00b0S, which is interrupted in the South Pacific and flanked to the south by a band \nof negative correlations. This circumpolarity, with a disjoint in the South Pacific, is characteristic \nof the SAM. The southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (including the entire Scotia \nSea) shows positive correlations with the SAM. Also apparent in Figure 3 are bands of \nalternating positive and negative correlations in the South Pacific, similar in form to those shown \n 9\nin Figure 2. This is evidence of some covariability between ENSO and SAM, and the potential \ndynamical connections between them are already under investigation (e.g. L'Heureux and \nThompson, 2006). \n \nRecently, a number of papers have made advances in understanding the response of the South \nGeorgia and South Atlantic ecosystem to interannual changes in local SST (e.g. Leaper et al., \n2005; Forcada et al., 2005; Trathan et al., 2006; Murphy et al., submitted; Murphy et al., 2007), \nemphasizing the importance of understanding the factors that control SST here, their timescales, \nmechanisms, and how they are likely to change into the future. These papers have concentrated \npredominantly on links with ENSO at long lags (order of a few years). Other studies have also \nshown that sub-decadal climate fluctuations can impact on ecosystems at high southern latitudes, \nwith the impact of ENSO on oceanographic and sea ice variation at the western Antarctic \nPeninsula (WAP) being noted, with consequences for the dynamics of krill and their predators \n(Fraser and Hofmann, 2003; Quetin and Ross, 2003).  \n \nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the roles of the two leading modes of high-\nlatitude southern hemisphere climate variability (ENSO and the SAM) in determining interannual \nchanges in SST around the island of South Georgia and in the southwest Atlantic sector of the \nSouthern Ocean. Since these are large (planetary or hemispheric) modes of variability, by \nnecessity the analysis addresses comparable scales. The purpose is to understand the timescales \nand mechanisms by which the interannual variability is generated, an important precursor to \nenabling predictions of how the system might change in the future. The understanding we gain, in \n 10\nparticular of the processes that transmit the signals to the southwest Atlantic, adds insight into the \noperation of the regional and local ecosystem. \n \nData \n \nFor this paper, we use the Bivariate ENSO Time Series (BEST) index (Smith and Sardeshmukh, \n2000). Traditionally, the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index has been used as a measure of ENSO strength in the \ntropical Pacific, however the BEST index offers advantages in the inclusion of some explicit \natmospheric processes. (For comparison, the BEST and Ni\u00f1o 3.4 indices show a correlation of \n0.81 based on monthly-mean data, and 0.98 for monthly data smoothed with a 2-year filter). \nMonthly values of the BEST index were obtained from the Climate Diagnostics Center (CDC) of \nthe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (data available at \nhttp:\/\/www.cdc.noaa.gov\/people\/cathy.smith\/best\/). The SAM index we use was obtained from \nthe Climate Prediction Center of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). \nMonthly values were used, obtained from http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/. \n \nThe SST data we used are those produced by Reynolds et al. (2002), obtained from the NOAA \nCDC. The data are optimum interpolation SST values, produced on a one-degree grid using in \nsitu and satellite SST, plus SST simulated by sea-ice cover. Data are available at \nhttp:\/\/www.cdc.noaa.gov\/cdc\/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html covering the period 1981 to 2005. Meredith \net al. (2005) examined a series of images from this dataset during a period of in situ data \navailability around South Georgia, and found that the spatial and temporal coverage of the \n 11\nremotely-sensed data was useful in explaining the observed in situ changes in surface water \nproperties.  \n \nSea ice concentration data were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, having \nbeen derived using Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM\/I passive microwave data (data available \nat http:\/\/nsidc.org\/data\/docs\/daac\/nsidc0051_gsfc_seaice.gd.html). Surface wind stress data used \nwere obtained from the ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis covering the period 1957 to 2002 (Uppala et \nal. (2005); see also http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/research\/era\/), though here we only use data that \noverlap temporally with the satellite-derived SST data. Marshall (2003) identified ERA40 as \nbeing the reanalysis that currently best represents atmospheric circulation at high southern \nlatitudes during the satellite era. \n \nFor the present paper, we derived anomalies of SST, wind stress and ice concentration by \nremoving the mean seasonal cycle from the time series of each gridpoint in the global fields. Sea \nice extent was derived by extracting the northernmost occurrence of the 15% sea ice \nconcentration value along a given line of longitude in each monthly sea ice field, and anomalies \nof these time series were derived by removing the mean seasonal cycle. \n \nResults \n \nFrom the global gridded SST product, we extracted a time series of SST from 53.5\u00b0S, 32.5\u00b0W, \nimmediately adjacent to South Georgia and in an area we believe to be suitably representative. \n(The results obtained are not critically dependent on the exact location chosen). This is used as \n 12\nour baseline series of South Georgia SST, and is shown in Figure 4 alongside (a) the BEST \nENSO index, and (b) the SAM index. Several features are apparent, including the very cold \nconditions around South Georgia in 1998 noted previously by Meredith et al. (2005), and \nconnected to the strong 1997\/98 El Ni\u00f1o event. These same series are shown in Figure 5, but \nsmoothed with a 2-year filter to illustrate more clearly any relationships between the series on the \ninterannual periods of interest here. The connections between the series are more immediately \napparent in the smoothed series, with South Georgia SST showing a near-antiphase relationship \nwith ENSO and a nearly in-phase relationship with the SAM. We note that the ENSO and SAM \nseries show evidence of co-variability; the degree to which this is due to dynamical interaction \nbetween these modes (e.g. L'Heureux and Thompson, 2006) as opposed to an artifact of the way \nthe series were calculated is part of an ongoing investigation.  \n \nFigure 6 shows simple cross-correlation functions for these same series. The solid curve in this \nfigure denotes correlations based on the monthly anomalies, whereas the dashed line shows the \nsame cross-correlations but with the series initially smoothed with a 2-year filter. The convention \nwe use for this figure, and in other places in this paper, is that we arbitrarily consider the \natmosphere to be the forcing function, with positive lags indicating atmosphere leading the ocean. \nThe cross-correlation of South Georgia SST and ENSO show features broadly consistent with \nthose observed already by Trathan and Murphy (2003), most notably positive correlation at \naround 30 months lag, and a negative correlation at around 5 months lag. The cross-correlation of \nSouth Georgia SST with the SAM shows a positive correlation at short lags, peaking around 1-2 \nmonths. It also shows correlations at longer periods (around 2-3 years). As a rough guide, the \n95% and 99% significance levels for the zero-lag correlations (calculated as per Trenberth \n 13\n(1984)) are given in the caption of Figure 6. It should be noted, however, that sample cross-\ncorrelation functions can be deceptive, as the sample estimate is a function of the convolution of \nthe autocorrelation functions of the individual times series, leading to often severe smearing of \nthe r-values as a function of lag, including smearing of the cross-correlation function into lags for \nwhich there is no true correlation, and leading to unreasonably large bias with larger lags. \nHowever, they are very useful to help visualize and evaluate the relationship between the series, \nand are shown here for this purpose. \n \nMore rigorous tests of statistical significance and physically-meaningful connections are \nprovided by cross-spectral analyses. These are shown in Figures 7 and 8 for South Georgia SST \nwith ENSO and the SAM respectively. For these, we calculated power spectral densities using \nWelch\u2019s method of averaged periodograms. The signals were divided into overlapping sections, \neach of which was detrended and windowed with a Hanning window. Coherence functions were \nthen derived as the absolute components of the cross-spectral density squared divided by the \nproduct of the power spectral densities. Significance levels were derived using equivalent degrees \nof freedom that depended on the length of the series used and the width of the window, as per \nEmery and Thomson (1997).  \n \nFor the interannual frequencies of interest here, significant coherence is observed between South \nGeorgia SST and ENSO at periods of approximately 18 months and longer. The phase spectrum \nconfirms the near-antiphase relationship between the series, consistent with the significant \nnegative correlation at short-period lag observed in Figure 6. For South Georgia SST and the \nSAM (Figure 8), significant coherence is observed for periods of around 25 months and longer. \n 14\nThe phase spectrum shows a tendency toward a nearly in-phase relationship, again consistent \nwith the positive correlation at short lags observed in the cross correlation (Figure 6). Note that \nfor both the SAM and ENSO, the short time-lag relationships observed in the cross correlations \n(order of a few months or less) dominate the cross spectra. \n \nCross spectra and linear cross correlations can be informative regarding the timescales on which \nspecific processes influence others, and any potential lags. They do not, however, provide spatial \ninformation with which to interpret the functions obtained. Spatial maps of correlation can help \nwith this, especially when viewed across a range of lags. Figures 2 and 3 showed the \ninstantaneous (or near-instantaneous) southern hemisphere \u201cfootprints\u201d of ENSO and the SAM, \nand, of particular interest to us, illustrate their high-latitude impacts. Complementary to these, \nFigure 9a shows the spatial map of correlation of our South Georgia baseline SST time series \nwith hemispheric SST. The correlation is unity, by definition, at the location from which the \nbaseline SST was extracted; the \u201cbullseye\u201d centred on South Georgia shows the spatial extent of \nthe anomaly that our baseline series represents. \n \nFigure 9a, which is for zero lag between South Georgia SST and hemispheric SST, shows the \ninfluence of both ENSO and the SAM. Note in particular the alternating bands of positive and \nnegative correlation in the equatorial and South Pacific, indicative of the atmospheric Rossby \nwave train that carries ENSO signals to high latitudes (c.f. Figure 2). Figure 9a also shows very \nclearly that positive anomalies in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (including \nSouth Georgia and the Scotia Sea) coincide with negative anomalies in the Pacific sector. This is \nthe characteristic pattern of the Antarctic dipole, at one node of which sits South Georgia. The \n 15\ninfluence of the SAM is also discernable in Figure 9a (c.f. Figure 3), with a band of positive \ncorrelations along 40\u00b0S, flanked by negative correlations to the south, and with the negative node \nof the dipole coinciding spatially with the interruption to the circumpolar SAM signal in the \nSouth Pacific. Note that, in Figure 3, the whole Scotia Sea (including South Georgia) was \ncovered by a positive correlation as part of the SAM pattern; this is the same area that is covered \nby positive correlations in Figure 9a. \n \nExamining maps of lagged spatial correlations is often informative when the system under study \ninvolves advection of anomalies. Figure 9(b-f) shows such lagged correlations, for 3, 6, 12, 18 \nand 24 months respectively. It can be seen in these figures that the anomaly centred on South \nGeorgia in Figure 9a is observed progressively farther westward (i.e. farther \u201cupstream\u201d in the \nACC) at longer lags between South Georgia SST and southern hemisphere SST. For 3 months \nlag, the anomaly extends through Drake Passage, and for 6 months lag it flanks the WAP. At 24 \nmonths lag, the anomaly is roughly in the centre of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Note \nthat at this lag, the whole pattern of anomalies in the South Pacific has reversed, i.e. we see a La \nNi\u00f1a-like pattern at zero lag and an El Ni\u00f1o\u2013like pattern at 24 months lag (compare Figure 9a \nwith 9f). \n \nThis movement of the anomaly in the ACC has been interpreted previously as the cause of the \nlong-period (2-3 year) connection between ENSO and South Georgia SST, and the results shown \nhere do not contradict this. Note, however, that at 18 months lag, the magnitude of the correlation \nwithin the anomaly in the South Pacific (circled in Figure 9e) is actually slightly less than it is at \n24 months lag. This is counterintuitive if one presumes that the anomaly is created in the south or \n 16\nsouthwest Pacific (via processes investigated by e.g. Li (2000)), and is then simply advected in \nthe ACC toward South Georgia, since under this scenario the correlation would increase \nmonotonically with decreasing lag. That this does not occur is evidence that a purely advective \nprocess cannot be responsible for transferring and sustaining the anomaly as it progresses across \nthe South Pacific toward South Georgia. Instead, atmospheric processes must also be involved. \nThis is consistent with the observation that ENSO has a strong high-latitude impact in the \nsoutheast Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean (e.g. Turner, 2004), and the recognition that ocean \nanomalies created farther to the west that pass through this region will be modified further by air-\nsea interaction due to ENSO as they progress. \n \nTo address this further, we repeated the correlation analysis shown in Figure 9 but using \nhemispheric wind data rather than hemispheric SST data. The most significant results are \nobtained for 5-6 months lag; Figure 10 shows the spatial patterns of correlation with meridional \nand zonal winds for the latter of these. The most striking feature in this figure is the correlation \nwith the rotating winds in the southeast Pacific, i.e the positive correlation with meridional winds \ncentred on around 140\u00b0W and negative correlation centred just west of Drake Passage in Figure \n10a, and the positive correlation between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0S flanked to the south by negative \ncorrelation in Figure 10b. This is the pattern of winds rotating around the anomaly in surface \natmospheric pressure that is commonly found in the southeast Pacific during ENSO events \n(Turner, 2004). \n \nThere is good evidence that the meridional winds are of prime importance in sustaining and \nmodifying the SST anomalies in the South Pacific as they transit toward South Georgia. In \n 17\nparticular, the meridional winds immediately to the west of Drake Passage (the longitude of the \nWAP and the Bellingshausen Sea) are held to be key. Recall that the strongest correlation \nbetween ENSO and South Georgia SST was at around 5 months lag (Figure 6), and (with \nreference to Figure 9c), it is clear that anomalies that reach South Georgia pass the vicinity of the \nWAP and the Bellingshausen Sea around 5-6 months earlier, at which point they experience \nanomalous meridional winds that reinforce the SST anomaly. (This timescale for advection of \nanomalies from the WAP to South Georgia is broadly consistent with in situ measurements using \npassive drogued drifters, which make the journey from the South Shetland Islands at the northern \nend of the WAP to South Georgia in around 110-120 days (Ichii et al., 1998)). \n \nThe role of meridional winds in controlling conditions at the WAP was investigated previously \nby Harangozo (2006), who found a remarkably strong relationship between meridional winds and \nice extent here. He noted that a local relationship of this strength was unique in both polar \nregions, and was a consequence of wind-induced ice drift being the dominant process controlling \nice extent, whereas in other regions ice growth and ocean currents can be more important. He \nnoted also that the north-south alignment of the WAP coast was crucial to explaining the strong \nrelationship, because it prevented eastward ice drift in response to the prevailing westerly winds. \nMany of the arguments advanced by Harangozo (2006) are equally applicable to SST as to sea \nice extent. SST anomalies and sea ice extent anomalies are strongly coupled on interannual \ntimescales in the Southern Ocean (e.g. Gloersen and White, 2001); this is true even for an \nunusual area such as the ocean west of the WAP. As a reflection of this, Figure 11 shows ice \nextent at 70\u00b0W (smoothed with a 2-year filter) alongside (a) ENSO, (b) the SAM, and (c) South \nGeorgia SST. The in phase relationship between ENSO and ice extent is clear, as is the antiphase \n 18\nrelationship between ice extent and the SAM (commented on below). Most significantly, there is \na clear relationship between 70\u00b0W ice extent and South Georgia SST, which is almost antiphase \nbut for a lag of just a few months (cross-correlations and \u2013spectra confirm this; not shown). This \nagrees with the above hypothesis of meridional winds at the western Peninsula influencing \nstrongly both the sea ice and SST fields, with the SST anomalies created then being advected to \nSouth Georgia in the ACC over the course of 5-6 months. \n \nThe above concept of meridional winds at the WAP influencing both sea ice and SST is in \nagreement with the observational study of Meredith et al. (2004a), who used a long time series of \nhydrographic data from the WAP shelf to investigate anomalous ocean conditions observed there \nduring 1998. They noted that the anomalous ocean conditions (which included a deepened mixed \nlayer, as well as surface anomalies) were primarily forced by a change in the rate of sea ice \nproduction, in response to a change in meridional winds associated with the 1997\/98 El Ni\u00f1o. \nAlthough the data used were from a coastal site, they argued for the broader-scale \nrepresentativeness of their data set. \n \nWe have thus seen that a significant part of the ENSO signal that influences SST at South \nGeorgia is imprinted on the ocean just upstream of Drake Passage, i.e. in the Bellingshausen Sea \nclose to the WAP. This does not negate the existence of anomalies that propagate toward South \nGeorgia from much further west across the Pacific (indeed this process is apparent in Figure 9), \nbut it does imply that a very significant proportion (possibly the bulk) of the ENSO-related \nvariability in SST that is observed at South Georgia is imprinted on the ocean surface much \ncloser to Drake Passage.  \n 19\n \nOf particular interest is the phasing of the ENSO-related anomalies generated close to the WAP \nwith respect to those generated in the western part of the South Pacific. In general, the phasing is \nsuch that the anomalies coincide in the southeast Pacific with the same sign and hence reinforce, \nstrengthening and sustaining the anomalies as they are advected across the South Pacific. \nHowever, depending on the periodicity of ENSO variability in the equatorial\/tropical Pacific in \nrelation to variability in the advective timescale across the South Pacific, this need not always be \nthe case. Antiphase variability generated locally and remotely in the southeast Pacific would tend \nto dampen anomalies as they are advected toward the South Atlantic.  \n \nThis is potentially of significance with relation to long-period behaviour of the Antarctic \nCircumpolar Wave (ACW; e.g. White and Peterson, 1996), a mode of climate variability with \ntwo opposing sets of anomalies that propagate around the Southern Ocean. Although the link \nbetween the ACW and ENSO has been established (e.g. Peterson and White, 1998), it has also \nbeen noted that the ACW exists only during certain time periods, and is distorted or absent during \nothers (Connolley, 2002). Two views tend to prevail when considering the ACW, firstly that it is \na genuine coupled phenomenon, sustained by local air-sea interaction, and secondly that it is \nmore the passive advection of anomalies by the ACC. Our findings suggest that, for the South \nPacific and southwest Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean, a \u201cresonance\u201d phenomenon may \nbetter explain the ACW behaviour (especially at longer periods), with the phasing of advective \nanomalies with relation to local air-sea-ice interaction controlling their strengthening or damping.  \n \n 20\nUnlike ENSO, which has its strongest footprint in the South Pacific, the SAM is a circumpolar \nmode of climate variability and thus has the ability to influence South Georgia SST more directly \nthrough local air-sea interaction processes. Note that our finding of most significant correlation at \napproximately 1 month lag between the SAM and South Georgia SST is supported by Sengupta \nand England (2006), who also observe a lag of this magnitude, which they ascribe to the large \nthermal capacity of the ocean mixed layer. They argue that the SST response is driven primarily \nby two factors, namely the action of meridional currents and the response of air-sea heat fluxes. \nThey note specifically that all of the sensible, latent and net radiation fluxes work in unison to \ngiven a positive SST response to increasing SAM in a band stretching from Drake Passage \neastward to Australia (the peak response they found is very close to Drake Passage, i.e. \nimmediately upstream from South Georgia in the ACC). \n \nAlthough we have stressed that the SAM is a circumpolar mode, and so has the potential to \ninfluence South Georgia SST locally via its footprint in the southwest Atlantic, it should be noted \nthat it is not perfectly zonally symmetric. This is readily seen in Figure 12, which shows the \nspatial pattern of correlation of meridional and zonal winds with the SAM index. As expected for \nthe SAM, zonal winds show a strong positive correlation for the band of westerlies that overlie \nthe ACC (Figure 12b). However, the non-zonal aspects of the SAM are clearly seen in Figure \n12a, where SAM-related meridional wind anomalies can be seen over the Southern Ocean, most \nnotably in the Pacific sector. The most significant of these are centred in the Bellingshausen Sea, \nadjacent to the WAP. (For comparison, Figure 13 shows the correlation of the same meridional \nand zonal winds, but with ENSO rather than the SAM. Note that the pattern of correlation with \n 21\nmeridional winds in the south and southeast Pacific is the same as that seen for the correlation of \nwinds with South Georgia SST (Figure 10a), just with the signs reversed). \n \nThese SAM-related meridional wind anomalies in the Bellingshausen Sea mean that, in a manner \nsimilar to ENSO influencing sea ice extent and SST close to the WAP, the SAM can also induce \nsuch anomalies that then advect to South Georgia. (This is seen also in Figure 11b, where an anti-\nphase relationship between the SAM and ice extent at 70\u00b0W can be seen). Note that the lag \nbetween the SAM and SST anomalies at South Georgia induced via this process will be longer \nthan for anomalies induced locally by forcing by the SAM, since the advective transfer timescale \nis of order 5-6 months. Combined, these local and remote processes would give an average lag \nlarger than zero but shorter than that for ENSO, as is seen in the observations (Figure 6b, c.f. \nFigure 6a). \n \nConcluding remarks \n \nWe have seen that SST at South Georgia (and more generally in the southwest Atlantic) is subject \nto both local and remote forcing by at least two large-scale coupled modes of climate variability \nin the Southern Hemisphere (SAM and ENSO), with strong implications for physical forcing of \nthe marine ecosystem here. The mechanisms whereby these modes influence SST across the \nSouth Pacific and into the southwest Atlantic are shown schematically in Figure 14. (Although by \nnecessity a simplification, this schematic captures the main elements of the system). Taking a \nstarting point of an El Ni\u00f1o event (Year 0 in Figure 14a), the sequence progresses as follows: (a) \nENSO and SAM create SST anomalies in the southwest Pacific through remote teleconnections \n 22\nand local processes respectively. At this time, a previously-formed anomaly of opposite sign \ngenerally occupies the southwest Atlantic. (b) During the next ~2 years, the SST anomaly is \nadvected by the ACC to the southeast Pacific adjacent to the WAP, where meridional winds \nassociated with both ENSO and the SAM modify the anomaly through air-sea-ice interaction. \n(Note the phase of ENSO has typically reversed during this ~2 year period, hence the \nmodification is generally a reinforcement rather than a dampening). Much of the SST variability \nobserved in the southwest Atlantic is associated with these interactions in the southeast Pacific. \n(c) Around 6 months later, the anomaly reaches South Georgia and environs, still being subjected \nto air-sea interaction from both ENSO and the SAM.  Note that Figure 14 depicts conditions \nrelative to an El Ni\u00f1o in Year 0 (Figure 14a); conditions following a La Ni\u00f1a event in Year 0 \nwould show the same patterns but with reversed signs.  \n \nThe time period of our study is, by necessity, the satellite era. During this period, ENSO had a \nmarked preponderance of El Ni\u00f1o events compared with La Ni\u00f1a events, due to the large El \nNi\u00f1os in 1983, 1987, 1992 and 1998. This has given ENSO indices a pronounced bias during this \nperiod, and the sign of the correlation between South Georgia SST and ENSO suggests that this \nmight have induced a cold bias in South Georgia SST for this period. Long-period behaviour is \nalso apparent in the SAM, which has shown a marked trend toward a higher-index state (i.e. \nstronger circumpolar winds) during recent decades (e.g. Thompson et al., 2000). The in phase \nrelationship we have observed between SAM and South Georgia SST suggests this might be \nreflected as an increase in South Georgia SST for this period, were this the only forcing. \nHowever, over the time period of our study, the South Georgia SST actually showed a small \nnegative trend, equivalent to a cooling of 0.14\u00b0C over the total period (note though that this is a \n 23\nsmall fraction of the standard deviation of the series of 0.45\u00b0C). Thus, whilst we have seen that \nthe SAM can influence South Georgia SST at interannual timescales, and it certainly has the \npotential to do so on longer (decadal) timescales, it was apparently not the prime driver of the \ndirection of SST change here during the 1980s and 1990s, in that the change in SST that one \nwould predict based on the SAM changes is of the opposite sign to that observed. Instead, it is \nmore likely that the variability in ENSO and other climate-scale processes dominated the \ndirection of SST change here during this period. Nonetheless, if the SAM continues to show an \nupward trend, changes in SST around South Georgia must be expected in response, with potential \nconsequences for the marine ecosystem. It is worth noting that the trend in the SAM has been \nascribed to anthropogenic effects, at least partially, with both greenhouse gas emissions and \nozone depletion being implicated (Marshall et al., 2004; Thompson and Solomon, 2002). Thus \nlong-period changes in the South Georgia ecosystem that are ultimately ascribed to the trend in \nthe SAM should also be considered as originating at least partially from anthropogenic causes. \n \nWith regard to ENSO, we note that the results we obtain here are derived from moderately long \nseries that include a number of El Ni\u00f1o events. As such, the correlational and spectral analyses \nwe performed are best considered to be representative of \u201ccanonical\u201d ENSO events. However, \nindividual events can vary greatly, and can have dramatically different impacts on high latitude \nocean properties (Lachlan-Cope and Connolley, 2006). Understanding the generic high-latitude \nresponse to ENSO (also to SAM) is the first step toward maintaining a sustained high level of \nskill in prediction; however, understanding the causes of individuality in each event is also \nrequired, and further work is needed to develop this. \n \n 24\nIn this paper, we have viewed the ocean largely as a simple receptor and advector of \natmospherically-induced SST anomalies, and the results we have seen support this being a \nreasonable zero-order depiction. This is also consistent with the results of Verdy et al. (2006), \nwho also observed that a reasonable approximation of SST anomalies in the ACC could be \nobtained by considering SAM and ENSO forcing of the ocean mixed layer combined with a \nsimple model that advects anomalies. Verdy et al. (2006) state that they find no compelling \nevidence for ocean-atmosphere coupling in maintaining or transferring SST anomalies. However, \nrecent evidence has suggested that there is feedback from SST anomalies to the atmosphere that \ncan influence the magnitude of the SAM (Marshall and Connolley, 2006; Sengupta and England, \n2006); this is potentially significant when attempting to predict the response of South Georgia \nSST to potential long-period changes in SAM forcing. \n \nWe note that a number of the relationships we have described here are similar in nature to those \noutlined previously in terms of an Antarctic Dipole. This is perhaps not surprising for the ENSO \nconnections, since the link between ENSO and the Antarctic Dipole is well established (e.g. \nYuan, 2004). It is hoped that the mechanisms we have outlined (including the important roles of \noceanic advection and the SAM) will enable progress in better understanding the dynamical \nnature of this phenomenon also. \n \nWith respect to the rate of advection of anomalies by the ACC, it is known that this will vary in \nresponse to changes in the SAM (Meredith et al., 2004b), although the changes in transport rate \nare small. However, potentially of much more significance is the observation that eddy activity in \nthe Southern Ocean responds circumpolarly to a change in the SAM (Meredith and Hogg, 2006). \n 25\nThese authors observed a time lag between SAM forcing and ocean eddy response (around 2-3 \nyears), and they argued that the poleward eddy heat flux (and hence ocean temperature) could \nalso show a response on this timescale. This implies a level of complexity in the \nocean\/atmosphere system that is not included in our results above, and is not captured by the \ncurrent generation of coarse-resolution climate models. It will, however, need careful \nconsideration if the long-term changes in ocean properties and ecosystems are to be reliably \npredicted.  \n \nThe ecosystem at South Georgia is known to be heavily reliant on a supply of Antarctic krill to \nsustain the large colonies of predators. This krill is believed to be sourced, at least in part, from \nkey breeding and nursery grounds at the WAP, with advection by the ACC to South Georgia an \nimportant process in maintaining the supply of krill to this location (Murphy et al., 2007). A \nrange of studies has shown this process to be in operation, and it is also believed that numerous \nfactors (including the presence of extensive sea ice in the Scotia Sea) are critical in sustaining the \nkrill as they are advected toward South Georgia (see Fach et al. (2006), Fach and Klinck (2006) \nand Murphy et al. (2007) for recent comprehensive studies).  \n \nIt has been shown in modelling studies that relatively small movements of the SACCF adjacent \nto the WAP can greatly reduce the possibility for transport of krill from this region to South \nGeorgia (Fach and Klinck, 2006). We extend this finding to suggest here that the direction and \nstrength of meridional wind anomalies at the WAP can be instrumental in promoting the retention \nof surface and near-surface waters south of the southern edge of the ACC, or conversely \nenhancing the injection of such waters from this location into the ACC (this is the process by \n 26\nwhich SST and sea ice anomalies are generated; see above). Anomalies in krill density in the \nsouthern ACC would then be created, with the potential to be reflected ultimately as anomalies in \nkrill density around South Georgia. Although this requires further study for proof (ideally with \nhigh-resolution physical\/biological ocean modelling), this represents a direct physical mechanism \nthat can generate interannual variability in the Scotia Sea and South Georgia ecosystems. ENSO-\nrelated interannual variability has already been observed in various ecosystems indicators at \nSouth Georgia and in the South Atlantic, thus we suggest that this mechanism should be \ninvestigated further as a matter of priority to better understand the causes of this relationship. \n \nTo summarise, we have developed a conceptual framework whereby SST at South Georgia is \nforced by a combination of local and remote processes, with interannual variability induced \nthrough a combination of ENSO and the SAM. We have observed the previously-highlighted \nlong-period advection of anomalies to South Georgia (advective periods of a few years); we \nstress here however that modification of these anomalies and shorter-period advection within the \nACC from immediately upstream in the southeast Pacific are key processes, as is direct \natmospheric forcing at the ocean surface. Combined, these imply a more direct connection \nbetween atmospheric modes of climate variability and ocean properties in the southwest Atlantic. \nThese processes all require consideration when assessing the physical forcing of the South \nGeorgia marine ecosystem, its connectivity with regions upstream in the ACC, and how the \nsystem is likely to change into the future. \n \n \n 27\nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank John Klinck (Old Dominion University) and an anonymous reviewer for constructive \ncomments that helped strengthen this paper.
