BLM also promotes branch migration of\\ud\nHolliday junctions. One role for BLM is to act in conjunction\\ud\nwith topoisomerase IIIa to process homologous\\ud\nrecombination (HR) intermediates containing a\\ud\ndouble Holliday junction by a process termed dissolution.\\ud\nHowever, several lines of evidence suggest\\ud\nthat BLM may also act early in one or more of the\\ud\nrecombination pathways to eliminate illegitimate or\\ud\naberrantly paired DNA joint molecules.

The\nmost striking feature, however, is the high incidence of malig-\nnancies of most types (1). Cells carrying mutations in the BS\ngene (designated BLM) display decreased plating efficiency\nand various signs of genomic instability; namely, chromosomal\nrearrangements, an elevated frequency of homologous\nrecombination (HR), and sensitivity to certain DNA damaging\nagents and replication inhibitors [(2) and references therein].\nThe hallmark feature of these cells, which is used in the\ndiagnosis of the disorder, is an elevated frequency of sister-\nchromatid exchanges (SCEs) (3).\nThe BS gene product, BLM, is a DNA helicase belonging\nto the highly conserved RecQ family (4). BLM is a DNA\nstructure-specific helicase that displays 30!50 directionality\n(5). The RecQ family of helicases includes four additional\nmembers in humans: WRN, the gene defective in Werner\u2019s\nsyndrome (WS) (6,7); RECQ4, associated with some cases of\nRothmund\u2013Thomson syndrome (8) and RAPADILINO (9);\nRECQ1 (10,11); and RECQ5 (12). Unicellular organisms\ngenerally contain only one representative of the family,\nsuch as the founding member in Escherichia coli, RecQ\n(13), and Sgs1 in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n(14,15).\nAlthough the precise function of any RecQ helicase is yet to\nbe established, several lines of evidence suggest that they\nplay roles in HR. HR is important for the repair of DNA double\nstrand breaks (DSBs), for the restoration of productive DNA\nsynthesis following disruption of DNA replication forks,\nand for meiosis, where it is essential for creation of genetic\ndiversity and for faithful chromosome segregation. Although\nthe biochemical details of HR are not fully worked out,\nseveral proteins are required to process DSBs to create a 30\nssDNA tail that can invade a homologous duplex to create a\nthree-stranded, branched structure called a displacement\nloop (D-loop). The key catalytic factor in D-loop formation\nis the Rad51 recombinase. It polymerizes on the ssDNA tail\ngenerated by resection of the DSB to create an extended fila-\nment in which the search for homology is conducted. This\nfunction requires the action of several accessory factors in\nyeast, including the Rad50\/Mre11\/Xrs2 complex, replication\nprotein A (RPA), Rad52, Rad54 and the Rad51-related pro-\nteins, Rad55 and Rad57. In mammals, this basic process in\nconserved, although it requires some additional factors; most\nnotably, the BRCA2 protein that is associated with some cases\nof hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (16,17).\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Similarly, E.coli recQ mutants (21) and S.cerevisiae\nsgs1 mutants (22) show excessive illegitimate recombination,\nsuggestive of a failure to suppress inappropriate recombina-\ntion occurring between non-identical sequences. The presence\nof a constitutively high level of RAD51-containing nuclear\nfoci in BS cells, even outside of S-phase where they normally\nexist, also indicates the presence of a constitutively high\nnumber of sites of ongoing or incomplete HR events\n(23,24). Moreover, RecQ helicases show direct physical inter-\nactions with HR proteins; e.g. BLM and Sgs1 each bind to\nthe Rad51 protein in their respective organisms through a\nconserved C-terminal interaction domain (23).\nThere is evidence of roles for RecQ helicases both early and\nlate in the HR pathway. Rockmill et al. (25) showed that Sgs1\nis required for the suppression of meiotic cross-overs by\ndecreasing the number of sites of so-called axial associations,\nwhich are sites for reciprocal exchange of recombining homo-\nlogues. This would suggest an early role in eliminating\nunwanted or aberrant recombination sites, at least in meiosis,\nand is consistent with the hyper-recombination phenotype\nseen in many RecQ helicase mutants. Nevertheless, there\nare also several reports that point to a late role for RecQ\nhelicases in HR. First, certain defects in yeast RecQ helicase\nmutants are at least partially suppressed by deletion of RAD51\nor other early acting HR proteins (23,26,27). Second, sgs1\nmutants exposed to the DNA damaging agent methyl methane\nsulphonate during S-phase accumulate Rad51-dependent, X-\nshaped structures, suggestive of a failure to resolve a DNA\nrecombination intermediate (28). Third, BLM and topoisome-\nrase IIIa together promote the so-called dissolution of a dou-\nble Holliday junction structure, a model for a late\nrecombination intermediate (29). These apparently conflicting\nconclusions concerning the stage during HR that RecQ heli-\ncases might act could reflect a dual role for these enzymes in\nHR. One plausible explanation is that RecQ helicases act alone\nat early stages in HR to disrupt paired DNA intermediates\ndeemed inappropriate for one reason or another, and that\nthey also act late, this time alongside topoisomerase IIIa, to\nresolve recombination intermediates.\nIn this study, we set out to test the hypothesis that the BLM\nhelicase can perform an anti-recombinase role through the\ndisruption of the D-loop recombination intermediate. For\nthis, we specifically utilized RecA-generated mobile (or\nmigratable) D-loop structures. We report that BLM is highly\nefficient at displacing the invading strand of mobile D-loops,\nand have identified structural features of the D-loop that direct\nBLM to act in this manner.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProteins\nRecombinant BLM was purified as described previously (30).\nOligonucleotides\nOligonucleotide sequences used in this study are listed in\nTable 1.

Reverse polarity oligonucleotides were synthesized\nusing 50-CE phosphoramidites and 50-supports (Glen\nResearch, Sterling, VA) by the CR-UK oligonucleotide\nsynthesis service. All oligonucleotides were purified on a\n10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel before use. Labelling\nwas carried out using either T4 polynucleotide kinase (New\nEngland Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [g-32P]ATP (Amersham\nBiosciences, Chalfont St.Giles, UK), or terminal deoxynucleo-\ntidyl transferase (New England Biolabs) and [a-32P]ddATP\n(Amersham) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nActivity of the labelled oligonucleotides was measured and\nspecific activity was calculated.\nConstruction of substrates\nThe oligonucleotide-based D-loops were prepared by the\nsequential annealing of the constituent oligonucleotides, as\ndescribed by Opresko et al. (32). The X12 four-way junction,\nreplication fork and OX-1T G4 substrates were generated as\ndescribed previously (31). The plasmid-based D-loop sub-\nstrates were generated as described by McIlwraith et al.\n(33). Briefly, the invading oligonucleotide (Table 1) was\ncoated with RecA (New England Biolabs), for 5 min, and\nthen supercoiled pUC18 plasmid was added to initiate strand\ninvasion. The strand invasion reaction was allowed to progress\nfor 3 min. The DNA was then deproteinized using proteinase\nK in the presence of SDS for 30 min. Substrates were purified\nessentially as described previously (31), but using 5% poly-\nacrylamide gels to achieve better recovery of large D-loop\nmolecules. The purified substrates were stored in 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mM MgCl2 (for D-loops and stand-\nard B-form DNA substrates) or 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (for G4 DNA).

The\nreaction products were separated by non-denaturing PAGE.\nThe gels were dried, and radiolabelled DNA was visualized\nusing a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Band intensities were\nquantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham). Quanti-\ntative results were expressed as percent unwinding normalized\nto activities in the untreated and denatured controls, as\ndescribed previously (31). Enzyme concentrations required\nfor 50% unwinding, as well as inhibitor concentrations\nrequired for 50% inhibition (IC50 values), were determined\nafter fitting a sigmoid curve with the Y \u00bc Baseline \u00fe\nPlateau \u0006 Baseline\n1\u00fe10\u00bdHillSlope\u00b7\u00f0X\u0006LogEC50\u00de\n non-linear regression model in the SPSS\nsoftware package.\nRESULTS\nWe set out to test the hypothesis that one mechanism by\nwhich BLM acts as an antirecombinase is through its ability\nto disrupt the DNA D-loop that forms at the initial strand\ninvasion step of HR. In this way, BLM could abort HR\nreactions that are deemed inappropriate; e.g. because the\nrecombining sequences are not identical. Previous studies\nindicated that RecQ family helicases are able to disrupt\noligonucleotide-based mimics of a D-loop created by the\nannealing of three partially complementary oligonucleotides\n(32,34,35). We considered it unlikely, however, that these\nD-loop mimics represent an ideal model for the D-loop\nstructure generated in vivo for several reasons. First,\noligonucleotide-based D-loops are \u2018static\u2019 and are not capable\nof branch migration along the DNA, in contrast to genuine\n\u2018mobile\u2019 D-loops created enzymatically by the RecA recom-\nbinase or one of its eukaryotic orthologues. Second, the\nunwinding of oligonucleotide-based D-loops generates pro-\nducts that can be re-annealed by the ssDNA annealing activity\nof BLM (36,37), potentially generating artifactual products\nthat could never arise when mobile D-loops are employed.\nThird, oligonucleotide-based D-loops cannot be generated\nin negatively-supercoiled molecules, unlike mobile D-loops,\nand do not, therefore, model the in vivo situation. Fourth,\noligonucleotide-based D-loops present recognition features\nfor helicases that are not evident in mobile D-loops or\nin vivo; in particular, two free dsDNA ends.\nWe considered the possibility that oligonucleotide-based\nD-loops might be disrupted by a mechanism different from\nthat employed for the disruption of mobile D-loops. We anti-\ncipated that the physiologically-relevant mechanism of dis-\nruption would entail the expulsion of the invading ssDNA\nfrom the recipient duplex in a single step. If such a mechanism\nwere not obviously in evidence during disruption of\noligonucleotide-based D-loops, then this would suggest that\nstudies of D-loop unwinding by helicases should focus exclus-\nively on mobile D-loop substrates. Indirect evidence to suggest\nthat this proposal might have some credence came from our\nanalysis of the data presented previously by van Brabant et al.\n(34). This analysis suggested that the \u2018invading\u2019 oligonuc-\nleotide was not simply being expelled from the duplex in a\nsingle step because reaction intermediates were evident in the\ndata presented by these authors (34). Using substrate oDL3\n(see Materials and Methods and Figure 1), we confirmed the\nresults of van Brabant et al. (34) indicating that BLM can\ndisrupt oligonucleotide-based D-loops (Figure 2). Moreover,\nwe also observed at least two reaction intermediates that con-\ntained the 32P-labelled oligonucleotide, but had a slower mobi-\nlity on PAGE than did the free \u2018invading\u2019 oligonucleotide.\nThese intermediate species are designated A and B on\nFigure 2. From the time-course experiments presented in\nFigure 2a it is clear that the oligonucleotide-based D-loop\nsubstrate was unwound in a multi-step manner. Consistently,\nwe found that species A appeared first over time, and was then\nconverted to species B. Subsequently, species B gave rise to\nthe radiolabelled single-stranded oligonucleotide. Using\nanother substrate, this time with a 50 invading end (oDL5;\nFigure 1), the pattern of appearance of products was different\nfrom that seen with oDL3. In this case, the single-stranded\nproduct was generated preferentially (Figure 2b), but again\nspecies A appeared as the first product. Species B was also\nobserved; however, the timing of its appearance did not\nobviously precede that of the free single-stranded oligonuc-\nleotide. Species B had a mobility identical to that of a partially\nNucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8 2271\nunwound intermediate comprising the bottom strand of the\nduplex annealed to the invading oligonucleotide (data not\nshown). These results would indicate that the unwinding of\nan oligonucleotide-based, static D-loop can proceed via the\ndenaturation of the duplex portion of the substrate (equivalent\nto the recipient duplex in strand invasion during HR) to create\na partially unwound intermediate that can be denatured in a\nsecond phase by BLM to yield the free oligonucleotide. This\norder of events is clearly not representative of the physio-\nlogical process of D-loop disruption.\nGeneration of \u2018mobile\u2019 D-loops\nGiven the above considerations, we set out to generate mobile\nD-loops employing the established method of McIlwraith et al.\n(33). In this, RecA is used to catalyse the invasion of an 90mer\nsingle-stranded oligonucleotide into a negatively-supercoiled\npUC18 plasmid DNA that contains a 54 bp region of sequence\nidentity with the 30 end of the oligonucleotide (Table 1 and\nFigure 1). The 50 region of the oligonucleotide used was not\ncomplementary to the pUC18 and can form a 36 nt single-\nstranded tail protruding from the D-loop. By minor modifica-\ntion of the sequence of the oligonucleotide, it was a straight-\nforward task to create D-loops incorporating one or more\nsingle base mismatches between the oligonucleotide and the\nrecipient plasmid. This permitted us to analyse the influence of\nMMR factors on the ability of BLM to process the D-loop\nstructure (see Discussion).\nBLM catalyses efficient D-loop disruption\nUsing a conventional D-loop (pDL3), in which the 30 end of\nthe oligonucleotide was base paired with the pUC18 plasmid\nand the 32P-labelled 50 tail was protruding, we tested whether\nFigure 1.

Kinetics of unwinding of oligonucleotide-based D-loops in a time-course experiment. Unwinding was carried out in the presence of 0.64 nM BLM for the\nperiod of time indicated above the lanes.

Using either a titration of increasing BLM concentra-\ntion, or a time course at a fixed BLM concentration, we found\nthat BLM could catalyse displacement of the 50 labelled\noligonucleotide from the D-loop (Figure 3). Based on our\nprevious analyses of the unwinding of other DNA substrates\nby BLM, it appeared that the D-loop was very efficiently\ndisrupted by BLM. To study this formally, we undertook\nadditional analyses. First, we preformed a head-to-head com-\nparison of the ability of BLM to disrupt the D-loop and two\nother DNA structures that have been shown previously to be\nefficient substrates for BLM; a four-way junction modelling\nthe Holliday junction and a G-quadruplex structure created\nfrom sequences of the Oxytricha telomere repeat region.\nG-quadruplexes are acknowledged as the best substrate\nfound to date not only for BLM, but also for most other\nRecQ helicases analysed (31,38\u201340). As shown in Figure 4,\nthe BLM concentration required to disrupt the D-loop and the\nG-quadruplex were very similar (50% unwinding at 7.38 and\n5.84 nM, respectively). In contrast, disruption of the four-way\njunction DNA consistently required a higher BLM concentra-\ntion. Moreover, the extent of unwinding of this substrate\npeaked at a value below 100% and declined at high BLM\nconcentrations. This phenomenon has been described previ-\nously and reflects the known DNA strand annealing activity of\nBLM (36,37) (discussed more in detail below).\nThe above data suggested that the D-loop is very efficiently\ndisrupted by BLM, and that it may rank alongside the\nG-quadruplex as a preferred substrate for BLM. To analyse\nthis issue more quantitatively, competition experiments were\nperformed. For this, increasing concentrations of unlabelled\n(cold) competitor DNA were added to helicase assays to deter-\nmine the concentration of competitor DNA that reduced the\nlevel of unwinding of the D-loop, G-quadruplex or four-way\njunction DNA to 50% of control levels seen in the absence\nof competitor. The cold competitor DNAs analysed were an\n80 nt oligonucleotide of unrelated sequences to any of the\nsubstrates, and the four-way junction and Oxytricha telo-\nmeric G-quadruplex described above. Unwinding of the\nfour-way junction DNA was inhibited by the non-specific\noligonucleotide competitor at concentrations of oligonuc-\nleotide \u000b10-fold below those required to inhibit unwinding\nof the G-quadruplex or D-loop substrates (IC50 values of\n2.73 nM for the four-way junction compared to 29.88 and\n29.8 nM, respectively, for the G-quadruplex and D-loop;\nFigure 5a and b). Consistent with the G-quadruplex and\nD-loop molecules being significantly better substrates for\nBLM than was the four-way junction, competition experi-\nments using cold four-way junction revealed efficient inhibi-\ntion of unwinding of the labelled four-way junction substrate,\nbut not of the G-quadruplex or D-loop substrates at the\nconcentrations of competitor used (Figure 5c and d). If, as\nindicated by the above results, the D-loop is comparable to\nthe G-quadruplex in being a highly efficient substrate for\nBLM, it would be predicted that cold G-quadruplex competitor\nDNA would inhibit unwinding of the labelled G-quadruplex\nessentially as efficiently as it would inhibit unwinding of the\nD-loop. We found, indeed, that this was the case, although it\nshould be noted that the transition in the sigmoidal inhibition\ncurve was sharper for the D-loop substrate than for the\nG-quadruplex substrate (Figure 5e and f). Taken together,\nthese data indicate that BLM can disrupt a mobile D-loop\nwith very high efficiency.\nStructural features of D-loops that are recognized\nby BLM\nThe D-loop substrate described above mimics an HR event in\nwhich the 30 end of the ssDNA has invaded the homologous\nduplex, and the 50 end is left protruding from the D-loop\n(designated pDL3; Figure 1). According to our current under-\nstanding, this is the situation that occurs during HR in vivo,\nbecause it permits priming of DNA synthesis from the 30 end\nof the invading DNA. To address the key structural features of\nthe D-loop that direct efficient BLM-mediated unwinding,\nwe created two additional mobile D-loops: one with no pro-\ntruding tail (pDLm) and one in which the 50 end of the oligo-\nnucleotide had invaded and the 30 end was protruding (pDL5).\nAnalysis of the kinetics of unwinding of these three D-loop\nsubstrates indicated that the pDL5 molecule was unwound at a\nFigure 3. A plasmid-based, mobile D-loop is a substrate for BLM. (a) BLM-concentration dependent unwinding of pDL3 in a 15 min reaction.

These data indicate that, while a protruding\ntail is not essential for BLM-mediated D-loop disruption, the\norientation of the invading DNA must somehow influence the\nefficiency of D-loop unwinding.\nWhile a protruding tail may not be an essential element for\nunwinding of a D-loop, it appeared possible that the 30 tail of\npDL5 provided an additional recognition feature for BLM that\nwould explain why this substrate was unwound more effi-\nciently than was pDL3 or pDLm. To analyse this, we created\ntwo additional D-loop substrates in which the invading oligo-\nnucleotide contained a 25 nt stretch of reverse polarity\n(Figure 1). In pDL33, the oligonucleotide contained a 30 invad-\ning end and a 30 terminus on the protruding tail. In pDL55, the\noligonucleotide had two 50 ends (see Materials and Methods\nand Figure 1). The data in Figure 6 show that pDL55 was\nunwound as rapidly as pDL5, and at a significantly faster rate\nthan was pDL33 (which was comparable in efficiency to\npDL3). Taken together, these data indicate that neither the\npresence nor the polarity of the protruding tail are important\nfeatures in determining the efficiency by which BLM disrupts\nmobile D-loops.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have shown that the BLM helicase can disrupt both mobile\nD-loops generated enzymatically by a bona fide recombination\ninitiating protein, and static D-loops created from oligo-\nnucleotides. Mobile D-loops are disrupted with high effici-\nency by BLM and rank alongside G-quadruplexes as the\npreferred substrate for the unwinding activity of BLM. We\nhave also identified structural features of mobile D-loops that\ninfluence BLM helicase activity and have presented evidence\nthat mobile and static D-loops are disrupted via different\nmechanisms.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for why mobile\nD-loops are such good substrates for BLM. First, and perhaps\nmost logically, D-loops may represent one of the major func-\ntionally relevant in vivo substrates for BLM. This possibility\nhas been proposed previously by others on the basis of genetic\nanalyses in model organisms. For example, the data of\nRockmill et al. (25) are consistent with a role for the yeast\nBLM orthologue, Sgs1, in disruption of an early,\nstrand-invasion intermediate in meiotic recombination. More-\nover, during a study of the role of the Drosophila BLM ortho-\nlogue in DNA DSB repair, Adams et al. (41) provided\nevidence that DmBLM was involved in the process of\nsynthesis-dependent strand annealing, which essentially\nrequires the propagation of a D-loop intermediate along\nDNA concomitant with DNA synthesis. A second possible\nreason for the D-loop appearing to be such a good substrate\nis that it is not influenced by the single stranded DNA (ssDNA)\nannealing activity of BLM. The unwinding of more widely\nstudied helicase substrates, such as forked duplexes and 30-\ntailed duplexes, generates products that can be re-annealed to\nre-create the starting substrate. As a result, there is competition\nbetween the forward (helicase) and reverse (annealing) reac-\ntions as the concentrations of substrate and products change\nover time. This creates a characteristic bell shaped curve if\nthe concentration of ssDNA product is plotted against BLM\nFigure 4. Comparison of the efficiency of unwinding of different substrates by\nBLM.

The enzyme-concentration was varied between 1\u201340 nM as\nindicated above by the triangle. Reactions lacking BLM are denoted by \u2018\u0006\u2019\nabove.

Blue triangle, green diamond and red square symbols depict\nthe pDL3, four-way junction and G4 DNA substrates, respectively. Analysis of\nthe concentration-dependence curve indicated that 50% unwinding of pDL3,\nfour-way junction and G4 DNA is achieved at 7.38, 8.97 and 5.84 nM, respec-\ntively. At high concentrations of BLM, the strand annealing activity of the\nenzyme becomes dominant over the unwinding activity, resulting in a diminu-\ntion in the level of unwound product for the four-way junction substrate [middle\npanel of (a), green triangles and dotted line of (b)]. The last two concentration\npoints (30 and 40 nM) were, therefore, omitted from the non-linear regression\nanalysis and for determination of the 50% unwinding concentration (see\nMaterials and Methods).\n2274 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8\nconcentration or time (Figure 4b) (36). Hence, there can be an\nunderestimation of the true efficiency with which BLM\nunwinds any substrate where the products are susceptible to\nre-annealing. This issue is irrelevant where mobile D-loop\nsubstrates are concerned, because BLM cannot re-generate\nthe initial substrate from the reaction products as it lacks an\nability to catalyse DNA strand invasion. Simple re-annealing\nwould not be sufficient to re-generate the D-loop. Moreover,\nthe equally efficiently unwound G-quadruplex substrate is not\nsubject to re-annealing, as the re-generation of the quadruplex\nwould require specific incubation conditions not provided dur-\ning a helicase reaction. Although this \u2018resistance\u2019 to strand\nannealing may at least partially explain why D-loops and\nG-quadruplexes appear to be such good substrates for BLM,\nwewouldargue that thecompetitionexperimentsdescribedboth\nin our study and previously during the study of G-quadruplexes\nby Maizels and co-workers (38,39) indicate that these DNA\nstructures are intrinsically good substrates for BLM.\nThere are several features of D-loops that could influence\nthe mechanism by which BLM effects their disruption. These\ninclude the distortion of the duplex in the region where strand\ninvasion has occurred, the 3-stranded nature of the D-loop, and\nthe presence of an ssDNA tail emerging from the D-loop. The\nfinding that the \u2018tail-less\u2019 pDLm substrate can be unwound by\nBLM argues strongly against the tail providing a funda-\nmentally important recognition feature. Of course, in vivo,\nalthough there is ssDNA invading a homologous duplex,\nthis ssDNA is continuous and would not terminate with a\nNucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8 2275\nfree end soon after emerging from the duplex, as is seen with\nthe mimics of D-loops necessarily used in vitro experiments.\nHence, it was never likely that the nature of the terminus of the\nssDNA would be a critical recognition feature. Nevertheless,\nBLM can distinguish between different D-loops depending on\nwhether the ssDNA has a 50 or a 30 invading end. As reported\npreviously using oligonucleotide-based D-loops (34), BLM\nprefers to unwind D-loops with a 50 invading terminus, and\nwe have confirmed this using mobile D-loops. What we have\nshown additionally through the analysis of the reverse polarity\noligonucleotides is that this preference is not determined by\nthe presence of a 30 terminus on the tail of the oligonucleotide,\nsince a substrate with two 50 ends is unwound as efficiently as\nis a conventional 50 invading oligonucleotide with a 30 tail.\nThe human orthologue of RecA, RAD51, interacts physi-\ncally with BLM (23). RAD51 differs from RecA in that it\npromotes strand invasion from a 50 ssDNA end more\nefficiently than it does from a 30 ssDNA end. Since 50 end\ninvasions are unproductive because they cannot be extended\nby DNA polymerases, some mechanisms must exist in vivo\nto limit their occurrence. Recently, the BRCA2 homologue of\nUstilago maydis (42) has been shown to control the polarity of\nstrand invasion. We suggest that BLM might impose a second\nbarrier to unproductive 50 strand invasions through its prefer-\nential unwinding of this form of D-loop. We propose that BLM\nhas the intrinsic ability to recognize the orientation of the\ninvading strand at the transition between the three-stranded\nand double stranded regions of the D-loop. Assuming that this\njunction proves to be a critical recognition feature, this opens\nup the possibility that mobile D-loops are not disrupted by\nconventional helicase action at all, but rather through branch\nmigration of the three-stranded junction. Two pieces of\nevidence are consistent with this possibility. First, BLM is\nknown to promote branch migration of four-stranded mole-\ncules over long distances (Kbps). Second, in the absence of\nRPA, BLM can unwind only very short partial duplexes, with\nthe efficiency of unwinding decreasing markedly as the length\nof the duplex portion of the substrate increases (43). In con-\ntrast, BLM unwinds the D-loop very efficiently in the absence\nof RPA.\nRecently, BLM, together with its interacting partner topo-\nisomerase IIIa, has been shown to resolve a double Holliday\njunction molecule, a mimic of a late recombination structure\n(29). It might, therefore, be expected that the two proteins also\nact together in the early stages of recombination, and that\nTOPOIIIa might modulate the D-loop unwinding activity\nof BLM. We attempted to address this possibility experiment-\nally; however, this proved to be impossible because TOPOIIIa\nalone was able to cause the release of the oligonucleotide from\nthe plasmid-based D-loop (data not shown). This release was,\nhowever, the consequence of the nicking of the plasmid back-\nbone by the topoisomerase and concomitant relaxation of\nthe negative supercoiling that is important for stabilization\nof the D-loop. A similar effect can be achieved simply by\ncutting the backbone with a restriction enzyme.\nWe propose that BLM disrupts mobile D-loops and\noligonucleotide-based D-loops via fundamentally different\nmechanisms. The most direct evidence to substantiate this pro-\nposal comes from an analysis of the order of appearance of the\nproducts of unwinding reactions in each case. In the presence of\nBLM, at least three discernible products are generated from the\nstatic D-loop substrate, two of which represent reaction inter-\nmediates that do not co-migrate with the eventual, end-labelled\nssDNA product. In contrast, the mobile D-loop is disrupted\napparently in a single step, as would be predicted. While it\nis formally possible that one or both of the reaction products\nFigure 5.

These\nproducts clearly appear at earlier time points than does the\nfree ssDNA oligonucleotide. A similar conclusion can be\nderived from an analysis of the data in Figure 5 of van Brabant\net al. (34).\na\nb\nFigure 6. Analysis of the recognition features important for efficient unwinding of plasmid-based D-loops.

Symbols used were: red square, pDL5; green diamond, pDL55; blue double-triangle, pDLm; purple triangle, pDL3; cyan\ncircle, pDL33.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8 2277\nThe studies described herein were initially aimed at testing\nthe hypothesis that BLM and MMR factors co-operate to\ndisrupt aberrant HR reactions. While our data are consistent\nwith such a role for BLM, we obtained no evidence for a\ncombined role for BLM and MMR proteins in D-loop disrup-\ntion through studying the efficiency by which BLM and the\nMMR proteins together disrupt D-loops containing one, two or\nfour G:T type mismatches (Table 1; C. Z. Bachrati, R. H. Borts\nand I. D. Hickson, unpublished data). This does not, in any\nway, argue against a key role for MMR proteins in \u2018quality\ncontrolling\u2019 HR processes; there is ample evidence to indicate\nsuch a role. The reason(s) why we failed to identify a role for\nMMR proteins at the D-loop stage of HR may reflect any of\nseveral possibilities. First, they may not play any role during\nthis step of HR, but instead act later. Second, we may not have\nplaced the mismatches in the appropriate location(s) in the\nD-loop. Third, factors in addition to BLM and MMR proteins\nare required to form a complex in order to promote abortion of\nmismatched D-loops. Further analyses will be required to\nanalyse whether any of these possibilities is true.\nIn summary, we have presented evidence that mobile\nD-loops are a highly preferred substrate for the BLM helicase.\nOne phenotype of BLM-deficient cells is an elevated fre-\nquency of recombination between homologous sequences.\nMoreover, cells from lower organisms deficient in BLM ortho-\nlogues display hyper-recombination and a failure to suppress\nhomologous recombination. We propose that a plausible\nexplanation, at least in part, for these phenotypes is that\nBLM (and perhaps other RecQ helicases) can prevent\nD-loop structures from being converted into mature recombi-\nnants. Clearly, it would not be advantageous for BLM to effect\nthis role indiscriminately in vivo; otherwise, all recombination\nreactions would be abortive. The identification of factors that\nmodulate the function of BLM in the process of HR will likely\nidentify factors that are crucial for the maintenance of genome\nstability and suppression of tumorigenesis in man.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank members of the Genome Integrity\nGroup for useful discussions, Drs P.
