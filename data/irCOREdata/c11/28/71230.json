Atomic force microscopy shows that\ncoalesced quantum dots and then isolated quantum dots are formed with increasing Sb composition\n(x50.2\u2013 0.3) and strain. The 4 K photoluminescence of the isolated and coalesced quantum dots\nwas observed to peak in the midinfrared at 289 and 316 meV, ~4.29 and 3.92 mm!, respectively.\nThese peaks are due to type II transitions and begin to quench at temperatures above 100 K as holes\nbecome thermally activated out of the quantum dot confinement potential. \u00a9 2000 American\nInstitute of Physics. @S0003-6951~00!04248-0#InAs and its alloys are promising materials for the fab-\nrication of mid-infrared ~2\u20135 mm! optoelectronic devices for\nuse in gas sensors and many other applications.1 There is\nincreasing interest in accessing this spectral region using a\nvariety of materials engineering approaches and techniques.\nIn recent years, InSb, GaSb, AlSb, and InAs quantum dots\n~QDs! have been grown on GaSb and GaAs substrates by\nmolecular beam epitaxy ~MBE! and metalorganic vapor\nphase epitaxy ~MOVPE!. The resulting photoluminescence\nemission from these quantum dots was however observed in\nthe near infrared.2\u20137 By comparison there have been no re-\nports of InSb or InAs12xSbx quantum dots exhibiting emis-\nsion in the spectral range .2 mm. In this letter we report on\nthe photoluminescence and morphology of InAs12xSbx\nquantum dots (x50.2\u2013 x50.3) encapsulated in InAs and the\neffect of strain as the Sb composition was increased laterally\nalong the InAs substrate.\nA schematic diagram of the type II InAs12xSbx \/InAs\nquantum dot system is shown in Fig. 1. The photolumines-\ncence of InAs is normally dominated by transitions between\nshallow donors Es , deep donors ED , and deep acceptors\n(EA1 and EA2). At low temperature, the PL of undoped and\nn-type InAs generally shows two peaks A and B. However,\nadditional peaks C and D corresponding to the transitions\nfrom ED to Ev and from Es to EA2, are observed in p-type\nmaterial.8 The system affords deep hole confinement (Ev\n;100 meV) in the quantum dot based on band offset consid-\nerations.\nThe samples for this investigation were grown from the\nliquid phase using a modified ~rapid slider! liquid phase ep-\nitaxy ~LPE! technique,9 which is capable of producing quan-\ntum wells and quantum dots.10 Under lattice matched growth\nconditions continuous ultrathin layers ~quantum wells! are\nobtained, but when highly mismatched, quantum dots are\nproduced instead. In the present investigation InAs12xSbx\nquantum dots with x;0.2 were grown on n-type ~S doped\n131018 cm23) InAs~100! substrates. Samples of both InAs\nencapsulated and unencapsulated InAs12xSbx quantum dots\na!Electronic mail: a.krier@lancaster.ac.uk3790003-6951\/2000\/77(23)\/3791\/3\/$17.00were grown for photoluminescence ~PL! and atomic force\nmicroscope ~AFM! investigation, respectively. The InAs\nbuffer and encapsulation layers were grown from an In-rich\nmelt, whereas the InAs12xSbx was grown from a pseudobi-\nnary melt. The resulting quantum dot layer composition (x\n;0.2) was calculated from the InAs12xSbx phase diagram.11\nThe PL sample was grown at 580 \u00b0C with a ramp cooling\nrate of 0.3 \u00b0C\/min and using contact times of 300 s, 1 ms,\nand 20 s for the InAs buffer, InAsSb quantum dot, and InAs\ncapping layers, respectively. All three layers were grown us-\ning 25 \u00b0C melt supercooling. The total thickness of the PL\nsample was ;16 mm and the cap layer thickness was\n;1 mm. The corresponding sample for AFM investigation\nwas grown using similar conditions, but without the encap-\nsulation layer. A Topometrix TMX 2000 Explorer AFM was\nused to investigate the resulting morphology and to obtain\nthe fundamental parameters of the InAs12xSbx quantum dots\nat different positions ~along the passing direction of the melt!\nFIG. 1.

The corresponding low temperature PL\nspectra were excited using a 5 W ~514 nm wavelength!\nargon-ion laser and detected using a 77 K InSb photodiode\ndetector and conventional 4 K PL spectroscopy apparatus for\nthe mid-IR. With this arrangement excitation is indirect,\nmost of the photoexcited carriers are generated within the\nInAs capping layer and diffuse deeper into the sample where\nthey then recombine within the quantum dots.\nFigure 2 shows three AFM images ~a!, ~b!, and ~c! taken\nfrom the sample in regions P3 , P5 , and P7 at different po-\nsitions along the sample as shown in the inset. Even though\nthe contact time is very short ~1 ms!, with 25 \u00b0C supercool-\ning there is still local depletion of As from the InAs12xSbx\nmelt at the growth interface, resulting in a variation in solid\ncomposition across the sample along the passing direction of\nthe melt ~i.e., Sb increases P3 \u2013 P7). This means we are con-\nveniently able to examine the resulting morphology and pho-\ntoluminescence properties corresponding to different\nInAs12xSbx compositions having different amounts of lattice\nmismatch to the InAs substrate.

Atomic force microscope images obtained from unencapsulated\nInAs12xSbx quantum dots with increasing Sb composition grown by LPE\nand corresponding to the passing direction of the melt across the substrate.\nApproximate compositions are A (x50.20); B (x50.25); and C (x\n50.30). Ra, rms, and Za are the area average roughness, the area root-mean-\nsquare roughness, and the arithmetic mean height, respectively.techniques revealed a flat surface without any dots and PL\ncharacteristic of near band edge recombination, and only\nweak emission associated with defects.\nUsing the above technique, we were able to observe the\nonset of three-dimensional growth of isolated quantum dots\nfrom a coalesced ~quantum well! layer as a function of strain.\nConsequently, the InAs12xSbx in region P3 has a relatively\nsmall Sb content (x50.2) and associated strain. The AFM\nimage of P3 shows quite a smooth continuous InAs12xSbx\nlayer. Some islands about 300 nm in diameter and 100 nm in\nheight are visible. This means that a strained epilayer covers\nmost of the area in the vicinity of P3 , but some large dots\nhave nucleated to help consume the local strain energy. The\nimage from region P5 (x50.25) shows a relatively uniform\nself-assembled layer of coalesced quantum dots with a few\nlarger islands.2 The coalesced quantum dots are about 150\nnm in diameter and 50 nm in height, with an area density of\n;53109 cm22. Region P7 has the highest Sb composition\n(x50.3) of the three and the AFM image shows isolated\nquantum dots, some of which have coalesced together. The\narea density of the isolated dots is ;23109 cm22.\nFigure 3 shows the 5 K PL spectra measured from the\nsample at several different positions P1 \u2013 P9 along the wafer,\nagain corresponding to increasing Sb composition ~where\nP3 , P5 , P7 relate approximately to AFM images A, B, C!.\nThe PL spectra at P1 and P2 show two peaks A and B\nlocated at 418 and 406 meV, corresponding to band\u2013band\ntransitions ~from Ec to Ev) and donor\u2013acceptor transitions\n(Es \u2013 EA1) in InAs, respectively. These originate from the\ncapping and buffer layers but, in the PL at P3 , another peak\n~F! located at 378 meV is observed, which correlates with\nFIG. 3.

At P2 the \u2018\u2018quantum well\u2019\u2019 layer is thinner than\nat P3 and peak F shifts to higher energy and enhances peak\nB compared with the PL observed at P1 . In the spectra ob-\nserved from positions P3 to P7 , peak F shifts from 378 to\n316 meV, and decreases in intensity as the 289 meV peak G\nincreases in intensity. This suggests that as we move across\nthe sample with increasing Sb composition (x) and hence\nstrain, the emission is initially representative of a strained\nquantum well layer and gradually becomes characteristic of\nself-assembled coalesced QDs. Then finally at some critical\ncomposition (x;0.25) PL is observed mainly from isolated\nQDs of fixed size at P7 .12 The two dips in the broad peak G\nat around 290 meV ~4.3 mm! are due to CO2 absorption in\nthe laboratory atmosphere. Moving further along from posi-\ntion P7 to P9 , peak G decreases in intensity, while the defect\nrelated peak D ~transitions from Es to EA2) and its phonon\nreplica peak E , as well as peak B increase in intensity. This\nis consistent with the overgrowth of the isolated QDs result-\ning in the production of more deep states (EA1 and EA2) in\nthe InAs in the immediate vicinity outside of the dots which\nenhances peaks B and D, as well as introducing recombina-\ntion centers ~perhaps at EA4 and EA5) within the quantum dot\nto quench peak G.\nFigure 4 shows the dependence of emission peak energy\non the laser power for the various PL peaks discussed in Fig.\n3 above. The peak F blueshifts from 312.2 to 318.4 meV as\nthe excitation intensity increases which is consistent with a\ntype II band alignment for the coalesced QDs.5 The blueshift\nof the isolated quantum dots ~peak G! with increasing exci-\ntation energy is even larger than that of peak F, consistent\nwith a smaller density of states in the isolated QDs compared\nwith the coalesced QDs. The InAs related peaks B(P5) and\nB(P7) exhibit only a small blueshift ~1.2 meV! by compari-\nFIG. 4.

The peak\nenergy of peak G is about 35 meV lower than that of peak F,\nbecause the confinement in the 3D isolated QDs is stronger\nthan the 2D confinement in the coalesced dots. The inte-\ngrated intensity of peak G(P7) also increases almost linearly\nwith excitation intensity up to 4 W, whereas the intensity of\nthe InAs related peak shows a strong saturation above 2 W.\nThe temperature dependence of the integrated intensities\nof these PL peaks provides additional evidence of the strong\nquantum confinement inside the quantum dots. The PL inten-\nsity of the isolated quantum dots, G(P7) increases slightly\nfrom 5 to 80 K before rapidly quenching at a temperature\nabove 100 K with an activation energy of 89 meV. The\nquenching is associated with holes being thermally excited\nout of the quantum dot confinement potential shown sche-\nmatically in Fig. 1. By comparison the integrated intensity of\nthe InAs-related peak B(P7) quenches rapidly with increas-\ning temperature above 5 K, with an activation energy of only\n4.6 meV.\nMid-infrared photoluminescence from InAs12xSbx quan-\ntum dots grown by LPE has been observed at 4.3 mm. The\ndependence of the resulting PL with increasing Sb composi-\ntion and strain revealed distinct peaks at 316 and 289 meV\nwhich resulted from type II transitions originating from coa-\nlesced and isolated dots, respectively. The PL emission per-\nsisted up to 210 K but began to quench rapidly above 100 K\nwith an activation energy which corresponds approximately\nto the hole confinement energy in the InAs12xSbx quantum\ndot.\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for the award of a\nresearch grant to support this work.\n1 See, for example, B.
