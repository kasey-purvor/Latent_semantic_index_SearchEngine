We assess the influence of set-size, the\nvisibility of sets, and the way in which set equivalence is derived - pairing versus sharing -\nusing a repeated-measures design. Three-year-olds are largely restricted to inferring number\nafter separating out conceptually paired items. In contrast, four-year-olds are able to make\nappropriate inferences about shared items, but they typically prefer to count those items if\nthey are visible. Moreover, the size of corresponding sets affects children\u2019s propensity to\ncount rather than infer. Children count more often on larger sets. The ability to infer number\nusing cardinal extension is associated most strongly with sharing proficiency, although\ncounting skills also play an important part. We discuss how the data reveal an emerging\nunderstanding of the relationship between one-to-one correspondence and cardinality.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  3\nBecause it's there! Why children count, rather than infer, corresponding sets.\nThe development of children\u2019s numerical skills appears to incorporate several\nparadoxes. As Feigenson, Dehaene & Spelke (2004) note, mathematics is at once both\nobvious and obscure. On the one hand young children show sophisticated insights into the\npreciseness of numbers (Sarnecka & Gelman, 2004) and infants distinguish both discrete and\ncontinuous quantities (see Feigenson et al., 2004). On the other hand, they also reveal some\nstriking limitations, for example failing to discriminate between numerosities (Xu & Spelke,\n2000). In the specific domain of children\u2019s counting too, there is a conundrum. Even by the\nage of approximately three years, children appear to possess a command of core principles\nthat underlie counting behaviour (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978; Gelman & Meck, 1983). Yet\nthere is often an exasperating reluctance among children to use the products of counting to\ndraw legitimate and sensible conclusions about the relationship between sets (Michie, 1984a).\nIn this paper, we present data from two experiments that help to understand why preschool\nchildren may fail to make the most of the numerical strategies that they implement. For this,\nwe use a sharing task, and in so doing, we address and attempt to reconcile some apparent\ninconsistencies in the literature.\nSharing, like counting, is a skill that is acquired and practiced during early childhood\n(Pepper & Hunting, 1998). Preserving numerical correspondence among shares, through a\nscheme such as \u201cone-for-you, one-for-me\u201d, ensures that each recipient has an equivalent set.\nHowever, while this is an appropriate procedure to share out equally, and is a common\nstrategy that appears fairly stable between preschool and school years (Miller, 1984),\npreschool children may have difficulty realizing what they have accomplished. In this sense,\nprocedural mastery outstrips conceptual awareness of what has been achieved. That is,\nchildren below eight years of age often insist that counting is necessary to reach a conclusion\nabout the equality of the shares (Davis & Pitkethly, 1990; Frydman & Bryant, 1988).\nHowever, (and in contrast with this research) some findings suggest that, with conceptually\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  4\npaired items, three-year-olds are able to recognize that corresponding sets are equivalent\n(Sophian, 1988; Sophian, Wood, & Vong, 1995). Why might children be inconsistent in these\ntwo situations?\nEvidence that sharing has been carried out evenly, or fairly, ought to be sufficient for\nchildren to conclude that there are as many items in one set as there are in the other(s). Using\na 'same\/different' task, Cowan and Biddle (1989) found that three-year-olds understood that\ndistributing items using a 'one-for-you, one-for-me' rule results in sets that are the same,\nparticularly if shares were small (i.e., < four items) and visible. They were not tested on\nwhether they knew how many items each set contained, however, and young children\nexperience difficulty mapping the insights from quantitative equivalence onto number words.\nFrydman and Bryant (1988) exposed this difficulty, when they asked four-year-olds to share\nout sweets between dolls, then counted aloud one set for children, and asked how many\nsweets there were in the other. Even though most children had shared out successfully, none\nwould infer (via the principle of cardinal extension) the numerosity of sweets in the second\nset. Without exception, every child started to count. Even when the set was hidden so as to\npreclude counting, less than half the children used equivalence to infer set size.\nUsing cardinal extension to infer equivalent shares may be difficult for children, but\nthey seem to have several conceptual building blocks in place to reach this milestone. First,\nchildren can use knowledge of cardinality when setting up corresponding sets (Becker, 1989;\nSophian, 1988). Five-year-olds are able to count-out items and stop when they reach the\nnumber which ensures that two sets match (Russac, 1978). Secondly, they are also aware that\ncardinal extension is appropriate when inferring a number of conceptually paired items.\nSophian et al. (1995) showed three-year-olds pairs of frogs and boats (i.e., one frog per boat).\nThese pairs were separated, by placing the frogs inside a box (a narrative explained that they\nwere going to a party) while the boats were (moored) outside. The majority of children then\nsuccessfully inferred the number of hidden frogs after counting the boats, at least so long as\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  5\nsmall sets (two or three) were used (consistent with Cowan & Biddle, 1989). Thus, many\nchildren apparently knew that correspondence between pairs of items implies identical\ncardinals.\nThere are important methodological differences between the Frydman and Bryant, and\nSophian et al., studies that may contribute to their divergent conclusions. First, Sophian et\nal.\u2019s study started out with conceptually paired items; each frog had its own boat. Separating\nout six pairs of frogs and boats produces a set of six frogs and a set of six boats. In contrast, in\nFrydman and Bryant\u2019s task, sharing out six sweets gives two sets of three sweets. If\nconceptual pairs are thought of as whole (and not separate) entities, then the elements \u2013 the\nfrogs and boats \u2013 become corresponding portions of these whole items. Making inferences\nabout equivalence here need not be the same as making inferences when dividing up\nhomogeneous items.\nAnother difference concerns the visibility of the sets. Children could see the set-to-be-\ninferred in the Frydman and Bryant but not the Sophian et al. (1995) study. In each case,\nchildren were essentially asked, \"How many items are there in the first set?\" followed by\n\"How many items are there in the second set?\" It may be that children count (rather than infer\nthe numerosity of) a visible set simply because items are there. Children are prone to counting\na single set in response to the question 'How many?' (Frye, Braisby, Lowe, Maroudas &\nNicholls, 1989), particularly when items are visible (Fuson, 1988; Wynn, 1990). Number\nconservation tasks also demonstrate that the perceptual impact from visible arrays can\ninfluence, even if not determine, children\u2019s appreciation of the situation (e.g., Piaget, 1952).\nFurthermore, children may opt to repeat a strategy (counting) on the second question that\nproved successful on the first. The principal aim of the present studies was to investigate the\ninfluence of these two contextual factors - [1] sharing and [2] set-visibility - on children\u2019s\ndeveloping ability to infer the number of items in a corresponding set.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  6\nWe designed two play scenario's with which to examine the effects of these contextual\nvariables. In one, that echoes Sophian et al.'s (1995) frog-boat task, children are shown toy\nanimals that travel to school on their bicycles. Children are invited to pair animals with\nbicycles, before moving the pairs towards a schoolhouse. Upon arrival, the animals are placed\ninside the school, while the bicycles are placed in a separate bike shed. In the other scenario\nthat echoes Frydman and Bryant's (1988) sweet-sharing task, children are asked to share out\ntoy ice-creams between a toy ice-cream van and ice-cream shop. The questions put to children\nafter allocating items is essentially the same in each scenario. Children are asked, 'How many\nanimals are there in school\/How many ice-creams are in the ice-cream shop?' followed by,\n'How many bicycles are there in the bike shed\/How many ice-creams are in the ice-cream\nshop?' On half the trials, the bike shed\/ice-cream shop is covered, preventing children from\nseeing inside. If they are aware that corresponding sets have the same cardinal number, but\nprefer to count a target set rather than infer its numerosity, we expect children to make more\ninferences when the target set is hidden (hypothesis 1). If they know that sets of conceptually\npaired items (e.g., lions riding bicycles) have the same cardinal number but do not understand\nthat sharing sweets evenly produces equivalent sets, then we expect children to perform better\nwhen they are quizzed about the number of lions (hypothesis 2).\nWe began to address these hypotheses with a relatively small-scale experiment. We\nrestricted the number of trials to children, so as to minimize fatigue or carry-over effects, and\nconsequently focused on a single set-size and age group.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nParticipants. Forty children (3 years 5 months to 4 years 3 months, M = 3 years 9 months, SD\n= 2.6 months), from three pre-school playgroups in a predominantly White, urban population\ntook part. None of the children had any identified learning difficulties.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  7\nMaterials. Child-friendly materials similar to children's toys were used throughout. Two shoe-\nboxes, painted on one side to resemble a bicycle shed and a school, and on the other side an\nice-cream van and a seaside shop. Two sets of toy animals (lions and dolphins) and two sets\nof toy food items (ice-creams and tins of soup). Matchboxes painted to resemble bicycles.\nProcedure. The same male experimenter tested each child on two separate occasions\n(Sessions 1 and 2), approximately one week apart. Problems were presented in two scenarios;\nanimals going to school and food being allocated to vendors to sell. In each scenario, the\nproblem was presented in two levels of visibility: visible and hidden. Each child received two\ntrials, one in each level of visibility, in each session. The order of presentation was\ncounterbalanced.\nScenario 1 - Animals going to school: Warm-up phase. The experimenter introduced\nthe child to the school and bicycle shed, then demonstrated how the animals got to school\neach day, saying, \"These lions go to school on their bikes. Look, each lion has his own bike,\nand he sits on it and pedals to school like this\u201d. Lions were placed in matchboxes (one per\nmatchbox) and slid across the table, whereupon each lion was placed in the school (by\ninserting them through a small hole in the roof) and the matchboxes lined up outside the\nbicycle shed. Dolphins swam to school en masse (hidden in the experimenter's hand). In the\nwarm-up phase, children were asked only which type of animals the bicycles belonged to.\nTest phase. A set of lions (7, 8 or 9) was placed on the table, along with the same\nnumber matchboxes (bicycles). The experimenter asked the child to take the lions to school,\nreminding them that lions went one at a time. The experimenter moved the dolphins by hiding\nthem in his hand and placing them inside the shoebox. The set of lions was the target set (i.e.,\nthe set in item-to-item correspondence with the bicycles) while dolphins acted as a control set\n(i.e., this set was not in one-to-one correspondence, and acted as a check against last-word-\nrepetition using the cardinal number of bicycles). Once all the animals were in school the\nexperimenter asked, \"How many bicycles are in the bicycle shed?\" followed by \"How many\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  8\nlions\/dolphins are at school?\" (the order in which children were asked about the target and the\ncontrol sets was counterbalanced). If they said they did not know, children were asked to\nguess. The aim was to see if children would use cardinal extension to infer appropriately the\nnumber of lions from the number of bicycles, and refrain from extending the same cardinal to\nan unknowable number of dolphins.\nIn the hidden condition the roof was left on (\"because it is raining\"), hiding the\nanimals from view. In the visible condition the roof was removed (\"because it is a nice day\"),\nrevealing the animals inside. If a child started to count the target set, the experimenter placed\nhis hands over the shoebox and asked if they knew how many there were without counting.\nThe bicycles were visible throughout both conditions. As an additional control against\nchildren succeeding through perceptual comparisons, all sets were arranged such that there\nwas no spatial correspondence between any of them. Children readily rely on spatial cues to\njudge relative magnitude (e.g., Brainerd, 1979; Cowan, 1987; Michie, 1984a, 1984b; Piaget,\n1952; Saxe, 1977; Sophian, 1987), and we wanted to eliminate the potential for children to\nmake comparisons this way.\nScenario 2 - Food being sold: Warm-up phase. The child was asked to identify the\nice-cream van and the shop, and then shown toy ice-creams. The experimenter then\ndemonstrated how, as neither the shop nor the van had anything to sell (the shoeboxes were\nempty), it was necessary to share the ice-creams out so they both had the same. The child was\ninvited to share them out after the experimenter had demonstrated how it could be done, and\nalso shown some tins of soup (the experimenter explaining that when the weather got cold the\nshop needed to have soup in case people wanted something hot to eat).\nTest phase. A set of ice-creams (14, 16 or 18) was placed on the table, and 3 - 5 tins of\nsoup were retained in the experimenter's hand after being shown briefly to the child. The\nprocedure was essentially the same as used for animals, with ice creams being allocated to the\nshop (the target set) and van (corresponding set) except that children were told, \"Share out\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  9\nthese ice-creams, so that the ice-cream shop and the ice-cream van have both got some ice-\ncreams to sell. Put some in here [pointing] and some in here so they've both got the same.\"\nThose placed in the shop became the target set and those in the van the corresponding set.\nTins of soup acted as the control (unrelated) set. Once all the ice creams had been shared out,\nthe experimenter asked \"How many ice creams does the ice cream van have to sell?\" followed\nby \"How many ice creams\/tins of soup does the shop have to sell?\" (the order in which the\nexperimenter asked about the target and control sets was counterbalanced). Again, the\ncorresponding set \u2013 ice-creams in the van - was visible on all trials.\nResults\nWe start by addressing hypotheses 1 and 2 concerning the effects of set-visibility and\nscenario on the ability to infer corresponding numerosity. First we take as our dependent\nvariable the ability to make an appropriate inference spontaneously; that is without first\nattempting to count the target set. Next, we recode performance (on trials where the target set\nwas visible). Following recoding, the dependent variable will include all correct inferences\n(i.e., spontaneous inferences and the inferences made after the experimenter had hidden the\ntarget set with his hand because the child initially attempted to count the set).\nFor all analyses, a child was scored as correct when he or she inferred that the target\n(related) set, but not the unrelated set, shared the same cardinal as the counted set1. A\npreliminary analysis of the data revealed no effect of age (in months) or order of questioning\n(asking about the target\/unrelated set first) and, consequently, the data were pooled for all\nsubsequent analyses.\nSpontaneous inferences. Table 1 shows the effect that set-visibility and scenario had on\nperformance. Only 5% of children inferred spontaneously a visible set of ice creams, and\n12.5% inferred a visible set of lions (see left hand column of Table 1). These figures contrast\nsharply with the inferences made when the ice-creams and lions were hidden (30% and 40%\nrespectively - see right hand column of Table 1).\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  10\n__________________________________________________________________________\nTable 1\nNumber of Children making inferences in each scenario\n___________________________________________________________________________\nVisibility Visible Hidden\nSpontaneous Inc. inferences\n(no hiding) made after hiding\n___________________________________________________________________________\nScenario\nLions\/Bicycles (conceptual pairs) 5 11 16\nIce-creams (shared homogeneous items) 2 12 12\n___________________________________________________________________________\nNotes.\nSpontaneous inferences are those where the child inferred without making any attempt to\ncount items. The figures under 'Inc. inferences made after hiding' refer to the total number of\ncorrect inferences made, including those made after the experimenter hid the target set\nbecause the child attempted to count.\nThe possible maximum in each cell = 40\n___________________________________________________________________________\nBecause the data failed to satisfy the criteria for parametric analysis, we used Sign\ntests2 to examine the effects of Visibility (visible vs hidden) and Scenario (animals vs food\nitems). Regarding visibility, 21 children scored equally on 'visible' and 'hidden' trials (e.g.,\nthey scored 0-0 respectively). Of the remaining 19 children, 17 made more inferences when\nthe target set was hidden, with only 2 children showing the opposite pattern (i.e., making\nmore correct inferences when the target set was visible); p = .001. Thus, children who knew\nthat the numerosity of a related set could be inferred were more likely to display that\nknowledge when that set could not be counted. Turning to the effect of Scenario, 26 children\nscored equally on 'Lions\/Bicycles' and 'Ice-cream' trials. Of the remaining children, 10 made\nmore correct inferences when judging the number of bikes, with only 4 children making more\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  11\ncorrect inferences when asked about ice-creams. Although children were, therefore, more\nsuccessful when judging paired rather than shared items, this difference failed to reach\nsignificance; p = .180.\nWe looked for reasons why only 35 correct inferences were made out of a possible\ntotal of 160. When the target set was visible, only seven correct inferences were made; on the\nremaining 'visible' trials children often attempted to count the target set (54\/73). The incorrect\nresponses in the 'hidden' condition were an approximately even mix of guesses (22 trials) and\n\"Don\u2019t know\" (30 trials). We expected some children to try and remove the lid from the box\nwhen asked about hidden sets and approximately half did so. When this happened, children\nwere prevented from seeing inside and asked the question again.\nWhilst we were interested primarily in whether children would [1] infer or [2] try to\ncount the target set, there was at least one other perfectly reasonable strategy open to the\nchildren, which was to recount the set they had just counted. However, none of the children\nresorted to this approach. We also accepted attempts to count the unrelated set - when that set\nwas visible - as constituting correct responses. This was considered reasonable because the\ncardinal number for the counted set offered no clues as to the number of items in a set that\nwas not in one-to-one correspondence. It is permissible, on logical grounds, to count one set\nand infer the numerosity of a corresponding set. There are no grounds for extending the\ncardinal from the counted set to an unrelated set. Thus the unrelated sets of dolphins or tins of\nsoup acted as a check on children's grasp of the logico-mathematical relationship between\ncorresponding sets. Only two children successfully inferred the target set but failed to score\nbecause they made an incorrect inference about the unrelated set by extending the same\ncardinal to both sets.\nOne explanation for the pronounced influence of set-visibility might be that children\nwere learning about the demands of the task on the earlier trials (i.e., on Session 1) and only\nlater applying that knowledge. Although counterbalancing the order of presentation should\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  12\nhave ruled this out, we checked by re-coding responses in terms of the chronological (first,\nsecond, third and fourth) order the children experienced the four trials. There were 15 correct\ninferences made on Session 1, and 20 made on Session 2: 8, 7, 9 and 11 on the first, second,\nthird and fourth problems respectively. None of these differences were significant.\nInferences made after hiding the visible set. In the previous analyses, children were\nscored as correct only if they inferred spontaneously, without making any attempt to count the\ntarget set. Frydman and Bryant (1988) found that 10\/24 children in their study did make the\ncorrect inference after the experimenter hid the target set and asked if the child knew how\nmany there were without counting. In order to assess whether a similar effect occurred here,\nscores on trials in the visible condition were recoded to account for an inference whether it\nwas spontaneous or not (i.e., a child was scored correct if they made an inference before or\nafter the set had been hidden by the experimenter). The total scores on trials in the visible\ncondition rose from 7 to 23 (see the middle column of Table 1). Comparing the number of\ncorrect inferences made on hidden-sets trials with the number made on the recoded visible-set\ntrials, McNemar's test revealed there was no longer an effect of set-visibility; c2 (1, N = 40) =\n.31, p >.05. This reinforces the point that set-visibility was masking children's competence.\nOne question is whether the increased scores following recoding were specific to a particular\nscenario. There were 27 correct inferences made when the target set consisted of lions inside\nthe school and 24 when that set was the ice-creams inside the shop. Thus, following recoding,\nthere was still no effect of scenario.\nAlthough the small sample size in this first study precluded a statistical analysis of the\nroles that counting and sharing proficiency might play in children's ability to use cardinal\nextension, it is still interesting to note how well children were able to carry out these basic\nprocedures. Whilst all children knew how to divide the paired sets of lions and bicycles by\nplacing them in their appropriate locations, they were not as good at sharing the ice-creams\nout. Eleven children showed no ability to share evenly, 14 shared evenly on one trial, and 15\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  13\nchildren distributed equal shares on both trials. Sharing is an emerging skill for this age\ngroup.  As a measure of counting proficiency, we looked at the number of times children\ncounted the corresponding sets (i.e., the sets the experimenter asked the child to count before\nasking about the target and control sets) correctly across the two scenarios. Twenty-two out of\n40 were accurate on all four trials. A further nine children counted accurately on three of the\nfour trials. Thus, these 31 children counted accurately on 115 out of 124 trials, displaying\nlittle evidence that they had much difficulty enumerating the set-sizes we used. The remaining\nnine children showed relatively poor counting skills, counting inaccurately on at least two of\nthe four trials. This shows that counting, like sharing, was also an emerging skill for some of\nthese children (Counting proficiency was significantly correlated with sharing proficiency; r\n(39) = .41, p < .01). However, given the small number of inferences made spontaneously\n(35\/160), and the finding that most children were good at counting the sets we used, we find\nno grounds for suspecting that a failure to infer was due to a lack of self-confidence in their\ncounting accuracy. We explore this issue further in Experiment 2.\nDiscussion\nNearly half the children we tested showed no understanding that numerical\nequivalence could be inferred using cardinal extension when the target set was in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with a set already counted. The biggest influence on whether children would\ndisplay this ability was the visibility of the sets. Few children resisted counting when it was a\nstrategy available to them; being able to see the target set appeared to encourage them to\ncount. In contrast, hiding the target set seemed to promote numerical inferences. Clearly, for\nsome children, a reluctance to infer a corresponding numerosity cannot be accounted for an\nabsence of the requisite understanding. Children's knowledge may be underestimated if we\ntake unnecessary counting as evidence that they have not yet grasped the relationship between\ncorrespondence and cardinal numbers.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  14\nWe did not find reliable evidence that children were using the conceptual pairing of\nitems as a cue to numerical correspondence, an association that is absent when homogeneous\nitems are shared out. Both acts produce equivalent sets (when, as here, even numbers are\nused), and children did make more spontaneous inferences (albeit statistically non-significant)\nabout paired sets than they did about sets that resulted from sharing, although this difference\nlargely disappears when all correct inferences are considered. This is an issue we return to\nlater.\nExperiment 2\nThe results from Experiment 1 motivated a follow-up study that was more ambitious\nin scope, with the aim of replicating and extending the findings thus far. Hypotheses 1 and 2\nwere retained from Experiment 1 and re-assessed using more trials (and therefore, potentially\ngreater power). An additional issue that we wanted to investigate concerned the sizes of the\nsets to be inferred. One possibility is that children in Experiment 1 were reluctant to make\ninferences about another set because they were sensitive to the limitations in their counting\nproficiency. We know that three-year-olds are able to infer equivalence when small sets are\nused (two \/ three items: Cowan & Biddle, 1989; Sophian et al., 1995). But small numerosities\n- certainly up to four items - can be enumerated non-verbally (Chi & Klahr, 1975; Starkey and\nCooper, 1980; Trick & Pylyshyn, 1994), and can be compared without verbal counting\n(Strauss & Curtis, 1984; but see also Mix, Huttenlocher & Levine, 2002). The fact that young\nchildren judge more accurately when sets are small and visible raises the possibility that they\nare either making perceptual comparisons or enumerating the sets non-verbally. We therefore\nincluded small (two & three items) and larger sets (five & six items) in the stimuli. If children\nwere less likely to make a numerical inference because they lack confidence in their counting\nability (Gelman, 1972), we would expect larger sets to produce a different pattern of response\n(hypothesis 3). Determining children's counting proficiency permits an assessment of whether\nthey can infer numerosity above their counting range. By including two different age groups\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  15\n(three- versus four-year-olds) we hope to build a developmental model of children's abilities\nby looking at the interaction between these factors.\nFinally, we wanted to examine whether either of the two core skills of counting and\nsharing are associated with the ability to draw appropriate numerical inferences. Children\nbegin to grasp cardinality between the ages of 3 and 4 (Fuson, Pergament, Lyons, & Hall,\n1985; Wynn, 1990), around the same time as they are learning that sharing is a numerical\nactivity (Miller, 1984). Research into whether sharing competence is related to counting skill\nhas found no association between the two (Pepper & Hunting, 1998). However, Mix (1999a,\n1999b) and Saxe (1977, 1979) found children\u2019s counting accuracy correlates with the\nrecognition of numerical equivalence on set-comparison tasks. The ability to maintain one-to-\none correspondence between words and items when counting appears to offer a\ndevelopmental advance particularly where there are perceptual differences (e.g., in size,\ncolour, etc.) between sets being compared. However, it is less clear how the ability to count\nsingle sets accurately might help children gain the conceptual insight that sharing evenly\nproduces sets with the same cardinal. It is intuitively appealing to suspect that the ability to\nmaintain item-to-item correspondence between shares is a more likely predictor of this ability.\nMethod\nParticipants. Nineteen three-year-olds (3 years 8 months to 4 years 0 months; M = 3 years 10\nmonths, SD = 1.6 months) and 26 four-year-olds (4 years 1 month to 4 years 8 months; M = 4\nyears 4 months, SD = 2.2 months) from two pre-school playgroups in a predominantly White,\nurban population took part. None of the children had any identified learning difficulties. None\nhad taken part in Experiment 1.\nMaterials. As in Experiment 1 except there were three sets of toy animals (lions, pandas and\nladybirds). Ladybirds that 'flew' to school always acted as the control set (in place of\ndolphins) in Scenario 1, and lions and pandas were interchanged as the target set in an attempt\nto maintain children's interest in the tasks.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  16\nProcedure. The same as Experiment 1, except that in each scenario, the problems were\npresented with both small (2-3 items) and large (5-6 items) sets. Each child received 16\nproblems (8 in each Session), representing all the factorial combinations of the three factors.\nThe order of presentation was counterbalanced using a Latin Square design. The control sets\nwere only included on Session 2 in an attempt to reduce the time taken to administer the 16\ntrials and minimize the risk that children would withdraw from the study through fatigue or\ndisinterest.\nResults\nSpontaneous inferences. There was no significant difference between the number of\ninferences made on Sessions 1 and 2 (182 versus 201), and so data were pooled across\nsession. In the 'visible' condition, children tended to either infer spontaneously (141\/360\ntrials) or attempt to count the target set (177\/360), accounting for over 83% of responses in\nthis condition. The remaining responses were a mix of guesses (27) and \"Don't know\" (15).\nWhen the target set was hidden, children made many more inferences spontaneously\n(242\/360). The incorrect responses in the 'hidden' condition were, again, a mix of guesses (78)\nand \"Don't know\" (39), but no attempts were made to count the target set. This was a surprise,\nas we expected some children to try and remove the lid from the box to see inside, but none\ndid. Table 2 shows the mean number of times children made a spontaneous and appropriate 3\ninference about the items in the target set for each set-type and set-size.\nThe data satisfied the criteria for a parametric test, and ANOVA was therefore not\nonly suitable, but also corresponds with the analyses conducted by Sophian et al. (1995).

A significant interaction between\nScenario and Visibility, F (1 43) = 8.72, p < .05; hp2 = .17, showed that the influence of set\nvisibility was greater on 'Animals' problems than 'Ice-cream' problems. There were also two\nsignificant 3-way interactions, both including Age.\nThere was an interaction between Age, Visibility and Set size, F (1, 43) = 4.25, p <\n.05, hp2 = .09. While all simple effects of Visibility were significant on both small and large\nsets in both age groups, for three-year-olds, the effect of Visibility was most marked on small\nsets [F (1, 17) = 32.67, p < .001, hp2 = .65 vs F (1, 17) = 9.92, p < .01, hp2 = .35], whereas\nfor four -year-olds, the effect was most pronounced on large sets [F (1, 24) = 10.90, p < .005,\nhp2 = .30 vs F (1, 24) = 34.41, p < .001, hp2 = .58]. Three-year-olds are better at inferring\nsmall sets than large sets, especially when those sets are hidden. Conversely, four-year-olds\nare generally able to infer small sets regardless of whether they are hidden or not, but some\nhave difficulty inferring larger sets.\nA second 3-way interaction was found between Age, Set size and Scenario, F (1, 43)\n= 12.52, p < .005, hp2 = .23. All simple effects of Scenario were significant for both small\nand large sets for each age group. Thus, although the effect of scenario failed to reach\nsignificance in Experiment 1, the greater power in the design of Experiment 2 has revealed\nthis effect to be a reliable one. For three-year-olds, the effect of Scenario was most marked on\nsmall sets [F (1, 17) = 21.46, p < .001, hp2 = .54 vs F (1, 17) = 5.59, p < .05, hp2 = .24],\nwhereas for four -year-olds, the effect was most pronounced on large sets [F (1, 24) = 6.34, p\n< .05, hp2 = .20 vs F (1, 24) = 22.27, p < .001, hp2 = .47]. Three-year-olds are not as good at\ninferring equivalent shares as they are at recognizing that conceptually paired items share the\nsame cardinal, even when smaller sets are used. In contrast, four-year-olds are almost as good\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  19\nat recognizing the relationship between sharing and cardinality as they are at recognizing the\nrelationship between cardinality and conceptually paired items, although they have greater\ndifficulty in grasping that larger shares also have identical cardinals.\nThe other significant results were a main effect of Age, F (1, 43) = 9.96, p < .005, hp2\n= .19; a main effect of Set size, F (1, 43) = 33.14, p < .001, hp2 = .44; and a main effect of\nScenario, F (1, 43) = 38.23, p < .001, hp2 = .47. In general, older children made more\nspontaneous inferences than younger children; the number of spontaneous inferences was\ngreater when sets were small (supporting hypothesis 3); and children in both age groups were\nmore likely to recognize the equivalence of paired items than they were to recognize the\nnumerical equivalence that results from sharing things out evenly (supporting hypothesis 2).\nWe also investigated which, if either, of the core skills of counting and sharing,\npredicts the ability to infer the size of a corresponding set. Twenty-nine children (64%) in the\nsample were consistently able to maintain item-to-item correspondence when they shared\nsmall sets of 4 and 6 items, although only 20 were able to do so with larger sets of 10 and 12\nitems. This change was significant as determined by a McNemar c2 test for significance of\nchange, c2=6.4, p< .05. Sharing was an emerging skill for these children, and four-year-olds\nwere significantly better than three-year-olds, F (1, 43) = 4.16, p < .05, hp2 = .09. Similarly,\nchildren were better at counting small sets than large sets, F (1, 43) = 20.76, p < .001, hp2 =\n.33, although three year olds were in general just as good as the older children, F (1, 43) =\n1.38, p = .25, hp2 = .03. It seems that the ability to count sets of up to six items is in place by\nthe age of three. Forty-one children (91% of the sample) were able to count sets of 2-3 items\nwithout any difficulty, and over half (56%) consistently counted larger sets accurately.\nHierarchical multiple regression was carried out using the number of spontaneous,\ncorrect inferences as the dependent variable4. Counting proficiency was measured as the\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  20\nnumber of trials [\/16] where the child counted the corresponding set accurately (M = 14.78,\nSD = 2.27) and sharing proficiency as the number of trials [\/8] where the child maintained\nitem-to-item correspondence when sharing (M = 6.13, SD = 2.07).\n___________________________________________________________________________\nTable 3\nHierarchical Multiple Regression for variables predicting correct inferences\n___________________________________________________________________________\nVariable B SE B b DR2\n___________________________________________________________________________\nSpontaneous correct inferences1\nStep 1\nAge 2.31 1.04 .25* .19**\nStep 2\nCounting proficiency 0.38 .24 .19 .14**\nStep 3\nSharing proficiency 1.10 .27 .50** .19**\nAll correct inferences2 (including those made after hiding-the set)\nStep 1\nAge 1.70 .82 .19 .17**\nStep 2\nCounting proficiency 0.65 .19 .33* .28**\nStep 3\nSharing proficiency 1.16 .21 .54** .23**\n___________________________________________________________________________\n1 R2 = .52\n2 R2 = .68\n* p < .05\n** p < .01\n___________________________________________________________________________\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  21\nGiven that the previous analyses had revealed a significant main effect of age, this\nvariable was entered first (see Table 3), and was confirmed as a significant contributor to the\nexplained variance; r (44) = .43. Although the zero-order correlations between spontaneous\ninferences and both counting proficiency and sharing proficiency were significant (.45 and\n.66, respectively), we entered counting proficiency next, followed by sharing proficiency.\nTogether, these three variables explained over 50% of the total variance (see Table 3).\nMoreover, the model shows that sharing proficiency is a unique predictor above and beyond\nthe influence of age and counting proficiency (In contrast, counting proficiency failed to exert\na similar effect once sharing proficiency had been entered; DR2  = .30, p > .05).\nDiscriminating between the target and control sets. It is important to check that\nchildren were using cardinal extension to infer number because they knew that sets were\nequivalent and not simply using a last-word rule. Children could have made a correct\ninference about the target set by simply repeating the cardinal number for the counted set\nwithout grasping why the two sets had the same cardinal number. We recoded the data from\nSession 2 such that a child was scored as correct only if he or she also understood that the\ntarget set and control set had different cardinal values. If children were basing their judgments\non quantitative correspondence they should be more likely to use cardinal extension for that\nset than for another set they had no numerical knowledge of.\nThere were 201 correct spontaneous inferences made during Session 2. On 182 of\nthese trials (91%), children discriminated between the related target set and the control set.\nThere were only 26 instances of children extending the cardinal from the counted set to both\nthe target and control sets, with three-year-olds being more likely to make this mistake than\nfour-year-olds, F (1, 43) = 4.52, p < .05, hp2 = .10. Other than the effect of Age, there were\nno other significant influences on children extending the cardinal inappropriately; Set size,\nScenario and Visibility had no effect in this regard (all ps > .05). The control questions\nimplied that only two children did not understand that the same cardinals apply only to\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  22\nequivalent sets. Thus, performance confirms that nearly all the children who used cardinal\nextension did so because they understood the relationship between cardinality and\nquantitative equivalence.\n Inferences made after hiding a previously visible set. As in Experiment 1, scores on\ntrials in the visible condition were recoded to discriminate between inferences made\nspontaneously and those made after the experimenter hid the items and repeated the question\nbecause the child went to count them. The relevant data are shown in Table 2. Hiding-then-\nrepeating the question increased the number of inferences for almost every combination of\nAge, Scenario, Set size and Visibility. Overall, the number of valid inferences made rose from\na total of 383 to a total of 488. This is striking given that children went to count the visible\ntarget set on only145 trials. Thus, when they were prevented from counting, children went on\nto infer correctly over 70% of the time. The exception was when three-year-olds were asked\nabout large sets of ice-creams, and this led to a 4-way interaction between Scenario, Set size,\nVisibility and Age, F (1, 43) = 5.10, p < .05, hp2 = .11. Even when counting was prevented,\nby hiding the set, three-year-olds were relatively poor at inferring large sets of shared items\nrelative to small sets or paired sets. The interactions between Scenario and Visibility, F (1,\n43) = 7.22, p < .05, hp2 = .14, and between Scenario, Set size and Age, F (1, 43) = 4.88, p <\n.05, hp2 = .10, are both present as in the earlier analysis with similar estimates of effect sizes.\nWe are not clear why hiding the target sets (when children started to count them) reduced, but\ndid not eradicate, the effect of set-visibility. It is possible that some children, when denied\ntheir first-choice strategy, fail to search for an alternative, although we concede that our data\ncannot shed any light on this matter.\nRecoding the data also retains all four significant main effects of Set size, Age,\nScenario, and Visibility (all ps < .01, all hp2 > .08). The estimates of effect size are similar to\nbefore except that a smaller effect of Visibility (hp2 = .09 vs .57) confirms that being able to\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  23\nsee a target set encouraged unnecessary counting. Attempting to count the target set was not\nassociated with counting proficiency: r (44) = .13, p > .05. Furthermore, as Table 3 shows, it\nis still sharing proficiency that makes the biggest unique contribution to the model (r [44] =\n.74) over and above the contributions of counting proficiency (r [44] = .60) and age (r [44] =\n.41).\nIn sum, the various analyses support the notion that important precursor to recognizing\nthe link between corresponding sets and cardinal numbers are age-related developments in\nsharing and counting proficiency. Improvements in each of these basic skills are likely to be\nassociated with the ability to draw appropriate inferences about numerical relationships, but\nthis understanding often remains hidden when alternative strategies like counting are\navailable or seen to be encouraged.\nDiscussion\nAs in Experiment 1, the visibility of arrays appears to act as a cue to counting.\nHowever, the introduction of an extra age group revealed some important differences. In\ncontrast to Experiment 1, there was now much stronger evidence that the youngest children\nused conceptual pairing as a clue to numerical correspondence, and that the absence of this\nbond when homogeneous sets are shared out leads to something of an arithmetical impasse\nfor three-year-olds. Both acts produce equivalent sets, but younger children were more likely\nto infer equivalence if there was an established association between items. It is interesting to\ncompare this finding with other evidence that suggests a pattern of gradual de-\ncontextualization in children's recognition of numerical correspondence. In set-matching tasks\nthe degree of surface similarity (e.g., colour, shape) is important; three-year-olds recognize\nequivalence between homogeneous sets (e.g., one set of dots and another of shells) before\nthey are able to recognize the relationship between sets of mixed objects around the age of\nfour (Mix, 1999a). The level of perceptual support together with mastery of the counting\nroutine helps very young children to make quantitative comparisons, at least when those sets\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  24\nare small (fewer than five items). Notwithstanding this association, it remains unclear how the\nability to enumerate single sets helps children to grasp the fact that cardinal numbers have\nrelative value.\nIndeed, improvements in counting accuracy do not always correlate with the use of\ncounting strategies to make numerical comparisons (Saxe, 1979). Moreover, counting\nproficiency appears insufficient to predict children's understanding of number conservation\n(Piaget, 1952), indicating that even accurate enumerators still have something fundamental to\nlearn about the significance of cardinal numbers. Procedural mastery must be supplemented\nby conceptual insight if children are to apply their understanding of cardinality to simple\narithmetical problems like set-comparison (Muldoon, Lewis & Freeman, 2003). There are\ngrounds for believing that conceptual knowledge of a procedure like counting, and its\napplication as an arithmetical tool are linked (Sophian, 1997). Children need to learn the\nimplications of cardinal numbers for judgments about relative quantity, not simply the\nconnection between word-to-item correspondence and the cardinality of a single set (i.e., the\none-to-one correspondence principle - Gelman & Gallistel, 1978), if they are to recognize\nwhy counting is a useful arithmetical tool.\nChildren appear to progress from being able to infer small conceptually related pairs\nof items before grasping the numerical significance of sharing, and this develops in tandem\nwith age-related mastery of the sharing procedure. The use of small conceptually paired sets\nof items proved the least difficult of all our tasks and most children were able to infer\nappropriately. It is possible that conceptually paired sets, even pairs that are not found outside\nof children's games, as ours were, help children to access the fact that every item of one type\nhas a corresponding item of another type. Items were 'paired' before being separated out. This\nis not usually the case when items are shared out. When sharing, set-equivalence is\nestablished for the first time following the sharing routine, and item-to-item correspondence is\nsolely the result of temporal correspondence between distributions.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  25\nWe remain unsure whether the effect of set-type is due to the 'pairing' procedure or the\nconceptual link between items. This could be examined by adding a third scenario to the two\nwe employed here. This would entail 'sharing' paired items out without establishing the\nconceptual link beforehand (i.e., without asking children to put lions and bicycles together\nbefore separating them out). Putting one lion in the school, and then one bicycle in the bike\nshed, followed by a lion in school and another bicycle in the shed and so on, would mirror the\nsharing routine but would result in sets of different items. Comparing performance on this\nscenario with the present lions\/bicycles scenario would provide the effect of the original\npairing procedure. Also, contrasting the inferences about 'shared' lion\/bicycles in the new\nscenario with inferences about shared ice-creams would test the possibility that the greater\nsuccess we observed with conceptually paired items was a result of them evoking a stronger\n'equivalence' schema.\nOur findings also suggest why the children in Frydman and Bryant (1988) failed to\nshow the level of success achieved by younger children in Sophian et al. (1995). The success\nrate of 77% in Sophian's task was achieved only when sets were small (two\/three items).\nWhen sets were larger \u2013 five\/six items - performance dropped to less than 50%. It is possible\nthat the greater temporal demand of sharing large numbers of items prevents children from\nmonitoring their own maintenance of item-to-item correspondence, leading to a decrease in\nconfidence in their own sharing accuracy. The finding that age-related change in sharing\nproficiency was the best predictor of cardinal extension highlights the impact that an\nemerging mastery of temporal item-to-item correspondence has on children's awareness of\nsharing as a numerical activity. It is presumably easier to remember that each recipient has\nreceived the same if only 4 items are distributed than if 12 items are shared out. The fact that\nchildren made more correct inferences (albeit not to a statistically significant degree) with\nsmaller shares supports this explanation.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  26\n The finding that children use an effective strategy one moment only to discard it the\nnext is not a new one. Siegler (1995, 1996) offers a different explanation. Variability in\nperformance is a characteristic of a transitional phase in the development from one state of\nknowledge to another. Knowledge of different strategies, whether explicit or implicit, has\nbeen viewed as a marker of developmental readiness. A child might use different strategies to\nsolve two examples of the same mathematical problem on successive days (Siegler &\nShrager, 1984). If children use ineffective strategies when they have effective strategies at\ntheir disposal, development is a shift in the frequency with which the competing strategies are\nselected for use.\nGeneral Discussion\nAn important mathematical achievement for children is to recognize both [1] that\ncorresponding sets have the same cardinal number, and [2] that sharing evenly produces such\nsets. It is clear that the recognition of numerical equivalence for conceptually paired items\nprecedes the understanding that sharing also produces similar correspondence. Whilst three-\nyear-olds might be aware that sharing produces equivalent sets (Cowan & Biddle, 1989), and\nrecognize the relevance of numerical values for correspondence relations (Becker, 1989;\nSophian, 1988), our results provide further evidence that they have difficulty in connecting\nthe two. Procedural mastery of counting is typically in place by the age of three, but age-\nrelated improvements in the ability to maintain item-to-item correspondence in a temporal\naction predict children's developing understanding of the connection between sharing, set\nequivalence, and cardinality.\nOf those who could make an appropriate inference, the visibility of the sets influenced\nwhether they would display this understanding spontaneously. Many children were unable to\nresist counting when it was a strategy available to them. It is perhaps not surprising that being\nable to see a target set appears to encourage children to count (i.e., a familiar, 'direct' strategy)\nrather than infer (an 'indirect' strategy). Alternatively, it might be concluded that children tried\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  27\nto count items because they were not confident in the equivalence between the sets. We are\nless convinced by this possibility because having the target set hidden from the outset often\nrevealed their confidence; the number of spontaneous inferences made when sets were hidden\nwas over 70% higher than when sets were visible. It is worth noting here that these inferences\nabout hidden sets were not tentative guesses; there was rarely, if ever, any suggestion that\nchildren were not confident in their judgments (even in the minority of cases when those\njudgments turned out to be wrong). It seems that some children possess a nascent concept of\nequivalence but circumstances can mask this. Consequently, children's knowledge may be\nunderestimated if we take unnecessary counting as evidence that they have yet to grasp the\nlink between quantitative correspondence and cardinal numbers. Children's abilities may be\nrevealed one moment but remain unexpressed the next if they do not feel it necessary to apply\nthose particular skills.\nThere are at least five possible explanations why children might persevere with\ncounting even when they are able to infer. First, children typically count when asked 'How\nmany?' (e.g., Frye et al., 1989; Fuson, 1988; Wynn, 1990). Secondly, children may be\nencouraged to count by being asked 'How many?' for both sets; the effect of asking the same\nquestion twice has been clearly demonstrated on number conservation tasks (e.g., Rose &\nBlank, 1974; Samuel & Bryant, 1984). Thirdly, children may believe that counting is not\nmerely a check, but essential if one is to know whether shares are fair (Davis & Pitkethly,\n1990; Desforges & Desforges, 1980). Selective training where children are asked to make\nnumerical inferences about hidden arrays might reduce this type of perseveration. Using small\nsets of two and three items offers the potential for even three-year-olds to begin abstracting\ncardinal numbers in a way that perceptual cues to quantity often inhibit.\nIt is also possible, however, that performance was influenced by other domain-general\ninformation processing constraints. Working memory is needed for the active maintenance of\ntemporary representations (Baddeley, 1986), such as the cardinal for the corresponding set in\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  28\nthe present studies. Within-task forgetting is likely to impact on children\u2019s performance on\nmathematical tasks, and there is evidence suggests that they employ a task-switching strategy\nwhen carrying out a counting span task that incorporates memory and processing\nrequirements (Towse & Hitch, 1995; Towse, Hitch & Hutton, 1998). That is, they engage\neither in memory operations, or counting operations, but not both simultaneously. Thus a\nfourth explanation is that children simply forgot information encoded in memory when asked\nan additional question about a different set.\nA fifth explanation is that the development of executive skills plays an important role.\nThe results from Experiment 2 show that the ability to judge numerical equivalence using\ncardinal extension develops sometime between the ages of three and four. A concomitant\ngrowth in children's reflection on their own behaviour between these ages increases the\namount of control they exert over their actions, but younger children are prone to ignore rules,\neven when they are able to verbally demonstrate appropriate rule-knowledge (Zelazo, Frye &\nRapus, 1996). Thus executive limitations might account for the fact that many children in the\npresent studies apparently knew the rule 'Extend the cardinal from the corresponding set to\nthe target set' but did not apply it across all trials. Further work is needed to resolve which, if\nany, of these alternative explanations is valid.\nTo summarize, we began by noting that children\u2019s numerical processing is often\ncharacterized by a perplexing mix of abilities and limitations (Feigenson et al., 2004). The\npresent datasets show that, even within a particular paradigm (that is, with formally\ncomparable tasks), there can be substantial differences in what children do. However, the data\nalso help us to understand the basis of such variability. We argue that children can make\ninferences about numerical correspondence, but the physical presence of each set draws\nchildren towards counting in any case, and the set array contributes to this tendency too. We\nalso argue, in line with others (Davis & Pitkethly, 1990; Desforges & Desforges, 1980;\nFrydman and Bryant, 1988) that three-year-olds have yet to develop a full appreciation of the\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  29\nconnection between sharing and cardinality. They are in a transitional stage, in which the\nconcept of one-to-one correspondence, although central to mathematical reasoning and an\nunderstanding of what number represents (e.g., Piaget, 1952; Russell, 1960), is fledgling in\ncharacter. Although at this stage little is known about how children's understanding of sharing\ndevelops, we suggest that improvements in sharing proficiency are likely to be associated\nwith a greater understanding of sharing as a quantitative exercise. Moreover, presenting\nchildren with arithmetical situations that preclude set enumeration may be especially helpful\nin directing them towards the conceptual realization that counting \u201cbecause it\u2019s there\u201d is\nunnecessary.\nSharing and Numerical Correspondence Revisited  30\nReferences\nBaddeley, A.

For example, if the\ncorresponding set contained 5 items but the child counted 6, he or she was scored correct if\nthey inferred the target set to be 6. Three children scored on this basis on one occasion each.\n2 The Sign test compares the number of positive and negative differences between two\nrepeated measures. For example, comparing the number of children who are better at inferring\nhidden sets (e.g., positive difference) with the number of children who are better at inferring\nvisible sets (e.g., negative difference), where the Null hypothesis is that the number of\npositive and negative differences will be the same.\n3 Children were scored as correct if their inferred number matched the cardinal for the\ncorresponding set irrespective of whether that set had been counted accurately or not.\nChildren's grasp of cardinality can be masked by procedural errors. For example, if the\ncorresponding set contained 5 items but the child counted 6, he or she was scored correct if\nthey inferred the target set to be 6. Three children scored on this basis on one occasion each.\n4 We combined performance on both scenarios into separate dependent variables for [1]\nspontaneous inferences and [2] all inferences (i.e., including those made after the target set\nhad been hidden). Tests revealed a robust degree of reliability in each case; [1] = .89, [2] =\n.90.\n"}
