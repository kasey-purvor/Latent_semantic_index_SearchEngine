There are now numerous reports of electron\nfield emission from a range of CNTs consisting of isolated\nsingle tubes,5 well ordered arrays of tubes,6 random mats,7\nand, lately, from CNTs embedded in polymer composites.8\nIndeed, the high aspect ratio that is found with CNTs is also\nfound in a wide range of nanotip cold emitter materials such\nas Si nanowires,9 W nanowires,10 Cu2S nanowires,11 and\nnanobelts of MoO312 making these nonplanar materials a\ncreditable electron source. There have also been significant\ntechnological developments since the first report of carbon\nnanomaterials grown at low temperature.13 To date, both\nfield emission from room temperature grown nanofibers14 as\nwell as CNTs growth on plastic15 have been reported.\nDespite the different material systems involved, each of\nthese studies possess at least one fact in common. The emit-\nter material is not a flat cathode but has features possessing\nhigh aspect ratios. Field emission measurements that are\nmade often attempt to quantify the behavior in terms of the\napplied electric field and the local electric field at the nan-\notip, via the field enhancement factor, \u0001. Since the local\nelectric field required for emission will not possess a depen-\ndence on the electrode separation, D, one would expect that\nmeasurements of the applied threshold field would also not\npossess a dependence on the relative separation of the elec-\ntrodes, and that the applied electric field would be given\nsimply as V\/D, where V is the applied potential difference. In\nthis letter we show that this is not the case for CNTs found\non a carbon nanorope \u0001CNR\u0002. Furthermore, this behavior is\nshown not to be unique to nanotubes or nanoropes but also to\napplicable to all nonplaner emitters. Therefore, the implica-\ntions are significant to most tip emitter structures used by\nscientists and technologists. Computer simulations further\nconfirm the experimental observation. Our results show that\nthe definition of the field enhancement factor must be modi-\nfied in this situation and that this revised definition is appli-\ncable to a wide range of nonplanar cathodes.\nA carbon deposit was prepared on a graphite cathode\nelectrode in an arc discharge system in a helium atmosphere\nat a pressure of 500 Torr. This deposit contained multiwalled\ncarbon nanotubes \u0001MWCNTs\u0002 which self-assembled into\nbundles or ropes of micron dimensions when post-treated by\ngrinding and subjected to ultrasonic treatment. In a Cam-\nbridge Stereoscan 250 III scanning electron microscope\n\u0001SEM\u0002, the CNR has the appearance \u0001not shown here\u0002 of\nhigh aspect ratio needles that were 1\u20132 mm in length with an\nend diameter of \u000510 \u0002m. The end of the CNRs exhibited\nprotruding MWCNTs of a few microns in length and ran-\ndomly spaced, and diameters of around 100 nm. A CNR with\nan end radius of 8 \u0002m was selected and adhered to a nickel\ntip by a conducting silver epoxy. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 is a SEM mi-\ncrograph of the CNR with protruding CNT, and anode elec-\ntrode, the inset being the anode and cathode experimental\nsetup. An iron tip was electrolytically etched in sodium hy-\ndroxide solution to approximately the same dimensions as\nthe CNR for comparison of field emission characteristics as-\nsociated primarily with geometry.\nField emission \u0001FE\u0002 measurements were performed in a\nmodified Cambridge Stereoscan 250 III SEM configured\nwith a steel probe anode with an end radius of 5 \u0002m and a\nFE sample stage mounted on the SEM sample stage. The FE\ntesting system was then connected to the sample stage and\nanode via vacuum feedthroughs.

A positive voltage was applied to the\nanode and ramped from 0 V until an emission current of 100\nnA was measured and then reduced to 0 V again. This volt-\nage cycle was performed four times for each separate FE test\nand the threshold field, ET, defined as the applied electric\nfield required to extract an emission current of l nA from the\nsample recorded. Measurements of emission from both the\nCNR and the etched iron tip were performed as a function of\nanode-sample separation. In order to remove any possible\neffects due to the conditioning of cathodes with time,16 the\ntesting at different anode-sample separations was not con-\nducted in a sequential increasing or decreasing mode; but in\na random sequence. As the I\u2013V measurements were per-\nformed in a SEM, accurate measurements of the anode-\nsample separation could be made. The SEM electron beam\nand collector voltage were switched off when the FE testing\nwas performed to eliminate any influence on the measure-\nments. While the end of the iron tip was initially jagged\nrelative to the CNR, the initial FE measurement resulted in it\nbecoming smooth \u0001on the nanoscale\u0002 and geometrically simi-\nlar \u0001on the micron scale\u0002 to the CNR. This change in mor-\nphology is attributed to ohmic heating at the tip and melting\nthe iron due to high current densities in the sharp asperities\npresent initially at the end of the tip. No other changes in the\nmorphology of either sample were observed after subsequent\nFE testing. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 is a SEM image of the CNR and Fe\nanode. The main SEM is a higher magnification of the end of\nthe CNR with protruding CNTs clearly visible. The anode-\nsample separation was accurately measured by the SEM and\ntaken as the distance between the tip of the anode and the tip\nof the highest protruding CNT.\nValues of threshold electric field \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004, were ex-\ntracted from typical I\u2013V curves. In this case, the applied elec-\ntric field, Eapplied, is defined as the applied voltage divided by\nthe separation; D, between the end of the anode and cathode\ntips. Typical ET-D curves are shown in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. The data in\nFig. 1\u0001b\u0002 clearly shows that the CNR has a lower value of ET\nrelative to the iron tip, over the range of electrode gaps\ntested. Figure 1\u0001b\u0002 also shows that, for both samples, ET\ndrops with increasing electrode gap, with the rate of decrease\nreducing with increasing electrode gap.\nSince local threshold field, ET\nlocal\n, can be expressed as\nET\napplied \/\u0001, and the reduction of ET\napplied which subsequently\nincreases with a flattening of D, implies that the enhance-\nment factor must exhibit a dependence with D. Indeed to\nmaintain electrode geometry independence for values of\nET\nlocal\n, \u0001 must increase with D before saturating. In order to\ntest this hypothesis we have simulated; \u0001i\u0002 a bare iron tip\nemitter with nonplanar anode, \u0001ii\u0002 an iron tip emitter with\nnine randomly arranged CNT with a nonplanar anode and,\n\u0001iii\u0002 a single CNT with a planar anode. The commercially\navailable SILVACO\u212217,18 simulation package was employed\nto simulate the emission from the experimental setup. The\nFE properties of a metallic cathode with a semicircular tip of\nradius of 4 \u0002m \u0001mimicking the etched iron tip\u0002, and an iden-\ntical cathode but with seven metallic randomly positioned\nspikes with approximate lengths and widths of 2 \u0002m and\n100 nm, respectively \u0001mimicking the CNR\u0002. Simulated FE\nmeasurements were made between the cathodes and an iron\nanode with a tip radius of 5 \u0002m using anode tip to CNT\/iron\nprobe tip gaps of 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, and 400 \u0002m. The\nvariation of ET vs separation for an undecorated tip and a tip\ndecorated with seven nanotubes is shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. The\ndecreasing trend of threshold field is the same as that of the\nexperimental work.\nWe further proceeded to simulate an isolated nanotube\nand vary anode to CNT separation, recording the threshold\nfield to see if the effects experienced on isolated tubes are\nsimilar to randomly arranged ones. Metallic nanotubes,\nwhich allow us to ignore the effects of field penetration, of\nheights 2, 4, and 6 \u0002m with constant 200 nm radius were\nsimulated with anode to cathode separation increased until\nan emission current was no longer observed from the single\nnanotube. The value of ET was seen to decrease as the anode\nelectrode was moved away from the tip of the tube, decreas-\ning to a saturated value, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002, which is\nsimilar to the trend seen experimentally for the protruding\nnanotubes of the CNR and etched iron probe, and for simu-\nlated CNR and iron probe. Our results clearly point to a need\nfor an understanding of the variation of \u0001 with D. Figure 3\nshows the variation of the enhancement factor \u00011, \u0001closed\nshapes\u0002 for an applied field of V\/D. It is clear that \u00011 de-\ncreases with D before flattening out. This behavior is clearly\nat odds with the required behavior discussed in the literature\nof a constant threshold field. As an alternative definition we\ndefine \u00012 \u0001open shapes\u0002, as the enhancement factor when the\napplied field is taken as V\/ \u0001D\u2212h\u0002. In this way we are con-\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Scanning electron microscope image of the carbon nanorope and\nfield emission anode. Protruding CNT are clearly visible from the CNR.

This definition is acceptable as it\nmimics the case of the local field distribution between a ball\nanode and planer cathode. For large values of D, the curves\nconverge in the limit of D\u0003h to a value depicted by the\ngeometric properties of the emitter alone and not the location\nof the anode. Three sets of data are presented for nanotubes\nof height 2, 4, and 6 \u0002m with a radius of 200 nm. The values\nof \u00011 and \u00012 can be seen to converge to similar values for a\ngiven nanotube. This highlights that at sufficient separation\n\u0001when D\u0003h\u0002 the enhancement factor is dependent on the\ngeometrical properties of the nanotubes alone and not D.\nThe results of the experiments, supported by these simu-\nlations demand that for a nonplanar emitter and alternative\ndefinition of field enhancement factor must be considered.\nBoth expressions for \u00011 and \u00012 can be expressed as\n\u0001 =\nElocal\nV \u0004 \u0001D \u2212 \u0005h\u0002\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere 0\u0006\u0005\u00061 encapsulates all possible configurations. The\nsimulation results tie in with the increased threshold field\nseen in both experimental and simulated results. The increase\nin threshold field and decrease in \u0001 has also been shown\nexperimentally elsewhere.19 Note that for planar cathodes\nand planar anodes we recover the usual definition of \u0001.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that for tip based field\nemitters the location of the anode plane significantly affects\nthe field emission capabilities of the emitter, with an increase\nin threshold field as the anode electrode approaches the tip of\nthe emitter. Furthermore, the geometric field enhancement\nfactor for the emitter is greatly reduced when the anode to tip\nseparation is decreased.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership and Carbon Based Electronics Programs for\nfunding this research.\n1S.
