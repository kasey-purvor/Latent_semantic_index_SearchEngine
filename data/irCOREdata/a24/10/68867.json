In particular, the electronic Fermi line in each of its valleys\nhas a strong p \u2192 \u2212p asymmetry due to trigonal warping, which suppresses the weak localization\neffect. We show that weak localization in bilayer graphene may be present only in devices with\npronounced intervalley scattering, and we evaluate the corresponding magnetoresistance.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b, 72.15.Rn, 73.43.Qt, 81.05.Uw\nWeak localization (WL), which universally occurs in a\nbroad range of disordered conductors [1, 2] is caused by\nthe constructive interference of electron waves circling\nthe same closed path in opposite directions. It is sen-\nsitive to the presence of an external magnetic field as\nmanifested in a negative magnetoresistance (MR) at low\ntemperatures.\nUsually qualitative features of WL do not depend on\nthe detail of the electronic band structure and crystalline\nsymmetry, with the exception of spin-orbit coupling [2,\n3]. In gapful multi-valley semiconductors only the size of\nthe WL effect may depend on the number of valleys and\nthe strength of intervalley scattering [4, 5, 6]. The low-\nfield MR, \u2206\u03c1(B) \u2261 \u03c1(B) \u2212 \u03c1(0), in a two dimensional\nelectron gas or a thin metallic film [1, 2, 4, 7] in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling is characterized by\n\u2206\u03c1(B) = \u2212s\u03b8e\n2\u03c12\n2pih\nF\n(\nB\nB\u03d5\n)\n, B\u03d5 =\n~c\n4De\n\u03c4\u22121\u03d5 .\nHere F (z) = ln z + \u03c8(1\n2\n+ 1z ), \u03c8(z) is the digamma func-\ntion, \u03c4\u03d5 is the coherence time, D is the diffusion coeffi-\ncient, and the integer factor s\u03b8 depends on whether or not\nstates in nv valleys are mixed by disorder. This factor is\ncontrolled by the ratio \u03b8 = \u03c4i\/\u03c4\u03d5 between the intervalley\nscattering time \u03c4i and the coherence time \u03c4\u03d5. In mate-\nrials such as Mg, ZnO, Si, Ge (listed in Table I) where\neach of the Fermi surface pockets is p \u2192 \u2212p symmet-\nric, intervalley scattering reduces the size of the WL MR\nfrom that described by s\u221e = 2nv when \u03b8 = \u03c4i\/\u03c4\u03d5 \u001d 1 to\ns0 = 2 for \u03b8 \u001c 1.\nA more interesting scenario develops in a multi-valley\nsemimetal, where the localization properties can be in-\nfluenced by the absence of p \u2192 \u2212p symmetry of the\nelectronic dispersion within a single valley. Graphene\n[10, 11, 12] in a graphene-based transistor [13, 14, 15]\nrepresents an example of such a system. In this Letter,\nwe demonstrate how the asymmetry in the shape of the\nFermi surface in each of its two valleys determines the\nobservable WL behavior. In contrast with conventional\nmaterials (see Table I), WL MR in bilayer graphene is\nincreased by the intervalley scattering, from s\u221e = 0 at\n\u03b8 \u2192\u221e to s0 = 2 at \u03b8 \u001c 1.\nBilayer graphene consists of two coupled graphitic\nmonolayers arranged according to Bernal stacking, see\n[12] for details of the lattice configuration. Its unit cell\ncontains sites A,B and A\u02dc, B\u02dc. Sites A,B and A\u02dc, B\u02dc belong\nto the honeycomb lattice in the bottom and top layers,\nrespectively, with sites B being exactly below A\u02dc. The\nhexagonal Brillouin zone of the bilayer has two inequiv-\nalent corners K+ and K\u2212 [16]. The four branches of its\nelectronic spectrum [17] form one pair split by about \u00b1\u03b31\n(the interlayer coupling) and two low-energy branches\n(formed by states based upon sublattices A and B\u02dc) which\nare degenerate at K+ and K\u2212. The low-energy branch\ncan be described [12] using a Hamiltonian,\nH\u02c62L = \u2212 1\n2m\n[(\np2x \u2212 p2y\n)\n\u03c3x + 2pxpy\u03c3y\n]\n+ h\u02c6w, (1)\nh\u02c6w = v3\u03a0z (px\u03c3x \u2212 py\u03c3y) ,\nwhich acts in the space of four-component wave func-\ntions \u03a6 = [\u03c6K+,A, \u03c6K+,B\u02dc, \u03c6K\u2212,B\u02dc, \u03c6K\u2212,A]. Here, \u03c6\u03be,\u03b1 is\nan electron amplitude on the sublattice \u03b1 = A, B\u02dc in the\nvalley \u03be = K+,K\u2212, \u03c3x,y,z and \u03a0x,y,z are Pauli matrices\nacting in sublattice and valley space, respectively [16].\nIn slightly doped graphene, two disconnected Fermi lines\nsurround the corners of the Brillouin zone.\nThe first term in Eq. (1) is the leading contribution in\nthe nearest neighbor approximation of the bilayer tight\nbinding model [12]. It includes intralayer hopping A \u001c\nB and A\u02dc \u001c B\u02dc (that leads to the dispersion \u000f = \u00b1pv\nnear K\u00b1 in a monolayer) and interlayer A\u02dc\u001c B hopping,\nand it yields a parabolic spectrum \u000f = \u00b1p2\/2m with\nm = \u03b31\/2v\n2. It has been noticed [12] that quasiparticles\nTABLE I: WL factor s\u03b8 in conductors with a multi-valley con-\nduction band and negligible spin-orbit coupling. The factor\ns\u03b8 is specified for two limiting cases, no inter-valley scattering\n\u03b8 = \u03c4i\/\u03c4\u03d5 \u2192\u221e, and for fast inter-valley scattering \u03b8 \u2192 0.\nnv s\u221e s0\n1 Mg films [8], ZnO wells [9] 2 -\n2, 6 Si MOSFETs [4, 5] 2nv 2\n2 Si\/SiGe wells [6] 4 2\n2 graphene 0 2\n2described by this term are chiral [18]: their plane wave\nstates are eigenstates of an operator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = \u22121\nfor electrons in the conduction band, and \u03c3n2 = 1 for\nthe valence band, where n2(p) = (cos(2\u03d5), sin(2\u03d5)) for\np = (pcos\u03d5, psin\u03d5). For an electron in the conduction\nband, the plane wave state is\n\u03a6K,\u00b1p = \u00b1e\n\u00b1ipx\/~\n\u221a\n2\n(\ne\u2212i\u03d5| \u2191\u3009K,\u00b1p \u2212 ei\u03d5| \u2193\u3009K,\u00b1p\n)\n,\nwhere | \u2191\u3009K+,p = [1, 0, 0, 0], | \u2193\u3009K+,p = [0, 1, 0, 0] and\n| \u2191\u3009K\u2212,p = [0, 0, 1, 0], | \u2191\u3009K\u2212,p = [0, 0, 0, 1], and the fac-\ntors e\u00b1i\u03d5 take into account the chirality.\nThe term h\u02c6w in Eq. (1) originates from a weak di-\nrect A \u001c B\u02dc interlayer coupling. This one gives rise to\np\u2192 \u2212p asymmetry in the dispersion of electrons. It also\nleads to a Lifshitz transition in the shape of the Fermi\nline of the 2D electrons which takes place when \u000fF \u223c \u000fL =\n1\n4\n\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2 thus ne > nL \u2248 v23\u03b321\/(2pi~2v4) \u223c 1011cm\u22122\n(using v3\/v \u223c 0.1, Ref. [12]). As long as ne < nL, the\nFermi line in each valley is split into four pockets [12]. For\nne > nL, h\u02c6w can be treated as a perturbation leading to a\ntrigonal deformation of a single-connected Fermi line and\nasymmetry of the electron dispersion inside each valley\nillustrated in Fig. 1: \u000f(K\u00b1,p) 6= \u000f(K\u00b1,\u2212p), though, due\nto time-reversal symmetry [19], \u000f(K\u00b1,p) = \u000f(K\u2213,\u2212p).\nExisting graphene structures are strongly affected by\ncharges trapped in the underlying substrate or on its sur-\nface. Such disorder (as well as the inhomogeneity of the\nelectron density) obscures the intricate details of the elec-\ntronic Fermi surface at the lowest energies, \u000f\u001c \u000fL. How-\never the interplay between the two terms in H\u02c62L result-\ning in intravalley asymmetry of the electronic dispersion\nmanifests itself in the WL behavior.\nThe WL correction to conductivity in disordered con-\nK +K -\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K - , - p ) e ( K + , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\np\nFIG. 1: Fermi lines (solid lines) in the vicinity of two inequiv-\nalent valleys K+ and K\u2212 of the hexagonal Brillouin zone\n(dashed line). Trigonal warping produces asymmetry of the\ndispersion at each valley \u000f(K\u00b1,p) 6= \u000f(K\u00b1,\u2212p), where mo-\nmentum p is determined with respect to the center of the\nvalley, but the effects of warping in the valleys have opposite\nsigns, \u000f(K\u00b1,p) = \u000f(K\u2213,\u2212p). The bilayer lattice configura-\ntion is described in detail in [12].\nductors is a result of the interference of electrons prop-\nagating around closed loops in opposite directions [1].\nSuch interference is constructive in materials without\nspin-orbit coupling, since electrons acquire exactly the\nsame phase when travelling along two time-reversed\npaths. It is usually described [1] in terms of the particle-\nparticle correlation function, Cooperon. To evaluate WL\nin bilayer graphene, we use a Cooperon matrix C\u03be\u00b5\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032\nwhere subscripts label the sublattice state of incoming\n\u03b1\u03b2 and outgoing \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 pairs of electrons and superscripts\ndescribe the valley state of incoming \u03be\u00b5 and outgoing \u03be\u2032\u00b5\u2032\npairs. Following the example of Cooperons for a spin 1\n2\n[2], we classify Cooperons as singlets and triplets in terms\nof sublattice and valley indices CM1M2S1S2 . For example,\nM = 0 is a \u201dvalley-singlet\u201d,M = x, y, z are three \u201dvalley-\ntriplet\u201d components; S = 0 is a \u201dsublattice-singlet\u201d and\nS = x, y, z are \u201dsublattice-triplet\u201d components.\nWith regards to the sublattice composition of Cooper-\nons in disordered bilayer graphene, only modes CMz\n(with S = z [20]) are relevant. Indeed, a correlator\nC \u223c \u03a6K+,p\u03a6K\u2212,\u2212p describing two plane waves, \u03a6K+,p\nand \u03a6K\u2212,\u2212p, propagating in opposite directions along\na ballistic segment of a closed trajectory contains only\nsublattice-triplet terms,\nC \u223c\n(\n| \u2191\u3009K+,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2212,\u2212p+| \u2193\u3009K+,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2212,\u2212p\n)\n\u2212 e2i\u03d5| \u2191\u3009K+,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2212,\u2212p\u2212 e\u22122i\u03d5| \u2193\u3009K+,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2212,\u2212p,\nand the terms corresponding to CMx,y disappear after av-\neraging over the direction of momentum, \u3008e\u00b12i\u03d5\u3009\u03d5 = 0.\nWith regards to the valley composition of relevant\nCooperon modes, the symmetry of the electronic dis-\npersion within each valley plays a pivotal role. For\na conventional metal [8] or semiconductor [4, 5, 6, 9],\ntwo phases \u03d1\b and \u03d1\t acquired by an electron while\npropagating in a clockwise and anti-clockwise direction\nalong the same loop are exactly equal, so that the in-\nterference enhances backscattering and leads to WL [1].\nAny closed trajectory is a combination of ballistic in-\ntervals characterized by momenta \u00b1pj (for two direc-\ntions) and time of flight tj . The asymmetry of the elec-\ntron dispersion in bilayer graphene, due to h\u02c6w, gener-\nates a phase difference \u03b4 \u2261 \u03d1\b \u2212 \u03d1\t =\n\u2211\n\u03b4j , where\n\u03b4j \u223c [\u000f(pj) \u2212 \u000f(\u2212pj)]tj = 2h\u02c6w(pj)tj . Since \u03b4j are ran-\ndom uncorrelated, the mean square of \u03b4 accumulated\nover the time interval t =\n\u2211\nj tj can be estimated as\n\u3008\u03b42\u3009 \u223c \u3008(tj h\u02c6w(pj))2\u3009t\/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the transport time\nand l \u2261 vF \u03c4 is the mean free path [18]. This determines\nthe relaxation rate,\n\u03c4\u22121w =\n{\n1\n2~2\n\u03c4\u3008Trh\u02c62w(p)\u3009\u03d5 = pinLl2\u03c4\u22121, pinLl2 < 1\n\u03c4\u22121, pinLl\n2 > 1\n,\n(2)\nwhich suppresses the intravalley Cooperons Cxz , C\ny\nz . We\nestimate that for the recently studied bilayers [11] with\nne = 2.5 \u00d7 1012cm\u22122, \u03c4w \u223c \u03c4 and l \u223c 0.1\u00b5m. A\n3similar situation occurs in bilayer structures studied by\nR. Gorbachev et al. [21]. Due to time-reversal symme-\ntry [\u000f(K\u00b1,p) = \u000f(K\u2213,\u2212p)] [19], signs of warping in the\nvalleys K+ and K\u2212 are opposite, so that it does not sup-\npress the intervalley Cooperons C0z and C\nz\nz .\nThe above qualitative analysis indicates that strong\ntrigonal warping should be associated with the suppres-\nsion of WL in bilayer graphene when electrons do not\nchange their valley state upon scattering. To give a\nquantitative description of this prediction we used the\ndiagrammatic technique and related the WL correction\nto conductivity to the surviving Cooperon modes [7],\n\u03b4g =\n2e2D\npi~\n(\u2212Czz + C0z \u2212 Cxz \u2212 Cyz ) , (3)\nwhere C (r, r) are the Cooperon propagators taken at co-\ninciding coordinates. For completeness, in Eq. (3) we\nhave retained the intravalley Cooperons Cx,yz , though\nthey are strongly suppressed by trigonal warping. Follow-\ning their suppression, the WL correction is determined\nby the intervalley modes C0z and C\nz\nz but, in the absence\nof intervalley scattering, the contributions of C0z and C\nz\nz\nare equal in magnitude, so that they cancel. Intervalley\nscattering due to atomically sharp scatterers breaks this\nexact cancellation and partially restores the WL effect.\nA general form of time-reversal-symmetric [19] dis-\norder in bilayer graphene can be represented follow-\ning the method used in the monolayer graphene studies\n[22, 23, 24]. That is, we determine irreducible representa-\ntions of the symmetry group of the bilayer crystal formed\nby 4 \u00d7 4 matrices acting in the basis of states | \u2191\u3009K+,p,\n| \u2193\u3009K+,p, | \u2193\u3009K\u2212,p, | \u2191\u3009K\u2212,p, and, then, use them to con-\nstruct the general t\u2192 \u2212t symmetric disorder u\u02c6(r):\nu\u02c6 = u(r) +\n\u2211\n\u03a3s\u039blusl(r); s, l = x, y, z; (4)\n\u03a3x = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3x, \u03a3y = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3y , \u03a3z = \u03a00 \u2297 \u03c3z ,\n\u039bx = \u03a0x \u2297 \u03c3z, \u039by = \u03a0y \u2297 \u03c3z , \u039bz = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c30.\nHere, ~\u03a3 = (\u03a3x,\u03a3y,\u03a3z) and ~\u039b = (\u039bx,\u039by,\u039bz)\nform two mutually commuting algebras [\u03a3s1 ,\u03a3s2 ] =\n2i\u03b5s1s2s3\u03a3s3 , [\u039bl1 ,\u039bl2 ] = 2i\u03b5\nl1l2l3\u039bl3 , and [~\u03a3, ~\u039b] = 0.\nBoth \u03a3s and \u039bl invert sign upon time reversal [19],\nwhereas their products remain invariant under t \u2192 \u2212t\ntransformation. The first term in u\u02c6 represents the po-\ntential of remote charges which is made short range by\nscreening by 2D electrons \u3008u(r)u(r\u2032)\u3009 \u223c u2\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032). It\naffects electrons in both layers equally and manifests it-\nself through the scattering rate \u03c4\u221210 = pi\u03b3u\n2\/~2 where\n\u03b3 = m\/(2pi~2) is the density of states per spin in each\nvalley [7]. Disorder uzz generates a random difference\nbetween energies on the A and B\u02dc sites (bottom and top\nlayers). The two terms containing uxz and uyz origi-\nnate from fluctuations in hopping and they scatter elec-\ntrons within each valley, whereas the other terms in u\u02c6\ntake into account intervalley scattering. For simplicity,\nwe assume that different types of disorder are uncorre-\nlated, \u3008usl(r)us\u2032l\u2032(r\u2032)\u3009 = u2sl\u03b4ss\u2032\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032), and, on av-\nerage, isotropic in the x \u2212 y plane: u2xl = u2yl \u2261 u2\u22a5l,\nu2sx = u\n2\nsy \u2261 u2s\u22a5.

Intervalley scattering also\nleads to the relaxation of C0z although it does not affect\nthe valley-symmetric mode Czz . All the scattering mech-\nanisms limit the transport time \u03c4\u22121 = \u03c4\u221210 +\n\u2211\nsl \u03c4\n\u22121\nsl .\nTwo low-gap modes C0z and C\nz\nz obey the following\nequations,[\n2\u03c4\u22121\ni\n+ \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 +DP\u02dc\n2 \u2212 i\u03c9\n]\nC0z (r, r\n\u2032) = \u03b4 (r\u2212 r\u2032) ,[\n\u03c4\u22121\u03d5 +DP\u02dc\n2 \u2212 i\u03c9\n]\nCzz (r, r\n\u2032) = \u03b4 (r\u2212 r\u2032) , (5)\nwhere we included an external magnetic field, B = rotA\nin P\u02dc = (i\u2207+ 2ec~A), and inelastic decoherence, \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 (T ).\nEquations (3,5) yield the zero field WL correction to\nthe resistivity and the WL MR,\n\u03b4\u03c1 (0)\n\u03c1\n=\ne2\u03c1\npih\nln\n(\n1 + 2\n\u03c4\u03d5\n\u03c4i\n)\n+ \u03b40, (6)\n\u2206\u03c1(B)\n\u03c1\n= \u2212e\n2\u03c1\npih\n[\nF (\nB\nB\u03d5\n)\u2212 F ( B\nB\u03d5 + 2Bi\n)\n]\n+ \u03b4(B),\nwhere B\u03d5,i = ~c\/(4De\u03c4\u03d5,i). Equation (6) gives a com-\nplete description of the crossover between two extreme\nregimes mentioned at the beginning [7]. It also in-\ncludes small contributions of the suppressed intraval-\nley Cooperons, \u03b40 = [2e\n2\u03c1\/(pih)] ln(\u03c4\u03d5\u03c4\u2217\/[\u03c4(\u03c4\u2217 + \u03c4\u03d5)])\nand \u03b4(B) = \u2212[2e2\u03c1\/(pih)]F [B\/(B\u03d5 + B\u2217)], where \u03c4\u22121\u2217 =\n\u03c4\u22121w +2\u03c4\n\u22121\nz +\u03c4\n\u22121\ni\nand B\u2217 = ~c\/(4De\u03c4\u2217). This permits us\nto account for a possible difference between the warping\ntime \u03c4w and the transport time \u03c4 . According to Eq. (6)\nWL MR in bilayer graphene sheet disappears as soon as\n\u03c4i exceeds \u03c4\u03d5, whereas in structures with \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4i, the\nresult Eq. (6) predicts the WL behaviour, as observed\nin [21]. Such WL MR is saturated at a magnetic field\ndetermined by the intervalley scattering time, instead of\nthe transport time as in usual conductors, which provides\nthe possibility to measure \u03c4i directly.\nAlso, it is interesting to consider a small device of bi-\nlayer graphene with both sizes, length L and width L\u22a5,\nless than the electron coherence length\n\u221a\nD\u03c4\u03d5. Since the\nedge of graphene scatters electrons between K+ and K\u2212\nvalleys, in a wire (\u201dribbon\u201d) with L\u22a5 < L the sample\nwidth starts playing the role of the intervalley scatter-\ning length, even though intervalley scattering in the bulk\nof the material may be irrelevant, Li =\n\u221a\nD\u03c4i \u001d L. In\nthis case, in a wire with conductance G = Gclassical +\nGWL + \u03b4G both WL and universal conductance fluctua-\ntions (UCFs) [25], would be described by the usual results\nestablished for the orthogonal symmetry class in disor-\ndered systems [25], where UCFs and the WL parts are\nof the same order, GWL \u223c \u2212 23 e\n2\nh , \u3008\u03b4G2\u30091\/2 \u223c\n\u221a\n8\n15\ne2\nh .\nIn contrast, in a short and wide strip with L\u22a5 > L and\n4no intervalley scattering (either off defects in graphene\nor contacts), WL in most of the cross-section is sup-\npressed by warping, whereas the UCFs (which are im-\nmune to such symmetry breaking) are not. Therefore,\nin a strip GWL \u223c e2h , \u3008\u03b4G2\u30091\/2 \u223c 4\n\u221a\nL\u22a5\nL\ne2\nh , which not\nonly reflects a larger variance of UCFs in broad samples\n(L\u22a5 \u001d L), but also the fact that in a valley-degenerate\nsystem two valleys give coherent contributions towards\nthe observable conductance fluctuations.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that p \u2192 \u2212p asymme-\ntry of the electron dispersion in each valley of bilayer\ngraphene leads to unusual (for conventional disordered\nconductors) behavior of interference effects in electronic\ntransport. Without intervalley scattering, trigonal warp-\ning of the electron dispersion near the center of each val-\nley leads to a suppression of weak localization while in-\ntervalley scattering restores it. This behavior is expected\nin experimentally available bilayer graphene structures\n[11, 21], for which \u03c4w \u223c \u03c4 . In contrast, the univer-\nsal conductance fluctuations are not reduced by trigonal\nwarping and may be even stronger in a system without\nintervalley scattering than in systems with short \u03c4i: a\ncompletely opposite behavior to the WL effect. Such\nbehavior of bilayer graphene is similar to that of mono-\nlayer graphene [22, 26], despite the fact that electrons\nin these two materials have different chiralities and can\nbe attributed different Berry phases: pi in monolayers,\n2pi in bilayers [12, 14]. More generally a suppressed\nweak localization magnetoresistance and its sensitivity\nto intervalley scattering are specific to all graphitic films\nindependently of their morphology due to lower (trigo-\nnal) symmetry of the wavevector K in the corner of the\nhexagonal Brillouin zone of a honeycomb lattice crys-\ntal. Such a feature of the band structure does not af-\nfect the Josephson proximity effect in superconductor-\ngraphene devices. This is because the propagation of\na spin-singlet Cooper pair in graphene is related to the\nvalley-symmetric Cooperon Czz , whereas Fermi statistics\nforbid the appearance of the other long-living mode C0z\nin the superconducting order parameter.\nAuthors thank V.
