INTRODUCTION \nEVELOPED countries is moving toward high value \nadded and high technologies based manufacturing as it \nis a very important sector that contributed to employment \nand economic development. With the advance in \ntechnology and increasing competitiveness from some low \nlabour cost countries, manufacturing sector in developed \ncountries face its toughest challenge. Increasingly, these \nchallenges depend critically on reducing production cost, \nincrease equipment utilization and innovative products \ndevelopment so as to maximise its competitiveness. \nTherefore, there is an urgent need to develop and \nprovide solution that can improve manufacturing system \nand equipment utilization. With user friendly development \nenvironment in the embedded system, solution can be \nsmall, intelligent and could be generated by domain \nexperts. The embedded solution for manufacturing \nprognostics will enable companies to achieve near zero \ndowntime, higher productivity to keep developed countries \non the competitive edge in this ever-changing economy.  \nHence, the research aim is to understand the needs, trends, \ngaps of manufacturing prognostics and defines the research \npotential related to rapid embedded system framework for \nprognostics.  \n1-4244-9701-0\/06\/$20.00 \u00a92006 IEEE. \n \nII. INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS \nManufacturing environment needs to be highly \nresponsive to customer demand changes and it becomes \nvital for manufacturing plant to have a shorter marketing \nwindow with the competitive price and quality. Shop floor \nsystem and equipment needs to be fully utilized and \noptimized to zero downtime, zero setup.  \nTraditionally, the manufacturing plant performed the fail \nand fix maintenance procedures. Early detection of failures \nand prognostics in systems is very crucial for maintenance \noperations. With increasing trend towards automation in \ndifferent manufacturing industries, it has become necessary \nthat the downtime of any equipment system be reduced to \nminimum. Machine breakdowns are not only expensive in \nterms of production losses but also important in meeting \nproduction schedules. In addition, due to the fast growth of \nequipment size and complexity, there are an increasing \nnumber of system elements that need to be monitored at the \nsensors source. Intelligent devices are deployed so that \nproblems can be identified at source. \nOn the other hand, the manufacturing landscape in \ndeveloped countries has changed. In the past, a lot of \ncompanies are resellers and distributors who will buy and \nsell products imported for other countries. In recent year, a \nlot of companies started original equipment manufacturing \n(OEM) which manufactures key components on behalf of \nother companies. Some companies will move toward \noriginal design and manufacturing (ODM) which design \nand manufacture their own products. Some companies \nstarted to develop their own branding product or original \nbrand manufacturing (OBM).  \nWith shorter product life cycle, companies need to have \nrapid products introduction and innovation. A lot of the \nprognostics related products will need to be embedded so \nthat it will be smaller, more compact. Factories and \nequipment need to run twenty-four hours a day and seven \ndays a week (24X7). Remote maintenance, diagnostics and \nprognostics services to achieve zero downtime become \nmore important. With reduction in production space, \nprognostics solutions need to be smaller and compact with \nmore intelligent.  \n \n  K.M. Goh1,2,3, Member of IEEE, B. Tjahjono2, T. Baines2, and S.

BACKGROUND \nEarly detection of failures in systems is very crucial for \nmaintenance operations. With increasing trend towards \nautomation in different manufacturing industries, it has \nbecome necessary that the downtime of any equipment \nsystem be reduced to minimum. Machine breakdowns are \nnot only expensive in terms of production losses but also \nimportant in meeting production schedules. In addition, due \nto the fast growth of equipment size and complexity, there \nare an increasing number of system elements that need to \nbe monitored. Most of the equipment are complicated \nintegrated electro-mechanical and required some embedded \ndevices, sensors to provide prognostics features. \nA. Definitions of Manufacturing Prognostics \nManufacturing prognostics (or Prognostics for \nmanufacturing and engineering) has been interpreted by \nvarious researchers. Reference [12] defines prognostics as \nthe ability to \u201cpredict and prevent\u201d possible fault or system \ndegradation before failures occur. If we can effectively \npredict the condition of machines and systems, \nmaintenance actions can be taken ahead of time. As a \nresult, minimum downtime can be achieved. Prognosis has \nbeen defined by [13] as \u201cprediction of when a failure may \noccur\u201d i.e. a means to calculate remaining useful life of an \nasset. In order to make a good and reliable prognosis it \nmust have good and reliable diagnosis. Manufacturing \nprognostics is explained as tackling problem by predicting \nthe occurrence of an event through analyzing the trend of \nthe data, preceding this particular event. Manufacturing \nprognostics improve the overall operations of \nmanufacturing maintenance and provide for competitive \nadvantages. Various connotations of manufacturing \nprognostics given by other researchers are illustrated in \nTable 1 below. It is clear that manufacturing prognostics \nhas significant role to play and needs critical attention. \nB. Prognosis Representation  \nThe notation of prognosis has been addressed widely in \nthe literatures by various authors. Prognosis research is \ndone in areas such as, mechanical systems (e.g., rail \ntransport, automotive, and aircraft), power systems (e.g., \nfossil-fuelled power plants), and continuous-time \nproduction processes (e.g. chemical and petrochemical \nplants, and pulp and paper mills) where structural durability \nand operational reliability are critical, also prognosis work \nfound to be high in  Department of Defence (DOD), \nincluding Navy, Air Force, Army and DARPA, is \napproaching development of prognosis architectures and \ntechnologies in different ways [17]. Prognosis results are \nused for proactive decisions about preventive and\/or \nevasive actions (e.g. CBM, mission reconfiguration) with \nthe economic goal of maximizing the service life of \nreplaceable and serviceable components while minimizing \noperational risk [15], as main concept of prognosis is to \nmeasure the remaining useful life of a component. There \nare several factors that are critical to perform a prognosis \n[18], including \n\u2022 Current health state \n\u2022 Historical health state \n\u2022 Past maintenance history \n\u2022 Expected usage of the equipment \n \nPrognosis makes use of not only the historical data and \navailable knowledge, but also profiles of future usage and \nexternal factors. The early research on prognostics has dealt \nlargely with specific applications or case studies. This is \nexpectedly so, since prognostics as an engineering problem \narose from a need to promote condition based maintenance \n(CBM) practices for reducing costs incurred during \ninefficient schedule-based preventive maintenance. \nCurrently, there are many prognostics techniques and \nmethods. The prognostics methods can be classified as the \nfollowing two approaches [14]. \n\u2022 Data-driven: derived pattern recognition theory based \non statistical and learning from routinely monitored \nsystem operating data.  \n\u2022 Model-based: derived mathematical model based on \nstatistical and outcomes of consistency checks between \nthe sensed measurements of a real system and the \noutputs of a mathematical model.  \n \nPrognostics are receiving most attention for systems \nconsisting of mechanical and structural components, where \nthere is an opportunity to change current maintenance \nTABLE 1: DEFINITIONS OF MANUFACTURING PROGNOSTICS \nAuthor\u2019s Connotations \nBrotherton \n[3] \nAbility to access the current health of a part for a fixed \ntime horizon or predict the time to failure \nEngel [7] Capability to provide early detection of the precursor \nand\/or incipient fault condition (very \u201csmall\u201d fault) of \na  component, and to have the technology and means \nto manage and predict the progression of this fault \ncondition to component failure \nKatipamul, \n[11] \n \nAddress the use of automated methods to detect and \ndiagnose degradation of physical system performance, \nanticipate future failures, and project the remaining \nlife of physical systems in acceptable operating state \nbefore faults or unacceptable degradations of \nperformance occur. \nLee [12] Ability to \u201cpredict and prevent\u201d possible fault or \nsystem degradation before failures occur \nLewis [13] Prediction of when a failure may occur. To calculate \nremaining useful life of an asset  \nSmith [20] The capability to provide early detection and isolation \nof precursor and\/or incipient fault condition to a \ncomponent or sub-element failure condition, and to \nhave the technology and means to manage and predict \nthe progression of this fault condition to component  \nfailure \nSu [22] The identification of incipient faults, is usually \nconsidered and treated as a component\/part problem \nrather than a system problem \n \n \n \npractices from scheduled-preventive to condition-based \nmaintenance [15]. A large number of recent industrial \nresearch and development efforts in prognostics has been \nspurred by the military seeking to change its maintenance \npractices; to a lesser extent, the need for prognostics has \nalso been recognized by other industries. The ability to \npredict the onset of failure is key to the reduction in \nmaintenance costs, downtime, and health hazards in \nindustrial environments [1].  \nC. Prognostics Techniques  \nIntelligent techniques, such as expert system, neural \nnetwork, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm, have been \nemployed to assist the diagnostic task to correctly interpret \nthe fault data. Neural network technique has gained \npopularity over other techniques as it is efficient in \ndiscovering similarities among large bodies of data.  \n \n1) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): ANN is data \nprocessing systems consisting of a number of \ninterconnected processing elements called neurons. The \nneurons organized in layers which include an input layer, a \nset of intermediate layers, and an output layer. ANN has \nfound increasing favour in manufacturing systems research \nbecause of their ability to perform robustly in noisy \nenvironment [2]. ANN-based algorithms are suitable for \nmultiple sensors information as they can represent the non-\nlinear characteristics of machining process, learning, noisy \nsuppression and parallel computation abilities. They are a \ntype of massively parallel computer architectures based on \nbrain-like information encoding and processing models \nwith learning, association, categorization, generalization, \nfeature extraction and optimization. ANN is like a black \nbox model which accepts inputs, processes them and \nproduces outputs according to some non-linear transfer \nfunction [25]. ANN learn solutions from supplied data \nwithout specification of rules of a knowledge-based \nsystem. Most of the literature concerning fault diagnosis \nand neural networks has focused on fault detection based \nwith steady state data. Reference [23] applied neural \nnetworks for detection and diagnosis of faults in steady \nstate conditions. ANN is massively parallel, extremely fast \nand intrinsically fault tolerant and can be taught to perform \ncomplex tasks without programming. They are able to learn \nfrom experience, generalize from examples, and extract \nessential characteristics from noisy data [9]. It can be \nimplemented in hardware, software or hybrid of both. \n \n2) Fuzzy Logic (FL): FL is a problem-solving control \nsystem methodology that lends itself to implementation in \nsystems ranging from simple, small, embedded micro-\ncontrollers to large, networked, multi-channel PC or \nworkstation-based data acquisition and control systems. FL \nprovides a simple way to arrive at a definite conclusion \nbased upon vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy, or missing \ninput information. FL's approaches problems by mimics \nhow human make decisions, only much faster. Reference \n[10] explained that FL offers several unique features that \nmake it a particularly good choice for many prognostics \nrelated control problems.  \n \n Reference [24] presents work describing an automatic \ndiagnosis system for fault classification in rolling bearings \nbased on fuzzy logic analysis. Where fuzzy logic is \nconsidered to be a flexible tool which allows the modelling \nof uncertain and ambiguous data frequently found in real \nsituation, and it also makes possible manipulating different \nmethod of signal processing in an intergraded context. \nReference [5] presents an on-line fuzzy expert system, \ncalled alarm filtering and diagnostic system (AFDS), for \nthe purpose of dynamic alarm filtering, overall plant-wide \ndiagnosis, and alarm prognosis. The main objective of the \nsystem is to aid the operator by providing clean alarm \npictures and compact information about plant \nabnormalities. \n  \n3) Expert Systems: Expert systems or knowledge based \nsystems are suitable for solving problems usually solved by \nhuman specialists. Expert systems have been used since \nmid 1960s. It was believed that expert performance could \nby produced by combining the power of computers with \nthe laws of reasoning. The process of building expert \nsystems involves knowledge acquisition, knowledge \nrepresentation and the verification and validation of \nprototypes.  \n \nAn expert system based framework for an Incipient \nFailure Detection and Predictive Maintenance (FDPM) is \npresented [4]. The FDPM system is comprised of several \nexpert system related components and databases for use by \nthe mathematical and neural network models which predict \ndeterioration of distribution equipment.  \nRule-based expert systems are useful in encapsulating \nexplicit knowledge from experts. Usually, rules are \nexpressed in form; IF condition, THEN consequence. The \ncondition portion of the rule is usually some type of fact \nwhile the consequence portion can be outcomes that affect \nthe outside world, test another condition or rule, or even \nadd a new fact to the knowledge base. These rules can be \nspecific domain rules or heuristic rules (rules of thumb) and \ncan be chained together using logical operators [8]. \nApplications of expert systems can be summarized as \nfollows: \n\u2022 Diagnosing, interpreting, and monitoring problems \n\u2022 Choosing among analysis and modelling tools. \n\u2022 Selecting facilities configurations. \n\u2022 Planning for predictive maintenance and refurbishment \n\u2022 Capturing, duplicating, and transferring expertise. \n \n \n \n \nIV. RESEARCH EXECUTION \nThis section identified relevant literature, and then \nclassifying literature in different schemes. The \nclassification of manufacturing prognostics is explained by \ndistribution in journals, origin of research and research \nfocus respectively.  \nA. Distribution of papers in journals \nNumerous articles dealing with the theory and practice \nof manufacturing prognostics have been published in \nvarious journals. A total of 175 papers have been reviewed. \nThe top two journals that have more focus on \nmanufacturing prognostics are Journal of quality in \nmaintenance engineering (12%) and International society \nfor optical engineering (8%). Two conferences that have \nmore focus in the area are Aerospace conference (16%) and \nAutomatic testing conference (7.4%). \nB. Approach and methodology \nIn this part, all papers are classified by origin of \nresearch: approach and methodology. The approach is \ncategorized into content and process aspects as shown in \ntable 2. Content-related literature addresses issues of \nmanufacturing prognostics context. The content of \nmanufacturing prognostics refers to the choices and \nactions. Process- related literature addresses issues on how \nto form manufacturing prognostics; therefore process \naspects include models, framework and architectures. \nBasically, the focus of the literature is on either on content \nor on process of manufacturing prognostics.  \n \nTABLE 2: APPROACH OF RESEARCH \nFocus on # % \nContent \nProcess \nTotal \n133 \n42 \n175 \n76 \n24 \n100 \n \nThe research methodologies used are divided into five \ncategories which are conceptual, descriptive, empirical, \nexploratory cross-sectional and exploratory longitudinal. \nExplanation of the above categories is as follows [6]. \n\u2022 Conceptual: Basic and fundamental concepts of \nmanufacturing prognostics. \n\u2022 Descriptive: Explanation or description of \nmanufacturing prognostics content or process. \n\u2022 Empirical: Data for study has been taken from existing \ndatabase, review, case study, taxonomy or typological \napproach. \n\u2022 Exploratory cross-sectional: Objective of study is to \nbecome more familiar through survey, in which \ninformation is collected at one point in time. \n\u2022 Exploratory longitudinal: Survey methodology where \ndata collection is done at two or more points over time \nin the same organization. \nTable 3 shows the distribution of various methodologies \nused by researchers. Among the methodologies, empirical \nmethodology seems to be the most interested methodology.  \n \nTABLE 3: DISTRIBUTION OF VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES \nMethodology # % \nDescriptive \nEmpirical \nExploratory Cross-sectional \nConceptual \nExploratory longitudinal \nTotal \n78 \n70 \n18 \n07 \n02 \n175 \n45 \n40 \n10 \n04 \n01 \n100 \n \n3) Industrial adaptation: In table 4, all articles classified by \nindustrial adaptation based on the various manufacturing \nmethods followed by the industries such as Artificial \nNeural Networks, Expert systems, Algorithms, \nArchitectures, Embedded systems, Knowledge Base \nSystems.  \n \nTABLE 4: CLASSIFICATION BY INDUSTRIAL ADAPTATION \nNote: M1- Neural Networks, M2- Fuzzy Systems, M3-Expert systems, \nM4-Embedded systems, M5- Algorithm, M6- Knowledge base systems, \nM7- Software program, M8- Architecture. \n \nThe industrial applications include \n\u2022 Mechanical Systems: It includes maintenance activities \nin Automotive sectors, (e.g. truck maintenance), \nAvionics, (e.g.: aircraft applications), Rotating \nEquipments (e.g. Bearings) \n\u2022 Electrical Systems: Describes maintenance activities in \npower plants and electric systems in manufacturing \nindustries. \n\u2022 Industrial enterprises: Maintenance process in various \nindustries such as semiconductor, chemical, \ncontinuous-time production process. \n\u2022 Logistics: It includes details about maintenance \nactivities in shipboard Machinery, and about the navy \nlogistics maintenance. \n\u2022 Construction: It includes details about the maintenance \nactivities carried out in the construction industries. \n\u2022 Medical: Includes the application of prognostics in \nmedical field. \n \nC.

Table 5 shows the summary of the analysis. \nStrengths: From the classification of journals, the strength \nof previous research can be observed. Firstly, the previous \nwork focused on content related literature (76%) rather \nthan process related literature (24%). Hence, the previous \nresearch tends to have strengths on manufacturing \nprognostics context over planning, developing and \nimplementing the prognostics methods. Secondly, the most \npopular methodology in the manufacturing prognostics \nresearch is descriptive (45%) and empirical (40%) \nmethodology. Many researchers explored various \nintelligent methods to convert raw data from into useful \ninformation. Some researchers have applied their research \nto various industrial applications together with other \ndomain experts. Manufacturing maintenance approaches \nand implementation of prognostics technique attracted \nmulti-discipline expertise team in the arena. Hence, the \nresearch in manufacturing prognostics is considered to be \nstronger in the algorithms development rather than in \nframework and architecture in the aspect of prognostics \nmethod research.  \n \nWeaknesses: Much of the existing literature treats the \nkey industrial application independently and lacking of \nholistic approach to problems. A lot of researchers used PC \nbased research tools like simulation, Labview, Matlab and \nPC based prototyping solutions. The research algorithms \nassume unlimited resources and processing power which \nmight be unrealistic for space constraint environment like \nmanufacturing. Most of the research results are in the form \nof algorithms and will have a long learning curve and long \nimplementation time for real industrial solution. Most of \nprevious research focused on the content based rather than \nprocess based therefore practitioners find difficult to \nimplement the concepts. Moreover, there is lacking \nresearch in rapid development environment, real time \nprognostics and collaborative prognostics which handling \nof multiple failures. Much research needs to validate more \nin term of real practice. Some approaches could be difficult \nto implement for all the technologies such as condition \nbased maintenance and fuzzy approaches. \nAlthough a wide spread expectation of manufacturing \nprognostics research, rapid development and real time \nprognostics at sensor was not yet developed completely.  In \ncase of remote diagnostics, adaptive diagnostic analysis \ntoolset is not there to assist real time diagnostic process. \nFurther, the guidance to sustain the development of a \nstandard solution to the prognostics has not been pointed \nout clearly. \n \nOpportunities: The weakness of the research creates \nopportunities in future work. The opportunities are mainly \nin considering holistic framework for modelling, rapid \ndevelopment methodologies and real time prognostics at \nsensors source is important for manufacturing prognostics. \nConsidering prognostics in aspects of hardware systems, \nprocessing sensors data at source with adaptive embedded \ndevice or system on chip is important techniques can help \nto sent alert at sensors source.  There are needs for process-\nbased research in order to guide the manufacturers and \npractitioners to model, plan, develop and implement the \nconcepts or frameworks in real world manufacturing \nenvironment. \n \nThe integration of the predictive maintenance strategy \nwith the other business strategies opens new business \nopportunities to achieve the sustainable competitive space. \nPrognostics services could be remote services through the \ninternet and is a useful feature for many other systems. \nResearch areas such as remote condition based \nmaintenance (CBM), remote health and usage monitoring \n(HUM), and real time partitioning of algorithms for \nembedded prognostics device can be studied in detail. \n \nThreats: The holistic view in manufacturing prognostics \ntakes time and need several aspects to consider. Generally, \neach and every method in manufacturing prognostics has \nits own focus industrial domains. In order to achieve the \nreal overall pictures of prognostics, the conflicts interests in \neach method must be concerned carefully. The study in \nextracting generic principles and parameters that applied to \nmost prognostics is difficult. Multiple expertises are \nrequired in order to have successful outcome. \nAdditionally, the increased complexity of manufacturing \nprognostics demands with more sophisticated algorithms, \nhardware and software. In order to deploy manufacturing \nprognostics in variety of real industrial environment, \nresearchers need support from many sources like domain \nexperts, cross disciple researchers, manufacturers. Some of \nthe existing system may be a closed system or legacy \nsystem with limited information to add more sensors or \nenhance it with prognostics features. These will make it \ndifficult for the solution to test or implement. Some \nresearch on prognostics might still stay in algorithms \ndevelopment, PC based solution and simulation are often \nmade less overall impact and so their competitiveness can \nbe significantly eroded.  \n \nThe dynamic of the failure occurrence in the \nmanufacturing prognostics make difficult for researchers to \ncapture all scenarios in their research and so it is very \ndifficult for them to make a standard solution for multiple \nfailure occurrences. The competitive space in \nmanufacturing prognostics is also dynamic. It will continue \nto change as more cross discipline expertises join the \nresearch arena. The validity and usability of the techniques \n \n \n \nor tools must be proved carefully. \n \n \n \nTABLE 5: SWOT ANALYSIS \nStrengths \n\u2022 Various intelligent methods \nexplored \n\u2022 Wide range of industrial \napplications studied \n\u2022 Increased research and industrial \ninterest  \n\u2022 Multi-discipline expertise team \nWeaknesses \n\u2022 No holistic approach to \nproblems \n\u2022 Product specific development \nenvironment \n\u2022 Simulation, LabView, Matlab, \ncentralised PC-based solution \n\u2022 Lack of real time device level \nsolution \n\u2022 Long learning curve and \nimplementation time \nOpportunities \n\u2022 Holistic modelling and \nmethodologies \n\u2022 Rapid software embedded \nsystem development \nenvironment for shorter products \nlife cycle and fast changing \nrequirements \n\u2022 New maintenance service \nopportunities \nThreats \n\u2022 Support from manufacturers, \ndomain experts and end users \nrequired  \n\u2022 Research moving away from the \nindustries and users  \n\u2022 Closed system and legacy \nsystem \nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH \nFindings from the survey of 175 research papers related \nto manufacturing prognostics have suggested that there are \na lot of interests and potential industrial applications in this \narea of research. Many researchers focus on specific \nsolution for some domains using PC based simulation, \nLabview and Matlab. Manufacturing prognostics can be a \nnew maintenance service opportunities which can reduce \ncost of production, increase equipment utilization and \nprovide innovative prognostics enhancement products in \norder to compete with countries with low labour cost and \nproduction cost. Holistic approach, common methodology, \nreal-time prognostics devices, real time partitioning of \nalgorithms, and rapid implementation environment are \npotential future research. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Borinski J.W., Boyd C.D., Dietz J.A., Duke J.C., Horne M.R., Fiber \noptic sensors for predictive health monitoring, AUTOTESTCON \n(Proceedings), pp 250-262, 2001. \n[2] Brophy B., Kelly K., Byrne G., AI-based condition monitoring of the \ndrilling process, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, Vol. \n124, Number 3, pp. 305-310(6), 2002. \n[3] Brotherton T. et al, A testbed for data fusion for engine diagnostics \nand prognostics, Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE Aerospace \nConference, Big Sky MT, 2002. \n[4] Butler K.L., An expert system based framework for an incipient \nfailure detection and predictive maintenance system, Intelligent \nsystems applications to power systems, Proceedings, ISAP '96., \nInternational Conference, pp 321 \u2013 326, 1996. \n[5] Choi S.S., Kang K.S., Kim H.G., Chang S.H., Nuclear science, \ndevelopment of an on-line fuzzy expert system for integrated alarm \nprocessing in nuclear power plants, IEEE Transactions on Volume \n42,  Issue 4,  Part 1-2,  pp 1406\u20131418, 1995. \n[6] Dangayach, G.S. and Deshmukh, S.G.
