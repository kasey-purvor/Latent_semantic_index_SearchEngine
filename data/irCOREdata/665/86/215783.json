Introduction \nUrban government in Delhi today is marked by a conspicuous absence of accurate and up to date \nstatistics and maps. Yet, governmental programs there, even without these standard instruments of \n\u2018rational\u2019 planning, effectively \u2018conduct the conduct\u2019 of the population (see Foucault, 2007). How? In this \npaper, I will explore the relationship between governmentality and calculation through an analysis of the \npolitics of calculating, seeing and rendering knowable Delhi\u2019s slums through various governmental \nprograms over the past twenty years. Such programs, as I will show, provide a useful lens for rethinking \nmany of the epistemological assumptions and limitations that underlie current thinking about the practice \nof government. Specifically, I will show how governmentality can operate as effectively through aesthetic \nnorms as it does through those \u2018scientifically rational\u2019 and statistical processes of knowledge assembly \nwidely discussed in the literature. Attention to these aesthetic modes of governing is particularly relevant \nfor the study of postcolonial contexts, where even if rigorous statistical knowledge exists, it is often \nmissing, forged, or unused (see Hull, 2008; Roy, 2004).   \nGovernment, \u2018understood in the broad sense of techniques and procedures for directing human \nbehavior,\u2019 (Foucault, 1997: 82) functions by constructing and making intelligible categories of knowledge \nthat were previously unintelligible and authorizing those categories through expert \u2018truths.\u2019 By investing \nthese intelligible categories (e.g. the rate of economic growth, the occurrence of a disease) with \nsignificance and problematizing them such that they appear to require improvement via technical \nintervention, governmental programs recruit the diverse desires of individuals into a shared normative \nframework. Such programs are effective to the extent that they produce governable subjects\u2014individuals \nwho evaluate and act upon the social world through lenses provided by government. An essential \ncomponent of guiding the interests of target population groups is thus the joint exercise of crafting \nintelligible fields for governmental intervention and problematizing such fields so as to make certain \n\u2018deficiencies\u2019 emerge as improvable.i  \nThe starting point for this paper is to examine the calculative practices, or the techne, through \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 2 \nwhich governmental programs construct intelligible fields for intervention. This follows from one of \nFoucault\u2019s strongest methodological recommendations that power be studied through an ascending \nanalysis, which requires attention to \u2018the actual instruments that form and accumulate knowledge, the \nobservational methods, the recording techniques, the investigative research procedures, the verification \nmechanisms. That is, the delicate mechanisms of power cannot function unless knowledge, or rather \nknowledge apparatuses, are formed, organized, and put into circulation\u2019 (Foucault, 2001: 33-4). This \nfocus on the micro-practices of knowledge formation, or calculative practices, demands attention to the \ndiverse forms in which knowledge is consolidated and used to craft grids of intelligibility: how \ngovernmental programs use carefully selected metrics to assess and assign value and meaning to their \ntargets. This means the calculative practices at play in any moment not only establish the technical \nrequirements of government, but also form a calculative foundation of rule\u2014the epistemological basis on \nwhich information is gathered, knowledge assembled, and \u2018truths\u2019 verified so as to guide and manage a \npopulation\u2019s interests. Different calculative practices thus give rise to different calculative foundations, or \nepistemologies, of government; this is the relationship I explore herein. \n In the following pages, I look at the manner in which knowledge of slums in Delhi has been \ncollected, assembled and circulated in two different moments of urban improvement. Specifically, I show \nthat each of these two moments relied on an epistemologically different set of calculative practices to \nrender the slum intelligible and secure rule: the first statistical and the second aesthetic. I begin in Section \nII by defining the primary calculative practice used to render the slum intelligible in the post-\nIndependence period: the slum survey. In addition to its function as a technique of sovereign power used \nto know and control the territory, the slum survey since 1990 (the beginning of the first moment of \nurban improvement) took on the new governmental role of recruiting slum dwellers\u2019 desires into \nalignment with the vision of a \u2018modern,\u2019 orderly city. That is, the slum survey became what Foucault calls \na \u2018security apparatus\u2019: a governmental technology used to improve the population\u2019s welfare and minimize \n\u2018what is risky and inconvenient\u2019 (Foucault, 2007: 19), in this case by using numerical representations of \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 3 \nthe slum to guide slum dwellers through programs of self-improvement. The slum survey in this first \nmoment thus follows the \u2018rule of evidence\u2019 and has the \u2018scientificity\u2019 Foucault (2007: 350-1) described in \nhis lectures on governmentality, and resembles the statistical procedures for \u2018turning the objects of \ngovernment into numericized inscriptions\u2019 (Rose, 1991: 676) widely discussed in the governmentality \nliterature. \n In Section III, I examine how the calculative foundation of this first moment lost its functional \nefficiency, became ill-suited to secure the desired ends of government, and thus provoked a political \nresponse by opening a space for counter-conduct, an example of which I consider in Section IV. \nSpecifically, a community group used a counter-survey exercise to challenge the truthfulness of the slum \nsurvey and forced a reconfiguration of how slum space is calculated and rendered intelligible. \n In order to re-secure the conditions for rule and overcome such counter-conduct, a new calculative \nfoundation emerged around 2000\u2014the beginning of the second moment\u2014that introduced a new regime \nof knowing in Delhi. Here, the visuality of urban space\u2014which includes the territory as well as its \npopulation and built environment\u2014would become the key metric of that space\u2019s legal and moral \nstanding, which I describe in Section V. The slum survey continues to operate as the key governmental \ntechnology in this moment, only its mode of gathering and conveying information has radically shifted. \nNo longer implemented to accurately assess slum space, the survey becomes more of an aesthetic and \nnarrative technique to train slum dwellers to see different types of urban space as either desirable or \ndeplorable based on their outward appearance. This \u2018aesthetic governmentality\u2019 marks a shift in the \ncalculative basis of rule away from scientific survey practices and toward an aesthetic normativity, which \nI detail in Section VI.  \n My goal in describing how the calculative practices of government shifted between these two \nmoments is threefold: first, to demonstrate how the calculative foundation of government can change \nwithin an overall rationality of rule (e.g. urban improvement or slum removal); second, to argue that the \ncalculative practices of government provide a particularly supple site, prone to what Foucault (2007) calls \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 4 \ncounter-conduct and thus larger reconfigurations of rule; and third, to gesture to a type of aesthetic \ngovernmentality that has not been explicitly theorized in the governmentality literature. I return to the \nimplications of these claims, especially as they relate to postcolonial governmentality, in a concluding \ndiscussion in Section VII. \n \nII. Calculating slums\u2014the slum survey \n \n In 1950, the Government of India appointed a committee to address Delhi\u2019s pressing social and \ndemographic strains (Legg, 2006b), which had been exacerbated by the doubling of the city\u2019s population \ndue to the flood of families arriving from Pakistan after Partition in 1947 (Pandey, 2001: 122). One of the \ncommittee\u2019s main findings, which set the conditions in which the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), \nDelhi\u2019s main land management body, would take shape seven years later, was the need to increase the \nquantum of \u2018scientific knowledge\u2019 and calculative accuracy in building and regulating the city, especially \nits dilapidated, overly congested, and unhygienic slum spaces (Sharan, 2006: 4906). This goal of forming a \nscientifically rational and \u2018accurate\u2019 description of the territory and population defined the calculative \nfoundation of the government of slums for the first fifty years of independence. The primary calculative \npractice that backed this overall form of government was the slum survey.  \n In common parlance, slums are areas with sub-standard housing whose residents do not formally \nown or lease the land on which they reside.ii This land can be private or, more often, public. Because the \nDDA is by far the largest land-owning agency in Delhi, the majority of slums (700 out of 1080 as of \n2002)iii are located on land that it manages. Whereas the Public Premises Act, 1971 defines the \nprocedures for the removal of unauthorized occupants of public land, the actual basis on which slums \nare surveyed and assessed is located in the guidelines of the DDA and other land-owning agencies. \nWithin the DDA, the Land Department is assigned the task of preventing encroachments and securing \nexclusive control over land that the DDA has taken into its possession for urban development. The \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 5 \norigin of surveying slums thus lies in the territorial exercise of sovereign power.iv \n The procedures for monitoring public land and encroachments thereupon are primarily the \nresponsibility of the DDA\u2019s and State Revenue Department\u2019s field staff. The first step in this process is \nthe identification of encroachments. After a field staff, during regular field visits, finds that a particular \nportion of DDA land is unauthorizedly occupied, he is to (a) report such an occupation to the revenue \ncollection officer charged with overseeing the given plot in the Revenue Department and (b) \u2018keep a \nrecord of all such reports in the form of a register\u2019 (DDA, 1987: 1). This register includes the nature of \nthe encroachment, the existing use of the land, the Revenue Department cadastral number, the extent of \nthe encroachment on the mentioned plot(s), the name of the encroacher, the number of occupants of the \nland, and the approximate date of encroachment, among other details of the land. The revenue collectors \nthen maintain estate-wise registers by recording the same information into a chart tabulated according to \nthe cadastral map and also make further independent, local enquiries to determine the status of the \nreported encroachments (ibid.: 1). If the information passed to the revenue collector by the DDA field \nstaff is confirmed, he forwards the information in a written report to the Estate Officer located above \nhim in the Revenue Department. Before reaching the Estate Officer, who initiates proceedings against \nthe encroacher, at least two independent field visits by two different officers from two different \ngovernment departments are conducted to physically assess the nature of the encroachment.  \n By this point, however, the encroachment will only have been identified and registered. Before any \nparticular encroachment case is disposed of, the Estate Officer must send a monthly report to a more \nsenior officer to approve the reporting of the land use scenario in his area. During this process, if \u2018an \nEstate Officer is satisfied that a large number of squatters at a particular site remain unsurveyed, due to \none reason or another, he may propose a special survey\u2019 to this senior officer in which multiple \nencroachments are assessed together (ibid.: 3). This would be the third comprehensive survey of the land \nand encroaching population. Concurrently, the field staff is to issue a \u2018show cause notice\u2019, along with a \ncertified extract of the encroachment file and the Estate Officer\u2019s order, to the encroacher by returning \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 6 \nto the physical site and affixing the notice on the encroaching structure. During these steps, the \nGuidelines state that \u2018Every care should be taken to see that the calculations are correct and the notices \nhave been filled correctly and completely\u2019, which could require further field visits (ibid.: 4).  \n Through a minimum of three site visits, with the likelihood of more visits to confirm the details of \nthe land assessment across departments, the Estate Officer assembles a detailed (and \u2018accurate\u2019) \n\u2018assessment register\u2019 that consists of an up-to-date index of all encroachments and the status of the \nproceedings against them. All of this sets up the calculative requirements and expectations of the \nsovereign's knowledge of, and control and regulation over, public land and encroachments thereupon. \nThis system of land oversight\u2014which has the \u2018scientificity\u2019 Foucault (2007: 351) discusses in his \ntreatment of statistics and, following Porter (1995), might be described as \u2018mechanically objective\u2019v\u2014has \nbeen in place, roughly in this form, since the DDA was established in 1957.  \n However, for much of this period, compiling such an accurate account of land occupation was \ndifficult because slum residents viewed the slum survey as something to be avoided. As a technology of \nsovereign power, which functions by \u2018laying down a law and fixing a punishment for the person who \nbreaks it\u2019 (Foucault, 2007, 5), the slum survey operated by defining a legal norm and penalizing all those \nwho did not comply with it. Slum residents outside this norm, therefore, had no incentive to participate \nin the survey (and thus enter the ambit of the law) and did all they could to avoid, divert, or postpone its \nimplementation. According to surveyorsvi, some of their sabotage tactics included: removing public \nnotices (which the surveyors are legally required to display before initiating the survey process) and then \nrefusing to be surveyed on the basis of the absence of a written notice, disappearing on survey days, and \nbribing clerks and low-level field staff to void their names and locations from the survey register. Slum \ndwellers\u2019 ability to continue land occupancy was contingent upon exclusion from government records\u2014i.e. \nthey had an informal, \u2018paralegal\u2019 tenure status operating outside the privileged domain of \u2018civil society\u2019 \n(Chatterjee, 2004)\u2014which undercut the state\u2019s ability to collect accurate statistical summaries of the \nterritory.  \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 7 \n Therefore, despite the regulatory requirement to maintain comprehensive knowledge over all \npublic land and prevent permanent encroachments, more than 900 slum clusters were settled in Delhi by \n1990.vii The task of regulating such massive and complex informal settlements exclusively through \npenalties and laws proved too great for the administrative and political apparatuses of the time. Just as \nFoucault found in the shift from sovereign to governmental power that \u2018too many things were escaping \nthe old mechanism of the power of sovereignty,\u2019 causing an \u2018adjustment\u2019 toward the disciplinary and \nsecurity mechanisms (Foucault, 2001, 249), so too in Delhi did the juridical mechanism face limitations \nthat required the rise of new technologies of power. Thus, in 1990 the government transformed how it \nwould implement the slum survey. No longer simply for the maintenance of control of land (sovereign \npower), it would be put to a different use: to render a picture of slums that could be diagnosed and \nimproved upon. That is, knowledge of slums would no longer be used exclusively to form a centralized \ndatabase of state land, but also put into circulation in an attempt to positively conduct the conduct of the \nslum population by creating new incentives and presenting clear depictions of how this population could \nbe aligned (\u2018regularized\u2019 or \u2018normalized\u2019 in Foucault\u2019s words) with the rest of the property-owning \nsociety. It did so by directing calculations of the territory toward the constitution of a different type of \nslum subject: the slum dweller not just as an \u2018illegal,\u2019 but also a citizen eligible for relocation and (self-\n)improvement. \n This change in the character of the slum survey took place largely through the efforts of the \ngovernment of V.P. Singh, India\u2019s then new Prime Minister who in 1989 began implementing a range of \naggressive social justice programs (Jaffrelot, 2003: Ch. 10). Taking note of the burgeoning slum \npopulation in Delhi and the failure of previous slum programs to abate slum growth, Singh initiated the \ncity\u2019s first comprehensive slum survey to register and (partially) legalize all slum dwellers (Mustafa, 1995). \nMaking use of existing survey techniques and field staff, this four-month-long exercise enumerated every \nslum household in Delhi and issued what came to be known as V.P. Singh tokens. The purpose of the \nV.P. Singh token was to provide slum dwellers with formal proof of residence, but the incentive for slum \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 8 \ndwellers to partake in the survey and actively self-identify as \u2018encroachers\u2019 was tied to the introduction of \na new governmental object: resettlement.  \n The V.P. Singh token gave token-holding slum dwellers a permanent right to live in the city, \ndefining all registered slum families as Delhi residents and formalizing their right to resettlement in case \ntheir slum was removed. At the time of a slum demolition, therefore, any slum family that could prove it \nhad resided in Delhi since before 1990\u2014most easily by showing a V.P. Singh token\u2014was entitled to a \ngovernment-issued resettlement plot. To slum dwellers, however, resettlement meant much more than \nthe right to the city. Resettlement was also seen as a means to escape the stigmatized space of the slum \nand was thus viewed as a pathway to improvement. \n A complex mix of government rhetoric, popular history, and personal desire informed slum \ndwellers\u2019 conceptualization of resettlement through most of the 1990s. Early, targeted slum resettlement \nactions carried out during Indira Gandhi\u2019s rule as Prime Minister in the 1970s and early 1980s came to be \nviewed by slum dwellers as a best-case scenario. In these limited resettlement drives, slum dwellers were \nusually relocated within a five kilometre radius of their previous settlements and given well-serviced and \nrelatively large plots, free of cost, on a permanent leasehold basis. Such resettlement sites have since been \ndeveloped and integrated into the surrounding residential areas, bearing little to no visual distinction with \nthe neighbouring, middle class residential colonies.viii Due to financial and space constraints, the terms of \nresettlement were far less favourable by the early 1990s, and less than a third of displaced slum families \nwere receiving resettlement plots by the late 1990s.ix Yet, the DDA and Municipal Corporation of Delhi \n(MCD) still actively perpetuated (and continue to perpetuate) the perception of resettlement as a positive \nprocess through media campaigns and the slum survey, as we shall see.  \n Since the introduction of resettlement rights in 1990, the slum survey is initiated only after the \nDDA determines that a piece of encroached land is needed for a public purpose, at which time it issues a \nnotice to the residents of the specified land alerting them that a survey exercise will be carried out on a \nforthcoming date.x On that date, a survey team consisting of at least ten field staff descends upon the \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 9 \nsettlement and sets up camp in a clear, central area. Once the residents have assembled, the chief officer \ndisplays a map, tells residents what the intended use of the land shown on the map is, and states that this \nuse has been hindered by the presence of the slum. Be it a school, public park, or road, the map shows \nthe slum as \u2018out of place.\u2019 He thus begins by depicting the slum as an illegal encroachment, clearly \nviolating the official land use laid down according to planning procedures. In addition to highlighting the \ntechnical deficiency of the slum population\u2014its infraction of the land use plan and its residents\u2019 lack of \nproperty ownership\u2014the officers describe a possible means by which residents can escape the label \n\u2018illegal\u2019: by following the procedures of the survey, government will improve eligible slum dwellers by \nresettling them to serviced plots, thus removing their deficiencies and furnishing the conditions necessary \nfor \u2018normal\u2019 urban life. Only by following the enumerative steps of the survey, residents are told, will \nresettlement be provided.  \n The officer follows by describing the procedures by which resettlement eligibility will be assessed. \nResidents have to collect all forms of their residence proof (e.g. ration cards, identity cards, voter cards, \nV.P Singh tokens) and have them ready when the officers reach their houses. Next, they have to remain \npresent at their homes so that their family can be registered, display their pre-1990 residence proof, \ndemonstrate a legitimate (non-commercial) use of the land, and have their house inscribed with a survey \nnumber and recorded on a chart. Finally, they have to wait in line after the entire settlement has been \nenumerated and have their residence proof scrutinized by the chief officer, who adds the family to a list \nof those either \u2018eligible\u2019 or \u2018ineligible\u2019 for resettlement. In slums whose demolition is imminent, residents \nwho are added to the former list (and thus deemed \u2018improvable\u2019) have to sign a piece of paper agreeing \nto the terms of resettlement, which include paying a sum of money and abiding by certain land use and \nsite development norms. These calculated steps aim to \u2018render technical\u2019 (Li, 2007; Rose, 1999) the \ncomplex \u2018slum problem\u2019 by depicting slum \u2018improvement\u2019\/resettlement as a procedural, not political, \nexercise. Bracketing off the question of whether the slum should be removed or not, the survey \nconcentrates attention on resettlement eligibility, the success or failure of which is placed upon the \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 10 \ninternal dynamics, desires and practices of the slum population itself.  \n During the course of the survey process, the survey team compiles preliminary summaries of \nhouseholds according to three categories: eligibile, ineligibile, and ambiguous. Residents become aware of \nthese overall numbers as well as their own classification status. Households marked \u2018ineligible\u2019 or \n\u2018ambiguous\u2019 thereafter attempt to provide further proof or bargain otherwise to enter the \u2018eligible\u2019 \ncategory. Community leaders are often called into this negotiation process, out of which some \nreconfiguration of the final numbers emerges. Because resettlement is something many residents desire\u2014\neither over and above continued habitation in their slum or in recognition that they are better off being \nresettled than risking protest against the demolition\u2014slum residents see the act of being enumerated and \nregistered as a positive technology, something to be promoted and worth struggling to attain, unlike the \npre-1990 survey, which slum residents ardently avoided. The first effect of the post-1990 survey, then, is \nto draw slum residents into the practice of government by soliciting interest in the survey process: the \nintroduction of the right to resettlement achieves this. Second, it fosters the slum population\u2019s desire for \nresettlement\u2014that is, the desire to be deemed permanent and legal by the state and public\u2014by (a) \nidentifying a deficiency within the slum (its violation of law, its lack of recognition by the state and \ngeneral public), and (b) depicting resettlement as an attainable and desirable means to remove that \ndeficiency. In doing so, the survey also encourages slum residents to identify as eligible resettlees, \n\u2018encroachers,\u2019 or other terms provided by government. Third, by bifurcating the slum population into \n\u2018eligible\u2019 and \u2018ineligible\u2019 categories and providing a statistical distribution of the slum\u2019s makeup according \nto these categories, the survey divides the interests of the slum population. In the majority of instances, \nresidents \u2018eligible\u2019 for resettlement do not resist displacement, instead viewing it as an inevitable step in \nthe city\u2019s and their own personal development: why oppose the demolition when they are the lucky few \ngranted resettlement? This reduces the number of residents likely to directly oppose slum clearance.  \n The sovereign exercise of enumerating the territory and its population, described above, thus \nchanged roles as it became wrapped up with resettlement. Whereas before, slum surveys were supposed \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 11 \nto take place whenever there was a land encroachment (to enforce a juridical norm), in 1990 the DDA \nbegan to try to work through the interests of slum dwellers to achieve a delicate balance between forced \ndisplacement and voluntary resettlement. Illegality thus became something not to be prohibited, but \nmanaged. However, while the new uses of the slum survey in this first moment of urban improvement \nwere programmatically aimed at more effectively guiding the slum population toward voluntary \ndislocation, the survey\u2019s authority rested upon its ability to both (a) accurately assess slum residents\u2019 \nhistory and location, and (b) convince residents that its metrics for evaluating slum space were the most \nrelevant and \u2018truthful.\u2019 By 2000, both of these requirements proved beyond the technical means of \ngovernment.   \n \nIII. Statistics\u2019 loss of authority: unruliness in Delhi in the early 2000s \n \n The slum survey has governmental authority and effect, ostensibly, on the basis of an accurate \nknowledge of slum space. Like other instruments of scientific planning, it is expected to collate complex \nground realities into simplified trends and patterns from which deficiencies and programs of \nimprovement can be identified. However, securing this \u2018level of functional efficiency\u2019 (Legg, 2007) \nrequires adhering to specific norms of accuracy and process. As Legg says, summarizing Hannah\u2019s (2000) \ndiscussion of the functional requirements of statistics and mapping:  \n \nA sufficient infrastructure had to exist to enable the \u2018abstraction\u2019 by which the \ncomplex world became accessible. Second, this world had to be subject to an \nefficient process of \u2018assortment\u2019 such that it was known through rigorous and \nreliable categories. Third, the information had to be \u2018centralized\u2019 and analysed by an \nactive and efficient state (2007, 154). \n \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 12 \nHowever, practically, these technical requirements became increasingly difficult for the state to fulfil in \nthe 1980s and 1990s. Compare the above prerequisites for functional efficiency with the actual condition \nof information in the DDA: \n \nThe information system in the DDA is characterised by a \u2018data explosion\u2019 at the \nlower levels and \u2018information starvation\u2019 at the higher levels of management. There \nis little consolidation or analysis being carried out at any level of the DDA. Even \nsenior officers receive information in the form of raw data. In the absence of the \ndata being processed and presented as information, officials are unable to use it as a \ndecision-making tool, thereby defeating the very purpose for which the data was \ngathered.xi \n \nThis shows that there is a certain administrative burden of statistical simplification, which the DDA had \nbeen struggling to surmount. Thus, despite a series of \u2018objective\u2019 survey practices to monitor urban \nspace\u2014a type of calculation clearly \u2018scientific in its procedures,\u2019 which Foucault (2007: 350) considered \n\u2018absolutely indispensable for good government\u2019\u2014the DDA had great difficulty assembling information \ninto a coherent calculability. More than this secondary step of translating data into a usable form though, \nthe DDA\u2019s ability to collect accurate ground data in the first place was questionable. In 1986, the DDA \ncommissioned its first ever institutional review by an external body, the final report for which shows the \nabsence within the DDA of a coordinated set of calculative practices. The report, completed by Tata \nConsultancy Services, stated that \u2018Consultants observed that the present information system is \ncharacterised by i) missing information links between functional areas\u2026 and v) low reliability of \ninformation\u2019 and noted that DDA data is generally typified by a \u2018lack of accuracy\u2019. Related specifically to \nknowledge of land, the report found information inadequacies in areas including the \u2018inventory of the \nland with the DDA\u2019, the \u2018status of land development\u2019 thereupon, and the \u2018extent of land misuses.\u2019xii \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 13 \nNonetheless, rule over slums until around 2000 continued to be exercised on the presumption of \nscientific rigor and accurate statistics.  \n By 2000, the governmental approach to monitoring and surveying slums became part of the \nexplicit governmental goal of turning Delhi into a \u2018slum free city\u2019, giving it a \u2018world-class\u2019 look, \npromoting an efficient land market, and converting the \u2018under-utilized\u2019 public land occupied by slum \ndwellers into commercially exploitable private property (DDA, 1997). These were all part of the policies \nof economic liberalization initiated by the Finance Ministry in 1991 and concretely implemented in Delhi \nin the late 1990s (Ghertner, 2005; A.K. Jain, 2003). However, by this time, it had become clear to the \ncity\u2019s \u2018governors\u2019 that the pace and efficiency of slum clearance and resettlement in Delhi was insufficient \nto achieve these ends. The slum population had continued to grow after 1990, increasing from 260,000 \nfamilies in 1990 to 480,000 by 1995, with the number of slum clusters during the same period rising from \n929 to 1,080.xiii To address the \u2018menace of illegal encroachment\u2019 and slumsxiv, middle class neighbourhood \nassociations and civic groups began turning to the courts in search of faster, sterner relief. Civic and \nenvironmental problems like solid waste disposal, park maintenance, traffic congestion, land use \nviolations, and \u2018the problem of the slum\u2019 had been administered by complex assemblages of \ngovernmental and regulatory technologies that operated through the branches of the state, non-\ngovernmental organizations and civic groups, local politicians\u2019 patron-client relations, and market forces. \nIn the late 1990s, they were suddenly brought into the domain of the judiciary.xv  \n The courts, noting how unruly (i.e. slummy) the city was becoming, took cognizance of \u2018the \ndismal and gloomy picture of such jhuggi\/jhopries [slum huts] coming up regularly\u2019 across the city and \nsaid that \u2018on account of timely actions not having been taken, the Jhuggi clusters [slums] have been \nmultiplying each year.\u2019xvi The courts began addressing this situation through a flurry of decisions in the \nlate 1990s that rebuked the DDA for failing to both remove existing slums and prevent fresh slums from \ncoming up: the \u2018DDA has not been able to protect its land.\u2019xvii The court\u2019s initial response was to register \nits dissatisfaction with the ineffectiveness of the DDA calculative process and insist that the DDA follow \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 14 \nits mandate of preventing fresh encroachments: \u2018We reiterate that the land owning agencies\u2026 shall \nensure that no new Jhuggi comes up\u2026.\u2019xviii In a later judgment, the court took note of the unruliness \ncreated by the DDA\u2019s inability to secure control over its land by (rhetorically) questioning the foundation \nof sovereignty over slum spaces: \u2018It is thus contended that there is no purpose in acquiring the land when \nthe authorities are unable to protect the land already acquired which has been encroached.\u2019xix But, the \ncourt returned to affirm that sovereign authority and control of slum space could not be evaded: \u2018DDA \ncannot wish away its liability to clear the encroachments on public lands\u2026.\u2019xx \nThe first means the court adopted to re-secure sovereignty was to order the DDA to better \nfollow its own calculative procedures. It did so by reaffirming the DDA\u2019s statutory duty to implement \nthe Delhi Master Plan, requesting detailed information on occupied land in pending cases, and \nthreatening to levy penalties and hold responsible officers in contempt of court. However, as the menace \nof slums persisted and the DDA (along with other accountable authorities) only partially adhered to the \ncourt\u2019s orders, the court deemed the calculative efforts of the DDA a failure and began appointing its \nown special committees and court commissioners to do ground-level field assessments in place of the \nDDA.xxi The court\u2019s goal was to more efficiently implement the existing survey-based calculative \npracticesxxii\u2014that is, it did not fault the existing techne, just those responsible for implementing it.  \nBut, producing accurate calculations capable of guiding the population and administering the law \nrequired extensive field knowledge of not only the current ground reality, but also the history of such \nspaces. These court-appointed surveyors ended up producing equally (or more) flawed calculations of the \nground reality, as was pointed out by a civil writ petition contesting a court committee\u2019s recommendation \nto demolish a slum in north Delhi:  \n \n\u2026 it is apparent that the inspection and scrutiny performed by the Learned Court \nCommissioner appears, at best, perfunctory\u2026 [and contains] marked discrepancies \nabout the area and size of the basti [slum]\u2026 [The Committee\u2019s report] is also \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 15 \nincomplete, cursory and factually inaccurate. [The letter by the Court \nCommissioner] requests the Court to give directions for removal of encroachments \nwithout clarifying what are considered encroachments.... further the Monitoring \nCommittee also differs from the Learned Court Commissioner in its assessment of \nthe size of the basti... the authorities appear to be unclear even to the extent and \ndemarcation of the land area in question - the land of two Khasras [plots] (110, 111) \nare shown in the Revenue record as merely Government land, without designating a \nspecific land owning agency.xxiii  \n \nThe petition concludes by saying the question of \u2018urgent public use,\u2019 which is the justification for the \nslum demolition, cannot even arise because \u2018the dimensions of the land and its precise ownership are \nitself indeterminate\u2026.\u2019 \n We thus find that by 2000, through a combination of an increasingly complex and unruly ground \nsituation and the inability of existing calculative practices to render that ground sufficiently intelligible to \nthe courts and upper-level bureaucrats, the overall governmental goal of slum removal was opened to \ncounter-claims and tactics. This unruliness or intractability was not, however, solely the outcome of \ntechnical deficiencies of rule. Unruliness, that is to say, is not necessarily an effect of government\u2014i.e. a \nfailure internal to governmental practice; it can also be an effect on government\u2014a calculated \u2018struggle \nagainst the processes implemented for conducting others\u2019, what Foucault calls \u2018counter-conduct\u2019 (2007, \n201). Unruliness, then, is not simply that which escapes governmental knowledge; it can also be a \nproduct of contestation or counter-conduct, as I will show below. While governmental knowledge is \nnecessarily incomplete (Burchell, 1991), the manner in which that knowledge is organized and circulated \nis not independent of the practice of politics. Rather, the limitations of governmental knowledge can also \nmobilize people \u2018to contest the truths in the name of which they are governed, and to change the \nconditions under which they live\u2019 (Li, 2007: 17-9). \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 16 \n \nIV. Calculated counter-conduct \n \n One clear example of how political practices destabilized the prevailing calculative foundation of \nrule in Delhi arose in 2003 in the context of a slum survey. Since the early 1990s, the Dilli Shramik \nSangathan (DSS), or Delhi Labour Organization, a slum organization operating in West Delhi, had been \nactively following and contesting various attempts by neighbouring property owners, local politicians, \nand the DDA to demolish the slums in which its members resided. In August 2003, the DDA entered \ntwo DSS slums and began a slum survey, saying that the slums would be cleared in the near future. DSS, \nbeing made up of residents of these slums and having worked and lived there for years, had an intimate \nknowledge of the layout of the settlements and had even conducted its own survey of the settlements \npreviously. When the DDA surveyors began the survey process, DSS workers recognized that the \ncategories of eligibility for resettlement; the assumptions about the identity, legality and history of the \nresidents; and the calculative practices used by the government would not only require residents to accept \nresettlement as a best-case scenario, but would also lead to the displacement of most residents without \nresettlement (due to their ineligibility).  \n The DSS thus undertook two political actions. First, it directly intervened in the DDA survey \nprocess by following surveyors around and challenging the accuracy of their assessment of the ground \nreality. If a hut was locked and the DDA surveyor was on the verge of omitting it from the survey \nregister, DSS workers told them who the resident was, for how long s\/he had been living there, and \nconfirmed this information from the neighbours. If surveyors wanted a truly accurate assessment, the \nworkers told them, they would have to trust local knowledge or return later to re-assess the status of the \nhut. This increased the administrative burden of the survey. DSS workers also convinced the surveyors to \nrecord all residents, even those who did not have residence proof or whose proof was dated after the \nresettlement cut-off date (of 1990). Slum surveyors always rely on some amount of local knowledge, at \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 17 \nleast to get the lay of the land before initiating a survey. In this case, those local \u2018helpers\u2019 countered the \nlegitimacy of the survey and declared the survey process inaccurate and insufficient to determine the \neligibility of the residents. \n Second, the DSS undertook a counter-survey by enumerating all the huts within the two slums. In \naddition to doing the slum survey \u2018better,\u2019 DSS workers went further by listing the number of family \nmembers and the names of the head of household of each generation (if any) leading back to the family\u2019s \narrival in the settlement, recording the hut\u2019s precise location on a map of the slum, making copies of the \nrelevant residence proof regardless of that proof\u2019s date, affixing past voter logs to the survey to show that \nthe residents were deeply connected with the electoral process, attaching school records of children, \ncopying letters from government officials and elected representatives who had approved the extension of \nservices (the construction of a toilet block and dispensary) to the slums, and appending notarized, \ngovernment documents proving that the slums\u2019 earliest residents had been brought to Delhi and settled \nby government contractors as workers to build the surrounding residential colony. All of this information \nwas assembled in an attempt to prevent the erasure of the complex history that led to the slums\u2019 present.  \n Fifty DSS members then delivered this counter-survey to the Commissioner of Land Management \nin the main DDA office, located above the district office that conducted the slum survey. They also \nsubmitted written and verbal accusations that DDA surveyors had requested and accepted bribes from \nresidents in order to be added to the register and that the DDA survey did not even include all of the \nhouseholds.  \n The counter-survey, on the one hand, challenged the calculative practices of the DDA on its own \nterms by demonstrating the DDA\u2019s inaccurate assessment of the slums. If the Account\u2019s Branch of the \nLand Department of the DDA is supposed to \u2018maintain Ledgers of Accounts of the encroachers Estate-\nwise\u2019 (DDA, 1982: 115), the DSS showed how this task had not been accurately completed. On the other \nhand, the counter-survey challenged the overall calculative foundation of government by questioning the \nmetrics used to assess the identity of slum dwellers, the type of improvement (i.e. resettlement) they \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 18 \ncould be eligible to receive, and the basis on which that eligibility would be determined (the 1990 cut-off \ndate). The DSS counter-survey showed that the people living on these plots are not \u2018illegal encroachers\u2019 \nor \u2018criminals,\u2019 but \u2018workers\u2019 and \u2018city-builders.\u2019 \n Going one step further, the DSS aligned with a network of slum organizations called Sajha Manch \n(Joint Platform) and received technical assistance from professional non-governmental organization \nworkers to show that the DDA had failed on its own terms to account for and accommodate the \npopulation growth anticipated and planned for in the Delhi Master Plan. They claimed (to the DDA and \nmedia) that this was a political, not a technical or implementation, failure by comparing (i) the Master \nPlan\u2019s guideline for low-income housing provision for the year 2001 with (ii) the actual housing stock \nbuilt by the DDA.xxiv The DDA had failed to provide even 15% of the required stock (cf. Verma, 2002), \na fact the DSS used to question who should be termed \u2018illegal,\u2019 slum dwellers or the government. By re-\nasserting the legal entitlements guaranteed to the poor through plans laid down in the pre-liberalization \npast and demonstrating the calculative errors of the DDA survey, the DSS (armed with its own \u2018accurate\u2019 \nsurveys and numerical representations) countered the DDA\u2019s claim to exclusive, expert knowledge of \nslums. \n Raising the threat of DDA corruption in the media and armed with its own claim to accuracy, the \nDSS threw its own \u2018web of visibilities, of public codes and private embarrassments over\u2019 (Rose, 1999: 73) \nthe calculations of government. The result of the DSS\u2019s calculative counter-conduct was that the slum \nsurvey was suspended and the demolition order was withdrawn.  \n Recent studies have emphasized the general methodological importance of the politics of \ncalculation within the exercise of governmental power (see Elden, 2007; Legg, 2006a). Numerous \ngovernmentality studies have also suggested that the knowledge formed through governmental \ntechnologies can be \u2018repossessed\u2019 by \u2018the governed\u2019 to contest the terms of rule (Kalpagam, 2000; Rose, \n1999: 92), or, as Gordon (1991: 5) says, \u2018the terms of governmental practice can be turned around into \nfocuses of resistance.\u2019 Yet, these studies examine this politics almost exclusively through internal debates \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 19 \namong the \u2018governors\u2019 or within an encompassing rationality of rule\u2014that is, as a process internal to rule \nin which \u2018the constitutive role of contestation drops out of sight\u2019 (Hart, 2004: 93; see also Joyce, 2003: \n102-3; O'Malley, Weir, & Shearing, 1997). Governmental knowledge, in this view, can activate politics \nand be used for different strategic ends, but this happens only after this knowledge has already been \nestablished as \u2018truth.\u2019 These studies therefore do not consider how (counter-) tactics among the governed \ncan change the strategies of government, or how calculative practices can themselves become sites of \nstruggle. The DSS counter-survey, like other examples from the counter-mapping literature (see \nAppadurai, 2002; Peluso, 1995; Turnbull, 1998), provides insight into how these tactics can shape (at \nleast temporarily) larger strategies of rule and shows that the calculative practices of government are not \npolitically inert, but rather can be contested so as to reconfigure the character of governmentality.  \n \nV. The rise of an aesthetic normativity  \n \n The unruliness of slum space by the early 2000s arose, as shown above, because of technical \ndifficulties in producing a governing intelligibility through existing calculative practices on the one hand, \nand the politicization of those calculative practices on the other. By this time, the courts had already \nintervened to try to reassert the existing accuracy-based calculative framework of government, but with \nlittle success. With mounting pressure from commercial investors and the \u2018normal,\u2019 middle-class public to \nmake Delhi look \u2018world-class,\u2019 the DDA and MCD turned to the courts to identify new strategies to \nensure these ends. For example, the MCD submitted in the High Court that the problem of \nunauthorized constructions and slums is \u2018mammoth in nature - and cannot be controlled by simply \ndealing under the existing laws or under the provisions of [Delhi's] master plan\u2019 (Biswas, 2006). Here we \nsee that government, in a moment of crisis, called upon the sovereign mechanism of law to impose order \nby any means necessary (cf. Schmitt, 2006)\u2014in this case, by recalibrating legality and establishing a new \ncalculative foundation of rule.xxv \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 20 \n The courts, through a series of decisions in the early 2000s, declared the existing procedures of \ngoverning slums too slow and inefficient to make Delhi world-class and slum-free. In a 2002 decision, \nthe court stated \u2018it would require 272 years to resettle the slum dwellers\u2019 according to existing procedures \nand that the \u2018acquisition cost\u2026 of land\u2026 and development\u2026 would be Rs. 4,20,00,00,000\/- [~USD 100 \nmillion].\u2019xxvi This set of conditions was clearly intolerable, so the court began relying less heavily on the \npreviously dominant (and statutory)\u2014but slow, inefficient, expensive, and contestable\u2014calculative \nprocedure of surveying slums. Instead, it started using a surrogate indicator to identify illegality: the \u2018look\u2019 \nor visual appearance of space.xxvii In lieu of accurately assessing (i.e. creating paper re-presentations that \ncorrespond to) physical space, a set of visual determinants began to be used to render slums intelligible \nand locate them within a new \u2018grid of norms\u2019: a world-class aesthetic defined by the DDA and Delhi \nGovernment\u2019s prioritization of making Delhi a \u2018world-class\u2019 city.  \n As part of Delhi\u2019s world-class city-building efforts, public finances in the early 2000s were gradually \nshifted away from education, public housing, healthcare, and food subsidies toward large, highly visible \nand \u2018modern\u2019 infrastructure projects like the Delhi Metro Rail, more than 50 new flyovers, two new toll \nroads to Delhi\u2019s posh, satellite cities, and the Commonwealth Games Village\u2014prestige projects built \u2018to \ndispel most visitors\u2019 first impression that India is a country soaked in poverty\u2019 (Ramesh, 2008). Similarly, \nthe Delhi Government approved more than USD 100 million (which it later retracted after cost estimates \nalmost doubled) for building a \u2018signature bridge\u2019 modelled after London\u2019s Tower Bridgexxviii and the \nmunicipal government liberalized building bye-laws and development norms to allow for denser and \ntaller (i.e. more \u2018modern\u2019) commercial development across the city. Along the same lines, various \u2018world-\nclass\u2019 monuments (e.g. the world\u2019s largest Hindu complex, the Akshardham Temple) and commercial \ndevelopments (e.g. India\u2019s biggest shopping mall complex) in direct violation of the city\u2019s land use plan \nwere deemed \u2018planned\u2019 and legal in order to facilitate Delhi\u2019s ascent as a site of India\u2019s biggest and best \narchitectural feats.  \n With the Chief Minister of Delhi declaring the preparations for the 2010 Commonwealth Games \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 21 \nthe government\u2019s top priority and a frenetic buzz in the media since the early 2000s to ensure that \nDelhi\u2019s appearance is appropriately \u2018global\u2019 before the Games, a shared aesthetic sense of how the city \nshould look quickly took shape. This has been enhanced by the general celebration of middle-class \nconsumptive lifestyles and spaces in the media as well as public campaigns by trade associations, the \nmedia and government (often in partnership) aimed at creating the perception that Delhi will look like \nLondon or Singapore in the near future (Dupont, 2006). This \u2018world-class\u2019 aesthetic became more than \nmedia hype or city boosterism, however, when the courts began tying \u2018law and order\u2019 to it; it soon \nbecame both \u2018the end and instrument of government\u2019 (Foucault, 2007: 105).  \n In the early 2000s, the courts began making widespread mention of Delhi as a \u2018showpiece\u2019, \u2018world-\nclass\u2019, \u2018heritage\u2019, and \u2018capital\u2019 city. In a landmark judgment from 2000, the Supreme Court stated,  \n \nIn Delhi, which is the capital of the country and which should be its showpiece, \nno effective initiative of any kind has been taken by the numerous governmental \nagencies operating there in cleaning up the city\u2026. Instead of \u2018slum clearance\u2019 \nthere is \u2018slum creation\u2019 in Delhi. This in turn gives rise to domestic waste being \nstrewn on open land in and around the slums. This can best be controlled at least, \nin the first instance, by preventing the growth of slums.xxix  \n \nIn 2001, the Delhi High Court made the barriers to Delhi\u2019s world-class ambitions equally clear: \u2018Delhi \nbeing the capital city of the country, is a show window to the world of our culture, heritage, traditions \nand way of life. A city like Delhi must act as a catalyst for building modern India. It cannot be allowed to \ndegenerate and decay. Defecation and urination cannot be allowed to take place in open at places which \nare not meant for these purposes.\u2019xxx Here, the obstacle to Delhi becoming a \u2018catalyst\u2019 of modernity is the \nnuisance-causing activities (e.g. open defecation) of slum dwellers (for whom the state has failed to \nprovide adequate infrastructure for enclosed latrines).  \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 22 \n Court documents from this period show that the growing concern for the city\u2019s \u2018world-class\u2019 \nappearance increasingly came to be expressed through an environmental discourse of cleanliness and \npollution (cf. Baviskar, 2003). Popularized through the phrase and public campaign called \u2018Clean Delhi, \nGreen Delhi,\u2019 this discourse tied deficiencies in environmental well-being and appearance to the presence \nof slums, largely through the legal category of \u2018nuisance.\u2019 Before 2000, nuisance-causing activities like \nopen defecation or unhygienic living conditions did not provide sufficient justification for demolishing a \nslum. Through the 1980s and 1990s, unsanitary conditions in slums and general slum-related public \nnuisances were legally considered the responsibility and fault of the municipal authorities: slums were \ndirty because the state did not provide them with basic services. However, as I have argued elsewhere \n(Ghertner, 2008), the early 2000s introduced a new legal discourse of nuisance that reconfigured the \nparameters and mechanisms by which slum-related nuisances were to be remedied.  \n The juridical category of \u2018nuisance\u2019 is broadly considered any \u2018offense to the sense of sight, smell, \nor hearing\u2019 (Ashok K. Jain, 2005) and is as such directly linked with aesthetic norms. The definition of \npublic nuisance, according to statute and precedent, had until this time included only particular objects \npossessed or actions performed by individuals or groups that interfered with a public right. Aesthetically \ndispleasing, annoying, or dangerous actions or objects could only be addressed by improving municipal \nservices or fining individuals for their violation.xxxi  \n The inability of the DDA and MCD to improve, clean up, or remove slums, as well as the court\u2019s \nfailure to efficiently provide order to the city by removing slums through existing Acts, led to a gradual \nreinterpretation of nuisance that made the appearance of filth or unruliness in and of itself a legitimate \nbasis for demolishing a slum. This change took place by redefining the categories of nuisance such that \nnot only objects or actions, but also individuals and groups themselves could be declared nuisances. This vastly \nexpanded the range of procedures that could be administered to remove nuisance: no longer by stopping \nnuisances through imposing fines and penalties, but by displacing entire populations.  \n Once the interpretation of nuisance was expanded to include categories of people or particular \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 23 \npopulation groups, the legal (and calculative) basis for slum demolition was simplified. Demolition orders \nno longer require complex mapping and survey exercises to determine the nature of land use or demand \neven the confirmation of land ownership in slum cases. Today, courts ask for little more than the \ndemonstration by a petitioner (who is usually a neighbouring property owner) that the slum in question is \n(i) on public land (which is the definition of \u2018slum\u2019 and has never been a sufficient condition for \ndemolition orders in the past), and (ii) a nuisance to the public. Evidentially, this is most commonly and \neffectively done by furnishing photographs that show the slum\u2019s \u2018dirty\u2019 look and poor environmental \nconditions: open defecation, overcrowded living conditions, children playing in and \u2018taking over\u2019 the \nstreet, stagnant water, municipal waste, etc. Since approximately 2002, the courts have considered such \nphotographs sufficient evidence to confirm that the slum in question does not conform to the aesthetic \nand civic codes deemed \u2018normal\u2019 in Delhi and have, in the majority of such cases, issued demolition \norders. Today in Delhi, the look of the slum alone confirms its illegality, and the calculative practices of \nproducing expert knowledge of a population group now consists of a judge\u2019s aesthetic judgment of that \ngroup\u2019s contribution to the overall security and vitality of the city (Ghertner, 2008). \n Over the past ten years, close to a million slum dwellers have been displaced in Delhixxxii, the vast \nmajority thanks to court orders equating slum clearance with environmental and visual clean up. This \nnew aesthetic ordering of the city, in which the legality and essential features of space can be determined \nentirely from a distance and without requiring accurate survey or assessment (i.e. space can be calculated \nwithout numbers), marks a clear shift from the previous scientific\/statistical calculative foundation of \nrule. In this new, more aesthetic calculative framework, the law, in conjunction with a variety of other \naesthetic and security techniques (including the slum survey, discussed again below), crafts fields of \nintelligibility by disseminating standardized aesthetic norms. Spaces are known to be illegal or legal, \ndeficient or normal based on their outer characteristics. A shopping mall, even if in violation of planning \nlaw, is legal because it looks legal.xxxiii A slum, even if its residents have been formalized at their current \nlocation, is illegal because it looks like a nuisance. As a \u2018social vision\u2019 then, law \u2018defines our idea of \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 24 \ndiscursive relevancy, positing distinct epistemological criteria for verification\u2019 (Singer, cited in Blomley, \n1994, 12-13), in this case, aesthetic norms. As of approximately 2000 then, the manner in which slum \nspace is rendered intelligible\u2014that is, the system of verification used to deem the representation, or \npicture, of the slum truthful\u2014shifted away from the statistical procedures described above to an \naesthetic evaluation. \nThis new regime has made ensuring security in the city administratively and technically less \ncomplex than before because it provides a clear visual grid for assessing the quality of space without \nrequiring the rigorous inscriptive\/statistical simplifications previously necessary to render such ground \nconditions easily intelligible. In the context of urban government, Foucault describes the security \nimperative\u2019s primary focus as \u2018a matter of organizing circulation, eliminating its dangerous elements, \nmaking a division between good and bad circulation, and maximizing the good circulation by diminishing \nthe bad\u2019 (2007: 18). The law\u2019s ability to clear unruly and displeasing spaces through this less technically \nrigorous calculative regime has accelerated the circulation of what Delhi\u2019s governors consider \naesthetically and economically \u2018good.\u2019 Thus, unlike the first moment of urban improvement described \nabove, in which the law set the conditions for the slum survey to guide slum dwellers toward improved \nends, today the law itself has become the main instrument of improvement. Law in this configuration \nthus takes on an affective power, inhering a security dimension through its ability to perpetuate and \ncodify the \u2018world-class\u2019 aesthetic.xxxiv However, the law\u2014a juridical mechanism\u2014is ill-equipped to \ndirectly access the \u2018mechanics of interest\u2019 (e.g. the desire for resettlement among slum dwellers) \n(Foucault, 2007: 352), the \u2018fundamental target and instrument of the government of populations\u2019 (Ibid., \n106). Government must deploy other techniques to ensure that the population\u2019s interest is cultivated in \nthe direction of the \u2018suitable ends\u2019 of the world-class city. This remains the task of the slum survey, the \nrole of which has qualitatively changed in this second moment.  \n \nVI. Slum survey as aesthetic technology of government (2000-present) \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 25 \n \n No longer needed to assess the legality of slums, the slum survey\u2019s previous juridico-legal function \nof knowing and securing the territory has been taken over by the visual technology of nuisance law. I \nattended three slum surveys in 2005-6, during which I observed the surveyors\u2019 limited focus on \nconducting a rigorous physical assessment of the land and much stronger emphasis on instructing the \nslum population on its proper \u2018place\u2019 in the city. The process of \u2018rendering technical\u2019 the \u2018slum problem\u2019 \nresembles that of the pre-2000 survey (described in section III) in that it begins by contrasting \u2018illegal \nencroachers\u2019 with the \u2018normal\u2019 public that lives in formal residential colonies. Surveyors today, however, \nestablish the illegality of the slum not in reference to a map or comprehensive register of all residents, but \nrather on the basis of the settlement\u2019s appearance. The chief officer during all three surveys, after \nassembling the residents, began by describing the nature of urban development in Delhi. On one \noccasion, the officer said: \n \nToday Delhi does not look how it used to. In ten years, it won\u2019t look like it does \ntoday. Delhi is developing. It is cleaning up. Only the best people will live in \nDelhi. Soon, there will be no slums here. All the deserving people will stay, but \neveryone else will have to go. The international [Commonwealth] Games are \ncoming to Delhi and people from all over the world\u2014America, England, \nJapan\u2014will come here and see our city. We all want Delhi and India\u2019s name to \ngrow. Look around; you see the Delhi Metro has come, all these malls have \ncome. It is time for Delhi to rise. That is what we all want. Everyone must fit. \n \nThe survey thus starts by invoking world-class aesthetics as the desired end of government. Over the \ncourse of the survey, individual surveyors then locate the slum and households being assessed in relation \nto this norm. For example, one surveyor told an angry resident, \u2018In the whole world, no settlement that \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 26 \nlooks like this is legal,\u2019 and suggested that the resident\u2019s demand to remain settled at his current location \nis at odds with the interests of the rest of the city. \u2018Can\u2019t you see that nobody wants this type of slum?\u201d \nhe concluded. The slum\u2019s physical conditions thus get tied to a notion of illegality and are, in part, the \ndeficiencies of the population that must be corrected. These deficiencies, surveyors either directly stated \nor indirectly intimated, include overcrowding, congestion, unhygienic living conditions, lack of property \nownership, and other environmental and public health risks that slum dwellers\u2019 \u2018illegal\u2019 residency imposes \non the land.  \n During the course of the survey, surveyors spend as much time narrating the physical traits of the \nslum as they do producing the survey log. The survey thus becomes a type of narrative technique \nthrough which the surveyors constantly move back and forth between describing the particular slum \nbeing surveyed and the problems with \u2018slums in general.\u2019 For example, one surveyor said to a group of \nwomen, \u2018This area has become a complete [traffic] jam. Delhi can\u2019t function like this. Sarkar \n[government] will improve these areas, and you. Everyone will benefit. Look at Kali Basti [a nearby slum \nthat had been resettled years earlier]. They have become such good people and the area is clean now.\u2019 \nThe survey thus operates by instilling a set of observational practices into the slum population. By \nconstantly pointing to the aesthetic impropriety of the slum (\u2018this area has become a complete jam\u2019) and \nreferencing slum deficiencies to the aesthetic norm established by law, the survey process trains slum \ndwellers to see slum space through lenses provided by government. \n In its current form, the slum survey is not just about making individual slums visible, bounded \nand calculable. It is also about taking easily identifiable, visual attributes of slums and linking those \nattributes to a particular normative category of space\u2014illegal encroachment. A clear effect of the slum \nsurvey is that it makes use of what slum dwellers already know about the slum\u2014that it is dirty, \ncongested, kachcha (constructed in a \u2018temporary\u2019 fashion), unserviced, on public land, different from \nprivate residential colonies\u2014to produce a vision of slum space as illegal and lacking the characteristics \nnecessary for \u2018normal\u2019 citizenship. This makes slums knowable through their outer, visible characteristics. \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 27 \nSpaces that look like slums, that look dirty and overcrowded, are learned to be illegal, despite their far \nmore complex political, residential and legal histories. Thus, participants in the slum survey learn a way of \nseeing and identifying the essential traits of urban space and are, in the process, trained to conceptually \nlink locations in the city that share these same traits. That is, \u2018slum space\u2019 across the city, as a category, is \nrendered imaginable and intelligible through the survey. By offering resettlement in conjunction with \nproducing this vision of slum space, the survey shows slum dwellers that the government is attempting to \nimprove this category of space; that individual slum dwellers are part of a larger deficient population \nwhose improvement is necessary for the city\u2019s improvement; and that it is in their interest to cooperate \nwith this process. This \u2018will to improve\u2019 (Li, 2007) is induced, as Rose says, \u2018by throwing a web of \nvisibilities, of public codes and private embarrassments over personal conduct: we might term this \ngovernment through the calculated administration of shame\u2019 (Rose, 1999: 73). In Delhi, the only difference is that \nthis personal conduct is not an individual act or particular type of \u2018deficient\u2019 behaviour; it is a status of \nbeing. Being a slum dweller in and of itself is criminalized and denigrated through this governmentality. \nAs one man responded when I asked him during the course of the survey why his home will be \ndemolished: \u2018Because we are dirty and make the city look bad\u2026. Nobody wants to step out of his home \nand see us washing in the open or see our kids shitting.\u2019  \nParticipating in the slum survey requires slum dwellers\u2019 active self-identification as \u2018illegal.\u2019 \nWaiting in line, being compliant with government officers and pleading with them to register your name, \ndisplaying your residence proof and being observed and inspected, accepting that the procedure and \ntiming of your home\u2019s demolition is something you neither control nor have a right to influence, and \naccepting your displacement as a gift from the government are all subjectifying practices that guide slum \nresidents\u2019 desires in clear, predictable ways. As Dean says of the way in which the population\u2019s \u2018identity\u2019 \nbecomes a key target of governmental practice: \u2018Regimes of government do not determine forms of \nsubjectivity. They elicit, promote, facilitate, foster and attribute various capacities [in the case of the slum \nsurvey, the capacity to be resettled], qualities [supplicatory, dirty] and statuses [illegal] to particular agents \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 28 \n[slum dwellers]. They are successful to the extent that these agents come to experience themselves \nthrough such capacities\u2026, qualities\u2026  and statuses\u2026\u2019 (1999: 32). Therefore, as slum dwellers participate \nin the survey, identify resettlement as a best-case-scenario\u2014that is, as they accept voluntary displacement \nas a desirable outcome\u2014and adopt world-class aesthetics as their rationalization of change, they occupy a \nsubject-position\u2014i.e., they \u2018subject\u2019 themselves (Foucault, 1983) to the meaning of world-class aesthetic \ndiscourse\u2014that sees slums as out of place, as dirty, as illegal. Forced resettlement, through the slum \nsurvey, hence comes to be seen not as the violent limit of sovereign power, but as the necessary action of \nan improving government. Li (2007: 12) says a key difference between sovereignty and governmentality is \nthat in the former violence can be used with impunity, whereas in the latter violence must be justified by \na notion of improvement. In Delhi now, most slum dwellers see displacement as improvement (at least \nof the city, if not of the self), even in cases when they are unsure of their eligibility for resettlement. As a \nresult, heavy resistance to slum surveys and demolition drives are rare in Delhi today, as most slum \nresidents are resigned to the fact that Delhi will be \u2018slum-free\u2019 in the near future.xxxv  \nAnd, if slum residents do not initially accept the improving mission conveyed through the slum \nsurvey and deny that they are encroachers (and thus challenge the grounds of the survey) on the basis of, \nfor example, the fact that government officials or politicians wilfully settled them at their present \nlocations, the surveyors can resort to the authority of the law, forcing resident to choose to self-identify \nas illegal and committed to the resettlement process or be demolished without compensation. The law, \nwhether invoked explicitly or implicitly, hence structures the discursive field so that only certain actions \nappear possible: slum demolition, forced resettlement, and, more generally, the end of \u2018slum life.\u2019 \nSovereign power is used in this manner to set the conditions for improvement, while the slum survey \ndeclares \u2018slum life\u2019 itself a threat to the vitality and efficiency of the city. Again, government here does \nnot have to operate by convincing everyone that resettlement is a desirable end, just enough people to \nquell resistance and render the population manageable. \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 29 \nInterviews with slum organizers and residents confirm that the vast majority of slums in Delhi \nhave undergone a slum survey along these lines at least once after the original 1990 survey, even when \nthe survey is not followed by a demolition.xxxvi This suggests that the slum survey has become a \nconsistent governmental technology of shaping and guiding the slum population\u2019s interest. And, that the \nsurvey is no longer premised on a statistical calculative foundation, but has rather become more of an \naesthetic technique of disseminating observational dispositions, is confirmed by the fact that a \ncomprehensive statistical summary of the size and distribution of Delhi\u2019s slum population has not been \nreported since 1998. The government itself is unaware of the total number of slums in Delhi and thus \ncontinues to report 1998 numbers as if they were valid today (Dupont, 2008: 83). In fact, most official \nland use numbers are outdated, blatantly inaccurate, or never recorded in Delhi. For example, in a 2005 \ninterview with the Commissioner of Planning in the DDA, in which I asked how the statutorily \nmandated baseline land use survey for the newly drafted Master Plan was conducted, he said \u2018we didn\u2019t \ndo a survey. Well, we did a \u201cwindshield survey\u201d: I sent some engineers out in cars and had them look and \nsee how things were\u2026. If people knew we were measuring them, things would get too political. We \nknow what needs to be done without having to survey.\u2019xxxvii This scarcity of numbers and maps in Delhi \nis what led me to study the slum survey process in the first place. It was therefore no surprise to me in \nobserving surveys in 2005-2006 that land-use maps and statistical summaries were virtually absent. A \nformer special consultant with the Slum Wing of the MCD, which conducts its own surveys of slums on \nits land, told me that \u2018Survey and land-use numbers are concocted. If you survey a slum a second time \nthe numbers will come out totally different.\u2019xxxviii The slum survey, and land use planning in Delhi more \ngenerally, clearly does not rest on \u2018mechanically objective\u2019 or \u2018scientifically rational\u2019 survey procedures, \nnor does it capture an accurate summary of the land, today. \nThis change in the slum survey has had significant implications for the politics of calculation. The \nevaluation of slums in the first moment of urban improvement (1990-2000) took place locally: knowledge \nof the territory is assembled as government officials walked through the narrow corridors of slums, a \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 30 \nprocess slum residents could observe and in which they could intervene, as the counter-survey conducted \nby the Delhi Shramik Sangathan (DSS) discussed in Section IV demonstrated. However, the main calculative \npractice of government today is located in the courtroom when a judge assesses the legality of a slum \nthrough a set of photographs. Calculative practices today therefore require far less \u2018translation,\u2019 as Latour \n(1986) calls it, between \u2018reality out there\u2019 and \u2018reality in here.\u2019 That is, physical space is not being \naccurately\/\u2018objectively\u2019 assessed, and a correspondence between a \u2018paper truth\u2019 and \u2018reality out there\u2019 is \npassed over in making expert claims. Once the court passes an order, the correspondence between the \nphysical space of the slum and the photograph used to depict that slum in the courtroom cannot be easily \nquestioned, making governmental calculation less prone to the intrusion of local knowledge and counter-\nclaims. As a result, attempts to contest the slum survey, as the DSS did through its counter-survey, have \nvastly different effects today than they did in the first moment of urban improvement.  \nFor example, during a slum survey in April 2006, another slum organization affiliated with DSS \ncalled Nirman Mazdoor Panchayat Sangam (Association of Construction Worker Committees) conducted a \ncounter-survey along the lines of the DSS survey described above. However, after presenting its counter-\nsurvey to government officials, the officials responded by saying, \u2018The demolition is based on a court \norder. It is out of our hands.\u2019 Knowledge of the traits of the slum was not based on the physical slum \nsurvey, so the counter-survey\u2019s claim to accurate knowledge had limited effect because government did \nnot itself claim rigorous knowledge of the slum as a basis of authority. The counter-survey\u2019s influence on \nthe overall terms of the demolition was that the DDA accepted a more diverse type of residence proof \n(e.g. Nirman-issued identification cards) to confirm the residents\u2019 resettlement eligibility. As a result, it \nprovided more residents with the option of resettlement, but the demolition proceeded just the same. \nThe counter-survey\u2019s overall effect, then, was not a challenge to the demolition; rather, it facilitated the \ngovernmental exercise of enumerating the residents and showing them that resettlement was a desirable \noption.  \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 31 \nFor most slum dwellers in Delhi today, resettlement has become not only the most exulted path \nto improvement, but also the only such path for those unable to buy private plots. The increasingly \npowerful hand of the sovereign state in ordering slum demolitions, combined with slum dwellers\u2019 self-\nperception as illegal, largely cultivated through the slum survey (among other meansxxxix), has made \ndemolition appear inevitable to many. As public housing expenditure has stagnated and liberalization of \nthe land market has driven up land prices, other options for increased livelihood and tenure security have \nbeen gradually removed. As a result, resettlement has been elevated as the primary target of slum life. We \nthus find that the combination of a dominant and imposing aesthetic order in the city and a set of micro-\npractices operating on and through individual desires to re-calibrate slum residents\u2019 sense of self and \nplace has made the \u2018world-class city\u2019 appear in the interest of the greater good, even to many of those \nwho will be displaced to make way for its arrival. This is not to say that counter-conduct has disappeared \nor that rule is complete. New forms of aesthetic counter-conduct aimed at challenging the image of the \nworld-class city are beginning to emerge in Delhi (including by the DSS, which I will explore in future \nwork), but have not yet been able solicit interest in a large enough percentage of the slum population to \nslow the slum removal process. \nTo consider more fully how the combination of an imposed aesthetic order and the slum survey \nmight guide the population\u2019s interest, and to say something about the epistemological foundation of an \naesthetic governmentality, I want to take a page from Bernard Cohn\u2019s (1996) classic study of colonial \nknowledge in British India. Inspired by Foucault, Cohn focused on what he called the \u2018investigative \nmodalities\u2019 used to assemble knowledge and build the imperial capacity to govern. In addition to his \ndiscussion of a \u2018survey modality\u2019 and \u2018enumerative modality,\u2019 Cohn found another set of modalities that \noperated more through the cultural domain of habits, tastes and expression than facts and figures. One \nof these, the \u2018observational\/travel modality,\u2019 provides direct insight into how the imposition of an \naesthetic order in Delhi today has a governmental effect.  \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 32 \nAs Cohn said, \u2018The questions that arise in examining this modality are related to the creation of a \nrepertoire of images and typifications that determined what was significant to the European eye\u2019 (6). This \nmodality works by providing a narrative for the experience of, or movement through, a given space. It \ncreates expectations for how space looks and how it should look. Cohn discussed this primarily in terms \nof establishing set itineraries or patterns of movement for newcomers to India so that they could easily \ncomprehend \u2018India\u2019 through an already narrated experience (cf. Goswami, 2004: Ch. 3); but this modality \ncould also be thought of more broadly as training a particular way of seeing. By providing routine, shared \nexperiences of moving in a given space a consistent narrative or set of clear aesthetic markers, this \ntechnique makes the experience of space itself the inter-subjective epistemological basis for knowing that \nspace and its features. When this narrative of moving through and seeing space becomes dominant \nwithin a population\u2014i.e. when it prompts the viewing public to identify with the state\u2019s vision\u2014then how \none sees that space becomes the basis for assessing what that space is, positively, and what it should be, \nnormatively. That is, seeing becomes a way of knowing because the shared experience of moving and \nliving in space becomes a basis of intelligibility; seeing becomes a calculative practice. This is the function \nof the slum survey: it takes hold of a set of aesthetic indicators prescribed by the law and trains slum \ndwellers to see themselves and the space of the city through that aesthetic lens. \u2018What is observed and \nreported\u2019 in this process \u2018is mediated by particular socio-political contexts as well as historically specific \naesthetic principles\u2019 (Cohn 1996, 7). Crary (1992) has called this mediation of how the visual field is \nencountered and filtered a \u2018technique of the observer,\u2019 or how the observer\u2019s position and way of seeing \nis the outcome of socio-historical processes. Walking through slums with slum dwellers and showing \nthem how the state views such spaces trains slum dwellers to \u2018see like the state,\u2019 to borrow Scott\u2019s (1998) \nphrase. This, I have argued in this paper, produces definite governmental effects. \n This ability to provide a normative dimension to seeing, to cultivate an aesthetic normativity in \nthe population, forms a distinct calculative foundation of government. As Cohn says, the power to \n\u2018propound canons of taste\u2019 is \u2018among the most significant instrumentalities of rulership\u2019 (10). The \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 33 \nprevalence of a powerful, shared aesthetic and narrative of urban improvement in Delhi, which is \nendowed to the slum population (in part) through the slum survey, confirms the significance of seeing \nand standards of taste as a key instrumentality, or calculability, of rule. \n \nVII. Conclusion \n \nIn this paper, I have attempted to shed light on a type of technology of power that can be \nconsidered governmental\u2014in the sense of guiding the conduct of the population from a distance (Rose \n1999)\u2014but which has been largely unaccounted for in the governmentality literature. Foucault found \n\u2018scientifically rational\u2019 statistics to be \u2018the main technical factor\u2019 (2007, 104), or calculative practice, \nundergirding governmental knowledge. This observation has led governmentality scholars to the \nepistemological presumption that \u2018To govern a problem requires that it be counted\u2019 (Rose, 1999: 221), \nthus treating Foucault\u2019s historically and geographically specific conclusion about the calculative \nfoundation of government as analytically generalizable. Be it the census (e.g. Brown & Boyle, 2000; \nCorbridge, Williams, Srivastava, & Veron, 2005; Dirks, 2001; Murdoch & Ward, 1997), mapping (e.g. \nHannah, 2000; Joyce, 2003; Legg, 2006a), accounting practices (e.g. Miller & O'Leary, 1987; Miller & \nRose, 1990), resource statistics (e.g. Agrawal, 2005; Demeritt, 2001), or any host of statistical \naggregations, empirical studies making use of the governmentality framework often take the \nidentification of numbers or other \u2018scientific\u2019 depictions of targets of rule as the starting point for their \nanalysis. But, few studies have explicitly considered how government operates in the absence of such \nnumerical accuracy and \u2018scientificity\u2019 (Foucault, 2007: 350). What is to say that numbers necessarily play a \ndetermining role in producing subjectivity and conducting conduct? What is to say that other forms of \nknowledge do not have greater affective power in producing governmental effects?xl This concern is \nespecially relevant in postcolonial contexts given that the technical means to secure accurate statistical \nknowledge are often incomplete in the post-colonial state (Corbridge et al., 2005: 18; Hansen & \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 34 \nStepputat, 2001); or, when such knowledge is gathered, it is often missing, deliberately concealed, forged, \nor unused (see Hull, 2008; Roy, 2004).  \nIn Foucault\u2019s final lecture of Security, Territory, Population, where he lays out his concluding \ntreatment of \u2018modern and contemporary governmentality\u2019 (2007: 348), he states, \u2018The knowledge \ninvolved [in this governmentality] must be scientific in its procedures. Second, this scientific knowledge is \nabsolutely indispensable for good government. A government that did not take into account this kind of \nanalysis\u2026 would be bound to fail.\u2019 He continues by saying that \u2018government cannot do without the \nconsequences, the results, of this science\u2019 (2007: 350-1). Recent empirical studies making use of the \ngovernmentality framework that find an absence\/shortage of numerical accuracy or scientific survey \ntechniques similarly conclude that such a lack of scientific knowledge leads to the failure of governmental \nprojects, or to general unruliness (e.g. Legg, 2007: Ch. 4). While it may often be the case that the absence \nof, or inability to create, an intelligible summary of governmental targets (e.g. territory, populations, \nillegal \u2018elements,\u2019 etc.) through numerical survey leads to a failure to \u2018govern from a distance,\u2019 might a \nshortage of numbers, or geometric\/\u2019planimetric\u2019 accuracy, give rise to other techniques that provide \u2018a \n\u201ccalculative\u201d sense of the identity of land\u2019 and population (Pottage, 1994: 371)? Thus, while Smart (2001: \n31) suggests that \u2018we need to pay more attention to spaces in which control seems to be conspicuously \nabsent, where neglect is more apparent than surveillance,\u2019 I suggest that we also need to pay more \nattention to spaces in which surveillance and monitoring are conspicuously absent, but where control is \nnonetheless achieved. For, Foucault initially contrasted the less rigorous technical requirements of \ngovernmental knowledge with the more panoptic and comprehensive techniques of disciplinary \nknowledge centred on the precise surveillance of bodies. Governmental knowledge\u2019s epistemological \ndifference is its ability to govern while knowing less, to operate at a distance, to conduct individuals\u2019 \nconduct by operating on a scale and summoning categories larger than that of individuals but that \nnonetheless somehow resonate at the scale of everyday life. The epistemology of government, then, \nappears to be marked by a certain \u2018unknowing.\u2019 An absence of numerical accuracy or \u2018the rule of \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 35 \nevidence\u2019 (Foucault, 2007: 350) should, perhaps, be the presumed epistemological condition of \ngovernmental knowledge. \n I have explored these issues here by analyzing two different moments of urban improvement in \nDelhi, each with a distinct calculative foundation, but both geared toward educating slum dwellers\u2019 desire \nfor voluntary resettlement. Each moment thus shared the governing rationality of producing a \u2018slum-free\u2019 \nDelhi, but the technical means of achieving this end differed. The calculative foundation of the first \nmoment (1990-2000) was characterized by the \u2018scientific\u2019, or \u2018mechanically objective\u2019 (Porter, 1995), \nsurvey of slum space. By collating the complex dynamics of slums into intelligible and easily manageable \ncategories\u2014those \u2018eligible\u2019 for resettlement and thus improvable, versus those \u2018ineligible\u2019\u2014the survey \naimed to divide the slum population\u2019s interest, reduce the likelihood of resistance, and depict slum \ndemolition as a process of urban improvement. However, the slum survey itself became politicized \nthrough this process, leading to resistance not only to the terms of resettlement, but also to the \ncalculative foundation of government. By conducting their own surveys, slum residents engaged in \ncalculative counter-conduct, appropriating the calculative techniques of government and turning them \nagainst the existing governmental rationality.  \nIn response to slum unruliness in the late 1990s, a new calculative foundation of government \ngave rise. No longer premised on rigorous \u2018scientific\u2019 assessment of slum space, government would know \nand assess space based on outward visual appearance alone. Through a rise of juridical power, in \nparticular the law of nuisance, a new aesthetic norm\u2014which I have called \u2018world-class\u2019 aesthetics\u2014was \nestablished, against which urban space could be evaluated from a distance. Now, if a space looks polluting \nand dirty, regardless of its formal legality or relationship to the Master Plan, nuisance law deems it illegal. \nIn contrast, spaces that positively portray Delhi in its world-class pursuits (e.g. shopping malls), even if \nstatutorily illegal and in violation of the Master Plan, are deemed legal. Bypassing the need for rigorous \nphysical survey, government in this second moment (~2000-) assigned the slum survey a new role: \naesthetically training slum residents to read the territory through world-class aesthetics.  \nGheter, D.A. (2010). \u2018Calculating without numbers,\u2019 Economy and Society 39(2): 185-217. \n 36 \nThat affect plays a central role in shaping power, that the ability to govern from a centre (i.e. the \nstate) is bound to the ability to tell stories or put on displays that evoke favourable responses within\u2014or \nimpart subjunctive imaginaries to\u2014\u2018the governed,\u2019 and that myth and rumour are invoked to authorize \nauthority (e.g. Amin, 1984; Taussig, 1997) are all well known. Yet, the governmentality framework has \nnot seriously considered how these modes of governing are incorporated into governmental programs, \nwhich, in my view, has confined its applicability and rendered it distant from the experience of everyday \nlife, and thus the stage on which governing rationalities gain meaning. By showing that a type of aesthetic \ngovernmentality can be equally or more effective than \u2018governing by numbers\u2019 (Rose, 1991), I have \nattempted to take preliminary steps toward a more historically and geographically specific treatment of \nthe epistemology of government.  \nThus, while the Delhi case shows an instance of the supersession of a statistical mode of \ngovernment by a more aesthetic one\u2014a pattern we might expect to see in other contexts marked by \ncontestation over government statistics\/maps and a strong normative sense of improvement (be it \npreparation for an international event (e.g. the Olympics), postcolonial anxiety about \u2018catching up\u2019, or \nurban entrepreneurialism)\u2014this mode, like any other, has its own calculative risks and vulnerabilities. \nGovernment in Delhi today rests on the continued ability to produce subjects whose interests align with \nthe vision of a world-class city, only now it relies on a general aesthetic sense of improvement more than \n\u2018mechanically objective\u2019 criteria for classifying urban space. Thus, while it is less prone to the intrusions \nof local counter-claims and disputes over the procedures of classification, if alternative aesthetic visions \nof Delhi are popularized, or if the promise of resettlement no longer adequately manages slum residents\u2019 \naversion to displacement, then the legitimacy of slum demolitions will undoubtedly be called into \nquestion, requiring another shift in the calculative foundation of government at the very least, if not \ndeeper shifts in the rationality of rule.  \nGheter, D.A.

In his first lecture in Security, Territory, Population, Foucault uses the \nexample of town planning to show the different strategic functions of each of these modes. The goal of sovereign power, in \nthe context of \u2018the town,\u2019 is to secure control over the territory: \u2018 a good sovereign\u2026 is someone well placed within the \nterritory, and a territory that is well policed in terms of obedience to the sovereign is a territory that has a good spatial layout\u2019 \n(Foucault, 2007: 14). As a disciplinary instrument, planning operates by imposing a hierarchical distribution of elements \nthrough zoning. It thus does not start by thinking of the town as the centre or capital of the territory, which is the approach of \nsovereign power, but rather on the basis of a hierarchical and geometric figure used to ensure that spaces and components of \nthe city are functionally efficient and in their proper place. The security dimension of planning focuses on facilitating the \ncirculation of \u2018what is good\u2019 and reducing what is \u2018bad\u2019 through programs to increase the well-being of the population (e.g. \nsanitation and hygiene campaigns). Its goal is not perfection, as is the case with the disciplinary model, but of maximizing the \npositive elements within the town. \nv For Porter (1995), mechanical objectivity consists of the repetition of standardized procedures of measurement, \ndemarcation, quantification, and reportage that are typically required when the subjective discretion\/judgment of \u2018experts\u2019 is \nquestioned. Mitchell too describes how it is through a well-defined set of procedures that objectivity is established: \u2018The \nperformance of the law will gain its authority from following this particular sequence of acts [granting land, survey of \nboundaries, placing of boundary stones, recording of measurements\u2026]\u2019 (2002: 58).  \nvi This information is compiled based on DDA survey instructions, DDA Annual Reports describing survey outcomes, and \ninterviews with DDA staff in 2005 about slum surveys in this period. \nvii MCD. 2002. Annual Report of the Slum and JJ Wing, 2001-2002. \nviii The slum re-housing that took place in the 1980s was called \u2018resettlement,\u2019 whereas by the mid-1990s it was formally called \n\u2018relocation.\u2019 The terms and reasons behind such re-housing differed, with the latter carrying weaker tenure rights, but the \npoint here is that slum dwellers in the post-1990 scenario did not recognize this distinction and saw contemporary relocation \nprograms through the lens of the positive experience of earlier slum re-housing programs. Slum residents and government \nofficials use the same word in Hindi (punarvas) to describe both types of re-housing. \nix Resettlement plots are now 12.5 or 18 m2 in size, depending on the date of one\u2019s residence proof, whereas they were 50 m2 \nin the 1970s. Unlike old resettlement colonies located within the city limits, current resettlement plots are typically more than \n30 kilometres away from residents\u2019 original jobs and homes, have access to far fewer public services than slums, have few local \njob prospects, come with mere five year residency licenses (far less secure than ownership or a lease), and have grave health \nand environmental conditions (see Menon-Sen & Bhan, 2008). \nx These observations are based on survey instructions from this period, conversations with DDA surveyors in 2005 about \ntheir past experiences conducting slum surveys, and interviews with slum residents surveyed in the 1990s. \nGheter, D.A.

DDA has not allotted any land to Slum & JJ \nDepartment [responsible for slum housing] during 1992-97\u2026. Prima facie, the allocation of land for the housing of the urban \npoor has been insufficient to meet the requirements, and below the proportion of their share [provided through the Master \nPlan]\u2019 (29-30). \nxxv Compare this with studies that point to the increased importance of the node of sovereignty in the sovereignty-discipline-\ngovernment triangle in (post)colonial contexts (e.g. Legg, 2007; Moore, 2005; Prakash, 1999; Watts, 2003). \nxxvi  See note 3, paragraph 22. \nxxvii Compare with the role of aesthetics in the high-modernist programs explored by Scott (1998, especially Ch. 7). \nxxviii See Hindustan Times, \u2018A tale of two bridges\u2019, January 18, 2007. \nxxix Almrita Patel vs. Union of India (Supreme Court), final judgment, Supreme Court Cases 2000 (2): 679, emphasis added. \nxxx CWP 6553\/2000 (Delhi High Court), order dated February 16, 2001. \nxxxi See The Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 133. \nxxxii Combined demolitions reported by the DDA and Slum and JJ Wing of the Municipal Corporation from 1997-2007 lead to \nthe conservative estimate of 710,000 displaced residents. From 2004 onwards, the Slum Wing has reported only households \nthat have been resettled, leaving the vast majority of the recently displaced unrecorded.

For example, in a 51 person, in-depth \nsurvey I conducted in a slum in West Delhi in 2007, 40 respondents agreed with the statement \u201cIn ten years Delhi will have \nno slums.\u201d \nxxxvi DDA Annual Reports show that, each year, fewer than 10% of the structures surveyed and given notice for encroaching \npublic land are demolished. This is because the DDA initiates proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of \nUnauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 only when it intends to use that land for a particular purpose. \nxxxvii Interview with Mr. A.K. Jain, May 26, 2005. \nxxxviii Interview at informant\u2019s office, May 24, 2005. \nxxxix The rise of the new middle class in India\u2019s post-liberalization period (1991-) has been shaped by a politics of visibility and \ndisplay in which codes of behaviour and the quality of physical space acquire heightened discursive and representational \nsignificance (Fernandes, 2006). The \u2018intensified circulation of images of global cities through cinema, television, and the \ninternet\u2019 (Chatterjee, 2004: 143); the representation of this new middle class in popular culture and state policy as the model \ncitizen of India\u2019s grand, \u2018world-class\u2019 future (see Brosius, 2007); and the rapid  capitalization of the built environment all \ncontribute to the collective re-imagining of the Indian city. \nxl My aim here is not to deny the power of numbers (or maps) to simplify and centralize knowledge (see Asad, 1994; Hacking, \n1992; Harley, 2001) or the historical significance of statistics\/maps in extending new forms of rule (see Barry, Osborne, & \nRose, 1993), especially in colonial contexts (see Appadurai, 1993; Dirks, 2001; Edney, 1997; Prakash, 1999). Nor is my goal to \ndiscredit studies that empirically describe how individuals\u2019 desires and populations\u2019 interests are shaped through numbers (e.g. \nMiller & O'Leary, 1987; Miller & Rose, 1990). In section III I showed how the slum survey in Delhi operated precisely in this \nmanner through the 1990s. Rather, I have here attempted to consider the dissemination of aesthetic norms as a different type \nof governmental technology. \nGheter, D.A.
