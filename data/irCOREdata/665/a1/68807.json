Introduction\nThe performance bottleneck imposed by on-chip inter-\nconnects in the deep submicron regime of process technol-\nogy has been widely documented [15], as have the benefits\nof standardization of on-chip communication [3]. Imple-\nmenting a standardized communication architecture such as\na packet-switched NoC for massively integrated multipro-\ncessor systems provides an abstraction of the global inter-\nconnection link and can greatly reduce design effort, po-\ntentially at the cost of some area and possibly power and\nperformance penalties. The suitability of the NoC as a com-\nmunication architecture depends on the overall system; i.e.\nthe number of autonomous functioning blocks, the degree\nof parallelism, and area and performance requirements dic-\ntate its usefulness. The precise quantification of the per-\nformance and overhead of the network is of paramount im-\nportance in making this decision. The potential of the 2-D\nNoC for interconnecting multi-processor systems has been\nwidely researched, and most recently an 80 tile, 100M tran-\nsistor system with 1.28 TFLOP peak performance has been\ndemonstrated in a 65nm, 1V technology [17]. However a\nmajor new paradigm for continued Moore\u2019s law integration\nis 3-D chip stacks based on a variety of vertical intercon-\nnection techniques [1], [16]. 3-D integration provides op-\nportunities for cost reduction and yield improvement in in-\ntegration of different technologies such as CMOS, DRAM\nand MEMS circuits through the ability to implement them\nover multiple die layers on the same chip. It can also re-\nduce form factor in applications where size is critical, while\neffective heat dissipation and temperature control can be a\nchallenge. To get the most benefit out of 3-D chip stacks\nin multiprocessor systems, the communication architecture\nhas to support efficient and high throughput vertical com-\nmunication. In this article we examine the scalability of the\nNoC for such systems.\nWe build on previous work published in the literature\nand investigate the scalability of the three NoC architectures\nof 2-D mesh, 3-D mesh (with switch connectivity between\nlayers) and 3-D bus (with bus connectivity between layers)\nwith respect to performance. This is accomplished by quan-\ntifying latency and throughput of the different architectures\nfor various network sizes, under two representative traffic\n978-1-4244-4143-3\/09\/$25.00 \u00a92009 IEEE \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The Nostrum network\ncommunication protocol used in this study is based on a\nbufferless hot-potato routing algorithm [12], while the bus\nprotocol utilizes a centrally arbitrated least-served-first pri-\nority scheme.\nCycle accurate RTL simulations are carried out to cap-\nture latency and throughput in terms of hops between nodes\nand hops per node per cycle respectively, for symmetric net-\nworks up to 1000 nodes. Various injection rates are used to\nstudy saturation points for the two traffic patterns. The main\ncontribution of this paper is in providing a novel and exten-\nsive analysis into the scalability of 3-D NoC architectures as\nthe number of nodes and layers grows. This study quantifies\nperformance to aid the design of the communication archi-\ntecture of future massively integrated 3-D systems.The rest\nof the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2\ndiscusses related work while the following section discusses\nnetwork implementation issues including the protocols, net-\nwork topology and architecture of the different switches and\nbus arbiter. Sections 4 and 5 describe the exploration space,\nthe simulation and calculation methodology and the results.\nWe end with a discussion of the results and our conclusions.\n2. Related Work\nA comprehensive overview of processing and technolog-\nical issues in 3-D integration can be found in [16] while a\ndiscussion of the physical level cost and performance trade-\noffs associated with the different techniques is provided in\n[18]. The different NoC-based system architectures for 3-\nD systems have been exhaustively enumerated in [14], de-\npending on whether a die housed in a tile has one layer or\nseveral layers, and whether the NoC itself is 2-D or 3-D.\nThe average unloaded latency per bit has also been derived,\nshowing the potential improvements in latency and power\nconsumption obtainable through a 3-D architecture, but the\nperformance of the network for different traffic patterns un-\nder a packet-switched protocol is necessary to evaluate its\nscalability. An investigation into different router structures\nwas conducted in [6] which proposes a 3-D crossbar-style\nNoC and performs cycle accurate simulations to extract en-\nergy and latency metrics. However the study fixes on a 64\nnode network. In [13] a multi-layer NoC router architecture\nis explored for a number of traffic patterns. In this paper, the\nnumber of nodes is fixed at 36 and the number of layers in\nthe 3-D stack is kept constant at four. A well known paper\nthat describes the performance of communication networks\nof varying dimension for wormhole routing is [2], which\ngeneralizes the interconnection network as being a k-ary n-\ncube torus, with n being the dimension of the cube, and k\nbeing the radix, or number of switches in a given dimension.\nIn it Dally points out that VLSI circuits are wire-limited,\nand any growth in dimension has to be accompanied by a re-\nlated reduction in the parallelism of each link and therefore\nthe appropriate analysis of performance of interconnection\nnetworks for VLSI circuits has to be under the constraint of\nconstant bisection bandwidth. It is shown that under various\nwire delay models, including transmission-line like and RC\nlike behavior, for relatively large networks with 1M nodes,\nthe best performance is delivered by switches of relatively\nlow dimension, around 5 or 6. Due to layout restrictions,\nthe most common implementation of the NoC for both 2-\nD and 3-D is a mesh, which is not directly comparable to\nthe tori considered in [2]. In a 2-D mesh a switch has links\nto four other switches and its resource, while the straight-\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\nAverage Number of Links per Node trend\nNo. of nodes in network\nA\nve\nra\nge\n N\num\nbe\nr o\nf L\nin\nks\n p\ner\n N\nod\ne\n3D Network\n2D Network\n3D Bus\nFigure 2.

Restrictions apply. \nforward extension for 3-D is to consider a switch with two\nadditional inter-layer links (with the seventh port being con-\nnected to the resource). Therefore it is of interest to inves-\ntigate the scalability (i.e. variation of key metrics related\nto latency and throughput with size of network) of the NoC\nfor this topology. Further, two key assumptions in [2] are\nlikely to have an effect; firstly the study is carried out under\nthe assumption of uniform links, but as explained below the\nvertical links have a significantly different delay model than\nthe horizontal links. Secondly, the assumption of constant\nbisection bandwidth needs to be revisited as the footprint of\nthe vertical interconnects is different in general to the hori-\nzontal links.\nThe electrical behavior of the relatively short and wide\nTSV is much better than that of long on-chip interconnects,\nprimarily due to the low resistance, and can support much\nhigher signaling speeds, but a relatively high area penalty\ndue to via blockage may impose constraints on the num-\nber of TSVs that can be used for communication. This has\nled the authors of [7] to propose a dynamic time-division-\nmultiple-access (dTDMA) bus with a centralized arbiter for\nthe vertical communication link, which allows single hop\nlatency for packets between any number of vertical layers.\nMost recently [5] describes a detailed study using differ-\nent traffic patterns under a realistic protocol for both ar-\nchitectures to derive figures of merit related to throughput,\nlatency, energy and area overhead to characterize various\ntopologies. However the question of the general scalabil-\nity of the different architectures with network size has not\nbeen addressed. Finally [11] describes a working 3-layer\n27 node prototype that provides proof of concept of the 3-D\nNoC, but identify the need for a 3-D network simulator and\nsystem-level explorations of the kind discussed here.\n3. Link and Network layer Protocols\nThe NoC protocol employed in this study is a hot-potato\nimplementation with switch architecture as described in\n[12]. The routing strategy is based on non-minimal and\nload dependent deflection type packet switching, with adap-\ntive per hop routing. A relative addressing scheme is\nimplemented which simplifies the duplication of identical\nswitches when network structures of varying sizes are de-\nsigned.\nThe switches employed in all of the network configu-\nrations in this study are bufferless, and directly connected\nwith their associated resource with a 1:1 resource to switch\nratio. A packet cannot be stored in a switch, and thus in each\ncycle the packets must be moved from switch to switch or\ndeflected back to a resource. To reduce the complexity of\nthe switches, deterministic routing is favored over adaptive\nrouting in buffered networks [10],[4],[1]-[3]. In bufferless\nnetworks, deflection routing is advocated [16] because it is\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\nAverage normalized latency growth\nTime in clock cycles\nA\nve\nra\nge\n n\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n la\nte\nnc\ny \nFigure 3.

The implemented switch uses 128-bit in-\nput and output channels for each switch-to-switch Physical\nChannel (PC) and resource to switch connection. For 2-D\nstructures a 5-port switch is used as in Figure (1a), while for\n3-D structures a 7-port switch, as shown in Figure (1b), is\nused where the inter layer connectivity is implemented with\ntwo simplex channels having the same switch-to-switch bit-\nwidth as the horizontal channels.\nA TDMA vertical bus to provide connectivity between\nnetwork layers is also designed as seen in Figure (1c). It\nis a centrally arbitrated bus employing a least-served-first\npriority scheme for packet arbitration. The matrix arbiter\ncircuit in [4] has been extended to deal with up to 10 layers.\nThe bus has a 10 packet deep FIFO buffer at each input to\nprevent packet loss for the maximum network size. The bus\nruns on a clock 16 times faster than the network clock to\nprovide serialization and de-serialization time, potentially\ncircumventing area limitations for vertical TSV connectiv-\nity between layers. Hence the bus can accommodate a re-\nduction in the bit width of the vertical channel up to a ratio\nof 1\/16 and still receive and deliver a packet to a destination,\non any layer, within one cycle of the network clock. It is\nconnected to 6-port switches through a 128-bit Input\/Output\nPC. In this study, every switch on a given layer is connected\nto a separate bus, and a single bus connects all switches that\nare vertically in-line. Thus, a 5x5x5 network will have 25\nbuses in total.\nThe packets are generated by each resource and injected\ninto the network with an injection rate of up to 0.9 packets\nper node per cycle. For this study, a packet is considered to\nbe one flit long. Each resource has a FIFO buffer to tem-\nporarily store packets if they cannot enter the network due\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 09:10 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nto congestion. These packets are queued and re-injected\ninto the network with a higher priority than newly generated\npackets. The implemented network does not drop packets.\nThe packet headers generated by the resource contain final\ndestination addresses and the switches make routing deci-\nsions on the fly based on this information.\nAny NoC structure is comprised of switches located in\ngeneral at the corners, edges, surface and center of the phys-\nical structure. For example a 2-D switch has 4 links to other\nswitches in 4 directions, namely, North, South, East and\nWest. A 3-D switch has two additional, Up and Down links\ngiving a total of 6 bi-directional links, whereas a bus ar-\nchitecture adds only one extra link to the switch, to give a\ntotal of 5 bi-directional links. There is also an additional bi-\ndirectional port from switch to resource in each case. For\na given NoC structure, not all of the links can be used for\nrouting packets. For example, only half of the switch-to-\nswitch links in the corner of the network are connected,\nhalving the available switch bandwidth due to the uncon-\nnected edge ports. The total number of connected links, in\nany NoC structure depends on the topology, dimension and\nsize of the network. Figure 2 depicts the number of links as\na function of network size in a mesh topology to highlight\nthe differences between a 2-D 5-port switch, a 3-D 7-port\nswitch, and a 3-D bus architecture as defined in equations\n(1), (2) and (3) respectively.\nFor a 2-D n\u00d7n network:\nL2D = 4n(n\u2212 1) (1)\nFor a 3-D n\u00d7n\u00d7n network:\nL3DN = 6n2(n\u2212 1) (2)\nFor a 3-D Bus n\u00d7n\u00d7n network:\nL3DB = 4n2(n\u2212 5) + 32 (3)\nAll three curves for the different architectures show a\nsharp rise as network size increases and then begin to level\noff as the number of corner and edge nodes (i.e. nodes with\nsome ports unconnected) become outweighed by the fully\nconnected nodes. This trend of growth of links per node\nallows for higher throughput as the network size increases\ndue to the increased bandwidth available to route a packet\nin the network. Additionally, it is clear from this figure that\nthe 7-port switch has an advantage over the other topolo-\ngies due to the increased number of switch-to-switch links\nper node available to route the traffic in the network for a\ngiven network size. The 3-D bus architecture has the least\nnumber of links due to the fact that all switches in a given\nvertical line share a common uni-directional link. The 7-\nport design benefits from separate PCs between every layer\nto handle multiple packets simultaneously within one cycle\non any given vertical line from the bottom to the top layer.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2D Network with 5\u2212port Switches \u2212 Load per Channel\nNo. of nodes in network\nLo\nad\n p\ner\n C\nha\nnn\nel\nInjection Rate = 0.1\nInjection Rate = 0.3\nInjection Rate = 0.5\nInjection Rate = 0.7\nInjection Rate = 0.9\n(a)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\n3D Network with 7\u2212port Switches \u2212 Load per Channel\nNo. of nodes in network\nLo\nad\n p\ner\n C\nha\nnn\nel\nInjection Rate = 0.1\nInjection Rate = 0.3\nInjection Rate = 0.5\nInjection Rate = 0.7\nInjection Rate = 0.9\n(b)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3D Network with Bus 6\u2212port Switches \u2212 Load per Channel\nNo. of nodes in network\nLo\nad\n p\ner\n C\nha\nnn\nel\nInjection Rate = 0.1\nInjection Rate = 0.3\nInjection Rate = 0.5\nInjection Rate = 0.7\nInjection Rate = 0.9\n(c)\nFigure 4.

Traffic Patterns and Simulation Setup\nThe simulations were performed for a 2-D network with\nsize n\u00d7n, for n = 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 19, 23, 27 and 32 nodes,\nwith packet injection rates, r, varying from 0.1 to 0.9 pack-\nets per node per cycle in step increments of 0.1. For the 3-D\n7-port switch and 3-D bus architectures, the network size\nwas n\u00d7n\u00d7n for n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 with the\nsame injection rate as in the 2-D case. The number of sim-\nulated nodes in the 2-D mesh follows the 3-D setup to pro-\nvide a fair comparison. The data sample used is extracted\nfollowing the warm-up phase of the network and preceding\nthe cool-down phase to ensure reliable results. For example,\nFigure 3 shows the average latency growth for a 5\u00d75\u00d75 3-\nD mesh network with an injection rate of 0.5. The warm-up\nphase occupies the first 200 clock cycles. After 500 clock\ncycles the network is fully stable until the simulation ends.\nIn our experiments samples were obtained after the network\nreached stability but for certain combinations of network\nsize and injection rate, the network never becomes stable.\nThese cases are identified in the discussion.\nThe metrics used to quantify the performance of the net-\nwork in each case are raw latency, normalized latency, and\nthroughput, defined in (4), (5) and (7) respectively.\nTRaw =\n(CFinal \u2212 CInit)\nHC\n(4)\nThe raw latency, TRaw, is the distance traveled by a\npacket from the source to the destination address in terms\nof hop counts, denoted by HC. CFinal and CInit repre-\nsent the final and initial clock cycles respectively. When the\nnetwork is at zero-load, the raw latency is equivalent to the\nminimum distance. The normalized latency, TNorm is the\nratio of the raw latency (i.e. the actual distance traveled by a\npacket) to the minimum distance with zero-load, TZero load,\ndefined as:\nTNorm =\nTRaw\nTZero load\n(5)\nThe average normalized latency is the mean of the nor-\nmalized latencies for the collected samples defined as:\nTNorm Avg = mean(TNorm) (6)\nIn each cycle, packets arrive at all nodes at a rate based\non the injection rate and the congestion level of the net-\nwork. The throughput per node per cycle, \u03bb, is defined in\n(7), where PTotal is the total number of packets received\nover the simulated range, N is the number of nodes in the\nnetwork and C is the number of cycles in the sampling re-\ngion.\n\u03bb =\nPTotal\nN \u00d7 C (7)\nThe generated traffic patterns attempt to load the net-\nwork in a realistic manner as would be encountered on a\nmulti-processor SoC. A hybrid of two traffic patterns are\nemployed for all cases, uniform random traffic (URT) and\nlocal traffic models. The URT model stipulates that each\nnode in the network is equally likely to become the destina-\ntion address of any packet emitted from a resource. From a\ndesign perspective, it is customary to place frequently com-\nmunicating resources close to each other to maximize ef-\nficiency. This increases the performance of the commu-\nnication in terms of power, timing and resource manage-\nment. The local traffic pattern generated for each resource\nreplicates this localized communication behavior. The des-\ntination address is assigned randomly and then a localized\nprobability formula [8] is applied to the address, as shown\nin Equation (8) and (9). This formula increases the proba-\nbility that the final destination of the packet will be local to\nthe sending resource rather than farther away. This follows\nthe principle that the resources will be arranged within the\nnetwork such that their nearest neighbors are devices with\nwhich they communicate with most frequently.\nThe localized probability for local traffic patterns is de-\nfined in (8), where D is the maximum distance in the net-\nwork and (9) is a normalizing factor guaranteeing that the\nsum of all probabilities is 1 [8].\nP (d) =\n1\n(A(D)2d)\n(8)\nA(D) =\n\u2211 1\n(2d)\n(9)\nIn order to compare traffic patterns, a fully URT pattern\nwithout localization was also implemented. This pattern\nmeans that any address within a given network is equally\nlikely to be assigned to each packet being generated. To\nmaintain stability in the network, the injection rate is low-\nered as the number of nodes is increased. The injection rate\nas a function of size is determined by Equation (15) and\nshown in Table 1.\nThe load, \u03b3, that each node puts on the network is shown\nin (10), where r is injection rate from 0.1 to 0.9 and HC is\nthe average hop count in the network [9].\n\u03b3Ntwrk = r \u00d7HC (10)\nWe assume that a packet loads the network with each\nhop by 1, because it occupies 1 link per hop. Equation (10)\nshows that the load depends on the injection rate of each\nnode and on the average distance of each packet. HC grows\nwith the size of the network.

Results\nThe simulation results produced in this study highlight\nthe effect of increasing the number of nodes and injection\nrates for different NoC topologies on network performance.\nThe results quantify the normalised and raw latency, and\nthroughput versus injection rate for a 2-D mesh, 3-D 7-port\nmesh, and a 3-D 6-port mesh with vertical bus connectivity\nfor localized and uniform traffic. Figures 5(a), (b) and (c)\nare plots of normalized latency, throughput and raw latency,\nrespectively, versus network size for injection rates rang-\ning from 0.1 to 0.9 in a 2-D mesh. Figure 5(d) is a plot of\nthroughput versus injection rate for different network sizes.\nThese localized 2-D simulations show that as network size\nincreases, the normalized latency quickly reaches a satu-\nration point whereas the throughput matches the injection\nrate for stable input conditions. For injection rates of 0.1\nto 0.4, once the size has increased beyond 225 nodes, scal-\ning the network size up to 1024 nodes incurs no significant\nperformance penalty in terms of latency or throughput due\nto the localized traffic pattern. Figure 5(d) shows that the\n2-D network investigated in this study fails to match injec-\ntion rate with throughput above 0.5 packets per node per\ncycle; i.e. the network becomes congested and unstable.\nThe instability of injection rates above 0.5 was confirmed\nby an examination of the transmitter output buffers from\neach resource, where the network becomes unstable when\nthe buffer fills to capacity.

Where the 2-D network becomes\ncongested at an injection rate of 0.5 as the number of nodes\ngrows, the 3-D 7-port maintains throughput and a constant\nlatency for all network sizes. The increased number of links\nper node in the 7-port 3-D design allows the network to re-\nmain stable for a wider range of network sizes and injection\nrates. This topology manages to match throughput to injec-\ntion rate up to 0.6 packets per node per cycle. This result is\ninteresting as it demonstrates the capability of a 3-D 7-port\nmesh to handle higher injection rates than a 2-D mesh for\na given number of nodes. The plot in 6(a) however shows\nthat the average normalized latency increases sharply with\ninjection rates beyond 0.6 as the packets spend more time\nin output buffers at their origin resource due to congestion.\nFigure 6(d) is interesting because it correlates the injection\nrate to the throughput per node per cycle directly, so the\nsaturation point for each network size can be determined.\nThis understanding is paramount to designers as it deter-\nmines the boundary conditions for maximum performance\nfor different sized networks.\nFigures 7(a), (b) and (c) plot the average latency,\nthroughput, and raw latency against network size, respec-\ntively for the 3-D mesh network with the vertical bus. The\n3-D bus has a markedly worse performance in comparison\nwith the 7-port 3-D topology and the 2-D mesh. Figure\n7(a), shows that the average normalized latency values are\nlower than the corresponding values for both the 2-D and\n3-D cases when the network has a lower injection rate.\nThis is largely due to the bus only requiring 1 hop for a\npacket to reach its destination on any vertical layer.

URT Performance\n7(b) begins to drop for injection rates of 0.2 and above for\nany network size greater than 3x3x3. This is due to pack-\nets being deflected horizontally around the network, as con-\ntention for the vertical bus link increases with the number\nof layers. This effect increases as the network size grows\nas the number of users requesting access to the bus grows\nin proportion to the number of layers. Finally Figure 7(d)\nclearly shows that the bus struggles to match throughput to\ninjection rates of over 0.3. The local traffic model is not\nfriendly to the bus topology either, as the advantage the bus\nprovides in sending a packet in one vertical hop to any layer\nis not fully utilized. Although the bus appears to be the\nworst of the three architectures under localized conditions,\nit may have advantages in other traffic conditions, such as\nwhen a stack of memory lies above a processor, where the\nbus will provide equal access time to any layer of memory.\nThe results in Figure 8(a), (b) and (c) relate to the uniform\nrandom traffic model showing plots of the average normal-\nized latency, raw latency and normalized throughput versus\nincreasing network size respectively based on the injection\nrate given in Table 1 for each network size . Figure 8(a)\nshows that the bus has the lowest latency and that a con-\nventional 2-D network has the highest, with the 3-D 7-port\nlying in-between. Figure 8(c) plots the ratio of the network\nthroughput per node per cycle over the injection rates given\nin Table 1 versus the number of nodes. This shows that the\n3-D 7-port switch behaves reasonably similar to the local-\nized pattern in that it reaches a saturation point quickly for\nthroughput and further increases in network size add little\nperformance penalty. However the 2-D mesh and 3-D bus\narchitectures are the worst for this traffic pattern. They both\nhave decreasing throughput with increasing network size.\nIn the 2-D case, the packet must travel over a long distance,\nand the network easily becomes congested. The bus again\nsuffers from the reduced link bandwidth per node when it\nhas to deal with traffic patterns with injection rates greater\nthan 0.1. However, different from the local traffic simu-\nlations, the bus has outperformed the 2-D mesh in terms\nof throughput and latency. The uniform random traffic al-\nlows the bus to utilize its ability to transport a packet any\ndistance in just one hop, and this shows through in these\nresults. These figures appear to highlight that under uni-\nform random patterns, the 7-port switch is the best option\nfor large sized networks in terms of packet throughput, but\ntrade offs such as area overhead and power may render the\nbus a viable alternative, especially when the vertical links\nare limited, and a scarce resource.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nThis paper has explored the scalability of two different\nbufferless 3-D NoC topologies in an effort to develop design\nguidelines for future development of massively integrated\nSoC devices. The cycle accurate simulation results pre-\nsented clearly show the saturation points and performance\nin terms of latency and throughput of the different topolo-\ngies as the number of nodes and layers in a 2-D and 3-D\nmesh network is increased. This is paramount for design-\ners in determining the best balance between the number of\nfeatures on a chip and the required communication perfor-\nmance. The results indicated that the 3-D 7-port switch is\nthe best performer in terms of throughput and normalized\nlatency as the number of nodes in a network is increased. It\nhas the highest link per node ratio and thus the most band-\nwidth between the three designs. However, we have shown\nthat a 2-D NoCwith localized architecture can be scaled to a\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The TDMA vertical bus design was shown\nto perform the worst out of the three communication archi-\ntectures in terms of scalability under local traffic, as it is\nphysically limited by its raw bandwidth due to a smaller\nlinks per node ratio and contention issues as the number of\nlayers increase. Although it can transfer packets through\nmany layers in one hop, it struggles to handle the increased\nrequests and congestion as the network grows. Although\nshown to be weak in this paper, the bus may be appropriate\nfor hot spot traffic injection where many packets may need\nto be sent through several layers to a hot spot frequently.\nThis may be akin to a processor on one layer, and a mem-\nory stack directly above it. The URT traffic pattern again\nhighlights the 7-port switch\u2019s superior bandwidth capabil-\nity. Of the three architectures, the 3-D 7-port switch is the\nonly one that manages to gain throughput as network size\nincreases.\nWe aim to build on these preliminary results and carry\nout further investigations into different traffic patterns,\nswitch architectures, and communication protocols to quan-\ntify the performance differences in the various network\ntopologies under more traffic patterns as well as the physical\nconstraints imposed by the horizontal and vertical intercon-\nnections.\n7.
