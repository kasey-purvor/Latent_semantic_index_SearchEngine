The \u2018Regional Climate\nChange Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West England\u2019 (RegIS) study\ndeveloped a methodology for stakeholder-led, regional climate change impact assessment that\nexplicitly evaluated local and regional (sub-national) scale impacts and adaptation options, and cross-\n2sectoral interactions between four major sectors driving landscape change (agriculture, biodiversity,\ncoasts and floodplains and water resources). The \u2018Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response\u2019 (DPSIR)\napproach provided a structure for linking the modelling and scenario techniques. A 5 km x 5 km grid\nwas chosen for numerical modelling input (climate and socio-economic scenarios) and output, as a\ncompromise between the climate scenario resolution (10km x 10km) and the detailed spatial\nresolution output desired by stakeholders. Fundamental methodological issues have been raised by\nRegIS which reflect the difficulty of multi-sectoral modelling studies at local scales. In particular, the\nrole of scenarios, error propagation in linked models, model validity, transparency and transportability\nas well as the use of integrated assessment to evaluate adaptation options to climate change are\nexamined. Integrated assessments will provide new insights which will compliment those derived by\nmore detailed sectoral assessments.\n[Word count = 199. Maximum allowed = 200 words]\n1. Introduction\nThere is growing acceptance that the climate is changing due to human emissions of greenhouse gases\n(IPCC 2001a). Such changes in climate will affect all sectors of society at different scales, ranging\nfrom the global to the local. It is also recognised that significant socio-economic and political\nchanges will also continue to occur (IPCC, 1996; Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000) and the impact of\nclimate change needs to be evaluated in a holistic assessment of the effects of our changing future.\nResearch strategies have been reported on the impacts of climate change on specific sectors (e.g.\nagriculture: Downing et al., 2000; Abler & Shortle, 2000; water: Arnell, 1998; Miles et al. 2000;\nbiodiversity: Sykes and Haxeltine 1998; Leemans 1999; and coastal zones: Nicholls and Mimura,\n1998; Nicholls, 2002a). These have generally involved the development, and application, of impact\nmodels to scenarios of climate change, to understand the sensitivity of specific sectors to variations in\nclimate. Other possible (non-climate) changes have often not been considered. However, addressing\npolicy questions requires integrated analysis, including the effects of all change factors, the\ninteractions between sectors and an evaluation of adaptation options for individual stakeholders at the\nlocal and regional scale (Cash and Moser, 2000). This is because the actual impacts of climate change\nlocally or regionally will be the product of multiple interacting systems. This requires the paradigm\nof climate change impacts\u2019 assessment to shift in focus:\n\uf0b7 from presenting potential (usually worst-case) impacts to analysing different adaptation options\n(e.g. Johnston & Chiotti, 2000; Downing et al., 1997); and\n3\uf0b7 from sectoral concerns to integrated assessments of landscapes and economies (e.g. Handmer et\nal., 1999; Smit et al., 2001; Fisher, 2000).\nIntegrated assessment (IA) has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as\n\u201can interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets, and communicates knowledge from diverse\nscientific disciplines from the natural and social sciences to investigate and understand causal\nrelationships within and between complicated systems\u201d (IPCC, 2001b). It is axiomatic that there are\ntwo main principles to integrated assessment: (1) integration over a range of relevant disciplines; and\n(2) the provision of new information about how complex real-world systems might behave that\nenables decision making (Harremoes and Turner, 2001). Importantly, cross-sectoral implications that\nmight be missed in more traditional assessments can be explicitly explored in ways that are\nmeaningful to relevant stakeholders. Although there are papers describing the theory of integrated\nassessment (for example Jones, 2001; Harremoes & Turner, 2001; Warren, 2002), there are few\nstudies which describe the results of such an assessment at the regional (sub-national) scale (e.g.;\nRosenberg 1993, Yarnal, 1998; Yohe et al. 1999, 2002, Fisher, 2000; Strzepek et al. 2001) as opposed\nto the supra-national and global scales (e.g. Dowlatabadi, 1995; Nordhaus and Yang, 1996; Alcamo et\nal., 1998; Parry et al., 1999; Tyson et al. 2001; Matsuoka et al., 2001; Toth, 2003).\nThis paper describes the first such local to regional (sub-national) scale study in the UK - \u2018Regional\nClimate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West England\u2019 (RegIS)\n(Holman and Loveland, 2001; Holman et al., 2001). RegIS aimed to develop a research methodology\nfor stakeholder-led, regional climate change impact assessment that explicitly evaluated local and\nregional scale impacts and adaptation options, and cross-sectoral interactions between the major\nsectors driving landscape change. Stakeholders had previously raised concerns about environmental\nchange impacts on agriculture, biodiversity, coasts and floodplains and water resources in the study\nareas (Science and Policy Associates & ESYS, 1996). These \u2018sectors\u2019 formed, therefore, the basis for\nthe RegIS integrated assessment. The emphasis of this paper is on (1) the integrated methodology that\nwas developed to deliver a fine resolution multi-sectoral assessment and (2) the lessons learned about\nconducting local and regional (sub-national) scale integrated assessment with regionally-specific\nsocio-economic and climate scenarios and linked sectoral models. The results of the assessment are\npresented in Part II (Holman et al. Submitted).\n2. Methodology\nThe development of the RegIS integrated assessment methodology (IAM) was guided by a number of\nfundamental principles. Firstly, the methodology should be transportable to other areas. Although\n4two contrasting regions were studied which provided good \u2018test-beds\u2019 for the diversity of the\nproblems and approaches to be examined, a generic framework for linking knowledge was needed.\nSecondly, stakeholders should be involved throughout the study contributing to the design and use of\nthe IAM through an Interactive Integrated Assessment Process (IIAP) (Warren, 2002). This\ninteraction and feedback ensures the acceptability and applicability of IAM in the policy arena and\nmaximises the usefulness of IA. Stakeholder representation should encompass national (NGOs,\nprivate sector and central government), regional (NGOs, regional bodies, councils, lobby groups) and\nlocal (individuals, local authorities, local companies and NGOs) levels (Shackley & Deanwood,\n2002). Thirdly, a modelling scale was needed that balanced the detailed spatial resolution desired by\nstakeholders against data and model run-time constraints that result from an integrated, multi-sectoral\nmodelling approach. Finally, a modular approach should be used that builds upon existing impact\nmodels, where available.\n2.1 Stakeholder involvement\nA fundamental objective of RegIS was to involve stakeholders throughout the study, from inception,\nthrough design, implementation and management, to the delivery of the project results. This was\nachieved in a number of ways:\n\uf0b7 The sectors studied in RegIS (agriculture, biodiversity, coast and floodplains and water resources)\nwere dictated by earlier stakeholder analysis (Science and Policy Associates & ESYS, 1996), and\nwere not chosen by the research team. The domains of impact were therefore not dictated by the\ntools available to the research team, but rather the research team was chosen to deliver the desired\ntools;\n\uf0b7 A stakeholder group (United Kingdom Water Industries Research- UKWIR, representing the\nwater supply and wastewater treatment utilities) part-funded the project;\n\uf0b7 The project was undertaken under the auspices of the United Kingdom Climate Impacts\nProgramme (UKCIP) who provide support and guidance for climate impacts research for both\nstakeholders and researchers, so providing a bridge between the researchers and the decision-\nmakers in government organisations and business;\n\uf0b7 The project was guided by the RegIS Steering Committee which included representatives of\nnational Government, the Environment Agency (national environmental regulator), English\nNature (ecological conservation Government Agency), UKWIR and UKCIP;\n\uf0b7 Within the pre-defined domains of impact, three regional workshops involving about 100\nparticipants (as described in Shackley and Deanwood 2002) were used to engage the stakeholders\nin the design of the integrated assessment modelling, by providing their priority questions and\nproblems for the scientific team to address, and by identifying possible response mechanisms;\n5\uf0b7 The regionalization of the national socio-economic storylines were undertaken through an\niterative process with local and regional stakeholders using individual interviews (about 35) and\nthe three regional workshops;\n\uf0b7 Stakeholders were involved in the development and critique of the spatial quantitative pressures\neither directly (through face-to-face discussion) or indirectly (through the incorporation of\npublished consultative plans such as regional strategies, structure plans and shoreline management\nplans);\n\uf0b7 Regional and national stakeholders (conservation agencies and NGOs) were actively involved in\nthe selection of target habitats and the species modelled;\n\uf0b7 Non-technical workshops were held to review preliminary proposals for major milestones such as\nthe IA framework;\n\uf0b7 A technical workshop for stakeholders was held at the end of the project to discuss the project\nresults and to reflect on the lessons learnt;\n\uf0b7 A non-technical summary report of the outputs of the project was published to aid wider\ndissemination of the project results (Holman et al., 2001);\n\uf0b7 The project results were widely presented at stakeholder events (in addition to academic\nconferences) both within the regions and nationally.\n2.2 The generic framework\nThe assessment framework was based on the \u2018Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response\u2019 (DPSIR)\napproach (Figure 1) proposed by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development\n(1993) and used extensively by the European Environment Agency (1998) and the UK Environment\nAgency. The DPSIR framework allowed the RegIS methodology to be built around a consistent\nstructure of linked assessments (Peirce, 1998), that facilitates the use of the approach in other regions.\nThe components of the DPSIR analytical framework were used to define the various stages of the RegIS\nmethodology:\nD: Drivers are the underlying exogenous (to the region) causes of environmental change, e.g.\nclimate and socio-economic change, national and international (EU) policy.\n\u2022 Methodological approach = identify and describe (qualitative narratives or storylines) national\nand international scenarios of change, which are linked to the pressure variables and indicators used\nfor model input.\nP: Pressures are the endogenous (to the region) variables that quantify the drivers, e.g.\ntemperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide concentrations and extreme climatic events for climate\n6change; and population, GDP, regional development, national and EU subsidies, environmental and\nregulatory policies for socio-economic change.\n\u2022 Methodological approach = develop regional, quantitative scenarios of climate and socio-\neconomic change; estimate confidence in assumptions and quantification.\nS: States are the variables (indicators) that represent the sensitivity of the system\/sector to the\npressure variables, e.g. river flows, land use areas, species suitability.\n\u2022 Methodological approach = identify critical indicators for sectoral impacts and cross-sectoral\ninteractions with stakeholders; identify sensitivity of impacts and interactions using historic\nanalogues, e.g. previous droughts, changes in crop subsidies, increases in housing stock.\nI: Impacts are a measure of whether the state variables have reached a certain value (represented\nby thresholds, classes, etc.), which has a negative or positive effect on individuals, society and\/or\nbiological resources, e.g. minimum levels of river flows, acceptable farm profit, minimum species\nrichness, etc.\n\u2022 Methodological approach = develop an integrated database; adapt existing models; draw upon\nexpert knowledge; integrate models and expert knowledge across sectors with consistent linkages;\ndevelop indicator thresholds.\nR: Responses are the planned (societal level) adaptation options that aim to minimise negative\nimpacts (or maximise positive impacts \/ benefits)\n\u2022 Methodological approach = identify adaptation options with stakeholders; evaluate options\nwith linked models and expert knowledge.\nThe RegIS methodology is illustrated in Figure 2. The drivers and pressures were defined in terms of\nscenarios of environmental change, integrating both climate and socio-economic change. State\nvariables, and impacts were assessed using a range of coupled, sectoral models. The linkages\nbetween the different sectoral components are described later. The results of these models were\nevaluated in terms of potential policy responses based on stakeholder dialogue within the context of\nthe socio-economic scenario assumptions.\nAlthough the DPSIR framework is based on a sequential approach, elements within an integrated\nsystem can play multiple roles within the framework. For example, changes in crop and land use\ndistribution may represent an \u2018impact\u2019 for the agricultural community, but may also be a \u2018pressure\u2019 on\nwater resources and biodiversity. In working within the DPSIR framework, therefore, the RegIS\nintegrated methodology follows a quasi-sequential approach to the flow and interpretation of\ninformation.\n72.2 The case study regions and the modelling scale\nTwo contrasting regions were studied (Figure 3): East Anglia with its relatively dry climate (average\nannual rainfall = 550 - 750 mm), low-lying topography and intensive agriculture, and the North West\nwith a wet climate (average annual rainfall = 650 - 3200 mm), uplands dominated by extensive\ngrazing and urbanised lowlands. RegIS sought to accommodate the heterogeneity of the study regions\nby applying a spatially-explicit modelling approach. In order to achieve this, and to accommodate the\nflow of information between different sectoral models, a common representation of geographic space\nwas required.\nA detailed spatial resolution (of the order 1km x 1km) was desired by stakeholders. However, certain\ntypes of input data (for example, observed species distributions, standards of protection for flood\ndefences) were not available at such detailed resolution. Further, the most up-to-date climate scenarios\n(described below) available from the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) were\nprovided at a resolution of 10km x 10km. These scenarios were generated by interpolating GCM-\nscale changes to a finer resolution using a standard spatial filter and then adding these interpolated\nchanges to observed mean monthly climatologies. This approach is termed \u2018unintelligent\ndownscaling\u2019 (Hulme & Jenkins 1998) because it adds no new meteorological insight beyond the\nGCM-based changes into the interpolation procedure, and hence implicitly limits the credibility of\nmuch further downscaling. Thus, as a compromise, a geographic grid of 5 km x 5 km was chosen for\nboth data input and, where appropriate, model output except for the hydrological modelling where\ncatchments and water resource units were also used. This ensured that stakeholders were presented\nwith information that was of sufficient detail for use in regional decision support, whilst limiting\nmisuse or over-interpretation of model results as very local scales.\n2.3 Input Scenarios\n2.3.1 Climate scenarios\nThe study applied climate change scenarios developed on behalf of the United Kingdom Climate\nImpacts Programme (UKCIP), known as the UKCIP98 scenarios (Hulme and Jenkins, 1998). These\nscenarios are based on two transient experiments undertaken at the UK Hadley Centre for Climate\nPrediction and Research using the HadCM2 GCM (Johns et al., 1997; Mitchell and Johns, 1997). The\ntwo experiments are GGa (1% p.a. increase in greenhouse gases \u2013 approximates to the IS92a\nemissions scenario) and GGd (0.5% p.a. increase in greenhouse gases \u2013 approximates to the IS92d\n8emissions scenario). The IS92 emissions scenarios (Leggett et al. 1992) were used by the Hadley\nCentre as the UKCIP98 scenarios rely largely on one set of GCM experiments completed during 1995\nand 1996 (Hulme & Jenkins 1998), prior to the development of the SRES (Nakicenovic & Swart\n2000) scenarios.\nFour scenarios were constructed from the two HadCM2 experiments to reflect uncertainties in future\nglobal warming rates attributable to different climate sensitivities and greenhouse gas emissions\nscenarios: Low, Medium-low, Medium-high and High. The Medium-low and Medium-high scenarios\nwere based directly on the GGd and GGa experiments, respectively. The Low scenario was based on\nscaling the GGd experiment with a low climate sensitivity (1.5oC), whilst the High scenario was based\non scaling the GGa experiment with a high climate sensitivity of 4.5oC. Probabilities can not be\nattached to the four scenarios, rather the Medium-low and Medium-high scenarios can be considered\nas equally likely and the Low and High scenarios may be seen as capturing part of the tails of the\ndistribution of possible climate outcomes for the UK (Hulme and Jenkins, 1998). Each scenario has\nbeen constructed for three time periods (the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s) based on an average of 30 years\nof data at a 10 km x 10 km spatial resolution. Data for each 10 km x 10 km grid square were\ntranslated into the desired 5 km x 5 km spatial resolution using the altitude adjustments presented in\nSmith (1976). The long-term monthly means in each grid square were downscaled to daily time series\nof 30 years of weather data by perturbing observed daily weather station data by the UKCIP98 change\nfields, thereby ensuring that the generated sequences, correlations and extremes are plausible.\n2.3.2 Socio-economic scenarios\nThe widespread practice of studying the impacts of future climate changes as if they were imposed in\ntoday\u2019s society may be acceptable for near-term assessments but grows increasingly unacceptable as\nthe time horizon lengthens (Parson and Granger Morgan, 2001; Arnell et al., 2004). The future world\nwill be very different from now even in the absence of climate change because of socio-economic and\npolitical changes. Scenarios, which should contain everything that shapes a society (Tol 1998), aim to\nbe coherent, internally consistent and plausible descriptions of these possible future states which can\nbe used to inform future trends, potential decisions or consequences (Carter et al., 1994; Parry and\nCarter, 1998). However, our lack of fundamental understanding of the processes determining socio-\neconomic change dictates that multiple scenarios representing a plausible range of alternative futures\nare needed, to explicitly acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in such projections.\nThe development of plausible socio-economic scenarios to couple with climate scenarios, which\ninclude enough regional detail and explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties but avoid the\ncombinatorial explosion of crossing many independent uncertainties, is one of the central\nmethodological difficulties of integrated regional impact assessment. Such scenarios help to open up\n9the uncertainty of the decision making context to scrutiny by stakeholders and policy makers, yet they\ngreatly limit the exploration of uncertainty to a discrete (usually small) number of possibilities.\nWhilst pragmatic considerations dictate such constrained uncertainty, it is important that the heuristics\nemployed are transparent.\nIn a regional study, particularly one in which contrasting regions are being studied, international\n(Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000) and national (UKCIP, 2001)-scale socio-economic scenarios cannot\nbe used directly, but have to be modified such that they discriminate between and within regions. The\nRegIS socio-economic scenarios used the framework (Figure 4) of Berkhout et al. (2002) as a starting\npoint which had been adopted for the UKCIP national socio-economic scenarios (UKCIP 2001). This\nscenario framework segments the future \u2018possibility space\u2019 into four quadrants that are defined by\naxes of social and political \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018governance\u2019 and the capacity of institutions at different\nlevels to manage change, but which in turn had been adapted from the IPCC\u2019s SRES framework. The\nrelationship between the national (UKCIP) and regional (RegIS) socio-economic scenarios mirrors to\nsome extent the two-tracked approach of centralised and decentralised scenario development used in\nthe US National Assessment (Parsons and Granger Morgan 2001). The socio-economic scenarios had\ntwo distinct roles in RegIS, which were to provide the context (storylines) for interpreting the results\nof the numerical modelling and to provide quantitative inputs to the land use, coastal and floodplain\nand hydrology models.\nThe regional socio-economic scenarios developed in RegIS (Shackley & Deanwood, 2003) were\nderived from an iterative procedure between researchers and stakeholders with interests in the sectors\nunder consideration at national, regional and local levels. In accordance with the preferences of the\nRegIS funders and the UKCIP, formally independent socio-economic scenarios were developed, also\nreferred to as \u2018non-climate change\u2019 scenarios, as they do not permit interaction between climate and\nsocio-economic changes, such as occurs in co-evolutionary socio-economic scenarios (Lorenzoni et\nal., 2000). The development of non-climate change scenarios demands an approach which attempts to\nembrace complex societal and economic change and uses these as indicators of plausible future states.\nThus they do not emerge directly from current practises per se, rather they abstract particular forces\nfor change, differentiating and extrapolating them.\nThe regional descriptive storylines of alternative futures are broadly similar to the related national\n(Berkhout et al. 2002) and global narratives (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000; Arnell et al., 2004). In\naddition to the aforementioned sources, the construction of the RegIS scenarios drew upon three\nregional workshops involving approximately 100 regional and sub-regional stakeholders from the\npublic, private and voluntary sectors, existing medium-term plans (structure plans, regional planning\nguidance and regional economic strategies), and numerous face-to-face meetings with key regional\n10\nstakeholders. Each storyline provided a general contextual description and a more detailed\nelaboration of the regional economy, society and environment.\nThese qualitative storylines had to be further developed so as to provide the inputs to sectoral models,\nwhich require quantitative, regionally-specific data for those variables which are dependent upon\nfuture socio-economic change and policy dimensions. It was necessary, therefore, to derive a range of\nnumerical parameters based on the input requirements of the RegIS sectoral models (Table 1; Figure\n5). Some of these parameters do not vary in space across a region, (e.g. prices for agricultural goods),\nwhereas others are strongly driven by location characteristics (e.g. population, land use planning) and\nso were allocated values that varied spatially. However, the lack of parameter ranges provided by the\nnational scenarios (for example, for population, household numbers etc.) within the constrained\nuncertainty of the segmented futures, prevented the explicit quantification of judgements about\nuncertainty. A detailed description of the derivation of the spatial variables for urbanization and non-\nspatial variables for agriculture is given by Shackley and Deanwood (2003).\n2.3.3 Scenario linkage\nOne of the difficulties in integrated assessment is the large number of scenario combinations (of\nclimate and socio-economic change) which are possible between regions, time-slices and storylines,\nand the significant run-time constraints associated with integrated models. Therefore, RegIS\ndeveloped two contrasting regional scenarios that coupled assumptions about changes in socio-\neconomic futures to climate change following Lorenzoni et al. (2000) and Rounsevell (2000). The\nclimate and socio-economic change scenarios were linked through their associated carbon dioxide\nemission assumptions, to generate futures in which the degree of socio-economic development was\nbroadly consistent with the climate change.\nThe chosen contrasting futures for the modelling were:\n\uf0b7 A Regional Enterprise socio-economic scenario (equivalent to IPCC A2) linked with the\nUKCIP98 High climate scenario (constructed from the HadCM2 GGa experiment scaled to the\nIS92a emissions scenario and a high climate sensitivity of 4.5\u00b0C);\n\uf0b7 A Global Sustainability socio-economic scenario (equivalent to IPCC B1) linked with the\nUKCIP98 Low climate scenario (constructed from the HadCM2 GGd experiment scaled to the\nIS92d emissions scenario and a low climate sensitivity of 1.5\u00b0C).\nThe former represents a high climate change scenario combined with the socio-economic scenario\nwhich is likely to impose the highest socio-economic pressure upon water, agriculture, coastal \/\nfloodplain area and biodiversity. As the socio-economic scenarios contain no element of the climate\n11\nchange scenarios, this provides an extreme case of a society that does not respond to the threat of\nclimate change over the next 50 years, i.e. an 'adverse case\u2019 analysis.\nThe lowest climate change scenario is combined with the socio-economic scenario which brings with\nit the lowest pressure upon water, biodiversity, agriculture and coastal\/flood plain areas, i.e. a \u2018better\ncase\u2019 analysis with respect to pressures upon environmental systems and associated impacts. The\nselection of these scenario combinations (in the context of resource constraints) was agreed upon with\nthe active participation of the stakeholders.\nIn addition, the linked models were run for the two climate change scenarios with baseline socio-\neconomics to assess the relative importance of climate change compared with socio-economic change.\nThe 2050s time slice was chosen for the integrated assessment, because of the limited changes\nassociated with the 2020s time slice (within both climate and socio-economic scenarios) and because\nof issues of credibility associated with deriving detailed socio-economic scenarios for as far ahead as\nthe 2080s.\nIt is acknowledged that the linking of the climate and socio-economic change scenarios through their\nassociated carbon dioxide emission assumptions to create internally consistent futures is subjective.\nThe socio-economic change scenarios embody local practices whilst the climate scenarios reflect\nglobal emissions, which in turn can arise from multiple disparate socio-economic states throughout\nthe globe. However, the underlying intention was to develop two contrasting regional futures which,\nby being internally consistent, did not contain explicit inconsistencies which would render the\nsubsequent analyses suspect in the eyes of some stakeholders.\n2.4 Sectoral impact models\n2.4.1 Coasts and floodplains\nThe coastal and river flooding analysis combined a series of algorithms (Nicholls and Wilson, 2001;\nNicholls, 2002b) to assess the impact of: sea-level rise on coastal flooding and hence the agricultural\nsector; increased river flooding on the agricultural sector; and sea level rise on coastal habitats.\nThe effect of sea level rise on tide-surge heights was estimated by adding the UKCIP98 sea level rise\nprojections to the water levels of specific return periods. However, the scenarios provide no data for\nother climatic factors such as storminess. No sign of a significant increase in storminess over North-\nWest Europe was detected from an analysis of long-term observational sea level data sets (Bijl et al.\n1999). The weak changes in storm activity and (extreme) wave heights in the northeast Atlantic and\n12\nNorth Sea and a weak increase in storm surges in the southern and eastern part of the North Sea\nsimulated with CO2 doubling by Carretero et al. (1998) fall well within the limits of variability\nobserved in the past. According to Senior et al. (2002), the confidence in all AOGCM results for\nstorminess is limited by poor spatial resolution in global coupled models and by uncertainties in the\nphysical processes in both global and regional models, and is specific to the climate change scenario\nused. An analysis of climate indices derived from HadCM2 output by Hulme & Jenkins (1998)\nsuggests that although overall winter gale frequency may decline under the Medium-High scenario in\nthe future, very severe winter gales increase. However, the changing direction of change between the\n2020s, 2050s and 2080s indicates that a clear anthropogenic signal in severe gale frequencies is not\neasily detectable in model output from the noise of natural climate variability. On this basis, these\nother factors were therefore assumed to remain constant.\nCoastal flood plains where the future standard of defence (i.e. risk of flooding) will be at, or below, a\nspecified level were identified from national data sets, such as the Sea Defence Survey and the\nIndicative Flood Plain Maps. Based upon an analysis of observations of farmers\u2019 behaviour and the\nopinions of agricultural advisors, it is suggested that there are specific thresholds of flooding\nfrequency at which different types of farming activity are abandoned (Morris, 2003). Flood plains\nwith a future defence standard of less than 1 in 10 years were therefore assumed to be unsuitable for\narable farming within the agricultural sector modelling, while those with a future defence standard of\nless than 1 in 1 year were assumed to be unsuitable for both arable and pastoral farming.\nThe fluvial flood risk assessment assumed a spatially uniform increase in the 1 in 100 year flood flows\nof 5 % and 20 % for the 2050s Low and High scenarios, respectively, following the model results of\nReynard et al. (2001). However, due to a lack of readily available data on either the location or the\nstandard of fluvial defences the present risk of flooding was estimated by using Indicative Standards\nof Protection for Fluvial Defences (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1999) and the actual\nland use (arable, pastoral or semi-natural). For example, it would be expected that, according to\nMAFF (1999), high density urban areas prone to flooding would have flood defences installed which\nhave a capacity to protect the area from a 1 in 100 year (or 1% probability) flood event, whilst low\nproductivity agricultural land with few properties at risk would only be protected to withstand a 1 in 1\nyear flood event.\nCoastal lowlands are particularly vulnerable to flooding, as there is the potential interaction of higher\npeak river flows, higher sea levels and (usually) localised subsidence. In the coastal lowlands such as\nthe Norfolk Broads, the Lancashire coastal plain, and most particularly the Fens, land drainage and\nsubsequent consolidation, oxidation and loss of peat has produced substantial declines in land\nelevation. This is illustrated by the 4 m decline in land levels at Holme Fen Post in the Fens since the\n13\n1851. Today, most of the Fens lie at elevations below high tide levels and some areas are below mean\nsea level. In these agriculturally productive areas, the low river gradients allow the tidal influence to\nextend far inland, whilst the straightening and embankment of the channels has reduced the flood\nstorage capacity. The combined effects of increased peak river flows flowing at a higher base level\ndue to sea-level rise was considered in coastal lowlands such as the Fens in East Anglia.\nThe change in flood risk suggests significant impacts on the built environment, although this was not\nexplicitly addressed in RegIS due to resource constraints. However, region-wide estimates of the\norder-of-magnitude effect of climate change on flood damages were derived by applying the average\nchange in flood risk associated with the climate change scenarios to estimates of the present level of\ndamages (Halcrow Maritime et al., 2000). The limitations of these calculations are that:\n\uf0b7 It is assumed that the increase in flood risk due to climate change simply results in more of\nthe same floods, rather than more extreme events;\n\uf0b7 No allowance is made for the increased depth and extent of flooding under climate change,\nwhich will increase the losses;\n\uf0b7 Some properties that presently sustain flood damage might be abandoned under climate\nchange scenarios, which might reduce the losses due to flooding;\n\uf0b7 Uniform changes are being assumed across both regions, and the more severe impacts\ndescribed for coastal lowlands such as the Fens are not resolved;\n\uf0b7 The basic results are based on different assumptions in different regions and should be treated\nwith caution (Halcrow Maritime et al., 2000).\nThe effect of sea level rise on two coastal habitats was analysed: salt marsh and coastal grazing\nmarsh. Salt marsh losses at the morphological scale were predicted on the basis of their ability to\nmaintain elevation relative to sea-level rise, estimated as a function of the rate of sea level rise, tidal\nrange and changing sediment supply (Nicholls and Wilson, 2001). Landward migration of these\nhabitats is presently prevented in most locations by coastal flood defences, but coastal management\npolicy is investigating large-scale managed realignment of these defences in the coming decades\n(French, 2001). Therefore, areas of the coastal flood plain with very low development density were\nconsidered, depending upon the socio-economic scenario, as potential sites for planned managed\nrealignment, and consequent intertidal habitat creation. The habitat gain was sub-divided between\nnon-vegetated mudflat and salt marsh. Salt marsh gains associated with managed retreat are often at\nthe expense of coastal grazing marsh. The likelihood of unplanned habitat creation was also\nconsidered.\n14\n2.4.1 Agricultural sector modelling\nAn attempt to assess agricultural land use change needs to explicitly incorporate descriptions of the\ngoals and constraints that affect farmers and their management strategies. Farmers are operating\nwithin a broadly similar economic environment (at the regional scale) but, subject to their own\npreferences, opinions and experiences, they are faced with considerable differences in the physical\ncharacteristics of the landscape, such as soil types and climates.\nAssessments for the agriculture sector were therefore based on a spatially distributed model of\nagricultural land use that integrates an approach to the optimisation of farm level cropping decisions\n(SFRAMOD: Annetts & Audsley 2002) with a crop growth model (ACCESS: Rounsevell et al.,\n1996). The approach is described in detail in Rounsevell et al. (2003). ACCESS simulates the yield\nresponse of the major arable and grass crops to the biophysical environment in each grid square (soils,\nclimate and CO2). Crops include permanent crops such as grazing, perennial crops such as forage,\nannual crops such as wheat, rape and set-aside, \u2018novel\u2019 crops such as sunflowers and soya, and catch\ncrops. It provides output on the crop dry matter yield each year, crop maturity date, nitrogen applied\nto the crop and, for irrigated crops, the yield with different levels of irrigation applied to the crop.\nThe farm level model selects the optimum steady-state farm system according to a series of\nconstraints with an objective that is a weighted sum of the profit and a measure of risk. Constraints\narise from timeliness penalties (which reduce the yield of a crop if, for example, it is planted late due\nto restricted workable hours or labour capacity) and rotational penalties (which reduce the yield of one\ncrop following another, for example wheat after wheat relative to wheat after oilseed rape, due to pest\nand disease incidence).\nGeneric farms within SFARMMOD optimise their long term farm cropping plan on each soil type\nwithin each grid cell by maximising farm profit, in response to changes in the profitability\/feasibility\nof enterprises and soil workability brought about by changes in climate and \/ or socio-economics.\nSFARMOD assumes that a generic model farm is representative of the sum of the cropping plans on\nthat soil within its grid cell. The primary decision variable in the farm level model are the crop gross\nmargins, but these are indirectly affected by subsidies (socio-economic scenario), nutrient inputs\n(inputs are increased pro-rata with yield to account for increased offtake) and restrictions (socio-\neconomic scenario), rotational and operations restrictions (resulting from soil-climate interactions and\nlabour and machinery restrictions). The results are the areas of each crop and the profitable level of\nirrigation. The farm changes indicated by these results could be, for example, a new crop type such as\nsoya, or a change of farming type such as rough grazing to intensive grass to arable.\n15\n2.4.3 Water resources modelling\nThe distributed semi-empirical SWANCATCH (Surface WAter Nitrate CATCHment) model\n(Holman et al, 2001), developed from the SWATCATCH model (Hollis & Brown, 1996; Brown et al\n2002), was used to simulate naturalised (i.e. without the effect of human water abstraction and\neffluent returns) surface and gross groundwater resources and weekly river flows and nitrate\nconcentrations. Nitrate was chosen to be modelled because of its important direct links to policy (e.g.\nthe Nitrate Directive 91\/676\/EEC) and land management. SWANCATCH routes the hydrologically\neffective rainfall (that proportion of the rainfall which is able to runoff or recharge an underlying\ngroundwater store) and leached nitrate through each soil type in a catchment directly to surface water\nor via a groundwater store, according to the hydrological pathways described by the Hydrology Of\nSoil Types (HOST) system (Boorman et al, 1995). The model does not estimate recharge of a \u2019real\u2019\naquifer, but rather recharge of a groundwater store, from which groundwater can support river flows\nand, where an aquifer is present, abstraction.\nAfter simulating each sub-catchment or catchment in isolation, to determine the water and solute\ninputs from its directly contributing area, the inputs from upstream catchments are added together. In-\nriver denitrification processes, linked to temperature, residence time and flow characteristics (Holman\net al, 2001), are included.\nNaturalised (i.e. without the effect of human water abstraction and effluent returns) surface and gross\ngroundwater resources were simulated for a number of reasons. Firstly, the starting point for\ndecisions on current and future surface water abstraction licencing in England are based upon\nnaturalized flows, in order that abstractions are not permitted on the basis of effluent returns to a\ncatchment which might cease in the future due to sewerage network changes etc. Secondly, there are\nlarge scale local and regional water supply networks in both regions which transport abstracted\nsurface water or groundwater from one catchment or groundwater management unit to another, or\nwhich allow water to be imported or exported from the region. Similarly sewerage networks move\nwastewater and stormwater between catchments. The spatial and temporal behaviour of these\nnetworks within the regions are confidential and cannot be readily incorporated within catchment\nscale models. Thirdly, water abstraction locations and the licence agreements attached to them\nchange due to water quality or quantity problems and policy changes, so that the future spatial\ndistribution of abstraction sites cannot be predicted. However, an attempt is made to combine the\nregional results of the naturalized simulations with the implications of regional development and\npopulation within the socio-economic scenarios.\n16\n2.4.4 Biodiversity modelling\nImpacts on the distribution of suitable future climate space for semi-natural species were simulated\nusing the SPECIES (Spatial Estimator of the Climate Impacts on the Envelope of Species) model\n(Pearson et al, 2002). The model uses an artificial neural network to integrate bioclimatic variables for\npredicting the distribution of species through the characterisation of bioclimatic envelopes. A number\nof integrated algorithms, including a climate-hydrological process model, are used to pre-process\nclimate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed) and soils\n(available water holding capacity) data to derive relevant bioclimatic variables for input to the neural\nnetwork. Those variables found to be most successful for simulating bird distributions and the\ndistributions of other taxa are described in Harrison et al. (2003) and Berry et al. (2003), respectively.\nSPECIES is trained using existing empirical data on the European distributions of species to enable\nthe full climate space of a species to be characterised and to capture their response to climatic\nconditions that might be expected under future scenarios. A kriging interpolation function is applied\nto the presence\/absence distributions of each species to provide a smoothed suitability surface. The\ndata are then randomly divided into three groups for training, validating and testing the neural\nnetwork. The validation set ensures that the network does not over-train on the training data, thus\nlosing its ability to generalise, while the test data is used to independently verify the prediction. The\nKappa statistic of similarity (k), a commonly used statistic that provides a measure of proportional\naccuracy adjusted for chance agreement, was used to assess the predictive performance of each\nnetwork (Cohen, 1960).\nOnce a network is trained, validated and tested at the European scale, it can then be used to produce a\nmap of the simulated distribution for baseline (1961-90) climate and to estimate the potential re-\ndistribution of a species under alternative climate change scenarios at a finer 5km x 5km spatial\nresolution in Great Britain. The model does not simulate the dispersal ability of a species and hence\ncannot simulate actual distributions.\nSPECIES was applied to a range of dominant, sensitive and threatened species in habitats which\ninteract with agriculture, water and coastal zones in the two case study regions (Table 2). The\nselection of both habitats and species was undertaken in conjunction with regional stakeholders.\n2.5 Model integration\n17\nFigure 2 gives an overview of the modelling framework and the relationships between the different\nsectoral components. Within this framework a number of points of integration were developed\nbetween the sectoral models. These are detailed below:\n1. Relevant spatial and non-spatial data, such as the climate change and socio-economic scenarios\nand baseline data, that were common to the different sectoral models were stored within a\ngeographic information system (GIS);\n2. Using data from the GIS, the coastal and river flooding models defined areas that were not\nsuitable for pastoral and\/or arable agriculture, and changes in coastal habitat areas;\n3. The output from the coastal and river flooding models together with the areas of non-agricultural\nland use (urban and woodland) derived within the socio-economic scenarios were used to identify\nthe land area available to agriculture. Physical restrictions, based on slope and soil thickness\n(stored within the GIS) and policy restrictions on land management, such as Nitrate Vulnerable\nZones (given within the scenarios) were also used to limit agricultural crop and management\nchoices. A final distribution of agricultural land use was determined by incorporating these spatial\nrestrictions with climate, soil and economic data within the agricultural models;\n4. The agricultural models provided outputs of hydrologically effective rainfall, nitrate-nitrogen\navailable for leaching and the long term nitrate-nitrogen leached for input to the water resources\nmodelling. Combined with average weekly temperature and spatial and attribute soil data for each\ncatchment, the hydrological model simulated gross groundwater resource, river flows and nitrate\nconcentrations;\n5. The biodiversity model used data from the GIS to determine the potential distribution of species\nfor selected habitats. These potential distributions were limited by changes in coastal habitats for\nsalt marsh and coastal grazing marsh species (from the coastal modelling), changes in agricultural\nland use and management for upland hay meadows, lowland heathland and cereal field margin\nspecies (from the agricultural modelling), and changes in water quality and quantity for blanket\nand raised bog and the Fen species (from the water resources modelling).\n4 Discussion of the methodology\nIntegrated assessments are increasingly important to both the scientific and policy-making community\nbecause of the need to understand complex systems and process interactions across a range of scales\nand sectors. The RegIS study has raised some fundamental methodological issues that reflect the\ngeneral difficulties of multi-sectoral modelling studies. As the focus of this paper is the integrated\nassessment methodology for a regional climate impact study, the discussion is restricted to\nmethodological lessons and issues. In particular, we examine the role of scenarios, error propagation\nin linked models, model validity, transparency and transportability as well as the use of integrated\n18\nassessment to evaluate adaptation options to climate change. Results of the analysis are discussed in\nPart II (Holman et al. Submitted).\n4.1 Scenarios\nScenarios are an integral part of the DPSIR framework and climate impact assessment (Leemans\n1999) and are widely used by the scientific and policy-making communities. Although scenario\ndevelopment is an imperfect \u2018science\u2019 (Parson & Granger Morgan, 2000 p4), few alternatives exist in\nexploring unknown futures. One of the principal limitations of scenarios results from feedbacks\nacross scale boundaries in complex systems. An example of this in RegIS is the effect of changing\nland use areas on agricultural prices: increasing the local supply of an individual crop may result in\nlower prices dependent upon market demand and supply. These types of dynamic cross-scale\nprocesses cannot be readily dealt with in a satisfactory way using a regional scenario approach, and\nalternative approaches (e.g. Cash and Moser, 2000) that can operate across scales such as hierarchy\ntheory or nested scenarios and models that operate at different scales may be needed (Easterling,\n1997). For example, some studies have attempted to model the price change feedback that results\nfrom agricultural land use change using global scenarios and a model of macro (global) economics\nthat simulates the changes that occur in every other region of the world (e.g. Parry et al., 1996;\nAlcamo et al., 1996; Conway et al., 1996). The limitation of these studies, however, is that the\nrepresentation of global-scale processes is not always adequate (due to the complexity and variety of\nthe world) and there is a loss of regional specification (Toth, 2003) and detail that is the aim of a\n\u2018regional study\u2019 (Easterling, 1997) such as RegIS. There are clear conflicts, therefore, in the ability to\nmodel all the processes that are important for a region, at the regional scale. This ultimately may be a\nfundamental limitation of a stand-alone regional approach, such as RegIS where the predetermined\ngeographical area and constrained time and resources limited investigation of cross scale issues and\nprocesses in sufficient depth.\nAt a pragmatic level, there are fundamental difficulties in the construction of regional (sub-national)\nsocio-economic scenarios, as identified by Parson et al. (2003). The development of scenarios, and in\nparticular the stakeholder engagement and dialogue process, is time consuming. The time and\nresources required to develop the level of spatial dissaggregation required by distributed models and\nby stakeholders, such as depicted within the downscaled RegIS socio-economic scenarios, should not\nbe under-estimated. Although they are only illustrative and deliberately intended to demonstrate the\npotential for divergent futures and associated changes, the speculative (but necessarily precise given\nthe need for quantification) nature of the downscaled scenarios means they are contentious and\ninevitably subject to some disagreement. As suggested by Parson et al. (2003), significant time\n19\nresources are specifically required to convey the meaning, basis and limits of the scenarios. In\naddition, the level of spatial detail can render them, in the eyes of some local stakeholders, as\nunacceptable portrayals of future development. For example, the Regional Enterprise scenario for\nEast Anglia contained significant urban development along the North Norfolk coast due to a desire to\nhave second homes in this affluent scenario within this scenically attractive area. However, it was\nconsidered by a number of stakeholders that this would not be allowed to happen under any\ncircumstances. If we had shown the \u2018same\u2019 scenario (in terms of overall numbers of new homes\nwithin the region) at a lower level of spatial resolution, such strong opposition is less likely to have\nemerged. What is an appropriate level of spatial detail in a scenario to facilitate informed dialogue,\nwhilst avoiding instantaneous rejection, will depend upon the stakeholder and the specific context,\ne.g. the institutional history surrounding resource management and development of a particular locale.\nFurthermore, it was necessary to develop an additional \u2018Planners\u2019 Scenario\u2019 for urbanization based on\ndiscussions with planning officers in the two regions who felt that the RegIS socio-economic\nscenarios were \u2018extremes\u2019 between which the future would lie, and that the scenario projections for\n2050 did not relate well to the changes envisaged within the Planners 15 year cycle of the structural\nplanning process. The \u2018Planners\u2019 Scenario\u2019 is effectively a \u2018preferred\u2019 scenario on the part of regional\nplanners, given the context of current trends and changes ('dynamics as usual'). The scenario was\nbased on the reinforcement of current trends for housing commitments within pre-existing regional\nplanning guidance and economic strategies. These commitments are location specific but are not\nnecessarily a guide to the future type of permitted development (in terms of density for example) or\nthe extent of future development. Such misconceptions of the role of scenarios can prolong the\nstakeholder dialogue process needed to develop agreement, or can indeed prevent agreement.\nNeverthessless, unlike in some other studies (e.g Parson et al., 2003), RegIS has demonstrated that the\ndevelopment of such quantified local scenarios, and their use in numerical impact models can be\nsuccessful.\n4.2 The capacity of models to represent complex systems\nRegional climate impact assessments will always be dependent on the models that are the basic\nbuilding blocks of such studies. The need for regional assessments to produce more detailed output,\ncompared to global assessments, requires that the models used are better able to deal with and portray\nspatial and temporal variability. Whilst alternative methodologies exist to examine the impacts of\nclimate change on some landscape processes (e.g. physical experiments or using analogue regions e.g.\nBerry et al., 2001), mathematical models will remain a central methodology in exploring unknown\nfutures.\n20\nIt is very important, however, to recognise the true value and limitations of models, which should not\nbe viewed as tools for \u2018predicting\u2019 the future within global change studies. They are, at a fundamental\nlevel, experiments that can be used to test our perceptions of how the future might evolve. The\nlinking of quantified socio-economic scenarios with numerical modelling in RegIS highlighted this\nimportant distinction between making predictions from [uncertain] futures and exploring the future. It\nis at this level of testing our perceptions of how the future might evolve that such models fulfil both\nthe needs of stakeholders for guidance as to future change and also the basic needs of scientific\nresearch to develop, test and revise hypotheses, where the model is a formal characterisation of those\nhypotheses. Therefore, models, like hypotheses, are dynamic and evolve in response to the improving\nunderstanding of a system.\nTo tackle the spatial complexity of the environment and the range of processes operating within this\nenvironment requires a suite of different modelling approaches. A model that is appropriate for the\ndescription of physical processes will not necessarily be appropriate for processes of human decision-\nmaking. The RegIS modelling methodology was based on a range of contrasting modelling techniques\n(expert judgement, statistical approaches, optimisation models and process-based models) and\ntimesteps (daily, weekly and long-term average). This use of multiple modelling techniques is a\nstrength of the RegIS methodology and not a weakness.\nIt is evident that the success of regional studies is a function of the capacity of models to represent\nmulti-sectoral, regional-scale processes. Can existing models adequately represent current conditions\nand future changes at a regional scale? The answer to this question from the RegIS experience seems\ninevitably to be partly (supporting the results of Lambin et al., 2000). Such models can always be\nimproved upon, but it is clear that the technical advancement of integrating models also requires the\npractical experiences gained from projects such as RegIS. An important challenge for any regional\nintegrated assessment is the integration of these different approaches and temporal resolutions into a\ncommon modelling framework and within a consistent modelling paradigm. The RegIS project has\ndemonstrated that successful integration requires that the complexity should be in the level of\nintegration rather than the sectoral processes, which can be represented by simplified sectoral models\n(i.e. meta-models) to facilitate the multiple model runs needed for IA. Such models may not be \u2018state-\nof-the-art\u2019, but integrated within an IAM they will provide new insights and possible future\ndevelopments that sectoral models cannot provide.\n4.3 Error propagation\n21\nThe dependency of integrated assessments on the linkage of models and the flow of numerical\ninformation between different sectoral models engenders integrated assessments with the potential for\nsignificant error propagation. Validation of an integrated assessment methodology as a whole is not\npossible, as the requisite data are not usually available (Dowlatabadi, 1995). Such error propagation\ncan potentially create unexpected anomalies in the results from a part of the regional system that\noccurs at the end of the chain of data exchange which will only partly be addressed by ensuring that\nimpact models are calibrated and validated within the integrated assessment methodology\n(Dowlatabadi, 1995), rather than independently outside of it.\nBecause of the large number of individual simulations performed within a single IA, due to the\ncombinations of climate, soil and land use, it is feasible that the Law of Large Numbers would prevent\nsignificant error propagation within the linked models. This mathematical theorem states that in\nrepeated, independent trials with the same probability of success in each trial, the chance that the\npercentage of successes differs from the probability by more than a fixed positive amount converges\nto zero as the number of trials goes to infinity. So whilst in a small sample the actual results may vary\nconsiderably from predicted results, as the samples increases to infinity the calculated probability\nbecomes extremely accurate. However, although the chance of a large difference between the\npercentage of successes and the chance of success gets smaller and smaller as n grows, nothing\nprevents the difference from being large in some sequences of trials. So in a regional study in which\noutputs are being presented spatially at a sub-regional scale, as in RegIS, it is quite feasible in some\nareas for the simulations to diverge due to error propagation. The Law of Large Numbers will only\nlimit error propagation in a regional IA if there are many simulations (for example, if the unit of\nsimulation is much smaller than the region or if stochastic modelling is employed) but the results are\naggregated up to a scale that provides the large number.\nWithin the reported study, the hydrological results are very important in terms of the mechanisms of\nthe linked modelling framework, because the sector is at the end of the flow of quantitative\ninformation (starting from the socio-economic and climate scenarios, through the coastal and river\nflooding modelling and finally through the land use modelling). The output of summed drainage and\nrunoff from the crop growth model, area-weighted by the results of the farm model form the principle\ninput to the hydrological model. A statistical analysis of the differences between the hydrological\nresults from the scenarios and the baseline, in comparison with the results from the other models was\nperformed to assess any significant problems with error propagation.\nTwo statistical tests were performed to examine the changes in model output associated with the\nscenarios. These were a paired t-test, which computes the difference between each grid square of the\ncompared scenarios and tests if the average differs significantly from 0, and the Pearson correlation\n22\ncoefficient which is a measure of the degree of association between the distributions of the values\nbeing compared. The paired t-test is a test on the regional means that compares the different scenarios\nin a global way, whilst the Pearson correlation coefficients, which vary between \u20131 and +1, indicate\neither negative or positive linear relationships, respectively. A value of 0 indicates that neither of the\ntwo scenarios can be predicted from the other using a linear equation. A value of 1 indicates a perfect\nmatch.\nThe Pearson correlation coefficients between the scenarios for the hydrological variables were always\nvery high (near to 1.0) even though there are often statistically significant differences between the\nscenarios at the level of the regional means (i.e. the t-tests). This suggests that the pattern of the\nspatial changes in the hydrological variables that occur between the scenarios are either constant or\nare a function of the original baseline values. This is in contrast to the results for the land use model.\nThe implication of this observation is that the hydrological results are more firmly dependent on the\n(unchanging) landscape characteristics of the regions, than are the land use results. Thus, in general\nterms it seems that the hydrological model is more sensitive to the physical properties of the\nlandscape (consistent with Boorman et al., 1995) and to the climatic change (as also reported by\nEvans & Schreider, 2002) and relatively less sensitive to the socio-economic-induced land use\nchanges (urbanization, woodland creation, agricultural change), in comparison with the land use\nmodel which is most sensitive to the socio-economic scenarios. Whilst it is not possible to draw\ndefinite conclusions from this observation, it would seem reasonable to suggest that error propagation\n(i.e. resulting from the land use change inputs) has not unduly affected the hydrological results. In\nfuture studies, more attention needs to be given to understanding error propagation in linked\nmodelling systems. This will require the development of IAM\u2019s which allow many more simulations\nthan were possible in RegIS. Once error propagation in linked modelling systems is better\nunderstood, the resulting implications for output uncertainty need to be effectively communicated to\nthe relevant stakeholders.\n4.4 Model transparency and transportability\nAs discussed, the study of complex systems often gives rise to the construction of complex models.\nThe benefit of integrating models to describe complex systems is that a much wider range of\nprocesses and process interactions can be considered, including effects and impacts of interacting\nmultiple pressures which are difficult to analyse in any other way. This inevitably means, however,\nthat it is difficult to identify a single factor that creates a certain result: in many cases several\ninteracting processes will have contributed to the same result. The lack of a clear link between cause\nand effect in such complex modelling systems introduces the problem of transparency in\n23\nunderstanding the model results. For example, if there is a change in the water resources of one\ncatchment compared to another, stakeholders expect that it should be possible to determine the cause.\nWas it due to a shift in production of a crop on sandy soils, which was associated with a change in the\nsubsidy or a change in the autumn cultivation period, or some combination of factors? In order for the\nresults of IA\u2019s to be credible to stakeholders it is fundamental that the IAM is constructed in such a\nway that (multiple) cause and effect relationships can be identified, and ensuing results from the IA\nexplained. This will inevitably require a modelling system which allows the user to interact with, and\nexplore, the system through many simulations.\nThis point of transparency being a precursor for credibility in the eyes of stakeholders is also relevant\nto the construction and application of scenarios. The climate change scenarios used in RegIS are\nmuch less transparent to stakeholders than the regional socio-economic scenarios, due to their\nunderpinning assumptions and the complex nature of GCM\u2019s. The socio-economic assumptions that\nform the basis of the SRES emissions scenarios refer to the global scale and large-scale regions of the\nworld, e.g. N America, China, Africa, etc, and make no reference to national or sub-national\ndifferences or heterogeneity. There is therefore no apparent direct link between the socio-economic\nfutures at the scale of stakeholder interests and the scale of the futures associated with the emissions\nscenarios. Although the linking of socio-economic scenarios (RegIS regional socio-economic\nscenarios within UKCIP national economic scenario within SRES international scenarios) used within\nRegIS helped to provide a coherent framework for increasing resolution, it does not provide a means\nto place the region within the global context of the emissions scenario.\nFurthermore, the translation of emissions into variables of climate change is based on the use of\ncomplex models of the global climate system (GCMs), the mechanisms of which are not open to\nunderstanding by a non-expert. It is not possible for a non-expert to understand the quantitative link\nbetween carbon dioxide emissions and regional climate change and to make an objective assessment\nof the risks of climate change, due to the opaque workings of GCM\u2019s and the multiple effects of\naerosols, dust particles, oceanic circulations and thermal stores etc. They are required to subjectively\naccept (or not) the model predictions.\nConversely, the regional socio-economic scenarios in the RegIS study are transparent, in that the\nassumptions underpinning the description and quantification of each storyline are explicit. The model\nresults can be viewed, therefore, in light of these assumptions. In order to increase the transparency\nof the RegIS outputs further, the scenarios applied in the RegIS study were based not only on\nintegrated (internally-consistent) visions of the future, but also on the disaggregation of these\nscenarios into their constituent climate and socio-economic parts. Compared to modelling studies\nusing a 'co-evolutionary' scenario approach, this has allowed a comparison of the relative sensitivity\n24\nof the key impacts to variation in climate and socio-economic conditions, and to interactions between\nthem (as recommended by Parson et al. 2003).\n4.5 Adaptation issues\nThe final stage of the DPSIR framework that has guided the RegIS analysis is the \u2018response\u2019 to\nenvironmental impacts. Response refers to the capacity of people and societies to adapt to specific\nchanges in the state of a system. In terms of the IPCC guidelines for climate impact assessment\n(Carter et al., 1994; Parry and Carter, 1998) these adaptation responses are of two general types:\nautonomous adaptation (e.g. the spontaneous responses and decisions of natural systems, individuals\nand organisations to change their day-to-day actions or management in response to changing\ncircumstances) and policy implementation (e.g. the political decision to regulate against an adverse\noutcome or to support certain development pathways).\nThe RegIS methodology directly addresses both of these forms of adaptation. Autonomous\nadaptation is implicit to several of the sectoral models and thus, is included directly in the model\noutputs in response to the different scenarios. For example, the model of changing land use is based\non farmer decisions, and how these decisions will have changed, given new set of climatic and\ntechno-economic conditions. The model of species\u2019 distributions indicates how an organism will\nneed to disperse in response to its changing environment. In each of these cases, however, RegIS has\nidentified the need to determine whether the proposed autonomous adaptation options are possible in\npractice, but has not been able to model the actual response. So does the need for capital investment\ncreate a barrier to land use change? Can individual species disperse from their current to potential new\ndistributions sufficiently rapidly?\nNo adaptation options were explicitly modelled in the present RegIS modelling. However RegIS did\nexamine the consequences of the different socio-economic scenarios that were based on alternative\nvisions of future socio-economic and policy pathways. In particular the two selected socio-economic\nstorylines (Regional Enterprise and Global Sustainability) incorporate very different roles for the\nscope and influence of policy upon the key drivers and pressures which results in socio-economic\nchange and its subsequent influence upon the management of natural resources as shown in Table 3.\nHence, the policy maker can compare the influence of climate change upon natural resources arising\nfrom a governance framework that is more focused upon a conventional growth paradigm with one\nthat is more focused upon achieving sustainable development globally.\n25\nIn future studies, more attention is being given to evaluating stakeholder-selected policy choices in an\niterative and interactive manner, and to explicitly include adaptation to climate change within the\nsocio-economic scenarios. The potential effectiveness of adaptation options to climate change could\nthen be gauged through direct comparison with results from the baseline socio-economic scenario\nwith the climate change scenarios.\n4.6 Next Steps\nThe key lesson learnt from RegIS was that credibility of the results of the IA in the eyes of\nstakeholders was limited by the lack of model simulations. This arose from the complexity of the\nsectoral models and resulted in a lack of transparency regarding explanations of the relative\nimportance of multiple stresses to the results, and the limited means of assessing uncertainty.\nAlthough the RegIS project was successful in demonstrating the importance of cross-sectoral impacts,\nthe wider use of the methodology by the stakeholder community has been hindered by the complexity\nof the models used. Although the development of the methodology was stakeholder-led, the\napplication of the methodology was not. The RegIS methodology remained as a scientific, rather than\nan interactive framework.\nFollowing a review of the RegIS project at a UKCIP-hosted technical workshop for stakeholders, the\nneed to simplify the modelling component to enable greater model linkage, feedbacks, model runs and\nstakeholder interaction was identified. A follow-on project (RegIS2) seeks to address these needs.\nRegIS2 is developing, with stakeholders, the use of computationally simpler and faster modelling\ntechniques, so called \u2018meta-models\u2019, within a robust user friendly interface to make the RegIS\nmethodology available to the wider stakeholder community. Stakeholders are working with the\nresearchers to identify and assess key regional issues, risks, uncertainties and potential responses, as\nrecommended by Parson et al. (2003).\n5 Conclusions\nThe \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West\nEngland\u2019 (RegIS) is the first regional integrated assessment study in the UK. RegIS has developed a\nresearch methodology for stakeholder-led, regional climate change impact assessment which serves\nthe desires of a diverse range of policy makers and stakeholders in the UK for assessments of the\npotential local impacts of global change. It focuses on the major sectors driving landscape change\n(agriculture, biodiversity, coastal and river zones and water resources) about which stakeholders had\n26\npreviously raised concerns and produced policy-relevant information that can be used at regional and\nlocal scales.\nIntegrated assessments are needed to understand these complex systems, including process\ninteractions across a range of scales and sectors. Thus, integrated assessments will provide new\ninsights which will compliment those derived by more detailed sectoral assessments. Fundamental\nmethodological issues have been raised by RegIS which reflect the difficulty of multi-sectoral\nmodelling studies at local scales. In particular, the role of scenarios, error propagation in linked\nmodels, model validity, transparency and transportability as well as the use of integrated assessment\nto evaluate adaptation options to climate change are examined. RegIS has demonstrated that,\nalthough there is the risk that the development of local socio-economic determinands of particular\nimpacts at the local scale is a highly complex and potentially indefensibly arbitrary exercise (Parson et\nal. 2003), the continual effort of stakeholder engagement can render sufficient credibility to the\nresulting scenarios to provide far more defensible results than implicitly or explicitly assuming that\nthe present socio-economic conditions will continue unchanged.\nThere is no doubt that the scientific community has in recent years made considerable progress in\nadvancing integrated assessment methodologies, but it is also clear that a lot still has to be learnt. The\nvalue, therefore, in studies such as RegIS is the understanding that can be generated from the model\nexperiments and it is this understanding that future regional studies should seek to advance.\n6 Acknowledgements\nRegIS was funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Project No. CC0337)\nand the UK Water Industries Research within the UK Climate Impacts Programme.
