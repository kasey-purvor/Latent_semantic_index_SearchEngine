It is argued that there are fundamental \nand distinguishing aspects of youth work practice in terms of relationships, partnerships, \nand time which enable youth workers to undertake successful interventions with groups \nof young people who are defined as \u2018socially excluded\u2019. However, the demands of \ngovernment policy in relation to targeting and accountability are in tension with practice in \nthese key areas. Without a clearly articulated and specific language of youth work \npractice, the very aspects of youth work which make it attractive to policy makers are in \ndanger of being undermined by policy. \n \nKey words \n Youth work, professional accountability, targeting, youth exclusion, JRF.  \n \n \nThe advent of the Connexions service for young people  (DfEE, 2000) stimulated an altogether \nunfamiliar experience for youth work, moving it from the margins towards the centre of youth \npolicy.  The significance of youth work to the achievement of \u2018the vision\u2019 of the Connexions \npartnerships was articulated in Transforming Youth Work: Developing Youth Services for Young \nPeople (DfEE, 2001). This was followed by Transforming Youth Work: Resourcing Excellent \nYouth Services  (DfES, 2002). In the later document (REYS), extra and secure resources were \npromised to secure a high quality contribution from youth work to the delivery of services for \nyoung people.   \n \nThere are indications of waning enthusiasm for Connexions (Holmes, 2004). Its incorporation with \nyouth work into the terms of the new Children Bill (2004) (DfES, 2003) suggests a shifting of \nattention from \u2018youth\u2019 to \u2018child\u2019 concerns (Editorial, 2004:2). Nevertheless, youth work practice \ncontinues to be systematically refashioned in accordance with the Transforming Youth Work \n(TYW) initiative (Barrett, 2004:7) and youth services are experiencing a tightening of their criteria \nof accountability devolved from central government.   \n \nInsofar as the terms of reference for reconfigured Youth Services derive directly from the policy \nintentions of Connexions, then youth workers are constrained in their practice by the conceptual \nperspectives informing Connexions.  Thus although TYW takes recognisable youth work \nconcerns as its key themes, (eg. participation, citizenship, curriculum), it mobilises these \nconcepts to set targets and specify outcomes which are related to, but do not derive from youth \nwork itself. Rather they derive from the discourse which informs contemporary political decision \nmaking in relation to \u2018youth\u2019 and to public services.    \n 2 \n \nConceived as a \u2018youth support service\u2019 (Davies, 2000; Wylie, 2004), Connexions rests upon ideas \nabout youth as transition (Irwin, 1995). TYW is therefore devised to help \u2018young people through \nthe transition from adolescence to adulthood\u2019 and it is claimed that \u2018Government has set in place \na wide range of policies and programmes designed to improve the health and welfare of children \nand young people and to support them in making the transition to adult life\u2019 (DfEE, 2001:5).  \nTransitional theories prescribe incremental \u2018youth development\u2019 approaches for services (Smith \n[M.K], 2003). Thus the role of the Connexions Personal Advisor (PA) is to facilitate smooth \ntransitions for individual young people by responding to their identified problems and issues and \ndirecting them to appropriate complementary services. The success of this building-block \napproach can be evaluated by considering the outcomes achieved at each stage of intervention.  \n \nIn contrast, youth work has traditionally considered youth as a period of \u2018being\u2019 as much as of \n\u2018becoming\u2019 (Davies and Gibson, 1967; Davies, 2000; Jeffs and Smith, 1998\/9). For youth \nworkers, the ideal is to affirm the positive aspects of young people\u2019s collective as well as \nindividual identities, to enable them to better understand their present. From this perspective, they \nencourage constructive and reflective understanding in the here and now (\u2018starting where the \nyoung people are at\u2019) in order to create futures which by definition cannot be pre-planned.  Hence \nthe dominant ethos within youth work is one of \u2018process\u2019 rather than \u2018outcome\u2019. This does not \nmean that outcomes are not achieved, but that they cannot be pre-figured. Traditionally, youth \nwork is holistic and young people are considered in terms of their humanity rather than their \nproblems or \u2018deficits\u2019 (Wylie, 2003:23). Thus there is a conceptual tension for youth work at the \nvery heart of the TYW approach.  \n \nThe transitional \u2018life stage\u2019 approach of \u2018youth\u2019 policy contradicts the political imperative to create \nmore efficient public services through a process of targeting social exclusion. Connexions is \nostensibly a universal service, but from the outset it has been targeted much more intensively \nupon those young people identified as Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) and \nthere are demands that it should be further targeted in this respect. This policy contradiction \ntranslates into further tensions in youth work practice (Bessant, 2004). \n  \nLimited resources mean that youth work is in practice a targeted service, but such targets are \nself-defined. The ideal of universalism remains central to practice. This principle expresses the \ninformal, social educational approach based on voluntary participation. Through a process of \ndialogue and social engagement, youth work programmes are designed to encourage \nassociation, friendship and co-operation between young people who choose to participate. This \nview is dominant within British youth work theory (Davies and Gibson, 1967; Davies, 1999; \n 3 \nYoung, 1999; Jeffs and Smith, 2002). The REYS document pays lip service to universalism whilst \nsimultaneously emphasising a \u2018strategic\u2019 approach. A significant proportion of youth service \nresources must be targeted,  \u2018towards those young people [aged 13-19] where needs are \ngreatest\u2019 and \u2018the target population will include a locally agreed target for those assessed as not \nin education, employment or training (NEET) or who are at risk of, or who already fall into the \nfollowing categories: teenage pregnancy, drugs, alcohol or substance abuse or offending\u2019 (DfES, \n2002:8,10,16).    \n \nProblem-focused targeting and emphasis upon transitions and outcomes create difficulties  which \nare exacerbated by the policy-led approach to partnership central to Connexions. Youth workers \nhave always co-operated with related professions, but this has historically emerged from the \nimperatives of practice rather than policy.  \n \nDespite complaints that their work is \u2018not understood\u2019 and signs of disquiet around the increased \nburden of bureaucracy and management associated with the reforms, conformity is being \nsystematically imposed. Meanwhile, the financial incentives have seduced cash starved youth \nworkers into collusion. REYS has been hailed as the most exciting development since the \nAlbemarle Report provoked the growth period of the 1960s (Smith, [A] 2003). Thus the face of \nyouth work practice is changing.   \n \nThe JRF Research  \nThe emphasis upon targeting socially excluded young people has drawn attention to the potential \nimportance of detached and outreach youth workers who have long claimed privileged access to \nyoung people beyond the grasp of partner services. Because of their \u2018reach\u2019, these youth workers \nwere identified at the outset as especially suitable for undertaking the Connexions Personal \nAdvisor (PA) role in relation to the most problematic young people (DfEE, 2000; 2001).  \n \nIn this context, the  Joseph Rowntree Foundation  commissioned an 18-month research project to \nassess the possibilities of detached and outreach youth work within the new policy environment \n(Crimmens et. al. 2004). The research, undertaken by a team from the universities of Luton, \nLincoln and Durham, surveyed the extent and nature of provision in England and Wales. From an \ninitial \u2018mapping\u2019 exercise, using data from national voluntary organisations and from Local \nAuthority providers, 1,560 projects were identified of whom 564 returned a questionnaire. From \nthese 564, a typology was devised and used to select 31 who participated in telephone \ninterviews. Subsequently, an in-depth participant observational study was undertaken of a \nrepresentative sample of eleven projects from the 31. Finally, a developmental weekend \nworkshop was organised which included two workers from each of the eleven projects. \n 4 \n  \nThe research data suggests that detached and outreach workers consider themselves to be first \nand foremost youth workers. They explain successful work with young people primarily through \nthe philosophy and methods of generic youth work. The type of young people involved, and the \ncontext within which the work is undertaken appear to be secondary factors, even when they are \nfunctioning under the terms of a specific targeted and outcome-led initiative such as the Youth \nInclusion Projects.     \n \nThe findings indicate that there are qualities unique to youth work which enable constructive \nintervention with a range of young people, including those defined as NEET. The research was \nundertaken before Connexions and TYW  were fully established, but there were already signs of \ndiscomfort among the participants about the affect of policy upon their practice.   Significant \nelements of practice were discussed which suggest that adapting youth work to fit policy is not \nquite as straightforward as TYW implies.   \n \nThis article abstracts three related elements of generic youth work practice from the JRF data \nwhich seem particularly at odds with the policy imperatives. The data indicates the particularity of  \nyouth work in respect of relationships, partnerships, and time. It is argued that in these three \nareas there are disjunctures between policy and the realities and ideals of youth work practice. It \nis suggested that youth work is currently experiencing a dangerous moment in which the very \naspects of the work which make it attractive to policy makers could be undermined by policy and \nthat it is therefore urgent that practitioners articulate more clearly the specific nature of their \npractice.   \n \nRelationships \nThat\u2019s the key\u2026 it\u2019s actually going out on their terms and developing real relationships \nwith people and spending time with them (4)\n1\n \n \nThe relationships created between youth workers and young people are wholly voluntary and \nnegotiated (Davies, 2000;  Davies, 2003:8).  Although they inevitably raise questions of power, \nthese relationships are constructed within a value base which stresses justice and equality. \nPower is a matter of professional self-consciousness, to be used always for the advantage of the \nyoung person. In this sense, the ideal relationship eschews the possibility of competition, \ndomination or dependence. It affirms that young people and youth workers engage as equals in \nterms of their common humanity. Thus the personal, subjective and the professional, objective \nelements of the youth work relationship are inextricably interwoven.    \n \n 5 \nIt can never be a simple matter to speak about youth work relationships within a professional \nlanguage because of the inter-personal sub-text.  Of course there have been youth workers who \nhave exploited their professional power to create inappropriate or abusive relationships with \nyoung people.  Others have found it difficult simply to distinguish between the personal and the \nprofessional. This problem, mentioned by some respondents in the JRF research, was noted as a \nfeature of some of the earliest \u2018experimental\u2019 detached projects (Evans, 1974). The subjective, \npersonal elements of the youth work relationship contain significant elements of risk. \nConsequently, there is a tendency to talk about the importance of \u2018relationships\u2019 without \nspecifying what this means in practice.  Often the personal element is simply implied:  \nfor personal skills you don't hide behind a snooker table, or a table tennis table, or \nwhatever. We're out there doing it and young people will soon tell you if you're not doing \na good job (1). \n \nDetached and outreach youth workers are aware that they intrude without invitation and are \nparticularly sensitive to the voluntary participation of the young person. The worker\u2019s sense of self \nis emphasised, but there is no professional legitimation for \u2018self\u2019 in this context. This must be \nprivately managed:  \n \nYou\u2019re in the young people\u2019s place, you\u2019re on their ground and if they don\u2019t want to talk to \nyou they\u2019ll just walk away\u2026So you have to respond or be responsive to that (3). \n \nYou could say the youth workers are infringing on young people's space, because the \nreason the  young people are on the streets is because they don't want to be around \nadults, and that's the debate you go through when you're doing detached work, \u2018do I have \nthe right to be here?\u2019 (2).  \n \nThe sensibilities of detached workers to the risks of \u2018relationships\u2019 which depend upon mutual \ntrust, highlight the importance of their professional commitment to work in the self-identified \ninterests of the young people involved. This cannot be a completely objective process. \u2018Interests\u2019 \nare clarified within the relationship. For example, whilst it might be possible to \u2018target\u2019 young \nwomen  \u2018at risk\u2019 of pregnancy, preventing pregnancy cannot be a pre-determined outcome:   \nAs youth workers we are not going there to stop the pregnancy rate etc. We go with a \npositive approach - to enhance lives. And you don't know until you start working and \nbuilding relationships if the young person has issues \n (Workshop Notes).  \n \n 6 \nThe youth worker must acknowledge complex and diverse perspectives, otherwise the \nauthenticity of the relationship with the young person is undermined (Smith [H.], 2002).  \nAuthenticity implies that youth work cannot be reduced to \u2018delivering a service\u2019. Services and \noutcomes are integral but they are only part of the picture. Practice is an interpretative act in \nwhich flexibility and openness are crucial. There are always aspects of face to face youth work \nwhich are \u2018accidental\u2019, which cannot be controlled, anticipated or planned:  \nThe focus will come from what  happened in that session...For instance,... an issue would \nbe raised \u2026and they would work with a group of young people on whatever the problem \nwould be...It could be crime; it could be careers; it could be relationships; it could be \nanything really....Lack of leisure facilities, \u2026 it could be anything....it could be  'I want to \ndo a trip and I want to go ice-skating. If we got 7 people could we do it'? ...and the \nanswer would be \u2018Yes\u2019 (15) \n \nIn such a process, the REYS demand for accredited outcomes related to a predetermined \nframework or \u2018curriculum\u2019 is inherently problematic for the youth worker (DfES, 2002:11).  Even \nthe less onerous criterion of  \u2018recorded\u2019 outcomes (DfES, 2004) is difficult in the above example. \nIs the outcome to be emphasised as seven people \u2018turning up\u2019 or one young person learning to \nice-skate? This could only be decided with reference to pre-planned criteria and these would \ninterfere with the process of participative engagement. \n \nThe requirement to evaluate, record and count \u2018achievement\u2019 either undermines the possibility for \ndeveloping meaningful relationships, or encourages a degree of \u2018doublespeak\u2019  in recording \noutcomes. One manager in the research suggested that 'creative accounting will be needed in \norder to meet the TYW targets' (Project 23). Another was self-consciously acting as a buffer \nbetween bureaucratic demands and the necessity of protecting youth work on the ground:  \nI know some colleagues who have got very hot under the collar about changes in \nrecording and data collection and have passed that down to part time staff who just \nturned round and said \u2018Well I didn\u2019t come into youth work to do that and sod it, I\u2019m off\u2019... \nAnd I've not done that. So you know if I was Ofsted-ed I might be criticised for some of \nmy paperwork, but I'd rather protect my staff from the worst aspects of that and keep \nthem delivering good quality youth work, even if I  can't prove it, than I would not have \nany staff and the best kept paperwork in the world (9:) \n \nWhilst such efforts to protect the work are well intentioned, they are no substitute for the \npossibility of youth workers confidently describing the nature of practice reality. Unfortunately, \nyouth work is subsumed within professional language which derives from other, more dominant \napproaches \u2013 such as teaching or youth justice, where the required outcomes are more clearly \n 7 \ndefined. This is not a new situation, but it becomes particularly problematic within the partnership \napproaches instigated by Connexions.  \n \n \nPartnerships   \nBauman (2003:xii) argues that \u2018relationships\u2019 have been replaced with \u2018networks\u2019 in contemporary \nsociety.  This insight can illustrate the tensions facing youth workers. Connexions is a model of \nnetworking par excellence. It assumes parity and consensus between connected professions and \nrequires from workers only the skills and knowledge which will facilitate the best outcomes for \n\u2018clients\u2019. \u2018Relationship\u2019 is not appropriate here. The young person\u2019s agenda is relevant but only \nwith reference to the achievement of predetermined outcomes of employment, education, \ntraining, and ultimately, \u2018citizenship\u2019. This framework not only impinges upon the integrity of the \nyouth work relationship but deflects from the possibility of developing inter-professional \napproaches which centre the needs of young people.  \n \nThe JRF research revealed a marked disinclination to refer young people to \u2018connected\u2019 services.  \nYouth workers suggested that services were not adequate (Wylie, 2004) or that inappropriate \nresponses from partners might undermine the trust developed between young person and youth \nworker. (Projects 19, 6). Anxiety is  reinforced when a whole range of inter-related services are \nseeking to evaluate their work in similar terms with similar young people. Other services in the \nnetwork are liable to claim credit for \u2018outcomes\u2019 when the greatest investment has been made \nthrough the processes of relationship-building in youth work (Angel Group, 2004).  \n \nThe principle of partnership working is not problematic (Workshop Notes). However, research \nparticipants believed that successful partnership could only be achieved if the  perspectives and \nprofessionalism of youth work were accorded equal status. That this cannot be assumed is partly \ndue to the ambiguity about professionalism which has characterised youth work for virtually the \nwhole of its history (Davies, 1988), and partly connected with the lack of parity implied by sub-\ndegree status of the professional youth work qualification (Jeffs and Spence, forthcoming). These \nin turn are associated with the difficulties which beset youth workers in communicating the \nmeaning of their practice.  \n \nThe lack of a precise practice language is implicated in the apparent willingness of youth workers \nto take on each and every task related to young people and also in the assumption that youth \nwork can be mobilised in support of, or as an aspect of any other service. The fuzziness of the \nboundaries of youth work leads to expectations which are frequently inappropriate and which \nworkers on the ground are then forced to manage.   \n 8 \nWhen you\u2019re working with people it\u2019s about making sure that everyone knows what you\u2019re \ndoing and what your limitations are. We can\u2019t wave a magic wand and these young \npeople will disappear\u2026We can\u2019t say to young people \u2018yeah, it will be OK, don\u2019t worry, \nwe\u2019ll sort your housing out and your benefits and everything will be OK\u2019 because that\u2019s \nnot true either\u2026 T he main issues are making sure young people know what you\u2019re \ncapable of doing and what you\u2019re able to do and that\u2026you do have limitations. I think \nmaking sure the community know that you haven\u2019t got a magic wand, and that other \nprofessionals know that you can\u2019t do everything, because when you are out there \u2013 and \nthey say \u2018Yeah, but you can talk to young people out on the streets. How can you do \nthat? You must be able to do this, this and this\u2019, and you think, \u2026 that\u2019s just not it (15). \n \nIt is indicative that the worker quoted here was able to say what the work was not, and to assert \nthe need for \u2018limitations\u2019 but gave no positive outline of what the work is. A profession without its \nown language is particularly vulnerable in a climate of tight political and institutional control of \npolicy objectives and efficiency drives tied to targeted funding arrangements. It is therefore \nperhaps unsurprising that the current fate of youth work is to be colonised by a range of initiatives \nwhich all seem relevant to its self conception, but which constantly fail to acknowledge its central \nmotors.   \n \nTo accept that the relationships which youth workers develop with young people cannot be \nobjectively evaluated, would be to trust them as professionals. This would underwrite equality of \nstatus within professional networks. However, the impetus of policy is moving in the opposite \ndirection. There is demand for increased numbers of youth workers, as semi- professionals \nwhose function is being defined instrumentally as delivering a set of outcomes which have been \nset entirely without reference to the niceties of process.  This situation becomes self- perpetuating \nas youth workers conform to inappropriate evaluation regimes. \n \nYouth Work Time   \nIf youth workers were to assert the realities of their practice achievements, they might seem \nsuperficially very little. This may be one of the impediments to the development of an explicit \nlanguage of professional practice. Because of the construction of \u2018youth\u2019 as \u2018problem\u2019, anxieties \nabout \u2018relationships\u2019, problems with funding and the realities of their own low status, youth \nworkers have tended to exaggerate the short term achievements of their work. This situation is \nunlikely to be improved by the current stress upon achieving targets and measuring outcomes.  \n \nWylie (2004:27) argues that: \u2018 In a youth population of 10,000 it is surely not unreasonable to \nexpect that 450 might hope to get some form of accredited outcome\u2019.  This may be so. However, \nrelationship-based youth work does not measure success in these terms. Accreditation is an \n 9 \nachievement, but it is only the end point of a process of engagement. In the short term, real \nachievements can seem microscopically unimportant. For example, many youth workers speak of \nthe importance of  encouraging a young person to make eye contact (Redfearn, 2003:12).  It took \none research participant over six months to achieve this with one young woman (Workshop \nNotes). Youth workers must move at a pace appropriate to young people:  \nI did a cooking project with a group of young men and  I had to bring them back to the \nbuilding for that, but it still took me six weeks to build up their confidence in order to bring \nthem into the building (13). \n \nFor the worker in this situation, the primary short term outcome is having brought the young \npeople to use the building. However, it is more likely that the cooking skills will be accredited and \nrecorded. Such distortion is not merely a question of external assessment of the value of practice, \nbut also of the youth worker\u2019s self confidence regarding what is \u2018objectively\u2019 important.  The \nopportunity to evaluate through \u2018recorded\u2019 outcomes (DfES, 2004) might enable workers to \nidentify what is meaningful in their own terms, but only if  they are confident that achievements \nwhich can seem everyday and mundane actually carry weight.  \n \nYouth work outcomes can be somewhat intangible in the short term but workers are unsure about \nhow to affirm the long term impact of their interventions. Retrospective accounts suggest that \nyouth work has an effect which achieves fruition in adulthood (Montagu, 1954; Rose, 1998; Smith \n[H] 2002). However, until there is longitudinal research evidence to support anecdotal accounts, it \nremains difficult to make the case. Current accounting procedures add nothing to this area of \nunderstanding.  \n \nWorking in more appropriate time frames would acknowledge the labour-intensive nature of youth \nwork practice. In one project observed during the JRF research, a part time worker  walked \naround the neighbourhood and called into two homes. He talked to a fifteen year old girl excluded \nfrom school as she watched TV, and listened to her mother worrying about another child. He \nhelped a grandmother complete a form applying for help towards Christmas presents for the five \ngrandchildren for whom she was sole carer, whilst discussing with a grandson the reasons why \nhe had set off the fire alarm at school during the fire-fighters\u2019 strike. Meanwhile, the boy\u2019s mother, \na heroin addict, sought his advice about benefits. Later, he gathered a group of young people \ntogether for a \u2018deejaying\u2019  session in a local community centre. After this, he took a particularly \nisolated young man whose mother had a mental illness, to a boxing club and \u2018partnered\u2019 the \nyoung man in the exercises (Project 8). Such richness of practice is not easily contained within \norganisations which are narrowly targeted and evaluated according to short term outcomes.    \n \n 10 \nYouth work, particularly detached and outreach, is time-expensive. Workers often find themselves \nspread too thinly, with expectations far in excess of their capacity.  \nYou were moving around from area to area on a relatively often basis but  working with \nyoung people in an outreach situation needs  sustained, long term work\u2026you need time \nto actually engage the young people, get their trust and actually get to know them, what \nmakes them tick and actually alter, or try and influence, their behaviour and activities, and \nyou don\u2019t do that by sort of jumping around from area to area. You\u2019ve got to work in one \narea, concentrate on that area and try to make a difference in that area (17).  \n  \n \nWhat these workers found most objectionable is what they called the \u2018fire-fighting approach\u2019: \nSometimes we will get a phone \u2018there\u2019s young people out here causing problems and \ncome and sort them out. Move them on\u2019, and that's what they want, they want to move \nthem from A to B. We do it, but it\u2019s not a way I think you can work successfully with young \npeople and their communities, because it doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere. And I do \nstress that we are not the fire brigade, you know, you can\u2019t call us out and we put out the \nfire (15). \n \nSuccessful interventions require patient, sustained and long term work not only with targeted \nyoung people, but also with others who are part of the landscape of their  lives:  \u2018I see it as a long-\nterm process, and the needs of the communities I've worked in, in the past, need a long-term \ncommitment in order to start addressing the need\u2019 (6). This demands a more generous and open-\nended arrangement for the scope of intervention.   \n \nConclusion \nThere is potential for youth work to make a significant contribution to the lives of young people. \nHowever, the policy framework pursued by government tends to credit its secondary rather than \nits primary achievements.  Policy expectations do not necessarily run counter to the goals of \nyouth work intervention and many youth workers are in sympathy with the need to offer sound \nadvice, structured support and specialist help to young people who are in need. However, there \nare crucial aspects of practice which lie behind the possibility of achieving such outcomes and \nthese are relational rather than instrumental. Accounting for the quality of influence within a series \nof relationships with individuals and groups of young people in their social context does not sit \neasily with a requirement to record outcomes and achieve accredited results for targeted groups.  \n \nSuccessful youth work practice involves risk. There is risk in the personal elements of the \nrelationships, in the impossibility of micro-management, and in the need to trust in long term \n 11 \nbenefits which cannot be pre-determined. To sponsor youth work in the terms in which it is most \nlikely to fulfil its potential requires that a delicate balance be achieved between the need for \naccountability and the conditions needed to establish worthwhile relationships especially  with \nyoung people who find it difficult to trust  institutions. Accountability can only be worthwhile if its \ncriteria reflect the realities of practice. The terms of evaluation need to take cognisance of small \neveryday triumphs on the one hand and the long term benefits of participation on the other. The \ncurrent emphasis upon accreditation is a distortion in these terms.  \n \nThe move towards \u2018recorded\u2019 as well as \u2018accredited\u2019  outcomes is a step towards acknowledging \nthat there is something within youth work which demands self-definition. However, it likely that \nsuch recordings will be constructed according to institutionally created criteria and that they will  \nbe construed as a \u2018lesser\u2019 outcome than accreditation. Until youth workers themselves are able to \ndevelop a language which articulates practice in their own terms, it is likely that even recordings \nwill fail to reflect the priorities of practice.  \n \nWithout empirical evidence, theoreticians who make claims about the meanings of practice in \nopposition to the momentum of policy will be too easily dismissed as \u2018 academic nay sayers\u2019 \n(Wylie, 2004a:18).  If youth work is to become a respected profession, taking its place \nmeaningfully in an integrated approach to young people, aspects of youth work which are unique \nmust be acknowledged. Otherwise youth work practice will remain torn between the instrumental, \ntangible programmes and activities which produce concrete outcomes and those aspects of the \nwork which are relational, organic and process-based and appear to lie at its heart.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nReferences \nAngel Group (2004) (Unpublished) Notes from a meeting of neighbourhood youth workers with \nGeorgie Pomfrey, Gateshead.  \nBarrrett, S.
