How, then, should we communi-\ncate computing\u2019s increasing importance\nto young people making decisions about\ntheir undergraduate study?\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS\nOne thing higher education institutions\ncan do is host residential summer pro-\ngrams that give in-depth, hands-on expe-\nrience to students nearing the end of sec-\nondary school. This gives them a feel for\nundergraduate life and the chance to in-\nteract with peers and academics with sim-\nilar interests and to deepen and broaden\ntheir knowledge in a field they might be\nconsidering for undergraduate study. In\nthe US, such programs typically span\nmultiple weeks and involve an integra-\ntive design project (for example, Rose-\nHulman Institute of Technology\u2019s \u201cOp-\neration Catapult,\u201d www.rose-hulman.\nedu\/catapult). \nIn the UK, Headstart (www.head-\nstartcourses.org.uk) is a national scheme\nfor talented students entering their final\nyear of secondary school. Headstart ap-\nplicants can choose from courses at \na number of hosting universities\u2014in\n2007, 28 institutions offered Headstart\ncourses. Courses typically last about\nfour days, but their composition varies.\nSome have a broad focus on science and\nengineering, whereas others might focus\non a particular field or be tailored specif-\nically for female or minority students.\nLancaster University\u2019s Headstart is a\nfocused course held in July, centered on\nthe theme of \u201cubiquitous computing.\u201d\nThe course aims to\n\u2022 expose students to the diversity of top-\nics and interdisciplinary approaches\nin the field and\n\u2022 give students hands-on experience\nwith developing mobile and perva-\nsive technologies. \nThe course should balance these two\naims while also provisioning for the over-\nReinvigorating the Discipline:\nPervasive Computing\nand Tomorrow\u2019s \nComputer Scientists\nMike Hazas and Rebecca Marsden\n90 PERVASIVEcomputing Published by the IEEE Computer Society \u25a0 1536-1268\/07\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nEditor: Scott F.

Midkiff\nEDITOR\u2019S INTRO\nCourse: Headstart Program\nUnit: Computing Department\nInstitution: University of Lancaster\nCourse Directors: Rebecca Marsden, \nMike Hazas \nLevel: Secondary school\nURL: www.comp.lancs.ac.uk\/headstart\nQUICK FACTSarching aims of the Headstart program,\nwhich include \n\u2022 visiting a local company,\n\u2022 sampling undergraduate life,\n\u2022 meeting academics and recent grad-\nuates, and\n\u2022 receiving career advice.\nFitting all this into a three-and-a-half-\nday program is quite a challenge. \nCOURSE STRUCTURE AND\nOPERATION\nWe use several course components to\nsatisfy our focus subject aims as well as\nthose of the Headstart program (see the\n\u201cCourse Highlights\u201d sidebar). First, a set\nof multidisciplinary workshops give stu-\ndents a snapshot of the breadth of mod-\nern computing. Past examples include a\nseminar on computer science innovation\nfrom a business standpoint, a workshop\non developing multiplayer networked\ngames on mobile phones using Python,\nand an interactive tutorial on installation\nart incorporating embedded sensing.\nSecond, a central component of the\ncourse is the design project (discussed\nfurther in the next section). At the\ncourse\u2019s beginning, we divide the stu-\ndents into predetermined teams. (We\nfound that not allowing students to\nform their own teams is crucial\u2014oth-\nerwise, students who happen to be from\nthe same school might stick together\nand dominate their team, rather than\ngetting to know students from other\nschools to create balanced teams.) On\nthe first day, we present the teams with\nthe project goals and give them about\nthree hours per day to work on the\nprojects. An academic staff member\nand three graduate students supervise\nthe project time. On the course\u2019s final\nday, each team creates a 15-minute\npresentation and demonstration, given\nin front of all attendees and a panel of\nthree judges (see figure 1). Each mem-\nber of the winning team receives a prize;\nin previous years these have been iPods. \nThe third component of the Lancaster\nHeadstart program focuses on informa-\ntion about university courses and careers\nin technology. We offer short sessions\nthat discuss the procedure of applying\nto university and what technology-based\ncourses at university entail. The Head-\nstart attendees particularly enjoy the\nquestion-and-answer session with recent\ncomputing graduates; they seem to iden-\ntify closely with our graduates and con-\nsider the graduates\u2019 firsthand opinions\nto be honest and relevant to their own\nimpending career decisions.\nComputing in industry is a fourth\ncourse component. This involves an af-\nternoon trip to Coniston in the Lake\nDistrict. Coniston Launch is a company\noperating solar-electric passenger boats\non Coniston Water; the company has\nlinks with several departments at Lan-\ncaster University. We also like to en-\ncourage our Headstart course\u2019s indus-\ntrial sponsors to come and talk to the\nstudents. For example, in 2005, Intel\nResearch in Cambridge provided par-\ntial sponsorship, and James Scott, one\nof their senior researchers visited Lan-\ncaster and spoke about ubiquitous\ncomputing-themed research at Intel. \nSocial and recreational activities\nmake up the course\u2019s final component,\nwhich is meant to give students a taste\nof undergraduate life. In addition to\nstaying in the residence halls on cam-\npus, students can spend an evening at\nthe sports center, participate in a pub\nquiz (sans alcoholic drinks, of course),\nand watch (preapproved) DVD films\non a projector system in a lecture hall.\nAnd, as you might expect of under-\ngraduates-to-be, the students seem to\nenjoy just hanging out in the residence\nhalls in the evenings and chatting. \nEven though we host relatively small\ngroups of students, the course\u2019s opera-\ntion is complex and requires many sup-\nport staff. These include two resident\nJULY\u2013SEPTEMBER 2007 PERVASIVEcomputing 91\n\u2022 Tutorial on prototyping ubiquitous systems\n\u2022 Development of networked interactive applications on mobile phones using Python\n\u2022 Workshop on innovation in computing\n\u2022 Interactive and\/or live performance art using embedded sensing\n\u2022 Group design project\n\u2022 Informational sessions on applying to university and studying for technology-based degrees\n\u2022 Onsite company visit: Coniston Launch in the English Lake District\n\u2022 \u201cGrapevine\u201d session: question-and-answer with a panel of recent computer science graduates\n\u2022 Social events: sports center evening, quiz night, film evenings\n\u2022 Seminar on how to use \u201cbad ideas\u201d in brainstorming activities\n\u2022 Overview of pervasive computing research by an industrial sponsor\nCOURSE HIGHLIGHTS\nFigure 1.

Com-\npounding the complexity is the close\nlevel of supervision of the students,\nwhich is legally required because most\nHeadstart participants are under 18\nyears of age. All of this essentially means\nthat running the course is a 24-hour job,\nwhich requires ample people on hand to\ndeal with unexpected situations and to\nallow adequate downtime for staff.\nDESIGN PROJECT \nThe design project aims to demon-\nstrate pervasive computing\u2019s approach\nof detecting real-world phenomenon\n(via sensor data), processing it (often\nusing embedded computers instead of\nconventional ones), and then using actu-\nators (sound, displays, or motors) to\nachieve a desired effect. In this way, stu-\ndents learn that modern, practical, and\nrelevant computing is really about a lot\nof small devices that aid people in some\nway and with which people can interact\nin various environments. Often we use\ncomputers without giving them a spe-\ncific, cognitive focus as we undertake\nour daily activities (for example, com-\nmunicating via text message or listening\nto a pocket MP3 player). Students are\nalready familiar with this type of casual\ninteraction with nonconventional com-\nputing devices\u2014perhaps even to a more\npersonal degree than pervasive com-\nputing researchers are. So, students tend\nto find pervasive computing concepts\nand ideas convincing and appealing.\nHowever, deciding on the design pro-\nject\u2019s technical content and requirements\nis rather tricky. We can\u2019t assume that stu-\ndents have any computing background,\nmuch less experience with any particular\nprogramming language. When we first\nran the course in 2005, we had timetabled\n7.5 hours of project time. We opted for\nan open-ended design project centered on\npaper-based conceptual prototyping. Not-\nwithstanding the project\u2019s abstract nature,\nwe encouraged students to follow the\nsteps of the engineering design process.\nThe teams came up with innovative per-\nvasive application scenarios that they il-\nlustrated using Wizard of Oz demonstra-\ntions. Despite this success, some of the\nstudents felt they hadn\u2019t grappled enough\nwith technical content. They commented\nthat deeper subject matter and building\nsomething \u201creal\u201d in their design project\nwould have been more rewarding. As\neducators who normally adopt a practical\napproach to teaching computer science,\nwe too felt that something was missing.\nFor Headstart 2006 (www.comp.lancs.\nac.uk\/headstart\/2006), we increased the\nallotted project time to 9.25 hours and\nadopted the Lego Mindstorms Robotics\nInvention System as a teaching tool. (In\nmid-2006, Lego released Mindstorms\nNXT, which has new sensor, actuator,\nand connectivity capabilities and uses a\nLabView-based programming environ-\nment. See http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/\nLego_Mindstorms_NXT for more infor-\nmation.) Mindstorms was specifically\ndesigned for educational purposes.5\nAlthough the three design challenges\n(see the related sidebar) might not rep-\nresent typical pervasive computing ap-\nplications (particularly the more ad-\nversarial yet undeniably fun third\nchallenge), we used Mindstorms to\nstress the recursive \u201cinput\/processing\/\noutput\u201d aspect of pervasive computing.\nThe Mindstorms controller unit (the\nthing that gets programmed) is a good\nexample of an embedded device\u2014com-\nplete with the power, computational,\nand peripheral limitations common in\npervasive computing. Each group ran\ntheir batteries flat at least once, and\ngroups observed the limits of the sen-\nsors, the processor, and the actuators.\nThe students also became acutely aware\nof the challenges of overcoming the dif-\nficulties human programmers have try-\nChallenge 1\n\u2022 Build and program a robot that will remove empty aluminum cans from an arena (for\nexample, see figure A). The cans will be arbitrarily placed (standing up) in the arena.\n\u2022 The aluminum cans will be empty.\n\u2022 The arena will be marked out with white masking tape on black carpet or flooring.\n\u2022 The geometric center of your robot must not go outside the arena.\nChallenge 2\n\u2022 Your robot should remove the aluminum cans while navigating around obstacles.\n\u2022 Obstacles can include other robots or stationary, heavy, and rigid things.\nChallenge 3 \n\u2022 Your robot will periodically send over in-\nfrared a unique code that identifies it. You\nwill be given the program blocks to do this.\n\u2022 Of the six teams, there will be one that you\nare hunting (your prey) and one that is\nhunting you (your predator). \n\u2022 Your robot should try to force its prey out\nof the arena; likewise, your robot should\nresist being forced out by its predator. \nMINDSTORM DESIGN PROJECT CHALLENGES\nFigure A. Example of a final design: \nThe wide bracket in front eases the\ncollection of cans.ing to express complex algorithms as\ncomputer programs that run on an em-\nbedded microprocessor.\nPervasive computing device require-\nments stand in contrast to the device re-\nquirements in robotics, where size, cost,\nand power consumption are typically not\nas much a concern. As such, after being\ngiven the design challenge, each team had\nan hour to plan their solution\u2019s approach\nand come up with a list of resources\nneeded\u2014sensors and actuators were in\nlimited supply. The teams didn\u2019t have to\nmeet all three design challenges. How-\never, they could address the different\nchallenges by reusing design compo-\nnents, and we made it clear to the stu-\ndents that judges would look more favor-\nably on projects that addressed all three\nchallenges. To make the programming\ntasks accessible to as many students as\npossible, we opted for RCX Code, the\nGUI-based programming environment\nthat came with consumer versions of the\nMindstorms sets.\nThe projects were wildly successful;\nmany group members worked extra\nhours in the evenings to revise their me-\nchanical designs (see figure 2), improve\ntheir firmware algorithms, and polish\ntheir presentations and demos. Several\nstudents commented that they found the\nRCX Code programming environment\ntoo limiting. This year we\u2019re considering\nusing community-developed Mind-\nstorms programming languages such \nas NQC (Not Quite C, http:\/\/bricxcc.\nsourceforge.net\/nqc) for students who\nwish to use a more powerful language.\nHISTORY AND CURRENT\nDEVELOPMENTS \nStudent attendance in the course has\nvaried from year to year. In 2005 (the first\nyear we ran the course), we had 14 stu-\ndents, and in 2006, the number went up\nto 26. Survey respondents (14 in 2005,\n20 in 2006) in both years were generally\npositive, with 56 percent and 35 percent\nrating the projects as \u201cexcellent\u2019\u2019 and\n\u201cgood,\u201d respectively. All responding stu-\ndents reported that our Headstart pro-\ngram influenced their choices about\nundergraduate study and careers; 76 per-\ncent would consider computer or soft-\nware engineering as their first choice. For\nmany (66 percent), Headstart helped\nthem make a firm decision regarding the\nfield within computing or engineering\nthey wanted to focus on. For a small pro-\nportion of the respondents (10 percent),\ntheir experience in the program helped\nconfirm that they didn\u2019t want to study an\nengineering-related subject.\nWe seem to have achieved our course\ngoals in that none of the students charac-\nterized computer science as nerdy or repet-\nitively boring. Some cited simply being\nmore interested in other subjects (such as\nfilm). But interestingly, a small number\ndidn\u2019t feel confident they could grapple\nwith the \u201ctechnical aspects\u201d of computer\nscience and engineering. By this, we as-\nsume they were referring to computer,\nelectrical, or mechanical system design.\nHowever, in pervasive computing, we\nknow that technical approaches vary\nwidely in their nature, and the greatest\nleaps forward come from a synthesis of\napproaches. This year we aim to repre-\nsent more of these approaches by in-\ncluding sessions on human-computer in-\nteraction or sociology. By familiarizing\nthem with the concept of a user study\nor ethnomethodological approaches to\nunderstanding people and technology,\nwe hope to give students a better idea of\nthe breadth of technical approaches\nneeded to understand computing in the\npresent day.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nOver 25 members of Lancaster University (staff and\nstudents) work to make our Headstart program a\nsuccess, and we can\u2019t name them all here. However,\nwe especially thank Matt Faulkner and Lorna Mc-\nKnight (resident graduate students); Mark Lowton\n(record keeper); and Ben Green, Martyn Welch, and\nAndrew Stone (project supervisors). Paul Coulton\nconducts challenging yet accessible hands-on ses-\nsions on programming mobile phones; these have\nbeen very well received by the students. We also\nthank our industrial sponsors who provide financial\nsupport and a good collaborative spirit: Intel Re-\nsearch, Cambridge (in 2005 and 2006), and Mi-\ncrosoft Research, Cambridge (in 2007).\nREFERENCES\n1.
