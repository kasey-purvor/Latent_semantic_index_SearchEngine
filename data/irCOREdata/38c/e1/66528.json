Officially, there were 5,395 confirmed deaths in Thailand with another \n2,932 people listed as missing. \n \nIn February 2005 a team led by Dr Ben Horton of the University of Pennsylvania was awarded \nan SGER grant by the National Science Foundation to undertake exploratory research on the \ntsunami in Malaysia and Thailand. This report summarises the preliminary conclusions of the \nsocial science element of the Thai fieldwork. The team undertook fieldwork in three main sites \nduring July 2005: Koh Lanta, Koh Phi Phi and Khao Lak. We chose Koh Phi Phi as a small, \ntourist (backpacker)-oriented island economy with high levels of damage and casualties; Koh \nLanta as a site with a significant population of fisherfolk with a long presence in the area; and \nKhao Lak as a mainland site with the highest number of casualties in Thailand and with a \nmixed tourism-fishing economy.  \n \nTHEMES \n \nWe gathered, through interviews, a rich database of qualitative information on the tsunami \nand its impacts and effects, and on patterns of rehabilitation and recovery. We were told of \npeople\u2019s frantic efforts to escape the waves; their serendipity or, alternatively, the sheer bad \nluck of their wives, daughters, sons and husbands who lost their lives. We heard stories of \ngovernment intransigence and of great personal courage and generosity. We found instances \nof resurgent community cooperation and, in a few cases, of dysfunctional response to the \ncrisis. It is important to recognise the uniqueness of geographical place and personal \ncircumstance and the degree to which these will mould \u2013 and often determine \u2013 any detailed \nunderstanding of the tsunami and its aftermath. However we are also aware of the need to \nexplore themes that link the three main sites and the diverse experiences of the people and \ngroups we interviewed in the course of the fieldwork. With this in mind, we identify in this \npaper four themes that provide an explanatory, linking structure: \n \n\u2022 Geographies of crisis: local impacts, extra-local effects \n\u2022 Geographies of recovery: local, national and transnational circuits of social capital \n\u2022 Geographies of fear, psychologies of explanation \n\u2022 Spaces of opportunity \n \nTheme 1: Geographies of crisis: local impacts, extra-local effects \n \nOne of the durable themes of our research is that the impact of natural disasters is never \nmerely local. While the physical damage was concentrated along a relatively narrow coastal \nfringe, in human terms the tsunami\u2019s impact, like the earthquake and resulting tsunami itself, \nrippled outward from its epicentre. \n \nOur own research base was in Krabi town, for example, a site that was not severely hit by the \nwave. Yet in terms of human impacts, the town has been a profound site of trauma since the \ntsunami struck. The Krabi Chinese Temple effectively became the makeshift morgue for the \ndeceased of Phi Phi, who in turn needed to be identified, repatriated, cremated\/buried or put \non ice until their remains could be claimed. Krabi Hospital overfilled with hundreds more of the \n 1\ninjured, stretching emergency services to the limit. The town was ill equipped to cope with a \ndisaster of this magnitude, and relied on the goodwill of many tourism operators and \nvolunteers who helped with accommodation, translation and distributing donations of food and \nclothing. Six months after the tsunami the temple was empty, but reminders of the event \nremain. The survivors of Phi Phi are a significant presence in Krabi town, especially at the \nNong Kok refugee camp. Furthermore, Krabi itself was a site of tourism before the tsunami, \nas a gateway to the off shore islands of Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta, and a good starting point \nfor the nearby tourist sites of Ao Nang and Railay Bay. Yet tourism to all parts of Krabi has \ndwindled, regardless of the local severity of the impact. \n \nThe tsunami also produced other extra-local impacts that are not apparent on the severely \ndamaged coasts. Many of the sites affected by the tsunami in Thailand have attracted migrant \nworkers as well as domestic and international tourists. Men and women from other provinces \nin southern Thailand and from the Northern and Northeastern regions have migrated to \nprovinces such as Krabi and Phang-nga to find employment in the tourist service sector. In \nsome sectors employment networks stretch even further afield. Migrant workers from Burma \n(Myanmar) are employed in the deep-sea fishing industry in Phang-nga (and Ranong). \n \nInevitable and understandably, the focus of media attention and government and international \nefforts were concentrated on the immediate site of death and destruction. This is where the \ncasualties occurred and this is where the physical damage and the associated economic \ncosts were also highest. However this NSF-funded research has revealed how it is necessary \nto place the tsunami and its impacts within a livelihoods framework where space is more \nbroadly drawn. While we were not in a position to map the tsunami\u2019s socio-economic \n\u2018footprint\u2019 in detail we can say, with confidence, that the livelihood eroding effects of the \ntsunami stretch in often surprising ways to inland provinces of Thailand and to other \ncountries. \n \nTheme 2: Geographies of recovery:  local, national and transnational circuits of social \ncapital \n \nWhile the physical damage to Thailand\u2019s western coastal areas was uneven, so too, we \nsuggest, are the geographies of recovery. Not only did the tsunami differentially affect \ncommunities across the region, but there is also differentiation in terms of response rates and \nthe effectiveness of recovery programmes. How communities affected by disasters are able to \nrecover depends on a number of factors, such as the kind and extent of damage, the \ntimeliness and effectiveness of assistance from various institutional structures, village \ncohesiveness, and community access to economic, social and political resources. We \nsuggest that social capital \u2013 here understood as the ability to mobilise access to resources \nthrough prior or post-tsunami social networks \u2013 plays a crucial role in recovery activities. \nThese networks often stretch across a number of scales, from networks within the community \nto those that span international borders. \n \nTo appreciate the social patterning of recovery in Thailand, it is necessary to understand the \npresence and role of state and non-state agencies. How these agencies gain access and \ncarry out their activities in turn depends on the kinds of communities affected, whether they \nare cohesive fishing communities, mixed tourism-fishing communities or international tourist \nsites made up of diverse migrant populations. In Koh Lanta, for example, organisations such \nas UNICEF, UNDP and the Thai Red Cross provided donations of rice, water, medicine, \nclothing, kitchen utensils and basic infrastructure materials to help people rebuild their homes \nand boats in the first weeks after the tsunami. The Muslim community at Ban Hua Laem \nspoke of collective efforts to clean-up affected sites and distribute aid donations in the early \ndays. As the months progressed the community was able to replace fishing boats through \nofficial channels to the Fisheries Department, and acquire more than a dozen new boats \nthrough the Prince\u2019s Royal Project. The community also prepared a visual record of the \ndestruction to the village and has approached organisations in Kuwait for financial support \n(Figure 1). Ban Hua Laem thus activated local, national and transnational social networks in \ntheir efforts to rebuild the community.  \n \n 2\nOn Koh Phi Phi, however, the community response was less unified, and certainly less \u2018local\u2019. \nThe population scattered across numerous sites in the first weeks, and no clear strategies to \nre-establish the community were proposed. State efforts focused on initial clear-up operations \nand constructing the refugee camp in Krabi, rather than re-establishing the community on-\nsite. Instead, Phi Phi has relied on personal donations from abroad, and a buoyant supply of \ntourist volunteers, to begin the task of rebuilding the community in situ. In many ways Phi \nPhi\u2019s cleanup and rehabilitation has relied on the backpacker\/tourist network flowing through \nthis renowned tourist site. Such transnational social capital has been crucial to the \nrehabilitation process, but has raised issues of sustainability and leadership. A particularly \ncontroversial scheme, initiated by the volunteers, is the setting up of a tsunami museum \nbeside the pier.  This is not favoured by the Thai community, however, who do not want a \nconstant reminder of the tragedy. Added to this are the cultural insensitivities that see \nvolunteers clearing up in bikinis and shorts in a largely Muslim community. \n \nThese examples show how affected sites and communities not only receive different levels of \nsupport from different sources, but are also able to summon different support networks. The \nstate and international organisations \u2013 even in a country which is as wealthy and centralised \nas Thailand \u2013 are unable to provide support which reaches to every area, every settlement, \nand every household. \n \nTheme 3: Geographies of fear, psychologies of explanation \n \nThe nature and unprecedented scale of the tsunami in the Andaman Sea created an intense \nsense of fear; in particular, the fear of the unknown, the uncertain and the uncontrollable. The \nmonths since the tsunami have seen local people trying to come to terms with the event, \nmanaging their losses, and attempting to explain and rationalise the khluen yaak, or giant \nwave. This rationalisation has involved an engagement both with the science of earthquakes \nand tsunamis, and the incorporation\/embedding of this science with traditional Thai beliefs. \nThese are not contradictory or mutually exclusive but have become part of a continuum of \nexplanation where it is hard to draw a line between \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018science fiction\u2019, or between \nscience and culture.  \n \nExplanations for the tsunami often combine science, religion and culture. The media has \nplayed a role in educating the public that the tsunami was generated by an earthquake in the \nIndian Ocean. Nonetheless, many still do not understand the science, providing an \nopportunity for scientific terms to become melded with cultural and religious explanations. \nThere were several instances when more elderly informants, and particularly Muslims, told us \nthat the tsunami was \u2018God\u2019s way of telling us that we have sinned\u2019. On Nopporathara Beach in \nKrabi province, one informant told us that it was because younger Muslims had deviated from \nIslam, consuming alcohol and drugs. As retribution, God sent the tsunami to cleanse the area \nof sin. Pin, a Buddhist grandmother in Khao Lak said the wave was \u2018not natural \n[thammachaat]\u2019 but caused by a khluun yaak or a \u2018giant wave\u2019. The implication was that this \nwas an abnormal event (which, of course, it was) but she also seemed to imbue this with a \nsupernatural quality. \n \nIt is important, we feel, not to separate out those who adhere to a scientific explanation for the \ntsunami, and those who see it as supernatural or religious in origin. Those who explain and \nunderstand (and therefore come to terms with) the tsunami in religious or supernatural ways, \nwere also generally quite willing and able to ally the supernatural\/religious and the natural. So \nfor many, perhaps most individuals the tsunami was both a natural event and a \nreligious\/supernatural occurrence. \n \nTheme 4: Spaces of opportunity \n \nAn event on this scale may radically transform structures and processes of social relations \nand economic production. We suggest that it represents a historical break \u2013 or, in Thai, taek \u2013 \nin local trajectories of existence. It does, in a sense, throw the pieces of the jigsaw in the air. \nSome return to the place they originally occupied in the local picture; others become muddled \nand disjointed; still more are lost entirely in the confusion and the destruction. Post-tsunami \nreconstruction, therefore, does not mean a reconstruction and therefore a recreation of the \n 3\npre-tsunami state of affairs. The danger \u2013 and therefore the challenge \u2013 is that because a \npost-tsunami situation is one where people are characteristically emotionally and \neconomically vulnerable, it may create opportunities for outsiders, for the worst of reasons, to \ntake advantage of the situation.  \n \nLek and Daa, two Muslim sisters aged 28 and 21 years old respectively, run a small pancake \nhouse on Koh Phi Phi, 200 metres east of the main pier (Figure 2). The shop sells assorted \npancakes, drinks and deep fried snacks (bananas, jack fruit, spring rolls). The sisters ran a \npancake house before the tsunami, although not from this corner plot. They operated from a \nrestaurant nearby. They lost all their equipment with a total value of 25,000 baht (US$625) \nand which they had to replace. In these terms, the tsunami led to a considerable initial loss. \nHowever it also afforded an opportunity which would not otherwise have arisen, namely the \nopportunity to move to a larger, permanent and prime corner plot. The damaged building they \nwork from has a rental of 3,000 baht (US$75) a month. Before the tsunami, when it was a \nclothing store, the rental was 10,000 baht (US$250) a month. Daa and Lek illustrate the type \nof re-working of social and economic space that occurs following an event of this magnitude.  \n \nLek and Daa\u2019s experience can be contrasted with Ban Laem Pom. Ban Laem Pom is a small \nfishing village around 25 km north of Khao Lak which has had a history of land disputes. Two \nyears before the tsunami a powerful local business interest, intent on securing this valuable \nbeach front land for tourism development, bulldozed some houses in the village to intimidate \nthe villagers and frighten them into moving out. They resisted. The tsunami, however, \nprovided an opportunity for this nai thun (capitalist) to restate his claim. Ban Laem Pom was \nhit very hard by the tsunami; there were many deaths, particularly of children. With the village \nabandoned by its inhabitants, the nai thun ordered his henchmen to encircle the village in \nbarbed wire and posted armed guards around the settlement. When the villagers tried to \nreturn to reclaim the bodies of their wives, children, and husbands they were threatened with \nviolence and prevented from entering the village. It was two weeks after the tsunami when \nnational newspapers caught wind of the situation and sent photographers to take pictures of \nthat village. Using the well-established tactic of mass re-occupation, the villagers managed \nsuccessfully to confront the guards and re-enter the settlement to find and bury their dead. \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \nSocial research in the aftermath of a sudden natural hazard event is urgent and challenging. \nOur team found there to be complex geographies of crisis and recovery in all the sites we \nvisited. Political and administrative impediments to recovery are seen to operate within and \nacross scales, which is partly due to the problems of inter-agency coordination involving very \ndifferent bodies (e.g. international organizations, NGOs, and private companies) operating at \ndifferent levels in the national hierarchy. \n \nSome of the hardest hit communities and households \u2013 such as poorer fisherfolk, tourist \nresort workers and migrant workers \u2013 are often neglected or ignored. Sometimes this is \nentirely bureaucratic as officially there is \u2018no record\u2019 of undocumented workers and the boats \nof many poorer fishing households are not \u2018registered\u2019. Furthermore, effects on migrant \ncommunities (including very large numbers of Thais), who contributed much to the local \neconomies represents a mostly hidden dimension. Their stories are often absent from the \nofficial transcript. Transnational social capital and networks are another critical area for further \nresearch. We found significant variations in the forms of assistance relating to particular \nplace-specific economic, social and cultural geographies. These ranged from communities \nreliant upon a plethora of recognized international organisations to communities where forms \nof assistance were low profile and locally specific.  \n \nIn addition to the spectacular, tragic and obvious destruction, the tsunami event has produced \nnumerous socially transformative challenges and opportunities that necessitate longer-term \nresearch engagement. We have tried to outline just some of these in this short summary \npaper. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n 4\nThe research team would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the US National \nScience Foundation who funded the research.
