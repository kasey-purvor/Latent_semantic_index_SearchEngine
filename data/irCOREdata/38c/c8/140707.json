This edition comprises seven\nreviews covering the most active research areas where we believe some of the most\nprominent advances in the field are likely to emerge in the near to medium term. In\nline with scope of this journal, some emphasis is given towards techniques applicable\nto Cell Biology.\nThe authors have been selected from some of the most active research groups around\nthe world in the field of Biosensors and since all of the articles are reviews, the\ncoverage of material is extremely broad reaching.\nThe field of Biosensors has continued to grow from the early 1960s when Clark and\nLyons [1] along with other pioneers such as Updike and Hicks [2] reported the first\ndevices that could be described as being true \u2018Biosensors\u2019. For those new to the field,\nthere are a number of definitions, although one of the most widely accepted defines a\nBiosensor as being: \u2018a device that comprises a biological recognition entity coupled in\nclose proximity to a transducer\u2019. In this context an enzyme, antibody, nucleic acid or\nother biological molecule may be coupled to a transducer such as an electrode,\nthermistor or optical detector.\nOver the four decades of Biosensor research, there have been a number of drivers,\nwhich have steered much of the development of the field. Much of the early work was\nfocussed towards the development of blood glucose sensors to allow the\ndetermination of blood glucose levels\u2014firstly for hospital-based analyses and later\nvia disposable blood test strips for use by diabetics. Many reviews of blood glucose\nsensing for diabetes have already been published and the reader is referred, for\nexample to [3] and [4]. While it is hard to precisely quantify the sizes of specific\nmarket sectors, it has been estimated that in excess of $130 billion is spent annually\non direct and indirect costs relating to diabetes with an increasing percentage being\ndevoted to testing via the use of blood glucose biosensors [5]. Research over the last\ntwo decades has increasingly diversified into many differing fields such as DNA\nanalysis, the use of antibodies for simplified diagnostics and homeland security, as\nwell as the exploitation of nanotechnology and the potential this offers.\nThis edition commences with: \u2018A review of the use of genetically engineered enzymes\nin electrochemical biosensors\u2019, by Jean-Louis and co-workers, since enzyme-based\nbiosensors still represent the largest class of biosensors that have been successfully\ncommercialised. Much of the ongoing research effort using enzymes has recently\nbeen focused towards the exploitation of genetically modified enzymes since the\nexploitation of all of the main classes of enzymes within biosensors have been\nextensively researched. The reader is referred to [6] and [7] for coverage of this area.\nThe next review: \u2018Antibody production, design and use in biosensor-based\napplications\u2019, by Richard O\u2019Kennedy and co-workers, is focussed towards the\nexploitation of antibodies within biosensors as the next largest grouping of\nbiomolecules used to date; this review illustrates how a biosensor can be produced\ntowards almost any analyte so long as an antibody can be raised towards an antigen.\nEditorial - Seminars In Cell & Developmental Biology, 2009, Vol 20, 1-2\nDavis, F. and Higson, S.P.J.\nNucleic acids represents another major class of bio-molecule extensively exploited\nwithin biosensors, however since this field has been extensively reviewed elsewhere,\nthe reader is referred to [8] and [9].\nThe next three reviews in this edition are focussed towards transducers, the first of\nwhich: \u2018Optical biosensors for probing at the cellular level: A review of recent and\nfuture perspectives\u2019, by Maria Velasco-Garcia, considers the most recent advances in\nthe use of optically based biosensors since these represent the largest class of\ntransducer exploited to date after electrochemical devices. This is followed by a\ncontribution by Paul Millner and co-workers entitled: \u2018Nanostructured transducer\nsurfaces for electrochemical biosensor construction \u2013 interfacing the sensing\ncomponent with the electrode\u2019, which covers the use of nanotechnology \u2013 an area\nwhich will unquestionably play a major role in future developments within the\nbiosensor field.\nThe role of modern electronics is emphasised within the review by Michael Sch\u00f6ning\nand co-workers of: \u2018Field effect devices for detecting cellular signals\u2019, while also\ndemonstrating some practical applications to the field of cellular biology.\nThis special edition ends with two reviews dedicated to two further areas of practical\napplications for contemporary biosensors. Ashok Murchandani firstly considers:\n\u2018Real-time molecular methods to detect infectious viruses\u2019, while Ibtisam Tothill\nconcludes with a review of the use of: \u2018Biosensors for Cancer Markers Diagnosis\u2019.\nReferences\n[1] L.C.
