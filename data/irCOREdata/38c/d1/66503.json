Received .\nABSTRACT\nWe have investigated the formation of globular cluster (GC) systems in the fiducial\nsemi-analytic model of galaxy formation of Cole et al., by assuming that GCs are\nformed at high-redshift (z > 5) in proto-galactic fragments, and during the subsequent\ngas-rich merging of these fragments. Under these assumptions we have simulated the\nGC systems of 450 elliptical galaxies, and find that the majority (93 %) are intrinsically\nbimodal in metallicity. We find that, in the mean, the metal-rich GC sub-populations\nare younger than the metal-poor GC sub-populations, with ages of 9 Gyr and 12\nGyr respectively, and that the mean ages of the metal-rich GCs are dependent upon\nhost galaxy luminosity and environment (halo circular velocity), whereas the metal-\npoor GCs are not. We find that the continued gaseous merging of the proto-galactic\nfragments leads to significant age-structure amongst the metal-rich GCs. These GCs\nexhibit a large age-range (5 to 12 Gyr), which increases for low-luminosity galaxies, and\nfor galaxies in low circular velocity haloes. Moreover, the metal-rich GCs associated\nwith low-luminosity field and\/or group ellipticals, are \u223c 2 Gyr younger than the metal-\nrich GCs in luminous cluster ellipticals. We find the total GC populations scale with\nhost galaxy luminosity as NGC \u221d L\n1.25\nV,gal, a result in agreement with observations\nof luminous elliptical galaxies. This scaling is due to a systematic increase in the\nM\/L ratios of the galaxy haloes with luminosity for LV,gal > L\u2217 galaxies in the\nmodel. A comparison between the luminosity growth of the model ellipticals and their\nGC formation indicates that mergers do not significantly effect SN at z < 2. We\nfind the mean colours of the both the metal-rich and metal-poor GCs exhibit only a\nweak dependence upon host galaxy luminosity, a result consistent with contemporary\nobservations. We conclude that gaseous merging, the bulk of which occurs at 1 \u2264 z \u2264 4\nin our \u039bCDM model, leads to the formation of the metal-rich peak of the GC systems\nof elliptical galaxies. We suggest that the formation and subsequent truncation of the\nmetal-poor GCs in the proto-galactic fragments is closely related to the star formation\nrate in these fragments, which may have been significantly higher at very early times.\nKey words: galaxies: star clusters\u2013 galaxies: formation \u2013 galaxies: evolution \u2013 galax-\nies: elliptical and lenticular, cD\n1 INTRODUCTION\nGlobular clusters (GCs) are a seemingly ubiquitous fea-\nture of nearly all galaxies in the local Universe. A growing\nbody of evidence has indicated the presence of correlations\nbetween GC systems and their host galaxies, such as the\nmean metallicity of GC systems (e.g. Brodie & Huchra 1991)\nand the total number of GCs with host galaxy luminosity\n(e.g. Djorgovski & Santiago 1992; Zepf, Geisler, & Ashman\n\u22c6 email: mbeasley@astro.swin.edu.au\n1994) or cluster velocity dispersion (e.g. Blakeslee, Tonry, &\nMetzger 1997). Results such as these suggest that GC forma-\ntion is intimately linked to galaxy star formation, and since\nGCs are simpler stellar systems than galaxies, they provide\na unique record of the formation history of their host galaxy.\nIn the past decade, there have been two key advances in\nGC research. One has been the discovery of newly forming,\nmassive young star clusters (YMCs to use the terminology\nof Larsen & Richtler 1999), with masses and sizes consis-\ntent with those expected for newly formed GCs. Such YMCs\nare seen to be forming in a variety of star-bursting environ-\nments (Meurer et al. 1995) including violent galaxy merg-\n2 M.A. Beasley et al.\ners (e.g. Holtzman et al. 1992; Whitmore & Schweizer 1995;\nSchweizer et al. 1996; Zepf et al. 1999; Forbes & Hau 2000),\nstar-bursts (e.g. O\u2019Connell, Gallagher, & Hunter 1994; Wat-\nson et al. 1996), circum-nuclear ring galaxies (Barth et al.\n1995) and the discs of otherwise unperturbed spirals (Larsen\n& Richtler 1999). The inference is that YMCs can form in\na wide variety of galactic environments.\nThe second development has been the discovery of bi-\nmodality in the broad-band colours of many (perhaps most)\nGC systems (e.g. Zepf & Ashman 1993; Elson, Santiago, &\nGilmore 1996; Geisler, Lee, & Kim 1996; Forbes, Brodie,\n& Huchra 1997; Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig 1999; Kundu &\nWhitmore 2001; Larsen et al. 2001). Owing to the relative\ninsensitivity of broad-band colours to age differences in old\nstellar populations (O\u2019Connell 1976; Worthey 1994) these\nbimodal colour distributions in GC systems are, by impli-\ncation, thought to largely reflect bimodal metallicity distri-\nbutions. Spectroscopic metallicities obtained for the Milky\nWay (see Carney & Harris 2001), M31 (Barmby et al. 2000)\nand several giant ellipticals (e.g. Cohen, Blakeslee, & Ryzhov\n1998; Kissler-Patig et al. 1998; Beasley et al. 2000; Forbes\net al. 2001) largely support this notion.\nThe metallicity bimodality of the GC systems in lumi-\nnous ellipticals was predicted by Ashman & Zepf (1992),\nwho presented a model for the formation of metal-rich GCs\nduring the merging of gas-rich spirals. Subsequent ideas have\nalso been developed which attempt to explain the bimodality\n(and other properties) of GC systems, in-situ, multi-phase\ncollapse (Forbes, Brodie, & Grillmair 1997; Harris, Harris,\n& McLaughlin 1998) and the accretion of dwarf galaxies and\ntheir GCs (Cote, Marzke, & West 1998). Whilst all of these\nmodels have been successful in explaining certain properties\nof GC systems, in detail each has its problems (see Carney &\nHarris 2001 for details). However, rather than (somewhat ar-\ntificially) separating these models, it is perhaps more reason-\nable to expect a hybrid of some or all of the above scenarios.\nIn this respect, \u2019semi-analytic\u2019 models of galaxy formation\nmay offer a suitable framework within which to achieve such\na hybrid model in a more natural way.\nSemi-analytic models of galaxy formation have proved\nthemselves to be valuable tools with which to follow the for-\nmation and subsequent evolution of galaxies in hierarchical\nclustering cosmologies (e.g.White & Rees 1978; White &\nFrenk; Kauffmann, White, & Guiderdoni 1993; Cole et al.\n1994). These models treat the galaxy formation problem in\nan ab initio fashion. Starting from a power spectrum of pri-\nmordial density fluctuations, the merger history and assem-\nbly of dark matter haloes is computed. The properties of the\ngalaxy population are then calculated through to the present\nday using simple, physically motivated analytic recipes to\nfollow the evolution of gas and stars.\nThe parameters and input physics of the semi-analytic\nmodels are constrained by the requirement that the models\nshould match various \u2018fundamental\u2019 galaxy properties, and\nthese constraints vary between the different groups. Such\nproperties include the local B and K -band galaxy luminos-\nity functions, the relative fractions of galaxy morphologi-\ncal types, the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation and the gas\nfractions in discs in the case of the model used in this pa-\nper (e.g. Cole et al. 1994; 2000; Baugh, Cole, & Frenk 1996;\n1998), or the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation and the\nslope of the galaxy colour-magnitude relation in the case of\nFigure 1.

The resulting model predictions are then\ncompared to other observed galaxy properties.\nCurrently, none of the semi-analytic models have been\ntested in any detail against the growing wealth of data on\nGC systems of galaxies. Here, for the first time, we compare\nexpectations from the fiducial semi-analytic model of Cole\net al. (2000) with the observed properties of GC systems.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we\ndescribe the semi-analytic model used in this study and how\nwe go about producing GC systems from the star formation\nhistories it produces. In Section 3 we show examples of the\nresulting GC systems of individual galaxies and compare\nthem with observations of GC systems. Next, in Section 4,\nwe compare the global properties of our model GC systems\nwith a compilation of contemporary observational data for\nthe GC systems of early-type galaxies. In Section 5 we dis-\ncuss some of the principal issues raised in this study, before\npresenting a summary and our conclusions from this work\nin Section 6.\n2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 The Semi-Analytic Model\nThe semi-analytic model we use in this study is the gal-\nformcode (Cole et al. 2000). A wide range of physical pro-\ncesses are incorporated in this model; here we give only a\nbrief outline of the model and refer the reader to Cole et al.\n(2000) for a complete description.\nThe galform model used in this paper is the fiducial\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 3\n\u039bCDM model of Cole et al.(2000), with the following val-\nues of the cosmological parameters: a mean mass density,\n\u21260 = 0.3, a cosmological constant, \u039b0 = 0.7, a Hubble con-\nstant of h = 0.7 (where H0 = 100 h kms\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121) and a\nlinear variance in spheres of radius 8h\u22121Mpc of \u03c38 = 0.93.\nOnce the cosmological parameters and the form of the power\nspectrum of density fluctuations have been specified, the full\nmerger history of an ensemble of dark matter haloes is com-\nputed using the Monte-Carlo prescription described in Cole\net al.(2000) (see also Baugh et al. 1998).\nThe semi-analytic code utilises a set of simple rules to\nto model the complex physics of galaxy formation. The pro-\ncesses treated include: (i) The shock heating of gas in the\ngravitational potential wells of dark matter haloes. (ii) The\nsubsequent radiative cooling of this gas, tracking the angu-\nlar momentum of the gas distribution. (iii) The formation of\nstars from the cooled gas. (iv) Feedback processes, e.g. stel-\nlar winds and supernovae, that re-heat some of the cooled\ngas and thereby regulate the star formation rate. (v) The\nchemical evolution of the various reservoirs of gas and stars\n(see Fig. 3 of Cole et al. 2000). (vi) Mergers of galaxies\ninside a common dark matter halo, based upon dynamical\nfriction arguments. Bursts of star formation can occur dur-\ning a merger if cold gas is present. (vii) The evolution of the\nstellar populations of galaxies. The extinction of starlight is\ncomputed in a self-consistent way using the chemical evolu-\ntion model and the size of the disk and bulge components.\nWe note that Benson et al. (2001a) describe extensions to\nthe scheme of Cole et al.(2000), refining the treatment of the\ncooling of gas in relatively small dark matter haloes at high\nredshift and improving the calculation of merger timescales.\nThese features are not used in the model presented here. For\nbright galaxies at reasonable redshifts, we expect that these\ntwo versions of the galform code will produce comparable\npredictions.\nWe show an example of the evolutionary history of a\ngalform galaxy in Figure 1 (see Baugh, Cole, & Frenk\n1996, Baugh et al. 1998). The figure shows the formation\nand evolution of the progenitors of a present day massive\nelliptical galaxy. The width of the filled regions indicates\nthe fraction of the present day galaxy\u2019s stellar mass that is\ncontributed by each progenitor. In the case of Figure 1, the\nprogenitors of this elliptical galaxy experienced several fairly\nsignificant mergers that would lead to a dramatic change in\nthe progenitors\u2019 morphology (e.g. at redshifts 0.8 and 0.3),\nand numerous minor mergers.\nStar formation in the discs of the progenitors of present\nday galaxies provides the source of metal-poor GCs in our\nmodel (see next section). When we say GCs are formed\nin gas discs, this does not mean that the metal-poor GCs\nare associated with the stellar\/gas discs of spiral galaxies.\nRather that the origin of the metal-poor GCs are proto-\ngalactic cold-gas discs modelled in galform. Henceforth, to\ndistinguish between galaxy discs and the proto-galactic discs\nmodelled in galform, we abbreviate the latter to PGDs.\nWe show the evolution of the mean ratio of cold gas to\nstars in the PGDs of a present-day elliptical in Figure 2. At\nredshift \u223c 5, the majority of these PGDs have a high mass\nfraction of cold gas (\u223c 95%). It is only at z \u223c 0.6 that this\nratio reaches unity, as gas is used up during star formation.\nIn addition to star formation in PGDs, bursts of star\nformation can accompany galaxy mergers. Galaxies merge\nFigure 2. Mean ratio of the mass in cold gas to stars for the\nprogenitor PGDs for a present day elliptical in the semi-analytic\nmodel. Filled triangles with error-bars represent mean values with\ntheir associated 10 and 90 percentiles of the distribution. The cold\ngas-fractions with respect to stars range from \u223c 95% at z = 5, to\n\u223c 10% at z = 0.\nin the model if the timescale for a galaxy orbit to decay to\nthe centre of a dark matter halo, as a result of dynamical\nfriction, is shorter than the lifetime of the halo, which we\ntake to be the time for the halo to double its mass through\nthe accretion and mergers of smaller subunits. If the mass\nof the satellite is larger than 30% of the mass of the central\ngalaxy, then the merger is designated as a major merger\n(see Kauffmann, White, & Guiderdoni 1993; Baugh, Cole,\n& Frenk1996). In this case, if cold gas is present then a\nburst of star formation takes place. Thus it can be seen\nthat the morphology of a galaxy in galform is essentially\na function of time. In a major merger, any stellar discs in\nthe merging galaxies are destroyed and the resulting galaxy\nwill be bulge dominated, i.e. it will be early-type. Over time,\nin the absence of additional major mergers, gas will cool\nand the bulge will accrete a disc of enriched, cold gas, thus\nforming a spiral (or lenticular) galaxy. An important point\nto bear in mind when considering this model is that much\nof the star formation occurs at relatively low redshift, with\nonly \u223c 50 % of stars forming prior to redshifts of z \u223c 1.5.\nThis occurs because the formation of stars in lower mass\nhaloes is suppressed by feedback from star formation.\n2.2 Star Formation Histories to Globular Clusters\n2.2.1 Forming Globular Clusters\nOur goal is to create a simple model for forming GC sys-\ntems within galform, thereby keeping the number of new\nparameters required to a minimum. However, in creating\nGC systems from the star formation histories (SFHs) pro-\nduced in the model, requires us to make several assumptions\n4 M.A. Beasley et al.\nabout the nature of GC formation and how this relates to\nthe global star formation in a galaxy. Our principal assump-\ntion is that GC formation accompanies the two modes of\nstar formation. We assume that GCs form: (i) contempora-\nneously with the star formation occurring in PGDs and (ii)\nduring major mergers involving star formation.\nThe GCs formed in both modes become the composite\nGC system of the resulting galaxy. As we show later, this can\nresult in two sub-populations of GCs which have undergone\ndifferent levels of chemical enrichment; one metal-poor GC\nsub-population, formed in cold gas PGDs, and one metal-\nrich formed during gas-rich merging. Henceforth, in order to\ndistinguish between the GC sub-populations, we refer to the\nPGD-formed GCs as blue GCs and the merger-formed GCs\nas red GCs.\nFor each model realisation, we build the GC system\nof each galaxy by assuming that some fraction of the stars\nformed remain in a clustered mode, i.e. they become, and\nremain, GCs. We calculate total numbers of GCs (since we\ndo not have explicit luminosity information), and adopt a\nmean GC mass, \u3008MGC\u3009, corresponding to that of the Milky\nWay GC system of \u223c 3.0 \u00d7 105M\u2299 (from the McMaster\ncatalogue of Harris 1996; May 15th, 1997 version).\nWe neglect the possible effects of the dynamical evo-\nlution and destruction of the GCs, which may be signifi-\ncant (e.g. Aguilar, Hut, & Ostriker 1988; Gnedin & Ostriker\n1997). The study of McLaughlin (1999) suggests that the\ntotal mass of GC systems is not significantly effected by the\ndynamical destruction of low-mass GCs within an effective\nradius of an elliptical. However, the simulations of Vesperini\n(2000) indicate that some 10\u201320% of the initial GC system\nof a luminous elliptical may be destroyed over a Hubble time\ndue to dynamical destruction processes.\nSubsequently, we define a \u2019formation efficiency\u2019 of the\nGCs as the mass of GCs which form and survive the possible\neffects of dynamical destruction (MGC) relative to the mass\nof stars which form and survive (Mstars) associated with the\nmodel galaxies:\n\u01eb \u2261 MGC\nMstars\n(1)\nit is effectively this efficiency \u2013 the fraction of GCs that are\nformed and survive with respect to stars \u2013 which is measured\nwhen one obtains the \u2019specific frequency\u2019 (SN) of a galaxy,\nas discussed further in \u00a7 4.1.\nUnder the hypothesis that no dynamical destruction of\nthe GCs operates, this efficiency may be directly equated\nto a global formation efficiency for the GCs. If, however,\nGC systems truly undergo significant dynamical destruction\n(e.g. Vesperini 2000), then \u01eb is more a reflection of a GC\n\u2019survival efficiency\u2019.\nWith our stated assumptions, we construct GC systems\nfor each galaxy as follows: for each galaxy merger tree, gal-\nform outputs SFHs for stars formed both in PGDs and\nin bursts, yielding stellar masses, hot gas mass, cold gas\nmass and metallicities (Z) as a function of look-back time.\nTo create the blue GCs, we take a fraction of the cumula-\ntive total of stars formed in the PGDs, dictated by MGC\nand our adopted blue GC formation efficiency (\u01ebblue). This\nyields age and metallicity distributions for the metal-poor\nGCs as a function of redshift.\nFor each major merger, red GCs are created correspond-\ning to our adopted red GC formation efficiency (\u01ebred), pro-\nviding that a high enough mass of stars are formed in the\nburst (M\u2217 > \u3008MGC\u3009). These nascent GCs are then assigned\nages and metallicities corresponding to the age and metal-\nlicity of the burst in which they were formed. Each burst\nof star formation is assumed to be instantaneous, and each\nburst assumes instantaneous recycling of stellar material.\nTherefore, the metallicity distributions of the red GCs form\na series of \u03b4-functions, separated by the time elapsed be-\ntween each burst.\u2020\nWe then convert the ages and metallicities of each GC\ninto observable quantities. The absolute metallicity, Z, pre-\ndicted by galform is converted to the amount of metals rel-\native to hydrogen via [m\/H] = log(Z\/Z\u2299), assuming Z\u2299 =\n0.019 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). In the observational plane,\nmetallicity is often expressed as the ratio of iron-peak ele-\nments relative to hydrogen, [Fe\/H], and Galactic halo stars\nand GCs are known to be \u03b1-enhanced with respect to solar\nvalues by \u223c + 0.3 (Carney & Harris 2001). Therefore, where\nappropriate, we convert between [m\/H] and [Fe\/H] using the\napproximate relation [Fe\/H] = [m\/H] \u2013 0.3.\nBroad-band colours, such as V \u2212 I and V \u2212K, are then\nderived for the GCs using the predicted ages and metallici-\nties of our model. For this purpose, we use the single stellar\npopulation (SSP) models of Kurth, Fritze-v. Alvensleben, &\nFricke (1999; henceforth KFF99). We have investigated the\neffects of using the KFF99 models which adopt both Salpeter\nand Scalo initial mass functions (IMFs). We find altering the\nassumed IMF has little effect on the overall colour distribu-\ntions of the GC systems, and for the remainder of this study\nwe use the KFF99 models which employ a Salpeter IMF.\n2.2.2 Selecting the Initial Parameters\nThe principal parameters which we adjust are the forma-\ntion efficiencies of the red and blue GCs. Several workers\nhave argued for a \u2019universal\u2019 efficiency of GC formation\n(e.g. di Fazio & Capuzzo Dolcetta 1987; McLaughlin & Pu-\ndritz 1996; McLaughlin 1999), whilst other studies indicate\nthat the star and GC formation efficiency in star-bursts and\ninteractions may be significantly higher than in the \u2019passive\u2019\nmode (e.g.Meurer et al. 1995; Zepf et al. 1999; Larsen &\nRichtler 2000; Ashman & Zepf 2001). Since the exact phys-\nical processes governing GC formation are still unknown\n(e.g. Elmegreen & Efremov 1997), rather than adopting a\npriori assumptions in any one particular direction, we have\nelected to employ a straightforward parametrisation for the\nGC formation.\nWe have chosen to adjust the GC formation efficiencies\nin our model in order to reproduce the numbers of GCs ob-\nserved in the prototypical bimodal GC system of NGC 4472,\nperhaps the best-studied elliptical galaxy in terms of its GC\nsystem. This galaxy, an E2\/S0 in the Virgo cluster with\nMB = \u201322.05, has some 4000 blue GCs and 2400 red GCs\n(Geisler, Lee, & Kim 1996; Lee, Kim, & Geisler 1998), yield-\ning a ratio of blue to red clusters of Nblue\/Nred = 1.6.\n\u2020 Our assumption of instantaneous GC formation is not strictly\ncorrect. Observational evidence (e.g.Whitmore et al. 1999) and\ntheoretical work (Mihos & Hernquist 1996) on such induced star\nformation indicates that its duration may be of order \u223c 100 Myr.\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 5\nFigure 3. Cumulative number of GCs formed with redshift for\nour fiducial galaxy. Top panel: logarithm of the number of blue\nGCs formed in our fiducial galaxy with redshift. The different\ncurves (left to right) indicate GC formation efficiencies of 0.00012\nto 0.0040. The horizontal dot-dashed line indicates the observed\nnumber of blue GCs in NGC 4472. Bottom panel: comparison of\nthe number of blue GCs formed with redshift in PGDs (dotted\nline) and red GCs in bursts (solid line), normalised to the ob-\nserved numbers of red and blue GCs in NGC 4472 at z = 0. The\nefficiencies are \u01ebblue = 0.002 and \u01ebred = 0.007, and the blue GC\nformation has been truncated at z = 5.\nWe have selected an elliptical in our simulated sample (see\n\u00a7 2.2.3) which offers the closest match to NGC 4472 in terms\nof luminosity, morphology and halo mass.\nThe galaxy in question, #12 in our model sample, is\na giant elliptical with MB \u2013 5 log h = \u201322.04, and a dark\nmatter halo rotational velocity (Vrot) of 600 kms\n\u22121. Assum-\ning an isothermal potential and isotropic velocity dispersion,\nwe convert Vrot to 1-D velocity dispersions, \u03c31D = vc\/\n\u221a\n2\n(Baugh, Cole, & Frenk 1996). This yields \u03c31D = 424 kms\n\u22121,\nslightly higher, but comparable to that of the NGC 4472\nsubcluster in Virgo, where \u03c31D = 390 kms\n\u22121(Binggeli, Tam-\nmann, & Sandage 1987). Henceforth, we will refer to this\nmodel elliptical as our fiducial galaxy.\nIn galform, the (globally averaged) luminous star for-\nmation rate (SFR) reaches a maximum of \u223c 0.1 h M\u2299 yr\u22121\nMpc\u22123 at redshift \u223c 3, and is still approximately 15% of this\nvalue at the present epoch. If we adopt a common efficiency\nfor both GC components, and allow blue GC formation to\ncontinue up to z = 0 in un-merged PGDs, the blue GCs\ndominate (by mass) over the red GCs by up to two orders\nof magnitude (depending upon the merger history of the\nparent galaxy).\nTo illustrate this effect, in Figure 3 (top panel) we plot\nthe number of blue GCs formed with redshift for our fiducial\ngalaxy, for a range of GC formation efficiencies of 0.00012\nto 0.004. For comparison, we also show in the figure the\nnumber of GCs in the blue mode of the NGC 4472 GC sys-\nFigure 4. The resulting metallicity distributions (left panels) and\ncorresponding V \u2212 I colour predictions (right panels) for the red\nand blue GCs in our fiducial galaxy under different assumptions.\nThe distribution in [m\/H] of red and blue GCs if (a) blue GC\nformation is allowed to continue to z = 0, with the efficiency of\nthe blue GC formation assumed to be constant at \u01ebblue = 0.00012.\n(b) blue GC formation continues to the present epoch, but with\n\u01ebblue \u221d SFR and (c) \u01ebblue = 0.002, but blue GC formation is\ntruncated at z = 5. The ages and metallicities are converted to\ncolours using the models of KFF99.\ntem (\u223c 4000), taken from Geisler, Lee, & Kim (1996) (dot-\ndashed line). It is clear that, unless we assume a very low\nefficiency for GC formation, the PGD GC formation must\nbe truncated at successively higher redshifts to obtain the\ncorrect total number of blue GCs. In the bottom panel of\nFigure 3, we show the cumulative total of blue GCs and red\nGCs formed with redshift. We have adopted efficiencies of\n\u01ebblue = 0.002 and \u01ebred = 0.007 to agree with the observed\nnumbers of blue and red GCs in NGC 4472. The flatten-\ning of the curve for the blue GCs in Figure 3 indicates the\nlocation of our truncation redshift.\nUpon initial consideration, it seems undesirable to ar-\nbitrarily truncate the formation of the blue GCs; we could\nsimply choose a very low efficiency (e.g. \u01ebblue = 0.00012).\nHowever, by allowing blue GC formation to continue to the\npresent epoch significantly broadens the blue GC metallicity\ndistribution, to the extent that the observed colour distri-\nbutions do not appear bimodal. Such a result is inconsis-\ntent with the present observational situation, not only for\nNGC 4472, but also for nearly all early-type galaxies with\nhigh-quality datasets.\nIn Figure 4 we show the differential metallicity distri-\nbutions (left-hand panels) for the red and blue GCs formed\nin our fiducial galaxy. In producing the metallicity distribu-\ntions of the red GCs (dark shaded histograms in left-hand\npanels), we assume a constant formation efficiency of \u01ebred\n6 M.A. Beasley et al.\n= 0.007. For the blue GCs we make three different assump-\ntions about the nature of their formation efficiencies and\nformation redshift, each time ensuring that \u223c 4000 GCs\nare created. In the right-hand panels, we show the corre-\nsponding V \u2212 I colour distributions of the GCs, predicted\nby interpolating the KFF99 models for their corresponding\nmetallicities and ages.\nIn Figure 4(a), we assume that blue GCs form in PGDs\nup until the present epoch, and adopt an efficiency of \u01ebblue\n= 0.00012, yielding \u223c 4000 GCs in the blue mode. The blue\nmetallicity distribution covers the range \u20131.8 \u2264 [m\/H] \u2264 0.2,\npeaking at [m\/H] \u223c \u20130.7, and overlaps substantially with\nthe red GCs, which peak just short of solar metallicity. The\npeak-to-peak separation is \u223c 0.5 dex and it is this, coupled\nwith the fact that the distribution is so broad (\u223c 0.5 dex),\nwhich yields a colour distribution which is single-peaked and\nskewed to V \u2212 I \u223c 1.18.\nIn (b) we again allow blue GC formation to continue to\nthe present day, however this time we set \u01ebblue to be propor-\ntional to the SFR in their progenitor PGDs. We have based\nthis assumption on the results of Larsen & Richtler (2000),\nwho have performed observations of YMCs in 21 nearby spi-\nral galaxies. These authors found that the specific U -band\nluminosity of YMCs is correlated with the host galaxy far-\ninfrared luminosity. This, they propose, is indicative of the\nformation efficiency of the clusters being dependant upon\nthe local SFR in the disc, as opposed to any dependence\nupon the type of star formation (e.g.merger, quiescent, star-\nburst). By adopting \u01eb \u221d SFR, we find that the blue GC\nmetallicity distribution becomes more sharply peaked than\nis the case for (a) and is narrower, with \u03c3rms = 0.28 dex.\nHowever, the mean of this distribution still occurs at [m\/H]\n\u223c \u20130.7. Likewise, the corresponding V \u2212 I colours of the\nGCs also show a narrower distribution (\u03c3rms = 0.22 mag),\nbut remain unimodal. At the peak of the SFR in the semi-\nanalytic model (z \u223c 3), mean stellar metallicities are already\nsubstantially enriched, therefore, in the present scheme, an\n\u01eb \u221d SFR relation yields blue GCs which cover too broad\na metallicity range, and are too metal-rich (if no blue GC\ntruncation is adopted).\nIn (c) we show the GC system formed in the same\ngalaxy if we adopt a constant GC formation efficiency (\u01ebblue\n= 0.002), but truncate the blue GC formation at z \u223c 5. This\nredshift corresponds to a characteristic mean gas surface-\ndensity of the progenitor disks of \u223c 1000M\u2299 pc\u22122 (1.25\n\u00d71023 cm\u22122). Such a truncation results in a blue GC distri-\nbution in the range \u20132.4 \u2264 [m\/H]\u2264 \u20130.6, peaking at [m\/H] \u223c\n\u20131.2. Since the metallicity of the red GC component peaks\nat [m\/H] \u223c \u20130.2, this yields a peak-to-peak separation of\n1.0 dex, and a corresponding colour distribution which is\nbimodal, with peaks at V \u2212 I = 0.95 and 1.18.\nFrom the constraints placed upon us by observations\nof the GC system of NGC 4472, we obtain \u01ebblue = 0.002\nand \u01ebred = 0.007 respectively. Furthermore, we truncate the\nformation of the blue GCs at z = 5 (henceforth denoted\nztrunc), which corresponds to look-back times of \u223c 12.3 Gyr\nin our assumed cosmology. We find that \u01ebblue is similar to\nthe global value found by McLaughlin (1999) of \u01eb = 0.0026 \u00b1\n0.0005, whilst \u01ebred, the GC formation efficiency in mergers,\nis required to be a factor of \u223c 4 higher to produce the correct\nnumber of GCs.\nWe list the principal cosmological and model parame-\nTable 1.

(2000) for a full description\nof the model, and the effects of varying one or more of these\nparameters.\n2.2.3 The Galaxy Sample\nWe have simulated a total of 450 dark matter haloes, with\nmasses 1.0\u00d71013h\u22121M\u2299 \u2013 1.3\u00d71015h\u22121M\u2299. The associated\n450 central galaxies (and their respective GC systems) span\na magnitude range of \u201323.6 \u2264 MV - 5 log h \u2264 \u201320.0. The\nmost luminous galaxies are rather rare constructs in gal-\nform (as they are in the Universe), and therefore the lowest\nluminosity galaxies are numerically by far the most domi-\nnant in our simulated sample.\nOur galaxies have bulge-to-total (B\/T) luminosity ra-\ntios of 0.6 \u2013 1.0. These B\/T values roughly correspond to\nearly-type galaxy morphologies (see Kauffmann, White, &\nGuiderdoni 1993; Baugh, Cole, & Frenk 1996). For conve-\nnience, in this paper we refer to low-luminosity ellipticals as\nthose galaxies with MV \u2013 5 log h \u2265 \u201321.5, and define the\ndivision between field\/group and cluster environments to lie\n(somewhat arbitrarily) at \u03c31D = 300 kms\n\u22121 (i.e. velocity dis-\npersions similar to that of the Leo group).\nWe emphasise the term \u2019environment\u2019 as used here\nrefers to the velocity dispersion (mass) of the parent dark\nmatter halo, rather than any number density measure-\nment of nearby galaxies. Consequently, our definitions of\nfield\/group\/cluster environments are not directly compara-\nble to the density (\u03c1) parameter used by some previous work-\ners.\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 7\nFigure 5.

(2001).\n3 THE GLOBULAR CLUSTER SYSTEMS OF\nINDIVIDUAL GALAXIES\n3.1 A Luminous Elliptical\nIn Figure 5 we show the age, metallicity and correspond-\ning colour (V \u2212 I and V \u2212 K) distributions obtained for\nour fiducial galaxy, the cluster elliptical with MB \u2013 5 log\nh = \u201322.04. Inspection of the age histograms (top left, Fig-\nure 5) indicates that the mean age of the blue GCs is several\nGyr older than the red GCs (although there is some small\noverlap), and possess a significantly shorter period of forma-\ntion. This short duration of blue GC formation is a result\nof our truncation at z = 5, and the subsequent non-linear\nconversion between look-back time and redshift. The more\nextended and continuous formation of the red GCs is a con-\nsequence of ongoing merging and star formation from high\nredshift to z \u223c 0.6.\nThe bottom left panel of Figure 5 shows the metallic-\nity distribution of these same GCs. The blue GCs show an\nexponential-like increase in metallicity peaking at [m\/H] \u223c\n\u20131.2 and then a sharp cut-off which, again, is a result of\nour truncation. The metallicity range of these blue GCs is\n\u20132.7 \u2264 [m\/H] \u2264 \u20130.5. In contrast, the red GCs form in mul-\ntiple bursts at, or around, solar metallicities (there are 75\nmergers involving star formation for this particular galaxy).\nTheir metallicities extend from [m\/H] \u223c \u20131.0 to [m\/H] \u223c\n+ 0.2, with a mean metallicity of [m\/H] = \u20130.2. There is\nvery little overlap between the metallicity distributions of\nthe two components.\nThe width of the blue and red metallicity distributions\nare 0.33 and 0.20 dex respectively. The model red GC distri-\nbution is somewhat narrower than those found from ground-\nbased imaging by Geisler, Lee, & Kim (1996) for NGC 4472,\nwhich are 0.35 and 0.36 dex for the blue and red modes re-\nspectively. However, these values may be overestimated if\nthe conversion between colour and metallicity is non-linear\n(e.g. see Kissler-Patig et al. 1998). Our values are closer to\nthose found for the metal-poor and metal-rich components\nof the Milky Way of 0.34 and 0.23 dex respectively (Ashman\n& Zepf 1998).\nIn the top right panel we show the \u2019observed\u2019 V \u2212 K\ncolours of our fiducial galaxy\u2019s GC system, assuming obser-\nvational uncertainties of 0.05 mag. The distribution is clearly\nbimodal, with peaks at 2.35 and 3.10 mag, and illustrates\nthe sensitivity of V \u2212K colours to metallicity. The bottom\npanel shows the colour histogram in the less sensitive, but\nmost commonly used V \u2212 I colours. Again the colour distri-\nbution is bimodal - but not so well delineated as the V \u2212K\nindices - with peaks at 0.95 and 1.18 mag.\nIn the bottom-left panel of Figure 5 we have plotted\nthe observed V \u2212 I colour distribution of NGC 4472 GCs of\nLarsen et al. (2001), taken from three HST pointings. These\ndata have been scaled to the total numbers of GCs produced\nin our model. Comparing the model V \u2212I distributions with\ndata of limited spatial extent (e.g.HST) is not ideal, since\nthe relative number of red to blue GCs changes with radius\n(e.g. Geisler, Lee, & Kim 1996 ) whilst we model the entire\nGC system. However, bearing this in mind we find that for\nour simulated GC system, the widths of blue and red modes\nin V \u2212 I are 0.08 and 0.07 mag respectively, similar to the\nNGC 4472 data of Larsen et al. (2001) which have widths of\n0.08 and 0.09 mag for the blue and red modes respectively.\nThe relatively old ages of the model GCs and the broad,\ndistinct metallicity distributions shown in Figure 5 imply\nthat the observed colour distributions are primarily driven\nby metallicity differences, consistent with our discussion in\n\u00a7 1.\n3.2 A Low-Luminosity Elliptical\nIn Figure 6 we show our results for another GC system, this\ntime for a lower luminosity elliptical galaxy, which has MB\n\u2013 5 log h = \u201320.42. The age and metallicity distributions\nof the blue GCs in this galaxy are very similar to those\nshown for the more luminous elliptical in Figure 5. The blue\nGCs span the range \u20132.5 \u2264 [m\/H] \u2264 \u20130.6, with a mean\nof [m\/H] \u223c \u20131.2. Indeed, for the majority of our simulated\ngalaxies, variations in the age and metallicity distributions\nof the blue GCs are rather small. The principal differences\nin the distributions of the blue GCs is in the range of their\nmetallicities for galaxies of different luminosity. We find that\nthe most luminous galaxies possess blue GCs which reach to\nboth slightly higher, and in particular, lower metallicities\nthan galaxies of lower mass.\nThe distribution of metallicity for the red GCs in the\nlow-luminosity elliptical is discontinuous, showing intermit-\ntent bursts of star formation. Indeed, the galaxy in question\nin Figure 6 has undergone 12 major mergers, a factor of \u223c 6\nfewer than its more massive counterpart. However, despite\n8 M.A. Beasley et al.\nFigure 6. Age, metallicity and colour distributions for the GC\nsystem of a low-luminosity elliptical. Top left panel: Age distribu-\ntions for blue GCs (light shaded histogram) and red GCs (dark\nshaded histogram). Bottom left panel: Metallicity distributions\nfor blue and red GCs. Top right: V \u2212 K colours of GCs using\nthe SSP models of KFF99. Bottom right: V \u2212 I colours of GCs\nderived from the KFF99 models. The dashed line indicates the\nscaled HST data for NGC 4552 from Larsen et al. (2001).\nthis much more modest merger history, the width and posi-\ntion of the red GC \u2019peak\u2019 is surprisingly similar to that of\nour fiducial galaxy. It is this trend, in that lower-luminosity\nellipticals undergo fewer major mergers than more lumi-\nnous galaxies, which is the origin of the scatter in the mean\ncolours of the red GCs found in Section 4.2.\nThe age distribution for the red GCs in Figure 6 is some-\nwhat different to that of our luminous fiducial galaxy. The\ndistribution of the GC ages, corresponding to the look-back\ntime of the galaxy\u2019s major mergers, extends to much younger\nages. In fact, this galaxy has undergone a small merger cou-\npled with GC formation recently (400 Myr ago) with a some-\nwhat stronger merger occurring \u223c 4 Gyr ago producing \u223c\n200 GCs (see next section) The existence of the very young\nGCs is reflected in the V \u2212 I colours of the GCs shown in\nthe bottom-right panel of Figure 6, which show a population\nwith V \u2212 I \u223c 0.5.\nThe \u223c 4 Gyr ages of the \u2019red\u2019 GCs have the effect\nof slightly \u2019blueing\u2019 their V \u2212 I colours, thereby yielding\na broad, top-hat distribution as opposed to any obvious bi-\nmodality. However, this is actually a fairly rare occurrence in\nthe model and only 1% of galaxies actually appear unimodal\ndue to a spread in ages within the red GC sub-populations\n(see Sec 4.3). The V \u2212 K colours (top-right panel) of the\nGCs again show their insensitivity to age differences for all\nbut the very youngest clusters.\nIn general we find that, for lower luminosity galaxies,\nusually in lower circular velocity haloes, star formation in\nbursts occurs at successively later times. This reflects a\ngeneric result of semi-analytic models such as galform,\nin that more massive galaxies in cluster-type environments\nform their stars earlier than less massive galaxies in the field\n(we look more closely at this result in \u00a7 4.4).\nIn Figure 6, we have over-plotted HST data from Larsen\net al. (2001) for NGC 4552, an E0 galaxy withMB = \u201320.47,\nagain scaled to the numbers in our model galaxy GC sys-\ntem. Whilst it is of similar luminosity to our model galaxy,\nwe have primarily selected these galaxy data because its\nbimodality is not clearly delineated, providing reasonable\nagreement with our model GC V \u2212 I colours. We empha-\nsise that the majority of our simulated GC systems, for all\ngalaxy luminosities, appear clearly bimodal in V \u2212 I , when\nthe entire GC system is considered.\n4 GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF THE\nGLOBULAR CLUSTER SYSTEMS\n4.1 Specific Frequency\nA commonly measured property of a galaxy\u2019s GC system is\nits total number of GCs. When normalised to the luminosity\nof a \u2019typical\u2019 dwarf galaxy (MV = \u201315; Harris & van den\nBergh 1981) this becomes the specific frequency:\nSN = NGC \u00d7 100.4(MV +15) (2)\nwhere NGC is the total number of GCs associated with the\ngalaxy in question with magnitude MV . Since SN relates\nthe total number of GCs to the luminous mass of its parent\ngalaxy, it is an indication of the efficiency of a given galaxy\nat forming GCs, and also offers an insight into the possible\nro\u02c6le of environment upon the properties of GC systems.\nWe show the luminosity growth and the corresponding\nevolution of SN of our fiducial galaxy, and it low-luminosity\ncounterpart in Figure 7. The fiducial elliptical shows a very\nsmooth increase in its luminosity, with some 90% of its stel-\nlar component formed prior to z \u223c 1.0 (a look-back time\nof \u223c 8 Gyr in our assumed cosmology). Consequently, the\nevolution of the SN in this galaxy\u2019s GC systems is also very\nsmooth. The SN of the blue GCs is initially very high at\nearly times, and subsequently declines, taking on a constant\nvalue at z \u223c 0.4. This occurs because the blue GCs are all\ncreated prior to z = 5, whereas the bulk of the galaxy stars\nform somewhat later. In contrast, the SN of the red GCs in\nour fiducial galaxy show very little evolution. The creation\nof red GCs in mergers prior to z \u223c 0.4, is effectively off-\nset by the formation of field stars, thereby producing a near\nconstant SN . The observed decline in the total SN at early\ntimes is entirely due to the contribution from the blue GCs.\nThe luminosity growth of the lower-luminosity elliptical\nis somewhat different. There is a sudden increase \u2013 a \u2019kink\u2019\u2013\nwhich occurs at \u223c 4 Gyr, indicating that the luminous mass\nof the galaxy increases by \u223c 6%. This kink corresponds to\na major merger which this galaxy undergoes, leading to the\nformation of field-stars and\u223c 200 red GCs (see top-left panel\nof Figure 6). Significantly, this late merger has very little\neffect upon the total SN of this elliptical. Since the formation\nof the red GCs during this merger is accompanied by the\nformation of some 2 \u00d7 109L\u2299 of luminous material, the SN\nof the red GCs increases by \u223c 0.5 whilst the SN of the blue\nGCs decreases by \u223c 0.2. Therefore, the overall effect of this\nmerger upon the total SN of the galaxy is only to increase SN\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 9\nFigure 7.

The \u2019kinks\u2019 in the\ntwo right-hand panels occurring at \u223c 4 Gyr correspond to a major\nmerger.\nby \u223c 0.3. Therefore, we find that low-redshift mergers have\nno significant effect upon the SN of ellipticals in our model,\nreflecting the relatively small cold gas fractions involved in\nmergers at these epochs.\nIn Figure 8 we show the total SN of our elliptical galax-\nies plotted against the velocity dispersion of their dark mat-\nter haloes. Here, we use \u03c31D as a measure of cluster mass,\nobtained from the halo circular velocity, Vdisc, as discussed\nin \u00a7 2.2.2. It is important to realise that the luminosities of\nthe central dominant galaxies in galform (i.e. all the galax-\nies in this study) are strongly correlated with \u03c31D. This is\na natural result of semi-analytic galaxy formation models,\nwhere galaxies acquire mass through merging within dark\nmatter haloes.\nIn Figure 8, we have also plotted data for 75 early-\ntype galaxies, predominantly taken from the compilations of\nKissler-Patig (1997) and Ashman & Zepf (1998). To increase\nthe number of luminous galaxies in our observational sam-\nple, we have also included the data of Blakeslee (1997) and\nBlakeslee, Tonry, & Metzger (1997). These authors obtained\nSN for 21 ellipticals in 19 Abell clusters (19 of which were\nbrightest cluster galaxies, henceforth BCGs) using surface-\nbrightness fluctuation techniques. Since Blakeslee, Tonry, &\nMetzger (1997) measured a \u2019metric\u2019 SN , measured within\na 40 kpc radius of each galaxy, we convert these to global\nSN values, using the empirical conversion factor found by\nHarris, Harris, & McLaughlin (1998) of SN = 1.3 \u00d7 S40N .\nWe assign velocity dispersions for the parent group or\ncluster for each galaxy in the Kissler-Patig (1997) and Ash-\nFigure 8.

Data are taken from Ashman\n& Zepf (1997), Blakeslee et al. (1997) and Kissler-Patig (1997).\nOpen circles represent brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and\/or\ncD galaxies, filled triangles represent \u2019normal\u2019 ellipticals and open\ntriangles indicate S0s.\nman & Zepf (1998) catalogues, based largely upon the galaxy\ngroup and cluster membership given in Rood & Dickel\n(1978). In the majority of cases, for groups we obtain veloc-\nity dispersions directly from ned. For the Blakeslee, Tonry,\n& Metzger (1997) sample, we use the velocity dispersions\ngiven in their paper (see Harris, Harris, & McLaughlin 1998\nfor a similar compilation).\nUncertainties in the total GC population of galaxies,\nwhich often require large extrapolations, lead to uncer-\ntainties in SN of up to a factor of two for some galaxies\n(e.g. Ashman & Zepf 1998). This uncertainty is compara-\nble to the scatter in SN in the sample used here; therefore\nsearching for variations in SN for ellipticals at a given lumi-\nnosity (e.g. Harris, Harris, & McLaughlin 1998) is difficult.\nHowever, the modelled GC systems shown in Figure 8 do\nreflect the observed scatter in SN , but mainly amongst el-\nliptical galaxies in haloes with \u03c31D < 630 kms\n\u22121.\nFor galaxies in the centres of clusters, SN is known to\ncorrelate with the dynamical and X-ray mass of the host\ncluster (Blakeslee 1997; Blakeslee, Tonry, & Metzger 1997;\nHarris, Harris, & McLaughlin 1998). This behaviour is ap-\nparent in Figure 8, where many of the observed BCG\/cD\ngalaxies have SN which are factors of 2\u20135 higher than their\ncounterparts in lower velocity dispersion haloes. Interest-\ningly, we find that the mean SN of the model ellipticals also\nincreases (by a factor of \u223c 2) in going from the lowest to\nhighest mass haloes, as indicated by the solid line in the\nfigure. This is, initially, a rather surprising result. Since we\nhave adopted constant GC formation efficiencies (as given\nin Table 1), one might expect SN to remain approximately\nconstant across all host galaxy magnitudes.\n10 M.A. Beasley et al.\nIn order to explain the observed correlation between\nSN and cluster mass, Blakeslee, Tonry, & Metzger (1997)\nposited that GCs formed at early times, and in proportion to\nthe total mass available in the halo (including dark matter),\nwhilst the luminosity growth of the central galaxy halted\nat later times, yielding the observed correlation of SN with\ndensity. They interpreted the observed increase in SN as a\nresult of the fact that the BCGs were insufficiently lumi-\nnous for their position in the cluster, i.e. the BCGs were\nunder-efficient at forming field stars with respect to non-\nBCG galaxies, concluding that GCs formed with a constant\nrate per unit mass (0.7 GCs per 109M\u2299; \u01eb \u223c 0.0002).\nIn a similar vein, Harris, Harris, & McLaughlin (1998),\nlooked to the hot, X-ray emitting gas associated with galaxy\nclusters to explain the observed behaviour of SN . By assum-\ning a constant GC formation efficiency (\u01eb \u223c 0.001), these au-\nthors argued that the baryonic material which would have\ngone on to form stars was expelled by galactic winds during\nstar formation, effectively lowering the central galaxy\u2019s final\nstellar luminosity and effectively increasing its SN .\nDeveloping this idea, McLaughlin (1999) suggested that\nby considering the initial mass of gas available to the pro-\ntogalaxy for forming stars on similar spatial scales to the\ngalaxy starlight, the formation efficiency for GCs takes a\nconstant value (\u01eb = 0.0026 \u00b1 0.0005). Moreover, he proposed\nthat the ratio MGC\/Mstars does not provide a true measure\nof \u01eb in the most massive galaxies (as implied by their larger\nthan average SN ), and that the seemingly greater efficien-\ncies of BCGs in forming GCs stems from the fact that SN\nonly measures the mass contribution from stars, in addition\nto the fact that the M\/L ratios of elliptical galaxies vary\nsystematically with their luminosity.\nSince we explicitly know the hot gas fractions present\nin each galaxy\u2019s halo, we can explore these ideas within our\nmodel. We remind the reader that we have included no dy-\nnamical destruction of the GCs in our model, and therefore\nour definition of \u2019efficiency\u2019 (equation 1) should only be re-\ngarded as a true formation efficiency under this assumption.\nMcLaughlin (1999), defined the observed GC formation\nefficiency to include all the hot gas (Mhot) detected on the\nsame spatial scale as the galaxy starlight:\n\u01eb \u2261 MGC\nMstars +Mhot\n\u2261 M\ninit\nGC\nM initgas\n(3)\nwhere M initGC is the initial GC population (before any dy-\nnamical processes have acted upon the GCs) and M initgas the\ninitial gas supply available to the protogalaxy. Under the as-\nsumption of a constant GC formation efficiency, McLaughlin\n(1999) found that the total number of GCs (NGC), scaled\nthus:\nNGC \u221d L1.3V,gal\n(\nMhot\nMstars\n)\n(4)\nwhere LV,gal is the V-band luminosity of the host galaxy.\nThe scaling L1.3V,gal comes from noting that the M\/L ratios\nof ellipticals systematically increase with their luminosity,\na result similar to those found previously by Djorgovski &\nSantiago (1992) and Zepf, Geisler, & Ashman (1994).\nThe scaling given in equation (4), is indicated by the\ndashed line in Figure 9. Here we have plotted the total\nnumber of GCs formed for each model galaxy, against host\ngalaxy V -band luminosity (see figure 8 of McLaughlin 1999\nFigure 9. The total number of GCs formed compared to the\nluminosity of each galaxy. Small circles indicate the simulated\nGC systems of 450 galaxies. The dotted line indicates SN =\n5 (i.e.NGC \u221d L\n1.0). The dashed line is the relation found by\nMcLaughlin (1999), described in the text. The solid line indi-\ncates the mean value of NGC for our model elliptical galaxies, the\narrow indicates the position of our fiducial model galaxy. Data\nare taken from Ashman & Zepf (1997), Blakeslee et al. (1997)\nand Kissler-Patig (1997). Open circles represent brightest clus-\nter galaxies and\/or cD galaxies, filled triangles represent \u2019normal\u2019\nellipticals and open triangles indicate S0s.\nFigure 10. The total mass of hot gas associated with our model\ngalaxy haloes.\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 11\nfor a similar plot). Again, we have included the observational\ndata described previously.\nThe mean values of NGC for the model ellipticals, sys-\ntematically deviate from the SN = 5 line ( i.e. a scaling of\nNGC \u221d L1.0V,gal). Whilst the precise location of the model\npoints in the y-axis depends upon our adopted efficien-\ncies (the position of our fiducial galaxy is indicated in Fig-\nure 9), a least-squares fit to the model points indicates a\nscaling of NGC \u221d L1.25V,gal . The dependence of NGC upon L\nfor our model galaxies is similar to the scaling suggested\nby McLaughlin (1999; c.f. equation 4), to account for the\nobserved increase in M\/L ratios of elliptical galaxies with\nluminosity. Since we have assumed \u01eb = constant, and we\nhave not included the model hot gas component in the cal-\nculation of NGC, the increase in model SN can only be ac-\ncounted for by an increasing M\/L ratio of our elliptical\ngalaxies with increasing luminosity. As discussed by Ben-\nson et al. (2000; see their figure 8), the B -band M\/L ra-\ntios of galaxy haloes in galform are a function of halo\nmass. For the halo mass range considered in this study\n(1.0\u00d71013h\u22121M\u2299 \u2264 Mhalo \u2264 1.3 \u00d7 1015h\u22121M\u2299), the M\/L\nratio of galaxy haloes is an increasing function of L. This\noccurs because at Mhalo > 10\n12h\u22121M\u2299, gas cooling is in-\ncreasingly inefficient over the halo lifetime, thereby inhibit-\ning galaxy formation (the most efficient value of Mhalo is\n\u223c 1012h\u22121M\u2299, below these masses galaxy formation is in-\nhibited by star formation feedback \u2013 see Benson et al. 2000).\nThe mean line of the model galaxies in Figure 9 scales\nin the correct sense with the observational data, and the\nMcLaughlin (1999) relation. However, the model is still in-\nconsistent with the highest SN galaxies (although it may be\nargued that the scatter is large enough to be consistent). To\naccount for this remaining discrepancy, McLaughlin (1999)\nincluded the hot gas component in the calculation of NGC,\nas indicated by equation 4.\nWe show the behaviour of the model hot gas compo-\nnent in Figure 10. Here, \u2019hot gas\u2019 refers to all the baryonic\nmaterial in the halo which is not in the form of cold gas\nor stars. Figure 10 indicates that the most massive central\ncluster galaxies are able to expel and virialize large quanti-\nties of gas at early times, due to a combination of feedback\nfrom star formation, and long gas-cooling time-scales. This\npicture is supported by the observational studies of Harris,\nHarris, & McLaughlin (1998) and McLaughlin (1999). More-\nover, it is also clear that the halo hot gas component of our\nmodel ellipticals increases much too strongly (by a factor of\n\u223c 100) to account for the differences shown in Figure 9.\nHowever, consideration of this apparent inconsistency\nwith the McLaughlin (1999) study must be accompanied\nwith an important caveat. The X-ray gas considered by\nMcLaughlin was measured on < 100 kpc scales (i.e. on scales\nwhere the galaxian surface brightness can be measured),\nwhereas the hot gas component in galform is associated\nwith the entire galaxy halo (i.e. on \u223c 500 kpc scales). Asso-\nciating some core radius of hot gas in our model with galaxy\nluminosity is not particularly meaningful, since in our model\nthe entire hot gas component is associated with the star for-\nmation in the central galaxy. Our scheme is more in keeping\nwith the interpretations of West et al. (1995), Blakeslee,\nTonry, & Metzger (1997) and Harris, Harris, & McLaugh-\nlin (1998), in that the \u2019high SN \u2019 problem is associated with\nentire haloes (e.g. clusters), rather than on the more local\nFigure 11. The mean colours of the GC systems with host galaxy\nmagnitude. Top panel: blue GCs, bottom panel: red GCs. Data\npoints with error-bars taken from the compilation of Forbes &\nForte (2001). Open triangles represent the GC systems of S0\ngalaxies, filled triangles represent galaxy types earlier than S0,\nscales as suggested by McLaughlin (1999). These interesting\nissues will be examined in greater detail in a future paper.\n4.2 Mean Colours\nSince the initial study by van den Bergh (1975), the sub-\nject of whether or not the mean metallicities of GC systems\n(and their sub-populations) correlate with host galaxy lu-\nminosity has been a controversial one (e.g. Brodie & Huchra\n1990; Ashman & Bird 1993; Secker et al. 1995; Durrell et al.\n1996; Forbes et al. 1996; Kundu & Whitmore 2001; Forbes\n& Forte 2001; Larsen et al. 2001). Since in our model, we\nhave information about the stellar populations of both the\nGCs and their host galaxies, we are in a position to look for\nany such correlations between these two properties.\nIn Figure 11 we have plotted the mean V \u2212 I colours\nof the red and blue GCs predicted by our model against the\nabsolute V -band magnitude of the host galaxy. The data-\npoints are taken from the compilation of Forbes & Forte\n(2001), who have placed the GC colour distributions of 28\ngalaxies onto a common V \u2212 I system. To facilitate a fair\ncomparison, we have omitted all the galaxies from the Forbes\n& Forte (2001) compilation with morphological type later\nthan S0.\nFor both the red and the blue GCs, our model points lie\ncomfortably within the observational uncertainties of these\ndata. The large scatter in our model at the low-luminosity\nend arises partly because of the occurrence of late bursts\nof GC formation, where age effects become important in\ndetermining the colours of the GCs.\nOur model predicts an essentially flat relation between\nhost galaxy magnitude and mean (although there is an in-\n12 M.A. Beasley et al.\ncrease in both sub-populations at the 1-\u03c3 level). Forbes &\nForte (2001) found that the mean V \u2212 I colours of the red\nGCs increased with both host galaxy luminosity and veloc-\nity dispersion. These authors argued that such a correlation\nwas indicative of a close connection between the red GCs\nand the bulk stellar content of their host galaxy, and that\nthis connection primarily supported the multi-phase collapse\nmodel of Forbes, Brodie, & Grillmair (1997). Interestingly,\nKundu & Whitmore (2001) also found evidence for such a\ncorrelation (from the thesis work of A. Kundu, from which\npart of the Forbes & Forte sample was derived), however\nthese authors did not ascribe any particular significance to\ntheir findings, and argued that such a correlation did not\nsupport any one particular GC formation model.\nAt face value, the flat colour-magnitude gradients of the\nmodel GC systems indicate that either (i) the GCs do not\n\u2019know\u2019 about their host galaxy, implying that the GCs do\nnot share a common chemical enrichment history with the\ngalaxy or (ii) all the galaxies in our sample are enriched to\nvery similar levels.\nWe know the former scenario not to be the case, since\nin our scheme the formation of red GCs is tied to the star\nformation which is associated with major mergers. Any sub-\nsequent increase in the metallicity of these bursts would lead\nto enrichment of the GCs, and therefore be reflected in their\ncolours. The situation for the blue GCs is not so clear, since\nwe truncate their formation at the early stages of the for-\nmation of their host galaxy. However, it seems reasonable\nto expect that enrichment in these GCs will have preceeded\nto similar levels irrespective of the final mass of the galaxy,\nleaving little or no correlation between their mean colours\nand host galaxy luminosity.\nTo better understand these results, we look at the be-\nhaviour of the GC mean colours their parent galaxies with\ngalaxy magnitude in Figure 12. The mean colours of the\ngalaxy sample are determined from the mass-weighted age\nand metallicity of their stellar populations, however we find\nthat by adopting a luminosity-weighting scheme has little\neffect on the colours. We have not included any corrections\nfor aperture in the colours of the galaxies, which can have a\nsignificant effect on their mean colours (e.g. Kodama et al.\n1998). However, since we have no spatial information about\nthe stellar populations in our sample and we cannot correct\nfor the presence of radial gradients which are seen in real\ngalaxies, we simply state that the galaxy colours given in\nFigure 12 are a lower limit.\nThe figure shows that the mean colours of the red GCs\nare generally consistent with the mean galaxy colours, al-\nthough for the most luminous galaxies the GC colours are\nmarginally redder than the galaxies. The blue GCs are some\n0.2 mag bluer in V \u2212I than their host galaxy, corresponding\nto a pure metallicity difference of \u223c 1.0 dex. This is consis-\ntent with all studies to date for which photometry of both\nthe GC sub-populations and the host galaxy light have been\nobtained in the same observation (NGC 1399 : Ostrov, Forte,\n& Geisler 1998, NGC 1427 : Forte et al. 2001, NGC 3923 :\nZepf, Ashman, & Geisler 1995, NGC 4472 : Geisler, Lee, &\nKim 1996; Lee & Kim 2000), as noted by Forbes & Forte\n(2001).\nFigure 12 also highlights another important issue: the\nmean model galaxy colours show no increase with magni-\ntude. Indeed they exhibit very similar behaviour to that of\nFigure 12. The mean colours of the GCs and their host galax-\nies, versus parent galaxy magnitude. Top panel: Mean V \u2212 K\ncolours of the red GCs (squares with 1\u03c3 error-bars), blue GCs\n(triangles with 1\u03c3 error-bars) and model galaxies (small circles)\nversus galaxy MV . The dotted line indicates the slope of the\ngalaxy colour-magnitude relation for Coma galaxies from Bower\net al. (1992). Bottom panel: Same for V \u2212 I colours.\nthe GCs. Compare this to the colour-magnitude (C-M) re-\nlation found for Coma cluster galaxies by Bower, Lucey, &\nEllis (1992), indicated by the dotted line in the top panel of\nFigure 12. The lack of a significant colour gradient amongst\nthe red GCs is seemingly a manifestation of the inability of\nthe semi-analytic models (including galform) to naturally\nreproduce the observed C-M relation of galaxies. Whilst at\nthe lowest luminosities (MV \u2013 5 log h \u2265 \u201319.0), the slope\nof the C-M relation is recovered (e.g. see figures 10 & 13 of\nCole et al. 2000), above this the mean galaxian metallicities\nreach a peak beyond which chemical enrichment does not\nproceed further. This precludes any increase in the mean\ngalaxy colour, thereby giving rise to a flat (or even nega-\ntively sloped) C-M relation.\nSuch behaviour can be remedied by assuming extremely\nstrong feedback, as was shown by Kauffmann & Charlot\n(1998). However, adopting very large values for the feed-\nback efficiency yields unphysical results in other predictions\nof galform (see Cole et al. 2000 for details). This failure of\nthe semi-analytic models probably belies our lack of under-\nstanding of the complex processes of star formation, and is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n4.3 Bimodality\nOne of the motivations of this study is to reproduce the\nobserved bimodality of GC systems, and in doing so attempt\nto understand their physical origins. In \u00a7 2.2.2, we found\nthat it was necessary to truncate the blue GC formation\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 13\nFigure 13. The V \u2212I colour distributions for a selection of simu-\nlated GC systems. The values at the bottom of each plot indicate\nthe V -band magnitude (MV \u2013 5 log h) of each galaxy. The dis-\ntributions show a wide variety of morphologies, from principally\nblue-peaked, to bimodal, to strongly red-peaked.\nat early times (i.e. z = 5) in order to reproduce GC colour\ndistributions similar to those which are observed.\nIn spite of this enforced truncation of the blue GCs,\nthe colour distributions of the entire GC systems show an\nappreciable variation in their morphologies. We show a se-\nlection of V \u2212 I colour distributions for our simulated GC\nsystems in Figure 13. The galaxy GC systems are ordered by\ndescending host galaxy magnitude (from the bottom left to\ntop right in the figure). The colour distributions range from\nbimodal (e.g. the elliptical with MV \u2013 5 log h = \u201323.19),\nto predominantly blue-peaked (e.g.MV \u2013 5 log h = \u201322.94)\nand predominantly red-peaked (e.g.MV \u2013 5 log h = \u201320.29).\nThe elliptical with MV \u2013 5 log h = \u201320.55 shows a number\nof GCs with 0.5 \u2264 V \u2212 I \u2264 0.8. This is the result of sev-\neral recent mergers between this galaxy and satellites, which\ngives rise to significant star formation accompanied by GC\nformation.\nIn order to make a fair comparison between the GC\ncolour distributions predicted by our model, and those ob-\nserved, we must restrict our analysis of bimodality to some\nsub-sample of the GC population. Taking the study of Geb-\nhardt & Kissler-Patig (1999) as being representative of a\n\u2019typical\u2019 HST observation of a GC system, we return to\nour bimodal prototype galaxy NGC 4472. From two HST\npointings, these authors identified 486 GCs out of a total\npopulation of \u223c 6400 GCs (Geisler, Lee, & Kim 1996), thus\nsampling approximately 8% of the total GC population of\nthis galaxy. Whilst subsequent studies have gone deeper for\nthis galaxy, and\/or have increased pointings (e.g. Puzia et al.\nFigure 14. The DIP statistic and mean colours of our model GC\nsystems. Top left: DIP statistic for our simulated HST observa-\ntions (solid lines), compared to the data of Gebhardt & Kissler-\nPatig (1999; dotted lines). Top right: Distribution of the DIP\nstatistic for the complete model GC systems of each elliptical.\nBottom right: mean V \u2212 I colours of the complete model GC sys-\ntems and bottom left: mean V \u2212 I colours of our simulated HST\nobservations (solid lines), compared to the data of Gebhardt &\nKissler-Patig (1999; dotted lines).\n1999; Lee & Kim 2000; Larsen et al. 2001), we take the data\nof Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig (1999) as a lower limit.\nTo simulate these observations, we take a random dis-\ntribution of GCs corresponding \u223c 8% of each GC system.\nWe then assign each of these GCs a luminosity, drawn ran-\ndomly from an observed luminosity function. Specifically,\nthe luminosity function adopted is that of NGC 4472, taken\nfrom Puzia et al. (1999). Finally, we assign photometric er-\nrors to each GCs colour (see Appendix A in Carney & Harris\n2001):\n\u03c3phot \u2243 2.5\u00d7 log\n(\n1 +\n1\n(S\/N)\n)\n(5)\nwhere S\/N is the signal-to-noise and \u03c3phot the photometric\nuncertainty.\nTo look for the presence of multiple populations in re-\nstricted datasets, statistical tests such as the KMM test\n(Ashman, Bird, & Zepf 1994) and the \u2019DIP statistic\u2019\n(e.g. Hartigan & Hartigan 1985; Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig\n1999) are often employed. The success of such tests nec-\nessarily depend, among other things, upon the size of the\ndataset considered. To place our results on a more quan-\ntitative footing, we have measured the DIP statistic and\nmean colours of the colour distributions of our full GC sam-\nple and simulated HST observations. The DIP statistic is\na non-parametric test whose null hypothesis is that a dis-\ntribution is unimodal (see Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig 1999).\nA value near 0.5 indicates likely \u2019uni-modality\u2019, whereas 1.0\nindicates the presence of multiple sub-populations (not nec-\n14 M.A. Beasley et al.\nessarily bimodality, although for our model this is assumed\nto be the case).\nWe show the results of these statistical measures in Fig-\nure 14. The left-hand panels in the figure show the results\nfor our simulated HST observations, compared to the scaled\ndata from Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig (1999). The right-hand\npanels in the indicate the results for our unrestricted model\nGC systems.\nFigure 14 indicates that both the model HST observa-\ntions and data are distributed in a similar manner, with a\nlarge \u2019spike\u2019 at 0.5 (uni-modality), and a somewhat smaller\none at 1.0 (multi-modality), coupled with a relatively flat\ndistribution of DIP values in between. The model predicts a\nslightly higher fraction of GC systems lying at DIP 0.8 \u223c 0.9\nthan is the case for the HST data. Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig\n(1999) separated their data into three groups, those galax-\nies which showed a clear deviation from uni-modality, those\nwhich had DIP values higher than 0.5 at greater than 1\u03c3\nsignificance and galaxies which appeared to have unimodal\nGC systems. We have performed the same division on our\ndata, using the same definitions as Gebhardt & Kissler-Patig\n(1999). We define \u2019certain\u2019 as systems which are deemed bi-\nmodal by the DIP statistic, \u2019likely\u2019 as likely bimodal, and\n\u2019unimodal\u2019 as those GC systems which do not appear bi-\nmodal.\nFrom our 450 GC systems, we obtain a relative frac-\ntion (certain : likely : unimodal) of 86 : 118 : 246, or 19%\n: 26% : 55%. These values are similar to the Gebhardt &\nKissler-Patig results, which comprise of 21% : 26% : 53%.\nHowever, we find that these values are extremely sensitive\nto the model \u2019photometric errors\u2019 which we adopt. Increas-\ning the mean uncertainties by only 0.01 mag in V \u2212I , yields\na ratio of 16% : 25% : 59% (i.e. more bimodal systems are\nhidden by photometric errors), likewise, reducing the uncer-\ntainties by 0.01 mag results in a 24% : 30% : 45% split. This\nsensitivity to photometric errors is probably the origin of the\ndifferent measures of bimodality for the same GC systems\nbetween different studies.\nHowever, by obtaining the DIP statistic for our unre-\nstricted GC systems (right-hand panels in Figure 14), we\nfind that 93% are intrinsically bimodal in V \u2212 I . Of the re-\nmainder, 4% fall into the \u2019likely\u2019 category and 3% are not\nbimodal.\u2021 The majority of these latter 32 galaxies have less\nthan 20 GCs in their total GC system, and small-number\nstatistics become the dominant factor in determining the\npresence of sub-populations in these systems. Five galaxies\n(1% of the total) have undergone recent mergers coupled\nwith the formation of GCs, which conspire to superimpose\nthe red and blue GC sub-populations upon each other, giv-\ning apparently unimodal distributions in V \u2212I . When exam-\nined in V \u2212K colours, three of these systems appear bimodal\n(the other two are effectively present-day mergers, and there-\nfore even the V \u2212K colours are extremely blue). Thus, in our\nmodel, the GC systems of nearly all large elliptical galax-\nies are intrinsically bimodal in broad-band colours, which\n\u2021 The DIP statistic is somewhat more conservative than some\nother statistical methods for detecting bimodality in datasets.\nApplying the homoscedastic (a common covariance) KMM test\nto our results indicates that 96% of the model GC systems are\nnot unimodal at high confidence.\nFigure 15. The distribution in mean ages for all 450 model GC\nsystems. Top panel: Distribution in look-back time for the red\nGCs (dark shaded histogram) and blue GCs (light shaded his-\ntogram).

Bottom panel: Distribution in\nformation redshift for the red and blue GCs.\nis detectable if the total GC population can be \u2019observed\u2019.\nIt then follows that since nearly every non-detection of bi-\nmodality (from an intrinsically bimodal parent distribution)\nis attributable to photometric errors and\/or small-number\nstatistics, (irrespective of whether our model is correct or\nnot), any conclusions relating to the colour distributions\nof GC systems obtained from observations of only limited\ndepth and spatial extent should be made cautiously.\nThe bottom-left panel of Figure 14 compares the bi-\nweight estimate of the position (sample mean) of the V \u2212 I\npeaks of the simulated HST observations and observational\ndata. The position of the peaks are similar, with V \u2212I = 1.09\nand V \u2212I = 1.05 for model and data respectively, whilst the\ndistribution in the model colours is slightly narrower than\nthat of these data, with \u03c3rms = 0.049 and \u03c3rms = 0.052 re-\nspectively (the HST data has been scaled by a factor of \u223c\n9 in the figure). For the unrestricted model GC systems,\nthe mean V \u2212 I colours is 1.06, with a dispersion of 0.035\nmag. The relatively narrow distribution of these colours in-\ndicates that the mean of the GC colour distributions is fairly\ninsensitive to the varied merger histories of the individual\ngalaxies.\n4.4 Ages of the Globular Clusters\nA key observational test of the various models for the for-\nmation of GC systems lies in determining their age. In\nour model, we know the formation redshift of each GC,\nand therefore we can look at the age distributions of GCs\namongst our galaxy sample.\nIn Figure 15 we show the mean age (look-back time)\nand formation redshift distributions for our model GCs (the\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 15\nFigure 16. The mean ages of the red GCs as a function of host\ngalaxy properties. Top left panel: Mean ages of the red GCs\nas a function of host galaxy absolute magnitude.

Bottom right panel: Histogram of the mean\nred GC ages, separated into field\/group and cluster environments.\nThe histogram for the field\/group galaxies has been scaled by a\nfactor of 5 for display purposes.\ncosmological parameters adopted are given in Table 1). Per-\nhaps the most striking feature in the figure is the narrow\nrange of mean ages occupied by the blue GCs, at \u223c 12.3\nGyr (top panel). This mean age for the blue GCs is con-\nsistent with the \u2019favourite\u2019 age of Galactic GCs found by\nCarretta et al. (2000) of 12.9 \u00b1 2.9 Gyr. Whilst the onset of\nblue GC formation begins as soon as enough gas cools to be-\ngin forming stars (at z \u223c 11; c.f. Figure 3) the vast majority\nof blue GCs form at or around our truncation redshift.\nThe red GCs clearly form over a more extended period,\nwith mean redshifts of formation from z \u223c 4 to the present\nday. However, red GCs begin to form in small numbers at\nz = 9 \u223c 10 during the onset of PGD merging (e.g Figure 3).\nThe mean ages of the red GCs occurs at 9 Gyr (z \u223c 2),\nalthough the skewed nature of the age distribution means\nthat the peak of red GC formation actually occurs \u223c 10\nGyr ago. This gap in the formation redshifts of the blue and\nred GCs is key to the metallicity differences between the\nGCs. The material fed-back to the interstellar medium after\nthe first period of GC formation has time to cool and form\nGCs through merging at a later epoch.\nThe short duration of the blue GC formation makes\ncomparisons of their ages with other galaxy properties dif-\nficult. Moreover, the mean ages of the blue GCs are clearly\nsensitive to the exact redshift of their truncation. However,\nthis is not the case for the red GCs, which form over a sig-\nnificant fraction of a Hubble time. In Figure 16, we show the\nmean ages of the red GCs as a function of their host galaxy\nmagnitude and halo velocity dispersion. The behaviour of\nmean ages of the red GCs with host galaxy luminosity and\nhalo velocity dispersion are very similar. The highest lumi-\nnosity galaxies, and those galaxies in the highest \u03c31D haloes\nboth give rise to red GCs with ages \u223c 10 Gyr, with small\nscatter. In proceeding to lower luminosities (and lower \u03c31D),\nthis scatter in mean age increases sharply, with a tendency\nfor the GCs to possess younger ages.\nIn the bottom panels of the figure, we show histograms\nof the mean GC ages separated by their host galaxy prop-\nerties, according to our definitions given in \u00a7 2.2.3. We find\nthat the red GCs associated with low-luminosity ellipticals\nhave mean ages of 8.8 Gyr (\u03c3rms = 1.4 Gyr), whereas for the\nhigh-luminosity galaxies the mean age of the GC systems is\n10.0 Gyr (\u03c3rms = 0.8 Gyr). Similarly, the GC systems asso-\nciated with ellipticals in the field and\/or groups have mean\nages of 7.9 Gyr (\u03c3rms = 1.7 Gyr), whilst those in clusters\nhave mean ages of 9.2 Gyr (\u03c3rms = 1.3 Gyr). Clearly, these\nvalues will change depending upon the exact nature of the\ndefinitions of \u2019low-luminosity elliptical\u2019 or the field\/group\nand cluster environments, however the general trends will\nremain.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThere now seems little doubt that GCs are formed dur-\ning the merging and interaction of galaxies which involve\nstar formation (e.g. Schweizer 2001). In this regard a metal-\nrich GC component arises naturally in a hierarchical model\nsuch as galform, which predicts many such mergers over\na broad distribution of redshifts. However, to what degree\nthese merger-formed GCs contribute to the red peak associ-\nated with the GC populations of elliptical galaxies is uncer-\ntain.\nIn our scheme, continuous gaseous merging produces\nthe entire red GC sub-population observed in ellipticals,\nand the ages of these GCs directly reflect the redshifts at\nwhich their host galaxy underwent major mergers involving\nstar formation. In this way, the red GCs represent a direct\nprobe of the dynamical and stellar assembly of their host\ngalaxies. As shown previously, the red GC sub-populations\nof our model ellipticals possess significant age structure in\nany given galaxy. Moreover, the scatter in this age structure\nis predicted to increase with decreasing host-galaxy lumi-\nnosity and decreasing dark matter halo velocity dispersion,\nreflecting the occurrence of later star formation in these less-\nmassive haloes. This is a principal result of this study, and\nprovides a method of testing our simulations against other\nscenarios for forming the GC systems of luminous elliptical\ngalaxies.\nIn the in-situ collapse model of Forbes, Brodie, & Grill-\nmair (1997), two phases of galaxy collapse give rise to two\nGC populations enriched to significantly different levels. The\nfirst collapse produces metal-poor GCs with high efficiency\nwith respect field stars, followed at some later time by a sec-\nondary collapse where the majority of the galaxy stars and\nmetal-rich GCs are created. In common with our model,\nthe metal-poor GCs are predicted to be several Gyr older\nthan the red GCs, with the exact age difference depend-\ning upon the delay between the two collapses. If this delay\n16 M.A. Beasley et al.\nhas a characteristic time-scale, such as that for the onset of\ntype-I supernovae, then the age difference between the GC\nsub-populations is expected to be similar for galaxies irre-\nspective of galaxy luminosity and halo velocity dispersion.\nMoreover, the metal-rich GCs are will be essentially coeval,\nsince the time-scale for the secondary collapse is expected\nto be short.\nCote, Marzke, & West (1998) presented a model where\nthe metal-poor GCs are captured from the surrounding\ngalaxy population via tidal stripping and\/or mergers, and\nthe red GCs are somehow intrinsic to the host elliptical, in\ncommon with the in-situ model. These authors found that\nby adopting a relatively steep luminosity function of galax-\nies in the host galaxy cluster, the bimodality of GC metal-\nlicities could be reproduced without necessarily requiring\ntwo phases of star formation. Whilst Cote, Marzke, & West\n(1998) do not discuss in detail the possible mechanism for\nthe formation of either GC sub-population, they do predict\nthat there will exist no significant age differences between\nthe GC sub-populations.\nIn many respects, the model presented here closely fol-\nlows the original philosophy behind the Ashman & Zepf\n(1992) merger model. Merging creates metal-rich GCs,\nwhilst the merger progenitors contribute their own popu-\nlation of metal-poor GCs to the final GC system. Since the\nspiral-spiral mergers of Ashman & Zepf (1992) are expected\nto occur at relatively high redshift, it may be argued that\nthe distinction between the proto-galactic discs in our model\nand gaseous spirals in the Ashman & Zepf picture becomes\nill defined.\nHowever, although it might be tempting to associate\nthese PGDs with the precursors of todays spiral galaxies,\nthis is not the case. In the semi-analytic model as presented\nby Cole et al. (2000), spiral galaxies form through the accre-\ntion of cold gas onto bulges. Providing no further merging\noccurs, this gas will settle and remain in a stellar\/gas disc.\nA large initial bulge mass with respect to the mass of ac-\ncreted cold gas will correspond to an early-type spiral, and a\nless-massive bulge will correspond to a later-type spiral. An\nobvious extension of our model will be to study the GC sys-\ntems of late-type galaxies, however the implication is clear:\nin our model, the bulges of spirals are formed in the same\nmanner as those of ellipticals. Therefore, the metal-rich GCs\nin spirals are associated with the bulge and\/or thick disc, and\nthe majority of spiral galaxies will have bimodal GC metallic-\nity distributions. This notion that the GCs of ellipticals and\nspirals have essentially the same origin finds observational\nsupport in the recent study of Forbes, Brodie, & Larsen\n(2001).\nIn our simulations, the progenitors of the blue GCs are\nexponential, proto-galactic discs, which at high redshifts,\nare largely gaseous. For example, at z \u223c 5, these PGDs\nhave mean cold gas-fractions of order 95%. We assume that\nthese PGDs form, and continue to form, blue GCs (prior to\nour truncation redshift) unless they merge with the central\ngalaxy in the dark matter halo. As suggested by Ashman &\nBird (1993), it is then not difficult to imagine that any such\nPGDs which failed to merge are now represented by dwarf\ngalaxies (e.g. the LMC), which have only managed to form\nmetal-poor, blue GCs.\nObservationally, perhaps the best candidates for such\nproto-galactic entities are damped Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs),\nhigh-redshift H i systems with column densities NH i \u2265 2\u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122, seen in absorption against background QSOs\n(e.g.Wolfe 1988). Burgarella, Kissler-Patig, & Buat (2001)\nhave recently discussed the possible relation between metal-\npoor GCs and DLAs at high redshift. Prochaska & Wolfe\n(1997, 1998), have argued that the observed high velocity\nwidths (\u223c 300 kms\u22121) and asymmetry of DLA line-profiles\nare indicative of a population of rapidly rotating thick discs,\nwhich are incompatible with the slowly rotating exponen-\ntial discs modelled in semi-analytic schemes (see Kauffmann\n1996). However, Haehnelt, Steinmetz, & Rauch (1998) show\nthat the same observations can be reproduced by modelling\nDLAs as gaseous systems which are supported by a mixture\nof random motions, merging, infall and rotation (see also\nMaller et al. 1999; Ma & Shu 2001). Such agglomerations,\nwith virial velocities of \u223c 100 kms\u22121, are consistent with\nthe PGD kinematics assumed in galform.\nIn creating the metal-poor GCs, we found it necessary\nto truncate blue GC formation in PGDs at high redshift, in\nsomething of an ad-hoc manner. Since this occurs when the\ngas surface-densities of these PGDs are still high and rapidly\nforming \u2019unbound\u2019 stars. it begs the question what physical\nmechanism could possibly halt GC formation so abruptly?\nOne possibility arises from the cosmic re-ionisation\n(e.g. see van den Bergh 2001). At some point in the early\nUniverse, gas cooled and began forming stars, providing\nenough UV flux to ionise the neutral inter-galactic medium\n(e.g Loeb & Barkana 2001). Recent studies of QSO absorp-\ntion systems have possibly now constrained the onset of this\nre-ionisation to be 5 \u2264 z \u2264 6 (Fan et al. 2000; Becker et\nal. 2001; Djorgovski et al. 2001). Cen (2001) has suggested\nthat such an external radiation field is sufficient to compress\nhaloes of mass \u2264 107.5M\u2299, thereby forming self-gravitating\nbaryonic systems, under the proviso that such haloes have\nlow initial angular momentum. By assuming that such sys-\ntems fragment and form stars, Cen (2001) shows that these\nstellar systems will have characteristic masses and sizes con-\nsistent with metal-poor GCs.\nWhilst plausible, this explanation is rather unsatisfac-\ntory. Given our current knowledge that GCs are forming\nin a wide range of star-forming environments, the assertion\nthat the formation of metal-poor GCs is somehow a \u2019special\u2019\nprocess in the early Universe seems somewhat contrived.\nPerhaps a more self-consistent picture of GC formation is\nsuggested by the study of Larsen & Richtler (2000). These\nauthors found that the efficiency of star cluster formation\nis a function of the local SFR in spiral discs, implying that\nthe efficiency of GC formation may generically depend upon\nthe rate of star formation in their host galaxy. In this way,\nGCs may represent the long-lived tracers of the peaks of\nthe cosmic SFR, occurring in relatively un-evolved PGDs\nat high redshift. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of this\nstudy, we found that an \u01eb \u221d SFR relation fails to reproduce a\nmetal-poor GC component anything like that observed. This\narises because the SFR in our model peaks at z = 1 \u223c 2,\nrather than at the required z > 5 (i.e. greater than our blue\nGC truncation redshift).\nHowever, whilst contemporary observations of the cos-\nmic SFR indicate that it reaches a peak at z \u2264 2 (e.g. see\ncompilation of Blain et al. 1999), its behaviour at higher red-\nshifts (z > 4) is relatively unconstrained (Loeb & Barkana\n2001). Barkana & Loeb (2000) found from CDM simulations\nOn the Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in a Hierarchical Universe 17\nthat the comoving SFR should exhibit a distinct decrease\naround the re-ionisation redshift (e.g. see their figure 1, for\nthe case of zreion = 7). A higher SFR at such redshifts could\nplausibly give rise to the formation of significant numbers of\nblue GCs.\n6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have outlined a scheme for forming the globular cluster\n(GC) systems of elliptical galaxies within the framework of\na semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. Our principal\nresults are as follows:\n\u2022 we can reproduce the observed bimodal colour distri-\nbutions of GC systems associated with elliptical galaxies\nby assuming i) metal-rich globular clusters are formed dur-\ning gaseous mergers and ii) metal-poor GCs are formed in\ngaseous proto-galactic discs, and this formation is truncated\nat z \u223c 5.\n\u2022 gaseous mergers which lead to the formation of metal-\nrich GCs and field stars do not significantly effect the total\nSN of the host elliptical galaxy. This remains true even if a\nrelatively high formation efficiency is assumed (\u01ebred = 0.007,\nassuming no dynamical destruction of the GCs occurs.)\n\u2022 the number of GCs (NGC) scales with host galaxy lu-\nminosity (LV,gal) as NGC \u221d L1.25V,gal. This arises due to an\nincreasing M\/L ratio of the simulated ellipticals with lu-\nminosity. This is consistent with observations of luminous\n\u2019normal\u2019 ellipticals, but inconsistent with observations of the\nhighest-SN galaxies.\n\u2022 the mean colours of both the metal-rich and metal-poor\nGCs weakly correlate with the magnitude of the host galaxy,\na result is consistent with the current observations.\n\u2022 the mean colours of the metal-rich GCs are very similar\nto the mean colours of their host galaxy. The colours of\nthe metal-poor GCs are significantly bluer than their host\ngalaxy, corresponding to a metallicity difference of \u223c 1.0\ndex. This is consistent with contemporary observations.\n\u2022 we find that 93% of the simulated GC systems are in-\ntrinsically bimodal. However, whether this is \u2019detected\u2019 in\nbroad-band colours is extremely sensitive to sample size,\nphotometric uncertainties, and to a lesser extent, the sta-\ntistical test employed to detect sub-populations.\n\u2022 the metal-poor GCs have mean ages of \u223c 12 Gyr, whilst\nthe metal-rich GCs have mean ages of \u223c 9 Gyr. The age\nrange of the metal-rich GCs in the majority of individual\ngalaxies is large (5 \u223c 12 Gyr). This age range increases for\nlow-luminosity ellipticals, and for ellipticals in lower mass\ndark matter haloes.\nWe have found that by assuming GC formation oc-\ncurs contemporaneously with unbound star formation, two\nphases of GC formation are required to produce the ob-\nserved GC systems of elliptical galaxies. Hierarchical merg-\ning at high redshift results in a metal-rich peak consistent\nwith observations, if the metal-rich GC formation efficiency\nis \u223c 0.7 % by stellar mass. Formation of the metal-poor peak\nrequires less efficient (\u223c 0.2 %) GC formation in low-mass\nhaloes at z \u2265 5. Models which represent a synthesis of star\nformation, galaxy formation and cosmology will be required\nto determine their origin.\nThe decoupling of the formation of the metal-poor GCs\nfrom the galaxy stars at high redshift implies that they are\nnot direct probes of the galaxy star formation. Rather, the\nmetal-poor GCs follow the star formation in relatively un-\nenriched gas associated with low-mass haloes at early times\n(e.g. Ashman & Bird 1993). In contrast, the metal-rich GCs\ndirectly trace the merger history of their host galaxy when-\never star formation occurs. Therefore, the metal-rich GCs\nare remnants of both star formation at later times, and the\ndynamical assembly of their host galaxies through merging.\nWe suggest that the metal-rich GCs provide a key to probing\nthe formation epoch of elliptical galaxies.\n7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Brad Gibson, Bill Harris, Gretchen\nHarris and the anonymous referee for extremely useful com-\nments regarding this paper.
