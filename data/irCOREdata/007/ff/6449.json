Paperback, 87 pages, \u00a313.99.\nMost people involved in teaching and learning\nwill have a number of Websites that they use in\norder to store and disseminate electronic\nmaterials. In my own case, for example, I have a\nresearch Website, several personal sites, an\norganizational Web location and several intra-\nnets. I use the latter for providing controlled\naccess to both my teaching and learning mater-\nials and my library of 'cherished' electronic\ndocuments. Increasingly, as people move from\npaper-based to electronic writing, there will be a\ngrowing need actively to promote those sites that\nthey feel are important for other people to know\nabout. This useful 'little book' by Martin Ken-\nprovides a number of helpful suggestions for\nachieving this.\nThe book is organized into nine short chapters,\nan appendix and a glossary. Following on from\nthe author's introduction, the first chapter ('Why\nPromote?') goes through a list of reasons for\npromoting a particular Web site and discusses\nthe need to identify the particular audiences at\nwhich a promotional campaign should be\ndirected. The second chapter deals with 'the\npromotional strategy cycle' and then goes on to\noutline a 'toolkit' to support the activities\ninvolved. In Chapter 3, the author discusses\nvarious topics relating to how Web pages are\nindexed. Designers of Web pages need to know\nabout these topics so that they can design their\nHTML code in a way that makes a particular\npage 'jump out' of a database and climb to the\nhighest positions in the list of search results.\nConsiderable emphasis is given here to the\nappropriate selection of keywords for use with\nthe HTML <META> tags. As well as relying on\nsearch engines and spiders to index a Website,\nanother useful way of making a site known is by\ndirect submission of its URL to a 'submitting\nservice'. This approach is discussed in Chapter 4.\nSome of the other useful promotional tech-\nniques that are described in this book include:\nnegotiating reciprocal links, using Web ring\nservices, email and permission marketing, press\nreleases and direct advertising - using techniques\nsuch as banner adverts and portals. Of course,\nonce a promotional strategy has been decided\nupon and implemented, it is important to assess\nhow effective that strategy has been. Throughout\nthis book the author emphasizes the need\nactively to measure the effect that any given\npromotional approach has on a site's search\nengine 'ranking'. Because of the importance of\nthis topic, in the final chapter of the book\n('Monitoring and Measurement') the author\ndiscusses this issue in greater depth. He outlines\nvarious tools for measuring site activity and\ninterpreting statistics relating to a site's search\nengine rankings.\nOverall, I found this short monograph extremely\nuseful. Not only does it provide a wealth of\nhelpful tips and techniques, it also contains\n105\nReviews\nmany amusing anecdotes about the 'tricks' (both\nfair and foul!) that people get up to in order to\ngain a promotional advantage with respect to\ngetting to the top of a search engine's hit list.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nElaine England and Andy Finney, Managing\nMultimedia Project Management for Interactive\nMedia, Harlow: Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-201-\n36058-6. Paperback and CD-ROM, 423 pages,\n\u00a327.95.\nThis book represents an unusually detailed and\nup-to-date account of the processes required for\nthe successful management and delivery of\nmultimedia projects. Drawing upon their extens-\nive experience in the field, the authors provide a\nlogical account of every step in identifying,\nresourcing and managing the development of\ninteractive media throughout the project\nlifecycle. Acknowledging that there is no such\nthing as a 'typical' multimedia project, not least\nbecause the underlying technologies are\nconstantly changing, the' authors still succeed in\nproviding a text that should be required reading\nfor any aspiring multimedia manager.\nAdmittedly such praise is borne partly out of the\ndistinct lack of similar guides in the field and\nthis excellent book still has its weaknesses.\nPerhaps the greatest failing is that the book\nattempts the practically impossible - to provide\nan authoritative discussion of an enormous,\nmultifaceted subject area in a single text. Of\nmoderate length - 423 pages - the eager reader is\ninitially engaged in sections such as 'What is\nmultimedia' and 'Project manager's responsib-\nilities'. This is where the true worth of this book\nlies - topics such as this are rarely discussed with\nadequate explanation for the beginner and\nsufficient detail to be of practical benefit. In this\nrespect the authors deserve our thanks. However\nsubsequent chapters of the book focus on the\nproduction of assets in different multimedia\nprojects, including audio, video and graphics.\n'Graphics asset production' for example only\nwarrants 19 pages. Experienced readers will\nquickly recognize the superficiality of these\nchapters, but there is a risk that the enthusiastic\nbut inexperienced student, or perhaps even the\nestablished manager moving into the field, might\ntreat these chapters with the same respect and\nconsideration as previous chapters. Perhaps this\napparent disparity in chapter content is a\nconsequence of dual authorship.\n106\nThe book is divided into twenty chapters.\nFollowing a worthy introduction, the reader is\nrapidly brought up to speed on issues surrounding\nthe manager-client relationship in chapters such\nas 'Scoping a project', \"The proposal' and\n'Contract issues'. Subsequent chapters acknow-\nledge the importance of a properly selected and\nmanaged project team. Following the afore-\nmentioned brief description of issues surrounding\nthe acquisition, manipulation and use of audio,\nvideo and graphics assets, the authors conclude\nthe book with three chapters entitled 'Testing',\n'Archiving' and 'Marketing and marketing\nresearch'. These relatively short chapters can only\nfacilitate somewhat superficial discussion of these\nimportant issues. Fortunately the authors usually\nremain focused on the subject of 'project\nmanagement for interactive media', so ensuring\nthat their comments and observations, however\nbrief, are worthy of attention. In most cases the\nrecommended reading lists that accompany each\nchapter are also useful.\nThe book is also accompanied by a CD-ROM\nthat claims to be both a companion to, and an\nextension of, the book itself. Reflecting the\npracticality of content throughout the entire\npublication, the authors have avoided producing\nthe companion CD-ROM in a particularly high-\ntech format. Instead of exploiting the latest\nauthoring software - duly discussed elsewhere in\nthe book - the authors have chosen to deliver\nthis content as an HTML document. This mode\nof delivery ensures the broadest compatibility\nwith users' computers and conveniently serves to\nillustrate some of the production issues\ndiscussed in the text. Rather surprisingly, there is\na persistent (yet easily rectified) problem with\nthe positioning of the interactive menu\nthroughout the CD-ROM's contents.\nThe CD-ROM contains a variety of additional\nmaterials to illustrate the book's text. For\nexample, the support materials for Chapter 8,\n'Selecting the media and techniques: the\ntreatment' entitled \"Theory into practice'\ninclude a hypothetical tutorial on changing a car\nwindscreen wiper blade. The reader is asked to\ncompare the relative merits of alternative\nmethods of electronic delivery. These range from\na series of static diagrammatic images (with\nwhich most amateur mechanics are familiar!) to\nan animation with accompanying soundtrack.\nElsewhere on the CD-ROM there resides a\nvariety of useful document templates, such as\ncontracts, licence agreements, project checklists\nand questionnaires. These, together with an\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nextensive hyperlinked glossary mean that the\nCD-ROM is genuinely useful. The authors even\ninvite users to customize the interactive contents\npage, acknowledging the practical value of this\nparticular resource to teachers in the field.\nFinally the book has an associated Website\n(http:llwww.atsf.co.uklmanmultf) which supplies\nadditional resources and which will provide you\nwith a greater insight into the book's scope and\ncontents than possible in this review.\nA final (very minor) gripe: in my opinion the\nbook's cover fails to distinguish it from the ever\nexpanding range of computer books on sale in\nyour local bookshop. This is a shame, because\nwhilst dealing with an undeniably specialist\nsubject, by providing practical advice and insiders'\ntips for designers, producers and programmers in\ntoday's multimedia industry, this book deserves\nthe attention of anyone with more than a passing\ninterest in the application of modern\ncommunications and information technologies.\nBrian Boullier, University of Bradford\nMichael Potts, An A to Z of Training and\nDevelopment, London: Kogan Page, ISBN:\n0-7494-2563-6. Hardback, 284 pages, \u00a340.00.\nThis A to Z of Training and Development states on\nthe flyleaf that it is 'the essential reference book\nfor anyone involved in training and development'.\nFurthermore, the author 'sets out to give a\nconcise explanation and guide to the many facets\nof training and development in an organisation'.\nMichael Potts has indeed succeeded in presenting\na large number (in excess of 300) of related and\nrelevant topics that can be easily accessed.\nThe 'A to Z', as its name implies, is laid out\nalphabetically and contains 22 chapters. The\ncontents section is detailed, listing each main and\nsub-topic. Where these are discussed as part of a\nlarger subject, re-difection is clearly indicated\nwithin the main text. Alternatively, direct access is\nprovided from the comprehensive index. That so\nmany topics are covered in a book of 273 pages\nindicates that coverage is by no means exhaustive;\nrather the information given is an overview. A\nhigh proportion of the text consists of bullet\npoints, with these and the narrative being\naugmented with tabular information, example\nforms and a few simple black and white diagrams.\nThree loose divisions of information can be\nmade with respect to the contents. First, details\nare provided about many existing European and\nUK government organizations (often including\ncontact addresses), programmes and initiatives.\nSecond, current legislation is summarized and\noccasionally specific case references are cited.\nThird, practical advice and instruction are given\nregarding training and staff development issues,\nthis being the largest division.\nOrganizations range from the European Social\nFund to the Training and Enterprise National\nCouncil. General initiatives such as those of the\nEuropean Commission are only touched upon,\nwhile national programmes and initiatives\nincluding Investors in People (IIP) and National\nEducation and Training Targets are afforded a\nlittle more detail. Some of the sources of\nfunding for training that are briefly covered\ninclude Career Development Loans and Small\nFirm Trading Loans. Information regarding\nnational courses is quite detailed and includes\nNational Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and\nGeneral NVQs, the Scottish Vocational Quali-\nfications, modern apprenticeships and trainee-\nships and the Youth Training Scheme.\nInformation pertaining to relevant legislation\nhas been carefully edited in order to ensure\ncoverage of the most important aspects. Statutes\nand regulations upon which focus is greatest\ninclude disability, racial and sexual discrimina-\ntion, equal opportunities (with cases cited as\nexamples), trade union rights (including those\nfor employee representatives) and health and\nsafety regulations (particularly, regarding the use\nof equipment).\nThe training and staff development contents fall\nunder numerous headings. They do, however,\nshare an emphasis throughout the 'A to Z',\nnamely that they are an integral part of business\nand therefore are required to show an appropri-\nate return on investment. To this end there are a\nnumber of topics relating to the financial aspects\nof training, including budgets, possible levels of\nimprovement due to training input for top\nperformers, short-term plans and strategies for\nhuman resources. Methods of evaluation (both\nsummative and formative) are discussed together\nwith performance appraisals and guidelines are\nprovided for quantifying gains in terms of\nincreased production levels. Qualitative benefits,\ndue to appropriate training and. staff develop-\nment initiatives, such as improved morale, com-\nmunication and motivation are discussed,\nalthough these again are, where possible, viewed\nin monetary terms. Assessment of training needs\nis covered within the topics of designing,\nidentifying and strategy, each being based upon\n107\nReviews\ndetails determined by the differences between the\nrequirements of the job and the knowledge and\nskills of the employee. Practical advice for\nspecifying the standards and objectives of a\nparticular position is given, including a section\non management development that emphasizes a\ndifferent focus in training for the more senior\nemployees. Techniques for analysing skills\ninclude the use of competency check lists and\npsychometric tests. The latter, as the author\npoints out, are expensive and usually require\nspecially trained staff to implement, but do tend\nto have evidential levels of reliability and\nvalidity, which in-house checks may lack.\nThe required outcome, subject taught, particular\nemployee and costs are factors that need to be\nconsidered when assessing the type of training\nneeded. Training delivery should reflect the\ngroup's needs and the individual learning styles.\nLearners are considered to fall within one of\nfour classifications - activists, pragmatists,\nreflectors and theorists - and trainees should be\nencouraged to use all facets of learning, not just\nthe one they favour. A cycle of learning is\ndescribed. It encompasses experience, reflection,\nanalysis and planning, with learning occurring\nfrom reinforcement, feedback and observation.\nWho will be responsible for the training is also\nconsidered, as is the extensive administration\nrequirement for staff development. Some sample\nform templates are included.\nThe alphabetical nature of the contents does\nlead to some repetition of points where they are\nrelevant to more than one main topic and to the\nneed to read more than one section to gain an\noverview of a specific subject, for example,\ntraining evaluation. A feature that could be\nadded is a section of references to other, more\nin-depth sources of material. However, the book\nachieves its aim of providing an overview of a\nparticularly large subject and in this respect it\ncan be considered comprehensive for this\nmanner of coverage. It is a reference book that\nwill be of considerable use to those within the\nstaff development field.\nKate Garland, University of Bristol\nD. Bickerton and M. Gotti (eds.), Language\nCentre Integration through Innovation \u2014 Papers\nfrom the 5th CERCLES Conference, CERCLES,\nPlymouth: University of Plymouth, ISBN:\n1-84102-054-0. Paperback, 290 pages, \u00a312.00.\nLanguage Centres: Integration through Innova-\ntion is a collection of papers from the fifth\n108\nconference of the Confederation Europeenne\ndes Centres de Langues de l'Enseignement\nSuperieur (CERCLES). The conference was held\nin Bergamo in September 1998. The conference\ntheme 'integration through innovation' high-\nlights the main thrust of the papers collected\nhere, that the achievement of a trans-European\napproach to the learning of modern foreign\nlanguages will necessarily involve not only sound\nbut innovative approaches to language peda-\ngogy, but also an awareness of intercultural\nfactors that may impact on the learning\nenvironment.\nIn general the standard of the papers is quite\nhigh although the fact that the conference was\nheld in September 1998 does mean that some of\nthe information is a little dated. This takes away\nvery little from most of the papers, but does\nsuggest that interested readers may wish to\npursue references and contact information in\norder to see what further progress has been made\nin the intervening time.\nSimilarly, it is in the nature of such collections\nthat not all the papers will be uniformly\ninteresting to all readers. However, the book's\norganization lends itself to a selective approach\nto its contents. The collection contains seventeen\npapers divided into five sections: the innovative\nrole of language centres, cultural integration,\ninnovations in learning, innovative use of\ntechnology, and innovations in assessment.\nThe two papers in the first section, \"The Innovat-\nive Role of Language Centres', concentrate on\nthe potential of language centres to act as\nchange agents in support of a better integrated\nEurope. For example, Edith Esch in 'Centres de\nlangues: innovation pedagogique et integration\neuropeenne' finds that, despite their potential to\nsupport social and cultural integration, to date\ntheir contribution has been modest. Similarly,\nJohn Sinclair in 'New roles for language centres:\nthe mayonnaise problem' cautions that the many\ndiffering pressures on centres to adopt new roles\nmay lead to fragmentation, if, like an over-\nhastily prepared mayonnaise, progress is not\nmade carefully step by step.\nThe three papers in the second section, 'Cultural\nintegration', continue the inter-cultural theme.\nMaria Grazia Guido discusses the emergence of a\n'European English' as used by competent ESL\nspeakers that is a distinct subset of English\nperhaps not unlike 'American' or 'Australian'\nEnglish. Similarly Raffella Negretti reports on the\nanalysis of online conversation amongst ESL\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nstudents; while Michael 6 Diiill reports on a study\nof communication in German firms in Ireland.\nThe third section, 'Innovations in learning',\nagain contains three papers but the focus is more\nclearly on pedagogical issues. Marina Mozzon-\nMcPherson examines some aspects of the\npedagogical application of computer-mediated\ncommunication (CMC) in 'Encounters of a third\nkind: an analysis of the use of the computer-\nmediated environment in relation to learner\nautonomy'; while Franca Poppi considers the\nchanging role of the language teacher as an\nadviser or counsellor who directs a student's\nlearning. Finally in this section Marina Dossena\nreports on the use of electronic corpora in\nlanguage learning.\nThe next section, 'Innovative use of technology',\nis the largest section containing five papers.\nThese range from Evelyne Namenwirth's\nconsideration of the utility of the new techno-\nlogies through papers discussing multimedia\nauthoring tools (Brigitte Dold and Christine\nHoffman), the use of the Web (Gilles Couzin\nand Vita Falbo-EUis) to Tony Stenton's\narguments in favour of the in-house production\nof hypermedia resources to support language\nlearning. Although there is certainly some very\ninteresting work reported in this section, it is,\nunfortunately, the section that perhaps suffers\nmost from the delay between presentation and\nreview. Many of the technologies referred to\nhave significantly moved on in the two years\nsince these papers were presented.\nInterestingly, this is less true of the last section,\n'Innovations in assessment'. Although three of\nthe four papers in this section report on\ntechnologically moderated assessment issues and\nassessment technologies have advanced, the\ndifferences between now and 1998 are perhaps\nless pronounced in this area. Perhaps still more\nimportantly all three of the technologically\norientated papers in this section report on\nassessment tools being used for diagnostic\npurposes. Thus even where the technology may\nhave moved on the diagnostic strategies remain\nrelevant and interesting. For example, De\nGrigorio and Fischer report on the DIALANG\nproject which offers an Internet-mediated system\ndesigned to test levels of attainment in all of the\nEU's principle languages and thus aid students\nin achieving the EU's stated goal of proficiency\nin the three languages. Similarly, Carole\nRozzonelli's 'StartUP Entry Test: un logiciel de\ntests de niveau en langues' offers an approach to\nthe assessment of language proficiency. Ray\nSatchell's report on the BULCATES project, on\nthe other hand, looks at how the system\ndeveloped at Bristol University is integrated into\nthe language centre's pedagogical strategies.\nFinally, Stickler, Lewis and Speight in 'Taking\nstudents seriously, the use of self-assessment and\npeer-assessment on a University-Wide Language\nProgramme' provide a valuable analysis of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of formally inte-\ngrating student evaluation into the assessment\nprocess.\nBruce Ingraham, University of Teesside\nEta de Cicco, Mike Farmer and Claire Hargrave,\nActivities for Using the Internet in Primary\nSchools, London: Kogan Page, London: ISBN:\n0-7494-2989-5. Paperback, 181 pages, \u00a329.99.\nUsing the Internet is a particular challenge for\nprimary schools. Of concern to head teachers\nand class teachers are ethical, technical and\neducational issues. The presence of 'unsuitable\nmaterial' is well known and teachers seek ways\nof ensuring pupils do not access these. Unlike in\na secondary school, there may be limited\ntechnical expertise on hand and, consequently,\nthere is the need for an information source which\nis logically structured, clear and comprehensive\nin coverage. Also, while the Internet contains\nmuch that may be of value in primary schools,\nthe sheer quantity of sites can lead the\ninexperienced into the frustration of extended\nperiods of activity which is not fruitful.\nThis bright, well-structured and comprehensive\nguide is designed to meet the needs of primary\nteachers and, in the main, meets them well.\nNotably, the authors have tackled the issue of\ndisappearing and moving sites by maintaining\nan associated Website themselves which updates\nall the links published in the text.\nWith nine sections covering the main curriculum\nareas - literacy, numeracy and mathematics,\nscience, geography, history, science, design and\ntechnology, art, music and religious education -\nand an extensive technical section, this book\noffers a comprehensive guide and reference.\nEach section offers suggestions for suitable\nWebsites and how pupil activity can be built\naround the information found there. All pupil\nactivity is based on photocopiable worksheets.\nThis should prove very popular with teachers.\nAt the heart of the book are the curricular\nsections. Though mostly of good quality, there is\n109\nReviews\ninevitably variation. The history section, for\nexample, includes activities on Roman, Viking\nand Victorian Britain: all popular topics in\nprimary schools. A useful addition might have\nbeen the excellent Public Records Office site\nwhich is rich with pupil-level material on a wide\nrange of topics. The mathematics and science\nsections are particularly strong with, in the latter,\nactivities likely to promote meaningful and\nactive pupil involvement on plants and animals,\nmelting, teeth, flight and the solar system. The\nmathematics section looks very useful as a way\nof providing meaningful contexts and of offer-\ning pupils fun. Less impressive is the religious\neducation section which suggests few sites and\nwhich might have included reference to the very\nextensive set of links to Islamic sites held by the\nUniversity of Wales, Lampeter.\nThe technical section is full, with twenty-seven\nsub-sections covering topics from bookmarks to\nURLs. While much of this is more technical\nthan the majority of teachers would ever require,\nit makes sense to cover as many possibilities as\npossible.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the authors have not\nincluded a section offering advice on the avoid-\nance of 'unsuitable material'. While there are\nhelpful pieces of advice on such matters con-\ntained within the text of particular activities,\nmany readers would I am sure, have expected to\nbe able to go quickly to a discrete section which\nsummarizes the issues and which offers\nguidance.\nAccepting the inevitability of continuing change\nwhich will leave any printed text behind and the\nimpossibility of identifying all of the best sites,\nthis book offers primary teachers a timely and\nvery well-written guide to Internet use.\nJohn Robertson, University of Paisley\nAbby Day, John Peters and Phil Race, 500 Tips\nfor Developing a Learning Organisation, London:\nKogan Page, ISBN: 0-7494-2912-7. Paperback,\n125 pages, \u00a315.99.\nThe notion of the learning organization has\ncome to the fore in recent years, although the\ngeneral level of understanding of the character-\nistics of a learning organization appears to lag\nbehind the enthusiasm of the published\nadvocates. Part of the problem, no doubt, is that\nbusy managers are unable (or unwilling) to take\nthe time to understand in some depth the\nimplications of seeking to reposition their\n110\norganization as a learning organization, and I\nhave seen examples of what might be termed\n'management by in-flight magazine', where there\nis evidence that the headlines about 'the learning\norganization' have been assimilated but little else.\nHence this book is to be welcomed, since it\noffers considerably more than headlines and is a\nstorehouse of suggestions as to how the trans-\nformation to a learning organization might be\naided.\nHowever, one disadvantage of the '500 tips'\napproach is that it risks promoting surface\nlearning at the expense of deep learning: the\nlearning organization as a 'quick fix' rather than\nsomething more organic and slow-growing. If\nthose in the organization perceive management's\nattempts to create a learning organization as\nsimply changing the wrapping on the parcel,\nthen the transformation will be doomed.\nOne way of countering the risk of superficiality\nis to point the reader to the rich literature which\nunderpins the concept: however, only a limited\namount of further reading is suggested. The\nauthors place high value on flexibility in\nlearning, for well-understood reasons.-Had this\ntext been produced electronically, many of the\ntips could have been linked to elaborations of\nvarious kinds, thereby allowing the (presumably\nhard-pressed) manager to follow up relatively\neasily those tips s\/he was interested in. One such\ntype of elaboration would be examples of\nprecepts in practice, since Wolf's (1995) work\nstrongly suggests that exemplification is critical\nto the development of understanding of what\nrelatively abstract statements and expectations\nimply for practice.\nA related disadvantage is that the tips are\nimplicitly being presented as 'right', rather than\nas contestable propositions. At a number of\npoints I found myself wondering whether I\nagreed with what was being said. For example, in\nSection 40 the reader is told 'Don't benchmark\nagainst other organizations'. As someone who\nhas studied benchmarking, I disagree: bench-\nmarking offers the possibility of widening one's\nperspectives (a classic example being Southwest\nAirlines which looked at pit-stop practice in\nFormula One motor racing in order to see if this\ncarried any implications for apron turnaround at\nairports) and\/or of making instructive com-\nparisons with the practices of cognate organiza-\ntions. In the higher education context,\nbenchmarking harmonizes with the tradition of\ncollegial information-sharing and the transfer\nAit-} Volume 8 Number 3\nand\/or adaptation of good practice (bench-\nmarking as currently being promoted by the\nQuality Assurance Agency is another matter\nentirely).\nOne matter which writings on the learning\norganization tend to underplay is the influence\nof politics and power in organizations. There is\nan often implicit rationalist assumption that, if\neveryone would only see things the same way, the\nlearning organization would take off. The\ntrouble is that the world is untidier and more\nfragmented than the advocates of the learning\norganization often admit. 'Thinking and acting\norganizational' requires 'thinking and acting\npolitical'. So at the heart of the learning organ-\nization there is a paradox: a manager needs to\nespouse commonality\/communality whilst at the\nsame time practising political differentiation.\nAcademics in higher education have divided\nloyalties. The majority would probably assert\nthat their greater loyalty lies with their subject\ndiscipline rather than with their institution. The\ntension is clearly visible when, for example,\nacademic organizational matters cut across the\nmodus operandi of the subject discipline. For\nsome staff, then, the learning organization is to\nbe found in their community of academic\npractice as much as in their own institution. The\nmanager of academics, as a consequence, has a\ndoubly difficult task.\nThis review has turned into the beginnings of a\ndialogue with the text (one might, I suppose,\nexpect this of an academic). There is much\nuseful material in the book, but there are also\npoints at which the implicit assertiveness of 'tips'\nhas to be questioned. The authors say, correctly,\nthat each organization is unique: the corollary is\nthat the reader should use the text as a prompt\ntowards the development of appropriate practice\nrather than make the mistake of using it as a set\nof ex cathedra rules.\nMantz Yorke, Liverpool John Moores University\nReference\nWolf, A.
