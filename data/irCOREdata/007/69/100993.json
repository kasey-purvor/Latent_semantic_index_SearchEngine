One of the key components of OEICs is a laser\nmaterial for efficient light emission. However, the indirect\nband gap of Si has meant efficient light emission and gain\nhave been difficult to achieve. Several strategies for produc-\ning lasers on silicon have been proposed, such as the \u201chy-\nbrid\u201d laser,1 whereby an InP-based active region is wafer\nfused onto a silicon\/silica based waveguide or utilizing the\nRaman effect with external optical pumping.2 However\nmonolithic growth on a silicon substrate coupled with elec-\ntrical injection has remained challenging. Growth of conven-\ntional direct III-V compound semiconductors directly onto Si\nis very difficult due to the formation of threading disloca-\ntions as a result of the large lattice mismatch. However, it has\nbeen shown that GaP can be grown without dislocations on\nSi due to the relatively small difference in lattice constant\n\u0003\u00020.4% at room temperature \u0001RT\u0002\u0004.3 GaP is itself an indirect\nband gap semiconductor, but a GaNAsP alloy with high As\nfractions and dilute N fractions \u0001of \u00054%\u0002 can form a direct\nband gap material approximately lattice matched to GaP and\nSi.4 Hence the realization of a GaP-based direct band gap\nsemiconductor laser material on a silicon substrate can pro-\nvide a realistic route toward monolithic laser sources for\nsilicon-based OEICs. This is also another example of the\npotential for dilute nitride based materials in optoelectronic\ncomponents.\nIn this letter, we investigate the properties of GaNAsP\nlasers grown on GaP substrates. Using high pressure and low\ntemperature techniques we have probed the extent to which a\ntwo level band anticrossing \u0001BAC\u0002 \u0001Ref. 5\u0002 model may be\nused to describe this material and have investigated the de-\ngree to which different carrier recombination processes gov-\nern laser behavior.\nThe samples studied were grown by metal organic vapor\nphase epitaxy \u0001MOVPE\u0002 on a GaP substrate. They consist of\na single 6 nm GaN0.04As0.8P0.16 2.5% compressively strained\nquantum well \u0001SQW\u0002 within two undoped 150 nm GaP\nbarrier\/separate confinement layers. Optical confinement is\nprovided by 1.8 \u0003m thick Al0.23Ga0.77P cladding layers\ndoped p \u0001Zn:7\u00041018 cm\u22123\u0002 and n \u0001Te:2\u00041018 cm\u22123\u0002\nforming the diode junction. The device stripes \u000150 and\n100 \u0003m wide\u0002 were defined using regular masks and stan-\ndard contacts were formed by deposition. The devices were\nmeasured as-cleaved with cavity lengths of 980 \u0003m and had\nan emission wavelength of 890 nm at 80 K.\nTemperature dependence measurements were performed\nwith a closed cycle cryostat setup over the temperature range\nof 70\u2013150 K. The lasers were driven under pulsed operation\nwith 100 ns long pulses at a duty cycle of 10 kHz in order to\nminimize Joule heating effects. Threshold currents could not\nbe measured above 150 K due to the current source limit of\n4 A. Other studies have shown that similar structures can\nachieve electrically pumped lasing up to 278 K in pulsed\nmode6 and optically pumped gain at RT.7 The threshold cur-\nrent was measured from the facet light versus current char-\nacteristic. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature and\ncurrent dependencies of the pure spontaneous emission spec-\ntra from which we extracted the radiative component of the\nthreshold current \u0001since the integrated spontaneous emission\nis proportional to the radiative current\u0002. To measure the spon-\ntaneous emission, we milled a window in the n-doped side of\nthe devices using a focused ion beam technique and aligned\nan optical fiber to collect the spontaneous emission.8 Hydro-\nstatic pressure measurements were also performed on the de-\nvices at 100 K in a CuBe pressure cell \u0001with optical and\nelectrical access\u0002, allowing pressures of 0\u201310 kbars using\ngaseous helium as the pressure medium. The application of\nhigh hydrostatic pressure causes an increase in the direct\nband gap. Furthermore, in \u201cdilute nitride\u201d materials such as\nthose discussed here, high pressure can be used to vary the\ninteraction between the nitrogen level\u0001s\u0002 and the conduction\nband \u0001CB\u0002 edge of the host matrix and is therefore a useful\na\u0002Electronic mail: s.sweeney@surrey.ac.uk.\nb\u0002Present address: NAsP III\/V GmbH, D-35041 Marburg, Germany.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 93, 101108 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/93\u000210\u0001\/101108\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics93, 101108-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

We find that these as-cleaved devices\nhave threshold current densities of 2.5\u00050.5 kA \/cm2 with a\nlasing wavelength of 890 nm at 80 K. The inset shows the\nfacet light versus current density characteristic and integrated\nspontaneous emission versus current density characteristic,\nboth at 80 K. This value of Jth is much larger than well\nestablished GaAs-based lasers, which operate at similar\nwavelengths for which Jth \/QW\u0005100\u2013200 A \/cm2 \u0001Ref. 9\nand references therein\u0002, the cause of which became the focus\nof our investigations. The characteristic temperature T0\n\u0003=\u0001d ln Jth \/dT\u0002\u22121\u0004 was found to be T0\u0005200 K below 110 K\ndropping to T0\u000560 K above 110 K. Both Jth and its radia-\ntive component Jrad are unusually temperature stable below\n110 K, even higher than T0=T, as would ideally be for a\nradiatively dominated quantum well.8 This may be an indi-\ncation of inhomogeneities within the active region, as similar\nbehavior \u0001decreasing Jth and Jrad with increasing T\u0002 has been\nobserved in other dilute nitride10 and quantum dot lasers11\nwhere carrier localization due to material inhomogeneity can\nbe significant. The lack of complete pinning of the spontane-\nous emission above threshold is also a signature of inhomo-\ngeneities. While Jrad remains relatively stable over the tem-\nperature range studied, Jth increases strongly above 110 K.\nTherefore, it is clear that a nonradiative current increases\nwith increasing temperature, causing Jth to increase rapidly\nabove 110 K. The reduction in T0 is an indication of a ther-\nmally activated recombination process such as carrier leak-\nage. Auger recombination, which dominates lasers at longer\nwavelengths,8 is unlikely to be responsible at the short wave-\nlengths and low temperatures considered here, as has previ-\nously been discussed in other materials at these\nwavelengths.12\nThe inset of Fig. 1 shows the current dependence of the\nintegrated spontaneous emission below lasing threshold at 80\nK. The nonlinear behavior of the Lspon versus current curve\nconfirms that a nonradiative process is present. The fact that\nthe curve is sublinear shows that this process has a stronger\ncarrier density \u0001n\u0002 dependence than the radiative current\n\u0001which itself has an approximately \u0006n2 dependence\u0002.8 Since\ncarrier leakage has an approximately exponential dependence\non n, this further suggests that this is the dominant recombi-\nnation mechanism. We note here that recombination via de-\nfects \u0001\u0006n\u0002 in the QW is unlikely to be significant at threshold\nas this would give rise to a superlinear variation of Lspon\nversus current curve \u0001as observed in other materials10\u0002. Fur-\nther evidence for carrier leakage can be obtained from the\ntemperature variation of the external quantum efficiency, \u0007d,\ncharacterized by the T1 parameter \u0003=\u0001d ln \u0007d \/dT\u0002\u22121\u0004. A\nstrong decrease in differential quantum efficiency, and hence\nlow T1 value, has previously been explained by an increase\nin leakage current to the p-cladding region.13 Indeed, when\ncompared with other devices operating at similar\nwavelengths14 \u0001for which T1\u00051000 K around RT\u0002, we find\nT1 to be somewhat low, \u000584 K for T\u0002100 K reducing to\n\u000532 K for T\b100 K, as shown in Fig. 2.\nShown in Fig. 3 is the pressure dependence of the lasing\nenergy \u0001squares\u0002, taken from electroluminescence \u0001EL\u0002 spec-\ntra of a GaNAsP laser, which increases with pressure at a rate\nof 5.0 meV\/kbar. Also shown is the pressure dependence of\nthe \t minimum of the host material GaAs0.84P0.16, deter-\nmined from a linear interpolation of GaAs and GaP \u0001Ref. 15\u0002\nwhich we find to be 10.2 meV\/kbar. Clearly the lasing energy\nhas a much weaker pressure dependence than the direct band\ngap of the host GaAsP. It is therefore instructive to see if the\nBAC model can explain this reduced pressure dependence,\nas has been the case for other dilute nitride materials.16 In the\nBAC model, the interaction between a localized N state and\nextended CB states splits the CB into two subbands, E+ and\nE\n\u2013\n. Their energies are described by the following equation:\nE\u0005\u0001P\u0002 =\n1\n2\n\u0006\u0003E\t\u0001P\u0002 + EN\u0004\u0005 \u0007\u0003E\t\u0001P\u0002 \u2212 EN\u00042 + 4xCMN2 \b . \u00011\u0002\nHere E\t\u0001P\u0002 is the host material pressure dependent \t CB\nedge, EN is the energy level of the localized N state, x is the\nFIG. 1.

The nitrogen level \u0001dashed line\u0002 position was deter-\nmined by interpolation of isolated N level in GaAs and GaP and assumed\nnegligible movement with pressure. The change in lasing energy with pres-\nsure can be predicted using the BAC model \u0001solid line\u0002.\n101108-2 Chamings et al. Appl. Phys.

All of these energies are defined with respect to the\nzone center valence band maximum. E\n\u2013\nis therefore taken as\nthe \u201cband gap\u201d energy and compared to the lasing energy\nextracted from pressure dependent EL measurements. EN\nwas found from interpolation of the isolated nitrogen level in\nGaAs and GaP and has been assumed to have a negligible\npressure dependence.16 It is clearly seen in Fig. 1 that the\nBAC model gives good agreement with the experimental\ndata for which CMN=1.9 eV. We note that this is similar to\nprevious reported values for the GaInNAs\/GaAs system for\nwhich CMN has been reported to range between 1.26 \u0001Ref.\n17\u0002 and 2.7 eV \u0001Ref. 18\u0002 depending on the composition of\nthe host alloy and other factors.\nFurther evidence for the importance of nonradiative re-\ncombination may be found from high pressure measure-\nments. Figure 4 shows the measured pressure dependence of\nJth for the GaNAsP devices at 100 K. Also shown is the ideal\nexpected variation12 of Jrad\u0006Eg\n2 according to simple theory,\nwhere Eg is taken to be the lasing energy \u0001from Elase\n=hc \/\u0001lase, where \u0001lase is the measured lasing wavelength\u0002.\nClearly, it can be seen that Jth increases more rapidly with\npressure than the ideal Jrad, showing an increase in nonradi-\native recombination with increasing pressure. This may oc-\ncur if carriers escape into a leakage level, Eleak, which, in\nrelative terms, moves closer to the CB edge with increasing\npressure. Assuming diffusive leakage, the corresponding\nleakage current12 may be written as\nJleak = J0 exp\t\u2212 d\nEdP PkT\n , \u00012\u0002\nwhere J0 is a constant, \nE is the energy separation between\nthe CB quasi-Fermi level and the leakage level, k is the Bolt-\nzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and P is the\npressure. Thus, by considering the change in \nE with pres-\nsure, d\nE \/dP, the responsible leakage level may be identi-\nfied from its pressure coefficient. From Fig. 4, a good fit is\nobtained for d\nE \/dP=\u22120.7 meV \/kbar. Since, from Fig. 3,\nthe measured increase in band gap with pressure is\n+5.0 meV \/kbar and assuming that the CB quasi-Fermi level\nhas similar pressure dependence, this corresponds to a pres-\nsure coefficient of +4.3 meV \/kbar for the leakage level.\nHence we conclude that the leakage level has a slightly\nsmaller pressure dependence than the CB quasi-Fermi level.\nThis suggests that leakage into the X minima of the indirect\nbarriers \u0001as previously observed in shorter wavelength GaNP\nlight emitting diodes16\u0002 is not significant here, as the leakage\nlevel would then have a negative pressure coefficient.\nIn summary, we have found that the BAC model can\nwell describe the band gap of GaNAsP\/GaP as a function of\npressure. Furthermore, we have found that carrier leakage\nplays a significant role in GaNAsP lasers. A higher than ex-\npected T0 at low temperatures is consistent with inhomoge-\nneities in the active region. The sublinear dependence of the\nspontaneous emission on current and the reduction in both T0\nand T1 at higher temperatures suggest that leakage currents\nare significant. If these leakage paths can be reduced, the\ngrowth of a direct band gap material on GaP and eventually\nSi substrates may lead to fully monolithic silicon-based OE-\nICs operating at RT.\nThis project has been funded by the EPSRC \u0001U.K.\u0002 and\nthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft \u0001DFG\u0002 within the\nTopical Research Group 483 \u201cMetastable Compound Semi-\nconductor Systems and Heterostructures.\u201d\n1M.
