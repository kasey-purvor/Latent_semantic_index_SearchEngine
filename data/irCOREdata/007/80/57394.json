Dunedin Academic Press Ltd. Edinburgh, 2009. ISBN \n978-1-906716-01-1, Paperback, \u00a314.99. \n \nThe north eastern margin of the Scottish mainland has long been an area to excite the \ninterest of geologists, both amateur and professional. Whether it is the possibility of \nexamining coastal exposures of Jurassic rock sequences around Brora, equivalent to \nthose from which North Sea oil is won, or the opportunity to collect outstanding fossil \nspecimens from the world famous fish beds of Caithness, this sparsely populated \nregion area continues to attract geological field parties from across the UK and further \nafield. \n \nThis second edition of the East Sutherland and Caithness excursion guide, produced \nby the Aberdeen Geological Society and again edited by Nigel Trewin and Andrew \nHurst, is a timely and invaluable field companion for those either planning to lead \ngeological trips, or those intending to visit on holiday, who wish to gain an insight \ninto the landscape and geology of this remote area. The format of the guide builds on \nthe strengths of the first edition, published in 1993. It provides well structured \nitineraries with clearly focused topics of investigation for each excursion and now \nbenefits considerably from the extensive use of full colour illustrations, both as sketch \nmaps and photographs, of many of the most interesting and important features \nencountered. On a purely practical note, the change in profile of the guide to a more \nelongate form, with rounded edges to pages, makes it a much more user-friendly field \ncompanion than its predecessor, as it fits neatly into the map pocket of most \nwaterproof jackets. This, as most visitors to Caithness and Sutherland, will know, is \nno small matter, as the area commonly experiences \u2018four seasons in a day\u2019 weather \neven in high summer. \n \nThe guide structure will be familiar to those who are devotees of the earlier edition. \nThe Editorial Introduction gives a brief background to some of the more notable \ngeological features of the district as well as general advice on how the field visitor \nshould behave, where to stay, geological exhibits that can be visited etc. Much more \ndetailed information, together with guidance on specific aspects of access limitations, \nsuch as tidal constraints (important for the many coastal localities) walking distances, \nparking locations, expected duration of each excursion, and hazards (such as steep \nslippery slopes) are given at the beginning of most excursion itineraries. Further \npractical (locality specific) guidance is to be found within each itinerary. It is a pity \nthat expected travel times (by car or coach) from the suggested field-base centres of \nHelmsdale, Brora and Golspie (for \u2018East Sutherland\u2019) and Wick and Thurso (for \nCaithness) are only given sporadically, as these play a major role in determining the \ncorrect scheduling of a prolonged excursion. I must admit that I regret the \nrepositioning of the Excursion Localities map from its position on the back cover on \nthe first edition (which made it easy to consult in the rain) to page 37; perhaps it could \nhave been printed on the inside of the front or back covers. \n \nAn overview of the geology of the area is given in the first chapter on Geological \nHistory. This is much shorter than that given in the first edition, although it covers all \nof the topics dealt with by its predecessor. It is however fully updated with an \nimpressive integration and distillation of the findings of both early and up-to-the- \nminute geological research across the area. This is also reflected in the extensive \nreference list, with 40 newly published works cited since the 1993 edition was \npublished. Indeed, in the absence of an up to date Regional Guide or geological \nmemoirs for the area, this work would be my first point of reference for answering \nmost general questions on the bedrock geology or economic geology of the area. That \nbeing said, there are some notable shortcomings; the Quaternary geology of the region \nis covered in just over one page and, apart from a minor mention in the final chapter \n(Excursion 6 ~ Kildonan Gold) it is barely described in the remaining 190 pages. \nLikewise, topics such as the hydrogeology of the region, or its overall structural \nevolution are barely mentioned. This is perhaps a function of the stratigraphical \ntreatment of the rock sequences. This plays to the authors strengths, which are \nundoubtedly in their consummate knowledge of the sedimentary rock successions. \nThey acknowledge this, particularly in relation to the pre Devonian \u2018Basement\u2019 rocks, \nby referring the reader to the forthcoming new edition of the guide to Moine geology \n(Strachan et al, in press). \n  \nInclusion of up to date information on the Beatrice Oilfield is a welcome addition to \nthe overview as, on a clear day, its production platforms can be seen some 30 km \noffshore from the A9 between Brora and Wick .This, together with comparisons of \nthe character of individual stratigraphical units of the onshore basin-margin Jurassic \nsequences with their offshore equivalents, broadens the economic relevance of \ngeological field excursions in East Sutherland area to a potential new readership. \n \nThere a several notable errors and omissions in the illustrations within the Geological \nHistory chapter. The most notable and confusing of these are the transposition of \nfigures 9 and 10. The former has its caption as \u2018Stratigraphy and lithofacies of the \nTriassic and Liassic rocks\u2019 when it in fact shows the Bathonian and Oxfordian \nsuccession; Figure 10 shows the Trias and Lias, but is captioned Bathonian and \nOxfordian. This not only confuses the reader but, because the figures occur in their \napparently correct order in the guide, the surrounding text (which deals correctly with \nthe successions in ascending stratigraphical order) is completely mismatched with \nillustrations. This appears to be a simple mix up of apparently similar stratigraphic \ncolumns, but it should have been noticed in the final proof. More minor, but \nnevertheless irritating, is the labelling of two faults as \u2018LF\u2019 and \u2018SBF\u2019, with no \nexplanation, on the inset map of Figure 8, which shows the major brittle structures \nwithin the Inner Moray Firth Basin. A simple addition to the figure caption would \nhave rectified this, as would a change to the misleading caption to Figure 3, which \nincludes the initiation of the Orcadian basins and deposition of the Lower Old Red \nSandstone but is captioned as dealing with pre-Devonian events. It immediately faces \nFigure 2 which shows the Lower ORS as lower Devonian in age. The lack of \u2018ma.\u2019 \nafter any of the time intervals quoted in Figure 2 will also confuse the amateur reader; \nI would also have liked a time scale plotted against the basic stratigraphic framework \nin Figure 2. This would allow the reader to visualise the time intervals represented by \nvarious stratigraphic units.  \n \nSpace precludes a detailed chapter by chapter evaluation of each excursion itinerary \nor locality,  so I will make some general points highlighting some of their strengths \n(of which there are many) and my quibbles (of which there are few). Each excursion \nitinerary begins with a clear statement of its purpose i.e. what the reader will be \nexamining and access details (times, distances, hazards). This is usually clear and \nconcise and is followed by general introduction to the geology, which in most \ninstances is sufficient to place the excursion in context. The majority of the excursions \nhave more than one itinerary, which also have their own introductory remarks. In \nmany cases this leads to some repetition, but it has the great advantage of enabling a \nmix and match approach to tailoring timings or topics for specific parties. This \napproach is followed rigorously for the early excursions to the Triassic and Jurassic, \nwhere individual excursions and the relatively closely spaced localities make \ncalculations of timings and distances comparatively straightforward; it tends to be less \nprecise with the more widely spaced mixture of inland and coastal outcrops. \n \nThe types of errors present in the first chapter are apparently absent from the \nremainder of the text, which is well organised, clearly and carefully written and \ngenerally well illustrated. Each locality is given a six figure National Grid Reference, \nand in many instances, hints on how to find elusive exposures. For example, the \n\u2018Access\u2019 section for Itinerary 2.1, for the Brora Coal and Brora Arenaceous \nformations between Brora and Strathsteven (p 52) states \u2018Localities 1 and 2 require \nlow tide, and sand and seaweed cover frequently obscures large areas of outcrop\u2019; this \ntype of detail can save much wasted time and effort when leading a field party. \n \nThe use of coloured photographs to show particular structures of interest, as \nexemplified in the excursions to the Old Red Sandstone localities in Caithness is very \nimpressive; I would have liked some for the Triassic Lower Jurassic of Golspie \n(Excursion1) and a few more for Excursion 2 (the Bathonian to Oxfordian of the \nBrora area). \n \nThe description and paleoenvironmental interpretation of the sedimentary sequences, \nof individual sedimentary and tectonic structures, fossil assemblages, and of the \nevolution of the sedimentary basins through time provides a compelling picture of the \ndynamic earth movements, erosive and depositional events that have resulted in the \ndistribution of the rocks as we see them today. It has left me with a much better \nunderstanding of many localities that I have visited, and pointed out several features \nthat I had missed. That, for me, is the function of a good excursion guide, which this \nundoubtedly is. I have no hesitation in recommending it to any geologist who plans to \nvisit this unique part of Scotland, as an excursion leader or simply as a tourist. It may \neven encourage me to have a go at gold panning in the Kildonan Burn the next time I \npass through Strath Halladale. \n \nClive Auton \nBritish Geological Survey, Edinburgh \n \nReference \n \nStrachan, R.
