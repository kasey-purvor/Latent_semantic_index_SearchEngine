The CLA mixture and the individual isomers were found to inhibit resting production of 14C-prostaglandin F2a by 50, 43 and 40%, respectively. A dose dependent inhibition of stimulated 14C-prostaglandins was observed with the CLA mixture (IC50 100 \u00bfM). The cis9,trans11 and trans10,cis12 (50 \u00bfM) isomers individually inhibited the overall production of stimulated 14C-prostaglandins (between 35 and 55% and 23 and 42%, respectively). When tested at a high concentration (100 \u00bfM), cis9,trans11 was found to inhibit eicosanoid production in contrast to trans10,cis12 that caused stimulation. The overall degree of 14C-AA incorporation into membrane phospholipids of the CLA (mixture and individual isomers) treated cells was found to be lower than that of control cells and the cis9,trans11 isomer was found to increase the incorporation of 14C-AA into phosphatidylcholine. Docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and linoleic acid did not alter the overall degree of incorporation of 14C-AA.
