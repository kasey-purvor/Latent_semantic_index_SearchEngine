Individual origins initiate replication according to a\ntemporal program, with some origins initiating early and others later\nin S phase (Friedman et al., 1995). In metazoan cells, replication\ntiming correlates with subnuclear localization and gene activity of\nchromosomal domains. Inactive chromatin regions usually replicate\nlate and are frequently located at the nuclear periphery or close to\na nucleolus (Cimbora and Groudine, 2001). The establishment of\nthe replication-timing program occurs in early G1 phase, coincident\nwith the re-establishment of the spatial organization of chromatin\nfollowing mitosis (Raghuraman et al., 1997; Dimitrova and Gilbert,\n1999; Li et al., 2001). The established late replication context of a\nperipherally positioned chromosomal locus can be maintained\nduring S phase, even if the sequence was released from the nuclear\nperiphery in late G1 phase (Heun et al., 2001).\nIn the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origin activation\ntime appears to depend on chromosomal context. Replication\norigins near telomeres are a typical class of late-replicating origins\nin yeast (Ferguson and Fangman, 1992) and the telomeres are\nlocalized to the nuclear periphery during most of interphase.\nMoreover, disruption of the telomere-binding protein complex Ku\neffects not only telomere localization (Laroche et al., 1998), but\nalso replication-timing control (Cosgrove et al., 2002). Despite these\nobservations, there is no clear evidence that peripheral localization\ndirectly causes late replication.\nThe histone modification state of chromatin surrounding an origin\ndoes influence replication timing of the origin. For example,\nestablishment of silent chromatin has been shown to cause\nhydroxyurea sensitivity of replication initiation, which is\ncharacteristic of late origins (Zappulla et al., 2002). Acetylation of\nhistones close to a normally late-replicating origin makes the origin\ninitiate earlier (Vogelauer et al., 2002; Goren et al., 2008; Knott et\nal., 2009). However, manipulating histone acetylation causes fairly\nsmall changes in replication timing. There is moreover no clear\ncorrelation between origin initiation time in S. cerevisiae and\nacetylation level of the surrounding nucleosomes (Nieduszynski et\nal., 2006), highlighting our limited understanding of the controls\nover the replication-timing program.\nThese potential mechanisms that might influence replication\ntiming are not mutually exclusive, and one mechanism could\npositively or negatively affect the others. To obtain a full\nunderstanding of the molecular control(s) over replication timing,\nit is necessary to dissect the effects of the potential control\nmechanisms. To test the possibility that localization at the nuclear\nenvelope delays origin firing, we artificially tethered the early\nreplicating origin ARS607 to the nuclear envelope and examined\nthe replication time of the repositioned origin. Here, we show that\nperipheral positioning of ARS607 is not sufficient to delay firing\nof this origin. Therefore, peripheral positioning of an origin is not\nsufficient to establish a late-replicating chromosomal region.\nResults and Discussion\nTethering of a replication origin to the nuclear periphery\nTo examine whether perinuclear localization affects the temporal\nprogram of replication origin activation, we used a system designed\nto allow ARS607, an early-replicating origin on chromosome VI,\nto be artificially tethered to the nuclear periphery. ARS607 is located\non the right arm of chromosome VI, approximately 51 kb from\nEarly initiation of a replication origin tethered at the\nnuclear periphery\nHani Ebrahimi1,*, E.

To test whether peripheral\npositioning can impose late replication, we examined whether artificial tethering of an early-initiating replication origin to the nuclear\nperiphery delays its replication in budding yeast. We tested the effects of three different peripheral tethering constructs on the time of\nreplication of the early replication origin ARS607. Using the dense-isotope transfer method to assess replication time, we found that\nARS607 still replicates early when tethered to the nuclear periphery using the Yif1 protein or a fragment of Sir4, whereas tethering\nusing a Yku80 construct produces only a very slight replication delay. Single-cell microscopic analysis revealed no correlation between\nperipheral positioning of ARS607 in individual cells and delayed replication. Overall, our results demonstrate that a replication origin\ncan initiate replication early in S phase, even if artificially relocated to the nuclear periphery.\nKey words: Replication timing, Subnuclear organization, Time-lapse imaging\nJo\nur\nn\na\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\ncie\nnc\ne\n JCS ePress online publication date 2 March 2010\n1016\nCEN6 and 71 kb from the right telomere (Shirahige et al., 1993),\nand shows largely random subnuclear positioning (Taddei et al.,\n2004). ARS607 is efficiently active (initiating replication in >85%\nof cells) and replicates early in S phase (Friedman et al., 1997;\nYamashita et al., 1997). To enable controlled tethering of ARS607\nto the nuclear periphery, we used a strain in which four copies of\nthe lexA operator sequence (lexAop) are inserted 0.7 kb from ARS607\n(Fig. 1A) (Taddei et al., 2004). This insertion allows the ARS607\nlocus to be directed to the nuclear periphery by expressing a\n\u2018tethering construct\u2019 in which the LexA DNA-binding domain is\nfused to a protein moiety that can mediate peripheral positioning\n[such as fragments of the Ku and Sir proteins implicated in\ntelomere tethering (Taddei et al., 2004)]. The locus was visualized\nby inserting an array of lacO operator sequences (centered 5.9 kb\nfrom ARS607) and expressing GFP fused to LacI repressor protein\n(LacI-GFP) (Straight et al., 1996). In vivo, 5.9 kb corresponds to\nseparation of less than 50 nm (Bystricky et al., 2004); because this\ndistance is much shorter than the ~200 nm resolution limit of light\nmicroscopy, the position of the lacO array can be considered to\nreflect the position of ARS607. The strain additionally expresses\nthe nuclear pore protein Nup49 fused to either GFP or mCherry\nprotein (Iwase et al., 2006), allowing microscopic assessment of\nARS607 location relative to the nuclear envelope.\nWe employed three different LexA fusion tethering constructs:\nLexA-Sir4PAD, LexA\u2013Yku80-9 and LexA-Yif1, all of which were\npreviously shown to mediate nuclear peripheral localization (Taddei\net al., 2004). LexA-Sir4PAD contains a fragment of the Sir4 protein.\nSir4 forms part of the telomeric transcriptional silencing machinery,\nbut because the Sir4PAD fragment lacks the domain required for\ninteraction with other Sir proteins, it cannot nucleate silent\nheterochromatin when tethered to a chromosomal locus (Ansari and\nGartenberg, 1997; Taddei et al., 2004). Another tethering construct,\nLexA\u2013Yku80-9, is formed from LexA fused to an allele of the\ntelomere-binding Yku80 protein (Taddei et al., 2004). We also tested\na construct containing LexA fused to the inner nuclear membrane\nprotein Yif1, which can tether ARS607 to the nuclear periphery\nindependent of proteins involved in telomere clustering (Taddei et\nal., 2004). Importantly, none of these LexA fusions induces\ntranscriptional silencing at the ARS607 locus (supplementary\nmaterial Fig. S1), although LexA\u2013Yku80-9 was previously shown\nto induce moderate silencing at a crippled silencer (Taddei et al.,\n2004). All three LexA fusions mediate tethering of the ARS607 locus\nto the nuclear periphery in G1 and early S phase cells (data not\nshown), as previously reported (Taddei et al., 2004; Hiraga et al.,\n2006; Ebrahimi and Donaldson, 2008). Yeast chromatin is highly\nmobile and it should be noted that the ARS607 locus remains\ndynamic, even when positioned at the periphery by one of these\nconstructs. Therefore, we observe ARS607 at the periphery in 60-\n70% of cells in a population snapshot (compared to 33% of cells\nfor a randomly positioned locus). This observation is consistent with\nprevious data showing that endogenous perinuclear chromosome\ndomains, such as telomeres, are peripheral in 60-70% of cells\n(Hediger et al., 2002; Brickner and Walter, 2004).\nWe first checked that peripheral tethering does not repress origin\nactivity, using neutral\/neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis\nJournal of Cell Science 123 (7)\nFig. 1. Perinuclear tethering of a replication origin. (A)\uf020Schematic diagram\nof the tethering construct used in this study. Integrated next to ARS607 are four\ncopies of the LexA DNA-binding sequence and an array of lacO sites. (B)\uf020The\norigin activity of ARS607 in asynchronous cultures was compared using two-\ndimensional gel electrophoresis of strains expressing LexA only (strain\nHE114), and LexA-Sir4PAD (HE115), LexA\u2013Yku80-9 (HE116) and LexA-Yif1\n(HE87) tethering constructs.\nFig. 2.

The replication kinetics of the ARS607\nlocus are compared with those of ARS306 (early marker) and chrXIV-internal\n(late marker). (B)\uf020RI was calculated for ARS607 in each of the four strains\nrelative to very early and late replicating sequences (ARS306 and chrXIV-\ninternal, set to 0 and 1, respectively).\nJo\nur\nn\na\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\ncie\nnc\ne\n1017Early initiation of a peripheral origin\n(Fig. 1B) (Friedman and Brewer, 1995). A bubble arc indicative of\nARS607 origin activation was detected in the LexA-expressing\nstrain. The presence of a similar bubble arc in the strains expressing\nLexA-Sir4PAD, LexA\u2013Yku80-9 and LexA-Yif1 indicated that\nARS607 remains active when tethered to the nuclear periphery.\nTethering does not affect average replication time\nNext, we examined the effect of perinuclear tethering on replication\ntiming of ARS607 using the dense-isotope transfer method. In this\ntechnique, the replication kinetics of specific sequences are\nmonitored in a synchronized culture, by tracking the shift in density\nof genomic DNA fragments caused by the incorporation of specific\ncarbon and nitrogen isotopes into nascent DNA (McCarroll and\nFangman, 1988). The graphs in Fig. 2A show the replication\nkinetics of three different sequences: the early-replication origin\nARS306; a late marker sequence, \u2018chrXIV-internal\u2019, centered at\napproximately 223 kb on chromosome XIV; and the ARS607 locus.\nAs expected, in the control strain (expressing LexA alone), ARS607\nreplicated early in S phase, shortly after ARS306, which is one of\nthe earliest-replicating sequences in the genome (Fig. 2A).\nExpression of either the LexA-Sir4PAD or LexA-Yif1 localization\nconstructs did not result in any noticeable change in the replication\nkinetics of ARS607 (Fig. 2A, right hand graphs). Expression of\nLexA\u2013Yku80-9 caused a very slight delay in the replication time\nof ARS607 relative to the early marker ARS306 (Fig. 2A, lower\nleft panel), but this change might not be significant because it lies\nwithin the margins of error typically seen for this type of experiment\n(Friedman et al., 1996).\nReplication time in these experiments is defined as the time at\nwhich a sequence has replicated in half of the cycling cells. The\n\u2018replication index\u2019 (RI) is the replication time of a sequence\nexpressed relative to the early and late markers (whose replication\ntimes are assigned as 0 and 1, respectively). Calculating the RI\nnormalizes the differences in the speed with which different cultures\nrelease from synchronization and proceed through S phase. Fig. 2B\nshows RI values for ARS607 in the four experiments, and confirms\nthat expressing LexA-Sir4PAD or LexA-Yif1 caused no significant\nchange in replication time, whereas LexA\u2013Yku80-9 caused only a\nvery slight change.\nSingle-cell analysis of replication timing\nThe results in Fig. 2 do not support the idea that perinuclear\npositioning mediates late replication. However, the replication\ntiming values measured by the density-transfer method represent\nan average (mean) for all the cells in the population. Because the\nLexA fusion proteins typically cause perinuclear tethering in only\n60-70% of cells at any moment (Taddei et al., 2004; Hiraga et al.,\n2006; Ebrahimi and Donaldson, 2008), it is conceivable that a delay\nto replication time caused by perinuclear localization could be\nobscured because ARS607 is not localized in 30-40% of cells. To\ninvestigate this possibility, we examined the replication of the\nARS607 locus microscopically in individual cells, by monitoring\nthe doubling of GFP fluorescence intensity (Kitamura et al., 2006;\nEbrahimi and Donaldson, 2008). Briefly, time-lapse experiments\nFig. 3. Subnuclear positioning does not correlate with ARS607 replication\ntime in live-cell imaging experiments.

The position of ARS607 (green GFP\ndot) within the nuclear rim (red mCherry) is shown in the colored insets. At\neach time point, the data sets collected consisted of 16 planes in each channel\nthrough the z-axis. At the time points shown, ARS607 was close to the\nequatorial plane of the nucleus.

Representative images are shown in Fig. 3A. The\nplots in Fig. 3C-D show the results for a series of individual cells.\nIn these plots, the open diamonds show bud size at successive time\npoints and red triangles indicate time points at which the ARS607\nlocus was at the nuclear periphery. Measuring the midpoint of the\nincrease in GFP fluorescence (filled green circles) allows assignment\nof the ARS607 replication time in each cell.\nIn the control strain expressing LexA, the ARS607 locus was\nconsistently replicated 2-6 minutes after bud emergence (Fig. 3B,\nFig. 4A). Replication time of the ARS607 locus was also measured\nin cells expressing LexA-Sir4PAD (Fig. 3C) and LexA\u2013Yku80-9 (Fig.\n3D). In neither case did we observe any consistent delay in\nreplication timing relative to bud emergence. Importantly, even\nwhen examining these individual cells, no relationship was observed\nbetween ARS607 replication time and its localization status at\nimmediately preceding time points (Fig. 4A). Specifically, the\nARS607 locus showed no tendency to replicate later when it was\nlocalized at the periphery immediately before replication (Fig. 4A,\ngrey and black circles do not cluster towards the top of the chart).\nTethering of ARS607 to the nuclear periphery by LexA-Sir4PAD or\nLexA\u2013Yku80-9 did result in replication timing that appears slightly\nmore scattered relative to bud emergence than observed for the\ncontrol strain (Fig. 4A), but the variation in replication timing\nrelative to budding (s.d. less than 4 minutes) was much smaller\nthan the length of S phase (15-20 minute difference in replication\ntime between earliest and latest origins). Moreover, the ARS607\nlocus replicated at a very similar average bud size, whether or not\nit was tethered to the nuclear periphery (Fig. 4B). To summarize,\nthe results of single-cell analysis also indicated that peripheral\nlocalization of ARS607 has no major impact on its replication time.\nThe density-transfer method allows precise, standardized\ncomparison of average replication times in a population, whereas\nsingle-cell imaging enables the simultaneous recording of replication\ntime and locus subnuclear position in individual living cells.\nAssessing replication time using either technique revealed that\nperinuclear positioning of the origin does not impact its initiation\ntime. In summary, our findings suggest that subnuclear localization\nis not the main determinant of replication timing in budding yeast.\nThis reveals the reason for previous observations that telomeric\norigins can replicate late even when the origin is not properly\nlocalized to the nuclear periphery (Heun et al., 2001; Hiraga et al.,\n2006).\nMaterials and Methods\nYeast strains and plasmids\nYeast strains are described in supplementary material Table S1.

To determine the time point at which ARS607\nreplicated, a curve is fitted over the intensity data points; the midpoint of the intensity\nincrease on the fitted curve is assigned as the replication time.\nDensity transfer\nThe replication timing analyses shown in Fig. 2 were carried out using the dense-\nisotope transfer technique, as previously described (Donaldson et al., 1998).\nTwo-dimensional gel\nGenomic DNA was prepared as described (Huberman et al., 1987; Brewer et al.,\n1992).
