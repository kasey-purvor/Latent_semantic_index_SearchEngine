INTRODUCTION\nIn recent work, the authors in concert with others have\ntheoretically1 predicted and experimentally2 demonstrated\nthe existence of Tamm plasmon polaritons \u0001TPPs\u0002, a form of\nphotonic-related surface excitation, in structures in which the\npresence of a metal layer and Bragg reflector \u0001BR\u0002 was cru-\ncial. A simple phase-matching prescription, employed as an\naid in the investigation of such states in BR-based structures,\nhas also been described3 in the case where indium tin oxide\nforms the metallic layer. This work was a development of\nthat of Kavokin et al.4 who theoretically predicted the exis-\ntence of lossless Tamm states at the interface between two\ndifferent periodic dielectric structures and then went on to\nshow how such states might be utilized in the construction of\na polariton laser.5 In turn, these activities were inspired by\nthe much earlier efforts of both Tamm6 and Ritchie7 who\nconsidered electronic surface states and the later optical state\nstudies of Yeh et al.8,9 An additional novel characteristic of\nthese BR-metal layer structures is that they make possible\nthe existence of TPPs above the bulk plasma frequency.10\nThe utilization of resonant cavity or interface states associ-\nated with a photonic band gap \u0001PBG\u0002 structure on the surface\nof a prism has previously been proposed11 for potential use\nin attenuated total reflectance \u0001ATR\u0002 and other optical appli-\ncations, but in that case the existence of a metallic layer at\nthe upper interface was not considered and this has crucially\nimportant implications for the behavior of the system, as we\nshall demonstrate.\nIn this work, we employ a standard transfer matrix ap-\nproach together with support from the phase-matching tech-\nnique, which will be briefly described here, in order to in-\nvestigate the nature of and calculate the reflectivity spectrum\nof a particular substrate-metal-BR-air photonic structure that\nhas potential for practical applications. All calculations relate\nonly to TM polarization in which the magnetic field is per-\npendicular to the plane of incidence with the magnetic\nH-field entirely parallel to the interfaces.\nII. BASIC STRUCTURE\nFigure 1 illustrates the basic structure considered in this\nwork, consisting of a substrate \u0001taken to be SiO2 with a re-\nfractive index of 1.47\u0002 with a thin overlayer of silver \u0001the\nprecise nature of the metal and its properties are not crucial\nto the form of the basic results\u0002 topped by a 40-layer\nSiO2 \/TiO2 BR, with a SiO2 layer adjacent to the silver film.\nThe TiO2 is taken to have a refractive index of 2.37. \u0001See,\ne.g., Lee and Yao12 for an account of the dielectric properties\nof SiO2 and TiO2, which can be taken to be lossless and with\nfixed refractive indices in the infrared regime considered.\u0002\nFor the purposes of the calculations, we have somewhat ar-\nbitrarily considered a BR in which the PBG of the associated\ninfinitely repeated Bragg structure is centered at 1 eV. For\nsuch a structure, to the nearest nanometer, the respective\nSiO2 and TiO2 layer thicknesses are 211 and 131 nm. We\nhave employed the simple Drude expression\n\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0002 = 1 \u2212\n\u0002p\n2\n\u0002\u0001\u0002 + i\u0002c\u0002\nfor the relative permittivity of the metallic layer. We employ\nsilver as a suitable representative metal with a plasma fre-\nquency such that \u0003\u0002p\u00057.2 eV and with collision frequency,\nwhich determines the losses in the metal, given by \u0003\u0002c\n\u00050.05 eV.13 We take the incident angle on the silver in the\nSiO2 substrate to be \u0004=45\u00b0 which, given that the SiO2\/air\ncritical angle is 42.86\u00b0, ensures that the overall transmission\na\u0002Electronic mail: stuart.brand@dur.ac.uk.\nFIG. 1.

CALCULATIONS\nAs described more fully in Refs. 1 and 3, the existence\nof an interface state, or indeed any form of bound photonic\neigenstate, in a 1D photonic structure can be predicted from\nthe condition \u0005left+\u0005right=0. Here, \u0005left and \u0005right are the\nphases associated with the electric field amplitude reflection\ncoefficients for light traveling from right to left, and left to\nright respectively at an imaginary interface at a point within\nany lossless region of the photonic structure. For our pur-\nposes, we take the interface to be just within the BR, an\ninfinitesimal distance from the metal layer, and the phases\nare calculated using the transfer matrix method. We can then\npredict the energies at which any such states exist by, for\nexample, plotting a graph of \u2212\u0005left and \u0005right against energy\nand looking for the crossing points. This has been done for\nthe structure detailed in Sec. II and the results are shown in\nFig. 2. For the purpose of the calculations, the thickness of\nthe silver layer was set at 57 nm. In this case, \u0005S=\u0005left,\nwhich relates to light impinging on the silver layer to the left\nof the BR, and \u0005BR=\u0005right, which relates to light impinging\non the BR in the reverse direction. As can be seen, there are\na number of crossing points over the range of energy consid-\nered. Most of the associated states, as will be demonstrated,\nare derived from simple resonance states of the associated\nBragg structure, but one of them, at about 1.32 eV, is an\ninterface state with potentially useful applications. We note\nthat truly bound photonic states would only exist within this\nstructure in the case of an infinitely thick, lossless metallic\nregion, or an infinite BR on the left together with an infinite\nair region on the right, so in practice all states are only qua-\nsibound. A finite metallic layer is employed so that the pres-\nence of the photonic states can be readily detected with the\nuse of reflectivity experiments in a configuration similar to\nthat employed in a standard ATR study. Without the presence\nof the metallic layer, in which there are losses, the reflec-\ntance spectrum would otherwise be featureless in the absence\nof any transmission through the structure.\nThe transfer matrix approach has been employed to per-\nform a number of power reflection coefficient \u0001R\u0002 calcula-\ntions and these are detailed in Fig. 3. First, R was calculated\nfor the BR structure alone, bounded on either side by SiO2.\nFor the 40-layer structure \u0001effectively a 39 layer symmetric\nstructure given that the first layer is the same composition as\nthe substrate\u0002 a fairly well defined high reflectivity PBG re-\ngion is clearly visible centered at about 1.25 eV. The sur-\nrounding series of fairly broad minima in R are, of course,\nassociated with light transmission to the right-hand side via\nresonance states of the overall BR structure. The field enve-\nlopes of these states have one or more maxima within the\nBR. If the SiO2 at the right-hand side of the BR is instead\nreplaced by air, because the incident angle is above the criti-\ncal angle, a featureless spectrum in which R=1 at all ener-\ngies is obtained. If the BR is omitted and a simple structure\nconsisting of a 57 nm layer of silver between the substrate\nand air is considered there can be no overall transmission\nthrough the structure but a gradually reducing value of R\nwith energy can be observed due to losses within the silver\nlayer. We note that, for this standard ATR structure, a distinct\nfeature due to the associated surface plasmon polariton can\nbe observed closer to the critical angle but this is at an en-\nergy significantly below the range illustrated in the figure.\nThe reflection coefficient for the full model structure\nshows a distinctive new feature. The series of sharp minima\nin R on both sides of the initial PBG region are related to the\noriginal resonance states, but are shifted slightly upwards in\nenergy due to their increased localization. The thin silver\nlayer provides some additional confinement of the states\nwithin the structure to form very sharp quasibound photonic\nstates while allowing just enough access to the structure to\n\u0001\nS\nBR\n\u0001\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\n-200\n0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6\nP\nh\nas\ne\n(d\neg\nre\nes\n)\nEnergy (eV)\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 The phases \u0005BR and \u2212\u0005S as a function of the energy\nof the incident light at an incident angle of \u0004=45\u00b0 within the substrate.

How-\never, in addition to the resonance-related states which are\nclearly identifiable due to the close correspondence with\nthose of the BR structure alone, there is an additional sharp\nfeature at about 1.32 eV which is just below the upper edge\nof the PBG of the infinite BR. In practice, the positions of all\nof the sharp dips in reflectivity agree with the predictions of\nthe phase-matching results of Fig. 2 to about 0.0001 eV. The\nstate within the PBG has a half height width of about 2\n\u000710\u22125 eV and is noticeably narrower than the original\nresonance-related dips. The thickness of the silver layer has\nbeen chosen to approximately minimize the reflectivity \u0001R\n\b0.0002\u0002 associated with the 1.32 eV feature \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002,\nbut we note that it also leads to low reflectivity for the BR-\nrelated resonances. The nature of this state can be revealed\nby plotting the associated H-field intensity profile \u0001time-\naveraged H2\u0002, as shown in Fig. 5, clearly demonstrating that\nthis is an interface state localized toward the right-hand side\nof the BR. For comparison, in Fig. 6 the equivalent plot for\nthe BR resonance-related state near 1.13 eV is also shown.\nFor the purposes of the transfer matrix calculation, the\nincoming H-wave has an amplitude such that the intensity at\nthe interface between the substrate and the silver layer is I\n=1 in arbitrary units in the absence of a reflected wave. For\nall the states considered, the field profile in the region of the\nsilver layer is very similar. However, for the interface state, I\nrises from a value near unity at the substrate\/silver interface\nto a peak value of about 100 at the right-hand edge of the\nsilver layer and this state has a much higher peak intensity\nthan that of any of the BR resonance states. In addition, the\nintensity of the interface state can be readily increased fur-\nther by judicious alteration of the structure and angle of in-\ncidence \u0004, leading to an even narrower feature.\nIt is important to emphasize that states similar in form to\nthose shown in Figs. 5 and 6 exist even in the absence of the\nsilver layer as was realized by Nelson and Haus,11 but with-\nout the presence of the crucial silver layer such states only\nproduce a change in the phase of the reflectance spectrum,\nand not the distinctive reflectivity feature reported here.\nAlso, the field intensity for the states is reduced by orders of\nmagnitude compared to that with the silver layer present, and\nthis is of great importance with regard to potential nonlinear\noptics applications. Although the use of a somewhat different\nvalue for the loss term \u0002c has no significant effect on the\nenergy, it is clear that it can substantially affect the condi-\ntions for experimental detection of the interface state. If \u0002c is\nset to zero, there can then be no losses or transmission\nthrough the structure and thus R=1 at all energies. With a\ngiven loss term, appropriate adjustment of the metallic layer\nthickness is required in order to obtain the most advanta-\ngeous enhancement of the features in the reflectivity spec-\ntrum and the field intensity at the external interface.\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nNo silver layer\n100 nm\n57 nm\n50 nm\n40 nm\n30 nm\n10 nm\n20 nm\nEnergy (eV)\n1.3214 1.3215 1.3216 1.3217 1.3218 1.3219 1.3220 1.3221\nR\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\nco\nef\nfi\nci\nen\nt,\nR\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 The change in reflectivity near the interface state\nenergy as a function of silver layer thickness. A 57 nm wide layer of silver\nleads to a situation in which there is almost no detectable reflected wave\nfrom the structure and the system is tuned such that virtually all of the\nincoming energy is dissipated within the metallic layer. Further increase in\nmetal layer thickness leads to a more confined quasibound interface state but\nit becomes more difficult to access the state and so the reflectivity increases.\nLayers thinner than 57 nm give rise to an increase in reflectivity, decreased\nconfinement and a broadening of the reflectivity feature.\nFIG. 5.

Appl. Phys. 106, 113109 \u00022009\u0001\nDownloaded 26 Jan 2011 to 129.234.252.66. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDue to the high field intensity associated with the state at\nthe BR\/air interface, we propose that this structure may have\npotential uses as a sensor\/detector or in nonlinear optics ap-\nplications. For example, in the case of this particular struc-\nture, if the refractive index on the right hand side is progres-\nsively increased from that of air to 1.0394 then the\ndistinctive reflectivity feature shifts to lower energy, nar-\nrows, and then vanishes as eventually the incident angle \u0004\n=45\u00b0 is no longer above the critical angle and the interface\nstate disappears. Alternatively, in the case of air on the right,\nthe reflectivity feature becomes progressively sharper then\ndisappears if the angle of incidence is reduced toward the\ncritical angle of 42.86\u00b0. In practice, the structure acts as a\nvery narrow notch filter in which effectively all of the incom-\ning energy is absorbed at the design wavelength\/energy in\nthe thin metallic layer. The consequences of the associated\nenergy absorption at the tuned wavelength might also have\napplications.\nFor comparison, a calculation of the reflection coeffi-\ncient has also been carried out for the situation in which the\nordering of the layers within the BR is reversed. In that case,\nwith a high refractive index TiO2 layer at the interface with\nthe silver layer and the low index SiO2 bordering the air\nregion on the right of the structure, an interface state is still\npresent, as can be seen from the associated reflectivity fea-\nture at about 1.17 eV in Fig. 3. However, this feature is\nsignificantly broader than those of even the resonance-like\nstates and is localized at the internal interface at the opposite\nsilver\/BR side of the structure \u0001within the silver the I profile\nis again very similar to that of the other states with the same\nincoming wave amplitude\u0002. This state is very similar in na-\nture to that revealed in experiment by Sasin et al.2 and, due\nto its localization at the left BR interface, it is insensitive to\nthe details of the material to the right-hand side of the BR.\nEssentially, the same reflectivity feature, at the same energy\nis obtained if, say, SiO2 rather than air is on the right-hand\nside of the structure, although the rest of the reflectivity plot\nis significantly altered. Due to the localization of this state at\nthe internal BR interface, it does not offer the same potential\nfor sensor and other applications as the state localized at the\nopposite interface.\nAny practical implementation of the proposed structure\nwill incorporate layer width variations, due to fabrication\nerrors, which could, in principle, affect the results. The con-\nsequences can be rather subtle, due to the exponential form\nof the field profile associated with the interface state. How-\never, we note that in the context of the present work, a 5%\nchange in the width of the first layer, adjacent to the silver,\nproduces no significant alteration in the position or form of\nthe reflectivity minimum. A similar alteration in the width of\nthe final layer, adjacent to the air, produces an energy shift\nseveral hundred times larger of about 0.01 eV while retaining\nan essentially zero value for the reflection coefficient. As\npositive and negative changes compared to the idealized\nlayer widths lead to opposite shifts with respect to the posi-\ntion of the reflectivity minimum, the net effect of random\nlayer thickness variations is expected to be small.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a Bragg-reflector-\nrelated structure in which the associated quasibound photo-\nnic state leads to a distinctive narrow feature in the reflectiv-\nity spectrum and a high field intensity at the externally\naccessible interface. This feature is much sharper and gives\nrise to a much greater field intensity than would be experi-\nenced in the case of a standard ATR experiment without the\nBR, or with the BR in the absence of the metal layer. This\nsuggests that the structure may have applications for sensor\/\ndetector or nonlinear optics applications, as the nature of the\nresultant interface state and the consequent features in the\nreflectivity are sensitive to conditions at the external inter-\nface. The structure acts as a highly selective notch filter\nwhich can be designed to absorb virtually all of the incoming\nenergy at a particular energy and this may also have useful\napplications. The materials employed and thicknesses of all\nlayers in the structure, as well as the angle of incidence con-\nsidered, can be adjusted in order to tune the response of the\nstructure.\n1M.
