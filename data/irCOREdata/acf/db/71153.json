Magnetospheric physics (current systems;\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere interactions; solar wind-\nmagnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nThe outer magnetosphere is electromagnetically coupled to\nthe underlying ionosphere by field-aligned currents which\ntransmit stresses imposed at high altitudes to the ionosphere.\nUnderstanding the intricacies of solar wind-magnetosphere-\n2892 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction\nionosphere interactions is a task of formidable complexity.\nAmong the complicating factors are (i) a possible similarity\nof response elicited by different interplanetary triggers; (ii)\nthe general nonlinear response of the magnetosphere to in-\nterplanetary triggers, including the possibility of saturation\nof response; (iii) feedback from the ionosphere; (iv) the tem-\nporal overlap of two interplanetary signals, which may re-\nenforce or cancel each other; (v) nonsynchronous responses\nof components of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem to the same interplanetary trigger due to, for exam-\nple, different intrinsic response times, and, most important,\n(vi) uncertainties in the location on the magnetopause where\nprocesses of momentum transfer, whose signatures are ob-\nserved in the inner magnetosphere, are initiated.\nIn particular, processes of momentum and energy transfer\nat the magnetopause during transient reconnection of the in-\nterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the geomagnetic field\n(so called flux transfer events, FTEs, Russell and Elphic,\n1978) are believed to lead to a plethora of inner magne-\ntospheric and ionospheric signatures, the understanding of\nwhich has been an ongoing concern for over 2 decades. In-\ndividual signatures include: poleward-moving auroral forms\n(PMAFs; Sandholt et al., 1986, 1990, 2003), pulsed iono-\nspheric flows\/flow channels (PIFs; Pinnock et al., 1993,\n1995; Rodger and Pinnock, 1997; Neudegg et al., 1999;\nProvan et al., 2002), poleward-moving radar auroral forms\n(PMRAFs; Wild et al., 2001), an ion energy-latitude disper-\nsion signature in the cusp of the staircase variety (\u201cstepped\ncusp\u201d; Cowley et al., 1991; Newell et al., 1989; Escoubet et\nal., 1992). The reliable and unique association of these signa-\ntures to transient reconnection requires in general multi-point\nobservations. By probing the signatures of coupling at var-\nious heights along the same bundle of magnetic field lines\nwith a complement of instruments, and by interrelating the\nobservations, magnetic conjunctions offer one of the most\npromising approaches to uniquely pinning down cause and\neffect.\nA major issue which features increasingly in current de-\nbates on solar wind-magnetosphere coupling concerns the\nlocation where reconnection takes place (interconnection ge-\nometry). Specifically, in the case of transient reconnection,\nearly evidence for its occurrence came from space probes\ncrossing the magnetopause in two different latitude ranges:\nHEOS 2 at higher, and the ISEE 1 and 2 satellite pair at\nlower, latitudes. At higher latitudes, HEOS 2 detected short-\nlived (\u223c1 min), large-amplitude fluctuations of the geomag-\nnetic field, which were termed flux erosion events and at-\ntributed to temporarily-varying reconnection in the cusp re-\ngion (Haerendel et al., 1978). Haerendel et al. found no\nreason to exclude the higher latitude regions as active sites\nof momentum transfer. Almost simultaneously, the ISEE\n1\/2 spacecraft detected characteristic magnetic field signa-\ntures during magnetopause crossings at lower latitudes, later\nassociated with distinct plasma behavior (Paschmann et al.,\n1982; see also review by Farrugia et al., 1988). The magnetic\nfield signature consisted primarily of a bipolar excursion of\nthe magnetic field component perpendicular to the notional\nmagnetopause boundary accompanied by deflections in the\nfield components in the local tangent plane to the magne-\ntopause. These signatures were interpreted by Russell and\nElphic (1978) as being due to reconnected flux tubes mov-\ning along the magnetopause away from the reconnection site.\nLater analyses confirmed this interpretation. By casting the\nHEOS 2 data in the same coordinate system as that used in\nthe ISEE 1\/2 analyses (\u201cboundary normal coordinates\u201d, Rus-\nsell and Elphic, 1978), Rijnbeek and Cowley (1984) estab-\nlished conclusively the identity of the two phenomena.\nLater analyses emphasized the ISEE data set, partly be-\ncause of its extensive size and superior temporal resolution\nand partly because of the lack of in situ observations from\nhigh magnetopause latitudes (being remedied only recently\nby Polar and Interball-tail). Theory thus focussed on signa-\ntures of reconnection during a southward oriented IMF initi-\nated in the subsolar region at an X-line, which may be tilted\nby IMF By . Much progress was achieved by these means. In\nthe meantime, however, the importance of the high-latitude\nboundary as a possible site of momentum transfer receded\nfrom view.\nThis paper concerns a multiple magnetic conjunction oc-\ncurring under a southwesterly IMF where the higher alti-\ntude probe lies in a high-latitude boundary layer (HBL) pole-\nward of the cusp. This is a location similar to that where\nflux erosion events were first observed, although at some-\nwhat higher latitudes. This example was chosen because of\ntwo favourable circumstances: the location of Cluster down-\nstream of the cusp and the possibility offered by the multiple\nconjunction of correlating observations there with observa-\ntions at two heights in the ionosphere.\nThe HBL tailward of the cusp, permeated by open mag-\nnetic field lines that are stretched by the solar wind flow,\nis widely considered to be the site of the solar wind-\nmagnetosphere dynamo and thus an important locale for mo-\nmentum transfer to the polar cap ionosphere (e.g. Siscoe\nand Cummings, 1969; Vasyliunas et al., 1982; Stern, 1984;\nTaguchi et al., 1993; Siscoe et al., 1991; Farrugia et al.,\n2003). However, the role of this region as a site of mo-\nmentum transfer in association with pulsed magnetopause\nreconnection\/FTEs has not been discussed much in the lit-\nerature, mainly for reasons discussed above. In this paper we\nreport in situ plasma and magnetic field observations from\nthe Cluster 1 spacecraft in the HBL and relate these obser-\nvations to local and global plasma convection data observed\nsimultaneously at the magnetic conjugate point in the upper\natmosphere by the S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m radar and the Iceland West\n(Stokkseyri) SuperDARN radar. The latter observations are\ncharacterized by PIFs and PMRAFs. These observations are\nin our case complemented by particle precipitation and field-\naligned current data obtained from the FAST satellite. A se-\nquence of events characterized by enhanced tailward flows\nare observed by Cluster 1 as the reconnected flux tubes con-\nvect past the spacecraft. These events are accompanied by\nAlfve\u00b4nic fluctuations which, by allowing field-aligned cur-\nrents to flow to the ionosphere, mediate the coupling (see,\ne.g. the review by Cowley, 2000). This paper thus employs\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction 2893\nparticle precipitation, magnetic field, and plasma convection\ndata acquired at three heights in a multiple conjunction. Sev-\neral hypothesized individual signatures of transient recon-\nnection are encountered and, by discussing them within a\ncommon context, a detailed and coherent picture of the re-\nsponse of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system to transient\nreconnection emerges.\nThe wider implication of the investigation is that it re-\nopens the question of the high-latitude regions as active sites\nof momentum transfer and, by implication, the need to ex-\ntend theory to include this feature and the complex intercon-\nnection geometry suggested by the observations. The ob-\nservations show, namely, that under a southwest IMF mo-\nmentum transfer is taking place at the HBL\/cusp poleward\nboundary. While the paper does not propose answers to\nthis difficult question, it does highlight the power of mag-\nnetic conjunctions to probe the dynamics of magnetosphere-\nionosphere coupling and to sharpen the points where more\nunderstanding is required. In particular, in the present case it\nsuggests that the pulsed ionospheric flows at the cusp pole-\nward boundary and at polar cap latitudes are excited by dy-\nnamo action taking place in the HBL. Our data sets highlight\nthe physics of this coupling channel, where continued trans-\nfer of stress past the cusp Bx reversal point takes place. Of\nparticular relevance for understanding the momentum cou-\npling from the HBL is the documentation of the associated\nIMF By-regulated field-aligned current system. In our case\n(By<0) this system of currents, which we call C1-C2, is lo-\ncated at the postnoon-dusk side boundary of the polar cap.\nFor By>0 conditions, the corresponding FAC pair is located\non the prenoon side (Taguchi et al., 1993; Farrugia et al.,\n2003).

The time resolutions\nare 1 min (SOHO\/CELIAS) and 15 s (ACE\/MAG), respec-\ntively. From top to bottom, the panels display the proton\ndensity, bulk speed and temperature, the dynamic pressure,\nthe total magnetic field and its components in GSM coordi-\nnates; and the IMF clock angle (i.e. the polar angle in the\nGSM YZ plane). ACE was located at (242.5, \u20131.7, 22.4)Re\n(GSE coordinates), and SOHO was at (194.2, \u201323.0, 16.4)Re\n(also GSE), both spacecraft moving little during this inter-\nval. Using a convection delay time of 16 min from ACE to\nSOHO, the ACE measurements have been shifted forward\nby this amount and plotted together with SOHO\/CELIAS\nmeasurements. After the field and flow discontinuities at\n\u223c13:40 UT and 14:00 UT, the IMF is a steady, sunward-\ntilted field (Bx>0) with strong westward (By<0) and south-\nward (Bz<0) components.

Geotail\u2019s positions at the start and end times are given at the\nbottom. Geotail is alternately in the solar wind (when the two traces\nagree) and the magnetosheath. The excellent agreement in the (i)\nclock angle and (ii) By at around 14:30\u201315:00 UT implies that the\ndelay of 72 min used in the overlay is reliable.\nstarting at 14:00 UT at the second discontinuity and termi-\nnating at 14:30 UT. After the pressure release, this quan-\ntity remains steady at slightly lower-than-normal values of\n1.5 nPa. We now wish to obtain the delay time for the in-\nterplanetary measurements at the position of SOHO to affect\nCluster 1. We align the end of the pressure drop at SOHO\nwith a strong and sharp decrease in density (from \u223c40 to\n\u223c10 cm\u22123) seen on Cluster 1 (shown in Fig. 5 below). As ex-\nplained when discussing the Cluster observations, this pres-\nsure drop caused the spacecraft to transit from the exterior\ncusp (i.e. the magnetosheath outside the cusp region), char-\nacterized by a high plasma density and low magetic field\nstrength, to a cusp boundary layer on the poleward side of the\ncusp. This timing procedure yields a delay time of 68 min.\nTo further check that this delay is correct, we compared ACE\nwith Geotail data. Geotail was located near the dawn ter-\nminator sampling mainly the magnetosheath but crossing the\nbow shock occasionally. Its position was (\u20134, \u201324, 4) Re at\n13:00 UT and (\u20131.6, \u201323, 4) Re at 17:00 UT.

The agreement is very good.\nFor example, compare quantities By and the clock angles be-\ntween 14:24 and 15:00 UT when both spacecraft are situated\nin solar wind, and the clock angle profiles (panel 4), when\nGeotail is in the magnetosheath. Thus, given that Geotail is\nnear the dawn terminator, while Cluster 1 is at the frontside,\nthe 68 min SOHO\/ACE-Cluster delay is reasonable.\n2.2 Conjunction geometry\nFigures 3 and 4 show an overview of the conjunction ge-\nometry. Figure 3 plots on a geographic grid the magnetic\nfootprints of FAST and Cluster 1. The dotted circles refer\nto geographic latitudes of 45\u25e6, 60\u25e6, and 75\u25e6. The magnetic\nfootprints of the spacecraft at an altitude of 100 km were ob-\ntained from the field line mapping of Tsyganenko\u2019s [1989]\nmodel for a Kp value=4, which is the value measured dur-\ning 15:00\u201318:00 UT. The red symbols at 1 min spacing mark\nthe mapped FAST trajectory from 15:30 to 15:50 UT. The\nmagnetic footprints of the Cluster spacecraft are shown by\noverlapped colored traces (green: Cluster 1) for the longer\ntime interval 07:00 to 16:00 UT for clarity. We shall ex-\namine mainly data returned by the spacecraft during 15:30\u2013\n16:00 UT. At the time of nominal conjunction between Clus-\nter and FAST, 15:44\u201315:45 UT, the footprints are close to the\nS\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m radar station in Greenland, shown by the blue\ndot. It can be seen that the conjunction between these three\nobservation sites is very good.\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction 2895\nFig. 4.

Also\nshown are the footprints of FAST and Cluster 1 and the location\nof the S\u00f8ndrestrom radar station.\nTo include the ground perspective, Fig. 4 shows the fields-\nof-view (FOV) of the SuperDARN radars at Stokkseyri (Ice-\nland West) and Kapuskasing (in red) at 14:45 UT. Mag-\nnetic local time (MLT) is plotted against magnetic latitude\n(MLAT). Beams 3, 6, 9 of the Iceland West radar and beams\n12, 14, 15 of Kapuskasing are indicated. The Iceland West\nradar FOV looks in a dusk-dawn direction across local mag-\nnetic noon. The Kapuskasing FOV looks duskward and in\na much more poleward direction. Superposed on the plot\nare the footprints (at 15:45 UT) of FAST and Cluster 1, as\nmapped by Tsyganenko\u2019s 1989 model, and the location of\nS\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m (plus symbol). It can be seen that the footprints\nof FAST and Cluster 1 lie well within the FOV of Iceland\nWest and we shall concentrate on return echoes from this\nradar, coordinating these with the returns for the S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m\nradar.\nWe next describe the measurements made at the individ-\nual observing sites. In the discussion we interrelate these\nmeasurements to arrive at a comprehensive and coherent pic-\nture of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dur-\ning Cluster 1\u2019s sojourn in a boundary layer downstream of\nthe cusp.\nFig. 5.

The density panel shows the solar wind density (red)\nand dynamic pressure (violet), properly time-shifted. The main in-\nterval of study (15:36\u201316:00 UT) is shown between vertical guide-\nlines.\n2.3 Cluster 1 observations\nFigure 5 shows the magnetic field and plasma flow parame-\nters from the Cluster 1\/CIS and FGM instruments. The data\nare plotted at spin-average time resolution (4 s). Specifically,\nfor the interval 13:00\u201318:00 UT, the figure displays the GSM\ncomponents of the magnetic field, the total field, the proton\ndensity, temperature, GSM components of the flow velocity\nand the total bulk speed. (The drop in the density at 17:00\u2013\n18:00 UT is an artefact.) The red and green traces in panel\n5 are the solar wind density and dynamic pressure, respec-\ntively, time shifted as explained earlier and included for ref-\nerence. Position information is given at the bottom: the UT,\nMLAT (invariant latitude, ILAT, in parenthesis) and MLT of\nthe spacecraft position, its location in GSM coordinates and\nits radial distance. During these 5 h, the spacecraft is follow-\ning an outbound orbit close to the 15:00 MLT meridian, at\na radial distance which increases from 10.0Re to 13.4Re.\nThe approximate constancy of ILAT indicates a trajectory\napproximately along the dipolar field L-shell at 80\u25e6 ILAT.\n2896 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction\nFig. 6. An expanded view of the Cluster 1 observations during\n15:30\u201316:00 UT. From top to bottom are displayed the plasma\ndensity, pairwise flow and field components, total field and total\nflow strengths. We marked and numbered all flow bursts exceeding\n140 km\/s (see bottom panel). The legend gives the radial distance,\nMLT and invariant latitude of the spacecraft.\nVery low values of the density and a fluctuation-free mag-\nnetic field indicate that the spacecraft is inside the magneto-\nsphere until \u223c14:10 UT. From 14:10 to 15:30 UT, the high\ndensity and sporadically depressed field indicate a traversal\nthrough the exterior cusp. The positive Bx indicates further\nthat the spacecraft is tailward of the bifurcation line in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. A reorientation of the field during the\npassage of the high pressure solar wind takes place during\n15:20\u201315:30 UT, where Bz\u223c0 and the field is mainly in Bx\n(>0) and By . This is possibly an encounter with the northern\ntail lobe. At 15:35 UT when the solar wind dynamic pres-\nsure decrease occurs, and for the subsequent 25 min, Cluster\n1 encounters a region of plasma characterized by bursts of\nhigh speed flow (horizontal blue bars). Simultaneous with\nthese sporadically enhanced flows, the magnetic field exe-\ncutes large-amplitude fluctuations. The positive GSM Bx\nand Bz\u22480 strongly suggest that Cluster 1 is now situated in\na boundary layer downsteam of the cusp. After \u223c16:16 UT,\nthe spacecraft enters the magnetosheath.\nTo sum up, we have an outbound pass by Cluster 1 into\nthe high-latitude, exterior cusp at \u223c12 RE , characterized by\nhigh density and a depressed field, and then in the boundary\nlayer tailward of the cusp after the pressure drop arriving at\n15:35 UT. A steady southwest IMF orientation was retained\nafter the pressure change (Fig. 1). Flow bursts are seen dur-\ning 15:35\u201316:00 UT. The phenomena associated with these\nflows form the centerpiece of the present multiple conjunc-\ntion study.\nFigure 6 shows an expanded plot of the plasma and field\nparameters from Cluster 1 for the interval of interest 15:30\u2013\n16:00 UT: proton density, pairwise components of the flow\nand field, the total field and the total bulk speed. About\neight flow bursts may be seen exceeding the background\nvalue of 140 km\/s\u22121 (dot-dashed line, lowest panel), num-\nbered as shown. Each flow burst is accompanied by deflec-\ntions in the velocity and magnetic field components. These\ndisturbances are particularly strong in the vx (negative) and\nvz (positive) components, indicating that the flow is deflected\ntailward and northward during these bursts. Note the general\ntendency for the density to increase within the events. This\nsuggests a connection to the dense magnetosheath plasma.\nMany flow bursts are associated with strong field depres-\nsions. However, the sum of the proton and field pressures,\nnkT+B2\/8pi , maximizes or stays nearly constant in each\nevent (not shown).\nThe first flow burst is encountered shortly after the inferred\nentry of Cluster 1 into the cusp boundary layer. As Fig. 5\nalso confirms, no flow bursts were seen before this time when\nCluster 1 was in the exterior cusp. This implies that under the\nprevailing south-westerly IMF orientation, the flow bursts are\nbeing observed only at the poleward side of the cusp.\nWe now consider the ensemble of flows in 15:35\u2013\n16:00 UT, assume temperature isotropy of the plasma to sim-\nplify the calculations, and check the Alfve\u00b4n relation:\n1B = (4pi\u03c1)1\/21V ,\n(see, e.g. Sonnerup et al., 1981). To obtain the per-\nturbations in the velocity and magnetic fields we sub-\ntract the background fields by carrying out a running box-\ncar average of width 2 min (30 points). We then ob-\ntain the following regression lines: 1Bx=0.126+0.791Ax ;\n1By=\u22120.073+0.811Ay ; and 1Bz=\u22120.063+1.301Az.\nThe regression lines are plotted in Fig. 7, where the abscissa\nis 1A\u2261(4pi\u03c1)1\/21V. The correlation coefficents are 0.82\n(x), 0.65 (y) and 0.86 (z) over 383 data points, which makes\nfor a correlation valid above the 99% confidence level. We\nconclude that these are most likely Alfve\u00b4nic fluctuations at\nthe poleward side of the cusp. They are the Alfve\u00b4nic waves\nwhich carry field-aligned current to the ionosphere, and thus\nmediate momentum transfer along open field lines which are\ngenerated by time-varying reconnection (Cowley et al., 1991;\nGlassmeier and Stellmacher, 1996; see also review by Cow-\nley, 1999). We have thus shown directly the mediator of the\nMI coupling in transient reconnection in this case.\nFlow bursts are concentrated in 8 or so \u201cevents\u201d, where\nV reaches almost solar wind values. We shall argue later,\nafter comparison with ground-based observations and with\nprevious studies, that these are reconnected flux tubes being\nC. J.

They are being observed at a boundary\nlayer downstream of the cusp, when their motion is governed\nmainly by the magnetosheath flow. We recall that this loca-\ntion is not far from that where Haerendel et al. (1978) orig-\ninally reported flux erosion events (see also Rijnbeek and\nCowley, 1984), which were attributed to pulsed reconnec-\ntion.\nDirectional information on the plasma flow may also be in-\nferred from the spectrograms of Fig. 8, which show differen-\ntial energy fluxes at Cluster 1 in three pitch-angle windows:\n0\u201330\u25e6 (\u201cparallel\u201d to the field), 80\u2013100\u25e6 (\u201cperpendicular\u201d to\nthe field), and 150\u2013180\u25e6 (\u201cantiparallel\u201d to the field). It ap-\npears that during the flow bursts, the antiparallel and perpen-\ndicular components to the field are enhanced in the events. In\nmost of the cases, therefore, there appears to be a net plasma\noutflow at Cluster 1, i.e. flows directed tailward.\nFig. 8. Spectrograms showing the differential energy fluxes from\nCluster 1 in three pitch angle bins, from top to bottom, along (pitch\nangle between 0 and 30\u25e6), perpendicular (80\u2013100\u25e6) and antiparallel\nto the magnetic field (150\u2013180\u25e6). The flow burst times are shown\nby vertical guidelines. The data are consistent with the concept of\ntailward\u2013convecting flux tubes passing over Cluster.\n2.4 FAST observations\nA confirmation that the pulsed flows at Cluster are indeed\nreconnection-related comes from a fortuitous quarter: FAST,\nmaking observations in the topside ionosphere conjugate to\nCluster 1. Recall that nominal conjunction with Cluster 1\ntook place at \u223c15:44\u201315:45 UT. In the interval 15:42 and\n15:47 UT, FAST was following the \u223c13:00 MLT meridian\nat an average height of about 900 km with an ILAT which\ndecreases from 82.2\u25e6 to 64.9\u25e6. In this interval it recorded an\nion energy-latitude dispersion of the stepped cusp variety.\nThe relevant data is shown in Fig. 9 which displays elec-\ntron and ion spectrograms for the period 15:42\u201315:47 UT.\nFAST is initially in the polar cap, characterized by the pres-\nence of a tenuous and homogeneous electron precipitation up\nto\u223c500 eV and the absence of ion precipitation, indicative of\npolar rain. Cusp\/mantle precipitation is then encountered be-\ntween 15:43:42 UT and 15:44:20, extending from 76.5\u25e6 and\n74.3\u25e6 ILAT. Cusp\/cleft precipitation is encountered between\n15:44:20 and 15:44:40 UT. After\u223c15:45 UT, ion differential\nenergy fluxes reach up to high energies, originating from the\ndayside extension of the central plasma sheet (CPS; Newell\n2898 C. J.

Since the latter are on closed field lines,\nand the former are believed to be on open field lines, the\nopen\/closed field line boundary is encountered by FAST at\n\u223c15:45 UT at an ILAT of \u223c72\u25e6.\nWhen inside the cusp\/cleft, two subregimes are encoun-\ntered which are both characterized by a mixture of cusp-type\nand dayside boundary plasma sheet (BPS; Newell and Meng,\n1992; Lockwood, 1997) electron precipitation. The latter\nelectrons extend to above 1 keV. In the ion data these regimes\nform a three-step precipitation feature (staircase-type signa-\nture). This is a stepped cusp ion energy-latitude dispersion\npredicted by Cowley et al. (1991) to result from transient\nreconnection (see also Lockwood and Smith, 1989; Newell\nand Meng, 1991; Escoubet et al., 1992). The lower energy\ncutoff increases with decreasing latitude as the spacecraft in-\ntercepts progressively \u201cyounger\u201d reconnected flux tubes (i.e.\nthose which were reconnected later). In an ILAT span of\nabout 3 deg, we can make out three cusp ion steps. Note\nthat a 3-deg ILAT span at 900 km height maps out to a much\nlonger distance at Cluster 1 heights, which Cluster 1 would\ntake many minutes to traverse. We conclude therefore that\nthe plasma flow bursts at Cluster 1 in the appropriate time\ninterval are related to the steps in the staircase ion dispersion\nnear 13:00 MLT. Following the interpretation of stepped cusp\n(e.g. Cowley et al., 1991; Lockwood and Smith, 1992, 1994),\nwe have a self-consistency check that the flow bursts at Clus-\nter 1 are reconnection-related.\nThe direction of the currents threading the stepped cusp\nprecipitation at FAST may be inferred from the gradients\nin the east-west component of the magnetic field. Data are\navailable in SM coordinates at 8 samples s\u22121 from which the\nIGRF 1995 model field has been subtracted. The SM coordi-\nnate system has the z-axis pointing along the Earth\u2019s dipole,\nthe XZ plane contains the solar direction, and the y-axis is\npositive east. We carry out a minimum variance analysis\n(Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967) for the interval 15:43\u201315:46 UT,\nwhich contains the stepped cusp precipitation. The results\nare shown in Fig. 10. The routine picks out a very well-\ndefined normal (ratio of intermediate to minimum eigenval-\nues = 22.6). The normal component of the field is Bk=24.8\n\u00b1 9.1 nT. The coordinates of the principal axes are noted in\nthe different panels of Fig. 10. (The last panel DB gives\nthe difference between the measured field and IGRF95.) In\nparticular, DBi is the magnetic deflection mostly along the\neast-west direction (y-component=0.92). The stepped cusp\nis threaded by a pair of currents, marked C1 and C2. The\nnegative gradient in C1 seen by a spacecraft travelling equa-\ntorward implies a current into the ionosphere on the poleward\nside (down; mantle region) and the positive deflection in C2\nis a current out the ionosphere on the equatorward side (up).\nThus, the lower latitude part of the cusp has an upward cur-\nrent and the higher latitude has a downward current. This\nis as expected for the cusp currents for IMF By<0, as seen\nhere (Cowley, 1981; Lee et al., 1985; Taguchi et al., 1993;\nWatanabe et al., 1996.). We shall see later that this current\narrangement results in an eastward (tailward) E x B drift that\nis consistent with the direction of the local convection flow\nseen by the S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m radar.\nCombining Figs. 9 and 10 we can now describe the stepped\ncusp more closely. As FAST descends in latitude, it first\nmeets the oldest reconnected flux tube, whose current (into\nthe ionosphere) is denoted in Fig. 10 by C1. In its progres-\nsion tailward, this flux tube is already in mantle precipitation,\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction 2899\nas evidenced by the low energies. Note that the Cluster foot-\nprint lies in this regime, too, so for this work this is the most\nrelevant cusp ion step. FAST then encounters a shorter pre-\ncipitation step, separated from the first by a upward jump\nin the lower energy cutoff (15:44:20\u201315:44:23 UT). Another\nupward jump in energy occurs at the beginning of the third\nstep (15:44:23\u201315:44:29 UT). The ion energies extend up to\nabout 5 keV. These are denoted by C2 in Fig. 10 and are\nthreaded by an upward flowing current. These two flux tubes\nare in an earlier state of evolution than the first one, and this\nis evidenced by the higher energy of the precipitation typi-\ncal of the cusp\/cleft region. FAST thus traversed a 3-stepped\nstaircase ion dispersion as it goes from 76.5 to 73.7\u25e6 ILAT.\nA region intervenes (marked C3 in Fig. 10) character-\nized by weaker preciptation and smaller current density.\nAfter this, an apparent 2-stepped cusp precipitation is re-\nencountered (C4 in Figs. 9 and 10) with an upward cur-\nrent flowing through it. These flux tubes are marked\nby a higher energy electron precipitation than the former.\nFurthermore, the ion signature shows evidence of a dou-\nble (overlapped) dispersion in the lower step (\u223c15:44:44\u2013\n15:44:50 UT). Equatorward of this cusp ion step strong elec-\ntron precipitation appears in the energy range \u223c0.1 -1 keV.\nThis belongs to the category of dayside BPS precipitation\n(see Newell and Meng, 1992; and Lockwood, 1997). C5 is\ncharacterized by a wide latitudinal range of homgeneous CPS\nprecipitation.\n2.5 SuperDARN observations\nGlobal spatial maps of the ionospheric convection pattern\ngenerated using the map potential algorithm of Ruohoniemi\nand Baker (1998) are displayed in an MLAT-MLT format in\nFigures 11 a\u2013c. To produce these plots, line-of-sight velocity\ndata from 8 Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars were\nemployed. Details of the algorithm parameters are shown at\nlower left. We used a 60-min lag time - not a critical quantity\nin steady IMF conditions such as these and, in any case, close\nto the delay time we inferred above - to select the appropri-\nate statistical model to fill in data gaps. Excellent data cov-\nerage exists on the post-noon sector anyway, so this region is\npractically independent of statistics. The FAST trajectory has\nbeen overlaid on these plots. The bars on the FAST trajectory\nrepresent the latitudinal range traversed by FAST during the\ncorresponding 1-min SuperDARN radar scan. The relation\nof FAST observations to the global convection is discussed\nlater. Here we concentrate on the SuperDARN observations.\nThe three figures refer to the interval 15:43:00-\n15:46:00 UT in 1 min segments, a time span corresponding\nto the middle of the interval of interest. The figures show\nthe measured ionospheric convection pattern with continu-\nous streamlines superposed. A convection throat is appar-\nent from 11:00\u201313:00 MLT. Very evident is the presence of\npre- and post-noon convection cells. There is only a slight\nasymmetry about the noon meridian, but this may be be-\ncause the eastward flows observed by S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m in the\npoleward region are not well imaged by SuperDARN, so the\nactual asymmetry may be underrepresented. The maps in-\ndicate that the large-scale picture of the dayside convection\npattern is imaged rather well, with particularly large noon-\nward flows (of the order of 1000 m\/s\u22121) generally centred\nat around \u223c13:00\u201314:00 MLT and 72\u201375\u25e6 MLAT, the lat-\nter being the FAST position between 15:44 UT\u201315:45 UT\n(Fig. 11b). Somewhat smaller-magnitude flows, also noon-\nward at this MLT-MLAT location, are also seen in the pre-\nnoon sector at \u223c07:30\u201309:00 MLT and \u223c75\u25e6 MLAT. Pre-\nsumably both these flow regions are a consequence of ongo-\ning reconnection as flux is opened and dragged into the polar\ncap region (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nThe post-noon sector flows are particularly well observed\nby the Iceland West radar (symbol W in Figures 11, near top\nleft). Earlier, Fig. 4 showed the FOV and selected beams\nof this radar, as well as those of the Kapuskasing (symbol\n\u201cK\u201d in Fig. 11, top right) radar in an MLT\/MLAT coordinate\nsystem at 15:45 UT. For the 1-hour interval 15:15\u201316:15 UT,\nFig. 12 shows returns from the beams 3, 6, 9 (those indicated\nin Fig. 4) from the Iceland West radar at Stokkseyri. For each\nof the individual beams, the l-o-s Doppler shifted velocity\nand the received backscattered power are plotted. All the\nvelocity panels have a uniform colour coding; likewise for\nthe backscatter power panels.\nThe pulsed velocity structures (shown arrowed in the beam\n6 panels) are very striking. In each beam, flow channels con-\ntaining high l-o-s velocities (red color) can be seen moving\naway from the radar, this direction corresponding to a mainly\nwestward motion (Fig. 4). This sense of motion of the struc-\ntures can also be clearly seen in the backscattered power data\n(see, e.g. panel 4). The flow speed is remarkably high, in\nexcess of 1500 m s\u22121 at times. These are classic examples\nof poleward moving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs; shown\nby slanted lines for those within the interval covered also by\nCluster observations; Wild et al., 2001), which are the radar\ncounterpart of the optical poleward moving auroral forms\n(PMAFs; Sandholt et al., 1986, 1990). In line with previous\nwork (Wild et al., 2001, and references therein) we interpret\nthese as the signatures of flux transfer events.\nThere is a close correspondence between the velocity\npulses seen by Beam 6, which is close to the Cluster foot-\nprint (Fig. 4), and the flow enhancements seen by Cluster and\nshown in Fig. 6. This remarkable correspondence is high-\nlighted by arrows in both the Doppler l-o-s velocities and\nin the backscatter power. An exact agreement between the\nnumbers of flow bursts on Cluster and the PMRAFs is nei-\nther present nor is it expected. As explained in Neudegg et\nal., 2000, when FTEs at the magnetopause repeat in intervals\nshorter than the response time of the ionosphere, the radars\nare not able to resolve individual FTE signatures, but only\ngive a general enhancement of the flow.\nWe have marked at the top of Fig. 12 the intervals cor-\nresponding to the FAST and Cluster 1 passes, respectively.\nThe relationship between FAST and Cluster observations in\nthe interval marked on the SuperDARN measurements will\nbe taken up in the Discussion.\n2900 C.

Velocity vectors from this radar are plotted in\na magnetic latitude versus UT format for the interval 15:30\u2013\n16:00 UT in Fig. 13. One complete scan takes \u223c4 min. Red\ncoloring indicates westward- and violet indicates eastward-\ndirected flows.\nThe radar documents well the position of the convection\nreversal boundary during the interval we study. Located\ninitially at \u223c74\u25e6, it shifts northward by 1.5 deg during the\nnext 10\u201315 min and then approaches 74\u25e6 again at the end\nof the interval. Comparing with FAST observations of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary (at 72\u25e6, Fig. 9) the convec-\ntion reversal is located \u223c2\u25e6 poleward of this.\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction 2901\nAt the time of our conjunction, strong eastward (tail-\nward) flows occur within 76\u201377\u25e6 MLAT immediately pole-\nward of the convection reversal. They reach a maximum\nof \u223c2000 m\/s\u22121. These flows are located near the foot-\nprint of Cluster 1, which also observed eastward (tailward)\nflows. These flow pertubations corrugate the convection re-\nversal boundary, as predicted by Cowley et al. (1991) and\nLockwood (1997). The flows at S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m are exam-\nples of pulsed ionospheric flows which are coupled to the\nsolar wind-magnetosphere dynamo in the HBL, along old\nopen flux tubes that were generated at an earlier stage by\na transient reconnection process (Pinnock et al., 1993, 1995;\nRodger and Pinnock, 1997; Neudegg et al., 1999; Provan\net al., 2002). The pulsed flows equatorward of the convec-\ntion reversal (directed westward) are related to newly-opened\nfield lines, while the channel of strong eastward flows pole-\nward of the convection reversal is situated on older open\nflux coupled to the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo in the\nHBL. The pulsed nature of the aurora in this MLT sector\n(poleward of the convection reversal) has been documented\nfor a similar IMF condition (By<0) by Farrugia et al. (1995).\n3 Discussion\nWe have presented a comprehensive description at three al-\ntitudes (the high-latitude magnetopause boundary layer, the\ntopside ionosphere at \u223c900 km, and the ionosphere at 200\u2013\n500 km altitude, the latter referring to the altitude range of\nthe radar range gates) of reconnection-associated enhanced\nflows, precipitation, ionospheric flow channels, and large-\nscale convection patterns, thereby uniting various strands in\nthe current understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI)\ncoupling during time varying reconnection. Elements of this\ncurrent understanding addressed in the work were: (i) bursts\nof high speed flows at a boundary layer downstream of the\ncusp; (ii) Alfve\u00b4n waves carrying field-aligned currents to the\nionosphere down reconnected flux tubes; (iii) a ion energy-\nlatitude dispersion signature of the staircase type; (iv) pulsed\nionospheric flows (PIFS); and (v) poleward-moving radar au-\nroral forms (PMRAFs). The obervations were acquired dur-\ning a magnetic conjunction of Cluster 1 (outbound through\nthe cusp poleward boundary at 12RE), FAST (at the topside\nionosphere at altitudes of 800\u20131000 km), and the S\u00f8ndrest\u00f8m\nradar which took place within the FOV of the SuperDARN\nradar Iceland West. The observations benefitted by FAST\u2019s\nability to separate spatial from temporal structures. The\nemphasis of this paper is on phenomenology. In this dis-\ncussion we therefore relate the observations at the various\nheights pairwise, to establish a self-consistent picture of the\nresponse to momentum transfer at high-latitudes. Finally,\nwe mention the importance of the observations on theories\nof the generation of momentum transfer during solar wind-\nmagnetospheric-ionospheric coupling.\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003\nT\nCLU- STER\nFig. 12.

The outer vertical guidelines indicate the con-\njunction with Cluster, while the inner, that with FAST. On beam 6\nwe have shown by arrows the flow bursts moving poleward, also\nmarked by slanted lines. Flows of around 1000 m\/s\u2212\u22121 and higher\nare observed.\n3.1 Correlating the observations\n3.1.1 Cluster 1 and SuperDARN\nWe now relate Cluster 1 and SuperDARN measurements\nwhen Cluster 1 is observing fast flows from 15:30\u201316:00 UT\n(Fig. 6). The flow at Cluster is bursty in nature, with high\nspeed jets of the order of 220 km\/s\u22121, which is a substan-\ntial fraction of the speed of the solar wind (Fig. 1), recurring\nevery 2\u20135 minutes. In Fig. 6, all flows which are above a cer-\ntain background value (140 km\/s) are marked, irrespective of\ntheir duration or proximity to neighboring flows. The field\nline mapping in Fig. 4 shows the Cluster footprint to be close\nto the FOV of beam 6 of the Iceland West radar, so that we\ncompare Cluster observation with the echoes from beam 6.\nIn the Iceland West plot of Fig. 12, this interval is delimited\nby the outer vertical guidelines. A sequence of poleward-\nmoving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs\/PIFs) is seen by the\nradar, marked by slanted lines and arrows. The lifetime of\nthe individual PMRAFs within the FOV of the radar is 10\u2013\n15 min. They recur at a rate of 1 every 4\u20135 min on average. It\nthus appears that the repetition rate is slower on SuperDARN\n2902 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction\nFig. 13. Ion drift velocities from the S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m radar between\n15:30\u201316:00 UT. A clear convection reversal boundary may be seen\nbetween latitudinal sectors of noonward (sunward, red) and tailward\nflow (violet). Note the boundary corrugations. Tailward flows of\nthe order of 2 km\/s\u22121 are observed poleward of the convection re-\nversal. These flows are being seen at the footprint of Cluster at\n15:40\u201315:45 UT.\nthan on Cluster. Previous studies of repetitive ionospheric\nflows (Wild et al., 2001), and references therein) have, how-\never, established that two neighbouring flow bursts will not\nbe distinguished separately from the background and will\nmerge if they recur within less than 2\u20133 min of each other.\nBearing this in mind, we feel that the correspondence at the\ntwo heights is impressive. We may consider the flow bursts\nat Cluster 1 as the high-altitude counterpart of the PIFs at\nionospheric heights.\n3.1.2 Cluster 1 and S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m\nS\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m lies close to the footprint of Cluster (Fig. 3).\nThe Cluster footprint lies inside the channel of eastward (tail-\nward) flows recorded by the radar just poleward of the con-\nvection reversal boundary. The radar measured flow speeds\nreaching values of \u223c2 km\/s\u22121 (Fig. 13). In addition, the\nionospheric flows are also bursty, as inferred from Super-\nDARN. We emphasize that the enhanced flows are also di-\nrected in an eastward (tailward) direction, i.e. in the same\ndirection as the high speed flows at Cluster, which were of\norder 240 km\/s\u22121. The agreement at two heights with re-\nspect to the flow direction and intermittent character furnish a\nstrong consistency check on our interpretation of a sequence\nof reconnected flux tubes sweeping past Cluster, implying as\nit does a coherent motion of the hypothesized reconnected\ntubes.\n3.1.3 Cluster 1 and FAST\nThrough the joint FAST-Cluster observations, the Cluster\nfootprint is inferred to be embedded in the regime of man-\ntle precipitation and associated FACs. We have produced\ndirect observational evidence of Alfve\u00b4nic structures at Clus-\nter. These are the waves which carry field-aligned currents\nto drive the ionosphere. It would be desirable to also con-\nfirm their presence at FAST. This is impracticable, however,\npartly because of the very disparate resolution of the field\nand plasma data (the former being 40 times the latter), but\nmainly because the density and the composition at FAST\nheights vary strongly with altitude and FAST does change\nits altitude from \u223c1000 km to \u223c800 km in the 2 min from\n15:43:30-15:45:30.\nThe stepped cusp ion precipitation was observed by FAST\nat the ionospheric footprint of magnetic field lines at the high\naltitude portion of which flow bursts were observed by Clus-\nter. This is a further consistency check that what we are wit-\nnessing at FAST is the effect of temporal changes in the re-\nconnection rate. In previous work, Yeoman et al. (1997) and\nFarrugia et al. (1998) associated a stepped cusp ion precipita-\ntion with poleward moving auroral forms, the latter long held\nto be auroral signatures of pulsed reconnection (Sandholt et\nal., 1986, 1990). Here we have emphasized the flow chan-\nnel that is excited at the polar cap boundary in the postnoon\nsector during the prevailing negative By conditions.\n3.1.4 FAST and SuperDARN\nIn Figs. 11a-c, we have overlaid the mapped footprint of\nFAST on the global convection pattern. At 15:43\u201315:44 UT\n(Fig. 11a) FAST is just poleward of the strong noonward\nflows located at 13:00 MLT, and traversing a region of\nslightly weaker, but poleward flows. According to the FAST\nspectrograms of Fig. 9, in this 1-min interval FAST recorded\npolar rain and mantle precipitation. During 15:44\u201315:45 UT\n(Fig. 11b), i.e. during the nominal conjunction, the foot-\nprint of FAST is crossing the region of enhanced noonward\nand poleward flows. Correspondingly, Fig. 9 shows that\nthe spacecraft is observing at this time, in a magnetic lati-\ntude range 73.0\u201376.4\u25e6, a stepped cusp, consisting of 3 cusp\nion steps. According to Fig. 4, at \u223c15:45 UT, FAST is\nin the FOV of beam 6 of the SuperDARN station Iceland\nWest. Consulting the Doppler shifted velocities of beam\n6 of this radar (Fig. 12), we see that in the latitude range\n72\u201375\u25e6 the radar picks out two distinct PMRAFs in differ-\nent stages of evolution, the one at lower latitudes being the\n\u201cyounger\u201d (more recently reconnected). Through the con-\njunction, therefore, we have established a close correspon-\ndence between two individual cusp ion steps and two con-\nvection events (PMRAFs). This correspondence between the\nflows and the stepped cusp has, to our knowledge, never\nbeen delineated before in such detail. It is thus clear that\nthe stepped cusp in this event arises out of a temporal phe-\nnomenon, in this case, transient reconnection. Nevertheless,\nthis cusp appears equatorward of the flow reversal boundary.\nIn work by Trattner et al. (1999, 2002a, b) the case for a\nspatial interpretation of cusp ion steps was argued. This was\nbased on the observation in case event studies of the same\nstructures (stepped cusp) being seen by two spacecraft even\nwhen their cusp traversals were separated by hours. This\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction 2903\nwork of Trattner et al. shows that, sometimes, spatial struc-\nturing does occur. However, the present work demonstrates\nclearly that cusp ion steps can indeed be due to temporal vari-\nations in the reconnection rate, in accord with the original\n\u201cpulsating cusp\u201d model (Cowley et al., 1991; Lockwood and\nSmith, 1992, 1994). In recent work, it has been even possible\nin a case example to separate spatial from temporal features\nof the cusp, where the the temporal interpretation of the cusp\nion steps themselves was retained (see Farrugia et al., 2004).\nDuring 15:45\u201315:46 UT, (Fig. 11c), FAST is in the latitude\nrange 72.0\u201368.5\u25e6 and traversing the equatorward boundary\nof the flow convection channel. The spectrograms of Fig. 9\nshow at this time that FAST entered into CPS-type precipi-\ntation, hallmarked by homogeneous and energetic ion fluxes.\nThese ion fluxes are accompanied by discrete, increased elec-\ntron fluxes of energy <300 eV. At this time, FAST is in the\nFOV of beam 3 of the Iceland West radar, which sees a flow\nburst at the same latitudes (top panel of Fig. 12). This points\nto a correspondence between CPS precipitation and pulsed\nionospheric flows, and may imply that transient reconnection\nhas also affected the convection on closed field lines. Such a\nnotion is consistent with the Cowley and Lockwood (1992)\nmodel of the excitation of ionospheric flows.\n3.1.5 FAST and S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m\nFAST crossed into CPS precipitation on closed field lines at\n\u223c15:45 UT when, as stated, it was in the latitude range 72.0\u2013\n68.5\u25e6. The S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m flow data confirm that this open-\nclosed field-line boundary lies equatorward of the convection\nreversal boundary by about 2 degrees (Fig. 13). Note that the\nSuperDARN PIFs seen by Iceland West appear to have been\nmainly in the lower latitude region of continuing westward\nflow.\nIn the S\u00f8ndrestr\u00f8m plot of Fig. 13 we have marked by\nopen squares the position of the FAST footprint at 15:43,\n15:44, 15:45, 15:46 UT. (Note that we use corrected geo-\nmagnetic latitudes computed for the year 2001 and mapped\nto 100 km. At the Earth\u2019s surface the PACE geomagnetic\ncoordinates and the corrected geomagnetic coordinates are\nidentical.) Consulting this figure and Fig. 9, we establish\nthe following correspondencies. At 15:44 UT, the footprint\nis in the center of the channel of strong eastward (tailward)\nflows north of the convection reversal. From Fig. 9 we find\nthat this corresponds to particle precipitation and FAC regime\nC1, characterized by downward FAC and mantle precipita-\ntion. We find that the channel of strong eastward (tailward)\nflows is electromagnetically connected with the C1-C2 field-\naligned system. At 15:45 UT the footprint now lies equator-\nward of the convection reversal, on westward flows. From\nFig. 9, this corresponds to the interface C4\/C5, which is the\nopen-closed field line boundary. Thus this boundary is lo-\ncated 1\u20132 deg south of the convection reversal. At 15:46 UT\nFAST is near the equatorward boundary of the channel of\nstrong westward flows, on closed field lines. From Fig. 9,\nFAST is at this time well within the regime of CPS precipita-\ntion. The present observation of enhanced flow speed in the\nregime of mantle precipitation is consistent with PIF charac-\nteristics that were previously observed (Provan et al., 2002;\nSandholt et al., 2003).\n3.2 The observations in the context of solar wind-\nmagnetosphere interactions\nA broader issue on solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling raised by the multiple conjunction concerns the role\nof the high-latitude boundary layer in momentum transfer un-\nder a southwest IMF. In classical theories of reconnection\nbetween the IMF and the geomagnetic field, it is often as-\nsumed that for an IMF with a strong southward component,\nas here, reconnection takes place at subsolar latitudes. The\nreconnected flux tubes formed by transient reconnection then\nmove tailward and poleward under a combination of mag-\nnetic tension forces (j\u00d7B) and magnetosheath flow. By the\ntime they reach the downstream side of the cusp, the j\u00d7B\nforce has reversed and the reconnected flux tubes are extract-\ning energy from the flow (Tanaka, 2003).\nAt the time when flux erosion events were first seen in\nHEOS 2 data, at a locale comparable to ours, Haerendel et\nal. (1978) suggested that \u201centry of magnetosheath plasma\nshould not be restricted to the cusp region but may con-\ntinue further down the tail or along the early morning or late\nevening flanks, depending on the initial orientation of the ex-\nternal field. The interface with the tail probably consists of\na rotational discontinuity followed by an expansion wave.\u201d\nThe subsequent remarkable advances made through the anal-\nysis of the extensive ISEE 1 and 2 data sets, obtained at lower\nlatitudes, shifted attention to the subsolar region as the place\nwhere FTEs - equivalent to flux erosion events, Rijnbeek and\nCowley (1984) - are initiated and momentum transfer takes\nplace. Our detailed observations suggest, however, that the\noriginal suggestion of Haerendel et al. (1978) may need to\nbe re-assessed. In particular, the high-latitude boundary layer\n(HBL) may be an active site of momentum transfer from the\nsolar wind to the magnetosphere during those events which at\nlow altitudes are manifested in the form of high-speed flows\nin the regime of mantle precipitation, the PIFs.\nThe channel of high-speed flows is coupled to the C1-C2\nFAC system. This current system is identical to the IMF By-\nregulated HCC-LCC currents of Taguchi et al. (1993). In this\nstudy we reported the version of the current system which\nis appropriate to the prevailing By<0 conditions. The corre-\nsponding current system for By>0 is located on the prenoon-\ndusk side of the polar cap. The association between the high-\nlatitude plasma source, field-aligned currents and aurora for\nthe latter case was documented by Farrugia et al. (2003) in\na Polar-ground conjunction study. The IMF-regulated dawn-\ndusk asymmetry of this current system\/ionospheric convec-\ntion channel, which is coupled to the HBL, gives rise to\na DPY mode of ground magnetic deflection (a Svalgaard-\nMansurov effect).\nIn conclusion, we have addressed the issue of pulsed\nreconnection signatures in the coupled magnetosphere-\nionosphere system using a complement of data sets in a\n2904 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Signatures of transient reconnection in a multiple conjunction\nmultiple conjunction, and emphasized the importance of the\nHBL as a locale where continued transfer of stress takes\nplace. Our study was based on just one event, reserving\nan analysis of many events for future work. We note, how-\never, that in a very recent work Thompson et al. (2004) ob-\nserved the same type of impulsive events, though they dis-\ncussed them only from the Cluster perspective. The focus\nthere was on a sequence of reversals of the GSM Bz field\ncomponent observed downstream of the cusp, each reversal\nbeing ascribed to currents flowing perpendicular to the field.\nThese confined perpendicular currents are likely to connect\nwith the FACs we have discussed above.\nAcknowledgements.
