Introduction 21 \n1.1. Risk management in the modern water utility business 22 \nManaging risk is an essential business requirement across the process and utility sectors.  From 23 \nembedding good corporate governance within organizations through to the management of individual 24 \nprojects and assets, the ability to understand and assess risk and to implement preventive measures to 25 \nimprove control of risk is a mainstream activity (Pollard et al., 2004).  Many of the larger water utilities 26 \nhave connected their responsibilities for financial control with the risk management programmes that are 27 \nimplemented throughout their businesses, including the operational risk analysis and management 28 \nactivities at the process plant level.  In the water industry, there is a need for a continued shift in the 29 \napproach to risk management from one historically implicit to treatment plant design and operation to one 30 \nincreasingly explicit and better integrated within the core business of providing safe and wholesome 31 \ndrinking water that deserves the trust of consumers. 32 \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: Tel. 780-492-6807.

E-mail address: steve.hrudey@ualberta.ca (Steve E Hrudey) \n  2 \nThe benefits of good corporate risk management should achieve the preventive management of 1 \nrisks throughout a business.  One potential danger may be that the principal goal of assuring public health 2 \nprotection through safe drinking water may be viewed as only equivalent to many other priorities in the 3 \norganization.  With the focus increasingly on income, expenditure and whole-life costing under new 4 \ninstitutional arrangements for the provision of drinking water, new facilities are being designed to refined 5 \nand better-characterized margins of safety.  Water utilities must seek not only to meet their legislative 6 \nrequirements but also maximize the availability, serviceability and life of their assets and minimize 7 \nexpenditure on energy, chemicals and processes.  But whilst new arrangements undoubtedly offer greater 8 \nmanagement control and flexibility in decision-making, the drive for shareholder dividend or stakeholder 9 \nvalue must be second to maintaining a secure and safe water supply system.  We contend that an over-10 \nemphasis on the administration of risk management in isolation of practical knowledge on what can go 11 \nwrong in practice, can itself be a hazard.  Further, we note caution in an inappropriate use of risk 12 \nmanagement as the rationale for \u2018optimizing\u2019 infrastructure and process systems below what may 13 \ninadvertently become inadequate margins of safety.  In this paper, we discuss current advances in water 14 \nquality risk management in the light of six case studies that aptly describe what can go wrong when risk 15 \nmanagement and specifically, public health risk management fails to be the primary focus. 16 \nOn a continuing basis around the world an estimated 1.8 million people die every year from 17 \ndiarrheal diseases (including cholera). The majority of these deaths is among children in developing 18 \ncountries and up to 39% of diarrheal disease could be prevented by household water treatment by 19 \nchlorination (WHO, 2004a). By contrast, drinking water safety is largely taken for granted by many 20 \ncitizens of affluent nations.  The ability to drink water that is delivered into households without fear of 21 \nbecoming ill may be one of the key defining characteristics of developed nations in relation to the 22 \nmajority of the world. Valuing that enormous benefit appropriately must be a core value guiding risk 23 \nmanagement in the drinking water business. 24 \n 25 \n 1.1.2. A concept of safe drinking water 26 \nIf the goal of risk management in the water utility sector is to assure safe drinking water, we 27 \nneed to consider what is safe.  The concept of safety, while largely intuitive to the public, has confounded 28 \ndebates about risk management for decades.  Perhaps these debates can be resolved by first considering 29 \nwhat safe is not.  Safe does not mean zero risk.  To demand an absolute standard would guarantee that 30 \n  3 \nnothing could be considered safe, making safety a meaningless concept.  There is no sharp line between 1 \nsafe and unsafe because safety has meaning on a relative basis.  Finally, each person has an individual 2 \nnotion of safety that may vary from one risk to another.  We propose a pragmatic notion of safety as \u201ca 3 \nlevel of risk so negligible that a reasonable, well-informed individual need not be concerned about it, nor 4 \nfind any rational basis to change his\/her behaviour to avoid such a small, but non-zero risk\u201d.  This notion 5 \nwas first articulated in the context of addressing whether there could be a safe dose for exposure to a 6 \ncarcinogen, an example that squarely confronts the distinction between safety and zero risk (Hrudey & 7 \nKrewski, 1995).  More recently, the issue of what constitutes safe drinking water was addressed for Part 2 8 \nof the Walkerton Inquiry (Canada) that was charged with recommending how a disaster like the 9 \nWalkerton drinking water disease outbreak, which killed seven and made 2,300 ill, could be prevented 10 \nfrom re-occurring in Ontario (O'Connor, 2002b). A similar notion of drinking water safety was adopted. 11 \nIn the context of drinking water, and given our current capability for reducing risk, this notion of 12 \nsafe drinking water should mean that we do not expect to die or become seriously ill from drinking or 13 \nusing it.  Assuring that drinking water is essentially free (to negligible levels) from the risk of infectious 14 \ndisease can be, and largely has been, achieved for most public water supplies in affluent nations.  The 15 \nchallenge for drinking water risk management is to maintain and extend that remarkable achievement as 16 \nwidely as possible. 17 \n 18 \n1.2. Characteristics of risk management for safe drinking water 19 \nThe Walkerton Inquiry described some essential characteristics of risk management as: 20 \n\u2022 \u201cbeing preventive rather than reactive; 21 \n\u2022 distinguishing greater risks from lesser ones and dealing first with the former; 22 \n\u2022 taking time to learn from experience; and 23 \n\u2022 investing resources in risk management that are proportional to the danger posed.\u201d (O'Connor, 24 \n2002b). 25 \n 26 \nManaging risk effectively requires making sensible decisions within the constraints of 27 \nknowledge and resources.  Risk management is an exercise of decision-making under uncertainty.  Even 28 \nif negligible scientific uncertainty could be achieved, the wide range of competing views for social 29 \npriorities would still challenge decision-making, but at least the evidentiary basis for any decision would 30 \n  4 \nbe clear.  For drinking water disease outbreaks, cases with such clarity of scientific evidence are the 1 \nexception rather than the rule.  Because there is always some uncertainty in the evidence, errors in 2 \ndecisions can be of two main types (Hrudey & Leiss, 2003; Hrudey & Rizak, 2004): 3 \n(i) a decision could be made to act when there is truly no need - a false positive error; 4 \n(ii) a decision could be made not to act, when there is truly a need - a false negative error. 5 \nThese types of errors can be illustrated by reference to some of the cases reviewed below.  The 1998 6 \nSydney water crisis has been described as a case of issuing a boil water alert for Sydney residents on the 7 \nbasis of erroneous monitoring results (Clancy, 2000), making that decision a false positive error.  8 \nWalkerton was perhaps the most severe example of a false negative error.  Warnings at Walkerton about 9 \ndrinking water quality had been ignored for over 20 years. Ultimately, tragedy ensued.  Given these 10 \nexamples, a commitment to precaution for public health decisions demands a preference for false positive 11 \nover false negative errors, because the consequences of the latter are usually more direct and potentially 12 \nmore severe.  However, there are inevitably policy implications to false positive errors as well.  In the 13 \nSydney case, tens of millions of dollars of public funds were spent on circumstances where investigation 14 \nrevealed that public health was not harmed.  The merits of the decisions involved have remained a source 15 \nof debate.  However, given their access to and understanding of the evidence provided at the outset of this 16 \nincident, the public inquiry found that health authorities chose correctly in deciding to issue a system-17 \nwide boil water alert in the first instance (McClellan, 1998).  Although the merits of each case will differ, 18 \nthe general reality remains that frequent false positive errors eventually create a \u201ccry wolf\u201d response with 19 \nthe public such that important measures like boil water advisories may be ignored when they are truly 20 \nneeded to protect public health.  Although the decision-making challenge for boil water advisories can be 21 \ncharacterized in relatively stark terms after the fact, when outcomes are known (with the benefit of 22 \nhindsight), the reality for any outbreak situation is that the evidence is usually not clear as the events are 23 \nunfolding. 24 \n 25 \n2.  Learning from experience 26 \n2.1. The analysis of failure 27 \nThe multiple barrier approach to assuring safe drinking water is founded on the maintenance of 28 \nmultiple unit processes and procedures to ensure that pathogens and undesirable chemicals do not reach 29 \nthe consumer\u2019s tap.  Maintaining these barriers to exposure is critical because, by and large, each barrier 30 \n  5 \nin series can offer orders of magnitude (log) levels of protection to the drinking water supply.  The level 1 \nof barriers required must be a function of the level of challenge posed by the source water (Figure 1).  2 \nBarriers are often thought of in terms of treatment technology but additional critical barriers involve 3 \nsource water protection, distribution security and monitoring\/response capabilities. The failure, or bypass, 4 \nof any single barrier must be a major concern for operators.  The potential technical failures that might 5 \noccur provide only part of the story because risks usually manifest themselves through a combination of 6 \ntechnical, management and human errors (Figure 2).  Undertaking a \u2018forensic analysis\u2019 of historic 7 \nincidents can highlight the aspects of risk management that are often ignored. 8 \n 9 \nFig. 1.  Drinking water risk management and the multiple barrier approach (Hrudey, 2001) 10 \n 11 \nFig. 2.  Reasons for system failures (after Hurst, 1998). 12 \n 13 \nWe performed an analysis of the major factors contributing to drinking water disease outbreaks 14 \nby searching electronically and through bibliographic cross-referencing the published English language 15 \nliterature over the past 30 years.  We screened papers for those that discussed specific disease outbreaks 16 \nin affluent nations and which described some of the failure modes contributing to the outbreak.  We did 17 \nnot attempt to review all outbreaks.  There was substantial variation in the quality and detail of the 18 \ndescription of failure mechanisms among the papers that we retrieved.  In all, over 70 case studies were 19 \nprepared from this database and are analyzed in detail elsewhere (Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004).  The case 20 \nstudies included six outbreaks where fatalities arose, causing a total of 22 deaths during or shortly after 21 \nthe outbreak and an estimated 50 to 70 deaths over the two years following the Milwaukee outbreak 22 \n(Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004).  These fatal outbreaks are summarized in Table 1. The risk management 23 \nlessons are reviewed in the next section. 24 \n 25 \n2.1. Recurring themes 26 \nThe factors contributing to outbreak failures summarized in Table 1 included: sewage 27 \ncontamination of raw water, inadequate knowledge of source water hazards, inadequate disinfection, 28 \nextreme weather (heavy precipitation, runoff), cross-connections and distribution failures, filtration 29 \nfailures, livestock or wildlife fecal contamination and process changes.  More than one mechanism was 30 \ninvolved in contributing to each outbreak and often vulnerable conditions had been in place for years, if 31 \n  6 \nnot decades.  In hindsight, all of these outbreaks were preventable. Although only fatal outbreaks from 1 \nHrudey and Hrudey (2004) are summarized below, these are reasonably representative of the features 2 \ncontributing to failure among the 70 case studies reviewed there.  3 \nThe 1983 Drumheller outbreak was caused by a spill of raw sewage upstream of the drinking 4 \nwater intake. Sewage overflows were common at this location during heavy storm flow conditions but 5 \nthis spill occurred because of a pump failure. The contamination source was certainly foreseeable. Even 6 \nthough the sewage pump station was operated by the same municipality as the drinking water utility, no 7 \nnotice of the incident was provided. The lack of notice precluded implementation of any precautionary 8 \nmeasures, such as additional treatment by the water utility. Likewise, water quality monitoring might 9 \nhave provided earlier warning to initiate a boil water advisory. In this case, the boil water advisory was 10 \nissued almost five days after the first signs of illness.  11 \nThe 1989 Cabool outbreak was caused by sewage contamination of drinking water in the 12 \ndistribution system during water main break repairs following unseasonably cold weather. The 13 \ndistribution system in this community was in poor repair and vulnerable to sewage contamination, while 14 \nthe sewer system was in worse condition experiencing regular sewer back-ups and overflows. The 15 \ngroundwater drinking water source for this community was of excellent quality and this water was 16 \ndistributed with no treatment and or real time warning system (e.g. chlorine residual monitoring). The 17 \ncombination of poorly maintained infrastructure, lack of any treatment or monitoring capacity and 18 \nunusual weather events triggering upset conditions led to this fatal outbreak. 19 \nIn 1993, Milwaukee experienced an enormous outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in a drinking water 20 \nsystem that practiced full conventional water treatment and was meeting their treated water quality 21 \nstandards at the time of the outbreak. This outbreak has been the subject of numerous publications, but the 22 \nearly speculation that the source of contamination was from upstream agricultural runoff has later been 23 \ndiscounted. The most likely source of contamination was sanitary sewage discharge from Milwaukee that 24 \nimpacted the drinking water intake for one of their treatment plants. This circumstance mirrored previous 25 \nwinter outbreaks in Milwaukee in 1916, 1936 and 1938. Despite having what appeared to be adequate 26 \nwater treatment to cope with raw water contamination, the demands for optimum filtration performance, 27 \nas measured by maximum turbidity removal, and disinfection capable of handling the chlorine-resistant 28 \npathogen, Cryptosporidium parvum, left Milwaukee vulnerable.  29 \n  7 \nIn hindsight, Milwaukee had not learned from the experience of the 1989 Swindon \u2013 Oxfordshire 1 \noutbreak in England which led to the Badenoch expert panel report documenting the measures needed to 2 \nprevent Cryptosporidium outbreaks (Badenoch et al., 1990). Likewise, there was an inadequate response 3 \nto both the turbidity spike in filtered water and a sharp rise in consumer phone complaints that 4 \ncorresponded with the contamination episode. 5 \nThe 1993 Gideon fatal outbreak was caused by poor maintenance of water storage facilities that 6 \nallowed bird fecal contamination that was flushed into the distribution system during an effort to flush the 7 \nsystem because of water quality complaints. Like Cabool, this community had a high quality groundwater 8 \nsupply feeding into a poorly maintained distribution system without any treatment barrier. 9 \nThe 1999 Washington County Fair fatal outbreak was caused by inadequate awareness of the 10 \nrisk of shallow well contamination from a nearby septic seepage field. The well in question was allowed 11 \nto supply unchlorinated water during the Fair and this source was improperly used for food and beverage 12 \nproduction with tragic consequences. The well in question had never produced adverse microbiological 13 \nmonitoring results in the intermittent, seasonal monitoring program, but a severe drought over the 14 \nprevious summer may have made this well more vulnerable to near-surface contamination.  15 \nThe Walkerton outbreak in May 2000 involved a litany of failures from the operators, through 16 \nmanagement, the provincial regulator and the Government of Ontario (O'Connor, 2002a). The shallow 17 \nwell that became contaminated by cattle manure following heavy spring rainfall that caused widespread 18 \nflooding, had been identified as vulnerable to agricultural contamination by the hydrogeologist who 19 \ninstalled the well in 1978. His warnings were not fully heeded and over the years, adverse 20 \nmicrobiological monitoring results were common without any remedial action. The operators were 21 \ninadequately trained to recognize the risks or the need for requiring adequate chlorination. In particular, 22 \nthey were oblivious to the need for monitoring chlorine residual as a real time measure of disinfection 23 \nperformance for susceptible pathogens (Hrudey & Walker, 2005). The two year, $9 million public inquiry 24 \ninto this outbreak revealed the numerous failure at many levels (O'Connor, 2002a) and made over 100 25 \nrecommendations for how drinking water safety might be assured in Ontario in the future (O'Connor, 26 \n2002a, b). 27 \nIn every case above, the numerous failures are obvious in hindsight. Yet the case studies 28 \npresented span almost 20 years and the total collection of cases these are drawn from spans 30 years 29 \n(Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004). Risk management seeks to achieve a preventive approach and therefore 30 \n  8 \neffective risk management needs to demonstrate the ability to translate the enormous collection of 1 \nhindsight available into effective foresight. 2 \n 3 \n3.  Drinking water risk management 4 \n3.1. Overall risk management for drinking water utilities 5 \nOver the past 25 years, the drinking water industry has faced rising consumer expectations and 6 \nsubstantially more stringent regulatory requirements while experiencing dramatic changes from 7 \nprivatization, sector globalization, increased competition, emerging technologies and trends towards 8 \nfinancial self-sufficiency.  These changes create both opportunities and risks across a variety of 9 \ncategories, including (Pollard et al., 2004): 10 \n(i) Financial risk.  These are risks arising principally from the financial operations and 11 \nmanagement of drinking water as a business enterprise, whether or not the operating 12 \nagency is a private entity.  13 \n(ii) Commercial risk. In many jurisdictions, drinking water utilities are no longer protected 14 \nas a public monopoly so they are no longer insulated from competition or financial 15 \ninstability.  16 \n(iii) Environmental risk.  Equipment failure or human error can lead to adverse 17 \nenvironmental impacts including waste discharges to the atmosphere, ground or water 18 \nenvironment.  19 \n(iv) Public health risk. The most vital duty of care that a drinking water utility holds is to 20 \nassure the safety of the water provided to avoid adverse impacts on public health.  21 \n(v) Reputation risk.  Even in the absence of dangers to public health, a water utility can 22 \nexperience harm if water quality characteristics of importance to consumers (taste, 23 \nodour, appearance) are impaired or customer trust is damaged. 24 \n(vi) Compliance\/legal risk.  Legislation, regulations and common law liability set out 25 \nminimum standards for water quality, the handling and storage of treatment chemicals, 26 \nthe discharge of wastes, and the health and safety of the operational staff and the people 27 \nliving nearby.  28 \n  9 \nThe foregoing analysis of failures and the discussions to follow on assuring safe drinking water are 1 \nfocussed primarily on public health risk combined with some obvious elements of reputation and 2 \ncompliance risk. 3 \n 4 \n3.2. A comprehensive risk management approach for drinking water safety (NHMRC) 5 \nA comprehensive framework has been developed in Australia to outline a Total Quality 6 \nManagement (TQM) approach for drinking water quality and safety (Rizak et al., 2003; Hrudey, 2004; 7 \nSinclair & Rizak, 2004).  It is a broad approach to the entire scope of providing drinking water and can 8 \nreadily incorporate the excellent details that have been developed by other initiatives and it has now been 9 \nadopted as the introductory framework for the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (NHMRC, 2004).  10 \nFigure 3 captures the 12 elements that make up the framework, starting with a policy commitment at the 11 \nhighest levels of responsibility in the organization to achieving drinking water quality.  Commitment 12 \nmeans more than just meeting regulatory requirements by minimal margins, but a fundamental 13 \ncommitment to continuous improvement, serving as a cornerstone for employee responsibility and 14 \nmotivation.  From this commitment flows the series of elements related to system analysis and 15 \nmanagement with which we are perhaps more familiar as risk management tools. 16 \n 17 \nFig. 3  Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality (reprinted by permission of the National Health and Medical 18 \nResearch Council, Canberra, Australia) 19 \n 20 \nAssessment of a drinking water system includes: water-supply systems analysis, the review of 21 \nwater quality data, hazard identification, and risk assessment.  Preventive measures include: the 22 \nemplacement of multiple barriers and the analysis and maintenance of critical control points.  Operational 23 \nprocedures and process control include: operating protocols, equipment capability, materials and 24 \nchemicals, operational monitoring and, ultimately, preventive and corrective actions.  Verification of 25 \ndrinking water quality includes: conventional water quality monitoring, consumer satisfaction, short-term 26 \nevaluation of results and corrective actions as required.  Incident and emergency response include 27 \ncommunication planning and response protocols. 28 \nThe supporting requirements for this Framework are elements often overlooked in the short 29 \nterm, but which are vitally important to long-term performance.  Employee issues include awareness, 30 \ninvolvement and training, with particular consideration given to the role of contractors.  Community 31 \n  10\nissues include consultation and communication to ensure that the drinking water provider is meeting the 1 \nneeds of the consumer.  Research and development has also been neglected in some perspectives when 2 \naddressing assurance of safety.  A commitment to research is vital to assure that emerging risks are 3 \nmanaged as thoroughly as possible, based on some predictive capability.  Applied research studies can 4 \ninclude investigations and research monitoring, validation of process performance and design of 5 \nequipment.  Documentation and reporting are necessary to prove that systems have been working as 6 \nplanned. 7 \nFinally, to assure everyone concerned that the systems are functioning as they should be, there 8 \nmust be review processes.  These include periodic evaluation of long-term performance and an external 9 \naudit of drinking water quality management performance.  All must be subject to review by senior 10 \nmanagement for evaluation in view of the goal of continual improvement.  This framework has been used 11 \nto restructure the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines into a TQM risk management approach that will 12 \nprovide consumers with the means for judging whether their water provider is functioning as safely and 13 \neffectively as circumstances reasonably allow.  The elements of this approach are flexible enough to 14 \nallow implementation by each state in Australia, according to its own regulatory regime.  The TQM 15 \napproach is intended to facilitate and support an effective regulatory process by helping to define the 16 \ndetails of best practice in every jurisdiction and by providing consistent approaches for demonstrating 17 \nbest practice to the regulatory authority.  The TQM approach is not intended to replace an effective 18 \nregulatory process that must be accountable to the public, only to improve the manner in which 19 \nconstructive improvements are achieved. 20 \nNow that the framework is being adopted in Australia, more detailed supporting documents are 21 \nbeing developed to guide its implementation for individual water utilities.  The core capacity of this 22 \napproach to deliver risk management for the purposes of assuring drinking water safety is found in the 23 \nsecond  and third elements of the Framework: 2. Assessment of the Drinking Water System; and 3. 24 \nPreventive Measures for Drinking Water Quality Management.  These are based on the key concepts of 25 \nhazard, hazardous event and risk, terms which are too often subject to confusion in applications of risk 26 \nmanagement.  Accordingly, they are defined in the Framework and more recently were adopted within the 27 \nconcept of Water Safety Plans of the Third  Edition of World Health Organization Guidelines for 28 \nDrinking Water Quality (WHO, 2004a): 29 \n  11\n\u2022 A hazard is a biological, chemical, physical or radiological agent that has the potential to cause 1 \nharm. 2 \n\u2022 A hazardous event is an incident or situation that can lead to the presence of a hazard (what can 3 \nhappen and how). 4 \n\u2022 Risk is the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in exposed populations in a specified 5 \ntime frame, including the magnitude of that harm and the consequences. 6 \nThese concepts can be illustrated with a pathogen.  Cryptosporidium is a hazard for any surface water 7 \nsystem because it is always potentially present given its occurrence in human sewage and\/or livestock 8 \nwastes.  A challenge to a water system by a waste source containing Cryptosporidium such as a sewage 9 \nspill is a hazardous event.  The risk associated with Cryptosporidium is the likelihood that this pathogen 10 \nwill pass through the treatment system to reach consumers in an infectious state and in numbers sufficient 11 \nto cause illness. 12 \nAn important contribution for implementing this element of a risk management approach is a 13 \nreport by Nadebaum et al. (2004) that provides comprehensive guidance on performing the hazard 14 \nidentification and risk assessment of the drinking water supply.  The assessment methodology is 15 \norganized into six steps: (1) understand your system; (2) identify hazards, hazardous events and sources; 16 \n(3) estimate risk for each identified hazard\/event; (4) plan preventive measures for each identified 17 \nhazard\/event; (5) implement and monitor preventive measures; and (6) document a risk management plan.  18 \nThe hazard identification and risk assessment methodology provided by Nadebaum et al. (2004) is 19 \nsupported by individual hazard fact sheets, case studies and summaries of hazards for microbial and 20 \nchemical contaminants.  These are extremely valuable to any water utility committed to implementing a 21 \nrisk management plan because the details of implementation must be based on local experience and the 22 \noverall approach should be comprehensive, taking full advantage of valuable experience from others.  23 \nThe extent of experience captured in this reference is illustrated by the range of 36 hazard fact sheets and 24 \nseven case studies that are provided (Table 2). 25 \n 26 \n3.3. Risk management for small treatment system 27 \nThe New Zealand Ministry of Health (NZMOH) recognized that the vast majority of the 28 \ncountry\u2019s drinking water systems were small, yet faced important challenges in providing safe drinking 29 \nwater (NZMOH, 2001).  The NZMOH also recognized that the traditional approach of relying primarily 30 \n  12\non water quality monitoring in relation to drinking water quality standards is inherently a reactive 1 \napproach.  Monitoring results are typically available only long after drinking water has left a treatment 2 \nplant and been consumed.  Thus, the NZMOH has developed a pragmatic, down-to-earth program for 3 \nencouraging Public Health Risk Management Plans (PHRMP).  This approach focuses on \u201cevents,\u201d 4 \ndefined as incidents or situations that may lead to hazards being introduced into or not being removed 5 \nfrom water (Nokes & Taylor, 2003).  In developing this approach, four barriers were identified that, if 6 \nmaintained effectively, will adequately control hazards: 7 \n\u2022 prevention of contaminants entering the raw water of the supply; 8 \n\u2022 removal of particles from the water; 9 \n\u2022 inactivation of microorganisms in the water; and 10 \n\u2022 maintenance of the quality of the water during distribution. 11 \nThis approach is meant to ensure that these barriers are present and functional to minimize the 12 \nchance of failure that would give rise to \u201cevents.\u201d  It was adopted on the premise that small water 13 \noperators could relate better to the tangible concept of an event rather than a hazard, which some 14 \noperators find to be more hypothetical.  Currently, the NZMOH has produced 40 specific, practical guides 15 \nfor various elements of typical water supply and treatment systems, all available at the NZMOH web site 16 \n(www.moh.govt.nz\/water).  Their sensible, pragmatic approach for developing a PHRMP is implemented 17 \nin 11 steps: 18 \n1. Produce an overview of the supply and decide which of the PHRMP guides are needed. 19 \n2. Identify the barriers to contamination. 20 \n3. Use the guides to identify events that may introduce hazards into the water. 21 \n4. Use the guides to identify causes, preventive measures, checks and corrective actions. 22 \n5. Decide where improvements should be made in the supply to better protect public health. 23 \n6. Decide on the order in which improvements need to be made. 24 \n7. Draw up a timetable for making the improvements. 25 \n8. Identify links to other quality systems. 26 \n9. Prepare contingency plans. 27 \n10. Prepare instructions for performance assessment of the plans. 28 \n11. Decide on communication policy and needs. 29 \nThe New Zealand system of Public Health Risk Management Plans are an excellent contribution towards 30 \ngreater drinking water safety and deserve wider application. 31 \n 32 \n4.  Discussion 33 \n  13\nA clear message that emerges from the case studies is that the painful experience at locations 1 \nthat have had drinking water outbreaks has not been readily recognized by other vulnerable utilities 2 \n(Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004).  In a few cases, outbreaks recurred in the same community indicating a failure 3 \nto determine and correct the flaws in the system.  In other cases, cogent warnings have been missed, such 4 \nas the Washington County Fair outbreaks which had a highly relevant warning for Walkerton, but which 5 \nfailed to change the course of events in Walkerton. The New York State Department of Health 6 \ninvestigation was made public in March of 2000, less than two months before the Walkerton outbreak 7 \nhappened 600 km to the west. 8 \nIn another case, Orangeville, a community only one hour away from Walkerton, experienced a 9 \nspring outbreak caused by agricultural runoff contaminating the town\u2019s shallow wells in April 1985.  The 10 \nanalysis of this outbreak published in the Canadian Journal of Public Health in 1991 noted that 11 \nchlorination required close monitoring because manure contaminated runoff could overwhelm a fixed 12 \ndose of chlorine, which is exactly what happened in Walkerton in May 2000.  13 \nThere are several key aspects of waterborne pathogens that characterize the challenge they pose 14 \nto drinking water safety. Some of these are readily evident from the outbreak case studies: 15 \n\u2022 Fecal (human or animal) contamination can be found wherever humans, their domestic animals 16 \nor wildlife reside; although exposure is reduced as sanitation and waste management are 17 \nimproved, complete elimination of potential exposure to fecal contamination is not possible. 18 \n\u2022 Loading of pathogens into a drinking water system sufficient to cause outbreaks of disease will 19 \nnot be consistent, rather it will be intermittent and infrequent when higher levels of sanitation are 20 \nachieved. As a result, extended periods without apparent problems do not guarantee future 21 \nsafety. 22 \n\u2022 Pathogens are likely to be heterogeneously distributed in water because of their origin in fecal 23 \nparticles that will not be totally dispersed in receiving waters and because of clumping promoted 24 \nin treatment processes.  25 \n\u2022 Some pathogens have high infectivity, which, combined with a likelihood of pathogens 26 \nclumping into fine particles, makes inconsistent and non-uniform consumer exposure to infective 27 \ndoses a likely mode of infection. 28 \n  14\n\u2022 Some pathogens (e.g. Cryptosporidium) are resistant to chemical disinfection, making fine 1 \nparticle removal and alternative disinfection processes, such as UV, critical elements of a 2 \nmultiple-barrier approach. 3 \n\u2022 Conditions that create a pathogen challenge to the treatment process are often event-driven (e.g. 4 \nextreme weather, unusual operating conditions), meaning that such events should be recognized 5 \nas potential triggers of trouble. 6 \n\u2022 Multiple failures in a system must usually combine for disaster to occur, particularly as more 7 \nbarriers are made effective in seeking higher degrees of safety. This reality also means that one 8 \nor more barriers can be failing and ineffective without an outbreak occurring. This makes the 9 \nindependent evaluation of treatment performance by measures such as turbidity or chlorine 10 \nresidual monitoring a necessary activity to assure that all of the multiple barriers are effective. 11 \n 12 \nMany of these challenges are intuitive for experienced drinking water professionals, but they are 13 \nnot necessarily established in the corporate memory of a water utility, particularly where substantial staff 14 \nturnover is a reality. The intuitive experience within a successful organization needs to become accessible 15 \nto struggling organizations. This implies the need for some form of networking to share experience and 16 \ngood practice. 17 \nResponses to these challenges are compounded by a number of basic limitations in relation to the 18 \npublic health significance of available monitoring capabilities: 19 \n\u2022 Monitoring methods for pathogens and useful indicators are generally neither sufficiently 20 \nsensitive nor sufficiently specific to capture the full range of pathogen threats facing a water 21 \nsystem. 22 \n\u2022 Monitoring for pathogens and useful indicators cannot be achieved in real time. 23 \n\u2022 Monitoring methods cannot be directly interpreted for public health significance because the 24 \nviability and infectivity for most pathogens is usually not determined by routine methods. 25 \n\u2022 Interpretation of monitoring results will be challenged by a preponderance of false positives 26 \nbecause of the low frequency of pathogen hazards (Hrudey & Leiss, 2003). 27 \n\u2022 Population health surveillance is insensitive and is likely blind to low-level endemic disease and 28 \nall but the largest outbreaks. 29 \n  15\n\u2022 Adaptation and tolerance (immunity) in resident populations may hide local, chronic problems 1 \nwhile leaving visitors vulnerable to infection that may be difficult to trace back to the source, 2 \nparticularly in resort communities. 3 \n 4 \nDespite the challenges and limitations, the best drinking water providers have shown an ability 5 \nto respond to a wide range of challenges with effective prevention programs. The processes in these 6 \norganizations may bend under stress, but they do not break, so failures are not allowed to accumulate to 7 \nthe point where they can impact the health of a consumer. An optimal preventive approach will be 8 \ncreative and forward-looking: 9 \n\u2022 Informed vigilance is actively promoted and rewarded. 10 \n\u2022 Understanding of the entire system, its challenges and limitations is promoted and actively 11 \nmaintained. 12 \n\u2022 Effective, real-time treatment process control, based on understanding critical capabilities and 13 \nlimitations of the technology, is the basic operating approach. 14 \n\u2022 Fail-safe multi-barriers are actively identified and maintained at a level appropriate to the 15 \nchallenges facing the system. 16 \n\u2022 Close calls are documented and used to train staff about how the system responded under stress 17 \nand to identify what measures are needed to make such close calls less likely in future. 18 \n\u2022 Operators, supervisors, lab personnel and management all understand that they are entrusted 19 \nwith protecting the public\u2019s health and are committed to honouring that responsibility above all 20 \nelse. 21 \n\u2022 Operational personnel are afforded the status, training and remuneration commensurate with 22 \ntheir responsibilities as guardians of the public\u2019s health. 23 \n\u2022 Response capability and communication are improved, particularly as post 9-11 bioterrorism 24 \nconcerns are being addressed. 25 \n\u2022 An overall continuous improvement, total quality management (TQM) mentality will pervade 26 \nthe organization. 27 \n 28 \n5.  Conclusions 29 \n  16\nRisk management approaches offer a means to benefit from the experience of past failures. A 1 \nrigorous and comprehensive approach such as reflected in the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines 2 \nmakes it possible for water utilities to improve their operations to the level of the best water utilities, 3 \nmaking it extremely unlikely that consumers ever need face a drinking water outbreak. Safe drinking 4 \nwater is a remarkable bargain for consumers and should be valued much more highly than commonly 5 \noccurs in our affluent societies. 6 \n 7 \nAcknowledgements 8 \nThe guidance and leadership of Justice Dennis O\u2019Connor provided the inspiration for pursuing 9 \nthe book providing the outbreak case studies.
