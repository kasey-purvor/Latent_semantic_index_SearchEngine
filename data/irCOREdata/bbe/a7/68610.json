INTRODUCTION\nIN AN EARLIER companion paper [1], the stochasticresonance (SR) phenomenon was introduced and reviewed\nbriefly. It was pointed out that linear response theory (LRT)\nshows that SR need not be restricted to the systems with static\nbistable potentials in which it was originally discovered. It is\nto be anticipated in any system whose susceptibility increases\nrapidly with noise intensity. In the case of thermal equilibrium\nsystems (e.g., those subject to white noise, in the absence of\nexternal forces), this means that the possibility of SR can be\nassessed by examination of the spectral density of fluctuations\n(SDF) in the absence of the weak periodic force. Where the\nSDF contains peaks that rise rapidly with noise intensity, the\nfluctuation dissipation relations show immediately that SR is\nto be anticipated.\nIn the next section, we consider several examples of non-\nconventional SR, both in the small signal limit where LRT\nis applicable and also for stronger signals where different\ntheoretical approaches are required. In Section III, we describe\nsome phenomena, closely related to SR, that have also been\ninvestigated through analog electronic experiments, and in\nSection IV, we draw conclusions.\nManuscript received April 13, 1999; revised June 7, 1999.

SR for Coexisting Periodic Attractors\nThe system considered by Dykman et al. [2], [3] was the\nunderdamped single-well Duffing oscillator\n(1)\nwhere the oscillator is driven by a periodic force of amplitude\nfrequency and is the zero-mean white Gaussian\nnoise of intensity such that\n(2)\nThe oscillator is driven by a nearly resonant force\nwith the frequency close to the oscillator eigenfrequency\nsuch that\n(3)\nIt is of particular interest in view of its importance in nonlinear\noptics [4]\u2013[7] and its relevance to experiments on a confined\nrelativistic electron excited by cyclotron resonant radiation\n[8], [9]. Provided that and that the\nnoise is weak, the resultant comparatively small amplitude\noscillations of can conveniently be\ndiscussed in terms of the dimensionless parameters [10]\n(4)\nwhich characterize, respectively, the frequency detuning, the\nstrength of the main periodic field, and the noise intensity.\nThe bistability [11] in which we are interested corresponds\nto a coexistence of stable states with large or small amplitude\nlimit cycles, and it arises for a restricted range of and . The\neffect of weak noise is to cause small vibrations about\nthe attractors, and to induce occasional transitions between\nthem within the bistable regime. Since the system is far away\nfrom thermal equilibrium, the transition probabilities are not\ngiven by the classical Kramers [12] theory. The inter-attractor\ntransitions give rise to a stationary distribution of the oscillator\nover the attractors. They also give rise to an SR effect which,\nas we shall see, occurs in the close vicinity of the kinetic phase\ntransition (KPT) [10], [13], where the stationary populations of\nthe two attractors are equal, . The phenomenon can be\ndiscussed in terms of the LRT in [1, eqs. (16), (18)]; but, since\nthe system now under consideration is of the nonequilibrium\ntype, the susceptibility cannot now be obtained through the\nfluctuation dissipation relations of [1, eqs. (19), (20)].\n1057\u20137130\/99$10.00 \uf8e9 1999 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on February 28,2010 at 05:33:11 EST from IEEE Xplore.

For noise intensities\nnear those of the maxima in R(\u000b); the asymptotic theory is only qualitative and so the curves are shown dotted.\nConsider the response of the system (1) to an additional\nweak trial force . Under stationary conditions, the\nresponse to this field in the presence of the strong driving force\ncan still be described, in terms of linear response theory, by a\nsusceptibility. The trial force beats with the main periodic force\nand thus gives rise to vibrations of the system, not only at ,\nbut also at the combination frequencies (and also at\nfor a general nonlinearity). We are interested\nin the case where the strong and trial forces are both nearly\nresonant; that is, and both lie close to the oscillator\neigenfrequency . This is the case for which the response\nto the trial force is strongest. It is at its most pronounced at\nfrequency and at the nearest resonant combination, which\nfor (1) is . The amplitudes of vibrations at these\nfrequencies can be described respectively by susceptibilities\nso that trial-force-induced modification of the\ncoordinate averaged over noise, can be sought in the form\n(5)\nWithin the KPT range, displays a high narrow peak,\nwhose width is given by the transition rates and is therefore\nstrongly noise-dependent [10]. The rapid rise in susceptibility\nwith noise intensity corresponds precisely to SR because,\naccording to (5), the areas of the peaks in the power spectrum\nat frequencies and are\n(6)\nAn intuitive understanding of the mechanism of stochastic\namplification [14] can be gained by noting that the trial\nforce modulates the driving force (and the coordinate ) at\nfrequency and that, when is small compared\nto the dynamical relaxation rate the dynamical response\nof the system is almost adiabatic. The beat envelope then\nresults [2] in a slow oscillation in the amplitude of the force.\nThis has the effect of strongly modulating the populations of\nthe attractors (in the quasi-static limit). Such a modulation\nonly occurs close to the KPT; away from the KPT line, the\npopulations are always very different. If the noise intensity\nis optimally chosen, then the modulated system will have a\ntendency to make inter-attractor transitions coherently, once\nper half-cycle of the beat frequency. The net effect of the\nnoise is, therefore, to increase the modulation depth of the beat\nenvelope of the response, thereby increasing the components\nof the signal at frequencies and .\nThe response of the system (1), (2), (4), and the variation\nof the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with were investigated\n[2], [3] through analog experiments on the electronic model\ndescribed in Section II-A of [1]. In terms of scaled units,\nthe circuit parameters were set, typically, to\nand,\nto seek SR near the KPT, and the amplitude\nof the trial force . The SNR\u2019s determined in\nthe usual way from measurements of the delta spikes and the\nsmooth background, are plotted (data points) as functions of\nnoise intensity in Fig. 1 for . It is\nimmediately evident that there is a range of within which\nincreases with . It is also apparent that, for both the main\nsignal and that at the \u201cmirror-reflected\u201d combination frequency\nthe form of in Fig. 1 is remarkably similar\nto that observed for conventional SR. A quantitative theory of\nthe phenomenon is readily constructed through an extension\n[3] of the formalism introduced by Dykman and Krivoglaz\n[10]. It leads to the two full curves shown in the figure which,\nwithin experimental error, agree with the circuit data.\nB.

Calculated variation of eigenfrequency !(E) with energy E for the\npotential (7) with B = 0:3; xdc = 0 [23]. The first three extrema are at\n!m1 = 0:372; !m2 = 0:600; and !m3 = 0:506.\n(measured from the bottom of the potential well). The\noscillator has a (Boltzmann) distribution over energy, and\ntherefore over frequency. With increasing noise intensity this\ndistribution changes and the response at certain frequencies\ncan become strongly enhanced by noise. The appearance of\nan additional zero-dispersion spectral peak (ZDP), where the\ndamping is extremely small and is nonmonotonic as a\nfunction of energy, was predicted and discussed by Soskin\n[15], [16]. The exponential rise in the ZDP with increasing\nnoise intensity can be expected, on the basis of (18)\u2013(20) of\n[1], to give rise to SR at nearby frequencies.\nThe model used for the original prediction and first obser-\nvation of SR in monostable systems [17], [18] was the tilted\nsingle-well Duffing oscillator driven by Gaussian white noise\nplus a weak periodic force. However, much stronger SR effects\nare to be anticipated in underdamped SQUID\u2019s, which we now\nconsider, even for relatively large values of . The dynamics\nof the magnetic flux through a periodically-driven SQUID\nloop can be described in terms of a resistively shunted model\n[19] whose governing equation, after appropriate changes of\nvariable (e.g., see [20]) can be written\n(7)\ncorresponding to classical motion in the potential under\ninfluence of the additive noise . We consider the case\nwhere the amplitude of the periodic force is small, where\nthe constant is also small so that motion in the potential\nis underdamped, and where the relative magnitudes of the\nconstants and are such that the potential has a single\npotential well.\nThe corresponding dependence calculated for the\nSQUID potential (7) with and shown in\nFig. 2, exhibits a local maximum and two local minima within\nthe range plotted. Each of these extrema may be expected to\nproduce a ZDP in that could in principle give rise to\nSR. This inference [20] was tested with an analog electronic\nmodel of (7), as shown in block form in Fig. 3. and\nare respectively a signal and an external noise applied\nFig. 3.

SR for Periodically Modulated Noise Intensity\nSR phenomena can also arise [25] in a bistable system when\nthe noise and the periodic force are introduced multiplicatively,\nso that the former is modulated by the latter.

Such an effect would not,\nof course, occur in a linear system where the signal is directly\nproportional to the driving noise so that they must both, on\naverage, vanish. In a nonlinear system, however, a periodic\nsignal does arise; furthermore, where the system is bistable\na form of SR can occur for periodically modulated noise\nintensity. It has some novel features that are strikingly different\nfrom those in conventional SR. Dykman et al. [25] addressed\nthe problem through analytic approximation and an electronic\nmodel of an overdamped Brownian particle in moving in an\nasymmetric bistable potential\n(15)\nHere, characterizes the asymmetry of the potential. For\nthe potential has two min-\nima, i.e., the system is bistable. The function represents\nwhite Gaussian noise of intensity so that\n(16)\ni.e., the intensity of the driving force is periodic in time.\nThe modulation was assumed to be weak, so that the\nterm in in (16) could be neglected.\nBoth the approximate theory and measurements of sig-\nnal\/noise ratio in the electronic model immediately demon-\nstrated [25] the occurrence of SR: the rate of increase of\nwas faster than , so that it did not represent merely the\nproportionality of the modulation to in (16). The most\nstriking feature was that the SR effect occured only when the\nbistable potential was made asymmetric, with wells of different\ndepths, whereas conventional SR can be regarded (see above)\nas a kinetic phase transition (KPT) phenomenon that is at its\nmost pronounced for equally populated stable states i.e., for\nequal well depths.\nD. SR in Threshold Devices\nIt is interesting to notice that the first experimental evidence\nof SR was obtained in an electronic bistable system working\nas a threshold detector (a Schmitt trigger) [26]. The electronic\ndevice used was fairly simple, consisting of an operational\namplifier with feedback, subject to random noise and a periodic\nforcing. Although the work of [26] was prompted by [27], so\nthat the authors had in mind a continuous system, they realized\nthat their system had hysteresis and was actually behaving\nmore like a threshold system.\nAfter a period during which work on SR was focused mainly\non continuous systems, SR in threshold systems again became\nof interest when it was realized that the latter were perhaps\nmore appropriate for the description of neuronal dynamics. At\nthe same time, in an attempt to work on minimal systems able\nto display SR, attention turned to the so-called level crossing\ndetector (LCD), which is basically a threshold device. The new\nwave of electronic simulations and theoretical explanations\nfor this class of system were reviewed in [28], [29]. A fairly\ngeneral theoretical approach able to account for their behavior\nin terms of simple quantities was developed in [30]. It was\nsoon realized, however, that the dynamics of this class of\nsystems is closely connected to the dithering effect, already\nwell known in digital signal processing, as explained in [31].\nMore recently, SR in threshold devices has been redis-\ncovered in an electronic simulation [32]; the authors study\na two-state threshold comparator fed by white noise and a\nperiodic signal; they show that the cross-correlation between\noutput and input can be enhanced in the appropriate range of\ninput noise intensity.\nE. Aperiodic SR and Information Transmission\nTraditionally, SR has been quantified in terms of a noise-\ninduced maximum in the SNR [1]. For systems subject to\na periodic signal, this is a simple and convenient quantity\nto measure experimentally. The output signal power and\nbackground noise intensity can easily be determined from a\nmeasurement of the power spectrum of the response. However,\nspectral methods cannot be easily applied if the input signal\nis broadband. Recently, SR has been extended to encompass\nbroadband signals [33], so-called aperiodic SR. Although the\nterm was first coined in a study of a parallel array, it was\nalready known that broadband signals could exhibit SR type\neffects [34], [35]. In fact, aperiodic SR can occur in any system\nthat displays conventional SR.\nDue to the broadband nature of the signals, information-\ntheoretic measures have started to be employed. The most\ncommonly used measure is the average mutual information\n[35]\u2013[40], although other quantities have also been considered\n[41].\nUsing this type of approach, the SR system is treated as a\nnoisy communication channel with an input signal and\nan output . The average mutual information (transmitted\ninformation) is then computed for these quantities.\nFor threshold-type systems, such as a simple comparator or\nSchmitt trigger, there often exists a countable number of output\nstates. In this case the system can be treated as a semi-infinite\nchannel. The average mutual information is then given by\n(17)\nis the information content (or entropy) of and\ncan be interpreted as the amount of encoded information\nlost in the transmission of the signal. Enumerating the possible\noutput states by where ( being the\nnumber of output levels), is then the probability of the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

It is assumed that two possible\noutput states exist, labeled 0 and 1. In the absence of any noise,\nstate 1 is accessed if the signal exceeds the threshold level\notherwise, the system remains in state 0. If noise is now\nadded to the signal, the system will only change state when\nboth the signal plus the noise exceeds .\nFig. 6 shows results from a digital simulation of this model.\nThe signal was uniformly distributed between the limits 0.5\nand the noise was Gaussianly distributed with standard de-\nviation . It can be seen that SR effects (a maximum in\nthe transmitted information) are observed when the signal is\nentirely subthreshold i.e., when .\nThe appearance of SR can be understood as follows. If all\ninformation is lost in transmission, (which\noccurs as ), and hence . Alternatively, if all\nencoded information is transmitted,\nand . Given that it is straightforward to show that\nfor any non-zero it would seem to\nfollow that maximum information transfer occurs when there\nis no internal noise. However, as we have seen, this is not\nnecessarily the case. This is because internal noise also serves\nto increase . In effect, when the signal is subthreshold,\nthe noise facilitates access to additional bits of information.\nConsequently, the maximization of by internal noise is a\nbalance between additional information generated by the noise\nand the increased loss in information transmitted through the\nsystem with increasing .\nIt should be noted that this is not the only way of defining\n. In neurophysiological experiments, it is common practice\nto measure the time between successive firings of a neuron.\nThe same idea can be applied to simple threshold systems\nby measuring the time between generated events; this gives\nrise to a set of times . This enables the average mutual\ninformation to be constructed. A number of authors\nhave used this approach to make connection with neurophys-\niological applications [35]\u2013[37]. Similar SR type effects are\nobserved using this approach.\nF. SR in Networks\nTo date, the majority of studies on SR have tended to\nfocus on the dynamics of single elemental systems. However,\nrecently there has been a growth of interest in connecting\ntogether a number of such elemental systems to form arrays or\nnetworks. A wide range of network design, using different el-\nements and connectivity, has been investigated; these include,\nglobally coupled networks [42]\u2013[45], randomly connected\nnetworks [46], linear chains [47]\u2013[53] and parallel arrays [33],\n[54]\u2013[58]. Possible applications include pattern segmentation\n[59], perceptual interpretation of ambiguous figures [60], the\nmodeling of biological sensory system [33], [55], modeling of\nneuropsychiatric disorders [61], and nanoscale subthreshold\nmagnetic field detection [62].\nStudies of networks have demonstrated that SR is not solely\na temporal effect, it can also manifest itself in the spatiotempo-\nral domain. Indeed, the global response of a network can lead\nto an enhanced SR effect, as exemplified in array-enhanced\nSR (AESR) [47]. The existence of AESR, which occurs in\na linear chain of coupled bistable oscillators, has recently\nbeen confirmed experimentally in a diode resonator connected\ndiffusively into an array of nonidentical resonators [48], [50],\n[51]. In these systems, in addition to the usual temporal\nsynchronization, a spatial synchronization of the chain to the\nsignal also occurs. The maximum in the SNR is observed to\ncoincide with the optimal spatiotemporal synchronization of\nthe chain [48]. Similar enhancements of the SR effect have also\nbeen found in globally coupled networks [42], [43]. Again,\nSR enhancements over and above that displayed by a single\nelement were observed.\nThe motivation behind studying parallel arrays of elements\ncomes primarily from neurophysiological applications. Sen-\nsory neurons tend to be arranged in a highly parallel structure.\nThey also possess significant amounts of internal noise and\nare highly nonlinear. Consequently, they have all the features\nnecessary for exhibiting SR. Indeed, SR type effects have been\nobserved in a number of real neurophysiological experiments\n[63], [64].\nParallel arrays differ from other types of network in that the\nelements are not actually coupled. Generally, each element is\nsubject to the same signal but evolves under the influence of\nits own internal noise. The elements are only connected at\na common summing point. The action of the summing point\nleads to an ensemble averaging over the noise. Consequently,\nthe SNR at the output can be simply improved by increasing\nthe number of elements. In addition to displaying SR, the\ndynamics of each element linearises with increasing noise\nintensity (see Section III-B). Therefore, such arrays are capable\nof transmitting a high-fidelity reproduction of the signal,\ndespite the nonlinearity of individual elements. It is the ability\nof these arrays, to display SR effects and a high-fidelity\nlinear response, that makes them so intriguing as signal\nprocessing systems.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

A summing network ofN threshold devices. Each device is subject to\nthe same signal (a Gaussianly distributed signal with zero mean and standard\ndeviation \u001bx) but independent Gaussian noise.\nG. Suprathreshold SR\nSR is commonly understood to be the enhancement, by\nnoise, of the response of a system to a weak signal [1]. By\nweak, one normally means with reference to an appropriate\nscale of the system. In a threshold-type system, the scale\nwould be taken as the threshold level. Normally, SR is only\nobserved if the signal is smaller than this scale i.e., it is\nsubthreshold. For signals of sufficient magnitude, the SR effect\ndisappears. However, it has recently been observed [65] that,\nin parallel networks of threshold devices, SR-type effects can\noccur for any magnitude of signal\u2014including suprathreshold\nsignals. For this reason, this form of SR has been termed\nsuprathreshold SR (supra-SR).\nConsider the summing network of threshold devices\nshown in Fig. 7. Each threshold device is subject to the same\ninput signal but to an independent Gaussian noise\nwith a standard deviation . The devices are modeled as\nHeaviside functions, the outputs being given by the\nresponse function\nif\notherwise (18)\nwhere are the threshold levels and . The\nresponse of the network is obtained by summing the individual\nresponses of each device. Consequently, is the number of\ndevices that are triggered at any instant of time.\nAlthough other studies have considered similar networks\n[33], this model differs in that each threshold can be chosen\nindependently. This enables the thresholds to be adjusted\nto optimize the information transmission for a given signal\ndistribution. Uniformly placing the thresholds across the signal\nspace mimics the signal encoding abilities of a flash analog-\nto-digital converter (ADC)\u2014this is the optimal threshold dis-\ntribution for a uniformly distributed signal. For other signal\ndistributions, the optimal threshold distribution can be found\nusing the method of optimal quantization [65]\u2013[67]. If such\na procedure is undertaken, one finds that the transmitted\ninformation is generally maximized at zero levels of noise.\nFig. 8. Plot of transmitted information against \u001b = \u001b\u0011=\u001bx for various N\nand all \u0012i = 0. The data points are the results of a digital simulations of the\nnetwork and the solid lines were obtained by numerically evaluating (19).\nHowever, this is not the case if every threshold is adjusted to\ncoincide with the dc component of the signal. Fig. 8 illustrates\nwhat happens for a broadband Gaussianly distributed input sig-\nnal with standard deviation and zero mean. Each threshold\nlevel has been set to zero to coincide with the mean of\nthe signal. It can be seen that an SR-type effect is observed,\nproviding even though the signal is suprathreshold.\nIndeed, it was found that the effect remained for any magnitude\nof signal. Consequently, in contrast to single element threshold\nsystems, noise can optimize the performance of parallel arrays\nto suprathreshold as well as to subthreshold signals.\nThe mechanism giving rise to supra-SR is quite different to\nthat of conventional SR. In the absence of noise, all devices\nswitch in unison and consequently the network acts like a\nsingle-bit ADC . Finite noise results in a distribution\nof thresholds that gives access to more bits of information;\neffectively the noise is accessing more degrees of freedom\nof the system, and hence, generating information.

Good agreement between simulation and theory\nis obtained confirming the suprathreshold SR effect.\nSuch networks could have direct engineering applications.\nThis is particularly true in the design of ADC\u2019s when the\nsignal is highly nonstationary and weak with respect to the\ninternal noise of the system. The nonstationarity of the signal\nprecludes the possibility of fixing the threshold levels in an\noptimal configuration. In this situation, some advantage can\nbe gained by simply adjusting the levels to coincide with the\nmean of the signal and exploiting the supra-SR effect [69].\nIII. RELATED PHENOMENA\nA. Noise-Enhanced Heterodyning (NEH)\nIn the well-known phenomenon of heterodyning, two high-\nfrequency fields\u2014an \u201cinput signal\u201d and a \u201creference sig-\nnal\u201d\u2014are mixed nonlinearly to generate a heterodyne signal\nat the difference frequency. The addition of noise usually\nresults in a decrease in the amplitude of the heterodyne\nsignal (and its SNR), because the frequency response of\nthe system becomes correspondingly broadened. Nonetheless,\nit has been shown [70] that, in bistable systems of the\nkind that exhibit SR, the heterodyne signal (and SNR) can\nsometimes be enhanced by an increase in the noise intensity.\nConsider an overdamped bistable system driven by three time-\ndependent forces representing respectively the reference and\ninput signals, and noise\n(20)\nHere, the terms and are respectively the high-\nfrequency reference signal corresponding to a local oscillator\nof frequency (applied multiplicatively), and the modulated\nhigh-frequency input signal (applied additively). The functions\nand vary slowly compared to and it is their\nvariation in time that has to be revealed via heterodyning. The\nheterodyning can be characterized by the low-frequency signal\nat the output, (the overbar stands for averaging\nover the period ), for and\nwith i.e., for a monochromatic input signal whose\nfrequency is slightly different from the frequency .\nDykman et al. [70] considered the case where the double-\nwell potential has equally deep wells, as in standard SR,\nand for convenience chose it to be the quartic potential\n(21)\nFor the case where vary slowly over the time\n, the equations describing the dynamics of the system turn\nout to be identical to those of conventional SR. The system\ncan thus be well-described in terms of LRT provided only that\nis small enough. It was thus demonstrated theoretically and\nby use of a circuit model that, in close analogy to conventional\nSR, NEH in a bistable system can produce a very substantial\nenhancement of the heterodyne signal over that obtained by\nheterodyning in e.g. a single-well nonlinear system.\nBuilding on the understanding gained from studies of the\nanalog electronic model, both SR and NEH were subsequently\nobserved in a nonlinear optical system [71], [72].\nB. Noise-Induced Linearization\nThe phenomenon of noise-induced linearization was iden-\ntified in the course of experiments on SR, using analog\nelectronic models [73]. The unexpected observation was that\nthe signal distortion introduced by passage through a nonlinear\nsystem could be reduced by the addition at the input of\nexternal white (or weakly colored) noise of sufficient intensity.\nThe scenario was found to hold experimentally for many\ndifferent nonlinear systems, including monostable as well as\nbistable, underdamped as well as overdamped, chaotic as well\nas regular, and for signals of various shapes. Because the\nresultant linearized output is inevitably noisy, we consider\nhow the ensemble average of the output varies with\nrelevant parameters, for example with the noise intensity at\nthe input.\nThe basic idea of linearization by added noise is, of course,\nalready familiar from specific observations and applications in\nscience and engineering, e.g. the removal of digitization steps\nin the output of an ADC, or the linearization of periodic signals\nin neurophysiological experiments [74], or the linearization of\nthe response of ring-laser gyroscopes at low angular velocities\n[75]. The results under discussion suggested, however, that\nnoise-induced linearization may exist as a more general phe-\nnomenon than had been appreciated, thus further illustrating\nthe idea [76] that the role of noise in a dynamical system may\noften be, in a sense, creative.\nThe linearization occurred in two different senses. First, a\nsinusoidal input was able to pass through the system without\nsignificant change of shape, demonstrating a proportionality\nbetween the amplitudes of output and input; this need not\nnecessarily imply that the constant of proportionality must\nbe frequency-independent, however. Secondly, the undistorted\npassage of a sawtooth waveform, containing not only the\nfundamental frequency but also its higher harmonics, implies\nthe occurrence of linearization in the \u201cHi-Fi\u201d sense that the\nsystem becomes nondispersive within a certain frequency\nrange when the noise intensity is large enough.\nThe physical origin of both forms of signal restoration can\nreadily be understood, at least qualitatively, in the following\nterms. Where the amplitude response of a system to a periodic\nforce is nonlinear, this arises because the amplitude of the\nvibrations induced by the force is comparable with, or larger\nthan, some characteristic nonlinear length scale of the system,\ndetermined by the structure of the region of phase space\nbeing visited. The effect of noise is to smear the system\nover a larger region of phase space, so that a variety of\ndifferent scales and frequencies then become involved in the\nmotion, even in the absence of periodic driving, and the\neffective characteristic scale will usually increase as a result.\nFor sufficiently large noise intensities, therefore, the amplitude\nof the force-induced vibrations will become small compared\nto the scale (e.g., small compared to the average size of the\nnoise-induced fluctuations), so that the nonlinearity of the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Because the system is\nthen spending an increasing proportion of its time far away\nfrom its attractor(s), at coordinate values where the timescale\nthat characterizes the motion will in general be quite different\nand sometimes shorter than for small noise intensities, there\nwill be one or more ranges of frequency for which dispersion\nis likely to decrease [77]. Although the linearization and the\nsuppression of the dispersion arise, ultimately through the\nsame physical processes, there is no reason to expect that they\nwill become important at the same noise intensity. Dykman\net al. [73] and Stocks et al. [77] have given detailed analyzes\nof noise-induced linearization phenomena in the standard SR\nsystem, with overdamped Brownian motion in the bistable\nquartic potential (21).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe above examples are intended to convey some idea of\nthe versatility, convenience, and power of analog electronic\nmodeling as a complement to analytic and numerical methods\nfor the investigation of SR and related phenomena. It is equally\nuseful for other phenomena involving noise and nonlinearity\nwhere theoretical treatments are necessarily approximate and\ndirect experimental tests are therefore essential. Despite its\nsimplicity, the technique can be applied usefully to problems\nat the forefront of statistical mechanics as well as to a wide\nrange of applied research.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge, with pleasure, their very consid-\nerable indebtedness to M.
