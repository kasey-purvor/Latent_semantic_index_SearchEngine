INTRODUCTION \n \nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique employing low-coherence interferometry to image \nthe morphology of biological tissue or non-biological semi-transparent composite materials. Appropriate illumination \nwavelengths, in the visible and near infra red regions of the spectrum, are strongly scattered by tissue, limiting the \nmaximum imaging depth to about 3 mm1. However, the spatial resolution, in the range of about 1 to 30 \u00b5m, is superior to \nthat achieved by other tomographic methods such as ultrasound, enabling cell-level detail to be observed in the highest \nresolution systems2. Additionally, the use of near infra-red radiation, which is considered clinically safe at moderate \npowers, is preferable to the ionising radiation required by techniques such as X-ray and PET. OCT is therefore of interest \nboth for in-vitro applications and for in-vivo measurements of epithelial and endothelial tissues3, 4. In applications such as \ndetection of heat damage or pre-cancerous conditions, OCT has the potential to replace, or at least to reduce the necessity \nfor, invasive screening by excision of tissue samples5. \nLaboratory testing can be conveniently performed using bulk-optic OCT instrumentation, but the acquisition of in-vivo \nimages, typically from within the gastro-intestinal tract, requires the use of a flexible, endoscopic probe. This is realised \nby incorporating optical fibre components. In early systems, the typical configuration comprised a Michelson \ninterferometer formed from a directional coupler6. However, more recent implementations generally employ balanced \ndetection to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and sometimes replace the coupler by an optical circulator, \nresulting in greater optical efficiency and a further increase in SNR7. \nThe majority of bulk and fibre-based OCT systems currently under investigation are based around a Michelson \ninterferometer configuration. This allows an instrument to be constructed using relatively few components and provides \ngood signal-to-noise performance. However, optical fibre versions of the Michelson configuration are susceptible to \nsignal fading caused by bending-induced differences between the states of polarisation (SOP) of light in the reference \nand signal arms8. This is evidently more likely to be a problem during in-vivo measurements. Phase drifting of the \nfringes, caused by temperature fluctuations, is also likely under these conditions. Previous work in our laboratory has \ndemonstrated that, for fibre-based OCT systems, the Michelson interferometer configuration may not always be the \noptimum choice. A Fizeau interferometer configuration, incorporating an optical circulator and balanced detection, can  \noffer a SNR approaching that of the Michelson version, with the additional advantage of downlead insensitivity9,10. \nDiscussion of our current Fizeau OCT system has been previously reported11. \nThe usual procedure in OCT is to scan the position of the focused probe beam rapidly across the sample surface to build \nup a 3D map of tissue structure12. In this paper, we discuss the adaptation of the Fizeau configuration for use with a \nCoherence Domain Optical Methods and Optical Coherence Tomography in Biomedicine X \nedited by Valery V.

The fibres within a coherent bundle are arranged in a regular array throughout the entire length of \nup to several metres15. An image projected onto one polished end of the bundle is thus transmitted undistorted, apart \nfrom pixelation effects, to the opposite end. In the proposed bundle-based OCT system, a separate Fizeau interferometer \nis formed between the distal end of each fibre in the bundle and the sample, enabling OCT information to be transmitted \nsimultaneously from many positions across the area of the sample illuminated by light from the bundle. Detection of the \noptical signal over the area addressed by the bundle is performed by a digital camera array, allowing a 3D image to be \nconstructed from a single depth scan. \n2. PRINCIPLES OF COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY \n \nThe structure that appears in an OCT tissue image results from refractive index discontinuities at boundaries betweeen \ndifferent types of tissue. At such a boundary, an optical reflection is generated, much larger in magnitude than the level \nof backscatter from within the continuum of the tissue. The task of the OCT system is to detect and locate the positions \nof these boundary reflections with the maximum possible spatial resolution. \nSometimes the source used is a swept laser but, more often, illumination is provided by a broadband non-laser device. \nThe wavelength of choice is around 1300-1550 nm, where absorption of light by the tissue is at its lowest16. The output \nspectrum should be as broad as possible, since depth resolution is determined by the coherence length, which is inversely \nrelated to source spectral width. For a typical superluminescent source, the spectral width is about 20-100 nm, resulting \nin a coherence length (and depth resolution) of 10-20 \u00b5m. A typical single-spot OCT system consists of a Michelson \ninterferometer in which the reference and sample arms are of closely similar length, as shown in figure 1. \n \n \nDetector\nDirectional\ncoupler\n\u03b1\/(1-\u03b1)BBS Sample\nOptical\nDelay line\n \n \nFigure 1. Michelson-configuration OCT system, based on an optical fibre direction coupler. BBS = broad band source, and \u03b1 is the \nsplitting ratio of the coupler. \n \n \nThe reference arm includes some form of scanned optical delay line, enabling the reference beam path to be swept \nlinearly over a range of several millimetres. For a tissue boundary at a particular depth within the sample, interference \nfringes will be seen only when the reference beam path is set to match that of the signal beam, to within the 10-20 \u00b5m \ncoherence length of the source. When this condition is satisfied, interference fringes are detected, modulated by the \nsource spectral envelope. Thus the positions of the various tissue boundaries can be located and mapped with high \nresolution as the reference path is scanned. \nSpatial resolution in the plane normal to the optical axis is determined by the spot size of the focused beam within the \nsample, and is typically similar to the depth resolution. It is determined  by the quality of the probe head focusing optics. \nThe refractive indices of the diverse biological materials within a particular sample of plant or animal tissue are typically \nrather similar, often differing in only the second or third  decimal place. This implies low reflectivity values, and the \nrequirement for appropriate, high SNR detection techniques to allow identification of the interference signals. Balanced \ndetection is widely used to achieve sufficient SNR performance. Imaging depth can be maximised by the use of optical \nclearing agents, but is ultimately limited to about 3 mm by decreasing signal strength as light is scattered and absorbed \nwithin the sample. \n \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6079  60791H-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Feb 2011 to 138.250.82.99.

FIZEAU-CONFIGURATION OCT USING A COHERENT OPTICAL FIBRE BUNDLE \n \nFor single-spot OCT instruments, 3D information is obtained by rapid scanning of the probe beam, both through the \nsample depth and in a pattern across the sample surface12. This is a reliable technique, and typically allows a 3D image \nof a volume up to a few cubic millimetres to be obtained in a few seconds. However, when using this type of system \nendoscopically, for internal in-vivo measurements, active scanning is required at the endoscope tip. Although this has \nbeen successfully demonstrated using miniaturised components17, it is not straightforward to implement, especially for 3-\nD measurement, and a passive probe would be advantageous for endoscopic use. \nA coherent fibre bundle, by allowing simultaneous OCT information to be obtained from an array of positions across the \nsample, eliminates the requirement for x-y scanning13, 14. The bundle diameter of a few mm is ideal for endoscopic use \nand a fibre spacing as little as 6-10 \u00b5m can be obtained. The potential spatial resolution is therefore similar to that \nobtained from an x-y scanned system. \nA configuration appropriate for a bundle-based OCT system is shown in figure 2. It is similar to the arrangement \nemployed in our laboratory for a single-point system based around a Fizeau-type probe interferometer. This is formed \nbetween the end face of the bundle and the sample itself.,Path length matching cannot be achieved directly with the \nFizeau arrangement, so a scanned processing interferometer is employed, having an average path-length mismatch \nidentical to that of the Fizeau. In the work presented here, the processing interferometer is of the Michelson type, but \nother configurations are possible. \nThe Fizeau arrangement is particularly appropriate for the bundle-based system, because the bundle itself does not form \npart of either the sample or the processing interferometer. This is important, for several reasons, the most obvious of \nwhich is that the instrument now has \u2018downlead insensitivity\u2019. Environmentally-induced phase and polarisation changes \nwithin the bundle do not affect the visibility of the interference signal. \n \n \n4. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS \n \nThe experiments described in this paper were performed using the configuration shown in figure 2. The source was a 5 \nmW, 830 nm superluminescent diode (SLD), with a bandwidth of about 15 nm, corresponding to a coherence length of \nabout 30 \u00b5m. Although this is not the optimum wavelength region for tissue measurements, it was chosen for these \nproof-of-principle experiments to fall within the appropriate range for good sensitivity of the CCD camera used as the \ndetector. \nFibre imaging bundle\nSample\nSLD\nA\nB C\nCamera\nScanning\nMirror\nMirror\nz\nx\n \nFigure 2.

An \noptional focusing lens (A), positioned after the interferometer, enabled the beam diameter to be adjusted to illuminate \nany required area of the bundle face. Because the interferometer has unequal path lengths in the two arms, positioning \nthe lens before the interferometer would cause a wavefront curvature mismatch, resulting in bulls-eye fringes in the \nrecombining beams.  \n \n4.1 Imaging bundle \nThe imaging conduit (supplied by Schott Fiber Optics Inc.) was a wound bundle, 2 m in length and was made up of \n300x300 fibres on a 10 \u00b5m centre spacing. Light was transmitted by the bundle to a probe head comprising a pair of \nachromats positioned in a unit magnification, 4f imaging arrangement. Achromat lenses were used to reduce aberrations, \nsince image quality is of critical importance in the bundle-based system. \nIn a conventional, single point OCT system, the beam waist diameter determines the spatial resolution of the instrument \nin the x-y plane normal to the beam direction. Poor focusing degrades the spatial resolution. In the bundle-based system, \nthis is also the case. However, there is now an additional consequence of poor focusing. If the beam waist diameter \nbecomes larger than the fibre spacing, cross-talk arises between the fibres in light scattered by the sample. Non-\nreciprocal imaging can take place, in which light transmitted to the sample by one fibre can be backscattered and \ncollected by a different fibre. Since the path length in the Fizeau varies depending on which pair of neighbouring fibres \nare involved, spurious sets of interference fringes can arise at the detector. Figure 3(a) shows the intensity variation for \nfour individual fibres from the bundle as the processing interferometer is scanned, when ordinary plano-convex lenses \nare used in the probe head. Multiple fringe bursts can be seen arising from severe cross-talk. The consequences are \nblurring of interfaces in the OCT image and degradation of both depth (z) and x-y resolution. Achromats were found to \nperform significantly better in our probe head, over the small field of view required, than standard plano-convex lenses, \nalthough their ability to minimise aberrations is known to decrease for off-axis object points. With the aperture used, the \nRayleigh range was about 300 \u00b5m, limiting the scan depth for acceptable imaging to about twice this distance. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Intensity modulation of the signal from individual fibres in the imaging bundle as the processing interferometer is scanned, \nwhen using (a) standard plano-convex and (b) achromat lenses for focusing in the probe head. \n \nBy choosing an appropriate aperture diameter for our system, focusing quality with achromats was sufficient to limit any \ncross-talk to the immediate neighbours only of a particular fibre. Typically, no more than one additional pair of \ninterference envelopes was seen to either side of a true interference signal, and the magnitude of the satellite envelopes \nwas reduced to an almost negligible level.

In \nprinciple, \u2018ghost\u2019 images could be seen if light travels to and from the measurement region in different modes, but for \nfibre lengths in excess of about half a metre, these appear outside the scanning range. To avoid unwanted intensity \nfluctuations, it is advisable to set the detector pixel-binning to ensure that each compound pixel covers a region of at \nleast half of the area occupied by a single fibre in the camera image. No other difficuties arise as a result of the multi-\nmoded behaviour of the bundle. Similarly, because the bundle is external to the interferometers, any slight variation in \nthe physical length or optical path difference for different regions of the bundle is unimportant. \nThe fill-factor for the bundle used in this project, in which fibres were arranged on a square grid, was about 30-40%. \nThis is because data is collected only from the fibre core area, with the regions between fibres appearing dark. Use of a \nbundle therefore gives a somewhat pixelated appearance to the images. The spatial resolution, however, is high, and \ninterpolation or slight smoothing can be used to improve the visual appearance of the OCT images. \n \n4.2 Detection and processing \nThe detector was a 12-bit digital camera (supplied by LaVision) with a 640 by 480 pixel array and an integration time \nvariable between 1 and 10000 \u00b5s. The input face of the fibre bundle was imaged, via the beamsplitter onto the image \nplane of the camera, with a magnification of about 4 to 5. Thus, in the image, a single fibre occupied an area of 16-25 \npixels. \nOCT data are acquired from the camera by downloading successive frames into image buffers as the mirror in the \nprocessing interferometer is scanned over a distance of typically 0.2-2 mm \nData can be processed and displayed as 2D slices, showing x-z planes (depth slices) or x-y planes parallel to the sample \nsurface. Slices stored in either orientation can be stacked to produce a full 3D volume image, although this is more \ndifficult to interpret as a printed image. The sampling is set to produce data at 300-400 depth positions over a total depth \nscan range of about 600\u00b5m, allowing for each fringe envelope encountered to be sampled at least ten times with the \nsource used.   \nIn x-y mode, sample interfaces can be identified by applying a sequential subtraction algorithm to pairs of incoming \nimages, and monitoring the difference value obtained for each pixel. When this value reaches a maximum, corresponding \nto the peak of a fringe envelope, the scan position is recorded in the final output buffer18. At present, this software detects \nonly a single maximum value per pixel, but is under modification to allow the positions of multiple local maxima to be \nstored, allowing full 3D data display. \nA number of samples were investigated, composed of combinations of mirrored and glass surfaces in air. The results of \nthese measurements are detailed below. \n \n \n5. RESULTS \n \nThe ability of the system to detect surfaces of varying reflectivity was assessed by interposing a 200\u00b5m thick microscope \ncover slip across and in contact with a mirror placed in the sample position, so as to cover about half of the camera \nimage. Figure 4 shows (a) an en-face image, (b) a depth slice image, (c) a representation of the sample and (d) a 3D plot \ngenerated from the en-face image with slight smoothing applied using a 3x3 median filter. \nThe interface corresponding to the mirror surface can be clearly identified in both representations. The portion of this \ninterface that is in contact with the coverslip appears shifted in the images by about 100\u00b5m. This is because the cover \nslip increases the optical path length in the Fizeau by a distance t(ng-na), where t is the cover slip thickness and ng=1.5 \nand na=1 the refractive indices of the glass and of air respectively. The sample area addressed is about 1.4 mm x1mm, \nwith a scan depth of about 0.4 mm, and the depth slice corresponds to the central row in the en-face image, as shown. \nThe glass\/air interface at the front of the cover slip produces only a 4% reflection, and is therefore more difficult to \ndetect than the mirrored surfaces. However, although much fainter than the signals produced from the mirror reflections, \nit is visible in the depth slice as a second line near to the top of the image. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6079  60791H-5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Feb 2011 to 138.250.82.99.

A \ndiagram of this sample, and of a depth slice imaged obtained from it, are shown in figure 5. The en-face processing \ntechnique was not, in its current form, appropriate for investigation of this sample, as it would detect for each image \nposition only the interface giving rise to the strongest interference signal, and would ignore other interfaces. Therefore \nthe depth slice image only is shown here. \nFour glass\/air interfaces can be seen in the left half of figure 5, and two in the right half, as expected, at the appropriate \nrelative positions for the arrangement of cover slips. The two adjacent central interfaces on the left blend into one \nslightly broader line. Once again, it is the optical path length that is measured, and so positions of identical surfaces in \neither half of the image appear displaced. The noise was markedly reduced by the removal of the mirror in this \nmeasurement. However, the signal levels were also generally rather low from the 4% reflectivity surfaces. This leads to \nsomewhat sparse data, since the visibility of interference fringes produced by different fibres in the bundle is variable. At \nlow signal levels, some fibres do not modulate well enough to provide a distinguishable signal.

DISCUSSION \n \nThe bundle-based approach to 3D OCT image acquisition has been successfully demonstrated above for laboratory \nsamples of relatively high reflectivity. The elimination of x-y scanning allows a completely passsive endoscopic probe to \nbe configured. \nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the images shown above is adequate for the measurements made here, but requires \nimprovement to allow more complex samples to be studied. One straightforward way to achieve this would be by \nincreasing the power of the source, which currently provides a maximum of only around 7 mW of optical power. The \noptical arrangement shown is not optimised for efficiency. Half the light is currently lost in the processing interferometer \nand a further 50% each time light passes through the beam splitter at the input of the fibre bundle. The use of polarising \ncomponents and waveplates, or even a bulk-optic optical circulator, would greatly improve the optical efficiency. \nThere are two important questions to be addressed. The first is whether the technique has potential for measurements in \nbiological tissue, where reflectivity values are expected to be up to two orders of magnitude lower than those of the \ncurrent non-biological laboratory samples. The other issue is acquisition speed; can a bundle-based system run at speeds \ncomparable to current systems incorporating fast x-y galvo-scanners? \n \n6.1 SNR performance \nThe SNR is dependent upon the same parameters that are relevant in a single-point OCT system. Receiver noise, excess \nnoise and shot noise all contribute to the overall noise term7. Shot noise is not usually the dominant factor in OCT \nsystems. Excess noise is proportional to the detection bandwidth and the square of the average power at the detector. \nSince the current camera bandwidth is extremely low compared with the detector bandwidth for single-point systems, \nexcess noise is also expected to be lower in the equivalent optical arrangement. An important factor limiting the \nperformance of our current system is cross-talk between the fibres, which produces small spurious interferometric \nintensity oscillations for depth scan positions which are off the path-balanced condition for a particular sample interface. \nThese arise, as discussed above, when the focused beam-waist at the sample from each fibre becomes larger than the \ninter-fibre spacing. Improvements to the design of the focusing optics in the probe head would reduce this problem \nsignificantly. It would also be helped by employing a bundle made up of larger, or more widely spaced fibres, which \nwould relax the focusing requirements at the expense of a slight reduction in spatial resolution in the x-y plane. \nThe effect of camera digitisation must also be taken into account when considering system performance. The camera \ncurrently in use digitises to 12 bits, corresponding to 4000 available signal levels. A drawback of camera detection is that \nthe dc signal intensity cannot be filtered off before digitisation takes place. The camera therefore makes relatively poor \nuse of the available digitisation range. After the dc background has been subtracted, the interferometric signal containing \nthe structural information occupies only about 8 bits of the total range. This limits the SNR to a maximum of around 50 \n(a) (b)\n76\n0 \n\u00b5m\n \n1.4 mm \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6079  60791H-7\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Feb 2011 to 138.250.82.99.

It would therefore appear at first sight that the potential \nof system for biological measurements is very limited. However, there are ways in which the SNR performance can be \nsignificantly improved. \nOne possibility is simply to choose the best available camera, to maximise the full-well capacity and minimise the noise. \nAccumulating large numbers of images, although it slows down the acquisition process, leads to a big improvement in \nthe SNR. Averaging 100 images for each scan position will improve the SNR by about 20 dB.  \nFigure 6 shows a depth slice OCT image of the surface of a ceramic tile with an opaque glaze. The tile surface could not \nbe clearly identified in an image generated from individual camera acquisitions, but is plainly visible in the figure below, \nwhich is generated from averages of 60 acquisitions at each depth position sampled.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Depth slice OCT image of a ceramic tile with an opaque surface glaze, showing an area of approximately 1mm x 0.5 mm. \n \nSNR can also be increased by the use of more sophisticated detection techniques, involving phase-synchronised \nacquisition of different regions of the modulation period19 to isolate the coherent signal.  \nAlternatively, the 3D OCT technique can be adapted to exploit the high-bandwidth, wide dynamic range capabilities of \nstandard photodetectors, and to obtain the large increase in SNR offered by balanced detection, while also retaining the \nadvantages offered by the bundle. This could be achieved by re-introducing x-y galvo-scanners, but now positioning the \nscanners at the input to the bundle. Thus the input beam is scanned across the input face of the bundle, and the beam \nreturning from the sample region is redirected, again via the scanning mirror pair, onto point detectors. In this way,  OCT \ninformation from each fibre in turn is multiplexed onto the detector, but the endoscopic section remains passive. \n \n6.2 Acquisition speed \nThe processing time currently required in our system to generate an image in either the x-y or x-z plane is of the order of \nseveral minutes. However, this is limited primarily by a slow processing algorithm. The camera is capable of reading out \ndata at 30 frames per second; faster if pixel binning is employed to reduce the amount of data per frame. Thus a set of \nsay 100 images acquired at a sampling interval of 2 \u00b5m could be obtained within 3s or less and stored straight to RAM. \nSome further time would need to be allocated for post-processing, but 3D OCT information would be obtained in \nseconds rather than minutes. Current fast systems using galvanometer scanners produce an image in around 1-5s, so the \npotential acquisition speed of the camera system approaches  that of mechanically scanned instruments. \nIf the bundle-based configuration were modified to operate with galvo-scanners at the bundle input, the acquisition speed \nwould be expected to be similar to that of the conventional scanning versions with the scanning mirrors at the probe tip. \nAlthough the optical path-length scanning in the current system is achieved using a relatively slow mechanical scanning \ntechnique, the configuration is also compatible with use of a rapid-scanning Fourier delay line. \n \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \n \nAn imaging fibre bundle has been employed to construct a full-field OCT system with a passive endoscopic probe \nsection. It has been shown that 3D structural information can be obtained from a sample without any requirement for \nbeam-scanning in the x-y plane normal to the optical axis. The spatial resolution of the bundle-based system compares \nwell with that of active OCT designs using galvanometer mirrors. For the current system, the spatial resolution in the x-y \nplane and the depth resolution are both about 30\u00b5m. \nMeasurements have been successfully made on non-biological surfaces in air, over scan depths of up to about 0.75 mm. \nThe SNR of the system is adequate to detect glass\/air interfaces, but is currently insufficient to allow biologcal samples \nto be imaged. However, modifications to improve the SNR to the required value have been discussed, including an \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6079  60791H-8\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Feb 2011 to 138.250.82.99.

Further investigation, following implementation of these improvements, will \ndetermine the ultimate quality of the 3D images acquired when bundle-based OCT is used to examine biological tissue. \n \n \n8.
