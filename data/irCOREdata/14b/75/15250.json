Well conducted \nsystematic reviews remain a valuable part of the public health methodological tool box. \n \n \n \n249 words \n 3 \nBACKGROUND \nThe systematic review (SR), which has been advanced for many years now in the evidence based \nmedicine literature, is becoming an increasingly popular and established research method in public \nhealth as well as some of the social sciences. [1] For example, a quick search of the Web of Science \ndatabase obtains 707 hits for the subject \u201csystematic review\u201d in the social science literature for the \nperiod 1945 to 1999 as compared to over 4596 hits for 2000 to 2008. [2] This includes an increase \nfrom 85 hits to 764 hits for the sub-category public, environmental and occupational health. [2] In part, \nthis rapid expansion in the use of the method has been fuelled by the promotional efforts of the \nCochrane Collaboration (which now has a public health sub-group, as well as a health equity sub-\ngroup) and its social science equivalent, the Campbell Collaboration (which has a welfare sub-group). \n[3, 4] The other great driving force has been the increased emphasis in public health policy and \npractice for decisions and interventions to be more \u201cevidence based\u201d, the so called \u201cascendancy of \nevidence\u201d. [5 - 8] The SR is now widely considered within policy and practice circles to be a good way \nof making the sometimes conflicting and complicated results of many different types of study \naccessible and more useable. For example, a recent UK government commissioned review of \npromoting public health highlighted the value of SRs in providing robust and reliable evidence on the \neffectiveness of interventions. [9] Similarly, they are also a key factor in the formulation of binding \nrecommendations made for the UK National Health Service by the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence (NICE). [10] \n \nObtaining, often on the job, skills in SR methodology (both conducting them and interpreting them) \nare therefore becoming a common requirement for most public health researchers and practitioners. \nThis is reflected in the number of guide books available. [1, 11 - 13]  However, most researchers still \nremain apprehensive about conducting their first SR and the voluminous guidebooks and handbooks \n(most are hundreds of pages long) do little to quell such feelings. The fact that most of the \ncommentaries on conducting SRs still come from the health care or evidence based medicine \nliteratures also makes the method inaccessible to public health policy researchers. SRs of public \nhealth interventions draw on an evidence base dominated by observational and qualitative studies in \nwhich the measurement of relevant outcomes is often heterogeneous. This means that the advice on \nSR from the health care and medicine literature, concerned as it is with the quality of experimental \n 4 \n(particularly RCTs) studies and the meta-analysis of results,[13] is difficult for novices to transfer to \npublic health questions.[1] Looking to social science is not particularly helpful either as a lot of the SR \nliterature in this field still highlights the difficulties, as opposed to the advantages, of applying the \nmethod in social evaluation. From the outside looking in then, the SR approach can initially seem time \nconsuming, tedious, and overwhelming. Added to this, there are various debates in the SR literature \nabout what a SR is, how it should be conducted, and by whom.  \n \nThis brief guide is intended to help dispel these concerns by providing an accessible, more tailored \noverview for novices of the SR method and its place in public health policy research. The guide draws \nupon an extensive practical experience of conducting various types of SRs of complex social \ninterventions in the field of public health policy (Box 1) and in terms of training researchers.[14 - 22] \nFirstly it discusses what a SR is and describes the stages of a review in simple terms. It then reflects \non five key practical aspects of the conduct of the method, outlining debates and potential ways to \nmake the SR method shorter and smarter. It concludes by highlighting the ongoing value of the \nmethod. \n \nWhat is a systematic review?  \nThe first issue that any researcher is faced with is establishing what counts as a SR. In simple terms \nthe SR is a method of locating, appraising, and synthesising evidence. However, in practice there are \ndisagreements about what does and what does not constitute a SR. Conventional public health and \nsocial science definitions of the SR tended to concentrate on distinguishing it from traditional (non-\nsystematic) literature reviews. So for example, Oakley and Fullerton defined the SR as \u201ca review of a \nclearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically \nappraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the \nreview\u201d. [23] Similarly, a SR is systematic because it: attempts systematically to locate research, both \npublished and unpublished, and critically evaluate it on grounds of relevancy and predetermined \nmethodological criteria. Only research that is judged to be both relevant to the review question, and \nwhich fulfils the methodological inclusion criteria, is combined into the final review analysis. The SR \ncombines the results of these studies and thus provides a summary of the \u201ebest available evidence\u201f \non a given question. [11, 12] Following the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) \n 5 \nguidelines on the minimum requirements of a SR,[24] recent umbrella reviews (systematic reviews of \nreviews) have tended to define studies as SRs if they addressed a clearly defined question, and an \neffort had been made to identify all relevant literature by searching at least one named database \ncombined with either checking references, hand-searching, citation searching, or contacting authors \nin the field. [25 \u2013 27]. Although this is clearly only a minimal definition of a SR and not a definition of \ngood practice, it does illustrate that SRs do not therefore need to search everywhere and synthesise \nall studies on a given question. In these diverse definitions, the clear distinguishing features of the SR \nare therefore its formality, transparency and replicability: its \u201csystematic-ness\u201d.  \n \nStages of a systematic review  \nA good quality SR follows a formal procedure which starts with the formulation of a precise question \nthat includes a definition of the participants, the intervention to be assessed and the outcomes to be \nmeasured. [11, 12] This is followed by the development of a protocol which a priori outlines the \ninclusion and exclusion criteria, the searches to be undertaken and the sources to be consulted. A \nrigorous literature search, which combines electronic database searches, searching the references of \nidentified studies, hand searching relevant journals, and contacting experts in the field, is then \nconducted. [11, 12] Studies are then selected in terms of whether they meet the strict inclusion criteria \n(which usually includes criteria to define relevance to the review question and methodological criteria).  \nIncluded studies are then data extracted using standardised forms and subjected to a methodological \ncritical appraisal (in which the quality of the studies is assessed). The studies are then synthesised \nusing meta-analysis (a statistical strategy for pooling the results of several studies into a single effect \nestimate) or narrative synthesis (data synthesis and exploration of heterogeneity using description) \ntaking into account study designs and the results of the critical appraisal. The results of the synthesis \nthen need to be interpreted and reflected upon in terms of the research, policy and practice \nimplications. The final stage of the review is writing up and publication and it is essential that the \nmethods of the SR are clearly described and the limitations of the included studies (and the SR itself) \nare acknowledged.  \n \n \n \n 6 \nCONDUCTING A REVIEW \nThese suggestions on how to conduct a SR are based on experience of ten reviews (Box 1) and are \nrelated to different stages and aspects of the review process.  \n \nAsking the right question  \nIt is essential that the review question is right as it dictates the remit of the review. Conventionally, SR \nguidance has recommended that the review question be kept tight. It should define the intervention of \ninterest, the population receiving the intervention, the outcome(s) of interested, and the study designs \ndeemed worthy of inclusion.[11] However, the use of SRs in evaluating public health and social \ninterventions has highlighted problems with this approach as policy or practice questions may well be \nbroader and the answer may cover more than one intervention.[21] For example in the welfare to \nwork review (Box 1) the policy (or intervention) under review was \u201cwelfare to work\u201d, however this \ncovers a multitude of different types of intervention (such as anti-discrimination legislation, vocational \nrehabilitation, return to work credits etc) which may operate on the outcome in different ways. [14] \nThis was also the case in the reviews which examined the health effects of changing the organisation \nof the work environment in which task restructuring interventions ranged from the introduction of team \nworking to increased task variety.[16] Broader review questions can therefore enable the mapping of \ndifferent interventions related to the overall review question.[28] The use of a broad question may \ntherefore be essential and advantageous in certain circumstances. However, the use of a broader \nreview question is not without problems as it increases the breadth and size of the review, and \npotentially makes it harder to complete. It is therefore probably advantageous to break a broad review \nquestion down into smaller ones. A pilot scoping study which maps out the potential interventions of \ninterest (and also pilots the search strategy) will also be a useful way of controlling and containing the \nreview. The development of a review protocol is essential in this regard as it sets out the parameters, \nis an on-going source of reference, and is therefore an essential element in managing the review \nprocess. [11, 12] \n \nThe value of team work   \nOne of the most daunting aspects of conducting a review is perhaps the isolation that it can engender. \nAttempting to conduct a review as a sole researcher or with very little preparation, help or support is \n 7 \nnot sensible. The SR methodology literature is full of comments about the importance of using a \nsecond reviewer to independently select and critically appraise studies, as well as check data \nextraction.[11, 29] Experience suggests that this is not just beneficial in terms of methodological rigour \nand preventing bias, but also in terms of sharing the work load and ensuring that there is support \nthroughout the review process. Ideally, an SR should be conducted by a team which includes an \nexperienced reviewer, a subject specialist and a librarian or search expert. If this is not possible then \nthe Cochrane model of a review advisory group should be considered. SRs which use the skills of \nspecialists are much easier to conduct and complete. The use of a search specialist has particular \nadvantages in social science research and in terms of ensuring a specific and sensitive search \nstrategy is developed.[30] This can save time later in the process particularly in terms of sifting titles \nand abstracts. A subject specialist will also be able to assist in study location (e.g. by pointing out grey \nliterature sources or specialist databases) however, the real benefit will come in terms of the \ninterpretation and synthesis of the results. For example, the SR of partnership working (Box 1) used \nthe combined skills of three researchers, a librarian, an experienced systematic reviewer and a \nsubject expert.[20]  \n \nSearches: Breadth versus depth   \nThere is an implicit debate in the SR literature about the breadth of searches required with some \nsources (purists) suggesting that only reviews which include a comprehensive search of all available \nevidence (via extensive searches of multiple databases, hand searches etc), can be called a SR, \nwhilst others (the pragmatists) are prepared to acknowledge that it is possible to conduct a SR of \nsome of the evidence base (e.g. it is possible to conduct a SR of only one database \u2013 albeit \naccompanied by supplemental searches, see below) as long as this is done systematically and with \ntransparency over the methods used and acknowledgement of the SR\u201fs limitations. \u201cPragmatist\u201d SRs \ntherefore focus on a handful of \u201cfirst line\u201d health and social science databases,[31, 32] or supplement \nthis with the use of a subject specialist one,[33, 34] whilst  \u201cpurist\u201d SRs have tended to search every \navailable and potentially relevant electronic database. [17, 18, 35]   \n \nEach approach has associated costs and benefits. So for example, SRs which look only at a few \nprominent databases save time (both at the searching stage and the sifting of titles and abstracts \n 8 \nstage) but risk missing potentially relevant studies. Conversely, searching every database known has \na high time cost, although additional studies may be located (such studies may however be lower \ndown the evidence hierarchy \u2013 see 4 below). There is evidence to suggest that combining first line \nsearches with a more specialist database might be the most fruitful approach as a paper reflecting on \nthe search strategies used in a SR, of the effectiveness of interventions in promoting a population \nshift from using cars towards walking and cycling, found that the majority of relevant studies were \nlocated not in a \u201cfirst line\u201d database such as Medline or Web of Science but in a specialist transport \ndatabase.[34, 36]  \n \nSupplemental searches (hand search, websites, citation follow up, or expert contact) are essential \nand may in some cases even further negate the need for a broad \u201cpurist\u201d search of the electronic \ndatabases especially in SRs of social interventions in which the grey literature is likely to be a \nprominent source of studies.[21] For example, in the two SRs of shift work interventions, although 27 \ndifferent databases were searched, 40 of the 66 included studies were found in either Medline or \nEmbase, and half (13) of the others were found via citation follow up (Box 1).[17, 18] Similarly, in the \nSR of welfare to work interventions, only three were located via the electronic searches with the rest \nfound via specialist website searches and citation follow up.[14, 21] Evidence from other reviews also \nsupport the value of web site searches and citation follow up in locating new studies.[36]  \n \nSimilarly, some reviewers insist on not limiting the searches by time, place or language. However, this \nnot only extensively broadens the remit of the review, but for the evaluation of public health policy \ninterventions, it may result in the inclusion of studies which have little contextual relevance. For \nexample, the SR of shift work interventions included a USA study from the 1930s.[17] However, the \napplicability of the findings of this study in the very changed labour market context of, say, the UK \n2009 is very limited. Similarly, SRs may often benefit from spatial restrictions as country or cultural \ncontext may matter immensely in terms of the implementation and transferability of an \nintervention.[22] Limitation by language may be a more pragmatic decision determined by the skills of \nthe review team and the budget for translation.  \n \n 9 \nThe choice of search strategy is therefore a careful balancing act and one which requires awareness \nof the subject and an informed judgement of the likely results alongside an assessment of resource \nallocation. A search strategy would therefore often benefit from an initial pilot search exercise which \nwould produce an initial impression of where studies are located. It is not however a necessity \u2013 or \nindeed always that productive - for a SR to search everywhere.  \n \nThe best available evidence \nThe transference of the SR methodology from evidence based medicine was accompanied by a \ndiscussion about its limitations in respect to the very different and diverse public health and social \nscience evidence base. Much of this focused on the applicability of the hierarchy of evidence with its \nemphasis on the RCT and experimental designs. Unadulterated attempts to transfer this part of the \nSR method often led to reviews with no or uncertain conclusions.[37] Public health SRs of \ninterventions are much more likely to be evaluated using observational and other study designs. The \nhierarchy of evidence, it was suggested, is therefore not useful, different approaches (such as \ntypologies)[38] should be utilised and public health research should look for the best available \nevidence wherever this may be found.  This perspective is not without merit, particularly in terms of \nthe importance of observational studies and qualitative research in evaluating public health and social \nscience interventions. However, in practice, it is has led to the implicit abandonment of any limitation \nin terms of study design resulting in very broad inclusion criteria.  \n \nBroad study design inclusion criteria have merit in terms of mapping interventions. For example an \nexamination of the study designs of included studies in a SR of the effectiveness of interventions in \npromoting a population shift from using cars towards walking and cycling, found that if only the better \nquality study designs were included some types of intervention would not have been identified or \nwould not of had any evidence attached to them.[28] On the other hand, inclusive searching may \nmean that for well evaluated interventions types, too many lower level studies are located and they \nadd very little additional information to the evidence base.  Often when such reviews are written up it \nis the better quality studies which are focused on in the findings and the results from lower level \nstudies are marginalised. For example, the review of the compressed working week included 40 \nstudies, yet the write up focused only on the five prospective controlled studies.[18] The broad study \n 10 \ninclusion criteria on this occasion therefore increased the breadth of the review and increased the \nassociated time and other costs (data extraction and critical appraisal are very time consuming even \nfor experienced researchers) but with very little by way of additional information.  \n \nThere is not an easy solution but experience suggests that a trade off is therefore required. SRs are \ninterested in locating and synthesising the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d (not all available evidence) this \nmeans that the hierarchy of evidence does need to be applied - albeit in a pragmatic way. The best \ncourse therefore might be to initially search for all study designs so that interventions are mapped \nagainst the evidence base,[28] but then when the parameters are known, it is only the better quality \nstudies for each type which are subjected to the lengthy data extraction and critical appraisal process. \nThis will therefore produce an account of the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d for each intervention type in \nthe SR. For example, in the case of the compressed working week intervention this would mean \ncontrolled prospective cohorts only,[18] whilst for the health walk intervention in the SR of transport \nshifts,[28] it would mean potentially going as low in the hierarchy as uncontrolled retrospective cohort \nlevel evidence. The best available evidence may well vary by intervention and this is part of the \nmapping. However, it is important not to spend unnecessary time on the data extraction and critical \nappraisal of studies which do not constitute the best available evidence for any given intervention.  \n \nTools for Reviewers   \nSRs are very labour intensive and so it is important to avoid unnecessary replication of effort. The \npopularity of SRs not only in evidence based medicine but also increasingly in public health and social \nscience means that there is the opportunity to use pre-existing and validated data extraction and \ncritical appraisal tools. Designing, developing and piloting a new data extraction and\/or critical \nappraisal tool is time consuming and it may also be challenged by peer reviewers when the review is \ncompleted and submitted for publication.[22] There are however now numerous data extraction and \ncritical appraisal tools that have already been used successfully by reviewers. These should be \nexamined and where possible adapted for use in any new SR. For example, the Cochrane Reviewers \nHandbook or the NHS CRD handbook both contain examples of data extraction forms.[11, 12] In \nterms of critical appraisal, there are various tools which can be used, the validity of which have been \nextensively examined. For example, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for the assessment of observational \n 11 \nstudies has attracted a lot of support and there are also now fairly well used ways of appraising \nqualitative evidence.[39, 40] Another approach would be to examine the tools used by existing SRs in \na similar subject area and adapt them. For example, the same data extraction and critical appraisal \ntools were used in all four of the SRs on the work environment and they were also adapted for use in \nlater reviews.[15-20] The SR process is thereby considerably simplified and streamlined with valuable \ntime saved for use in the synthesis and analysis stages. \n \nConclusion \nThis guide has demonstrated ways in which the \u201creal\u201d world practice of conducting SRs can be made \nshorter and smarter, enhancing the speed of production of SRs and reducing labour intensity whilst \nstill maintaining high methodological standards. It is not recommending an \u201canything goes\u201d approach - \nwhat is pragmatic and feasible needs to be weighed up along side considerations of what is robust \nand appropriate to help ensure that SR findings are useful and not misleading. There are clear \nadvantages in conducting the high quality pragmatic reviews which this guide has described: (a) time \nand labour resources are saved; (b) it enables reviewers to inform or respond to developments in \npolicy and practice in a more timely manner; and (c) it encourages researchers to conduct SRs before \nembarking on primary research, thereby reducing replication and helping to ensure that any \nsubsequent primary research undertaken is well informed. Hopefully this guide has quelled some of \nthe concerns of novices, elaborated on debates, and opened up the SR to new audiences so that it \nwill be used more often, by more researchers, policy makers and practioners and that it will continue \nto be a central part of the public health researchers\u201f tool box.[41]   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis guide was originally written to assist novice systematic reviewers in the Department of Social \nMedicine at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm whom I visited in February 2009.  \n  \n 12 \n \nWhat is known on this subject: \n \n\uf0a7 Systematic reviews are increasingly popular in terms of evaluating public health policies.  \n\uf0a7 However, inexperienced researchers are often apprehensive about conducting a \nsystematic review \n\uf0a7 This is because existing methodological guidance on the conduct of systematic reviews is \ntoo prescriptive and promotes an \u201cideal type\u201d view of what a systematic review should be.  \n \nWhat this study adds:  \n\uf0a7 This study draws on extensive practical experience of the conduct of various \u201creal\u201d \nsystematic reviews across different aspects of public health policy  \n\uf0a7 It highlights pragmatic ways in which systematic reviews of public health policy \ninterventions can be undertaken without compromising their methodological integrity \n\uf0a7 It thereby dispels concerns about the systematic review and opens the method up to \nnewcomers. \n \n 13 \nREFERENCES \n[1] Petticrew M, Roberts H, 2005.
