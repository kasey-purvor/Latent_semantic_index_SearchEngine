We also verify the Beilinson conjectures about K2 numerically\nfor several curves with g = 2, 3, 4 and 5. The first few sections of the paper also provide\nan elementary introduction to the Beilinson conjectures for K2 of curves.\n1. Introduction\nLet k be a number field, with r1 real embeddings and 2r2 complex embeddings into C, so that\n[k : Q] = r1 + 2r2. It is a well-known classical theorem that, if Ok is the ring of algebraic integers\nin k, then O\u2217k is a finitely generated abelian group of rank r = r1 + r2\u2212 1. If u1, . . . , ur form a basis\nof O\u2217k\/torsion, and \u03c31, . . . , \u03c3r+1 are the complex embeddings of k up to complex conjugation, then\nthe regulator of O\u2217k is defined by\nR =\n2r2\n[k : Q]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223det\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 log |\u03c31(u1)| . . . log |\u03c31(ur)|\n...\n...\n...\n1 log |\u03c3r+1(u1)| . . . log |\u03c3r+1(ur)|\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ,\nand one has that\nRess=1\u03b6k(s) =\n2r1(2\u03c0)r2R|Cl(Ok)|\nw\n\u221a\n\u2206k\n,\nwhere \u2206k is the absolute value of the discriminant of k and w the number of roots of unity in k.\nAs K0(Ok) \u223c= Cl(Ok) \u2295 Z and K1(Ok) \u223c= O\u2217k, so |Cl(Ok)| = |K0(Ok)tor| and w = |K1(Ok)tor|,\nthis can be interpreted as a statement about the K-theory of Ok, and it is from this point of view\nthat it can be generalized to \u03b6k(n) for n \u0001 2. Namely, in [Qui73], Quillen proved that Kn(Ok) is a\nfinitely generated abelian group for all n. Borel [Bor74] computed its rank, showing that this rank is\nzero for even n \u0001 2 and is equal to r\u00b1 for odd n = 2m\u22121 > 1, where (\u22121)m = \u00b11 and r\u2212 = r1+r2,\nr+ = r2. Moreover, for those odd n, Borel showed (see [Bor77]) that a suitably defined regulator of\nK2m\u22121(Ok) is a non-zero rational multiple of \u03b6k(m)\/\u03c0mr\u2213\n\u221a\n\u2206k.\nInspired by this, Bloch [Blo78] considered K2 of elliptic curves E defined over Q with complex\nmultiplication, and showed that there is a relation between a regulator associated with K2(E) and\nthe value of L(E, 2). Beilinson then proposed a very general conjecture about similar relations\nbetween certain regulators of K-groups of projective varieties over number fields and values of their\nL-functions at integers (see [Sch88, \u00a7 5]).\nReceived 17 May 2004, accepted in final form 8 August 2004, revised 3 May 2005.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification 11G40, 19E08, 19F27 (primary), 11C08, 11G30 (secondary).\nKeywords: K-theory, regulator, L-function, curve, torsion points.\nThis journal is c\u00a9 Foundation Compositio Mathematica 2006.\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nThose conjectures were tested numerically for K2 of elliptic curves over Q by Bloch and Grayson\n[BG86], which led to a modification of Beilinson\u2019s original conjecture, as explained in \u00a7 3.\nSome further numerical work has been done in this direction, for example, Young carried out\nsimilar calculations for elliptic curves over certain real quadratic number fields (as well as\nover Q) in his thesis [You95] and Kimura worked out the case of the genus two curve y2 \u2212 y = x5\nin [Kim96].\nThe goal of this paper is to verify Beilinson\u2019s conjecture numerically for K2 of a number of\nhyperelliptic curves over Q of genus greater than 1. The results of the computations support the\npredictions of Beilinson\u2019s conjecture in the cases we studied. Specifically, the conjecture states that\nthe rank of a certain torsion-free abelian group K2(C;Z) associated with the curve C over Q is equal\nto the genus g of C, and that the associated regulator (the determinant of a certain g \u00d7 g-matrix)\nis rationally proportional to the appropriately normalized value of L(C, 2) (see \u00a7 3). If g > 1 it is\nquite difficult to write down enough elements in K2(C;Z), but we give several infinite families of\nhyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 and one further infinite family for every genus g \u0001 2, as well\nas sporadic examples for g = 4 or 5, for which we can construct at least g elements of K2(C;Z).\nFor some 200 of those curves we check by computer that the regulator of g of those elements is\nnon-zero and is related to the L-function of the curve in the expected way. As the verification that\na real number is non-zero can be done numerically, these calculations prove rigorously that the\ng elements in question are linearly independent and hence that rkK2(C;Z) \u0001 g for these curves.\nThe relationship between the regulator and L(C, 2), on the other hand, can only be established\nnumerically to high precision.\nFurthermore, the second author has shown, in a sequel to this paper [Jeu05], that in the family\nfor arbitrary g \u0001 2 there are, for each g, infinitely many non-isomorphic curves for which the\nregulator of the g elements is non-zero, thus showing that rkK2(C;Z) \u0001 g for those curves.\nFor a more precise formulation of those (and other) results we refer the reader to Remark 10.11\nor [Jeu05].\nOur results also provide evidence for the reverse inequality rkK2(C;Z) \u0002 g predicted by\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture. Namely, in a number of sporadic examples, and one universal situation\n(see Remark 10.13 for the precise list), we actually construct more than g elements of K2(C;Z).\nIn each case the computer calculations of the regulator suggested a linear dependence over Z for\nany g + 1 of our elements. In most cases, including the universal case, these relations could then\nbe proved; in the few remaining cases we have only a high-precision numerical verification at the\nregulator level. As there is no intrinsic reason why the elements we construct should be linearly\ndependent when there are more than g of them, these results can be seen as evidence for the\nprediction that the rank of K2(C;Z) is at most g.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 we review the statement of Beilinson\u2019s\nconjecture for the case of K2 of curves defined over Q. In the next four sections we show how\nto construct curves with interesting elements in K2. In \u00a7 8 we deal with a technical condition in\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture, the integrality condition, and in \u00a7 9 we discuss how to compute the regulator\nnumerically. The final section is devoted to examples.\n2. Curves and their L-functions (review)\nLet C be a non-singular, projective, geometrically irreducible curve over Q of genus g. Its L-function\nis the Dirichlet series defined for Re(s) > 32 by the Euler product\nL(C, s) =\n\u220f\np prime\nLp(C, s),\n340\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nwhere the Euler factor Lp(C, s), for those primes p for which the equations defining C over Q can\nbe reduced modulo p and still define a smooth curve of genus g over Fp, is defined by the formula\nLp(C, s) = exp\n( \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(pn + 1\u2212#C(Fpn))p\n\u2212ns\nn\n)\nand is known to be the reciprocal of a polynomial in p\u2212s of degree 2g with constant term 1. For the\nremaining (finitely many) primes p, Lp(C, s)\u22121 is also a polynomial in p\u2212s with constant term 1,\nbut now of degree at most 2g. Finally, one can associate with the curve C\/Q a positive integer N\ncalled its conductor, which plays a role in the expected functional equation of its L-function (see the\nfollowing). We omit the precise definitions of the remaining Euler factors and of N as they are a little\ncomplicated and these quantities can be (and in some cases actually were) computed experimentally\nby assuming the functional equation rather than from their definitions. This functional equation is\nas follows.\nConjecture 2.1 (Hasse\u2013Weil). The function\nL\u2217(C, s) =\nN s\/2\n(2\u03c0)gs\n\u0393(s)gL(C, s)\nextends to an entire function of s and satisfies L\u2217(C, s) = wL\u2217(C, 2\u2212 s), where w = +1 or \u22121.\nNote that, if this conjecture holds, then L(0)(C, 0) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = L(g\u22121)(C, 0) = 0 and\nL(g)(C, 0)\ng!\n= lim\ns\u21920\nL(C, s)\nsg\n= L\u2217(C, 0) = wL\u2217(C, 2) =\nwN\n(2\u03c0)2g\nL(C, 2) \u0004= 0,\nbecause \u0393(s) has a pole of order one at s = 0 with residue 1.\nRemark 2.2. In this paper we need the value of L(C, s) only at s = 2, where the defining Euler\nproduct is absolutely convergent. However, this convergence is very slow and in practice we will\ncalculate the value of L(C, 2) numerically later on by assuming that Conjecture 2.1 holds and using\nthe algorithms described in [Dok04] and [Dok]. These algorithms also compute N , w and the Euler\nfactors Lp(C, s) for \u2018bad\u2019 primes under the assumption that the functional equation of L\u2217(C, s) holds\nfor some choices of these quantities from a finite list of possibilities, and at the same time check the\nvalidity of the resulting functional equation for L\u2217(C, s) to high precision.\n3. K-theory, regulators and the Beilinson conjectures\nIn this section we give definitions of the various K-groups occurring that are more elementary and\nexplicit than the usual ones, but that are equivalent in our situation. We indicate the relations to\nthe standard definitions as we go along.\nLet F be a field. Then K2(F ) can be defined1 as\nF \u2217 \u2297Z F \u2217\/\u3008a\u2297 (1\u2212 a), a \u2208 F, a \u0004= 0, 1\u3009,\nwhere \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 denotes the subgroup generated by the elements indicated. The class of a\u2297 b is denoted\n{a, b}, so that K2(F ) is an abelian group (written additively), with generators {a, b} for a and b in F \u2217,\n1The actual definition of K2 (of arbitrary rings) is more complicated (see [Mil71, \u00a7 5]), and its equivalence for fields\nwith the definition in terms of the \u2018symbols\u2019 {a, b} is a famous theorem of Matsumoto (see [Mil71, Theorem 11.1]).\n341\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nand relations\n{a1a2, b} = {a1, b}+ {a2, b}\n{a, b1b2} = {a, b1}+ {a, b2}\n{a, 1\u2212 a} = 0 if a is in F, a \u0004= 0, 1.\nIt is a nice exercise to show that these relations imply that {a, b} = \u2212{b, a} and {c,\u2212c} = 0 for a,\nb and c in F \u2217.\nNow consider a (non-singular, projective, geometrically irreducible) curve C defined over Q.\nAssociated to C are K-groups Kn(C) whose definition is a little complicated, but for this paper we\nneed only a certain quotient group2 KT2 (C) of K2(C) (\u2018T \u2019 for \u2018tame\u2019), which can be described in a\nsimpler way. Set\nKT2 (C) = ker\n(\nK2(F )\nT\u2212\u2192\n\u2295\nx\u2208C(Q)\nQ\n\u2217\n)\n,\nwhere F = Q(C) is the function field of C and where the x-component of the map T is the tame\nsymbol at x, defined by\nTx : {a, b} \n\u2192 (\u22121)ordx(a)ordx(b) a\nordx(b)\nbordx(a)\n(x). (3.1)\nNote that this definition makes sense because aordx(b)\/bordx(a) has order zero at x and hence is\ndefined and non-zero at x. It is clear that Tx is a map on F \u2217 \u2297Z F \u2217, and checking that it is trivial\non the elements a\u2297 (1\u2212 a) for a \u0004= 0, 1 is a good exercise (which also explains why we want to have\nthe power of \u22121 in the formula), so Tx defines a map on K2(F ).\nWe note that if \u03b1 is an element of K2(Q(C)), then\u220f\nx\u2208C(Q)\nTx(\u03b1) = 1, (3.2)\na result known as the product formula (see [Bas68, Theorem 8.2]).\nBeilinson, generalizing work by Bloch [Blo78], defined regulators of the K-groups of C\n(see [Sch88]). We will describe these in elementary terms for KT2 (C).\nWe start with a map from F \u2217 \u00d7 F \u2217 to the group of almost everywhere defined 1-forms on the\nRiemann surface X = C(C) by putting\n\u03b7(a, b) = log |a|d arg b\u2212 log |b|d arg a, (3.3)\nwhere arg a is the argument of a. Note that this is well defined (the argument arg is defined up to\nmultiples of 2\u03c0, but these map to zero under d) and is a smooth (indeed, real-analytic) 1-form on\nthe complement of the set of zeros and poles of a and b. It is clear that \u03b7(a1a2, b) = \u03b7(a1, b)+\u03b7(a2, b)\nand \u03b7(a, b1b2) = \u03b7(a, b1) + \u03b7(a, b2), so that \u03b7 induces a map (still denoted by \u03b7) on F \u2217 \u2297Z F \u2217. Also,\n\u03b7(a, b) is closed, as d\u03b7(a, b) = Im(d log a \u2227 d log b) = 0.\nFor any smooth closed 1-form \u03c9 defined on the complement of a finite set S \u2282 X and any smooth\noriented loop \u03b3 in X \\ S, we have a pairing\n(\u03b3, \u03c9) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u03b3\n\u03c9\nwhich depends only on the homology class of \u03b3 in X \\ S. As \u03b3 moves across a point x in S, the\nvalue of (\u03b3, \u03c9) jumps by (Cx, \u03c9), where Cx denotes a small circle around x. A simple calculation\n2Usually denoted by H0(C,K2).\n342\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nshows that (Cx, \u03b7(a, b)) = log |Tx({a, b})|. It follows that if \u03b1 =\n\u2211\ni ai\u2297 bi is an element of F \u2217\u2297ZF \u2217\nsuch that Tx(\u03b1) = 1 for all x in X, then (\u00b7, \u03b7(\u03b1)) is a well-defined map from H1(X;Z) to R.\nNext, one has to check that this map vanishes if \u03b1 = a\u2297 (1\u2212 a) and hence gives us a pairing\n\u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 : H1(X;Z)\u00d7KT2 (C)\u2192 R\ngiven by \u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009 = (\u03b3, \u03b7(\u03b1)). This follows from the fact that \u03b7(a, 1 \u2212 a) = dD(a), where D(z) is the\nBloch\u2013Wigner dilogarithm function.\nFinally, we observe that, if c denotes complex conjugation on X, then c\u2217(\u03b7(\u03b1)) = \u2212\u03b7(\u03b1) for\nany \u03b1 in KT2 (C), as c\n\u2217(log |a|) = log |a| and c\u2217(d arg b) = \u2212d arg b: a and b are in Q(C)\u2217, so\n(c\u2217b)(z) = b(z) = b(z). This means that if \u03b3 is in H1(X;Z)+, the c-invariant part of H1(X;Z), then\n\u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009 = 0 for any \u03b1 in KT2 (C):\n\u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u03b3\n\u03b7(\u03b1) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nc\u25e6\u03b3\n\u03b7(\u03b1) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u03b3\nc\u2217(\u03b7(\u03b1)) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u03b3\n\u03b7(\u03b1) = \u2212\u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009.\nWe therefore have to compute \u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009 only for \u03b3 in H1(X;Z)\/H1(X;Z)+. In practice, we can just as\nwell compute it for all \u03b3 in H1(X;Z)\u2212, the anti-invariants in H1(X;Z) under the action of c, giving\nus finally the regulator pairing\n\u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 : H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u00d7KT2 (C)\/torsion \u2192 R. (3.4)\nIt is easy to see that H1(X;Z)\u2212 has rank g. Beilinson originally conjectured3 that the rank of\nKT2 (C)\/torsion was also equal to g, that the pairing in (3.4) was non-degenerate, and that there\nwas a relation between L(C, 2) and the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix of this\npairing with respect to bases of H1(X,Z)\u2212 and KT2 (C)\/torsion. Unfortunately, this conjecture was\nwrong, as KT2 (C)\/torsion can already have rank larger than g for g = 1, as was discovered by Bloch\nand Grayson in [BG86]. They found that one should consider a certain subgroup of KT2 (C)\/torsion\ndefined by an additional condition, which we now proceed to describe.\nThe extra condition comes from the fact that one should not consider the curve over Q, but\ninstead a model of it over Z. This is analogous to the situation in \u00a7 1, where one has to consider\nK1(Ok) \u223c= O\u2217k instead of K1(k) \u223c= k\u2217 in order to get the correct regulator.\nSo let C be a regular proper model of C over Z, i.e. a regular, proper, irreducible two-dimensional\nscheme over Z such that the generic fiber CQ is isomorphic to C (see, e.g., [Liu02, ch. 10]). For each\nprime p, let Cp be the fiber of C over Fp. For each irreducible component D of the curve Cp, let\nFp(D) denote its field of rational functions over Fp. Then we define\nKT2 (C) = ker\n(\nKT2 (C) \u2192\n\u2295\np,D\u2286Cp\nFp(D)\u2217\n)\n, (3.5)\nwhere the map to Fp(D)\u2217 is given as follows. The order of vanishing along D gives rise to a discrete\nvaluation, vD, on F . The component for D of the map in (3.5) is given by the corresponding tame\nsymbol\nTD : {a, b} \n\u2192 (\u22121)vD(a)vD(b) a\nvD(b)\nbvD(a)\n(D), (3.6)\nin complete analogy with (3.1). Finally, we set\nK2(C;Z) = KT2 (C)\/torsion, (3.7)\n3Strictly speaking, Beilinson conjecturedKT2 (C)\u2297ZQ to have dimension g over Q. However,KT2 (C)\/K2(Q) is expected\nto be finitely generated by virtue of a conjecture of Bass, and as K2(Q) is a torsion group, this would imply the\nequivalence of Beilinson\u2019s formulation and our formulation.\n343\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\na subgroup of KT2 (C)\/torsion. This group, sometimes denoted by K2(C)Z\/torsion (cf. [Sou86, \u00a7 3.3]),\nis independent of the choice of the regular proper model C of C (see [Sch88, p. 13]), justifying the\nnotation.\nRemark 3.8. We could have defined KT2 (C) in a single step as\nKT2 (C) = ker\n(\nK2(F ) \u2192\n\u2295\nD\nF(D)\u2217\n)\n, (3.9)\nwhereD runs through all irreducible curves on C and F(D) stands for the residue field at D. Any such\nD is either \u2018vertical\u2019, in which case it is a component of some Cp and TD is the map in (3.6), or else\n\u2018horizontal\u2019, in which case it corresponds to the Gal(Q\/Q)-orbit of some x in C(Q) and TD being\ntrivial is equivalent to Ty being trivial for all y in that Gal(Q\/Q)-orbit.\nWe can now restrict the pairing (3.4) to\n\u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 : H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u00d7K2(C;Z) \u2192 R, (3.10)\nand formulate our description of Beilinson\u2019s conjecture, as modified in accordance with [BG86],\nas follows.\nConjecture 3.11. Let C be a non-singular, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus g\ndefined over Q, and let X = C(C). Then:\n(1) the group K2(C;Z) is a free abelian group of rank g and the pairing (3.10) is non-degenerate;\n(2) let R denote the absolute value of the determinant of this pairing with respect to Z-bases of\nH1(X;Z)\u2212 and K2(C;Z), and let L\u2217(C, 0) be defined as in \u00a7 2; then L\u2217(C, 0) = QR for some\nnon-zero rational number Q.\nRemark 3.12. The definition of L\u2217(C, 0) requires the analytic continuation of L(C, s), but as the\nanalytic continuation and the expected functional equation of L(C, s) would imply that L\u2217(C, 0)\nis rationally proportional to \u03c0\u22122gL(C, 2), Beilinson\u2019s conjecture could be formulated without any\nassumptions about the analytic continuation of L(C, s).\nRemark 3.13. In practice, the conjecture is rather intractable, as it seems impossible to compute\nK2(C;Z) even after tensoring this group with Q. Indeed, we neither can guarantee finding enough\nelements to generate K2(C;Z), nor can we necessarily determine the rank of a subgroup generated\nby finitely many elements, as we do not know any practical method for determining whether a given\ncombination of elements in F \u2217 \u2297Z F \u2217 can be written as a sum of Steinberg symbols a \u2297 (1 \u2212 a).\nHowever, we can try to find g elements in K2(C;Z) and compute R as in the conjecture using those\nelements rather than a basis of K2(C;Z). If R is non-zero numerically we can check the relation\nwith L\u2217(C, 0) as in Conjecture 3.11. Also, if we have more than g elements \u03b1j in K2(C;Z), the\nconjecture implies that the maps \u3008\u00b7, \u03b1j\u3009 : H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u2192 R should be linearly dependent over Z, and\nthis can also be checked numerically. Both types of verification will be carried out in \u00a7 10.\nRemark 3.14. We have restricted ourselves to the statement of Beilinson\u2019s conjecture for a curve\nover Q, but the conjecture can be formulated equally well for any number field k. Suppose that\nC\/k is a (non-singular, projective, geometrically irreducible) curve of genus g. Let Ok be the ring of\nintegers of k, and let C be a model of C\/k over Ok. Then one defines KT2 (C) as in (3.9), with the sum\nover all irreducible curves D in C. Again, for the \u2018horizontal\u2019 curves D, the TD correspond to the Tx\nfor x in C(Q), up to conjugation under Gal(Q\/k). Once again, KT2 (C)\/torsion is independent of\nthe choice of the model C, and is denoted by K2(C;Z). One expects K2(C;Z) \u223c= Zg[k:Q]. The main\ndifference is that the Riemann surface involved will no longer be connected. Instead, let X be\nthe Riemann surface obtained from all points in C over C, using all embeddings of k into C.\n344\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nThis is a disjoint union of [k : Q] connected Riemann surfaces, each of genus g. Complex conjugation\nacts on this either by swapping conjugate pairs of complex embeddings of k, or by acting on the\nRiemann surface corresponding to a real embedding of k. Then H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u223c= Zg[k:Q], and there is\na pairing H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u00d7 K2(C;Z) \u2192 R given by \u3008\u03b3, \u03b1\u3009 = (1\/2\u03c0)\n\u222b\n\u03b3 \u03b7(\u03b1). Here \u03b7(\u03b1) is the 1-form\non X that, if \u03b1 = {a, b}, is given on the connected Riemann surface corresponding to \u03c3 : k \u2192 C\nby log |a\u03c3|d arg b\u03c3 \u2212 log |b\u03c3|d arg a\u03c3. (The subscripts indicate that we consider the functions on the\nRiemann surface obtained by applying \u03c3 to the coefficients involved in a and b.) One again expects\n\u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 to be non-degenerate, defines R to be the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix\nof \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 with respect to Z-bases of H1(X;Z)\u2212 and K2(C;Z), and conjectures that L\u2217(C, 0) = QR\nfor some non-zero rational number Q.\n4. Constructing elements of K2 from torsion divisors\nThe first problem in testing Conjecture 3.11 is that it is not at all clear how to construct elements\nof KT2 (C) on a given curve C over Q; that is, how to produce rational functions fi, gi on C such\nthat\n\u2211\ni{fi, gi} has trivial tame symbol at every point of C.\nTo understand this condition, consider one symbol {f, g} in K2(Q(C)). If div(f) and div(g) have\ndisjoint support, then this symbol lies in KT2 (C) if and only if f(P )\nordP (g) = 1 for every zero or pole\nP of g and g(Q)ordQ(f) = 1 for every zero or pole Q of f . Essentially this says that f = 1 (or a root\nof unity, if |ordP (g)| > 1) whenever g has a zero or a pole, and similarly with f and g interchanged.\nTo try to satisfy these conditions, it is natural to look at functions that have only very few zeros\nand poles. The simplest case is given by functions f and g that have only one (multiple) zero and\none (multiple) pole. If one of these points is common for f and g, then it turns out that simply\nrenormalizing the functions is sufficient to satisfy the tame symbol conditions. For this we use the\nproduct formula (3.2). All of our examples are then based on the following construction.\nConstruction 4.1. Let C\/Q be a curve. Assume P1, P2, P3 \u2208 C(Q) are distinct points whose\npairwise differences are torsion divisors. Thus there are rational functions fi with\ndiv(fi) = mi(Pi+1)\u2212mi(Pi\u22121), i \u2208 Z\/3Z,\nwhere mi is the order of (Pi+1)\u2212 (Pi\u22121) in the divisor group Pic0(C). We then define three elements\nof K2(Q(C)) by\nSi =\n{\nfi+1\nfi+1(Pi+1)\n,\nfi\u22121\nfi\u22121(Pi\u22121)\n}\n, i \u2208 Z\/3Z.\nThe functions fi are unique up to constants, so the symbols Si are uniquely defined by the points Pi.\nMoreover, they satisfy the tame symbol condition everywhere, as stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 4.2. The Si are elements of KT2 (C).\nProof. The components of Si are normalized to make the tame symbol trivial at Pi\u22121 and Pi+1.\nBy the product formula (3.2) it is also trivial at Pi, this being the only other point in the support\nof the divisors of fi\u22121 and fi+1.\nNext we show that the three elements Si generate a subgroup of rank at most 1 of KT2 (C)\/torsion.\nProposition 4.3. We keep the notation of Construction 4.1.\n(1) There is a unique element {P1, P2, P3} of KT2 (C)\/torsion such that in this group\nSi =\nlcm(m1,m2,m3)\nmi\n{P1, P2, P3}, i = 1, 2, 3.\n345\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\n(2) The element {P1, P2, P3} is unchanged under even permutations and changes sign under odd\npermutations of the points.\nProof. (1) Uniqueness is obvious, so we only need to show existence. Replacing the functions fi by\nfi\/fi(Pi) if necessary, we can assume that fi(Pi) = 1, so that Si = {fi+1, fi}. Now let\nL = lcm(m1,m2) = lcm(m1,m3) = lcm(m2,m3); (4.4)\nthe three least common multiples are equal as every integer that kills both (Pi)\u2212(Pi+1) and (Pi+1)\u2212\n(Pi+2) in Pic0(C) also kills (Pi) \u2212 (Pi+2), which is their sum. It follows that L = lcm(m1,m2,m3)\nand that the quotients ri = L\/mi, i = 1, 2, 3 are pairwise relatively prime. Then div(f rii ) =\nL(Pi+1)\u2212 L(Pi\u22121), so the function f r11 f r22 f r33 has trivial divisor, and is therefore a constant:\nf r11 f\nr2\n2 f\nr3\n3 = c. (4.5)\nNext, we have, in KT2 (C),\nr1S2 = {f3, f r11 }, r2S1 = {f r22 , f3} = \u2212{f3, f r22 },\nso\nr1S2 \u2212 r2S1 = {f3, f r11 f r22 } = {f3, cf\u2212r33 } = {f3, (\u22121)r3c},\nbecause {f3,\u2212f3} is trivial. As the left-hand side is in KT2 (C), so is {f3, (\u22121)r3c}. This implies\nthat c2m3 = 1, so {f3, (\u22121)r3c} is torsion. Therefore, modulo torsion, for i, j = 1, 2, 3, riSj = rjSi.\nNow choose integers \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 such that\n\u2211\n\u03b1iri = 1 and set T = \u03b11S1 + \u03b12S2 + \u03b13S3. Then\nr1T = \u03b11r1S1 + \u03b12r1S2 + \u03b13r1S3 = \u03b11r1S1 + \u03b12r2S1 + \u03b13r3S1 = S1,\nand, similarly, r2T = S2 and r3T = S3, all modulo torsion. In particular, the subgroup \u3008S1, S2, S3\u3009\nof KT2 (C)\/torsion is generated by the class of T alone.\n(2) The first statement follows from the construction in part (1). For the second, let fi be as\nabove, chosen so that fi(Pi) = 1.\nTake P\u02dc1 = P2, P\u02dc2 = P1, P\u02dc3 = P3 and the functions f\u02dc1 = f\u221212 , f\u02dc2 = f\n\u22121\n1 , f\u02dc3 = f\n\u22121\n3 , so that\n\u03b1\u02dc1 = \u03b12, \u03b1\u02dc2 = \u03b11 and \u03b1\u02dc3 = \u03b13. The corresponding symbols are\nS\u02dc1 = {f\u02dc2, f\u02dc3} = {f\u221211 , f\u221213 } = \u2212{f1, f\u221213 } = {f1, f3} = \u2212{f3, f1} = \u2212S2,\nand, similarly, S\u02dc2 = {f\u221213 , f\u221212 } = \u2212S1 and S\u02dc3 = {f\u221212 , f\u221211 } = \u2212S3. Then modulo torsion,\nT\u02dc = \u03b1\u02dc1S\u02dc1 + \u03b1\u02dc2S\u02dc2 + \u03b1\u02dc3S\u02dc3 = \u2212\u03b12S2 \u2212 \u03b11S1 \u2212 \u03b13S3 = \u2212T.\nProposition 4.6. Let C\/Q be a curve and P1, P2, P3, P4 be four distinct points in C(Q) such that\nall (Pi)\u2212 (Pj) are torsion divisors. Then the four elements\n{P1, . . . , P\u0302i, . . . , P4} (1 \u0002 i \u0002 4)\nare linearly dependent. More precisely, if mij is the order of (Pi)\u2212 (Pj), then\n4\u2211\ni=1\n(\u22121)ici{P1, . . . , P\u0302i, . . . , P4} = 0 (4.7)\nholds in KT2 (C)\/torsion with\nci = gcd(mij,mik,mil) ({i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4}). (4.8)\nProof. Choose fij with div(fij) = mij(Pi)\u2212mij(Pj). The discussion surrounding (4.5) shows that(\nfij\nfij(Pk)\n)M\/mij( fjk\nfjk(Pi)\n)M\/mjk( fki\nfki(Pj)\n)M\/mki\n= 1\n346\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nif {i, j, k} \u2282 {1, 2, 3, 4} and M is any integer divisible by 2 lcm(mij ,mjk,mik)2. Choose such positive\nM common for all triples {i, j, k} and let Fij = fM\/mijij . Then\ndiv(Fij) = M(Pi)\u2212M(Pj) ({i, j} \u2282 {1, 2, 3, 4})\nand\nFij\nFij(Pk)\nFjk\nFjk(Pi)\nFki\nFki(Pj)\n= 1 ({i, j, k} \u2282 {1, 2, 3, 4}). (4.9)\nAlso, define elements of KT2 (C) by\nSi,j,k =\n{\nFki\nFki(Pj)\n,\nFij\nFij(Pk)\n}\n=\n{\nFij\nFij(Pk)\n,\nFjk\nFjk(Pi)\n}\n=\n{\nFjk\nFjk(Pi)\n,\nFki\nFki(Pj)\n}\n.\nThe asserted relation (4.7), but with ci replaced by\nc\u2032i =\nlcm(mlj ,mlk,mjk)\nmljmlkmjk\n({i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4}), (4.10)\nthen follows from the statement that, in KT2 (C)\/torsion,\nS1,2,3 \u2212 S1,2,4 + S1,3,4 \u2212 S2,3,4 = 0. (4.11)\nTo prove (4.11), let f = F14\/F14(P2), g = F24\/F24(P3) and h = F34\/F34(P1). Rescaling if nec-\nessary, we may also assume that F12 = fg\u22121, F23 = gh\u22121 and F31 = hf\u22121. Finally, let \u03b1 =\nf(P3), \u03b2 = g(P1), \u03b3 = h(P2). Now we apply (4.9) for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4} and\n{1, 2, 3}. This gives, respectively, that (fg\u22121)(P4) = \u03b2\u22121, (gh\u22121)(P4) = \u03b3\u22121, (hf\u22121)(P4) = \u03b1\u22121\nand \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 1. Finally, using all of these we expand the symbols Si,j,k in terms of the eight generators,\nv = ({f, g}, {f, h}, {g, h}, {f, \u03b2}, {g, \u03b1}, {g, \u03b2}, {h, \u03b1}, {\u03b1, \u03b2}).\nWe find\nS1,2,3 = {fg\u22121\/\u03b1, gh\u22121\/\u03b2} = (1,\u22121, 1,\u22121, 1, 1,\u22121, 1) \u00b7 v,\n\u2212S1,2,4 = {f, g\/\u03b2} = (\u22121, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) \u00b7 v,\nS1,3,4 = {f\/\u03b1, h} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) \u00b7 v,\n\u2212S2,3,4 = {g, h\/\u03b3} = (0, 0,\u22121, 0,\u22121,\u22121, 0, 0) \u00b7 v.\nTherefore the left-hand side of (4.11) reduces to one symbol {\u03b1, \u03b2}. This symbol can also be rewritten\nin terms of the original functions. One shows that\n{\u03b1, \u03b2} = \u00b1\n{(\nfkl(Pi)\nfkl(Pj)\n)M\/mkl\n,\n(\nfil(Pj)\nfil(Pk)\n)M\/mil}\nfor all combinations of four distinct indices i, j, k and l with |i\u2212 k| = |j \u2212 l| = 2. In any case this\nelement comes from K2 of a number field, which is torsion. Hence, the asserted relation holds.\nIt remains to show that the numbers ci and c\u2032i defined by (4.8) and (4.10) are proportional.\nEquivalently, if \u03b3i = vp(ci) and \u03b3\u2032i = vp(c\n\u2032\ni) denote the valuations of ci and c\n\u2032\ni at some prime p, then\nwe must show that \u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3\u2032i is independent of i. The numbers \u03b3i and \u03b3\u2032i are given by\n\u03b3i = min\nj \b=i\n{\u03bdij}, \u03b3\u2032i = max\nj,k \b=i\n{\u03bdjk} \u2212\n\u2211\nj,k \b=i,j<k\n\u03bdjk (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), (4.12)\nwhere \u03bdij denotes vp(mij). If we use the six numbers \u03bdij to label the edges of a tetrahedron T in\nthe obvious way, then the relation (4.4) states that the two largest labels of the sides of any face\nof T are equal. From this we find easily that there are two possibilities: if three incident edges of T\nhave the same label, then, possibly after renumbering, we have \u03bd12 = \u03bd13 = \u03bd14 = a, \u03bd23 = \u03bd24 = b,\n\u03bd34 = c for some integers a \u0001 b \u0001 c, while if this does not happen then, again up to renumbering,\n347\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nwe have \u03bd13 = \u03bd14 = \u03bd23 = \u03bd24 = a, \u03bd12 = b, \u03bd34 = c with a > b, c. From (4.12) we then find that\n(\u03b31, . . . , \u03b34) and (\u03b3\u20321, . . . , \u03b3\u20324) are given by (a, b, c, c) and (\u2212b\u2212 c,\u2212a\u2212 c,\u2212a\u2212 b,\u2212a\u2212 b) in the first\ncase and by (b, b, c, c) and (\u2212a\u2212 c,\u2212a\u2212 c,\u2212a\u2212 b,\u2212a\u2212 b) in the second case, so that in both cases\n\u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3\u2032i = a+ b+ c for all i. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.6.\nCorollary 4.13. Let C be a curve defined over Q and P1, . . . , Pn \u2208 C(Q) points such that all\n(Pi)\u2212 (Pj) are torsion. Then the subspace of KT2 (C)\u2297 Q generated by all elements {Pi, Pj , Pk} is\nalready generated by those of the form {P1, Pi, Pj}.\nThe corollary implies that the space spanned by the n(n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2) symbols {Pi, Pj , Pk}, which\nalready by Proposition 4.3(2) had dimension at most\n(n\n3\n)\n, in fact has dimension at most\n(n\u22121\n2\n)\n.\nRemark 4.14. If C\/Q is a curve, it is sometimes convenient to consider points Pi in C(Q). Then we\nhave to work in KT2 (CQ), which is defined as the kernel of the tame symbol (given by (3.1)),\nKT2 (CQ) = ker\n(\nK2(Q(C)) \u2192\n\u2295\nx\u2208C(Q)\nQ\n\u2217\n)\n.\nThe product formula (3.2) still holds for elements in K2(Q(C)). All the results in this section remain\ntrue in this context. Moreover, as the inclusion of Q(C) into Q(C) induces a map from K2(Q(C)) to\nK2(Q(C)) and the tame symbol on both groups is given by the same formula, we can check whether\nan element in K2(Q(C)) lies in KT2 (C) using the tame symbol on its image in K2(Q(C)).\nIn fact, the map K2(Q(C)) \u2192 K2(Q(C)) has torsion kernel and we may identify K2(Q(C))\u2297Q\nwith the subspace of K2(Q(C)) \u2297 Q on which Gal(Q\/Q) acts trivially. The same statements hold\nwhen we replace K2(Q(C)) by KT2 (C) and K2(Q(C)) by K\nT\n2 (CQ)\nThe final result of this section, a strengthening of Corollary 4.13, states that we cannot construct\nany more elements of KT2 (CQ) \u2297 Q using only functions whose zeros and poles differ by torsion\ndivisors than those already given by Construction 4.1.\nProposition 4.15. Let S \u2286 C(Q) and P0 \u2208 S be such that (P )\u2212 (P0) is a torsion divisor for all P\nin S. Let V be the subspace of KT2 (CQ)\u2297Q generated by all elements {P,Q,P0} with P,Q \u2208 S and\nW the subspace of K2(Q(C))\u2297Q generated by all symbols {f, g} with div(f) and div(g) supported\nin S. Then\nW \u2229KT2 (CQ)\u2297Q = V.\nProof. Let \u03be =\n\u2211\ni{fi, gi} be an element of W \u2229 KT2 (CQ) \u2297 Q. Replacing S with the finite set of\nall zeros and poles of the fi and gi, by assumption there exist an integer N > 0 and, for each P \u2208\nS\\{P0}, a function fP \u2208 Q(C)\u2217 with div(fP ) = N(P )\u2212N(P0). Then each fNi or gNi is, up to a scalar\nfactor, a multiplicative combination of the functions fP , so N2\u03be is a linear combination of symbols\nof the form {fP , fQ}, {fP , c} and {c, c\u2032} with c, c\u2032 \u2208 Q\u2217. However, {c, c\u2032} = 0 in KT2 (Q(C)) \u2297 Q\nand {fP , fQ} is the sum of {fP , fQ(P )} + {fP (Q), fQ} and a multiple of {P,Q,P0} \u2208 V , so \u03be can\nbe written as\n\u2211\nP {fP , cP } + \u03be\u2032 with \u03be\u2032 \u2208 V for some constants cP \u2208 Q\n\u2217. As the tame symbol\nof {fP , cP } at x is c\u2212NP for x = P and trivial for all other x \u2208 C(Q) \\ {P0}, the fact that some\nmultiple of \u03be (and, hence, also of \u03be\u2212\u03be\u2032) has trivial tame symbol everywhere implies that each cP is a\nroot of unity. Hence \u03be \u2208 V .\n5. Torsion divisors on hyperelliptic curves\nNow suppose that C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g \u0001 1 defined over Q. The hyperelliptic\ninvolution on C determines a double cover \u03c6 : C \u2192 P1 ramified at 2g + 2 points, the fixed\n348\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\npoints of the involution. Assume that one of these points \u221eC is defined over Q. After a change\nof coordinates on P1 we can assume that \u03c6(\u221eC) = \u221eP1. Then C gets a model\ny2 = c2g+1x2g+1 + c2gx2g + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ c1x+ c0, c2g+1 \u0004= 0, (5.1)\nwhere the polynomial on the right has coefficients in Q and has no multiple roots. This equation\ncan be seen either as defining a double cover of P1 or as a curve (singular for g > 1) in P2 whose\nnormalization is C. The point \u221e = \u221eC is then the unique point at infinity of this normalization.\nThe cover \u03c6 is given by the function x on C and its ramification points are \u221e and the T\u03b1 = (\u03b1, 0),\nwhere \u03b1 runs through the roots of the right-hand side of (5.1) in Q.\nWe will look for points P such that the divisor (P )\u2212 (\u221e) is m-torsion for some m. Such points\nwill be called (m-) torsion points. Of course, if P,Q are torsion points, then (P ) \u2212 (Q) is also a\ntorsion divisor. If we succeed in constructing many torsion points Pi, then we get many elements\n{\u221e, Pi, Pj} \u2208 KT2 (C)\/torsion by using Proposition 4.3. Below we give some examples of curves with\ntorsion points.\nExample 5.2 (2-torsion). With notation as before, any non-trivial difference (P ) \u2212 (Q) for P and\nQ among \u221e and the T\u03b1 is 2-torsion:\n2(T\u03b1)\u2212 2(T\u03b2) = div\n(\nx\u2212 \u03b1\nx\u2212 \u03b2\n)\n, 2(T\u03b1)\u2212 2(\u221e) = div(x\u2212 \u03b1).\nSo the T\u03b1 are 2-torsion points, although not necessarily defined over Q.\nConversely, suppose given an arbitrary curve C over Q and two distinct points P,Q in\nC(Q) such that the divisor (P )\u2212 (Q) is 2-torsion. Say div(\u03c6) = 2(P )\u2212 2(Q) with \u03c6 defined over Q.\nThen \u03c6 : C \u2192 P1 is a double cover defined over Q. It follows that C is hyperelliptic and admits a\nmodel (5.1) with Q = \u221e, P among the T\u03b1.\nUnfortunately, we cannot use 2-torsion points alone to obtain interesting elements in\nKT2 (CQ)\/torsion by the construction of Section 4: the calculation{\nx\u2212 \u03b2\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2 ,\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n}\n=\n{\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1,\nx\u2212 \u03b2\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2\n}\n=\n{\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1, 1\u2212\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\n}\n= 0\nshows that {\u221e, T\u03b1, T\u03b2} is trivial for any \u03b1 and \u03b2, and Proposition 4.6 (or rather, its analogue\nover Q) then shows that the elements {T\u03b1, T\u03b2 , T\u03b3} also vanish. The 2-torsion points can nevertheless\nbe used, but only in combination with the torsion points of other orders which we describe next.\nExample 5.3 ((2g + 1)-torsion). Assume that the hyperelliptic equation (5.1) has the special form\ny2 = cx2g+1 + (bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b1x+ b0)2 (5.4)\nfor some c \u0004= 0. We can scale x and y to make c = \u22121 if desired, which allows a uniform treatment\ntogether with Example 5.6 below. The substitution y \n\u2192 y +\u2211 bixi transforms this equation to\ny2 + 2(bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0)y = cx2g+1. (5.5)\nThe point O = (0, 0) (corresponding to (0, b0) on the curve (5.4)) lies on this curve and the function y\nhas divisor (2g + 1)(O)\u2212 (2g + 1)(\u221e), so O is a (2g + 1)-torsion point.\nIn fact, any curve C as in (5.1) with a non-trivial rational (2g+1)-torsion point O is isomorphic\nto a curve of the form (5.4) and hence (5.5). Indeed, given such a curve C, consider the local system\nL = H0(C,OC((2g + 1)\u221e)).\nBy Riemann\u2013Roch, the dimension of this as Q-vector space is 1\u2212 g + 2g + 1 = g + 2. It is easy to\nsee that {1, x, . . . , xg, y} is a basis. So for a point O = (xO, yO) \u2208 C(Q) the divisor (2g + 1)(O) \u2212\n(2g + 1)(\u221e) is principal if and only if there is an element of L,\nh(x, y) = y \u2212 b\u02dcgxg \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 b\u02dc1x\u2212 b\u02dc0,\n349\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nwhich vanishes to order exactly 2g+1 at O. (Note that necessarily it cannot be expressed in terms\nof x alone because the order of such a function is at most 2g.) Then the curve defined by h(x, y) = 0\ncan have only the point (xO, yO) in common with C, and after substituting y = b\u02dcgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b\u02dc1x+ b\u02dc0\nin (5.1), we see that the equation of the curve is of the form\ny2 = c(x\u2212 xO)2g+1 + (b\u02dcgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b\u02dc1x+ b\u02dc0)2.\nAfter a translation we can assume xO = 0 and the equation of the curve becomes of the form (5.4)\nwith O = (0, b0).\nExample 5.6 ((2g + 2)-torsion). Similar to the previous example, a curve\ny2 = \u2212c2x2g+2 + (cxg+1 + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b1x+ b0)2,\nwith bg, c \u0004= 0 is of the form (5.1) and it has a model\ny2 + 2(cxg+1 + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0)y = \u2212c2x2g+2.\nIn this model div(y) = (2g+2)(O)\u2212(2g+2)(\u221e), so the curve has a (2g+2)-torsion point O = (0, 0).\nScaling y we can assume that c = 1, hence \u2212c2 = \u22121, allowing a uniform treatment together with\nExample 5.3.\nAs in Example 5.3, one can use the linear system\nL = H0(C,OC ((2g + 2)\u221e))\nto show that any curve (5.1) with a rational (2g + 2)-torsion point has a model of this form.\n6. Elements of K2 for hyperelliptic curves\nIn this section we study elements of KT2 (C) constructed from torsion points on a non-singular\nhyperelliptic curve C\/Q of genus g. We have seen that using only 2-torsion points is not sufficient\nto construct non-torsion elements. So we will use curves which also have rational torsion points of\norder 2g + 1 or 2g + 2.\nAs discussed in Examples 5.3 and 5.6, such a curve C\/Q can always be given by an equation of\nthe form\ny2 + f(x)y + xd = 0 (6.1)\nin one of the following two cases:\nd = 2g + 1, f(x) = bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0; (6.2a)\nd = 2g + 2, f(x) = 2xg+1 + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0 and bg \u0004= 0. (6.2b)\nThis curve is isomorphic to y2 = t(x), where t(x) is the 2-torsion polynomial, t(x) = \u2212xd+f(x)2\/4.\nAs we want C to be non-singular, we assume that t(x) has no multiple roots, and, in particular,\nthat b0 \u0004= 0.\nOn the curve (6.1) we have a rational point O = (0, 0) and the divisor d(O)\u2212 d(\u221e) is principal,\nnamely equal to div(y). There is also a \u2018reflected\u2019 d-torsion point O\u2032 = (0,\u2212f(0)), the image of O\nunder the hyperelliptic involution (x, y) \n\u2192 (x,\u2212y \u2212 f(x)).\nMoreover, every rational root \u03b1 of t(x) gives a rational 2-torsion point T\u03b1 = (\u03b1,\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2).\nAll of the pairwise differences of the points O, O\u2032, \u221e and the T\u03b1 are torsion divisors. So the results\nof \u00a7 4 apply and we get elements of KT2 (C)\/torsion, such as\n{\u221e, O, T\u03b1}, {\u221e, O,O\u2032}, {T\u03b1, T\u03b2 , T\u03b3}, . . . .\nIf we replace KT2 (C) with K\nT\n2 (CQ) then, by Remark 4.14, we can also use points T\u03b1 for any root\n\u03b1 \u2208 Q of the 2-torsion polynomial t(x), not necessarily rational. The following proposition gives\n350\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nrelations in KT2 (CQ) \u2297 Q among these elements. We mention that the two relations involving\n{\u221e, O,O\u2032} were first observed in computer calculations at the regulator level.\nProposition 6.3. Assume g \u0001 2, and let V be the Q-subspace of KT2 (CQ) \u2297 Q generated by\nthe elements of the form {Pi, Pj , Pk} where Pi, Pj , Pk run through the points \u221e, O,O\u2032 and the T\u03b1\nfor \u03b1 \u2208 Q a root of t(x). Then V is already generated by the elements of the form {\u221e, O, T\u03b1}.\nMore precisely, if we write d = 2g + \u03b5 with \u03b5 = 1 or 2, then we have the relations\n{\u221e, T\u03b1, T\u03b2} = 0,\n{\u221e, O, T\u03b1}+ {\u221e, O\u2032, T\u03b1} = 0\nand\n\u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032} =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\n{\u221e, O, T\u03b1},\ntogether with the symmetry properties of Proposition 4.3 and the tetrahedron relation of\nProposition 4.6.\nFurthermore, if f(0)2 = 1, then\n{\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x}\nis in KT2 (C), and its class M in K\nT\n2 (C)\/torsion satisfies\ndM = \u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032}.\nProof. The proof of the first relation was already given in Example 5.2. The other three relations\ninvolve {\u221e, O, T\u03b1}, {\u221e, O\u2032, T\u03b1} and {\u221e, O,O\u2032}. To make these elements explicit from the definitions\nin Construction 4.1 and Proposition 4.3 we need to determine the order d\u2032 of (O)\u2212(O\u2032) = 2(O)\u22122(\u221e)\nand the order d\u2032\u2032\u03b1 of (O)\u2212 (T\u03b1) = (T\u03b1)\u2212 (O\u2032) in Pic0(C).\nIn fact, we have\nd\u2032 = d\/\u03b5 and d\u2032\u2032\u03b1 = 2d\/\u03b5.\nNamely, if d = 2g + 1 then d\u2032 = d and if d = 2g + 2 then d\u2032 = d\/2. And if d = 2g + 1, then\n(O)\u2212 (T\u03b1) = [(O)\u2212 (\u221e)]\u2212 [(T\u03b1)\u2212 (\u221e)] must have order d\u2032\u2032\u03b1 = 2d, but if d = 2g + 2 the order can\nbe d or d\/2. However, it can be d\/2 = g + 1 only if (g +1)[(O)\u2212 (\u221e)] = (T\u03b1)\u2212 (\u221e) = (\u221e)\u2212 (T\u03b1),\nso that (g + 1)(O) + (T\u03b1)\u2212 (g + 2)(\u221e) is the divisor of some non-zero h in H0(C,OC((g + 2)\u221e)).\nAs g \u0001 2, g+2 \u0002 2g, so h lies in H0(C,OC (2g\u221e)), which has basis {1, x, . . . , xg} (cf. Example 5.3).\nHowever that implies that div(h) is invariant under the hyperelliptic involution whereas (g+1)(O)+\n(T\u03b1)\u2212 (g + 2)(\u221e) is not because O \u0004= O\u2032. So d\u2032\u2032\u03b1 = d\/2 is impossible.\nUsing those values of d\u2032 and d\u2032\u2032\u03b1 in the definitions we now see that\n{\u221e, O, T\u03b1} =\n{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1\n}\n,\n{\u221e, O\u2032, T\u03b1} =\n{ \u2212f(x)\u2212 y\n\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1\n} (6.4)\nand\n\u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032} =\n{\ny\n\u2212f(0) ,\ny + f(x)\nf(0)\n}\n,\nwhere we write elements in KT2 (CQ) for their classes in K\nT\n2 (CQ)\/torsion.\n351\nT.

This completes the proof of the third relation.\nFinally, if f(0)2 = 1, then all the tame symbols TP of {\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x} are trivial for P different\nfrom O = (0, 0), O\u2032 = (0,\u2212f(0)) and \u221e, and for those three points we find that\nT(0,0)({\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x}) = (\u22121)d\n\u2212f(0)y\n(\u2212x)d\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(0,0)\n= 1,\nT(0,\u2212f(0))({\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x}) = (\u22121)0\n\u2212f(0)y\n(\u2212x)0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(0,\u2212f(0))\n= f(0)2 = 1,\nT\u221e({\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x}) = 1.\nThe first equation uses that y(y+ f(x)) = \u2212xd, so that the function \u2212y\/xd equals 1\/(y+ f(x)) and\ntherefore assumes the value 1\/f(0) at (0, 0). The third equation follows from the first two and the\nproduct formula. Then (6.7) shows that\n2d{\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x} = {y2,\u2212xd} = 2\n{\ny\n\u2212f(0) ,\ny + f(x)\nf(0)\n}\nin KT2 (C), so that 2dM = 2\u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032} in KT2 (C)\/torsion. This finishes the proof.\n352\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nRemark 6.9. When g = 1, the statements of Proposition 6.3 still hold, but when d = 2g + 2 = 4,\nthe identity \u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032} =\u2211\u03b1{\u221e, O, T\u03b1} is replaced by\n2{\u221e, O,O\u2032} = {\u221e, O, T\u03b1}+ {\u221e, O, T\u03b1\u2032}+ 2{\u221e, O, T\u03b2},\nwhere T\u03b1, T\u03b1\u2032 and T\u03b2 are the points of order 2, and 2(O) \u2212 2(\u221e) = (T\u03b2) \u2212 (\u221e) in Pic0(CQ).\nThe proof is the same, using that\n2{\u221e, O,O\u2032} =\n{\ny\n\u2212f(0) ,\ny + f(x)\nf(0)\n}\n, {\u221e, O, T\u03b3} =\n{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b3)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b3\n\u2212\u03b3\n}\nfor \u03b3 = \u03b1 or \u03b1\u2032, but\n2{\u221e, O, T\u03b2} =\n{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b2)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b2\n\u2212\u03b2\n}\n,\nand similarly for O\u2032 instead of O in the last two identities. (Here again we write elements in KT2 (CQ)\nfor their classes in KT2 (CQ)\/torsion.) In (6.8) one takes 4{\u221e, O,O\u2032}\u22122{\u221e, O, T\u03b1}\u22122{\u221e, O, T\u03b1\u2032}\u2212\n4{\u221e, O, T\u03b2} as the left-hand side, whereas the right-hand side vanishes as before.\nNow we return from KT2 (CQ)\/torsion to K\nT\n2 (C)\/torsion, the group that we are interested in.\nHere we have elements {\u221e, O, T\u03b1}, where \u03b1 is a rational root of t(x), but, in fact, we have more.\nAs made explicit in (6.4), {\u221e, O, T\u03b1} is the class of an element of KT2 (C), namely{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1\n}\n.\n(If g = 1 and d = 4 this statement has to be slightly modified according to Remark 6.9.) If m(x) is\na rational factor of the 2-torsion polynomial t(x), then the element\u2211\nm(\u03b1)=0\n{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2 ,\nx\u2212 \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1\n}\n(where the sum is taken over the roots of m(x) in Q) in KT2 (CQ) can be shown to come from K\nT\n2 (C).\nHowever, if we multiply it by 2 and use (6.5), then, by a calculation similar to (6.6), we get explicitly\nthat\n2\n\u2211\nm(\u03b1)=0\n{\ny\n\u2212f(\u03b1)\/2 , 1\u2212\nx\n\u03b1\n}\n=\n{\ny2\nxd\n,\nm(x)\nm(0)\n}\n. (6.10)\nThis computation shows that we get an element of KT2 (C) for every rational irreducible factor m(x)\nof the 2-torsion polynomial t(x), not just for the linear ones. Thus, we get k explicit elements of\nKT2 (C)\/torsion, where k is the number of irreducible rational factors of the 2-torsion polynomial\nof the curve in (6.1). This gives a map from Zk to KT2 (C)\/torsion. In summary, we have the following\nconstruction.\nConstruction 6.11. Let C\/Q be given by (6.1), (6.2). Let m1, . . . ,mk be the irreducible factors\nin Q[x] (up to multiplication by Q\u2217) of the 2-torsion polynomial t(x) = \u2212xd + f(x)2\/4. To each of\nthem we associate an element of KT2 (C)\/torsion,\nMj = the class of\n{\ny2\nxd\n,\nmj(x)\nmj(0)\n}\n, 1 \u0002 j \u0002 k. (6.12)\nExtending by linearity gives a map\nZk \u2212\u2192 KT2 (C)\/torsion\n(n1, . . . , nk) \n\u2212\u2192\nk\u2211\nj=1\nnjMj = the class of\n{\ny2\nxd\n,\nk\u220f\nj=1\nmj(x)nj\nmj(0)nj\n}\n.\n(6.13)\n353\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nIn two special cases, the statement of Construction 6.11 can be refined a little. One case is when\nf(0)2 = 1, when we can use the class M of Proposition 6.3 to replace the Zk in (6.13) by a larger\nlattice of the same rank. The other situation occurs only if d = 2g+2, when it turns out that there\nis always a relation among the Mj (also originally discovered during calculations of the regulators)\nand hence the rank of the image is at most k \u2212 1.\nProposition 6.14. Let all notation be as in Construction 6.11.\n(1) If f(0) = \u00b11, then the class M in KT2 (C)\/torsion of {\u2212f(0)y,\u2212x} satisfies\n2dM =\nk\u2211\nj=1\nMj .\n(2) If d = 2g + 2, so that 4t(x) = (f(x)\u2212 2xg+1)(f(x) + 2xg+1), and\nf(x)\u2212 2xg+1 = m1 . . . ml, f(x) + 2xg+1 = ml+1 . . .mk\nwith mj irreducible, then the corresponding classes Mj satisfy\nM1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+Ml = Ml+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+Mk.\nProof. Relation (1) follows from the two identities involving \u03b5{\u221e, O,O\u2032} in Proposition 6.3, (6.4)\nand (6.10) (or the corresponding statements in Remark 6.9 if g = 1 and d = 4).\nIn order to prove relation (2), let H = \u2212y\/xg+1, so that H + 1\/H = f(x)\/xg+1. Then the\nrelation follows immediately from the fact that, in KT2 (C),{\ny2\nxd\n,\nf(x)\u2212 2xg+1\nf(x) + 2xg+1\n}\n=\n{\nH2,\nH \u2212 2 + 1\/H\nH + 2 + 1\/H\n}\n= 2\n{\nH,\n(1\u2212H)2\n(1 +H)2\n}\n= 4{H, 1 \u2212H} \u2212 4{\u2212H, 1 \u2212 (\u2212H)} = 0.\nRemark 6.15. If we identify K2(Q(C)) \u2297 Q with the Gal(Q\/Q)-invariants of K2(Q(C)) \u2297 Q as in\nRemark 4.14, and let W \u2286 K2(Q(C))\u2297 Q be as in Proposition 4.15 (with S = {\u221e, O,O\u2032, T\u03b11 , . . . ,\nT\u03b12g+1}, where \u03b11, . . . , \u03b12g+1 are the roots of t(x) in Q, and \u221e playing the role of P0), then we have\nthat\nW \u2229KT2 (C)\u2297Q = \u3008M1, . . . ,Mk\u3009Q,\nwhere the Mj are as in Construction 6.11, and \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009Q indicates the Q-vector space they generate.\nTherefore, the Mj give us everything in KT2 (C)\u2297Q that we can get from combinations of symbols\n{f, g} where f and g are in Q(C)\u2217 and div(f) and div(g) are supported in {\u221e, O,O\u2032, T\u03b11 , . . . ,\nT\u03b12g+1}.\nNamely, Proposition 4.15 shows that V = W \u2229KT2 (CQ)\u2297Q is spanned by the {\u221e, P,Q} where\nP and Q are in {O,O\u2032, T\u03b11 , . . . , T\u03b12g+1}, and by Proposition 6.3 and its proof those elements can be\nexpressed in the {\u221e, O, T\u03b1i} or the {y2\/xd, (x\u2212 \u03b1i)\/\u2212\u03b1i}. Therefore, if k = Q(\u03b11, . . . , \u03b12g+1), then\nthe action of Gal(Q\/Q) on V factors through Gal(k\/Q), and V Gal(Q\/Q) is generated by the elements\u2211\n\u03c3\u2208Gal(k\/Q)\n\u03c3\n({\ny2\nxd\n,\nx\u2212 \u03b1i\n\u2212\u03b1i\n})\n=\n\u2211\n\u03c3\u2208Gal(k\/Q)\n{\ny2\nxd\n,\nx\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b1i)\n\u2212\u03c3(\u03b1i)\n}\n= \u03b4i\n{\ny2\nxd\n,\nni(x)\nni(0)\n}\n,\nwhere ni(x) is the minimal polynomial of \u03b1i over Q and \u03b4i \u00b7 deg(ni(x)) = [k : Q]. As ni(x) is an\nirreducible rational factor of t(x), this equals \u03b4iMj for some j.\n7. Constructing good polynomials\nOur goal is to use Construction 6.11 to produce explicit families of hyperelliptic curves C with as\nmany elements of KT2 (C) as possible. This comes down to constructing polynomials of\nthe right form, which we will refer to as \u2018good\u2019 polynomials. This is addressed in this section.\n354\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nProblem 7.1. Construct (families of) polynomials of the form\nt(x) = \u2212xd + f(x)2\/4\nwhich have many rational factors and no multiple roots. Here d \u0001 5, and we want that t(x) has\ndegree d\u2212 1 for d even and degree d for d odd.\nRemark 7.2. To get potentially interesting examples for the Beilinson conjecture, we need at least\ng = genus(C) linearly independent elements of KT2 (C)\/torsion. Thus we want t(x) to have at\nleast g rational factors if d = 2g + 1 is odd and at least g + 1 of them if d = 2g + 2 is even\n(cf. Proposition 6.14(2)). Such a t(x) is what we will call a good polynomial.\nWe have seen in Examples 5.3 and 5.6 that, for our purposes, we might just as well consider, for\nc \u0004= 0,\nt(x) = cx2g+1 + f(x)2 where f(x) = bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b1x+ b0\nwhen d = 2g + 1, and\nt(x) = \u2212c2x2g+2 + f(x)2 where f(x) = cxg+1 + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0 with bg \u0004= 0\nwhen d = 2g + 2. It will be more convenient to use those non-normalized versions because we can\nsometimes let c play a role in the construction of such t(x).\nFor the remainder of this section we keep the notation c, d, t(x) and f(x) as above. For d = 5 and\n6 we will explain how to describe all such t(x) that factor completely over the rationals. For larger\ndegrees we will give sporadic examples that factor completely or nearly completely, and also infinite\nfamilies of good polynomials (with d = 2g + 2) for all genera g.\nOne way to produce good polynomials is to start with a general polynomial t(x) and force it to\nhave given rational roots. We illustrate this with one example.\nExample 7.3 (d = 5). Take\nt(x) = x5 + (b2x2 + b1x+ b0)2\nand force the quintic to have two rational roots, so that we get (at least) three rational factors.\nIf \u03b1 is a root of t(x), then \u2212\u03b15 is a square, so \u03b1 = \u2212r2 for some r \u2208 Q. We want t(x) to have\ntwo distinct rational roots \u2212m2 and \u2212n2, so\n\u2212m10 + (b2m4 \u2212 b1m2 + b0)2 = 0 and \u2212n10 + (b2n4 \u2212 b1n2 + b0)2 = 0.\nTaking roots yields\nm5 = b2m4 \u2212 b1m2 + b0 and n5 = b2n4 \u2212 b1n2 + b0.\n(We can take the positive signs by replacing m by \u2212m or n by \u2212n if necessary.) Solve this linear\nsystem for b0 and b1 and set b2 = (k + m2 + mn + n2)\/(m + n). Finally, multiply by (m + n)2 to\nobtain\n(m + n)2t(x) = (m + n)2x5 + ((k +m2 +mn+ n2)x2 + (km2 +m2n2 + kn2)x+ km2n2)2.\nThis is a family on three parameters m,n, k \u2208 Q although it gives only a two-dimensional fam-\nily of curves y2 = t(x): this equation is homogeneous of multi-degree (1, 1, 2, 2, 5) in (m,n, k, x, y),\nso letting m \n\u2192 \u03bbm, n \n\u2192 \u03bbn, k \n\u2192 \u03bb2k, gives a polynomial that corresponds to an\nisomorphic curve. Thus one can, for instance, assume that m,n, k are integers or instead that,\nsay, m = 1. Note that kmn \u0004= 0 (as otherwise the quintic has a double root \u03b1 = 0) and\nthat m \u0004= \u00b1n.\n355\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nRemark 7.4. We could also have forced t(x) to have a third rational root \u03b1 = \u2212l2. This condition\ngives a third linear equation for b0, b1 and b2. Then the system can be solved uniquely, producing\na three-parameter family of polynomials with four rational factors, which we do not write down\nhere. We have been unable to find additional examples in this family for which we could verify\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture, either because the coefficients were too large or because we did not obtain\nenough elements in K2(C;Z) of the corresponding curve C. In addition, there is a somewhat neater\nconstruction, which gives more rational roots.\nExample 7.5 (d = 5). In degree 5 it is in fact possible to describe the polynomials of the desired form\nthat factor completely over the rationals as follows. Recall from Example 7.3 that every rational\nroot of t(x) is of the form \u2212r2 for some rational r, so if t(x) factors completely then we must have\nt(x) = x5 + (b2x2 + b1x+ b0)2 =\n5\u220f\ni=1\n(x + r2i ).\nAssume that the |ri| are pairwise distinct and non-zero (otherwise t(x) has a double root). The two\nformulas for t(x) give two factorizations of \u2212t(\u2212x2), and hence\n(x5 + b2x4 \u2212 b1x2 + b0)(x5 \u2212 b2x4 + b1x2 \u2212 b0) =\n5\u220f\ni=1\n(x\u2212 ri)\n5\u220f\ni=1\n(x + ri).\nCall the two quintics on the left q(x) and \u2212q(\u2212x) respectively. Clearly, in every pair \u00b1ri one of the\nnumbers is a root of q(x) and the other a root of q(\u2212x). By changing the signs of some of the ri if\nnecessary, we can assume that all of them are roots of q(x). As the quintic q(x) has no x3 and x\nterms, Newton\u2019s formulas imply that the numbers si = r\u22121i satisfy the two equations\n5\u2211\ni=1\nsi = 0 and\n5\u2211\ni=1\ns3i = 0. (7.6)\nConversely, any 5-tuple {si} of non-zero rationals satisfying (7.6) and such that si \u0004= \u00b1sj for i \u0004= j\ngives rise to t(x) =\n\u220f\n(x + s\u22122i ) of the desired form. Note that the tuple {\u2212si} gives the same\npolynomial.\nNow in order to find rational solutions of (7.6), note that these equations define a cubic surface\nin P4. So given two rational solutions to (7.6), the line joining them intersects the surface in a third\npoint that is also rational. Thus, starting with some obvious solutions such as (a,\u2212a, b,\u2212b, 0) and\nits permutations or some other experimentally found small solutions such as\n(1, 5,\u22127,\u22128, 9), (2, 4,\u22127,\u22129, 10), (1, 14,\u221217,\u221218, 20), . . . (7.7)\none can construct as many other solutions as one wants by using this \u2018chord construction\u2019 and by\nscaling and permuting the coordinates.\nRemark 7.8. The surface defined by (7.6) is the famous cubic surface of Clebsch and Klein, which\nalso occurs as a Hilbert modular surface and was studied in detail in [Hir87]. It might be worth\ninvestigating why this surface shows up in this context.\nExample 7.9 (d even). Finally, here is a method to produce examples for even d = 2m. First, if\nt(x) = \u2212c2x2m + f(x)2\/4 = (cxm + f(x)\/2)(f(x)\/2 \u2212 cxm) (7.10)\nwith f(x) = 2cxm + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b0 and cbg \u0004= 0, then we could take the first factor to be of the form\n2c(x \u2212 ai) . . . (x \u2212 am), which gives us at least m + 1 rational factors of t(x). In order to get more\nrational factors, it is easier to put f\u02dc(x) = xmf(1\/x), so that, with g(x) = f\u02dc(x)\/2 + c and k = 2c,\nx2mt(1\/x) = f\u02dc(x)2\/4\u2212 c2 = g(x)(g(x) \u2212 k), (7.11)\n356\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nand the problem simply becomes finding polynomials g(x) and non-zero constants k such that\ng(x) and g(x)\u2212 k have no multiple roots and a lot of rational factors. Strictly speaking, we should\nalso ensure that (7.11) has no constant term and a non-zero linear term, so that (7.10) is of degree\n2m \u2212 1, a condition which has to be satisfied to get the correct shape of t(x). However, this can\nalways be achieved by a translation if there is a rational root.\nScaling g(x) and k does not change our problem, so we can assume g(x) has leading coefficient 1.\nIf we choose g(x) = (x \u2212 b1) . . . (x \u2212 bm) we get a family of good polynomials with at least m + 1\nrational factors, having b1, . . . , bm and k as parameters. Now the question is how to improve this by\nforcing a polynomial of the form\ng(x)\u2212 k = (x\u2212 b1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (x\u2212 bm)\u2212 k\nto have more rational factors. If we choose k =\n\u220f\n(\u2212bi), then g(x) \u2212 k has a factor x, so we get a\nfamily with at least m+2 rational factors, namely x, x\u2212 b1, . . . , x\u2212 bm and the remaining factor of\ndegree m\u2212 1.\nFor d = 6 (m = 3) this remaining factor is quadratic. So with a suitable rational parametrization\none can construct a \u2018universal\u2019 family of polynomials that factor completely over the rationals.\nOne example of such a family is given by\ng(x) = (x\u2212 1)(x\u2212 r \u2212 s)(x\u2212 rs),\nk = rs(r \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1),\ng(x)\u2212 k = (x\u2212 r)(x\u2212 s)(x\u2212 rs\u2212 1).\nFor larger degrees, examples can be found as follows. Without loss of generality we may assume\nthat b1, . . . , bm are integers. Choose bounds B,C and search through all integers \u2212B \u0002 b1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 <\nbm \u0002 B. Let g(x) = (x \u2212 b1) . . . (x \u2212 bm) and compute g(\u2212C), . . . , g(C \u2212 1), g(C). If a number\nk \u0004= 0 occurs more than once in this list of values, then g(x) \u2212 k has several integral roots in the\nrange from \u2212C to C, each of which yields one linear factor. This gives a simple method to look for\npolynomials (7.11) with even more rational roots.\nWe now give a few examples with m = 4 and 5 where both g(x) and g(x)\u2212 k factor completely,\nsorted according to k. The columns in Table 1(a) below contain k, the roots of g(x) and the roots\nof g(x)\u2212 k, respectively.\nOne should note here that such a search produces many more examples than just those in\nTable 1(a). The tables actually start as in Table 1(b), but most of the examples are induced in the\nsense that, modulo a linear substitution, p(x) = g(x)(g(x) \u2212 k) is of the form q(x2) for some q(x)\nof degree m. For instance, for the first entry for m = 4 (k = 180) we have\np(x) = (x\u2212 5)(x\u2212 4)(x + 3)(x + 4) \u00b7 (x\u2212 6)(x \u2212 2)(x + 1)(x + 5)\nand, after rearranging the factors, we find that\np(\u2212x+ 12) = (x\u2212 112 )(x\u2212 92)(x\u2212 72)(x\u2212 32)(x + 32)(x + 72)(x + 92)(x + 112 )\n= x8 \u2212 65x6 + 10979\n8\nx4 \u2212 164 385\n16\nx2 +\n4322 241\n256\n.\nThe curve y2 = t(x) is therefore a cover of an elliptic curve y2 = x4 \u2212 65x3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . In the same way,\nthe first two lines for m = 5 simply come from genus 2 curves, which we have already seen in the\ncubic surface construction: they are given by the first two 5-tuples in (7.7).\nFinally, for m = 6 (g = 5, d = 12) one can easily find several non-trivial examples where\ng(x)(g(x) \u2212 k) factors completely except for one quadratic factor. It is harder to find non-trivial\n357\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nTable 1.

The problem of finding (very) good polynomials as in Example 7.9 is\nclosely related to the famous problem of Prouhet\u2013Tarry\u2013Escott about finding distinct collections\nof integers, {a1, . . . , am} and {b1, . . . , bm}, with ai1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + aim = bi1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + bim for i = 1, . . . ,m \u2212\n1, as then\n\u220f\ni(x \u2212 ai) \u2212\n\u220f\ni(x \u2212 bi) is a non-zero integer. We refer the reader to \u2018The Prouhet\u2013\nTarry\u2013Escott problem revisited \u2019 by Borwein and Ingalls [BI94] or to the website of Chen Shuwen\n(http:\/\/euler.free.fr\/eslp\/eslp.htm) for surveys of known results on this problem. In particular, the\nlatter contains \u2018non-symmetric\u2019 solutions (corresponding to non-induced in the sense above) up\nto m = 8, better than the m = 6 example above. However, it seems that the examples for the\nProuhet\u2013Tarry\u2013Escott problem never satisfy the integrality condition in K-theory that we will\nneed (see Theorem 8.3) in our application, so that we do not discuss this any further.\nWe would like to thank Laurent Habsieger and Chris Smyth for pointing out this connection\nand providing the above references.\n8. Integrality of the elements\nConstruction 6.11 shows how to construct hyperelliptic curves C\/Q with elements in KT2 (C)\/torsion.\nHowever, we are not yet in a position to compute regulators and test Beilinson\u2019s Conjecture 3.11,\nbecause we still need our elements to be integral, that is, to lie in K2(C;Z) \u2286 KT2 (C)\/torsion\n(see (3.7)).\n358\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nLet C\/Z be a regular proper model of C\/Q. Recall that an element \u03b1 of K2(Q(C)) lies in KT2 (C)\nif the tame symbol TP (\u03b1) is trivial for all P \u2208 C(Q). Recall also that \u03b1 lies in KT2 (C) if the tame\nsymbol is trivial for each irreducible curve D in C; see (3.5) or (3.9). This means that apart from\nbeing trivial for \u2018horizontal\u2019 curves (which come from points P \u2208 C(Q)), the tame symbol of \u03b1\nmust be trivial for all irreducible components of the fibers Cp of C \u2192 SpecZ. This gives additional\nconditions on \u03b1 for all primes p of Z. (However, one can show that, to a given \u03b1, one can always\nadd an element in K2(Q) such that the sum satisfies this condition for each prime p for which the\nfiber Cp is smooth over Fp.)\nSo, in general, given a curve C\/Q and \u03b1 \u2208 KT2 (C) the way to verify that \u03b1 gives rise to an\nelement of K2(C;Z) is to find a regular model C\/Z and then check that the tame symbol of \u03b1\nat each \u2018vertical\u2019 curve on C is trivial. In practice, finding such a model means starting with any\nequation of C with integer coefficients, which defines an arithmetic surface, and performing blow-ups\nuntil we obtain a regular surface. This, however, is a complicated process, so we will try to deduce\nintegrality from the behavior of \u03b1 on the original (possibly singular) arithmetic surface.\nThis can be done in fair generality for the families of examples that we are interested in.\nWe repeat our notation for the sake of easy reference, so we consider a curve of genus g as\nin Construction 6.11, defined by\ny2 + f(x)y + xd = 0 (8.1)\nin one of the two cases\nd = 2g + 1, f(x) = bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x+ b0; (8.2a)\nd = 2g + 2, f(x) = 2xg+1 + bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b1x+ b0 and bg \u0004= 0, (8.2b)\nwhere t(x) = \u2212xd + f(x)2\/4 has no multiple roots, so that in particular b0 \u0004= 0. Assume further\nthat f(x) has integer coefficients, so (8.1) defines an arithmetic surface over Z.\nTheorem 8.3. Let C\/Q be defined by (8.1) and (8.2), where b0, . . . , bg are integers. Let m(x) \u2208 Z[x]\nbe a non-constant factor, irreducible over Z, of the 2-torsion polynomial t(x) = \u2212xd + f(x)2\/4 and\nlet M be the class of {\ny2\nxd\n,\nm(x)\nm(0)\n}\n,\nin KT2 (C)\/torsion. We have:\n(1) if m(0) = \u00b11 then M \u2208 K2(C;Z);\n(2) if there is a prime dividing m(0) but not every bi then nM \u0004\u2208 K2(C;Z) for any n \u0004= 0.\nMoreover;\n(3) if b0 = \u00b11 and M is as in Proposition 6.3, then M is in K2(C;Z) if d = 2g + 1 and 2M is in\nK2(C;Z) if d = 2g + 2.\nProof. Denote\nM\u02dc = {f1, f2}, f1 = y\n2\nxd\n, f2 =\nm(x)\nm(0)\n;\nthen M\u02dc is an element of KT2 (C) (see (6.10)) and M is its class in K\nT\n2 (C)\/torsion. We shall show\nthat, for a specific regular proper model C of C, M\u02dc \u2208 KT2 (C) if m(0) = \u00b11, so that M \u2208 K2(C;Z).\nHowever, for the same model, we shall show that under the assumptions of part (2), TD(M\u02dc) is not\ntorsion for some irreducible component D of the fiber Cp. Therefore, no non-zero multiple of M can\nlie in K2(C;Z) \u2286 KT2 (C)\/torsion, because, up to torsion, KT2 (C) is a subgroup of KT2 (C) that does\nnot depend on the choice of C. Finally, for part (3) we show that {\u2212b0y,\u2212x} or 2{\u2212b0y,\u2212x} is in\nKT2 (C).\n359\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nBefore we can give the proof proper, we need some preliminaries.\nLet p be a prime and F the fiber above p of the arithmetic surface defined by (8.1). It is clear\nfrom the equation that any irreducible component D of F dominates the x-axis and that x, y and\nm(x) define rational functions on D that do not vanish identically on it.\nWe want to know that if p does not divide every bi, then the function y2\/xd is non-constant on\nevery suchD. If it were constant, then y2 = kxd on D for some constant k \u0004= 0. So f(x)y = \u2212(k+1)xd\non D and squaring this equation yields f(x)2kxd = (k + 1)2x2d. As D dominates the x-axis, this is\nonly possible if this is an identity of polynomials, which implies that bgxg + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b0 = 0 mod p,\ncontradicting the assumption on the bi.\nLet C\/Z be the regular model of C\/Q obtained from the arithmetic surface defined by (8.1) by\nrepeatedly blowing up the singularities. If D \u2282 C is an irreducible curve mapping onto D, then the\nfunction f1 = y2\/xd is also non-constant along D.\nWe are now ready to prove part (2). Let p divide m(0) but not every bi. Let D and D be as\nabove, so that vD(f1) = 0 and vD(f2) < 0. Then the tame symbol TD(M\u02dc) is a non-zero power of f1\nand is therefore non-constant and hence non-torsion.\nWe now move to the proof of part (1) so we assume that m(0) = \u00b11. Then for any prime p\nand irreducible component D of Cp surjecting onto a component D of the fiber above p of (8.1),\nvD(f1) = vD(f2) = 0, hence TD(M\u02dc ) = 1.\nHowever, this does not prove that vD(f1) = vD(f2) = 0 for every component D of the fiber of\nC \u2192 SpecZ above p: such a D could also map to a singular point of the model (8.1). In this case if,\nsay, f1 happens to have a zero or a pole passing just through this point, then it can happen that\nvD(f1) \u0004= 0.\nWe claim that at every singular point P of the surface defined by (8.1) either f1 or f2 is regular\nand equal to 1. This implies that TD(M\u02dc) = 1 for every irreducible curve D of C mapping to P ,\nproving part (1).\nIn fact, our claim holds for all singular points in the fiber F of (8.1) above a prime p, among\nwhich are those singularities of C that lie above p. In order to see this, first consider the point at\ninfinity in F . The arithmetic surface defined by (8.1) has a chart at infinity that can be obtained\nby letting x = 1\/x\u02dc and y = y\u02dc\/x\u02dcg+1. So for d = 2g + 1, the equation at infinity is\ny\u02dc2 + (bgx\u02dc+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b1x\u02dcg + b0x\u02dcg+1)y\u02dc + x\u02dc = 0\nand the point at infinity in F (x\u02dc = y\u02dc = 0 mod p) is non-singular. If d = 2g+2, then the equation is\ny\u02dc2 + (2 + bgx\u02dc + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + b1x\u02dcg + b0x\u02dcg+1)y\u02dc + 1 = 0\nand the function f1 = y\u02dc2 is regular and equal to 1 at the point at infinity, (x\u02dc, y\u02dc) = (0,\u22121) mod p.\nFor finite x, if P = (x0, y0) mod p is a singularity of F , then f(x0) = \u22122y0. Then either x0 \u0004= 0,\nin which case f1 is regular and equal to 1 at P from the equation of the curve, or x0 = 0, in which\ncase f2 is regular and equal to 1 at P because p does not divide m(0). This completes the proof of\npart (1).\nFor part (3), assume that b0 = \u00b11, so that M is the class in KT2 (C)\/torsion of the element\n{\u2212b0y,\u2212x} in KT2 (C). As above, there can only be a problem at a singular point of the arithmetic\nsurface defined by (8.1), and that point is a singularity on the fiber F above some prime p. However,\nif P = (x0, y0) modulo p is any finite singularity of F , then 2y0 + f(x0) = 0, hence y20 = x\nd\n0.\nWe cannot have (x0, y0) = (0, 0) since this would give \u00b11 = b0 = f(x0) = \u22122y0 = 0. Therefore\nneither \u2212b0y = \u2213y nor \u2212x can have a zero or a pole passing through P , showing that those functions\nhave trivial valuation along any irreducible curve D in C mapping to P . For d = 2g + 1 we saw\nbefore that the point at infinity of F is non-singular, so that M is in K2(C;Z). For d = 2g + 2\n360\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nwe consider instead the class 2M of 2{\u2212b0y,\u2212x} = {y2, x} = {y2\/x2g+2, x} = {y\u02dc2, 1\/x\u02dc}, and at the\npoint at infinity of F , (x\u02dc, y\u02dc) = (0,\u22121) modulo p, y\u02dc2 is regular and equal to 1.\nRemark 8.4. We cannot drop the assumption in Theorem 8.3(2) that the prime does not divide\neach bi, i.e. the unrestricted converse of Theorem 8.3(1) does not hold. In fact, given m(x) as in the\ntheorem with m(0) = \u00b11, so that the corresponding M is in K2(C;Z), fix a prime p and a positive\ninteger s. Then the substitution (x, y) \n\u2192 (p\u22122sx, p\u2212dsy) transforms C into an isomorphic curve C\u02dc\ndefined by\ny2 + f\u02dc(x)y + xd = 0,\nwhere f\u02dc(x) = pdsf(p\u22122sx) so that all b\u02dci are divisible by p. Choosing k \u0001 0 minimally such that\nm\u02dc(x) = pkm(p\u22122sx) is in Z[x], m\u02dc(x) is irreducible in Z[x] and is a non-constant factor of the 2-torsion\npolynomial \u2212xd+ f\u02dc(x)2\/4 = p2dst(p\u22122sx). We can ensure that k > 0 by choosing s sufficiently large,\nso that p divides m\u02dc(0). Then the class of {y2\/xd, m\u02dc(x)\/m\u02dc(0)} is in K2(C\u02dc;Z) as it corresponds to M ,\nbut p divides m\u02dc(0) as well as each b\u02dci.\n9. Computing the Beilinson regulator\nLet C be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g over C, so the map \u03c6 : C \u2192 P1C has n = 2g + 2 points of\nramification, P1, . . . , Pn, and let X = C(C) be the associated Riemann surface. It is not difficult to\ncheck that a basis of H1(X;Z) consists of liftings to X of simple loops in P1C around exactly Pi and\nPi+1, for i = 1, . . . , 2g. If a model of C is defined by an equation y2 = f(x) with f(x) in C[x] of\ndegree 2g + 1 without multiple roots, then the point in C above the point at infinity in this model\nwill be among the ramification points, and the others will be the points above the roots of f(x) in\nC \u2282 P1C. We therefore work with simple loops in C around exactly two roots of f(x), not passing\nthrough any root of f(x), and lift them to loops on X.\nIn our case f(x) belongs to Q[x] and hence to R[x], and we want to keep track of the action of\ncomplex conjugation c on X. We will discuss the case when the leading coefficient of f(x) is positive,\nwhich we can always achieve by replacing x with \u2212x if necessary. The set C(R) of real points on X\nconsists of \u221eC together with the points above those x in R \u2282 C where f(x) \u0001 0. In Figure 1, the\nlatter is indicated by the thick part of R in C, the thick dots being the roots of f(x).\nIf f(x) has only real roots P1 < P2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < P2g+1, then let \u03b3i be a lift of a loop around P2i and\nP2i+1 (i = 1, . . . , g) (this is illustrated in Figure 1(a)), and let \u03b4i be a lift of a loop around P2i\u22121\nand P2i (i = 1, . . . , g). As all of the \u03b3i have a fixed point under the action of complex conjugation,\nwhich lies above the intersection with the thick part of the real line, it is easy to check that the \u03b3i\nlie in H1(X;Z)\u2212 because complex conjugation reverses the orientation. Also, by shrinking the \u03b4i as\nmuch as possible, so that they lift to a subset of C(R), it is easy to see that the \u03b4i lie in H1(X;Z)+.\nSo in this case H1(X;Z) decomposes as a direct sum H1(X;Z)\u2212 \u2295H1(X;Z)+, the \u03b3i form a basis\nof H1(X;Z)\u2212, and the \u03b4i form a basis of H1(X;Z)+.\nIf f(x) does not have only real roots, let P1, . . . , P2m+1 be the real roots of f(x), and let\nQ1, Q1, . . . , Qg\u2212m, Qg\u2212m be its non-real roots, as pairs of complex conjugated numbers with\nIm(Qj) > 0. We now define \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3m as lifts of simple loops around P2 and P3, P4 and P5,\n. . . , P2m and P2m+1, and \u03b3m+1, . . . , \u03b3g as lifts of simple loops around Q1 and Q1, Q2 and Q2, etc.,\nintersecting the thick part of the real axis as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Then it is easy to check\nthat \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3g are in H1(X;Z)\u2212. Also, if \u03b41, . . . , \u03b4g are lifts to X of simple loops around P1 and\nP2, . . . , P2m\u22121 and P2m, as well as around P2m+1 and Q1, Q1 and Q2, Q2 and Q3, etc., then the\n\u03b4j complement the \u03b3j to a basis of H1(X;Z). Note that in Figure 2(a) we still have c \u25e6 \u03b4\u2032 = \u03b4\u2032 as\nin the case when f(x) has only real roots, but we do not get a splitting of H1(X;Z) into positive\nand negative parts. Namely, if \u03b4 is the lift of a loop around P2m+1 and Q1, and \u03b3 is the lift of\na loop around Q1 and Q1 passing through the thick part of the real line to the right of P2m+1,\n361\nT.

If we could write \u03b4 = \u03b4+ + \u03b4\u2212 with\n\u03b4\u00b1 in H1(X;Z)\u00b1, then this would lead to 2\u03b4\u2212 = \u03b4 \u2212 c \u25e6 \u03b4 = \u03b3, which is not possible as \u03b3 is part of\na basis of H1(X;Z). In summary we find in this case that {\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3g} is a basis of H1(X;Z)\u2212, and\nthat {\u03b41, . . . , \u03b4g} is a basis of H1(X;Z)\/H1(X;Z)\u2212.\nFor practical purposes, we choose all our loops in C as concatenations of line segments, which\nmakes computing and parametrizing their lifts to X using the analytic continuation of square roots\nparticularly easy. Apart from the two types already described (lifts of a simple loop around two\nconsecutive real roots of f(x), or of a simple loop around two conjugate non-real roots of f(x)\nintersecting the thick part of the real line, both illustrated in Figure 1), we also use a third type\nin order to avoid getting close to roots of f(x) unnecessarily, thus speeding up the calculations in\nnumerical integration. If, for example, Q1 = x1 + iy1 and Q2 = x2 + iy2 are two non-real roots of\nf(x) that are close together and 0 < y1 \u0002 y2, then, keeping a lift of a loop around the pair Q1, Q1\nmeeting the thick part of the real line, we can replace a lift of a loop around the pair Q2, Q2 with a\nloop around both pairs Q1, Q1, Q2, Q2, still meeting the thick part of the real line, as indicated in\nFigure 2(b). This is just the sum of (compatible) lifts of a loop around Q1, Q1 and a loop around\nQ2, Q2, both meeting the thick part of the real line in a common point. A similar method is used if\nmore than two non-real roots of f(x) are close together.\n362\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nFinally, we choose our loops also such that they do not pass through the image of the\nother torsion point under the map \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1C. In this way, we can immediately compute\n\u3008\u03b3, {a, b}\u3009 = (1\/2\u03c0) \u222b\u03b3 \u03b7(a, b), with \u03b7(a, b) as in (3.3), and integrate numerically over the lifts of\nthe paths using the analytic continuation of y =\n\u221a\nf(x) along the paths. The method works quite\nwell in practice and we can easily obtain 12 or 15 decimals of precision for the regulator.\n10. Examples\nIn this section we test Beilinson\u2019s Conjecture 3.11 as explained in Remark 3.13. We do this for\nhyperelliptic curves over Q, of genus 2, 3, 4 and 5. Using the results of \u00a7 7, we construct curves of the\nform (8.1) and (8.2) whose 2-torsion polynomials have many rational factors. As Construction 6.11\nshows, every such rational factor gives an element of KT2 (C)\/torsion. Theorem 8.3 shows which of\nthese are in K2(C;Z).\nOur main sources of examples are the constructions described in Examples 7.3 and 7.9\n(or variations of them). Unfortunately, the more sophisticated constructions of Examples 7.4 and 7.5\ntend to produce either not enough symbols satisfying the integrality condition or else curves of very\nhigh conductor for which we cannot compute the L-value.\nExample 10.1 (genus 2). Taking m = 1 and n = \u22122 in Example 7.3 yields a one-parameter family\nof curves\ny2 = x5 + ((k + 3)x2 + (5k + 4)x + 4k)2.\nFurther, if k is an integer which is divisible by 4, then the curve can be transformed to one of the\nform in Theorem 8.3. Thus, write k = \u22124b with b \u2208 Z. The curve is then isomorphic to\nCb : y2 + ((4b\u2212 3)x2 \u2212 (5b\u2212 1)x + b)y + x5 = 0.\nFor non-zero b this is a non-singular genus 2 curve of discriminant\n\u2206(Cb) = 32b7(8b + 3)2(9b3 \u2212 23b2 + 4b\u2212 1).\nIts 2-torsion polynomial has three rational factors, namely (up to a constant)\nm1 = x\u2212 1,\nm2 = 4x\u2212 1,\nm3 = x3 \u2212 (4b2 \u2212 6b + 1)x2 + (5b2 \u2212 b)x\u2212 b2.\nRecall from Construction 6.11 that each mi gives an element Mi \u2208 KT2 (C)\/torsion. Intersecting the\nlattice in KT2 (C)\/torsion which they span with K2(C;Z) we obtain a sublattice of integral elements,\n\u039bM = \u3008M1,M2,M3\u3009 \u2229K2(C;Z).\nUsing Theorem 8.3 we can determine \u039bM exactly by inspecting the constant terms of the mi. We find\nthat \u039bM = \u3008M1,M2,M3\u3009 for b = \u00b11 and \u039bM = \u3008M1,M2\u3009 otherwise.\nWe can now test Beilinson\u2019s conjecture for this family. We constructed at least two elements\n(M1 and M2) of \u039bM and we might generally expect them to be linearly independent. If this is the\ncase, \u039bM should be a subgroup of finite index in K2(C;Z), which is supposed to have rank 2 by\nthe first part of Beilinson\u2019s Conjecture 3.11. The second part would then imply that R(\u039bM ), the\nregulator computed using a basis of \u039bM , is a non-zero rational multiple of L\u2217(Cb, 0), the leading\ncoefficient of L(Cb, s) at s = 0. In summary, we expect:\n(a) rkZ\u039bM = 2;\n(b) R(\u039bM ) = QL\u2217(Cb, 0) for some Q \u2208 Q\u2217.\n363\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nTable 2.

Let us illustrate the latter point\nin the case b = \u22121. We can compute the images of the Mi under the regulator pairing (3.10), as\nexplained in \u00a7 9,\n\u03b1 \n\u2212\u2192 (\u3008\u03b31, \u03b1\u3009, \u3008\u03b32, \u03b1\u3009) \u2208 R2, (10.2)\nwhere \u03b31 and \u03b32 form a basis of H1(X;Z)\u2212. As we expect the image to be a lattice of rank 2,\nthere should be some integral linear combination of the Mi for which the image in R2 vanishes.\nUsing LLL to look for a small Z-relation between the images in R2, we find that\n41M1 + 56M2 \u2212 44M3 ?\n\u2212\u2192 (0, 0). (10.3)\nTo make the relation more transparent we complete the vector (41, 56,\u221244) to a unimodular integral\nmatrix and make the corresponding change of basis:\uf8eb\n\uf8edM\u22171M\u22172\nM\u22173\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 0 111 15 0\n41 56 \u221244\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edM1M2\nM3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\nThe numerical values of the regulator pairing (10.2) on the Mi and the M\u2217i are then given by\nTable 2. This strongly suggests that M\u22173 is in the kernel of (10.2), in which case M\u22173 should be zero\nin \u039bM by Beilinson\u2019s conjecture. The regulator R(\u039bM ) is now obtained as the absolute value of the\ndeterminant of the 2\u00d7 2 matrix that consists of the two columns for M\u22171 and M\u22172 :\nR(\u039bM ) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22128.191 279 \u221296.549 3521.915 254 22.630 553\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 0.456 625.\nNumerically, L\u2217(C\u22121, 0) \u2248 0.228 312, so L\u2217(C\u22121, 0)\/R(\u039bM ) \u2248 0.500 000, which we \u2018recognize\u2019 as the\nrational number 1\/2. (Here the agreement is to at least 18 digits, which was our working precision\nin this example.)\nRecall from Theorem 8.3 that for b = \u00b11 the class M of {\u2212by,\u2212x} also lies in K2(C;Z) and\nsatisfies 10M = M1 + M2 + M3 by (1) of Proposition 6.14. For b = \u22121, we can write this as\n10M = \u2212175M\u22171 + 15M\u22172 \u2212 4M\u22173 , so if we assume M\u22173 = 0, then 2M = \u221235M\u22171 + 3M\u22172 is in \u039bM\nbut M is not. In other words, the larger lattice \u039b = \u3008M1,M2,M3,M\u3009 in K2(C;Z) contains \u039bM as\na sublattice of index 2 and\nL\u2217(C\u22121, 0)\/R(\u039b) = 1.000 000 . . .\n?= 1.\nTable 3 summarizes the computations for the curves Cb with |b| \u0002 10. In the third column we\ndescribe the lattice \u039b that we use, and the last column contains the quotient of L\u2217(Cb, 0) and the\nBeilinson regulator R(\u039b). In all cases this quotient appears to be a rational number of relatively\nsmall height. For b = \u00b11 we also include the expected relation between the Mi. (We have not\nincluded the universal relation 10M = M1 +M2 +M3 because similar relations would clog up later\ntables.)\nFinally, we remark that the Jacobian of each of the curves appearing in Table 3, except for\nb = 1, is not isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves, even over Q. This was verified using the\nprocedure of [CF96, ch. 14, \u00a7 4]. In other words, the elements in K-theory and the L-values do not\n364\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nTable 3.

In all of the following examples we keep the same notation as above. For a curve\nC : y2 + f(x)y + xd = 0\nas in (8.1) and (8.2), denote by mi the rational factors of the 2-torsion polynomial t(x) = \u2212xd +\nf(x)2\/4. The associated elements of KT2 (C)\/torsion (see (6.12)) are denoted by Mi. Using M or 2M\n365\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D.

In all of the examples below we can\ndetermine \u039b by applying Theorem 8.3. Then we verify numerically that \u039b has rank equal to the\ngenus of C and that the leading coefficient L\u2217(C, 0) is a rational multiple of the regulator R(\u039b)\nof \u039b. To keep the entries for \u039b simple, we did not include the universal relation between M and the\nMi of Proposition 6.14(1) in the tables.\nExample 10.5 (genus 2). We can construct another family of genus 2 curves with enough elements\nin K2(C;Z) in a way similar to Example 7.9, this time using 6-torsion points. The curves are given\nby\ny2 + (2x3 \u2212 4bx2 \u2212 x + b)y + x6 = 0, b \u2208 Z>0.\nThe 2-torsion polynomial has four rational factors,\nm1 = x\u2212 b, m2 = 2x\u2212 1, m3 = 2x + 1, m4 = 4bx2 + x\u2212 b,\nso we get four elements of KT2 (C)\/torsion, again denoted by M1,M2,M3,M4. According to Proposi-\ntion 6.14(2) these satisfy the relation M1+M2+M3 = M4, so M4 can be dropped. Furthermore, M2\nand M3 are always integral, and M1 is for b = 1. The numerical results, and the expected relation\nbetween the Mi when b = 1, are given in Table 4.\nExample 10.6 (genus 3). We can look at hyperelliptic genus 3 curves with a rational 7-torsion point\nand whose 2-torsion polynomial has two given rational roots (cf. Example 7.3).

The 2-torsion polynomial has three rational factors,\nm1 = x\u2212 1,\nm2 = 4x\u2212 1,\nm3 = x5 \u2212 (4b2 \u2212 6b+ 1)x4 + (5b2 + 8ab\u2212 2b\u2212 6a)x3 \u2212 (b2 + 10ab + 4a2 \u2212 2a)x2\n+ (5a2 + 2ab)x\u2212 a2.\nFor a = \u00b11 and b \u2208 Z we thus get three integral symbols and we expect a relation with L\u2217(C, 0).\nMoreover, for a = 1, b = 3 we have a further factorization\nm3 = m3,1m3,2 = (x2 \u2212 3x+ 1)(x3 \u2212 16x2 + 8x\u2212 1),\nso we get four elements of K2(C;Z) and we expect them to be linearly dependent.

These can be found by a brute search for good polynomials with\nenough factors in Z[x] with constant term \u00b11. In all cases that we found, we have exactly g+1 such\nfactors and the lattice \u039b = \u3008M1, . . . ,Mg, 2M\u3009 is of rank g. The examples and the corresponding\nnumerical results are given in Tables 6 and 7.\n367\nT. Dokchitser, R. de Jeu and D. Zagier\nExample 10.8 (arbitrary genus). Finally, we give examples of curves of arbitrary genus g with g\nintegral symbols. Consider a curve of the form\ny2 +\n(\n2xg+1 \u00b1\ng\u220f\nj=1\n(vjx+ 1)\n)\ny + x2g+2 = 0, (10.9)\nwhere v1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < vg are distinct non-zero integers, and we are assuming that the 2-torsion polyno-\nmial t(x) has no multiple roots. Then t(x) has at least g + 1 factors in Z[x],\nv1x+ 1, v2x+ 1, . . . , vgx+ 1, 4xg+1 \u00b1\ng\u220f\nj=1\n(vjx+ 1). (10.10)\n(This is similar to, but different from, the discussion in Example 7.9 because now, in 4t(x) =\n\u22124x2g+2+f(x)2 = (f(x)\u22122xg+1)(2xg+1+f(x)), we decompose the first factor, which has degree g,\nrather than the second factor, which has degree g+1, completely into linear factors.) The elements\nMj associated with all irreducible factors in Z[x] are integral by Theorem 8.3, so we get at least\ng + 1 elements of K2(C;Z), but we have to take Proposition 6.14(2) into account.\nAn equation of the form (10.9) is not unique for a given curve. For even g, we may (and will)\nassume that the sign \u2018\u00b1\u2019 in (10.9) is \u2018+\u2019, as otherwise we can replace (x, y, {vj}) with (\u2212x,\u2212y,\n{\u2212vg+1\u2212j}). On the other hand, for odd g the map (x, y) \n\u2192 (\u2212x, y) gives an isomorphism between\nthe two curves with the same sign associated with {vj} and {\u2212vg+1\u2212j}.\nAlso, if we look at the model at infinity by letting y \n\u2192 y\/xg+1 and x \n\u2192 1\/x, the equation\nbecomes\ny2 +\n(\n2\u00b1 x\ng\u220f\nj=1\n(x + vj)\n)\ny + 1 = 0.\nNow it is clear that translating x by \u2212vj for some j gives an equation of the same shape. In other\nwords, {vj} and {wj} yield an isomorphic curve whenever {vj} \u222a {0} is a translate of {wj} \u222a {0}.\nThus, after translating by \u2212v1 in case v1 < 0, we can assume that all vj are positive. Combining\nthis with the above, we see that for odd g, 0 < v1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < vg and 0 < vg\u2212 vg\u22121 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < vg\u2212 v1 < vg\ngive isomorphic curves, and we have chosen the lexicographically smaller representative in Tables 9\nand 10 for genus 3 curves.\nWe can also look at the cases where the last rational factor in (10.10) is reducible, for instance,\nwhen it has a linear factor ax\u2212 1 with a \u2208 Z. Then 1\/a is a root of this polynomial, so\ng\u220f\nj=1\n(vj\/a + 1) = \u22134a\u2212g\u22121.\nIt follows that a(a + v1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (a + vg) = \u22134, which leaves only finitely many possibilities for a and\nthe vj . It is easy to see that the only two examples for g > 1 and 0 < v1 < v2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 are\nv = {2, 5}, a = \u22121 and v = {3, 4}, a = \u22122.\n(There is also v = {1, 3, 4}, a = \u22122 but the resulting curve is singular.) Finally, there is a case for\ng = 3 where the last factor of (10.10) splits into two quadratic factors over the rationals, namely\nv = {1, 5, 6}.

Such a relation was indeed found numerically in all three cases.\nThe results are summarized in Tables 8 (genus 2), 9 (genus 3), 10 (genus 3) and 11 (genus 4).\nThe entries in the tables are sorted according to the conductor. Unfortunately, we cannot compute\nthe numerical values of L\u2217(0) for g \u0001 5 for these curves because the conductors become too large.\nRemark 10.11. The second author established in [Jeu05] a limit formula for the regulator of\nM1, . . . ,Mg (corresponding to v1x+1, . . . , vgx+1) for the curves in Example 10.8 when v1, . . . , vg\u22121\nare fixed and |vg| goes to infinity. It follows that, for every g \u0001 2, there are infinitely many of such\ncurves for which that regulator does not vanish and rkK2(C;Z) \u0001 g. It is also determined precisely\nwhen the curves in Example 10.8 are isomorphic over Q (see [Jeu05, Remark 6.9]), and shown that\nthe regulator does not vanish (and hence rkK2(C;Z) \u0001 g) for infinitely many isomorphism classes\nover Q.\nSuch results are also proven for certain hyperelliptic curves over Q that are similar to those in\nExample 10.8, as well as for certain elliptic curves over arbitrary real quadratic fields.\nRemark 10.12. All but two of the curves in our tables have distinct conductors and are therefore\npairwise non-isomorphic. The two exceptions are the curve b = 1 of Table 4 and the curve v = {3, 4}\nof Table 8, which both have conductor 816. These curves are in fact isomorphic, by mapping (x, y)\nto (\u2212x\/(2x + 1), y\/(2x + 1)3).\nRemark 10.13. As mentioned in the introduction, in a number of cases we gave more than g elements\nof K2(C;Z) and hence by Conjecture 3.11 expected to find a linear relation among them. In all but\nseven cases (two in each of Tables 3 and 8, and one in each of Tables 4, 5 and 9), Propositions 6.3\nand 6.14(2) suffice to show that the subgroup \u039b of K2(C;Z) has at most the predicted rank g.\n370\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nTable 9.

We did not try to prove the expected\nrelation between the Mi, and therefore that the rank of \u039b is as predicted by Conjecture 3.11, for any\nof the seven cases. Each could, of course, be checked by a finite calculation if it is true: for instance,\nthe conjectural relation (10.3) states that some non-zero multiple of the element(\ny2\nx5\n)\n\u2297\n(\n(1\u2212 x)41(1\u2212 4x)56\n(1\u2212 6x+ 11x2 \u2212 x3)44\n)\nin the tensor square of the multiplicative group of the function field of the curve y2 \u2212 (7x2 \u2212\n6x+1)y+ x5 = 0 is a combination of tensor products of the form ui\u2297 (1\u2212ui), and if this is indeed\ntrue then one can obviously prove it simply by exhibiting the elements ui. However, in some sense\nit is precisely the fact that there is no visible reason for such a relation, apart from the fact that\nthe rank is not expected to exceed 2 in this case, that provides the strongest experimental support\nfor Beilinson\u2019s conjecture.\nRemark 10.14. One reason we have given detailed results for so many individual curves, apart from\nthe fact that each example is non-trivial to find and to calculate and that it therefore seemed worth\nlisting them completely, is that the experimental data about the values of L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039b) may be\nuseful in the future for the formulation or numerical verification of conjectures about this rational\n371\nT.

We will not\nmake any attempt to give such conjectures. We do note, however, that we often find an integer\nfor L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039b). So it might be that L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(K2(C;Z)) is always an integer, and that the\ndenominators that occur in L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039b) for some of our examples can be explained by the fact that\n\u039b is not the full group K2(C;Z) because L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(K2(C;Z)) = (K2(C;Z) : \u039b) \u00b7 L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039b).\nThis would be similar to what happens in the discussion of the case of b = \u22121 in Example 10.1, where\n\u039bM = \u3008M1,M2,M3\u3009 leads to L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039bM ) ?= 1\/2, but the larger lattice \u039b = \u3008M1,M2,M3,M\u3009,\nwith (\u039b : \u039bM ) = 2, gives L\u2217(C, 0)\/R(\u039b)\n?= 1.\nUnfortunately, we have not been able to test this as we do not know any systematic ways to\nconstruct elements of K2(C;Z) other than those we discussed. However, it would be interesting\nto do this, especially for the curve defined by\ny2 + (5x3 \u2212 13x2 + 7x\u2212 1)y + x7 = 0\n(which is the example with a = 1 and b = 2 of Table 5), where the denominator is the relatively\nlarge prime 19.\n372\nBeilinson\u2019s conjecture for K2 of hyperelliptic curves\nAcknowledgements\nThe first two authors would like to thank the Colle`ge de France for a visit to work on this paper,\nas well as the EC network Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry for travel support.
