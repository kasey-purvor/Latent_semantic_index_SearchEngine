This modulation can be \nachieved by exposing the fibre to a UV interference pattern [2]. The presence of the modulation, of period of \norder 0.5 \u03bcm, results in the coupling of the forward propagating mode of the fibre to a backward propagating \nmode at a wavelength that satisfies the Bragg condition, \n\u039b= effB n2\u03bb     ( 1) \n \nWhere \u03bbB is the Bragg wavelength, neff is the effective index of the propagating mode and \u039b is the period of \nthe refractive index modulation.  A change in the period of the modulation or in the effective index of the \npropagating mode in response to the local environment thus gives rise to a change in the Bragg wavelength. \nThe determination of the wavelength change is then the basis of operation of FBG sensors. The primary \nmeasurands for FBG sensors are temperature and strain. \n \nThe sensitivity of the Bragg wavelength to temperature arises from the change in period associated with the \nthermal expansion of the fibre, coupled with a change in the refractive index arising from the thermo-optic \neffect. The strain sensitivity of the Bragg wavelength arises from the change in period of the fibre, coupled \nwith a change in the refractive index arising from the strain-optic effects.  Recent studies have shown that \nthe response to temperature exhibits a small non-linearity [3]. \n \nSome industrial and aerospace applications require sensors to operate at elevated temperatures for extended \nperiods of time. If the strain sensitivity of FBG sensors exhibits a temperature dependence, then operation of \nthis sensor type could be problematic if it were to be operated at a temperature that is significantly different \n 3\nfrom that at which it was calibrated. A thermal dependence of the strain sensitivity of a FBG would result \nfrom the temperature dependence of the materials\u2019 parameters of silica glass. Previous research [4] has \nshown that the stress-optic coefficient of vitreous silica demonstrates a negligible temperature dependence. \nHowever, Morey et al [5] measured a 5 % decrease in the slope of the stress response for Germanium doped \nsilica fibre at 650\u00b0C. A change of 8 % had been expected, based on Young\u2019s modulus data. This discrepancy \nwas attributed to a change in the stress-optic coefficient, which they suggest represents approximately 22 % \nof the Bragg wavelength shift with load. A more detailed examination of the temperature dependence of the \nstrain response of FBGs written into a number of different fibre types is presented here. \n \nThe positive thermal expansion coefficient in glasses results in a decrease in both the density and the \nrefractive index with increasing temperature. However, the electron polarizability increases  and produces an \nincrease in the refractive index [6][7]. The electron polarizability dominates in silicate glasses, but the \nmagnitude of its temperature sensitivity can vary by a factor of ten depending on the composition of the \nglass. Another possible factor affecting the refractive index is the differential expansion of the core and \ncladding due to their slightly different compositions. This effect could influence any changes in the fibre\u2019s \ndensity and in the electron polarizability. The fibre\u2019s composition will also affect its mechanical properties \n[8].   \n \nThe strain sensitivity of the Bragg wavelength is generally assumed to be independent of temperature. \nHowever, it is known that the material parameters that determine the strain sensitivity, the strain optic \ncoefficients and Poisson ratio, are themselves temperature dependent [7-9]. This paper aims to investigate \nthe effect of the thermal sensitivity of these parameters upon the strain sensitivity of FBG sensors.   \n 4\nTHEORY \nBarlow and Payne [9] demonstrated that the stress-optic coefficient of optical fibre decreases with increasing \ntemperature. Assuming an equivalent effect in the strain-optic coefficient it might be expected that the strain \nsensitivity of a FBG would increase at elevated temperatures. A theoretical analysis of the temperature effect \nhas been performed to estimate the magnitude of the change in the strain response of a typical FBG. The \ndependence of the Bragg wavelength upon strain and temperatures changes is given by [10]: \n( )[ ] \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +++\u2212+= TTTpTpTpTnT B \u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03bb )()()()()(2\n11),( 121112\n2\n0   (2) \n \nWhere no is the unperturbed fibre refractive index, \u03c5 is Poisson\u2019s ratio, p12 and p11 are Pockels strain optic \ncoefficients, \u03b5  is the axial strain,  T is the temperature, \u03be is a thermal coefficient, including thermo-optic and \nthermal expansion contributions. \u03bbB is the initial Bragg wavelength such that equation 2 describes the \nmodified Bragg wavelength resulting from applied strain and temperature changes.

Using the previously reported temperature sensitivity of these \nparameters, in conjunction with well established values for the material parameters, Equation 3 was used to \nsimulate the effects of temperature on the strain response. The following parameters were used to this end: \u03bd \n(Poisson\u2019s ratio) = 0.25 and d\u03bd\/dT \u2245 2.5\u00d710-4 % \u00b0C-1 [8], \u03bbB = 850 nm and d\u03bbB\/dT = 7 \u00d710-12 m  \u00b0C-1, neff = \n1.5[7], dn\/dT (for silica glass) = 10.8\u00d710-6 \u00b0C-1 [7], p12 = 0.252 and p11 = 0.133 [11] and dpi\/dT = -0.134\u00d710-3   \n\u00b0C-1 (predicted from [9]). \n 5\nFigure 1 shows the temperature induced change in the strain response of an FBG with a Bragg wavelength of \n850 nm calculated using the parameters given above. The gradient of this graph leads to is predicted value of \nthe temperature dependence of the strain sensitivity to be 0.2 fm \u03bc\u03b5-1 \u00b0C-1. \n \nEXPERIMENT \nThe experimental configuration is shown schematically in figure 2. The output from a fibre pigtailed \nsuperluminescent diode, SLD, with a central wavelength of 840 nm, a bandwidth of approximately 20nm, \nand a fibre coupled power of 0.5 mW, was used to illuminate the FBGs via a directional coupler. The \nreflected Bragg wavelengths were monitored using a tuneable filter based upon a scanning fibre Fabry-Perot \n(FFP) interferometer[12], manufactured by Micron Optics, with an FSR measured to be 2.3\u00b10.7\u00d7104 GHz, \nwhich is approximately equivalent to 47 nm at a centre wavelength of 830nm. The finesse was 220. The \ntransmission of the FFP was monitored using an avalanche photodiode, APD (C5460-01, Hamamatsu \nPhotonics). A voltage ramp was applied to the scanning FFP, and the spectrum was determined by \nmonitoring the output from the APD in conjunction with the voltage applied to the FFP, which was \ncalibrated such that it allowed the instantaneous resonant wavelength of the FFP to be determined.  \n \nThe tensile load was applied to the FBG by anchoring it between a fixed block and the moveable platform of \na translation stage, initially separated by 185 \u00b1 0.5 mm.  The moveable platform was subsequently displaced \nby applying a voltage to an internal PZT stack. The fibre, stripped of its polyacrylate buffer jacket, was \nattached to the anchoring points using a cyanoacrylate strain gauge adhesive. The experimental \nconfiguration was constructed such that a tube furnace was positioned between the fibre fixing points. The \nFBG was located at the central region of the tube furnace, in which the temperature profile varied by \u00b1 5 \u00b0C \nalong its axis over the central 4 cm of the furnace. The furnace could operate between ambient temperature \n 6\nand 900\u00b0C. The oven used a PID circuit to maintain the desired temperature with an accuracy and stability of \n\u00b1 1 \u00b0C. \n \nThe FBGs were fabricated in hydrogen loaded optical fibre using a UV holographic technique [13]. The \nfibres used are listed in Table 1. The FBGs, each of length 5mm, had bandwidths in the range 0.2-0.4 nm, \nand reflectivities of 30 % - 80 %. Since the concentrations and types of dopants utilized during fibre \nfabrication will vary between manufacturers, a number of different fibres were tested, each from a different \nmanufacturer. \n \nCare was taken to eliminate as many possible influences upon the characterisation of the FBG strain \nsensitivity. Following FBG fabrication, the fibre was maintained at room temperature and pressure for a \nperiod in excess of two weeks, allowing the hydrogen to diffuse out of the fibres [14]. Tests have shown \nthat, under normal conditions, the refractive index modulation of FBGs fabricated in hydrogen loaded fibre \ndecreases by ~ 15 % in the initial few weeks following FBG fabrication, corresponding to a decrease in \nreflectance of ~ 9 % over the first 14 days. This change is not observed in FBGs fabricated in optical fibres \nthat were not hydrogen loaded [15].  \n \nThe FBGs were then annealed at a temperature of 500 \u00b0C for seven hours. This temperature was chosen \nbecause it lies at the beginning of the transition range for silica glass, and it is likely that the fibre will \nbehave inelastically above it. Consequently, the strain response of the FBGs will prove non-linear in the \ntransition range and above. In fact, FBGs have been shown to exhibit hysteresis in the transition range [5], \nand so 500 \u00b0C may be considered to be the upper temperature limit for the operation of FBGs. All fibres \nwere annealed under the same conditions, as previous studies have shown that the response to annealing is \nlargely independent of fibre composition [15].  \n \n 7\nAnnealing can be considered to occur in two steps: Firstly, internal stresses are removed through heat \ntreatment, and secondly, cooling is performed at such a rate as to prevent their return. Without this internal \nstrain relief, changes in refractive index at different temperatures may have been misconstrued as a cross-\nsensitivity effect. In addition, Young\u2019s modulus for glass will be lower if there is residual strain present [16]. \nBoth of these effects may introduce additional error into the measurements. Annealing not only removes \nmechanical strain, but also brings the glass to a condition approximating an internal equilibrium. Heat \ntreatment, even below the annealing temperature, can result in a change in Young\u2019s modulus, with the value \nof Young\u2019s modulus increasing with decreasing annealing temperature. Morey [16] suggests that a period of \n5 hours appears to be sufficient for most glasses to stabilize. \n \nThe linearity of the scan over the FSR of the FFP used in this work was investigated. The experimental \narrangement comprised an APD that monitored the output from the FFP as it is scanned through a spectrum \ngenerated by a passive Fabry-Perot etalon. The rationale of the experiment was to analyse the linearity of the \nPZT displacement by monitoring a spectrum in which the constituent fringes had a constant optical \nfrequency separation. Any deviation from a constant separation of the fringes would indicate a non-linearity \nin the PZT response, which could then be quantified. A passive FP etalon was formed between the ends of \ntwo fibres mounted on two separate translation stages; consequently, the cavity was adjusted easily to \nproduce a spectrum with the desired fringe separation. The SLD was used to illuminate the etalon. The ramp \nwaveform applied to the FFP and the resulting transmission spectrum were monitored simultaneously. The \nresults showed a linearity within the manufacturers specifications (2 %) over the operational range used in \nthe subsequent characterisation of the FBG strain response. All measurements were made relative to a \ntemperature stabilised reference FBG spectrum. Slight modification of the finesse over the FSR arising from \nchanges in the reflectivities of the dielectric films, over the full FSR was specified by the manufacturers to \nbe less than two percent [17].  \n \n 8\nAnother possible source of uncertainty was the method used to place the FBG under tensile strain. Although \nthe PZT used to apply the strain was operated over its nominally linear region, it was important to avoid \nnonlinearity or hysteresis in the application of the strain. The FBG, on the other hand, is known to show no \nsignificant nonlinearity in wavelength shift as a function of applied strain, even if stretched up to breaking \npoint [18]. To minimise the influence of these issues, the displacement of the stage was measured using a \nMichelson interferometer in which one reflector was mounted on the moveable stage. Any variation of the \noutput of the interferometer from a perfect sinusoidal output could then be detected. As an additional \nprecaution, the buffer coating was removed from the full length of fibre to be strained to eliminate any effect \nit might have on the FBG response \n \nThe Michelson interferometer employed a Coherent 200 single frequency He-Ne laser. The laser was \ntemperature stabilised to eliminate ambient temperature induced shifts in the emitted wavelength. The laser \nwas specified to have a stability of \u2264 \u00b1 1 MHz per 5 minutes. The advantage of using the interferometer set-\nup was that linearisation of the applied strain was achieved in an absolute and independent fashion.  \n \nThe resolution of the system was optimised by reducing the amplitude of the ramp applied to the FFP, such \nthat the wavelength scan of the filter was limited to the maximum wavelength range expected for the level of \napplied strain. Thus, given the limited sampling frequency of the data acquisition card, the acquired \nspectrum contained the maximum possible number of samples. A scan frequency of 6.06 Hz was applied to \nthe FFP, and the acquisition card sampled at 104 samples per second. The Bragg wavelengths were \ndetermined from the captured spectrum by fitting a quadratic polynomial to a group of consecutive data \npoints and subsequently differentiating the fitted polynomial to determine if the group contained a \nmaximum. The quadratic fit moved over the spectrum as a sliding window. The fitting routine interpolated \nbetween points. The overall resolution of the system, of 0.59 \u00b1 0.04 pm, corresponding to 0.96 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5\u03b5, \nwas achieved over 26 % of the FSR; consequently, this system provides a dynamic range of 45 dB. The \n 9\ncalibrated interrogation and demodulation scheme was then used to investigate the temperature effects on the \nstrain response of a number of FBGs written into three different fibre types.  \n \nIn order to predict the magnitude of change in response it was necessary to determine experimentally the \nthermal responses of the gratings. This was achieved by measuring the resonant wavelength of an FBG at a \nrange of different temperatures, as shown in figure 3, for Fibrecore PS750.  The sensitivity measured, (7.0 \u00b1 \n0.2) pm \/ \u00b0C, is typical of the thermal sensitivity of FBGs. \n \nThe strain sensitivity was characterised at the highest temperature first. The temperature was subsequently \ndecreased before the next set of readings. The measurements were performed in this fashion to ensure that \nany permanent thermal effect on the FBG resultant from the high temperature treatment would be the same \nfor each subsequent temperature regime. The fibre was allowed to reach thermal equilibrium before any \nmeasurements were made. This was done to eliminate thermally induced stress due to temperature gradients \nthrough the fibre. This should be achieved for a 125 micron diameter fibre in about 30 seconds [19]. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe temperature dependence of the strain response was obtained for each of the fibres by measuring the \nstrain response at a range of temperatures from 100\u00b0C to 400\u00b0C. The results for the Fibrecore fibre are \nshown in figures 4a-4e. Each data point is the average of 40 readings. The gradient of a straight line fitted \nthrough each of these sets of data points is then used to plot the strain response as a function of temperature. \nThe results for this are shown for each fibre type in figures 5-7 and summarised in table 1. The gradient of a \nstraight line fitted through these points then provides the thermal dependence of the strain response of each \nfibre type. These graphs show good linearity over the range of temperature used. The measurements show \nthat there is a change in the response of the FBG at different temperatures, though the magnitude of this \nchange is such that its effect would only be significant over large temperature or strain ranges (~0.5 % over a \n1000 \u00b0C). The experimental results indicate that the temperature dependence of the strain sensitivities of the \n 10\nvarious fibre types investigated lie within the range 0.20 \u2013 0.21 fm \u03bc\u03b5-1 \u00b0C-1, in agreement with the \ntheoretical prediction of 0.2 fm \u03bc\u03b5-1 \u00b0C-1, within the bounds of the experimental errors quoted.  \n \nIt is important to consider the influence of the experimental procedure upon the results. The variation in the \ntemperature along the length of the tube furnace, \u00b1 5 \u00b0C over the central 4 cm, and the problem of ensuring \nthat each FBG tested was at the same location in the furnace, complicates the comparison with the results \nobtained for the different fibres. However, for any given fibre, the location of the FBG within the furnace \nwas maintained throughout the strain sensitivity characterisation ensuring self consistent results. \n \nAnother complication when applying a tensile load to the fibre at higher temperatures is an error introduced \nby the inelastic behaviour of the fibre, effectively further drawing the fibre. This will have the effect of \nchanging the mechanical properties and the pitch of the FBGs. Further reason for not characterising the \nstrain sensitivity at  higher temperatures are cross-sensitivity effects which result in measurement errors that \nincrease in proportion to the product of strain and temperature [20]. As a result, strain sensitivity \ncharacterisation performed at high temperatures will be inherently more erroneous than that performed at \nlower temperatures. The hysteresis effect previously observed for prolonged strain application at 650 \u00b0C [5] \nwas not observed in these experiments. This is probably a result of the lower temperatures employed, which \navoid the transition range for silica fibre, where the application of a tensile load may result in the further  \ndrawing of the fibre.  \n \nA potential improvement in the measurement of the variation in the strain response with temperature might \nbe to include a second reference in the oven to account for miscellaneous temperature effects. It is possible \nthat thermal fluctuations could be misinterpreted as strain. This internal reference FBG would experience a \nsimilar thermal environment to the sensor under strain making it possible to separate out additional factors \nother than applied strain that affected the response of the sensor. \n \n 11\nCONCLUSIONS \nThe temperature effects on the strain responses of in-fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) written into three differing \nfibre types has been investigated. It was found that these responses changed on average by 0.21 \u00b1 0.03 fm \n\u00b5\u03b5-1 \u00b0C-1 over a temperature range of 100-400 \u00b0C. The results obtained are in agreement, to within the \nexperimental error, with  predictions based on material parameters. \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nMartin O\u2019Dwyer acknowledges the support of a European Commission Training and Mobility of \nResearchers (TMR) grant.
